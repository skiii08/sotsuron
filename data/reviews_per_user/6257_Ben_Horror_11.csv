Source Code," BANG, rewind, BANG, rewind...
","Time travel stories are a penny a dozen and as old as hills themselves, so it's always a challenge for filmmakers to come up with a new spin on a very old tale. This is where 'Source Code' comes in and thankfully, it succeeds.Plot-wise the movie is very succinct: there's been a tragic terrorist incident involving a bomb on a Chicago train that resulted in huge loss of life. Another attack is imminent. Jake Gyllenhal plays a soldier – Colter Stevens - who's participating in a top secret experiment – the 'source code' of the title – whose job is to investigate the 8 minutes preceding the explosion so he can ascertain the identity of the bomber and hopefully prevent another catastrophe. The one negative side effect of this is he's ends up being constantly sent back in time only to get blown up again and again - until he can find out what exactly happened.The movie plays out in a 'rinse and repeat' fashion, advancing bit by bit, gradually – and enticingly - revealing more and more information each time. With every replay, we see a new item of information or something we haven't really noticed before. If this scenario reminds you of a certain comedy starring Bill Murray and a groundhog, then you're not far wrong. It's the same basic concept of 'rewinding' time, but whereas the explanation of that movie was left to the viewer to decide how or why it was happening, Source Code tells you up front that there's a Sci-fi angle anchoring everything. You could also throw other movies like Vantage Point into the mix and you'll get the general drift that we're seeing a single event played out umpteenth times.But thankfully there's a bit more going on besides endless 'play and rewinds' as Colter Stevens also has to figure out his place in the whole 'Source Code' experiment and as with the bomb plot, nuggets of information is given away at just enough intervals to keep the whole thing from becoming too repetitious. The film is very well executed and acted. The scenario is intriguingly set up and the way it's told will have you glued to the screen from start to finish. In fact you won't want to drop your guard once – you'll be that intent on finding out what's going on in the increasing baffling narrative. The science of the time traveling is also very imaginative and is explained just enough for you to go along with the whole scenario. Of course there is a lot of mumbo-jumbo about quantum physics, but at the same time they don't overdo it to such an extent that you feel you're going to come down with a sever case of the Zzzzs anytime soon. Jake Gyllenhaal is brilliant as the confused time travel guinea pig Colter Stevens and he effortlessly manages to anchor the whole potentially confusing scenario with a likable presence. He's entirely relatable as the 'every man' caught up in the nightmarish situation. Likewise Michelle Monaghan plays her part with a very appealing 'girl next door' quality and even if most of her role in the movie is of the 'rewinding' variety, it says something that she never allows it to go stale. Jeffery Wright is also excellent as the cold, limping, 'by the book' scientist who's spearheading the entire operation without a shred of morals on display. Director Duncan Jones' last movie was Moon and admittedly this movie shares a similar DNA to it in that there's a lot of stuff about the nature of identity, second chances, and other life affirming messages, though as with Moon, you have to get through a lot of darkness before you get to the bright stuff. As with Christopher Nolan, he seems to have certain themes and traits that he's evidently very interested in.The only letdown of this film is, so intent are the film makers/ distributors not to insult certain lucrative foreign markets, they're at pains to sledgehammer home the whole 'never judge a book by its cover' idea, which is a little bit of a disappointment considering the biggest threat to US security is from the very regions they're so keen to avoid offending in the first place. That's the only part of the movie that doesn't quite ring through, which is a shame considering everything else is so damn good. Like the aforementioned Groundhog Day and Vantage Point before it, the biggest disadvantage of movies like this, is they have a low 'rewatchability' factor because they're so dependent on retelling the same event over and over. They generally wear out their welcome faster than a normal movie because the viewer becomes so familiar with the story beats that after even two viewings, it feels like you've already seen it a dozen times. Source Code is the same. Basically you get all the surprises the first time, but as a first time viewing experience, it's truly excellent stuff and will keep you hooked to the very end.",8,1,2,4 April 2011
Skyfall," A low-key and not very action packed Bond
","In 2006, Martin Campbell directed 'Casino Royale' starring the then controversial choice of Daniel Craig. The casting of fair-haired Craig marked him as the first Bond to be blonde and – unlike his predecessors – the first actor to play Bond who was under six-foot (for the original producer, the late Cubby Broccoli, this would have been something of a strict no-no). The decision was greeted by almost widespread disapproval (heck, someone even set up a website to vent his fury at the decision)and things were not looking good. However, the risk paid off and Casino Royale turned out to be one of the best Bond movies in recent years. It did good business and laid the groundwork for the follow-up (and sequel, of sorts – a Bond first) 'Quantum of Solace'. While still being a huge hit, the words 'boring' and 'hard to follow' were not exactly uncommon place at the time. Which leads us onto the latest movie 'Skyfall' – the twenty-third in the franchise (that is if you don't count Sean Connery's 1983 venture in 'Never Say Never Again' and 1967's 'Casino Royale' starring – ahem – Woody Allen as 'Jimmy Bond').After an operation goes wrong, Bond goes missing in action for a while – not in the least helped by the actions of M (Judi Dench). Meanwhile, a shadowy and ruthless figure from M's past comes back to haunt her by first of all exposing the names of undercover agents before moving on to more explosive tactics. This forces the now embittered double-o-seven to put his anger aside and return from the 'dead' to help his boss out with this latest threat to Queen and country. First thing's first: there is a lot that this movie does right. The entire cast are excellent. From a fantastic opening scene and the refreshingly low-tech opening titles which could have came from the seventies (a far cry from the CGI drenched titles of the Brosnan years) to the title song, sung in an unshowy, understated fashion by Adele, this movie marks a return to the basics in a way unseen since From Russia With Love. You see, Skyfall is not really about set pieces and gadgets; it's more of a drama this time – but with some action thrown in. As with the previous Craig movies, this kicks off with a – surprise, surprise – chase. Whereas Casino's was on foot and Quantum's was in cars, this one starts on foot, moves to motorcycles before ending up atop a moving train. Make no mistake: it really is riveting and on edge of your seat stuff, but it's something that comes back to haunt the filmmakers later on Yes, you've guessed it: this movie suffers from a severe aliment known as 'The Dark Knight Rises syndrome'. What this means is the opening is SO good and spectacular and sets the bar so high, whatever comes after it can only hope to live up to it. And unfortunately, as with The Dark Knight Rises, Skyfall also shoots its load too soon and although it tries, never quite lives up to the breathtaking opening.There are some aspects of this movie that don't make any sense. They may be a legacy of last minute script editing and if this is the case, it really shows. For example, in one part of the movie, Bond and co discuss a certain evil character who has no country/nationality/next of kin and is basically a 'ghost' with no permanent base/home; yet Bond quickly gets the location of his next destination via a simple text. In another part, Bond is taken to meet Silva - the bad guy of this movie (a fantastic Javier Bardem) by boat. While on deck, he takes out a homing device and puts it in his pocket. This understandably has bad repercussions for Silva and leads inevitably to the obvious question: why on earth wasn't Bond frisked beforehand? Meanwhile, in another scene, two people are trying to flee stealthily from a violent shoot- out/assault in a rural area so as not to alert the ruthless hit men; yet they don't have the gumption to avoid switching on their flashlight which alerts the bad guys. It is silly moments like these that really drag the quality of this movie down a notch. There's no excuse – the makers have had four years to sort this stuff out. And let's not get started about all the product placement The rather odd thing about this movie is it cost a reported two hundred million dollars to put up on the screen, but it does not look it. James Cameron was able to make Avatar for just forty million more and in 3D. For the amount of money that was spent on Skyfall, you kind of expect spectacle, i.e., envelop pushing action scenes. In general, most people come to see Bond movies for the excitement and the action. Who can forget the helicopter/roof chase of 'Tomorrow Never Dies'? Or the huge, multiple tanker truck set piece at the end of 'Licence to Kill'? With the exception of the exciting – and spectacular opening scene -sadly, the set pieces here are few and far between. There's a few sporadic action scenes scattered throughout the long running time but they're so brief as to not stand out like previous Bonds. Yes, Sam Mendes may have took the admirable step of taking things back to its 'roots', but it comes at a cost of the very thing that Bond is known for.In conclusion, while Casino Royale still remains the benchmark of the Daniel Craig outings – if not also the best Bond movie of the last fifteen years – this is still a huge improvement over Quantum of Solace, and makes for an engaging two-hour plus of good story telling. It's just a shame that the number of large-scale action set pieces can be counted on one hand.",7,1,6,29 October 2012
World War Z," Zombie Holocaust!
","World War Z gained a lot of notoriety from all the rumors of production problems, reedits and expensive re-shoots. From all those negative stories, you would be forgiven for expecting an incoherent vomit of a movie; that it's not only easy to follow, but also well made and gripping is a massive plus. WWZ tells the story of a mysterious global pandemic, the source of which is unknown, but which turns the majority of the earth's population into rampaging zombies. We see the outbreak from the perspective of Gerry (Brad Pitt) and his family, as they witness it first hand while stuck in rush hour. From there, Gerry – a former government agent - is coerced back into action to find a cure and it is action all the way until the end.You have to admire this movie on many levels. It's supposedly a summer 'tent pole' release – traditionally a time for family movies - yet, it features lots of zombies running around biting people while getting shot in the process. There are panoramic shots of zombies running amok and the ensuing widespread destruction. And even if the bloodletting and gore levels are appropriately sanitized and restrained for the summer audience, still you have to revel in the joy of an actual summer zombie movie. When has that happened before? When is it likely to happen again?Brad Pitt (looking about 35 here) makes for a solid action hero as he goes through one hellish experience after another. Strangely, he doesn't really have a regular counterpart/sidekick to bounce ideas/dialog off, resulting in a lot of him asking questions on behalf of the viewer. The one time it seems as if he's going to get a sidekick, said sidekick is dispatched rather quickly in an unintentionally amusing fashion – presumably to give Brad/Gerry more to do. Furthermore, there isn't really the usual secondary subplot to cut to and as such as we see the chaos unfold mostly from his viewpoint. This has the unforeseen consequence of giving the movie a very 'chaptered' form; one-off events – almost like little mini-stories in their own right - take place in one country after another with their own beginning middle and ending and usually as Pitt the lone protagonist as the witness.The zombie action is excellent and we see suitably large-scale set- pieces of wanton zombie destruction. There is a level of scope and ambition here that you just won't see in something like 'The Walking Dead'. Though it has to be pointed out that those wide vista shots of the zombie hoards building 'ant hills' to scale walls happens only a handful of times in the movie. Even at that, you've probably already seen them in the prevalent trailers, which admittedly takes away some of the 'Wow Factor'.Now onto the aforementioned 'productions problems' and 're-shoots' that littered this movie's gestation. It's hard to evaluate it without taking those 'issues' into account. Why? Because the telltale signs are so evident. The story takes strange turns, focusing on some elements while completely ignoring others. For example, early on in the story, we see Gerry and his family rescuing a young boy – who we assume Gerry will semi-adopt and become a surrogate father figure to since his offspring are girls; this is how it seems it's being set up - yet the child is never seen or referred to again.Similarly, Gerry later takes a wounded Israeli soldier under his wing but she is so underwritten and cipher-like, you wonder: what's the point? If that's not enough, then take a high profile actor like Matthew Fox (of Lost); he features early on in the story and you assume he will figure prominently later; instead, he just shows up a handful of times in what could be the role of a background extra and one not worthy of Fox's talents. Just like John Cusack's shorn role in Terence Malicks's 'The Thin Red Line' (1998), what you begin to suspect is that Fox too was a victim of all the re-shoots/re-edits and his arc probably featured more prominently in the earlier version. And if you really want to nitpick, a scene at a facility, while admittedly a stand out that's very well executed, still feels very glued on almost as if it came from a different movie. Yet another legacy of the re-shoots? Probably it certainly feels that way.As for the pandemic, a reference is made to rabies early on in the story, then it's never really mentioned again. It's vagueness like this that rears its head again and again. Still, it's not the disaster that had been foreshadowed by some members of the media. Yes, it may feel chaptered but it's an intelligent film – for a zombie movie, anyway – that has stuff to say while showing you big spectacle. You really get the impression that this is truly a global pandemic.And that's the one thing this movie has going for it over a lot of movies of the genera: take any of the Romero zombie movies or any zombie movie from the last few decades, and what you find is the action/outbreak is always restricted to small areas/backwater towns. Not so here – this is the real zombie deal on a massive scale. For the first time ever, you see a zombie apocalypse taking place in cities in populated streets and not just on some back road in the middle of nowhere. But there has to be a trade-off: you can do spectacle or gore but you can't do both. That type of thing costs money, and if you're spending a lot of money, you want your product to be seen by the widest audience possible – meaning what essentially boils down to a bloodless zombie movie. Still there is enough good material in here to keep you interested and make the idea of a sequel/sequels a not altogether unwelcome proposition.",7,1,7,25 June 2013
Life of Pi," A large scale yet very intimate epic
","Based on an apparently 'unfilmable' book, Life of Pi tells the powerful story of an Indian man named Pi (after a French swimming pool but shortened to the name of the mathematical number) who recounts the tale of his epic – and fantastical – survival at sea in the company of a Tiger named 'Richard Parker' (seriously) and some assorted wild animals after their ship sinks and they are cast adrift in a lifeboat. First things first: this is an absolutely incredible movie. In fact, this movie is so good, it ranks as one of the best of 2012. And if there is any justice in the world, it will garner an Oscar for Best Picture, Best Director (Ang Lee), Best Actor (Suraj Sharma – young Pi), Best Supporting Actor (Irrfan Khan – adult Pi) and Best Visual Effects, but more on all these later. Heck, let's throw Best Adapted Screenplay in there too, because this is a movie so well made, it actually hearkens back to a bygone era, almost eradicating the term 'They don't make 'em like they used to'. The scope may be massive, but the movie that is so old fashioned, you could easily imagine it being released eons ago in the 1940s. Ang Lee, director of the underrated 'Hulk', really deserves a lot of props here. While the easier route would have been to drastically change the story and cast an American in the lead role (stand up M. Night Shyamalan who did just this in 'The Last Airbender – subsequently angering an entire generation of Asians), Lee goes the opposite way and casts an Indian actor, or rather in this case, an Indian non-actor: Suraj Sharma - who plays Pi - had largely no acting experience prior to being cast, making the performance Ang Lee has coaxed out of him all the more extraordinary. You believe his every nuance and considering ninety-nine per cent of the time, he was probably acting with something that was not actually there, the conviction he injects into each scene is amazing. There has been animosity from some quarters regarding the whole framing device of the adult Pi recounting the story to a writer, dismissing it as an unnecessary obstacle to the crux of the movie: the survival at sea. But those criticisms are wrong; the introductory scenes of the adult Pi recounting his early life in India to the writer interviewing him are a hundred per cent necessary for what eventually transpires. In fact it could be argued that these early scenes are what make the movie: they give a much needed back-story to Pi's youth: being raised at the family zoo, how he got his strange name, and his relationship with his decent - but very tough - father (a brilliant Adil Hussain), who teaches him a very harsh lesson about life and death. These scenes are riveting in themselves and serve as the icing on the cake for what's to come.Strange as it may sound, the movie actually has a few things in common with a huge sci-fi movie: Avatar. Avatar looked great and the fear was we would have to wait until Avatar 2 before we would see a movie as beautiful again. Not so. Life of Pi is the first movie since Avatar to look THIS amazingly good. As with Avatar, the imagery has a fantastical element mixed in with all its sheer beauty. Furthermore, Life of Pi is also one of the first movies since Avatar to feature a CGI creation that is so photo-realistic and lifelike, that you can't actually tell which is which. The Tiger - Richard Parker – is a complex blend of real animals and computer generated ones. When it moves around on the boat, it's actually difficult to believe it's not a real Tiger – they got the weight distribution and movement so accurate, it's actually difficult to believe it's CGI. The effects company who did it deserve a lot of credit because they must have done a lot of research into the movements of Tigers to get such an accurate representation here. Let's just say Richard Parker in the Life of Pi puts Aslan the Lion in the 'Chronicles of Narnia' movies to shame. The seemingly small scale of the story somewhat underlies the evident technical wizardry that has gone on behind the scenes.The movie moves fast, is very clever and intelligently executed, and always remains engrossing – despite the hefty running time. There is a very obvious religious motif that runs through the entire thing, which may irritate those who don't like being sledge hammered with spiritual doctrine. You see, much to his father's chagrin, Pi follows three religions simultaneously: Hindu, Christianity and Islam. If you came here for some fast 'put your brain in neutral' action, then you came to the wrong place, pilgrim. As with Avatar, the 3D stands out as one of the better examples of the format (check out the lizard running up and flicking its tongue into camera at the opening). Refreshingly, it has been shot in 3D rather than being doctored in 3D in post-production and for the most part avoids the old hurling stuff at ya' template that has become the common, go-to practice with movies such as these. With 'Life of Pi', Ang Lee has created a modern classic. Yes, there are elements of darkness to this tale, but surely all fables have those? Simultaneously life affirming while teaching a life-lesson too, this movie will have legs. While a lot of movies come and go, some even largely forgotten, this one looks and feels like something whose life can only extend and whose fan base can only build over time – due, no doubt, in part to the fact that it will become one of those perennial favorites; those rarities that are replayed endlessly every Christmas for new generations to enjoy. Yes, it is THAT good.",10,1,3,28 December 2012
Man of Steel," Steel Man
","Just like the reboot/remake/sequel/whatever that was 'The Amazing Spider-Man', 'Man of Steel' chooses to retell an origin story. Except unlike that movie, this one at least has a good excuse: the original 'Superman: The Movie' came out in 1978 and is ripe for reinterpretation. First off, let's be honest: the late great Christopher Reeve was a brilliant Superman. He was also a brilliant Clark Kent, having the talent to thread a fine line with a performance that was at once comedic and sober. For some, he will always remain the quintessential Man of Steel. Rather like Sean Connery in the Bond franchise before him, he is the original and all who come after-wards have to stand in his shoes and be compared to him And admittedly, they are rather large shoes to fill They had previously attempted to fill those shoes in the 90s on TV with Dean Cain in 'Lois and Clark' and failed. They had tried it again in the 21st century in 'Smallville' with Tom Welling, which while being a huge improvement over the Cain version, was still missing something. The fact is, just like Batman/Bruce Wayne, Superman/Clark Kent is an extremely hard role to get exactly right. You can usually get somebody to do one or the other, but it's rare that they can do both. Among the things they got right this latest retelling of the story of Kal-El is the casting of Henry Cavill as the Man Of Steel. He is without doubt the best actor to don the cape since Christopher Reeve. Whereas Brandon Routh's rendition in the 2006 movie 'Superman Returns' is an honorable failure, the biggest problem with his interpretation of Kent/Superman seemed to be he was doing an impression of Christopher Reeve. Spot on as it was, he was channeling Reeve (probably at the behest of director Bryan Singer) to such extremes that you wondered why they even bothered. Another issue with that movie was Routh looked too young in the role: it's not Superboy/Boy of Steel, its Superman/Man of Steel, and as such, Cavill – even though he would have been in his late 20s during the time of shooting - brings a maturity and gravitas to the role unseen since Reeve's heyday. Rather than doing an impersonation, Cavill brings a fresh approach to a role that could have been one-dimensional - yes, he's THAT good.Christopher Nolan (The Dark Knight) produced this and it's easy to see his influence. The movie is meant to be rooted in reality with a gritty sense of realism. For one thing, check out the title: it's not called 'Superman' but the 'Man Of Steel'. So dedicated it is to this realistic approach that when the character is called Superman by someone, they are interrupted before they can finish; when we do eventually hear Cavill's character being called 'Superman', it's with an apologetic – almost embarrassed – tone. Seriously, what is wrong with it, and why couldn't they just have called this movie 'Superman'? No expense has been spared on this production and they have got a terrific cast. While the 1978 movie was great, it wasn't perfect. Terence Stamp's rendition of General Zod was slightly one-note; Michael Shannon in this gives a more three dimensional performance. And the growing romance between Lois and Clark here is done much better. But the unsung hero in all of this, it has to be said, is Kevin Costner playing Clark Kent's dad. His screen time may be minimum, but his impact is huge. Just like the greats of the past – Marlon Brando/Glen Ford playing the Kent's dad in the original - he casts a large shadow and his scenes with the young Kent as he reaches maturity are brilliant, genuinely touching, and heartfelt. Even after his arc of the story is completed, his ghost seems to loom throughout the remaining picture, with Kent/Superman carrying his legacy. Russell Crowe might be equally as good in his role as the father of Kal-El, but Costner leaves a lasting impression. Do they give Oscars for super hero movies? Just saying because, honestly, this movie needed more Kevin Costner in it. There are some small issues: the Krypton here is a vibrant, active world that seems very much alive; at least the Krypton in the 1978 version looked like it was already in the throes of death. This Krypton is also so hi-tech – you can see space ships - that you just have to wonder why Jor-El and wife don't just jump into a ship and escape with their baby? Similarly, what exactly is going on with Superman's breathing: he breathes in space; no, he can't; wait yes, he canBut the obvious question is: is it as good as the original 1978 movie? Is it even fair to compare the two? It's inevitable comparisons will be made but the simple answer is no, it's not as good because the original had a magic that isn't really present in this newer, rawer take. While there is no question that Messrs Cavill/Costner/Crowe/Shannon are definitely on par with the originals in the 1978 movie, somehow the wonder that was in that movie is missing here. For one thing – obviously attempting a 'clean slate' - they eschewed the brilliant John Williams composed theme. No musical themes here leap out and grab you the way that did. Furthermore, the effects in the original – dated though they are – have a realness to them because they were all done practically. This movie, it has to be said, turns into a CGI fest to a massive extent. While the CGI is more effective in the background - for example, when buildings are falling etc., - it's a bit less effective during the superhuman-on-superhuman bouts. Still, overall it is a worthy and spectacular watch. It beats Bryan Singer's entry in spades and is a more than deserving addition to the Superman cannon.",8,2,4,18 June 2013
The Amazing Spider-Man," The Amazingly Unnecessary Spider-man
","With the success of the first X-Men movie in 2000, Bryan Singer pretty much paved the way for all the comic book movies we see today. That included a certain super hero movie made by Sami Rami in 2002 where a nerdy guy (Tobey Maguire) gets bitten by a radioactive spider and inherits superhuman powers. If Singer had paved the way, then Rami provided the icing on the cake: a faithful, smart, well-acted super hero flick that had as much heart and sincerity packed in as it had all those set pieces. It also lead to a superior sequel and the much maligned, though underrated, third episode.Which brings us to what we have here: while not a beat for beat remake, you get the same story more or less with a different love interest and villain. Peter Parker (Andrew Garfield) sneaks into a research facility and gets bitten by a radioactive/genetically enhanced spider. He gets super powers and becomes Spider-Man. Meanwhile, a doctor (Rhys Ifans) working at the same facility, is being forced to close down his research into tissue regeneration. In desperation, he injects himself with an untested self-generating lizard vaccine and becomes a half man/half lizard thing. Spider-Man is then forced into action to stop him from spreading this contagion throughout the city of New York. Gwen Stacy (Emma Stone) is the damsel in distress/love interest and plays a role in trying to stop the crazed beast.First things first: this is not a bad film. It's well acted by all the principals, has good effects, a scary and menacing villain, some nice action sequences and web swinging effects that are generally slightly more realistic than the Rami version. Parker is more evidently scientific and intelligent here. Also the police's notion that Spider-Man is a menace to the public is more clearly defined, especially in the scene where he disarms an officer. The new idea is that Parker can hear the movements of spiders and it's a good addition. So where does it all go wrong? The short answer: it's just that it's so pointless. We had already seen the story before. There was absolutely no reason to tell it again. This movie could easily have been Spider-Man 4 with Andrew Garfield filling in the Spidey spandex instead of Tobey Maguire. But Marvel – in their infinite wisdom – just chose to tell the same story a second time. Going by that rationale, presumably Andrew Garfield will be cast aside like a disused sock when they inevitably choose to 'reboot' the franchise again in ten years or so. It is a scarily unimaginative tactic and it is one they will continue to do until there is a massive financial failure.This movie follows the same set up as the 2002 version: Parker being picked on, getting advice from his sage-like uncle (Martin Sheen), being bitten, getting his powers/climbing walls, and turning his back on a situation which unfortunately has tragic consequences for a family member. It's all a case of been there, done that. If you want to compare it to the Rami original, then the short answer is; as good as Andrew Garfield is, Tobey Maguire was better. Maguire filled the suit better; on occasion, Garfield is prone to looking thin and scrawny during several scenes. Even the suit looked better in the Rami movies. And those earlier movies had a heart and sincerity – especially in the relationship between Peter and his aunt and uncle that you don't see here. Again we ask: why does this movie exist?And there are holes: there's a massive lizard running around, wreaking havoc; yet the police are more preoccupied with pointing their guns at Spider-Man – despite the fact that he saved a child in a (surprise, surprise) rehashed scene set on a bridge taken from Rami's first movie. In another part, the citizens of the city (once again - in a bit taken from Rami's movie) unite to help Spider-Man cross the city using tower cranes – despite the fact that there are buildings all around him. Heck, even the villain is initially a do-gooder like Norman Osborn and Dr. Octavius – again from the Rami movies.It also seems to pull inspiration from another super hero movie: Christopher Nolan's Batman Begins (2005) in that it's slightly darker, tells such a large origin story that just like Batman Begins, Spider-Man doesn't actually show up on screen for the first hour. So if you take two parts Batman Begins and add a touch of Rami's Spider-Man, the result is what you have here. Additionally, the introduction of the web shooters, while being faithful to the original comics and emphasizing Parker's intellect, is a bit of a mixed blessing. The notion of the web being an organic material rather than being fired from mechanical devices actually made more sense.It's not that reboots are a bad idea, they're not. In certain situations they can work well, provided for example, enough time has elapsed. But there is no point in retelling the same story if the initial release is still relatively recent. In addition, it helps if the story wasn't covered well the first time, or it was a bad movie to begin with. Going by this criteria, Marvel's latest cash cow is unnecessary on all three accounts.In closing, if you haven't already seen the Rami movie from 2002, go watch it instead. If you have seen it, then this probably won't live up to it and you will be left feeling a little underwhelmed. It's fair to say that for anyone over the age of eighteen, this movie will seem rather half-hearted and senseless; for those under eighteen, this movie will probably be the greatest super hero flick ever. Yes, it's a movie that will divide opinions, primarily on the sole reason for its existence. Not a bad, or a badly made flick, by any means just a pointless one.",5,493,741,17 July 2012
Avatar," A hi-tech and Visually Stunning Space Adventure Story
","What is it with James Cameron's penchant for only using titles that begin with the letters 'T' and 'A'? We've already had The Terminator, Aliens, The Abyss, Terminator 2, True Lies, Titanic and now he's gone straight back to 'A' again with 'Avatar'. But then Avatar is an 'A' movie in more ways than one.Watching it, one could easily assume that the seeds for Avatar were sown in Cameron's head in 1989 upon the release of Dances With Wolves. As Cameron gazed at the epic scope of the western epic, he could easily have thought: 'Now why hasn't anybody set this story in space?' Thus, the synopsis of Avatar could be summarized almost identically: a soldier - Jake Sully - sent by the military to infiltrate the alien Na'vi race, falls in love with Neytiri - a native alien girl - and proves his metal to her people by becoming a warrior just like them, before finally 'going native' and joining them in battle against the very military power who sent him on the mission in the first place. We also get similar mystical overtones about being 'one with nature'. Similarly the Na'vi tribe in this movie is quite obviously based on the plight of both the Native Americans and the Africans.The familiarity of the story does not in any way detract from its entertainment value. If anything, maybe it enhances it. But Avatar is still exhilarating and exciting stuff. Visually, it's unlike anything you have ever seen before. What the movie lacks in originality, it makes up for with ideas: Avatar is simply brimming with them. Cameron's imagination is let loose on this movie in a way unseen in any of his other movies. The world of Pandora is vivid and beautiful. The animals we see have a fantastical – yet somehow feasible – quality about them. It's almost as if evolution on Pandora - rather than the filmmakers - has designed these creatures for the harsh, unforgiving terrain that they occupy.Avatar and Roland Emmerich's 2012 came out within a month of each other. While both are big, epic, state of the art special effects movies, it must be pointed out that the CG work on display in Avatar is vastly superior to that on offer in 2012: at no point – unlike 2012 – does the visual effects ever betray their origins. The Na'vi aliens are as photo realistic as anything ever seen. While there could definitely be an argument made that the film makers could have settled for a better design than the one they eventually went with, it's a testament to the realistic motion capture that you quickly accept them as living beings and don't question their realism. Anyone unfamiliar with the movie could easily assume they are all actors wearing make-up appliances – it's that good. And you know the filmmakers did a competent job when you actually believe that the Jake Sully character could actually fall in love with the strangely beguiling and attractive alien, Neytiri.It's undeniably an auteur's work from start to finish. Cameron's stamp is all over every frame. He even borrows liberally from his own back catalog, reusing the S.Q.U.I.D. technology concept from Strange Days (which he wrote) in a similar vein in that Jake Sully is 'plugged in' and experiencing life inside another being. Though Cameron must have surely pulled his hair out when he saw a similar conceit used in The Matrix in 1999 (Avatar was written in the early to mid 90s). We even see bipedal armored 'suits' worn by their human pilots, which are not too dissimilar to the Power Loader worn by Sigourney Weaver in Aliens (and who's also present in Avatar). Coincidentally a similar version of these machines can also be seen in the third Matrix sequel, The Matrix Revolutions! Sound-wise, the movie is just as astounding as it is visually, though it has to be said it seemed the sound designer 'borrowed' a few effects from the sound library created for Jurassic Park: one of the creatures makes a coughing/barking noise not too unlike the Velociraptor in the scene where the two kids are being stalked in the kitchen. On another occasion, a creature lets out a roar like that of the T-Rex during the attack on the two tour vehicles in the same movie. But these are just observations on what has to be one of the loudest mixes ever heard.Anyone who's expecting a barrage of objects to be hurled continuously at the screen will be sorely disappointed. Cameron's use of the 3D process is, for the most part, very subtle. And this is precisely what reveals the double-edged sword 3D really is: if you're not going to have 'stuff coming at ya' in 3D, then you'd have to ask yourself does it really need to be 3D to begin with? Furthermore, if stuff is flying off the screen at regular intervals, then it turns what should be entertainment derived from the drama of a movie into 'a waiting for the next object to be thrown' experience. Maybe that's why 3D is more suited to horror movies. Cameron obviously knows this and is so keen to avoid the 'gimmick' tag he avoids the temptation to hurl stuff at us.It could be argued that Avatar is both a sales pitch and a 'proof-of-concept' demonstration on the merits of 3D by Cameron to the general movie going audience. Perhaps the simplified nature of the story even adds credence to this notion. But he is undeniably sincere in his efforts. It's clear he believes so thoroughly in the 3D approach that he admirably avoids giving us a bloated and pretentious Star Wars Episode 1 rerun and settles for a straightforward adventure story instead. Avatar is superior even to his own Titanic. Only James Cameron could up the levels of cinematic spectacle in such a bombastic way.",9,2,4,30 December 2009
Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice," And The Result At Half-Time Is...
","We live in an age where a comic book movie is not classed as a true comic book movie unless it is brandishing a certain cookie-cutter label. Yes, folks, Marvel now own the franchise on comic book adaptations and - fan boys be damned – anything else is considered an aberration. More so, when said aberration is interpreted as trying to cash in on the Marvel cash cow and copy its highly successful business model. And that's what we have here: two of DC's most famous characters united in one movie and... the Marvel cinema contingent is having none of it.Batman V Superman was the target of negative publicity almost from day one and barely stood a chance: there were the accusations of this being rushed; that it was a force-fed 'shared universe' wannabe rather than the expected Man of Steel sequel; plus, of course, the 'Dawn of Justice' tag just seemed added on and rubbed everyone up the wrong way. Then you also had to contend with the fact that Man of Steel's ultra serious tone and dour color palette – of which this is a successor - contrasted sharply with the humour and shiny pastels of Marvel's fan boy friendly output and you had a recipe, if not for disaster, for the next closest thing to it. But taking all that into account, here is the shock: Batman V Superman is a very good and competent superhero vehicle. The set up that kicks everything off is very well done, with the events from Man of Steel's conclusion playing out again from the perspective of Bruce Wayne: one of his buildings is demolished in the Superman/Zod battle and his employees die. Thus, the roots for hatred are quickly sown and it is through this and a combination of hate inducing dreams that the growing resentment of Superman begins to grow. Bruce Wayne clearly has issues, let's not forget - he dresses up as a bat...As a superhero movie, ignore all the flack it has received - this really delivers. Rather than being the alleged rushed production most would have you believe, there is actually a lot of thought and ideas in it. It looks great – genuinely like a comic book - and has some great scenes: Bruce Wayne and Clark Kent trade sarcastic insults at a party, Batman and Superman have a wonderful initial confrontation where Superman tells Batman to consider his 'letting him off the hook' an 'Act of mercy' – it's effective because we know Superman could easily crush Batman at that point. Plus there's a dream sequence where we see Batman wearing goggles and wearing a coat – while still clad in the Batman outfit – genuinely thrilling to look at. Plus the scene where bystanders touch Superman as if he's some kind of messiah figure is realistic and plays true to life. And on top of all that, when Wonder Woman eventually does appear in the movie, boy is it one hell of a great entrance. The Batman suit here is a huge improvement over the one in the Nolan trilogy. Whereas that one seemed to be modeled on the late 80s/early 90s Tim Burton iteration of the character, the new suit is bulkier and looks all the better for it. And this suit too marks a welcome return of the shorter 'bat ears' compared to the long, protruding spikes of the Burton/Schumacher/Nolan interpretations. And then there's Batman himself. Whereas in the 'Dark Knight' trilogy, the Bale Batman used a lot of stealth to take down the bad guys, in this version the emphasis is on bulk and brute strength - you don't doubt for one moment that Batman couldn't take out a group of armed bad guys. He's a hulking guy who's prepared to smash heads without hesitation.Henry Cavill proves once again why he is the best Superman since Christopher Reeve, not only looking like the character, but also actually possessing the acting chops to play it so well. Ben Affleck is a big surprise in this. He pulls off a very effective Bruce Wayne/Batman and is very good in the role. So good in fact, his Batman comes across more as a masked force of nature who is all about brute strength, compared to the wiry/fast incarnation of the Christian Bale movies. And his Batman sounds better than the much-lampooned Bale version – a bit of a misstep in the Nolan trilogy. Jeremy Iron's Alfred has a lot more to do in this than previous Alfred's and comes across as a sarcastic, tough, possibly ex- military type. In his relationship to Bruce Wayne, we really believe they've been playing vigilante games for the past ten years.There are a couple of small missteps, though: Gal Gadot, while looking the part, lacks something in the delivery of her dialogue. The Wonder Woman outfit is hard to get right and looks kind of like Xenia: Warrior Princess. In addition to this, Jesse Eisenberg seems to be doing the exact opposite - overdoing it and trying to do a 'Heath Ledger as the Joker' in his rendition of the Lex Luthor character. Not terrible, by any means, but it could have been reigned in a bit. As for Aquaman, well, the jury is still out on that one...Still, it's got spectacle, big action, scale, depth and ideas in abundance (how would the public actually treat a real life superhero?) and says things you will not find in any of the Marvel movies in a month of Sundays. But the real fun here is the almost Shakespearean interactions (in tone) between Cavill and Affleck as the titular characters. There are very good scenes in here. Watch it and you will be impressed. If people are willing to cast aside the Marvel bias, they will see it's a better movie than the bile-filled hoards are willing to give it credit for.",9,8,13,5 April 2016
Star Wars: Episode VII - The Force Awakens," Not too long, long ago in a galaxy not too far, far away... two guys, Larry and JJ, were sitting in an office trying to write a script...
","JJ: I just can't crack the script, Larry. I can't. Suddenly there is a knock at the door: it's George Lucas. GEORGE: Hey, guys, I have an idea- JJ: Not now, Georgie boyGeorge Lucas exits. JJ: So what am I doing wrong here, Larry? LARRY: You're approaching it the wrong way, Jj. What I propose is we essentially rewrite the first movie Georgie boy made back in '77. JJ: He will be very annoyed if we do LARRY: Who cares – he lost his rights to be annoyed when he sold to Disney. Retooling the first movie is the way to go, I'm telling you. JJ: it's a revolutionary thought, Larry – do you think it can work? LARRY: Duh, yes! But we must update it for the 21st century, addressing all those aspects that annoyed people back in the day. For example, let's have another Luke Skywalker type character going on a hero's journey, but this time we will make her female.JJ: That will bring in the ladies! LARRY: Yes and we can really pander to them by having her remarking that no one needs to be holding her hand and pulling her out of danger! They will like that! And she can have latent Jedi powers JJ: Oh, my - toy sales will be doubled! LARRY: What's another common complaint? The lack of black people. The one black guy there is, well, he betrays Han Solo. So let's make the second major character in the movie black. Let's make him a Stormtrooper but a good one. He's basically gone rogue JJ: And that Poe Dameron guy we discussed – he can be our new Han Solo! LARRY: But didn't you say you want to bring Harrison back? JJ: Oh shoot Yeah you're right! I guess we can just have Poe disappear off the screen until Solo dies? People won't notice it cos they will be so caught up in the magic of Star Wars! What about a villain? LARRY: Easy – we will just conjure up another masked Darth Vader type. Might be a good idea if they want to make a prequel trilogy further down the line showing his origins. He will be part of a sinister movement like the EmpireJJ: I know - The First Order!!! LARRY: Brilliant! But where will they come from and how do they get to power – considering the evil has been vanquished at the end of Return of the Jedi? JJ: Larry, we don't need to explain all that – the magic of Star Wars, remember. People will be so caught up in the space battles they won't even question it. But we will need a poignant Obi Wan-type death sequence moment LARRY: Here's what we could do: make this masked villain Han Solo's son and and he could be the one who kills Solo! There's your poignant death scene just like the first one! JJ: That's astounding! I'm tearing up here right now just thinking about it! LARRY: Where exactly will Luke Skywalker fit into all this? JJ: We can have him being a hermit on an island at the end. The plot could be about a map inside a cute little R2D2 type robot and they're trying to find it.LARRY: Find the map and they find Luke Skywalker! Yes! But why does he leave a map to his location? JJ: Who cares – that's the magic of Star Wars! We can explain it in the next one! LARRY: And if you're putting another robot into this, what will we do with R2D2? JJ: Good question I guess we could put him asleep in the corner? As in on standby? LARRY: For the entire movie? JJ: Yeah, why not. People won't even question itLARRY: This First Order group is going to need another massive weapon... JJ: What about another Death Star-type thing? LARRY: Is that not a bit similar, though? JJ: Well, Georgie boy got away with using the Death Star twice, so surely we can too? But it can be much bigger. They could have actually hollowed out a planet this time. LARRY: Good idea. I still feel we need another black actor somewhere in the mix. But it must be a respected one. JJ: But who can they play? All the human roles are taken! LARRY: You're not thinking outside the box, Jj! What about having a brand new Yoda type character created through CGI? I think the story will need it, anyhow. He or she could play that? JJ: But what's the point in casting a respectable actor and then obscuring them by CGI? That makes no sense. LARRY: But an extra ethnic actor's name will look good in the cast list! JJ: You know what, you're right!LARRY: We've yet to sort out the Princess Leia character JJ: Stick her in some of the tactical scenes, doing the same stuff she did in the first trilogy. That'll take care of her. LARRY: And the whole movie could end in a climatic light-saber battle where the heroine fights the lead villain JJ: What will the ex-storm trooper be doing during all this? LARRY: He can get injured and be unconscious JJ: But shouldn't he pick up the light-saber too? LARRY: No – he's a Stormtrooper, silly! JJ: But if we go to all this trouble of putting in a black lead, people will complain that the black man still doesn't get to handle the Light-saber at the end of the movie LARRY: Sam Jackson did in the prequels JJ: But he was a Jedi! LARRY: Jj, you are right! Granted, it won't make any sense in the context of the story, but you're right! Let's have him pick up the light-saber and engage in battle! That's how he gets injured!JJ: I think we have the makings of a blockbuster, Larry!!! Let's go out and throw tennis balls at George to celebrate!",6,56,68,28 January 2016
Looper," Loopy
","The time travel genre is nothing new to movies. It's been done brilliantly (The Terminator/Back to the Future/12 Monkeys) and not so well (Timeline/Freejack/Time After Time). Even still, it's a story arc that offers so much potential for imaginative plots, filmmakers continue to come back to it again and again. Which is fine, providing it's done with some panache. Looper is yet another addition to that long traveled path to the time travel well and with a cool sounding premise, promises the same kind of dizzying concepts and brain muddling story arcs. At least that's what you expect. That it falls a bit short is really a surprise. And a shame.Upon release, critics were literally creaming themselves and foaming at the mouth over this movie. There simply wasn't enough descriptive expletives in the dictionary to summarize how amazing this movie was meant to be. It was also not uncommon to hear it being compared with such esteemed company as The Matrix and Inception. While it's not as good as the former, and not as clever as the latter, it's still an okay – if unremarkable - watch. Basically, take one-third Terminator, add a touch of 12 Monkeys and mix in some Carrie, and the result is Looper. And if that sounds a bit on the loopy side, that's because it is. In the future, there is time travel, but as it's banned, the only people using it are criminals. They send back ex-colleagues and other targets to be executed in the past by 'Loopers' – specialist executioners who incinerate the future garbage. Literally. So when a Looper called 'Joe' (Gordon Levitt – in makeup) gets his latest victim, he's in for a huge shock when he discovers it's himself. Or rather an older version of himself (Bruce Willis). And so begins a sometimes interesting, though occasionally confusing chase/hunt as the younger Joe tries to zero in on his older self.On the plus side, this has lots of really good ideas and interesting concepts in it: the younger version of Joe can send messages to his older self by cutting his instructions in his flesh; memories are simultaneously created and rendered vague by the actions of the younger iteration; and in one scene another older Looper - who escaped death earlier - starts to literally fall apart as his younger version systematically loses limbs though surgery performed by the bad guys who are financing all the Loopers. It's a scene that is slightly reminiscent of the Black Knight's demise in Monty Python and the Holy Grail, though much more grueling and shocking. Also, the makeup on Gordon Levitt is quite subtle and very effective: you actually believe both him and Bruce are the same person, albeit from different places in time. The future world looks unique enough without being completely alien and unfamiliar to us. So where does it all go wrong? About half way throughFor a movie with such an intriguing premise, promising every manner of head spinning older assassin against his younger self interactions, along with the customary shootouts and all the ensuing paradoxes resulting from traveling through time, this takes an abrupt turn that is so left-field you'll feel you stumbled into a different movie It's almost like writer-director Rian Johnson ran out of plot after breezing through the first half and said: 'Where else can I take this I know: a farm where  etc' This sudden turn is so out of sync, as to feel it doesn't belong in this movie. The clue is in one of the movie references mentioned above. It is a shame because it's fifty-per cent a very good movie.The cast are very good too: Gordon Levitt doe a really good job as a younger Bruce, while Bruce himself starts off sympathetic but gradually changes into something that is both ruthless and quite monstrous. Emily Blunt also does good work as gun-toting farm owner. So if they're all that good, then where does this go wrong? Obviously, this movie probably looked brilliant on paper, but after execution, is decidedly lacking. What you're expecting is not what you get – and not necessarily in a good way. You think you're going to get something dazzling - something with the intricacies of the brilliant Spanish time travel movie Timecrimes; but what you actually get – at least for half of it - could easily be a standalone, and pretty pedestrian horror movie. Again, you wonder: why wasn't somebody standing at Johnson's typewriter with a cattle prod, telling him to come up with something better?There's a lot of inconsistencies too: without being overly specific, stuff is done in this movie that makes no sense when you think about it after wards (heck, even the central premise makes no sense – surely the criminals would be using time travel for something more ambitious than to just bump people off?). Also, there is a central antagonist that is meant to play such a huge part in ruining older Joe's life, older Joe wants to hunt him down; yet we never actually get around to meeting this evil doer, only a different, more vulnerable version of him.Inconsistencies aside, you're left with a movie that somehow misses the mark despite the groundwork being laid for something really special. It's not as action packed and visionary as The Matrix, and not as clever as Inception. Maybe it's the type of movie that could get better on a re-watch – i.e., once you're familiar with the direction it ends up going, it might actually be possible to end up liking it for what it is – but as a first time viewing, the movie falls a bit flat and that's entirely a legacy of the final half. Want some advice? Go watch Timecrimes instead.",5,24,52,4 October 2012
Cloud Atlas," Clever... Ambitious... Entertaining... Epic...
","So here is a movie that has everything: gore, sci-fi, violence, drama, action and huge visual effects Yet it's very telling that when it came out in the US it flopped. Big-time. There were lots of walkouts because it was 'too hard to follow' for some and 'too boring' for others. For a generation weaned on endless Michael Bay helmed Transformers toys advertisements – sorry: movies - or regurgitated Spider-Man remakes/reboots/prequels/sequels/who-the-hell-cares, Cloud Atlas committed the ultimate sin: it was a movie that strayed from accepted convention, playing out multiple story lines that seemed unconnected over a huge ass-numbing running time. Punters voted the only way they knew how: with their pockets. Simply put, they stayed away in droves. And who could blame them? After all, it wasn't a reboot; it had no fighting robots and featured no vampires. However, this is exactly what makes the reception to the film all the more telling because - get this - Cloud Atlas is an exceptionally brilliant movie. Even more tellingly, it's (A) Easy to follow – the stories are surprisingly simplistic - and (B) not boring at all – the movie, in fact, moves at a very fast pace. It's very telling that even after you take those aspects into account, it still managed to go over US audiences' heads. So what was the problem, if any? It seems Cloud Atlas's biggest sin was it attempted to be bold, ambitious and original - probably not the kind of thing that would go down too well with an audience waiting for the latest Marvel rehash.Based on the novel by David Mitchell, Cloud Atlas tells the somewhat fanciful stories of people and events that while happening far apart from each other – mostly in other times - are intricately linked beyond time/space. It may sound unwieldy at first but it works: a lawyer (Jim Sturgess) on an ocean voyage is being slowly poisoned by his greedy doctor (a brilliant Tom Hanks); a sassy journalist (Halle Berry in top form) is investigating some nefarious matters concerning a nuclear plant; a revolt by robots (fabricants) in a futuristic Korea is being suppressed by authorities; some senior shenanigans goings-on at an old folks' home where a literary agent is sequestered; there's post- apocalyptic bloodletting in an age many centuries from now and finally, two composers war over a piece of music which they're claiming equal ownership of – the 'Cloud Atlas' sextet of the title. While this may sound like a storyline that is has too much going on for its own good with its 'everything but the kitchen sink thrown in' approach, it still works and there is a reason for it. If there is one thing that has been overlooked with Cloud Atlas it has to be the remarkable feat of editing. Surely, this has to be one of the best edited movies in years? Editor Alexander Berner has no fewer than six stories to juggle, which in lesser hands, could have been a huge 'throw it at the wall and see what sticks' mess, but in Berner's hands, the stories are inter-weaved and played out to perfection. There's a lot of ground to cover here. When juggling that amount of stories, the editor has to have the precision of a surgeon. It's a balancing act for sure: when do you cut away? When do you return to a story? When do you introduce a new story? When do you cut away from that and go to the next strand? And so on. It was a massive - nay, typical - oversight on behalf of the Academy that it wasn't even nominated.The cast are great too and play multiple roles across the vast layers of stories: Tom Hanks doing the best Irish?/British?/Scottish? accent this side of Dick Van Dyke and Halle Berry playing a white woman that resembles Madonna back in her 'Vogue' days; Jim Sturgess playing an Asian (with a distinct Neo-vibe from The Matrix) and Hugo Weaving playing a chilling demonic entity - there is no-one dragging their weight here; everyone is giving it one-hundred per cent. While some have sniffed at the notion of white people playing other races, it's important to point out that blacks and Asians also play whites in this movie. In fact, there's a strange fascination in trying to spot who's playing who in what era/role – kind of a generational 'Where's Wally?' if you will. This approach may have been budget-driven; after all, if you're going outside the so-called 'Hollywood system' to independently fund a movie, doesn't it make financial sense to have you're A-Listers playing more than one role? Why hire others to play them? Furthermore, it also indirectly benefits the whole mystical conceit that we are all linked through time – would the movie be as effective if different people were playing these roles? Who knows.Like the 'Tree of Life' before it, it's been favorably compared to another not exactly mainstream movie: '2001: A Space Odyssey'. Both mix story and theme strands, but while Tree of Life maybe be the more Kubrickian, it has to be said that on the whole, Cloud Atlas is the more successful of the two, expertly weaving and interweaving to perfection the multiple scenarios that are cross-cutting across the huge running time. This movie could easily be put in the 'don't make 'em like they used to' category: just when you thought that large, epic filmmaking was a relic of the past, here comes Cloud Atlas to shift your views: it's huge and dazzling entertainment, for sure, but the really telling thing is although it's juggling six story lines for almost three hours, it remains riveting the whole way. Brilliantly directed by Tom Tyker and the Wachowskis with a great musical score, Cloud Atlas is nothing short of a criminally underrated classic. Watch it and you will be transported, spellbound, touched and more importantly, entertained.",10,3,7,5 March 2013
