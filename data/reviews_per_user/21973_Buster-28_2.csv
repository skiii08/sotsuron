Alien 3," What a waste...
","The low point of the Alien series.  From the obvious continuity goofs while the opening credits are rolling to the ridiculous ending, this is just pure, stinky cinematic cheese.The xenomorphs deserved better than this pile of crap.",2,387,406,20 September 2002
The Green Mile," Easily the best American film of 1999.
","After reading the book, I could not wait for this film to arrive in the theaters.  I'm pleasantly surprised by how close the movie was to Stephen King's serial novel.  Subtle alterations for story flow, and the removal of a superfluous plotline used primarily in the novellas to tie them together do not detract from the original story in any way.One of the best casting jobs in recent memory, too.  Tom Hanks and Michael Clarke Duncan are near-certain Oscar nominees for this one.  Great ensemble acting all around.Don't go for the large Coke, though!  At 3hrs 8min *before trailers*, this one will severely test your bladder.  And your heart.",10,0,0,13 December 1999
