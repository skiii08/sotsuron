National Treasure: Book of Secrets," Though much like the first, 'Treasure' still shines.
","When I first saw National Treasure, I was blown away. With the complex puzzle solving and action violence, it was an unexpectedly refreshing movie from Disney. Such is the case of NT's sequel.Many critics complain that the storyline is almost exactly like the first film, but this is not entirely true. The film centers around finding a national treasure, but the motives, minor characters, and plot development are different. All the cast is back (except for villain Sean Bean, who's character is in prison), with the lovely additions of Ed Harris as the main villain and Oscar-winning Helen Mirren as Ben Gates' mother.Traveling from Paris to London to South Dakota, the three heroes look for clues to help clear the Gates' name of assisting in the Lincoln assassination.Overall, I thought the movie was very decent. The visual effects were amazing, and the acting job was adequate. You probably won't have to think a lot while you watch the film, but it's a fun time, so check it out.",8,1,5,21 December 2007
