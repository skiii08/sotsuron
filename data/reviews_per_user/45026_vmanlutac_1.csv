Come and See," This movie is very intense, you will taste that rotten soup..
","'Come and See', a film by Elem Klimov will take you on a emotional roller coaster. After seeing this film, people might have second thoughts about joining the military. Despite the lack of war action in this film, the film itself was emotionally action pack. What I mean is that you see and feel, mostly feel the war. You feel Florya's transformation from being this young excited child to being a tired soulless kid who aged right in front of your eyes in such a short period of time. I think the director captured the struggles and emotions of being in this war. It pretty much takes the life out of you. I felt the emotions as I was watching the film. A glimpse of the dead bodies stuck in my mind even as I write this and that scene was less than a second. The ringing sound that still lingers in my ear whenever I think about the scene that the Nazi bombs were falling and Florya temporary losing his hearing. The rotten soup that they were eating when they came back, I was able to taste it. I just feel that the director did such a great job to take the audience into battle to feel the suffering of the people and also to show different types of emotions throughout the movie. There are certain films you see and it just sticks with you.",8,1,1,12 June 2009
