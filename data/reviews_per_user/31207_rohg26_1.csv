Your Name.," Best romantic story of my life
","I have rated more than 1000 movie on IMDb. So, when I write that this is the best movie I have ever seen and the only movie that I wrote a review about, I mean it. I always had a deep fear that I will never meet my other half, and this movie perfect capture that feeling. There is a pain when you wake from a perfect dream and you realize that you will forget about this perfect world, that was your whole world for that few moments. I am afraid that I will cross the one without even saying hi to her. I will say this is a must watch movie for everyone. Good graphics, excellent story, and you are genuinely happy at the end of the movie.",10,23,33,3 June 2017
