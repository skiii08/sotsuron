The Blair Witch Project," To be really scared
","To fully appreciate this movie or to be really scared, I suggest spending a night in the Burketsville forest on your own. You may experience the 'real' fear especially listening to things bumping around in the dark. I am sure that in your next camping trip in the woods, this movie will  linger in your mind. Because of this, I think the maker(s) have achieved  their objective by instilling fear in your mind and will make you somehow feel uneasy especially at night inside your tent.",Null,0,0,10 December 1999
