The Perks of Being a Wallflower," A moving high-school narrative.. great story, music and performances!
","This is definitely one of the best movies of 2012! We all have seen mad capers on high school years and how they are the best years et al.. this movie shows a different side of the high school years..essentially through the eyes of a troubled freshman, Charlie, played to perfection by Logan. A misfit in the world of punk hipsters, pseudo intellectuals, sporty dudes, Charlie is accepted into the group of so-called 'misfits' and eventually comes on his own. This movie deals with the pangs of growing up, the pains of first love, the first kiss.. Emma Watson has really come on her own after the Harry Potter movies and delivers a sensitive performance. Erza Miller just gets better with each movie! The performances by the entire cast is superb. The music is surreal. The narrative is so engaging, your heart goes to all those kids and the problems each of them are dealing with..and you might shed a tear or two with them! As a high-school drama romance, Perks of being a Wallflower scores way above its contemporaries and others movies in this space.",9,1,2,12 January 2013
Life of Pi," A visual treat.. and a masterpiece story of survival against all odds!
","I watched this movie in Imax 3D yesterday! And boy, was I stunned! I haven't read the book so I will not compare the movie with the book. But, the movie in itself is pure pleasure for the senses, both external and internal. Its like a feast being laid out before your eyes, and eyes you wouldn't wanna blink! This is the best 3D movie so far (yes, even better than Avatar). The 3D and effects aside, I think its the story and the direction by Ang Lee that keeps the viewers engaged. And of course, the ferocious Royal Bengal Tiger, named Richard Parker. If only, animals could be awarded for their acting, the tiger would get the best actor award. The best scenes of the movie are the nighttime shots of the vast Pacific ocean and the underwater sequences. I didn't like the ending of the movie though, which made me doubt what I saw from the start. The spirituality aspect is delivered in plenty in the movie. Afterall, its a tale of survival against all odds. The movie is a winner because it delivers a simple tale which would have been so difficult to film in a manner which is not only beautiful but also humbling.",9,5,10,22 November 2012
