Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," Most Disappointing movie of 1999
","I saw this movie with 47 other Star Wars fans and not one of us left with a smile on our faces.  The original 3 movies worked for 2 reasons.  1) The effects were state of the art and light years ahead of everything else. 2) The stories were compelling and envolving.  None of this was true with 'The Phantom Menace'.  The effects were not state of the art nor were they or could they be light years ahead of the rest.  They were basically just standard fair for CG effect.Therefore the movie needed to rely on the story but unfortunately the story was boring and predictable and uncompelling.  Qui-Gon Jinn's (Liam Neeson) confidence may make sense for a Jedi but unfortunately it removed all the tension.  He's not worried so why should we be.  Therefore for example when they are traveling through the underwater tunnels about to be eaten by sea monsters we really don't care.  And then even if we had cared it's been done before.  1) in Empire, 2) in nearly every VR ride in the last 5 years.Of course another problem is the very nature of being a prequel.  We know who has to live and therefore we know who will always prevail. So much for tension.Then there are of course the technical/effects errors.  Star Wars is supposed to have the best effects yet the reflection mapping on the queen's ship is clearly substandard by even the standards of years ago.  Notice that the reflections don't match the environment.  Also, ships and people do not get reflected.  Another example would be the queen and her men scaling the castle on ropes.  The idea may have worked on paper but the execution on screen looked as bad as the old Batman TV series.Next there is the bad acting.  Liam Neeson seemed stiff as a board.  Maybe that's the way his character was supposed to be but either way it's bad acting or bad writing.  The kid clearly could not act.  And finally the single worst actor in the movie was Samuel L. Jackson.  I love him in most movies but in this movie it was not a character, Mace Windu, that I saw in the movie but Samuel L. Jackson.  He was so out of place it was as if Mickey Mouse made a guest appearance.  One didn't look at him and see 'Mace Windu' one saw him on screen and said 'Hey man, that's Samuel L. Jackon sitting next to Yoda.'Finally there is the luck.  Luck is a BAD thing in a movie.  It removes all skill, tension, sense of accomplishment from a scene.  Some 'luck' is okay. If you go back to the original 3 movies you will find that such luck plays little if no part whatsoever. The biggest 'luck' in the first series is convieniently finding the Ewoks just when you need help which is also one of the reasons why most people find the 3rd movie to be the weaker of the three.  Advice to Lucas, if you want to do one thing to help Episode 2, remove the luck.",2,0,1,19 May 1999
About Time," The hypocrtical speech at the end ruins a good movie
","This movie ruins itself in the last new minutes. I don't think it's a spoiler to say this movie is about a guy that can time travel. Even in the trailer we see him using it to pick up the girl of is dreams. Every time he makes a mistake with her he resets time to fix the mistake until it's the perfect date (this is shown in the trailer). In other words he has a power many of us wish we could have as well. But, in the last 2-3 minutes he gives a speech to the audience that he no longer time travels and just enjoys each moment as it comes. We're supposed to feel 'awe, wisdom'. Except he got to this nice situation he's in with the wife of his dreams precisely because he had these powers. If he didn't have them he'd not be in his idillic marriage we see him in as he gives this speech. That is such a spit in the face right at the end that hey, I used my powers to get my perfect relationship but you should just be happy with what you have. That's like a rich person telling a poor person money isn't everything. Sure, it's not, but if you're rich telling a poor person she doesn't need money try going without. In the end we get a rage inducing lecture from a person of privlege telling us to ignore the privlege.",3,0,0,20 April 2020

Star Wars: Episode IX - The Rise of Skywalker," So utterly aweful.
","Wow, I don't know where to start. I grew up with Star Wars. It's so sad to have seen it get progressively destroyed over all 8 movies since the original trilogy.This movie is arguably the worst of all 11 movies. It's a spectacle, some pretty pictures and fancy effects. But, it makes absolutely zero sense.It's become Lord of the Rings. There's a secret treasure they need to hunt down. The Sith base looks like a temple from Lord of the Rings which might have been okay if any of the previous 10 movies had shown anything resembling temples.1000s of Star Destroyers rise out of the dirt because ?? why?There's a secret space tunnel to the Sith planet. Did anyone point out the the writers planets are in 3D space?The Emperorer is so powerful why does he even need space ships, death stars!?!?1000s of Star Destroyers are all controlled by a single magical transmitter? WAT?The force can teleport physical matter across the universe. I expect in some future sequel they'll teleport people, ships, and whole planets. I mean why not?Jedi can now heal people's wounds instantly. WAT?!Oh, and remember in Episode 4 when they're in hyperspace and it takes time to get places (feels like hours as they have time to practice light sabers and play space chess). Well now any place they want to go is basically 5 to 10 minutes away. Get off the planet, instantly hyperspace to other destination, fly down. Kylo Ren figures out where Rey is. 15 minutes later his ship arrives at her location.¯\_(^_^)_/¯It's just all crap. Utter crap! There's probably some low budget movies with worse writing but it's hard to think of any.",2,17,27,1 April 2020
The Usual Suspects," The movie lies
","I wanted to like this movie but...**SPOILER**The movie lies to you.  In %99.99 percent of all movies, what you see on the screen is supposed to be what happened to the characters.  The only difference are things like point of view or missing details, for example you might know what happened from 3:00 to 4:00 and from 5:00 to 6:00 but not from 4:00 to 5:00.  Or you might know that Mr. A was there killing Mr.B but it's not until later you find that Mr.C was also there.In this movie though, several of the scenes are deliberate lies.  That breaks one of the cardinal rules of movie making.  Not that there are any rules but if the camera lies then there's basically no point in watching.It would have been a good movie for me, even with the twist, if all the scenes had been about reality and the twist brought all your missing knowledge together.  Instead, the twist just invalidated everything before it.  You end up not knowing if any scene in the entire movie has anything to do with reality whatsoever.Given that I honestly don't understand why people like this movie.  Try Memento, it doesn't lie.  Try Fight Club,  Try 6th Sense.  All much better movies because they are not full of camera lies.**END SPOILER**",1,115,213,17 March 2002
Hero," Simply the BEST!
","My jaw is still on the floor.  I will give you one caveat, if you can't deal with wire effects and the idea that people could be so skilled they could walk on water etc then don't go see this film.  Of course that said, why can most of the people like that except a flying guy (superman) , a guy that swings through cities on strings (spiderman), etc, etc..This is an awesome movie, for me a 10 out of 10.  I will be watching this many times.** SPOILER **One more comment, I saw some complaints here about the dream sequences for lack of a better word.  I'm curious, did you have the same complaint about The Usual Suspects which is almost 100% a dream sequence?",10,0,0,4 October 2003
Marriage Story," Not getting the hype
","This felt contrived to me.My guess is others see what they want. They're filling in missing blanks with their own experiences and projecting that into the movie. But, what's actually in the movie is not as deep or interesting as they're making it.This is a talk instead of show movie. We never really see what it was like, we only hear the stories after and the portraits of before (the letters) don't match up to the actions of the characters later.",6,0,1,28 June 2020
