Requiem for a Dream," An Incredibly Emotional Film That Will Stay With You For A Long Time
","I originally watched Requiem for a Dream because I really like Jared Leto. At first, I thought I was going to watch a touching movie about a son reconnecting with his mother. What I found was completely different.Story- 10/10 Following the 4 main characters stories was incredible. We saw things that many other films would simply shy away from. Absolutely brilliant writing from the original authorActing- 10/10 All 4 of the main characters were played phenomenally. Jennifer Connolly showed incredible diversity and emotional turmoil. Marlon Wayans was solid, portraying both a tough guy and an incredible weakness. Jared Leto expressed incredible pain. However the real star was Ellen Burstyn, who portrayed a whole range of emotions.Direction- 10/10 The use of split screens and implied drug use was a bold move from Darren Aronofsky, but one that paid off in the incredible story that he told.Feelings- 10/10 I was shaking for a good half hour after watching Requiem for a Dream. The emotions I felt during the climax would do a better job at ending drug abuse then any talk or booklet could.Overall- 10/10 Absolutely amazing filmmaking that is a must see, but I would avoid seeing it twice due to the sheer impact the film has.",10,0,1,27 May 2014
500 Days of Summer," A Very Solid Rom-Com
","A romantic comedy is generally thought of as a boring chick flick by most males, however (500) Days Of Summer is a rare exception, bringing an interesting story with some funny moments. Story- 8/10 While not an original or spectacular story, it was impressive. The non-linear element to the story telling was a refreshing change of pace to an extremely generic genre.Acting- 8/10 Joseph Gordon-Levitt is one of my favourite actors. His performance here was very strong, effectively showing great highs and lows, with everything in between. Zooey Deschanel was decent as Summer, however, nothing to write home about.Direction- 9/10 Marc Webb's film directorial debut was a great way to start. The non-linear storyline put emphasis on the 2 lead's relationship at different points.Feelings- 8/10 The movie had many great parts, that really made you feel happy for the couple, while simultaneously feeling slightly bad for them. The film did not leave any significant lasting feelings.Overall- 8.6/10 A great and refreshing Rom-Com that's non-linear story telling and humour helped to keep it in mind for a long time.",9,0,1,23 May 2014
Rush," Greatest movie I've seen
","Incredible movie, surprised that it was not nominated for a single Oscar.The film follows two separate stories following two very different people; James Hunt, played by Chris Hemsworth, and Niki Lauda, played by Daniel Br√ºhl.Both characters are casted with precision, bearing remarkable similarities to the real people, as well as providing a convincing performance.The race scenes are intense and adrenaline fueled, making you feel as if you were racing as well. I cannot find a single fault in this movie, 10/10",10,2,3,3 March 2014
X-Men: Days of Future Past," Best X-Men Movie Yet
","I have always enjoyed the X-Men. From TV shows to Movies, they have always interested me. However, X-Men: days of Future Past is the best one yet. Story- 9/10The Days of Future Past storyline could have been difficult arc to adapt into a movie, becoming confusing for casual moviegoers and non-comic readers. However, the story was handled with such delicacy that it was a marvel to watch. Acting- 9/10Like any superhero team-up movies, there is always going to be a big group of actors. All of the major characters were portrayed very well, with Wolverine (Hugh Jackman), both Magnetos (Michael Fassbender & Ian McKellen), both Professor Xs (James McAvoy & Patrick Stewart) and Mystique (Jennifer Lawrence) being extraordinary as always. However the 'acting' from Halle Berry as Storm wasn't up to scratch with the rest of the film. Direction- 9/10Bryan Singer's X-Men comeback was pretty good for the director of the first two impressive films. The hidden Xs throughout the film, the cutting between past and future and the overall scope helped show just how influential this man can be.Feelings- 10/10You know it is a good film when you are walking out of the cinema feeling great, like you just watched the best movie ever. Although this feeling fades, you know that you will want to watch it again. And that's what Days of Future Past does to youOverall- 9.4/10Walking out of the cinema, I was prepared to give a 10. Only thinking about the movie for a good 3 hours saw some minor faults in this film. It is an absolute must see and will rightfully be one of the biggest films of 2014",9,1,3,1 June 2014
Frozen," An Unexpectedly Great Animated Family Movie
","Honestly, I thought Frozen would be just another Tintin or Chicken Little, solid but not spectacular movies that are aimed at young children. However, what I found was anything but. Frozen is one of the best non-Pixar animated movies, and one I want to see again.Story- 9/10The story of Elsa and Anna is touching, beautiful, funny and enjoyable. I can't remember an animated film with a story this good since Toy Story 3.Acting- 9/10Well, voice acting is always harder to rate than screen acting. However I found the characters to have good voices that weren't annoying singers.Direction- 10/10Chris Buck and Jennifer Lee did amazing directing in Frozen, with beautiful scenes and character speech and movement.Stray ThoughtsThe singing was brilliant, one of a few Disney movies that have songs that are worth paying and/or downloading. The animation was impeccable and the humour was well thought out and genuinely funnyOverall- 9.7/10Absolutely loved the film, with many strong and memorable moments. I hope future Disney movies live up to this expectation.",8,8,15,20 May 2014
Her," A Beautifully constructed masterpiece that truly represents Sci-Fi
","Sci-Fi, while many people believe it to be about space, robots and aliens, is actually meant to represent a current or future fear. Her represents that perfectly, showing how much we are depending on machines.Story- 10/10 The story of Theodore and Samantha is a wonderful story of forbidden love. The way that Spike Jonze shows how much the two love each other highlights the beauty of smart machines, while also symbolising a path that our lives could take. It definitely deserved the Oscar. Acting- 9/10 Joaquin Phoenix was solid as Theodore, showing the lonely, the lusting and the loving sides of the character. However, the real star was Scarlett Johansson, who was so believable as Samantha. The emotion she showed with just a voice was incredible.Direction- 10/10 Spike Jonze's direction of the film was incredible. Viewers could see all sides of Theodore and his course through life. The visuals were stunning, with the city and the game springing to mind.Feelings- 10/10 Her makes viewers instantly sympathise with Theodore. This grows into feeling happy for the character, before feeling sad. The film also makes people feel a little nervous about our future and a path that follows the films main plot. Overall- 9.9/10 A near perfect movie, absolutely loved it. Scarlett Johansson's portrayal and Spike Jonze's writing and directing help to make Her one of my favourite movies from 2013 or all time.",10,0,2,21 May 2014
