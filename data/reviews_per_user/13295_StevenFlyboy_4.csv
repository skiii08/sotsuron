One Hundred and One Dalmatians," need help with a movie title
","I just got through watching the new 101 Dalmations DVD. I haven't seen this movie since I was a kid, watching it at the movie theater. It's a very cute movie but i'm confused about something. It wasn't what I remembered it to be. For some reason, I had pictured all these Dalmations inside a fire station. I could see all the red fire hats and all the dogs riding the fire engine. Obviously I must have this movie mixed up with something else. Does anybody out there remember the movie I'm describing? I could have sworn it was 101 Dalmations but there was nothing even remotely close to a fire station. What movie am I confusing this with?",10,3,4,4 March 2008
Hostel," Hard-hitting flick
","Hostel might be the most upsetting film I've ever seen. The director was amazed when the film received an R-rating instead of NC-17 and I agree. The film starts innocently enough, with two American backpackers living it up in Amsterdam with their Icelandic traveling buddy. But when their quest for sex and debauchery takes them to a mysterious hostel in a quiet Eastern European town, the guys find themselves in a world more disturbing than anything they could have imagined. The scenes of torture in this film are absolutely brutal and even fans of conventional horror may find themselves flinching and squirming at times. But just when you begin to think you're watching nothing more than a $4.5 million snuff film, the film changes direction and shifts into high gear. Hostel eschews the modern thriller convention of 'the more plot twists, the better' and simply goes right for the jugular and the gut. The film certainly hits both targets, and it doesn't let go until the very end. Famed Japanese horror director Takashi Miike makes a cameo appearance (which is not surprising as all his movies are full of graphically horrible scenes as does this movie). Quentin Tarantino is credited as an executive producer but I think a lot of up and coming new directors use his name as a spring-board to get their movies noticed. These days it seems that 'Quentin Tarantino presents' EVERYTHING. Anyway if you are a graphic horror movie fan and haven't seen this, you owe it to yourself to check it out. I just hope this doesn't turn out to be a 'fluke' on the part of Eli Roth. If he can make more movies as well as this one, he'll be a superstar eventually. This great movie doesn't end with just the credits either. It is capped off by the line, 'I get a lot of money for you...and that make you MY bitch!'",10,1,2,14 February 2008
Zombieland," Sorry Movie
","I just got through watching this and it was the most worthless waste of time I've ever spent. I remember seeing the commercial on TV when this movie came out. I didn't get suckered in to the theater to see this, but I gave into temptation and rented it on blu ray today and I hate that I did. This is one of those movies that after you see it, you've forgotten about it 5 minutes later. The movie was totally pointless and meaningless, kind of like Ghostbusters except with zombies. The movie starred some Jewish kid that nobody ever heard of, with veterans Bill Murray and Woody Harellson thrown in for posterity's sake (no doubt, just a marketing ploy to sell the movie to an older audience). To make things worse, Netflix never has it available and i went to Blockbuster 3 days in a row before I finally tracked down a copy. I'm almost downright MAD, this movie is so lame. I think if I hadn't spent so much time trying to find a blu-ray rental copy of it, I wouldn't have even watched the whole thing. At least it was only an hour and 22 minutes long, so I didn't really have to suffer THAT long. They should have thrown in a few Mutant Nija Turtles - it wouldn't have made much difference to the quality of the movie. Totally stupid and pointless. If I could give it less than 1 star, I would.",1,15,33,4 February 2010
War of the Worlds," Pitiful effort from Spielberg
","This movie sucks big time - especially if you have read the original book by H.G. Wells or even saw the original version of the movie, with Gene Barry. I don't buy into the notion that Martians came to Earth EONS ago to 'bury' those huge war machines. The whole idea of that is ludicrous. I mean, if the Martians DID come to earth years ago, why not just STAY and inhabit the earth? Why go to all that work and trouble to bury their war machines, then leave, then come back centuries later and have to go to all the trouble of destroying everybody and everything? It just doesn't make sense. The original story was better - they 'watched' us from Mars, planned an attack, then came, along with their machines, in 'cylinders', as the book states. That makes perfect sense. I believe if someone is going to remake a title, they should stick to the original story, or NAME IT SOMETHING ELSE.",1,1,2,24 April 2006
