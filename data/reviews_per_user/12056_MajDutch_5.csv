Borat: Cultural Learnings of America for Make Benefit Glorious Nation of Kazakhstan," ||l|l.l|.|l..l||l|l High Five ||l|l.l|.|l..l||l|l
","I really got interested in this movie when I personally got a chance to shake hands with Sacha Baron Cohen and get an autograph from him at the Toronto film festival when he showed up dressed up as Borat at my school's theatre where it was played.I saw it recently because I couldn't get a ticket for the first screening. Anyways, the theatre was jam packed, few people even showed up dressed up as 'Borats'. The movie is pure fun from the beginning to the end and full. I encourage everyone (check the local ratings) to see it on the big screen because it won't be fun watching on DVD; since it's not that kind of that can be enjoyed without public applause and laughs.Lastly, the jokes and humour in this one are simple and I bet you won't be left alone laughing.10/10.",Null,1,21,10 November 2006
Saw III," Bad, really really bad movie.
","Note: Serious spoilers, read at your own risk.This movie is simply bad. I doubt if the director of Saw 2 really accepted such a weak story line. Gore fans get everything they want in this one but things just doesn't support the plot at all.This movie has very low profiled jigsaw traps, I wonder if they have run out of ideas.Quick recap of the movie: John on death bed, Lynn kidnapped to save John, Real Amanda's past shown, Amanda's will tested by John, Jeff tested by John, Jeff suffering from his son's death, Amanda Jealous of Lynn and John's bonding, John's skull operated by Lynn, Amanda playing her own game, Jeff passes all tests, Amanda fails the test and killed by Jeff, Lynn killed by Amanda, Jeff kills John, Jeff fails the final test and would never see his daughter again.Don't waste your money on this one and watch 'Babel' or 'Grudge 2' or 'The Marine' instead",Null,2,7,27 October 2006
The Da Vinci Code," Don't waste your money & time.
","As an avid fan of the book like everybody else, I went to see the movie with a pack of 12 friends.The Acting: Tom Hanks is in one of my favorite actors but I have to say he does not suit for the role as 'Robert Langdon'. Paul Bettany in his role as 'Silas' is scary but not convincing. I first saw Audrey Tautou in 'Dirty pretty things', her role as 'Sophie Neveu' is superb.Movie: This movie is a shame on the name of the novel. Also, for those who haven't read the novel, they will find the movie way more confusing. I only suggest on one thing, please do not waste your time and money to go and watch it and enjoy reading the novel instead.",Null,5,12,19 May 2006
Kong: Skull Island," The best monster movies in years!
","This is probably the best monster movie I've seen it in years. IMHO it also tops the recent Godzilla movie. The final battle between Kong and Skull crawler is simply jaw dropping, and the cinematography not only in that scene but also in the entire movie is simply brilliant. Before going to the movie, please realize that you're going for a monster flick and it's not an Oscar calibre movie like Moonlight or La La Land, so critic it on that basis only. What this movie does better than Godzilla in my humble opinion is there is more human touch to it, once you see it you'll come to know what I'm talking about. Lastly, I was very pleased that this Kong movie wasn't like 1933 and the remakes. See it on the big screen with a bag of popcorn, trust me you won't be disappointed.",Null,17,35,13 March 2017
Alien: Covenant," Good movie but felt like a remake of 1979 Alien
","I'm a huge fan of Alien series. Really liked Prometheus, and was looking forward to this one ever since they decided to do it. Let me be honest, I saw the trailer, the prologue and other stuff they did before watching the movie, suffice to say I was pumped.The trailer and prologue threw me in another direction, and I was imagining a different kind of movie than it turned out to be, which for me was both a good and bad thing. Good in a way that one specific character turned out to be the opposite of what I had speculated from the trailer. Bad in a way that the movie started off differently but ultimately became a remake of the original Alien in my opinion. Katherine Waterston character 'Daniels' even wore similar clothes like Sigourney Weaver did in her role as Ellen Ripley in the predecessor. Michael Fassbender was brilliant in his dual role. As a whole the movie was good but not great, and it felt as if it was missing something which I can't put my finger on. I would give it solid 6 for acting and telling us more about Alien mythology.",Null,1,9,11 May 2017
