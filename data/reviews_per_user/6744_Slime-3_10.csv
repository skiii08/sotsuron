Alien 3," Better than Aliens but not as good as the original
","Where Alien was taught, claustrophobic, original and downbeat, the sequal was flashy, overheated, cliched and like a video game, this third installment falls between the two. Not as gripping or original (how could it be) as the first, not as dumbed down as the second. Not a bad film, generally and maybe underrated in the same way that Cameron's ALIENS was over rated? Weaver is once again rock solid as the tough but tragic Ripley, Charles Dance is sinister as the medical officer and Brian Glover sounds all wrong with his unfamiliar 'posh' accent (normally he played a stock line of dour or dim Yorkshireman with a strong north-of-england accent as in AMERICAN WEIRWOLF IN LONDON). The plot is rather weird, the prison planet-turned interstellar monestry/factory/powerstation isn't fully exploited or explained - neither is the reappearance of that damned Alien. But that aside it moves along quite well and the gore-fest of the previous movie is thankfully avoided with rather more suspence and a lot less explosions! Weaver with shaven head is virtually asexual and the plot line that a woman on this all-male station would cause havoc is a little hard to accept when the woman in question looks like a man, speaks and fights like a man and has all the sex appeal of a potato sack (sorry Sigourney but you look much better with long hair!)- but then these guys have been in prison a long while I suppose! I watched all three movies in sequence, for the first time, over the course of a week and while the series hardly goes from strength to strength in terms of basic quality , it does poses a certain drawing power, which no doubt explains the seemingly impossible appearence of a fourth installment, it's amazing what box office returns can produce! All in all not a classic movie, but much better than it's predecessor. Perhaps if Ridley Scott had remained at the helm of the entire series it would have been better?",Null,0,3,25 May 2003
The Others," Chilling supernatural jigsaw that really grabs the viewer
","One of the best chillers to emerge in the modern era, this moody and nerve shredding tale is well worth anyones time to watch. It combines an intricate story line with wonderful ensemble acting and intensly moody direction. The plot borrows some of it's neater twists from other recent Hollywood ventures into the supernatural and the visual style is very much that of Hitchcock (Kidman bears an uncanny visual resemblance to Grace Kelly in REAR WINDOW for instance)but the sheer strength of story and performances are what you will remember most. Kidman, playing an upper class English woman, with considerable conviction, only lets the cut glass accent slip slightly here and there. Her character's increasingly frantic situation draws out a career best performance with it's wide eyed incredulity and overbearing religeous zeal. The children she so desparately tries to protect (they have a lethal allergic sensitivity to daylight so live behind closed curtains)  are both superbly portrayed, a rare occurrence for such young English actors who, as a rule seldom behave as naturally on screen as their American contemporaries (and I say this as an Englishman born and bred). The curious trio of servants who arrive apparently looking for work at the beginning of the film never seem quite 'right' and this aspect is central to the story itself. In fact nothing seems to be quite as it should be, from the continual foggy weather to the piano that plays itself - or does it?. This clever, and subtle displacement of reality keeps the viewer guessing constantly throughout. Just what IS going on here? Of course it all becomes clear at the end in time honored style and you will either pat yourself on the back for having worked in out or kick yourself for not doing so.Either way it will be satisfying. In this respect it's a film that has combined the elements of both a classic whodunnit and a supernatural chiller with great success. Are the children really at risk from the light? Are the servants working to some hidden agenda? Has the lead character become divorced from reality behind those closed curtains, alone with her dependant children and her deep religious beliefs ? Just why did the previous staff walk out and what has happened to the father who went off to war and has yet to return?Perhaps the sense of time and place isn't quite achieved. The location is the island of Jersey, shortly after it's liberation from years of Nazi occupation but aside from a few references to power cuts and having to make do, this could be anywhere at almost anytime from the 1920's to the 1950's. The whole film is set in and around a large country house and the fog keeps out any picture postcard scenery, the staff don't have local accents or backgrounds that we are aware of and such things as fuel and food rationing are never even refered to, although they would have been very much a part of life at the time.Aside from that it's a rattling good yarn and the small cast are all convincing in their roles. The atmosphere is built up strongly from the very beginning and it's carefully paced to keep the viewer thinking all the time without becoming bored at any point, even if things do, by design develop very slowly throughout. Top marks to all concerned, a film that has lived up to it's word-of-mouth reputation.",Null,0,0,1 June 2002
A Bridge Too Far," Powerful epic anti-war war-film
","Director Richard Attenborough's remarkably faithful account of the real-life 'Operation Market Garden' a massive allied airborne and ground assault in late 1944.The campaign was to have ended the war - as always- 'by Christmas' and the film remains admirably close to the book on which it is based,as accurate in authentic detail as one is ever likely to find in a major Hollywood movie. Although this is a rousing helter-skelter action epic with the massive operation portrayed in a suitably massive way, there is a heavy anti-war undertone.It successfully portrays the vast waste of human life invvoled and offers no happy ending to justify the suffering.Few directors could handle such a film with the deftness and compassion that Attenbourough applies.His action scenes are breathtaking,while the casualty sequences are genuinely heart-rending. The cast is amazing,drawing together the top acting talent from Britain and the USA.Particularly strong performances include  Anthony Hopkins',Sean Connery &  Edward Fox as three of the British cammanders most closely caught up in the fighting.A degree of comic-relief is provided by the superb Elliot Gould who's brief appearance includes one of the film's most memorable moments.Michael Caine is laconic,Lawrence Olivier and Liv Ullman are compassion personified,Ryan O'Neal is intense and harassed and Gene Hackman gives one of his best perfomances of all time as a Polish General with grave misgivings about the whole thing. Dirk Bogard, as overall commander Gen.Browning is given the uncomfortable task of bringing humanity to the man who the film blames largely for the operations massive casualty count and he hits the right mark every time. This is truly a big BIG film,but it's full of down-to-earth human touches.How it compares to SAVING PRIVATE RYAN, I cannot say as I have yet to see that film. But certainly 'BRIDGE TOO FAR' rates as the best war film I have ever seen.",Null,0,1,16 February 1999
Alien," Over two decades later it still packs a real punch
","I fought shy of watching this film for years, having once seen the famous exploding chest scene and figured it was just a gore-fest! Twenty something years later I finally sat down to a major surpise. This is a superb movie. It's tense, claustrophobic, great too look at and packed with actors who can really act. As expected Ridley Scott's direction is visually arresting and unltra classy. The visual effects are surpisingly good and remind us that digital tinkering hasn't made that much difference really to good old model-work and process shots. Weaver is hard as nails as Ripley and Ian Holme acts ten times better here as the science officer than he managed in Lord of the Rings! John Hurt suffers wonderfully, but then he has made a career out of doing that in movies! All in all a great movie and the sequals, which I have yet to see, are next on my 'hit list'. For once, a classic movie that doesn't disappoint in any way or show it's age to bad effect.",Null,0,1,15 May 2003
Fargo," Not your average cops and robbers movie!
","Having heard of the movie and it's Oscar success, but never known anything about it, I watched with an unusual lack of preconception. I didn't really know any of the actors by name, although many I do recognise visually and that probably helped me keep an open mind. If Meryl Streep played the lead then somehow I would have expected something specific, but in this case what emerged from my TV was a real curiosity and a darkly charming one! It's an apparently serious film but laced with some wickedly dark comedy and tongue-in-cheek sequences. The characters are great,they have depth and human interest, even the silent hit man! The acting is naturalistic and deadpan, the casting is spot-on perfect. Despite several huge shocks along the way the fairly simple and uncomplicated plot moves quickly and effortlessly to a rather satisfactory conclusion.In many ways thats a surprise in itself and yet at no time is this a flashy or overboard piece of movie making,it's restrained and controlled, and all the better for it.And it's great entertainment. A credit to all involved. The opening shot of a car approaching in a near white-out sets up the snow-bound feel of the movie. The bleak, frozen wastes of Minnesota have a slightly other-worldy aura about them which adds immeasurabley to the overall atmosphere. The towns of Fargo and Brainard in winter seem like frontier outposts and the action which follows has a strong Western overtones. Frances McDormand is quite brilliant as the pregnant local police chief, Marge, with a home-life so prosaic and a delivery so earnest that you swear you must have met this woman somewhere yourself! Her ability to be funny without apparently trying is such a refreshing change from the 'Friends' style of comedy (say your line, pull a face and wait for the laugh before resuming)that now riddles Hollywood. And her dialogue is brilliantly written. The peculiarities of the Minnesota accent where it seems everyone has a Scandinavian name and says 'oh yahh' are played to the hilt (sorry to any residents reading this if I sell your state short, I'm from England so please forgive my lack of background knowledge). The scene in which Marge interviews two hookers amid a chorus of 'ohh yahhh's is hilarious. Only one thing in the script annoyed me, the constant and repeated reference by one character to another by their names. How many times did the Brainard cop, who discovers the initial dead bodies, call his chief 'Margie' ? In Every single line, virtually. That was the only flaw. In real life people on familiar everyday terms don't keep using each other's names in that way. It's a trick straight out of bad soap-opera where the idea is to make the viewer remember who everyone amid the cast of hundreds actually is. Otherwise this was a brilliantly written, acted, directed and photographed movie. If you havn't seen it, rest assured it's not at all what you are expecting!",9,0,0,29 July 2003
The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring," If you havn't read the book it's confused & shallow
","I speak having seen the movie but not read the book first and I guess my views on the film will be unpopular in many quarters.If you love the book and loved the film, don't read this because you won't agree with me! If you make a movie it should stand on it's own and not require any viewer to read the book first or resort to the 'official guide' in order to fill in gaping holes on the plot. Sadly this film, which is undoubtedly visually striking leaves those who have no prior knowledge confused, disappointed and frankly unlikly to watch the next episode.Well, it did me at any rate. I was quite prepared for a major motion picture experience, a STAR WARS or a CITIZEN KANE, if the PR was to be believed, but what I saw was a 3 hour special effects show that put visuals and violence above script, hype and expectation above substance and left me not really giving a damn about the bloody ring! The story seems far too long and involved to be condensed into even a 9 hour trilogy and the mass of characters and situations leave one feeling that the book's depth has merely been scratched at. There are huge and ridiculous gaps in the story (if the ring lay happily undiscovered for all those centuries,why then not just re-bury the thing?)which I assume the book fills but the movie does not. If I sound harsh it's because I was disappointed. I ended up believeing that the book probably is just too long to treat in this way and that many of the elements of a great movie, not least that the viewer can relate to or care about the lead character's fate and comprehend the motives and actions in some way seem to have been lost in order to charge on to the next big battle. As for some of the characters who pop up and then vanish, what for example was Cate Blanchet's character all about? It seemed like she was stepping onto the set of the wrong movie. What was the point of her being there at all apart from to add some glamour in a male dominated cast? She seemed to have no relation to the story at all! I suppose all will be revealed in Part 2 or maybe part 3, but frankly I don't care enough to sit through three more hours of pitched battles and hundreds of two-dimentional bit-part characters, let along three more after that! Aside from the structural and script problems, the acting was mostly quite good with Wood played Frodo very well and McKellern (with his mahogony voice) being well suited to Gandalf but some of the others were no more believeable than a TV cartoon and neither was most of the dialogue.Is this a great film? Not in my opinion. It may be based on a great book but you shouldn't need to read that book to make sence of the movie, that's just not good film making. Sorry! But thats how I saw it.",1,1,4,10 August 2002
Aliens," Good despite some seriously cliche characters
","Having watched the original ALIEN movie, for the fist time, shortly before catching this one,I was struck by how much more 'Hollywood' the second installment is. The cast of the original were a mixed bag of US and British actors and the quality of acting and characterisation was high. Here the emphasis is on special effects, explosions, guts, gore, destruction and cinematic thrills. The all American cast portray a host of rather predictable characters, often little more than comic book  cutouts. The 'bad-ass' Marine corps who seems to have wandered in from the set of an overblown Vietnam epic are exactly what you'd expect in this kind of movie and fit the accepted formula. The women fight harder than the men, the big mouth becomes a coward when the chips are down and the rookie commander struggles to keep them in order while undergoing his inevitable rite-off-passage. Yeah yeah,seen it all before...it's well done but riddled with cliques. The action is relentless and ultra violent. The original boasts a good deal more depth in it's story and a level of claustrophobic suspense that really scares the aundience before the blood and gore fest even begins. In many way ALIEN is more traditional science fiction, and thoughtfull, intelligent science fiction at that, but ALIENS is a big screen video game in which the main aim is for the main character to survive an orgy of killing going on all around her! There isn't the thought or imagination of the original movie. In many ways it's a classic sequel - it reuses the 'best bits' of the original - those remembered most vividly, but drops the vital background detail and characterisation that allowed those steller sequences to achieve their full impact.  Hats off to the special effects people and the art department for a truly vivid nightmare of a movie, but after watching the original , one can see the inherent flaws in this movie, despite it's undoubtedly high production values and box office success.",Null,0,0,21 May 2003
The Man Who Would Be King," No film is closer to perfect
","Take the story from a master like Kipling, give it to a director of classics like THE AFRICAN QUEEN, add a superb script that crackles with wit and cast two of the greatest modern day screen actors in roles that fit them like gloves. The result comes as near to the perfect action-adventure film as you will ever find. Kipling's rousing tale of two British soldiers in the days of high Empire keeps a tight hold of the viewer throughout. The twists of the tale are fascinating, the characters mesmerizing, the whole concept is so ingenious and full of potential that with such a team it simply cannot miss! Caine & Connery are superb together, oozing charisma and obviously enjoying themselves greatly as the two British NCOs.It's possible that neither has ever produced work to match what you will see here, it's wonderful to watch. Huston's direction is top drawer and the feeling of claustrophobic Indian market places and dusty railways stations is so strong it's a relief when the two heroes of the story make their ways into the wilderness to conquer a territory and 'be kings'. 'Billie Fish', the stranded Ghurka soldier that the pair encounter high in the mountains produces a fine characterisation by Jaffery . His eye-rolling expressions and comic timing are inch perfect in his performance throughout. Perfect too is Christopher Plummer as Kipling himself. Indeed so convincing is he as this most archetypal Englishman that one is reminded how Huston considered casting to be the most important element of his job - to paraphrase, if you find the right actor for the role, he needs no direction! I can't think of a film that more consistantly proves how right he was!Through battles, politics, greed and jealousy the two would-be kings gallop untill the final memorable explosive showdown. The last scene is perhaps the most effective and memorable of all. True pathos which tugs strongly at the heartstrings. A fitting end to a marvelous film.",10,127,154,17 May 1999
Raging Bull," Gruesomely effective tale of self destruction
","Scorsese directs, De Niro stars and Pesci supplies the hundred mile per hour dialogue. It's stylish, it's fast(despite it's running time), the high contrast black and white photography is both haunting and brutal, the acting is sometimes breathtakingly good and the use of a diverse score is inspired.Jake La Motta, the boxing 'bull' of the title, comes vividly to life on the screen in the person of De Niro. He's not a sympathetic character and neither the director nor De Niro pull any punches in telling us as much. This is a hard bitten, gritty movie with so much going for it and so much that works with no apparent effort.If there are flaws,they are few, maybe the sometimes over contrast-laden photography (which evokes the French new-wave style of the 60s)? That does get a little hard to watch on ocassion. Maybe the over-brutal and in fact over-exciting boxing scenes. We all know that middleweights do not throw so many rapid-fire punches round after round after round - they tend to hang to each other rather a lot after a few rounds and duck a lot of what's thrown at them. Here, La Motta, Suger Ray and the like all punch like rivetting guns and never miss, never duck and seldom take a breather. It's fantasy boxing, however well shot and however impressive it looks. It's like auto racing footage that used to be shown speeded up in Hollywood movies of yore. It always looks fake. Other than that, and the fact this is a grim tale with few redeeming moments of levity, it's a masterpiece in movie making. De Niro was surely seldom better and Pesci is like a firework display in full cry. Two scenes stand out above all others. One is the wonderful title sequence of the hooded La Motta warming up in the ring, in slow motion to a most beautiful piece of music (I can never remember it's title but it's heartbreakingly good!) with the background shrouded in smoke and floodlighting.Poetry. The other is a long single shot taking La Motta from the dressing room out through the corridors, into the auditorium and up into the ring with the quiet and reflection of back-stage suddenly errupting into a mad frenzy of cheering and popping flash guns. Terrific.All in all it's a hard film to actually enjoy but it's one that deserves all of it's endless admiration.",Null,1,2,21 June 2003
The Deer Hunter," Is that what all the fuss was about in 78?
","Is that it? Is that the famous Deer Hunter which provoked the studios into giving the same director a seemingly limitless budget for Heaven's Gate? What were they thinking? Perhaps from this distance in time it's hard for someone, already familiar with the string of very unpleasant Vietnam movies which followed, to appreciate the impact this movie made on first release. It must be said APOCALYPSE NOW , though earlier, stands up much better and is certainly superior in it's production values, direction and plot. Viewing THE DEER HUNTER in the 21st century , it seems like a rather dull character piece which just happens to involve a 'Nam subplot but could equally have been set in the 1940s and involve Iwo Jima or Anzio. It also features a massivly underedited wedding scene which goes on and on and on.OK for those interested in how it's done in a Russian Orthadox way, but very self indulgent of the director. In truth the wedding itself with endless dancing, and song adds almost nothing of remote importance to the movie. It colours the background, but that needed only a five minute sequence which, if edited well from the footage here, could have been quite visually arresting. It really seems a waste of what must be more than 30 minutes of film(maybe longer I wasn't counting, I was almost snoring).It also seems to ape THE GODFATHER in some respects. There are redeeming factors. Industrial Pensylvania with it's grim steel works and nightmare landscape, is well photographed, reminding us of the how the back streets of New York were presented in MIDNIGHT COWBOY. The glorious mountain country of the deer hunting scenes also looks great, but the plot is so dull,so predicatable and so heavily laced with allegories that it negates all those positive aspects.  DeNiro is good. Nothing more. Walken is probably better, but then his role is more interesting. Streep actually looks really good - we forget how attractive she looked at this time before sinking herself into character roles that didn't require such. She plays her role well but it's woefully underwritten. War movie cliches abound, even if we allow for the fact most Nam films since have drawn heavily on THE DEER HUNTER , I am sure most of these 'war is hell' cliches had been formed in Audi Murphy and John Wayne movies decades earlier.The whole point of the title is a scene so predictable you can almost count yourself into it at first viewing. There's also some truly clumsy use of stock news footage of Saigon at the end of the war. It looks like someone pasted this in having forgotton to shoot the scene, and not relaised untill the movie reached the editing room! Even if the budget was small there was no need for this in my view . None of the stock footage images are of any great dramatic importance and could easily have been dropped altogether. All in all I must say a huge disappointment for a movie I have waited 20 years to catch and which has such a high rating in the all-time-greats. Like LORD OF THE RINGS it's a monument to hype over content.",4,8,15,7 June 2003
