Blade Runner 2049," Boring - Contains Spoilers (right at the end sort of)
","After the disappointment of the force rebooted this was the only other film this year I was actually waiting to see so it was with high hopes and fingers crossed that I went to the cinema today to watch this movie. Sadly it would seem I had my second movie disappointment of the year.The plot for this movie wanders around and doubles back trying to make you think one thing and then another slowly and drearily getting to the only point it has to make right at the very end. The pacing is slow and tedious and not a patch on the original movie with non of the originals edge.As for the aesthetic in places it almost looks like the first movie but misses and then in others its miles away. Very few of the scenes looked like they could of been placed in the original most looked like wannabee copies and somehow just fail to come upto the original.It's not the fault of the actors it just doesn't feel like they were given much to work with. The over concept is a great idea however the execution is sadly lacking.The whole movie felt lame and drawn out like 30 mins of story spread over 163 mins of film, there were loads of long meandering slow scenes and should of ended up on the cutting room floor they just destroyed the pacing. At one point I actually closed my eyes and thought I might just fall asleep only to hear snoring from another viewer behind me which made me laugh.Goslings and Fords performances were great considering how little they had to work with and Jared Leto felt menacing but very very under utilised. Ana de Armas is stunning and played her part well as were/did Mackenzie Davis and Sylvia Hoeks (there's no way you'd want to be on the wrong side of Luv).Overall the movie felt too long, too slow and not enough story which is a shame as the plot seemed almost decent.SPOILERLY BIT Making K/Joe think he was the one and then it turning out not to be him was just lame and not done very well at all.This movie isn't worth paying to see wait until it's on your favourite streaming service.Just a note to the movie industry who claim many many things are killing the movie business I think the one thing that actually is killing the movie business is lack of originality/reboots/remakes and just general tardiness. I've not seen a good original movie for ages or a sequel that does justice to the original movie/series.",5,33,72,6 October 2017
Point Break," Terrible
","I don't write reviews very often for me to write a review of film usually it needs to be exceptionally good or exceptionally bad, sadly this movie falls into category of the latter its exceptionally bad. The original 1991 version of this movie is an absolute classic great acting great story phenomenal cast really well put together this version is none of those things it's really bland and just a weak excuse of showing off extreme sports in a really bad light if you really want to watch a great movie go and watch the original its head and shoulders above this, this is a 3 at best even if the original had never been made and this would still be a 3. The characters are weak and the story is badly written coupled with the weak acting and an over reliance on not very interesting extreme sports this movie was always doomed to fail. The original is a classic heist movie this one is a lame advert for extreme sports. There is very little plot in between the all the crap I keep expecting to see red bull adverts everywhere lame lame lame",3,6,7,16 April 2016
Cloverfield," Could of been good
","How this movie is rated as high as it is bemuses me.It could of and possibly should of been good but it isn't.The camcorder view is just rubbish I hate movies where you can't see whats going on this is a terrible invasion/monster movie the characters are all dull and boring you have no interest in any of them and you don't care when one of themdies, there's not enough detail about anything in this movie tbh the whole plot is weak and uninteresting. Please can I have 90 mins of my life back this is just utter rubbish.I'm losing the will to live trying to write 10 lines about how bad this is.Sigh",1,4,7,16 July 2011
Star Wars: Episode IX - The Rise of Skywalker," JJ Facepalm
","Yet again JJ Abrams shows he's a one trick pony and just doesn't get Star Wars at all. This movie is a clichÃ© of how not to do it, how did Disney employ two such talentless PERSONS (you can replace that with whatever you want) as JJ Abram and Ryan Johnson between them they have destroyed the Star Wars saga.Rise of the Sky Walker news flash *SPOILER* Ray is a Palpatine, calling yourself a Skywalker at the end doesn't make you one. All the Skywalkers are dead good job JJ nice one. They have managed to miss step in every way with the franchise with episode 7 (REBOOT), 8 (Made by a guy that didn't want to continue the Skywalker Saga and hadn't even watched all the movies) and 9 (DOESNT HAVEA CLUE) they just don't get Star Wars at all. JJ just throws in all the old characters because hey the fans liked them in episodes 4,5 and 6 they'll love it if we bring them all back I don't even know what to say about that. We wanted the story to move forwards, to new thing, to a completion and you gave us one by killing the story stone dead.I have a huge number of things I wanted to go through in this review but after watching the last movie everything we hoped for has been trashed so I'm actually lost the will it's over and dead and not in a good way.Gareth Edwards did a great job with Rogue One and for my money Ron Howard did a great job with Solo I would love Disney to actually give us more Solo with Howard at the helm. I know a lot of the Star Wars community didn't like Solo because it didn't have Jedi in it and the timelines are a bit (by a bit I mean VERY) janky but that was a perfect movie for the setup at the end.The warning signs were there it started with Lost wtf was that show about anyway I lost the will to live after season 3. If anyone at Disney had actually watched that show they would of know not to give this franchise to the reboot monkey Abrams. The guy seriously shows a lack of imagination his story telling is miserable the only thing left in the universe that would make sense was if we found out he advised games of thrones on the scripts for season 8. I may at sometime when I've calmed down and actually add all the things wrong with Episode 9 and theres a LOT of them.",1,31,49,21 April 2020
Divergent," Hmmm I used to trust IMDb scores.
",This movie is the hunger games which I can totally see why they made it because THG made a bazillion dollars god knows how as it's total crap and since this movie is designed squarely at that market it's pretty close to THG and such is pretty crap itself. I thought this was a stand alone movie but checking IMDb they are making 2 3 and 4 in the same ilk as THG /facepalm.I also have another issue with the rating on this movie I have just read through loads and loads of user reviews on IMDb for this and there are 3 6's maybe 2 or 3 over 6 and hundreds of 3 or less scores but the score on IMDb is a 7.1????? how does that work???? 95% of the reviews for this movie are terrible and rate it really low but it's getting a 7.1???? Anyway it just shows how strong the teenage girl market is because this is squarely where this film is targeted. The rot set in with twilight then the hunger games jumped in behind and now this. Well I'm this is going to make a lot of rich studio execs even richer GUYS YOU HAVE MORE MONEY THAT YOU CAN SPEND STOP MAKING THIS CRAP!!!!,3,1,1,31 July 2014
The Hobbit: The Desolation of Smaug," b O r I n G
",There really aren't three films in this book they're really dragging this out now. And wait lets do a George Lucus and put characters from the original trilogy who aren't in this book into the film. Yeah that'll work oh sh*t no it doesn't. Same voices on the spiders as were on the trolls in the first film that we the same voices in return of the king yawn yawn yawn the first trilogy was watchable once but doesn't have any repeat appeal and so far the telling of this trilogy is drawn like butter scrapped over too much bread (see what I did there). Making this book into three films is just out and out greed movie studios are going the same way as game companies producing the same old sh*t over and over and hoping no ones paying attention. WERE GETTING BORED OF YOU CHEATING SOB's and soon we will start to vote with out money!!!! (Sadly the film companies know as well as I do that the masses out there will keep coming back for more no matter what crap they produce. I hope people come to their collective senses and stop going the movie theatres to see this mundane crap,3,8,13,29 December 2013
Star Wars: Episode VIII - The Last Jedi," Starwars died with the release of this movie
","WARNING SPOILERS!!!!If this were any other movie it would be a mediocre movie as a star wars movie this awful it has effectively killed off the whole storyline one movie too early. The script from the start was weak as was the plot. The characters kept saying weird things out of character for a star wars movie they seemed to like the word spark a lot. It looked like a star wars movie, it sounded like a star wars movie it was actually pretty lame and I will join the many legion of fans that have been gutted by this and the force rebooted. We waited 40 years to find out what happened with the Skywalker saga only to be spoon fed this load of tosh.They tried to patch up holes in the first movie with one liners, you were upset Kylo how did you let a girl with no light sabre training beat you in the last movie blah blah and throw in comedy one liners all over the place and cute little critters to merchandise no doubt.The script is so bad and the story so off the mark that you can't help thinking that whoever wrote it has a) never watched star wars b) doesn't know the story of star wars and c) is an idiotDo Disney even know that there's another movie left they've killed everyone off. Snoke the big bad get's cut in two by Kylo with hardly a thought and the rebels sorry resistance (to me they will ALWAYS be the rebel alliance but not to Disney) are down to their last 12 men. Pity Po has survived he's a very very lame ass character they have jammed him in at the expense of Fin and Reys story they should of stuck to their guns and killed him off in the first movie, but no of all the idiot,s pointless lame characters to make it through Po's still there. Luke doesn't teach Rey anything other than the big hole is evil she goes in anyway and then Luke vanishes like Mark Hamill with a huge pay check off to the Bahamas. Disney has turned this into a weak poorly written load of junk just like the game Batttle Front 2 they've just put out.IMO if you're new to this franchise watch Rogue one then episodes 4 5 and 6 and tbh maybe even episode 1 and then skip the rest.That's me done with star wars no more games or movies gg Disney a 40 yeah fan who doesn't want to watch anymore of your train wrecks.",2,18,27,17 December 2017
12 Years a Slave," Overrated
","Whilst the story of the main protagonist is a tragic one this story far from lives up to it's billing. You can tell the Oscar circus will soon be in town. Yes this is a tragic and appalling story but no more so than that of any other slave. A free man taken as a slave! Well forgive me but weren't all the slaves free men before they were taken? There have been many many movies on slavery over the years and imo this is not one of the best but the Oscar spin machine is in full overdrive banging on about this movie. However that being said I have come to understand that my views quite often differ from the general populous but this film is long and boring and doesn't tell a particularly gripping or entertaining story, far from conveying the horror of slavery this portrayal seems to show the protagonist living a life far better than other slaves that have had their stories told. This year Hollywood seems to have produced the most drawn out boring movies for decades. The desolation of Snores is another one on the list. 1 BOOK 1 FILM JACKSON YOU'VE RUINED IT!!!. And the hunger games wth again more drudgery than I care to endure ever again. This movie is OK at best.",1,7,15,9 January 2014
Prometheus," disappointing
","After reading all of the other reviews I'm not going to add in detail to the exhaustive list of plot foibles of which there are many. Whilst this movie would be passable in it's own right I am saddened by the way it's linked into the aliens universe. The dead host alien in Aliens turns out to just be a big human dude in a suit which clearly wasn't the case in Aliens and I might be mistaken but didn't they use it's skull in one of the predator movies? And Aliens are created from this big humans biological weaponry??? Really???? Adding an alien in the last 5 seconds was a pretty weak link. The visuals were stunning the plot was poor the characters were as in both the two AVP movies bland and alien fodder non of which do you empathise with at any point. Fass was awesome and Theron was great and is stunning as always but most of the characters couldn't die fast enough the 3d (I have to confess this was my first 3d movie in a theatre) was stunning inside the ship everything popped out everywhere else it felt a bit lack luster and for me the story just detracted from the Aliens universe. As a HUGE aliens fan as a stand alone movie this is worth a look as a aliens movie it's not good.Alien - awesome Aliens - AWESOME Alien 3 - it grows on you Alien 4 - tat a poor rip off of 2 the only thing worth watching is Ripleys basketball shot Predator - awesome Predator 2 - OK Avp - complete tat Avp2 - more tat Predators - great movie Promethues - so so, although the visuals are very slick",6,6,10,23 June 2012
Star Wars: Episode VII - The Force Awakens," It's a NEW HOPE again!!!! (Contains Spoilers)
","I'm a huge Star Wars fan and I went to see the new movie last night and I was loving it right up until the end, an X-Wing trench run to a vulnerable spot on the death sorry sunkiller base as soon as this happened I was instantly snapped out of the movie and right away it made me look at the movie and yeah JJ has does in Star Wars exactly what he did in Star Trek and rebooted it telling the same story. Don't get me wrong I Love the Trek reboots but I was expecting more from Star Wars. Think I'm wrong? Lets take a look OK starts with Rey left alone on a desert planet (Luke on Tatooine) then BB2 stranded on the same planet (R2D2) with sagely advise being given out by Max von Sydow's character (Obi-Wan), with the secret plans being hidden inside BB8 who has to get back to Lea and this just the beginning we even jam in a new cantina scene the movie carries on like this throughout and that for me just makes foe lazy lazy storytelling by JJ. The new Han Solo role seems to have been divided between Fin and Po I could go on for the whole movie (totally untrained Rey can do Jedi mind control THESE AREN'T THE DROIDS YOU'RE LOOKING FOR. A few more things the music and sound effects weren't up to the mark either the Star Wars music is a classic as soon as you hear it you heart speeds up but in the new movie they have a softened down version which is weak and doesn't have the same effect I found it very underwhelming and lack lust even with the Falcon flying around. Kylo-Ren also is about as menacing as two day old semolina pudding the scene where he kills Han to push himself away from the light should of been dark and menacing instead it was totally underwhelming for such a significant event it was just badly acted tbh KR throughout the who movie was weak reminding me CH in ep's 2 & 3. Oh and another waist of space Captain Phasma what a non-sense waist of time character she is. I think once fans get over the hype of a new Star Wars film this one will slot in as the 4th or 5th best yes even for my money the Phantom Menace wasn't bad.I've just been watching videos on youtube about making studio size model kits and I got so excited for Star Wars I love it. Then I think about this movie and I get sad this movie sucks the more you watch it. I hope 8 is better please please please don't suck",4,5,15,17 December 2015
Alien: Covenant," Bland and boring
",I have been a huge Alien/Aliens fan since the first film came out. The first movie was a great movie there are still parts of it that make me jump and I have seen it many times. The only movie to surpass Alien was Cameron's Aliens.This movie is a desperate attempt to give some credibility to Prometheus which was plot disaster of a movie.This movie has none of the tension of Alien which set the gold standard in this genre for horror/jump scare movies and it misses the pace of and action of Aliens which again is a gold standard for an action/horror movies.Out of all the Aliens movies I would consider Aliens to be the best then Alien and I would give all of the rest a miss including Prometheus and this junk it's pretty boring. Ridley is trying to re-establish himself as the owner and king of this franchise but he's fallen short again. Prometheus was a feast for the eyes with the weakest plot you could imagine. This movie tries to prop up that pile of junk and suffers for it. SPOILER David being the big villain of the movie was just weak. I'd watch Alien then Aliens and then move on.Skip this movie,3,2,4,5 July 2017
