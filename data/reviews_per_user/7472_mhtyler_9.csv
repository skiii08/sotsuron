Frost_Nixon," Nixon as viewed from the Far Left
","Slow moving account of the drama behind and in front of the cameras surrounding the Nixon Frost interviews. Interesting at times for the outstanding performance by Langella, but otherwise hampered by a script that is so left wing it was apparently written by moveon.org.The film leaves you with the impression that Frost won and Nixon lost, but in fact both men profited. Nixon's effort at rehabilitation largely succeeded, as both the Washington Post, and Newsweek acknowledged.While his record was tarnished, he finished his life as a successful author, and elder statesman.If your a liberal, all of the above is sauce for the goose, but if you're a conservative you're left with a slow moving film that for the sake of drama isn't always as honest as it ought to be.",6,5,11,1 February 2009
Star Trek," Makes Independence day look smart
","For Star Trek fans ONLY. This movie is as visually stunning as it is stupid. Why? Simple: Time travel plots usually have holes large enough to drive a star ship through. This movie proves it.In this case you have a planet blow up, Romulus. A Romulan captain with a very low IQ and a very powerful ship is plunged backward in time. He decides to kill everyone for destroying his planet. The problem: he's in the past so his planet isn't blown up yet. You'd think he'd want to phone home, warn the folks, maybe even contact the government and tell them what's on the menu in a century or so...but no: This guy has only one mission, to wait 25 years for Spock to show up, and then start the killing everyone in revenge for...uh...what hasn't actually happened. Even Spock seems to have forgotten that since Romulus isn't blown up yet, maybe he could have a chat, explain it, and everyone could go home happy. Nope...Spock has lost his marbles too. So now we have alternate reality Star Trek where EVERYTHING you've ever watched before now never happened even within the framework of fiction! What is worse, pompous scenery chewing Kirk has now become Kirk the young punk. Spock, sucks face in elevators, and Scotty doesn't wash. What a waste!",3,3,7,9 May 2009
Cloverfield," big monster, shaky camera, stupid characters
","Said most of this in the summary... There is a big monster loose in the city. Our protagonists are determined to learn nothing about what is going on, put themselves into harms way, and film their last adventure with a video camera that only points to where the action isn't.The characters are trying to die, they richly deserve to die, and its only a shame that they don't do it more quickly and make this a film short.I wish we could at least have had one military character to tell us what is going on, like that general in 'War of the Worlds' who says, 'guns, bombs, tanks, they're like toys against those things!' But no, the military must trudge on with no more direction than this film has.",2,2,2,20 August 2012
28 Days Later...," Zombie's are smarter than People: Film at Eleven
","This movie proves over and over again, that people are doomed not because they're evil, but because they are cretins.The movie starts with the creation of a zombie threat that leaves small handfuls of people trying to find their way to safety.Instead of putting the characters in the sort of jeopardy inherent to the situation, they behave with the sort of reckless abandon that you'd hardly see in normal London let alone a zombie zone.Time and again a character chooses to wander off on their own, not because the plot demands it, but because the body count demands it.A sort of artsy strobe effect is used during violent scenes that at first highlights the horror, and eventually annoys the eyes.If you want to see a movie that avoids most of the above pitfalls, see George Romero's, 'Dawn of the Dead'.  Give this a pass!",Null,2,2,10 July 2003
Ex Machina," Well, done but its not a new story...but then what is...
","Here be spoilers....If you don't recognize the plot, and I've read other reviews saying it came from this or that, Well, I can tell you where it comes from in one word, 'Frankenstein'.That's all you need to know. It has a few weak points about it, one of them being that its a bit too talky, and another is that the genius scientist has some rather alarming blind spots that will quickly occur to the film goer, such as the power failures.The ending from the original story is essentially unchanged too, although we don't know the final outcome for the human hero other than the AI certainly seems convinced he'll be toast.I don't quite have the same fears of AI that some scientists like Hawking seem to, but then its possible they have more reason than I to feel threatened. Maybe once we have AI, plots and scripts will improve! Bottom line, I give this an 8; it was a fun popcorn movie that could have used a bit more action.",8,1,7,25 April 2015
Children of Men," Confused garbage
","The setup: No children have been born for 18 years, and for some reason this causes almost the entire world to crumble except for Britain, which since it is already a welfare state, has hardly noticed any changes.However, inundated with refugees, the country becomes an even more repressive place than before, which strikes me as odd, because I always understood they were a democratic society.This is dreadful mish-mash of a movie is filled with only two kinds of people, the unsympathetic, and the truly despicable. This movie that actually had me rooting for the repressive government.If this is a 'thinking man's movie', then thinking men are confused, depressed, and can only see gray.",1,14,22,21 August 2008
War of the Worlds," Earth dumb, Mars dumber
","Cardboard characters, artificial conflict, big effects, and swiss-cheese plotting make this just the sort of fun you're looking for, if you're 7 years old or younger.If you thought Independence Day was good sci-fi, you might just enjoy this remake of the 1953 classic sans any intelligent life either here or from Mars.Tim Robbins, has a quirky role as self described survivor with a self destructive streak, which btw makes as much sense as any other part of the movie.Gene Barry has a small non-speaking part. Apparently they were afraid if he talked, the movie might be mistaken as a think piece. They needn't have worried.",1,6,11,22 November 2005
Love Actually," Love is everywhere (Even in the 'Evil American Empire')
","'Love Actually' is a fun, witty, and clever film that hits its target more than it misses, and as a comedy, that is enough to make it exceptional.The film starts with the extraordinary statement by Hugh Grant that cell phone calls from the 9/11 planes show how much love is in the world.Well, citing terrified calls from people being murdered as an example of the fullness of love, certainly shows the European perspective is a sunny one.Throughout the film though, it is the love-lorn Prime Minister (Hugh Grant) that repeatedly tests our suspension of disbelief, such as when he fixates on a lowly poddy-mouthed secretary, and conducts a personal door to door search for her on Christmas Eve.The film is generally upbeat, although we eventually discover that 'love actually' peters out in middle age to be replaced by deception and dejection. This is quickly swept under the carpet though since all of the young people end up happy.The 'stand up and cheer' moment in the film comes fairly early on, when the Prime Minister confronts the slimy-American President (is that superfluous?) in a press conference.The happy moment for all Europeans is not dimmed by the fact that the P.M. was incapable of any disagreement with the President until the latter moved in on his biscuit-and-tea Bimbo. Still, if you feel politically impotent I guess you take your licks where you can get them.American's can take heart from the fact that their women (particularly ones with comic-book accents) are apparently useful as sex-toys for starved British men, which certainly redefines the 'special relationship'.In summary, the film is funny, moves quickly, and lets you hate America if you're in the mood.",6,1,6,29 July 2005
Dark Shadows," A bit too much Eva, and not enough Helena and Chloe, but well done
","I give this movie an 8, but if I could rate more discreetly I'd give it a 7.8...just under that. When I viewed the trailers, and I must have viewed nearly all of them and saw the TV adverts I was afraid that Burton and Depp had jumped the shark with too much comedy. They didn't, although there are a few scenes that go over the top. In general the tone is respectful to the original soap while managing to poke a bit of fun at itself.They've taken some license with the original plot, but not in a way that detracts I think. Certainly, the movie successfully explores and exploits the sudden jump from 18th century to the 20th in a way that the original never thought to.It moves a bit slowly at times, and there are some actors that are underused. Chloe Moritz and Helena Bohnam Carter could have been used more effectively even without expanding their parts, but by simply making them more integral to the plot.I don't think I'm spoiling anything by mentioning the well advertised cameos of the original stars, but I will say that their appearance was much too brief...fleeting even.On balance, if the movie performs well and they decide to make a sequel, I'm on board.",8,4,12,12 May 2012
