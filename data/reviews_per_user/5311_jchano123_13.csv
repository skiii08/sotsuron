Iron Man 3," Inconsequential by-the-numbers superhero movie
","Wanted to give this 6/10, but couldn't. So much of this felt inconsequential in that I know all these characters are in the other movies, so I have no reason to be worried if they'll live or die. A lot of this felt like it was throwing everything at me in the hopes that I'll be entertained. There were so many explosions and spectacle, way too much to be beneficial to the narrative. So much of the character conflict relies on callback to The Avengers movie as well- it's called Iron Man 3, not Avengers 2. Additionally, Downey Jr. gave a pretty shallow performance of an anxiety attack, it felt really out of touch.
I will say that the end fight was impressive, but it was still difficult to suspend my disbelief entirely - Tony's falling and getting beat up so much but he doesn't seem very bruised at all.
The post credits scene was nonsensical- you're telling me that a super rich genius wouldn't hire an actual certified therapist to talk through his anxiety? Really?
Overall, a very by-the-numbers superhero movie that didn't seem to have much of a purpose other than concluding the Iron Man arc, which didn't need to be 130 minutes long.",5,1,4,9 May 2019
It," Painfully boring and cheesy
","Well this was extremely disappointing. It takes so long for anything circumstantial to happen and gets boring really fast. Nothing about this was remotely scary to me, but was rather obnoxiously cheesy and unintentionally funny. There were so many jump scares in this and none of them worked; they just added to the cheese. The acting was either really bad or just OK. No one stood out. If the characters are children, why not get actually good child actors? One of the first things I noticed is that they completely ripped off the high school long shot sequence from Donnie Darko, which just goes to show how unoriginal this was. It didn't even try. The only redeeming aspect of this, if any, was that I found some of the visuals to be pretty nice, but much of it is obvious CGI.
Maybe since the characters will be older in the next one, the acting will be better. I can only hope.",5,0,3,21 December 2017
Hereditary," Pretty average family drama, has one redeeming scene though
","First off, there was an 8 year old girl in the theatre with her family when I went to see this, what are you people thinking?Anyways,
The film had one really good scary moment, but by the end I didn't totally understand the narrative and had to keep looking up explanations to understand exactly what happened.
Still, my question is- why did the cult need to put Charlie's spirit inside of Peter? Wasn't the whole point to get Paimon a male host? Why keep Charlie? Also, why is it that none of the characters call the police during any of this? 
The one scene that did really get to me was the decapitation scene - how the characters reacted to it and how the director chose to reveal it. I don't remember another time I've felt that much adrenaline rush through me when watching a movie. However, the rest of the film felt pretty slow and eventless, and at some points boring.
The first scene at the grief recovery group was pretty bad. Collette's character gives a total exposition dump of 'here's everything you need to know about my character to watch the rest of the film'. As well acted as it was, the movie felt like it came to a grinding halt for this, which was a major flaw in the writing. 
I really couldn't take Alex Wolff seriously in this. He just seemed like just another douchey frat bro. A shame that most of the film hinges on his character and performance. He was fine in Patriots Day, but that might've been because I didn't realize it was him.
However, there were a few scenes where the actors did create good tension when they didn't have any dialogue, mainly the dinner scenes.Also, at the very end when the Mom was floating up the ladder to the treehouse, I couldn't help but laugh, it was so unintentionally funny to me.",6,4,9,10 June 2018
Just Go with It," Unfunny garbage
","I only watched this to see Kidman, and considering it's Adam Sandler, I wasn't expecting much. But wow, was this was horrible and much more painful than I had initially expected. I got an hour in until I just skimmed through and only watched the scenes that Kidman was in. Up to that point, it proved to be a completely predictable, unfunny, clich√©d, and cringe-inducing movie that nearly gave me a migraine. This entire film's paper-thin premise is built around people being stupid and situations that could have easily been avoided. Sandler has absolutely no charisma, and is criminally unfunny, which tears the movie apart. I actually ended up liking and respected the antagonist in this (Kidman) more than the protagonist (Aniston). This is the result of the terrible characters and even worse portrayals. How am I supposed to believe that Sandler is a medical doctor when his vocabulary is as developed as a five-year-old?The only saving graces in this was Bailee Madison who is quite a good child actor, and Nicole Kidman who I was really embarrassed for. She deserves better than this.",2,1,2,29 June 2017
A Quiet Place," disappointing and flawed, but still good effort
","Pretty disappointing considering the hype. There's not really all that much conflict here. The film presents small episodic events that never really seem to amount to much consequence. It's nice that Krasinski tries to build tension with sound, but just watching these characters trying to survive doesn't go far enough to make an entertaining movie. It was just so disappointing how little they ended up doing with the concept, and resorted to an obnoxious number of jump-scares instead.The story as a whole lacks a significant amount of exposition as well. We are never given any reason to care about these characters, and the film just automatically assumes that we do. I myself couldn't considering how many stupid decisions they make throughout the runtime. Same thing with the monsters. We are never given a backstory to them and my questions remain: what are they? where did they come from? why are they here?The characters don't talk all that much, but when they do, the dialogue is any is pretty simplistic and boring. The child acting is questionable, while the two lead adults is just passable. As mentioned, I couldn't help not caring about these characters. When all of this is going on, why would they decide to have a baby? Isn't that such an obnoxious and unnecessary risk? Also, when Evelyn's labor takes less than five minutes. If you know anything about childbirth, you would know that labor lasts for a number of hours. Really?When Lee is sacrificing himself to save his kids, why would he drop his weapon? couldn't he have tried to fight the monster? Speaking of, why have the characters never even tried to fight back? there's only three of the monsters, why wouldn't they have tried shooting them earlier?As a whole, I felt like this was the middle and end of a movie that was missing beginning since there is so much exposition and information missing.",6,4,8,3 May 2018
Call Me by Your Name," Not Another Gay Movie!
","***watched for the 2018 oscars
Good god this took forever to get through. I kept pausing it because it just couldn't hold my attention. There was no reason for it to be as long as it was. It just felt like it was dragging on for hours with no real purpose for doing so. In its 132 minute runtime, it manages to be both uneventful and completely empty.Call me By Your Name is nothing other than just another gay movie. It does nothing to separate itself from other gay romance movies in the slightest. How is this any more than the male version of Blue is the Warmest Color?Isn't the entire plot of this borderline pedophilia? Like this kid is 17 having sex with a 24 year old, who by the way looks far older, probably more like 30 (which is how old Hammer was when this was shot). Either way, there is seemingly no chemistry between the lead actors. It's set in the 80's, but there is no noticeable stylization from that decade, or any other obvious reason for it to be set then. 
Much like this, a number of other elements just didn't seem to matter or have any effect on the plot line at all. Why was it set in Italy? Who knows. Why were the characters Jewish? Doesn't matter apparently. Gay porn is probably much more satisfying than this.",3,32,96,10 February 2018
Moulin Rouge!," pretty colors doesn't equal good filmmaking
","This was so distractingly cartoonish. It seemed to be flashy for the sake of being flashy.This has some of the absolute worst editing I have ever seen in a film. I nearly turned it off in the first 20 minutes because of how chaotic and choppy it was. It legitimately gave me nausea and I felt like I was having a seizure. The script was terrible. The dialogue has horrible and the story was formulaic. I know I say that a lot, but it is especially true for this if none else. For most of the run time, I was just sitting through it so I could watch cinemasins afterwards. I didn't even have to pay attention to it to know what was happening, that's how predictable it was.The songs did absolutely nothing for the story other than say what the audience already knew. They just felt like cheap time filler that went on forever. If the film is going to have such anachronistic music in it, why does it even bother telling us the year it takes place in? to have pretty costumes and sets? it seemed like it. Something so pretty really shouldn't feel so dull and empty.",4,3,6,23 June 2017
Hidden Figures," Could have been better cast and written
","***watched for the 2017 OscarsA lot of the movie felt like it was just saying 'wow look at how evil white people used to be' which got old fast. Every time Katherine walked into a room, the movie basically stopped for 30 seconds to let the point sink in. It got really tedious.Additionally, if they were trying to create an atmosphere similar to the 60s, why was there modern music? It was really distracting and unfitting. The casting here was rough. I can't take Parsons seriously, same with Powell who I just see as the idiot from Scream Queens. They really didn't sell that they were brilliant scientists. Other than that, the acting was pretty good, namely Henson, and it's disappointing she wasn't nominated instead of Davis.The movie really suffered anytime it cut to Katherine's personal life. Those scenes really dragged on and didn't seem to have any affect on her professional life, which was what the movie was about. Had these scenes been cut, this could have been a lot better.The directing felt very basic and by the numbers. It feels like I've seen this movie a bunch of times already, just with different actors.",6,1,6,16 February 2017
The Boy in the Striped Pajamas," Great Holocaust film, even if implausible
","I didn't know all that much about this film going in, so it was a nice surprise to see actors I recognized such as Vera Farmiga who played Lorraine Warren in The Conjuring, and Madolyn in The Departed, and also David Thewlis who played Professor Lupin in Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban. The film didn't give any specific date or year that the story took place in, which was interesting because I would have liked to place the exact year and what events were going on in Germany at that point in time. Initially I expected a formulaic Holocaust movie that was significantly watered down to make it more watchable for audiences and teenagers considering this was given a PG-13 rating, but that was definitely not the case, especially with ending.The opening shot was great and really caught my eye. It gave the film a very innocent full of life feel. The colors and cinematography as a whole was another thing I loved. Beno√Æt Delhomme (the director of photography) did a great job of using such vivid colors which made this seem like the audience was watching a story through the eyes of a child, and also reminded the audience that the story is being told from a Nazi perspective. As Bruno starts to realize what is happening, his clothes become darker and more faded. Additionally, when Bruno gets into the camp, the colors become washed-out which gives the film a depressing tone. Another thing I noticed is that both Bruno and his father had blue eyes, but only Bruno's were light and full of life, while his fathers were darkened. This could be a contrast of a child's innocence and an adult corrupted by power.I additionally had a few problems with the film. If this is about Nazi Germany and set in the countryside of Berlin, why do all the characters speak English with British accents? It would have been much more realistic and effective if the entire movie was in German. There were also many references to airplanes when the kids were playing throughout the film, but this was never explained. Why did this happen in the first place? Another problem I had was how large the holes in the fence were in the camp. Couldn't Shmuel have easily crawled through one of them? Weren't there any guards watching the fence? It didn't look like it. The characters additionally kept referring to Germany as the 'Fatherland', whereas Hitler always referred to it as the 'Motherland'. Shouldn't the characters mimic this to be more historically accurate? The biggest issue I had with the plot line was that the entire story was implausible. There were no 9-year-olds in the camps. If someone was not old enough to worked, they were immediately put to death.As a whole, apart from these criticisms, I really enjoyed this film. The soundtrack was absolutely lovely and joyous, which was also a great contrast to the dark setting of the Holocaust. The entire cast did amazingly, but the most notable performances were from Farmiga and Butterfield. Also a nice touch that was added was the vans in the background every so often when Bruno was playing on the swing, so that the audience wouldn't get lost in the story of a kid, and are reminded of what this movie was really about. I also appreciated the themes of adults and their relationships with children. Not only does the teacher in the film completely brainwash the two kids, but any time they have a chance, the parents shelter and lie to the kids about what is really going on in the country. The ending had such a great climax and an upsetting, yet effective, conclusion. I knew there wouldn't be a happy ending, considering the subject matter, but the way this ended was extremely unexpected.",7,0,1,2 May 2017
Mudbound," Boring and doesn't offer anything new.
","Boring, melodramatic, slow, and way too long. Some parts of this felt like splitting hairs, I swear.
The characters were very bland, and because of this, I found myself not caring for most of them. The redeeming quality in terms of acting was definitely Blige. She was easily the best part of this. This really didn't offer anything new. It did have its moments, but honestly not that many. Even then, these few parts I feel like I had already seen in similar movies.
Also, the visual design made it feel more like a Civil war 1800s era instead of the mid 1940s. Wasn't convinced.",5,6,16,29 January 2018
Wonder Woman," It's OK, just really long
","Want to preface this by saying that I'm not big on superhero movies. A lot of the time I see them as easy to make drivel that studios churn out for a quick cash grab, void of much, if any, substance. So Wonder Woman was pretty much an expected by-the- numbers action movie. Most of the film felt like padding scenes. The majority of the runtime seemed to be filled with pointless exposition scenes, resulting in the film as a whole to feel pretty long, and tedious to sit through at points. The setup especially took way too long to tell and suffered the most. The action scenes ranged from just OK to ridiculous. The music and few seconds of slo-mo were unfitting and really took me out of the movie. However, the one thing I absolutely loved about this was the set design and locations by Aline Bonetto. Each scene was incredible to look at and very believable. In the end, if I actually liked superhero movies (DC or Marvel) I probably would have liked this more. It was an OK film, there wasn't anything wrong with it, I just felt like integer gave me a reason to care.",6,0,4,24 November 2017
Hacksaw Ridge," Formulaic and predictable war movie
","**Watched for the 2017 OscarsThis felt very formulaic and predictable. Every single war movie clich√© is in this. It seemed to try and be too much like Full Metal Jacket, Saving Private Ryan, or Platoon at many different points. It really didn't seem to be anything new, other than the insanely long action sequences that looked great, but also felt like a bit of a sensory overload.Additionally, the dialogue was incredibly and unbelievably cheesy, mostly between Desmond and Dorothy. I just couldn't buy it. At first I couldn't take Vince Vaughn seriously simply because he's Vince Vaughn, but he grew on me as the film progressed. Either way the acting was all just OK, nothing notable. The main character I found to be really whiny and unlikable for the most part. Everything he said made me cringe.Lastly, there were a few dream sequences the main character had that felt random and unfitting. They are never revisited or explained and are obvious that their dreams as their happening which makes me question the purpose of them.",6,3,8,16 February 2017
The Godfather," Overhyped gangster crap
","Super slow moving and fatiguing to watch considering it's unnecessarily long runtime and formulaic structure. Honestly, you can't expect me to get attached to characters if they're just going to be killed off in 20 minutes of being introduced.It has a very episodic structure in that things are set up, but never revisited. For example, in the beginning of the film, there is a subplot of one of the family blackmailing a director to put someone in his film. After putting his horse's head in his bead, he accepts. This storyline is never visited again. What was the point?This honestly put me in such a bad mood, and movies shouldn't do that. I want to enjoy myself during a viewing and be invested in the story, not want it to end as soon as possible.
It did have *some* interesting symbolism, but not enough for me to give it a 3/5.It honestly baffles me how many people love this movie to death.",5,3,11,9 February 2018
