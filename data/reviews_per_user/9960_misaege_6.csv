Changeling," Clint Eastwood and Angelina Jolie Triumph
","I disagree Clint Eastwood had Angelina crying at every turn as one reviewer put it. Imagine if that were your son...how do you think you'd feel? If anything, I thought AJ played it exceptionally well, considering the circumstances she was thrust in by a psychopath who kidnapped her son. There's nothing worse than losing a son, daughter, brother, sister or parent. Being a single parent only made it more traumatic for AJ's character. Everything was on her shoulders...the guilt for leaving her child alone, the wonder if she'd ever see him again, the rising, then falling, then rising again of hope he was still alive somewhere. Then she skillfully portrayed the anger and disgust with the LAPD, who tried to force an impostor as her son on her. Then there was the outrage of being committed to the mental ward without provocation. Love her line after seeing her friend endure shock treatment. Give Clint Eastwood a compelling story and skilled actors and he'll come up with a gripping film just about every time. This was among his best, in my humble opinion. It was also among Angelina's best. Hard for me to believe she wasn't even nominated for best actress...I thought she richly deserved it.",Null,1,2,20 April 2015
Captain Phillips," Another Tom Hanks Triumph
","As a rule of thumb, I'll see pretty much anything Tom Hanks makes. This one didn't disappoint...all along the intensity gradually increases. You kind of know what's eventually coming...force against force that will result in Capt Philipps' freedom or death. Of course, we knew he survived the ordeal, but the gripping suspense really takes over. My heart was pounding the last 20 minutes or so...culminated by the scene inside the rescue ship when the (real) Navy Corpsman examines Capt Phillips. Hanks' performance was Oscar-worthy...no doubt. That's just great filmmaking. Equally impressive was Barkhad Abdi, who played Muse. Would love to see him get best supporting actor at the Oscars.",9,0,1,21 February 2014
Skyfall," Not Your Typical James Bond Film
","Without question, this Bond film is the most complex, dramatic and heartfelt in the entire series. There's still some of the great action sequences characteristic of any JB film, but they're really more of an integral part to the story rather than just spectacular. I really like Daniel Craig's take on Bond...he's tough, physical and confident, but also shows a more humane side of the character. Dame Judi Dench is simply superb...as she's been in just about everything I've ever seen her in. The scenes at the end were very powerful and emotional, not something you typically see in a Bond film. All in all, this was an excellent departure from the Bond movies we've seen over the years. I'm really looking forward to the next one...and thrilled Daniel Craig's still playing the leading role.",8,0,4,17 February 2015
American Sniper," American Sniper: Character Study, NOT Intended to be a Political Film
","This movie has generated a ton of discussion...some constructive, some destructive. My wife and I saw it and were blown away. I served on active duty AF for 23 + years and served another 21 + years as a civil servant. I never saw combat...I retired shortly after Desert Storm. I have many friends who were close to the front lines and heard varying stories about what they did and saw. Unless you've served the military in some capacity I supposed it'd be hard to understand what Chris Kyle did. Some have called him a coward...and that's just absurd. He personally saved hundreds, maybe thousands of military and civilian lives because of his expertise. This film crafted by Clint Eastwood and superbly acted by Bradley Cooper was a character study...never intended to be any kind of a political film. It tells the story of how Chris Kyle used his extraordinary talent to support his fellow military during 4 deployments to the war zones. It also shows how conflicted Kyle was...he wanted to be there for his comrades, but also be a good husband and father back home. I thought the film did a very credible job of capturing that struggle. Again, unless you've been deployed or worked with those who have, it would be more difficult to understand what Eastwood and Cooper tried to portray. The showing my wife and I went to was attended by mostly senior citizens. As the credits were rolling, there were very few dry eyes in the theater. Some stayed in their seats so shaken and emotional they needed some time to leave. That's what filmmakers strive to do...to move their audience. And on that score, Eastwood and Cooper certainly did.",8,17,34,17 February 2015
Glory," Glory: An American History Lesson
","I just saw this movie again recently...it'd been years since I'd seen it. Each and every time I've watched it, I was moved by the story, the actors, the baring of prejudice the movie so eloquently displays. The entire cast was extraordinary...from Matthew Broderick as the white Col who led the black soldiers to his Sgt Major, played by Morgan Freeman and of course, Denzel Washington, who played Pvt Trip. Beyond the great acting and terrific direction of Edward Zwick, this is an American History lesson. I only wish movies like this were made when I went to high school. It does a wonderful job of showing the heinous battle scenes, the extreme prejudice and resoluteness of both the North and South to win the war. This film should be a mandatory inclusion in all American History curriculum.",10,1,2,21 February 2014
Silver Linings Playbook," Tour d' Force for Lawrence and Cooper
","Unfortunately for Bradley Cooper, Daniel Day Lewis was virtually unbeatable for his portrayal of Lincoln. Otherwise, I think he could well have walked away with his first Best Actor Academy Award. He was singularly most outstanding, as was his co-star Jennifer Lawrence. Beyond those two, the entire cast was just tremendous. It was the best role I've seen Robert DeNiro play in years. The film was a roller coaster of emotions...anger, humor, despair, elation, etc. Welcome to the bipolar world. I thought the director did a splendid job of thoughtfully exposing bi-polarism and how it can affect those who suffer from it and their families. This is a film that stirs your emotions...in a variety of ways. And, isn't that the goal of filmmakers...to move you. SLP gets a 10 for zapping a plethora of emotions in me. A truly unforgettable film, bravo!",10,0,1,21 February 2014
