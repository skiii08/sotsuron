The King's Speech," Firth conveys his character's feelings – mostly fear and frustration – with considerable ease and restrain.
","Tom Hooper, whose previous feature was The Dammed United (2009) about Brian Clough's short reign as coach of English football club Leeds United, now turns his attention to the British Royal Family, more specifically King George VI, who is played by Colin Firth in a great performance that would most certainly land him his first acting Oscar. Partnered by a supporting turn by Geoffrey Rush, whose role far exceeds the demands of a supporting character, Firth conveys his character's feelings – mostly fear and frustration – with considerable ease and restrain.The King's Speech, titled after the film's emotional final act, is a performance-driven period piece set in pre-WWII Britain, a time of uncertainty as Hitler started to rise to power. Firth's character, Bertie (that's his nickname), reluctantly takes over the throne after his father's death and his elder brother's decision to relinquish his power because of marital reasons. Bertie's reluctance stems from his tendency to stammer embarrassingly even when speaking to a friend, let alone addressing a whole nation on the brink of war with the Nazis.In comes Lionel (Rush), a self-proclaimed speech therapist who strikes up an endearing friendship with Bertie after initial animosity caused by conflicting views over the effectiveness of the former's unconventional method of treatment. If there is such a thing called the buddy period drama, The King's Speech confirms its existence. With gorgeous cinematography that is not too striking, and art direction that emphasizes on an understated elegance as opposed to an elaborate grandioseness, Hooper smartly allows the backdrop of the film to play a complementary role to his actors' performances, rather than vice versa.The frequent use of long, narrow corridors by Hooper metaphorically parallels Bertie's 'suffocation' – his struggle to cope with the responsibilities of being a king, who ideologically represents the voice of the common man, but sadly in this case, a king who is unable to find his own voice is as powerless as the very person whom he is speaking for. Lionel slowly helps him to correct his stammer and find faith in his voice, building up to a rousing climax that gives new meaning to the power of friendship to transcend all barriers, be it physical, class, or culture.David Seidler deserves praise for writing an original screenplay that is so dramatically compelling that the lack of an antagonist is hardly noticeable, unless you collectively count Hitler (who is seen from afar in black-and-white news footage), Bertie's stammer, and the microphone (a symbolic representation of Bertie's faceless, implacable enemy) as 'villains'. The King's Speech is assured a spot in my Top Ten Films of 2010, and is every bit deserving of the twelve Oscar nominations that it is running for. Funny, heartwarming, and ultimately uplifting, I would not be surprised if this wins Best Picture.GRADE: A (www.filmnomenon.blogspot.com) All rights reserved.",9,1,2,13 February 2011
Black Swan," Black Swan secures Aronofsky's position as arguably the most formidable American filmmaker working today.
","If Stanley Kubrick ever made a film about a ballerina obsessed with perfection, and as a result, she suffers physically and psychologically, that film would probably look like Black Swan. But having said that, Black Swan is very much Darren Aronofsky's own work, a film that is so intoxicatingly beautiful and such an immersive, and I dare say, hallucinatory cinematic experience that it is difficult to leave the theater with all your sanity intact. A cross between Powell and Pressburger's The Red Shoes (1948) and Kubrick's very own The Shining (1980), Black Swan is a psychological horror-drama that will leave viewers floored.Natalie Portman plays Nina in perhaps her most demanding lead role to date. She rises up to the task in a tremendous performance of grace and vulnerability. Nina is a ballerina seeking for a chance to succeed. She gets the part of Swan Queen in a new-age reworking of Swan Lake. She plays the White Swan with utmost elegance. But it is the role of Black Swan that troubles her. Her ballet coach Thomas (Vincent Cassel) tells Nina to let herself go, to feel her own body, and to surrender herself to the darkness of that role.Sexually repressed and living with an overbearing (and possibly) incestuous mother, Nina is haunted by the increasing frequency of dark thoughts. The arrival of Lily (Mila Kunis), her alternate to play Swan Queen, threatens her mental well-being. After all, Lily is everything Nina is not; the former eases into the role of Black Swan effortlessly too. It is very easy to sympathize with Nina, who is externally pressured by her mother, Thomas and Lily, and internally tormented by psychological insecurities, but Aronofsky's wildly imaginative and occasionally detached directing style allow ample room for viewers to be engaged intellectually as well.Like Nolan's Inception (2010), and Scorsese's Shutter Island (2010) before that, Black Swan is a trip down the deepest recesses of a character's mind, except this is a near psychedelic one. With scenes of look-away violence, non-arousing lesbian intimacy, and fantastical horror imagery, Aronofsky does not pull back on the punches as he conceives a visceral film of such frightening power that it hits viewers straight in the gut. There are moments that would make even the most seasoned horror fan jump in fear.Black Swan also features an astonishing score by the underrated Clint Mansell, who rearranges Tchaikovsky's music and fuses it together with his own, providing the film with a unique sound design that aptly accompanies Nina's descent to madness. The unpredictable nature of the film, and the nightmarish approach to what is essentially a simple story about a woman losing her mind not only make this one of the most special film experiences of the year, but also secure Aronofsky's position as arguably the most formidable American filmmaker working today.GRADE: A (www.filmnomenon.blogspot.com) All rights reserved.",9,2,5,25 January 2011
Pirates of the Caribbean: On Stranger Tides," On Stranger Tides is one of those Hollywood movies that is not exactly bad, neither is it something that warrants a second look.
","Rob Marshall, the director of Memoirs of a Geisha (2005), Nine (2009), and most famously, the Oscar-winning Chicago (2002), takes over the directorial duties of Gore Verbinski in this fourth installment of the wildly popular Pirates of the Caribbean series. Some of the principle cast return with the addition of a new face, that of sultry Spanish actress Penelope Cruz, in this 'more of the same' picture that will please fans who seek familiarity, but frustrate those who think that enough is enough.On Stranger Tides, as it is titled, follows Johnny Depp who reprises his colorful role as Jack Sparrow on a journey to find the mythical fountain of youth. Not surprisingly, a host of other characters, namely Barbossa (Geoffrey Rush) and villain Blackbeard (Ian McShane) are also after its magical healing powers. The adventure also sees Jack hooking up with old flame Angelica (Cruz) again as he becomes a pawn in a not so elaborate game to see who reaches the fountain of youth first.Slavishly sticking to the style and conventions of its prequels, On Stranger Tides is no breakthrough despite the change of director. For a start though, Marshall's film is a full half-hour shorter than its direct prequel At World's End (2007), and this works in favor of the attempt to sustain the viewer's interest while still retaining the sense of epicness associated with the series, which more or less is due in part to Hans Zimmer's rousing score.The action sequences are ordinary and not as exciting as expected, though a key act past the hour mark involving mermaids is at the very least interesting. The notion that mermaids are pretty girls with scales and fish tails who live under the sea is debunked in this film. Here they are seductive versions of human piranhas, desperate to lure men to their doom. One of them, named Syrena, is captured by Blackbeard's men because of a plot device, but is saved by a priest called Philip. Their relationship is surprisingly touching and well-developed despite it being a minor 'romantic' subplot.On Stranger Tides is an above average summer blockbuster that is still watchable. Depp, as always, pulls us into the picture with a consistently hypnotic performance, though it must be said that the chemistry between him and Cruz is less sizzling than we would like it to be. The decision to offload key but tiresome characters from the prequels as played by Orlando Bloom and Keira Knightley gives the franchise a much needed facelift. In a nutshell, On Stranger Tides is one of those Hollywood movies that is not exactly bad, neither is it something that warrants a second look.GRADE: B- (7/10 or 3 stars)www.filmnomenon.blogspot.comAll rights reserved.",7,8,16,22 May 2011
Scarface," Scarface has somewhat become a cult classic over the years, but truth be told, it is a pretentious film.
","Scarface is Brian De Palma's loose remake of the classic gangster picture of the same name by Howard Hawks. Instead of Chicago in which the latter is set, De Palma's film is set in Miami, giving it a timely relevance during the early eighties. During that time, there was an influx of illegal immigrants (many of them Cubans) into America, especially into Miami. Tony Montana is one of them, a fictional character created by screenwriter Oliver Stone (the Oscar-winning director of Platoon (1986) and JFK (1991)).Scarface follows Montana (Al Pacino) as he rises to power to become one of the country's most wealthiest and ruthless gangsters. He makes money through a lucrative business in drugs. Not surprisingly, he snorts cocaine himself. He is greedy, arrogant, and lusts over his boss' girl, Elvira (Michelle Pfeiffer). In the middle of his huge mansion, there lies a sculpture with a ball on top with the words 'The World Is Yours' emblazoned.The irony of those words are laid out in bare in the final sequence, perhaps Scarface's most (notoriously) famous one – a bloody shootout in which Montana wields a huge weapon and attempts to gun down intruders to his house. De Palma's film is very violent, and in an early scene, a chainsaw is used to torture a victim. This scene shows the director at his skillful best, using quick editing and indirect framing to suggest the gruesomeness of the act rather than through direct means. This makes it so much more stomach-churning.Scarface has somewhat become a cult classic over the years, but truth be told, it is a pretentious film. It is, in my opinion, a B-grade gangster picture dressed up as an Oscar contender. It is a campy experience, does not take itself seriously (to its detriment), and will probably get worse on subsequent viewings. The electronic score by Giorgio Moroder is absolutely appalling; it is dull, lacking in substance, and is a mismatch for a film with such a heavy subject matter.Al Pacino's performance is bad in a good way. He puts on a Cuban accent and exaggerates his acting that it becomes unintentionally funny. Montana turns into a caricature of sorts, like a cartoon character in an animated comedy. One could praise Pacino for elevating a sub-par film to something borderline watchable. Because De Palma has (wrongly) opted for a campy style, it is only wise for Pacino to take his acting in that direction too.While Scarface gives some insights into the lifestyle of the drug underworld, one feels that it may not be as definitive as Scorsese's Goodfellas (1990), the greatest picture of its genre, and many times more compulsively rewatchable. De Palma is talented but he is not a great filmmaker. He is way too inconsistent and his films do not often connect with viewers. Scarface would have been a failure if not for Stone's intense screenplay and Pacino's 'cartoonish' performance. Montana is unforgettable, but Scarface is not.SCORE: 6/10 (www.filmnomenon.blogspot.com) All rights reserved!",6,1,2,14 July 2010
The Incredible Hulk," The screenplay is so appalling that it makes George Lucas seems like Charles Dickens.
","Many fans of Marvel comics will be outraged by my score for The Incredible Hulk. After Iron Man which was only average by my standards, I thought Marvel could do no worse. They fail to realize that bringing in a quality director is immensely crucial to a film's critical success. Fair enough, Iron Man was Jon Favreau's fourth feature film after Zathura's unlikely hit.That cannot be said of The Incredible Hulk, whose director Louis Leterrier has a poor track record, making bad pictures such as Transporter 2 and Unleashed. Financially, The Incredible Hulk will score big because of its wide fanbase, as well as being strategically released after Iron Man. However, critically it is a whole level below Ang Lee's Hulk.If there's one aspect that The Incredible Hulk does well over Ang Lee's version, it's the visual effects. The grayish-green title character is digitally rendered so well that it makes Ang Lee's light-green monster seem cartoonish in comparison. The action sequences have more in quantity but lack in quality, though the climatic battle between the Incredible Hulk and an even more hulky nemesis is a notch more thrilling than the lackluster one in Iron Man.Edward Norton is not well-cast, but he's a more solid actor than the spiritless Eric Bana in the earlier Hulk. Another miscast is Liv Tyler who plays Bruce Banner's love interest. The awkward drama scenes between them are so incompetent that their character developments are half-baked.To make matters worse, at least Iron Man was enjoyable. Alas, The Incredible Hulk abandons the most fundamental quality of cinema - to entertain. The screenplay is so appalling that it makes George Lucas seems like Charles Dickens. No creative input and narrative breakthrough, the story of Bruce Banner is told in the most uninspired manner even for a comic book character.I'm not against Marvel, but they are definitely alienating the critical half of cinema lovers by their choice of filmmakers. Yes, The Incredible Hulk will appeal to hardcore fans, though the scary part is not the huge green ogre itself but how these people actually part their money so nonchalantly.SCORE: 4.5/10 (www.filmnomenon.blogspot.com) All rights reserved!",5,1,2,22 July 2010
Sucker Punch," Snyder may have returned to his signature filmmaking style that characterized 300 and Watchmen, but not in the hardcore fashion that we have expected him to deliver.
","Zack Snyder, who is popular for his ultraviolent, over-stylized films such as 300 (2007) and Watchmen (2009), delivers a new motion picture that marks a return to his roots as a badass filmmaker this side of Tarantino. But a quick look at the consumer rating for Sucker Punch is likely to leave fanboys considerably disappointed. After all, a PG-rated Snyder film is as puzzling as it is ironic. Please ignore the anomaly that is his last film, a family-friendly animated outing called Legend of the Guardians: The Owls of Ga'Hoole (2010), which is Snyder taking a breather rather than letting out aggressive steam.Sucker Punch, with its all-babes cast, targets male youths who are also video gaming geeks. The story, which is so minimalistic that it lives up to the first four letters of the film's title, tells of a teenage girl called Baby Doll (Emily Browning) who is sent to a mental institution by her immoral stepfather. There she envisions a plan to escape the facility while retreating into the reality of her mind, which by the way is every geek's wet dream. With the help of four other hot babes in the institution, Baby Doll attempts to free herself from her physical prison with guidance and clues from her mental mentor, the Wise Man (Scott Glenn).Opting for all style does not always guarantee substance. Weak characterizations plague Sucker Punch, whose lead cast are nothing more than eye candy, and their motivations not well-developed. Viewers are unlikely to care whether they live or die, or about the sacrifices they have made for each other, because their characters are as paper-thin as the skimpy outfits they wear. The acting, however, is surprisingly decent for a film whose emphasis is overwhelmingly on the spectacle of sight and sound, of which it has too much in abundance.The action is stylized and invigorating, at least in the four or five 7- 10 minute interludes that break the narrative structure into several progressive parts. Very much a MMORPG blown up onto the big screen during these interludes, Sucker Punch borrows heavily from elements of popular culture such as The Matrix (1999) and Kill Bill (2003) to even games like Metal Slug in the mid-nineties. Not since Tank Girl (1995), a brainless, zany, sci-fi action comedy that pits one girl (and her tank) against an evil mega-corporation has a film been so reliant on girl firepower to light up the screen.Loud, brash, and I daresay at times entertaining, Sucker Punch is unfortunately soft on violence and sex, which apart from the non- existent plot, is the other main issue here. Where is the blood and gore? Where is the nudity? There is not even a hint of lesbianism, or any other forms of frank sexuality. Not that these are necessary, but a Snyder film is still a Snyder film. He may have returned to his signature filmmaking style that characterized 300 and Watchmen, but not in the hardcore fashion that we have expected him to deliverand one more thing, please pack a pair of earplugs to go with your popcorn, unless you want to get your eardrums sucker punched.GRADE: C- (www.filmnomenon.blogspot.com) All rights reserved.",5,20,43,23 March 2011
The Sound of Music," The Sound of Music promises an entertaining, satisfying, and heartwarming three hours of cinematic goodness that year after year still remains thoroughly rewatchable.
","The Sound of Music opens with stunning aerial shots of the Austrian natural landscape. The camera then sweeps down and moves forward toward a speck that grows larger and larger to revealMaria (Julie Andrews), the lead character, running with unbridled joy on a grassy hilltop, and breaking into the title song with such gracefulness and confidence that it is impossible not to fall in love with her at once. This famous opening sequence sets the tone for the entire film, one of hopeful optimism, as director Robert Wise creates a near-perfect motion picture adaptation of the Broadway musical, together with original songs by Richard Rogers and Oscar Hammerstein II.Written by Ernest Lehman (West Side Story, 1961; Hello, Dolly!, 1969), who adapts the material from Howard Lindsay and Russel Crouse's book of the same name, The Sound of Music tells the inspiring story of Maria, an assertive nun-to-be who is forced to leave her convent temporarily to become a governess to the seven children of Captain Von Trapp (Christopher Plummer), a Naval officer and widower whose strict authoritarian rule has caused his children to lose their freedom and childhood. Maria's arrival brings change to the lives of the children, and slowly thaws Von Trapp's cold and cynical heart, mending his heartbreak of the last few years, and giving him a newfound purpose in life.Winning five Oscars including one for Best Picture, The Sound of Music is set during the pre-Hitler years in Austria, and features some of the world's best loved songs such as 'Do Re Mi', 'My Favorite Things', and 'Edelweiss'. In fact, one of the most unforgettable moments in the film shows Plummer strumming on the guitar and singing 'Edelweiss' to his eager children. Many of the songs are catchy and fun to sing along. More crucially, they are well-linked to the narrative, and with every repetition, they add a new layer of meaning to the emotions the characters face in the different stages of the film.Andrews' energetic performance is the heartbeat of this film. Without her, The Sound of Music would not have been half as successful. She acts and sings as if she was born for the role of Maria. Despite the long runtime, Wise's picture is never at any point lackluster. Andrews' likable screen persona and strong screen presence bring forth a high degree of engagement with the viewer. It is difficult to take your eyes off her whenever she appears on screen, and this is especially so when she is together with Plummer, who shares with her an intentionally awkward chemistry that provides the film with most of its humor and drama.One may drown in the wonderful music and songs, but at its thematic core, The Sound of Music is a film that teaches us to stay true to ourselves, to know our identity, and to share the meaning of joy and living with others. If there ever was a great motion picture that everyone in the family could enjoy, you are looking at it. Perhaps the most memorable of dramatic musicals, The Sound of Music promises an entertaining, satisfying, and heartwarming three hours of cinematic goodness that year after year still remains thoroughly rewatchable.GRADE: A+ (www.filmnomenon.blogspot.com) All rights reserved.",10,4,11,28 December 2010
Source Code," Not every film can boast the ability to connect both mind and heart with near equal satisfaction, but Source Code does it quite brilliantly.
","From the director of Moon (2009), one of the most thought-provoking science-fiction films to hit the screen in the last decade, Source Code is a taut, tightly-paced mystery-thriller in the tradition of Hitchcock's Strangers on the Train (1951) and North by Northwest (1959) – note the wide landscape shots at the start – but has its premise rooted in alternate reality, a sci-fi concept that continues to baffle even the most seasoned fan of the genre. Proving that Moon's critical success was no fluke, director Duncan Jones imbues in Source Code, a film that is intended to attract a significantly larger audience, with a rare sense of intellect, and blends it with surprisingly honest human drama.Not every film can boast the ability to connect both mind and heart with near equal satisfaction, but Source Code does it quite brilliantly. Jones' film stars Jake Gyllenhaal as Cpt. Colter Stevens, who used to be part of the U.S. army fighting the war in Afghanistan, but now finds himself in the bizarre circumstance of having to inhabit another person's body in a speeding train in order to find a terrorist before he blows up a series of bombs. And like every suspenseful thriller, there is a deadline: Stevens has only eight minutes to save the day.Despite the deceptively simple premise, writer Ben Ripley creates a story that becomes increasingly complicated, but it is never disorienting as viewers will be only as confused as Stevens, whose struggle to piece the mystery of his existence becomes more illuminating as time passes. Like Moon, Source Code explores themes of memory, identity, and isolation. And like Inception (2010), the film alternates between 'realities'. In one 'reality', Stevens finds himself alone in a space capsule of sorts, with the scenes' visual design reminiscent that of the moving rover in Moon. Mental isolation is also a key theme in both films.Source Code, however, could have been a more emotionally potent film if its last ten minutes were not included in the final cut. The film should rightly have ended in the manner of The 400 Blows (1959) and Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid (1969) – that is, with a freeze frame. That would certainly have retained and encapsulated the emotional impact and cinematic brilliance of this soon-to-be sci-fi cult classic. Gyllenhaal's performance is excellent for a thriller of this nature as he communicates anxiety and confusion with aplomb. There is also so much more to his character than what usually typifies a conventional action hero, with a strong emphasis on his back story.Drawing deeper into Source Code, I feel that by using Stevens as an example, the film not only raises ethical issues, but also serves as an indirect criticism against the U.S. government/military's hardball tactics to coerce detained (but possibly innocent) suspects to provide them with vital information to nab terrorists. In a nutshell, Duncan Jones has fashioned a fascinating sci-fi mystery-thriller set in the real world of today that should give moviegoers an experience to savor. Exciting and clever, Source Code is one film that you should not miss.GRADE: A- (8.5/10 or 4 stars)(www.filmnomenon.blogspot.com)All rights reserved.",9,1,1,21 April 2011
Minority Report," Minority Report may be the most entertaining, cerebral sci-fi thriller of the 2000s decade.
","Based on a short story by the great sci-fi author Philip K. Dick, whose work inspired popular films such as Ridley Scott's Blade Runner (1982), and Paul Verhoeven's Total Recall (1990), the film adaptation of Minority Report is a cause for celebration for fans of the genre. Directed by Steven Spielberg and released in 2002, Minority Report may be the most entertaining, cerebral sci-fi thriller of the 2000s decade. For a Spielberg picture, Minority Report is quite underrated; it is not very often cited among 'Spielberg's Popcorn Greats' such as Jaws (1975), Raiders of the Lost Ark (1981), and Jurassic Park (1993), and I feel that needs to change now.Minority Report is set in the future in which criminals are caught before they commit their crimes. A special Pre-Crime unit headed by John Anderton (Tom Cruise) takes advantage of three 'Pre-Cogs' who have the ability to 'see' a crime, and identify its perpetrator and victim before the crime is committed. This has effectively prevented criminals acts from happening for yearsuntil one day the system accuses John of murdering a stranger called Leo Crow. Determined to prove his innocence, John has to escape from the clutches of Pre-Crime officers hunting for him while trying to find answers to his predicament.First, Spielberg's direction is top-notch. He sets up the story and introduces how Pre-Crime works in a lengthy prologue that is an exciting prelude of what is to come. With an extremely potent blend of quick cuts and kinetic movements within shots, the film is fast-paced, engaging, and in some parts, very tense. One sequence, in which electronic spiders scurry about in an apartment to find John, is vintage Spielberg. In an elaborate long take in this sequence, the camera rises above a huge set consisting of rooms and walls as it tracks in and out as if spying on its occupants.In addition, towards the end of the above-mentioned sequence, there is a bathtub scene that gives Minority Report its most suspenseful peak. In the canon of Spielberg's 'moments', this should be considered one of them. Interestingly, the approach is quite similar to the 'alien pod in the basement' sequence in War of the Worlds (2005), another underrated Spielberg sci-fi thriller. Cruise, who appears in both films, gives a decent performance here, and he is ably backed up by a strong supporting cast consisting of Colin Farrell, Max von Sydow, and Samantha Morton.Spielberg keeps audiences on their toes by structuring the film like a mystery. There is a sinister truth, in fact multiple truths, that await Cruise's character (and the viewer). And the payoff is beyond expectations. Twisting and turning like a writhing snake, Minority Report haunts as much as it entertains. It is Spielberg at his best, and for those who deride Hollywood for their infamous ability to churn out brainless popcorn flicks, here is one very excellent example of the contrary.GRADE: A+ (www.filmnomenon.blogspot.com) All rights reserved.",10,0,1,5 January 2011
Kung Fu Panda," DreamWorks scores a direct hit with Kung Fu Panda, injecting a sense of freshness to an otherwise traditional and cliché narrative.
","Kung Fu Panda is DreamWorks' best animated release since the global success of Shrek in 2001. The second major animated picture this year after Horton Hears A Who!, Kung Fu Panda is timed perfectly to cash in on the profitable summer blockbusters period, and more strategically, to avoid direct competition with Pixar's new feature, the highly- anticipated WALL.E which will hit our shores in August. The debut feature film of Mark Osborne and John Stevenson, Kung Fu Panda provides an auspicious start to their filmmaking careers. As the title suggests, the film is about an overweight noodle-selling panda, Po, who harbors dreams of becoming a top kung fu warrior. By accidental luck, he finds himself being labeled as the next Dragon Warrior whose immediate task is to defeat the evil Tai Lung and bring peace to the village. The story of an underdog rising from a humble background to become a destined fighter has been interpreted in many ways and in different genres of cinema (e.g. Rocky, Kung Fu Hustle). Kung Fu Panda is no different; in fact there's nothing original about its plot. So what makes the movie worth the dollars?Two reasons. Jack Black and the hilarious portrayal of Po. There's no one better to do voice-overs for Po than Black. He captures the characteristics of such a character with unnerving accuracy which is not a surprise as Po is modeled heavily after Black. Furthermore, Po is created in such a way that every body movement and facial expression of his are highly exaggerated, providing a heavy source of comicality and laughs aplenty. As a matter of fact, Kung Fu Panda is arguably the funniest animated film in years. The action sequences defy physics ala Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon. They are kinetically pleasing though much less inventive than expected. One standout sequence involves a scramble over a dumpling between Po and his master using chopsticks and plenty of side-splitting acrobatics. In a nutshell, DreamWorks scores a direct hit with Kung Fu Panda, injecting a sense of freshness to an otherwise traditional and cliché narrative. There's no better way to snack on Hello Pandas than this. Recommended!GRADE: A- (www.filmnomenon.blogspot.com) All rights reserved.",9,1,1,3 March 2011
Akira," Akira is a dizzying ride that's enjoyable, but the ending doesn't lend a lasting touch to a potential great animated classic.
","Released in 1988, Akira had a faithful cult following. One of the most influential Japanese animation (or anime) ever produced, it explores deep, mature issues that are rarely showcased in animation form. Including graphic violence and gore, and profanity, Akira's target audience is aimed at largely teens and adults, not small kids. The filmmakers' intention is to show how future Tokyo will look and feel like. Their vision is uncompromising; a post-apocalyptic, polluted city with gangsters and corrupted government officials, plus unethical scientists.Akira's animation is mostly cell-drawn, immaculately detailed, and very colorful. It seduces us from the start, hooking us right into the polluted world of neo-Tokyo. The characters evolve into something quite substantial; their developments seldom paper-thin. Akira has many exhilarating set-pieces, and its own fair share of great action sequences. With fantastic music accompaniment and stunning remastered sound effects, watching on home video is a blast.The problem of Akira (and it's a major one in my opinion) lies in the last half hour. It starts out in the most brilliant way, but ends in an overblown, exhaustive, and indulgent manner that is nearly suicidal. While the creativity is there, the long-winded ending sequence is likely to end up saturating viewers whom have already been through almost two hours of mind-boggling stuff. Akira is a dizzying ride that's enjoyable, but the ending doesn't lend a lasting touch to a potential great animated classic. Cult followers will be likely to think otherwise though.GRADE: B+ (www.filmnomenon.blogspot.com) All rights reserved.",8,0,4,16 December 2010
12 Angry Men," This is a quality black-and-white offering from the late 1950s.
","Highly regarded as one of the best pictures of all time, 12 Angry Men manages to be intense, funny, and serious, simultaneously without being over-exaggerated. The characterisation of each of the 12 jurors are perfectly realised, with each being distinctive juxtapose with the others. Although the lead actor in the strong cast is Henry Fonda (who's excellent here), I'm particularly impressed with Lee J. Cobb's Oscar- worthy performance.The interesting fact of 12 Angry Men is that more than 95% of the filming is done in a small enclosed room. Praise to Sidney Lumet for being able to creatively work around with the cast in a confined space, without boring the viewers. The screenplay is exceptional, highly entertaining, yet allowing room for intelligent thoughts (of viewers) to roam. This is a quality black-and-white offering from the late 1950s, and is definitely in most film critics Top 100 films of all-time.

Oldboy," Never has someone's action and another's reaction sparked endless chains of 'action-reaction' events that are so devastatingly depicted in a motion picture before.
","Critically-lauded and an audience favorite, Oldboy is arguably Park Chan-wook's best film to date, and one of the key works of contemporary Korean cinema. Winning the Jury Prize at Cannes, Oldboy lets fly an intoxicating sense of atmosphere, an otherworldly, surrealistic feeling that sucks the viewer into the ghoulish noir world Park has conceived. We are introduced to the lead character, Oh Dae-su (Choi Min-sik), at the onset whose life story forms the core of Oldboy.Park's objective treatment of Dae-su is clever. The latter appears to be relating his story to the audience but it seems he is just as confused as we are. Yet we are willing to listen to him, to empathize with his situation, and to follow him on his quest to dig for the truth. Now, Dae-su is quite a poor chap. He has been locked alone in a room by a captor for the last 15 years, and then out of a sudden he is released with only five days to unravel the mystery and find his captor.Oldboy starts out as a promising mystery-thriller, then turns into a love story, and then becomes a mob-vengeance flick. And when the pieces seem to have fit the puzzle, Park pulls the rug under us with a stunning revelation that builds the film up to its tragic conclusion. It is difficult to pigeonhole Oldboy into one or two specific genres because it breaks the conventions of every associated genre, resulting in a film best left to be admired and appreciated according to its own terms.Park is a very skilled filmmaker; he has created a signature visual style that is present in most of his works – a morbid coldness that gives viewers a sense of unease through odd color tones, unorthodox shots, and numbing violence that seem almost too nonchalant. While he could be accused of being overly indulgent in brutality in Thirst (2009), in Oldboy however, the violence makes complete sense.A few of them remain etched in my mind. One, the tooth torture scene in all of its g(l)ory. Two, the tongue-cutting scene, which is more painful than it impliedly suggests. And lastly, the controversial scene that shows Dae-su eating a huge octopus alive after he is released from captivity. Now, you may wonder why Park goes to such an extreme extent to shoot these ghastly scenes of suffering. The reason is simple – causal action brings about consequential reaction.As Park slowly reveals key plot points during the course of the film, it becomes clear that violence is not a means to an end itself (this is the nature of many 'torture porn' films), but a meaningful part of a whole. Mi-do (Kang Hye-jeong), a young woman who works in a sushi bar, meets Dae-su and falls in love with him at an inopportune time at the crossroads of violence. When not seeking sexual solace in Mi-do, Dae-su would react (almost always violently) against his captives.In perhaps Oldboy's most brilliant sequence (a nostalgic throwback to those Street Fighter video games), Park choreographs a long take showing Dae-su fending off hordes of knife-wielding, rod-swinging street gangsters as he makes his way along a dirty, dimly-lit corridor from left to right. Such is his determination to stay alive that even with a knife plunged into his back, he continues to punch his way through.Misogynistic and cold-blooded, Oldboy is Park's vision of a world ravaged by tyranny, vengeance, misanthropy and masochism. Yet, he finds bizarre beauty in all of this ugliness. Based on a comic by Minegishi, Park's story is absorbing and consumes you whole. Never has someone's action and another's reaction sparked endless chains of 'action-reaction' events that are so devastatingly depicted in a motion picture before. I could only offer my sympathies to the characters. Even then, I know that is not enough.SCORE: 9/10 (www.filmnomenon.blogspot.com) All rights reserved!",9,2,4,31 July 2010
127 Hours," I applaud Boyle for taking the road less travelled.
","**Warning: Huge spoilers ahead as I will write about the film's ending.With a plot this minimalistic, one could forgive director Danny Boyle if he had made a ten-minute short instead of a ninety-minute feature length film about a guy who went hitchhiking and got his right arm crushed in between a rock wall and a huge boulder deep in a crevice of a remote canyon. Based on an incredible true story, 127 Hours is a visual recount of the ordeal an immobile Aron Ralston went through for five daysbefore he decided to cut off his entire arm with a cheap penknife and escape to freedom.James Franco plays Ralston in a mostly one-man show that exhibits wit, self-depreciating humor, determination, and the will to survive. To his credit, Franco manages to pull everything off quite remarkably despite being stuck in one spot for nearly the entire film. Much like Ryan Renolds in Buried (2010), a claustrophobic horror film about one man's predicament of being buried alive in a coffin, Franco's character earns our sympathy not because his situation is extremely dire, but because he is unlucky to land in such a predicament that is of no fault of his.He has a camcorder with him, and Boyle uses this device of his to design sequences that add much needed humor and the occasional (false) optimism to the film to positively weaken the seriousness of the film's subject matter. There is only a limited number of angles a director can choose to shoot such a film, but Boyle's trademark hyperkinetic visual style allows him to venture into areas that are uncommon even in mainstream cinema, let alone in films of this strange new sub-genre – for instance, the exaggerated psychology of the protagonist, and the visual-aural parallelization of certain actions in the climax of the film.Boyle explores the mental state of Ralston through sequences of dreams, nightmares, and premonitions – scenes that would be more at home in a fantasy or horror film, but surprisingly works well in a realist film like 127 Hours. Of course, the overwhelming use of such 'mentalistic' material (and Boyle does indulge in one too many) makes the film more lively and engaging, but at the expense of emotional depth, which the film somewhat lacks. Yes, we feel Ralston's physical pain, and take pride at his eventual triumph, but the motivation of his to decide to cut his arm off is not as clearly fleshed out as it should.The film's editing creates visual energy with the use of multiple split- screens and quick cuts. And just as well, for I doubt anyone would take pleasure at seeing a long take of Ralston slowly slicing his arm off. Still, that amputation sequence is as graphic as it can get, so those with a weak heart would be advised to look away. Boyle reduces (or for some, increases) the intensity of the sequence through the visual-aural parallelization that I mentioned earlier. For example, he marries the breaking of the human bone to the sound of a gunshot ('bam!'), and the touching of a nerve to the sharp plucking of a string of an electric guitar ('twang!').127 Hours, for better or worse, is unmistakably a Boyle film – energetic, rhythmic, and visually creative, but it also comes with its fair share of excess baggage that like a sponge absorbs much of the film's potential emotional power. I sincerely believe Boyle has taken the material as far as he possibly could, and I applaud him for taking the road less travelled. At the same time, I also wonder what could have been if Werner Herzog stumbled upon Ralston's story and made a powerful, provocative documentary instead.

"I Love You, Man"," I Love You, Man may not be very, very hilarious, but it certainly has a soul. And for a rom-com, that is as close as being godly.
","Is this a Judd Apatow film? No, it is a John Hamburg film. I Love You, Man is one of the more accomplished romantic-comedies of the year. And it is hard to believe that Apatow was not involved. After the success of The 40-Year Old Virgin (2005) and Knocked Up (2007), Apatow's singular influence in a new modern sub-genre - adult rom-coms with a heart - has perhaps finally found a non-Apatow offering a worthy entry to add to its cause.Peter Klaven is getting married soon. He is popular with girls but he has no close male friends. So when it is time to select a best man for his wedding, he is faced with the embarrassing prospect of selecting nobody. At an open house, he meets Sydney Fife and what comes next is the beginning of a very beautiful friendship. The film works out to be like a generic comedy about the bonds of brotherhood and what not. But unlike its kind, the film is made with a kind of zest and energy that invite viewers to embrace it.I Love You, Man is written and directed by Hamburg, whose strong focus on character development here is the film's most outstanding achievement. The characters Peter (Paul Rudd) and Sydney (Jason Segel) are wonderfully portrayed by their actors whose roles are not only excellently-written, they are naturally appealing to viewers as well because they seem like the kind of people we might know. The chemistry between Rudd and Segel is just right, never awkward, and never gayish.The film's dialogue is another plus point. This is where similarities to Apatow's films become more noticeable. The script is saucy with a fair number of references to sexual behavior from blowjobs to masturbation and one amusing observation of someone attempting to fart secretly. Yet most laughs are generated by the remarkable comic timing that comes from Rudd especially in scenes when his character fumbles socially with men and during initial nervous attempts at conversing with Sydney.Most crucially, Hamburg's film has such a light-hearted honesty to it that it is difficult not to enjoy the tonic. It is the kind of film that you would love to see again, maybe this time with another bro-mate. Please stay for the end credits for more scenes of Rudd, Segel and their friends. Till this point, the characters have been so well-developed (including supporting ones) that one glance at their faces and you could probably describe their Facebook profile without seeing it and getting it real close. I Love You, Man may not be very, very hilarious, but it certainly has a soul. And for a rom-com, that is as close as being godly.SCORE: 8/10 (www.filmnomenon.blogspot.com) All rights reserved!",8,1,2,24 July 2010
Finding Nemo," There will be some who might develop a fetish for clownfishes after watching Nemo, but I wouldn't blame them at all.
","Whenever a Pixar film is just about to be released in theaters, there's this lively buzz around town. In every way redefining animated pictures, Pixar's films over the years have not only captured the wildest imagination of kids, but adults too. The filmmakers clearly have worked out an incredible formula for producing flop-proof feature-length cartoons year after year. In the tradition of Pixar, Finding Nemo represents the industry leader's most family oriented work to date.Finding Nemo is strong in content (a trait of Pixar films), offering a well-defined story with lovely characters that are incredibly well-personified. It's an animated feature with immense substance and quality that allows most viewers to be willingly absorbed into the colourful underwater world. There's an exciting blend of form and movement on display which might just make any moviegoer go, 'Boy, I wanna be a fish!' There will be debate whether Finding Nemo is still the best Pixar film to date. For me, it's Monsters Inc. But there's a charming aspect to this sea adventure that's able to connect to viewers more than any other Pixar offerings.While it may seem at times overly indulgent in terms of animation, and colour, Finding Nemo never loses sight of its focus and wittiness, telling a warm-hearted story that consistently touches our hearts. There will be some who might develop a fetish for clownfishes after watching Nemo, but I wouldn't blame them at all. There will also be some who will be disappointed when they find out that their little pet fish can't mutter a single word. I wouldn't blame them either.GRADE: A- (www.filmnomenon.blogspot.com) All rights reserved.",9,0,2,8 January 2011
X-Men Origins: Wolverine," X-Men Origins: Wolverine defies low expectations and critical disdain and will reward viewers who expect nothing less than an action spectacle.
","Another year, another superhero origin film. Seven years ago, it was Sam Raimi's Spiderman. Four years ago, it was Christopher Nolan's Batman Begins. Last year it was Jon Favreau's Iron Man. Now add X-Men Origins: Wolverine to the fray. The director is Gavin Hood, the Oscar-winning director of Tsoti (2005), a powerful South African drama centering on a hoodlum's search for redemption under an oppressive society and amidst the crushing weight of poverty. With his newest project, he tackles a new and different face to filmmaking, a switch from independent cinema to mainstream commercialism. X-Men Origins: Wolverine stars Hugh Jackman as John Logan a.k.a Wolverine for the fourth time after Bryan Singer's two excellent features and a disappointing Brett Ratner sequel. I do not rate the Australian very highly as an actor as he has a limit to his acting range. However, he very much nails his character here in a display of ferocious power and boundless energy. In addition, Jackman has a very strong supporting actor in Liev Schreiber, who plays Victor Creed a.k.a Sabretooth (Logan's close ally-turned-nemesis) with equal badass-ness. In recent years, Schreiber (Defiance, The Painted Veil) has established himself to be an excellent screen presence in numerous multi-faceted roles that are at the very least compelling. There is some controversy over who actually helmed the action sequences. Richard Donner (Superman, Lethal Weapon), one the film's executive producers says that he has a hand in many of them. But Hood dismisses this since he is credited as the director of the film. Whatever the issue, it is not important because the film features solid action and generally entertains for the bulk of its length as a result of rapid pacing and some remarkable visual effects. An example is a standout sequence following Wolverine's narrow escape from a barn in a retro motorcycle, having his hands or metallic claws full dealing with enemy Hummers and a chopper with loads of ammunition. There are flaws to the narrative; there is a sense of predictability as to how situations will evolve and how the fates of some characters will ensue. As a consolation for fans, not all is resolved at the end of the film and this leaves room for a sequel or another X-Men origin movie. X- Men Origins: Wolverine defies low expectations and critical disdain and will reward viewers who expect nothing less than an action spectacle. Those who demand more on their plates will leave the theaters with not as wide a smile as the rest. GRADE: B- (7/10 or 3 stars)www.filmnomenon.blogspot.comall rights reserved.",7,1,3,3 June 2011
The Others," The Others is assured of a spot in the upper echelons of contemporary horror cinema where films like The Sixth Sense and The Orphanage reside.
","Alejandro Amenabar's first foray into English-language filmmaking is a largely successful one. One of the most striking filmmakers to emerge in the late 90s, Amenabar is a skillful craftsman whose talent extends beyond directing into screen writing and also into film score composition. Born in Chile but raised in Spain, the director of acclaimed dramas such as Open Your Eyes (1997) and the Oscar-winning The Sea Inside (2004) gives us a fine addition to the horror genre with The Others, a mainstream production made with authority.The Others is assured of a spot in the upper echelons of contemporary horror cinema where films like Shyamalan's The Sixth Sense (1999) and Bayona's The Orphanage (2007) reside. In an uninformed reality, Amenabar's film comes across as a fusion between the two above-mentioned pictures. That being said, it would make more sense to chronologically observe the influences each has had on one another over the years. Similar to Shyamalan's film, The Others has a climatic twist at the end (don't worry, there are no spoilers ahead) which equals in ambitiousness but strangely unmatched in terms of shock value.The Others stars an excellent Nicole Kidman in the lead role as the mother of two children whom are photosensitive (read: allergic to sunlight) and must be kept perpetually in the dark (an intriguing plot device). The huge house they live in does have a sinister past of a ghostly nature. What seems like a straightforward ghost story turns into an exercise in atmospheric mood setting. Cinematographer Javier Aguirresarobe creates lingering, almost elegant-like shots of the exterior of the house which is nearly always hidden in thick fog. For interior scenes it is mostly lit by candlelight (a requirement of the plot device), giving an eerie glow that is both warm yet chilling.Speaking of chills, The Others has one prolonged spine-tingling sequence in the final third: the two children 'escape' from the confines of their room in the middle of the night only to find themselves in a small graveyard with suspicious servants pursuing them. The mood setting here achieves its pinnacle. Amenabar does stick to the rigid expectations of the genre, but he explores them with a fresh approach mainly through its unconventional plot.The role of darkness versus light is reversed in this film. Here, the children seek solace in the dark but are traumatized by daylight. Their mother, on the other hand, feels uncomfortable in darkness but is at ease when it is bright. This allows Amenabar to tap on the fears of the characters and to create tension in two extreme settings. The Others is clever filmmaking, boasts artistry and is clear in its execution. At its heart, it is a film about challenging one's beliefs and the need to stand true and firm when these beliefs are challenged.SCORE: 8/10 (www.filmnomeno.blogspot.com) All rights reserved!",8,2,4,8 September 2010
Troy," Petersen takes a simple Homer poem, and constructs a film that is likely to sweep most viewers away, albeit with not as much passion as the Greeks.
","Historical action epics were the craze of the town in the early 2000s. Started by Ridley Scott's Oscar-winning Gladiator, many other directors followed suit to cash in on the trend. Most of them are failures (King Arthur, Alexander), while some suffer mixed results (Kingdom Of Heaven), but Troy surprisingly gives a good account of itself. Led by Wolfgang Petersen (of Das Boot fame), Troy is a solid motion picture that highly entertains. Apart from the visual spectacle, and the exciting battle sequences, it boasts a good-looking cast. Brad Pitt, Eric Bana, Orlando Bloom provide abundant male testosterone, but I suspect men weren't so vain at that time.It's an expensive film, with lots of special effects integrated into live action shots. It sometimes feels 'computerized', but the effects are not badly done. It's a bit long, running at over 160 minutes, and gets a little sluggish at times as a result of the sketchy screenplay. Some may debate over the historical accuracy of Troy; I may suggest they go rent a documentary. Forget about accuracy, films (especially from Hollywood) don't really give a damn.

The Hustler," The film that established the great Paul Newman as one of the leading actors of his generation.
","Perhaps the film that established the great Paul Newman as one of the leading actors of his generation was The Hustler. Landing his second Oscar nomination, Newman's role as Eddie Felson was memorable for a number of reasons, the most obvious of which was the intensity of his acting, which came across as cool yet charismatic. Newman's natural flair for acting with composure had seen him racked up more than half a dozen Oscar nominations, though his only competitive win came in 1986 for Martin Scorsese's The Color of Money , a sequel of sorts to The Hustler.Directed by Robert Rossen (not to be confused with the French director Robert Bresson), The Hustler is often thought to be his greatest film. While I have not seen many of his works to give an opinion, I feel that it is an excellent film but not a great one. Shot in black-and-white, Rossen's film is 'no more about pool than Raging Bull (1980) is about boxing' (Berardinelli). It is a character-driven film that pits Eddie not against his opponents but with himself. Drunk and obsessive about winning, Eddie succumbs to his character flaws in his long-drawn match against Minnesota Fats (Jackie Gleason) in the film's early 'action set- piece'.Much of the film after that does not quite reside in pool hustling. Instead Rossen calls to attention Eddie's romantic relationship with Sarah Packard (Piper Laurie). Their romance is not seen as a subplot to the film's main narrative but another lens to look at Eddie's character. With Sarah, Eddie is warm and nice, though there are occasional instances of volatility. But put a cue in his hands and he is a changed man. And for the worst, if I may add. One of the film's supporting characters, a rich cutthroat gambler named Bert Gordon (George C. Scott), calls Eddie a 'born loser' and one who is without character.It is this quest to find that 'character' that sets Eddie to build towards it, to prove himself that not only is he the greatest pool player anyone has ever seen, but also one that, win or lose, acknowledges the value of integrity, something he has failed to see for most of his life, and as a consequence in numerous situations, failed him as well. The Hustler, while quite effective as a conventional character study on human behavior and emotions, is less potent when it comes to dealing with the psyche of its lead character. The film does not seem to have the prerequisite grittiness to flesh out Eddie's psychological motivation (or ambiguity).Further, Newman's image as a clean and likable, albeit rebellious dude, coupled with the film's polished cinematography by Eugen Schufftan, who won an Oscar for his work here, suggest that The Hustler is not cut out to be a deep, complex, and raw character study in the mould of Taxi Driver (1976). Here, Rossen takes his film to a level that is enough for us to understand and root for Eddie. He refuses to go further and seeks instead to give us the pleasure of watching Newman and co. strut their stuff on the pool table. Speaking of which, those shots are actually quite exciting to look at.GRADE: B+ (8/10 or 3.5 stars)www.filmnomenon.blogspot.comAll rights reserved.",8,1,1,18 May 2011
Juno," Page spouts lines after lines of fascinating remarks with such eloquence that not falling in love with her character would have been sinful.
","One of 2007's most anticipated Oscar-nominated pictures, Juno is this year's Little Miss Sunshine; a quirky, witty, and highly original film that deserves its four Academy Award nominations, and might just snatch a couple of wins during Oscar night. While some may debunk its originality because it's the third film this year after Judd Apatow's Knocked Up and Greg Mottola's Superbad to touch on the increasingly discussed subject matter of teenage delinquency - here being teenage pregnancy.Jason Reitman (Thank You For Smoking) earns a slightly undeserved Best Director nomination for Juno; there are limited opportunities for Reitman to show off his directing talents. His Oscar berth should have been given either to Ridley Scott or Tim Burton for American Gangster and Sweeney Todd respectively, both of which showcase far more accomplished directorial ability. But most importantly, Juno succeeds because of two major factors - Ellen Page's performance in the title role and Diablo Cody's screenplay.Together, Page and Cody form a lethal partnership. Cody writes with considerable skill while Page has the charisma and persona to pull off such a demanding role as Juno. I believe there's no other young actress whom could have digested and performed Cody's script to perfection. She spouts lines after lines of fascinating remarks with such eloquence that not falling in love with her character would have been sinful.Comparing with Knocked Up, Juno falls short of giving viewers that overwhelming, it-sweeps-me-off-my-feet movie experience that is apparent in the former. Since Juno runs at just over ninety minutes, it feels short-lived; Knocked Up, on the other hand, clocked more than two hours and thus feels more complete and ultimately, more satisfying. In my opinion, Juno will not win Best Picture or Best Director, although there are pretty good scoring chances at the other two nominated categories. One thing's for sure though - Ellen Page is undoubtedly the next hottest property of Hollywood.SCORE: 8/10 (www.filmnomenon.blogspot.com) All rights reserved!",8,2,7,10 August 2010
Match Point," The old master still has some tricks up his sleeves.
","The first of his 'unofficial' London trilogy, Woody Allen's Match Point is later followed by Scoop (2006) and Cassandra's Dream (2007), both of which are unrelated to Match Point or to one another other than that they are set in Britain's capital. Critically-acclaimed and considered to be the director's best in a long while, Match Point does not feel like a traditional Allen picture (e.g. the use of British accents, and the lack of the director's 'voice'). Gone also are the witty, neurotic lines of humor and its tragicomic characters.The 1970s and 1980s have seen the Oscar-winning writer-director make one excellent film after another. But a 1990s and early 2000s 'slump' sees him make only an occasional decent picture amid average ones. Match Point is the result of the American filmmaking legend looking into the mirror and realizing a change of formula is essential to keep up with the times. Allen reinvents himself in a surprisingly assured take on the low-key crime-thriller genre camouflaged by a dominant romantic drama that deals with marriage, extramarital affairs, love and lust.The film consists of three principal characters: Chris, Chloe, and Nola. Chris, a hardworking but poor tennis instructor, marries Chloe and is set up for life because his father-in-law is wealthy and has given him a key corporate position in his company. However, Chris' true passion lies with Nola, his brother-in-law's sensuous and insecure fiancée who is struggling as an actress. As Chris gets deeper into his affair with Nola, the latter becomes unpredictable and overpowering, and later becomes a source of tension and frustration for Chris who turns increasingly paranoid to the thought of being exposed.Match Point features sharp analytical writing which conveys very realistically the emotional and psychological states of mind of each major character, especially that of Chris and Nola. The most affecting display comes from Scarlett Johansson whose tortured performance as Nola earns her a Golden Globe nomination for Best Supporting Actress. At the beginning, Allen theorizes that when the tennis ball hits the top of the net, with a bit of luck it will drop on your opponent's side and you win. A similar scenario is further explored during the final quarter of the film where luck plays a huge role in determining the fates of people.In an unexpected (and chilling) turn of events near the finale, Allen shows us his skill in misdirection. Up to that point, we are led to believe that we know how the film is going to end, but the old master still has some tricks up his sleeves. His near-brilliant sleigh of hand elevates Match Point to something more than just a decent drama. There are some situational flaws though, which on hindsight could have embarrassed Allen because if the viewer is discerning enough, he or she could see that there are loopholes in the execution of that misdirection sequence. Fortunately for Allen, the ball lands away from him.SCORE: 8/10 (www.filmnomenon.blogspot.com) All rights reserved!",8,1,1,14 August 2010
Milk," Milk may be one of the year's more curious offerings, but it lacks the overall substance and energy that Oliver Stone politically-themed films have in abundance.
","Who would watch a two hour-plus biographical account of a homosexual politician? Ask Gus Van Sant and he would probably say none. Ask everyone else, and they would probably reply 'If Sean Penn is in the movie, I'd better catch it.' They better do because Penn is phenomenal in the role as Harvey Milk, California's first openly gay politician to be elected and then brutally assassinated while serving his term in office. The rise of Harvey Milk from a nobody to one of the most fascinating personalities to light up '70s American political history is documented with incredible detail. Penn is joined with a stellar supporting cast which includes James Franco (Pineapple Express, 2008) and Diego Luna (Y Tu Mama Tambien, 2001), who portray as gay associates of Harvey Milk.Van Sant does not shy away from showing numerous scenes of homoerotic content. There are eye-opening smooching scenes amongst the male members of the cast (many involving Penn's character) and these are quite tastefully done. Moreover, there are sex scenes but they are non-graphic and are often filmed in shadowy and dim surroundings. In fact, Milk is the most accessible mainstream gay picture to hit the screens since Lee Ang's breakthrough award-winning hit, Brokeback Mountain (2005). Its documentary-drama style approach means that Milk can be enjoyed at the most basic level of intellectual entertainment or to a deeper extent, as an immersive educative experience.Van Sant, as always the creative oddball in modern American cinema, has injected his film with occasional stamps of unconventional filmmaking techniques. One scene shows a man speaking on the phone; it slowly turns into a platter of numerous smaller frames of other people answering their phone calls. With this, Van Sant has efficiently conveyed the message of 'all-round effective communication' to viewers in just a matter of seconds. In addition, Van Sant has opted to shoot some of the scenes of California in raw and grainy images, providing a realistic glimpse of street-life that dates back to thirty years.Milk has been nominated for Best Picture and Director for this year's Academy Awards; though if the biopic were to win an Oscar, it would probably be Penn's award than anyone else. Josh Brolin has a supporting actor nomination here as political rival, Dan White, but his performance shows otherwise and it will be a joke if he wins. Milk may be one of the year's more curious offerings, but it lacks the overall substance and energy that Oliver Stone politically-themed films have in abundance. However, it is still quite a favorable return to mainstream cinema for Van Sant since Good Will Hunting (1997).GRADE: B+ (www.filmnomenon.blogspot.com) All rights reserved.",8,0,3,5 January 2011
Cloverfield," Cloverfield is a sensation, a movie event that's ought to be experienced.
","The first major film of 2008 happens to be the most debatable. You either like it or loathe it. Few will choose to sit on the fence. Yes, I give it an 8/10, pretty high by my strict standards, but nevertheless very justified. As a critic points out, Cloverfield is to monster movies what The Blair Witch Project is to horror. Possibly only the second film to emulate the marketing and filming techniques of The Blair Witch Project, Cloverfield's success in drawing mass appeal from everywhere lies from the word-of-mouth rather than relying wholesale on creative posters or spectacular trailers. The 'camcorder' technique or what I term as the 'camera on a trampoline (COAT)' technique has been used sparsely in many films, even as recent as The Bourne Ultimatum. Apart from The Blair Witch Project, it has never been used to compose a full feature-length film before. Forget about Godzilla, or The Host, or a whole bunch of monster flicks you can find at your nearest DVD rental store, Cloverfield is probably the most uniquely assembled film of that genre ever. It kicks you in the butt, and pulls you by the neck, dragging you into an experience that cinema rarely offers - witnessing a monster attack in New York through the lens of a video cam. How I must emphasize that Cloverfield fulfills that precisely. There's no introduction, no ending, no clear explanation on the monster's origin or its demise, and there's bad scripting, editing, and directing - all the characteristics of a tape from a camcorder. What the heck is Cloverfield? Is it even a movie? Why should I put up with something that makes me feel dizzy for ninety minutes? If you did ask such questions, then you weren't mentally prepared for the picture. I have to admit though there are a couple of major flaws. If it's a tape recording, then why is the sound and sound editing (which should be nominated for Oscars) so clear and undistorted? And why is there no dust or soot smearing some part of the lens? Ignoring these flaws mean that Cloverfield is not as realistic as it should have been. But it's a compromise which most viewers will agree. After all, a movie has to be of a certain respectable quality. Cloverfield is a sensation, a movie event that's ought to be experienced (regardless of how it affects the viewer). Yes, it's risky business. The filmmakers dare to try something unorthodox even if it means theater walkouts, viewers' condemnations, and even possible box-office failure. Cloverfield is an important film because it's deviative rather than derivative. To some of us, it's a gem. For the rest, it's an unforgiving, I-feel-like-puking exercise in visual disorientation.

The Way Back," The Way Back is a beautiful film, well-directed, and acted, but let down by poor characterizations and a screenplay that is too far-fetched to be plausible.
","A seven-year gap separates Peter Weir's last film, Master and Commander (2003), and his latest, The Way Back. The respected Australian director of Witness (1985), Dead Poets Society (1989) and The Truman Show (1998) delivers a visually spectacular film that pits Man's unwavering will to survive against the merciless forces of nature.Inspired by true events, Weir's film is set in the 1940s during a time when Eastern Europe was besieged by Nazism and Stalinism. Told from the perspective of a Polish man named Janusz (Jim Sturgess) accused by his wife of spying for enemy nations, The Way Back chronicles his escape together with a few other men from a POW camp in remote Soviet Union.Weir's handling of his cast is remarkable. He places them in hostile environments and pushes them to act as their characters' circumstances dictate. In one scene, out of extreme hunger, a man scrambles to pick up a millipede and chews it in his mouth. In another scene, a group of men desperately laps up mud water.Despite the unbearable conditions, the actors manage to dramatically convey the physical torture and suffering their characters are forced to endure as they trek thousands of miles on foot over freezing Siberian snow, arid Mongolian desert, and across the Himalayas to India where they finally find freedom.Shot by Russell Boyd, the Oscar-winning cinematographer of Master and Commander, The Way Back features a number of wide, aerial shots that show the fragility of Man in an environment that, on many occasions, threaten to consume him. The events that occur in this film are at times so incredible that it seems more fictional as the clock ticks. How could anyone possibly survive such a death trek?A sudden appearance by Saoirse Ronan, who plays a Polish girl, midway through the film seems like a character conjured up out of thin air. Moreover, she looks too clean and beautiful for someone who has been lost in the woods for days, without food and water. Speaking of sudden occurrences, Colin Farrell, who plays a snobbish and volatile man, also leaves the group midway with a reason that is not clearly backed by character motivation.All these are surprising because Weir is quite an excellent writer, and many of his films are memorable for their characters. The performances, however, are top-notch, with special credit going to Farrell, who normally does not command the screen that well. In a nutshell, The Way Back is a beautiful film, well-directed, and acted, but let down by poor characterizations and a screenplay that is too far-fetched to be plausible.GRADE: B- (www.filmnomenon.blogspot.com) All rights reserved!",7,6,12,18 March 2011
The Town," The Town is a generic crime-thriller that offers nothing more than two hours of average entertainment.
","I react with some measure of disappointment to Ben Affleck's newest feature, The Town. Starring himself, Jeremy Renner (The Hurt Locker, 2009), and Rebecca Hall (Vicky Cristina Barcelona, 2008), this crime-heist thriller is set in Charlestown, Boston, where every other day there seems to be an armed robbery happening. Produced by Graham King, who won the Best Picture Oscar for Scorsese's The Departed (2006), which is also set in Boston, The Town is a generic crime-thriller that offers nothing more than two hours of average entertainment.The film follows Affleck's character, Doug , as he faces a turning point in his life. He leads a gang of masked armed robbers but wants to quit a life of crime and change for good. His dream of a better future is spurred on by a coincidental romance with Claire (Hall), who was an unharmed victim (and a key witness) of one of his heist schemes. To complicate things, Claire does not know that Doug was involved in that heist. Worse, his partner-in-crime, James (Renner), a volatile, Joe Pesci-like madman, discovers their relationship and threatens to kill her.There is a scene with these three characters together, sitting around a table at an outdoor café. This is perhaps the only moment in the film that causes a significant degree of uneasiness and tension in the viewer. Sad to say, much of the entire film does not live up to its 'thriller' tag. As a crime-thriller, it is a borderline passable entry. That is not good enough for Affleck, whose debut directing effort Gone Baby Gone has shown that he is capable of making a noteworthy thriller.The Town has reasonably well-executed action sequences, but they amount to nothing if the story is one-dimensional, and the characters underdeveloped. The romance between Doug and Claire, which I feel to be the film's central narrative thread, is clearly lacking in development, thus when the film closes with their separation, and ends with the line 'see you again, this side or the other', it feels unconvincing.The Town's standout performance is credited to Renner. He steals the screen every time he appears, but his characterization is limited to the stereotypical caricature of a bad-ass gangster. Nevertheless, Renner's performance helps to engage the viewer whenever the story fails to do so. As for Affleck's performance, there is no surprise in store for us. He is weak in acting and should stick to directing instead. But hey, I am starting to have doubts about his directing too.SCORE: 6/10 (www.filmnomenon.blogspot.com) All rights reserved!",6,100,157,29 October 2010
Lost in Translation," The production is excellent, letting us experience modern Japan without actually traveling there. But, the scope of the film is rather narrow.
","Sofia Coppola is trying desperately to emulate her father's (Francis Ford Coppola) success. Her third film is no Godfather, but nonetheless, it's considered the best she has done so far. Lost In Translation is the type of film that can have scores ranging from 1/10 to 9/10, depending on individual taste. For me, it's a solidly-directed film, but it could have been a whole lot better.The emotional range of the film is quite limited. A heartbreaking scene doesn't make you go teary; A funny scene doesn't make you laugh out like a maniac. The construct of the film doesn't allow that to happen, no matter how hard the leading cast tries (Bill Murray, and Scarlett Johansson have wonderful chemistry though). Cinematography of Japan's bustling nightlife is a plus point. The screenplay is not as wonderful as it's claimed to be. I believe it won an Oscar only because the other nominees are weaker.The point I'm trying to make is that this is not a well-defined film. The production is excellent, letting us experience modern Japan without actually traveling there. But, the scope of the film is rather narrow. Lost In Translation is the kind of film that viewers watch because they want to learn about how people communicate, and not because they want to be sucked in, and be blown away by the experience.GRADE: B (www.filmnomenon.blogspot.com) All rights reserved.",8,1,3,11 January 2011
Barry Lyndon," Barry Lyndon is cinema at its purest, and is without a doubt one of its great achievements.
","This is one film that many will not even think of attempting. It is three hours in length, it is based on a novel written in 1844 documenting the rise and fall of an Irishman who becomes part of 18th century English nobility, and it stars no one popular. But there is one compelling reason that dwarfs all excuses not to watch the film - it is directed by the late Stanley Kubrick. The director of influential film masterpieces such as 2001: A Space Odyssey (1968), Dr. Strangelove (1964), and A Clockwork Orange (1971), Kubrick is easily one of the greatest filmmakers of our time.Barry Lyndon is probably Kubrick's most underrated film, an extraordinary picture that so vividly evokes the time and mood of a distant past that one might have been inclined to believe that Kubrick had actually taken the hassle to travel back in time to film this. Shot by cinematographer John Alcott, who wins one of the film's four Oscars, Barry Lyndon is as beautiful as films get. Picturesque views of medieval England are captured with a wide lens that frequently zooms away from a focal point, giving 'eye-opening' visuals of classy architecture and elegiac costumes lived in and worn respectively by the noble people.Tremendous effort is made to film most of the interior scenes in natural light and in the 'enchanting hour' when everything radiates with misty perfection. Yet the most technically impressive aspect of Barry Lyndon remains to be the filming of interiors at night with the creative use of strategically-positioned candlelights which lend an almost warm, surreal touch to the film's already organic quality. Kubrick's eye for detail and his quest for the perfect shot (whose obsession with them is well-documented later in his career) will reward patient viewers because Barry Lyndon is simply innovative filmmaking in an old-fashioned setting.Ryan O'Neal plays the titular character Barry Lyndon opposite Marisa Berenson who is remarkable in her role as the widowed Lady Lyndon. Adapted from William Makepeace Thackeray's picaresque novel and written for the screen by Kubrick himself, the film is smartly split into two major acts - the unexpected rise of Redmond Barry who later becomes Barry Lyndon, and the decline of the latter whose acrimonious relationship with his stepson Lord Bullingdon primarily leads to his inevitable downfall.Despite the subject matter, Barry Lyndon is more engaging than one might have expected. Kubrick's use of classical music is a major reason and it could not have been more apt here with great selections like Handel's Sarabande. Another factor is the inclusion of several sequences of farcical duels between Barry and his 'nemesis' and war battles which feature brilliant tracking shots.Kubrick's films are mostly devoid of real emotions; they are mechanical, cold observations of society that are seldom optimistic. Barry Lyndon is no exception. Its frozen characters seem unable to dictate their lives; they feel trapped in Kubrick's masterful manipulation of a medium that so rarely embraces such a genre. Highly recommended, Barry Lyndon is cinema at its purest, and is without a doubt one of its great achievements.SCORE: 9.5/10 (www.filmnomenon.blogspot.com) All rights reserved!",10,2,4,26 August 2010
The Bourne Ultimatum," The pacing of The Bourne Ultimatum is top-notch, giving viewers two hours of excitement no roller coaster ride could ever dream to give.
","Paul Greengrass might wish to consider getting a camera tripod. The Bourne Ultimatum is a pure exercise in 'Parkinson's camera'; Greengrass gleefully indulges in shaky photography which results in a blinding action thriller. I wouldn't fault him because he has the cinematic intelligence to justify his decision to film the final chapter of the Bourne trilogy on a vibrating bed. However, he goes a little too much in certain scenes, jerking the lens about even during slower face-to-face conversations.The storyline packs a punch, delivering an intricate plot of a former spy hunted by government agents who are determine to thwart the former from recollecting his mysterious past. The result is a well-conceived screenplay that makes James Bond films look like child's play. The Bourne Ultimatum is inherently a foot chase over many cities from New York to Madrid. I've to applaud Greengrass' for building up several of the film's twenty minute chase sequences' to heart-pounding levels through the clever use of snappy editing and the above-mentioned Parkinson's camera approach.The final climax is somewhat anti-climatic and predictable. But that does not numb our satisfaction for The Bourne Ultimatum. It's one of the leading exponents of the spy-thriller in recent years. Matt Damon and a highly talented supporting cast lend enough quality to the film's emotional core whilst the transition from its previous installment, The Bourne Supremacy, is fluid. Greengrass might be accused of overusing flashbacks (which are sometimes distracting), but most of us will acknowledge that the pacing of The Bourne Ultimatum is top-notch, giving viewers two hours of excitement no roller coaster ride could ever dream to give.SCORE: 8/10 (www.filmnomenon.blogspot.com) All rights reserved!",8,0,1,25 July 2010
Fargo," The genius of the Coens is their ability to fuse strong, uncompromising violence with moments of dark humor.
","There is a quick-glance subtitle at the start of Fargo that says the film is based on a true story. What a smart prank by the sneaky Coens. Never trust 'em brothers, for Fargo is a tale that borders on the near incredulous. Made in 1996 on a shoestring budget with a small cast of effective performers, Fargo is often considered by critics to be the quintessential Coen film – quirky, odd, violent and darkly amusing. Despite having their films financed by major distributors, the Coens have all these years remained a truly independent unit, always finding themselves a corner in the sandbox where they have full liberty to build their dream sandcastle. I feel that Fargo is slightly overrated; heck it is not even as good as No Country For Old Men, their recent Oscar-winning triumph. However, Fargo has some of the best acting performances in a Coen film, especially from William H. Macy (Jerry) and Frances McDormand (Marge). Jerry and Marge are two characters that have personalities that are polar opposites of each other. Jerry is a fumbling, nervous, dim-witted salesman who has a huge money problem; on the other hand, Marge is a persevering, quick-thinking, and calm pregnant police chief who stumbles upon one of the strangest kidnapping-murder cases ever seen this side of Minnesota. Despite the outstanding displays, the characters seem distant and we do not care whether they live or die. For once, the Coens focused too much on creating the perfect setting, the perfect story, thus neglecting the importance of giving emotional value to the characters they have written. These flaws of Fargo are somewhat covered by the same thing that covers the landscape of Minnesota - heavy snow. The cinematography by the legendary Roger Deakins is the most striking aspect of Fargo. Building frame after frame of long, composed takes of spreads of white, he manages to bring a sense of gloom to the mood of the film. The genius of the Coens is their ability to fuse strong, uncompromising violence with moments of dark humor. We see that in No Country For Old Men, but it is in Fargo where they actually perfected this macabre formula. Fargo is good, but not great. It is the kind of film that will get better with repeated viewings. Well, ain't all Coen pictures? But for the originality of their screenplay, and their obsession to make the perfect police thriller, darn tootin', I will salute the Coens.

Predator," Through somewhat interesting visual effects, the filmmakers are able to sustain the film with almost intolerable suspense, and occasionally heart-stopping moments.
","Predator represents how sci-fi horror is so marketable. After James Cameron's Aliens, Predator offers another thrill for the mass audience, combining similar story structure with an instantly recognisable film star - Arnold Schwarzenegger (in a role that suits him perfectly). Through somewhat interesting visual effects, the filmmakers are able to sustain the film with almost intolerable suspense, and occasionally heart-stopping moments.Predator is solid fare, but it doesn't match the standards set by Aliens. While McTiernan has a steady hand in what he's doing, he's unable to capture the 'dread feel' associated with Aliens. Nevertheless, the action doesn't tire viewers on repeated viewings, and the film has a lasting quality to it. It's not a bad way to spend two hours, anyway.SCORE: 8.5/10 (www.filmnomenon.blogspot.com) All rights reserved!",9,3,4,2 August 2010
The Thing," A milestone in horror cinema.
","John Carpenter can be regarded as an enigma in American cinema. Admired as one of the leading horror practitioners of the post-Star Wars era, his subsequent output since the mid-80s far from reflect the brilliant filmmaking skills he once wielded. Carpenter regards The Thing as the first of his 'Apocalypse Trilogy' together with Prince Of Darkness (1987) and They Live (1988). In a morbid way, it is perhaps an apt description for a filmmaker whose incredible slide from being lauded as an influential horror master to a run-of-the-mill director of forgettable junk is nothing short of, well, apocalyptic.It is best to look at The Thing as the last of Carpenter's 'Great Horror Trilogy' which includes Halloween (1978) and The Fog (1980). The sudden, inexplicable loss of ability thereafter to even create averagely decent genre pictures is mysterious, and I shall leave it at that. The Thing is science-fiction horror in the mould of Ridley Scott's Alien (1979) but it is set on Earth in the Antarctic continent. Written by Bill Lancaster who loosely based his screenplay on John W. Campbell's story Who Goes There?, The Thing is also an (even better) remake of Howard Hawks' The Thing From Another World (1951).Several men working at a remote research station discovers an alien buried in the snow, or what is left of the alien's imprint in the snow. Now unfrozen, the alien enters their facility in the most unlikeliest (but later quite obvious) of means, especially after the realization that it can change its identity by taking over the bodies of living organisms begins to send shockwaves down the twelve-men team. Right from the start, Carpenter builds a sense of isolation and gloom with wide, sweeping shots of the vast, barren, icy landscape as a chopper flies above it.Slowly, paranoia takes over when the alien starts to attack and imitate some of the men. Guessing games are played and mutual trust becomes a rare commodity. While Alien employs the 'less is more' technique to frighten audiences, The Thing is the direct opposite. Carpenter and his crew of visual and makeup effects artists bring the terror right-in-your-face via some of the most grotesque images ever conceived. Short of describing how nightmarish they are, these images could be imagined as a cross between David Cronenberg (The Fly, 1986; Dead Ringers, 1988) and Sam Raimi (Evil Dead, 1982; Evil Dead II, 1987), a fusion of surrealistic violence, and bodily invasion gore which are hallmarks of '80s horror.If there is a flaw to the film, it is the lack of character development of the supporting roles. This comes as a result of having too many characters (twelve!), more so than from a weak screenplay. It seems like who lives or dies is unimportant because first, the film does not intend to work (other than that of fear) on our pathos, and second, the deaths of these characters (oxymoronically ugly and beautiful) are excuses to raise the bar for cinematic horror to artistic heights. Carpenter could have tightened the film up with fewer supporting characters, so that each could be given the chance to match up (and play along) to Kurt Russell's excellent performance, giving the film an 'acting balance' akin to an ensemble cast rather than Russell and eleven extras.Carpenter, who usually scores his own films, pushes music composition duties to Ennio Morricone whose minimalist soundscape accompanied by a thumping beat successfully help to force an uneasy atmosphere of existential dread upon the viewer. The Thing is a milestone in horror cinema (that I will not argue against). However, I feel it is not the masterpiece that many have made it out to be. But then again, who could ever forget what Carpenter has achieved here? SCORE: 8/10 (www.filmnomenon.blogspot.com) All rights reserved!",8,0,1,20 November 2010
Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows: Part 1," The Deathly Hallows is as much about the fight against evil as it is about the sexual maturity of Harry, Ron, and Hermione.
","The decision to split into two parts the last installment of the most popular screen adaptation of a book series since J.R.R Tolkien's The Lord of the Rings is a double-edged sword. It allows director David Yates to set up what would be an exciting and anticipatory finale, an epic conclusion to the well-loved story of a boy wizard which began ten years ago. However, this very setup means that Part I naturally suffers from the consequence of its own doing, that is, it promises so much, but delivers so little. We have to wait for six months for the emotional payoff that is inevitable.While it might not be fair to judge a film by watching only half of it, I would turn the tables on Warner Brothers and say that it is also not fair to charge viewers twice for what is essentially one (long) film. Happy paying fans are another matter altogether. Speaking of which, fans should approach The Deathly Hallows: Part 1 with a measure of caution. Gone are the days of fairy-tale like magic and adventure. Now, these are dark times; a war is brewing, people are terrorized, and every evil being is out to kill Harry Potter.The Deathly Hallows can be classified as fantasy-horror (purist fans would baulk at this). There are a number of intense imageries that are frightening and unnerving, most of which involving a huge snake. Moreover, the frequent use of desaturated flashbacks of which the villain Voldermort has a significant presence in, are at times unsettling. Surprisingly, for a film that is more about set-up than not, there is a fair amount of action, if you understand action as protagonists being chased through the woods or engaging in not fistfights but wand duels.In the context of fantasy, the visual effects are excellent, be it the black streaks across the pale blue sky symbolizing the paintbrush strokes of evil, or the glowing goat that appears to Harry in the dark woods. If there is something consistent throughout all Harry Potter films, apart from the acting of the lead trio, it is the strong sense of location. In Deathly Hallows, spectacular day shots of the vast openness are contrasted with the silent dread that accompanies night scenes in the eerie woods.The Deathly Hallows is as much about the fight against evil as it is about the sexual maturity of Harry, Ron, and Hermione. Past the pubescent stage, the three friends now face awkward moments with one another. Ron likes Hermione, but it is not a secret that Harry also has an affection for Hermione. It would be interesting to see how Yates handles this aspect of their characters in the final film. And more importantly, what it may mean for a whole generation of post-pubescent fans learning about love.SCORE: 7/10 (www.filmnomenon.blogspot.com) All rights reserved!",7,0,1,22 November 2010
Kung Fu Panda 2," While not as fun and carefree as the first installment, Kung Fu Panda 2 still packs a solid punch.
","What's there not to like about a fat panda demonstrating his prowess in the art of kung fu fighting? Po (Jack Black) returns in the second installment of the much loved Dreamworks' Animation hit Kung Fu Panda (2008), once again teaming up with his fellow band of warriors to try to defeat a villain, Lord Shen (Gary Oldman), who harbors the evil dream of conquering China with his latest invention – a cannonball weapon. Very much adhering to the action-comedy formula laid down by its prequel, Kung Fu Panda 2 is a blast to watch on the big screen.Directed by newcomer Jennifer Yuh, Kung Fu Panda 2 impresses with its attention to cultural detail. The computer-generated visuals give a distinctive Oriental feel and many of the majestic architecture bear striking resemblances to that of Miyazaki's Spirited Away (2001), though they are not as magical or poetic as the hand-drawn quality of the latter. Yuh's direction is excellent for someone embarking on her debut feature. The film never lacks energy and vigor, and packs quite a lot of action into ninety minutes, though it could be said that there is a slight overdose of action scenes, which sometimes can be chaotic to follow.Unlike sequels that see no growth in the development of their lead characters, Kung Fu Panda 2 tackles Po's backstory through a commanding use of intermittent flashbacks that are depicted using interesting 'paper-cut style' animation. This provides ample development to Po's character and gives us a strong reason to empathize with him. Surprisingly, the filmmakers handle the emotional nuances of Po's early years very well, with an especially touching scene involving his mother abandoning him in a wooden crate of fruits and vegetables while hunting wolves presumably lead her to her death.Kung Fu Panda 2 references popular culture, though not as explicitly as some of Pixar's films like Toy Story (1995) or Finding Nemo (2003). Most notable ones include a reference to Jackie Chan (who voices one of the characters here) movies involving trying to avoid signs on top of a moving vehicle, and a Terminator 2: Judgment Day (1991) reference that sees Po 'coming back up' on a rotating wheel ala Schwarzenegger. While not as fun and carefree as the first installment, Kung Fu Panda 2 still packs a solid punch. I do look forward to the certainty of a part three, which will most likely involve an emotional paternal struggle over Po.GRADE: B+ (8/10 or 3.5 stars)www.filmnomenon.blogspot.comAll rights reserved.",8,0,3,27 May 2011
North by Northwest," With this film, Hitchcock has nearly perfected one of the fundamentals of thrillers - the picaresque pursuit.
","What would it be like if Hitchcock stop directing suspense dramas and work on a purely escapist flick? The answer is North By Northwest. The most entertaining motion picture ever made by the legendary filmmaker, North By Northwest has an immense influence on 'Hollywood chase films', making them significant fixtures in contemporary cinema, from The Fugitive to the Bourne trilogy. Nominated for three Oscars including Best Original Screenplay, this film ranks almost as highly as three of the director's greatest critical achievements - Vertigo, Rear Window, and Psycho. North By Northwest stars Cary Grant (The Philadelphia Story, Notorious) in a role that was written for James Stewart (It's A Wonderful Life, Mr. Smith Goes To Washington) whom Hitchcock claimed was too old for the role (ironically, Grant was four years older leading to rumors of a professional dispute between Hitchcock and Stewart). In less than five minutes, Hitchcock remarkably establishes the plot and paints Grant's character, Roger, as a well-dressed but fiercely sarcastic man with a strong sense of self-respect and integrity. It does not take long for viewers to get acquainted with him, who plummets from one perplexing situation to another as he tries to make sense of what is going on. By chance, he meets an icy-cold blond, Eve (played by Eva Marie Saint) whose motives appear suspect. In a world of deceit and treachery, who is there to trust? North By Northwest is as much a comedy as a mystery-thriller. Its screenplay is a delightful blend of dark humor (most of the hilarious lines are uttered by Grant) and cliffhanger moments. Speaking of which, the film contains two of Hitchcock's most celebrated set-pieces - the tense crop dusting sequence, and the final Mount Rushmore climax. The pacing is just right except for an abrupt jump-cut scene at the end which makes the aforementioned climax a little short-lived. With this film, Hitchcock has nearly perfected one of the fundamentals of thrillers - the picaresque pursuit. Recommended!

Salt," Salt is one of the most preposterous movies of the year and you would be better off giving it a miss.
","Who is Salt? The tagline of Philip Noyce's new film asks. Don't bother to find out because the answer is irrelevant. Angelina Jolie plays Evelyn Salt, a highly-skilled spy who works for the CIA, or does she not? Let me say it again: Angelina Jolie plays Evelyn Salt, a highly-skilled spy who works for Russian intelligence, or does she not? There you see, the answer is not relevant. What you do need to know is this: Salt is one of the most preposterous movies of the year and you would be better off giving it a miss.Well-known for the emotionally potent 'stolen generation' drama Rabbit-Proof Fence (2002), and films like The Quiet American (2002), and Dead Calm (1989), Noyce is an Australian director whose considerable talent has not been allowed to shine as brightly as he would have wished after he joined Hollywood in the early 1990s, making sub-par Tom Clancy adaptations like Patriot Games (1992), and Clear and Present Danger (1994), and average films such as The Saint (1997), and The Bone Collector (1999).Jolie is like Franka Potente in Tykwer's Run Lola Run (1998), except that she is running away from authorities trying to arrest her, rather than running to prevent someone from committing a crime. Her performance is adequate for an action picture; she has steely determination and reportedly did most of her own stunts. However, her character traits are only superficially fleshed out. This is the screenplay's fault, which in a moment, I would launch a tirade at its writer.Salt is generally quite well-directed by Noyce, so it is not entirely his fault that the film fails. To his credit, the action sequences are handled well, and there is some effort in generating suspense. However, they lack credibility. The scene that puts the final nail in believability is that of Jolie hurtling level by level down a lift shaft by jumping towards its corners, in pursuit of an elevator with armed men. And also, how many times have we seen someone in an action film jump onto a moving truck from a bridge ten meters above and suffer no broken bones? So many times that it seems safe enough to try.Writer Kurt Wimmer, who was responsible for the mess that is Sphere (1998), and Ultraviolet (2006), cannot even tell an average story right, let alone a half-decent one. Salt could have been an action-thriller with a clever plot, something like a spy reworking of Andrew Davis' The Fugitive (1993). Alas, the result is a story that excites as much as a trip to the grocery store. The motivations of Jolie's character are never known, which is always a bad thing for action films because actions are responses to motivations.Is she a double-agent? A triple-agent? Or heck, an agent within an agent? There is no impetus to really look for an answer. Stay away from this, pass the pepper instead.SCORE: 4.5/10 (www.filmnomenon.blogspot.com) All rights reserved!",5,0,4,6 August 2010
The Battle of Algiers," A film with universal themes of freedom and independence, and a global reach that would resonate strongly with anyone who believes in those ideals.
","There is a scene in The Battle of Algiers that left me in awe. It is a wide shot of a road with a right turn up a slope. Hundreds of Algerians pack the street in a strike for independence while a huge French tank rolls across the tarmac towards these people, forcing them to the sidewalks. The scene's unbelievable realism stems from director Gillo Pontecorvo's decision to shoot on location, use local non-professional actors, and achieving a grainy, organic visual style through hand-held cameras and newsreel style editing.The entire film is shot in this manner. As a result, The Battle of Algiers is often considered a breakthrough in cinema, the first of its kind. It is a fictional film based on something that has happened in real life, and of which it portrays so realistically that it is hard to believe that it is not a two-hour long documentary footage.Released only four years after the independence of Algeria, Pontecorvo's film touches upon a nation's suffering and hope during the French occupation, detailing the violent activities of the National Liberation Front (FLN in abbreviated French), a revolutionary group that was systematically wiped out but whose sacrificial efforts became etched in the collective psyche of the Algerians, prompting them to rise up to their oppressors.The film is also noted especially for its outstanding direction, of which Pontecorvo deservedly earned an Oscar nomination for. Scenes where hundreds of innocent Algerians roam the streets only to be gunned down by the French military evoke a powerful sense of unjust and tragedy. The use of wide, composed shots and long lens allow the situation to unfold almost like a live event, its visual scope unparalleled at that time.Of equal impressiveness are scenes of bombs planted by the FLN that explode in a number of crowded places. The camera captures the real-time explosions as the non-actors try frantically to get away from the blast. Considering that this was the sixties when computer visual effects were not in existence yet, these dangerous feats could only be filmed as they happened.Even though Pontecorvo's film tries to emphasize on the plight of the Algerians (with disturbing scenes of torture), it is still a fair, unbiased take on the French military. It portrays Colonel Mathieu (Jean Martin), the chief officer in charge of restoring order to the colony, as someone who understands and sympathizes with the enemy, attempting to seek cooperation with them rather than trying to annihilate them.Pontecorvo's use of Ennio Morricone's deeply haunting music as accompaniment to scenes of Algerian victims of bombings (and later, French civilian victims in another sequence) reflects the collateral effect of war on those caught in the crossfire. In many sequences, a running radio commentary delivering propagandistic messages is broadcasted, heightening the sense of realism already so vividly brought to the screen.Widely regarded as one of cinema's most important films, The Battle of Algiers is still not widely seen by the mainstream audience. That needs to change because this is a masterpiece, a film with universal themes of freedom and independence, and a global reach that would resonate strongly with anyone who believes in those ideals.SCORE: 9.5/10 (www.filmnomenon.blogspot.com) All rights reserved!",10,0,1,26 August 2010
Edward Scissorhands," The comparatively more powerful finale redeems the experience of sitting through a build-up that is less than inspired.
","Arguably Tim Burton's most well-known, and possibly most beloved film in his entire filmography, Edward Scissorhands is a heartwarming, and at times dark story about a life-size man-doll with scissors for hands. His name is Edward and is played by a young Johnny Depp in his first role for Burton. Depp would later form a productive partnership with the eccentric director in the next two decades making pictures such as Ed Wood (1994), Sleepy Hollow (1999), and Sweeny Todd: The Demon Barber of Fleet Street (2007).Edward Scissorhands is a conventional story told in flashback that is bookended by two scenes involving a grandmother telling a bedtime story to her granddaughter, who asked about the origin of snow. The story is about Edward who, in the distant past, lived in a castle on the mountaintop. His creator died before fixing human arms on him, thus the scissors for hands. He was lonely. Until one day, a woman from the community down below came by to sell cosmetics. She brought him to her home and made Edward part of her family. Predictably, Edward became infatuated with the woman's daughter, Kim (played by Winona Ryder), who slowly fell in love with him.Despite Burton telling the story like a fairy tale, Edward Scissorhands does not end up like one. It is a bittersweet film that tries to seek for the viewer's sympathy. With a visual style that is unmistakably Burton's, the film unfortunately does not have a script good enough to match the visual flair. The dialogue is dull and falls in the territory of clichés. Very often, Edward is made the subject of ridicule in his new town, and even though it is done for humor purposes, too much reliance on these so-called gags to propel what little original plot it has unsurprisingly backfires.That being said, in a film with a draggy second act, it has a moment that would probably be etched in the minds of viewers – the ice dance sequence. Although shortlived, that sequence involving a beautiful display of 'man'-made snowfall is surprisingly touching and I would even extend my praise by calling it arguably the most magical moment in all of Burton's films. Danny Elfman's dreamy, choral score also heightens the sequence dramatically. The musical themes repeat in the last act, and by then, they truly flow with the narrative. The comparatively more powerful finale redeems the experience of sitting through a build-up that is less than inspired. Not a must-watch unless you are a fan of Burton and Depp.GRADE: B- (www.filmnomenon.blogspot.com) All rights reserved.",7,0,1,26 February 2011
The White Ribbon," The White Ribbon is very much the quintessential art film – slowly-paced, beautifully-shot, and thought-provoking.
","Michael Haneke's Palme d'Or winning The White Ribbon is one of the great foreign language films of 2009. Shot in color but was desaturated to black-and-white during post-production, the film is very much the quintessential art film – slowly-paced, beautifully-shot, and thought-provoking. It is an admirable effort by the much respected director of Funny Games (1997), The Piano Teacher (2001), and Cache (2005). Haneke's intense interest in exploring the human condition, especially of its evil nature, in many of his films highlights his bleak view of humanity. In The White Ribbon, it is no different.Very much a mystery-drama, Haneke's film is set during the days before the start of WWI in a small, picturesque German village that appears ordinary at first glance but is actually sinister within. Narrated by an old schoolteacher whom we don't see (we only see his young self), the film recalls the strange incidents that took place in this village back when he was young and still teaching there. The entire film is a record of what happened, and in black-and-white, it looks like a historical record. Many mistake this as a true story. It is not, but it could pave the way for us to understand how fascism rose to be a tyrannical force in Europe in the late 1930s.Haneke only presents a factual account of these strange incidents, which are mostly deliberate acts of torture and violence. He doesn't give clues as to who the culprit is. The genius of Haneke is that all his characters (even supporting ones) are developed in such a way that invites both trust and suspicion. Even though the villagers and the rich baron's family form a close-knit community, there seems to be a cloud of mutual distrust. Even the children are curiously distanced from their authoritative parents.Christian Berger's cinematography is hauntingly beautiful, and when accompanied by spells of silence (the film has no music score) that are interwoven with dialogue and ambient sounds, it becomes at times mystifying. Haneke's masterful grasp of editing and camera placement produce some very eerie moments such as a sequence shot in the dark showing a toddler at home trying to find his sister in the middle of the night, a prelude to a psychologically disturbing event that reveals a darker face of one of the film's key characters.The performances in the film are uniformly excellent, with special mention going to Leonie Benesch, who plays Eva, a shy and sweet village girl whom the schoolteacher falls in love with. Haneke's handling of the numerous child actors is also remarkable not only because some of them are made to undergo a quite grueling experience, but also of the serious subject matter of the film, which straddles into adult territory. In the mould of the traditional whodunit, The White Ribbon offers plenty of mystery and the requisite suspense (in the mood-building sense). However, as any Haneke film would attest, it leaves us with no sense of closure and forces the viewer to react intellectually.In The White Ribbon, Haneke has collectively and succinctly addressed issues of racism, class struggle, authoritarianism, sexual abuse, infidelity, incest, and violence, providing a foreshadowing of the evil that would come two decades later. While there is far from any causal link between the events that happened in this quiet village to Hitler's rise to power in Europe, Haneke's disconcerting portrait of a community whose children are raised in an uncomforting environment of hate and discrimination provides us with an understanding of how the seed of evil can easily take root in the most innocent of beings.

Tropic Thunder," Tropic Thunder has many rough edges to be smoothened out, and Stiller's direction could have been more polished. Nevertheless, this is still the spoof film to beat.
","Tropic Thunder is director Ben Stiller's third feature length film after The Cable Guy and Zoolander. More popular in front of the camera than behind one, Stiller earns his dough mainly from doing hit comedies such as The Royal Tenenbaums and There's Something About Mary. His films can range from the really funny to the not-so-funny-that-it-is-funny; which is not much of a difference actually since his acting chops are limited to only one genre. I have observed that since the start of last year Stiller's acting output has been on a decline, making increasingly low-value comedies like The Heartbreak Kid.Tropic Thunder in which Stiller also stars keeps him afloat for the time being. It is a box-office success in America. That is unsurprising because it is also arguably the best 'parody film' in recent years. Tropic Thunder erases the cinematic nightmare inflicted by hopeless spoof flicks such as Disaster Movie, Epic Movie and Meet The Spartans that have been populating our screens. Despite the critical stigma that surrounds these kinds of films, Stiller has been mostly successful in attempting to make fun of the war genre. Oliver Stone's Platoon, Steven Spielberg's Saving Private Ryan, and most notably, Francis Ford Coppola's Apocalypse Now have become the latest movies to get the spoof treatment.Stiller's inexperience as a director shows in Tropic Thunder. There are scenes which could have been left out, including two supposedly funny song-and-dance sequences in the middle and at the end, which in addition to being jarring in a (spoofed) war film, remains unnecessary to the film's objective. Tropic Thunder's screenplay is not tight enough; narrative transitions are filmsy and apart from Robert Downey Jr., the other actors' characters remain thinly developed. That being said, Downey Jr. gives an excellent performance by playing Kirk Lazarus, an Aussie method actor who undergoes facial surgery to transform into a black African-American. Because of this, there was a controversy during the film's initial release as it was seen by some as a pro-racism stunt. Nevertheless, Tropic Thunder survived the backlash.There are disturbing images of bloody decapitated heads and limbs which are almost mandatory in a war picture. Tropic Thunder plays on this and viewers' expectations, deliberately upping the gore and 'eww!' factor with sprinkles of black humor added in. Don't miss the start of the film because there is a farcical pre-movie trailer segment which although is separate from the actual film, helps to introduce the main players of Tropic Thunder and set the mood for a rollicking good two hours ahead. Tropic Thunder has many rough edges to be smoothened out, and Stiller's direction could have been more polished. Nevertheless, this is still the spoof film to beat.GRADE: B- (www.filmnomenon.blogspot.com) All rights reserved!",7,0,1,23 December 2010
No Country for Old Men," There's no doubt that No Country For Old Men is one of the top ten films of 2007.
","Nominated for eight Academy Awards, No Country For Old Men is one of the two front runners for this year's Oscars along with Paul Thomas Anderson's There Will Be Blood. Head-to-head, the latter emerges the victor. However, No Country For Old Men is by no means a pushover, giving Anderson's film a genuine run for its money. Directed and written for the screen by the immensely gifted Oscar-winning filmmakers The Coen Brothers (Fargo, The Big Lebowski) and based on the Cormac McCarthy novel of the same name, this motion picture is made to win awards in mind. For their latest masterpiece, The Coen Brothers make the decision to stay with their tried-and-tested route, using conservative storytelling and filming techniques that serve the plot well although it lacks the scope and inventiveness of Anderson's direction in There Will Be Blood. The thing I love about the Coen Brothers is their ability to crank up the suspense to immensely unbearable levels with absolutely minimal use of sound or music. The material here presents them with many opportunities to perfect their blend of silent suspense.There are three main characters played by Josh Brolin, Spanish actor Javier Bardem, and the evergreen Tommy Lee Jones. All give sterling performances with the standout being Bardem whose character, Anton Chigurh, is perhaps the most frightening ever, since Anthony Hopkins' cannibalistic Hannibal Lecter in Silence Of The Lambs. Armed with a high-pressure gas canister as a murderous weapon and wearing a mop-like hairstyle, Chigurh is a villain who does not know the meaning of mercy. You wouldn't want to run into him in a crowded shopping mall, let alone in a dark alley at night. No Country For Old Men can be said to be a modern Western, an update for the next generation of movie-goers. The unexpected ending may be a sore point for some, but it will be highly appreciated by discerning viewers who demand something more though-provoking than what current movies can offer. The Coen Brothers' comeback film will be likely to dominate during Oscar night. There's no doubt that No Country For Old Men is one of the top ten films of 2007.

Batman Begins," In Nolan's hands, Batman Begins is a masterful action picture that continues to impress with its brawn and wit.
","Looking back at Batman Begins, the first installment of Christopher Nolan's Batman trilogy, in conjunction with its sequel The Dark Knight (2008), it is clearly evident that Nolan's vision of the popular comic book hero is nothing less than the sum of the parts that make up a truly well-defined and realistically-developed anti-hero.In Nolan's world, Batman is as humanly flawed as Bruce Wayne himself, and the writer-director makes sure that this is communicated to the audience. In one scene, Batman escapes by jumping off a roof in a chase sequence. He lands clumsily and noisily on a retractable ladder that extends itself.Christian Bale who plays Batman/Bruce delivers a performance that is neither showy nor restrained. Really, it is not about the intensity of the performance but about the motivations behind the actions that define who Batman is. Even so, by the end of Batman Begins, it is still unclear who Batman really is, though this is explored with more depth in the sequel.This is where Nolan hits that rare, illuminating spot that gives us an anti-hero who is well-developed yet has issues with his own identity. Batman is a symbol of hope for Gotham not by fate but by choice, and even then, Nolan throws that symbol in murky waters.While The Dark Knight is widely considered to be the epitome of the superhero genre, though I would use the term 'superhero' very loosely here, it would be fatal to see Batman Begins as an inferior companion to one of the great crime films of the 2000s.Batman Begins is in my opinion a deeper film than its sequel because it lays the philosophical foundation for a character whose motivation to act not only lies in guilt and anger, but also in the desire to confront the very fear that incapacitated him not to act.Batman Begins is a film about memory, like a faded photograph. It plunges head-on into Bruce's backstory and situates it in the present, providing ample illustration of the transformative character arc that Bruce would go through, and presenting an ambivalent identity he continues to struggle to make sense of in The Dark Knight.Wally Pfister's cinematography here is occasionally tinted with golden brown, alluding to that essence of memory. Compare this to the cold and dark bluish tint in the sequel, and it is quite apparent that Batman Begins is a more humanistic and less cynical picture, though it remains considerably dark by genre standards.This is Nolan's first foray into big-budget Hollywood filmmaking, and he treats it as serious as an art-house filmmaker embarking on a personal, independent project. Despite its role as a tentpole film for Warner Brothers, Batman Begins is distinctively a Nolan picture – a solid blend of realist action and smart ideas.Although conceptually different from Tim Burton's more imaginative vision of the caped crusader as seen in Batman (1989) and Batman Returns (1992), Nolan dares to challenge fans' perceptions of how a superhero film should be like. By focusing on Batman as a human character with an existential issue that is worth investing our emotions in, Nolan has avoided caricaturizing superheroes as masked vigilantes who are comfortable in their own artificial skins.In Nolan's hands, Batman Begins is a masterful action picture that continues to impress with its brawn and wit. With The Dark Knight Rises slated for release in the summer of 2012, Nolan is under intense pressure to deliver a picture that not only should ideally match The Dark Knight in epic boldness, but should also bring viewers back full circle to the philosophical roots of Batman Begins, and answer the most important question of all: What is Batman?GRADE: A (www.filmnomenon.blogspot.com) All rights reserved.",9,0,1,4 April 2011
Before Sunset," Enough food for thought for a good night's contemplation of the meaning of love.
","As online film critic James Berardinelli puts it, Before Sunset is 'one of those exceedingly rare instances in which the motivation for a sequel is creative, not financial.' There, he summarizes in a single, meaningful statement the value this Richard Linklater film has for viewers sophisticated enough to appreciate the artistry of its concept. The sequel to the critically acclaimed Before Sunrise (1995), the aptly- titled Before Sunset may not have the allure and magic of the first film, but it still manages to be fresh in its own unique way.In Before Sunset, the characters Jesse (Ethan Hawke) and Celine (Julie Delpy) meet by chance at a Paris bookstore where the former is holding a book-signing session with the press. They take a spontaneous walk down the streets of Paris, enjoy coffee at a café, and take a boat ride before Jesse has to take a flight back home. Unlike in the first film in which they spent an entire day and night together, both characters have only about an hour now to interact and catch up after nine whole years not knowing whether they would meet again.Before Sunset's story unfolds in real-time. The film's runtime is literally the amount of time that they have together. With the beautiful, and at times, historical backdrop of Paris in the background, we follow the two characters in a number of long takes as we are brought up to speed on the major events that have occurred in their lives for the last decade. While Jesse looks scruffier and Celine more aged, their chemistry with each other remains undeniably strong, though this is characterized by natural awkwardness in the first half-hour.As shown from their screen writing credit, Hawke and Delpy have apparently worked very closely with Linklater on the crafting of their characters and dialogue. Their naturalistic acting punctuated by moments of improvisation gives the film a-slice-of-reality feeling that remains true to the essence of the director's conceptual vision. Youthful, starry-eyed love as explored in the first film now makes way for themes about responsibility, commitment, marriage, and regrets. In a way, Before Sunset is more pessimistic in outlook, not only seen through the world-weary eyes of its two leads, but its constraint of time also limits the possibility of a second chance at love with 'the one that got away'.There is a quite potent scene in a car that sees Celine angrily airing her grievances at Jesse, who appears taken aback by her uncharacteristic behavior. It shows that while innately we stay roughly the same, we do change with time, often with a more mature but more cynical lens to view things. Shot at a leisurely pace with dialogue that admittedly does not engage as much as in the first film, Before Sunset is still a quite remarkable document of two highly identifiable characters at the crossroads of their lives, pondering what could have been if circumstances had unfolded differently for them.If Linklater considers to do another sequel in the next couple of years, it would be more welcomed than not. Otherwise, this two-part filmed romance is enough food for thought for a good night's contemplation of the meaning of love, and all the complexities and subtleties that come with it.GRADE: B+ (8/10 or 3.5 stars)www.filmnomenon.blogspot.comAll rights reserved.",8,0,0,29 June 2011
The Pianist," The Pianist is a realistic account of one of the darkest periods of humanity through the melancholic eyes of Adrien Brody's Szpilman
","Winning three Oscars including Best Director and the top prize at Cannes, The Pianist is Roman Polanski's lifelong dream come true. Polanski shot to international stardom with Knife In The Water in 1962, a film about sexual rivalry. He would revisit the theme of sex in his next few films such as Repulsion and Cul-De-Sac. His best known work remains to be the incomparable Chinatown, one of the few truly defining films of 70s American cinema. The Pianist somehow feels like an anomaly in Polanski's body of work. It is a historical drama about Nazi persecution in WWII Poland. Yet it is undoubtedly his most personal film to date. A Jew himself, Polanski is born of Polish parents who were sent to concentration camp. His maturity in handling a tough subject matter like the Holocaust can be observed by the manner in which he directed the film. Unlike Spielberg's Schindler's List, Polanski has shot The Pianist in full color. The Oscar-nominated cinematography by Pawel Edelman (Ray, Oliver Twist) is stunning. The elegant architecture of Warsaw radiates in many scenes, and the texture of every frame is so smooth that the film seems like a seamless storyboard of expertly-directed and edited sequences one after another, though there are some pacing problems that mar the viewing experience. There is one hauntingly exquisite scene towards the end of the film showing Adrien Brody's character, Szpilman, climbing over a wall. As he makes it to the other side, the camera elevates slowly from behind the wall to reveal a desolate piece of snow-covered land with rows of wrecked houses either side of a wide, gaping path. This scene represents the culmination of the impressive cinematographic vision of both Polanski and Edelman for The Pianist. Adrien Brody who wins the Oscar cuts a display of sympathy. One of the most apt casting decisions in recent years, Brody embodies not so much the physicality of the Jews, but rather a figure of restrained calmness that typifies Jews of that time. Knowing the fate of his race under the brutal stranglehold of Hitler, Szpilman somewhat escapes certain death, riding on luck most of the time, and the support of close 'underground' allies. Unlike Schindler's List, The Pianist only elicits muted emotional responses from the audience. While harrowing at times, Polanski's film lacks the power and emotional depth that made Spielberg's black-and- white masterpiece one of the greatest films of all-time. Another flaw of The Pianist lies in the second half during scenes of Szpilman hiding out alone in one apartment after another in a German-occupied region. During this time, the film moves the slowest, appearing lackluster and flat, somewhat bereft of hope that the remainder of the film might return to its compelling first half. Nevertheless, The Pianist is a realistic account of one of the darkest periods of humanity through the melancholic eyes of Adrien Brody's Szpilman, one of Poland's most well-known musicians. The film signifies a return to form for Polanski whom faded away in the late 80s. He is past his prime, but once in a while, he is still capable of jolting fans of cinema awake with beautiful motion pictures like this. Recommended!

Revolutionary Road," Revolutionary Road is like a psychoanalysis of our mundane lives.
","Sam Mendes' journey as a film director comes full circle with his latest feature - Revolutionary Road, a motion picture that paints a bleak portrait of the American suburban life; a theme he has explored in his debut Oscar-winning film, American Beauty (1999) before embarking on a creative curve with acclaimed films such as the crime drama Road To Perdition (2002), and the biographical war picture Jarhead (2005). The British filmmaker returns to what he does best, weaving a story around drama-centric performances that open the window to human nature. Since James Cameron's Titanic (1997), Leonardo DiCaprio (The Departed, Gangs Of New York) and Kate Winslet (Little Children, The Reader) have embarked on envious, ambitious acting careers, establishing themselves as A-list actors whom are not afraid of tackling demanding dramatic roles. In Revolutionary Road, they are reunited as the Wheelers, lovers in a marriage which from a blissful start becomes increasingly strained along the way. Their performances are a standout. Individually, they give commanding displays that are unfortunately not recognized by the Academy. But it is their performances collectively that is more impressive; their screen- friendly chemistry still remains after more than a decade. The star of the supporting cast is Michael Shannon, whose character John is a recently-discharged-mental-patient-who-obviously-has-not-recovered neighbor whose occasional awkward visits to the Wheelers together with his parents bring more grief and anger than jubilation. There is a spectacular dramatic set-piece in the second half of the film that pits John against the Wheelers in a furious war of words. Although viewers are able to see it coming, the build-up to the film is extraordinary. Prior to John's visit, the Wheelers have a massively intense quarrel over marital issues which are interrupted by the visitors. Thus, the mood is set brilliantly for an inevitable bitter exchange of words of volcanic proportions. For almost a decade, Oscar-nominated composer Thomas Newman (Wall.E, Finding Nemo) has had a strong contribution towards the aural look of Mendes' pictures. In this film, the score is less distinct, but it is no less Mendes-resque. The last sequence casts a shadow of gloom and offers no glimmer of optimism, which means the film has the potential to end powerfully. However, it is not executed well enough to bring a satisfactory sense of closure to the lives of these people. Revolutionary Road is like a psychoanalysis of our mundane lives. Well for most of us. While it may not showcase Mendes in top form, the film's intention is clear and it leaves us with a sour aftertaste: Are we too good for anybody?

Lawrence of Arabia," Lawrence Of Arabia is altogether an overrated motion picture.
","Just like Orson Welles' Citizen Kane, another great film disappoints me. While I appreciate both films for its technical quality, and understand the reason why they're considered top films, I have to confess that both aren't my favourites. Lawrence Of Arabia is David Lean at his prime. While I prefer his earlier work The Bridge On River Kwai, nothing beats what Lean has accomplished here.The strength of Lawrence Of Arabia is the cinematography. The desert sceneries are shot in a manner that reflects the desolateness, and starkness of the natural conditions, yet capturing the still beauty of the desert. Unfortunately, unless you have a cinema at your disposal, Lawrence Of Arabia isn't going to work well on television. It has to be experienced in a theatre, with a screen so wide it can fulfill what the filmmakers intended to achieve - an unforgettable journey into the heart of one of the world's most uninhabitable places.Peter O'Toole stars as the title character in a performance that borders on the colossal to the forgettable. Two factors that make me look down on the film are the repetitive dialogue (what a bland script!) used by the cast, as well as the content the film offers. There are epics that are more involving, and entertaining such as Ben-Hur, and Dances With Wolves. This, sadly, has comparatively nothing much to offer except for the outstanding photography. In my eyes, Lawrence Of Arabia is altogether an overrated motion picture.GRADE: B+ (www.filmnomenon.blogspot.com) All rights reserved!",9,1,9,12 December 2010
JFK," For students of film, JFK is a valuable source. For the rest of us, JFK is one of the greatest films we will ever see.
","Oliver Stone. The director whose name is synonymous with Vietnam War flicks and controversial political pictures. He is the brains behind films like Platoon, Born On The Fourth Of July, Natural Born Killers, Nixon, Wall Street, and JFK. He seldom fails, and apart from making the dismal Alexander a few years back, Stone is still one of America's most daring and influential filmmakers.JFK is the best picture Stone has ever made. There's little reason to believe he will ever surpass what he has accomplished for JFK. The film runs for more than three hours, and with the overwhelming amount of content and the humongous scope of the plot, it's unbelievable that Stone managed to complete the production of the film within two years. He expertly explains and explores the conspiracies that surround the assassination of President Kennedy back in the 1960s through spellbinding color and black-and-white images, and the recreation of the chain of sequences that lead to the assassination and its convoluted aftermath.Was he murdered by the lone shooter Lee Harvey Oswald? Or were there others involved? Did the US military, FBI, CIA conspire to kill their own President? What about the 'magic bullet' theory? Where's the Zapruder film kept? Was there a massive cover-up by the highest authorities of the American government, including its judiciary system? These are all aptly discussed in the film, providing crucial insights, and occasionally leaving more questions unanswered, challenging viewers to think and respond.Effective individual performances from A-listers like Kevin Costner, Tommy Lee Jones, Joe Pesci, Gary Oldman, Kevin Bacon, and Donald Sutherland combine flawlessly, resulting in one of the most extensive and well-assembled cast in the history of cinema. JFK won only two Oscars for best cinematography and film editing in a year dominated by Jonathan Demme's Silence Of The Lambs, a meager return for one of the best films of the century. The Academy owes Oliver Stone another best picture and director award.After critiquing hundreds of films over the last couple of years, JFK still remains rooted in the second spot of my Personal Top 100, only bettered by Steven Spielberg's Schindler's List. It is, in my opinion, the best edited film of all-time. The manner in which Oliver Stone filmed JFK through the use of disturbing flashback images, rapid-fire editing, and intertwining it with suspenseful pulsating rhythms by composer John Williams, and knowing it's all based on a terribly true event makes it one of the most chilling movie experiences ever. For students of film, JFK is a valuable source.

The Incredibles," The action sequences are also much better than anything I've witnessed in Michael Bay's flicks.
","Toys? Check. Bugs? Check. Fishes? Check. Monsters? Check. And now superheroes. The Incredibles, winning two Oscars from four nominations, breaks new ground in animation technology. Brad Bird (The Iron Giant) directs and writes the all-too-familiar story of superheroes trying to save the day. But with the wit and enthusiasm that has never been seen before.Forget about Batman, or Spiderman, this is a creative and original story that will warm the hearts of most viewers. Those who still think animation is for lollipop-licking kids might want to consider the possibility of altering their perception.The Incredibles is a family-oriented motion picture that adults (never mind kids) will enjoy. When kids ask their parents if they like cartoons like Dinosaur or Madagascar, the latter will comment, 'Yeah, I absolutely love it!', but in pretense so as not to offend their child. It's highly unlikely that the scenario will repeat for The Incredibles.It boasts glorious, realistic animation, and unbelievable human characters that most will associate with. There's enough clever humor to keep the film in high spirits. The action sequences are also much better than anything I've witnessed in Michael Bay's flicks.Repeated viewings only heighten one's admiration for the film. In terms of technical excellence, this is probably the best Pixar film to date. It packs a lot within two hours, providing solid entertainment at its best. While I stress that Monsters Inc. is still my personal favorite, The Incredibles has overachieved to the extent that the latest Pixar 'flop' offering, Cars, look uninspired in comparison.One can only hope that Brad Bird's next collaboration with Pixar in Ratatouille (releasing in late 2007) will be able to restore some much-needed confidence.SCORE: 9/10 (www.filmnomenon.blogspot.com) All rights reserved!",9,0,1,24 July 2010
I Am Legend," I Am Dismal could have been a more apt title.
","One of the most highly anticipated films of 2007 turned out to be a dud. I Am Legend, a remake of sorts, and an adaptation of Richard Matheson novel, has a premise that is potentially explosive, one that will make the cash register sing. A sci-fi horror in nature, I Am Legend will attract viewers just by the plot itself and of course, the charisma of its star, Will Smith.Smith is typecast as someone with a lonely existence, but with a zest for life and a personal quest to reverse the deadly effects of a plague that has turned most into carnivorous, light-terrorized zombies that thrive menacingly when dusk breaks. His performance is ever-improving, maybe it comes from being recently Oscar-nominated. The rest of the cast is abysmal though, maybe it comes from being CGI-ed. The zombies while effectively created, does not frighten as much in the second half the film than in the first.That being said, I Am Legend is a movie of two halves. A promising start that depicts New York City in the most desolate and lifeless ever, with added eerie suspense to match, to an utterly garbage second half that is both cliché and dumb, and contrastingly much less scary. For most parts of the film, it treads on thin ice, threatening to become another 'one of those horror disaster flicks'. Occasionally, the ice breaks, but Smith saves the day.Director Francis Lawrence (Constantine) doesn't have a proved track record; it's no wonder that I Am Legend is this year's most high-profile failure. This is a playground for Steven Spielberg (War Of The Worlds) and James Cameron (Aliens). One wonders what magic they would have infused into the film. I Am Legend is poorly-edited, with sudden cuts, as well as equally sudden loud bangs and crashes that irritates more than it scares. The score by James Newton Howard (The Village) is also one of his worst of his career.Sometimes bad films are at the very least entertaining, think Transformers, or for that matter Die Hard 4.0. I Am Legend lacks substance, and will disappoint fans of the genre. It will continue to break box-office records though, but it also reminds us that popularity doesn't equate to quality. If you enjoy mediocre films, here's one to recommend. I Am Dismal could have been a more apt title.SCORE: 5/10 (www.filmnomenon.blogspot.com) All rights reserved!",5,1,1,14 October 2010
Amadeus," A sumptuous, glorious period epic.
","Milos Forman's epic biopic on arguably the world's most famous classical composer is nothing short of compelling. Peter Shaffer, who wins one of the film's eight Academy Awards for Best Adapted Screenplay, adapts his own acclaimed stage play of the same name for the big screen.The film is set in the late 18th century and is told in a flashback narrated by an aged Antonio Salieri living in a mental asylum. Salieri was a competent court composer who became envious when he realized Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart had godlike musical gifts that he had always desired. Soon, Salieri became mad with jealousy and began plotting the downfall of Mozart, even harboring thoughts of murdering him.History revealed that Mozart was poisoned to death. But was it Salieri who really murdered him? Amadeus explores the myth and dumbfounds us even further by subtly inferring that it may be and may not be Salieri who killed Mozart. The apparent greatness of Forman's film is that it even prompts us to believe that there is a possibility that Mozart may have worked himself to death. The mystery remains unclear.But Forman's film is not an account of Mozart's death, but rather a celebration of his life and his music and how Salieri's own pales in comparison. The contrast is obvious. Mozart is portrayed as a rude, impish, and womanizing figure while Salieri is religious, shuns alcohol, and has good social manners. Yet God chooses to bestow incredible musical talent on the former.Stage actor F. Murray Abraham who wins an Oscar for his role as Salieri gives an excellent, nuanced performance. And for a character who barely reveals his emotions to anyone, Abraham manages to accomplish that through the minimal use of facial expressions. He is so skillful that the subtle acting invites us to show sympathy towards his character even though he is portrayed as 'an ambiguous villain' in the film. On the other hand, Tom Hulce's Oscar-nominated turn as Mozart is energetic, vibrant, and he tops it up with a silly but infectious high-pitched laugh that is perhaps what is remembered best by many.Amadeus not only deals with the rivalry between the two central characters, but Salieri's love-hate relationship with God as well. This creates a triangular tension which brings a more satisfying depth to the film. Forman's decision to film most of the scenes in his native homeland of Czechoslovakia pays off wonderfully, contributing to the film's realism as many of the city's architecture dates back to Mozart's era.Amadeus is surprisingly engaging despite its subject matter and that it runs close to three hours. The brilliant selection of Mozart's compositions (conducted and supervised by Neville Marriner) that make up the film's heavenly soundtrack is, in my opinion, the defining factor that makes Amadeus such a sumptuous, glorious period epic.GRADE: A- (www.filmnomenon.blogspot.com) All rights reserved.",9,0,1,25 January 2011
Hero," Often accused of being a derivative of Crouching Tiger, and is seen to be too indulgent in stylistic hues, Hero is far from the achievement that it beckons.
","China's most celebrated filmmaker's first foray into the stylized martial arts genre is a bit of a mixed success. Following the path of Ang Lee, Zhang Yimou has directed a film that might just give Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon a run for its money. Unfortunately, cashing in on the trend of Chinese martial arts cinema means that focus in its production is, in the case of Hero, slightly compromised. Often accused of being a derivative of Crouching Tiger, and is seen to be too indulgent in stylistic hues, Hero is far from the achievement that it beckons.The plot outline may be deceptively complex, but the underlying themes are recognizable - loyalty, love, and trust. Viewing Hero reminds of Kurosawa's superior Rashomon, narrating the film in separate and different sequences, all told in flashback technique. Zhang Yimou's mastery of this Rashomonesque style is sometimes flawed, with several loopholes. Artistically, Hero is very impressive, and some of the one-to-one fight sequences are greatly realized. But it falls short of being the focused, substantial picture that Crouching Tiger is.GRADE: B- (www.filmnomenon.blogspot.com) All rights reserved.",8,1,1,27 January 2011
The Hurt Locker," The Hurt Locker builds upon the principle of suspense filmmaking and nothing else.
","The action woman is back with The Hurt Locker. Kathryn Bigelow, the director of Point Break (1991) and Strange Days (1995), returns to top form with this critically-acclaimed war picture after the flop of K19: The Widowmaker (2002). Filmed in Jordan, The Hurt Locker is set in Iraq during its recent American invasion a few years back. It follows a team of three U.S soldiers whose daily job is to defuse unexploded bombs or to tackle bomb threats. In this team, there is one specialist who suits up in protective gear and goes right up to the bomb to nullify its threat while his buddies provide defensive cover for him from a distance.The Hurt Locker builds upon the principle of suspense filmmaking and nothing else. The fear of a bomb exploding remains to be one of the most surefire ways to induce queasiness in cinema-goers. Here, Bigelow employs an array of film techniques (some excellent, some flawed) to intensify that fear, cranking the tension to at times unbearable levels. In the opening scene, she shows her action credentials in perhaps the film's most outstanding set-piece – a slow build-up of suspense which accumulates in a massive, heart-thumping explosion.With such an impressive introduction, it takes a great director to follow-up and maintain the interest of his viewers. Bigelow, however good she is, is not a great filmmaker. She manages to sustain the suspense for most parts, but because of the lack of a driving plot and the overuse of the 'shaky' camera approach, her film becomes less interesting over the course of two hours. Unlike most war films, The Hurt Locker has no story but only a series of chronological accounts of men in endless bomb-threat scenarios. Perhaps the only form of 'narrative sense' that could be observed is that the film intends to show the futility of war through its unpredictability.How does one preserve his sanity in such a vocation? 'Don't think about it,' says the lead character James (Jeremy Renner) who has defused more than eight hundred bombs in his career. In a fairly ironic scene late on, James, having had to choose a box cereal for his family, becomes overwhelmed by the sheer number of different brands available on the shelves of the supermarket. For once, he is stunned because he has ample time to make a decision and that he 'thinks about it'. 'Is my decision the best? Did I choose correctly? Hell, I'd rather defuse a bomb than choose a box of cereal!' his blank stare seems to suggest.Bigelow's overuse of the 'shaky' camera becomes nauseating after a while, even though it is essential to a certain extent in creating the docu-realism feel which plays a part in the heightening of the suspense. And then there is the use of slow-motion in a couple of shots which look out of place in a film emphasizing on the rules of time and reality. Nevertheless, The Hurt Locker remains to be one of the better action pictures of the year. I foresee possible Oscar nominations for sound mixing and sound editing. Despite its flaws, this is a film to be experienced (however just once) in the theaters.GRADE: B (7.5/10 or 3.5 stars)www.filmnomenon.blogspot.comAll rights reserved.",8,2,4,18 May 2011
Nausicaä of the Valley of the Wind," A less involving film than expected.
","Only his second feature-length film, legendary Japanese animator Hayao Miyazaki stunned anime lovers with an adventure story that would thematically and visually pave the way for the success of later works such as Castle in the Sky (1986), and Princess Mononoke (1997). Nausicaa of the Valley of the Wind, as it is called, is an interesting film, but in my opinion, it is incomparable to most of his later works. Having watched all of Miyazaki's films, I strangely feel a lack of emotional attachment to this one, though the spirit of wonderment, a hallmark of every picture of his, at least still comes across unscathed.Nausicaa is the name of a beautiful and brave princess who lives in a small agrarian valley where the wind always blows. Such a natural phenomenon is important because deadly toxins from the Sea of Decay, a heavily polluted area that covers most of Earth, are blown away from the people of the valley. The Sea of Decay is one ghastly place, with all kinds of insects inhabiting it. One type of species, called the Ohms, which look like organic versions of Sentinels from The Matrix (1999, 2003, 2003) trilogy, look disturbingly creepy, but unless they feel rage, they are very much benign in nature.Speaking of rage, there is plenty of that to go around in Nausicaa. The princess is angry at the warring nations that are threatening to destroy the lives of people. The Ohms want revenge against the humans for being aggressive toward them. The fragility of the Earth's ecosystem to support life hangs precariously in the balance. The pacifist warrior Nausicaa must stand up against tyranny and destruction to save her people, the Ohms, and everything in between that breathes. Miyazaki's ecological themes are obvious here, though his message of peace and harmony while strong, comes across as less affective here than in the more masterful Princess Mononoke.Well-drawn and representing an early showcase of Miyazaki's creativity, Nausicaa unfortunately feels jagged in its editing, causing it to function not as effectively in its storytelling, character development, and the execution of its action sequences, many of which involve aerial battles that require smoothness in cuts to invoke pronounced feelings of excitement and tension in viewers. Joe Hisaishi, in his first of many fruitful collaborations with Miyazaki, composes a score that is part orchestral, part electronic, the latter of which seems out of place at times.Some would disagree, but I feel that Nausicaa is one of Miyazaki's weaker works, at least from a technical standpoint. Even from a storytelling point-of-view, too much weight is placed on the title character's shoulders to lead the film on her own. In some of his best features, Miyazaki often pairs up or groups strong heroines with one or a few fascinating supporting character(s), with their interplay producing some of the most tender and affective moments. In Nausicaa, this is less obvious, and together with a quite unconvincing villain, these factors unfortunately lead to a less involving film than expected.GRADE: B- (7/10 or 3 stars)www.filmnomenon.blogspot.comAll rights reserved.",7,1,2,25 April 2011
The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo," The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo is an outstanding serial killer mystery-thriller, and one of the best films of 2010.
","Based on the immensely popular novel of the same name by the late Stieg Larsson, The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo is an outstanding serial killer mystery-thriller, and one of the best films of the year. The first part of the 'Millennium Trilogy', Dragon Tattoo precedes The Girl Who Played with Fire, and The Girl Who Kicked the Hornet's Nest, both of which are already made into films in Sweden. Such is the anticipation for their release outside Sweden that many filmgoers are beginning to hop around in excitement.Directed by Niels Arden Oplev, who works mainly in television, Dragon Tattoo is a remarkable effort in feature length filmmaking. Oplev shows exquisite skill in crafting a mystery-thriller that is never formulaic, expressing the desire to deliver a picture whose characters are more important than the story, which in itself is already fascinating to begin with. He takes his time to flesh out the two lead characters by providing viewers with more than a summary of their current life situation, and slices of their past that they could not forget, giving the leads an uncommon depth.Mikael Blomkvist (Michael Nyqvist) and Lisbeth Salander (Noomi Rapace) are the two leads. The former is a disgraced financial journalist who is waiting to serve his jail term in six months' time. The latter is a genius computer hacker who is sexually taken advantage of by her sadistic caretaker. The first half of the film documents these two characters separately, only bringing them together much later. By that time, the film's murder mystery has become so engrossing that it threatens to overshadow its characters. Yet, it does not.The story follows Mikael who is paid to pursue an unsolvable case of a young woman who disappeared forty years ago from an island. Through old-school journalistic techniques, and with the help of Lisbeth's prowess in IT, he uncovers a chilling cultish plot by a Nazi sympathizer who rapes, tortures, and kills women. When the real identity of the killer is revealed at the end, it may not be much of a shocker. However, it is the journey towards that revelation that is integral to the haunting cinematic experience as created by Oplev.Dragon Tattoo is frightening and it crawls deep under your skin. Mikael sticks loads of old, black-and-white photographs of suspects on his wall to organize his thoughts and try to find links or clues that would shed light on the mystery. Oplev shoots extreme close-ups of these photographs, as if they are blown up to the proportions of a theatre screen. Looking at them gives a creepy feel akin to literally staring into the eyes of a cold-blooded murderer. Repeated exposure to these photos build suspense, of which it cumulates in the film's most unnerving sequence when Mikael breaks into a suspect's house to find criminal evidence.Dragon Tattoo clocks in at about 150 minutes, which makes the film a long (but still satisfying) ride. However, it turns rather draggy in the final twenty minutes as Oplev tries to tie up all the loose ends. The film has been such a competent example of storytelling that cutting the entire final segment would not have caused any problems other than irritating a handful of Larsson's more vocal fans.David Fincher, the reputable director of Seven (1995) and Zodiac (2007), both of which share eerie similarities with the style and content of Dragon Tattoo, is set to direct the Hollywood remake of Oplev's film. I usually condemn any news of Hollywood remaking foreign language pictures, but Fincher's Dragon Tattoo is something I would really love to see.SCORE: 8.5/10 (www.filmnomenon.blogspot.com) All rights reserved!",9,2,5,16 August 2010
Mulholland Drive," Lynch has made cryptic cinema his very own and an art form, and all the better for it.
","Say what you want about David Lynch, but he remains one of the world's most idiosyncratic filmmakers. Love him or hate him, his works could be strange, beautiful, and extreme at the same time. But there is no doubt that Lynch's cinema is one-of-a-kind. It is difficult not to have an opinion after viewing his films. The Oscar-nominated director of The Elephant Man (1980) and Blue Velvet (1986) is rewarded with another Oscar nomination for Best Director for this film, which has since regain a newfound appreciation after frustrating viewers a decade ago.Mulholland Dr. could tie with Blue Velvet as Lynch's magnum opus. Weird, horrific, and most of all, haunting, it is an experience that defies expectations. Written by Lynch himself, Mulholland Dr. could either be the most brilliant film conceived by the most bizarre of human minds, or the most useless, illogical, and downright unfathomable ever.The plot of Mulholland Dr. is not crucial to understanding what the director's vision for the film is (thankfully, as I wouldn't know where to start). Lynch takes two simple concepts of dreams and reality, and draws up a complex relationship between them. He merges them together, then dissects them, then attempts to turn them into each other. And if that is not enough, he confuses us further by not establishing which is which in the first place. When the dust settles (if it does), the question to ask is: Does it all make sense? Does it even suppose to make sense? Curiously, Mulholland Dr. works more effectively as a film when it is left to vagueness and the bewilderment of the viewer. Apparently, it works even better when one is puzzled and comprehends the 'puzzlement' as key to appreciating Lynch's dark, twisted tale. Even if the film is picked apart and understood with clarity, it still stands firm and strong as a near-perfect piece of storytelling, one that is surprisingly without any discernible loopholes.The performances by the cast are generally excellent. The chemistry between the two lead actresses – Naomi Watts and Laura Harring – is outstanding and provides the film with a strong emotional core. Watts, in particular, makes her acting breakthrough here, with a daring performance that is perhaps only second to her career-best display in Alejandro Inarritu's 21 Grams (2003). There is some controversy over the quite explicit homosexuality portrayed by the two leads. However, under Lynch's assured direction, it becomes integral to the building of character relations in the 'dream' half of the film, and the instigation of tragedy in the 'reality' half.The intoxicating music by Angelo Badalamenti adds a sense of the unknown to the film, appearing to come from deep within the mystery that is Mulholland Dr., rather than as an aural accompaniment to its dreamscapes and nightmares. There is a noirish quality to Lynch's film that makes it visually captivating, and atmospherically dense. There is also the feeling that all is not right in Hollywood, where the film is set, and in which it tries to satirize.Even though Lynch gives us a shocking climax that concludes the film powerfully, in essence, it is still incomplete. There is no ending really. In fact, it is a pseudo-ending because Mulholland Dr. works like an endless cycle filled with Lynchian ambiguity and his brand of 'hallucinatory (in)sanity'. Each round brings one deeper into what seems like a bottomless abyss, raising questions on the temporality of reality and dreams, and the 'reality' of imagination. With Mulholland Dr., Lynch has made cryptic cinema his very own and an art form, and all the better for it. This is the cinematic equivalent of the ultimate Rubik's cube.SCORE: 9/10 (www.filmnomenon.blogspot.com) All rights reserved!",10,4,6,12 July 2010
Big Fish," Big Fish is not Burton's best work, but it may be his most heartwarming.
","Big Fish is a small, quiet film by Tim Burton, one of cinema's leading visual stylists. Often accused of indulging in more style than substance, Burton answers his harshest critics with a fantasy drama that is not only well-made, it is perhaps one of the most balanced films in the director's oeuvre of mostly offbeat works. Based from a fictional novel written by Daniel Wallace, Big Fish's biggest reward is only a solitary Oscar nomination for Danny Elfman's beautiful score. Should it have garnered more nominations including a hopeful shot at Best Picture? Albert Finney plays old Ed Bloom, a father dying of cancer. His son, Will (Billy Crudup), realizes that he has never really known his father all these years. After all, Edward has never told his son a single true story about his life. What he enjoys most is repeating his tall stories about his incredible adventures that he lived by when he was younger. Like how he encountered a witch with a glass eye that could predict one's death. Or a gentle giant who he befriended. Or how he parachuted down during a war mission in Korea and met two beautiful Siamese twins. Burton explores these adventures with Ewan McGregor playing a young Ed Bloom. At times quirky and fun, Burton brings an optimistic outlook to the film with vivid colors and an assortment of cartoonish characters. He does it with a laidback style that focuses more on the relationships amongst characters than the film's visuals. Granted, the visuals are still excellent; there is no better way to describe than calling it Burtonesque. One scene completely defines that word: Ed drives a classic red coupe in the midst of a torrential storm and suddenly winds up on a calm riverbed where a nude woman figure elegantly swims. The relationship between father and son plays the pivot in which the whole film centers on. To Will, his father is a mystery. Are his stories factual or myths? By the end of the film, the enigma is gone and is replaced with a newfound revelation. Big Fish has all the ingredients to be a tearjerker. But Burton does not want to sweep us away with a weep fest; he wants us to be buoyant and hopeful of the future. Ultimately, he wants us to measure life not in terms of its absoluteness but rather through the experiences it gives us. Big Fish is not Burton's best work, but it may be his most heartwarming.

2001: A Space Odyssey," A meditative journey into the nature of our existence
","Hands down, and without a shadow of a doubt, 2001: A Space Odyssey is the greatest science-fiction picture ever made. Even if something similar is attempted today, it will inevitably still be streets behind Stanley Kubrick's influential masterpiece. After making a name for himself with classic films such as Paths of Glory (1957), Lolita (1962) and Dr. Strangelove (1964), Kubrick bolstered and cemented his reputation as one of the greatest filmmakers ever to grace our planet with the release of 2001, at a time when space exploration looked real and promising.2001 is a meditative journey into the nature of our existence. Kubrick explores many themes, most notably that of existentialism, man versus machine, and the cycle of life. At the beginning of the film, the director brings us back into the prehistoric age when humans looked like apes. The quest for survival slowly turns violent, from getting food and avoiding predators to forming 'clans' to fight against each other for territorial rights.This is greatly juxtaposed with colonized space, which forms the bulk of 2001's remaining two hours. In one of the most stunning jump cuts ever, we see an ape-human throw a bone up into the bright sky and as gravity pulls it down in one swift motion, it suddenly becomes an image of a satellite (shaped like that bone) floating in dark, infinite (and gravity-less) space. In that mind-blowing split moment, Kubrick hurtles us thousands of years into the future.Colonizing space ironically leads to even deeper isolation. And this is felt by two crewmen onboard a manned flight to Jupiter. Actually, the phrase 'manned flight' is misleading because the huge spacecraft they are in is completely controlled by a powerful and error-proof intelligent computer called HAL. Now, Kubrick plays on the man versus machine theme with devastating consequences for both sides. Reliance on technology could be a boon or a bane, and till this day, there isn't a film every year that does not ignite the hot debate over this.A final major theme of 2001 is the concept of the ever-continuing life cycle of human existence. The final sequence in which an astronaut finds himself inside a coldly detached room somewhere in space and sees the physical image of himself – a frail, old man having a meal, and then dying on a bed – not only provokes thought about the transient nature of life, but also asks of the question: Is there more to life after death?Kubrick seems to argue in the positive by presenting to us the blissful image of a star child overlooking the universe. Does it symbolize reincarnation, the continuation of the cycle of life? Or being one with the Creator? Or immortality? Up until then, and much so to his credit, Kubrick has not explicitly brought in ideas about religion, though one can argue that 'the monolith', a rectangular grey block made of an unknown inert material that appears in four key moments in the film, is simultaneously a symbol of mystery, and the ultimate black box containing all the answers to our existence. In other words, 'the monolith' could be God.2001 features Kubrick's unique melding of imagery and motion to the sound of classical music. Man-made space objects rotate and float across the length of the screen, as slow as the director would allow them to move so as to imitate the reality of motion in space. Working together with the famous Arthur C. Clarke (who co-wrote the screenplay), Kubrick brings astounding realism to his craftwork, building models of space objects to their finest details, and winning his only competitive Oscar in his career for Best Special Visual Effects.Kubrick's strong eye for visual symmetry (where props are placed and spaced equally) is also apparent and this would later go on to be a hallmark of his visual style in films like A Clockwork Orange (1971), and The Shining (1980), influencing a new generation of filmmakers including Paul Thomas Anderson (There Will Be Blood, 2007) and Duncan Jones (Moon, 2009).Perhaps the only drawback of 2001 is its very slow pace, which may frustrate on the first viewing (I felt the same way too). However, its snail-like pace will suit subsequent viewings better, especially when appreciation for Kubrick's craftsmanship, direction, and filmic vision mature with time. 2001: A Space Odyssey is a towering achievement, a science-fiction masterpiece that will never be equaled. It just might be Kubrick's greatest contribution to cinema.SCORE: 10/10 www.filmnomenon.blogspot.com All rights reserved!",10,2,5,11 July 2010
Once Upon a Time in America," Once Upon A Time In America is a massive film; it is a landmark of its time and a colossal achievement rarely equaled.
","On the cover of the video for Once Upon A Time In America is a sepia-toned picture of a gang of five in trench coats and hats strolling past the Manhattan Bridge. The smallest of the quintet appears to do a dance backwards as if imitating Chaplin. This nostalgic shot eventually leads to one of the most unforgettable sequences ever captured in American film - a stunning mix of strong visuals and powerful music.Sergio Leone, whose film masterpiece remains to be Once Upon A Time In The West (1968), has embarked on perhaps the most ambitious motion picture about organized crime since Francis Ford Coppola's two-part mafia drama The Godfather in the early 70s, putting together an original cut that runs nearly four hours, transporting viewers back to nearly fifty years of American underworld history.Perhaps the most striking aspect of Leone's crime epic (apart from its extraordinary length) is Ennio Morricone's legendary score. Truth be told, it is one of the greatest film scores never to be nominated for an Oscar (due to a late submission caused by a clerical error). The beauty of Morricone's score is largely confined to the first half of the film where it is played more often and has its most resonance because it perfectly evocates the nostalgia of early 20th century America.Once Upon A Time In America stars Robert De Niro (Noodles) and James Woods (Max) in the film's two lead roles, and is accompanied by an extensive cast of young and old including a 12-year-old Jennifer Connelly, Joe Pesci, Tuesday Weld, and Elizabeth McGovern. The acting is consistent throughout; every role is given time to develop. This is especially so for roles which have two different actors playing them in two different timelines. Of course, the best performance comes unsurprisingly from De Niro, whose powerhouse display of male chauvinism and uncompromising personality does no harm in affecting his reputation as one of the world's most proficient actors.The bloody violence is reminiscent of The Godfather but Leone's film is harder to watch because there are two graphic depictions of rape shown. Although Once Upon A Time In America tends to devalue and victimize women by portraying them as objects of sexual and verbal abuse, the film's strength lies in Leone's ability to build a story around core values of friendship, loyalty, and brotherhood amongst men.Once Upon A Time In America does not move in a linear fashion. It is a series of inter-cutting character development flashbacks and flash forwards edited with excellence and assembled with coherence to a main narrative that reveals few things. Its puzzling ending is shrouded with mystery and till today remains the most talked about part of the film. Each character is distinctive and developed with immense depth, yet after four hours, we still know so little about them. Yet it is this enigmatic quality that these characters emanate that makes Leone's film such a satisfying watch.Coppola romanticized organized crime with The Godfather while Martin Scorsese's take with Goodfellas was explosively visceral. Sergio Leone, on the other hand, has opted for nostalgia. Once Upon A Time In America is a massive film; it is a landmark of its time and a colossal achievement rarely equaled. To see this film is 'to be swept away by the assurance and vitality of a great director making his final statement in a medium he adored' (Kenneth Turan, Los Angeles Times).

Avatar," James Cameron retains his crown, but only a CG one.
","There is nothing that has not been said with regards to the return of the king. After twelve years out in the 'wilderness' directing deep sea documentaries such as Ghosts Of The Abyss (2003) and Aliens Of The Deep (2005), and pushing the envelope on CG, 3-D, and motion-capture animation technology, James 'I am king of the world!' Cameron is back to epic feature filmmaking with Avatar, a science-fiction extravaganza of sight and sound that is the brainchild of one of the world's most technically accomplished filmmakers of the last three decades with an envious filmography that reads The Terminator (1984), Aliens (1986), The Abyss (1989), Terminator 2: Judgment Day (1991), True Lies (1994), and Titanic (1997).Directed, written, co-produced, and co-edited by Cameron, Avatar comes with enormous pressure to deliver. With a budget ranging anywhere from US$250M to US$500M (let's not play the guessing game), it is the most expensive film to date. If there is one filmmaker in the world who can fully justify the use of such an obscene amount of greenbacks, it is Cameron. Every single dollar is put up there on the big screen.Avatar is a simple story of war versus peace, human versus alien, a modern species versus an indigenous tribe. It draws influences from numerous films (apart from Cameron's own), most notably Kevin Costner's Dances With Wolves (1990), Edward Zwick's The Last Samurai (2003), and Hayao Miyazaki's Princess Mononoke (1997) and Castle In The Sky (1986).Jake Sully (Sam Worthington) plays a paraplegic ex-marine who replaces his dead brother by using his custom-made avatar, mind-controlling a three-meter tall alien with blue skin and identifiable human features to blend in with the Na'vi, the indigenous tribe of Pandora, a world of stunning natural beauty. The humans or Sky People as unaffectionately called by the Na'vi is hell bent on clearing the forests of Pandora to excavate rocks potentially worth many times more than Avatar's film budget. Sully finds love in Neytiri (Zoe Saldana), the gorgeous but fearless Na'vi daughter of a tribe head. She slowly warms up to his peaceful intentions, teaching him the ways of her culture. Torn between his race and the Na'vi, Jake must decide on his own destiny.Avatar is an entirely original concept pieced together by elements borrowed heavily from other films. The result is a narrative that is fresh but predictable. Many will be familiar with such a story but it is the experience that counts. Cameron delivers a tremendously captivating film experience for all of its 160 minutes. Because there is an emotional core formed by the relationship between Jake and Neytiri, the visuals never take center stage. In fact, they only enhance our appreciation of Pandora and our connection toward the Na'vi. There is something at stake here. Who lives and dies matters unlike in Michael Bay's Transformers: Revenge Of The Fallen (2009) or Roland Emmerich's 2012 (2009).Avatar features an outstanding score by James Horner that deserves to be nominated for an Oscar. He captures the magic of Pandora and the thrilling spectacle by alternating between an enchanting soundscape and soaring themes. Speaking of Oscars, Avatar will win, hands down, the Academy Award for Best Visual Effects, and is likely to be nominated in other technical areas such as sound and cinematography. The big question is will Avatar be a Best Picture nominee? And will James Cameron receive his second directing nomination? The major problem I (as a die-hard Cameron fan) have with Avatar is the film's lack of significant action suspense. Cameron has a reputation for delivering white-knuckle excitement as characterized in films such as Aliens and T2, but this element is sorely lacking here. Because for most parts Avatar is rendered with CGI, the action sequences seem 'fake' despite being photorealistic.There was a time when Cameron made gritty, realistic, balls-to-the-wall action set-pieces. That time has passed. I still admire Avatar as a film experience. But having said that, I feel this is Cameron's weakest work after True Lies. He retains his crown, but only a CG one.SCORE: 8.5/10 (www.filmnomenon.blogspot.com) All rights reserved!",9,1,2,4 August 2010
Toy Story 2," The sequel to the insanely popular Toy Story (1995) is a blast
","The sequel to the insanely popular Toy Story (1995) is a blast. John Lasseter and co-directors Ash Brannon and Lee Unkrich give viewers another ninety minutes of family entertainment of the highest order. There are more reasons to cheer as Toy Story 2 packs more action and adventure, more toys, and more references to cinematic folklore than its prequel. And it does so without compromising on the human story of friendship and loyalty.Woody and Buzz Lightyear return as best buddies and find themselves in more trouble than ever. Woody is stolen by a bumbling toy collector who intends to sell him to a client in Japan to make loads of money. He is the final and most valuable piece of the Round' Up gang, a rare collection of toys that were very popular with kids back when humans had yet to land on the moon. Buzz and the other toys set out to attempt a near impossible rescue before Andy, their owner, comes back from a camp.The primary reason Toy Story 2 is a more enjoyable flick than its prequel (but not necessarily better) is that the 'other toys' get to directly experience the peril of the 'outside world'. And to absolutely hilarious effect, if I may add. Mr. Potato Head, Rex, Slinky Dog, and Hamm join Buzz as they find themselves racing against time and avoiding danger posed by humans and 'evil toys' such as Stinky Pete and Zurg, Buzz's nemesis.Toy Story 2 is not without its heart-tugging moments. In a sequence accompanied by the touching song 'When She Loved Me', Jessie, one of the film's new characters, recollects memories of a distant past when she was the proud toy of a young girl who loved her, but grew up and discarded her. Cinematic references to Spielberg's Jurassic Park (1993), Hitchcock's Rear Window (1954), and not to forget Kershner's The Empire Strikes Back (1980) are also nicely weaved into the screenplay.Both Toy Story films can be enjoyed on their own without the need to watch them together. This is a strong testament to the quality of filmmaking by Pixar. Technically, Toy Story 2 is much more sophisticated. Even with the advancement of computer wizardry and technology (and it being a sequel), the film is still able to match its predecessor's warmth and earnestness. Simply put, Pixar keeps raising the bar for animation with each new feature.But the real test awaits. After more than a decade, Toy Story 3 (2010) is slated for release in a month's time. Will it be a nostalgic return to our childhood? Or will we find out that we have outgrown Woody and Buzz? Pixar's ultimate challenge then is to convince us, in ninety minutes, that we have been frozen in carbonite all these years, that we haven't really aged at all.GRADE: A (www.filmnomenon.blogspot.com) All rights reserved.",9,0,1,14 January 2011
Super 8," While I will fall short of praising Abrams for his work here, I still think it is a decent tribute to the wide-eyed wonderment of 1970s sci-fi cinema.
","One of the most anticipated films of the summer, at least from a sci-fi geek's perspective, Super 8 is a mixture of all things good and bad about Hollywood filmmaking. With a strong team working behind the camera including Steven Spielberg as producer, Super 8 is technically stunning for a US$50 million blockbuster. However, it is the essential matter of plot and character that ruins the film in ways that we do not come to expect from a J.J. Abrams' film. As evident in Mission: Impossible III (2006) and Star Trek (2009), Abrams can direct an action picture. Unfortunately, he does not seem to write as well as he directs.In Super 8, the basic premise goes like this: Some school kids including lead protagonist Joe (Joel Courtney) use their Super 8 camera to shoot a zombie short for a local film festival. When shooting outdoors one night in a deserted train stop, a train zooms past before colliding head-on with a vehicle, leaving the kids to scurry for their lives amidst explosions and flying metal in the film's first and most satisfying action set-piece. The mystery of the train wreck slowly reveals itself to be something more sinister, and it is up to the boys and a girl, Alice (Elle Fanning), to find the answers.A tribute of sorts to Spielberg's Close Encounters of the Third Kind (1977), while referencing his other works such as E.T. The Extra Terrestrial (1982), War of the Worlds (2005), and even Raiders of the Lost Ark (1981), Super 8 is like seeing, and I quote Roger Ebert, 'a lost early Spielberg classic'. Well, at least for the first hour that is. The setup of the plot is excellent with specific attention going to the production design, which evokes a fairly strong mood associated with 1970s suburbia. The cinematography and editing are praiseworthy too. Like I said earlier, this film is technically flawless.But the problem with Abrams' film lies past the halfway mark. Plot becomes unrealistic as situations unfold not with logic but with convenience. A plot device involving a vibrating cube is not explained thoroughly. Worse, Joe and Alice's fathers are not developed well enough such that the respective father-child relationships appear to be less emotionally potent than expected. While sometimes Spielberg is accused of overindulging in sentimentality, at least his films are realistically depicted and his characters strongly motivated. For Abrams, the characters in Super 8 may be far from paper-thin, but there are flaws in the way they react to change.The visual effects are amazing to look at though. Unfortunately, the climax is short-lived instead of the lengthy spectacular extravaganza it should have aspired to. Speaking of which, Super 8 could have done with an additional 15-20 minutes because the final act seems awkwardly paced, as if there is a mad rush to complete the film. Super 8 may have its flaws, but it is still generally quite an entertaining picture. While I will fall short of praising Abrams for his work here, I still think it is a decent tribute to the wide-eyed wonderment of 1970s sci-fi cinema. But if you look into my eyes, I am clearly only half hypnotized.GRADE: B (7.5/10 or 3.5 stars)www.filmnomenon.blogspot.comAll rights reserved.",8,3,8,10 June 2011
Up," Up is still effective, uplifting, and mostly heartwarming, but it is one of the less accomplished works by Pixar.
","Directed by Pete Doctor and co-directed by Bob Peterson, Up is from the guys who created Monsters Inc. (2001) and who work at one of modern cinema's most consistent production companies - Pixar Animation Studios. Up is the tenth feature film from Hollywood's Jewel of Creativity following the successes of films such as Toy Story (1995), Finding Nemo (2003), The Incredibles (2004), and Wall.E (2008).This latest picture is another bold step away from what Pixar has done over the decade, and together with Wall.E (which was considerably bold enough), both represent a significant change in priorities in the company's vision. Producing family-friendly fare is a thing of the past. Now they are using CG technology to transcend animation filmmaking, to give the once isolated genre devoted to entertaining five-year-olds a strong cinematic identity, one that mature audiences can find themselves unashamed of appreciating.Up is perhaps the most risky venture by Pixar thus far. The lead character is not a cute fish, or a lovable rat, or a friendly monster, but a short, bespectacled, and grumpy old man with a face as unappealing as a box. How marketable is that? Fears that Up could be Pixar's first real flop are swept away within the first fifteen minutes. The prologue sequence that introduces Carl Fredricksen is a gem both in its execution and its ability to comprehensively and instantly portray the old man as someone we have no difficulty empathizing.Carl's dream of visiting Paradise Falls in South America is triggered to reality when he is forced to relocate to a retirement village. That morning he made his house fly, lifted by thousands of colorful balloons, and propelled by wind as it pushed the curtain-like sails hung out on rails on each side. Russell, a chubby boy with a zest for adventure happened to be on Carl's front porch when the house made its ascent. Together they explore South America and evade obstacles which appear more life-threatening than they expect.The introduction of the actual villain Charles Muntz in Up comes slightly too late into the film. Because of limited development of the character, Charles is not as imposing as he should be. While it does create an extent of fear, there is not a moment in the film when we have doubts of the protagonists surviving unscathed. Likewise, the climax arrived too quickly as well. Although the adventures of the leads are mostly engaging, they appear short-lived. I see it as a flaw because the filmmakers could have spent more time adding more action set-pieces to the fray.As with Miyazaki's Howl's Moving Castle (2004), a major influence to this film, physical logic has to be cast aside. Many of the scenes can never happen in reality. Can an old man really navigate a floating house with his frail physique? Can balloons really lift a house? Up tends to indulge in fantasy far more than reality. That is not necessarily a bad thing, but when a film whose devotion to human emotions and bonding (themes grounded in reality) far eclipse that of its far-fetched plot, there is a fair chance that it might turn out to be a mixed bag of unclear priorities. And it does to a small extent. Up is still effective, uplifting, and mostly heartwarming, but it is one of the less accomplished works by Pixar. But that is still saying something.GRADE: B+ (www.filmnomenon.blogspot.com) All rights reserved.",8,0,1,22 February 2011
Rio," Rio is good fun as a family movie, but to some, their feel-good experience may be muted by a largely forgettable story.
","From the director of the Ice Age (2002, 2006, 2009) films, Rio is an above average animated offering from 20th Century Fox Animation. Despite an A-list voice cast of Jessie Eisenberg, Anne Hathaway, Leslie Mann, and Jamie Foxx, the film is unable to hold its own against the likes of recent animated films such as How to Train Your Dragon (2010), The Illusionist (2010), and Rango (2011). Writer Don Rhymer, who co-wrote Surf's Up (2007), a surprisingly good animated film featuring penguins, pens an overly simplistic screenplay that lacks creativity. As a result, Rio's story is less than engaging.Eisenberg voices Blu, a domesticated male macaw from a town in Minnesota who is taken care of by Linda (Mann). A request by a bird doctor to temporarily send Blu back to Rio de Janeiro, where he was originally from, to meet a female macaw named Jewel (Hathaway) so that they could produce offsprings that would continue their rare species, leads the characters head-on into an adventure that pits good against evil in a land known not only for its energetic samba music and dance, and its assortments of kaleidoscopic festival colors, but also for its violent organized crime (think City of God, 2002).Because Rio is meant for a PG-rated audience, the bad guys depicted in the film are not brutal gangsters but stupid bird smugglers who ought to grow brains. The villains (both humans and bird, and to a certain extent, mischievous little monkeys) are pretty much paper-thin characters that you know would be left with eggs on their faces by the end of the film. Such is the predictability of Rio that it is a film that somewhat gets uninteresting as time passes, though that may not apply for kids, but for the adults who are forced to tag along.Much of Rio's visuals play to the strength of the flamboyant Brazilian culture. Colors are abundant and vibrant while the spirit of joy can be easily felt. This is especially so in the climactic scene involving a parade of dance performances atop huge elaborately-dressed vehicles that move in a slow procession. Much of the humor comes from the neurotic jokes that Blu cracks up, but even then, it does not quite tickle your funny bone, and may even seem a trifle out of place in this film for kids. Rio is good fun as a family movie, but to some, their feel-good experience may be muted by a largely forgettable story.GRADE: B- (www.filmnomenon.blogspot.com) All rights reserved.",7,3,5,11 April 2011
The Wind that Shakes the Barley," A disappointing offering that consistently fails to emote our feelings, and merely tries to camouflage itself under an 'award-winning' package.
","The Wind That Shakes The Barley doesn't break conventions, and is the primary reason the film fails to succeed. Throughout the two hours of runtime, it stays on the safe route, never deviating, never tries to be extraordinary. Most veteran film-goers will find this a different type of the same. Apart from a few who may rate it highly, The Wind That Shakes The Barley is not a cause for celebration. It moves at snail-pace, monotonous, and rarely excites or titillates. The screenplay is dull, working better as a sleeping pill than a narrative medium. It discusses themes like loyalty, war, and discrimination in a way that isn't appealing.The cast is mostly unknown, which means there won't be any star distraction. But what's distracting is the sub-par acting. For an independent film, The Wind That Shakes The Barley bucks the trend of having strong and well casted roles. If there's a positive light to the film, it will be the cinematography. Shots of vast grasslands, and beautiful greenery literally give the film a brighter outlook. Occasionally, the photography helps to relieve the poor viewing experience, but it is just unable to shoulder the immense liability as a result of average film construction.The Wind That Shakes The Barley is a weak war drama, a pale comparison to similar films like Terrence Mallick's The Thin Red Line. The battle sequences are limited, however the opportunity to present dramatic value is wasted due to an imperfect screenplay, which I believe is the root of the problem here. A disappointing offering that consistently fails to emote our feelings, and merely tries to camouflage itself under an 'award-winning' package.SCORE: 5/10 (www.filmnomenon.blogspot.com) All rights reserved!",5,1,4,7 November 2010
Departures," Departures is a touching ode to those who have left us.
","The surprise winner of the Academy Award for Best Foreign Language Film of 2008, Departures snatched home the golden man from favorites like Laurent Cantet's The Class, and Ari Folman's Waltz With Bashir. Directed by Yojiro Takita, the Japanese drama is in every way a deserving winner of the Oscar.And I hope that with this win, more will realize that Japanese cinema is not all populist crap; it can be culturally rich and deeply intense too. Correct me if I am wrong, but this is the second Oscar win (in this century) for a Japanese film since Hayao Miyazaki's Spirited Away (2001).Departures tells a story of a young married man, Daigo, who loses his job as a cellist in an orchestra which is seeing dwindling audiences. He then chances upon a job advertisement and lands himself (unwillingly) as an assistant to an old, experienced professional who plies his trade in the coffin business.While Daigo is understandably immensely uncomfortable with his work initially, the job grows on him as he consistently brings in the dough. He does ritual cleansing, dressing, and make-up for the dead during the funeral before they are put to rest in the coffin, or in short, encoffinment. Because of the nature of the job, Daigo's marriage falls apart and he feels unaccepted by society.But that is just the surface of the story. Departures dwells into something more intrinsic to our hearts -loss, death, guilt, regret, family, and love - emotions and themes that are omnipresent in our lives, but are often difficult to convey in film.Takita's picture reveals these with careful direction, honest acting, and a surreal music accompaniment (by the legendary Joe Hisaishi) to the film's many heart-wrenching moments. The characters are so well-realized that they take a life of their own; it is as if we know their entire life story, their painful past, and their hopes for the future.Not only does Departures tug at our heartstrings, it is also an eye-opening observation of a job most will shun without hesitation. Is it a loser's job? Is it an unclean job? What the director does well is to convince viewers that it is neither. Through sprinkles of effective humor, Takita manages to bring a light-hearted warmness to the film, though this is ultimately overwhelmed by the sheer melancholia of it all.Departures is a touching ode to those who have left us. It is also one of the best films to grace the screen in recent years. It is a powerful tearjerker and a reminder that embracing death can be a very beautiful thing too. Highly recommended!

Pulp Fiction," Tarantino picks at the itsy-bitsy of American popular culture and brings his stylish brand of film-making to the forefront of that very culture he is trying to redefine.
","What else is there to say about Pulp Fiction that has not been said? I am tempted to stop writing here but a one-liner review is never going to do justice to Quentin Tarantino's cinematic masterpiece. So, if you will, let me ramble.After the breakthrough at Sundance that was Reservoir Dogs (1992), one would be hard-pressed to find a film-making talent as precocious as Tarantino at that time. Here was a man who, before he started making films, worked in a video store. Such was his fascination for movies that he began to write stories while at work, obviously influenced by the culture he was immersed in.What happened afterwards was the stuff of legend. His 'stories' became Reservoir Dogs, and two years later, he made the Palme d'Or winning Pulp Fiction at age 31. To my knowledge, the only American filmmaker I could think of who won the coveted Cannes award at a younger age was Steven Soderbergh for Sex, Lies, and Videotape (1989) at 26.The fear of making an explosive debut like Reservoir Dogs is that it is tricky to score again. With Pulp Fiction, Tarantino not only scores but has created the perfect goal for himself. Easily one of the top ten films of the nineties, Pulp Fiction is a lengthy film that weaves four stories together in a non-linear narrative structure that continues to impress with each viewing.The four stories are as follows: One, Vincent Vega (John Travolta) and Jules Winnfield (Samuel L. Jackson) are two mob hit men who work for Marcellus Wallace (Ving Rhames), a ruthless gangster boss, and are assigned to retrieve an important suitcase. Two, Vincent is tasked by Marcellus to take his wife Mia (Uma Thurman) out for the night leading to an unexpected circumstance. Three, Butch Coolidge (Bruce Willis), a boxer, betrays Marcellus by not losing his match, and runs away with his betting money instead. Four, two small-time robbers are dining in a restaurant when they decide to spontaneously rob its patrons.One way or the other, the four tales are linked to each other. Expertly crafted by Tarantino (who won an Oscar for original screenplay together with co-writer Roger Avary), Pulp Fiction pushes the envelope for cinema writing, influencing a new generation of filmmakers such as Alejandro Gonzalez Inarritu (Amores Perros, 2000; 21 Grams, 2003). While it takes some time to understand what Tarantino is trying to do, there is never a moment of confusion in his storytelling.The performances in the film are outstanding, and are made even more memorable by the brilliant interchange of dialogue among the characters. The signature Tarantino verbal banter is laced with witty remarks and nonsensical debate over irrelevant issues from foot massages to quarter-pounder burgers. Tarantino picks at the itsy-bitsy of American popular culture and brings his stylish brand of film-making to the forefront of that very culture he is trying to redefine.Pulp Fiction's lasting legacy lies not only in its imitable screenplay (there are so many quotable lines), but how it revitalizes a tired genre – the gangster crime-thriller – to suit contemporary tastes. As much as the film is about violence, drugs and sexual fetishes in suburban America, it is also a powerful tale of redemption, most notably encapsulated by a thought-provoking monologue by Jules in the final act, which in itself, is a stunning closure to its prologue.SCORE: 9.5/10 (www.filmnomenon.blogspot.com) All rights reserved!",10,2,5,12 July 2010
Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone," The Sorcerer's Stone is a highly imaginative film narrative that is compelling and a pleasure to watch.
","This is still my personal Potter favorite. The Sorcerer's Stone is still the film that opened my eyes to the world of young wizards and witchcraft. Its sequels are worth recommending, but it becomes increasingly less magical and wondrous. No matter how great a film is, it's rare for the film to capture fully the essence of the book. Harry Potter is no exception. This is the work and imagination of the filmmakers themselves, not necessarily what we believe it should be. Another director could have seen the world of Harry Potter in a different light.Chris Columbus (Home Alone) fortunately sees Harry Potter's world in a way that satisfies the majority of die-hard Potter fans. There's enough movie magic to enthrall and engage even non-Potter fans (which includes me). The Sorcerer's Stone delivers in most areas, giving us a detailed glimpse of the fantasy world unlike any other fantasy movies. The action sequences are exciting but not a standout on its own. The young leading cast of Daniel Radcliffe, Rupert Grint, and Emma Watson give exceptional performances that pull the strings of the film together, without being too brash or childish.The Oscar nominated score by John Williams highlights his amazing musical ability time and time again, giving a grandeur, mystifying sound to the production. The only major problem the Harry Potter movie series faced was the competition and the higher standards set by the Lord Of The Rings (LOTR) screen trilogy which was launched at nearly the same time. Somehow, The Sorcerer's Stone feels amateurish compared to the Fellowship of The Ring. It's also probably the reason Harry Potter will always play second fiddle to LOTR. But on its own, The Sorcerer's Stone is a highly imaginative film narrative that is compelling and a pleasure to watch. Wingardium leviosa! Petrificus Totalus!

Thor," Thor, under the hands of Branagh, is an excellent example of how to do a superhero movie right.
","Where Michel Gondry, the acclaimed director of Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind (2004) and Be Kind Rewind (2008), had comically failed with The Green Hornet (2011), Kenneth Branagh, the respected director of Henry V (1989) and Hamlet (1996) succeeded with Thor. An extremely promising setup to Joss Whedon's The Avengers, which is slated for release in the summer of 2012, Thor is without any doubt the best film Marvel Studios has produced in recent years, even better than the Iron Man (2008, 2010) series, I'd reckon. In fact, one has to go back to Sam Raimi's Spiderman (2002) for any decent comparison with the quality of Branagh's work here.Any dissonance felt since Branagh was picked to helm Thor would have slowly evaporated in the first thirty minutes of the film. After all, it is a bold and risky move for someone who is known for brilliantly translating the theatrics and subtleties of Shakespeare's words into film form to challenge himself with a big-budget superhero movie meant for a popcorn-munching audience. Speaking of which, Thor is imbued with Shakespearean undertones of betrayal, sacrifice, and tensions among the hierarchical ruling family. Branagh brings a touch of humanistic, real- world sensibility to the fantastical setting, enlivening the film when it could have been dulled with flat visual effects.The story takes time to build up, and that effort is worth it, as it immerses viewers into three realms, that of Earth, Asgard (where Thor and his father, Odin, live), and Jotunheim (where the villains, the Frost Giants, live). The settings in each of these three realms play an important role as they give viewers the chance to visualize and juxtapose the worlds of these 'mythical' characters. Action sequences fought in Asgard and especially Jotunheim, are well-directed with visual and sound effects becoming the main draw, appeasing Marvel fans who will get numerous opportunities to see Thor (and his oh-my-gosh-I-so-want- that-hammer) in action.In contrast, what happens on Earth is ordinary. But it remains to be the realm that provides the film with its most hilarious situations, and a romantic subplot involving the newly-crowned swan queen Natalie Portman, who plays Jane Foster. Thor is played by Chris Hemsworth, who as a new face to Hollywood, is surprisingly charismatic as an actor. Perhaps his charm plays out from his character, who from a brave but arrogant royal prince of Asgard becomes a lost soul on Earth, where he is banished to by his father (Anthony Hopkins) for inciting war with the Frost Giants.For a film that sees itself as a serious take on the Marvel universe, it is quite funny. The most laugh-out-loud moment occurs during a brief conversation between Thor and a pet store owner. Another milks humor from an Iron Man reference. Other moments take advantage of the 'earthly' situations Thor find himself unable to adapt to. On a random note, I would advise Marvel fans to stay all the way till the end of the end credits for a snippet of what is to come in The Avengers.Thor, under the hands of Branagh, is an excellent example of how to do a superhero movie right. It has all the necessary elements that make a successful Hollywood blockbuster. By no means a great film, but it certainly aspires to be so. And for that and other reasons mentioned above, I shall lavish praise and give a recommendation.GRADE: A- (8.5/10 or 4 stars)(www.filmnomenon.blogspot.com)All rights reserved.",9,14,27,29 April 2011
Rosemary's Baby," The best aspect of Polanski's film is that it is plausible enough to be taken seriously.
","Lured to America to direct the screen version of Rosemary's Baby, a novel by Ira Levin, Roman Polanski took the opportunity to launch himself as a star director in Hollywood. Famous in Europe for his thrillers such as Knife in the Water (1962), Repulsion (1965), and Cul-de-sac (1966), Polanski's work in Rosemary's Baby is hailed by critics as pitch-perfect. The film is also consistently mentioned as 'one of the scariest horror films of all-time' and 'a horror classic' by film magazines and polls.Now, I am not quite favorable with these lavish praises on a film I would classify as a psychological drama rather than horror (in the purest sense of the word). But really, what is horror? What makes a film 'horrific'? Is it scares that make you jump? Or is it the dreadful atmosphere of suspense? Or is it a conceptual idea that chills you? Are these definitions so subjective that it is only right to discount them? Or are they distinct parts that describe an increasingly vague genre?Rosemary's Baby tells the story of Rosemary Woodhouse (Mia Farrow) who lives with her husband, Guy (John Cassavetes), in a newly bought apartment flat. Guy is a struggling television actor who, to the delight of Rosemary, finally wants a baby. They have an old couple for neighbors who are caring and generous, but their actions become more suspicious over time. Soon, a pregnant Rosemary starts to hallucinate, feels pain in her abdomen, and begins to suspect a cultish plot against her baby, or does she not? The 'horror' comes from elements of Satanism and witchcraft. In a dream sequence halfway into the film, Polanski employs surrealistic images of what I would describe as the ritual raping of the protagonist by the Devil. In the final act, which I will not reveal in its entirety, Satan is hailed. However, it is important to note that Polanski's film is not a 'glorification of evil', but an inquiry into a person's psychological well-being and self-awareness.Polanski's fine direction allows the film to grow in psychological creepiness, and he does a steady balancing act attempting to suggest supernaturalism while retaining a strong sense of reality. Perhaps the best aspect of Rosemary's Baby, apart from the very faithful adaptation of its source material, is that the film is plausible enough to be taken seriously.The all-round excellent acting by the cast plays a large part in creating believable characters. Farrow, especially, gives us a character whose fears we can relate to. We are with her till the very end, to that famous and ambiguous last scene of her rocking the cradle. What lies inside the cradle is clearly the stuff of nightmares, but Polanski refuses to give us the money shot – the devil baby – which makes it all the more 'scarier' by leaving it to our imagination.Generally, Rosemary's Baby is a decent film. But moments of cinematic brilliance that we have come to associate with a skillful director like Polanski are few. I find something lacking overall, of which I can't quite pinpoint. Perhaps it didn't live up to my expectations of a 'horror masterpiece'. Or maybe the feeling of satisfaction was replaced by a sense of queasiness I felt towards its ambiguous ending.In a nutshell, Rosemary's Baby is good but not great. For some reason, it didn't 'haunt' me as much as it did for many others.SCORE: 7.5/10 (www.filmnomenon.blogspot.com) All rights reserved!",8,0,0,14 July 2010
The Bridge on the River Kwai," The Bridge on the River Kwai is a rousing action-adventure spectacle that is not to be missed.
","There are three kinds of David Lean fans. First, there are people who think that Lawrence of Arabia (1962) is his greatest work. Second, there are people who think that The Bridge on the River Kwai is his greatest work. And of course, there is the third group of people who believe that Lean's best works are made before Kwai, such as Brief Encounter (1945), Great Expectations (1946), and Oliver Twist (1948).Even though I am a firm admirer of the legendary British filmmaker, I find myself belonging to neither category. But that's because I have not seen enough of his works to make a reasonable claim. However, in the context of the claims by the first two aforementioned groups, I find myself aligning with the stars of the latter.Could The Bridge on the River Kwai possibly be a more accomplished work than Lawrence of Arabia? In my opinion, I would think so, and from my experience having viewed both films twice, I suggest a strong case for it. In this review, I will stick to the discussion on Kwai, but when necessary, I would use Lawrence as a comparison.The film that marked the first of five epics that Lean shot in the last three decades of his life, Kwai tells the fictional story of a company of British POWs led by Col. Nicholson (Alex Guinness) who is forced to succumb his power to Col. Saito (Sessue Hayakawa) who orders the completion of a bridge across the Kwai river so that trains carrying war supplies could cross it.What makes Kwai such a fascinating war film is this: Nicholson, in a bid to boost the morale of his men and ease their suffering, decides to build a top-quality bridge for Saito that would become a symbol of British pride after the war. However, in a parallel story, the Allies' counteract by sending a few trained soldiers in explosives to blow up the bridge in a covert operation no one knows.Set in WWII Burma, but filmed in picturesque Sri Lanka, Kwai's stunning cinematography captures the tropical landscape in both sweltering heat and pouring rain, highlighting the harsh conditions that plague the camp. Lean's wide, sweeping shots and steady close-ups allow the drama and action to unfold in its 'totality', never disorientating the viewer.Lawrence of Arabia admittedly features more stunning shots (set in a desert no less), but Kwai is the much tighter film. The latter is paced with more urgency and though both films have moments of 'going through the motions', it is Kwai that remains to be the more watchable film, and with a more appealing screenplay to boot.Much of Kwai's watchability also hinges on the Nicholson-Saito relationship. It is an awkward one, but it is interesting to see how it develops. In the film's most understated scene, both characters stroll along the completed bridge. Saito remarks, 'Beautiful, isn't it?', referring to the sunset (and maybe, symbolistically, Japan's impending decline). Nicholson replies thinking that Saito is referring to the bridge, and starts expressing how it represents his life's greatest achievement as a soldier. Saito does not correct Nicholson and allows him his quiet moment of triumph.In a way, this scene is the finest indicator of the growing 'comradeship' between the two enemies in the film. Lean's depiction of WWII boils down to these two characters, as human as anyone else in terms of their fallibility, but are made to look invulnerable to that very perceived fallibility.The final forty-five minutes is an exercise in suspense-building. And its ending is as climactic as it can get. The last line as uttered by one of Nicholson's men, 'Madness! Madness! Madness!' chillingly echoes Col. Kurtz's 'The horror! The horror! The horror!' in Coppola's Apocalypse Now (1979).The Bridge on the River Kwai is a rousing action-adventure spectacle that is not to be missed. It is also a towering achievement in Lean's career, proving his versatility in film directing. For better or worse, he would never return to directing small, intimate dramas again after catching the 'epic film bug'.

One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest," Cuckoo's Nest is a must-watch for all cinephiles and is most certainly one of the great American films of the seventies.
","One of the great directors who have made the effortless change from European cinema to the glamour of Hollywood, Milos Forman has two Best Directing Oscars to show for his achievement in two extraordinary films whose fame would forever be indebted to the highly-respected filmmaker from Czechoslovakia – Amadeus (1984) and One Flew over the Cuckoo's Nest. The latter stars Jack Nicholson in an Oscar-winning performance playing Randall McMurphy, a lazy troublemaker who has a history of violence and now fakes insanity that allows him to be committed to a local mental institution.Randall's arrival shakes things up in the mental institution. He makes friends with a deaf and mute American-Indian called Chief Bromden (Will Sampson) and establishes a love-hate relationship with Nurse Ratched (Louise Fletcher), the institution's dictatorial head nurse. Always up to mischief, Randall's rebellious nature sees him heavily involved in a series of situations leading up to the film's shatteringly powerful climax that is not only emotional wrenching, but oddly inspirational as well. With an exceptional supporting cast of 'mental patients' played by talented character actors such as Danny DeVito and Brad Dourif, Forman's film is a tour de force in ensemble acting.Both a brilliant behavioral comedy and an intricate drama, Cuckoo's Nest blends strong character interplay with moments of side-splitting situational humor such as the iconic scene of Randall playing foolishly with the water cooler. The sequence that still takes my breath away no matter how many times I see it is the one that starts with Charley Cheswick (Sydney Lassick) pleading Nurse Ratched to return his cigarettes and ends in utter chaos involving nearly everyone in the madhouse. Although the film pokes fun at the unfortunate lives of shackled mental patients, by the end of the film, Forman's sensitive direction would have allowed us to observe the dehumanizing effects of institutionalization.Cuckoo's Nest explores themes of morality, humanity and friendship through its anti-hero and villain. Randall who yearns for freedom in the institution wages physical and psychological warfare with Nurse Ratched, who is hell-bent in enforcing strict rules and regulations. Some would argue that the head nurse is just doing her job, but by the film's climax, she turns into one of American cinema's coldest and most cruel villains. While the film is shot from the point-of-view of Chief, Randall remains to be our anti-hero and our rallying point against oppressive authority. Yet, we occasionally feel that the ruckus he creates borders on lunacy, to the point that it might be difficult to defend his actions.Therein lies the brilliance of Forman's film – the development of a complex protagonist and antagonist whose roles interchange depending on the circumstance. There is no clear case of black or white in this film, which makes it an experience to savor even on its umpteen viewing. Cuckoo's Nest is a must-watch for all cinephiles and is most certainly one of the great American films of the seventies.

The Reader," The Reader is an undeserving Best Picture nominee.
","In years to come, The Reader would not only be remembered as one of the most overrated and least deserving films ever to be nominated for a Best Picture, but also as the film that denied Christopher Nolan's unparalleled superhero epic, The Dark Knight, a chance for a shot at Oscar glory. In fact, there are many other films that are superior to The Reader: Clint Eastwood's Changeling, Thomas McCarthy's The Visitor, and John Patrick Shanley's Doubt are some worthy examples that should have been considered if the Academy had foolishly decided against The Dark Knight. The Reader is directed by Oscar-nominated British director Stephen Daldry (Billy Elliot, The Hours) and stars Kate Winslet in one of her most challenging roles to date. She plays Hanna Schmitz, an ex-Nazi guard during the Holocaust who now plies her trade as a train ticket collector. One day, she encounters an ill teenage boy Michael Berg (played by David Kross) near her home and decides to temporarily care for him. After a few meetings at her home, a torrid affair blossoms between them. Hanna does not know how to read and write; so apart from sex, Michael often reads books to her. However, the affair is shortlived when Hanna suddenly leaves town, leaving a heartbroken Michael in her wake. This is essentially the crux of the first third of the film. The second and final third of the film revolves around a war crime trial (where the two meet again in the courtroom) and Hanna serving her life sentence (and growing old) in prison respectively. While the copious nudity and numerous sex scenes involving Winslet and Kross in the first third serve as a tantalizing appetizer, what comes thereafter in the remainder of the film lacks sustainability in what is a straightforward and predictable narrative that is as inspiring as a dead fish. The direction by Daldry is dull and almost lifeless. As a result, The Reader moves like a tepid game of chess between two uninterested opponents. Furthermore, the film lacks focus with back-and-forth timeline shifts that are more distracting than informative. Ralph Fiennes plays an adult Michael, whose screen-time is not sufficient to fully realize his role, thus giving a poor and flawed young-to-old transition of the character that viewers will find hard to care. Fortunately, Winslet's character does not stray the course. Thanks to some impressive makeup, Hanna remains emotionally and physically believable. Winslet will probably win her first Oscar for this but that does not make The Reader a must-watch. It is anything but. GRADE: C- (5.5/10 or 2.5 stars)",5,0,0,20 May 2011
The Wrestler," The Academy owes Aronofsky a Best Picture and Director nomination here.
","'Witness the resurrection of Mickey Rourke in Darren Aronofsky's deeply affecting film' reads a huge marketing poster of the Golden Lion winner at Venice. I would say exactly the same. And if you think The Dark Knight was snubbed at the Oscars, this was daylight robbery. The Academy owes Aronofsky a Best Picture and Director nomination here. The Wrestler stars Rourke in a comeback performance as Randy 'The Ram' Robinson. It chronicles the ups-and-downs of the life of the Ram Jam wrestler twenty years after he first ruled the wrestling ring. He meets a stripper, Cassidy (played by Marisa Tomei), whom he forms a friendly bond with. And when things seem to look bright for Randy, he suffers a heart attack and is forced to retire from wrestling. For someone whose life is devoted to a passion and in which he now is unable to pursue, the sudden emptiness can be shocking and it can beget an emotional breakdown even for a grown, rugged man. Aronofsky makes this the cornerstone of his film rather than assembling a picture with an unnecessary series of lengthy wrestling fights. He wants to tell the story of Randy the Common Man. For a fighter like he is, Randy is subjected to emotional hurt and suffering as well. While he takes it well under the circumstances, Rourke portrays him as somewhat fragile and vulnerable. In the ring, he is a hero. Outside it, he is zero. Rourke is nominated here, and he very well deserves that Oscar as much as Sean Penn does for his portrayal as the gay politician Harvey Milk in Milk (2008). Wrestling is a fake sport made real by the documentary-styled filmmaking. Aronofsky opts for the 'fly on the wall' approach to scenes of Rourke in the trailer or restroom prior to a match, giving a sense of immediacy to what is going to happen. The Wrestler is an eye-opening film too because it allows viewers an intimate glimpse to how wrestlers work with one another and how they employ 'cheating' tactics to entertain their audience. Yet no matter how rehearsed the fight sequences are in real life or in this film, they are still physically punishing. When these wrestlers tumble down hard, we can feel their pain. And the violence and gore can be unsettling to viewers as well. The final few minutes of The Wrestler are probably the most heart- wrenching moments in all of 2008's films. Because Rourke has so successfully delivered a complex screen protagonist, viewers not only sympathize for his character, but also understand why he makes the decision to continue wrestling despite his age and ailing health. The Wrestler is hardcore, gritty and vulgar, a reminiscent of Arononsky's drug masterpiece, Requiem For A Dream (2000). Yet at its heart, it remains an enlightening and humanizing cinematic experience. A must- watch! GRADE: A (www.filmnomenon.blogspot.com) All rights reserved.",9,0,0,16 February 2011
Rango," A visually sumptuous film that is undoubtedly an early contender for an Oscar nomination for Best Animated Feature.
","Is this the first animated Western feature ever made? If it is, it is a commendable breakthrough by Gore Verbinski, the famed director of the wildly popular Pirates of the Caribbean (2003, 2006, and 2007) trilogy. Rango merges the glory of the old Western with the limitless creativity animation offers to give us a visually sumptuous film that is undoubtedly an early contender for an Oscar nomination for Best Animated Feature. Scripted by John Logan, the respected screenwriter of Gladiator (2000), The Last Samurai (2003) and The Aviator (2004), Rango is a story well-told despite its rigid narrative structure.Rango stars Johnny Depp in a quite astonishing voice performance for the title character, who is a chameleon-like lizard that accidentally winds up in a Wild West town called Dirt, an arid land populated by weird- looking talking animals with parched faces who are desperate for water to survive. The egotistical Rango, sensing an opportunity to be a hero, starts to act like one, 'earning' the respect of the townspeople by telling a fictional story of how he killed seven baddies with just one bullet. He is made the sheriff, a role he is proud to play, as he seeks to investigate the urgent water issue.Rango is the first animated feature created in the studios of Industrial Light & Magic (ILM), a company best known to have invented the modern visual effects in the late 1970s. And if this is the standard ILM are setting for themselves, the folks at DreamWorks animation, and to some extent, Pixar would probably be having more sleepless nights than usual. The visuals are stunning to look at, with a more gritty approach favored towards rendering the environment and characters as opposed to the polished look associated with most animated films.With Roger Deakins (No Country for Old Men, 2007; True Grit, 2010) serving as a consultant for cinematography, you know better to take Rango seriously. While the story of an outsider arriving in a new town and ends up being the hero is a tad cliché even by Western standards, Rango however imbues in its lead character a waft of eccentricity that plays out humorously with the simple-minded supporting characters that populate the film. Much of the humor is aimed at adults, though kids would be too engrossed in the story to give much thought to some of the film's more offensively hilarious moments.References to the history of cinema have been the staple of a number of Pixar films including Toy Story 2 (1999), and Finding Nemo (2003). In Rango, ILM is no different, channeling everything from Raiders of the Lost Ark (1981) to Chinatown (1974) to Mr. Clint Eastwood himself. Verbinski's crisp direction allows the action spectacle to be enjoyed fully without half the time forcing viewers to wonder what is going on. There are no problems with the film's pacing, though the final third becomes way too predictable and may cause a fair share of viewers to look at their watches.Rango, even with its flaws, is still an interesting watch, although Wes Anderson's Fantastic Mr. Fox (2009), a quirky and peculiar stop-motion animated feature with Western elements, is a far more effective film. Nevertheless, Rango reminds today's cinema-goers that there is really no need to don 3-D glasses to have an immersive cinematic experience when 2-D animation is just as good, if not miles better.GRADE: B+ (www.filmnomenon.blogspot.com) All rights reserved.",8,2,5,13 March 2011
Platoon," This is an effective motion picture that truthfully reflects Vietnam during that turbulent era.
","Many consider Platoon as the best war film ever made. I disagree. Yes, Platoon is perhaps one of the best few around challenging the likes of Apocalypse Now, The Deer Hunter, Full Metal Jacket etc. But, in my opinion, Saving Private Ryan tops the bunch. But Platoon should be acknowledged for presenting the most sincere vision of war. Oliver Stone who's a Vietnam veteran, fully utilizes his war experience to write an impressive screenplay, following through with assured direction.Platoon also triumphs in the area of photography (highlighted by the tense sequence when the Vietcong steps out of the shadows during a night in the jungle, hunting the unsuspecting Americans), and showcasing forceful human drama (the village scene is unforgettable). Oliver Stone films Platoon in a way that makes viewers feel uneasy, unknowing of the dangers lurking that might result in deaths for the soldiers at any time. This is an effective motion picture that truthfully reflects Vietnam during that turbulent era, and is certainly deserving of the Best Picture trophy.SCORE: 8.5/10 (www.filmnomenon.blogspot.com) All rights reserved!",9,3,5,3 September 2010
Despicable Me," Now, the Minions are a real funny lot. They look funny, talk funny, and even laugh funny.
","Directors Pierre Coffin and Chris Renaud have made the third best animated film of the year thus far after Toy Story 3, and How to Train Your Dragon. I may sound consolatory, but I am putting things into perspective. Despicable Me is a very good animated film, but the quality of Pixar's and DreamWorks' outputs this year remain unsurpassed. But then again, if 2010 serves up another animated feature that is every bit as delicious as Despicable Me, I will have no complains.Written by Ken Daurio (Horton Hears a Who!, 2008), Despicable Me is a story about a deplorable man called Gru (voiced by Steve Carell) who dreams of stealing the Moon by shrinking it using a shrink ray. A villain at heart, Gru is cold, calculating, and hates children. Together with Dr. Nefario, and an army of cute, yellow, goggle-wearing technicians called Minions, Gru attempts to build a rocket that will fly him to the Moon to commit the 'crime of the century'.Enter three innocent orphans, Margo, Edith, and Agnes, who are 'adopted' by Gru to be part of a plan to steal the shrink ray from an arrogant young villain named Vector, whose fortress house is almost impenetrable. Despicable Me is a comedy-adventure that allows us to witness the thawing of Gru's cold heart as the three orphans find their way into his life, which until their arrival has been a perpetual lonely and emotionally unsatisfying existence.As much as the film is about the transformation of a despicable and aggressive man into one that is gentle and caring, it is also quite a cheeky portrayal of the 'greed and (over)ambitiousness of Man'. This can be seen in the context of the film where villains are able to get funding for their evil projects from the Evil Bank (formerly known as Lehmann Brothers in a clever if-you-blink-you-will-miss-it moment).Despicable Me is generally engaging and the main reason for this is its high humor quotient, of which it relies quite extensively on farcical visual gags and near-incomprehensible verbal banter by the Minions. Now, the Minions are a real funny lot. They look funny, talk funny, and even laugh funny. Their interactions with each other, Gru, Dr. Nefario, and the three orphans are indisputably the film's scene-stealers. In fact, the animation, which I feel is on par with Pixar's, is unfortunate to be outshined by the Minions.Despicable Me is ninety minutes well-spent. Even though it is not as emotionally wrenching as Toy Story 3, nor is it adventure in its purest incarnation as presented in How to Train Your Dragon, this Coffin/Renaud effort is still a very well-made film. The Minions are so hyperactively addictive that a sequel will be more welcomed than not. Enjoy.SCORE: 8/10 (www.filmnomenon.blogspot.com) All rights reserved!",8,1,4,14 July 2010
Mary and Max," Elliot's film may not rank as one of the finest claymation films ever made, but it certainly presents itself as a solid work in need of greater recognition.
","This sweet, heartfelt claymation (stop-motion animation using clay models) is lovingly directed by Adam Elliot, who previously won an Oscar for his animated short Harvie Krumpet (2003). Here in his first feature, Elliot charts the path to our hearts with a poignant tale of an unlikely friendship between a young Ugly Betty lookalike Australian girl called Mary, and an old and obese New Yorker called Max who suffers from a mental illness. Mary's curiosity about how babies come about in the US leads her to write a letter to someone randomly in New York. At first stunned and confused, Max, the recipient of that letter, eventually reciprocates by sending her a letter and some chocolate.But all is not well as Max receives more letters from Mary asking him what love and 'sexing' is. The tensions between a pubescent girl who has low self-esteem, and a mentally-ill old man who has no friends are played out excellently, even though they never really meet throughout the course of the film. Yet as viewers, we see them as perfectly compatible, complementing yet similar, and we want them together as friends. Elliot goes right into the psyche of a volatile and insecure man grasping with the prospect of friendship, an idea that seems alien to him, and parallels it with a girl's desire to make sense of the world.Further, Elliot gives near-equal screen time to both lead characters, alternating between them not by cutting quickly back and forth, but by moving the plot along through big narrative chunks devoted to the development of each character's past and present, as well as laying the groundwork for their futures. I feel that Mary and Max is not a story about two characters, but of two characters sharing the same story. And that story is a bittersweet one. In one encapsulating moment, the Que Sera, Sera song is played towards the end, cleverly juxtaposing with images of an alcoholic Mary on the verge of hanging herself as she recalls her past.Ultimately, Mary and Max is a story about friendship and forgiveness, and the need for redemption. Although the film ends on a quite depressing note, its lighted-hearted take on loneliness as a key theme is likely to fill the viewer with feelings of restrained optimism. Well- written, and conceptually unique, Elliot's film may not rank as one of the finest claymation films ever made, but it certainly presents itself as a solid work in need of greater recognition.GRADE: B+ (www.filmnomenon.blogspot.com) All rights reserved.",8,1,3,27 March 2011
X-Men: First Class," While it is too much of a stretch to call First Class a great superhero film, it remains to be one of the better efforts in recent years.
","The X-Men films have seen Bryan Singer (The Usual Suspects, 1995), the Oscar-winning Gavin Hood (Tsotsi, 2005), and even Brett Ratner (Rush Hour trilogy, 1998, 2001, 2007) taking on the directorial roles. Now put Matthew Vaughn onto that list. Fresh from the success of Kick-Ass (2010), Vaughn delivers again a blockbuster that effortlessly blends brawn and brains in a motion picture that not only entertains, but provides this summer with a title that is worth remembering. With four quite excellent features to his credit, Vaughn is now surely one of the few aces working in Hollywood.In the universe of X-Men, Vaughn's film is a prequel to all the other films, though it could also be classified as a reboot (or preboot to a reboot?) of a franchise most well-known for Hugh Jackman's Wolverine. He does make a funny cameo here, but Vaughn's intention is to show that X- Men is more than just the man with metal claws. In X-Men: First Class, the popular characters are now played by a new set of actors, with James McAvoy and Michael Fassbender leading the way with their portrayals of Charles Xavier (or Professor X) and Erik Lehnsherr (or Magneto).The film shows how their characters come into light, and how they evolved into who we know they are today. A large supporting cast is headed by Oscar nominee Jennifer Lawrence, who plays blue shapeshifter Mystique. Set in the early 1960s when America faced the threat of the Cuban Missile Crisis by the Soviets, First Class chronicles literally the formation of the first batch of X-Men recruits as they battle evil mutants (led by Kevin Bacon's Sebastian Shaw) hell-bent on starting World War III.First Class takes a while to pick up as back stories are told with some detail, but when it does eventually speeds up after about thirty minutes, it becomes tremendously engaging. The film is well-edited, especially a 'recruit training' sequence midway through that not only makes effective use of alternating split-screens that pump up the adrenaline, but provides a key emotional moment between Charles and Erik that would have far-reaching consequences. The action sequences are visually engrossing, but more importantly, they are directed with clarity so that we know what is happening.Although I feel that Vaughn's film is slightly overrated, I still think it is a pretty decent superhero film. It comes with several flaws though, most notable of which is the lack of character development and motivation of the supporting mutant characters. At a considerable 'long' runtime of about 135 minutes, I thought there should have been ample time to address this. Another problem is that the setting is a tad too sleek and futuristic for a film set in the 1960s, such that when John F. Kennedy's black-and-white televised speech comes onto the screen, it seems jarring to the eye.While it is too much of a stretch to call First Class a great superhero film, it remains to be one of the better efforts in recent years. With Fassbender finally anchoring a lead role in a major Hollywood film, it is a good opportunity to see how talented the German-Irish actor really is. With news that there could be two sequels to this, I am all for that to happen as long as Vaughn continues to write and direct, with Singer producing.GRADE: B+ (8/10 or 3.5 stars)www.filmnomenon.blogspot.com All rights reserved.",8,3,8,3 June 2011
Toy Story 3," Unkrich takes rein and flies the Pixar flag with confidence and conviction.
","At the end of my review of Toy Story 2 (1999), I challenged Pixar to 'convince us (with Toy Story 3)that we have been frozen in carbonite all these years, that we haven't really aged at all.' I am extremely delighted to say that Pixar has done it again. Director Lee Unkrich takes rein and flies the Pixar flag with confidence and conviction. The co-director of Toy Story 2, Monsters, Inc. (2001) and Finding Nemo (2003), Unkrich finally proves that he has what it takes to be fully in charge of a Pixar picture.Toy Story 3, I would guess, is the last installment of a very remarkable trilogy, which in modern cinema, is perhaps only bettered by Peter Jackson's action-fantasy epic The Lord of the Rings (2001-2003). Its success also breaks the 'curse of the third film' that has plagued popular series such as Spiderman, The Matrix, Pirates of the Caribbean, and maybe even Shrek. Pixar's eleventh straight box-office hit, Toy Story 3 is the epitome of consistency, not only for the famed animation studio, but for animation cinema as well.If there is a minor blip, Toy Story 3 is the least original in the series. Visually, it is arguably the most creative. But plot-wise, it copies the structure of its direct prequel. An action-packed prologue in which the toy character(s) live out their (or their owner's) fantasy? Check. Meeting of new toys in which one of them appears to be kind but is actually wicked? Check. A flashback sequence that details the fate of a toy? Check. Indiana Jonesque action and adventure in another great escape? Check.Nevertheless, it is still very entertaining to see Woody and co. pick up from where they left off eleven years ago. They have not lost any character trait, nor our love for them diminished over the years. The story goes like this: Andy is all grown up and going to college soon. The toys fear that they will become unwanted and unloved. They are then accidentally donated to a day-care center, to their delight of course, where children could play with them. Their enjoyment turns into horror when they realize that at night, the center becomes a prison controlled by a gang of 'veteran toys'.Toy Story 3 is less funny (dialogue-wise), has less film references, but hits the jackpot with great character interplay, of which the most memorable ones include that of Buzz and Jessie, and Barbie and Ken, most of them of a romantic nature. Many of the action set-pieces are thrilling (and sometimes frightening) including one involving a garbage incinerator in which the fear of death brings a collective sense of identity that has never been exhibited to such a heart-wrenching extent in a Pixar film.Unkrich leaves the very best for the last. The final act is touching, with enough emotional resonance to warm even the coldest heart. The younger viewers in which the film is targeted at may not be old enough to appreciate the nuances. But adults who tag along with them, and children who grew up with Toy Story (many of whom are now slightly older than Andy) will find tears in their eyes as they recollect memories of childhood that now look like a distant afterthought. Suffice to say, Toy Story 3 is a definite shoo-in for one of the top ten films of 2010.SCORE: 9/10 (www.filmnomenon.blogspot.com) All rights reserved!",9,2,2,11 July 2010
Before Sunrise," By the time the end credits of Before Sunrise roll off the screen, we would be left enthralled and absorbed by one of the great romance-dramas of the nineties.
","By the time the end credits of Before Sunrise roll off the screen, we would be left enthralled and absorbed by one of the great romance-dramas of the nineties. Written and directed by Richard Linklater, the Texas- born filmmaker who rose to prominence in the independent cinema circuit with films such as Slacker (1991) and Dazed and Confused (1993), Before Sunrise is his third feature film and a prequel to Before Sunset (2004), released nearly a decade later with the same actors reprising their unforgettable roles as Jesse (Ethan Hawke) and Celine (Julie Delpy).Employing a narrative approach that has since become his trademark, Linklater sets a number of his films over the course of a single day. In Before Sunrise, he sets it in Vienna, where youngsters Jesse and Celine meet by chance on a train. Jesse is a hip and cool American who has to take a flight home the next morning, while Celine is a beautiful French woman who is starting classes next week back in France. Jesse asks Celine to accompany him until he takes his morning flight. Celine, who is pleasantly surprised by his spontaneous invitation, joins him as they explore the sights of Vienna and meet strange but friendly people.The entire film is literally just two persons staring and talking to each other but Linklater's poignant and perceptive script provide the film with a heightened sense of realism. The characters talk about everything from reincarnation to their first sexual feelings while playing verbal games with each other. The camera never leaves them, as if there is a voyeur observing them. The naturalistic acting and Linklater's occasional use of long takes give us that feeling of watching events unfolding in real-time. Coupled with the postcard backdrop of Vienna, it is like an ode to the spirit of romance that ironically is so often lacking in films about romance.We sense the characters' attraction to each other, and this is communicated to us in the most subtle of ways. In perhaps the film's most memorable scene, the couple nervously tries to avoid eye contact in an awkward situation listening to a record in a booth. In another scene in a moving tram, Jesse tries to secretly brush off a lock of hair from Celine, but when she looks up, he puts his hand away. Such is Linklater's observant eye and keen understanding of human nonverbal interaction that it is a joy to watch all these details at play.The bittersweet ending brings tears, but it is not as devastating as Lean's Brief Encounter (1945), which covers similar ground. Jesse and Celine have already regarded their departure from each other as inevitable. Even though we wish to see them spend another day, another week, or month together, or heck, even get married, we know that may not be the best for them in the long-term. This emotional polarization of our feelings is deftly handled by Linklater, whose free-spirited film remains resonant to a whole generation of Gen X youths looking for love.

Beowulf," Beowulf can be described as a colossal disappointment.
","Beowulf (pronounced as 'bay-wolf') can be described as a colossal disappointment. One of the most anticipated movies of 2007, and nearly three years in the making, Beowulf is all-hype but with little, if any, positive end product. Oscar-winning director Robert Zemeckis who gave us memorable pictures such as Forrest Gump, Contact, and Back To The Future seeks to build upon the technical success of The Polar Express but ends up with a punctured tyre.Unlike digital CGI, hand-drawn, or stop-motion animation, Zemeckis and his team of talented animators have pioneered a cutting-edge technique that's able to capture photo-realistically an actor's facial expressions and body movements in animated form. In a way, Beowulf makes cinematic history for being the first feature film to be entirely created using the above-mentioned technique.The animation is truly stunning and visually captivating. There's a jarring problem though - the eyes of the characters often seem to 'stare into space' rather than effectuating eye contact with one another; it's the main reason there's low chemistry among the characters, and also why we feel the presence of a vacuum between viewer and character. Nevertheless, Beowulf has the potential to be nominated for Academy Awards for best visual effects, sound, and sound editing categories though. It's unlikely to win any with Zack Snyder's 300 in the hat as well. So what really caused the downfall of Beowulf? The filmmakers have simply ignored the very basic fundamental of making a great movie - the screenplay! No great film can survive with a weak script (no matter how impressive the effects are, or how well the director and cast have collaborated). Beowulf's screenplay is as shallow as a fifth-grader's essay. To compound the misery, it's poorly edited with numerous scenes (especially during quieter moments) showing an obvious lack in pacing.Beowulf's failure could have been prevented. Alas, the filmmakers are too short-sighted to notice its major shortcomings. For all the slash and burn, plus the wonders of modern movie magic, Beowulf isn't the cinematic knockout that I have hoped for. Watching Beowulf was more of a chore than a pleasure. And if I may add: Zemeckis, work harder on those soulless eyes please!GRADE: C- (5.5/10 or 2.5 stars)www.filmnomenon.blogspot.comAll rights reserved.",5,0,0,29 June 2011
Fantastic Mr. Fox," An Anderson masterpiece of craftsmanship and direction.
","Fantastic Mr. Fox is easily the best animated feature of 2009. It should be rewarded with an Oscar nomination (and is every bit deserving of a win) even though Pixar's Up (2009) could land the coveted statuette based on popular votes. Adapted from the beloved Roald Dahl children's book of the same name, the film tells the story of Mr. Fox and his sneaky scheme to steal poultry, especially chicken, from three nearby farms run by three nasty, detestable humans with a collective mission: to kill Mr. Fox and his family.Director Wes Anderson who is well-known for films such as Bottle Rocket (1996), Rushmore (1998), and The Royal Tenenbaums (2001) is one of the key American filmmakers of the 90s to revive the low-budget independent offbeat comedy. Even though much of his works remain under-appreciated, Anderson has a loyal following claiming that he is one of the great filmmakers of our time. While that might be exaggerating it a fair bit, Fantastic Mr. Fox shows us why he is on course to being judged as such.Fantastic Mr. Fox follows the stop-motion tradition of the Wallace And Gromit films, and refutes the argument that brilliant animated films can only be made by Pixar. Anderson's obsession with detail and his mastery of mise-en-scene also means that the film is far from 'kiddish'; on the contrary, it can be seen as quality art. While children may enjoy the visuals and the odd dose of behavioral humor (e.g. how the foxes consume their meal or how they dig themselves out of trouble), parents who are forced to tag along are far more likely to appreciate the authenticity of the character and set models used, and the themes of 'family', 'responsibility', and 'collectivism' which reverberate with quiet resonance throughout the film.There is some superb voice work on show here with George Clooney as Mr. Fox and Meryl Streep as Mrs. Fox. Supporting voice talents include stars Bill Murray, Jason Schwartzman, Michael Gambon, William Dafoe, and Owen Wilson. An 'ethnic' influence is evident in one of the characters here whose obsession with yoga and its meditative properties recalls a certain 'spiritual' Schwartzman in The Darjeeling Limited (2007), Anderson's previous film about three brothers on a bonding trip to India.Fantastic Mr. Fox also explores the important theme of domesticity versus the wild. Mr. Fox has a lovely family and he dotes on them. In short, he lives a comfortable life in his big house under a tree. But more often than not, he succumbs to his animalistic instinct by 'hunting' for food from the farms. He enjoys the temporal satisfaction of being a wild animal, or in this case, a sly, scheming fox. In a key scene, Mr. Fox has a fleeting encounter with a black wolf. Even though suppressed by a psychological fear of wolves, he admires from distance the dark beauty of the creature, its freedom to roam the lands, to hunt, and its fortune to avoid the tepidity that is domesticity.An Anderson masterpiece of craftsmanship and direction, Fantastic Mr. Fox very much assures itself of a spot in my top ten films of 2009.GRADE: A (www.filmnomenon.blogspot.com) All rights reserved.",9,0,1,3 February 2011
Speed," Speed is frankly one of the best action-thrillers to be released in the 1990s.
","Speed is frankly one of the best action-thrillers to be released in the 1990s. Everything one expects of the genre is there for viewers to savor. From start to end, it fully embodies the word 'speed'. Director Jan de Bont keeps the film tightly structured through the use of crisp editing, and the inventive screenplay by Graham Yost allows tension to literally accelerate to top speed. The film builds up the suspense right from the office elevator sequence, and then it sucks viewers in like a whirlwind as the situation unfolds nail-bitingly on a speeding bus with a bomb.Keanu Reeves and Sandra Bullock show brilliant chemistry, and are well-cast for their respective roles. In fact, we as viewers, like them so much to the extent that we still fear for their lives on the umpteen viewing. Another reason Speed still stands the test of time is because the adrenaline induced is genuine, unlike the majority of action motion pictures that we get these days. Dennis Hopper is convincing as the terrorist, we hate him as much as we love the protagonists.De Bont shows mastery of the action-thriller genre with Speed (his first feature film). It's an exemplary example of focused film-making combined with an exhilarating storyline. Speed is a highly impressive motion picture that will always get on your nerves.

Rear Window," A groundbreaking film study on the theme of voyeurism.
","Even though I consider Vertigo (1958) to be the greatest Alfred Hitchcock picture of all time, Rear Window remains to be my personal favorite. In the complete oeuvre of Hitchcock, Rear Window firmly occupies the very top shelf, together with such classics as the aforementioned Vertigo, North by Northwest (1959) and Psycho (1960). It is a great film, not only from a critical standpoint but also from the audience's point-of-view. For a 1950s picture, it has not dated one bit, and offers an excellent introspective night's entertainment for the whole family.A groundbreaking film study on the theme of voyeurism, Rear Window has no equal. Even its contemporary remake, Disturbia (2007), isn't even a third as good and is an insult to what Hitchcock originally planned to achieve with this picture. Starring the legendary James Stewart as Jeff, a wheelchair bound photojournalist who met with an accident but is only a week from full recovery, and the elegant Grace Kelly as Lisa, Jeff's fiancée who slowly becomes involved in one of the most intriguing plots ever written, Rear Window is a brilliant concoction of drama, suspense, and dark humor.This being a Hitchcock picture, there would certainly be a crime involved, or so we thought. Jeff thinks that one of his neighbors might have murdered and cut up his invalid wife. His detective friend, Doyle (Wendell Corey), however thinks that Jeff is delusional. At this juncture, we are in doubt, yet this draws us further into the film. Later, Lisa and Stella (Thelma Ritter), Jeff's personal nurse, become convinced of the possibility of such a heinous crime happening when their observations point to the suspect as a murderer.Written by John Michael Hayes (To Catch a Thief, 1955; The Man Who Knew Too Much, 1956), the screenplay takes its time to develop the protagonist who spends nearly the entire film immobile in a wheelchair. Jeff's immobility would become a plot device in the climax, which even by Hitchcock standards, is extremely tense. A particular phone call seemingly sucks the air out of the picture, conveying a deep sense of dread and inevitability that is to come. Moreover, the use of ambient sounds as part of the film's mise-en-scene, as well as to dictate the level of suspense is masterfully done.Supporting characters are seen through the voyeuristic eyes of Jeff, and they are developed objectively through the lens of the camera. We sympathize with Ms. Lonelyhearts who longs for a man to love her, smile at Ms. Torso who flaunts her athletic body with graceful stretching motions, and observe with some degree of comic distance the rest of the folks in their apartments doing their private business. The capturing of the ignorance of these characters towards a possible murder committed in front of their eyes marks one of the screenplay's high points. In one scene, a dead dog is found. Its owners are devastated but for the rest, life goes on without sympathy. Are we not the same?For its time, Rear Window is remarkably advanced from a technical standpoint. The cinematography by Robert Burks brilliantly captures exterior and interior shots in single takes without problems arising from differences due to the exposure of light. The transition is so smooth that it is impossible to tell when natural or artificial light is used in these shots. Burks' camera-work makes us willing participants in the spying game, drawing us into the sinister world of Hitchcockian terror. Like David Lynch's Blue Velvet (1986), Rear Window explores the concealment of Man's hideous nature under the façade of seeming normalcy. It takes a keen eye to see what's wrong underneath all the pleasantries.Rear Window is not only a masterpiece of film direction and screen writing, but also an influential force that continues to inspire contemporary filmmakers to deal with the issues of privacy, intrusion, and paranoia in the modern world. One of the best examples would be Michael Haneke's Cache (2005), with its dramatic treatment of the ethics of video surveillance a cinematic offshoot of Hitchcock's work. Rear Window is one of the greatest films of all time, and with each repeated viewing, its thematic elements not only become more salient in the world we live in, but also increasingly unsettling.GRADE: A+ (10/10 or 5 stars)www.filmnomenon.blogspot.comAll rights reserved.",10,1,3,20 May 2011
The Matrix," The Matrix is one of the best sci-fi films to come out in the 1990s, bringing instant gratification to viewers and critics alike.
","This groundbreaking film is all about style. Laden with astonishing visual and sound effects, it became an instant hit worldwide. While the plot may be on the complex side, this film scores in the area of entertainment. It is a dark film, toying with the idea that humans are like batteries, acting as slaves to fuel power for the 'machines'. No one has ever developed a concept so abstract at first thought, only to surprise people with the ingenuity of it.The Matrix is technically impressive, bagging four Oscars. There are moments of great editing, e.g. the 'rushy and tense' sequence at the end of the film when Neo (Keanu Reeves) is running away from the agents. You could almost feel yourself shouting for Neo to run faster. Though the soundtrack gets way too 'pop' at times, it is still effective, especially the instrumentals. The signature sound of the trumpet and horns blowing coupling to the slow-motion bullet time sequences are the hallmarks of the Matrix.Acting is sub-standard though, but the script demands little expressiveness from the cast. The Matrix is one of the best sci-fi films to come out in the 1990s, bringing instant gratification to viewers and critics alike. The Wachowski Brothers have given the world something to talk about for years, both in terms of the Matrix concept, as well as the technical brilliance in exhibition. Strongly recommended.SCORE: 9.5/10 (www.filmnomenon.blogspot.com) All rights reserved!",10,0,1,14 August 2010
Easy A," Easy A is a fine social lesson for the post-pubescent crowd that is packaged in a delightfully smart rom-com.
","Easy A is easy to like and gives ninety minutes of light-hearted entertainment that fans of romantic-comedies would enjoy with their peers. Aimed at the under-18 crowd, the film stars Emma Stone (Superbad, 2007; Zombieland, 2009), an up-and-coming screen queen (of the post-teenage universe), who gives a star lead performance that would raise the eyebrows of critics who deem her as only capable of supporting turns in films of this genre.Any college guy (nerds and geeks excluded) would give anything to date Stone. She is blessed with natural beauty and an attractive figure – two attributes that suit the role of Olive, which she plays convincingly. In the film, Olive is very talkative. But that is because she leads a rather lonely college life (hard to believe), and thus needs to wax lyrical about her 'vibrant' social life outside to her friends. This concept essentially becomes the film's main narrative.In order to gain the envy of her friend, Olive tells her that she had sex with a guy over the weekend. This is overheard by another girl in the toilet and the school's rumor mill starts to spread the juicy news to almost every student. Soon, Olive's peers see her as a slut, but enjoying a rare moment in the limelight, she reciprocates by behaving like one. In one of the film's most hilarious scenes, she helps a gay boy to appear straight to his peers by agreeing to 'have sex' with him behind closed doors, imitating sex noises and what not.Olive achieves notoriety in her school, but she soon becomes disillusioned with herself, as she begins to realize that her artificial actions are not representative of her natural character. Easy A's fresh approach to the rom-com genre is quite engaging, with a notable emphasis on presenting college life not as a series of hormone-raging boy-girl relationship pursuits, but rather a time when self-identity is molded and individualism is expressed.Director Will Gluck's easy-going style makes this a pleasant watch. The film gets a fair share of laughs from both its situational humor and the quite witty dialogue that questions the nature of college life, which I feel represents a microcosm of the 'celebrity-obsessed' world of gossips and scandals that we live in today. Taking a small leaf out of John Hughes' book, Gluck brings us down to the perspective of a college girl who finds that being socially visible for the wrong reasons entails more alienation from her peers, which in turn leads to an ever escalating cycle of loneliness and self-doubt.In a nutshell, Easy A is a fine social lesson for the post-pubescent crowd that is packaged in a delightfully smart rom-com.GRADE: B (www.filmnomenon.blogspot.com) All rights reserved!",8,0,0,7 December 2010
Apollo 13," Apollo 13 is a rare Hollywood film that gets onto our nerves and lifts our spirits with equal aplomb.
","Starring a superb cast including Tom Hanks, Bill Paxton, Kevin Bacon, Gary Sinise, and Ed Harris, Apollo 13 is a dramatic account of the 1970 NASA space mission to the Moon that met with a critical problem midflight, putting the lives of the astronauts in very grave danger. But they managed to return back to Earth out of sheer determination, bravery, and luck, with coordinated help from a much focused ground team. Capturing the attention of the world at that time, the survival of these astronauts was one of the great moments of the 20th century.This is unmistakably a film about the triumph of the human spirit, of Man's innate determination to survive no matter how bleak the circumstances are. Directed by Ron Howard, Apollo 13 stands tall among other exemplary examples of inspirational cinema, and despite many of the sequences being rendered with CG visual effects, it remains to be an affecting human story of substantial worth. Deservedly nominated for nine Oscars including Best Picture, Apollo 13 also features a splendid score by James Horner, who also scored for Braveheart (1995) in the same year.Ron Howard is a fine director, albeit without a unique style to call his own. Although he is quite inconsistent with his output, Apollo 13 ranks as one of his top films alongside considerable efforts such as A Beautiful Mind (2001), and Frost/Nixon (2008). His lucid switching among sequences in space with Jim Lovell (Hanks) and his men, sequences in the chaotic ground control station with Gene Kranz (Ed Harris), and sequences shot from the perspective of the astronauts' worried loved ones gives the film a kind of understated wave of human drama that rises and falls complementarily.The most exhilarating sequence from Apollo 13 is without doubt the launch of the rocket. The visual effects are respectable for a mid- nineties film though it seems more dated with each viewing. It is the sound mixing, however, that truly transforms the film into an extraordinary experience, as if the viewer is brought to the site of the launch. Despite viewers knowing how the story ends, Howard manages to create one of the most nail-biting climaxes in American nineties cinema â€“ the anticipation of the astronauts' pod emerging in the sky after more than three minutes of transmission silence as it cuts and burns through the Earth's atmosphere.The joy and sheer relief of everyone matched by the soaring main theme of Horner's score after the emergence of the pod will make even the most emotionally-hardened viewer pump his or her fist into the air. Apollo 13 is a rare Hollywood film that gets onto our nerves and lifts our spirits with equal aplomb. Watch it for that experience.GRADE: A- (www.filmnomenon.blogspot.com) All rights reserved.",9,2,4,11 March 2011
Fast Five," Fast Five gives a movie-going experience that alternates between adrenaline-pumping high and dull lows.
","The fifth installment of the popular Fast and Furious series (2001, 2003, 2006, 2009), Fast Five is, as fanboys have claimed, the best of the franchise thus far. I admit I have not seen the prequels prior to this, and even so, I doubt I would be even motivated to consider reviewing them, thus I cannot and will be unlikely to check the legitimacy of those claims. That means this review is purely based on my observations of this film per se, and without any prior knowledge about this franchise nor its characters other than its long-running theme of fast cars, crime, and hot women.Fast Five stars two muscle men in Vin Diesel and Dwayne Johnson, who in one inevitable and obligatory scene are pitted against each other in an unarmed muscle fight to seewell, who has more muscles. It also stars franchise veteran Paul Walker, and a huge supporting cast of mostly relative unknowns. This gang of characters pulls out a daring heist of a vault containing a hundred million dollars belonging to a corporate- disguised drug lord with ties to the mob and the police. Diesel, who plays Dominic, leads his team in the heist, while Johnson, who plays federal agent Hobbs, chases after them.Directed by Justin Lin, who helmed the third and fourth installments of the series, Fast Five scores highly in its execution of action. Lin shows that he is well-adept at directing car crashes, gunfights, and ka- booms, with the film providing fans with a near orgasmic brand of pedal- flooring excitement. The action scenes are surprisingly clear to see and easy to follow. In fact, they are so well-edited that not only do they generate suspense, but also present a kind of orchestrated sleekness not frequently seen in action movies these days.Some, including myself, would feel that the action is extremely unrealistic in the way it defies the laws of physics. The most obvious example is the entire climactic sequence involving two cars hauling a huge metal vault along the streets at full speed creating havoc that inconceivably does not seem to hurt anyone collaterally. However, it is in the nature of this franchise that action is required (or rather, demanded) to be unrealistic. Lin emphasizes this in the prologue sequence in which a police bus containing prisoners somersaults acrobatically after colliding with a car to the cheers of fans in the theater.Fast Five's story is slightly thicker than a wafer, and is serviceable only to the extent of progressing the plot. Some characters may seem surplus to requirements but they do provide the occasional off-color humorous remark on their present circumstance. In addition to the weak narrative and undeveloped characters, the entire film is not very well- paced, despite the excellent editing of action. Much of the film drags along during times of planning of the heist and the test-driving of real sporty cars. A number of expository scenes could be trimmed to create more urgency; in fact, I feel that this film is a good twenty minutes too long.Fast Five gives a movie-going experience that alternates between adrenaline-pumping high and dull lows. If your diet consists of brainless entertainment, this is your key to salvation. If you are an action fan, this would also be your territory. For those whom are just plain curious like me, I say try it out and judge for yourself.GRADE: C+ (6.5/10 or 3 stars)",7,4,8,3 May 2011
The Thin Red Line," There is simply too little emotional payoff for a war film of this scale and uniqueness.
","The Thin Red Line is one of American cinema's great ironies. After two decades out in the filmmaking wilderness, director Terrence Malick popped up from nowhere to deliver one of the most unique war films ever made. Only his third feature after Badlands (1973) and Days of Heaven (1978), The Thin Red Line received numerous acclaims, the highlight of which was the prestigious Golden Bear award from Berlin.The film went on to be nominated for seven Academy Awards, including Best Picture and Best Director – the former ignominiously given to John Madden's overrated period drama Shakespeare in Love (1998), and the latter rightly given to Steven Spielberg's more superior WWII drama Saving Private Ryan. Herein lies the irony. In any other year, Malick's film would have at least secured an Oscar, but fate seems to have charted a less glorious path for his film. Twelve years on, The Thin Red Line still lives in the shadow of 'the other great WWII film' of 1998. Is it a cinematic tragedy, or is Malick's film really not as great as it seems.Very obviously, The Thin Red Line features extraordinary cinematography and camera-work by John Toll. He employs crane and steadicam shots that seem to glide effortlessly over the landscape, especially that of the grassy hills as soldiers make their ascent. Even in scenes of frantic action, the camera weaves past explosions and gunfire like a flying bat avoiding rock walls. Such is the artistry of the camera language that it sometimes feel like poetry in motion.The Thin Red Line stars a killer A-list cast including Sean Penn, Nick Nolte, and Jim Caviezel. However, it also features, to the film's detriment, redundant cameo roles by John Travolta and George Clooney. The film follows a company of American soldiers as they trudge up a grassy hill in Japanese-occupied Guadalcanal, and later, their attack on a small makeshift camp built by the enemy. This is essentially the main, driving plot of the film, but Malick deviates from it by introducing a pointless romance subplot that adds nothing of significance to the overall viewing experience.The periodic intercutting of the aforementioned romantic subplot with the main narrative is at best draggy, and at worst, a total distraction. I feel that the pacing of the film could be improved by removing the subplot completely. The film is already quite slow to begin with, and although the war action presents a change of pace (albeit only slightly), it takes some endurance to sit through three hours of what is mostly philosophical meandering by a narrator that is exclusively Malickian.On a more praiseworthy note, Malick's trademark intercutting of tranquil scenes of nature allows a fair amount of symbolic juxtaposition with chaotic scenes of warfare. The startling irony of war is laid bare here. Soldiers do battle with each other on the hills and in the jungles; these are huge environments that appear to swallow the men who fight in them. Does nature, at any moment, care about the actions of these men? Does the death of a young soldier on foreign land amount to anything nobler than a writhing baby bird on the ground waiting to die, as shown by Malick? The Thin Red Line lacks the urgency of Saving Private Ryan, or for that matter, of any other great war film out there. It is lackluster in parts where the action dies down. In the area of characters and their development, Malick has also made the misjudgment of being too inclusive rather than focus-centered. There are far too many characters in the film, each receiving either too much unnecessary screen time or too little development. As a result, there is no character to root for or to identify with. There is simply too little emotional payoff for a war film of this scale and uniqueness.SCORE: 7/10 (www.filmnomenon.blogspot.com) All rights reserved!",7,1,3,20 November 2010
Saboteur," The pacing of each scene is slow but steady, yet remarkably arresting at the same time.
","Alfred Hitchcock's Saboteur is a delight to watch. It was one of his first few 'wrong man' pictures, in which the protagonist is accused of a crime he did not commit, and seeks personal vindication and justice. Interestingly, it's the first Hitchcock film to feature an all-American cast and is completely shot in America. Saboteur neither reaches the standards of Rear Window, Psycho, or Vertigo, nor is it made when Hitchcock was at the prime of his career, but it gives a glimpse of his talent in storytelling and the building of suspense.As with most Hitchcock features, there are unforgettable images and signature set pieces that could have only been designed by him. In Psycho, there was the shocking shower scene. In North By Northwest, there was the thrilling crop-dusting scene. In Saboteur, the most striking image is that of the antagonist dangling in the air atop of the Statue of Liberty. Filmed in black-and-white, Saboteur is not necessarily an example of great cinematography. However, the color stock used is easy on the eye, and does not appear to affect the film's ability to engage viewers.The performances of the cast are decent, but there's no real starring act here. If there's one thing I loved most about Saboteur, it would be the pacing of the film; Hitchcock establishes the story with little urgency, and while the film does not really shift into high gears even in suspense mode, the pacing of each scene is slow but steady, yet remarkably arresting at the same time. Saboteur may not be a Hitchcock masterpiece, but as with The Lady Vanishes (1938) it's certainly one of his most underrated.SCORE: 8/10 (www.filmnomenon.blogspot.com) All rights reserved!",8,0,1,6 August 2010
Gangs of New York," The ever so reliable Scorsese can be counted upon to paint a stunning picture of one of America's most turbulent periods.
","Martin Scorsese's Gangs Of New York (nominated for an amazing ten Oscars but failed to win even one) is a measured accomplishment. If Gangs Of New York were helmed by another director, even the harshest critic would have labeled it the year's best film. Because of our sky-high expectations for a Scorsese picture, whatever he does surely comes under some scrutiny. Many claim that Gangs is too commercialized, and is devoid of the usual Scorsese magic. Others complain that it's a slow, and dully-written film.While this is not Scorsese's best effort (neither is it close to what he has achieved in his prime), Gangs Of New York is still a very powerful period film. It's a slightly fictionalized account about the development of America in the mid-19th century. The opening sequence (one of the my favourites!) is an incredible experience, almost spiritual-like. After that, it seems quiet by comparison. Scorsese takes his time to develop the characters, with Daniel Day-Lewis providing the star performance as Bill The Butcher.The elaborate sets, and costumes are striking. The artistic direction is also brilliant here; certain scenes have a respectable level of aesthetics to them. Gangs Of New York is Scorsese's first attempt to make a film on the epic scale. He succeeds to a favourable extent. But the film occasionally meanders about, huffing and puffing along. There's still much to appreciate though, and the ever so reliable Scorsese can be counted upon to paint a stunning picture of one of America's most turbulent periods.SCORE: 8.5/10 (www.filmnomenon.blogspot.com) All rights reserved!",9,0,0,27 October 2010
Slumdog Millionaire," A masterpiece of sight and sound.
","Danny Boyle's Slumdog Millionaire is a masterpiece of sight and sound. Nominated for ten Oscars including Best Picture and Director, Boyle's film is an unexpected frontrunner in the Oscar race whose stiffest competitor is David Fincher's The Curious Case Of Benjamin Button, which is nominated for thirteen Oscars. British director Boyle made his filmmaking debut with Shallow Grave (1995). But it is the critically-lauded drug drama Trainspotting (1996) that made him a sensation. While his films can range from the dreadful such as The Beach (2000) to the inspiring such as Millions (2004), there is a commonality that runs through many of his movies - they are energetic and vibrant.There is probably no other film in Boyle's body of work that exemplifies the essence of his craft than Slumdog Millionaire, a motion picture that encapsulates the wondrous power and beauty of cinema. Slumdog Millionaire is shot on location in the slums of Mumbai, India. After a harrowing introduction that establishes the understanding that this is going to be a unique 'flashback' film, viewers are treated to a phenomenal opening sequence that is captivatingly-photographed and frenetically-edited to a pulsating, hypnotic Oscar-nominated soundtrack by A. R Rahman whom remarkably is also nominated for a further two Oscars for Best Original Song: 'O Saya' and 'Jai Ho'. This sequence is an eye-opener; the gritty and frantic filmmaking allows Boyle to bring out the vibrancy and color of Mumbai slums with startling immediacy (including a nice touch to the presentation of the subtitles).Slumdog Millionaire has romance at its core. This is more obvious towards the second third of the film when Jamal (Dev Patel) and Latika (Freida Pinto) become teenagers and begin to feel the flitters of love. Jamal hopes to prove his love to Latika by joining India's version of the popular game-show Who Wants To Be A Millionaire. He makes his way to the top albeit accusations of cheating. Well, how can a slumdog know everything? He is arrested and interrogated, but explains that he knew the answers already. The film then pours everything it has to the viewers in numerous perfectly-staged flashbacks that reveal in detail how Jamal's turbulent life in the slums is linked with the questions answered during the game-show.Boyle does a brilliant job guiding untrained slum kids to act in front of a moving lens. Furthermore, he does not shy away from capturing true images of unsightly Mumbai and to use it as a beautiful backdrop for his film. The acting is not of the highest order, but it is easy to forgive because most of the cast are either non-professionals or greenhorns in their field. As an ensemble, the cast deliver. But individually, the characters only merely connect to the audience and feel slightly distant. Thus, Slumdog Millionaire lacks in raw emotional power of some of this year's best films including The Wrestler and Doubt. Boyle wraps the film up neatly and throws in a high-impact Bollywood dance sequence cum end credits that is not to be missed. It has been quite a while since I left the theater with such high spirits. Recommended! SCORE: 8.5/10 (www.filmnomenon.blogspot.com) All rights reserved!",9,1,3,3 November 2010
Gladiator," A potent motion picture depicting loyalty, corruption, and slavery in the most brutal, uncompromising fashion.
","The release of Gladiator helped significantly in consolidating Ridley Scott's reputation as a master filmmaker. His best two works are still Alien, and Blade Runner made in the early 1980s. But Gladiator has been a cause of optimism for Scott, a box-office success, as well as being nominated for twelve Oscars, bagging five, including best picture. It's a confidence booster for the premier director whose works in the 1990s have been mediocre by his own towering standards.A visual spectacle, Gladiator combines elements from Spartacus, and Ben-Hur, and is made in the tradition of classic epics, but enhanced with modern special effects technology. The result is a potent motion picture depicting loyalty, corruption, and slavery in the most brutal, uncompromising fashion, set in medieval Rome. The level of cinematography accomplished is of the highest standard, capturing Rome in astonishing detail, yet with a certain degree of credibility. The film is 2.5 hours long, but Scott keeps it tightly paced, without going overboard with fancy editing.Russell Crowe and Joaquin Phoenix provide the two supporting pillars, carrying the bulk of the film on their shoulders, giving a powerhouse, and devilish display respectively. Gladiator would only be half as engaging without Hans Zimmer rousing, grandeur score. It's a perfect complement to the visuals. Gladiator comes at a crucial time when the epic genre seems almost non-existent since Mel Gibson's Braveheart. It started a trend of similar films such as King Arthur but those are cheap offerings that makes us appreciate Gladiator even more.SCORE: 9/10 (www.filmnomenon.blogspot.com) All rights reserved!",9,1,3,16 August 2010
The Social Network," A generation whose reality is reflected here in the most ironic of interfaces – through the screen that allows us to see this must-watch zeitgeist film.
","The most brilliant thing about The Social Network is not its screenplay or editing (which are impressive enough to warrant a separate mention later) but its response to the question 'how does one make a film about Facebook?' Is there any material as un-filmable and unexciting as a story about the founder of the popular social networking site? Golden Globe-nominated writer Aaron Sorkin (A Few Good Men, 1992; Charlie Wilson's War, 2007) and acclaimed director David Fincher (Zodiac, 2007; The Curious Case of Benjamin Button, 2008) team up to deliver one of the best pictures of the year, a solid 'biopic' entry that has a reasonable chance of being nominated for a few major awards during Oscar season.Mark Zuckerberg is his name, if you haven't known already. He is played by Jesse Eisenberg, who together with the excellent ensemble cast of Rooney Mara, Justin Timberlake, and Armie Hammer, gives a performance that is not only quick-witted, but scathingly razor-sharp as well.The story follows the Harvard undergraduate as he gets rejected by his girlfriend. That spurs him to create Facemash, a controversial site that compares and rates the 'hotness' of two randomly chosen female students. After this episode, he gets the idea for 'Facebook' through meetings with collaborators, and starts his site on his own together with the help of financer and co-founder Eduardo Saverin (Andrew Garfield).What transforms The Social Network's seemingly dull premise about a socially-awkward geek with a laptop into something exciting is Sorkin's extraordinary screenplay. Nearly every minute of the film contains crossfire dialogue that are uttered with such great pace that it makes Ellen Page in Juno (2007) look like she is conversing like an old granny.Sorkin intelligently brings in ideas of social interactionism, or the lack of, in our modern technological age. He portrays with scenarios the current generation of 'plug-ins' and 'refreshers', people whose focus and frame of mind is solely devoted to communicating online, and downplaying what goes on offline.In the final scene, Zuckerberg continuously refreshes the page showing his ex-girlfriend Erica's Facebook profile after adding her in the hope that she would accept him. The film ends before we could know any answer, and that is essentially what Sorkin is trying to comment on – 21st century communication disregards or tends to ignore the emotional message that goes along with the actual message, resulting in the devaluation of interpersonal communication through mediated means.The Social Network is made up of two narrative threads: (1) the legal tussle between Zuckerberg and Saverin over the rights to ownership of Facebook and the resulting compensation; and (2), the chronological flashback of the two friends and their development of Facebook during the early years.Editors Kirk Baxter and Angus Wall remarkably bring these two threads together via the skillful act of quick cutting and cross-cutting, and this to the sound of a very expertly assembled array of songs that make up the film's soundtrack. The best sequence of the film, in my opinion, goes to the competitive canoeing sequence, which is edited to the electronic version of the famous whistling theme from Fritz Lang's M (1931).The Social Network is an exceptional take on the traditional and often overused premise involving the theme of friendship and betrayal. At its core, it is a humanist film that explores the relations of people as they are faced with rejection, injustice, theft (in the intellectual property sense), and jealousy. The Zuckerberg as brought to the screen by Fincher and Sorkin, while inaccurately portrayed, is a fascinating character who epitomizes the 'plugged-in' generation. A generation whose reality is reflected here in the most ironic of interfaces – through the screen that allows us to see this must-watch zeitgeist film.SCORE: 8.5/10 (www.filmnomenon.blogspot.com) All rights reserved!",9,0,1,3 November 2010
The Fighter," In the realm of boxing pictures, The Fighter straddles in the territory between Rocky (1976) and Raging Bull (1980), with the latter being the holy grail of the subgenre.
","What happens when a volatile director meets a potentially volatile actor on set? You get one of the most intense performances of the year. Notoriously hard-to-work-with director David O. Russell (Three Kings, 1999) guides Christian Bale (who infamously threw vulgar tirades on the set of Terminator Salvation, 2009) to a great turn as Dicky Eklund, the drug addict brother of Micky Ward (Mark Wahlberg), whom this biopic is based on. The Fighter, as it is titled, chronicles Micky's rise to prominence in the sport of boxing, but it is not without its fair share of ups and downs as you would see in this quite masterful picture of drama and sport.In the realm of boxing pictures, The Fighter straddles in the territory between Rocky (1976) and Raging Bull (1980), with the latter being the holy grail of the subgenre. It is raw, gritty, vulgar, and also a very revealing examination of the nature of human relations when people are under pressure to conform to the beliefs and expectations of others. The performances in this film are a knockout, and are perhaps the most compelling reason to head down to the theatres to catch the film. In addition to Wahlberg and Bale, the ensemble cast also features Amy Adams (Doubt, 2008), who is cast against type as a foul-mouth bargirl, and Melissa Leo (Frozen River, 2008), who plays one of the fiercest movie moms in recent memory.Russell's rough, unpolished visual style gives the film a documentary feel, and this is aided by scenes which show a cameraman and some crew following Dicky, the footage of which would end up in a special social issue segment about 'Crack' on HBO shown on television in the film. In the final quarter, when Micky gets a title shot, one would expect a thrilling boxing match, of which Russell delivers with aplomb. It does not have the gut-wrenching impact of Raging Bull, nor is it as inspiring as Rocky, but Russell's unique way of presenting the fight (he uses intentionally hard lighting, loud, overbearing commentators, and low-bass strings) makes it especially immersive.Perhaps the biggest flaw of The Fighter (but it is not a major one) is that the character of Micky Ward is not screen-stealing enough and seems to play a secondary role to Dicky, who is a supporting character, albeit a very highly stimulating one. Thus, even though the drama is generally involving and exciting, it would seem at times that this film is not so much about Mickey but the strong-minded characters around him that shaped his attitudes toward his outlook in life. In a nutshell, Russell has done an impressive job with an excellent cast, and has shown that Darren Aronofsky (The Wrestler, 2008), who was originally slated to direct this, was not sorely missed.GRADE: A (www.filmnomenon.blogspot.com) All rights reserved.",9,2,3,8 January 2011
Atonement," Atonement is a motion picture of two halves. Seductive at first, but declines later on.
","Nominated for seven Oscars including Best Picture and Best Adapted Screenplay, Atonement is the second major literary adaptation of a novel by director Joe Wright after Pride And Prejudice. In my opinion, Atonement is an overrated British period romance drama. Just because it looks great, works like a Shakespearean play, and boasts a strong, talented main cast does not, by default, imply that the film is Oscar-worthy. While it deserves nominations in the technical categories, and is generally an impressive picture, Atonement is not as consistent as some of 2007's best films.Atonement is a motion picture of two halves. The first hour is thoroughly enjoyable; the story centers around three characters - Briony, Cecilia, Robbie - whose portrayals by Saoirse Ronan, Keira Knightley, James McAvoy respectively are excellent. The screenplay is written in such a way that it incorporates the flashback technique, which is vital for the film because certain scenes are seen from differing points of view and maturity level, and are such interpreted in an entirely different context.Furthermore, through the use of the sound of a typewriter, Oscar-nominated composer Dario Marianelli manages effectively to bring about sudden changes in pacing by varying the - 'tuck, tuck-tuck, tuck-tuck-tuck' - rhythm along with the editing. All these elements make the first half a seductively thrilling one. Unfortunately, the second hour is a far cry from the first. We witness a dramatic drop in quality of acting (mainly the fault of the supporting cast), a less-tightly structured storyline, and a director unsure of the film's final objectives.Atonement started its decline after Romola Garai took over young Ronan for the role of Briony. In fact, the role of Briony is very crucial to the film; to ask three different actresses (especially when the final two's acting capabilities are not up to the task) to take such a demanding role is suicidal. If not for Knightley and McAvoy, great visuals and art direction, Atonement would have fared worse than Michael Clayton, which I feel is the year's most ridiculous Best Picture nominee.SCORE: 7.5/10 (www.filmnomenon.blogspot.com) All rights reserved!",8,0,1,29 July 2010

","Rarely can it be said that a film is genre-defining, but never is that more true than in the case of The Godfather. The romanticism of the Mafia is so vividly portrayed that one can't help but fall in love with the film, and the Corleone family. Well-known for its authentic visuals and the occasional sudden brutal bloody violence, The Godfather earned rave reviews worldwide upon its release, and certainly deserved its success.Solid performances from Marlon Brando and Al Pacino, among others, earned the film an amazing four Oscar nominations for acting roles, with the former awarded an Oscar. The brilliance of The Godfather is that it's able to combine many themes and sub-plots together without confusing the viewer.
