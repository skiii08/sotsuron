The Blair Witch Project," The nightmare of Poe...
","The Blair Witch Project is the most terrifying movie I have ever seen, if not the most horrifying movie ever made.  To try to describe in words such as soul-mortifying, heart-stopping, mind-paralyzing, would not do it justice.  It is something you must experience.  Now, I'm not going to spoil this movie for anyone who hasn't already seen it, but I am going to give you a few tips so you can better enjoy the movie.  First, it is essential that you listen to every bit of dialogue in the movie, especially the town interviews, otherwise you are not going to understand why the ending is so insanely frightening.  Second, go to this movie expecting to be scared and wanting to become part of the movie.  If you go trying to prove to everyone that you were not scared by the Blair Witch, then you'll do it, you won't be scared, and you'll have missed the opportunity of a lifetime to enjoy a truly awesome movie.  The Blair Witch Project is sheer creative genius. And the way it is filmed, although possible borrowed from other films, just adds to the complete madness.  It becomes all too real as we watch the decent into the malstorm of Heather, Josh, and Mike.  And the ending...well folks let's just say that I nearly deficated on myself right there in theatre. My girlfriend thought I was going to rip her arm off, I thought she was going to crush my fingers, and my heart thought it was going to rupture. Intense is not the word.  This movie is the nightmare of Edgar Allan freaking Poe or whoever else you want to compare it to.  And what makes it work is that you never know quite what's going on.  Stephen King once said in his book Danse Macbre that our imaginations are darker than any horror movie could envision.  That although we might be scared by something in a movie, it could have always been worse in our imagination.  Well, that's what makes this movie so flippin' freaky.  You are lead through a series of horrifying events where you are just as confused as the victimes and the climax is so viscious because you have been drug to the darkest corner of your soul and then......you're left there, forced to peer into the inky blackness and left with your mind writhing with fear, branded with the last scene like a hot iron.  'Scary as Hell,' as one critic said, may just be the understatement of the year.",10,1,2,8 August 1999
Amistad," Spielberg's Amistad is beautiful in every way!
","I have long been a fan of the movies put out by Steven Spielberg.  Lately, he has taken true historical events and turned them into such captivatingly beautiful movies that none can compare.  What Spielberg did for the Holocaust in Schindler's List, and WWII in Saving Private Ryan, he did with our terrible past of slavery in Amistad.  While this movie was not hailed by critics far and wide, and was actually considered unsuccessful, those who understand what truly makes a movie and a beautiful story will see the power of Amistad.  As usual, the directing is emotional and heart-wrenching and the cinematography is beautiful.  The acting on all accounts is wonderful and captivates the essence of the time.  The actual story of the Amistad, slavery, and the personal view through Cinque is powerfully moving.  This is a movie not to be missed that pack an emotional punch for any who watch it. But do not expect much action.  It is purely drama, and the story's power lies in the words, expressions, and actions of the actors who make it up. It will really make you think.  Truly one of the most beautiful movies I've seen, once again, Spielberg has proven himself to be the master of putting the human spirit on the silver screen.",10,0,1,13 February 1999
American History X," The most powerful movie I've seen.
","I have just finished American History X and have concluded that it is the most powerful movie I have ever seen.  In accordance to the recent situation in Littleton, Colorado, this movie especially struck home.  And while the acting, cinematography, score, and overall production of this movie was a sheer masterpiece, what makes this movie the truest testament to the soul is its message:  You will reap the consequences of your actions.  Derek's actions, sadly, had gone too far, and the consequences of them were nearly inevitable.  And isn't it sad that this is how we, as humans, can only seem to begin to grasp this concept when something as shattering as the death of a close one draws it blindingly to our attention.  I am a professing Christian, and to any other Christian who is interested in viewing this movie, I must warn you, the language, violence, and sexuality is extremely explicit.  But for once, this is what I appreciate.  The producers did not take the time to muddy their message down for the entire family but gave it to the audience as it is, presented in real life.  As hard as it is to sit through something like this, we do it everyday, in and out, and never give it a second thought.  This movie will wake you up fast, make you question what you believe, and bring you to the harsh but all too true realization that it is up to each and every one of us individually to make a difference for good in the lives we touch.  Otherwise, those lives will be lost, whether to death or a blind and dying world.  If we do not accept this responsibility, we must be willing to accept the responsibility of every tragic situation we could have changed.  After seeing this movie, I personally don't ever want to be a 'could have' again.  I hope that it affects you in the same heart-wrenching manner that it captivated me.  This is what the movies were made for.",Null,0,0,23 April 1999
Bram Stoker's Dracula," Great cinematography, way oversexed!
","I enjoy Francis Ford Coppola, and the cast of his Dracula is great.  But, while Coppola seemed to stick close enough to Stoker's classic, it was extremely over-sexed.  The cinematography of the film is great and very intense. Gary Oldman plays an awesome Dracula and you find yourself having some compassion for something so creepy.  But the movie was ruined for me by the excess nudity and sexuality.  Stoker's classic was a Gothic horror, not Gothic eroticism, which seems to be how Coppola interpreted it.  I had to shut it off after about the first forty-five minutes because of this.  While Coppola is definitely an acclaimed director with a talent for film, I was disappointed and felt that Stoker would not have been impressed by this over-sexed interpretation of his great novel.",Null,0,0,13 February 1999
