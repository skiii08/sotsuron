Hereditary," Truly terrifying and unconventional style of filmmaking
","Horror isn't my regular genre, but decided to give this film a go. The storytelling and cinematography is just amazing, it's unexpected and unlike other tacky horror films truly delivers psychological horror effect, just like the classic cult films. There are some moments which are memorable and tormenting, exactly how should be in a true horror.",10,12,22,1 September 2018
