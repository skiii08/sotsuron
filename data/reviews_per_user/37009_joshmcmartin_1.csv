Scarface," I'm Confused!!!!
","Why is this movie so popular? Is it the violence? It is literally a movie about drug dealers and murders who get high, kill people, and drop f bombs. If you want to see people act like the scum of the earth, then watch this movie. I just can't figure out what the redeeming qualities of this movie are. Who do you root for? I will admit that there are many violent movies that I am a fan of and in these movies the language is terrible, but this is flat out trash. Not only was it a waste of time, but it was a waste of almost 3 hours. Parents, don't let your kids watch this. I was reading something about rap songs that talked about Scarface in the trivia section. I think that says it all. It is sad that people use Tony Montana to make a point or express what they are trying to say.",3,2,7,29 July 2008
