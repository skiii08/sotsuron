It," Don't believe the Hype! Really bad movie given the budget and talent
","I'm done believing the hype and fake reviews coming out of Hollywood. This movie had a huge movement behind it of polished previews, reviews from 'professional' critics, and teasing trailers.
The result? A completely disappointing movie with no pacing, no continuity, questionable plot, and inappropriate content for the youth market who at the time of release was obsessed with the inane 'creepy clown' phenomenon.
I would like my money back!
The children in the movie, and the young people who were fascinated to watch this film were exposed to completely inappropriate imagery that is gratuitous and does nothing to build fear or tension or empathy or investment in the film.
It seems that 'It' is simply a succession of scenes that are supposed to comprise a horror movie, but actually it's only a contrived, overwrought mixture of cliched children and CGI characters.
No recent movie has been more hyped with less enjoyment than 'It'.The hype and fake positive reviews for this movie are totally dishonest.",1,3,6,27 January 2018
Drive," disappointed by the hype
","This film was well-reviewed here on IMDb and in the LA press. I was shocked to see such high reviews for a film. Some of the reviews were excessively positive, i.e. 'best movie I've ever seen', etc.I watched the film and was underwhelmed and surprised by many technical errors and 'leaps of faith' I had to make to believe this storyline.The director seemed to favor awkward pauses in the dialog of the two main characters, Gosling and his neighbor. This wasn't natural. Sometimes there was no dialog when there should have been, and other times there was superfluous and unexplainable dialog, such as the scene in the coffee shop between Gosling and some former client who recognizes him.The screenwriter wants us to believe that the Gosling character, in his 20's, possesses some sort of innate ability to drive from crime scenes, expertly navigating Los Angeles, avoiding the LAPD, while working as a stunt driver and mechanic in Hollywood. In reality, most of these stunt drivers are older, seasoned, unionized veterans and not mysterious young ex-cons or mechanics. The intent was to create mystery and awe for the Gosling character but it just doesn't work. This is right out of the 'Jerry Bruckheimer playbook of romantic character development' (See Gone in Sixty seconds)and I just wasn't buying it.I expected technical expertise in the driving scenes, but they were average and were fraught with technical errors----- visible skid marks where the scenes were rehearsed, inappropriate 'foley' effects for the cars, and the worst case---- where Gosling's character rams Nino's limo at least twice at high speeds, yet his Chevrolet still has functioning headlights and no visible damage! The plot asked too much to believe. All those dead bodies and no police investigation or attention? Why did Gosling's character wear a Hollywood disguise of a bald guy to kill Nino, when the bald crook was already dead------- having been killed in Nino's restaurant? Why does Gosling's character repeat the phrase, 'you got me for five minutes' when each job may be different? Gosling's character seems to operate in a vacuum free of police scrutiny. This movie tries to duplicate characters like Steve Mcqueen, Clint Eastwood, and other mysterious men of few words.The problem is it doesn't work in 'The Driver.'",3,3,6,28 April 2012
Midsommar," Sickness and depression for the sake of it
","THEMATIC SPOILERS AHEAD:
This movie is about a Swedish death cult living in a modern day commune outside of Stockholm somewhere. The film set is a grass field with brand new- built structures that look exactly like a movie set or re-creation of some sort of historical village.The theme, I believe is that cultural communities regard aging and death differently, and this movie goes way over the top in displaying suicide and violent mercy killing. You will be hit over the head with this message until you realize that the violence depicted is totally gratuitous and not redeeming in any way.Despite earlier reviews that portray the female protagonist, Dani, as 'transformed' by the carnage in this film, there is no such journey depicted. I know the writers were trying to make a high-minded culturally shocking film about loss, grief, depression, and death, but this movie fails to generate for me any interest in the American or British visitors to the commune.First of all, the casting is poor. The young actors are flat, juvenile, and if they are supposed to be representative of Graduate students in America then we are in more trouble then I thought. The characterization of the young Americans in particular is poor. One young man is seen 'vaping' during the cult festival, and constantly obsessed with sex and hedonistic pursuits. Hardly a scholar. He acts like teen from 'American Pie.'Another character is portrayed researching his thesis by taking cell phone images, and being as intrusive as possible while ceremonies and deaths occur. Yet, he expresses no real outrage at this! He's concerned his pudgy, flat, dopey friend might now declare his thesis as the exact same study! In fact, none of the American students seem scholarly, of course maybe that's what happens when you choose 'European Summer celebrations' for your Master's thesis. I was not convinced that any of these actors were academics.
Simply poor casting, and mediocre acting. If the basic background presented is not believable, I cannot buy into the subsequent acting.The suicide theme as some sort of graceful 'cross-cultural dying with dignity' is grossly distorted and excessively portrayed. It's simply too much. In fact, any of the lofty themes presented here are not pulled off at all. Despite all the gross, gratuitous shots of suicide, death, and mercy killing, we are supposed to believe that the protagonist Dani, whose family have recently died in a murder-suicide, and is ignored by her pudgy boyfriend throughout, is somehow transformed and at peace and accepted into the death cult. It's terrible and ludicrous.The cinematography is very good, despite taking place on a glorified 'Little House on the Prairie' film set. There are excellent costumes and elaborate rituals portrayed---- and that presents the final problem.This movie is about 15 minutes too long and you should blame the overindulgence of the editor and writer, or director.
There are way too many gratuitous 'open field' scenes with the cast and extras milling or dancing about.
Without any true transformation or redemption, even a maladaptive one, this film is profoundly and purposefully flawed.
Its pure depression and sickness with a faux happy ending.
I enjoyed 'the Witch' and 'Hereditary' immensely. Each was restrained in its presentation of dark themes. Midsommar is not like those films and I couldn't tell the same producers or team was behind it.Sometimes with success comes bigger budgets, bigger egos, and overindulgence.",1,15,24,16 October 2019
