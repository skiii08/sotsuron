The Finest Hours," OK movie but not great
","The movie was OK not as i expected from the trailer that showed a very dramatic movie. The basic idea of the movie is not new it's already used in many other movies specially the titanic I felt they repeated the scene where the ship break into half. The performance of the actors was OK, Chris pine was the only one who acted well. The movie was suppose to be a drama movie but the drama was weak in this movie, I did not feel the suffering of the people who were trying to survive through the storm unlike the Revenant movie where Leonardo Dicaprio showed a great talent. after all the movie was OK but not great, it only deserve a rating of 6.",6,0,1,25 September 2016
Hacksaw Ridge," what a great movie with great acting
",I can not describe this movie with words this is one of the best movies of 2016 and one of the best war movies I have ever seen. This movie is all about love and faith which the main character has displayed very well. I liked the way how he had to endure all the pain in order to not give up on his beliefs. if you are asking me if you should watch this movie I will say absolutely because this movie is full of emotions and it deserve to be watched,8,2,5,19 February 2017
