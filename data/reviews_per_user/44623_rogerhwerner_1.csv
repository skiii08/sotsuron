Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," An interesting story with rather amazing effects
","I've reviewed much of this film's coomentary and it never ceases to amaze me that non-professionals try to evaluate films like professional film critics. As a member of the movie-going public the only issue that matters to me is rather simply stated: Is a film worth spending the time and money to see. Is it fun, entertaining, or otherwise rewarding. Phantom Menace was certainly entertaining and fun and even interesting. That the film earned over a billion dollars gross income stringly suggests that an awful lot of folks agree with me.",7,0,1,8 July 2018
