Scarface," Most overrated film I've ever seen
","So I've heard all of the stories about how so many famous people love this film and how it's the greatest film they've ever seen, so I finally watched it to see what all the fuss was about and was seriously disappointed. I mean don't get me wrong the directing was good and editing was well done but the story wasn't that great, and I think the movie has gained so much of its status because of all of the MTV rappers and shows where it is promoted so these kids who want to be just like the celebrates buy the film, and are brainwashed to think they should like it because their favorite celebs do. Anyway all in all, overrated and not worth my time.",2,15,30,2 July 2007
Transformers," Definitely better than expected.
","I want to start out saying that I am not a Micheal Bay fan, but this movie is definitely worth seeing. Visually the film is stunning, and during some of the aircraft sequences it had a bit of a 'Top Gun' feel to it. Shia Leboef really did a great job acting in this film, and it was a treat to see John Tuturro have a cameo in the film as well. My only complaints with the film is that the dialoge between the robots was a little cheesy along with some of the gags, and Jon Voight's acting (the secretary of defense) was really bad (I had a hard time looking past that when he was on screen), but if you can get past those few flaws it is a fun filled action ride for the whole family.",7,4,8,21 August 2007
WALLÂ·E," An OK pixar movie
","Let me start off by saying Wall-E is not a bad movie, in fact its a very cute movie with a handful of laughs at Wall-E's curiosity and awkwardness. Kids will eat it up. The sound was excellent since there is hardly any dialogue at all until halfway through the movie. There is a good message behind the film and all, but to be honest I got bored. Sure the animation was top notch and visually may be one of the best pixar movies to date, but the story lacked in my opinion and failed to keep me interested. The best part of this film was the short film before the movie started. 'Presto' is by far the best pixar short I've ever seen, it was worth my $7.50 just to see it. In conclusion, it's not a bad movie to go see on a rainy day or if your kids are dying to go to the pictures, but if I were you I'd wait and rent it when it comes out on DVD.",6,4,10,14 July 2008
