The Blair Witch Project," Purposely Amateurish
","I love this movie. I could've did this one but I didn't and I congratulate those who did. One criticism, however, too much dark spoils it for most viewers. I was watching the reaction of other moviegoers throughout the film and I saw confusion and boredom in many faces. Any more low budget filmmakers in this genre should take heed. The tide is in, it's no longer novel, so keep that in mind.",Null,1,1,3 August 1999
The Blair Witch Project," Raw
",I was put off by the constant darkness but after thinking about it that was an intregal part of the true-to-life experience I believe the filmmakers desired us to undergo. I hope more legitimate movies such as this explode onto theater screens. This one proves it don't take a Spielberg to make a great film. It's the scariest movie since 'The Texas Chain-Saw Massacre'.,Null,1,1,31 August 1999
Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," Critics thrive on real issues, are irritated by creativity
","To all the critic believers: Don't for a minute waste more time letting critics dissuade you from seeing this contemporary masterpiece. Media hypes 'em up, the critics bring 'em down. Not without fault however, this is still one we all must see (and multiple times at that). Who hasn't read 'Huckleberry Finn'? Who hasn't been to a baseball game? Who hasn't tasted apple pie? For your own cultural sake, ENJOY THIS GREAT MOVIE!! (And encourage others to support this film so that the complete saga can continue to be told in spectacular fashion).",Null,0,0,23 May 1999
Reservoir Dogs," Wouldn't recommend to Mother
","I'd like my mom to see this just for the great lines and wit. I'm sure she'd love Quentin T. but the violence is a bit overboard. However, I recommend this film to everybody else. One of my top 10. Favorite scene? The tipping argument. I've had this opinion a very long time and never had a good opportunity to voice it. Thanks Quentin and thank Steve for the great delivery.",Null,0,1,31 August 1999
