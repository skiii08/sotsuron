Angels & Demons," An emotionally dull but well directed thriller
","Now I have never read any of Dan Brown's novels, they are all mainly too long. The Da Vinci Code was mainly a complete bore so I lost interest in both it's sequels when they came out. However I happened to see this film a few days ago and realized that it really wasn't that bad. When the Illuminati kidnap four cardinals that are possibilities to succeed the old Pope after he passed away. The church summons Robert Langdon (Tom Hanks) to find out how and why the Illuminati have returned and to hopefully find the cardinals. Now, I don't think this is a great film by any stretch but it is a very enjoyable and exciting thriller. It is one of these disposable thrillers that you watch on a boring day. The film has some very well directed sequences and the editing as well as the score were both excellent. The content was shallow and if you look for a film that's more in depth, you will be disappointed. However for those who look for a fun thriller that's exciting and features a straight forward story with a few twists and turns, look no further.",7,0,0,3 October 2017
The Death of Stalin," A crude, politically incorrect but also intelligent satire.
","'The Death of Stalin' saw a really limited release in 2017 with very limited reviews and opinions. It's wide release around the world was in March of 2018, which means I can classify this as a 2018 film. I can predict this is going to be one of the best films this year. The picture was directed by Armando Iannucci who generally directed TV shows, however has received critical acclaim for his 2010 project In the Loop. After the Soviet Union dictator Joseph Stalin (who ruled Russia for the past 29 years) unexpectedly dies. His cabinet made most notably of Nikita Khrushchev, Georgy Malenkov and Vyacheslav Molotov is falling apart trying to figure out what direction the Soviet Union is going to go in next. Steve Buscemi plays Khrushchev, it's great seeing Buscemi in a leading role for a film again. He plays Khrushchev with enough sympathy but also an over the top and xany behaviour. This clearly is a parody of who we assume Khrushchev was. The film boasts a very interesting ensemble which includes: Jeffrey Tambor, Andrea Riseborough, Olga Kurylenko, Jason Isaacs, Michael Palin and Simon Russell Beale. The majority of these actors are incredibly underrated and it's great seeing them get the opportunity to play unique and interesting characters. In particular I'm going to single out Simon Russell Beale and Jason Isaacs. Beale plays Lavrenti Beria, he is a member of Stalin's cabinet. His performance is truly diabolical, at first he is stone cold. He has no problem with sentencing people to death and laughing with it. He acts natural around horrible events which makes him very darkly funny. It is very obvious that he has his own ambitions. Isaacs is Field Marshal Zhukov, he is in charge of the Red Army. There is a sense of ruthlessness behind his eyes that makes him a force to be reckoned with. The film is really cleverly written, never afraid to drop f bombs and other curse words. What was interesting is that both Beria and Khrushchev are trying to paint themselves as the reformers. Their conflict is comical because they act like little children with constant bickering and no problem solving. A classic theme is when a leader dies the line between order and chaos disappears, anarchy arises within a land. The Death of Stalin offers an interesting spin on this idea as the afore order was the control of a dictator who was responsible for the death of millions. The camera work is fast and kinetic. It helps drawing the audience in and keeps them locked during the many conversation scenes. The biggest issue I had was with the character played by Olga Kurylenko. Without trying to spoil anything, there is an interesting character presented, however she doesn't seem to go anywhere. She is barely in the movie and didn't add much, this is my only flaw with the Death of Stalin. I highly recommend this film, however I must warn you this is not a drama. Many elements of this film that would generally be considered as atrocities are pulled for laughs here. If you're going to see this please keep the expectations on check. This is the closest thing we've had to a Monty Python's style of comedy.",8,58,82,24 March 2018
Darkest Hour," An average motion picture headed by a magnetic performance.
","Darkest Hour was the second Best Picture nominee about the battle of Dunkirk at the Oscars this year. In May of 1940, British troops have been trapped on the beaches of Dunkirk. The Labour party demands the resignation of the incumbent prime minister, Neville Chamberlain. This leads to the controversial Winston Churchill (Gary Oldman) receiving the job of prime minister. Churchill who has suffered criticism for his leadership during the Gallipoli campaign in World War I is a choice that doesn't fit well with the people of England including King George (Ben Mendelsohn) himself. In this darkest hour Churchill must find a choice to either fight or to negotiate peace with Adolf Hitler. Without the help of the US government of President Franklin D. Roosevelt, Churchill is pushed to his limits. Darkest Hour is a authentic and slow movie (even though its only 2 hours long). It features a small ensemble of interesting choices led by Gary Oldman in his deserved Academy Award winning performance. He pulls of the small mannerisms of Churchill with such ease, speaks in an authentic accent and looks great in the makeup that Oldman simply becomes Churchill. He is especially convincing in scenes where he yells his speech in front of parliament. Oldman even uses many of the Churchill mannerisms to his advantage to give some comedic relief. This helps the audience to be drawn to his character. The rest of the cast consists of Kristin Scott Thomas as Churchill's wife, she gives him strength and courage and her chemistry with Oldman is perfect. Lily James adds youth and inexperience and Ben Mendelsohn is gripping in his brief role as the King. The film feels authentic due to the great costume which consists of old fashioned suits, uniforms and hats. This together with the production design makes the setting of 1940 London even more authentic. The film makes the smart decision to keep things light hearted when necessary. Especially towards the start which shows Churchill to be somewhat of an outsider and slightly out of touch. Besides the actors, costume or production design the best word to describe this film would be competent. There is nothing interesting about Joe Wright's direction or Dario Marianelli's music. The writing feels clunky and wooden in certain scenes, especially at the start when people exposit about Churchill's character and past. As stated before, the film had some unexpected humour, which works for the most part. However the film unfortunately never becomes all that serious until the very end, and even at that point the picture never really becomes suspenseful. Even with this being a somewhat conventional drama, I would still recommend everyone to see this in particular for Gary Oldman's performance and for the important message of unity. Which in today's world is often forgotten especially in times with 'America First' or Brexit.",7,0,2,18 March 2018
Rogue One: A Star Wars Story," Entertaining new take on the Star Wars universe
","Rogue One: A Star Wars story is the first Star Wars Anthology film. First the positives: the action scenes were gritty and well filmed, K2SO was great comedic relief. And the final act of Rogue One was excellent with high stakes and tense action. Unfortunately Rogue One suffers from weak characters and a thin story. In short if the previous films didn't make you like Star Wars, this one definitely won't. It definitely is entertaining and not dull like Episodes I&II but it also isn't as engaging as the original trilogy or The Force Awakens. All the characters had their moments but I never cared about them truly. Overall my favorite part of this film were the brief but effective scenes featuring Darth Vader. Voiced once again by the ever great James Earl Jones.",6,0,2,11 February 2017
Captain Marvel," Glossy action cannot cover up a dull story.
","I've held back on reviewing Captain Marvel, I wanted to let the film sink in and allow myself to come to a proper conclusion on my thoughts. One thing I will make clear from the very beginning. I wanted to enjoy this film. I rooted for Brie Larson (she was my top pick for the role of Captain Marvel). Marvel Studios have overall done a very satisfying job not just in adapting their comic book characters but also crafting very enjoyable films in the process. Unfortunately Captain Marvel is a dull mess with a weak story, an uninteresting hero and weak villains. The film succeeds in the humour department, the film has clever jokes and funny lines, especially between Carol (Brie Larson) and Nick Fury (Samuel L. Jackson). Praise needs to be given to the special effects team that managed to digitally deage Jackson in order to make him seem like a younger version of Nick Fury. This is the first time where the special effects didn't bother me. Usually the actor looks unnatural, as if they are wearing a digital mask. Jackson however, just appears younger, there is nothing that seemed out of place. The rest of the special effects also work spectacularly well (of course, its Marvel). The sets are futuristic, convincing and bring across the Utopian world of the main character. The action scenes are exciting, well shot and easy to follow. But this felt like a Phase 1 Marvel film to me. A film mainly required as set up for Avengers: Endgame, I find this to be extremely unfortunate because this character deserves better. Carol Danvers doesn't seemingly go through an arc, her worldview is never challenged which doesn't trigger a growth within her character. The strongest superhero films built an emphasis on a flawed main character whose experiences and mistakes shape his or her journey (think Spider-Man 2, The Dark Knight, Iron Man or Wonder Woman). Larson's character travels to Earth and is confronted with our way of life, which lead to some of the funniest scenes in the film. She is a fish out of water and perhaps doesn't see humanity the way we do. However, what does she take away? How will this impact her personality in the future? The character felt poorly written and I never had the impression I was watching a human being on screen. Her character felt constructed and not like a tangible and complex person. Larson tries her best with the role but the limited material drags her performance down to simply being a badass superhero with a sense of wit. Larson is a fantastic actress with an awesome range. She possesses so many more skills as an actress and the film doesn't allow her to express them. I hope that in future sequels the character can ripen up and grow on me more. There is certainly potential there, however a more independent and creative voice I feel needs to be present in order for the films to change their focus (i.e. Richard Donner, Tim Burton, Christopher Nolan, Sam Raimi, Taika Waititi or James Gunn).",5,0,0,27 June 2019
Aquaman," Rousing excitement.
","Aquaman is the latest installment in DC's cinematic universe. Their sets of films have generally left me personally, with mixed reactions. I enjoyed Wonder Woman's refreshingly emotional narrative and Justice League's lighthearted chemistry between the main cast. Films like Batman v Superman and Suicide Squad however suffered strongly from overly convoluted stories and unlikable characters. Aquaman luckily succeeds with the adventure formula, presenting a exciting, fun and action packed narrative headed with a charismatic lead actor. When a lighthouse keeper (Temuera Morrison) shares a romance with the Queen of Atlantis (Nicole Kidman) results in the birth of a half blood son, Arthur (Jason Momoa). The Queen is forced to return to Atlantis where she is sacrificed for her treachery. This fuels the hate within Arthur's half brother Orm (Patrick Wilson) to wage war with the surface world. In order to protect humanity Arthur is trained and helped by Vulko (Willem Dafoe) and Mera (Amber Heard) to go on a deadly mission to dethrone Orm. A story that has been seen a zillion times in superhero movies I feel. But what makes Aquaman so much fun is it's fast paced energy, charismatic performances, production design and action scenes. Jason Momoa really puts his stamp on the character of Arthur Curry, a drifter who has no will or ambition to become the King. He shares great father / son chemistry with Morrison where the audience really buys their loving relationship. Unfortunately the character becomes less significant as the story gets going. Kidman for her limited amount of screen time shows off prowess, strength and beauty. Patrick Wilson is a competent villain, certainly the best in the entire DCEU, there was potential at the start to make him more than a two dimensional bad guy. Unlike Killmonger this arc feels unfinished and the villain loses the initial interest. However unlike Steppenwolf, Ares, Zod and especially Lex Luthor, there was a actually a sense of threat that functioned about Wilson. His ambition and blood thirst makes him effective but nothing special, he is a standard MCU villain. Willem Dafoe also has great chemistry with Momoa as this mentor figure and it was certainly nice to see Dafoe in a superhero film again. However there also were some let downs in the acting department, Amber Heard is wooden and shares no chemistry with Momoa. I fully understand why Wan decided to cast Dolph Lundgren in this movie, but he unfortunately is an incredibly stiff actor that doesn't even possess this guilty pleasure 1980s charisma (something that Arnold Schwarzenegger, Chuck Norris or Christopher Lambert perfected). Some of the cgi effects still look unconvincing especially a deaging effect used on a certain actor. The story is contrived and thin and is only supposed to lead from one action scene to the next, from one exotic and interesting location to another. And as this, Aquaman succeeds. Fans of adventure serials and lighthearted superhero movies look no further. For those who look for something with more depth (no pun intended) should perhaps stay away. This is not comparable with The Dark Knight, The Winter Soldier, Logan or Infinity War. But for fans of Brendan Fraser's The Mummy will feel right at home.",7,0,1,5 January 2019
Deadpool 2," A self aware spectacle.
","After the massive success of the first Deadpool film, it was inevitable that a sequel would be produced. This time the merc with a mouth (Ryan Reynolds) has to protect a little boy (Julian Dennison) from the time travelling assassin Cable (Josh Brolin, in his second appearance in a superhero blockbuster). This is about as much I will say about Deadpool 2 story wise because there many twists and turns that I didn't expect, especially from a Deadpool movie. I am going to be honest, I did enjoy the first film, I didn't love it though, there were a few moments where the characters annoyed me. The action in the first film also didn't impress me, bad cgi fights. However they improve on almost every aspect when it comes to the sequel. This time they switched directors, from Tim Miller (who will helm the new Terminator reboot) to David Leitch (John Wick and Atomic Blonde). Leitch is one of the best directors when it comes to shooting action sequences, and he shows of his brilliant skills a lot in the new Deadpool film. There a long shots that show off the very well choreographed fight scenes. This gives the film a sense of wonderment in a way of 'how does he do it?' but also realism. I was genuinely surprised that this film had me as involved as it did, especially because the first film did not always work for me. This is a genuinely interesting film, with a very cliched story pulled of in a non cliche way. The film is also incredibly funny, this film throws a lot of jokes at you, making fun of the MCU, the DC universe and even itself. Not all of the jokes work, but when you laugh for minutes straight, you won't notice that a few didn't. However there were some genuine moments where I got invested into the story, in particular Josh Brolin as Cable. His story makes sense and his motivation does, however there are some interesting twists and turns his character goes through. Not all of it was well written though, it seemed like that characters were presented a certain way and were deliberately changed to simply shock the audience. Sometimes this works when the audience gets an idea of who the character is, however in this film I felt that these changes felt too artificial, particularly singling out Russell, played by Julian Dennison. There is nothing wrong with his performance, he brings a lot of emotion and laughter to his character, however the sudden switch did not always work. Same thing can also be said about Cable. Reynolds and Brolin are truly the stars of the film, Reynolds brings his charisma and charm to Deadpool, whilst Brolin plays the straight man thrown into such a ridiculous situation. Overall I am probably in the minority as I believe that Deadpool 2 is a superior film to the first, it has a more compelling story with a more likeable protagonist. There is a more organic and interesting story that does have some emotional scenes, however it also delivers on what makes Deadpool so special.",8,3,6,19 May 2018
Ready Player One," Superficial entertainment by Spielberg.
","Ready Player One is based on the Ernest Cline novel of the same name, however the film adaptation is largely different to the original novel. In the year 2045, the world is a dystopia. There is no place for humanity to go, only the OASIS. The OASIS is a virtual reality video game that allows the player to create their own worlds and experience adventures of your deepest imagination. When the creator of the OASIS, Halliday (Mark Rylance) dies. He leaves behind three keys to secret easter egg which are hidden somewhere deep within the OASIS. Any player has the opportunity to find the easter egg and if they do, they inherit all of Halliday's riches and full control of the OASIS. One of the those players is Wade Watts (Tye Sheridan), a down on his luck teenager who lives in a gigantic trailer park with his aunt. His opponents are the evil company known as IOI, run by the devilish Sorrento (Ben Mendelsohn). I was incredibly excited for Ready Player One. The trailers were fairly vague on the story and characters. However they showed off some amazing references and characters from the 1980s. I was hoping to see another gem in the realms of E.T. The Extra Terrestrial, Raiders of the Lost Ark or Jurassic Park. I hoped that this film would bring back some of that Spielberg magic that I thought was missing in his latest films. I left the theatre satisfied but still yearning for more and not in a good way. The positives first, the action scenes in this film are amazing. They are incredibly thrilling and brought me back to my childhood memories in which the DeLorean from Back to the Future could go up against King Kong. Whenever action hit the screen, the film started to pick up and it was incredibly entertaining and thrilling. One segment in particular was fun, in which the main characters visit a famous film set (won't spoil which). The main story itself was also interesting, where Wade and his virtual friends delve deep into Halliday's life and backstory. Halliday even though his role is extremely limited was by far the best character of the whole film. The idea that perplexed him to create the OASIS is incredibly fascinating. However the rest of the characters really did let me down. Tye Sheridan is a very talented actor, however there are very little emotional grounds that his character Wade hits. I was extremely disappointed by that, a mid act twist really lost me and my connection with his character disappeared. The writing for his character was very basic and I was disappointed by that. Same thing can be said about Ben Mendelsohn as the villain. His character is very similar to Director Krennic from Rogue One. Mendelsohn is always great as a villain, however they are often underutilised and uninteresting. This is why I enjoyed so much in Darkest Hour as he really played against character. The rest of the cast also feels a bit generic and mediocre. The themes feel a little hamfisted (particularly through Mendelsohn). I enjoyed many aspects of Ready Player One, the special effects are simply incredible. One of Spielberg's best looking movies. The score by Alan Silvestri added adrenaline to the story and felt right at home with the subject matter. I thought the story was interesting, but it felt a little thin as I guess Spielberg and the screenwriters wanted to make room for more movie / game references. The characters are underutilised especially Wade Watts. I would definitely recommend a viewing for fans of movies and video games. This can be incredibly entertaining on a superficial surface level viewing. A overall fun and thrilling adventure that could've used some better writing and characters but one I can certainly see myself watching again.",6,2,5,31 March 2018
Rocky IV," Patriotic garbage with OK acting and good fights
","Rocky IV was released in 1985. It became the most successful entry in the whole franchise. So what is the 'story' of this film. Due to a tragedy Rocky Balboa (Sylvester Stallone) has to go up against Ivan Drago (Dolph Lundgren). An evil boxing machine from the Sowjet union. In short if you wanna see America kick Russia's butt in boxing? Than here you go. The biggest issue with Rocky IV is the story and the characters. Most of the characters in this movie are idiots, and the ones who aren't become idiots. Why should the audience care about Rocky? He's no longer the underdog from Philadelphia. There is little to no story either, just fights or training montages. Which is why this film even gets this score, as the music is fun, cheesy 1980s and the sequences are nice and well made.",5,1,3,11 February 2017
Die Hard 2," Typical popcorn film
","Die Hard 2 Die Harder follows the same tropes as most action movie sequel. It goes bigger and automatically thinks it's better. The plot of the second film is almost identical to the first, but this time it is at an airport. It was directed by Renny Harlin who also directed Cliffhanger a little later. He is known for making dumb popcorn action flicks. And this one is no exception. There are a lot of fun sequences, but over all I felt very bored watching this film. Unlike the 1st, 3rd and even 4th.",5,3,4,4 April 2017
Avengers: Endgame," Most definitely the most anticipated film of the year.
","Avengers Endgame is the conclusion to 11 years worth of MCU build up. A 3 hour long epic superhero adventure packed with eye candy action and emotional moments that suffers from a few minor inconsistencies in story and characters. The promotional material has been incredibly vague and therefore I'll keep it too with this review too to not ruin the fun. After the 'events' of Infinity War, the Avengers are forced to reassemble and take on Thanos (Josh Brolin) once more. That's all I'll say about the plot. I was genuinely surprised with the direction that was taken for many characters. Unlike Infinity War, the heroes are in front center this time. There were genuine arcs that made me love and feel for these characters yet again and all of the actors were fantastic. Robert Downey jr, Chris Evans, Scarlett Johansson, Mark Ruffalo and Chris Hemsworth are at the centre of this movie and there characters were all the best, emotional and surprising for me. Especially Ruffalo lightened up the mood with a comedic performance. At this point the chemistry and comradeship between the Avengers is undeniably the best part of these films. Just seeing these characters on screen talking and interacting was truly amazing. The conversations and relationships they share with each other is vital to the films success and it absolutely delivers. The humour is on point, the dialogue snappy and real and the fight just as brutal and significant as before. All other actors too gave very effective performance but I will admit that there were two that disappointed me a little. Brie Larson (Captain Marvel) and surprisingly Josh Brolin (Thanos). I haven't seen Captain Marvel but the use of her character in Endgame didn't do much for me. She had no personality and Larson (a terrific actress) didn't have the inviting charisma that a Scarlett Johansson has. Whilst he stole the show in Infinity War, Brolin's Thanos is merely reduced to a big evil villain in this film. I get that most of the screen time and story was dedicated to the Avengers and that Infinity War was Thanos' movie. But if I'm supposed to judge Endgame as a film on its own, his character definitely felt underused. Some jumbled story parts that best shouldn't be overly analysed aside. Avengers Endgame is an absolutely experience from start to finish. Perhaps the best film in the MCU yet I don't know how they can possibly top this. Wrapped up with a nice bow and tie, Endgame is a satisfying blockbuster for all fans of the MCU and superhero films in general.",8,4,13,24 April 2019
Avengers: Infinity War," A perfect Blockbuster.
","Avengers: Infinity War is not only the 3rd Avengers film or 19th installment in the Marvel Cinematic Universe but also marks the 10 year anniversary since the start of everything MCU with the first Iron Man film. A lot of expectations are put onto this film, this is the film that unites the Avengers with the Guardians of the Galaxy to take down the greatest threat yet, Thanos (Josh Brolin). I will not go too much in depth with the story, only referring to what we saw in the trailers. The cast in this film is absolutely ridiculous, Robert Downey jr, Chris Hemsworth, Mark Ruffalo, Chris Evans, Scarlett Johansson, Don Cheadle, Benedict Cumberbatch, Tom Holland, Chadwick Boseman, Zoe Saldana, Karen Gillan, Tom Hiddleston, Paul Bettany, Elizabeth Olsen, Anthony Mackie, Sebastian Stan, Idris Elba, Peter Dinklage, Dave Bautista, Vin Diesel, Bradley Cooper, Gwyneth Paltrow, Benicio Del Toro, Josh Brolin and Chris Pratt. With such a huge cast it will be naturally difficult for the writers and directors to successfully balance all of these characters, giving them enough to do. In most cases it works, in others however I felt that more development was required. A good choice by the filmmakers was the idea to split up these characters all over the universe. They were paired up in smaller groups, this gives the opportunity to bring in some of the classic dynamics that we have come to love and also set up some new conflicts. However what was done with one relatively small group in the first Avengers is done here with multiple groups. This causes some characters to lose their strength in development that made them so interesting in their previous films. This is why I recommend to have seen some of the Marvel films beforehand, otherwise this film won't emotionally move you as you aren't familiar with most of the storylines and characters. One of my biggest worries about Infinity War was Thanos, most other villains in the MCU were boring uninteresting entities that the heroes simply had to face and punch their way out. They were never interesting and there was never a sense where the audience could understand them. Luckily Thanos breaks that tradition, Josh Brolin gives a very conflicted performance of a creature that wants balance in the universe, which is why he wants to collect the infinity stones. The audience receives a motivation, (which I will not spoil) that makes this character understandable and to a degree even relatable. You never root for Thanos but you understand him at the same time. Brolin easily gives us the best MCU villain and one of the strongest comic book villains in years, easily exceeding Tom Hiddleston and Michael B. Jordan. The same thing can unfortunately not be said about the hero characters. Some receive extra material that allows them to shine as the great actors they are, notably Robert Downey jr, who adds the typical eccentric charisma of Tony Stark but there also seems to be sense of terror and panic within his portrayal. Downey jr has now played the genius, playboy, philanthropist for 10 years, it's still awesome to see that this Academy Award nominee puts this amount of effort into a role he has now played for a decade. Zoe Saldana also has some key scenes to really shine, especially when she comes to realize who the attacker is. Gamora has never been my favorite Guardian of the Galaxy. However this is the first time where I find her character interesting. Overall Infinity War is a popcorn spectacle with a great villain and some terrific performances, however the different tones can be jarring sometimes and most other hero characters receive very little development.",8,2,6,28 April 2018
A Quiet Place," A silent creep.
","A Quiet Place is the directorial debut for John Krasinski who also plays the main character, Lee Abbott. The family Abbott now lives in a post apocalyptic future where strange alien creatures have invaded. They can't see or smell well but are excellent in hearing, so far that they can track down potential prey with the sound of a little electronic toy. This family must now survive in this world making as little noise as possible. They don't wear shoes, eat out of leaves instead of plates and in my opinion the most interesting and unconventional aspect, speaking through sign language. A Quiet Place was a really unsettling and suspenseful film, mainly because it was quiet. Sounds that are made stand out so much that it honestly hurt my ears. The sound design is excellent, loud and irritating. This helps to build up the suspense and fear. The actors were also believable in their respectable roles, John Krasinski plays the caring husband and father. He has to keep his family together and protect them, however there is a deep frustration hidden beneath this character, in fact within all of the characters. Sometimes you can see that he wants to burst out but he can't, this frustration is captured beautifully by glances, groans and other small emotes. Krasinski real life wife, Emily Blunt also plays his wife in the film Evelyn. She is the caring mother, that must show strength and shelter to her children. There is also the sense of panic and terror hidden beneath her eyes. Blunt is an actress that is often unappreciated at large Award ceremonies such as the Oscars. This is unfortunate as she shows here once again how excellent she really is. This film is told with very little dialogue, mainly through facial emotes and sign language. The fact that all actors remain so believable with so little dialogue is commendable. Krasinski also shows himself to be a talented director, he sets up potential challenges really well for example a nail poking out, that could potentially later be a danger. The creatures themselves unfortunately weren't that scary or interesting, big CGI monsters. They didn't evoke this feeling of terror and phobia like the xenomorph did in the original Alien films. There was one interesting element towards the end that got me thinking about the creatures and I wished a little more of this. However this is really nitpicking, the film itself is excellent, a great creature feature in the vein of Jaws, Alien and Predator. What pushes this film over the edge onto being a great film is that it has elements of mainstream cinema, it does have jump scares (that were a little irritating) but also some great artistic choices. Most prominently the choice of very little dialogue. Overall this is a memorable, unsettling and frightening experience that I would highly recommend to fans of good horror / thrillers, creature films and good films in general.",9,2,3,24 April 2018
Star Wars: Episode VIII - The Last Jedi," A fresh new direction for the Star Wars pictures
","Star Wars Episode VIII is a very different film for the star wars franchise. It ditches some of the classic themes of good vs evil to tell a different story. The film once again focuses on Rey who wants to convince the older Luke Skywalker to join Leia and the Resistance, to fight the evil First Order and it's devilishly evil leader Snoke. At the same time, Leia and the rest of the Resistance, including Poe Dameron go through their own troubles while trying to flee from the First Order. The entire cast from Star Wars: The Force Awakens returns, Daisy Ridley, John Boyega, Adam Driver, Oscar Isaac and Carrie Fisher in her final film role. Mark Hamill has to singled out, his performance as the legendary Luke Skywalker is well, legendary. Luke is broken and fragile in this film. He has a very little sense for hope, something that angered many fans of the character. I think that this was a very brave move that turned many ideas about the franchise on its head. Daisy Ridley is also very good at showing the youth within her character. She is filled with hope and believes that with Luke's help they can win the fight against the First Order. Rey is very naive, something that a Mary Sue really isn't. What really surprised me about The Force Awakens was the treatment of Kylo Ren. This is continued in The Last Jedi. Kylo is treated like a main character, who has his flaws but who doesn't really come across as this evil. Kylo simply is a human being who made a decision, the line between good and evil seems to fade away. Carrie Fisher who thankfully received a much larger role in this film than she did in The Force Awakens, enlightens the screen with hope, beauty and joy. She simply gives the best performance of her entire career. Same thing can be said about Hamill. This film isn't entirely flawless. Without spoiling anything, the side plot involving Finn and the new character of Rose felt stretched out and almost pointless. The arc for Finn seems rehashed from The Force Awakens, which is unfortunate as this arc could've easily be given to his partner. Kelly Marie Tran's performance is good, however her character feels rushed. Same thing can be said about Vice Admiral Holdo, played by Laura Dern. Dern is a terrific actress, who is good in the film and the lesson she teaches is important however the way her character was written seemed a bit weak. So overall I really loved The Last Jedi. It did feel 30 minutes too long with the Finn and Rose story. However everything else involving Rey, Luke, Kylo and Poe was really interesting and it expanded the Star Wars lore. I think Star Wars fans need to let this film sink in more. After all, episode V was divisive for its originality however that is now seen as the best film in the series.",9,1,3,18 January 2018
Die Hard," One of the best action films of all time
","Die Hard was released in 1988. It stars Bruce Willis (action giant Arnold Schwarzenegger was considered as well). It was directed by John McTiernan who previously directed Predator and would go on to direct The Hunt For Red October and Die Hard With A Vengeance. Bruce Willis is a great action hero. Not only is he able to kick ass but he is a real person that you can relate to. You like this guy and you care for him. Making the action more thrilling and suspenseful as you don't want him to die. The plot is nice and simple, giving the narrative a sense of claustrophobia as there is not much space to hide. Die Hard still holds up as a great, fun and suspenseful action film. It has great characters, a fun plot and amazing action scenes.",10,0,0,4 April 2017
Die Hard with a Vengeance," The best Die Hard sequel
","Die Hard 3 changes things up again to feel more fresh once again. The producers knew that they couldn't continue putting John McClane in these confined areas making him kill random terrorists. This time McClane will be moving around an entire city solving riddles together with a partner. Zeus played by Samuel L. Jackson. The film was once again directed by John McTiernan. I believe this was a good choice as he was the one who directed the first one and he would know how to build on it. In New York a terrorist who calls himself Simon threatens to blow up random areas in New York City if John McClane failed to solve his riddles. So the recently suspended John McClane (Bruce Willis) is put back on duty. First of the increase of the scale this time really works. John McClane this time doesn't crawl through shafts but instead drives taxis through Central Park. He is once again challenged and the plot makes sense too as the film actually builds on the first film. It is a sequel that doesn't feel rehashed and tired, the story once again is totally engaging. The action sequences are gritty and entertaining, John McClane is at his roughest here. I really liked Bruce Willis in this movie, his chemistry with Samuel L. Jackson really blossomed. Whilst I don't think it is as good as the original as the ending feels a bit tacked on, no spoilers but I think the last 15-20 minutes really feels added on simply to bring more closure. But overall this is the best 'Die Hard' sequel, it builds on the original, keeps some of the tropes the same. But also has growing characters and an interesting story with terrific action. This absolutely is a very underrated action movie, I highly recommend it.",9,1,1,5 April 2017
Murder on the Orient Express," A competently made remake that no one asked for.
","I have not been too kind on Hollywood remakes. Generally they take a film that was very successful and want to 'recreate it' for younger audiences, hoping that it would make even more money. However often these films are the remakes of brilliant originals and whilst these remakes can be very entertaining, they are still miles away from the quality of the original. Murder on the Orient Express is such a film. It has an amazing cast (like the original) which consists of great names such as Kenneth Branagh, Willem Dafoe, Johnny Depp, Judi Dench, Daisy Ridley, Michelle Pfeiffer, Penelope Cruz and Josh Gad. All of these actors give their everything, in particular Branagh who is amazing as the eccentric Hercule Poirot. He manages to recreate the character but also keep the traits that made him so memorable when the likes such as Albert Finney and Peter Ustinov played them. However the rest of the characterizations felt dull, I was uninterested in them plus I saw the original and knew how it ended. So even in that category the film failed to surprise me. What made the original film so good was that when Poirot was investigating it felt like that he was investigating real people. The characters were all flashed out well thanks to excellent writing. So when Poirot spots something odd, you as the viewer are ultimately challenged to re watch and check whether you can see what he sees. You were investigating with Poirot. In this adaptation the characters were so one dimensional that I honestly didn't care. I knew the ending of the original and so didn't care about the actual murder either. The film looks beautiful, it has awesome camera work and costume design. The actors do great and Branagh will no doubt catch Oscar buzz for his performance. I only recommend this film for audiences who have never read the Agatha Christie novel or seen the original film. This is because that way at least the murder remains interesting, if we know the conclusion the film loses much of this effect. The original had great characters that were three dimensional and felt real. There was re watch value, this film is a perfect Netflix watch. If you have never seen the original you will be entertained while it lasts but you are not encouraged to watch it again (at least I'm not).",6,1,5,11 November 2017
Black Panther," A combination of a political character study and a superhero extravaganza that doesn't always mix.
","Black Panther is the newest installment in the Marvel Cinematic Universe. Chadwick Boseman reprises his role from Captain America Civil War. The rest of the picture also features an great ensemble of well known actors. These include Michael B. Jordan, Lupita Nyong'o, Martin Freeman, Daniel Kaluuya, Forest Whitaker and Andy Serkis. All of whom give serviceable performances. After the events of Civil War, T'Challa (Boseman) returns to his home Wakanda, a land that is deeply hidden within the African forest. Wakanda has been hidden from the majority of the world for centuries, Challa has to make a choice when an unexpected enemy comes to take his place. Boseman plays Challa / Black Panther with a mixture of wisdom, patriotism but also a lack of experience when it comes to the world. This is a interesting combination that really pays off when T'Challa meets with the main villain of the film played by Michael B. Jordan. The idea of a advanced culture with innovative technology that remains hidden from the world is very interesting. The majority of people from Wakanda believe that this makes the world a better place. However when Killmonger shows up these ideas are challenged through his character. Killmonger is the best villain the MCU has had since Loki, this is because both T'Challa and Killmonger can learn a lot from each other. This aspect is easily the best thing about Black Panther, unfortunately the film only becomes compelling after we pass the first act. The first act consists of a generic superhero plot in which T'Challa and his team race after Ulysses Klaue (Andy Serkis) in order to capture him. This is important for the story in the long run but left me very emotionally empty. It also gives very little attention to Killmonger who only becomes interesting after the first hour. There is plenty of humour in Black Panther, the best jokes in the film came from Shuri (Letitia Wright) who plays the sister of T'Challa. She added plenty of self awareness that made myself and the all of the audience roar in the theatres. Unfortunately Black Panther also suffers from the same issues that Guardians of the Galaxy vol 2 and Thor Ragnarok suffered from and that is the fact that jokes are implemented in the wrong scenes. Sometimes a scene is meant to be serious until a character cracks a joke killing the impact of the scene. The action scenes also let me down, most of the them were too cgi heavy and I would've prefered some more realistic stunt work (but that's personal taste), especially because the director's previous film Creed had one of the sleekest looking fight scenes of recent years. Many of the special effects in Wakanda also felt unfinished, the look itself were breathtaking. However there were many set pieces that felt incomplete and too cartoony. The costumes and music of the film is terrific though, they really give this exotic african feel, it makes the film a lot more authentic. After the first hour passed, I really enjoyed this picture. There were some minor gripes with special effects and tone, but for the most part I had a lot of fun with it.",6,9,31,17 February 2018
Life," A fun, predictable space horror film
","Life is currently playing in cinemas. It stars Jake Gyllenhaal, Ryan Reynolds and Rebecca Ferguson who is known for Mission Impossible Rogue Nation. This film basically plays out exactly the same way as Ridley Scott's Alien. A small group of scientists discover a probe on the planet Mars. On the space station ISS the scientists analyze the creature. It is rapidly growing and starts to get violent really quick to point it out without spoiling anything. What really worked for me was the creature, it was terrifying and mysterious just like the alien and the predator. The acting too is very good, Ryan Reynolds has a lot of charisma and so does Rebecca Ferguson. They really did make me care for them, unfortunately that is the only real detail given to any character. I only cared about Reynolds and Ferguson as they had charisma, Gyllenhaal on the other hand really did let me down. He gives a good performance but his character simply isn't interesting. Unlike 'Alien' which has characters that are like actual real people. 'Life' makes it too easy by just giving the audience two dimensional characters. Some of them have charisma but most of them I fear were plain and dull. The story too is incredibly predictable, you know how everything will play out fairly quickly. This would've been okay if the characters were interesting and likable. Overall this still is a fun sci-fi horror flick with some really scary scenes and charismatic performances. But unfortunately the narrative is too predictable and the characters too uninteresting to be more than a popcorn film.",7,11,19,5 April 2017
Green Book," Funny fluffy comedy about a oppressive time in American history.
","Green Book certainly stirred up controversy when it unexpectedly won Best Picture at the 2019 Academy Awards. I personally didn't care as I lost interest in the Oscars completely (these are the people that nominated Black Panther for Best Picture). Certainly is the film in my Top 5 favorites of 2018, not really. That doesn't mean however that Green Book isn't an endearing, enjoyable and above all funny film about friendship and acceptance. The themes of this film have been highlighted around a zillion times in other films such as The Help. However that doesn't mean that the formula is broken. I for one appreciated this films humor, performances and story. A tough Italian brute (Viggo Mortensen) is looking for a new job. He is hired by an African American musician (Mahershala Ali) to drive him through the Southern States in the early 1960s for a tour. The film wisely goes for humor over melodrama which is what sets it apart from all the other films about this topic. Not that the film doesn't have dramatic moments, in fact these are all the more effective because the two main characters were so likeable and funny. Mortensen gave such a heartwarming performance. His character is a brute, he doesn't mind getting physical when someone pisses him off. But his character also expressed such an aura of warmth were the audience simply gravitated towards him. He doesn't understand the racism, he doesn't get the absolute treacherous and human rights violating laws of Jim Crow under which African Americans suffered. However the film wisely never preaches about the privileged white man not knowing the truth, it just shows it, plain and simple. Ali too gave a terrific performance, his character had a sense of sophistication and coolness even in intense situations. It is incredibly heart wrenching to see such a professional guy who lives his passion pushed to his breaking point by his societies' racist rules. Overall there is not much else to say about Green Book. The themes are obvious and the film doesn't attempt to hide it. Mortensen and Ali are terrific and share great chemistry. A heartwarming family film that allows children to have a more sanitized look into America's darkest points of history. No 12 Years A Slave but still a good time.",8,2,3,23 April 2019
