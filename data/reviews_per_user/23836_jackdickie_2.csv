Requiem for a Dream," Two words to describe this movie, 'Bloody Brilliant.'
","I admire this movie for it's style of editing and storyline, the actors are amazing, we've got actors like 'Jared leto, Jennifer Connelly, Ellen Burstyn, Marlon Wayans.' Yes Marlon Wayans is in this film but he's not trying to be funny and this film is NO Comedy, This film goes to show how messed up addiction can really be. Some may consider this film to be too slow for their liking, but personally, I enjoy this film that way. it's perfect. Everything is all fine and dandy and then... Things begin to unfold and become something well, depressing. Highly recommended, 10/10.",10,0,1,24 May 2017
A Nightmare on Elm Street," What a Nightmare!!!
","The thought of someone having the ability to invade your dreams and turn them into nightmares where he can indeed slaughter you in both dream and reality. Is terrifying! Nancy and her friends are having violent nightmares which all feature one common element, a disfigured serial killer with a glove made of razors on his right hand. When one of the group is murdered in their sleep, Nancy realizes that she must stay awake and try uncover the truth behind this fantastic killer Freddy Krueger. I Consider this film to be one of those films to watch with your friends late at night, 11Pm and onwards seems like the perfect time to watch a good horror movie like this, is it worth the watch and is it truly terrifying? YES, think about it! You close your eyes and open them to the sight of a burnt man who's intent is that of killing you!! The film isn't slow, it isn't boring nor dull, it's truly what made 80's kids & teens terrified of going to bed. 10/10.",10,0,1,26 April 2017
