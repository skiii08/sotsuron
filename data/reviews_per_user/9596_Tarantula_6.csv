Ali," The Greatest Boxing Movie Since Raging Bull & Rocky! Will Smith Is Unbelievable!
","Ali, to portray such a man would have to be one of the hardest tasks in film history and by choosing the composer/acting talents of Will Smith (Who I like, but I thought Laurence Fishburne would've been the choice to make) made me unsure! I was wrong...DEAD WRONG! Will Smith puts in the greatest performance in his career (SO FAR?!) and it shows that his really improved since WILD WILD WEST (The Legend Of Bagger Vance was good, maybe that's how his comeback started)! I still don't know about an Oscar, btu his already been nominated for best actor in a drama with a goldne globe and I hope he wins this! This will declare Will Smith as not only a top composer (UP YOURS EMINEM, I HATE YOU FOREVER...SORRY ABOUT THAT?!) but an actor as well! Though it doesn't exactly display Ali's entire life, it's graphic, well acted and probably Michael Mann's best piece of directorial work. The 2nd best film of the year, behind LORD OF THE RINGS! 9/10",10,0,0,28 December 2001
The Mummy," THE BEST VERSION OF THE MUMMY EVER!
","I went to the Bendigo pictures with my mates one day, and we were planning to see another movie (I can't exactly remember what it was) but there was no room for us! So, we decided to see THE MUMMY, another remake of the 1932 Horror Classic. This one was starring Brendan Fraser who I'd originally seen in George Of The Jungle. After the movie, I thought WOW! WHY ON EARTH DID I NOT SEE THIS MOVIE ADVERTISED SOONER! It was incredible, with it's special effects, humour and sensational storytelling. It's a must see, and the sequel's even better which stars THE ROCK as THE SCORPION! For THE MUMMY, A 9/10 & For THE MUMMY RETURNS, A 10/10! I hope THE ROCK does well in THE MUMMY 3 - THE SCORPION KING! Go Rocky!",10,0,0,12 May 2001
The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring," WITHOUT A DOUBT, POSITIVELY, ABSOLUTELY, THE GREATEST FANTASY/ADVENTURE EVER MADE & POSSIBLY THE GREATEST MOVIE OF ALL TIME EVER MADE!!
","Wonderfully acted, beautiful shot with its deeply graphic scenes (if that is a word) and truly magnificent! Some flaws, but it still doesn't prevent me from not giving it a 10... oh yeah! 10/10 P.S. The ending kind of P!SS#S YOU OFF, BUT IT'S JUST GOING BY THE BOOK! SHOULD CLEAN HOUSE AT ALL AWARDS!",10,0,1,28 December 2001
Event Horizon," UNDER-RATED!
","Leave this film alone, it's very imaginative and mind-blowing stuff! The performances are brilliant with an awesome storyline and a thrilling ride from start to finish. Sam Neil as a bad guy (SLIGHT SPOILER) is kind of weird but it's all good! I give this about an 8 out of 10!",10,0,2,2 November 2001
The Mummy Returns," AWESOME! AWESOME! AWESOME! AWESOME! AWESOME! AWESOME! AWESOME! AWESOME! AWESOME! AWESOME!
","I liked the original, but I love this! A rollercoaster ride from start to finish, and a brilliant cameo performance by the most electrifying man in sporting entertainment, the brahma bull, the great one, the people's champion and my favorite sporting entertainer; THE ROCK! Stunts galore, thrills, spills, action, adventure, deception, romance, and the list goes on. To all of those who mock this film for being pointless or anything else, SHUT THE F#CK UP BECAUSE IT'S THE BEST AND PROBABLY THE ONLY POPCORN MOVIE AROUND THAT DESERVES TO BE IN THE TOP 250! OK, so I may be going overboard there a little bit, but it's way better than any of Adam Sandler's sh!t! That'll be all about my favorite film, which deserves a supersonic 10!",10,6,9,29 September 2001
The Mummy Returns," IF ANYBODY OUT THERE UNDERRATED THIS FILM OR THINK IT'S POINTLESS OR ANYTHING ALONG THOSE LINES, THINK AGAIN!
","I came into this movie expecting something really special, after all it did cost 130 Million dollars to make, it was the sequel to another favorite movie of mine, it was a year in the making, and my all time favorite wrestling legend THE ROCK was gonna play a cameo as the new and awesome 'HEEL' THE SCORPION KING, something that was to really start The Most Electrifying Man In Sporting Entertainment's Movie Career (he is currently working on a movie entirely about his character, something that I will see as soon as possible!) It had a great opening with The Scorpion King and his unfortunate defeat in a Seven Year Long Battle, and then making a deal with a vicious Egyptian God! You watch the rest, I think I've told you enough because this a KICK-ASS movie from Start-Finish and was the most exciting movie that I'd ever seen in my entire goddamn life! Brilliant Performances by all, SIDE-SPLITTING Special Effects, Backed up by humour, sensational eye-popping beautiful landscapes and a great storyline! The action-adventure sequences are full throttle/non-stop, the intensity can really get to dangerous high-levels, the legend continues to amaze you and the final battle scene (or scenes because there are several fights going on at one time) are incredible! Even The Scorpion King's (or that vicious Egyptian God's) Army looks awesome as they engage in battle! THEY LOOKED INVINCIBLE AND BALLISTIC! This is somewhere in my top 3 movies, and I'm gonna grab it on video as soon as possible and I'll watch it again and again and again! I know that this isn't the sort of movie that would get into the top 250, but I would really like it to be. And to all those critics who think this movie is pointless, brainless, blah blah blah! Well, you're not exactly right at all because this is a blockbuster, a box-office smash, an AWESOME AWESOME AWESOME movie! 10/10 FROM ME! If there is any chance for this movie to ever get into the top 250 I would really hope that It can/does! In conclusion, THEY ARE ALL CHANTING THE ROCK'S NAME! (The Scorpion King!) ROCKY! ROCKY! ROCKY! ROCKY! ROCKY! ROCKY! ROCKY! ROCKY! ROCKY!",10,0,0,12 May 2001
