The Ring," Scared the F-ing s***e out of me!
","I saw the movie, last showing of the night..  I walked in knowing nothing about the plot only that you watch a tape and you die...  I was shocked.. horrified..  and it was amazing!  I'm the type that really enjoys horror flicks about insane asylums but even then I've never felt disturbed.  I enjoy being scared..  I enjoyed this movie.  I was hyperventilating in my seat and a true terror was evoked.I find that the plot is tightly strung and the parallelisms in everything was amazing.  Especially the foreshadowing..  This left the ending of showing how the death occurred a grave shock.  The acting was superb.. and coming from a theatre major...  amazing.  Absolutely real and urban.  I can't see these other actresses doing it.  Granted Nicole Kidman could have done the role, but the real question is, would it have been like The Others? I think she was good for that role but this role wouldn't have worked for her in the end and I think she knew that...  there is no way I could have seen Gwyneth Paltrow doing Rachel's role.Amazing.",10,0,0,27 October 2002
