The Ring," Entertaining nonsense.
","A movie about an evil VHS cassette.  Why not? -- we've clearly run out of other ideas.  But before you ladle on the praise for originality, please recall that this is a remake of a much tighter Japanese cult-shocker.*The Ring*  is equally weighted with virtues and faults.  The actual videotape in question, which will kill you exactly one week to the minute after you view it, is itself a rather clever take-off on some of the Surrealist work of Bunuel and Dali from the Twenties  (but without Bunuel's REALLY horrible imagery, like eyeballs getting slit with knives).  An advance here is that the imagery on the tape comes alive, right through the TV:  a filmed housefly can actually be plucked off the screen, as the days ominously pass and the curse gathers strength.  Needless to say, the housefly is merely foreshadowing for much nastier  'interactive'  horrors to come.The plot is full of holes or is otherwise incomprehensible.  The movie never considers, for instance, that a person could simply be in a place where there are no televisions when his or her week is up:  without the medium of television, the ghost isn't able to manifest itself in order to kill him/her.  Or perhaps you simply die, whether you're near a TV or not.  Who knows?  There are other absurdities, but to give them out would be spoiling things.  (For those in the know, I'm referring to the efficacy of making copies.)It's not that I require water-tight plots for my horror films -- or indeed, for any films.  But it's to be assumed that a movie without a strong plot will have many other virtues to compensate.  *The Ring*  mostly fails here, as well:  Verbinski's idea of setting a mood consists of covering the camera lenses with icy-blue filters; the cast, with the sole exception of Naomi Watts, is low-wattage and includes a Haley Joel Osment copycatter  (at one point, the kid in this movie even wears an undertaker's dark suit); and the suspense is disappointingly light, except for the splendid beginning when we aren't sure what to expect.But having said all this, *The Ring*  also avoids being completely ridiculous.  The main characters, who operate and investigate under a cloud of certain impending death, seem caught up in a psychological anguish which is unusual in a genre where sudden scares are the norm.  Self-sacrifice in a horror flick hasn't been seen since the finale of  *The Exorcist*, thirty years ago.  All in all, *The Ring*  gamely continues the mini-Renaissance of decent scary movies that began with  *The Sixth Sense*.  Worth watching -- 5 / 10.",5,2,5,1 February 2004
Spartacus," Surprisingly excellent.
","Surprisingly, because  *Spartacus*  belongs to that awful genre of the sword-and-sandal epic.  (Lately -- and woefully -- revived by that excruciating  *Gladiator*.)  Surprisingly, because the film was born of many fathers  (Dalton Trumbo as screenwriter, Anthony Mann as original director, Stanley Kubrick as replacement about half-way through the production, and Kirk Douglas basically making all of the creative decisions).  In other words, *Spartacus*  should have been an expensive mess.But, while imperfect, it's a generally glorious epic, the  'thinking man's epic'  so many strived for during the Fifties and Sixties.  Most of those attempts failed miserably, but this one worked out.  Who really knows why. Perhaps it's because this story takes place in Republican Rome, so there are none of those wet-blanket, moon-faced Christians lurking about yet.  Or maybe it's because the movie avoids being a tensionless biopic, and instead focuses on the slave rebellion -- which is clearly enough material for a 3+ hour movie, anyway.  Perhaps it's the performances, all of them very good, with Peter Ustinov managing to outdo everybody as a nouveau riche dean of a gladiatorial school.  In fact, the movie could've used more of Ustinov:  the character is such a true-to-life conception that the actor manages to make mincemeat out of Laurence Olivier's bad guy, and even puts Charles Laughton's pompous Senator in the shade  (no easy feat, that).  Perhaps it's even that infamous scene between Olivier and Tony Curtis.  I still aver that watching Tony Curtis bathe and oil a naked Olivier remains one of the most outrageous things you'll ever see in cinema.  And that's followed by Olivier demanding of Curtis that the latter should  'love Rome as a mother.  You must serve her!'  ('Rome'  being Olivier's Crassus, of course.)  Perhaps the greatest scene in the movie is the impromptu gladiatorial match between Douglas'  Spartacus and another gladiator played by the ultra-dignified African-American actor Woody Strode.  Exciting in and of itself, the scene then becomes poignant social commentary, as Strode hurls his trident at his oppressors up in their luxury box -- food for thought for an audience in the midst of the Civil Rights struggle.  And it should be mentioned that the love story between Douglas and Jean Simmons as the slave girl from Britannia is performed with unusual sensitivity, backed up by a lovely score.The  'Kubrick touch'  in all of this is rather hard to discern, except perhaps in the Olivier/Curtis scene and in certain points of visual composition.  Kubrick's ready-steady, static camera style gets the most out of the grand, climactic battle near the end of the picture.  But Kubrick-worshipers would do well to remember that about half of this movie belongs to Anthony Mann, and in any case, ALL of it belongs to Kirk Douglas. A purely Kubrick film would doubtless have been worse.  On the other hand, I also suspect that the marvelously downbeat finale would not have existed without the dour Kubrick's insistence.  *Spartacus*  is probably the only sword-and-sandal epic without the mushy Christian uplift, the  'spiritual happy ending', despite the overt Christian symbolism in the final shots. Kubrick's meanness proves to be a bracing tonic in this otherwise sappy genre.",7,2,6,23 November 2003
Finding Neverland," The movie that never grew up.
","*Finding Neverland*, though competently done, is a pretty much dishonest movie through and through, in terms of the historical situation of its story (for instance, Sylvia Llewelyn-Davies was NOT a widow in 1903-04 when *Peter Pan* was produced, but was married to a fellow who naturally found Barrie's intrusion into the life of his family deeply offensive and disturbing) and, even worse, in terms of Barrie's creative processes. This movie (based on a recent London stage play called *The Man Who Was Peter Pan* by someone-or-other) would have us believe that J.M. Barrie -- an otherwise 'normal', relatively successful playwright -- finally was able to encapsulate, in his writing, the virtues of childhood after bumping into Sylvia and her family at Kensington Park. And thus, Barrie rediscovers those childhood virtues for an increasingly cynical modern world.This makes for an uncontroversial, user-friendly, Oscar-nominated sort of movie, but it's really little better than rubbish. It's one thing to take liberties with real characters and events in order to forge a coherent narrative, but *Finding Neverland* reinvents Barrie and his milieu out of whole cloth. What's the point of that? It certainly renders much of the film's action incomprehensible: Barrie's producer (Dustin Hoffman), for instance, is depicted here as deeply doubtful about the prospects for *Peter Pan*, and yet he agrees to stage it anyway. In the movie's universe, why would he? -- it doesn't make any sense. It becomes more clear when we recall the childhood-fetishism that was rampant in Edwardian England at the time (Robert Louis Stevenson's tales for young readers, and the work of Beatrix Potter, spring immediately to mind). Of COURSE a producer would be attracted to something like *Peter Pan* in 1904. But this movie presents Barrie as an iconoclast who wins converts.As for Barrie's personal life, the movie makes it equally senseless. There's no clear reason why the writer (personified by the very handsome Johnny Depp) wouldn't make any obviously natural overtures to widow Sylvia (a gorgeous Kate Winslet). Of course, he'd be cheating on his own wife, but the movie isn't quite prepared to make Barrie a saint or a monk. (He IS married in the movie, after all.) In real life, Barrie was something of an actress-chaser who, ironically, may have been sexually impotent -- if one may believe his fiction, and one should, for that is where writers really tell their autobiographies. *Finding Neverland* elides all of this, with the result that his relationship with Sylvia doesn't pass the credibility test. Compounding the problem is that the movie doesn't dare confront just how hung-up Barrie was over the death of his brother David, or the resulting Oedipus complex that followed with regard to his mother. We get a quick speech tossed off by Depp -- 'My brother died; my mother never got over it; I dressed in his clothes one night to make her happy' (paraphrasing, of course) -- that does not begin to explain Barrie's obsession with the Llewelyn-Davies kids and with kid-hood in general. I normally agree with the notion that 'psychologizing' famous people, artists especially, is a cheap trick that simplifies more than it explains; but here's a case in which the author's own writings give us troubling clues with which the movie avoids dealing. *Finding Neverland* doesn't even consider that the idea of a Boy Who Never Grows Up could be a disturbing one. Sadness and loss are treated here as the dismal adjuncts of growing up . . . when they SHOULD have been the dismal adjuncts of a man's refusal to grow up. I just don't understand why praise has been heaped onto this movie. Perhaps in 2005, Americans feel so dispirited that an infantilizing entertainment such as this seems irresistible. We should resist it, though: among other things, adulthood can be defined as the state in which a person is capable of dealing with life's problems. We cannot afford to be babied in these times, even within the context of pop culture.3 stars out of 10.",3,3,12,26 February 2005
Two for the Money," Don't bet on it.
","Another entry in the Pacino-As-Mentor sub-genre. You know the drill: young hotshot with hubristic flaw (in this case, Matthew McConaughey, trying to jump-start a flagging career by latching onto Pacino's coattails -- hey, it worked for Keanu and Colin, didn't it?) is discovered by glamorous and delightfully corrupt father figure (Pacino, natch). Young Hotshot learns from Father Figure all the ins-and-outs of a lucrative yet degrading career (this time, it's football handicapping). Father Figure plies Young Hotshot with money and hookers and power, but we all know that this decadent state of affairs is on a collision course with dissolution and despair . . . that is, until the Young Hotshot finds his moral center by rejecting the Father Figure and all, or almost all, that he stands for. (Clearly, Stone's *Wall Street* pretty much set the ground rules for the Pacino-As-Mentor sub-genre.)We are also meant to take these latter-day Pacino films as a parallel to reality. Again, you know the drill: Living-Legend Actor demonstrates his unquestioned superiority as compared to an Inferior Young Actor. The latter may bear and grin through the process, but he must recognize that he isn't going to get any of the good lines, much less get a chance to chew major scenery before the denouement. Now it must be said that there are actually two good movies in the Pacino-As-Mentor canon: *Scent of a Woman* and *Donnie Brasco*. In the former case, it was a one-man show, anyway; in the latter case, Pacino had met his match as a scene-stealer in the person of Johnny Depp. However, those two movies were serious-minded, not merely an exercise in showboating for showboating's sake. Pacino has made damn certain that his younger co-stars in the films since *Brasco* are nowhere near as charismatic as Depp. By the way, none of this speaks very well about the Living-Legend Actor. Like his contemporary De Niro, Pacino has spent the last 10 or 15 years resting on his laurels. *Two for the Money* is the worst example yet, worse even than *Devil's Advocate*, which at least had the virtues of featuring a naked Connie Nielsen and being chronologically prior to this movie. Well, this is what happens when you're crowned King too damn early -- just ask Marlon Brando. Frankly, I've seen one too many Al Pacino films with the same plot -- and the same overacting from the star -- to be charitable any longer. Did I say 'none of this speaks well'? Actually, it's humiliating for everyone involved, including the paying audience. No one's going to accuse Matthew McConaughey of being a Shakespearean actor, but even he doesn't deserve the role of second-fiddle to this intolerable old show-off, with the added implication that he, McConaughey, will never measure up to the Greatness That Is Al.I've not wasted space on the plot particulars. If you want a synopsis, IMDb provides a no-nonsense summary, though I think I laid out a fairly comprehensive summary in my opening paragraph. Basically, you've seen this movie before. Many times. The particular milieu in *Two for the Money* is the seedy world (underworld, really) of sports handicapping. Pacino runs an office of 'bet advisers' -- that is, middlemen between you and your bookie -- and even has a cable TV handicapping show, co-hosted with several of his top guys. One thing the movie got right was the sleaziness of these type of shows . . . but one detail they got dead wrong was the constant use of the words 'gamble' and 'gambling'. If you've ever seen ProLine or other shows of similar ilk, you'll NEVER, NEVER hear Jim Feist and his cohorts say the word 'gamble'. They ask you to call their 1-900 number to get their picks . . . but if you were from, say, Mars, you'd have no idea what you were supposed to do with those picks. 'Gamble' is the F-word on sports-handicapping TV shows -- strictly verboten.Gambling is against the law, you know.1 star out of 10.",1,6,12,12 October 2005
Spider-Man 2," The superhero as existentialist.
","*Spider-Man 2* is clearly an improvement on the first feature in every significant way, from the script to the F/X (though Spidey still looks like a cartoon when he swings from skyscraper to skyscraper). I watched with increasing amusement as director Sam Raimi and his commission of hacks (including the likes of Alvin Sargent and prize-winning novelist and comic-enthusiast Michael Chabon) irresistibly turn Peter Parker into a comic-book Hamlet, replete with metaphysical conversations with beloved dead relatives and existential soliloquies. It can be argued that *Spider-Man 2* is the perfect movie for our times, a stripped-down and workmanlike rehash of the old, artsy-fartsy cosmic themes that have engaged writers since Aeschylus, custom-made for a generation made pathologically jittery from too much TV and too many colors and lights from noisy Hollywood blockbusters.But let's not get carried away, shall we? The movie isn't a masterpiece, or anything. And not because of its comic-book -- that is, fantastical -- origin. The subject-matter here is no more foolish or 'unrealistic' than, well, the plays of Shakespeare, with their ghosts and witches and fairy-queens and the like. The difference, of course, is that Shakespeare (and the other great writers who dabbled in fantasy) added magnificent poetry to their nonsensical plots; Raimi & Co., on the other hand, dumb things down by necessity. The Medium Is The Message, as McLuhan pointed out, and the Medium here is the Summer Blockbuster -- no big words allowed. And that's fine; not every movie should be High Art. But even genre pictures can attain masterpiece-status by rigorous crafting: *Spider-Man 2* is a little too bloated and excessive (over 2 hours of running time) to pass the discipline test. Also, the dialog, while required to be simple, does not have to be simplistic, as well: most of this movie's wit, as in the case of the first *Spider-Man*, resides in the personage of J. Jonah Jameson, played by J.K. Simmons (having a ball by stealing yet another movie). Thus, while the movie's themes are worked out rather magnificently, the tools that build the edifice are just too dull to get us really excited.Stepping away from theoretical flights, let it be said that Doc Ock is probably the biggest reason why the sequel is better than the original. This new villain's exuberant monstrousness -- four gigantic mechanical limbs grafted onto his back, giving the man a total of eight limbs (hence 'Dr. Octavius') -- is more in line with the source material's conception of Atomic Age bad guys. That is to say, he's a perfectly modern mutant in the tradition of not just comic-books in general but the various monster-movies of the Fifties and Sixties when the *Spider-Man* comic was created. He's a villain truly in spirit with the material, unlike the Green Goblin from the first movie, with his ridiculous airborne surf- or skateboard that smacked of a bad Mountain Dew commercial. And Alfred Molina takes what little characterization that the script gives him and makes the most of it.As for the other actors: Tobey Maguire, by sheer force of his talent, makes Peter Parker a great role. He intuitively grasps what the character is struggling with, which is, of course, the transition from adolescence to adulthood. The 'Spider-Man' persona, from his comic-book origins, was always just a web-slinging metaphor for Growing Up; and while the pedestrian dialog denies Maguire any real exposition on this theme (no poetic flights in iambic pentameter, natch), no actor of his generation has proved to be better at manifesting inferiority. He does it all with his eyes and inflection. Besides Maguire and Molina, the rest of the cast are not served well by the script, but even so, I felt that they were inadequate, especially James Franco as the son of Spidey's former nemesis Green Goblin (and, rather doubtfully, Parker's best friend).All in all, 5 stars out of 10. I have to commend Raimi on his bravery: he's making a franchise that he wants to make. I hope the suits continue to let him have his way, which, if untrammeled, will finally produce a masterpiece that will flop at the box-office. Raimi's auteurist ambitions have been clearly manifested by the loftier goals of *Spider-Man 2* . . . as well as by the ever-so-slightly disappointing box-office returns in comparison to the first outing. In other words, the ground-lings may be catching onto his act, and are starting to get suspicious. Good.",5,1,3,18 January 2005
Alexander," With apologies to Brad Pitt.
","My Summary refers to my rather unkind comments about Mr. Pitt in reference to the Other Greek Epic That Came Out This Year, *Troy*. Not only was *Troy* significantly better than *Alexander*, but Brad Pitt suddenly seems credible as Achilles when compared to Colin Farrell as the Macedonian empire-builder. And in the Old-Codger-From-The-U.K. category, Peter O'Toole at least brought moments of humanity to *Troy* . . . Anthony Hopkins as Ptolemy of Egypt (one of Alexander's generals), on the other hand, is stuck with doddering around a bad set with a matte behind it, and otherwise narrating events that might've proved worthy of an actual presentation by the director.But Oliver Stone is not interested in narrative; he seems to be making some sort of half-baked critique about George W. Bush via historical allegory. He fails. If I want critiques of Bush, I'll turn to Michael Moore. If Oliver Stone really wanted to tell a story about an idealistic idiot who thought he could re-fashion the Orient in his own Hellenized (i.e., Western) image, why not simply offer up Yet Another Documentary About Bush?This would've at least served a practical purpose. Instead, Stone holds his nose and tries to sneak his allegory in under the lead weight of the Hollywood Blockbuster, an institution that simply will not brook iconoclasts who don't know how to be subtle.Setting aside the folly of Stone's aims in *Alexander*, the movie itself is poorly made to a really shocking degree (or perhaps NOT so shocking a degree, when one recalls *Natural Born Killers*, *U-Turn*, and other choice bits from Stone's oeuvre). Stone has apparently forgotten how to stage even the simplest scene: the actors are poorly blocked; there's far too much cutting back and forth between close-ups, resulting in spatial confusion (meaning, we get no realistic sense of setting during an individual scene). The narrative arc is out-of-whack: two-thirds of the way through, we suddenly flashback eight years earlier, apropos of nothing. (I've heard arguments defending this particular misstep, but they're unconvincing.) The voice-over narration is, of course, a dead giveaway of storytelling desperation. And the acting! Poor Oliver Stone, forced to deal with the likes of Colin Farrell and Angelina Jolie. Because I always feel a little shameful when speaking poorly of actors -- whose trade is a difficult one -- I'll keep my remarks about their efforts focused strictly on their accents. Farrell sounds like a Belfast tough; Jolie sounds like Anna Magnani with a hangover.Excitable heteros, *Matrix*-nerds, and other assorted teenage males seeking action in *Alexander* will be positively freaked out by all the chit-chat and Big Speeches, to say nothing of the overt bisexual swing to the movie. (Where's dour, safely sexless Russell Crowe when you need him?) But even the latter element, which presumably should've stoked this 'controversial' director's interest, is hilariously G-rated. I would be amused to hear a gay reviewer's opinion of all the scenes involving Colin Farrell and Jared Leto (as Alexander's lover Hephaestion) hugging each other and staring dreamily into each other's eyes while they talk about Democracy, Freedom, and whatnot. This movie will furnish capital for gay satire for years to come, I suspect. Alexander the Fabulous! And his Boyfriend! Stone wasn't exactly Keeping it Real, here.Those seeking intelligence, rather than the typical pumped-up action of a Hollywood historical epic, will also be disappointed. All the Big Speeches I referred to earlier aren't really about anything. Stone confuses volume with content: most of the dialog involves Angelina Jolie taunting her son into becoming king. ('Yes, Mother,' replies Norman Bates.) And once he IS King, she sends him taunting letters filled with Jewish-Mother advice. The Oedipal stuff is routine and not in the least disturbing, though perhaps this is because Ms. Jolie is only about one year older than Mr. Farrell in real life. As for Alexander's military campaigns, Stone is interested only in the Iraq (i.e., Babylon) portions of them -- that way, you see, he can make his stupid political point. And I suspect that the India campaign is in here only because Bollywood is trendy at the moment.I've gone on long enough about this crap. 1 star of 10, obviously. Only God knows what Baz Luhrmann has in store for us with HIS treatment of Alexander the Great: *Alexander: Dance! Dance! Dance!*, or something.",1,2,5,2 December 2004
Troy," Hector vs. Fabio.
","The good news is, *Troy*  isn't as bad as the trailers would lead you to believe.  It is certainly better than Ridley Scott's  *Gladiator* . . . but this is not saying a great deal, as the latter was terrible.  Director Wolfgang Petersen deserves praise, first and foremost, for knowing how to film a fight scene.  The one-on-one fights, between first Paris/Menelaus, then Achilles/Hector, are thrilling and realistic, but more importantly, FILMED SO THAT WE CAN ACTUALLY SEE WHAT'S GOING ON.  Petersen eschews the lazy new mode of fight scenes, which is to quick-edit them out of all comprehension.  His camera floats around the battles, giving us a nonpartisan and omniscient view.  Much the same can be said for the larger battle sequences as well, even though the overuse of computer-generated armies deducts credibility.  (We're told that Agamemnon's army is 50,000 strong, but what we see are millions upon millions of computer-generated cartoon-men.)A few ideas even manage to sneak into  *Troy*, along with the fabled wooden horse.  I liked the contrast between the older, far more civilized, Trojan culture, with its reliance on omens and religion, and the more grounded, realistic, Machiavellian political culture of the invading Greeks.  Petersen even gives Brian Cox's Agamemnon a decent speech about how proud he is of turning a ragtag assemblage of superstitious barbarians and  'snake-eaters' into a modern, imperialist nation.  Understanding the difference between the two cultures is crucial for engendering an interest in how things turn out.But therein lies the problem, because anybody who attended high school already knows how things turn out, and therefore a $200 million epic that puts its trust in plot to the general exclusion of other interests is bound to be ultimately forgettable.  It's not the STORY that's important  (and I don't even care about the screenwriters'  wild liberties with the Troy legend, as it's legend anyhow and not history), it's the SETTING, and the IDEAS, that count.  However, this movie simply cannot afford to immerse us in the pre-historical world of Agamemnon and Priam:  there's too much money at stake.  And so they'll have a big weekend, make their money back, maybe win a technical Oscar next April, but no one will remember the actual film. Big accomplishment!  Why bother?And there are other problems.  Let's start, first of all, with the score, which has got to be one of the worst I've ever heard in a major motion picture.  Written by James Horner, it consists of a woman moaning atonally for minutes at a time.  'Ahh-yah-ahhh Yaaa hhaaa'.  It keeps cropping up whenever there's a battle about to take place or whenever some hero lies bloody in the sand.  It makes you want to tear your hair out and poke knitting needles in your ears.  Second, let's consider Brad Pitt.  God bless him, but the fellow has a speech impediment, and that never really works when you're playing one of the globe's most legendary heroes.  It's an unkind thing to say, but there it is.  Further, he looks like a cross between an aging California surfer and Fabio:  his physical presence carries zero credibility.  (How many BLONDE Greeks do you know?)  Third, Achilles is given a love interest in the form of a young Trojan priestess Briseis:  this is a mistake, because the actress playing her is prettier than the actress playing Helen.  A story about the Troy legend should always to defer to Helen as the sublime example of feminine beauty.  But then, I guess the writers couldn't figure out a way to get Achilles romantically involved with Helen, so they had to trump up something.  This flatters the movie's Big Star, but it hurts the movie.Pitt's miscasting is countered by an otherwise excellent cast  (Eric Bana and Orlando Bloom as Hector and Paris are particularly strong), but there's not enough good stuff here to warrant a recommendation.  4 stars out of 10.",3,23,47,22 May 2004
Brokeback Mountain," Gus and Call, 100 years later.
","I found this movie to be over-hyped, but I'm nonetheless glad that it was made, as it is truly a landmark film that NEEDED to be made for the mainstream American audience. The movies have been demonstrably successful at raising social consciousness on a variety of issues, and consciousness-raising is clearly called for on the subject of homosexuality in the United States in 2006. *Brokeback Mountain* is a landmark film because it is, as far as I can tell, the first mainstream Hollywood gay romance, starring two hot new A-list stars -- Heath Ledger and Jake Gyllenhaal -- who happen to be heterosexuals. (As I said in another of my reviews, advances in civilization are always more recent than we think. This one's happening right now.) All this is fine and dandy, but, as with almost all 'landmark' films, *Brokeback Mountain* announces itself as a future historical artifact (today, who watches *Guess Who's Coming to Dinner?* out of anything more than historical curiosity?), is weighed down by its own self-importance, and finally cannot avoid preaching at us. The solemnity here gets tedious very quickly. Whenever one of the characters makes a wisecrack, the audience laughs gratefully, being hungry for some amelioration for the self-seriousness that hangs over the movie like a dark cloud. Love can be tragic, of course, but even Shakespeare provided 'Romeo and Juliet' with plenty of comic relief.The movie is NOT about 'gay cowboys'; these guys actually begin as gay shepherds. Screenwriter Larry McMurtry, writer of 'Lonesome Dove' (among other Westerns of both 19th- and 20th century vintage), knows that the presence of sheep in a Western setting is always an elegiac sign of encroaching civilization. In other words, sheep means that the old macho ways are dying out. I've not read the Annie Proulx novella on which the movie is based, and therefore can't judge her understanding of this milieu, but McMurtry certainly hammers home the deliberately non-tough symbolism: the boys herd untold thousands of sheep during the first portion of the movie. I suppose this is fitting, but like everything else about the movie, it's also heavy-handed. The story is set largely in Wyoming during the Sixties and Seventies: Proulx, who wrote the story before the grisly murder of Matthew Shepherd (that word again!), was certainly on to something with her subject. But McMurtry feels that he must include a couple of scenes of homophobic violence, in case we missed the point.Meanwhile, McMurtry has trouble constructing a decent narrative out of such episodic material. The first portion sort of meanders, much like the sheep, until the boys finally get on with it . . . and then, the movie can only sort of hop around the next two decades, quite often dwelling on matters of ancillary interest. Do we really need to see Ennis beat up a couple of bikers who are behaving like skunks at the local 4th of July picnic? (Is this supposed to prove he's really not 'queer'?) Or watch Jack sell tractors down in Texas? I suppose the filmmakers are trying to provide a wider context to the love affair, but they spend far too much time doing it. For a love story that implicitly trumpets its own boldness, Ennis and Jack spend remarkably little time on screen together after their first job. We catch glimpses of them trysting at their Brokeback Mountain hideaway, gradually getting grayer and paunchier and generally less sexual. I was oddly, or perhaps not so oddly, reminded of *Same Time, Next Year*, just without the fairly interesting conversations between Alda and Burstyn.I was also reminded of McMurtry's own 'Lonesome Dove', of which this film seems little more than a rewrite tailor-made for one of the pressing issues of the moment. Gyllenhaal is Jack/Gus, and Ledger is Ennis/Call. Amazingly, the corresponding character to McMurtry's Western novel dies as well, and, yes, wants to be buried in the place where he found the most happiness in life, which leaves the other character to mull over how he can fulfill his friend's final wish. Oh well, I suppose it IS clever that McMurtry rewrote his most famous characters -- macho as you could please -- as 20th century homosexuals.All that director Ang Lee can do with this formless, yet grievously 'important', material, is film it beautifully, which he majestically does, taking full advantage of the natural beauty of southern Alberta (standing in for Wyoming). I was grateful for that, and for the uniformly excellent performances from the four principals (Ledger and Gyllenhaal, along with Michelle Williams and Anne Hathaway as the long-suffering wives). But as much as I enjoyed the notion of the movies' first gay love affair for mainstream audiences being set in Wyoming -- Dick Cheney's home state -- I found *Brokeback Mountain* itself to be poorly executed.3 stars out of 10 for cinephiles of EITHER sexual persuasion; more stars for whom this sort of thing is a revelation.

Crash," *Magnolia* without the frogs.
","*Crash*, by Paul Haggis, is one of those slice-of-life, twelve-characters-in-search-of-a-connection sort of thing, and, as is usually this case with these type of movies, is rather poorly done. The movie has many antecedents, but the most obvious has to be P.T. Anderson's *Magnolia*. Both movies share an unearned sense of doom, a gloomy tone, overwrought histrionics, and even apocalyptic stuff falling from the sky in Los Angeles (I won't spoil it, but at least there are no frogs in *Crash*).While *Magnolia* -- itself cribbed from Altman's *Short Cuts* -- tried to sustain its multi-level storyline with a theme about the interconnectedness of humanity even within the spacious confines of suburban L.A., *Crash* takes as its impetus the daily round of racial antipathy seething under the Superpower sheen of American life. Obviously, the latter is a more vital and inherently interesting topic, which makes *Crash* a more inherently interesting movie, probably (but then, what ISN'T better than *Magnolia*?). The movie certainly gets interesting whenever it deigns to follow either Don Cheadle or Matt Dillon (and we are grateful Dillon has been given a decent role -- it's been a while) within its 24-hour time-frame. Tellingly, both Cheadle and Dillon are in law enforcement: the former being a world-weary detective, the latter being a world-weary, racist beat cop. Which leads one to the conclusion that Haggis should have focused his film on how law enforcement contributes to the racial animosity in this country. The side-story, for instance, about the Iranian shopkeeper is merely post-Iraq-War political posturing (count on it, someone accuses him of waging jihad early in the film when he's buying a pistol at a gun store). Rapper Ludicrous, of all people, inveighing against hip-hop dumbing down African-American culture is the worst sort of didactic pontificating, especially when one considers that these slyly racist remarks are put in his mouth by white filmmakers. (Haggis is a lily-white Canadian.) And then there's Sandra Bullock, a spoiled and pampered wife of the D.A., who must endure getting her car jacked by the aforementioned Ludicrous and getting her locks changed by a Mexican guy with a tattoo. Even worse, her Latina housekeeper leaves the dishes in the dishwasher instead of putting them in the cupboards after they're washed. Just how much listening to Bullock complain about housekeepers will contribute to the audience's internal debate about race relations is anybody's guess.Ironically, *Crash* gets good whenever the racial issues are rendered secondary by good old-fashioned cinematic values. There are at least two terrifically exciting scenes in the movie: the first involves Dillon rescuing Thandie Newton in an overturned car; the second involves bleeding-heart cop Ryan Phillipe (Dillon's former partner) moderating a standoff between Newton's husband and a group of pistol-brandishing LAPD. These scenes are well-staged and intense . . . but then one recalls the massive amount of coincidences that require two cops -- former partners who had a nasty encounter with this same couple the night before -- to come to the rescue of these individuals in different parts of what is one of the largest cities in the world. I suppose one can blame this on the movie's unfortunate structure, but very little about *Crash* is particularly likely, anyway. In a culture that has relegated talk of race to the psychopathic margins, all the frank discussion going on here is grievously unrealistic. One of Cheadle's white superiors -- one of the movie's 'good guys', presumably -- even mutters 'Black people!' under his breath in Cheadle's presence. Uh, fat chance, Haggis. A true movie about race relations in 2005 in the USA would, of course, never mention the color of someone's skin. But wherever shameless didacticism goes, praise from the tasteless must follow, I guess.3 stars out of 10. P.S.: It's sadly fitting, given the movie under review, that IMDb's spell-checker is changing 'Ludacris' to 'Ludicrous'. Draw your own conclusions!",3,15,32,22 May 2005
Closer," Old, familiar ground.
","Mike Nichols clearly felt that it was time to remind people that relationships between men and women are still sadistic affairs. Based on a stage play, his new film *Closer* goes back to the halcyon days of the director's own *Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf?* and especially *Carnal Knowledge*. The results are not quite as bracing, though credit must be given to any director who dares to ATTEMPT to discuss sexual relationships with honesty. Watching *Closer* reveals just how much Hollywood has babied us recently, with one schoolgirl's romantic fantasy following upon another. Indeed, at the showing I attended, three ladies in front of me got up and left during the scene early on when Jude Law (posing as a girl) and Clive Owen engage in dirty chat on the Internet. 'Definitely NOT what I expected,' one of the women murmured as they rose to leave. Those expecting a chick-flick are well warned to save your important dollars.However, let me also warn away cineastes expecting challenging cinema. *Closer* treads upon well-worn paths, paths not merely blazed by this director. Bottom line? If you're familiar with the two Nichols films mentioned above, *L'Avventura* and *La Notte* by Antonioni, *La Dolce Vita* by Fellini, *Hiroshima, Mon Amour* by Resnais, and even *Eyes Wide Shut* by Kubrick, and on and on and on, *Closer* will be something of a chore to sit through. It's the curse of being an experienced movie-watcher:one's patience wears thinner and thinner when presented with familiar material, no matter how potentially explosive that material might be.The movie is a negative chamber-drama that shows us the basic incompatibility of men and women. Two British men in London meet two American women -- basically by accident -- and fall in love with them. Utilizing a curious (and pretty successful) narrative structure that skips over lengthy gaps of time in order to jump to the next crisis, Nichols orchestrates a series of infidelities, recriminations, soul-baring monologues reminiscent of Mamet, and escalating power-plays in a game of sexual one-upsmanship. Jude Law abandons Natalie Portman for Julia Roberts, who is married to Clive Owen, who in turn goes after Natalie Portman, who . . . you get the idea. In order to avoid making all of this seem like a commedia dell'arte farce, Nichols makes sure that all of the potty-mouth dialog from the play remains intact in the movie. What makes it High Drama, presumably, is that they tend to either shout or weep when declaiming their urbane obscenities.All in all, I believe that Nichols isn't 're-making' his older films so much as he's responding to Stanley Kubrick's final film. In *Eyes Wide Shut*, Kubrick thought he could blow the lid off sex for a mainstream audience by presenting it with two Hollywood Superstars and showing the actual sex in a baroque, explicit manner -- but his dialog was its usual clinical, Kubrickian self: dry as dust. Nichols, with the same goal in mind, tries to achieve it in the direct reverse of Kubrick: not a single sex scene, but with oodles and oodles of graphic sex chat. The result is much the same: mannered and pretentious. Maybe this is because the Sexual Revolution happened 40 years ago, and the purveyors of this sort of material need to be of the New Generation: artists like Neil LaBute and Todd Solondz, artists who do not remember the old sexual repression and thus have a more modern, relevant take on today's sexual mores.Nichols' direction is unobtrusive, as expected, which allows us to focus on the characters . . . but even so, the script is overly dependent on the individual actors to carry a sense of identity across. The two successful ones in this regard are clearly Clive Owen and Julia Roberts, perhaps because they're a bit older, a bit less pretty, and a bit world-wearier. Owen, who appears to have actually originated Jude Law's character on the London stage, tears into the part of Larry like a wolf going after a raw cutlet. Owen strides across the screen in a fury, revealing a nastiness that was not evident to us before. His Larry, with his addiction to pornography, whores, and strip clubs, is an angry misogynist and incipient rapist straight out of the LaBute pantheon. This guy could be the love-child of Jack Nicholson from *Carnal Knowledge*. The biggest SURPRISE would have to be Julia Roberts' portrayal of Anna, the woman whom Larry eventually marries. Nichols absolutely reins in Roberts -- she doesn't flash that megawatt smile even once. It's a depressed, shrinking, cringing role that requires the world's most famous actress to totally sublimate her considerable ego. Roberts pulls it off. Perhaps the fact that she's pushing 40 -- no longer the 'pretty woman' -- helped in this regard. As for Law and Portman: Law doesn't quite break through as Dan, though I regard this as the fault of the character as written. Law can be brilliant, but he needs a strongly written role (for instance, he made a curiously stronger impact in *I Heart Huckabees* -- a mediocre movie, but Law's role was a cinch). Portman is in over her ahead amongst all the adults, and it certainly doesn't help that her character is that most laughable of clichÃ©s currently favored by recent male writers: the Sensitive Stripper.*Closer* gets 3 stars out of 10 for the initiated; perhaps up to 5 for the novices.",3,5,10,5 December 2004
Capote," The Truman show.
","Philip Seymour Hoffman, who we first noticed in *Scent of a Woman* some 13 years ago when he turned a fairly clichéd character into a memorable character study, finds his apotheosis -- some would say his inevitable apotheosis -- as Truman Capote in Bennett Miller's *Capote*. The writer died in 1984, and furthermore had spent the last 15 or so years of his life in relative seclusion, if you disregard his addled presence at Studio 54 and the occasional 'Tonight Show' appearance. Therefore, to someone like myself, reared in the Seventies and Eighties and carrying no burning memories of the fellow, the exactitude of Hoffman's mimicry of Capote is neither here nor there. This is, above and beyond any caviling about how precise Hoffman's impersonation is of Capote, a full-bodied, well-rounded character, whose primary interest in serving the film is to make us consider the wages of art.Older members of the audience, by which I mean those who remember the Sixties, may be forgiven a degree of burn-out: after all, there was Capote's book 'In Cold Blood', the movie on which it was based, and the writer's own self-referential celebrity. Been there and done that? Not quite: this time, we view the story ABOUT the story from the writer's perspective. It is a credit to Gerald Clarke, who wrote the book on which the film is based, Dan Futterman, who wrote the screenplay, and director Miller that this well-worn material becomes urgent and interesting again. On a wider social level, *Capote* makes a damning statement about our current fascination with 'true crime' stories, which had been reinforced by Norman Mailer's 'Executioner's Song' in the Seventies and has finally become noxiously regnant with cable TV's endless hours of coverage of the Peterson case and others like it. I'm not suggesting that people were not interested in this tawdry material before Capote, but the movie implicitly blames him for the shameless modern-day intertwining of writers (or TV reporters) with the crimes and criminals that they're covering. The movie also has something to say about how self-centered writers can be: Capote can only say 'What's the fuss all about?' in reference to friend and fellow novelist Harper Lee's success with 'To Kill a Mockingbird'. After watching Smith and Hickock get hung for their crimes, Capote whines, 'I'll never get over it' -- to which Lee (played by the great Catherine Keener) replies with deadpan malice, 'You're still ALIVE, Truman.' Amen! However, Capote's self-pity also contains the mere truth. *Capote* is the tragedy of a man who scrapped his own decency in order to write one of the great American novels of the 20th century. We observe the incremental milestones along the path toward greatness and damnation: Capote ingratiating himself with the Kansas locals; befriending the more sensitive and intelligent of the two murderers, Perry Smith; helping to arrange appeals for the murderers so that they'll stay alive long enough for him to collect enough information to finish his novel; smoothly lying to Smith about what he's actually writing about the case, even down to the book's title; and finally living with the consequences of his exploitative behavior. Art is achieved with devastating cost to the artist. Of course, this theme isn't exactly new, but Philip Seymour Hoffman makes it visceral with a performance containing a kaleidoscope of human behavior: cocky and in his element with his high-brow drinking pals in New York; smooth and charming as the 'funny fag' stereotype (modeled on characters in the Thirties' films of Ernst Lubitsch and others) in Sheriff Dewey's home; gentle and nurturing to, and even spoon-feeding, Perry Smith during the latter's attempt at suicide-by-starvation in prison; abruptly turning the tables on Smith when Smith continues to remain close-mouthed about the night of the murders. This latter scene, in which Capote lashes out at his subject in that carefully modulated castrato voice of his, will go down in the annals of film history as perhaps the prime example of just how much contempt one human being can demonstrate to another. Granted, Perry Smith was an abomination of a man who deserved execution . . . but Hoffman's icy contempt still stabs us. Inhumanity is not always physically violent.A difficult film. You will walk out of it feeling uncomfortable and contemplative. There's still some time remaining in the calendar as of this writing (10/22/05), but I doubt I'll see a better American movie this year. 9 stars out of 10.",9,18,24,22 October 2005
Lost in Translation," Lost in time.
","Director Sofia Coppola has revealed that she had steeped herself in Antonioni films before making  *Lost in Translation*  (and indeed, there's a clip from  Fellini's  *La Dolce Vita*, Fellini of course being of the same time and place as Antonioni).  The movie painfully reveals its influence. This movie would have seemed profound and groundbreaking in 1963.  But in 2003, it seems trite.  We have a pushing-60 has-been action star  (Bill Murray), who's rueful over a disintegrating marriage and a career that has been reduced to hawking whiskey on Japanese television.  In other words, the Unhappy Middle-Aged Man.  But since he's earning TWO MILLION DOLLARS for appearing in the commercial, it's hard to empathize with this sad-sack clown.  In 2003, we need more than a man who KNOWS he's ridiculous, who KNOWS he has a ridiculous -- and ridiculously lucky -- life.  We're already a step ahead of Murray's character:  i.e., we know he's ridiculous, too.  In 1963 all this might have been a revelation.  Not so today.  And we have the beautiful, talented Scarlet Johansson as Charlotte, the young wife of a photographer who has abandoned her in the hotel while he's off working. Very unfortunately, Coppola makes Charlotte a philosophy graduate from Yale. This goes against the grain of much of what we see:  would a person like this even GET married to a fashion photographer?  would she listen to trashy, pop-culture self-help tapes?  would she -- Little Miss Philosophy-Degree-From-Yale, a presumable bookworm and culture-vulture -- be this morosely bored, anyway?Thus stranded together, Murray's Bob and Charlotte find each other while marooned in their Tokyo hotel.  We're ultimately meant to be touched by their growing friendship, mostly because of each character's sad backstory. But their backstories just aren't sad enough to merit sympathy, let alone all the melancholy that hangs over each of them in their separate hotel rooms.*Lost in Translation*  is not a terrible movie by any definition.  Murray and Johansson are quite fine, and manage some genuine chemistry.  Coppola is also a genial tour guide for Tokyo.  (Comments about this film being stereotyped or racist will surely come from politically correct knuckleheads who don't realize that any critique of Tokyo's modern culture is perforce a critique of American culture.  Downtown Tokyo looks a lot like Times Square on a busy night, after all.  Besides which, Coppola is at pains to show us glimpses of a truer, more traditional Japanese culture throughout the film.) But this movie is very easy to overrate, and the smart critic -- and viewer -- will likely fail to succumb to the impulse.",3,2,4,1 November 2003
Barry Lyndon," Gorgeous, brilliant, ironic, lifeless.
","Goes down as Kubrick's Last Great Movie. (Though seeing as how he made only three more movies, it's not as if there was a long decline.) *Barry Lyndon* was a return to form, after that wretched *Clockwork Orange* -- meaning, he refrains here from allowing his general misanthropy to get the better of his judgment. The director managed to relocate a sense of rueful pity for humanity with this work.Kubrick takes the old tale of the Rake's Progress and transforms it into something altogether new. Based on an unimportant (and unread) early novel by Thackeray, *Barry Lyndon* chronicles the rise of a middle-class Irish lad from British soldier to professional gambler to master of a great estate via an advantageous marriage. It's set in the 18th century, beginning roughly with the Seven Years War and ending rather ominously in 1789 (Kubrick tantalizes us with this important date at the end of the film, but we're not sure what to make of it). While Kubrick's presentation of the period is peerless, his main character is a liability that drags the film down from masterpiece-level to merely excellent. Most reviewers have attributed this failing to Ryan O'Neal, but astute students of Kubrick's films know better. This director, throughout his career, was simply unable to achieve what Harold Bloom has called the 'Shakespearean difference', that is, the creation of character. (Name a memorable main character from a Kubrick film that isn't a total caricature.) Redmond Barry (later Barry Lyndon, after his marriage) is an intellectual's IDEA of a Rake: we're TOLD that he's a scoundrel, but Kubrick can't be bothered to put in all that hard work that's required to SHOW us the evidence. He's far more interested in Mood and Theme -- not always such a bad thing in and of itself, but subservience of Character to these other concerns leaches away the impetus for great drama. Even the scenes in which Barry is cheating on his wife are merely snapshots -- and stylized ones at that, in the typically overintellectualized manner of Kubrick -- designed to inform us that, yes, he's a scoundrel. But in any case, Barry 'reforms' pretty quickly once he's married, so that later accusations of his 'brutality' seem unfair. Doubtless this is because Kubrick was going for High Tragedy rather than a character study. But the greatest artists manage to combine both efforts.While I've went on about the film's main faults, don't let these distract you from checking out the film. *Barry Lyndon* is very much worth your time. This is Kubrick's most wittily ironic, and most cleverly constructed work. One marvels at the director's repeated and varied use of his chosen motifs: card-playing, horses, lost loves, and most particularly, duels. Duels between man-and-man involving pistol and ten paces; duels between man and social caste; duels between man and state; duels between states. The overriding mood is unending, repetitious struggle. Barry's antagonists are legion in the film: he's always fighting somebody, or struggling against insuperable barriers in order to achieve his goals. The movie also has something to say about tribal warfare and what Jean Renoir called 'the rules of the game'. Barry can play cards, but he doesn't know how to play by the rules of the tribe he wishes to join. Hence his misfortunes in the second half of the movie.Kubrick, under the guise of a romantic period piece, offers us a sterile world in which human beings are denied the capacity for change and growth. The Tribe circles its wagons; tragedy is repetitious. Throughout most of the film, any scene indicating sentiment is immediately trashed by an ironic follow-up. (It's not until late in the film that Kubrick takes things seriously and drops the ironic mask.) All the while, monotonous pieces by Handel and Schubert drone on the soundtrack, underlining the repetitiousness of the entire work. (Handel's 'Saranbande' is constantly in the background during the final half-hour.) Kubrick even has his narrator 'spoil' the ending with 40 minutes still to go, because he wants us to marvel at his design rather than be held hostage to the plot (which, given its episodic nature, admittedly isn't much).Finally, Kubrick broke new technical ground with *Barry Lyndon* with the use of camera lenses that, for the first time, could capture indoor light without professional arc lamps and such. The interior shots in the candlelight are just that -- no fancy lighting tricks. Every period-piece owes this film a debt. In fact, most have failed to live up to this movie's example . . . but then, most directors aren't as nuttily obsessed with visual composition as Kubrick was. The final result is a period film that hasn't aged: with the one exception of the then-trendy use of camera zooms (instead of cuts), the film would look as if it were made today instead of in 1975. This is truly one of the most beautiful-looking movies ever made.",7,21,36,30 May 2004
The Aviator," Fun flick. Not *Citizen Kane*, or anything, but fun.
","Perhaps if Scorsese hadn't been essentially BULLIED into making the film by Leonardo DiCaprio, the director might have TRIED to make *The Aviator* his own *Citizen Kane*. But since the idea wasn't Scorsese's own, he makes no particular effort to achieve artistic excellence, instead amiably agreeing to do some respectable hack-work. The idea here is to make a big entertaining picture. Scorsese succeeds.Expect no more than that, however. *The Aviator* is ultimately a piece of corporate art, baiting Oscars. The canvas is unnecessarily large -- from the late 1920's to the late 1940's -- in the manner of your typical Oscar-hungry biopic. The movie sketches various aspects of Howard Hughes' professional and private life, from his monomaniacal auterist ambitions for the movie *Hell's Angels* (costing an inconceivable 4 million dollars -- the equivalent of about 700 or 800 million of today's dollars) to his uncanny futurist visions that prodded the budding aeronautical industry forward. Included are some gossipy interludes with Katherine Hepburn and Ava Gardner. And, of course, we get the inevitable obsessive-compulsive disorder that stalked him, deteriorating his mind even as his career and legend rose to unprecedented heights.But what does it all mean? In *Citizen Kane*, Orson Welles and writer Herman Mankiewicz spend the entire movie laying bare the life and motives of Charles Foster Kane: while, at the end of the picture, the shadowy reporters from the magazine stumble around Xanadu mouthing trite observations about a man's life being a puzzle, the audience has in the meantime learned where the missing pieces are located. Expect no such insight into Hughes in *The Aviator*. Why was Hughes so interested in airplanes, anyway? Why was he interested in the movies? Was the oil business (he had inherited his initial millions from a company that produced drill bits) really so much more boring than those other fields? -- and if so, why? Why was a man inflicted with a smörgåsbord of neuroses -- among them, intense dislike of crowds -- drawn to nightclubs and the Hollywood scene? Why was a man with a morbid fear of germs alley-catting around with every starlet in town? Why does this movie elide the subject of his several messy marriages? Who knows? I keep reading here that the mystery of Hughes is what makes him so fascinating, and is what makes *The Aviator* a masterpiece . . . but isn't that a counterintuitive notion? If we're not going to learn about what made the man tick, then what's the point? Scorsese doesn't even offer a point of view about Hughes, after all is said and done. He just throws the man up there, with his brilliance and his madness, as if to say, 'YOU figure him out.' This strikes me as the height of laziness, but then, as I've said, this movie isn't really Scorsese's to begin with.It's DiCaprio's, and he acts the hell out of the role, despite not really having the physical qualifications for it. I've always enjoyed DiCaprio as an actor -- his talent was always precocious, and now it has matured. I particularly enjoyed his work in the early scenes, when his obsessive-compulsive disorder manifested itself in a barely perceptible way. DiCaprio blanks out for just a second -- he disconnects. He plays the more moderate episodes with a mixture of menace and humor (the look on his face, half fear and half disgust, when he tells a colleague to wipe off a speck of dirt from his coat lapel, is a pretty magnificent thing to watch). He's less successful when he's going crazy in the film room, looking like a naked Jesus, but that's more the fault of the script, which should never take us to such ludicrously baroque extremes. I also enjoyed Cate Blanchette as Hepburn: she doesn't look like her in the least, but she captures Hepburn's peculiar voice and her overall persona superbly. Only a great actress can play one of our greatest actresses -- Blanchette fits that bill. In the final analysis, Scorsese must be praised for making such a CINEMATIC movie, if for nothing else. The flying scenes are exciting and easy to follow (the most spectacular is a crash-landing in 1940's Beverly Hills), the period details are sumptuous (Alec Baldwin's Pan-Am office, with its proto-Space Age decor, is a stand-out), and there are some great scenes for the actors (the best of which is a Dinner From Hell at the Hepburn estate). *The Aviator* is definitely a good time at the movies . . . although I suspect it was meant to be more than that. But in this degraded and degrading era for the movies, a good time is good enough for me.5 stars out of 10.",5,7,12,5 February 2005
Cold Mountain," A better-than-usual Miramax picture.
","But let's not get too carried away.  *Cold Mountain*  emerges as a profoundly unadventurous film.  It's devoid of ambiguities . . . an unforgivable thing, given the setting of the Civil War, and the subject, which is the desertion of a Confederate soldier  (Jude Law)  who forsakes 'the Cause'  in order to return home to his wallflower Southern belle (Nicole Kidman).  This movie was based on a  'prize-winning'  novel by Charles Frazier.  The story could withstand some improvement.  For instance, let's make things interesting by having Jude Law be a UNION soldier.  Let's challenge that multiplex audience just a bit.  Because after all, the 'moral problem'  of this picture as it now stands -- e.g., the hero's placing of higher importance on his love-life over his country -- has been solved far in advance.  OF COURSE any sensible fellow would desert the evil Confederate Army in order to get back to luminous Nicole.  Nicole is a worthier cause than States Rights . . . but is she worthier than Abolition? Ah . . . now the scene would begin to cloud, a bit.  And the Home Guard (who patrol the local area looking for deserters and otherwise  'assisting' those who remain home), represented by an unrecognizable Ray Winstone and several other heavies, provides the audience with straw men hissable enough to leave no doubt as to the justice of Law's desertion.  Or, if we must insist on keeping Law as a Confederate, why not make the Home Guard a bunch of nice old guys, rather than Winstone's murderous mercenary who also has a pecuniary interest in Kidman's property?  Or, even further, why not have the women at home remain fiercely patriotic, who would consider a deserter a gutless coward?  Then Law would actually have to WOO Kidman, a task he otherwise gets to avoid in this movie  (apparently, his suffering baby-blues are sufficient to make the lady weak in the knees, without the demonstration of any other virtues).But to ask for any of these possibilities is to ask too much from the likes of Miramax studio, and the wise viewer will regretfully put such considerations aside and cast about for other things to enjoy.  The fundamental emptiness of  *Cold Mountain*  gets redeemed by a number of things, starting with Anthony Minghella's expert direction, particularly with regards to the difficult time structure in the first half.  The picture is graced with astounding cinematography all the way through, but especially near the beginning during the siege of Petersburg:  the gigantic pit caused by a large underground explosion, and the resultant  'turkey shoot'  by the Confederates after the Federals stupidly rush in, is smeared over with a dank, sulfurous haze, making the scene look like something from Hell itself. (The movie is otherwise gorgeous as hell.)  And finally, a large cast of well-known faces contributes, rather than distracts:  Philip Seymour Hoffman gets another opportunity to give a flashy performance; Brendan Gleeson, Kathy Baker, and Ray Winstone  (despite the phoniness of his part)  all provide strong support.  But praise is especially deserving to two young actresses:  Natalie Portman as a widow with a sick baby whom Law encounters on his trek home; and the wonderful Renee Zellweger as a sort of prototypical white-trash tomboy named Ruby.  Portman surprisingly, and magnificently, aces the crucial cameo part of the desperate widow . . . and Zellweger steals the entire movie out from under everybody's feet.  (Kidman knows it, and doesn't even bother to challenge Zellweger for supremacy in their scenes together.)  Once Ruby is -- finally -- introduced  (it takes almost an hour), the rest of the movie is basically a waiting game:  we wait for the next scene with Zellweger, and become indefatigably bored with the dour young man trudging homeward.  In fact, we didn't realize how bored we were with  *Cold Mountain*  until she shows up.  It's the serio-comic performance of the year, and the  'Academy'  should feel free to give her a long overdue Oscar for it.  She makes this otherwise dutifully anti-war picture  (and hence, rightfully unpopular picture, given our current circumstances)  well worth seeing.",5,0,1,3 January 2004
Apocalypse Now," Pretentious pastiche.
","Overblown, occasionally interesting, but mostly pretentious pastiche of Joseph Conrad's  *Heart of Darkness*.  The Vietnam conflict serves as the Ultimate Metaphor for Coppola, as he sends discharged Captain Willard (Martin Sheen)  up the Mekong Delta.  His assignment?  Dispatch a certain Colonel Kurtz, a Green Beret who has apparently gone stark raving mad in the jungle of Cambodia.  Along the way, Willard meets a middle-aged Robert Duvall who can talk about nothing but surfing  (and in a Southern drawl, too), and a small crew of your typical  'Nam grunts that accompany him on his boat ride.  The general point of the film seems to be that War is Hell, or that Man is a murderous savage at the very least.  Wow, man.Coppola throws so much at the screen that some of it is bound to stick and hold your attention.  The scene where the Hueys glide above the breaking surf with Wagner's  'Flight of the Valkyries'  blaring on rigged-up speakers on the copters is justly famous  (though nonsensical and over-the-top). Dennis Hopper in a brief appearance manages to steal the entire movie ('Did you know that  'if'  is in the middle of  'life', man?!', etc.). Coppola's setting-afire of an entire jungle with Jim Morrison intoning  'This is the end . . .'  on the soundtrack is an astonishing sight, though necessarily modified by the knowledge that this film continues to be condemned for creating some of the worst environmental damage in the history of movies. And there's a truly chilling sequence in which Willard stumbles upon a last outpost of GI's engaged in a chaotic, meaningless firefight with an unseen enemy.But most of the movie is merely the boat ride, accompanied by some truly dreadful faux-noir voice-over narration  ('Accusing someone of murder here was like handing out speeding tickets at the Indy 500' . . . you get the idea).  Willard mulls over the spectacularly banal history of Colonel Kurtz, while the crew gets on each other's nerves.  In the  *Redux*  version, there's an excruciating detour on a plantation that houses a group of snappily dressed French expatriates, a 30-minute digression that was edited out of the first cut for a very good reason:  it's sophomoric.  Anyway, on it goes, until Willard finally comes face-to-face with Ultimate Evil . . . which turns out to be just a middle-aged, overweight Marlon Brando, mumbling inaudibly, snacking on what appears to be macadamia nuts, and reading to Willard alternately between old issues of  'Time Magazine'  and T.S. Eliot's poetry.  'It smelled of death in there,'  narrates Willard, referring to Kurtz' lair, 'Of malaria . . . nightmares . . .'  but we remain bemusedly unconvinced.  Perhaps it smelled simply of macadamia nuts.",3,5,13,9 October 2003
The Battle of Algiers," Scandalously relevant.
","I disagree with the comments here stating that Gillo Pontecorvo's *The Battle of Algiers* is an even-handed account of the Algerian uprising in the Fifties. I had always thought, perhaps simple-mindedly, that the movie was clearly on the side of the denizens of the Kasbah. After all, the script was inspired by the life and activities of a FLN leader who also literally acts in an important role in the movie. Seeing the movie again -- via Criterion's absurdly lavish 3-disc (!) edition -- did nothing to alter my opinion, though it DID provoke some new perspective on why the movie may SEEM even-handed.In two words? Jean Martin. He plays Colonel Mathieu, a former Resistance fighter and concentration camp veteran, now in the untenable position of winning a battle in a war doomed to failure for the French. Martin happens to be the only professional actor on the premises, and this probably explains his dangerous magnetism on screen and his ability to get us to immediately latch onto him for 'identification'. Everybody admires a good soldier, and Mathieu is exactly that. Cool, world-weary, competent, tactically brilliant, not above admiring his enemies, sophisticated. Everybody admires a good actor, also, and Martin gets all the good lines in *The Battle of Algiers*, which is really unfortunate, because we should be admiring the Algerians instead of this professional oppressor. This is the flaw in Pontecorvo's movie that, in my opinion, prevents it from being a true masterpiece. Col. Mathieu damn near unbalances the whole thing when he irrupts into the movie about a half-hour into it.The problem is that there are no equally compelling Muslim figures in the film to balance off Mathieu. Jaffar, played by the above-mentioned real-life FLN leader Saadi Yacef, is an important character to the plot yet has no interiority. The young man playing the fiery 'Ali La Pointe' LOOKS magnificent, but the script doesn't do much for him, other than to tell him to look angry. We don't get to know the three women who tart themselves up as French sophisticates in order to sneak past the checkpoints so that they can plant bombs in civilian areas. The teenage boys who shoot the gendarmes to death are just faces in the crowd. Pontecorvo's magisterial Neo-Realism manages to be both dry and diabolically partisan: after all, a nameless mass of people avoids having character flaws, and Pontecorvo and Yacef don't want to muddy the waters with unlikeable individuals. (But perhaps we don't want that either, as the Algerians' cause is eminently just.) If you want to be politically correct, you may congratulate Pontecorvo for refusing to present the Muslims in a traditionally melodramatic way, but this approach fails the test of great drama: development of character.Having said all that, I also don't want to be misconstrued: *The Battle of Algiers* is a great and important film that is an almost mandatory viewing experience, given the shocking and scandalous similarities between what's going on in Arabia right now and the events of the Algerian uprising depicted in this film. It appears that officials at the Pentagon screened this movie for themselves a couple of years ago: one hopes that the scenes of torture in *The Battle of Algiers* didn't give them some kinky ideas for Abu Ghraib and Guantanamo Bay, though it's rather hard to imagine what other uses they could get out of the movie (besides, of course, the obvious lesson: don't mess with the Muslims). The scenes of torture, terrorism, and the loud clamoring for freedom will alternately raise blood pressures and stoke outrage, regardless of an individual's political bias. The cinematography by Marcello Gatti is a culmination of Neo-Realist and cinema-verite techniques, and the score by Ennio Morricone is groundbreaking.Make an effort to see *The Battle of Algiers*; it will truly pay off. No film released in the Sixties has more relevance for us today than this one. 7 stars out of 10.",7,5,10,16 December 2004
The 40-Year-Old Virgin," The movie's poster is funnier than the movie.
","The feeling persists that Steve Carell is somehow smarter than this material. Perhaps it was his association with 'The Daily Show' that generates high expectations . . . or, if 'high' is too strong a word, our expectations are raised at least some inches above the curb abutting the gutter. And indeed, perhaps the original treatment intended to be a witty and ironic take on what is and is not expected of males in the sexual arena in our modern society. Blah blah blah.But that's precisely the sort of movie that Hollywood would never bankroll, and so such idle speculations are really a waste of time. Carell and director John Apatow keep the material strictly aimed at the most lucrative target audience of 18-to-25 year-olds, as well as the younger adolescents who will view the DVD later: morning stiffies; 'you-know-how-I-can-tell-you're-gay' wisecracks; plenty of T & A; a chick barfing in some dude's face. Carell achieves at least one original moment, to put it charitably (others may call it an all-time new low): he literally gets his hirsute chest bloodily waxed before our eyes. Laughing yet? Yeah -- nothing for adults here, even though the title informs us that it's about a 40-year-old.Then it occurred to me that I was AGAIN witnessing a film featuring both Carell and Paul Rudd. The last time was in *Anchorman*. *The 40-Year-Old Virgin*, therefore, firmly belongs within the Wilson/Vaughn/Stiller/Ferrell/Rudd Nexus of Bad Comedy that I railed about in my review of *Wedding Crashers*. Now, we can add another forward-slash, followed by Carell's name, to the Nexus' lengthy prefix. I suppose one ought to be thankful that Will Ferrell doesn't put in a cameo in this one. Indeed, I almost raised up the rating for *The 40-Year-Old Virgin* to 2 stars out of sheer gratitude for this fact. But! -- Luke Wilson is referenced by actual name when one of the sexy females in the movie compares the Carell character to Wilson, physically speaking. (Carell, who wrote much of the screenplay, proves once again the eternal egotism of writers.) Now that was just one reference to the Nexus too many; therefore, back down to 1 star.",1,23,48,24 August 2005
Collateral," Slick, empty -- much like the lead actor.
","I knew *Collateral* wouldn't really be good, but I was a big fan of Michael Mann's *Heat*, one of the great crime films of the Nineties. I admit to a sort of fondness for Mann's portentous, slick style, even though such fondness is really against my better critical judgment. *Collateral* does have the typically operatic moments we associate with Mann's work: the slow sweep of the police copters over the throbbing neon of downtown L.A.; the sleazy decadence of your average industrial-beat-thumping nightclub; the macho professionalism of the cops and their drug-lord antagonists (even though the latter resort to telling threatening stories about Mexican Santa Clauses who leave little toy burros on the windowsills of naughty Mexican kids [don't ask -- it ain't worth it]). . . . Occasionally, the picture has that Mann shimmer to it, especially at the end, when a cobalt-blue dawn illuminates an industrial landscape of power-lines and train-tracks.Unfortunately, the movie also has Tom Cruise, with a shimmer of his own: a bad dye-job on his hair. Short and spiky, it looks as if it was dipped in melted chrome and dusted over with blue kohl. They even colored his adolescent beard and bushy eyebrows the same color. What gives? Was this some attempt to give Cruise 'gravitas'? Meanwhile, we're still looking at the 5' 4' frame and listening to the pre-adam's apple dipthongs. And he's wearing a silver-gray suit that MATCHES the hair. Oh Lord. (And the advertisement atop Jamie Foxx's cab touts 'Bacardi Silver'. Hey, all this color-symbolism stuff is downright Kubrickian! Right?) The point is, we NEVER buy for ONE SECOND that Tom Cruise is a ruthless contract killer . . . or some of us don't, at least. Otherwise respectable film critics are giving Cruise high marks for believability, but please recall that the newspapers for which they work ADVERTISE these films, and dissing Cruise or his movies would definitely characterize a critic as a 'non-team player'.To make matters worse, the script provides Cruise with all kinds of Oscar-bait. In several windy monologues, the hit-man wheedles on about the existentialism of suburban L.A., the merits of Charlie Mingus, the death ratio per-hour from the Rwanda genocide -- you name it. As a member of the paying movie-going public, I don't need to hear my hit-men lecturing me about Rwanda, thanks. Meanwhile, Foxx's response to all this is a sort of what-the-hell're-you-Talking'-about scrunched-up expression, amplified with several 'whatever, man''s. My sentiments exactly.Let it be said that Foxx out-acts the Big Shot all over the place. We forget that the cabdriver is Jamie Foxx, even as we're constantly reminded that the hit-man is Indisputably Tom Cruise. But the script lets Foxx down, as well, during the scene in which he's chattering his teeth at an evil drug-cartel overlord. One minute he's terrified . . . the next, he's threatening to go all postal on the gun-toting goon standing behind him. Didn't buy it, sorry. I also didn't buy the old low-battery-cell-phone shtik. Quick, call the Cliché Police before that battery runs out!Best scene in the flick is the convergence of hit-man, cabdriver, police, and Asian drug lords at a thumping night-club. Real suspense here, along with realistic gun-play, even though it further cements the Cruise character as a sort of Terminator with a you-can't-touch-this force-field around him. (Maybe it's the silver glow.) The whole scene sort of reminded me of Chaplin's *Modern Times*, that part in which the Tramp's attempt to serve a customer roast duck across a crowded dance-floor becomes an Epic Quest.But Mann has already lost us before that, when he resorts to pulling out the old coyotes-roaming-Pico-Boulevard card. Ah well -- brainless summer fun. Enjoy. 3- or 4-stars out of 10.",3,20,35,8 August 2004
Batman Begins," Fresh start.
","Well, the fan-boys are swarming on this review page for *Batman Begins* -- hundreds upon hundreds of 10-star reviews, calling it a masterpiece. Calm down. It's good, but not THAT good. But then again, given the standards of comic-book movies, *Batman Begins* is indeed a 10-star movie, and is the biggest surprise of the summer. You'll do far better here than suffering through the conclusion to George Lucas' overblown space epic. In general film terms, however, it's merely recommendable, rating somewhere in the middle of the spectrum. It's not a masterpiece; it's simply a good time at the movies, and during the withering heat of summer, that's surely good enough.The movie exceeds Tim Burton's original, in my opinion, if only because it's less like a comic book and just simply more interesting. The interest comes from the Caped Crusader's back-story, which director Christopher Nolan and his writer Goyer expand to the far reaches of the Asian steppes. There, a pre-Batman Bruce Wayne, consumed with anger over the murder of his parents by a common criminal some years earlier, finds himself in jail for petty crimes. He's bailed out by a macho mystic named Ducard (Liam Neeson, once again adding heft to a movie before prematurely disappearing), who advises Wayne to join a crime-fighting cult called the League of Shadows. Wayne is put through the paces of vigorous, violent training by this ninja cult, but ultimately rejects their 'do what is necessary' dogma. Wayne has a more 'nuanced' philosophy: he won't be an executioner, and he won't destroy a civilization just because it's corrupt. The rest of the movie treads along more familiar paths.*Batman Begins* is heavily influenced by current real-life attitudes and events. The Bush mindset of 'do what is necessary' is shown here to lead to daft murderousness; the poison-gas plot reflects a post-9/11 fear of terrorism. The movie's recurring tag-line about how a person is not defined by what he is, but what he DOES, is another slap at our current leadership. You can be a god-fearing Christian; but do you commence illegal, unfounded wars and sanction the torture of our enemies? It's what you DO that defines you.Nolan has wrought a fine, exciting movie that pushes the boundaries of, yet firmly stays within, the parameters of the summer blockbuster. Do NOT take very young children to this; the PG-13 rating is a 'hard' rating, to be taken seriously. Cillian Murphy's trumped-up costume as the Scarecrow, enhanced by hallucinatory CGI, will give the kiddies nightmares. Despite the obvious nods to Lang's *Metropolis* and Scott's *Blade Runner*, Gotham is a realistic looking parallel-universe city that is imbued with a more vital intensity than Burton's Art Deco Gotham full of campy 40-foot-tall statues: the verisimilitude of the setting here enhances, rather than detracts from, the fantasy. Ang Lee's *Hulk* carried a grimness comparable to this film, but that movie was hampered by Lee's absurd insistence on reminding us that it was all just a stupid comic book (e.g., the split-screens designed to look like comic panels, and so forth). *Batman Begins* could be any madman's fantasy, existing with complete independence from its comic-book origins. Perhaps this is because the movie tells the story from the very beginning, thus freeing the material from its 60-odd years of pop culture baggage.Other positives: the strong supporting cast, including the likes of Morgan Freeman, Michael Caine, and Gary Oldman as Wayne's various pillars of support. Christian Bale in the lead role is quite good, as well: he plays Wayne with an air redolent of snotty privilege, but he really comes alive in that suit, radiating film-noir tough-guy cool and occasional over-the-top menace, using a sotto-voce growl that absolutely tickled me. Bale is the best Batman on record. Negatives? Katie Holmes as the pointless girlfriend (her whole plot-line should have been excised in the interest of controlling the excessive running-time); the fight-scenes are shot too close and further mucked up with too many rapid-fire cuts (no surprise there, given current stylistic trends); the climax is an overwrought waste of dough, cribbing from *Spider-Man 2*'s runaway elevated train, to say nothing of the ludicrous and baffling complexity of the villain's attempt to evaporate Gotham's water-supply. Also, the subject-matter as a whole is rather silly: a billionaire fighting crime in a bat-suit. But the movie's bracing grimness and sense of outright horror manages to minimize the silliness. In my review of *Hulk*, I posited the notion that that movie wasn't good because it forgot to have fun. *Batman Begins* isn't 'fun', precisely, yet it works. I guess the key is that this movie never seems wholly outlandish. Plausibility + spectacle trumps mere spectacle every time.A solid 5 stars out of 10 (higher, if you're already predisposed to this sort of material). Go see it.",5,2,7,19 June 2005
Meet the Fockers," Life-support machine for DreamWorks.
","Like virtually all mainstream releases, *Meet the Fockers* is, of course, really too awful to warrant an amateur review: only the professionals should be forced to deal with the dreary task. But a movie whose cast includes Robert De Niro, Dustin Hoffman, and Barbra Streisand would SEEM to invite discussion. Thirty years ago, such a cast would have indicated a Major Motion Picture. In 2005, I'm sorry to report that these living-legend actors have been inducted -- however profitably to themselves -- in the ongoing mission to Keep DreamWorks Afloat. The Stiller/De Niro 'franchise' has officially joined the *Shrek* series as an anomalous money-maker for the studio. The creative bankruptcy of Messrs. Spielberg, Geffen, and Katzenberg resulted in the demise of both the TV and music units of the company; and as for the movie-wing of the operation, that creative bankruptcy has never been more clearly demonstrated than with *Meet the Fockers*.But, as I've said, *Fockers* appears to be making a lot of box-office dough, so the sheer awfulness is likely to continue. Expect *Fockers 3* and maybe even a *Fockers 4*. (Expect the same for *Shrek*, too.) In fact, the sequels may go on and on until somebody over at DreamWorks finds a way to concoct a good movie. Or maybe Spielberg will occasionally drag himself into the director's chair and put the aging Toms -- Hanks or Cruise -- through the motions of the occasional spurious blockbuster.I realize I've not talked much about the movie itself, but why bother? The first film of the series, *Meet the Parents*, at least had the chemistry between De Niro and Stiller, and an overall funny premise: the nice Jewish guy desperately trying to fit into the suburban milieu of a pathologically WASPish family. The Stiller character's all-too-human propensity for telling white-lie upon white-lie complicated his troubles and increased the comedy. In *Fockers*, Stiller and De Niro are curiously muted in their (few) scenes together. One wonders if they were getting along on the set. But on the other hand, the movie isn't focused on their interpersonal dynamic anyway, choosing instead to make De Niro the put-upon character, overwhelming him with the stereotypical 'earthiness' (i.e., 'Jewishness', I suppose) of the Focker parents. This diminishment of De Niro totally misses the point of what worked in the first movie, which is that he was a larger-than-life maniac whose expectations were so high that nobody, especially not Ben Stiller, could hope to match them.As for Hoffman and Streisand, they bring nothing unique to their stereotypical roles: any pair of aging actors would have sufficed. The fact that they're introduced by way of an answering machine only cements their irrelevance. I even doubt that they've enhanced the box-office profits, as most people under the age of 30 scarcely know who they are, anyway -- Hoffman and Streisand haven't been major screen presences for some time. Which brings me back to De Niro: he had better play *King Lear* or its contemporary equivalent, and do it fast. One tires of watching this great actor continue to trash his legacy with these god-awful comedies. He needs to remind us that he was once considered the greatest screen actor since Brando. (But then, Brando ended up as a joke, too. Curse of *The Godfather*, perhaps?)1 star out of 10.",1,22,45,15 January 2005
The Little Mermaid," Saved Disney.
","The question to ask with any post-Walt Disney animated film is:  W.W.W.D? (What Would Walt Do?)  Having seen this with my goddaughter recently, I can safely say that Walt would have done  *The Little Mermaid*, and he would have done it in much the same way that director John Musker does it here. (Though ole Walt may have looked askance at Ariel's flirty seashell bra, to say nothing of her frank sensuality.)  So how did this film save the Disney Studio?  By going Back to Basics:  tirelessly detailed animation; Hans Christian Andersen; clearly delineated heroes and villains; hilariously inadequate male love interests; amusing sidekicks.  It is no accident that this movie resembles  *Snow White*  more than any other  'modern'  Disney cartoon:  it is clearly attempting to mine, once again, the Old Stuff, the Classic Motherlode.  It was a triumphant return to form, after two decades of forgettable attempts to be more  'relevant'  (*Black Hole*, anyone?)  to post-Sixties audiences.Every one of the 84 minutes counts in this picture.  Not a scene is wasted, not even the musical numbers, which -- for once -- build character or advance the plot.  Lean, mean, and to the point.  Doubtless, the hand-drawn animation provided the incentive for brevity and clarity.  More recent Disney films, relying on cheaper and easier computer graphics, have shown a marked tendency of bloat.  The story's  'deadline'  of 3 days -- during which Ariel is magically granted legs in order to pass as human and hence make the Prince give her a true love's kiss, thereby making her human forever -- also tightens things up.  More suspense is added when the evil sea-witch Ursula, as a further condition for granting Ariel's wish to be human, removes the mermaid's magical voice -- the one thing that the Prince would recognize about her.  It should be added that evil Ursula is truly nasty as well as comical, providing just the right foil for the sweet mermaid.  Simple Good vs. Evil, here -- no  'Golden Bough'  moral complexity of, say, *The Lion King*, in which the animals worship the birth of the very creature who will likely grow up to eat them.  *The Little Mermaid*  keeps it simple, stupid -- Walt would've approved.",8,1,2,16 May 2004
Schindler's List," Can we criticize this movie now?
","I mean, has enough time passed?  Or has the release of  *Schindler's List* on DVD fueled a new hushed awe towards the picture?Spielberg's critic-proof Holocaust film has several problems, the biggest of which is the way it turns a horrible real-life tragedy into a three-hanky melodrama.  I continue to maintain that the Holocaust is generally unfilmable, in terms of what we might call a standard movie.  Generally unfilmable, but not inevitably unfilmable.  Off the top of my head, I can recommend two recent films on this subject:  Francesco Rosi's  *The Truce*, and Costa-Gavras'  *Amen'.  Both films approach this material with far more nuance than Spielberg's film, which, I repeat, is weepy melodrama.  (And as such, treads a fine line between reverence and tastelessness.)  For that matter, Polanski's  *The Pianist*  gives us a more unique approach than what we get here, which is a movie that features a hero whom your average American multiplex popcorn-tub-muncher can easily identify with:  a gregarious capitalist named Oskar Schindler  (Liam Neeson)  who, despite all the war-profiteering  (read:  'initiative'), turns out to have a heart of gold.  Or marshmallow mush.  Please don't bother pointing out that this is a 'true story':  those who've read the actual book by Thomas Kenneally on which the movie is based will be rather shocked by the movie's willingness to sacrifice verisimilitude for  'dramatic license'.  The biggest example of this is the  'villain'  of the piece, SS-Kommandant Amon Goeth  (Ralph Fiennes in a career-making performance).  The screenplay ladles all sorts of Freudian syrup over this character, meaning:  he's crazy as a loon.  So much for the  'banality of evil':  instead, we get, via Fiennes'  Method-y performance, a study in mere neurosis instead of a rigorous examination of the murderous pathology that's inherent in humanity.  Spielberg can't resist having Herr Goeth develop a crush on one of his Jewish housemaids, and we get the requisite  'Hath not a Jew eyes'  speech, delivered with what is supposed to be irony by Fiennes.  Then he beats the crap out of her. Change the plot particulars, and you've got your standard  'Lifetime Channel' movie about an abusive husband.Don't get me wrong, the film is not a total waste of time:  even melodrama has cumulative virtues, and many of the scenes in  *Schindler's List*  are quite affecting, particularly the very last sequence in which the surviving 'Schindler Jews'  appear  (in color), accompanied by the actors who portrayed them.  They pay tribute to Schindler by laying stones on his grave.  Moving stuff.  Ben Kingsley, who portrays the worry-wart Itzhak Stern, must also receive special mention.  And Spielberg's technical mastery is never open to question:  this is one beautifully mounted film, impeccably photographed.  The set-design, which is called upon to perform the daunting task of replicating Nazi labor camps and so forth, is beyond reproach. Proving that he's still the same guy who directed  *Jaws*, Spielberg is able to send chills up our spines when a train full of Jewish women & girls is accidentally routed to Auschwitz:  it's a night-scene, replete with a light-tower that approximates a beacon from Hell.But, all-in-all, the movie remains an elementary approach to the Holocaust genre.  It's tailor-made for desultory viewings by 12th-graders:  'Hey mom, we learned about the Holocaust in class today.'  Nothing wrong with that, but aren't the kids better served by a FACTUAL documentary about this subject, rather than an Oscar-baited exercise in self-importance?  You decide.",3,93,200,2 March 2004
Million Dollar Baby," He doesn't train girls.
","Let's dispense with the plot synopsis -- IMDb thoughtfully provides one for you. Instead, let's immediately assert that Clint Eastwood is a film master, and his latest, *Million Dollar Baby* (shot in 36 days!), is a masterpiece. I would not have thought it possible for him to follow up *Mystic River* -- perhaps the greatest American movie in a decade -- with another astonishing film, but he has done it. How? one wonders. The man's ongoing mastery is almost dismaying, in the same way that Michelangelo's incessant masterpieces must've disheartened artists who were 60 years younger than himself.Eastwood is indeed the Michelangelo of today's art, cinema. Young filmmakers 50 or so years younger than Eastwood may want to take note of how the director shapes the script he's given, how he incrementally builds a narrative, how he excises wasted scenes while at the same time keeping things moving along at a leisurely pace, how he introduces developments within his characters whenever the plot demands a new angle on their behavior, how he maintains a consistent visual tone that matches the story's theme, how he includes revealing details that pay off later, how he mingles his tragedy with a sprinkle of wit here and there, and how he can produce a hard-earned emotional impact out of the most standardized narrative material. Watch and learn, kids. Then watch again.(Vague spoiler follows) If you're feel secure in your dogmas -- religious, philosophical, or otherwise -- then *Million Dollar Baby* is bound to be an upsetting experience for you. The most devastating, artistically sublime scene in the film occurs when Clint's Frankie confronts his priest (who has had to put up with Frankie's annoying theological quizzes each week at Mass) about the circumstances of his beloved boxing protégé, Maggie. Frankie is, for once, seeking real answers: should he fulfill her request or not? What are the moral implications? The priest, horrified at Frankie's raw pain, can only mouth Church dogma before scuttling out of the camera's frame, far away from the unanswerable darkness sitting beside him. The movie has ensured that the priest's answers -- that is to say, moral generalities -- are meaningless within an individual context. THIS is the heart of what the film is about, and it is apparently not sitting well with some of our ideologues. Rush Limbaugh and Michael Medved are rightfully terrified of this movie's message, which is that life's dilemmas usually cannot be easily answered by either Fox News or your local Sunday service. Know-it-alls and other 'morality' types are advised to stay far away from this movie. Because, you see, Frankie doesn't train girls . . . and Eastwood doesn't make movies for girls, either. He makes movies for women. And men. In other words, he makes movies for adults.9 stars out of 10.",9,4,7,14 February 2005
Garden State," Or, The All-Consuming Importance of Zach Braff.
","Even though TV actor Zach Braff writes, directs, and stars in *Garden State*, I suppose we really ought to blame Dustin Hoffman for it, for *The Graduate* hangs heavily over this movie, like a self-obsessed pall. Zach Braff's Andrew Largeman is yet another representation of the gradual declension of the American male in popular culture, starting with Hoffman's morose little Benjamin back in the Sixties. 40 years after *The Graduate*, who are the hot male stars? Effeminate wisps like Leonardo DiCaprio, puny aesthetes like Tobey Maguire, zonked mumblers like Jake Gyllenhaal -- these, and all the others like them, trace their ancestry directly back to Benjamin. Triumph of the Nerds. Post-macho, post-masculine, hell, even post-penile. Lee Marvin and John Wayne and Humphrey Bogart and Clark Gable spin in their graves.An apt segue: *Garden State* concerns itself with graves. In one scene we watch, unconvinced, while one of Andrew's old high school buddies -- a gravedigger -- removes a trinket from a freshly dug grave. What are supposed to do with this information? What purpose does it serve, other than making us question why Andrew would be on friendly terms with such a ghoul? The fact is, it's merely one sequence in a dozen in which Braff begs for our attention by throwing up meaningless quirkiness on the screen. A dog humps Andrew's leg in a doctor's waiting room. A guy in full knight's armor -- including beaver and helmet -- eats a bowl of cereal. Indeed, these irritating mannerisms are inaugurated from the opening frames: in a dream sequence, Andrew sits emotionless while his airplane is in the process of crashing. While his fellow passengers panic, he calmly adjusts the overhead air conditioning. Then he wakes up to a sterile, blinding white bedroom, lying half-awake on white bedsheets, listening to his father on the answering machine inform him that his mother has just drowned in the bathtub. Our hero closes his eyes.Essentially, what Braff is doing is attempting to obfuscate the adolescent nature of his material with postmodern distractions. Boil this baby down, and you get your basic Guy-Comes-To-Terms-With-His-Parents-And-Gets-A-Pretty-Girlfriend-At-The-End story. Most of us tried to write this novel when we were in our late teens or early twenties; fortunately, most of us gave up when the unoriginality of it occurred to us in an embarrassing flash. Braff, however, is not cursed with such self-awareness. He apparently believes that if he out-Andersons Wes Anderson, presents an unwavering moody mien, and keeps the background noisy with the guitar strumming of maudlin pop groups like Coldplay, he'll achieve instant credibility as an 'artist'. Unfortunately, he has succeeded in this, as the reviews from the kids here at IMDb attest.Even worse, a fair amount of professional film critics have also taken him seriously, perhaps because he refrains from resorting to flatulence jokes during the film. Boy, we really have learned to settle for less, haven't we? For some of us, however, fraudulence is not necessarily an improvement on flatulence. Some of us also dare to assert that ONE Wes Anderson is more than enough. But Braff is not even honest with his indie-film borrowings: the sappy, trite ending, which I won't spoil, reveals his squishy Hollywood center, his desire for wide multiplex release, his quest for mainstream success. The big-name casting also gives the game away: many of the faces are familiar, with two heavy-hitters -- Ian Holm and Natalie Portman (the latter slumming here for indie cred) -- in prominent roles. My growing dislike of *Garden State* turned to sharp disgust when I witnessed Zach Braff, as Holm's son, lecture Holm -- who is supposed to be a psychiatrist (!) -- about the importance of communication in their relationship. Wisdom from the mouths of babes, I guess. Or perhaps arrogance from the mouths of self-centered twits who can't relinquish even one good line of dialog to one of the century's great actors. Understandably, Holm looks rather insulted throughout the proceedings.An unforgiving 1 star out of 10. Avoid.",1,10,23,15 September 2004
Pride & Prejudice," Oh, why not.
","Hm. THIS is what we've been missing, right? Another cinematic adaptation of a Jane Austen novel! And, by all means, let's adapt Austen's most obscure, least-read work: 'Pride and Prejudice'! Let's face it, Joe Wright's film has a lot going against it from the outset. I couldn't rouse myself to go see it when it was in theaters last year: the prospect of being utterly bored (ANOTHER Austen adaptation?) certainly encouraged the notion that I could wait to see it on a rainy afternoon at home. And the actual execution of the film hasn't entirely dispelled the boredom, as this material is so well-worn that you could almost recite it in your sleep. The cinephile can only think back with gratitude to the example set by Stanley Kubrick, who, after realizing that he couldn't get enough financing to make the film about Napoleon that he had wanted to make, turned to an almost-forgotten novel, 'Barry Lyndon', by Thackeray. There are scores of 18th- and 19th century novelists whose works we've never read. Filmmakers: surprise us, for God's sake! The good news is, Wright & Co. DO surprise us by making an adequately entertaining movie, despite the long odds. Much of the film's success has to do with Austen herself: stick with her (meaning, her themes, her interpretations of her characters, her narrative) and you'll be all right. Screenwriter Deborah Moggach pulls off a marvel of ruthless synthesis with her script. You feel that nothing is really left out; the highest points in the story are raised and illustrated with care, even if the richness of the details must perforce be excised. We're also grateful that Wright, Moggach, and their editors stick to their guns in terms of brevity. The fact is, a 3-hour movie would still be too short, and those rich details would still need to be cut -- therefore, it's eminently sensible that the filmmakers keep the length to just over 2 hours. The only plot element that seems to suffer from this otherwise praiseworthy effort of getting to the point is Elizabeth's flirtation with Wickham. Even if Wickham was always just a tool to get Lizzy's mind off of Darcy, he needs to be a bigger tool than what's evident in the five minutes of screen time the character is afforded here. In other words, he needs to be a real romantic possibility for Lizzy, and his lies about Darcy need to be deeply believed by not just her, but by us, as well. (Austen was a wicked plotter!) The romantic suspense gets lost, to say nothing of Austen's commentary on the predatory social climbers of her time.All that remains are the performances. Matthew Macfadyen doesn't convince as a proud young grandee. He's morose enough, I suppose, but is also too clearly love-struck to fool Lizzy (and us) about his character and motives. Donald Sutherland as Mr. Bennet seems too sloppy and too amiable: we never get the sense of deeply-felt irritation which is at the root of Mr. Bennet's sardonic witticisms. Tom Hollander as Mr. Collins affords a pleasant surprise, investing this character -- too often hammed-up as a slimy buffoon -- with a fussy little dignity and even a certain amount of decency. (Austen had always implied that if he was good enough for Ms. Lucas, then surely WE can tolerate him.) And two of Great Britain's grandest actresses, Brenda Blethyn and Judi Dench as Mrs. Bennet and The Lady Catherine De Bourg respectively, are so well-suited for their roles as to render pointless any discussion of their portrayals: they're both perfect, obviously.The revelation here, what makes this movie ultimately worth watching, is Keira Knightley in the lead role. Let it be said at once that a Star is born. Ms. Knightley displays a screen magnetism that heretofore had only been hinted at, for one thing; for another, she provides her interpretation with just the right admixture of tenderness, intelligence, and steel. Is she too young for the part? Actually, no: Elizabeth is 22 in the novel, as I recall; Knightley was about 20 during filming. (Her tender age makes her performance all the impressive!) Critics have complained about her girlishness, the giggling, and so on, but I for one thought that Jennifer Ehle from what women the world over call the 'Colin Firth Mini-Series' produced by A&E came across too often as an experienced wife of a dozen years with children playing in the backyard. Knightley is far more plausible as an inexperienced young woman just past 20 who is nonetheless smart enough and tough enough to withstand the interrogations of the fearsome Lady Catherine. It IS possible for one of literature's greatest feminist characters to be YOUNG, just as Austen wrote her.5 stars out of 10.",5,3,5,30 April 2006
The Last Samurai," Cruise discovers Kurosawa; audience pays the price.
","Tom Cruise stars in  *Dances With Samurai* . . . er, *The Last Samurai*, a movie that asks us to bemoan Western cultural imperialism while at the same time being a piece of Western cultural imperialism.  But that shouldn't particularly bother American audiences, who are never so happy when spoonfed the same mush over and over.  And boy, is this movie the same mush!  It takes its plot directly from Costner's  *Dances With Wolves*, right down to the Civil War era  (OK, this takes place a little after the War)  and even the journal kept by the hero.  And once again, this movie, like Costner's, proposes the patrician notion that only a scion from Western Civilization can possibly teach the older and presumably more naive culture about just how corrupt Westerners can be.  Again, the hero renounces his own culture and thoroughly steeps himself in the alien one, and again the benefits of the cultural exchange are given primarily one way:  FROM white, TO Other. AND AGAIN  (sorry to keep repeating myself, but  *Samurai*  and  *Dances* are really the same movie), the story tries to have its cake while eating it, i.e. by trashing the Westerners as corrupt while carefully eliding any unpleasant aspects of the older culture it purports to elevate.  Meaning, we see none of the degrading subjection of women, the narrow and limiting tradition of the tribal blood feud, the empty militarism at the expense of cultural broadening, the rigid caste system, the scientific and medical ignorance, etc. etc.  On the contrary.  The village where Cruise is held prisoner during the winter and spring is seen as an idyllic paradise where its inhabitants spend every waking hour doing some self-improving activity or other.  It's a village run by some pretty nice warlords.  Needless to say, Akira Kurosawa wouldn't have made this movie.  (Remember farmer Mifune's excoriating of the samurai in  *Seven Samurai*?)But it's inevitable, and doubtless intended, that this movie will be compared to some of Kurosawa's samurai epics, particularly the later ones like  *Kagemusha*  and  *Ran*.  To give  *The Last Samurai*  its due, the swordfights and the climactic battle are very well executed:  staged intelligently, and throbbing with catch-your-breath excitement.  Director Edward Zwick shows that the superb battle scenes in his earlier  *Glory* were no fluke:  if anything, he has improved as an action director.  The great battle in this movie excels Gibson's accomplishment in  *Braveheart* by a good measure, and even touches Kurosawa's savage beauties.  But that's where the artistry -- and the comparisons to Kurosawa -- end  (or should end, if there's any critical acumen out there).  I'm sorry to say that Mr. Cruise, perhaps even out of a love for Kurosawa's old films, just couldn't resist the ample opportunity to horn in on one of cinema's great traditions. Perhaps the ego dictated that he could  'add'  to this tradition, or at any rate make it  'accessible'  to modern  (and American)  audiences.  One hopes the Japanese won't be fooled:  surely they'll see that what this movie is REALLY about is Tom Cruise, not the warrior caste of old Japan.  It's about HIS sufferings, HIS saintly guilt, HIS learning of an alien, old tradition (and HIS subsequent improving of it), HIS romance with the beautiful widows who can't help falling in love with HIM because HE is, after all, Tom Cruise Of The Magnificent Long Hair Blowing In The Wind, and finally HIS moral supremacy over everyone else in the movie.  Armies genuflect to, Emperors and warlords take advice from, HIM.  Or, to sum it all up in a line:  'SHOW ME THE MONEY!!!'",3,7,15,6 December 2003
Reservoir Dogs," Bold debut.
","Halfway through this decade of the new millennium, it might not be a bad idea to go back in time to the Tarantino Decade and weigh in on his debut, *Reservoir Dogs*. A meaningless title, by the way, but it sounds cool -- which can suffice as a succinct summing-up of Tarantino's entire approach to film-making. On the one hand, a true cinephile can hardly despise *Reservoir Dogs*, as it pays fond homage to some pretty great films -- indeed, part of the fun of watching it is calling out your favorite film reference (the most meaty being the torture scene, cribbed -- with updated violence -- from Joseph L. Lewis' *The Big Combo* from 1955). On the other hand, a true cinephile can get pretty irritated with Tarantino for building an entire movie, and indeed an entire CAREER, out of a series of fond homages. Yes, it really is a case of the geek at your local video rental armed with $1.5 million and a camera or two actually making, like, a real movie and stuff. The precocious talent vies with the annoying mannerisms that once compelled you to beat him up after school back in the 4th grade.Tarantino's biggest claim to originality here (and in his next, more famous, movie) is his willingness to admit the pointlessness of the plot by spending inordinate amounts of time on non-sequitur dialog. The opening riff on the 'meaning' of Madonna's 'Like a Virgin' remains a startling, funny, and somewhat annoying gambit that attempts to establish character, though the director is far more successful with Mr. Pink's (classic Steve Buscemi) philosophical stance on tipping waitresses. The lackadaisical, wandering pop-culture commentary throughout the film certainly adds some precise verisimilitude, even as it obfuscates what is really a much-ado-about-nothing story involving a gangs of criminals knocking over a jewelry store. Tarantino seems to instinctively know that he doesn't have a great plot going on, so he tries to distract us further with a non-linear narrative pertaining to the undercover cop (an unconvincing Tim Roth) who has infiltrated the crew. Tarantino commits a huge plot gaffe by having his criminals eat in a diner dressed in the very conspicuous clothes -- black suits & ties with white shirts -- they'll later wear while robbing the jewelry store. (This is a case where an 'homage' undercuts the legitimacy of the story.) There's also the lack of sureness about camera placement that you'd expect from a first-timer: the camera tends to wander off for no particular reason, or to sit about a million miles away from the action or a character without adding any necessary ancillary details.The best acting job in the film is delivered by a fellow named Kirk Baltz, who plays an LAPD beat cop who has been kidnapped by Michael Madsen's Mr. Blonde during the bloody aftermath of the heist and is taken to the thieves' warehouse-hideout. Mr. Baltz adds some shocking humanity to the proceedings: when he tells the sadistic Mr. Blonde that he has a kid (an improvised piece of dialog, according to IMDb's trivia-sheet), the stakes are definitely raised. The rest of his performance is a disturbing delineation of a man being tortured. Meanwhile, Madsen's character tells Baltz, 'I don't really care what you tell me -- I've heard it all before. I'm not torturing you to get information; I'm torturing you because it amuses me to torture a cop.' These frightening moments, played over the pleasant nonsense of Stealers Wheel's 'Stuck in the Middle with You', make *Reservoir Dogs* seem strangely up-to-the-minute in ways Tarantino had never envisioned. This movie has suddenly become mandatory viewing for those who subscribe to the notion that our current 'enemies' are having a gay old time down there in Gitmo.As for the rest it, Harvey Keitel and Lawrence Tiereny add much-needed heft and legitimacy to a movie that desperately needs it. I also liked all the blood in the film -- movie violence is too often sanitary; Tarantino makes it disturbingly and copiously wet. What WASN'T required, however, was the constant use of the 'N-word' by the characters. Perhaps this can be argued as being realistic palaver, given the milieu, but I get the feeling Tarantino is merely trying to add a little extra shock-value, here. Or perhaps he feels that a lifelong obsession with Pam Greer gives him the credentials to use that word with impunity. Well, it doesn't.For the under-25's, I strongly recommend *Reservoir Dogs* -- see what the fuss was all about. For those of us who were there the first time, a solid 5 stars out of 10, modified by the sad knowledge that Quentin eventually grew up to make bad kung-fu movies.",5,2,6,26 June 2005
Eyes Wide Shut," Moldy. Very moldy.
","Just the other night, I saw this movie again on HBO, which has been re-running it for some inexplicable reason. My dislike of it hasn't changed in the 5 intervening years since I first saw it. Although it's not quite the UNMITIGATED disaster some claim, *Eyes Wide Shut* is still pretty ludicrous: there will be no later revising-upward of critical opinion, a la*2001: A Space Odyssey*. It will rather be remembered for more morbid reasons; to wit, for killing Kubrick and sundering the marriage of Tom Cruise and Nicole Kidman.For the real-life peripherals surrounding the movie were more interesting than the movie itself -- which, I'm sorry to say, is really, really, really old hat for cinephiles. I realize that this film and its director have a huge fan-club, as evidenced by hundreds of glowing -- if naive -- reviews on this website, but please spare me the lectures that my dislike of the film indicates that I 'just don't get it'. No, YOU don't get it. *Eyes Wide Shut* is 'art-house cinema' for the lazy people, for the people who can't be bothered to force themselves to watch all those subtitled foreign movies from several decades ago that have already, and AMPLY, covered this same material. Doubtless, these same lazy people haven't bothered to read much Schnitzler or even Freud, for that matter. And thus, they're not bored to death by *Eyes Wide Shut*. They see 'genius', while I'm looking at the same old thing. I dunno, but from where I sit, Schnitzler's psycho-sexual theories, while provocative in the mid-Twenties when he wrote the story on which this film is based, are anachronisms in today's culture that boasts of an 50%+ divorce rate. And so what's the result of Kubrick's unwieldy update of 1920's-Vienna to 1999-New York City? Total absurdity, when we realize that Tom Cruise's character, Bill 'I'm-A-Doctor' Harford, is actually amazed that his wife once had a sexual fantasy involving a Naval officer. The whole ludicrous situation is laid out in a ludicrous scene, in which we also learn that Nicole Kidman is so unsatisfied as a wife that a mere GLANCE from the Navy guy would've caused her to abandon her husband and young daughter. I don't know any women who would behave in such a way. (I've only read them in Freud.)This all drives poor Dr. Harford quite mad (dear God, perhaps she even had sexual partners BEFORE I EVEN MET HER!), and he hits the street (an unrecognizable New York City -- the movie was filmed, obviously, in London), looking for a good time. Or something. I guess the idea here is revenge against his wife's dirty, dirty thoughts. Or something. Without belaboring the plot-points, let's just say that he ends up visiting hookers, nubile daughters of haberdashers, among others, but Kubrick doesn't permit our hero(TOM CRUISE, okay?) to actually score. But then, the whole silly thing is unlikely in the first place. Eventually the movie gets to its centerpiece: a campy orgy straight out of a De Sade spoof, with waving incense, chants, creepy electro-organ music, and hundreds of interchangeable naked girls wearing only high-heels and really cool Venetian masks. We are, I believe, meant to nod wisely at Kubrick's 'commentary' concerning the impersonality of sex outside the sacred marriage bond. *Eyes Wide Shut*, in others words, is a movie made by a happily married man of 4 decades.By the time we get to the orgy, the bored cinephile's only interest is considering how much better Fellini would've done this sort of thing. After all, Fellini, though sloppy, was a true surrealist . . . and along those lines, Bunuel would've made a sheer masterpiece of this movie. But Kubrick was inspired, so many years ago, by the dour Antonioni: they each certainly had their share of bourgeois baggage to bring to their work. The point being, this is a movie without any heat, without any fun. The focus is on the backlash of erotic freedom, with the supposed irony of our hero's not being able to actually enjoy any of that freedom during the course of the film. Some here have found this to be profound, and perhaps it would've seemed more profound to me if this film had been a period piece set in, say, the 1800's -- a time in which sexual autonomy was strictly a deeply private idea to be smothered in guilt and the flames of Hell. But in 1999's New York, it's a weird and ultimately pointless anachronism. And sadly it's not even redeemed with the usual photographic brilliance one expects from Kubrick: the picture is grainy, gritty, and even glaring (you keep having this urge to turn down either your color or the contrast on your TV set), overly schematic in terms of 'color-coding' (blue lighting indicates chasteness; red lighting indicates erotic danger). Indeed, the whole movie is full of shallow symbols a la the lighting -- the perfect movie, in other words, for film grads writing their thesis. What a bore.I'll refrain from adding in-depth to the countless comments about the inanity of the dialogue and the tepidness of the performances. I'll only say this much: not much of a surprise here, given the director's track record with bad 'star' performances in favor of quirky minor players who enliven things a bit in his movies. Needless to say, these bit parts by talented character actors add just about the only enjoyable elements to a sad last at-bat from Stanley Kubrick.",3,2,4,5 July 2004
War of the Worlds," The quintessential post-9/11 blockbuster.
","50 years hence, film-studies essays will cite Spielberg's *War of the Worlds* as the movie best reflecting the prevailing mood of post-9/11 America; Spielberg ensures this with his 'authoritative' visual symbols and direct references to the real-life disaster ('Is it the terrorists?' Tom Cruise's teenage son asks early in the proceedings). But we've come to expect this from Sir Steven, who apparently feels that any Major Event or any Major Issue has not been fully documented until he makes some self-important summarization of said Event or Issue. Earlier in his career, he was more prone to telling original stories that were INFLUENCED by the stuff he loved as a kid, such as sci-fi monster movies and adventure serials. But these days, his ego has clearly grown to such proportions that even his beloved original inspirations, such as, well, the 1953 movie version of *The War of the Worlds*, don't seem good enough for him. He must make the AUTHORITATIVE version. The Spielberg Imprimatur of Approval.The 9/11 references get cloying very quickly: the hero covered in ash while dodging the marauding tripod that has been incinerating panicked people with a laser beam; the silent cascade of discarded clothes falling from the sky; Tim Robbins, in a role he must have relished, mouthing Bushian tough-talk about taking the fight to the aliens. But damn, Spielberg sure makes it all LOOK magnificent, doesn't he? This is his best picture since *Saving Private Ryan*. The gigantic tripods, first of all, are an absolute triumph, almost entirely free of the fake sheen and unnatural movements of CGI creations. Lovingly sticking to Wells' original vision, Spielberg insists on maintaining their rather low-tech, 1898-imagined grandeur. Their fog-horn blasts (usually preceding some act of devastation or other) are memorably chilling. Several set-pieces are very well done, particularly the lightning strikes early on that announce the aliens' arrival, followed by the first tripod erupting from a busy street. And Spielberg has always had an uncanny knack for the offhand scene that generates acute psychological disturbance, such as the scene where Cruise's little girl (Dakota Fanning, in another unnatural 'child-actor' performance indicating too many acting classes) takes a bathroom break in the woods by a river. Suddenly, a dead body floats downstream. And then another. And then a small town's worth of them. From idyllic to ghastly in a moment: Spielberg remains a talented showman.He also remains an egregious sentimentalist, troweling on the unnecessary histrionics. For example, there was no good reason for Cruise's teenage son to be separated from the rest of his family. Bet on it, a sappy denouement will be forthcoming. If the point was to focus on the deadbeat dad's wobbly competence in terms of keeping his little girl safe by putting them in close quarters with the psycho Robbins character, then the teenager should have been written out of the story entirely. (Besides, it's too unnerving to see a movie in which Tom Cruise, Mr. Risky Business, is old enough to have a kid in high school! Rust never sleeps, eh, my fellow GenXers?) There are also curious lapses in simple logic, despite all the mind-blowing visuals and suspenseful situations. Why, for instance, does a cell-phone camera work early in the film, after it has been established that the aliens have managed to short-circuit all electrical and even magnetic devices (including wristwatches)? When Cruise gets his kids to his ex-wife's house from his own place, he complains that the teenager brought only salad dressing and hot sauce for their provisions (Dad is a TV-dinner kind of guy, obviously) . . . but why don't they simply open the ex-wife's refrigerator? And don't get me started on how thousands of tripods could lie buried in the earth for a million years without detection . . . or how supposedly brainy aliens would not have long ago figured out that our filthy, bacterial planet might possibly kill them. (The latter blunder is Wells' boo-boo, to be sure.)Well. Despite all this, there IS something to be said for a movie that cost $185 million dollars that also dares to focus its energies on one family's story so as to demonstrate a general story about the end of the world as we know it. The movie, in other words, has the sense to avoid being just an empty spectacle: the lives of people we come to know are actually at stake. Spielberg is eminently commonsensical when it comes to the basic narrative, even as it never occurs to him that a middle-class woman's refrigerator will likely have some food in it.And on that six-of-one-half-dozen-of-the-other note, I'm giving *War of the Worlds* 5 stars out of 10.",5,0,2,13 July 2005
Wedding Crashers," 'We're not so young anymore . . . '
",". . . Thus muses Owen Wilson to his pal Vince Vaughn in their new movie, *Wedding Crashers*. To which I say: Oh yeah? -- then act like it! But to expect maturity from the likes of Owen Wilson and Vince Vaughn would be pointless, considering that both of them have not exactly behaved like adults in any of their previous films. (Well O.K., Wilson was interesting in Wes Anderson's *Bottle Rocket*, and Vaughn had a pretty good part as a creepy step-dad in that Travolta vehicle from several years ago, but 1 out of, like, 20 for each actor is a lousy scorecard.)Let it be said at once that Generation X is aptly named. If Wilson and Vaughn are the best comedy-team my generation can come up with, then we rightly deserve to be nameless. These guys make one long for Martin and Lewis (this is not meant to be complimentary). I spent a good portion of the movie wondering about the state of Wilson's hair: what's up with that, anyway? Why does he persist in looking like a late-Seventies stoner in movie after movie after movie? Is it supposed to be his 'trademark', or something? As for his pal Vaughn, he seems to be literally EATING in every scene of this film, and boy, it shows: this is one individual who is, to a painfully obvious degree, bloated with the corrupting amenities of easy living (i.e., the typical life of an undisciplined Hollywood star). He has become a fat oaf who turns in lazy, blubbery performances. Why is this guy a star, again? Was it that whole 'you're money' thing?Screw these guys and their lousy films. I mean, really. (I was dragged to see *Wedding Crashers*; I certainly didn't seek it out.) What kills me is that I kept reading all these laudatory reviews -- from professional movie critics who are doubtless GenXers themselves -- about this movie's 'sharp, edgy wit' before I actually saw the damned thing. This is merely a case of the tribe protecting its own. Hey look, if your idea of sharp, edgy wit includes the spectacle of Vince Vaughn getting yerked off under a dinner table, then you'll love *Wedding Crashers*. And you'll die laughing when Jane Seymour gets her vanilla-pudding-bags squeezed by Owen Wilson. If those bits don't it for you, perhaps the repugnant wisecracks about Eleanor Roosevelt's sexuality (!) will tickle your ribs. Wow, what a scream.And why wasn't I surprised to see A Certain Former SNL Alumnus make a boorish, unfunny cameo at the end of the movie? (Hint: he's the one who screams a lot, which, I am told, is supposed to be hilarious.) Look, people: it's time to declare a moratorium on the Wilson/Vaughn/Stiller/Ferrell/Rudd Nexus of Bad Comedy. Who's with me? The current going-rate of 3 comedies per year featuring any or all of the above-mentioned performers is literally destroying American civilization. It must be stopped.1 star out of 10.",1,29,61,20 July 2005
Bram Stoker's Dracula," Coppola's pastiche.
","I see that IMDb calls this movie *Dracula*. In my day, it was known as *BRAM STOKER'S Dracula*. Perhaps Stoker's estate litigated at some point during the past 13 years? -- for this movie certainly isn't Bram Stoker's *Dracula*. It is entirely Francis Ford Coppola's *Dracula*. I mean, I commend Coppola on assigning the correct names to the two main heroines (Mina Murray and Lucy Westenra), which, in the history of film adaptations of this novel, is oddly a first . . . but come on! No adaptation in which the Count is the main character can rightly be called *Bram Stoker's Dracula*.I also don't recall the scene in the book where Dracula appears in a red satin long-trained kimono. Between that attire, the white grease-paint on the face, and the ornate hairdo that includes a complicated braid topped off with what can only be described as a derrière-shaped basket on Gary Oldman's skull, this Dracula resembles nothing so much as an aging geisha. (Ill-advisedly, Coppola hired a Japanese costumer named Eiko Ishioka to handle the wardrobe. The story takes place in TRANSYLVANIA and ENGLAND, Francis!) Without belaboring the plot's particularities, let it be said that Coppola basically takes the easy way out and turns the thing into a Harlequin romance. 'I've crossed oceans of time to find you,' murmurs our Undead hero, as he gazes into the vacuity of Winona Ryder's eyes.The movie DOES start out promisingly. We get some back-story on the vampire: Coppola and the film's writers go Stoker one step further and explicitly conflate the fictional Count with the Middle Ages ruler Vlad Tepes ('The Impaler'), who terrorized much of eastern Europe in the 15th century. (Strangely, Stoker had sort of dodged Dracula's 'true' identity in the novel.) Coppola and cameraman Michael Ballhaus have great fun with the mise-en-scene for the prologue sequence: silhouetted soldiers, moving stiffly in a deliberately stylized way, spear one another in the foreground of a hellish red sunset. Later in the movie, Coppola will reference this bit again at a 'cinematograph', in which the dark soldiers -- appearing on the screens presumably because Dracula happens to be there -- become like little marionettes ineptly trying to stab each other. The visual motif here is obviously an homage to a famous bit in Dreyer's *Vampyr*. Neat-o. But this sort of thing ends up being the main problem with the movie: much of the visual references are inside jokes appealing mainly to cinephiles (there is, for instance, a torch-holder on a wall in Drac's castle that is shaped like a human arm, a la Cocteau's *Beauty and the Beast*). Almost every scene ends in a silent-era style 'iris dissolve'. The lurid color-palette is an homage to the look of the old Hammer Studio horror films. All the heavy feminine panting and moaning would fit just as well in a Dario Argento movie. The true buff will also notice the photographic similarities to John Boorman's visually sublime *Exorcist II: The Heretic*, particularly during the climax when the heroes race against the sunset to catch up with Dracula. I mean, so on and so forth, for more than 2 hours. However, what the average horror fan -- or Dracula fan -- will get out of all this remains unclear.In any case, Coppola isn't content with merely referencing film-work from the past; he feels he must OUTDO them, pointlessly laying on the undiluted fruit-punch blood (smite a stone cross with a sword in this movie, and the stone gushes blood), the hallucinogenic phantasmagoria, the overall hysteria. The movie is all spectacle -- no scares.One can't finish a review of this movie without mentioning the acting. Gary Oldman is in Method Mode, over-earnestly delivering his tone-perfect Romanian accent. He sounds as if his mouth is full of marbles -- he is, for the most part, incomprehensible. Others here have mentioned the inadequacy of Winona Ryder and Keanu Reeves -- wait till you hear Reeves say the phrase 'If I may inquire . . .', or, even better, the place-name 'Bukovina' (!) in a 'British' accent. PRICELESS. The worst of the bunch, however, is Anthony Hopkins, but this is probably because the writers tried to make Van Helsing a funny character. Didn't work, guys.3 stars out of 10, primarily for not being boring.",3,14,27,17 February 2005
Hitch," My mystification continues.
","No, *Hitch* is decidedly NOT a romantic-comedy about bilious (and bibulous) former-Leftist-pundit-turned-reactionary-pundit Christopher Hitchens, though it sure would've made for a funnier movie. A dumpy little Englishman, teeth stained black from cigarettes and Guinness, barking out advice -- and acerbic political commentary -- to lovelorn men: 'Look into her EYES when you speak to her, you nutter! And remember: calling someone a 'neo-conservative' makes you a de facto anti-Semite! Can't you get anything straight, you liberal pantywaist?'Oh well. Instead, we get Will Smith, whose continuing success remains a mystery to me, at least. I am apparently alone in this regard. Smith is the most powerful man in Hollywood as of this writing: Americans just can't help throwing their money at him. I, on the other hand, find his smugness insufferable, unmitigated by a scene here (spoiled by the trailer) where he suffers a drastic allergic reaction to seafood. We know Smith will bounce back to his bland, over-muscled good looks, because there's a fat sit-com actor (Kevin James) on hand making a fool of himself. We're supposed to laugh hysterically whenever the slob starts dancing like a jackass (cue 'Everybody Dance Now!' by CC Music Factory), but why would a straight-arrow accountant behave in such a way? I've worked with several straight-arrow accountants for years, and I can tell you that if, in Norman Mailer's memorable phrase, 'tough guys don't dance', neither do straight-arrow accountants. Am I taking all this too seriously? Or -- and here's a daring thought -- perhaps the writers couldn't conceive a logically-drawn character to save their lives?Speaking of the writers, they come up with a lousy idea for Smith's love interest: a writer for a tabloid (Eva Mendes). Since when do tabloid creeps deserve love? What universe am I in, anyway? -- everyone here at IMDb is actually gushing over this tripe. Either you all need to raise the bar, in terms of entertainment value for your buck, or I'm just a skunk at the garden party. (Me, and about 150 million other long-suffering boyfriends and husbands.) In any case, if I may imitate Smith's Hitch and offer my male readers some smooth advice: when you're dragged to see *Hitch*, say to your Better Half, 'Hey, that was pretty good' after the movie is over. Don't be overenthusiastic; don't rave about it -- she'll know you're lying to her. Praise it in a lightly surprised way, as if the movie was better than you expected and wasn't the agonizing time-waster that it actually was. But what am I saying, eh, fellas? -- we dudes know all the moves. 1 star out of 10.",1,16,40,19 February 2005
Ray," Hit the road, Hack.
","By-the-numbers, Oscar-hungry biopic about the late, great singer Ray Charles. There is one -- exactly one -- great scene in *Ray*. It occurs during a flashback to Charles' youth, after the boy become completely blind. Running into the sharecropper house which he shares with his mother, he trips over a chair and sprawls on the floor. He cries out for his mother; she, in keeping with her philosophy that a person should 'stand on their own two feet', observes silently and pensively from the kitchen, waiting to see if the boy can fall back on his own resources. The boy proves to be up to the challenge, using his ears and memory to locate a kettle on a stove, a nearby fire-pit, the grass blowing in the wind outside of a window, the scuttling of a cricket across the plank-board floor.The movie pauses, here; it expands; it breathes -- even if for only 40 seconds. The scene is a much-needed respite from Taylor Hackford's otherwise noisy film. By 'noisy' I'm not referring to the music, which is, of course, excellent. I AM referring to the sound effects (big BOOMS! preceding yet another flashback) and the inane dialog ('I'm speaking to you as a FRIEND, Ray,' etc.). On the visual side, Hackford is equally and pointlessly flashy: sepia-colored filters over the camera lenses during the flashbacks; whirling-dervish 360s from the camera-crane, etc. etc. All the modern amenities. What a horrible cinematic style is displayed in *Ray*! -- a style all-too-common in wanna-be 'important' movies from the past decade or so (Scorsese's *Aviator* is stylistically very similar to this movie). These gimmicks are employed to obfuscate the cliché-ridden screenplay. Some of us won't be fooled.Some of us also are not quite prepared to accept Jamie Foxx's performance as anything more than superb mimicry. Granted, Foxx eerily resembles Ray Charles: he walks like Charles, talks like Charles, and even twitches like Charles. Foxx's imitation of the singer during live performance is technically perfect. I'm not begrudging Mr. Foxx his Oscar; he deserved it. (It was a pretty weak field this year, anyway.) But one wonders if Foxx really UNDERSTANDS Charles. The actor does achieve one great moment when he insists on trying out the smack that his band-mates are shooting up: he registers, if only for a brief moment, a disgust at the unfairness of being blind and a life of darkness. The movie seems to want to dramatize the struggle within Charles between the bright salvation of music and the oblivion of heroin, with his blindness as the battleground between those two compulsions. But the damn movie just won't take the time: it bounces along from triumph to triumph, never really pausing for any insight into the man. One has to STRETCH to find the dramatic tension; one must supply the drama FOR the movie. One must, in other words, imagine a better movie than this one.In its rush toward a glorious conclusion, *Ray* introduces, then dodges, several excellent ideas for a movie: his early days on the 'Chitlin Circuit'; his bold musical innovations for the Atlantic label; the problem of his addiction to heroin; the inevitable artistic compromises attendant upon overwhelming success; the man's importance to the Civil Rights struggle (touched on in the movie for, oh, about 3 minutes of screen-time), and much more. The filmmakers are too lazy to focus on any one of these elements. Two-and-a-half hours of watching a man overcome one adversity after another may make us feel good, but such a movie is not necessarily a grand work of art. This sort of approach certainly provides no deeper insight into the film's subject -- and shouldn't insight be the real goal of a movie like this?

The Terminal," Gee whiz, it's Spielberg's worst movie yet!
","Although I've never much liked Steven Spielberg's films  (*Jaws*  being the sole exception), I've never confused my dislike with his ability to please a crowd.  The man is undoubtedly a showman . . . I suppose my quarrel is with what he shows us.  Even while despising his sentimentality, I've always grudgingly admired his sheer filmmaking competence.  In other words, I would never give his movies a 1/10 rating.Until now, until  *The Terminal*.  This is, without equivocation, the worst film of his career.  It has absolutely nothing to recommend it.  They should pay US to see it, really.  First of all, the movie has to set some kind of record for relentless product-placement.  You thought Hanks shilling for FedEx and Wilson Sporting Goods was tacky in  *Castaway*?  Wait till you see him scarf down his seventh Burger King greaseball sandwich in  *The Terminal*.  Wait till you watch him wander aimlessly, over and over, past Sbarro, Starbucks, Hugo Boss Outlets . . . but this is a hint to stop, because I don't want to be the pot calling the kettle black.  Basically, Spielberg & the Gang at Dreamworks came up with the most brilliant 'synergy'  concept yet:  base the story on some nut who was stranded in Charles de Gaulle Intl. Airport in France, make up a bunch of  'dramatic, funny'  stuff about this character, and bingo! -- you got over 2 hours of CONTINUOUS ADVERTISING.  One retail outlet after another, panning slowly on the big screen.  Hanks can't escape the Terminal, and neither can the targeted audience!  It sometimes helps, when viewing a film, to know the reasons WHY a film gets made:  please remember that DreamWorks is having a bit of financial trouble, lately.  Not a LOT, but some.  The TV shows never materialized; the music-unit was sold off to some other conglomerate; and, worst of all, their movies have been stinking up the box-office for the past couple of years.  In fact, their last major  'hit'  (if we must call it that)  was  *Gladiator*.Hence, *The Terminal*  gets dumped on an unsuspecting public.  Make no mistake, kids:  Spielberg did this hack-job with the hopes of covering his own studio's backside.  It is no coincidence that the only element in the film which looks as if any effort was applied is the set of the airport terminal itself.  Indeed, it's an astounding set, the best of its kind ever built, and deserves an Oscar . . . but remember the set's main function:  to hawk Starbucks and the like.  And since this is the movie's main function (with the  'entertainment'  part hopefully taking care of itself under the auspices of popular showmen like Spielberg and Hanks), it should really come as no surpise that the airport-set is awesome.  There's money to be made, and burgers to be sold.As for the other aspects of the movie -- you know, the stuff we usually talk about, like the direction, photography, acting, story, and so on -- only the most pedestrian efforts are exerted from the principals  (Spielberg, Hanks, Zeta-Jones).  In the direction category, you would never guess that Spielberg was behind the wheel.  The story has terrible pace, the camera-work is nondescript  (except when panning slowly across yet another advertiser's logo), and the script is devoid of the  'magical moments'  the director has occasionally pulled off in his other films.  In the acting category, Stanley Tucci tries his damnedest to give an honest performance as the head of security at the terminal, but the script betrays him by making his character, for no clear reason, more villainous as the movie wears on. Tucci's hung out to dry, mouthing dialogue.  As for Hanks and Zeta-Jones: watching them here only made me consider how much I enjoyed them in separate films by the Coen Brothers  (*Intolerable Cruelty*  for Z-J; *The Ladykillers*  for Hanks).  I ended up wishing that I was watching either one of those films again, which, not surprisingly, were directed by artists instead of a huckster.",1,40,83,7 July 2004
The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King," Sweet dreams, everyone.
","Well, it's finally over:  Peter Jackson's adaptation of J. R. R. Tolkien's mediocre epic concludes with  *The Return of the King*, a 3-1/2-hour test of endurance.  How many times can a movie show Elijah Wood's big blue eyes welling up with tragic tears?  how many times do our heroes single-handedly dispatch thousands of evil creatures apiece during big battles?  how many times do we have to endure the jokes from that hairy dwarf?  how many times must Howard Shore's repetitive, sappy score rise to deafening levels whenever a minor character lies in a broken heap on the battlefield?  how many times must director Jackson waste his wide screen photography with gigantic close-ups of the actors  (I haven't seen so many BIG HEADS since the last Academy Awards broadcast)?  how many times must we withstand grand, cartoon-animated armies? . . . and how many more times must we watch plot developments that contain virtually no suspense??  (What -- did you think the Dark Lord would win?  that any of the main characters of the Fellowship would actually die?)Apparently, many MORE times, because this 3-1/2-hour trudge is but the appetizer to the main course of the  'Extended Edition', New Line's continuing money-grab that will reveal perhaps a FIVE-HOUR version of this movie alone.  (Taken all together, *The Lord of the Rings* -- The Extended Version -- approaches the length of 14 hours, give or take.)  Well, as P. T. Barnum once observed, There's a sucker born every minute, and New Line has found the suckers, who are not only willing to pay at the movie theater, but are also only too willing to fork out exorbitant amounts for  'special editions'  of movies that ought to have stood on their own -- AS RELEASED. A simple standard should obtain in a movie theater:  what you're seeing on the screen should be what a director wants you to see.  'Extended-edition DVD's'  don't count, and especially should not be taken in consideration in reviews by either professional critics or by amateur reviewers at places like IMDb.  I can already hear the defenders of the films demur, 'But these movies would've been too long if Jackson didn't cut them into shorter versions!'  But that's precisely my point.  *The Lord of the Rings* remains an unfilmable book:  it's too long; it's too unwieldy.  As far as an adaptation is concerned, none -- not less -- would be more.Which is not to say that there aren't any great filmic moments in *Return of the King*:  the lighting of the watch-fires along the mountain ranges is pure cinema; the entire scene with Frodo and Sam fending off a giant spider in a cobwebby cave is terrific, providing the one suspenseful stretch in the entire movie; and Gollum remains a wonderful creation, a rare successful collaboration of technology and old-fashioned creative virtues.  Taken as a whole, the movie is better than, say, *The Matrix*  or other expensive Hollywood blockbusters of the  'action-adventure'  genre.  But to say so is not to say much.  The occasional high points don't constitute a comprehensive whole, or make Tolkien's saga any less silly.  It's a book about magic rings, wizards, Dark Lords, and dwarfs, for God's sake.  In *Return of the King*, there's a scene in Minas Tirith where the citizens watch a sad parade of soldiers go by:  but it's comical, because everyone looks like refugees from a Renaissance Faire.  It doesn't do to inflate this material to cosmic levels.  Claims that Tolkien's fantasy was the greatest book of the 20th Century truly make my head spin:  what, was  *Ulysses* chopped liver?  What was the second greatest book -- Stephen King's  *The Stand*?Pardon my long-windedness, but the very subject inspires it.  I'll wrap by lamenting that one of the better elements in the first two installments, Christopher Lee as Saruman, was a victim of the cutting room floor.  Even fans of this material might agree with me that any number of the scenes with Frodo and Sam blubbering at each other would've been better replaced with a coda to the Saruman plot-line.  While others may say, 'Well, he'll be in the Extended-Edition version,'  I'm sure that will be cold comfort to Mr. Lee. At least Saruman was a villain we could sink our teeth into:  in *Return*, we must instead settle for that damned Eyeball atop that tower.  Granted, in this film the Eyeball has developed the power to sort of roll about, rather like a lighthouse lamp,  but it's still a pretty lame villain.  Here, perhaps more than anywhere, Jackson reveals the limitations of his source material.  In the book, as I recall, Sauron's Eyeball was really more of a psychological entity.  Grasping for any straw, Jackson has made the Eyeball a concrete reality, so that we would have SOMETHING to identify as a villain.  But don't fret:  Sauron's Nose will doubtless turn up in the Extended Edition.  In the meantime, sweet dreams, everyone.",3,21,50,4 January 2004
Casino," The reward for those who overrated *GoodFellas*.
","This might not be Scorsese's worst movie  (that would be  *Kundun*), but it may be his most negligible movie, given that it's very much a remake of the director's own  *GoodFellas*, which was a pretty empty affair to begin with. That makes  *Casino*  extremely empty -- call it a black hole.Once again, we get the nonstop soundtrack comprised of Bobby Vinton-esque oldies and 70's album rock.  Oh, there's snatches of grand opera, too, especially when little Joe Pesci is killing someone.  The point of all this music, presumably, is to punctuate with either emphasis or irony what we're seeing on the screen . . . an easy indicator that the director doesn't have much to show us.  And in case that wasn't enough, Scorsese tries to fill the gaps with nonstop -- and I mean, NONSTOP -- voice-over narration.  This may be one of the few movies a blind person could watch without missing anything.  As cinema is a visual medium, I'm obviously not being complimentary to Mr. Scorsese, here.Scorsese keeps trying to outdo his earlier film with MORE narration, more walk-on characters, more gruesome violence  (one guy gets his head squeezed in a vice), more domestic squabbling, more more more.  But it's all meaningless, quite apart from being as boring as hell.  What we have here is the story of small player from the Kansas City mob  (Robert DeNiro)  who wants to be a big player.  His bosses send him to Vegas, where he feels he has a real opportunity to not only be a player, but to be  'legit'  in the bargain by becoming a real casino boss.In the meantime, he's got to deal with an old associate, the violent Joe Pesci, and a whory wife  (Sharon Stone)  who's addicted to drugs and, most laughably, a mullet-haired James Woods.  I can buy the whole wife thing, maybe . . . men WILL do stupid things when it comes to blondes.  But I absolutely cannot take Joe Pesci seriously as a fearsome, bloodthirsty mobster who blows into Vegas looking for his own action.  De Niro and Pesci should've portrayed each other's roles.  But what do I know.",1,31,71,21 November 2003
Ran," Kurosawa communes with Shakespeare, again . . .
",". . . with somewhat less scintillating results than the first time, *Throne of Blood* from the late Fifties. Of course, some of this has to do with the obvious fact that 'Macbeth' is just more amenable to cinema than 'King Lear': the former play is much briefer, more to the point, and has more visual possibilities. 'Lear' also contains reams of philosophical commentary on Man's place in the cosmos which, I fear, gets lost in translation to any other language, let alone Japanese. I'll expand on that a little later.But first, praise is due. If the poetic meat of 'Lear' necessarily must be excised from the milieu of 16th-century war-torn Japan, one can still admire Kurosawa for brilliantly adapting the play's plot and characters to their new setting. Obviously, the tired old king of ancient Britain morphs easily into a tired old samurai overlord (Tatsuya Nakadai as 'Hidetora'). But instead of the three daughters, we get three sons. As in Shakespeare, the elder two are bad, the younger good: the former use language to hide their true natures from the king; the latter's inability to use language to SHOW his true, good nature causes his precipitate banishment from Hidetora's dominions. The good son is accompanied in banishment by loyal samurai Tongo, the equivalent to Kent. The wife of the eldest son, Lady Kaeda (Meiko Harada in the greatest female role in all of Kurosawa), is nominally this movie's version of evil Edmund, but in actuality she is Edmund, Goneril, and Regan all rolled into one silk kimono. Indeed, the 'bad' sons seem unable to commit the vilest crimes without Kaeda's prodding. One scene that demonstrates Kaeda's nastiness with absolutely brilliant economy shows her sobbing on the floor, trying to soften up second son Jiro into marrying her after the eldest son Taro -- her former husband -- has been treacherously killed in battle. With Jiro's back turned, she viciously squashes a moth on the floor without the least interruption in her performance.Minor roles are also transposed: the old samurai has in his service the Japanese equivalent of a court jester, who, as in Shakespeare's play, serves the somewhat tiring function of continually pointing out what a mistake the ruler has made by abdicating and then dividing the kingdom. The good characters Gloucester and Edgar are sort of mixed and matched interchangeably with a brother and sister tag-team of woe: the brother, blinded, is a hermit living in squalor, and the sister is a frightened mouse having fully retreated into Shindo Buddhism. Both of these characters are the damaged results of Hidetora's warlike past, their misfortunes entirely due to their father having been Hidetora's enemy.And this elemental difference in Hidetora's and Lear's back-story is what finally trips up *Ran*, in my judgment. Artists are always attempting to re-write Shakespeare; all fail, even the greatest artists like Akira Kurosawa. Lear was 'more sinned against than sinning'; Hidetora is basically getting his comeuppance for past brutalities. This is perhaps a suitable enough alteration for Eastern sensibilities: a movie that invokes the Great Buddha is bound to find dramatic justice in an old man suffering the retribution of all of his bad karma. But this idea just isn't as bold as Shakespeare's. Lear pays the price for his foibles twenty-fold, and his sad story is really but a small item in a world of chaotic violence in which maliciousness is the one certainty. Life just isn't fair, and karma has nothing to do with it, either way. Kurosawa, despite depicting all manner of barbarities in this film, clearly couldn't stomach Shakespeare's nihilistic vision of the world. In *Ran*, Tongo reprimands the jester for getting angry at the gods, going on to say, 'The gods weep for us'; in 'King Lear', the gods are simply absent. I think Kurosawa lost his nerve. I also think that the Lady Kaeda could have done without the tiresome 'motivation' for her actions. Unalloyed evil was good enough for Goneril and Regan, and, for that matter, Asaji, the Lady Macbeth-figure in Kurosawa's own *Throne of Blood*. Giving Kaeda a revenge motive deprives her of no small amount of force.Of course, the latter quibble can be considered more than adequately compensated for by such scenes as when she requests a henchman to salt the head of the Lady Sue after cutting it off, so that it would keep better in the heat for presentation. And, of course, any other deficiencies *Ran* might have can be relegated to nitpicking when one considers the great siege of the Third Castle in the middle of the film -- the crowning glory of Kurosawa's epic mode. Horrific carnage mounts over a mournful, Mahlerian score (which changes suddenly and explosively into ambient sound when Taro gets shot), finally culminating in one of cinema's greatest moments: a $1.5 million set going up in flames while Nakadai as Hidetora, denied seppuku and now finally mad, parts two armies like some awesome ghost, trudging his way toward oblivion. If Hidetora is sadly denied Lear's articulation, Kurosawa gives him some of the most brilliant visual presentation that a great artist can conjure. As such, comparisons between the actual director (seventy-five during the film's making) and his subject seem notoriously wrongheaded. Kurosawa hadn't abdicated any throne.

Braveheart," Long-winded; simple-minded; ultimately disturbing.
","I had liked Mel Gibson's *Braveheart* a bit better 9 years ago when I first saw it; but that was 9 years ago. 9 more years of experience in both life and movie-watching has revealed to me this film's inadequacies upon a re-viewing on a TV broadcast.Gibson shows no particular talent for framing, camera placement or camera movement. Blocky, centered compositions dominate. Like all amateur directors, Gibson relies on slow-motion to increase the significance or suspense of a scene. There's one particularly egregious sequence in which Gibson's Wallace, returning to a village in which he attacked some English soldiers, SLOWLY approaches some infantry who are ready to take him into custody. One soldier's chain-mailed hand SLOWLY takes hold of the harness of Gibson's horse. Gibson SLOWLY raises his arms above his head. Gibson SLOWLY reaches behind his back for his weapon. Gibson SLOWLY bashes the soldier's head in with the weapon. Look -- this is really incompetent film-making. A good director, in order to increase suspense, would find NARRATIVE solutions to achieve his aim, rather than simply assume that slowing the film's speed to a crawl will put us on the edge of our seats. Slow motion: the hallmark of lazy, unimaginative, and incompetent film-making. *Braveheart* is riddled with it, to the point that the entire film seems to consist of it. Run the film at normal speed, and the movie's no more than 2 hours long . . . and it would also become abundantly clear that there's not much to this simple-minded epic, after all.There's certainly very little complexity here, an unforgivable sin, in my opinion, for a historical epic. We're given to understand that King Edward the First feels that he needs to subjugate Scotland in order to create a united 'Greater Britain' against the competing imperial aims of England's Continental neighbors (particularly France), but why make such a comically satanic figure out of this character? 'My greatness will be better demonstrated when Scotland lies in ashes,' Patrick McGoohan hisses -- all that's missing is the villainous chortle. McGoohan functions as a sort of Evil Stepfather in this castle-and-moat fairy tale. It works both ways, as well: because the English are such slave-masters, any and all terrorist tactics against them by Wallace's army of Highlanders is meant to be applauded. They burn forts, slit throats, lay siege to York ('When we invaded York, you would not support us,' Wallace reprimands a council of Scot nobles), send the head of York's commander, via a basket, to London, trap English soldiers in a wooden hut and burn them alive . . . all for 'freedom'. Gibson and screenwriter Randall Wallace (no relation to the subject of the film, presumably) manage to find nothing contradictory about all of this. Acts of murder are Bad when the English commit them, Good when the Scots commit them. However, perhaps unconsciously realizing the murkiness of this type of morality, they give Wallace an added motivation designed to checkmate those who question if murder is washed clean by patriotism: the English brutally execute Wallace's wife (married to him secretly in order to avoid Longshanks' proclamation of 'prima noctis') on a trumped-up insurrection charge. Therefore, Wallace's butchery is sanctioned by a divine sense of retribution above the laws of men. One unforgivable act makes a thousand revenges forgivable. Such ontological morality is as easy as it is totally insane.It's not Christian, either -- but Gibson has demonstrated with his most recent film, *The Passion of the Christ*, a religiosity that's not merely misguided, but mired in ignorance and neuroses. He conflates his own masochistic impulses with that of Christianity itself. In *Braveheart*, we get a foreshadowing of his *Passion* in the sequence in which he's tied to a wooded cross and tortured. (Though the cross is laid out horizontally, we get the heavy-handed point.) In Gibson's theology, spiritual transcendence is achieved when your body is getting cut open. 'FREEDOM' is the triumphant battle-cry after your entrails are piled in a steaming heap. Only through pain suffered in its extreme can true victory, and therefore happiness and peace, be found. Watching one man's pathologies play out in such a public manner -- e.g., a major motion picture -- is a merely pathetic spectacle; more alarming than that is the ecstatic response this sort of thing has received from the movie-going public. Both *Braveheart* and *The Passion* were big box-office hits.Well, the battle scenes are still pretty exciting, and have been justly imitated over the past decade. For that reason, and that reason alone, *Braveheart* earns a generous 3 stars out of 10.",3,25,53,14 November 2004
Goodfellas," May I differ?
","Overrated in 1990, *Goodfellas* has grown even more overrated with the passage of 15 years. It's based on the -- I daresay -- untrustworthy recollections of a half-Irish, half-Sicilian mobster-turned-informant who recently, I am reliably informed, appears as an addled, half-witted guest on 'The Howard Stern Show'. The narrative arc, if one can accurately term it that, spans 30 years, roughly from 1950 to 1980. This, of course, gives Martin Scorsese every incentive to soak the background with dozens of pop-culture tunes ranging from Bobby Vinton to Derek and the Dominoes. His use of the last 3 lilting minutes of 'Layla' as some sort of ironic counterpoint in the extended montage that reveals the corpses of a dozen gruesomely executed mobsters in various places across New York City only underscores his utterly conventional taste in music. One wonders whether Scorsese would've been happier as a Top 40 deejay instead of a filmmaker.His conventionality -- a surprising development, given his success with such Seventies classics as *Mean Streets* and *Taxi Driver*, both infused with his uniquely individual aesthetic -- extends beyond the soundtrack to the actual movie itself. Lovers of this movie will doubtless be distressed to learn that the various stylistic techniques Scorsese uses here -- whip-pans, sudden freezes that supposedly add ironic punctuation to the narrative, even the use of pop music as commentary on a montage -- all derive from French (yes, I said French) auteurs from the New Wave school of the Sixties and Seventies. These same lovers of this movie would probably also consider Orson Welles to be an overrated old fuddy-duddy, but that doesn't stop Scorsese from pointlessly laying on at least two sequences of long tracking-shots through complicated spatial arrangements without cuts, the device Welles perfected if not wholly invented. (An even less impressive feat for Scorsese, who benefits from the technological advance of the Steadicam. Welles did it with old-fashioned cameras on dollies and hydraulic cranes.) I believe that all these borrowings betray Scorsese's fundamental, perhaps unconscious, lack of confidence in the power of his story, here.For the screenplay, let it be said at once, is poorly constructed. The narrative focuses on trivial events, like a gofer getting shot in the foot during a card game or Paul Sorvino slicing garlic to atomic thinness, and then presents the world-famous Lufthansa heist through hearsay. The movie's main character, Ray Liotta as Henry Hill, hears a news report about the heist while in the shower. One may reasonably ask why we're in the shower with Henry when we should be in the getaway car with Robert De Niro's Jimmy Conway and his henchmen. This, of course, leads one to reasonably ask why we're not watching a movie about Jimmy Conway instead of Henry Hill, the latter being, more often than not, on the periphery of the movie's main events. Having Liotta narrate the exciting stuff for us in voice-over is no substitute. Indeed, the movie is cripplingly dependent on voice-over narration, perhaps because Mr. Hill's own story, in and of itself, isn't interesting enough to really warrant a honest-to-goodness movie in the first place. As the movie drones on with Liotta's loquacious narrator ceaselessly filling in the narrative gaps, one suspiciously wonders -- for example -- why Hill and Conway are NOT whacked for bumping off 'made man' Billy Bats, while Joe Pesci's Tommy DOES get whacked. All three men were involved in the killing, yet only Tommy pays the price. Why? Does Conway's and Hill's Irishness serve as a magical force-field? -- I don't get it. Well, I did say at the beginning of this review that Hill was an untrustworthy storyteller. From the evidence, it appears that Hill was quite conversant with his mob boss's cooking techniques (hence all the time wasted on cooking scenes and shots of gorgeously laid-out family feasts) and far less conversant with the important incidents that are the subject of this film. Note too how inconsistently handled Henry's character is throughout the film: one moment he pistol-whips almost to death a sexual predator who messes with his girlfriend, the next he's aghast when some punk kid gets carelessly killed. Hmm -- smells like self-hagiography to me.After an overly-edited, chaotic, 30-minute final act in which a sweaty-faced, puffy-eyed Liotta drives around the suburbs, peering up through his windshield at police helicopters, dropping off hot guns, going to the grocery store, zipping back home to make meatballs (AGAIN with the cooking!), and so forth, he gets pinched for good. Under the umbrella of the Witness Protection program, he finally rats out his mob bosses . . . and it occurs to us that this should have been the focus of the film all along, i.e., the FBI's successful eroding of the criminal code using Witness Protection. But Scorsese crams it in during the last five minutes of this 3-hour movie. A little less time in the kitchen and in the shower, and a little more time getting down to business, might have made this movie pretty great.As it is, the performers give *Goodfellas* undeniable energy, almost mitigating all its flaws. Fans of good New York actors will forgive this movie everything: Liotta, De Niro, Pesci, Sorvino, and Lorraine Bracco do THEIR job, at least. And perhaps this is why the movie is so well-loved. Colorful characters limned by great performances are entertaining. But, in my judgment, the virtues of verisimilitude can't overcome what amounts to a 3-hour-long non-story.3 stars out of 10.",3,81,195,25 November 2005
Cinderella Man," Query to fans of this movie: Shall I tuck you in?
","*Cinderella Man* is the latest entry in what is apparently the newest American cinematic sub-genre: a heroic sports-figure (man or even horse) from the Depression Era, a 'little' guy rising, against all odds, to become the champion of his (or its) given sport. It's sad, but not too terribly surprising, that movies like *Seabiscuit* and *Cinderella Man* are being made these days. When one considers the current political climate, in which, for example, our nation's leaders have apparently endorsed the torturing of our 'enemies', infantilizing sap like this film must seem overwhelmingly attractive to both movie-makers and audiences. When a nation's pop culture is resorting to dewy-eyed, sepia-toned sentimentality for an era 70 years in the past, it not merely indicates an inability to look at our current dilemmas squarely in the face, but it also suggests a cowardly fear of what lies ahead. When great civilizations wax nostalgic for a presumably more 'innocent' past, empires totter. How far we've fallen since *Rocky*! -- a film in which Sylvester Stallone made a country stand up and cheer immediately following the shell-shock from Vietnam and Watergate. Let it be noted that *Rocky* was set in contemporary times, too: Looking Forward, with Defiant Hope.Not so, here. *Cinderella Man* says: Keep Looking Backward, Rube, and Cross Your Fingers! Setting aside the socio-political import of this movie, one has to wonder what sort of mood his countrymen is in that would make them not only want to watch this, but to even like it. Hell, you know the outcome going in! Braddock beats Baer! The End! Feel better now? Take two aspirins and call me in the morning, but first, let me tuck you in your safe, warm, cozy little beds. *Cinderella Man* is the cinematic equivalent of a young children's picture-book, like 'Goodnight Moon', to be read before bed-time. The movie's fans, like sleepy four-year-olds snug in their beds, know exactly how each scene will play out and how the story ends. 'Read it again, Mommy.' Fine for the tykes; embarrassing, however, if you're an adult. How anyone can watch this film without a sense of crushing boredom is quite simply beyond my comprehension.Are we surprised that the movie is directed by Ron Howard -- Mr. *Cocoon*? The usual Howardian sentimentality would be fine if there was anything indicative of an auteur's spirit to go with it. But no, we get every cliché in the book, in terms of both the screenplay itself and the very look of the picture (speckled with grit and leached of color during Braddock's hard-knock moments in his shanty home or at the docks; burnished with a happy sunshine-yellow when things start turning around; drenched with spit- sweat- and blood-spray across the frame during the over-edited boxing fights). There's some terrible dialog, too: at a press conference just before the climactic bout, Howard has Russell Crowe say that he's fighting for 'milk'. Oh Brother! Can you spare a dime? Did Braddock really say this? Probably not, considering the many errors and outright falsehoods, particularly about Max Baer, in this movie that historians have already documented.I'm giving *Cinderella Man* a generous 2 stars out of 10 -- the second star entirely for some nice performances by Russell Crowe (earnest, soulful, really looking the part, and convincingly humble), and by Paul Giamatti as the trainer. NO marks, however, for Craig Bierko's camera-mugging, or for Renee Zellweger's constant sniffling.",2,11,24,8 June 2005
