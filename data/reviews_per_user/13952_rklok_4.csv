3:10 to Yuma," Possibly the dumbest story of all time
","This movie makes me wonder if Hollywood is testing out the masses. 'Lets see how stupid a movie-script we can produce, and still get lots of people to like it?' Well you have to do worse than this. It seems, with a rating of 8.0 after nearly 50k votes here for this movie, that people buy anything nowadays. As long as it has profiled actors, entertaining action and believable costumes.The story of this stupidity of a movie utterly insults my intelligence.I should have understood it from the very beginning, when the bandits are to rob a coach. Instead of lying in ambush, and just shoot the people on the wagon (espescially the ones with a gatling-gun!), they all (with the exception of their bad-ass leader who just hang back (!)) ride head on shooting wildly, not hitting anyone. Several of them gets killed. But hey, they have a sharpshooter in the bushes! He take out one of the two operating the gatling-gun. Then the one left swings the gatling-gun away from the huge targets of horses and riders around the wagon to shoot at the sharpshooter far away! Just ridiculous. And it just get worse and worse throughout the movie, till it explodes in such a stupidity it had me groaning in mental pain when the final scene ended.As another wrote here, western-movies is not about realism. They should not be either. Sure the wild west was a frontier to the wild, with lots of murders and lawlessness, but the gunslingers of modern westerns did not exist as they are portrayed in the movies. They were exaggerated even back then, and the two feathers have now become several hens.And that is the really silly thing about this movie: The seriousness of it. There is not a hint of humor or irony. It seems I am supposed to feel something for the characters, and believe the story.I could fill a book of all the why's in this movie. In the end I just wanted the only believable character, the right hand man of the bad-guys leader, to just kill the leader (who had a change of heart and suddenly became a good guy (please!)), the hero and his son. Because of their stupid actions they all would have deserved it!The only redeeming factor is Ben Foster, playing second in command to the bad-guys. Yes Russel Crowe and Christian Bale do a good job acting as well, its just that their characters actions are totally unbelievable, thus making their performances a waste.2 stars to Ben Fosters portrayal of Charlie Prince.",2,3,8,1 April 2008
The 13th Warrior," Totally unexpected, this was a great movie!
","Don't believe the negative reviews on this one. Its easily the most underrated movie I have come across, and can best be described as a hidden gem for the ones who like historical adventure/action-movies (Braveheart/Gladiator/Kingdom of Heaven/Robin Hood) and fantasy-movies. Others have described it better here on IMDb, so I am just going to say this: It is not a historical correct piece, and do not try to be. It should be viewed as a fantasy, even though the vikings portrayed and their buildings/settlement is the most realistic I have seen in any movie to date.Btw: To all you who like the above-mentioned movies for the big battle-scenes and sword-fighting, don't expect this one to have its major impact in that area (even though it got them). On the other hand this movie portrays a much more realistic take on fighting in pre-medieval times. Instead of having the one super-hero defying all logic, you get a band of fighting comrades which together becomes a fierce force. There is a fantastic cast in this movie, with Banderas, Storh√∏i and Kulich making their characters come truly alive.This is a great adventure of a movie, which should be regarded alongside the other movies I mentioned above.9/10 - Must see for all who like adventure/fantasy",9,101,108,5 May 2008
Sweeney Todd: The Demon Barber of Fleet Street," Just boring
","After reading an article about the movie describing it as a masterpiece, I decided to check this one out. I am not a fan of Burton, and I usually despises musicals so to say I had small expectations is a understatement.But boy what a piece of rubbish this was! It had the great costumes/atmosphere of a dark London in the late 1800's, but that was it.Other than that it was bad singing/music, cartoonish characters, boring story than never make you really interested or exited, blood, blood and more blood. Depp disappointed me hugely in the role as Sweeney Todd, as that could have been a redeeming factor.This movie is just boring and insanely over-hyped.",3,5,10,31 March 2008
Enchanted," Magical movie!
","To think I was to register at IMDb to comment on a Disney-production! And at that, one with music and dancing and all the sweetness only Disney can deliver? But here I am, and I felt compelled to. After watching Enchanted I logged on to IMDb with the thought that THIS movie could not have received any bad reviews. Well, there were 68 negative reviews, and I am wondering what the world is coming to..How can anyone not like this movie? It is a great traditional fairy-tale story mixed into a funny romantic comedy for the whole family!Others have described it in so many good ways so I'm just going to say this: I am as far away from the intended audience as you can get to this movie. I mostly like gritty, realistic movies where romance usually ruins it all for me. But this IS a fairy-tale/romantic comedy. And on those premises this movie is an instant classic for me.I think beside the great humour, music, story, actors and special effects, this is a movie that truly awaken the child in you.",8,3,4,30 March 2008
