Resident Evil: Afterlife," 'Afterlife' isn't worth $hit
","The intro 'action' scene I saw through my moronic '3D' glasses wasn't worth the plastic they were made from, never mind the idiotic and contrived script vomited from the mouths of the 'actors.' I almost 'LOL-ed' at the poor action-scene choreography... I did 'LOL' at the sad script Millia Jovovich was forced to puke forth in the first few scenes... and the whole movie for that matter. Overall, the characters were very 'cliche.' Overall I give this film a 1 out of 10 because it is an insult to any movie-goer, be s/he an action, horror, drama, or comedy buff. Resident Evil:Afterlife has no place in US filmography... even in its' Halls of Shame. I have nothing else to say other than: avoid this movie at all costs unless you can see it for free and are bored as hell.",1,7,16,12 September 2010
