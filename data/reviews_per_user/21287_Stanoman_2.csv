Ghost," Sappy, silly, but a little romantic
","It's always fun to go back to movies that were popular in their day to see if they still hold up to criticism many years later.Pretty Woman - now that's a classic love story. Love Story - another classic love story. Those films have stood the test of time and faired quite well.This movie, however, is so sappy, melodramatic, poorly-acted... it's just pathetic. If there was an Oscar for the most crying by a lead actress, Demi Moore would get it for sure.The special effects are a joke - even for 15 years ago. The acting is downright pathetic: Patrick Swayze, as washed-up as they come. Demi Moore, never really been much more than a pretty face. Whoopi, other than Star Trek: The Next Generation - has made zero good decisions since 'The Color Purple'.Back then (in 1990), I would have said, give it a shot. Now, I'd say, don't waste your time on this drivel.3/10 stars.",3,7,19,25 April 2005
Sin City," Wow!
","I don't say 'Wow' about a movie very often. But I was particularly blown away by this movie. I'm a fan of the director and literally every bit of this incredible cast. And what a cast it is! Robert Rodriguez put together an incredible piece of art. I'm not a comic book reader and had never heard of Sin City, but I am a fan of great film making. From the writing, to the score, to the acting and straightforward and appropriately cheesy dialogue - this movie kept me fully engrossed for its entirety. A real escape into a brilliantly-created world of kick-ass film noir.On a bit of a side note, I laughed hysterically when Benicio Del Toro used his teeth to pry the fingers from his gun... don't want to ruin anything for anyone, but it was unbelievably and original storytelling.Give this movie a chance, you'll be glad you did.",10,0,1,25 August 2005
