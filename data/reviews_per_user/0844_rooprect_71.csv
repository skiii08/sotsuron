The Double Life of Véronique," Stick it back in the oven. It ain't done yet.
","I'm a big fan of Kieslowski's work, but I'm not blind to the fact that even the masters can churn out an occasional dud. This is like Kieslowski's unfinished symphony. It had the most promising storyline of all his efforts, but he went nowhere with it. Rather than developing what could have been a real mindbender, he chose to focus on symbolism, mood and camera technique.Film school students should love this flick. He does tons of wacky things like filming through a glass ball, through a man's spectacles (twice), through a distorted train window and, of course, using the trademark Kieslowksi microscopic close up on a cup of tea (ok, in 'Blue' it was a cup of coffee, and in Dekalog 2 it was a glass of water...same friggin thing). But to people who don't go ga-ga over that sort of stuff--to people who are searching for good old fashioned literary substance--this'll be a somewhat aggravating experience.If you like impressionistic movies like Fellini's AMACORD or Tarkovsky's ZERKALO, then you'll probably love this film. But if you prefer the clearly-defined work of Kurosawa, Bresson or Kubrick, then I'd advise you to pass on this and check out Kieslowski's other works instead. Try the Three Colours trilogy & the Dekalog series...between those, there's 15 hours of good, classic Kieslowski to pique your brain.",5,11,24,29 November 2006
Black Swan," Somebody please buy this girl a pair of NAIL CLIPPERS!
","I guarantee, at least twice during the movie you will find yourself screaming the line in the title of this review. Oddly enough, it perfectly sums up the effect the movie had on me.The movie is powerful, without a doubt. It is very effective in unsettling ways. At times it will make you cringe & squirm, and at times it will challenge you like a good murder mystery. Like all Aranofsky films I've seen, it will warp your perspective and take you to an unreal, shadowy world where nothing seems quite right. And, if you don't already have em, it will make you buy a pair of nail clippers.Taken on the surface as a straightforward story, the film is good. But if you read between the lines and consider unspoken issues of mental illness, personality disorder, anorexia, bulimia, incest, child abuse, etc, then the film is great. If you haven't guessed, it takes you to some dark places.'Black Swan' is a shadowy, perverse thriller that reminds me of the works of David Lynch (Mulholland Drive, Wild at Heart, Blue Velvet) except that director Aranofsky has a more lucid approach than Lynch has, in my opinion. Aranofsky's films seem more deliberate and mathematical, whereas Lynch is more arbitrary and sometimes just plain weird.My only real criticism of 'Black Swan' is that certain things occur that are so far-fetched it may be hard to swallow. But if you accept this as a mindbending dark fantasy, I guess anything goes. To properly enjoy this film you can't be too critical of small details. Instead you should just go along for the ride, always thinking of the significance and symbolism of events, rather than cause. I guess not everyone has a pair of nail clippers... Ugh watch the movie and you'll know what I mean.",Null,0,0,4 January 2013
Marie Antoinette," Geez, I wish someone had told me this before I saw it...
","Something you should know about this movie before you see it is that it does NOT attempt to be historically accurate. In fact, many scenes were purposely 'sabotaged' with anachronisms to remind us that this is not a historical biography; instead it's meant to be a parable for the modern world.If I had known that, I might have enjoyed the movie instead of grinding my popcorn with searing hatred through most of it.Most noticeably, we're hit with a very non-18th century soundtrack: Adam Ant, Siouxie & the Banshees, The Cure, New Order, Bow Wow Wow, etc. And it's not just atmospheric background music either. There's actually a ballroom scene where they're rockin out to 80s post punk. If you don't realize the purpose of this odd juxtaposition, you might find yourself strangling the person sitting next to you.Other anachronisms are more subtle but equally bizarre. When Marie Antoinette goes on her shoe shopping spree (to the tune of 'I Want Candy', no less) if you look closely you'll see a pair of Converse hi tops in the picture. That's probably when it should sink in that the director is messin with you.So the point of my review is to warn you NOT to expect any sort of historical accuracy, or even proper historical context. 'Marie Antoinette' is more like the story of a 21st century teen growing up in a world of social jealousies, confused politics & cliquish loyalties. Only instead of the highschool hallways it happens in the Palace of Versailles.That explains why the film 'missed the opportunity' of chronicling the French Revolution, the royal flight to Austria, the subsequent trial for treason and other landmark events that you'd think would be covered in a film called 'Marie Antoinette'. But no, those weren't within the scope of the film.In the IMDb 'goofs' section, people have listed everything from 'The real Marie Antoinette didn't wear underwear' to '18th century French forks should have 3 tines, not 4.' Ooook. I'm sure those historians hated the movie like I did. But literally as I type this review, I'm hating the film less & less, and I might even try watching it a 2nd time. 'Marie Antoinette' is definitely not your typical period piece, though the lavish visuals and big budget might lead you to believe it is. Approach it instead as an experimental indie type film with no rules, and you might really enjoy it.For me it might be too late, but if you haven't seen this movie you should have fun if you know to expect a modern day story that's ironically set in the late 1700s. It's a good flick, although I question why it won at Cannes (actually, when you see the end credits and realize how much money this production brought to France, maybe there's no question why it won). Definitely do not expect an 18th century European history lesson. For that, stick with the excellent period piece 'Amadeus' and the very entertaining 1961 Sophia Loren film set during the French Revolution, 'Madame'.",Null,3,4,10 September 2013
Deja Vu," See Deja Vu... twice (har har)
","First glance of Déjà Vu's DVD cover presents what appears to be another action flick with a bunch of good looking people looking too cool for school. Not that there's anything wrong with that, they can't all be 'Agent PW' (Peewee Herman), but with the oversaturation of such action flicks it's easy to let one slip past you. Then I noticed who directed this film: the late, great Tony Scott.Tony Scott committed suicide by jumping off a bridge in 2012. We'll get to that in a minute. First let's go back in time, as this movie does (speaking of which, here's all you need to know about Déjà Vu's plot in 1 sentence: the movie opens with a tragedy in the first 5 minutes, and the remaining 121 minutes take our hero on a wild ride to unravel the truth and possibly... change it?).Tony Scott, younger brother of Ridley Scott ('Alien', 'Blade Runner', 'Prometheus'), was just as stylish and atmospheric with his films. Although best known for the more mainstream 'Top Gun', 'Days of Thunder' and 'Beverly Hills Cop II', he first turned heads with his phenomenal debut 'The Hunger', which was to vampire flicks what Kubrick's '2001: A Space Odyssey' was to scifi flicks. It brought a degree of sobriety and realism to a genre dominated by fantasy and cheesy special effects. Or in other words: 'sh!t gets real.'Here in Déjà Vu, we get the same sober treatment of 'time travel' movies. It's not just Marty McFly flooring a suped up Delorean and cruising into the past. Rather, we are presented the somewhat credible idea of being able to observe the past in real-time, similar to the way our telescopes allow us to observe the past of stars unfolding in real-time even though they have burned out billions of years ago. That's about all we get as far as explanations which I think is good. Nobody wants to spend 15 minutes talking about flux capacitors and stuff when people are about to get killed.The action doesn't let up for a single moment. That doesn't mean that there are continuous car chases and shootouts, but what I mean is that there's a thick air of tension that Tony Scott achieves even during quiet moments because there is always a sense of impending peril. Take the opening 5 minutes, for example. Even if you hadn't read the IMDb description (which I always advise people not to!) and even if I hadn't told you that there's a tragedy in the first 5 minutes, you can feel something is going to happen because that's what Tony Scott conveys to us from the 1st frame.A quick word about the acting, even though it should be obvious with Denzel Washington: fantastic. He reprises his signature action role of a loner who's somewhat cynical but not above showing tremendous humanity and compassion in addition to explosive outbursts. He also adds some great comedic moments, although most of the film's comic relief is handled by the excellent Adam Goldberg (remember Chandler's psycho roommate for 3 episodes of 'Friends'?) who plays the fast talking, sarcastic, pop-culture-quoting computer nerd 'Denny' who throws out zingers referencing everything from 'Saturday Night Live' to 'Airplane!' Now back to director Tony Scott and his suicide (you thought I had forgotten).The undisputed power of this film is carried by its mystery. I'm not just talking about whodunnit, but more importantly: whydunnit? Powerful themes of fatalism vs. free will, acceptance vs. action, and even a tasteful dose of logic vs. spiritualism are thrown at us around every corner. The result is a thriller where we can't figure out the director's strategy or motive until the very last scene. Some filmmakers are somewhat predictable (you always know Disney will end happy, you always know John Carpenter will end with a few gallons of blood). But here Tony Scott plays with his cards so close to his chest, and not only that but he fakes us out quite a few times, that your fingernails will be deeply imprinted in the armrest of your chair or the flesh of the unlucky person sitting next to you. And isn't that how Tony Scott left this world? An unexplained suicide (although some family members mentioned a secret battle with cancer, the coroner's official report showed no cancer, no serious medical conditions), the only thing that everyone could agree on was that Tony's leap from the bridge was 'inexplicable'. Who knows, maybe watching this film will give you some insight into the mind of the great director. Perhaps coincidentally, a bridge figures into this movie as a prominent symbol.Who knows, maybe you just wanted to watch a run-of-the-mill action flick with a bunch of good looking people looking too cool for school. But there's so much more here. Déjà Vu will definitely make you do a double-take.",Null,0,0,24 March 2017
Meet the Parents," If you hate cats Robert De Niro will kick your butt
","I know I'm late to the party, but probably so are you if you're reading reviews at this late date. 'Meet the Parents' is a funny flick that hearkens back to the glorious late-80s, or maybe even earlier, when comedies weren't so preoccupied with shocking the audience with gross out gags or surprise twists. Most of this movie is wonderfully predictable, and aside from a few deliberately clumsy drug references and maybe a sexual innuendo or two, it was good clean fun from start to finish.Most of all, I'd say it's a good date flick to prepare yourself for the inevitable agony of meeting your own boyfriend/girlfriend's parents. We all know it sucks. (If you don't think so, oh, just you wait. Sometimes it takes years for them to expose themselves as the hideous flesh eating monsters that they are.) De Niro manages to take us to the utter extreme of monster but without shattering our suspension of disbelief. This is a key point. If the situation were to become too absurd , we would lose focus on the story and instead hone in on the individual gags. While there are plenty of funny gags to go round, they are really just dressing on an already funny premise: the story of an underdog who just cannot fit in to a judgmental bourgeois family no matter how hard (and usually because of how hard) he tries.Ben Stiller shows his acting diversity (while on a different movie set playing the terminally airheaded Zoolander) as a dorky protagonist whose best intentions are always poorly timed or received completely the wrong way.The antagonists, in this case, everybody else in the movie, tread the fine line of comedy and irritation. That is, at any time you could find yourself laughing or hating them. What's masterfully done is the filmmaker's (and of course actors') ability to turn you on a dime, take you to the edge of wanting to kill someone but then having a hearty laugh at their antics. Like I said earlier, Robert De Niro is the anchor that makes this possible, and any casting short of him (well, or maybe Christopher Walken) would have resulted in the film falling apart due to the demands it puts on our willingness to accept a complete jerk like the character he plays. Really his only redeeming quality is that he likes cats. But that's the point, I guess. No matter how rude a person may seem, there's always something redeeming in there.Well, maybe except for the hilariously loathsome airline attendant who appears in a short but pivotal role at the film's climax. To me, that scene was worth the price of admission.Don't think twice, this is a movie worth seeing. Other similar films focusing on severely dysfunctional families trying to act normally include De Niro & Billy Crystal in 'Analyze This', a great Andy Garcia movie called 'City Island' and--this may be a stretch but--I think fans of 'Meet the Parents' would really enjoy the original British 'Death at a Funeral' (2007). Ya just gotta love comedies about trying to be normal in an utterly abnormal situation.",7,4,4,5 January 2014
Citizen Kane," How to watch Citizen Kane
","The first time I watched Citizen Kane, it was at a revival showing on a big screen at the Fabulous Fox Theatre in Atlanta. Unfortunately I was too engrossed in trying to get into my date's pants to notice what the film was about.I say 'unfortunately' not because I missed the film but because I never got into her pants.Years later it was released on DVD and I bought it, expecting to see, as the American Film Institute calls it, 'The greatest movie ever made'. I was very disappointed.But then I watched it again with the Peter Bogdonovich commentary, then immediately after that with the Roger Ebert commentary, and wow, I had a revelation. There is so much to this movie, I couldn't begin to tell you. No, it's not the greatest plot nor the greatest subject, nor does it even have the greatest acting (though the acting is quite great). The brilliance of this film lies in tiny, insignificant details which you'd probably miss on the 1st viewing. Seemingly trivial things like the placement of certain objects, people and lights combine to tell a visual story within the story. The sum of these tiny details equals a masterpiece.So I recommend you view it exactly as I did. See it once to get a feel for it. Then watch it again with the DVD commentaries. Watching it with a date whose pants you're trying to get into is optional and, frankly, not recommended. But other than that, there's a lot to see in this film. It may not be 'the greatest film ever made', but it is indeed great.",Null,0,2,27 July 2010
Beauty and the Beast," A review of the original (1991) & the 3D version (2012)
","I remember this as Disney's first breakthrough cartoon, boldly crossing demographics between children & adults. It's a cute, digestible story with some silly laughs for the young'uns, and it's also packed with some subtle, witty, almost suggestive zingers for the grownups.After seeing it again for the first time in 20 years, in glorious 3D no less, I thought I'd give a review on how it has aged over the years.First, let's talk about the 3D. Well I may be easily impressed (considering the last 3D movie I saw was 'Space Hunter' in 1983), but the 3D experience really brought this story to life and made me feel like a kid experiencing something new again. No, it's not quite as dazzling as the modern, computerized 3D films like I saw in the previews. But I don't know if we'd want it that way. The modern upgrades shouldn't upstage the timeless simplicity of this classic work of art, much like we wouldn't necessarily want to hear the old Beatles recordings remixed in bowel-busting, pelvis-pounding 5.1 surround sound. But some tasteful upgrades here & there can effectively liven up the presentation to today's standards. Here we get a nice enhanced depth of vision and a few spectacular moments like in the song 'Be Our Guest' and the ballroom scene. But I still remained immersed in the story instead of thinking 'wow this is 3D!'The material... Given that this is a vintage fairytale, it can feel a little dated and, well, 'cartoonish'. But isn't that the point? The good guys are unquestionably good. The bad guys are unquestionably bad. There is no moral ambiguity, and all personalities and situations are greatly exaggerated to make it clear to the audience. That's the part that may seem 'dated' in light of today's more complex, irresoluble story lines where good blends with evil and the universe isn't always fair. No, 'Beauty and the Beast' is one of the last true fairy tales & about as idealistic as it gets. So be sure to leave your cynicism at the door.The music & performances are first class. Songs are fun & playful, and I can imagine little kids squealing with delight as well as adults cracking big smiles. This film and 'Aladdin' stand out in my mind as being Disney's most entertaining musicals. There's a certain edge to the music that separates it from the old school Rodgers & Hammerstein type of songs and puts it in a new class of songwriting like Danny Elfman's work on 'Nightmare Before Christmas'. Beyond that, it's hard to describe. You just have to hear it.I was shocked to see the theater completely empty except for one couple hiding in the back. I suppose a lot of people are reluctant to pay the heavy price tag for a 3D film that was never intended that way. Make no mistake, I don't think the visuals will blow you away, especially if you already own your own copy of B&tB on DVD or Blu-Ray. But if, like me, the last time you saw the movie was 20 years ago, I think you owe it to yourself to revisit this great flick, and be sure to go for the full presentation. Who says you can never be a child again? For us old timers, 3D gives us the fresh novelty we need to make it happen.",Null,3,4,25 January 2012
Coffee and Cigarettes," Addictive!
","The first time I watched COFFEE & CIGARETTES I wasn't impressed. Even though certain parts had me rolling in laughter, overall I didn't get the point. But the next day I found myself wanting to re-watch certain segments, so I popped the DVD back in. This led me to watch the entire film again. And today, I simply can't get it out of my head! I'm neither a cigarette smoker nor a coffee drinker, but now I find myself yelling at the screen 'I totally relate!' And that's the beauty of this film told in 11 short (5-10 min) segments. You will relate to at least one--perhaps all--of the characters.The key to understanding the whole movie (don't worry... no spoilrs) is in a subtle metaphor repeated twice: philosopher/inventor Nikola Tesla suggested that the Earth is a conductor of acoustical resonance. Simply put, an acoustical conductor is something that vibrates in sympathy with all sound waves, like a tuning fork. Then if the Earth is a conductor, the 'sound waves' are us. People. In this case: coffee house people. Director Jarmusch takes us on a tour of coffee houses all over the world and lets us listen in on conversations, the way the Earth hears them.From there, you may draw your own philosophical conclusions. Or you may just enjoy it as a series of unrelated, humorous segments. Take it at your own pace. It definitely has a very Existential theme, which is another way of saying there is no theme... or is there? ;)",8,0,1,16 August 2005
Oldboy," I walked out.
","(I get a kick out of all the whiny dweebs who keep trying to delete this post. Reason: 'WAAH, IT MAKES ME MAAAD!' That should give you an indication of the sort of people who like this movie: whiny dweebs.)What an annoying little pretentious slop of a movie. If it's any indication, Quentin Tarantino worships it. That alone should send up some warning flags (that fruitcake should go back to his decapitated Barbie dolls).I feel sorry for the 4 squids that were killed in the making of this movie (shoved into some guy's mouth and eaten alive & thrashing about). For what? So that some punk boys in the audience can say, 'Yuck! Coooool!' It's a sad day for the human race when this is a celebrated form of entertainment.Btw, the star of the movie, supposedly a devout Buddhist, excused his actions by saying he prayed for each squid after he chewed it up alive. How sweet.Aside from that, the movie is about as juvenile as one of my 4th grade crayon sketches. I guess that's why this film is popular with 4th graders. (Does your mommy know you're sneaking out to watch R-rated films?) I'm appalled at how many internet kids love this movie. But then again, a lot of Romans loved the gladiatorial games. If you're one of these people, go ahead; ignore this review and go back to slurping your raw meat & watching porn. You're just one of the (internet) masses.",1,22,58,18 July 2007
The Secret in Their Eyes," Great movie to watch when all other movies tick you off
","Here's me going through my movie collection: 'No. Nope. Too stupid. Too intelligent. Too juvenile. Too pretentious. Too predictable. Too unbelievable.'You'd think I would learn my lesson and stop shopping for movies at Blockbuster close out sales.And then my finger hit 'The Secret in their Eyes' and I thought 'Hm, Academy Award winner, Best Foreign Language Film 2009... doubtlessly too political.' But I popped it in anyway, figuring out of all my options I'd hate it the least.Right from the first scene I knew this film had something important to say. And I'm not just talking about some canned socio-political cliché that wins many Best Foreign Film Academy Awards. This movie has an important personal message to tell, and it's woven into the story in a very careful way.The trailer, as well as a lot of exuberant film critics, make this sound like a tense action packed thrill ride, but it's not. Even better, it's a quiet, human, often comedic tale that happens to have some great elements of 'thriller' and 'mystery' and 'romance' without falling squarely into any of those predictable categories. In a sentence, the plot is about a retired court employee who, unable to forget a murder case from 25 years earlier, decides to write a book about it and thus dig up some old ghosts.Yes, if handled like a John Grisham thriller, it could have fallen into a standard Hollywood formula, but in the expert hands of director Juan José Campanella (quite respected in his home country of Argentina but not yet as famous in the USA), the film balances itself as a thoughtful yet very engaging statement about human nature. I am reminded of another excellent award winner from the same year 2009, 'Five Minutes of Heaven', a UK film that similarly focuses on a crime decades past and how different characters have been affected by the passing of time.But what made 'The Secret in their Eyes' even more interesting to me is the way it's not necessarily about a past crime, but it's also applied to past love, past opportunities and past (and present) obsessions. As a great line in the film goes: 'A man can change his appearance, his job, his god. But he can't change his passion.' Thus the theme is stated: this is about letting go, or not letting go. And whether we're talking about crime, justice, love or dreams, we can all relate.I have to mention one thing with regard to the cinematography & visual presentation. This is the sort of movie that cinema geeks will love, and so will average people just looking for entertainment. Certain scenes are so expertly handled, yet not obnoxiously artsy, that you can't help but get swept up in them. For example, perhaps the crowning achievement is the 'stadium scene' which is a 5-minute, uninterrupted shot that begins a mile in the air above a stadium before gliding over the field, into the stands, to a dialogue between two characters, then following behind them on a tense scene running through the stadium floors, into a bathroom, over a ledge(!), through some more twists, then back to the field ALL IN ONE CAMERA SHOT. Certainly it was edited to appear like one shot but it's seamless. Fans of Orson Welles' famous 'Touch of Evil' opening scene (which itself takes us through the streets of a Mexican city in a brilliantly orchestrated 5-minute single shot) will love this sort of stuff.If you have the opportunity to see this movie, whether or not you find yourself in a cranky mood like I was, don't pass it up. Last note about content warnings: there's a disturbing rape scene right near the beginning with some nudity and blood, one or two bloody but tasteful scenes, then there's a somewhat eyebrow raising (yet necessary) scene of frontal man parts. But if you, your kids and/or your puritanical parents can handle those, the film is OK for everyone. Since this is a non-USA film where animal cruelty laws don't necessarily apply, I thought I'd mention there is no animal cruelty, whether simulated or real. This is a great film which, I believe, demonstrates the finest of modern Argentinian cinema.",Null,2,2,20 December 2015
Superbad," The most ambitious teen rompcom I've ever seen
","Yes, it's funny. It's silly, it's crass, it's irreverant, and it has all the makings of a mindless adolescent farce like the ones I grew up with from American Pie to Revenge of the Nerds and all their sequels. But when this movie ended and the credits rolled I was left speechless in awe. And not just because of all the penis drawings during the credits.'Superbad' is, as you may expect from any film produced by Judd Apatow (40 Year Old Virgin, Knocked Up, etc), on the raunchy side. So don't be surprised if you see a penis drawing or 2. But what makes this an amazing film is that despite all the raunchiness and partying and horseplay it actually delivers some powerful human and sentimental themes.In the hands of an inferior cast, it would have flopped and come across as cheesy. But with these actors, each delivering a larger than life performance despite playing high school seniors, it's magnificent. I'll give you just 1 example of what I'm talking about...There's a scene where 2 characters are gearing up for a sexual encounter (their first). But one of them (and arguably both) are not ready for it. Unlike all the teen romps that I grew up with, where the goal is for the guy to bed the girl, this scene makes us put the brakes on and consider: Wait... Why is the goal always for the guy to bed the girl?? And at the same time it's really funny and does not sacrifice the film's momentum. I won't ruin the ending of the scene, but let's just say it's satisfying on every level and punctuated with a great gag to make us laugh.'Superbad' is truly an evolution of the genre. It's every bit as crass and wacky and full of horseplay as all the others since Porky's, but this is the first time one of these mindless comedies dares to make us think and feel on a deeper level. Like I said, it's largely due to the great casting. Michael Cena, if you're not familiar, plays his signature role of an awkward deer-in-the-headlights kid but with a strong sense of who he is, even though nobody else seems to understand. Jonah Hill plays his best friend, sort of the antithesis: a loser who thinks he knows what he wants but he's really quite confused. Emma Stone knocks it out of the park with a great role that's quirky, cool, rebellious and responsible all at the same time. Rounding out the troupe are Bill Hader and Seth Rogan who play a pair of despicable yet loveable cops whose combined IQ is around the same as their blood alcohol level.This flick has it all. It's definitely for mature audiences in terms of language (at least the unrated cut I watched), but ironically it has some great messages for teens and younger viewers, if you can see through the tomfoolery. There aren't many films I can compare this to, but if you've seen 'Easy A' with Emma Stone (somewhat tamer than this), I'd say 'Superbad' has the same vibe. A seemingly silly teen comedy that packs a serious punch under the surface.",8,0,0,29 February 2020
500 Days of Summer," Rashômon, the rom-com
","In the first 2 minutes, the narrator warns us 'This is NOT a love story'. I knew this beforehand but still thought it would be a good date movie, so I asked a hot chick to watch it with me. Why am I telling you this? Mostly because I wanted to brag about finally working up the nerve to ask out a hot chick. But also to let you know that '(500) Days of Summer' isn't exactly a hot date movie.So much better, it's a very clever story about perception and particularly how emotions affect perception. In 1950 Kurosawa gave us the legendary film 'Rashômon' which defined the technique by using multiple narrators to tell the story of a murder. A few years ago, the French film 'He Loves Me... He Loves Me Not' took the same basic idea and applied it to a love story. Here we have yet another innovation. It's a lovestory highlighting different perspectives, but they're coming from the same person.How did the director accomplish this? By jumping around the timeline. '(500) Days of Summer' begins at Day #488, then back to Day #1, then forward, then back, etc. It can be slightly disorienting at times, but I believe that is the intent. By departing from the standard linear storytelling, the director accentuates the bipolar jumps in perception experienced by a guy who's alternately in & out of love.I don't know if this has been done before (several people have compared this film to 'Annie Hall' which I haven't seen), but for me it was a thoroughly original experience.The acting is great. Joseph Gordon-Levitt delivers yet another charming performance as the handsome nerd who's desperately trying to get a grip. Zooey Deschanel plays a challenging role: one minute lovable, the next minute not-so-lovable (in keeping with the theme of the film), and she truly delivers. You just have to see the movie to know what I'm talking about.If you liked 'Rashômon' or 'He Loves Me...' you should definitely check this out & see what you think. I'd also compare it to another great offbeat romcom 'Adam' and a really offbeat French romcom(?) called 'The Girl from Monaco'.'(500) Days of Summer' has spots of comedy & a light-hearted presentation, although its primary focus is the drama & the underlying theme of 'reality vs. expectation'. Again, not the perfect date movie. Although we both liked it, I don't know if I'll get a 2nd date with the hot girl... quick can someone suggest a good Hugh Grant flick?",8,1,1,30 August 2012
Juno," Didn't like it at first, but it seeps in.
","I committed the cardinal sin of seeing this movie just because it was so hyped up and was nominated for a kajillion awards. It didn't measure up to my inflated expectations. But since then I've seen it 2 more times, and I really like it.It's been a while since I've watched a coming-of-age teen film (the last probably being 'Sixteen Candles' in the theater, so that ought to give you an idea of how frequently I do this sort of thing). If you belong to my generation, the humour of 'Juno' may seem low-key and on the sarcastic side, but I guess the world isn't about cutesy Molly Ringwald anymore.Ellen Page is cute & engaging, though in every scene she seems like she's 2hrs late on her anti-depression medication (she's not nearly as fun as she was in 'Whip It'). I thought her co-star Olivia Thirlby stole the show as the slightly flakey, slightly slutty cheerleader. It's ironic that Olivia Thirlby would star in the shameless 2008 ripoff of this film, 'The Wackness', which left me with a horrid impression of her. But I blame that on The Wackness's lame script and weak presentation and utter stupidity and total lack of reality and a douchenozzle for a director. But I digress...'Juno' on the other hand is solidly crafted, with a surprisingly powerful performance from Jennifer Garner. My only real criticism is that they shouldn't have cut out all the deleted scenes (included on the DVD). The theatrical version didn't really cover everything--for example, the big fight & sudden tension between Juno and Bleeker--and as a result you may think certain characters are overreacting to nothing. However, if you watch the deleted scenes, you get more of a feeling why things are so tense.For now, I'll give this movie a 6, and if they release an extended director's cut, I may bump it up a point or two.",6,2,7,5 November 2010
Yes Man," A feel good movie that doesn't feel stupid
","Meet Carl. He's the most negative person you've ever met. Only you'll never meet him because he hides from society being terminally annoyed by everyone. Unexpectedly, something happens which makes him say yes to everything.Right in league with other fun & silly what-if plots like 'The Invention of Lying' (a world where nobody ever lies) or 'Stranger Than Fiction' (a guy who hears a narrator telling him his own life story), 'Yes Man' is good clean entertainment that, who knows, might even change your life. Or at least get you out of the house once in a while.'Yes Man' differs from the other 2 films I mentioned (great flicks by the way) in one important respect: it's not a bizarre alternate reality, nor is there anything really supernatural going on. So it's more down-to-earth and less wacky than you might expect. But that gives the actors more room to give it a personal touch. In other words, what makes this movie work isn't just a crazy story but good solid character development.Jim Carey, who plays 'Carl', is somewhat toned down compared to his manic 'Mask' theatrics, but subtlety works to his advantage. (Note: if you want to see Carey in all his insane glory, check out the bonus features where he really lets loose). As he meets quirky characters, it's Carey who plays the straight man, and his deadpan expressions are hilarious. The way he tolerates his overexuberant boss 'Norman' (Rhys Darby) is classic. Norman himself is something similar to Austin Powers in a business suit. Zooey Deschanel is, well, she's Zooey Deschanel - awesome and cute as hell, playing the role of a photography/jogging instructor by day and by night she sings in an alt band that has a total of 7 fans.What's really fun about this movie is seeing how all the quirky characters converge in a well written story that all comes together with every character contributing. There aren't necessarily any bank capers or high speed chases (wait, actually there are sorta)--what I mean is, there aren't a lot of contrived plot twists and seat-gripping thrills; the film relies on its entertaining script and the aforementioned acting expertise. But it delivers a great story with never a dull moment. Should you watch 'Yes Man'? My answer is.......... sure dude.",Null,0,0,8 April 2018
Zodiac," 'Zodiac' kicks ass-trology!
","Zodiac is a real Gem-ini of a movie. Pisces of it reminded me of the great 70s crime thrillers. I wasn't keeping Scor-pio, but I caught several references to 70s classics like 'Bullitt', 'Starsky & Hutch', 'Scooby-Doo' and a Slinkee commercial.This is not a horror(-scope) flick. 'Zodiac' doesn't have much gore, so you might want to Libra your expectations at home. True, this movie has some suspenseful moments, but not really any big scares that'll make you jump and spill your hot-buttered Capricorn. In that respect, the mood reminded me of Oliver Stone's slow paced thriller 'Talk Radio', or the conspiracy mystery 'The China Syndrome'. There isn't a lot of action, but rather, the appeal of the film is the way we feel almost suffocated by a thick Aries of suspense.I guess you could say it's an Aquard-ius taste. Director David Fincher's is noTaurius for hitting us with disturbing, grisly material like in his 1995 masterpiece 'Se7en'. While not quite as ghastly as that, 'Zodiac' is still a nice throwback to Fincher's earLeo works.So my only warning is: don't expect a heart pounding screamer like 'Se7en'. But if you were to ask me, 'Can I still enjoy this movie, sir?' then my response would be, 'You most certainly Can,cer!'",Null,0,0,22 July 2016
Milk," Powerful film, but the director does a disservice to the movement
","Up front, let me say that this is a good movie with excellent acting, a powerful message, and overall it's a credit to the art of filmmaking. Other reviewers have covered that better than I can; I just want to mention something that no one else seems to have brought up.Director Gus Van Sant chose to focus on the personal life of the man Harvey Milk rather than the cause he championed. This wouldn't be a problem except that Van Sant gives us a highly airbrushed, family-friendly, almost Disney version of Harvey Milk, making me wonder: if this film isn't about the gay rights movement, and if it isn't about the real Harvey Milk, then what is it about?If you dare to hear me out for 2 paragraphs, you might want to don your iconoclast flak jacket because I may shatter the lily white image of Milk that the director would have you believe. But I'm doing this to make a point that a good film would celebrate the ideals of an individual rather than the individual (or a fabcation of a perfect saint for us to idolize). But such is Hollywood, I guess.The man real man Harvey Milk wasn't always the boyscout which director Gus Van Sant paints him to be. In reality, it may have been more accurate to say that Harvey was *interested in dating* boyscouts (boo hiss, I couldn't resist 1 tasteless joke, but the truth remains: at least one of Harvey's lovers, Jack McKinley, was 16 years old when Harvey, 33, ran away with him in 1963). Another sore spot, which the film exploits for a cheap emotional twist, is the suicide of a certain minor character. If you want to know the truth behind this subplot, google 'Harvey Milk and the Boy from Minnesota' for an eye opening exposé which might make you wish they had omitted the whole episode from the film, rather than twist it into a tear jerker.I understand that Harvey Milk is synonymous with gay rights in the 1970s, and certainly he deserves much praise for his amazing accomplishments. I just resent the way Gus Van Sant fabricated a glossy, flawless hero. I would've much preferred a fallible hero who does the right thing, much like the excellent film 'Amadeus' accurately portrays Mozart as a stumbling drunk but a musical genius nonetheless. Give the audience credit for differentiating the human from the achievement.Apologies if I ruined the illusion of Harvey Milk's perfect life, but isn't it better to honor the things he did? If anything, that's the legacy Harvey Milk wanted: for us to carry on the message rather than idolizing the messenger.",Null,1,5,30 December 2017
Silent Hill," A review for the clueless who didn't know this is an adaptation of a videogame
","Yea I live in a cave. Not only am I over a decade late to the Silent Hill party, but I had no idea that it is an adaptation of the famous 1999 PlayStation game Silent Hill. If this describes you as well then read on because it might help you enjoy this flick more.Silent Hill the movie has a distinctly cold, brooding vibe similar to the classic supernatural mindbenders like The Others, The Sixth Sense, or even going way back to The Shining. That is, it immediately puts us in a surreal state of mind, cut off from reality (in this case an abandoned ghost town) where anything can & usually does happen.Where it gets crazy and possibly disorienting to newbies is when it incorporates some of the videogame elements which are never really explained. The terrifying monster Pyramid Head just sort of appears without any context, and similarly the famous Nurses From Hell scene happens almost randomly. These are excellent scenes, but still a bit disorienting if you're trying to relate everything to the narrative that's unfolding.The story itself is about a woman searching for a child in the creepy ghost town of Silent Hill, and it becomes a sort of dysfunctional Alice in Wonderland type tale with random gruesome episodes and good scares, but underneath it is a consistent plot which slowly reveals itself. One unique angle worth mentioning is that this movie is almost entirely a female cast. I thought that was a really interesting diversion from the standard horror flick where men dominate the story as both heroes and villians. Here our protagonist is a strong female lead--not quite Sarah Connor Terminator 2 strong, but definitely not a squeaking damsel in distress. The antagonist is a female as well, a very creepy matriarchal character whom you totally wouldn't want to meet at Sunday brunch.Just be prepared that not everything ties neatly into the story (due to the videogame elements), and that's my only real criticism. However, if I watch it a 2nd time I'll be better prepared, as I hope you are after reading this! Silent Hill is a great flick with some terrifying moments, nice creative gore (ever see someone get their entire skin ripped off? tune in) and a satisfying story with a really interesting twist. Definitely worth checking out.",7,2,2,17 October 2019
Hotel Rwanda," What were you doing in 1994?
","What were you doing in 1994? I was probably rockin to Soundgarden's latest album on my portable CD player, waiting for Seinfeld to come on while pondering the OJ Simpson murder case, the 'news of the century.'Meanwhile, as many as one million people were being butchered with machetes, raped and tortured by their fellow humans, as an entire nation collectively lost its mind.Suddenly Seinfeld ain't so funny.This film is epic, if for the sole reason that it brings to light a horrific chapter of human history that many of us would otherwise know nothing of. Let me repeat: as many as 1 million people (the population of North Dakota and Wyoming combined) were slaughtered, and the politicians of the western world did nothing to stop it, and the media never gave it 1/1000th as much air time as OJ. Yes, it is a disturbing film, but it focuses on the brave struggle of one individual in his efforts to save as many lives as possible. So it is also a very inspiring film.To be honest I was too engrossed in the story to be able to review this movie on technical merits such as acting, cinematography, musical score, etc. I believe that is the way to watch this film; it is not a film, it is an experience. A lesson. A reminder that, while we live our comfortable lives in 1080p HD Blu-Ray comfort, we have no clue what is going on with 'the other half'.I will say that every performance was very convincing, and several scenes could be called poetic if they weren't so disturbing (I'm referring to the river road in the fog... but you'll see what I mean). I was instantly pulled in by Don Cheadle as the 'everyman' hero of the story, and I was equally intent on supporting cast members such as Nick Nolte whose character was based on Canadian general Dallaire (even though the real Dallaire was never consulted about this film).It's crazy, but you'll have to keep reminding yourself that this story is real, even though its plot is as preposterous as the craziest Hollywood fiction you've seen.This is a film I highly recommend to people who like to get involved. Whether you're a political activist, whether you volunteer walking dogs at your local animal shelter, or whether you blog about life in general, this is a film for you. Yes, it will upset you. But I think in the end it will get you stoked to get out there and change this damaged world.",8,1,1,18 August 2013
Dear John," Dammit, Lasse Hallström made me cry again
","Lasse Hallström, the Swedish director who gave us Chocolat (2001), Gilbert Grape (1993) and Hachi: A Dog's Tale (2009) is at it again - making chick flicks for guys. This means, unlike your stereotypical chick flick whose leading man is a hollow beefcakey stud with as much personality as the scenery, here we get a complex beefcakey stud whom the chicks can swoon over whilst the bros say 'duuuuude he's cool.'In this case the protagonist is 'John' (Channing Tatum) who plays an Army Special Forces character who can kill you with a toothpick but has total control over his emotions. Until, of couse, he meets 'Savannah' (Amanda Seyfried) over his 2 week furlough before going back to war.As you might guess, the story explores the ultimate long distance relationship as John completes his 1 year tour as a soldier while Savannah waits at home. Sounds boring? Well wait, there are complications. John's father is autistic and his mother abandoned them years ago. So John is forced to be the responsible one, but the whole war/love thing throws him out of whack.Meanwhile Savannah has a few secrets of her own (and I gotta admit I totally didn't see it coming). And on top if it all, 9/11 hits and this forces John to make a decision whether to stay with his platoon and most likely get his butt blown off, or retire once his initial tour is over. Oh, and the movie begins with John getting blasted by gunfire, meaning the story unfolds in a huge flashback leaving us wondering the whole time if John dies or not.This is a very sentimental flick, much like the other Hallström movies I mentioned, but it doesn't get sappy or predictable. In fact at least 3 plot twists took me by total surprise. And I'm talking like 'whoa duuuuude I never saw THAT coming' surprise.'Dear John' focuses on interpersonal relationships when duty comes into play - and I'm not just talking about duty toward your country (a cleverly woven parallel), but duty to parents, children and those who need help. This is juxtaposed against selfish happiness, or the storybook love. Pay close attention to the characters' choices & sacrifices, and how these choices are based on duty/selflessness rather than 'getting the girl'. I think that's what makes this a unique romance. Whereas most Hollywood romance flicks focus on the problems of 2 lovers, 'Dear John' presents us with an ideal love that is complicated by external loyalties.The trademark of Hallström movies is some other issue (not just love) driving the characters, and that's why these films aren't sappy or predictable. Another trademark is is use of gorgeous scenery, in this case the beaches of Charleston SC. He achieves a very nostalgic beach feeling, even for those of us who have only been to the beach once or twice in our lives (see also his film 'Safe Haven' filmed in Southport, NC).'Dear John' is a quiet, sentimental film, so don't expect action, car chases & robots. But it delivers a few tricky plot twists, so it's never boring. If you're not familiar with Hallström's style, I'd say it's artistic without being over-the-top artsy. Think of Kieslowsky (Blue, White, Red trilogy) or Wim Wenders (Paris Texas, Wings of Desire) or possibly even Steven Soderbergh (Sex Lies & Videotape, Solaris, Magic Mike) and you'll have a general idea of how this film feels.",Null,6,6,2 May 2018
Crash," The #2 Feel Bad Movie of the 2000s
","'Crash' is a superbly made film. The actors are first rate, the camera style is engaging, and production value is tops. And despite all this, I would never recommend it to anyone. Why? I'll explain in my 4th paragraph but first let's talk about the story.This film follows the lives of a dozen or so people over the course of 2 days all living in Los Angeles. The opening scene gives us the aftermath of some ambiguous tragedy (the titular 'crash'), and the next scene flashes back to 'yesterday' and shows us the events in these people's seemingly unrelated lives, leading up to that opening moment. If you've seen 'House of Sand and Fog' (the #1 Feel Bad Movie of the 2000s), you'll recognize an identical sort of chronology and foreboding tone--so similar that I wonder if the Crash filmmakers were somehow involved in House as well. Both films are very powerful and effective at what they aim to do, and that is, simply put, to disturb us.Disturb us it does. Within the first 15 minutes, we see things that are so disturbing to the pit of our souls that I almost shut the movie off twice. Racism, hate, justified racism, justified hate, brutal stereotypes. The film masterfully shows us not only the worst quality of humankind but it scrutinizes the reasons why humans are this way. There's no good guy/bad guy; it's all bad guys. The first 15 mins is designed to make us hate almost every character, if not every race. By showing the atrocity that each race supposedly inflicts on the other, it paints us a Hatfield-McCoy cycle of hatred that has no known origin. It just exists and burns hotter. Non-whites are subverted by white society, so they exact revenge by committing crimes against white people which in turn causes the white police to hate and abuse non-white people who in turn become criminals against white people. The cycle of hate is not only explained but validated in a well-crafted, brutally told, highly disturbing way.Which leads me to the 4th paragraph where I explain why I would never recommend this film. It's because IT JUST MAKES YOU FEEL BAD. For nearly 2 hours you get the same feeling you get when you watch too much cable news. And just as psychologists warn that watching too much news leads to depression, I would say the same can be said of films like this which, like the news, expose and scrutinize the absolute worst of humanity.But then one might say that films like this are necessary to inspire change. Normally I would agree, and I'm sure that that's the intent of the filmmakers here. But let me ask you: who needs to change? Answer: racists and bigots. But are racists and bigots really going to be watching 'Crash', stroking their beards and saying 'Golly, I need to stop being a racist'? Probably not. And that is the film's undoing. By taking a heavy, ponderous, complex look at racism and hate, it alienates the fury-driven haters who most need to grasp this message. And instead 'Crash' merely preaches to the choir, making the choir feel gawd awful lousy about the state of the world.The film attempts to lead us to redemption, and there is at least 1 truly powerful scene of triumph that's worth the price of admission. However, other subplot resolutions seem a bit contrived, if not completely unnecessary, such as one character's climactic tragedy & epiphany which was so random I literally burst out laughing (the moral of the story being: don't wear socks indoors!). Ultimately 'Crash' tries to tie things up neatly with a positive message, but it's precisely this neat tie-up, simultaneously with every sub-plot, that feels a bit contrived and ultimately unbelievable. At the risk of cutting out half the award-winning cast, perhaps the film should have focused on just 1 story & resolution, rather than pulling the 'Fantasy Island' formula of having half a dozen stories wrap up neatly in the last 10 minutes.Ultimately, despite its excellent presentation and first class acting, 'Crash' couldn't sell me on its optimistic spin and instead left me feeling pretty horrible about the reality of living in a world where racists don't often have magical transformations. If you understand what I'm saying, you might want to skip this flick because, regardless of how it ends, the subject will just make you feel bad.",Null,1,1,2 October 2019
Sweeney Todd: The Demon Barber of Fleet Street," A wonderful film ruined by the most soulless music ever
","Excellent cast.Excellent directing.Excellent cinematography.Excellent story.Lousy music.Don't get me wrong; the music was well crafted. The arrangements were meticulous, and the lyrics were at times clever. But let this be an example: smooth polish and technical perfection does not make a good song. Without any soul; without any memorable melody, the songs are only fit for elevator music.'Sweeny Todd' would have been a great movie without the lame tunes, but instead it turned out to be a very poor musical.

Nacho Libre," I didn't get it, but it's hilarious.
","OK, let me say up front that I come from the older generation of comedies. Dean Martin & Jerry Lewis, When Harry Met Sally, all the way up to & including Airplane. Nacho Libre presents a new & very different style of humour. You don't get big punchlines, witty comebacks or rapid-fire dialogues. If I had to describe it, I'd say it's 'deadpan' to an extreme. You really have to key in on subtle signals like facial expressions, odd phrases, or just situational weirdness to understand the jokes.Not expecting that, I watched this movie all the way through and only laughed twice. I kept waiting for punchlines that never came.After watching it, I came to the IMDb message board and read through the thread of 'Funniest Lines'. Sure enough, I didn't get the jokes there either, but seeing how everyone was cracking up, I realized that those lines were funny.After that, I found myself talking to people in everyday life, quoting Nacho Libre and getting big laughs. Suddenly I think I get it. I'll probably watch this film again, knowing what to expect, and I bet I'll get a few big lols out of it. Maybe even a rofl or 2.",6,0,0,16 December 2009
Underworld Awakening," Imagine if Steven Segal wrote an Underworld movie
","Not meant as a diss to either this movie or to Steven Segal, but my title sums it up. Like a Steven Segal flick such as, um, you know the one where something bad happens and then Steven kills all the bad people, 'Underworld Awakening' is cut from the same mold. That is: high on action, low on story. This might work depending on what mood, or level of inebriation, you're in. However, it's a noticeable departure from the prior 3 Underworld films.In each of the prior films, sure there was a ton of action & flashy pyrotechnics, but they were carried by a pretty clever story usually featuring a big 'aha gotcha' reveal at the end. What made them so interesting was seeing how Selene reacts to the gotcha, dealing with intense conflicts of loyalty and faith in her purpose.'Underworld Awakening' doesn't really have any big character revelation like that. It's a linear story that's mostly predictable (in a good way). The strength of this film lies in the cool action scenes and, of course, the tense atmosphere that's pervasive in all the films.When I say 'cool action scenes' I'm referring to some interesting shots that go by so quickly that if you blink you might miss them, but if you catch them you're left thinking 'woah. cool.'I'll give you just one example. There's a scene where a bad guy gets dropped from a high building, then the camera switches to a stationary shot at ground level where (you guessed it) SPLUK the bad guy smashes into a roof of a car, which is pretty cool in itself, but simultaneously Selene descends at the same moment like a badass, landing on the ground and walking away. woah. cool.The entire film has some subtle yet clever shots like that--interesting camera angles (like Selene's opening, rotating scene)--which serve as excellent eye candy with a touch of artistry.So really I'm not complaining, except that after the heart pounding spectacle is over, you realize that there wasn't really much of a clever story like the old ones. Still a fun ride which I recommend to all Underworld fans (and yes, you should see at least 1 & 2 before watching this, otherwise you may get very confused).",Null,0,1,17 May 2019
Barry Lyndon," Amadeus without F. Murray Abraham
","Try to picture it. Try to picture the movie Amadeus without F. Murray Abraham (Salieri). Magnificent sets, powerful music, impeccable costumes, great directing... but no character. That's the feeling I got from Barry Lyndon.As another reviewer put it, this movie is '3 hrs of pretty pictures and wooden characters - not one involving personality.' Well, maybe that's a bit harsh, but overall I agree that not one of the characters was sufficiently engaging. Just after the halfway mark (after hearing the same 8 bars from Handel's 'Sarabande' played for the 7324512th time) I was about ready to pull the plug.But I'm glad I stuck around til the end. Like I said, the grandeur of production was enough to make it worthwhile, and the plot picked up in the last 30 mins. My rating swung back from a 4/10 to a 6/10.I just wish the characters had souls. Even the reviewers who rated this a 10/10 hardly mention the acting; they focus on the technical and visual merits instead (which I agree are 1st class... though perhaps lost on some of us non-film-school folks).But someone's gotta say it: People born in California should NEVER be allowed to do Irish, Scottish or British accents. I say this about Ryan O'Neil as well as Keanu Reeves and Julia Roberts. Well OK, Julia wasn't born in California, but her accent in Mary Reilly was awful just the same. And yeah, I know Keanu was born in Lebanon, but he'll always be a surfer dude to me.Bottom line: if you're a fan of Kubrick or Thackaray, you'll probably enjoy this. But since no one on Earth has ever finished a full Thackaray novel (admit it, you just bought the Cliff's Notes in high school like the rest of us), I think we can narrow this down to Kubrick fans only.",6,2,10,13 October 2006
The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring," It's a good kids movie.

Once again, let me stress: IT'S A KIDS MOVIE.You'll find no subtlety, no symbolism, no real character development, no underlying theme, no clever dialog, and nothing really to challenge your mind. Instead you'll get action, dazzling landscapes, special effects, a rushing musical score, good costumes, good makeup and action (I say that twice, because it's the best thing the movie has going for it... really, the action scenes are pretty good).But if you're looking for an *artistic* fairy tale (like City of Lost Children, Brazil, Big Fish, The Crow, Nosferatu [1979] or Arizona Dream), you'll not only be disappointed... you'll be downright annoyed.",2,5,10,21 August 2005
Walk Hard: The Dewey Cox Story," Somewhere between 'A Mighty Wind' and 'Airplane!'
","'Walk Hard' is another film from the Judd Apatow gang who brought you such inane gems as 'Anchorman', 'Talladega Nights', '40-Year-Old Virgin' and so on. In the same vein, you'll get a wacky blend of absurd humor, parody, satire and sexual gags not suitable for young kids. Note: I saw the unrated version which has a few gags featuring, among other things, one or two closeup shots of a man's hangy down thing (haha IMDb won't let me type w.a.n.k.e.r).The tone of the whole film is very tongue-in-cheek and satirical, with a good zinger at least once every 30 seconds. Perhaps even more fun is spotting all the cameo appearances by famous personalities such as director Harold Ramis (playing 'L'Chaim' the Jewish industrialist), Paul Rudd ('John Lennon'), Jack Black ('Paul McCartney'), Jack White from the White Stripes ('Elvis') and Eddie Vedder from Pearl Jam (playing himself). Other actors from SNL, The Office and Big Bang Theory add to the star-spotting extravaganza.The story is mostly a shameless mock-up of Johnny Cash's biopic 'Walk the Line' but with scenes parodied from other musical biopics like 'Ray' and 'La Bamba'. A goofily predictable rise to fame of a music star story, this film mercilessly skewers the clichés, with over-the-top melodramatic scenes like the bigwig producer telling Dewey he sucks and will never make it, only to start singing his praises after Dewey strums 2 chords. Other gags are even more silly, like some of the corny visual wordplays in 'Airplane!' (for example there's a dramatic scene where he shouts 'I can't fight the temptations!' and runs into the hallway where we see ...guess who?... singing their motown hit 'My Girl'). From the outset all the way to its conclusion this movie is pure silliness.If you like 'em that way then have no fear, you won't be let down. However if you're expecting something more along the lines of the more subtle yet equally hilarious Christopher Guest comedies ('Spinal Tap', 'A Mighty Wind', 'Best in Show'), then you might start to tire of the fast paced, deliberately predictable gags we see here. 'Walk Hard' is an enjoyable experience but probably not intended to be a cult classic music comedy like the aforementioned Guest films which spawned an entire genre of sophisticated comedy (if you can consider a film called 'A Mighty Wind' to be sophisticated). 'Walk Hard' is just pure mindless entertainment, and it delivers. Watch it on days when you just want to shut your brain off and have some fun. I knocked off a few points because the nudity & prolonged sex scenes can get a little distracting from this otherwise silly romp (a 10-second closeup of a man's crankshaft might cross the line of discomfort).",7,2,3,9 November 2014
Apocalypse Now," Beware
","Beware, my friends.  Though bold and striking, this is not a movie that should show its face in the new millennium or any era of artistic expression evolved beyond adolescence.  Casual film-goers will probably be impressed at the scenery, the grandeur and the theatrics as I was when I was 16.  But years later, I've matured a bit, and I am absolutely horrified and sickened at how I was duped.  (It's not unlike the feeling of rummaging through your old 80s wardrobe and seeing those 'cool' parachute pants, acid-washed jeans and Miami Vice sockless-loafers accusing you from beyond the grave!)Not all of you, but an (enlightened?) minority WILL BE OFFENDED by this movie.  Certainly the veterans of Vietnam will smell something rank about how Mr. Coppola made such a pretentious carnival out of that truly humbling and difficult time.  But what I found utterly damning of this film, despite the best efforts of performers, were the atrocities that Mr. Coppola committed for the sake of his magnum opus.  A bull was slaughtered live and on camera just for some added gore (of which there is no shortage in this movie).  Acres of beautiful, Filipino countryside were ignited with Hollywood napalm (gasoline).  And last but not least, an entire culture was slandered beyond belief to a degree from which they may not have yet recovered.A few years ago, a New York radio personality gained enormous popularity with his irreverent and vulgar on-air antics.  I admit that at the time I was amused by the novelty, but then I grew up.  It may be a few decades yet, but I have enough faith in human/artistic evolution that this movie will similarly be relegated to its proper place as a monumental but shameful part of our ever-growing history.My advice to those of you with unquenchable curiosity?  Before contributing to the popularity and profits of this production (as I foolishly did), borrow a copy of this movie from someone and watch it secretly, as you would a horrible car wreck on the side of the road.",1,38,84,28 December 2003
Silver Linings Playbook," A romcom for effed up people
","I wanted to hate this movie sooo much. This is because a bunch of people told me to watch it, and not in a 'hey this is a great flick' way but in a derogatory, judgmental 'you NEED to watch this movie (lingering stare)' way. I get it. It's about people with some serious mental issues. Sure, I'll watch it just to say I did.But instead of hating it, this movie won me over. Yes, it's about people with mental issues, but a subtle point of the film (which my judgmental friends didn't seem to get) is that EVERYONE is messed up, whether or not they admit to their disorders. It may take a while for this message to sink in, especially for those who tend to view the mental spectrum in black & white, but once you get it, this movie becomes a great experience in understanding the human psyche from all angles.Ok, if you made it past my opening 2 paragraphs, here's the fun part. 'Silver Linings Playbook' is a quirky, mostly lighthearted flick about 2 people who are each labeled as 'crazy' and their odd relationship. The humor is similar to something you'd see in a Wes Anderson flick (Rushmore, Royal Tenenbaums, Life Aquatic) or maybe even Jonze/Kaufmann (Being John Malkovich, Synecdoche NY). By that, I mean it's subtle without any big punchlines or slapstick gags. The sheer randomness and bizarreness of the characters' words, actions and reactions provide the comedy. So don't expect a lot of knee slappers, but at the same time there are a lot of funny lines that are very memorable.Also, even though I described this as a 'romcom', it's really not a romance or a comedy. It's more about the unique strangeness in all of us, set against the backdrop of romantic relationships. That's all you really need to know about the plot because it defies explanation. But I'll still attempt to sum it up in 1 sentence: A guy who has just been discharged from the nut house (Bradley Cooper) who is violently obsessed with winning back his ex-wife, befriends the 'town slut' (Jennifer Lawrence), and they begrudgingly team up in an attempt to get both their lives together.It's a great flick, probably best watched alone. Terrible first-date movie because it's not exactly your typical charming Hugh Grant type ice breaker. You probably won't want to watch it with your parents or kids either because there is a heavy, awkward sub-plot about dysfunctional family relationships. Definintely not a chick flick nor a bro flick (except that there's a lot about football, in a funny way). I would say watch it with your dog and have a great time.",8,0,0,17 June 2019
District 9," Best scifi satire since Starship Troopers
","There have been a few great scifi satires in the history of cinema: Robocop, Starship Troopers, Alphaville, Zardoz, Frankenhooker. The scifi genre is perfect for satire because it inherently brings a degree of fantasy and surrealism, setting the stage for anything-goes.You can choose to view District 9 as a straightforward action story. But I think its beauty lies in its social commentary which is done through hilarious satire, just like the aforementioned films. For starters, the 'hero' of the story is a sweater-vest-wearing nerd, not a musclebound, stone-jawed stud. This should be a tipoff that the presentation isn't meant to be taken literally; it's tongue-in-cheek. Next, we see that the movie takes on a 'mockumentary' feel, a lot like the great comedies Spinal Tap or Waiting for Guffman. Again this catches us off guard and encourages us to laugh at things that would otherwise be shocking.That's a good thing because the story, if seen beneath its thinly veiled metaphor for racial segregation and government sponsored apartheid in South Africa, would be pretty damn depressing. Enter the satire: the storytelling device through which we can tolerate such disturbing and shocking themes and still be entertained. Archie Bunker taught us this.Like I said, you can ignore everything I'm saying and instead enjoy this as an action flick; it has plenty of hair-raising, seat-gripping tension for that (and who couldn't love guns that make people explode like bloated sacks of ketchup?). But what sets this film above the average is its ability to combine its futuristic action & story with a very contemporary social problem. And it does this while giving us a fun ride.I have 2 minor gripes. One is that the nonstop barrage of sarcasm & dark satire can be very taxing after a while, like watching a 2-hour marathon of 'Everybody Loves Raymond', you eventually want to punch someone. My other gripe is that the shaky camera, while adding an interesting sense of realism, can eventually induce dizziness, vertigo and vomiting, especially when you're watching scenes of a guy acting dizzy, vertiginous and vomitous. Also, the scenes of meat lockers and hunks of putrid, unidentifiable flesh on the chopping block are enough to turn anyone vegetarian for an evening. Overall it can be an exhausting experience, definitely not your shiny, happy Spielberg fare (E.T. would crap his pants in this world), but I guess it was the director's intent to convey the disturbing conditions he himself was intimately acquainted with, having grown up in Johannesburg in the 80s. I do recommend that you familiarize yourself with South Africa's history if you really want to get the most out of this movie. Then you will see, as with Starship Troopers, that this is not a fantasy about spaceships and bug-eyed aliens, but rather, it's a very contemporary allegory about our own human fears & prejudices.",8,3,6,4 December 2010
Man on the Moon," Andy Kaufman was the P.T. Barnum of our time
","I was in high school during the Taxi years & heyday of Andy Kaufman, and all I remember are the sensational rumors about how he developed a split personality, became obsessed with wrestling women (jello wrestling, as I heard it), and publicly self-destructed before disappearing into obscurity (I never even knew he died). Of course, that's not how it happened, but that was the chatter you'd hear in the hallways between classes.This film is like the quintessential dispelling of a myth. Santa Claus is revealed, the Easter Bunny unmasked. Oddly enough, what we find beneath the shticky exterior is even more shticky than before. And we learn that the man was successful at what he did because he truly lived it.Doubtlessly, you've heard Kaufman admirers refer to him as a genius, ahead of his time, and all the other obligatory accolades that are heaped on a misunderstood artist. But for the first time, I now understand why all these things are true, and if you watch this movie--whether you love him or hate him--you too will understand why he the outrageous things that he did.Furthermore, this film may help give you an understanding of other bizarre artists. I'm beginning to appreciate what drives other avant-garde artists like Picasso, Godard & the Sex Pistols. But this is a lesson you'll never get in any documentary or art appreciation class. Here through comedy--the most un-pretentious art form--we can truly enjoy the madness without all the highbrow beard-stroking that often clouds the subject. Here we have it plain & simple, the cartoon version: the story of an artist who led a revolution.Watch this movie. Then go to YouTube and watch the original clips of Andy Kaufman ...his wrestling exploits, his bizarre appearances on Letterman, his strange but true reading of The Great Gatsby before a confused and peevish crowd. This movie is the long-awaited explanation of all the madness.I was expecting to see a depressing, tragic film about a young man's spiral into insanity and oblivion. Instead, I found the story of Andy Kaufman to be the ultimate victory, and I find myself strangely energized by the whole experience. The whole thing comes down to one laugh (in that powerful scene in the Philippines near the end). Laugh and the world laughs with you; cry ...and the world laughs with you :D",8,0,0,9 February 2010
Zulu," Almost a masterpiece
","'Introducing Michael Caine' alone is worth the price of admission. The stunning landscape and cinematography is worth another ticket. The powerful musical score is your 3rd ticket. Suspense+tension+drama... oh yeah you'll get your money's worth.In short, this is a powerful film that will entertain, excite and affect you. But it stops just shy of being an artistic masterpiece for one reason. Although it flirts with some deep philosophies, I didn't get the feeling that it wanted to go in that direction. So despite the stage being set for a profound epic like 'Aguirre the Wrath of God', this film may leave your soul unfulfilled.In particular, there were some intriguing themes introduced right at the beginning but not explored fully. Unlike the cartoonish cowboy & Indian films that Hollywood was cranking out in the 60s where whiteman=good & natives=evil, this film begins with a more objective angle showing the Zulu tribe to be human, intelligent, admirable and more honourable than any other warrior race while the British are (at first) shown to be arrogant, disrespectful and parasitic. The film lingers on this paradigm, but perhaps it would have been too progressive in 1964 to openly suggest that the native people deserved the land more (just as with cowboys & indians), so we never get fulfillment of this thought.A second interesting theme is that war is glorified butchery and nothing good comes of it. Again, this film flirts with that progressive message; however by midway, the principal character who advocates that stance is reduced to insane, irritating rants. So again, a powerful philosophy is buried. We do return to it later, but it is somewhat watered down.Instead of philosophy, we get some very suspenseful battle scenes, first class acting, and great cinematography showing a gorgeous landscape (with a magnificent soundtrack to go with it). So even though I'm a bit disappointed that the film dropped the ball on philosophy, I'm very impressed with the rest of the package.Michael Caine is riveting in a role unlike any other I've seen. His character is cold, cocky, pretentious & a real arse. But dang it, you end up loving him by the end of the film.I can't imagine that anyone would ever regret watching 'Zulu', so if you have a chance to see it (or buy it used at Blockbuster for $4 like I did), go for it.",7,5,11,20 February 2010
The Chorus," The most charming--and least believable--of the delinquent kid movies
","On a scale of charming, with 0 being 'Platoon' and 10 being 'E.T.' I'd say this ranks around an 8.On a scale of believable, with 0 being 'E.T.' and 10 being 'Platoon' I'd say this ranks around a 5.So there you have it, 'The Chorus' is squarely in the realm of 'E.T.' not 'Platoon'. And if you have 2 brain cells to rub together, you probably knew this long before you read this far. The only reason I'm making this point is in case you were expecting something a little more gritty like the excellent 'Dead Poets Society' (which, if you haven't yet seen, you must immediately flog yourself with a wet baton before seeing, pronto).'The Chorus' dives boldly into disturbing territory right at the outset with a scene containing some blood and another reference to suicide. My criticism is, instead of maintaining this malevolent air of drama (which would seem fitting of a corrupt 1940s reform school, every bit as formidable as the asylum in 'One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest'), the story instead flips into Disney territory. The dangerous juveniles who initially terrified us are instantly transformed into eager songbirds, reducing the initial drama to little more than a comedic gimmick. The story unfolds to reveal that the conflict of the story rests entirely upon the cartoonish villain, the headmaster.I felt that was the film's only letdown because the story seemed ripe to explore the complex transformation of criminals to chorusboys through the magic of music. While this did occur, it happened so suddenly that I felt like half the movie had been chopped. But if you can take this shift in stride, you'll have a great time. The kids are cute, and the music is uplifting. The presentation focuses more on comedy than hard hitting drama, so you can sit back, breathe easy and enjoy the ride.Personally I would've liked to see a bit more of a challenge in converting these juvenile delinquents, like maybe Antonio Banderas converting a bunch of NYC street thugs to twinkle toes dancers in 'Take the Lead', or Robin Williams in the aforementioned 'Dead Poets Society' struggling to draw the ultra conservative schoolboys out of their shells. To me, that is the draw of a story like this, but here the drama was more focused on the headmaster's antagonism. It might have worked better if the evil headmaster weren't shown to be such a bumbling fool who secretly throws paper airplanes around his room whilst standing on his desk. For that role, NOBODY comes close to Mr. Warfield in Jerry Lewis' 'Nutty Professor'.But enough with the comparisons, you're saying. Is this a good movie or a bad one? It's good, very good. So don't hesitate to watch it if you're in the mood for a nostalgic retrospective to bygone days of questionable education systems. 'The Chorus' is a nice film for anyone who isn't subconsciously comparing it to every troubled youth flick since 'The 400 Blows'. Dammit there I go again.",Null,0,0,20 April 2017
P.S. I Love You," If you're going to invest 126 mins of your time you should be prepared for a few things...
","Is it a 'romantic comedy' as the DVD box advertises? Dear lord no.
Is it a hard hitting drama about love, death and loss? At times it flirts with the idea, but ultimately... no.
Is it a sappy Hallmark Channel melodrama of the week? Sort of. But the A-list actors and impressive cinematography seem to demand more respect than that.
So what is it?Ultimately 'PS I Love You' is a decent way to spend 126 minutes of your time if you're in the mood for light romantic fare. The story is about a 30-year old woman (Hilary Swank) attempting to navigate the troubled waters of being a young widow after her perfect husband dies. Complicating matters, she begins receiving mysterious letters that had been apparently penned by her dying husband to be sent to her in regular installments, sort of leading her on an adventure of rediscovery. Yes, the plot is excellent, based on the novel by Cecelia Ahern. But as you may have guessed by my opening points, the execution is a bit uneven and ultimately disappointing, given the tremendous potential here.Hilary Swank definitely delivers with both breezy scenes as well as powerful, emotional scenes. But the film felt like it didn't want to showcase her dramatic talents as much as it wanted to keep things light-hearted and uncomplicated. I would have loved to see this film directed by someone like maybe Lasse Hallström (Chocolat, Cider House Rules, Safe Haven, Dear John) who really shines at these sorts of emotionally charged yet uplifting stories. Instead, directed by Richard LaGravenese who doesn't have much experience with feature length romance, 'PS I Love You' doesn't really have a strong identity. Watch it for the story, not for the presentation.One thing I definitely could have done without is the presence of Lisa Kudrow recycling her typecast role: a ditzy, 2-dimensional airhead with a bit of a mean streak, probably intended to make her edgy. Set against the excellent calibre of Hilary Swank and Kathy Bates (both of whom play deep, emotionally complex characters), Lisa Kudrow's 'Phoebe from Friends' character is way out of place and unnecessary. Her bizarre speech about how she's entitled to objectify men because they objectify her is way, way, wayy out of left field and should have ended up on the cutting room floor.",Null,0,0,26 January 2020
The Secret Life of Walter Mitty," Most insightful PG movie since 2001: A Space Odyssey
","OK, film buffs can call me out on this one... '2001: A Space Odyssey' was actually rated G. But you get what I mean. Sometime after the late 90s, G and PG (and even many PG13) movies became synonymous with Disney kid stuff, while if you wanted some depth and 'adult' fodder it generally came with a lot of disturbing, angsty, profane and graphically violent/sexual stuff. 'The Secret Life of Walter Mitty' is a great throwback to films geared at adults, provoking deep thought, while remaining firmly family-friendly.I'm not sure why that's so significant I had to open my review with it, but maybe you'll get the gist. This is a film that tells a simple story without flashy, gritty plot sensations, and yet it doesn't treat you like you're an idiot for watching a PG movie. And although I'm something of a cynical old geezer, I'm sure kids can enjoy it and find just as much meaning as I did.Walter Mitty is a dork. Not quite a loser because he has a good job and is quite capable, but, well, the opening scene of him struggling for 5 minutes to click a 'wink' button on a dating site ought to tell you he's not exactly captain of the football team.From there we learn that he has an odd habit of zoning out in his own fantasy world because obviously his real life bores him (and everyone around him) to tears. But that doesn't last long. Suddenly a bizarre mystery appears, and as you may have guessed from the trailers and movie posters, the film involves dorky Walter (Ben Stiller) trekking across continents and doing battle with all sorts of disasters as well as drunk Icelandic pilots.There's also a mild romance brewing (so he wishes) between himself and his coworker Cheryl (Kristen Wiig), but this is not a formulaic romcom. It's really about trying to get the most out of life. And whether you're a middle aged career schmoe like Walter, or I dunno, a punk rocker or a soccer mom, the message will appeal to you because it's about finding adventure everywhere it exists.The humor keeps things rolling nicely, but don't expect anything zany like Ben Stiller's earlier 'The Cable Guy' and 'Zoolander' or really any of his films. This movie is basically a serious tale, complete with nice artistic touches and GORGEOUS cinematography, peppered with Stiller's quirky tongue-in-cheek humor the whole way.I have to add a word about the music. Oh the soundtrack kills. If you are versed in the 80s classics like Hall & Oates 'Maneater', Rupert Holmes 'The Pina Colada Song', and a great appearance of David Bowie's 'Space Oddity' you will love the tunes. There's also a modern classic or two, such as Of Monsters and Men 'Dirty Paws'. Something for everyone.I was really impressed with Ben Stiller's directoral maturity and the way he kept things fresh and breezy despite this being a serious soul-searcher. In that respect I was reminded of one of my favorite directors Wim Wenders (his later films such as 'Million Dollar Hotel' and 'Lisbon Story'). There's also, as I mentioned, a quirky tongue-in-cheek attitude throughout, reminding me of Paul Thomas Anderson's 'Punch Drunk Love'.'The Secret Life of Walter Mitty' is well worth the price of admission. Take your kids. Or kids, take your parents. There's something for everyone.",8,1,2,6 November 2015
Across the Universe," Moments of sheer brilliance. Moments of sheer stupid.
","This film is one of the most bipolar cinematic experiences I've had since George Lucas's 1971 minimalist masterpiece THX-1138 was recut with goofy CGI inserts.First let's talk about the main gimmick of 'Across the Universe': it's a musical using modern remakes of Beatles songs. Some of these new versions, along with very compelling, bold and surreal visuals, are sheer poetry which I'm sure the fab 4 themselves would applaud. But then suddenly get a random toe tapper, full of melodramatic yet sterile vocals (you can hear the auto-tune working overtime) that have no place in the story but for some hastily contrived subplot to serve as a setup for a Beatles crowd pleaser. Yes, I'm talking about the cringeworthy 'Dear Prudence' where a minor character with only 10 lines in the whole film randomly locks herself in a bathroom until everyone sings her to come out because the character's name is? Prudence.On the other hand, I loved Bono's bizarre, humorous and wittily fitting appearance as 'Doctor Robert', a self-proclaimed electric messiah who apparently comes to parties with his own personal PA system (or is it a Mr. Microphone cranked to 11?) as he sings to the crowd's orgasmic oohs, 'I Am the Walrus'.Another highlight is a very simple, touching and heart-rending version of 'Let It Be' sung by a young African-American boy in the middle of the violent race riots and police brutality of Detroit 1960s.If these last 2 examples are any indication (and there are many more), the talented director Julie Taymor gave some of these songs the red carpet treatment and put them in the most provocative, social and historical context.But then suddenly there's a really sappy and unnecessary 5 minutes of 'I Want to Hold Your Hand' that has no bearing on culture, history or even the plot.The plot itself is nothing special, but set against the backdrop of the 60s and the domestic unrest over the Vietnam War, it becomes powerful. It's a simple boy-meets-girl story but with tons of quirky characters in the mix (one for every song, and I believe there are 33 songs). My gripe with the plot is that it flirts with making powerful statements about the 60s peace movement, but just when you think it's something you can sink your teeth into, it falls to an inane, predictable romcom cliché, like a misunderstanding because they don't spend enough time together, blah blah blah. (This is one of the moments of 'sheer stupid'.)But then, lo and behold, the story shifts to a brilliantly satirical hospital scene with (Vietnam vet) Joe Anderson and (buxom nurse) Salma Hayek singing 'Happiness Is A Warm Gun.' Thus the needle tips back to 'sheer brilliance'.Ultimately I enjoyed this film. It's a worthwhile ride, and the talents of the actors and filmmakers are unquestionable. I just found myself periodically irritated by cheap gimmicks to sell a song or two, and I wish those parts could have been edited out, because otherwise I would've raved about what a great film this would've been.As it stands, my favorite Beatles remake musical remains 'Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band' featuring the excellent music of The Bee Gees (pre-disco) as well as other fantastic musicians (Earth Wind & Fire, Alice Cooper, Peter Frampton, and who can forget the awesome finale by the 5th Beatle himself, the late great Billy Preston).",Null,0,0,10 March 2019
I Am Legend," The best version of the novel... ya gotta love the dog.
","From Vincent Price in 'The Last Man on Earth' (1964) to Charleton Heston in 'The Omega Man' (1971) to Will Smith in 'I Am Legend' (2007), each version has had its strengths in telling the age old story of the human race being wiped out. But for my money, this was the best. Here's why.In all three versions, the focus is on the last man on earth--in particular, his psyche in dealing with the crushing emptiness of being the last of an extinct race. Vincent Price's character is focused primarily on survival with only momentary episodes of deep reflection. Heston takes it a step further and displays the subtle yet poignant degradation of a plagued mind, more in line with the cryptic meaning of the book's title 'I Am Legend' which we only realize after contemplating the ending. Here, Will Smith knocks it out of the park with a tremendous performance, making this version as much a psychological thriller as it is an action story.In particular, we watch with deep empathy as he creates a world of imaginary people, having emotional conversations with inanimate objects. Smith plays a scene with a wax dummy that may bring you to tears... can't say I've ever seen an actor do that before (barring maybe Erich von Stroheim in the 1929 classic 'The Great Gabbo').Even better, the filmmakers saw fit to make one small but significant addition to the cast of characters: a dog. Smith's connection with his canine co-star is by far one of the most powerful displays of the human-animal bond that I've seen in any movie. If you're a dog lover, you should watch it for that bit alone. Beyond that, it demonstrates our hero's critical need for companionship, something that all humans would require just as much as food or water. And that's why this version is particularly affecting.This film also goes further into the meaning of the title 'I Am Legend', although it's still a challenge to figure it out. There is an alternate ending which, I think, explains this theme a little more clearly. I'm torn on which ending I like best. Just be sure to check out both if you see the movie, since they are very different.In all, I don't see this as a straightforward action flick. To me, it's a great psychological character study augmented with lots of action. And like I said, the acting is absolutely 1st class. If you like movies that pack a little more substance beneath the surface, don't miss this one.",Null,1,3,1 October 2014
Children of Men," Careful choreography & camera-work bring this 2-dimensional story to life
","The strength of this film is not in its plot but in its presentation. The story is pretty basic: in a dismal future where humans are infertile and hopeless, an unlikely hero fights to survive & protect one small hope of humanity. The plot is set in the beginning and remains pretty linear, but pay attention to the excellent camera work which sets this film apart from your regular dismal future action flick.In particular, the director uses long fluid takes. Like up to 5 minutes without a cut (in actuality there are some cuts but they're digitally blended together seamlessly so the effect remains continuous. In the commentary, the director says he did this to give the audience a sense of real time. And yes, it's very effective, as if you're there in the middle of the action watching things unfold second-by-second.To achieve this, the director had to go through extraordinary efforts. For example, in order to film a car chase with simultaneous dialogue from 5 people inside the car, he had to build a special car with a hole in the roof & camera crew on top so the camera could pan, twist & move through every angle necessary. Meanwhile the action of dozens of extras outside (not to mention fire & explosives) had to be carefully timed & choreographed to fit with the dialogue.In another memorable scene, again seemingly consisting of one continuous take with no cuts, the action begins in the street under intense gunfire, the camera follows our hero running down several side streets, into a bus, into a building, up a flight of stairs, down the hall, up another flight of stairs and through a bunch of rooms, all the while with scores of extras running around and shooting hundreds of bullets--all in one fluid camera take.Folks this is no ordinary action flick. It's a complex work of movie-making excellence. If you enjoy the sort of technical stuff I've been babbling about, you'll really enjoy the presentation. I haven't seen such meticulous camera work in an action flick since 'The International' and 'Run Lola Run' directed by German genius Tom Tykwer.",7,4,7,26 January 2013
Garden State," 'True Stories from Suburbia'
","'Garden State' has a very specific brand of humor that not everyone is going to get immediately. But as writer/director/star Zach Braff says in the bonus interview, 'Is it funny? {Interviewer says yeah} Good. I never know if anyone else is going to find them funny. If nothing else, I'm making a movie that I'll enjoy.'And that's why this movie works. In comedy, the worst thing you can do is try too hard to be funny. 'Garden State' falls squarely in subtle, almost deadpan territory... meaning there aren't any big sight gags, slapstick or knockout punchlines. In that respect I'd put it in the genre of 'movies like Bill Murray would act in' except there's no Bill Murray. I'm referring to flicks like Coffee & Cigarettes, Rushmore, Royal Tenenbaums, Life Aquatic, which is essentially saying it's like a Wes Anderson film, or maybe Terry Zwigoff (Ghost World, Art School Confidential). There's a lot of visual storytelling, as in quirky symmetrical shots, stationary cameras on meticulously arranged sets, or a surreal vibe punctated by the camera slowly rising into the sky.The story is something like famed French existentialist Albert Camus would write if he did comedy. A late-20s, emotionless, estranged son (Zach Braff) returns to his hometown to bury his mother. He seems devoid of all sentimentality as he wanders around meeting all sorts of crazy (and I mean crazy) characters from his past. Whether he's being nearly shot to death by an overenthusiastic cop, or molested by a hot blonde at a party, his range of emotion barely budges between bored and slightly perplexed. Then he meets his antithesis, a 20-something girl (Natalie Portman) whose range of emotion is somewhere between very amused and insanely happy.It's the delightful contrast between these 2 characters, and their great on-screen chemistry, that turns an otherwise brooding sarcastic comedy into a really entertaining treat.Another thing that really defines this film is the way every character, even the minor ones who only have 1 scene, are so bizarre and interesting that you feel like an entire movie spinoff could be made of each one. These characters include: 1) the grave digger who makes his real living by doing questionable things at the hardware store; 2) the grave digger's hot mom who is sleeping with her son's sworn enemy from high school; 3) the kid who got rich from inventing 'silent velcro' and who now spends his time doing absolutely nothing; 4) the West African immigrant who is studying criminal justice and is obsessed with figuring out which dog is pissing on his phone; 5) the strange 'Guardian of the Abyss' whom I won't spoil for you; and the list goes on.The second half of the story focuses on a bizarre suburban quest the 3 main characters undertake, almost like in 'Stand by Me' but with grownups and maybe a pornographic peepshow or two (btw the location of the climactic scene, 'Kiernan's Quarry', is a real place--or at least it was until it got filled in & converted to condos a few years ago).But as strange and nonsensical as it sounds, these are in fact 'true stories from suburbia' as Zach Braff says. The entire film is a compilation of stories that happened to him and others in his small Jersey town growing up. 'Garden State' has a magical way of bringing these seemingly random vignettes to our attention, making us understand the epic nature of obscurity.So no, there may not be crazy car chases, bank heists or wacky jewel capers (...oh wait, actually there sorta is 1 wacky jewel caper), this film delivers a really entertaining ride from start to finish.",Null,1,1,30 March 2018
"Good Night, and Good Luck."," Good night, and Good Movie.
","Check out this clever message: the film opens with a scene of Ed Murrow at a festive party, delivering a real Debbie-Downer of a speech about the duty and failure of TV. In the speech he accuses television (news in particular) of catering to the fat & happy, dumbing down reality for the sake of entertainment. He calls for television instead to educate, provoke and expose the world for its flaws, ugly or boring as they may be.'Good night, and good luck' does exactly what Murrow prescribes. The movie itself is not what I'd call entertaining. Definitely not like Oceans 11, 12, 13 or any of the other blockbuster hits of recent years. Instead it's a fascinating, enlightening and sobering history lesson which is particularly important to re-visit today.Director George Clooney takes us on a powerful ride through a world where the government has total, unquestionable control over the fates of individuals, and those who speak out against it do so at their own risk. Sounds like some Orwellian dystopia? Well it really happened in the US of A, barely 50 years ago. And it may be happening again.That's all I'll say as far as socio-political commentary. After all we're here to talk movies. And what a movie this is. While I can't say it's a crowd pleaser, I think it's masterfully crafted with excellent dialogue, effective camera angles & movements that add to the tension, and great acting all around. The whole movie is in b&w but it's not just a gimmick. Not only does it transport us back to the time period (mid 1950s), but it allows for the smooth blending of actual stock footage from the McCarthy hearings. Apparently the blending was so smooth that initially some people criticized the 'actor' playing Sen McCarthy as being too over-the-top. Haha, it's the real dude, folks.I watched this movie without knowing who directed it, and for a long time I could've sworn it was Steven Soderbergh ('Traffic', 'Solaris', and particularly 'The Informant!') with its meticulous, clean shots. Not much of a surprise to learn that it was Clooney who has starred in half a dozen Soderbergh films, his likely protégé.The music can only be described as 'cool', featuring a jazz combo and the talented singing of Dianne Reeves who, in a surreal studio fly-by, is shown performing on the CBS soundstage, putting the music in a nice perspective.If you like strong historical films, particularly focusing on scandals or underdogs of 20th century America like 'Quiz Show', 'Tucker', 'The Hoax', or the aforementioned 'The Informant!' then don't hesitate to check this out. It's probably the most tense & claustrophobic of the bunch, strangely reminding me of 'Das Boot' (a 5-hr film about a bunch of Nazis stuck in a submarine). Maybe the b&w presentation had me fooled, but I was also reminded of the b&w masterpieces 'Citizen Kane' (about the questionable success of a very William R Hearst-like character) and maybe even 'Dr. Strangelove' (a dark satire about the atomic bomb and America's postwar paranoia).There aren't any car chases, shootouts, damsels in distress, romantic hook ups, nude scenes, blood & guts, swearing or big laughs in this film. It's rated PG, but the irony is I can't imagine too many teenagers wanting to see it. Nonetheless, it's a well-made, dramatic, important film and a dose of medicine I recommend to everyone.",8,1,1,2 May 2013
Mulholland Drive," Here's why David Lynch is a bad director
","My review for this movie is the same for every other Lynch movie I've seen (and like a masochistic fool who doesn't know when to quit, I have seen many). As Roger Ebert wrote, Lynch's work is 'sophomoric satire and cheap shots. The director is either denying the strength of his material or trying to defuse it by pretending it's all part of a campy in-joke.'I used to have a friend who couldn't carry a tune. Once in a while he would try, and immediately we would all start laughing at him. At that point, my friend would deliberately start singing off key, as if to say, 'uh, I MEANT to sound bad!' This is David Lynch syndrome. His plots are often juvenile & simplistic, and his dialogue is goofy. But then--afraid of his audience laughing at him--he deliberately takes a satirical, sarcastic tone of film-making. It's as if to say, 'uh, I MEANT for that scene to look ridiculous.' Next he hides behind supercilious gimmickry like symbolism. Sure, symbolism is cool (that's why I love Kurosawa), but symbolism without substance is just babble. Back to the analogy of my musically-challenged friend, this is like hiding his poor singing skills behind a lot of big arm gestures and fancy footwork.In Mullholland Drive he weaves a web of such convoluted symbolism that many people are dazzled like deer in the headlights. But don't be fooled folks. My advice to you is the same as my advice to the deer: RUN.So enough already. Davy boy, please get the tongue-out-of-cheek, drop the schlock and give us a serious, genuine effort. Sure, some people will laugh at you. Some people will call you juvenile and silly. But that doesn't matter. What *does* matter is how confidently you can express yourself. Listen to Bob Dylan sing. Watch Arnold Schwartzenegger speak. These people sound awful; yet they present themselves with enough confidence (lack of sarcasm & cynicism) that we, the audience, must admire them for their authenticity.When you learn that simple lesson, Davy boy, then you will have graduated to the level of 'artist'. Until then, you're just a kid with a camera, trying to be something he isn't.Now to all you people who love Lynch because he's weird & different & non-Hollywood. I agree, he is. But why stop at Lynch? Go all the way. Check out the films of Godard, Kobayashi, Fellini, or (as much as I personally hate him) Peter Greenaway. And I highly recommend the early films of Jeunet/Caro like 'Bunker of the Last Gunshots' or 'City of Lost Children'. These are films that are weird without TRYING to be weird. Know what I mean?

","I have no idea what my title means, except that it sounded clever in my head. Hmm.I'll assume that you've already seen the original Saw and you're wondering if this is a worthy successor. In a word: yeah. But it's a very different approach. While the first Saw was brilliantly minimalistic, the story being staged almost entirely in one room, this second installment takes us out of the box. Gone is the claustrophobic feeling of confusion and good ole existentialistic 'who am I' from the original, and instead we get more of a mystery as seen from the outside, as our hero Eric (Donnie Wahlberg) tries to crack the case before it's too late.Sure, the same elements existed in the first film, with 2 concurrent plots of victim & detective. But the draw of the first was to figure out why all these things are happening. Here the mystery is revealed in the first few minutes, the killer is apprehended, and what follows is a sort of chess game between investigator Eric and perp Jigsaw with the clock ticking to save the intended victims. It's actually a clever approach similar to the rather AWESOME film 'Exorcist III' (1990) which is composed of dark dialogues between the detective and the lunatic, and this dramatic approach was repeated a year later in the more popular 'Silence of the Lambs' (1991). But in this domain, in order for it to work, the film must be slow, almost painfully slow, thick and heavy.Saw II attempts to balance the heavy, psychological 'Lambs' approach with good old fashioned slashes & gore. It succeeds, I feel. But I still can't help but wonder how it would've been if the filmmakers had gone full tilt 'Lambs' on us. Instead the dialogues between Eric & Jigsaw seem a bit short, rushed and not fully explored.The result is a film which is certainly entertaining, but I don't think it will ever be considered a psychological classic like the other two I mentioned, or like 'Seven'--films that are much slower in pace, with far fewer gallons of blood spilled but with oceans of drama.I know this may sound like a negative review, but that's only because I'm comparing Saw II to the heavyweights. If instead we take Saw II at face value, a straightforward horror flick, it certainly delivers. There's the added bonus of having two nice twists at the end. In terms of sheer entertainment value, Saw II cuts a real log.I should really quit trying to come up with witty puns.",Null,0,0,16 December 2015
Clash of the Titans," An entertaining and action-packed movie, but don't study for your Classical Lit exam with this
","'Clash of the Titans' (2010) provided everything its cover image and trailer promise, except for the part about authentic Greek Mythology, but if you can get past that you'll have a good time. The draw of the film is fast paced, adrenaline pumping action, a lot of tough guys & gals who never smile, and really cool monsters and special effects for 2010.It's rated PG-13 for some violence and gore, and there is no sexuality, nudity or profanity (except 1 awesome use of the word b*tch). The 'violence and gore' is shot very fast, so even though it depicts people being ripped in half & such, it's not quite as disturbing as, say, a Quentin Tarantino film where you watch a guy slowly bleed to death for 15 mins. In other words, this is good stuff to watch with your teenage kids or puritanical parents, either way.There are some big names on the cast, and all performances were solid, but nothing really stood out as remarkable. That is to be expected in a fast paced film. But I would have preferred a powerful monologue or two just to use the talent to its full potential. I will say Ralph Fiennes did a chillingly original portrayal of 'Hades', making him to be a twisted, limping, bitter wretch who still possessed terrifying power and fury. He is definitely my favorite part of the production.Now on to the bad, which others have covered in detail so I'll just graze over. If you think you can study for your Classical Literature exam by watching this, you're going to get flunked all the way back to James Whale's 1931 'Frankenstein' (the most successful yet inaccurate adaptation of literature ever). Different characters in mythology seem to have been transposed, juxtaposed and just plain posed for the sake of this 2010 story. The biggest liberty is that here our hero Perseus is fighting against the gods when the original literature shows that he was tremendously helped by the gods by being given special weapons and gifts. In this film he is given those same gifts which he indignantly refuses but then later sheepishly accepts them because they'll save his life. I'm not sure if that was meant to be hypocritical, ironic, or just a sloppy oversight in the screenplay, but it's worth noting. Just what exactly is this film saying below the surface? That humans have outgrown gods? Or that we ultimately still need gods?But for the most part, this gives us a decent taste of Greek Mythology which was truly the origin of the timeless scifi/fantasy/horror genre thousands of years ago. Chances are, most people will simply enjoy this movie for its action, fantasy and special effects. For that, yes, it delivers. But for literary accuracy... well I would be terrified to approach any literature teacher with the mere mention of this movie. That teacher would kick my Assaracus out of school and I'd be crying all the way Homer.",Null,1,1,15 May 2016
Charlie and the Chocolate Factory," Not as intellectual as the original
","If you have already seen the 1971 classic, I believe you will hate this version. Tim Burton has taken a children's story and produced just that: a children's story. But those of you familiar with the original Willie Wonka will agree that it was really a very adult movie, full of Shakespeare (mis)quotes, subtle references to Rachmaninoff (which was actually Mozart! heh heh) and of course the infamous chicken decapitation. You'll get none of that here. Instead you'll get a lot of CGI special effects, some slapstick gags and a few showtunes. You know, stuff that the kids might enjoy.You will invariably find yourself comparing Johnny Depp to Gene Wilder, and I must say--even though Johnny Depp may be the finest actor of his generation--he's no Gene Wilder. In fact in this role I'd say he laid a rotten egg. In his efforts to portray a squeaky-clean, plastic caricature of a human, he went too far and sacrificed character development. We care nothing for the new Willie Wonka, for he is not even human any more than Michael Jackson is (and what's with the annoying Teletubbies voice he uses?). Beyond that, the mediocre dialogue and weak jokes aren't enough to carry our interest further.For me, though, the worst part of the movie was something many people may overlook. The music was awful! Danny Elfman, who wrote the classic tunes for 'Nightmare Before Christmas' as well as the playful 'Peewee Herman' soundtrack and the majestic orchestration for 'Batman', has churned out an utter flop for this film. The musical numbers are embarrassingly silly with lyrics that are as predictable as they are stupid. And his attempts at writing grunge and techno are just... well... bad. I would prefer 90 minutes of 'Cheer Up Charlie' to this lame stuff.Am I glad I saw this film? No. Do I wish I had the last 2 hours of my life back? Yes. But if some good has come of this disappointing experience, it's that I now appreciate the original even more. Tim Burton, if you're listening... please, no more remakes! I though you had learned your lesson with Planet of the Apes.",3,1,4,5 February 2006
The Dark Knight," One of the rare Hollywood blockbusters that's worth the hype
","I'm speaking to those of us who don't like superhero movies, who resent the cookie cutter, moneymaking Hollywood clichÃ©s that dominate the art, and who find themselves generally irritated at movies & tv shows that the guy in the cubicle next to you at work is constantly raving about while you're trying to meet a deadline. Check out 'The Dark Knight'. It deserves the hype.Largely due to the gripping performance by Heath Ledger (who reportedly buried himself in the part so deep that it contributed to his tragic young demise), this is no ordinary superhero flick. Propelled by dark themes, profound questions about the ugliness of the human soul, and complex portrayals of madness in both good & bad people, this film finally offers the superhero genre something worth thinking (literally, *thinking*) about. The beauty is that it can also be enjoyed as a straightforward crowd pleasing action flick. It balances the line perfectly.The power of this story lies in an unlikely trio of characters: of a hero with a dark side (Batman), a deranged & violent criminal who is so quirkily charming that we almost see him as a good guy (Ledger as The Joker), and a third character who straddles the balance (I won't ruin it). It all comes to a poignant statement, punctuated with a gripping climax involving a moral quandary that poses the question: does humanity suck so bad that it will kill itself?Stick around and find out.There are other great films in the superhero genre that take a different approach, like 'Hancock' (a drunk, dysfunctional hero), 'Special' (an incompetent dreamer who fancies himself a superhero), and on the disturbing side 'Super' (a vigilante hero who goes too far). Here in The Dark Knight we explore the anti-hero angle more subtlely, and that's what allows it to seep in under your skin.I haven't seen the other two Christopher Nolan installments of Batman (Batman Begins & The Dark Knight Rises), but even if you start here with the 2nd one The Dark Knight, it stands on its own as a classic.",8,0,1,24 July 2019
2001: A Space Odyssey," If only one film makes it off this planet, it should be 2001.
","If the Earth was about to blow up and I could choose only 1 film to survive us, it would definitely be this. What's funny is '2001' isn't even my favourite movie. But I believe it tells the story of humankind better than anything else I've ever seen on the big screen. Essentially it asks the age old question 'what is the meaning of life?', and for my money, it provides a very satisfying answer.What makes it such a phenomenal work of art is that it is able to address some of the most divisive, incompatible human attitudes (in particular, religion) and present us with a model that we ALL can accept. Judeo-Christians, Muslims, Hindus, Scientologists, Fundamentalists, Existentialists, Atheists and even Satanists can find truth in this film because it applies no labels. Like the mysterious yet commanding 'black box' that appears in the film, it remains exactly that: a sealed black box which can be anything we choose to see.The black box may represent God. Or it may represent science. Or it may represent history. Or it may represent individuality. Make up your own mind, and you will learn a little something of yourself. Really, this movie is like a puzzle with infinite solutions, designed to teach us about ourselves by what we see in it. It's truly interactive. No other film has ever made me feel this way.The plot is almost irrelevant, so I won't bother summarizing. What you should pay attention to are the themes and questions the movie addresses.1) Are we alone in the universe? 2) Is there a point to life? 3) Are we heading in the right direction?By the time the movie ends, you should have an answer to all three, and yet all our answers will be different.SO WHAT THE HECK IS THE MOVIE ABOUT? OK, since you've read this far, I'll give you an idea. The movie is about evolution. Not just your Darwinian natural selection stuff, but a compelling proposal that evolution was (or continues to be?) guided by some extraordinary force. If you like, this is the marriage of God & science that we've all been waiting for. Or if you like, it's a testament to pure science. Or pure God. Like I said, Kubrick allows for every possibility. And I have to hand it to him for remaining so tight-lipped that nobody ever knew what his personal feelings were on the matter.The film starts in prehistoric times with a tribe of moribund ape-like creatures on the edge of either extinction or excellence. Then we jump ahead a million years or so to find humans in a similar state of stagnation yet on the edge of another fantastic evolutionary step forward. Finally we jump forward to catch a glimpse of what evolution may have in store for us in the not-too-distant future. If it sounds like a documentary, I suppose it almost is, except without Marlon Perkins talking over it. We are expected to fill in the details ourselves, and that is the beauty of what this film does. It takes a purely objective approach and manages to lead us to our own satisfying conclusions.A word of caution. I don't think you're supposed to 'get' this film on one viewing. I certainly didn't, and I've never met anyone who did. Even Roger Ebert (who ranks this as the greatest film of all time) was initially lukewarm about it when it premiered in '68. So if you feel like you just got cheated, or if you have no idea what everyone's raving about, please be patient and give it some time to sink in. I saw this movie when I was 16 and loved the middle part but hated the ending. Decades later I saw it again and suddenly understood it better. But I confess there's still a lot I haven't realized. I suppose as I get older and hopefully wiser I'll continue to interpret new ideas. And that's why this is the greatest movie of all time. It is about evolution, and moreso it EVOLVES WITH US.",10,47,82,25 January 2012
Alice in Wonderland," Call me Mad, but I Hatter really good time.
","The setup of this movie sounds like the beginning of a good joke: 'Tim Burton and Walt Disney walk into a bar...' You wouldn't think it possible, but it happened. Tim Burton, the master of dark, twisted fantasies where every story involves at least 1 corpse, teamed up with the studio known for bright pink bunnies and such.The temptation is for Burton fans to expect a Burtonesque flick while Disney fans expect an accurate retelling of the 1951 Disney cartoon classic. Neither happened, not by a longshot.What happened instead is something you just have to experience. Someone once told me that the root of beauty lies in contrast. A yellow flower in a field of yellow flowers isn't as beautiful as a yellow flower growing on a desolate battlefield of some war-torn desert. So with that in mind, this is a movie for people who can appreciate the contrast between Burton's sarcasm and Disney's innocence. I'll give you an example...In the Disney cartoon, as well as Lewis Carroll's original story, the Red Queen runs around commanding 'Off with his head!' at anyone who irritates her, but of course the Red King quietly follows behind whispering 'You're pardoned' each time, thus saving the executioner a ton of gory axe blades. But in this version, in a brief but stark moment, we learn that the beheadings are quite real. And then bam, we quickly return to Disney territory where we are entertained by the banter of cute talking mice.Literally, I rubbed my eyes, turned to the person sitting next to me and asked, 'Wait... did we just see a bunch of decapitated heads??' Confusing at first, this volley between macabre & merry becomes the charm of this film. I should add that I counted at least 3 characters who got an eyeball disgorged. And yet, in Disneyesque fashion you never really feel a sense of menace; it's mostly in good fun.I purposely didn't mention the plot until now because, to me, the story was secondary to the overall vibe of the film. But in case you're wondering, this is *not* a retelling of Disney's, Carroll's or anyone else's 'Alice in Wonderland'. This is sort of a sequel to the original where Alice, now 19 years old and about to get married, gets reconnected with her long forgotten adventure of youth. In that respect, it reminded me of how the movie 'Hook' was sort of a sequel to 'Peter Pan'.To me, that's the only department where this film lost a few points, because it felt like they were weaving too much of a story into a tale that was inherently a stream-of-consciousness that mimicked the randomness of a dream (Lewis Carroll himself invented the story on the spot while rowing Alice Pleasance Liddell and her sisters on a pond). This version follows more of a straighforward plot to defeat the bad guys, and in so doing, it got away from the dreamlike feeling of all other versions I've seen.Johnny Depp... of course JD steals the show with his alternately endearing and terrifying Mad Hatter. He plays the role as someone suffering from severe PTSD which manifests itself in multiple personalities. There's his normal, gentle, lisping Hatter. And then there's his cruel, dark Scottish Highlander Hatter who sounds like Sean Connery just lost his place in line at the Department of Motor Vehicles.Honorable mention goes to Crispin Glover (Marty McFly's nerdy father in 'Back to the Future') who plays a very chilling Jack of Hearts. And another honorable mention goes to Anne Hathaway who plays the angelic but somewhat ditzy White Queen.Special effects are good for 2010 but a bit dated for today. The best effects are the subtle ones such as the way the Red Queen (Helena Bonham Carter) was depicted as having an enormous, bulbous head. I also thought the 'Drink Me, Eat Me' scene where Alice shrinks & grows was done very well.In the end, although I had been expecting something of a trainwreck, I think the odd pairing of Burton & Disney was a success. So what's next? Maybe horror master John Carpenter ('Halloween') does a teencom with Lindsay Lohan & Jamie Lee Curtis called 'Freaky Friday the 13th'?",Null,0,1,22 February 2017
Saw," Silence of the Lambs + Mythbusters = Win
","Horror films like this may be old hat today, but I think we should dedicate a moment of silence to honor what may have been the first of its kind. OK, enough silence, let's get back to blood curdling screams.'Saw' distinguished itself from the usual 90s-00s horror tosh by taking a pseudo intellectual approach as in classics like 'Silence of the Lambs' or 'The Cell' where the killer is not just a mindless hockey goalie on a bad day with power tools. The killer has a distinct, logical, stylish modus operandi that will appeal to people who know the meaning of the word 'modus operandi'. If you don't, or if you don't care, there's still plenty of suspense, action and blood & guts (literally) to keep you entertained from start to finish.'Saw' is the story of a serial killer who is highly intelligent, highly resourceful (some of the diabolical devices he builds could be featured on Mythbusters), and most interestingly the killer is driven by a twisted sense of morality. This brings to mind the mother of all serial-killer-morality tales 'Seven' which Saw undoubtedly drew inspiration from. While I don't think 'Saw' is in league with 'Seven', it does a great job of keeping up, and I think it's worth a watch.Danny Glover ('Lethal Weapon') playing the obsessed cop on a manhunt and Cary Elwes (I'll always remember him from 'The Princess Bride') playing the intelligent victim, raise the bar with their excellent, characteristic performances. And while the story may have 1 or 2 loopholes, you can handily overlook them in light of these two iconic actors and a story that unravels suspensefully at every turn.I did want to mention one thing for the squeamish (as well as those of you who crave the squeam), 'Saw' isn't as over-the-top disgusting as I had been told. Yes, there's a ton of blood and a few hurl worthy scenes of bad things happening to body parts, but for the most part it's somewhat tame by today's standards. I actually like that, because it's a film I can recommend to my mom. The lack of nudity/sex and the interesting morality angle furthermore might make it a family-safe film. If your family happens to live at 1313 Mockingbird Lane. But you catch my drift.",Null,1,3,11 October 2015
The Legend of 1900," Good movie, but it doesn't give the audience enough credit
","Ever heard someone tell a great joke, then ruin it by explaining the punch line even though you got it the first time? That's the feeling I kept getting throughout this film. Don't get me wrong, it's a good movie well worth watching. But the director's habit of over-explaining things kept making me wonder if he thinks we're all idiots.For example, there's a really cool scene where 2 pianists have a duel. Pianist #1 plays something amazing. Pianist #2 duplicates it note-for-note. It was almost a perfect scene except the director felt the need to have some extras in the audience yelling, 'He's playing the same thing! The exact same thing!'Another example would be during the same scene when one pianist breaks into a taunting version of 'Silent Night'. It was a funny moment, but again those stupid extras start yelling, 'Haha, he's playing 'Silent Night'!!'Whenever anyone plays something impressive we get those same unnecessary commentaries from peripheral characters, essentially telling the audience, 'Ok, you're supposed to be impressed here.' In that vein, the whole production struck me as being very operatic... meaning characters exaggerate reactions and emotions for the sake of giving the audience cues. Reminded me of a Kenneth Branaugh film. If you like em that way, then no problem. But if you prefer films on the subtle side (Kubrick, Bergman, Kieslowski), you might start to get distracted by this film's overtness.THE FILM'S SAVING GRACE... is the incomparable Tim Roth. He offsets the melodrama of the characters around him with his calm, sober portrayal of the guy who knows it all yet has seen nothing. Roth plays the central character, a man who has lived his entire life within the bowels of a boat. And he pulls it off with amazing authenticity.The film's final 15 minutes are where Roth really shines, and the director gives him every opportunity to do so with no distractions (no music, dark set with only faces illuminated, nice slow pacing so the dialogue can breathe). When it was all over, I could forgive the minor flaws mentioned above, and I came away impressed and fulfilled.I definitely recommend '1900' if you liked the films 'Copying Beethoven', 'Shine' and of course 'Cinema Paradiso'... It has the same polished style. In many ways it also reminded me of the Herzog film 'Invincible', a movie that similarly comes across as a little overdone, but as soon as Roth appears everything falls into place.",7,1,3,5 October 2012
Groundhog Day," A famous movie critic was asked what movie deserves to last 100 years, and he said 'Groundhog Day'
","A famous movie critic (who evidently wasn't famous enough for me to remember his name, sorry folks) picked 'Groundhog Day' as the film most deserving to speak for our society 100 years from now. Director Harold Ramis humbly mentions this in the DVD interview before playing off the honor as essentially a happy mistake. He had no intent or expectation of making anything greater than a whimsical fantasy romcom. He definitely succeeded at making a wonderful romcom, but the more I think about it, the movie critic has a great point and if this flick is indeed the only 20th century film to survive a zombie apocalypse or two, hey I'm not complaining.Cleverly disguised as a breezy fantasy what-if comedy, 'Groundhog Day' gives us a provocative allegory that would have Plato, Confucius, Buddha & Rod Serling scratching their collective heads and slapping their collective knees at the same time. The story is about a selfish louse 'Phil' (Bill Murray) who finds himself trapped in a bizarre loop, living the same day over & over.Buddhists, Hasidic Jews, Hindus and Gnostics alike have agreed that this as a wonderful illustration of how reincarnation works (and hey any movie that can get all the religions to agree on something is pretty impressive). Meanwhile psychologists widely applaud this as a fine example of how psychoanalysis & treatment work by revisiting our memories and hopefully learning from them each iteration. Economists have published papers relating Groundhog Day to advanced concepts of 'equilibrium economics'. And last but not least, audiences the world over say this is a hilarious flick. The reason why I've dwelled on all this heady gobbledygook, rather than the plot, is just to entice and prepare you for a masterpiece.Ok if you're still with me, let's talk about the actual movie already. 'Phil' is stuck living the same day over & over, and at the same time he's pursuing his love/lust interest 'Rita' (Andie McDowell). Can you guess the problem? Yes, if every day resets & repeats itself in 24 hours, that means he has 24 hours to seduce the chick. He tries everything, but for some reason it never seems to work. At the same time, on a deep spiritual level (though Phil is about as spiritually inclined as a damp sponge) he begins to wonder what's the point of doing anything if everything amounts to the same reset/rewind. Phil goes through almost every emotion & philosophy in the book: hedonism, narcissism, nihilism, existentialism, fear, pleasure, rage, and--quite convincingly--a deep depression which Bill Murray pulls off perfectly without sacrificing the momentum of the comedy.Ultimately our protagonist 'Phil' becomes the amalgamation of the human spirit, in all its triumphs, tragedies, arrogance and confusion. Watch this movie, and in between wiping back tears of laughter, you just may agree with that movie critic who says 'Groundhog Day' is a film that should survive for the next 100 years.",10,0,0,11 March 2020
Mr. & Mrs. Smith," Taking the audience to the cliff of absurdity... and dropping them mercilessly
","This is a really fun, entertaining & enjoyable movie if you know what to expect. The overall plot puts us in the mood of a classic noir-type spy romance (think Bogie-Bacall), but it's done with a modern, glossy look and over-the-top theatrics that instantly make you wonder 'WTF am I watching?' The 2 heroes can defy gravity, accept it. Guns never run out of bullets, or if they do, there's always a fully loaded gun conveniently lying on the ground. Accept it. Entire armies of commandos appear out of nowhere to tear up a city block and there's no sight of a police officer anywhere. Accept it. Our heroes can take a beating better than Mike Tyson on crack, and they only get a tiny droplet of blood on their foreheads. Accept it.If you can accept all that stuff, then you can sit back, relax & enjoy the show. The whole movie borders on the edge of campy, and I don't know about you, but I think that's how all action flicks should be because movie action IS campy! If you want a realistic spy thriller, watch 'The Day of the Jackal' (1973) or 'The Spy Who Came In from the Cold' (1965) which are both excellent films by the way. But if you want to be taken to a pseudo-fantasy world & entertained, then go for this.The pacing is fast & the action is practically nonstop. But what made me really enjoy this film are the toned-down scenes between Brad Pitt & Angelina Jolie. Now there's a textbook illustration of a passive-aggressive relationship. Their dialogue is so painfully awkward & strained (and hilarious) that it provides a perfect counterbalance to the blazing car chases & rains of bullets. A few of their lines will go into my vault of funniest movie lines ever, such as 'How often do you have sex? - I don't understand the question', 'Mom, we are on high alert here! I almost killed you right then!', 'Broken eye socket' and 'I said I saw your dad on Fantasy Island!' (They probably don't make much sense out of context, but watch the movie and maybe you'll die laughing too.) Also worth noting is the hilarious show-stealing performance by Vince Vaughn as Eddie, the crazy spy friend who lives with his mom. Be sure to watch the deleted scenes on the DVD for more of him (I can't understand why they would cut it).This is a pure fun flick that's perfect for a date, with your family, or just by yourself after a long day. Other films with the same flair (quirky love-hate relationships) include the spy-rom-com 'Duplicity' (2009), the fantasy-rom-com 'Camille' (2008), and I'll throw in the classic Bogie/Hepburn film 'African Queen' (1951) ...all of which are charming, refreshing & thoroughly entertaining from start to finish.",7,2,4,20 December 2011
Zero Dark Thirty," You'll wish your TV went Dark, Thirty minutes into the movie
","I'll make this quick so you can read all the other reviews rightfully slamming this movie. Zero Dark Thirty is a glossy, oversimplified, distinctly Hollywood re-telling of the CIA's version of how the Osama Bin Laden hunt went down.Every character on the roster can be described in 2 words: tough guy.I imagine the casting department had fun auditioning all the potential actors. 'Can you read that scene again but without a hint of a soul? Also say your lines as if you're trying to impress your high school prom date. You know, be a tough guy!' (Even the women)If you can see where this is going, congratulations, you have a brain and will probably dislike this movie. Zero Dark Thirty attempts to glorify everything the USA did, and it does this by portraying the CIA as a tough guy, too-cool-for-school gang of superheros. Torture, 'accidentally' killing civilians and general ignoble behavior is glorified because, tough guys are always right, and they get the job done. Because they're cool.If you've seen 'The Spy Who Came In from the Cold', an excellent EXCELLENT espionnage thriller about how the USA obtained intelligence during the Cold War and the repercussions thereof, then I can explain Zero Dark Thirty in one sentence: it everything that 'The Spy' was not.The whole movie seemed like all the rejects from Predator and all the rejects from Aliens decided to have a tough off. And the winner was... definitely not the audience.",2,4,8,28 November 2017
Wedding Crashers," Funny. That's all that matters.
","This movie takes us to the edge of what's tasteful. Then it pulls our underwear over our heads and spanks us mercilessly. If you can handle it, you'll have a great time.'Wedding Crashers' is a movie about a pair of 40-something men who have all the morals and tact of a bunch of teenagers on spring break. They run around crashing weddings, helping themselves generously to the food, music, and oh yeah, the women. In order to do this, they pull every trick in the book, trample on the sanctity of marriage, religion, peoples' feelings, and they're particularly cruel to German pop rock singer Nena by singing their hilariously horrible version of '99 Luftballoons' (a scene that was cut from the movie but available on the DVD deleted scenes). In other words, this is a movie that could possibly offend many people, but I don't think it does.The reason why it doesn't offend us, despite its borderline sexist, iconoclastic and irreverent approach, is because Owen Wilson and Vince Vaughn are the most lovable dorks you can imagine. They're not foul-mouthed neanderthals trying to subjugate the entire female species; instead they're really sweet guys who are shown to be sensitive, humble and more-or-less intelligent. They just happen to be on a quest for some nookie.Isla Fisher gives a great supporting performance as a mentally unbalanced nympho... sort of the female counterpart to the guys. Rachel McAdams plays the straight role giving the film stability. And Christopher Walken is... well, he's Christopher Walken. Nuff said.Don't expect a morality play, because this ain't one (at least not in the conventional sense). Just expect a lot of corny gags which are brilliantly executed. It can get pretty racy at times, but nothing explicitly raunchy. I'd put it in the same class as 'Hot Tub Time Machine', 'There's Something About Mary' and the hilarious Australian comedy 'The Wannabees' (for you fans of Isla Fisher). These are all funny movies that take us to the edge of tackiness and deliver some great laughs. You probably wouldn't want to watch them with your mom in the room, but they're well worth the price of admission.",7,0,1,5 March 2012
A Hard Day's Night," It's been a bo-ring movie... I should be sleeping like a log.
","Listen up, you mindless, brainwashed Beatles fans. Just skip reading this review and click the 'did not find this helpful' box at the bottom. Go on. I ORDER you to do it, you lemmings. I ORDER YOU NOW.Are they all gone? OK, let us proceed.I'm a Beatles fan, but I don't mindlessly applaud everything they've done. The Beatles I admire were the guys who wrote their own music, blended styles and philosophies of Eastern cultures, arranged symphonic movements, challenged our musical conceptions... and HAD PERSONALITIES. These qualities wouldn't surface until the 2nd half of their career after they had achieved sufficient confidence to dump the record company 'charm school' that had made them.The first half of their career, up to and including this movie, they were just prettyboy pawns of the record industry. And that's exactly what we get. We get some record producer's lame idea of a Beatles movie, NOT a Beatles movie. They act like, talk like and look like what a record producer would portray. Nothing human, nothing passionate, not even funny. Just reading lines and lip synching their catchiest tunes (somewhat poorly, I might add... Paul gets a few lines wrong, but the cameras just keep on rolling).Maybe some folks will laugh at the fast-motion antics of the fab four running around a football field and acting like clowns, wrestling and hitting each other. But I'd just as soon skip over that and get to the heart of it all. Surprise. there's no heart. This is just an endless parade of predictable gags and goofiness that becomes downright embarrassing after the first 20 mins.I repeat: THIS IS NOT THE BEATLES. It's a carefully packaged dress rehearsal of what fans wanted the Beatles to be back in the early 60s. Fans loved it back then, I'm sure. But in retrospect, it's no more interesting than watching a 1964 commercial for Comet Liquid Soap.Skip this one, folks. Proceed directly to YELLOW SUBMARINE. If you're feeling especially adventurous (mind-altered?), watch MAGICAL MYSTERY TOUR. Those films have some personality.",2,19,65,2 August 2006
Edge of Tomorrow," Best World War II film that never was
","'Edge of Tomorrow' has a whole lot going on. It's not just another scifi action flick, which is what I had thought and almost passed it by because of that. Instead, it's a very interesting mix of genres: scifi action (like 'Aliens'), World War II drama (like 'The Longest Day') and comedy-philosophical mindbender (like 'Groundhog Day').First the philosophical part. The premise is this: a less-than-honorable officer (Tom Cruise) gets shanghai'd and sent to the front lines in a war against an alien race. He bungles his mission almost immediately. But then an interesting thing happens: he gets sent back to do it again. And again. And again. I call this philosophical because you can immediately see the metaphor for reincarnation. And oddly enough, I got an interesting taste of existentialism here, too: Tom Cruise plays a character whose life has inherently no meaning. However it is through his determination and force of will that he finds an opportunity to try to make meaning for his life. Yes, it is a bit like 'Groundhog Day' (where the main character similarly repeats a day over & over), but I stress the existentialist vibe in 'Edge' vs. the more Buddhist vibe of 'Groundhog' a film more about enlightenment rather than taking control of fate as we see here.Enough of that; I'll leave you to consider the deeper implications of this film after you see it. The next major point I really enjoyed about this film was the playful sense of humor. First of all, Tom Cruise doesn't play some hotshot soldier who can kill 1000s of enemies on a single magazine of bullets. Instead, he is introduced as something of a pretentious pencil-pusher, an idiot who doesn't even know how to unlock the safety on a firearm let alone fire it. So immediately his character has an added dimension and more room for a dynamic transformation. He's one of the most human soldier characters I've seen in a while. The film is peppered with timely bits of humor that keep things fresh. Director Doug Liman got his start doing comedy ('Getting In', 'Swingers', 'Go') before he became known for action/thrillers like his 'Bourne' films and 'Mr. & Mrs. Smith' (which also have great spots of humor).And last, there's that bit I alluded to about World War II. 'Edge of Tomorrow' plays out very much like a WWII flick, in particular a film about Normandy on D-Day. Thus, the action scenes are not some over-the-top cgi extravaganza in some surreal setting, but rather, they took great pains to recreate an authentic Normandy-type beach setting with tons of live props, explosions, stunts, and very sparing use of cgi effects. So if you're somewhat numbed by computerized visuals, have no fear, 'Edge of Tomorrow' is a throwback to the old war flicks our parents grew up on. It does carry a modern, gritty feel to it. But it's still a very classic approach.When they do resort to computerized special effects, it's fabulous. The aliens that they're fighting are very creative and sinister, more like giant viruses than anything comic booky like Martians with helmets & ray guns. There's no point in describing the aliens, you just gotta see them for yourself.I also wanted to mention something I didn't notice until almost 45 minutes into the film, but there is an interesting LACK of profanity which makes this a pretty family-friendly flick. If you're like me, maybe you're tired of action flicks where characters drop the f-bomb every 10 words. Well here, we get tough, imposing, mean & dirty characters without them having to cuss like sailors to seem tough. Yes, this is PG-13, but it feels every bit as tense & heavy as an NC-17 or R film.Thumbs up from someone who rarely watches action flicks. If you end up liking this film, here are a few other gems worth tracking down: 'The Host' - an action/comedy/satire monster flick about a sea monster attacking Korea (it is said that the sea monster is a metaphor for Western imperialism), 'Robocop' the original 1987 version - a cynical, nightmarish look at the future with spots of great deadpan comedy, and 'Starship Troopers' - a very satirical look at war and the mindless mob-mentality violence that often accompanies war, by the same director who did Robocop. It's always fun to find a heart-pounding action flick that has deeper meaning below the surface.",Null,2,4,9 November 2014
August Rush," An absolutely beautiful story... with a few major problems
","'August Rush' is the most magical story I've seen in years. It also has some of the biggest plot holes I've seen in years. But in the end I have to say the magic triumphs, and if you watch this movie you'll probably enjoy it IF you are aware of a few things up front.First, this must be treated as a fairytale. That is, just as we accept that a big bad wolf can talk and a family of bears can cook porridge, we must make some large allowances for this film if we are to accept it.I won't go into too much detail what these errors/allowances are (other IMDb members have already compiled quite a list in the goofs section), but if you are a musician, particularly a classically trained one, you'll need some serious suspension of disbelief. The story is predicated on the idea that a young boy is a musical prodigy. That's fine, but this kid is downright supernatural. If you can accept that he can see a guitar for the first time and immediately rock out like Stanley Jordan, then you're OK. If you can accept the notion that he leafs through a 1st grade music book for 10 seconds and immediately knows advanced musical theory (the equivalent of leafing through a basic arithmetic book and suddenly knowing calculus), then you're halfway there. And if you can accept that he has the power to change into a tuxedo faster than Clark Kent can put on his blue tights, then you're gold.OK, enough cynicism. If you can get past all of that, then 'August Rush' is really a wonderful and original story that will charm your pants off. Very loosely based on Charles Dickens' 'Oliver Twist', it's the story of an orphan in search of his parents. But this story revolves around the intangible power of music to draw people together. I've never heard of any story that makes such a powerful & moving metaphor for the power of music, and like I said up front, this powerful metaphor was enough for me to lose myself in the fantasy of it all. I probably would've fallen into it more readily if someone had told me to expect a fantasy. But instead I was halfway expecting realism, making much of the movie hard to swallow. Well now you've been warned, so go into it expecting a dreamlike fairytale and just let yourself be swept away by the magic.A word of admiration for the late, great Robin Williams who plays a very complicated role here: a man who is basically a good guy but prone to inexcusable bouts of selfishness and violence. Not a particularly charming character but a memorable one, played with great skill.",7,6,6,23 September 2014
Hancock," A superhero movie for people who hate superhero movies
","Browsing the most popular reviews for this flick, I see most of them criticize 'Hancock' for not having enough action, not enough cgi, not having a super villain, or my favorite: getting too philosophical. See, this is why Hollywood keeps cranking out brainless superhero flicks; they know that the target audience doesn't want to be challenged with something completely different.I suppose '2001: A Space Odyssey' would've gotten the same treatment by imdb reviewers if imdb existed back in 1968 when the core scifi market demanded laser beams, monster suits, buxom babes in distress and loud things in space.'Hancock' does to the superhero genre what '2001' did to scifi. It made things real. Sure, Hancock zips through the sky like Superman on crack, but the point is that Hancock (played by Will Smith) is an ordinary schmuck like you or me, except that he happens to have super powers. Even worse, he has the world's worst case of idgaf, and this leads to a lot of stuff getting broken, bent and blown up unnecessarily. As a result, people hate him.Right there is the all the plot you need. You don't need a contrived super villain just because that's the formula. You don't need nonstop action and dazzling cgi to tell this story. This is because Hancock's enemy is himself.'Hancock' could easily have been a heavy, brooding drama like 'Leaving Las Vegas' or anything dealing with self-hatred, addiction or depression. BUT, this is the movie's charm, instead it's done very light-heartedly, with lots of zingers, funny sight gags and a quirky dysfunctional romance angle. And of course superhero powers. And so, this heavy story ends up being fun and entertaining, even breezy. But the more you think about it, there's a lot under the surface.So, as my title says, if you're not a fan of most superhero flicks, the kind with a clean good vs. evil template peppered with zippy action scenes and cgi, then give 'Hancock' a look. There aren't a lot of movies like this, definitely not many mainstream ones, but I'd put it in the same category as 'Special' with Michael Rappaport playing a total loser who develops bizarre super powers. On the more disturbing side there's 'Super' with Rainn Wilson who takes his vigilante superhero efforts a bit too far. These are all deep films under the candy exterior of 'superhero flick'.",Null,0,1,27 June 2019
Hitch," Hitch came unHitched in the final act.
","I watched all of this movie up to the last 10 minutes when anyone with 4 brain cells could guess what was going to happen next. The movie itself was entertaining and mostly original until the last 15 mins when evidently the screenwriters couldn't figure out where to go, so they just closed their eyes and picked from the 'every predictable Hollywood romcom' barrel for the final act.I'll get back to that in a minute. First let's talk about the good stuff. Will Smith is, as always, a great asset. He plays a character 'Hitch' who's a modern day matchmaker but with a soul--that is, he isn't just hooking people up for the conquest but he actually believes in love. Unfortunately he just doesn't believe in it ever happening for himself, so he goes through life jumping from one (implied) random hookup to another whilst he reserves true love for his clients.I know, right? Great premise. And for the most part the film holds up its end of the bargain by developing an interesting tale woven around this theme. Will Hitch finally learn to love? Physician heal thyself?Like I said, I shut it off in the last 10 minutes so I wouldn't know. But when things devolved into some horribly predictable romcom trope with the obligatory stupid misunderstanding and all the other obligatory stupid stuff that comes with it, every promising aspect dissolved.I actually recommend this movie so that you can laugh at how overtly a writer tries to manipulate the audience with a recycled formula. Enjoy the film up to that point (like I said, the presentation itself is entertaining enough to warrant your time). But just be ready with the clicker to shut it off as soon as you've seen enough.",5,0,2,14 March 2019
Shooter," Exciting flick. Leave your belief suspended at home.
","'Shooter' is a tale about a patriot who gets used & abused by the government that he swore allegiance to. It's the kind of movie that makes you want to run off to Canada, not because you hate your country but because you hate the goons who are running it. But don't pack your hockey stick just yet because the story provides enough satisfying turns to keep things entertaining rather than depressing.'Bob Lee Swagger' (Mark Wahlberg) is an Army sniper, one of the best, who is given the assignment of planning--but not executing--an assassination. That's all I'll say about the plot because the fun part is riding all the twists & turns that follow. Danny Glover plays his government liaison while at the top is Ned Beatty playing a questionable senator.What follows is an action packed political conspiracy thriller along the lines of a Tom Clancy story ('Clear and Present Danger', 'Patriot Games') but with the noticeable difference that our hero Bob is a total badass, sort of like a dash of 'First Blood'. And that's what makes this movie really fun when he starts to take things on the offensive.My only criticism is, as I implied in my title, a few preposterous things happen so be prepared. You know, stuff like when a person gets shot multiple times but is still able to swim across the Delaware River. (I mean bullets, sure, but all that Jersey waste'll kill ya faster than battery acid.) But if you can go along for the ride without raising too many eyebrows, this flick will definitely keep you riveted from start to finish. Bonus points for being shot in Philadelphia, the perfect city for a story like this.",7,0,0,13 March 2020
Tae Guk Gi: The Brotherhood of War," Sheesh. spoiler alert in IMDb's plot outline
","This is a very good film, but whatever you do, don't read IMDb's plot outline (as of today Jan 12, 2013) because it pretty much ruins it.The beauty of this movie is how it takes unexpected turns, beginning as a run-of-the-mill war story but slowly morphing into a complex epic of intense personal and political conflicts. That's all you need to know. And you certainly don't need to know how it ends!So let's not talk about plot. Instead I'll focus on the overall presentation. Like I said, it starts out very straightforward, seemingly predictable, but stick with it because things heat up. 'Tae Guk Gi' gives a glimpse of what war is really about: not necessarily honor and good vs. evil, but more realistically it paints a Machiavellian perspective where survival and individual interests are the real guts. (Oh and speaking of guts, you can expect to see a lot of them. Lots of realistic violence, so be prepared.). Anyway as I was saying, this film uses an interesting trick of painting both sides as either 'good' or 'evil', thus reducing the ideology of war to irrelevant. No one really cares when bullets are flying. At one point, a character reveals that a decorated war hero 'doesn't even know the difference between communism and democracy!' And that resounding statement is what makes this such a powerful film which makes an effective anti-war statement.Many great films have commented on the madness of war. Among the best are 'None But the Brave' with Frank Sinatra, 'Welcome to Dongmakgol' another excellent Korean War picture, the Russian masterpiece 'Ballad of a Soldier', the Brando film 'The Young Lions', and now I'm happy to add 'Tae Guk Gi' to my list of faves. Each of these films has its own unique angle. This movie's angle is particularly unsettling, and that's why you must see it.",8,1,2,11 January 2013
Music and Lyrics," Required viewing for 80s music fans
","Every 10 years or so, a musical comedy comes along that perfectly pegs a musical era. The late 70s would be 'Spinal Tap'. The 90s would be 'Singles'. And here, ladies & gentlemen of the 80s generation, we have 'Music and Lyrics'.I don't know if post-80s people would understand the humour, but gawd I was in stitches right from the start. The film begins with an embarrassingly accurate rendition of an 80s pop video: moussed hair, tight pants, big-arm dancing, slutty nurses with bursting cleavage, the works! From there, the film focuses on one of the guys in the video, the self-proclaimed 'happy has been' Alex (Hugh Grant), an ex-80s glamour boy who is now reduced to playing high school reunions and Six Flags themeparks to make a living. In many ways it's so accurate, it can't even be called a satire.Even funnier is the spoof of today's booty music and Alex's attempt to integrate himself. He has 3 days to write a hit single for a pop diva, but despite his instrumental talents he has the lyric writing skills of a wet shoe (trying to rhyme 'you and me' with 'autopsy' haha). Then along comes Sophie (Drew Barrymore) who has a magical way of putting words together, though she herself comes with a handful of emotional baggage.The plot is really not the point. The point of this film is--in the spirit of Spinal Tap--to mock the silliness of cultural crazes, particularly the 80s music that we all know so well (but are too embarrassed to admit). My fellow rejects from the 80s, this is your catharsis, a way of exorcising all the demons from your closets. You can laugh at the screen, but you're actually laughing at yourself & loving every minute.Both Hugh & Drew deliver great, believable performances, and the script is fast paced & witty like an old Katharine Hepburn / Cary Grant picture. But what really made this a great film are the riotous performances by the supporting characters. Brad Garrett ('Everybody Loves Raymond'), Kristen Johnston ('3rd Rock from the Sun'), and the rookie Haley Bennett (in her first of, I hope, many films) are monstrously funny, adding their own particular quirky comedy to this production.Don't miss your chance to see this movie. Twice even. And the bonus features on the DVD are a real treat: the Gag Reel (bloopers), Deleted Scenes, and The Making Of featurette. If you were born between 1965 and 1975 you must see this film. To everyone else, yes, I think you'll enjoy it too. Keep in mind that all this stuff was REAL.",8,1,2,15 March 2010
Birdman or (The Unexpected Virtue of Ignorance)," All in one shot
","Birdman's cinematic gimmick is that the entire movie is seemingly shot in one continuous camera take, no cuts, no edits. In the tradition of the masterpieces 'Russian Ark', 'PVC-1' and Alfred Hitchcock's 'Rope' (which actually had 9 or 10 necessary cuts, due to the limitations of film cameras), likewise here we watch a story seemingly in real-time as if we were invisible observers orbiting the drama. The art of the 'long take' is a risky gamble because it involves a lot of extra choreography, production, lighting and attention to detail, and most viewers hardly notice. But it's one of the most impressive things that can be done with a camera.Note: the entire film wasn't actually done in 1 take like the aforementioned movies, but through the use of tasteful cgi edits it's close enough.If that little introductory factoid bored you, then you'll probably be bored by the flick. Yes, this is an 'artsy' film, but it doesn't lose itself in artsiness like, say, one of those movies that force you to read subtitles (/sarcasm). Through the use of quirky humor, an interesting story, and of course Michael Keaton's excellent portrayal of a complex lovable loser, there's enough to keep your attention as long as you're not expecting an action flick.'Birdman' is about an aging moviestar named Riggan who once played an iconic superhero named Birdman, but now having matured, he is intent on leaving the world a legacy of more than pop culture in tights. He self-produces a stage play, investing his entire fortune, as well as the greater part of his sanity, in it, hoping that the insane actors he hired don't destroy his entire vision.Oh by the way, Riggan may have a few super powers.The plot itself is a mouthful, but the power of this film lies not in the plot but in the tense human drama that unfolds as we explore themes of dysfunctional family relationships (particularly with his Meh-lennial daughter, excellently played by Emma Stone), arrogance in the art world, and of course the tragedy of not being taken seriously just because you wore blue tights for half your career.The gimmick of the continuous camera as well as excellent overall cinematography and staging, is the icing on the cake. I can see how Birdman easily swooped up the Academy Award for cinematography in 2017 (along with Best Picture, Best Director and Best Screenplay).I can also understand why some people hated this movie. It's not an easily digestible entertainment flick, and it is NOT a superhero movie despite it featuring ex-Batman himself in the role of 'Birdman', so don't expect fight scenes and flying (well not too much flying. And the fight scene was a riot). If you enjoy heavy dramatic works where not a lot happens, yet we are given a peek into the deepest recesses of the human soul (Streetcar Named Desire, Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf, or any classic stage-to-film adaptation), then this will be right up your alley.I would compare Birdman to films like 'De-Lovely' (a stylish biopic of Cole Porter), 'Klimt' (featuring John Malkovich as the famous Austrian painter), or on the lighter side, a great dysfunctional-superhero gem called 'Special' with Michael Rapaport playing the role of a lonely metermaid who suddenly develops super powers but still can't get his life together.'Birdman' definitely soars above the flock of common Hollywood flicks. If you're not sure, I think you should go ahead and wing it. Just be aware that Birdman isn't exactly a crowd pleaser. Er... crow pleaser? Either way I think you'll beak content with time well spent. Ok, I'll stop now.",9,1,2,7 July 2019
Prometheus," Attention, fans of 2001: A Space Odyssey...
","If you never saw '2001: A Space Odyssey' (1969), then run yourself silly in a giant hamster wheel for 10 minutes, watch '2001', then come back and read this review. 2001 is the one that started them all: those scifi epics that blended spaceships with the ontological questions of existence (and no, ontology has nothing to do with cancer. I looked it up). Kubrick's 2001 spawned an entire genre of film in the same way Darwin spawned an entire genre of science. Notable follow-ups to 2001 include Tarkovsky's 'Solyaris' (1972) and Soderbergh's remake 'Solaris' (2002), Robert Wise's 'Star Trek: The Motion Picture' (1979), the recent Battlestar Galactica remake (2003-2009) and Ridley Scott's own 'Blade Runner' (1982)... stories that hit on questions of existence, evolution and the creation of life. Here in 'Prometheus' we have the latest foray into this small circle of films that blend suspense, philosophy... and big things that zoom through space without making any noise (AS IT SHOULD BE).In 1979 when director Ridley Scott made his groundbreaking 'Alien', it was apparent that he was stylistically influenced by Kubrick's '2001'. He presented an ominously cold future full of enormous, sterile machines that reduced humanity down to a flyspeck. And from there he proceeded with a classic existentialist struggle of the human faced with an ominous, overwhelming conflict. Prometheus is visually and stylistically a continuing chapter of the Alien world, and in fact there are plot elements that tie into the Alien story as well (although some of those elements seem to be more gimmicky than substantial... tying this story with the enormously popular Alien franchise). From there we are led into an epic tale that blends good ole '2001' philosophy with 'Alien' action. The question is: how do you prefer your balance between the two?Another important question is: how much can you suspend your disbelief? Granted, all futuristic films require some suspension of disbelief, but in this case there are a few moments when you'll need a 50 story tower crane to suspend your disbelief. Others have covered some of these points in their reviews, so I'll just leave it and assume you can deal with it.Regarding the deeper thematic elements (the meaning of life and all that jazz), here's where I'm speaking to the 2001 fans because I feel that's what 'Prometheus' initially promises us. Much like 2001, it begins with a cryptic dramatic scene on Earth, eons ago, then soon jumps us to a colossal spacecraft of the future. The message being: this film promises to address the question of our existence by examining our future. But my personal feeling is, following this excellent introduction, the film gradually makes too many compromises for the sake of 'momentum, pacing and time' (3 words which are used a dozen times in the DVD commentary to excuse the cutting of 37 minutes of film). And ultimately, the film delivers a wild scifi/action/fx ride that will certainly get your heart pumping, but not necessarily your brain cells firing.I definitely recommend this film to scifi/action fans because it has an intelligent premise and manages to blend that with a fast-paced, classic blood & guts action story. But for any 2001 fans who might want more, I strongly urge you to watch the 37 minutes of deleted scenes. With only 1 or 2 exceptions, I think they all should have been part of the movie. Not just to further explain the story (which isn't really necessary) but to add dimension and meaning to the characters, expose what drives them and how it fits into the overall theme of searching for the meaning of life.In particular there are 2 scenes between the captain of the ship 'Janos' (Idris Elba) and the dragon lady 'Miss Vickers' (Charlize Theron) which take these two characters out of their 2-dimensional, supporting-character roles and flesh them out as real human beings with internal conflicts and complexities of their own. In the commentary the cut was justified, saying that the scenes unnecessarily took away from the main hero's story. As if we're too stupid to handle a subplot. Other cuts were similarly justified for plot momentum (sanctioned by Ridley Scott himself, so we can't even blame some dumb corporate suit for butchering a masterpiece), and you soon understand that it was not Ridley Scott's intention to go so far into 2001 territory as it was to stay true to the 'Alien' space horror formula.And on that note, I felt a bit cheated because the formula in the 2nd half was almost identical to Alien, almost scene-for-scene toward the end, and I feel like it didn't offer anything above and beyond the original masterpiece. Noomi Rapace is an excellent actress, but she didn't quite fit the tough-as-nails Sigourney Weaver role that she was evidently expected to emulate.Perhaps an unintended highlight of the film was the performance of Michael Fassbender as 'David', an unusual character whose secret I won't ruin though it's revealed in the opening minutes. Fassbender was easily 50% of the reason why I liked this movie.In the end I enjoyed 'Prometheus' as I think every scifi movie fan will. But part of me felt let down because of what it could have been. I felt most cheated by the filmmakers' self-admitted compromises for the sake of moving the story along at a brisk pace. But at the same time, nobody can deny how majestic the visuals are, certainly the best scifi special effects I've seen in a long time, and the action succeeded in getting my pulse pounding twice as fast. 'Prometheus' does make a very powerful, original statement. So yes, go see it. And maybe in a few years we'll get the 'Prometheus full extended cut redux', or whatever it'll be called, for those of us who can take 37 minutes more. One way or another, I think this film is a step in the right direction for scifi.",Null,2,5,6 January 2016
Before Sunrise," Annoying frat boy hits on French girl. For 12 hours.
","Annoying frat boy hits on French girl. For 12 hours. But the worst part is that the French girl goes along with it. For 12 hours. And we are forced to go along with it. For 2 hours. This is the kind of movie that makes you want to smack someone.Perhaps it wouldn't have been so bad if there had been some sort of chemistry between Ethan Hawke and Julie Delpy. I mean, after all, even annoying frat boys can fall in love. But no. The two are so incompatibly different that, despite what the script says, none of the flirtations are believable. I imagine the minute the director yelled 'cut', Julie would spin around and head straight for her trailer. Ethan would go soak his head. The problem is that the director never yells 'cut'. Instead we are subjected to watching the awkward, contrived and stiff ramblings of these two people who have nothing in common except for the script.I saw what the director was trying to do. He was trying to capture the poetry of life through long, continuous shots and mundane dialogue. He was trying to show us how wonderful the simplicity of everyday life can be. But there is nothing artistic or poetic about the shots, the dialogue or the emotion on screen. The whole thing feels like an awkward date you just cant wait to ditch.'Before Sunrise' is like 'When Harry Met Sally', except without the humour, the charm, the witty style, the plot or the music. In essence, there is no reason to watch this movie. If you do watch this movie, make sure you're not sitting near anyone or you might get smacked.Before sunrise?

The Sixth Sense," Even if someone spoiled the ending for you, it's still worth seeing
","There are over 2000 IMDb reviews for 'The Sixth Sense' so I don't think I can add anything that hasn't already been said. But in case someone has already spoiled the ending for you (like some dumbbutt did for me and the entire office back in 1999, causing me to avoid this movie for 15 years), never fear... it's still VERY MUCH worth watching.The cool twist is, of course, the main punch of this film. But it's the kind of film you have to watch twice. Once for the story and once for the poetry. So to all my fellow film lovers who happen to have friends & coworkers with big mouths, this film is still a real treat on a poetic & artistic level.M. Night Shyamalan is one of the few directors who deserves the hype and popularity he gets, at least for this film (I haven't seen any of his others but soon will). Everything is meticulously planned, every camera movement, every shadow, every color and every editing cut, almost to the point of obsessive mania. In the DVD extras he and his crew explain why they did everything the way they did; for example they do a lot of long takes because their philosophy was that rapid cuts tend to disrupt the viewer's thought process. So instead of showing a dialogue between two people in a volley of closeup cuts, the scene is done with 1 camera filming them from the side, slowly, almost hypnotically moving between both of them as it gets closer over the course of perhaps 2 minutes.I could go on for ages about such scenes, but you probably get the point. If you enjoy the classic directors known for their careful & deliberate approach to filmmaking, directors like Orson Welles ('Citizen Kane'), Otto Preminger ('The Man with the Golden Arm'), Kurosawa ('Seven Samurai') or even the younger crop of great directors like Steven Soderbergh ('Traffic') and Alfonso Cuarón ('Children of Men'), you definitely have to check out this movie and other works of Shyamalan.",8,2,3,1 September 2014
Flight," Powerful, well-acted drama watered down by a Zemeckisy ending
","All the way until the ending I was eating this up. 'Flight' is a tense, character-driven drama about a heroic pilot who averts an epic disaster only to be caught in the crosshairs of a long, ugly investigation of his life. It presents a highly complex story, weaving themes of heroism vs. arrogance, good intentions vs. bad results, and bad intentions vs. good results. For 80% of the film, 'Flight' is on par with the greatest character studies since '12 Angry Men'. However, be prepared for a less than fitting ending, or at best an ending that was rushed so quickly that it leaves you wondering 'did we miss an entire scene where the ghosts of Christmas past, present & future showed up?'That's the only negative I have, although it's a big one. For the rest of my review I'll focus on the positives. The biggest positive is, of course, Denzel Washington as pilot 'Whip Whittaker'. He certainly doesn't disappoint. The role is a challenging one: a man whose personal life is a disaster even though his professional life is spotless. His professional arrogance leads him to deny the failure of his personal life, and this is the conflict that makes the film riveting.Although this film is squarely about him, there were some peripheral characters who really added to the pot. British actress Kelly Reilley pulls of a convincing southern accent (though southern sticklers may spot it as more 'Alabama' than 'Georgia' haha) and more importantly gives us insight into the mind of a damaged person who is genuinely trying to better herself, unlike our hero who denies his faults. Another great character, though minimal, is John Goodman who shows up as a bizarre, surrealistic 'fixer' and adds tremendous color and humor to the show. The attorney for Whip Whittaker is excellently played by Don Cheadle who balances slick legal professionalism with utter frustration at his client's self-sabotaging acts.Even the action scenes were incredibly done, using a full sized commercial jet cut into sections and hoisted up on a weird contraption that made it flip around for the cameras. This is a first class production from start to finish.It only falls shy of monumental because of its Zemeckisy ending, a trademark of many 80s directors like Spielberg and Ron Howard where everything has to be neatly tied up in a bundle with a moral ending, even if it seems out of left field considering the characters' personality. But that's just my opinion and the reason why I docked 'Flight' a few points. You may find it perfect. Regardless I think everyone can agree that most of the film is phenomenal.",Null,0,0,24 May 2019
Easy A," The smartest high school teen comedy I've ever seen.
","There's a rare comedy zone that exists above pratfalls & cheap gags, above situational laughs, somewhere near satire but not quite that obvious. It's a peculiar zone, sort of like the classic 'Edward Scissorhands' where the filmmakers are clearly showing you an exaggerated reality, but not so exaggerated that you lose touch with its relevance. And through this wacky prism we see our own lives with a hilarious spin if the actors can pull off the right deadpan delivery. Very few movies hit this zone, movies like 'Catch-22' (1970), 'Dr Strangelove' (1964), 'Joe Vs. the Volcano' (1990) or 'Punch Drunk Love' (2002). And here, I'm happy to announce in the most unlikely genre (high school teen comedy) we have a great addition to the list: 'Easy A'.If I lost you with my opening paragraph don't worry, all I'm saying is that this movie is really funny. Emma Stone plays 'Olive Pendergast', a 17-year old girl at a California high school who, after years of being a faceless nobody, suddenly gets thrust into the spotlight when strange rumors of her sexual promiscuity spread like wildfire. The 'Easy A' in the title is a reference to the parallel story of 'The Scarlet Letter', the 1850 novel about a woman accused of adultery and forced to wear a demeaning 'A' for her sins. But here we see a cool, modern take on the situation with Olive proudly and spitefully wearing her penance in front of the entire school of her accusers.And that's what makes this such a fun & hilarious flick. It's that, the whole time, Olive is almost like the puppetmaster and controller of the crazy events that happen as things quickly escalate. Emma Stone is perfect for the role with her sarcastic wit and deadpan apathy even though her life is rapidly going into the trash can. Thus the chain of events becomes like what I described in the opening paragraph: an exaggerated reality delivered with deadpan precision. If you've ever seen a Bill Murray flick ('Groundhog Day'), that's how Emma's character comes across.Throw into the mix some really witty zingers, some hilariously bizarre characters and a healthy buffet of references to classic 80s teen comedies (movie buffs, you can make a game of trying to catch them all), and you've got a great experience. The whole presentation is like a 80s John Hughes film on steroids. John Hughes would populate his high schools with instantly recognizable archetypes (the jock, the nerd, etc), and here we have the same approach but way off the deep end. Instead of being antagonized by the jocks, Emma's character must match wits with the Jesus freaks who sit around with a guitar singing bad religious diddies (another parallel with the antagonists in 'The Scarlet Letter').From beginning to end, 'Easy A' is very well written, clever, poignant and just plain hilarious. And on top of it all, it delivers a powerful message that every teen, as well as most adults, should remember regarding how to navigate this crazy judgmental society we live in. As you're watching this, you realize that the microcosm of high school applies to our entire civilization. Whatever age you are, definitely give this flick a go.",8,1,1,6 February 2020
The Ugly Truth," Light entertainment. Unfortunately they cut the parts that would have made it great.
","If you're looking for a breezy, predictable romcom that pokes fun at gender stereotypes, 'The Ugly Truth' will fill the slot. It's basically a watered-down rehash of the classic 'When Harry Met Sally' gender war romcom (right down to the orgasm at a restaurant scene) with nothing really new. Unfortunately the angle that would have given it a fresh spin ended up on the cutting room floor. I'll get to that in a sec. First let's summarize the story.Abby (Katherine Heigl) is an uptight, prudish tv producer who is forced to work with a loud-mouthed, misogynistic talk show host named Mike (Gerard Butler). Each presents an extreme stereotype of the sexes: Abby is a control freak who expects her man to be straight out of the Hallmark Channel while Mike treats women like he's ordering at the McDonald's drive thru. The plot revolves around a bet: Mike tells Abby that if she follows his neanderthal advice, she can snare her perfect dream man.So there's an interesting sort of role reversal, where the prudish female is taking lessons from the neanderthal bro in order to achieve her ideal Hallmark romance. That itself was a great start, but this clever spirit of the film got lost when they cut a few critical scenes (I guess because those scenes focused on character development and didn't have enough zingers).The scenes that were cut showed exactly how hopelessly neurotic Abby is and why she keeps scaring men off. And they focused on the important, yet mostly lost, subplot of how fake Abby must become in order to snare her man. 4 or 5 scenes were cut, and rather than understanding the degree of Abby's 'Pygmalion' transformation, we the audience are rushed through the process. Also cut are some scenes that show Mike to be more sensitive/human, giving his character depth which is otherwise lacking. The result of these cuts is, instead of this film showing more of a complex gender-role-reversal switcheroo, it simply falls back on the black & white stereotypes of men being neanderthals and women being prudes. Nothing exceptionally clever, but still entertaining enough.So in the end, yes, I can understand why the watered down message could offend some. What we get is mostly the male perspective of Mike, reducing Abby's role to being his clueless sidekick. And the rest is predictable.The angle of them on a tv set with a producer/talent relationship is interesting, but it's nothing really new if you've done your romcom homework. On that account I would sooner recommend 'Groundhog Day' which has the identical setup--Bill Murray playing the narcissistic tv talent with Andie McDowell playing his more sensible-minded producer--except that Groundhog Day rightfully focuses on the narcissist coming down to earth, not the other way around which we see here.A final note worth mentioning. I've heard it said that any movie that ends with a hot air balloon is insulting to the viewer's intelligence. There is indeed a hot air balloon in this one. So be prepared...",6,2,2,10 February 2020
Moon," Hey, oldschool scifi fans... CHECK IT OUT.
","I'm just going to rattle off some titles, and if you like most of them, chances are you'll really enjoy 'Moon'. If, on the other hand, you think these movies are boring, then there's no need for you to read further; skip this movie.OutlandBlade RunnerStar Trek the Motion PictureTHX-1138Soylent Green20012010Space: 1999Kin-Dza-Dza (an obscure Russian flick, but I'll throw it in there anyway)All of these productions share something in common: the attitude that mood & theme are more important than special effects or even plot. These are all films that make you think on a level much deeper than the action on screen. Special effects are (in most cases) minimalistic and pacing is slow and heavy. No, this definitely ain't Star Wars.More than a scifi flick, 'Moon' is a psychological thriller that unfolds slowly and cryptically, with many surprises thrown at you. When I say 'surprises' I don't mean monsters jumping out of the dark, but rather surprises in the way characters behave and resolve matters.Adding more twists to the joyride, director uses familiar elements from older scifi to make us think certain things, but this is a clever way of fooling the audience. So don't be put off by the fact that certain elements may seem like they're stolen from other films. In the DVD commentary, the director tells us that these elements are intended as both an homage and a storytelling device. And that's precisely what makes it interesting to old school scifi fans. The same way Steve Martin's 'Dead Men Don't Wear Plaid' is a pastiche of 40s film noir with a new spin, 'Moon' does a similar thing with 70s scifi.I won't say a thing about the plot since it's best that you experience it yourself. I'll just say that it touches on psychology, sociology, genetics, ethics, industrialism, stem cell research and a whole host of topics that are relevant today, let alone for future generations. This is very much a thinker's flick, so if you're the kind of person who bores easily, I'd say stay away.I'll mention one other thing that you should keep in mind when watching this movie. It had an overall budget of a measly $5 million, but it looks every bit as believable, if not more, than today's movies that cost 25x as much (Star Wars III had a budget of $120 million). The director accomplished this feat by going back to the old ways of doing special effects in the 70s: models & miniatures, not computer generated cartoons. A full set was built for the moon base, and everything was filmed within those rooms, no cheating. This gives the film a degree of authenticity that you can't get any other way. Yes, there was some cgi added in post-production, but with very few exceptions I couldn't spot it.I highly recommend you watch this movie and also watch the extras on the DVD which will give you a greater appreciation for how this production came together, not to mention how much work & discipline went into the performance by Sam Rockwell.If nothing else, this film is a breath of fresh air in space. It's a return to days of 70s science fiction where the emphasis is on 'science' and the abstract themes that arise from it. I rate it 8 out of 10. I only took off points because I would've liked it to be twice as long so it could've explored some of the compelling themes even deeper. But as the director says on the DVD, they kept it mainstream enough that everyone can enjoy it.",8,2,10,3 August 2010
Slumdog Millionaire," Gumdog Godzillianaire
","I'm usually pretty good at coming up with witty, poignant titles for my reviews, but this movie doesn't even deserve that.Every few years someone from a rich Western culture makes a film about a poor Eastern culture which makes rich Western audiences feel better about themselves because now they somehow connect with poor Easterners. Slumdog Millionaire is one such film.It's horribly contrived, like an ABC afterschool special. Themes which could otherwise be handled with interesting complexity are bashed over your head with all the subtlety of the Bhopal disaster. The good guy is lily-white good, and the bad guys are evil satans. Even when the good guy must do something unpleasant (such as fighting to protect a loved one), he cowers and lets his evil friend do the dirtywork. This film is nothing but a polarization of good vs. evil which reduces it (and Indian culture) to a silly comic book. But they cloak it in lots of tear-jerking footage of poverty, beggars and injustice so it makes you feel like you're watching something of social significance.I lived in India for several years. I've seen the slums, the poverty, the despair & the hope of the people. It's much more complicated than what this silly travel brochure offers. I keep hoping one day someone will get it right, but alas, not this time. I'm sure someone will try again in 5 years or so.",3,8,12,8 December 2010
Contact," 'Science without religion is lame. Religion without science is blind.'
","The quote in my title comes from Albert Einstein, and I get the feeling that Sagan agrees.Carl Sagan's story 'Contact' approaches the age-old cosmic debate of science vs. religion. That is the strength of this film, and it presents some very lucid points. Without ruining anything, I'll say that the film illustrates an interesting grey area where both overlap. Namely: the realm of doubt.It shows that both sides can fall prey to fanaticism, and both sides are often guilty of close-mindedness. While Sagan definitely chooses his own side and hammers it home at the end, the film still remains objective enough that you can see the validity of both teams. I really enjoyed that side of the film.But the weakness of this film is that it falls back to a standard crowd-pleaser with a superficial romance, a predictable government villain (I suspect Sagan was venting his own personal frustrations at political intervention), and a sentimental family story which detract from the cosmic experience this film promises.If you're familiar with the films 'E.T.' and '2001: A Space Odyssey' you probably know how different they are. Both are good films, but 'E.T.' is mostly entertainment while '2001' is a philosophical puzzle. Here in 'Contact' it feels like they set out to give us '2001' but they ended up with 'E.T.' In the director's commentary, the filmmakers admit to making some rather non-scientific compromises in order to keep the audience dazzled.For example, there's sound in space. Ugh! Why do they always do that? Kubrick showed us in 1969 that he could respect physics (no sound in space) and still keep us on the edge of our seats with suspense; in fact the silence of space made it even more chilling. Audiences aren't as dumb as Hollywood thinks we are. Or are we?I'd say this film is above average in terms of science fiction but below average in terms of science. Its main flaw is that it falls in the empty space between the two. It probably isn't action-packed enough for straightforward entertainment, and it's not quite heady enough to be philosophy. But it makes you think, and that's the mark of a successful film.If you enjoy 'Contact' and find yourself craving something deeper, I highly recommend '2001' (the grandfather of all thinking films), 'THX-1138' (before Lucas turned sappy), 'Solaris' (either version, I actually prefer the remake) and '2010' (the sequel to 2001, not nearly as good but a worthy effort).",7,1,3,23 December 2012
The Martian," If you don't care about sounds in space, then you might really enjoy this.
","My title sounds sarcastic, but I really mean it. If it doesn't bother you when films depict bangs, crashes, rumbles, booms, and pew-pew 'laser' beams (add Austin Powers finger quotes) in the vacuum space, then load up your popcorn and get set for a wild ride. If, on the other hand, the aforementioned cinematic gimmicks bother you, then you still might enjoy this film but just be prepared for that and more.Although The Martian gives us just an occasional low, tasteful rumble when spaceships fly by, that's the least of its scientific transgressions, and things get pretty 'Mars Attacks' preposterous in the final 20 minutes. Normally I wouldn't even bring this up since basically EVERY space movie in the history of EVER, except for 2001: A Space Odyssey (1969), has sound effects in space. But the problem is that 'The Martian' takes a very committed, scientific, realistic tone which sets us up for an extremely scientific, realistic story. It falls short on that mark, and rather than bore you and pretentiously inflate my own ego by pointing out every flaw, I'll let you read the other reviews, or better yet: just accept that there are scientific loopholes so big that you can drive a Quasar through it (and I'm not talking about the car made in 1967).Ok if I haven't lost you, then let's talk about the fun stuff. The special effects are FANTASTIC. Director Ridley Scott ('Alien', 'Blade Runner') outshines himself once again with a truly magnificent feast for the eyes, and especially if you watch it on a large UHD screen, that alone is worth the price of admission.The story itself is riveting. It's a tale of survival on a barren planet where Matt Damon fights a constant battle NOT against little green men or pew-pew 'laser' beams but against the cold and sterile reality of space. That was my favorite part of the movie, the fact that it can carry our interest for 2 1/2 hours with the only real conflict being how to survive on a planet where nothing works.Matt Damon does an incredible job of acting, portraying a complex character who realizes he's a dead man but rises to the challenge and pits every brain cell he's got against the universe. Similar to the excellent 'Cast Away' or even the iconic 'Papillon', it's a story about never giving up even if it kills you, and that regardless of whether we get a happy ending or a sad one, is the takeaway of this flick.I would group this film with other modern, minimalistic sci-fi flicks that take a realistic ('boring' to some) approach but deliver a lot of drama. Flicks like 'Moon', 'Solaris', or on the older shelf 'Contact', '2010' and possibly even the grandfather of them all, '2001' (though don't get your hopes up too high as I mentioned up front) will give you a taste for what's in store if you decide to watch 'The Martian'.",Null,1,1,21 September 2019
