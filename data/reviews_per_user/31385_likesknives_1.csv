Casablanca," Ignorance in Reviews
","I would like to say first that this movie is not super realistic or would I consider it the best of all time, but it is a very very good movie, despite some unrealistic factors, and I find it so ridiculous reading some of these comments from people who rate it with 1 star or something of the like who write about it as if they have never seen it. I read things such as 'Ilsa is seen almost jumping out of the plane to get to Rick'.. and i think 'did you actually watch the movie? or did you want to just say you didn't like it because everyone else does?' You should really watch it before you write down comments about that make you seem like a child. Sure, some people don't like it because of the accents, the black and white, or for their reasons, but a lot of people do and you sound stupid talking about things that never happened in the movie. Black and white is okay in movies, there are a lot of good black and white movies, and a lot were made when colour was around but they wanted the effect of black and white. Directors and producers have their reasons, and the Casablanca would look stupid in colour anyways. Think before you talk because the people who like this movie, don't appreciate your useless aspects of a movie that you seem to know nothing about.",7,2,6,25 February 2009
