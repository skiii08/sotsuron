Deja Vu," Denzel has another hit
","Denzel Washington will go down in history as one of the greatest actors of his day ...and this movie once again proves why! With a plot as complex as this one is ...Denzel holds his place and keeps you riveted to the screen. From the opening sequence (quite spectacular) to the thrilling (although mind boggling at times) conclusion ... I sat and watched without blinking. I loved this movie ...I plan on seeing it over again just to catch what I missed.The trailers for this movie did it justice by not giving away too much ...but giving away just enough to tempt you. A fabulous story featuring action, suspense, romance and of course a sci-fi touch too. This is one the whole family will love.",9,1,2,5 December 2006
The Prestige," Well worth the money
","I had seen a number of reviews of The Prestige and they were all giving it an extremely high rating, even from reviewers who are notorious for giving low ratings, so I went into this movie with very high expectations and was not disappointed. There is plenty of time for character-building as the movie runs over 2 hours, but do not fear, this movie is not filled with 'filler material.' From the opening credits to the final credits, you are enthralled with what is happening on screen. This is not a high-action movie, but it does contain tense scenes that get you to sit on the edge of your seat. As the final credits began, the theatre that I was in broke out into spontaneous applause, something that I have only experienced with one other movie (and that was a premiere night).The movie centers around two rival magicians who are friends at the beginning of the movie, but due to an unfortunate incident, they become bitter rivals. They then seek to 'better' each other as they develop the 'ultimate' trick. The movie takes place in turn of the century London and is very pleasurable to watch.With so many movies coming out these days, it is difficult to pick one from the rest, but The Prestige jumps out as one that should be seen. BUT be warned ...this movie has a number of twists and you should be careful of what you read or listen to prior to watching it. If the twists are revealed .. it would certainly spoil the experience for you.",9,2,4,24 October 2006
Bohemian Rhapsody," Must see
","There are things missing and huge holes, but that's to be expected when you condense a life down to 2 hours. But watching the process of creating the biggest hits in history is amazing. But most of all watching the recreated Live Aid performance was worth the price of admission.",9,3,4,6 November 2018
