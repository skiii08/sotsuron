"Run, Fat Boy, Run"," Gross, stupid and naive
","If the man didn't finish the run, the woman didn't go back to him and the successful businessman didn't go evil all of a sudden at the end, I probably will give this film a 7. Unfortunately it turns out a stupid and naive story eventually. Guess the director believes the fantasy in Friends too much.",3,1,1,23 March 2018
