Catch Me If You Can," Why? Can anyone tell me why?
","Why is it that Leo always gets these roles that cast him as a suave, debonair ladies man from books such as the Beach and now Catch Me if You Can?I actually read this book fifteen years ago as a fifth grade autobiography project. What I do remember is that Frank Abagnale stressed that he was able to accomplish his feats because he looked ten years older than he actually was. Yet you have the reverse with Leo. Can anyone tell me why?It is almost as if Steven Spielberg recognized the moral vacuum of this film and looked to Leo as some sort of insurance.I did find one chuckle. I was ten years old when Frank Abagnale managed to capture my attention by his bamboozling, and now Leo seems to have stepped squarely into Frank's shoes. Way to go Leo!Please go watch something else, anything else, except for The Beach.",1,3,17,9 April 2006
The Beach," Garbage
","Has anyone actually paid to see this movie? whether in the theater or renting the movie? I caught it channel surfing one night and paused only long enough to figure out what I was watching and recall why I hate Leo. The only reason I am even wasting my time to write a review is because someone needs to counter the endless stream of 9s and 10s on this sight. If you ask me, this only degrades the quality of IMDb.As for the reality, it is not even close. I spent two years in the tropics and life is very hard. You are sunburnt all the time, not tan, and sick from the monotony of the food, tropical diseases and storms. ***Spoiler follows*** watching Leo spear a dozen fish on his first try followed by a macho, 'I provide!' moved something within me that I didn't know existed :{D= ***End of Spoiler***What else is on!",1,16,28,8 April 2006
The Bourne Ultimatum," Still relevant post-911
","When The Bourne Identity hit the screen in 2002, the Cold War was decidedly over and spy movies had lost their relevance in the post-911 aftermath. The Bourne Identity masterfully resonated with our psyches: here was a man, despite all his abilities, unable to answer a basic question: 'who is my enemy and why are they after me?' The next installment took a different turn, Doug Liman was replaced by Paul Greengrass, and while Brian Cox was brought back as Ward Abbott, the electric performance of Chris Cooper was missing. The Bourne Ultimatum not surprisingly shares more with the second than the first. Joan Allen returns as Pamela Landy with more intense action than ever and Bourne traversing more continents than ever.However, the writers clearly make an effort to tie all three movies together. In fact, do yourself a favor and watch the Bourne Identity before you watch the Bourne Ultimatum. Many minor details from the first become critical plot elements in the third.While I can watch the Bourne Identity again and again, I am afraid the Bourne Ultimatum has about the same weight as the Bourne Supremacy. Not that it isn't any good. Rather, it lacks the intensity of the first and the electric exchanges between Cooper and Cox.4 out of 5",8,3,7,4 August 2007
The Bourne Identity," Can't Get Enough
","Spy films are so clich√© since the Cold War ended that I simply gave up because no one seemed to figure out how to make a spy film relevant to today--until I saw the Bourne Identity. It just came out of nowhere and left me floored. Having never heard of the Ludlum books, I quickly read the first installment and had to sadly conclude that the movie was better than the book! Largely because the book was embarrassingly out of date in today's wifi blackberry world. It is no wonder why Ludlum wanted to do an update of the book.As far as the unreality of Bourne snapping and not executing his mission, thoughtful reflection reveals that it makes perfect sense. Bourne 'doesn't exist.' His mission was to kill Wambosi and the only explanation was a member of the crew. But Wambosi's child saw him which blew his cover. Killing the kid wasn't part of his mission, leaving him no choice but to flee.Lots of people moan about the dissimilarities to the book, Richard Chamberlain, yada yada yada. My guess is these people are not Gen X/Yers because I certainly can't even remember having seen a movie with Richard Chamberlain let alone some made-for-TV-junk. So if you're sacked out at the parents/grandparents, I guess you'll have to pop the betamax of Chamberlain in, but as soon as they doze off, pop this DVD in! It rocks!",10,0,1,22 May 2006
Ratatouille," Some parts are brilliant
","Not Pixar's best and I for one love food and cooking.Every movie needs to suspend reality for its audience but this movie seemed to suffer from an uncomfortable case of stage fright. To be sure, an infestation of rats is not the most pleasant subject even in animation. But instead of ignoring this fact, Brad Bird goes to rather painful lengths to explain every minute detail of Remy and Linguini's unusual relationship. The problem is: if you're a child, such explanations are unintelligible and if you're an adult they strain believability and do little to advance the plot or develop the characterization, which are far more important than why Remy doesn't walk on all fours.The kitchen and the sewer are teaming with chefs and rats and trying to keep each character straight let alone appreciate each of their quirks is challenging to say the least. Here again, instead of letting the characters introduce themselves in a memorable fashion, Bird seems intent on spelling it out for the viewer which is neither lasting nor helpful. But most importantly none of the characters are lovable. Let's face it, this is a kids movie that even adults should find palatable but I was as annoyed with Linguini as the top chef and the rest of the staff with his constant psychoanalysis. The only truly memorable character was O'Toole as Anton Ego, perhaps a little over the top but masterfully concluded.Throughout the movie I found myself questioning the direction of the storyline. The beauty of CG is that each scene can be essentially shot and reshot again and again unlike traditional film making. Having watched most of the DVD extras for Toy Story, Monsters, Cars, etc. I know to what extent the Pixar animators tweak each element of the storyboard to make a cohesive whole. However, Ratatouille seems to lack such cohesion. The opening sequence on the farm seems disconnected from the rest of the movie and Ratatouille's conversations with Gusteau is served up as an odd accompaniment throughout.To be sure, the animation is stellar and Pixar raises the bar with each new movie. Apparently, this movie completes a list initially envisioned by the creative think tank at Pixar long before Toy Story and A Bugs' Life. However, in this case the best was not saved for last.",7,0,3,12 July 2007
2012," Special Effects Extravaganza
","Every so often Hollywood manages to up the ante when it comes to special effects. Assuredly, the thrill of this movie comes in the moments spent wondering how will it look when the world ends. Emmerich doesn't disappoint.John Cusack stars as an everyman who doesn't save the world a la Randy Quaid style in Independence Day, but instead as an example of 'nature choosing her own from among her own.' This rather unique element lends the story a sense of credence as one imagines that is just how the apocalypse might play out: random nothing short of miraculous survivors alongside the wholly undeserving. However, the impersonal becomes personal at the conclusion as unlikely survivors are snuffed out gratuitously and cruelly.Makes one wonder what 2022 will be like in 10 years.",6,0,0,2 December 2009
I Am Legend," Poses some interesting questions, but does little to answer them
","From the opening scene with Emma Thompson (uncredited), the intelligent moviegoer knows what's next. What's not to so obvious is why Will Smith is the last one on Manhattan island. Manhattan is a crown jewel and to think that all the uninfected/immune people would simply flee the island as fast as their feet would take them versus introducing the subhuman infected to Smith & Wesson is not clear. Now granted, just Will Smith versus all those humanoids is a losing prospect from the beginning. But given a small, immune, heavily armed contingent with floodlights, I am sure Manhattan would be infection free in a matter of weeks, not years.Now 1.5 million people live on Manhattan. If 90% are killed by the virus that leaves 150,000. Supposedly 90% of those not killed become infected. That leaves 15,000 immune versus 135,000 ravenous, belligerent infected. Now you may think the odds are overwhelming, but if you study the Spanish conquest of the Mayan civilization you will understand why gunpowder was invented and why numbers are irrelevant when your foe is unarmed.Now granted, I Am Legend is not about how Will Smith ended up all alone three years after the outbreak, but one does wonder how he managed to survive all those years on his own. The movie does posit the potential of the infected somehow becoming smart, devious, cunning or what have you, as is the question of isolation a la Castaway. But while interesting, they are subplots to the larger theme of Will's quest for a anti-virus.Now I am not going to criticize the Will Smith's of the world who rather find a cure versus kill 'em all. But my gut tells me that if such a scenario ever truly played out, the real conflict would be in the politics of those who wanted to extend compassion versus those who had another agenda and I doubt that they would wait for an election.",7,0,2,29 December 2007
Transformers," Surprisingly Good
","From the opening sequence this movie never let up. I never followed the cartoon series, but what surprised me the most about this movie was the realistic intensity of the military sequences.I would have been tempted to give this movie 10 stars in the same category as Bourne Identity, a personal favorite. However, at times the movie took on an Independence Day cheeziness as the heroes consisted of a bunch of misfits clashing with the stereotypically inept g-men which amounts to little more than political statements that I find particularly bland and stupid. However, it is partially redeemed by the efforts of the special ops forces in the end. But rather than watch Shia Lebouef be transformed from his experience, he simply ends up with the girl in the end.Also, what's the deal with the glasses? They are imprinted with the navigation coordinates of the Cube's whereabouts circa late 19th century which happens to be the not yet built Hoover dam? Go figure.",7,1,2,30 March 2008
Groundhog Day," I can watch this again and again and again...
","Long before the internet and IMDb there was this movie that I simply adored. Imagine my pleasure to learn that this movie occupies a spot on the top #250. A true testament to its appeal.I have many favorite movies that are comedies but what sets Groundhog Day apart from the rest is its message of redemption. Okay, maybe that is a message that today's post-modern moviegoers don't want to hear. But some odd coincidences with my own life endowed the movie with an unusual resonance for me personally. For example, I had taken up studying piano and Rachmaninoff's 18th Variation was one of the pieces I aspired to master (q.v. the dance at the end). I also had read many Chekhov works (q.v. Murray quoting Chekhov in one of his broadcasts from Punxsutawney).Bottomline, if you find this movie distasteful, I can only assume that you too are stuck in your own groundhog day.",10,2,4,23 November 2006
Pulp Fiction," Shocking
","Fortunately I only caught pieces of this trash on cable where the language and other filth were edited. Only some sort of strange perverted voyeurism can explain why the redemption of assassins, sodomites, and other sociopaths garners such attention. Or perhaps most of the movie going public is not that far removed from the experiences of these miscreants, and any message of unburdened hope is received with resounding aplomb. The next thing we know people will be claiming pornography possesses redeeming cultural qualities and Oscar performances befitting the publick's adulations. Or has Boogie Nights already claimed that role? Whatever the case, Pulp Friction is just another post-modern nihilistic romp.I guess I can take comfort in the fact that my 1 out of 10 stars vote will depress the rating of this film even though the usefulness of my comment will get many 'No' votes. So, go ahead and vote away and confirm my suspicions. Your favorite movie still has a 1 vote in IMDb from me, and I enjoy watching them add up!Last count, 11 people found my comment unuseful!",1,17,40,23 November 2006
The Holiday," In True Nancy Meyers's Form
","Given that this was not Nancy Meyers's first movie to have written, directed, and produced I was hoping for something a little more appealing. I thought the goofy French soundtrack of Something's Gotta Give was just part of the Bohemian fabric. I now know that this is simply Meyers's style where mature adults run around acting like rabbits.Meyers starts with Kate Winslet pining away in her hopelessly quaint and romantic London cottage for a former/current, now-engaged-to-someone-else lover. Cameron Diaz on the other hand kicks her lover out of her LA mansion because he was humping his secretary. The magic to resolve their guy problems is swapping houses for the Christmas holidays.What follows is not much different although I was surprised they didn't swap lovers as well. A mere six hours in London and Diaz is copulating with the widowed Jude Law, who despite his vulnerable state can't keep his pants on even in his sister's house. Winslet pines away in LA, but we know she will eventually copulate with Jack Black.Such an vapid plot leads one to conclude that Meyer's solution to infidelity, which everyone seems to suffer from with the exception of Law, is finding someone else to hump, even if you have to travel half way across the globe.",4,2,8,17 July 2007
Inception," OK I Get It
","First off, I resisted watching this film after all the hype. I hate pretension in a movie, q.v. my IMDb review of Vanilla Sky (I didn't want to watch a movie that required 'heavy lifting'). And more importantly I hate DiCaprio, q.v. my DiCaprio reviews. But this past Friday my wife popped in the DVD, and I proceeded to lazily watch, barely awake, and quite tired after a long week. By the end, I was fully awake which is why I give it 6/10.All in all, a good pic. But for me, I will not be spending long periods pondering it's metaphysical blah, blah, blah. I mean, I get it. I understand that Cobb and his wife were stuck in a limbo and he planted the idea that the world was fake which stayed with her in an awakened state. I get that Cobb and his team were attempting the same with Fischer.But what I don't get (read: stupid plot points imo) is: why is Leo was an international man of mystery on the run for his wife's suicide? Or, why Saito could make a phone call and make all of Cobb's problems go away. Or, why being asleep for 8 or 10 hours could feel like your stuck in limbo for dozens of years. And last of all: the stupid cut at the end with the top still spinning.Apparently, the director spends more time fielding questions about the ending than anything else. Serves him right.So here is my suggestion: pretend you're in a dream watching this movie, and 'kick' yourself just before Leo spins the top at the end. This can be effectively accomplished by hitting the eject button on your remote.",6,3,7,6 March 2011
Vanilla Sky," Not Heavy Lifting
","Cameron Crowe and Tom Cruise have so much in common with David Aames that this movie is a first: a Bi-Biopic. Roger Ebert claimed the film requires heavy lifting from its audience which only confirms that his brain is fried. Faulkner this is not. Pop-friction it is.Only time will tell if any of Crowe's films will become timeless. However, his constant reliance on pop music to deliver the emotional climaxes in key scenes (q.v. the Beach Boys 'Good Vibrations') firmly roots his movies in the Now. As a result, I am convinced the only timelessness this movie possesses is yet another Baby Boomer's narcissistic exploration of the possibility of immortality.Yet, are we really to believe that Aames, Crowe, or Cruise would actually pull the plug on themselves? According to Crowe, sure, if their lucid dream becomes anything less than a narcissistic fantasy. And, as a GenX'er I sincerely hope it does because I dread a future with Crowe or Cruise still in it sharing with the world more biopics about their immortality.",4,2,5,1 May 2007
Mr. Holland's Opus," A Baby Boomer's Opus
","Mr. Holland's life is punctuated by the overtly boomer exponent of Vietnam, and John Lennon is constantly revisited like a worn out coda. Yet the producers try to instill some musical integrity by making a reference to John Coltrane, an irrelevant figure for most boomers and especially Mr. Holland as not one Coltrane song figures in this movie. But more importantly Elvis's death goes unmentioned, who arguably influenced rock and roll far more than the over-commercialized, chocolate box, Brit-pop of the Beatles or the period pieces of the anti-war activists of the late 60s and early 70s.Why is this? First, Elvis only spoke to the very earliest of the baby boomers as he himself actually preceded the boomers. By the 60s he was largely making movies and had been replaced by the British Invasion. Second, Elvis was intensely patriotic by most boomer standards having served his draft notice instead of burning the card. And yet I have a hard time distinguishing Mr. Holland from his boomer pupils.The biggest irony is Mr. Holland's performance of Lennon's 'Beautiful Boy' which serves as a reconciliation with Cole. Not only does it raise serious questions about Mr. Holland's inspiration since he borrows someone else's material to express his deepest emotions, but Lennon released this song on his last album before his death which he wrote for his son, Sean, not the estranged Julian. And juxtaposed to this is Julian Lennon's performance of 'Cole's Song' which also raises more questions than it answers.Thus, it is easy to see that Mr. Holland and his students are merely archetypes for John Lennon and his boomer fans. Plain and simple. Whatever that has to do with Beethoven, music in general, or inspirational teaching for that matter, I have no idea.",5,1,6,20 May 2007
Happy Feet," Unengaging
","As a father of three young'uns I have developed (however unwillingly) quite a knowledge of movies aimed at children. It is a rare movie that can find the balance between entertaining kids and adults. Unfortunately, this movie does neither. The best, and most honest, critics are children, and my children tired of this movie very quickly.Of course, the Hollywood cognescenti were falling over themselves to elevate this movie in the eyes of the public and the reason why became blatantly obvious from the first few minutes. Personally I would rather sit through anti-PC Looney Tunes than bow to the Follywood elite.One extra line to get IMDb to accept this comment!",4,1,2,12 May 2007
