","From Wikipedia: 'Historical records do not suggest that Smith and Pocahontas were lovers, or even that she was a suitable age for such a relationship.

Accounts of such a romance have been repeated in films made in the United States as late as 2009.' Of course, who can trust wikipedia? Particularly when it contradicts the authoritative account of Hollywood.",3,1,1,26 December 2013
