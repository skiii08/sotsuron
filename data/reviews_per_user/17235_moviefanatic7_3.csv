Lucky Number Slevin," slick, fun, exciting, cool, and surprising
","slick, fun, exciting, cool, and with a shocker ending, this movie does it all. You have to see this movie, when you are done watching, you will be left feeling like this is the funniest, coolest movie you've seen. It has the elements of all great movies: suspense, mystery, comedy, its cool, and it has a shocker ending. what more could you want. the cast is awesome and does a fantastic job.Josh hartnett plays a confused, average Joe who is mistaken for someone else. He is captured by two men and taken to one of the two most feared crime bosses (freeman). He is told to kill the other crime boss homosexual son (kingsley).well, then he is captured by two other guys and taken to the other boss, and told to kill the crime boss he was taken to before that. It is extremely funny all the way and yet interesting to watch. Bruce Willis place a top notch assassin, but if i tell you too much about his character, ill give the movie away, so i won't. You should definitely take the time to see this movie.",9,2,5,21 September 2006
Little Miss Sunshine," hilarious, dark comedy feel-good movie
","little miss sunshine takes daily life and makes it hilarious. It is about a dysfunctional family taking their daughter 700 miles to go to a beauty pageant. The father is only about winning, the mother is always fighting, the grandpa is on heroine, the son is taking a vow of silence until he can go into military school, and the mothers brother (carell)tried to commit suicide and failed. Their trip leads lots of funny happenings that are too funny to give away You must see this movie. every member of the cast does a fantastic job, even the little girl is amazing. and the best thing of all, it isn't some sappy movie with an ending where everything turns out really happy in the ending and everybody lives happily ever after. this movie keeps getting funny and even when you think it is going to be sappy, it turns out hilarious again, and it is not very sad.this is probably the funniest movie i have seen, it is one of my three favorite movies, along with lucky number slevin and the last samurai.",10,1,4,21 September 2006
Dreamgirls," phenomenal acting, bad movie
","i went in to this movie, i am sorry to say, with a closed mind. i figured it would be lame and boring and horrible all around, a complete waste of my time. i was proved wrong and right.first, the acting was Phenomenal. especially Jennifer Hudson, who had never acted or practiced very much before. Jamie foxx was also wonderful. The scripting was very good. there was no lame dialogue or cheesy or corny parts in the movie.but i thought it didn't accomplish what is was intended to do. it was supposed to show how harsh the music business is and how hard it is to become famous and get on the pop charts. The girls get on the pop charts very easily and it doesn't really show how harsh the music industry is. also, it was supposed to show the start of Motown. it didn't have anything to do with Motown except for one two minute scene with a song of the Jackson brothers. and last, they ruined the musical part of it. considering this was originally a Broadway musical, it should of had more scenes were instead of talking they sang. but the only parts like that were when they were performing, or fighting with each other.personally i think you should go see this movie just to see the phenomenal new actor Jennifer Hudson, and listen to the singing (even though it is not my kind of music, it was great singing). so, enjoy",4,1,4,20 January 2007
