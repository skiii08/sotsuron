The Twilight Saga: Breaking Dawn - Part 1," Fans will love it!
","Breaking Dawn, Part 1 was MUCH better than Eclipse. I'm reading a lot of bad reviews, everybody is entitled to their own opinion and maybe the movie wasn't for them. I'm not a teenager and at first refused to have anything to do with a 'stupid movie about a stupid vampire that pretends to be a teenager.' Then one day out of sheer boredom rented Twilight on PPV was of course was hooked. And yes, females will enjoy this movie more as they are more in-tuned with the idea of falling in love and romance.Most reviews complained about the amount of romance, hugging, kiss, etc. This movie is about the romance of a newly married couple. Most newlyweds do these activities, constantly. Sure, they are far from your average newlyweds. It was amazing to see Bella walking down the aisle looking like she was going to pass out at any second but whenever she saw Edward it was if she forgot to be nervous. There were cheesy moments and funny moments. Charlie's wedding speech was hilarious.What amazed me was that they actually filmed the birth scene just like it was in the book. Being that the Twilight Saga has a pretty young fan base I wasn't sure how they would approach the issue of sex and childbirth. Especially a birth as abnormal as the one Bella had. I thought Bill Condon did a great job. You get romance, love, happiness, illness, horror and death all in under 2 hours.It was kind of sad seeing Bella cleaned, dressed and fixed up just as though she were being laid out for a funeral. But the most amazing part of the whole movie was watching her body regenerate as the venom went through her veins. And when her eyes opened at the end, I knew then that I wouldn't be able to wait a year for the next one! Again, this movie may not be for everyone but most fans will appreciate it.",8,6,16,19 November 2011
