Skyfall," Sometimes old things work best...
","As they say in the movie, sometimes old things work best. The makers of this film should have heeded their own advice and stuck to the good old Bond recipe (mainly action with a touch of English class). Instead they tried to flesh out characters that were never really designed to be profound in the first place, and to give them existential qualms. The result is better than the last Batman movie, where the same thing was attempted, but is still seriously flawed. It's not a real Bond movie anymore, but it does not do a good enough job with the characters and plot to make it into the group of intellectually stimulating movies...__Main pros__: <ul><li>The general theme of aging and obsolescence in a quickly evolving world is very consistently developed throughout the movie - first and foremost by Craig's interpretation of an aging, depressed Bond, but also through the choice of locations (Battleship island, the old Scottish manor), the allusions to previous Bond movies (Goldfinger, Goldeneye), the replacement of Q by a smart but inexperienced youngster, the absence of gadgets, the depressing, stereotypical English rain... This consistency gives a nice atmosphere to the movie that makes it enjoyable to watch even through its slow parts.</li></ul><ul><li>The photography is great, and so are the locations (Battleship Island!), though they feel somewhat underused.</li></ul><ul><li>The directing is also very good. The first 10 minutes are classic Bond material, and are followed by a very nice opening sequence despite the rather weak Adele song - at that point I had high hopes for the movie. The final fight is also well executed.</li></ul><ul><li>Great acting by Javier Bardem, despite the weirdness of his character.</li></ul><ul><li>We get rid of Dench! But Fiennes is wasted on M - he would make a much better Bond than Craig IMO.</li></ul><ul><li>A touch of humor - this is an essential element of the Bond recipe and was sorely lacking in the last few installments.</li></ul>__Main cons__: <ul><li>The plot is weak, even by Bond standards! The oh-so-important list of undercover agents is forgotten halfway through the movie. The villain's motives are not believable. Bond's plan of luring Silva and his goons to Skyfall knowing that he will have to face them with a few antique rifles and an old Scottish housekeeper makes no sense whatsoever.</li></ul><ul><li>The movie is at least 30 minutes too long. The middle part lacks action and feels drawn out.</li></ul><ul><li>Many elements seem arbitrary and out of place: Silva's homosexual innuendo to which Bond replies that it might not be his first time (and actually sounds serious too! Bond, the epitome of heterosexuality who has been screwing the most beautiful girls for 50 years!), the underused, underdeveloped Bond girl who just has the time for a quick shower before dying after 10 minutes of airtime, the subway crash scene...</li></ul><ul><li>The hacking scenes. Make them believable for heaven's sake! Especially since they are a replacement for Q's gadgets in previous movies...</li></ul>All in all, the movie does not live up to the hype - exactly like the last Batman. Oh, and also like Prometheus. I'm starting to see a trend here...",5,6,15,5 November 2012
Ted," Corny romance trying too hard to be politically incorrect - or are we Europeans too jaded?
","While I enjoyed some of the jokes and laughed a couple of times, it felt like McFarlane was trying to be politically incorrect for the heck of it. Especially since the incorrectness is actually rather clich√©d and will not be hurting many people's feelings, at least here in Europe.To make doubly sure that no feelings get hurt, McFarlane wraps the jokes in a tidy package of harmless romantic comedy with cardboard-cutout actors, predictable plot and corny happy ending, that will soothe and reassure the viewer with the palette of emotions that he is accustomed to find in most Hollywood blockbusters.Do yourself a favor -- skip this movie and watch Monty Python and the Holy Grail (for the 100th time) instead!",3,8,15,22 October 2012
Looper," Time travel does not have to be overly complicated...
","A very intelligent and elegant movie. Some reviews here on IMDb say it lacks ambition or depth, that the motivations and rules behind time travel are not explained enough. I disagree. While the director could have chosen to deliberately obfuscate things (fairly easy to do when time travel is involved) to make the movie look 'deep', he focused on a tight storyline and convincing character development, letting your imagination fill in the details. This results in one of the rare time travel movies that is at the same time thought-provoking and easy to follow. Not a small feat in my opinion!The actors are excellent (the little boy fits perfectly as the 'future-that-was' Rainmaker), and the relatively slow pace (compared to an action movie) gives them time to show it; it also lets the atmosphere sink in. The depiction of poverty and vagrancy-ridden 2044 is also rather convincing, although I have a hard time believing our current-day car models will still run in 30 years, even grafted with solar panels - I don't know whether this is deliberate or if the budget allocated to the sets was tight (probably the latter). No big deal though - the movie is much better than many million-dollar blockbusters with perfect sets.My main gripe was with the ending; I did not find young Joe's final decision to be completely credible. He spent most of the movie fighting against his loop to protect his own future, and is turned a bit too quickly by his very recent bonding with the Rainmaker kid, and the possibility of letting the latter take the 'good track' (even if Joe's own childhood experience does provide some explanation).All in all, a very enjoyable movie that I would heartily recommend.",8,0,3,19 November 2012
Cloud Atlas," Commendable adaptation
","Having read the book, I was on familiar grounds from the start and could probably better appreciate the movie's qualities than spectators who had to adapt to the storytelling concept 'from scratch'. That being said, having read the book also lowered my expectations somewhat, since no movie can ever rival a book for such things as, e.g., philosophical reflection or character development - and this is particularly true for a novel such as Cloud Atlas.There is some 'dumbing down' of the book's message. The book reflects on the nature of Man, and on how mankind's strengths and weaknesses bring about a never-ending ebb and flow of civilizations that, despite their apparent differences, are built on similar patterns of power and control. The movie translates this into how people exist for and through others, in their time but also in the past and future. The book also introduced connections between protagonists (the birthmark, elements of a storyline mentioned in other ones) so the movie's message, though over-simplified, is adequate. The same can be said about the other liberties the directors took with respect to the novel - they can be understood in the light of the target audience (broader for a movie than for a novel) and the medium. Only the Frobisher story, one of my favorite in the book, badly betrays the novel, making Frobisher's suicide seem pointless. Then again, the epistolary style of the corresponding book part and Frobisher's bittersweet reflections are not easily translated into film...Apart from that, the adaptation of this reportedly unadaptable novel is commendable. The directors' choice of interweaving the story lines deviates from the novel but works very well, with neat visual analogies between plots. Clearly, lots of thought has gone into the subdivision and alignment of story lines, giving the movie a very polished feel. The actors are perfect and the makeups are an impressive achievement (some of the Male/Female-Caucasian/Asian morphs look weird but are still quite believable). The entire movie is very beautiful and atmospheric; the Matrix-inspired action sequences (mainly in the Sonmi subplot) and comic relief (Cavendish subplot) are not overdone as I feared they would be.All in all, a great (if not perfect) adaptation of a difficult book. After all, taking liberties also shows you've understood the work and gives the reader-viewers food for thought!",8,4,5,25 March 2013
