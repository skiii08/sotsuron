Borat: Cultural Learnings of America for Make Benefit Glorious Nation of Kazakhstan," Crude pranks with very brief moments of laughter, nothing more.
","I'm not American, Kazakh, Jew, Gypsy, Christian or whatever else in order to have a relationship with the movie, therefore I think I can be pretty much impartial First of all, the Borat character should not be taken seriously. He does not speak like a Kazakh, accent is nowhere near a Kazakh's English (It's a very thick East European accent which you can catch from miles away). He's way off being a Kazakh. So Kazakhstan need not worry about Borat humiliating Kazakh people. The only offending image was the image of the car when the Kazakh anthem was bragging about Kazakhstan's superior industry.I'm not easily offended by explicit language and harsh jokes or male nudity. There are indeed some funny moments though, here and there. The humor is not for everyone, although I believe this is kind of sense of humor we used to have when we were 8 year old naughty boys. The elevator scene was funny, but two naked guys fighting in bed was not funny at all.I don't care about the Antisemitism or whatever there is in the movie to supposedly offense the audience in order to create oppositions and attract attention. But I find it remarkable how durable the political correctness of an average American is, easily dissolving after a two minute chat with a bizarre Kazakh guy. Like right after Borat asks 'which one do you recommend to shoot a Jew?'. and the guy selling guns going 'a 9 mm or a 45.' without any hesitation.The movie has no plot to talk about, had no remarkable moments, and is washed all over with crude pranks. The only thing to talk about is 'were these guys really in the game, or are their reactions genuine'. My vote is 2/10.",2,22,42,5 January 2007
