E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial," A tender master piece for all ages
","Really, this is one of the most memorable movies I have ever seen. I saw the movie two or three times when it was displayed. I was a child and now that I have my kids I just saw it again because I wanted that they feel the same. The magic is still there.",10,2,4,4 April 2002
The Elephant Man," I finally watched and didn't disappoint me
","After a long time debating myself if I really wanted to watch this movie, I finally got the courage to rent it and watch it and to be honest with you, I really love it. I was afraid of start crying or to have pity or to feel sorry or having all type of sad emotions all together.Movies of this nature, with people with such denigrating conditions are usually sorrow and at the end you feel that you were in hospital of hopeless people, this movie brings you from sadness to happiness, to reality, but most of everything to understand what the human race is capable and that is: a melting pot of feelings from the most good to the most evil.Even though the elephant man knew that his ill was incurable, that he might have had an inconsolable childhood, that he was treated like a freak even worse than an animal, he was a normal person, smart and really sociable. Similar to real live, most people just see the exterior and don't see inside, most of the times the opposite happens when you see beautiful people with an ugly heart, this movie was great in showing all the contrary. In the bright side, there are and always will be people that help others and don't worry about their external characteristics and their actions resonate louder and louder, in a way that fights the barriers of social classes, fame and time.In summary, it was a really a great experience to watch this movie, please watch it without prejudice.",10,0,2,25 January 2013
Inception," What an excellent Movie!!!
","This is one of the most interesting movies you will ever see. It has great performances, starting with Dicaprio whom, from my standpoint, is the actor that choose the best movies to be in nowadays. The theme is completely outstanding. It's well thought, it's different, it keeps you thinking, it keeps you guessing and if you loose only one minute of the movie you'll be lost. So, when you combine all what makes a movie a classic, one that will be studied after ten years of release it, then you have to agree that the directing work is magnificent and that's what Christopher Nolan has demonstrated in other movies (Batman, Memento), but specially in this one with a such complicated script (also written by him).Don't loose this movie, watch it more than once,watch it with company, and I know for a fact that you won't forget it and you'll talk about it for a long time.",10,1,7,30 January 2011
Green Book," A must see movie with exceptional actors
","More than the main topic treated in the movie, which is very well depicted, I think this movie is a must see because it brings the best from every person. It touches those sentiments and emotions that are almost forgotten nowadays, like compassion, true friendship, solidarity, courage, and obviously love. This is an story rare for today's superhero and marvel blockbusters, it's about being humans, good humans. And what makes this movie really unforgettable is the acting from these two individuals that captivate the audience, and make us feel that we are with them all the way. Vigo and Mahersala are superb in their roles and regardless of getting oscar nods or not whoever sees the movie will understand why movies last forever. This one stays forever, it's exceptional.",10,2,6,28 November 2018
Dodgeball," Not good messages in this comedy
","The comedy itself is good because it makes you laugh and that's the objective, but behind this movie you can't see any good message. The world is modern and times have changed but i think that some behaviours could be showed in other sense. There are sexual moralities that can be acceptable but they are not normals. Oh, another thing, it's disappointing to see some old stars with just too little scenes, it's almost a shame. Comedies have to be evaluated in different perspectives, cause their main purpose is make you laugh but remember that children are exposed to this type of movies and you don't want your children think that life don't worth nothing.",4,1,2,5 August 2004
