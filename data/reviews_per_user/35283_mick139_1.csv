Raiders of the Lost Ark," If Adventure Has A Name It Must Be Indiana Jones!
","I remember watching these films as a boy and thinking... these suck. Since then I have watched and read many Greatest Films polls over the years and Indiana Jones or at least Raiders of The Lost Ark were on all of them and just couldn't understand it. I hated these movies.Then about a month ago I was bored in the house, nothing to do channel surfing and I came across a film, I didn't no what it was but saw Alfred Molina (Doc OCK in Spider-Man 2) and thought I would give it a chance, when suddenly Molinas accomplice tried to shot the man, faced covered, in front of them, the man expertly used a whipped to disarm the man, he stepped forward to reveal, Harrison Ford! Dam, I thought it's Indiana Jones, with nothing else on I forced myself to keep watching. As I watched Indiana Jones had achieved his goal avoided arrows, been betrayed, lost his prize, nearly been trapped, nearly fell to his death, got his prize back, avoided a rolling boulder, had his prize stolen again, been chased by a tribe of (I think) South Americans, got in a plane, flew of to safety and found a snake in his seat. Sounds like a great film doesn't it, however, the film proper hadn't even started yet, this all happened inside the first ten minutes.The story itself is starts as Indiana Jones is approached by the US Government to find the Lost Ark of Covenant, the original stone tablets given to Moses by God bearing the Ten Comandments. They have received information that Hitler(who shows up in the third film) has hired Belloq a rival archaeologist, who also stole from Indiana Jones (gotta love that name) previously. accepting the challenge he goes in search of his old teacher looking for an artifact and meets a former love. The real adventure begins here as Indiana Jones risks life and limb to find the Ark before the Nazis do.Directed by Steven Spielberg and starring Harrison Ford Raiders of the Lost Ark is a masterpiece filled with humour, romance, suspense and of course action. The only thing i would change about this film is its release date so that i could go and see it for the first time on the big screen.",10,0,1,9 December 2005
