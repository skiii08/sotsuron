The Sound of Music," I've watched this movie more than a hundred times.
","I absolutely love this movie! Well, yeah, I'm a sucker for musicals, but this one's the best in film that I've ever seen.First and foremost, the casting was great. Julie Andrews did perfectly well as Maria. Her interpretation was more than appropriate. Christopher Plummer did well, too, only he would have been better if he was the one who sang (or was he?) The kids really looked alike! I especially liked that cute little Gretl.The songs blew me away. Julie Andrews' voice gives me goose bumps! I just love her singing voice.The choreography was a blast, too. It was very similar to theater choreography: lively, unshamefully exaggerated, and graceful.Hands down: this is a can't miss classic.",10,1,7,29 February 2000
