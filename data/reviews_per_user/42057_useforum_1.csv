Borat: Cultural Learnings of America for Make Benefit Glorious Nation of Kazakhstan," A great movie presenting the American knowledge of the outside world
","I cannot agree with anyone who writes that this movie is offensive and harmful in its content and nothing more. I would like you to look at this movie from a distant perspective of a person not living in the USA. Can you see what Borat is depicting in this movie? He's joking about the Jews, he's talking about hitting gypsies with a Hammer. And what kind of response he is getting? They applaud him and they agree with him, I couldn't spot any person in this movie that was truly arguing with him, they understood that his opinions were extreme and they took them with ease. What does it really show? How egocentric and uneducated the people are. How prejudices are still present and how easy it is to agree with somebody when extreme topics have been raised by someone else. I loved the movie, I had plenty of laughs. Next time you watch it, try to discover what message this film is broadcasting about the common people in the USA. Especially when they are singing 'Throw the Jew down the well' with Borat. Watch it if just for this reason.",9,3,7,24 August 2007
