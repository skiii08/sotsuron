The Blair Witch Project," Disappointed - to say the least
","I very much wanted to like this movie. I very much wanted to be scared by this movie. I watched it at nearly midnight, the latest, darkest, scariest time I could find. Throughout the entire film, I kept waiting to be scared - I never was. I kept waiting for something scary to happen - it never did. I was never on the edge of my seat; there was never any reason to be. Instead it was all I could do to stay awake from boredom. This was more a 'movie' of three people simply lost in the woods. I found the 'actors' rather annoying. I felt the movie was quite repetitive and frustrating, and I just wanted it to hurry up and end so I could be put out of my misery. The premise was promising - but this movie just didn't do anything for me.",2,0,2,5 August 1999
