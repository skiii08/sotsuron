Iron Man 3," Top 3 Reasons to see Iron Man 3
","Here we go, and don't worry...No spoilers here.1- Tony Stark has been one of the best developed characters on the big screen, comic book movie or not, it's hard to argue. In the Avenger's Captain America said to Tony 'Take away the suit of Armor and what are you?' I think this movie was almost created to answer that question. This film does really show what drives Tony and how even without the suit, he IS Iron Man. In Iron Man 3, you will see how all the events of the first 2 IM films and the Avengers have shaped, molded, and changed Tony, for better or for worse. Like I said, one of the best developed Characters ever...hats off to the Marvel Gang and New-comer (To Marvel films) Director/Co-writer Shane Black.2- The Score, the original music composed for the Film, was mighty, pulse-pounding, and highly thematic. I'm one of those nuts who really pays attention to what the score does for a film. Most scores do well to just accompany the film, others take it to a new level. The IM1 score had a really energetic and modern beat to it, it suited it really well. The IM2 score, really fell flat for me, it did not hearken back to the score of IM1 and although it didn't take away from the film, it certainly didn't enhance it. The score for IM3 had some resonance from IM1 but brought a whole new flare, and a lot of heart. Well done composer, Brian Tyler.3- The Hardware, yes I did emphasize how well the movie does to show who Tony is without the suit, but it once again shows just how genius he is with his suit...errr...in this film's case, suits. The suits are big nod to some of the awesome suits that have been created over decades in the comics, and their purpose in the film is well played out. I was particularly impressed at how the Mark 42 (The mostly gold suit that he wears in the film) was utilized, so many different scenarios occurred with it. Once again, well done, IM3 Team.Now, these are by no means the only things I enjoyed, but my 'Top 3 for Iron Man 3', there are plenty of other reasons to give love to this film, but much of those are too 'spoiler-y'. So, if you haven't already seen or made plans to see Iron Man 3, go do yourself a solid and make those plans to do so and enjoy another adventure with Tony Stark, The Armored Avenger.",9,21,45,4 May 2013
