The Avengers," Kids will like it but the story pretty cheezy for adults
","My kids 10 and 7 liked it (although they got fidgety during some of the long over drawn out conversation sequences). I thought it was pretty dumb. I grew up with comic books and still read them but all these live action films just fall flat. First of Captain America's costume is ridiculous. Looks like something from the movies of 20 years ago, cheap materials galore. I'm really surprised to see so many favorable reviews of this movie. The 'comic lines' in the film mostly by Tony Stark are the cheeziest bunch of dad jokes I've heard. The action scenes are good for the most part but again in today's society someone dressed up like captain America would look like a raving lunatic.",1,24,74,12 May 2012
Suicide Squad," Corny and predictable
","Talk about corny jokes, this movie is full of them. The story is so predictable and the characters are not good at all. Will Smith as Deadshot, bad, Harley Quinn, annoying, Killer Croc unbelievable, boomerang dumb, Joker just ridiculous.How did this movie get a 6.8? This was just dumb and the plot made no sense. Where are all the regular super heroes that originally caught the ss? Flash, Batman, etc...I really didn't want to see this to begin with cause even the previews looked corny and bad but my son wanted to go so I took him. Save your money and watch it on video, it won't be long.",1,233,379,20 August 2016
Star Wars: Episode IX - The Rise of Skywalker," Corny jokes and bad acting ruin this mess
",Too many corny lines in this mess of a story. Why the insistence on trying to make this a comedy? Actors are an absolute joke. Story is boring and drawn out. Yuck this movie was just bad.,1,8,15,29 March 2020
