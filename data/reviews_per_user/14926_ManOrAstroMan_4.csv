Catch Me If You Can," One Good Movie
","What makes this movie as compelling as it is must be that it's based on a true story.  Otherwise, it would just be fiction about some fictional liar...man, was it intelligent.  You can see irony, voice, wit and sarcasm splashed throughout this gem of a film.  It kept everyone in the theatre entertained, young and old alike.  I'm 17 and I thought it was brilliant. This is because the story, at its roots, is the realization of every brief, passing dream of wealth, notoriety and grandeur we have ever had. That is all we want, all that Frank wanted: the notoriety.",8,0,1,16 January 2003
10 Things I Hate About You," 10 Things I Liked About This Movie
","I never used to get into the teenager movies, despite being born just as the genre took off.  I don't quite fit the mold of the person these films are targeted at either.  But I love this movie, sadly, and many more like it now.  I offer now 10 Things I Liked About This Movie...1. Julia Stiles - College Goddess!2. Cameron's car3. Kat was so frigging funny at times!4. Larry Miller (I) as Bianca and Kat's father (his mama didn't raise no fool!)5. The hilarious rumors people spread about Heath Ledger's character early in the film6. 'quivering member'7. Ledger's singing in the bleachers8. Mr. Stratford's pregnancy suit9. Bianca, um...(trying not to spoil)...'striking' Joey at the dance10. More Julia StilesOverall, I gave it an 8/10.",8,1,2,7 March 2003
BASEketball," Toddlers, yes toddlers...
","I must have the taste of a pothead truck driver, but I liked this movie.  As a sports fan, a lot of the humor made sense to me in a movie that otherwise made little sense.  It is a fun 'hangin' with friends, rentin' a movie' type of film.  Not bad, but for the plot it could have been better.Final Score: a psyched-out 5/10.",6,1,3,28 April 2003
Donnie Darko," Best. Insanity. Ever.
","This movie, without a shadow of a doubt, is one of the most perplexing, trippiest films I've ever seen and that's a good thing, folks.  A damn good thing!  Great cinematography, beautiful storyline, well-acted, a score fitting of merit.  This movie is definitely a must-see even if you've seen it already. Final Score: a giant bunny-inspired 9/10.",9,0,0,1 May 2003
