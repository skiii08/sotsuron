Blade Runner 2049," Pointless
","Being a fan of Blade Runner I was bound to be disappointed. What I am disgusted about is that this inferior sequel currently enjoys a higher rating than its prequel. People, come on (please).This film is unwanted, adds only convoluted nonsense and resolves nothing.I am glad I watched it because it was beautiful, the women were pretty and I am a healthy man who appreciates the body of a woman, but otherwise the many reviews here say it all. My telling all these producers and directors to stop with the endless sequels won't sway anyone (in the time it took me to write this Disney released 2 new Marvel films), but guys BR2049 is still disappointing. 4/10 for the women, landscape and it is not as boring as Disney Star Wars.",4,12,23,4 November 2017
