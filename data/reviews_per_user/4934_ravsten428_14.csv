Who Framed Roger Rabbit," Who you calling a chump? You chimp!
","I love Who Framed Roger Rabbit! The characters are well done and even the weasels are funny.Roger Rabbit gets into trouble when he becomes framed for a murder he didn't even commit and on top of that he has also found out that his wife played patty cake with Marvin Acme.Eddie Valiant a private investigator who has done work for helping solve crimes for toons along with his brother who was tragically killed by one, gets more than he bargained for when Roger comes and asks for his help. Along the way they find out that an evil toon killed Acme for profit to take over the red car and destroy toontown to build a mega freeway. And it also turns out that this villain was the one who killed Eddie's brother.Sometimes Roger Rabbit gets a little immature with it's material and shouldn't be viewed by younger children. When they get a older though I would have them sit down to watch this. They will love it.",10,0,0,23 June 2011
Zootopia," Zootopia! An outstanding film!
","What a great film! I have heard so many comments about how this film is trying to send the message of tolerance and forgiveness. There have been many cartoons that have dealt with the very same thing and I'm okay with it. It's much better than seeing a movie filled with potty humor jokes that dumb down our youth.Zootopia is a grand film on so many levels! Judy Hops is a brave young bunny who believes in becoming the first rabbit ever to join the police. Years later her wish comes true but she starts at the bottom as a meter maid. Not too long into her job she meets up with a cunning fox named Nick Wilde and this is where her dream takes flight.Zootopia is a great film for our generation. Intolerance and fear is ugly and it is up to us to fight back against it.My only problem I had with this movie was Judy's parents. Talk about cold and uncaring about their own flesh and blood's future.I really enjoyed the line at the end of the film about how change starts with us. It is so important for kids today to hear this message. They are our future and even us adults can change our society for the better.And for the adults who took their young children to see this... why? It was going to go over their heads. It is rated PG, not G. Looking forward to the DVD release.",10,4,10,23 April 2016
Beauty and the Beast," One of Disney's finest films!
",Beauty and the Beast is a film that doesn't really on the overly cuteness that most of the Disney fans are used to. It also tells a classic fairy tale to the T.Belle is a young smart and independent woman who wants to live an adventurous life. A man named Gaston wants the affection of Belle but she isn't interested in him because he seems more interested in himself than the intentions of her. Here Belle is cast as a very strong female unlike most of the other films that portray the female as nothing more than the typical love lorn princess.One day her father goes out of town. While on his way to where he is going he gets lost in the woods and comes across an enchanted castle that is owned by a prince who is cursed with a spell for his selfish ways and takes the form of an ugly beast. The Beast locks Maurice away in his castle. Belle gets worried after her father hasn't come back and she goes looking for him and finds the castle. While she tries to take her father away the Beast finds her and tells her to leave. Belle tells the Beast to let her father go and in return she will live with him in the castle forever. Belle makes some new friends with the castle staff who are also enchanted under the spell and take the form of utensils and appliances. One of the most popular characters being Mrs. Potts.One day Belle travels to the West Wing which the Beast told her not to visit because it is forbidden although she can visit any other room. While going around the West Wing she finds the rose that holds the spell over the castle and tries to check it out but the Beast finds her and tells her to leave and never come back. Belle leaves and she is surrounded in the woods by wolves. The Beast comes to her rescue and gets hurt in the process. Belle takes him back and takes care of his wound. The Beast starts to have feelings for Belle and thinks that she is the one who will break the spell and eventually he lets her leave because she is concerned for her father. I won't spoil the rest.Beauty and the Beast has catchy songs without being over the top. There are plenty of laughs in the film as well. An enjoyable film that captures your heart and interest from start to finish.The only thing I didn't like in the film was how they portrayed the wolves. I get sick of the evil wolf stereotype. Other than that the movie is classic Disney fare.,9,1,2,27 September 2011
Kung Fu Panda 2," Pantastic!
","This movie was excellent! To me, the second installment of Kung Fu Panda far exceeded my expectations.The animation is spectacular! And while the plot uses the typical good vs. evil story, it works well here.While not as good as the original, Kung Fu Panda 2 offers plenty of action, compassion and laughter.The villain of the movie, a white peacock named Shen is bent on having revenge from being put away for being too greedy when he is young. His parents sent him away for his own good and he ends up becoming resentful. Does this story sound familiar to you Frozen fans? Anyway, I digress.On Po's journey to confront Shen, he finds out more about his life as a baby and what exactly happened to him. A symbol on Shen brings back memories of his childhood. While Po struggles with this he eventually finds his way to inner peace and exactly what happened that day.My favorite new character turned out to be the ram that was Shen's mentor. She was great!A worthy sequel that will be coming home to my DVD player.",10,1,2,6 February 2016
How to Train Your Dragon 2," Dragon droppings.
","Gone is the heart and soul the first film had. We now have a story that is poorly contrived.How to Train Your Dragon 2 follows the adventures of Hiccup. We now learn that dragons and humans live together in harmony. They compete in some sort of tournament every year which involves racing and other events. This movie never gains momentum at all.Long story short, While out venturing with his girlfriend, they end up in uncharted territory with a bunch of bad guys who are led by a villain named Drago. Drago wants to use dragons to his advantage to start war with the others.So basically the theme of change is rehashed in this sequel. Hiccup believes that he can speak with the leader of this group and change his evil ways. His father warns him that Drago can not be reasoned with. Hiccup defies this and goes out to try and stop war from ensuing.Along the way he encounters someone. We come to find out that this is his mother. She has been in hiding for 20 years. We find out later why this is, but the story just seems too silly a reason for her to leave her family. Even the reunion with the husband seems awkward. I would have wanted to know why she left not just run up and kiss her.One of the characters dies, I won't say who and I was already warned before I saw it. No it's not Toothless.Why did DreamWorks feel it was necessary to try and use the change theme again? Certainly some people can change, and others can't be persuaded. But change is not something that comes quickly, it is something that takes time.The saving grace of the movie is the animation and that's pretty much it. Skip this dud and watch the original.",2,4,9,24 February 2016
Big Hero 6," Wonderful film for anyone!
","Absolutely wonderful film from the Disney studios! I can't say enough great things about this movie. Heartwarming! Stunning! Incredible! AWESOME! This was one of the best movies I have seen in years.This movie had some of the best character development I've seen. All the characters got along very well and helped Hiro when he needed it. I guess if I only had one complaint though, it is that poor Fred came across as a big weirdo to his friends. He invites them over to his place at one point for a hideout. They are very apprehensive to enter first wondering what is on the other side. Once they find out he lives in the lap of luxury everything is fine. I often wonder how they would have treated him if he was poor. One of the friends says, 'I thought you lived under a bridge.' Okay, so maybe that was my only complaint of the film.We even get to experience heartache with 2 deaths in the film. This movie had me laughing, smiling and crying the whole time. I was intrigued from the very beginning and did not lose interest. When I am able I am going to buy this movie on DVD. This was fantastic! If you haven't seen this film yet, please do! You may just enjoy it. I was surprised to hear that my nephew who watched it didn't like it. He's only 15! I'm 36. To each his own.",10,1,2,20 June 2016
Brave," Disney/ Pixar does it again.
","I really was excited to see this film. Just saw it today and wow what a treat! The folks at Disney/Pixar always seem to top themselves every time they do another story and this one is excellent.This movie had my heart racing several times and also I cried, yes I admit I'm a softy. I also however thought that at times while the movie was great that it had some stories intertwined in it. Brother Bear and Beauty and the Beast I was thinking because Medora's mother gets changed into a bear although this time it was a whole different reason and also the spell being broken at the end by the words 'I love you' from Beauty and the Beast.The only thing I would say that was bad about the movie was the dirtiness of it. We see butts and even get a sexual suggestion right at the beginning of the movie. It is also very intense for a younger viewer and I would not suggest it for kids under 12. However my rating still remains the same.An instant Disney/Pixar classic.",10,6,12,26 July 2012
Up," Up, a fantastic film!
",Wonderful film from the Disney/Pixar studio! Carl Fredrickson played by curmudgeon Ed Asner grows up with his wife Ellie both of whom plan on making it one day to Paradise Falls. Unfortunately Ellie becomes ill and passes away and they can't fulfill their dream.Enter Russell the scout who asks Carl in aiding him for an assisting the elderly badge. Carl tries to shoo Russell away but to no avail. Russell stows away Carl's house which Carl decides to tie up many balloons to escape his house from being excavated. While Carl is in the air he hears a knock on his door; Uh Oh!After Carl finds Russell he tries to find a way to get him back home we are then treated to a wonderful adventure that includes a very colorful bird named Kevin (By Russell) who turns out to be female and has babies. Also along comes Dug the energetic dog who is astray from his pack of other dogs who speak by using collars that Charles Muntz the villain made for them to communicate.An action packed rest of the film awaits.I would recommend this film for anyone who loves a good adventure and a movie that will make them laugh and smile and also for anybody who has kids.9/10,9,0,0,5 May 2011
The Lion King," Not bad but highly overrated.
","The Lion King gets much praise. Of course one can see why. The movie has great animation. Most of the characters are put together well and of course it has memorable music. Two of the songs were big hits in the 90's.So before I get on TLK's faults I will start with the good. The Lion King has great animation. It was Disney's best animation to date and most 2D movies never came close to surpassing TLK style animation. Now for the characters. I love Timon and Pumbaa. These two were great comedy relief for this film. I loved Mufasa and I hate that he had to die, but I realize that it was an important part of the film, involving the theme of Shakespeare's Hamlet. Rafiki is also quite funny. And those loathsome but lovable hyenas. The only characters I don't like are the main ones. Simba is annoying as a cub and even more as an adult. He's so stubborn as an adult that he has to have sense knocked into him about his past, instead of just finding out his destiny for himself. And the villain Scar, comes off as too weak.I guess my biggest problem with TLK is that, it is simply overrated. All the merchandise that was pumped out for this movie and its sequels was massive. I don't think Frozen could come close to the explosion of Lion King toys.On a whole TLK is not a horrible movie, I just don't think it is Disney's best. Most people do and that's fine. I think Beauty and The Beast is better than TLK. But don't take my word for it if you feel differently.",5,0,2,4 February 2016
WALL·E," There's always hope!
",WALL.E is perhaps one of the better Disney films to have come out in a long time.WALL.E is a robot who is on earth to help clean it up. Earth has become overridden by garbage and WALL.E is there to help Earth to be restored.WALL.E is all alone but he also has a cockroach to keep him company but something seems to be missing. Soon enough a ship comes to earth to see if there is still life on earth. A robot named Eva comes out to search and she runs into WALL.E. WALL.E takes an immediate liking to her and somehow their paths cross onto the ship that is supposed to come back someday to Earth when it's considered safe to do so.At some point the captain of the ship learns that Eva has brought back a plant and he knows that they can go back to Earth. The captain wants to go back and unfortunately his Auto Manual doesn't want him to and tries to sabotage him. Eventually the captain learns how to shut down the Auto Manual machine and they go back. Eventually at the end WALL.E and Eva find love. Sweet robot love.,10,1,2,4 August 2011
Rango," Good movie that's different, some flaws.
","I saw this movie about a month and a half ago and it was definitely interesting.I had heard reviews that were mostly positive about the film and was worth watching.Rango starts out rather amusingly. We have a chameleon who thinks he's an actor and lives in his tiny glass cage. While rehearsing with his half bodied actress and his wind up fish (Forgot the names of his cast) he's thrust out of the back of a car window while his owners avoid a car wreck.Rango is now in no-man's land and must escape from a Hawk who wants him FOR A MEAL! Tons of action awaits the viewer.Rango is a great film and it touches on things that most people who don't think for themselves it would go right over their heads. This film touches on things such as progression, theology, and even suicide. And also if you watch this movie close enough you'll figure out that the armadillo is representing God.The only drawbacks to this film is it has a lot of swearing such as Hell and Damn and not appropriate for very young children. Also Rango went on a little to long but was still worthwhile.I am looking forward the DVD release.8/10",8,0,1,5 May 2011
Ice Age: Dawn of the Dinosaurs," Peaches!
",Ice Age Dawn of the Dinosaurs is not nearly as good as the original in the series but a lot better then The Meltdown.In this part of the series Manny and Ellie are expecting their first child. Diego is losing his ability prey on animals and is getting older and he decides that he wants to leave the herd but he doesn't. Also we see the soft side of Sid (of course he always has been soft) as he fosters three dinosaur eggs he encounters. Later on we discover he has been taking care of babies that belong to a sort of ferocious T-Rex.Perhaps the best parts of Dawn of the Dinosaurs is the new and vibrant character Bucky. A weasel looking animal he takes them through a land of new creatures that the clan have never seen before. They are walking through a plethora of dinosaurs that rule this land unlike their own. They eventually will find Sid who has become lost.Bucky is hilarious as the nutty weasel he is. His jokes are funny. But some of them may be a little too adult like in humor to the point where it's downright filthy. But on a whole he is a great addition to the Ice Age series. Another funny part of the film follows our favorite prehistoric squirrel Scratt who while chasing his beloved acorn comes across a gorgeous female squirrel who tries to take his acorn away. The humor between these two comes down to the wire where they will end up falling in love. Has Scratt lost his mind giving up his prized acorn over a girl? Just watch and see.I am also looking forward to Continental Drift.,7,1,1,6 March 2012
Star Wars: Episode VII - The Force Awakens," Every Star Wars film gets worse each time.
","I went to see this with a friend of mine who really loves SW. He seemed to really enjoy it but I didn't.I want to say this much. I never was a big SW fan. I remember sleeping on Star Wars sheets as a youngster but not being overly wrought with joy from looking at them. I have yet to see A New Hope and Return of the Jedi. Yes, pathetic I know. And I think I am one of the rare ones out there who loved The Phantom Menace which I saw before any of the others.In a nutshell, I hated Attack Of The Clones other than Yoda's awesome light saber duel. Revenge of the Sith was way too violent and this one is more like The Force Died.This one was a slap in the face. Why does Disney have to take over every franchise known to man? I'm sure Walt is spinning in his grave over this. Disney has now ruined the Star Wars franchise for good! I'm not going to much into detail about the film because there really isn't any need to. The only spoiler I'm giving out is Solo's death! I had a feeling they were going to do something like this and my gut feeling was dead on. I felt a part of me die inside. Did they really have to kill off a major contributor to the film? If they happen to bring him back I would laugh. Disney is a joke anymore.",2,15,21,13 April 2016
Minions," Could have been more planned out.
","The Minions movie is somewhat humorous, but that's about it.Being a fan of the first two films I had high expectations for this one. I am a big fan of the minions and thought this would be a refreshing treat. I don't go to watch movies in theaters much, so I decided to watch it on YouTube before it was taken down.Long story short, our lovable minions are looking for an evil leader to tag along with. After several mishaps with apparent baddies, our minions seem to lose hope. One of the minions decides to travel the world looking for a leader to call their own. Three of them Bob, Stuart and Kevin go around the world looking for a villain. Along the way they will find one. She tries to get them to steal Queen Elizabeth's crown. So the minions set off to follow through with her evil plan.What I didn't like about the movie is that there is too much dirty humor involved. Since when do we have to be dirty to be entertained? It may fly over kids heads but most kids are smart and they will understand it soon enough if they already don't. The film also has too many pop culture references. Okay I got most of them and liked most of them as well but just too much for one movie in my opinion. I can imagine how much royalties are being paid out to the artists. Also the characters lacked development and most were unfunny and boring. Personally my favorite parts of the film were when; the minions hypnotize the guards and have them singing the song 'Hair'. And when Gru showed up at the end of the film. So basically my advice is, be ready for a movie that does not hold the charm of the first two. It's not a total bust but I expected more. It seems that most sequels are made for profit only and are light on plot. By the way for those of you who don't know, Ice Age 5 is supposed to be due in theaters next year.Side note: The Moon Landing scene was extremely offensive!",5,3,7,13 July 2015
