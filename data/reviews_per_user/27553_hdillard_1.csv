The Ring," not the best thriller ever, but highly effective
","'The Ring' has something going for it that most thrillers today do not. It's interesting.  Never mind what people say about it not making sense, because it makes pretty good sense if you pay attention to the movie.  I'm not saying that 'the ring' doesn't have it's flaws, but if you're looking for the next 'exorcist', stay home and wait. But if you're like me, and just looking for a thriller that actually thrills, and isn't carbon copy of modern-day crappy excuses for thrillers, check out 'the ring' it'll leave you entertained and talking about it for plenty of time after you leave the theater.  Naomi watts, fresh off a great performance in last year's surprisingly intriguing 'mulholland drive', has to down-play this character a bit, but she still delivers a strong performance that carries the audience through this movie.",8,0,0,23 October 2002
