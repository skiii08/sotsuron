3:10 to Yuma," Save yourself time and money
","Save yourself time and money and see the original, it's much better and much more believable. From the saloon scene with Wade and the barmaid to it's ending this version is a very pale comparison at best to the original.Even in black and white the cinematography is much better in the original and the characters of the original are so much more real and memorable than any in this very poor remake. Basically this version seems to follow the example of the present horror movie genre where you see if you can top each killing with a more horrific and bloody method than the last murder scene.",1,12,22,18 February 2008
