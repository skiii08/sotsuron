National Treasure: Book of Secrets," This Film Should Not Typecast English or Confederates as Bad
","I really hated this movie the original was OK it doesn't bother me as much but in this movie they banter the English again, this time with Queen Victoria implemented in helping the south. Do Americans always hate English I pretty sure the confederates did very well and had better tactics and generals including stonewall jackson to let alone win the war on their own. Not every confederate could even afford a slave let alone shoes they just wanted to create their own country. And whats hypocrisy is that the union under sherman led a campaign to wipe out native Americans so who's really fighting for freedom. The confederates deeply hated the north union because they destroyed their homes and done atrocities. But no they don't mention that.Also Ed Harris 'say that I found it!' that quote made me laugh because he tried to kill them the whole time, sure you would give him credibility. I couldn't believe nicolas cage's character went through with it. It was a stupid movie with a silly ending.",1,1,1,2 July 2010
Sucker Punch," Leaves you answering more questions to the end
","This movie has some good action scenes, girls and cgi but the story is not straight forward so the audience cant understand what is what and its because of loopholes.By that you cant tell what is the main story from the dream story that is made up from Baby Doll's head (main character) or its from the lobotomy (before or after), split personality disorder, envisions of how things turn out, is it one person or different perspectives from characters or go with the flow type movie.Usually there is an indication if there dreaming, like a totem, they feel pain or a trigger switch to wake up there was none of that. There was only the chef with a missing knife, the charred fire on the wall and a few other things that happened. You cant tell after the caretakers say stuff that only Baby Doll herself would know. It leaves you answering one question after another. I can only recommend that you just watch the action scenes everything else wont make a difference. I wish it was one sided and people wouldn't have to make there own conclusions.",4,2,8,21 April 2011
Inglourious Basterds," Clear and Simple
","My brother recommended this movie for me don't know why. It could of gone a good movie but its a major failed. It doesn't show them fighting Germans at all or doing guerrilla or apache tactics. I expected it to be suspenseful and action but sadly no.I agree with the other comments about this movie it's really lame. Interesting dialogue from the jew hunter but fail in character plot and the German troops. What happen to the other inglorious basterds their gone missing and why is there only two guards protecting Hitler, I expected a climax at the end. I don't see a lot of German troops at all only about 5 in the bar and only 2 at the cinema what the?Here's a good movie have lots of German personnel and tanks, more action more suspense and make them cunning, well trained and battle hardened. Have french resistance, SAS commandos and the inglorious basterds. Put them all together you could of made a hell of movie just like Wolfenstein or Hidden and Dangerous. It was a good idea but failed to be put into action because of you Quintin Tarantino",1,28,49,19 January 2010
The Hunger Games," Over-hyped Movie Adaptation
","If you've already seen movies like Predator, Running Man, Gamer, The Condemned, Gladiator/Spartacus shows, Deadman Wonderland etc about people pitted against each other for survival and only one can be the victor you got an idea what the movie Hunger Games is about. But not as good as I thought this movie would be with the hype.I was skeptical because I felt originality was amiss and I don't want to watch a group of teens thrown in a melting pot with gore action. Which I heard Battle Royale was like. If this movie taught me anything is that authors like to throw in a Teenage-Romance in the midst of fighting for love to increase sales on books and movie adaptations. I went to watch this movie with an open mind an hr later it felt like watching the grammys with talk show hosts and fashion statements, another hour later footage of romance themes and cutshots/glimpses of action. Lots of plot holes, weak character development and weak story to begin with and to end with. Worse it's a trilogy it felt like Twilight.What's weird was that the contestants didn't look hungry in the movie like they were starving for food in order to survive or cannibalize. It doesn't fit the description of the movie. I would recommend not to watch this movie, if anything it deterred me from reading any of the books if there all going to be the same.",2,22,38,27 March 2012
12 Monkeys," Straight forward movie
","Before I saw this movie I thought it would be great I'm interested in sci-fi or back to the future etc. The problem is the movie is predictable and it was obvious that everything Bruce Will's character(James Cole) did no matter how he change it, would remain the same. From beginning to the end, virus is released no matter what happens.The movie was too B-grade characters ordinary, music dull, dialogue is very average nothing interesting. They don't cover philosophy, science, physics, consequences or technical terms so the movie is very dull. I would recommend Deja Vu or Paycheck both good movies with better story and characters. IMDb has overrated this movie like Seven and I think its because of Brad Pitt or people just like straightforward plots if you like that then watch this movie.",4,0,7,4 March 2012
The Adventures of Tintin," Poorest Storytelling for Audiences
","After I finished watching this movie I still couldn't understand what was the story? Visually I can see it but it was empty its like they spent so much time to make it visually appeasing that they didn't bother putting a story in at all.In this movie everyone is carrying a MP40 as if it was widely available, motorbike with side carriage chase scene was identical to H.Ford and S.Connery and that tank just came out of nowhere, with an arch ontop of it? Captain Haddock became a drunk scott, they used too many puns in one sentence at times, felt like he was a liability instead of a helping hand, wont mention too much about the plane scene 'physics' burp for fuel?, crane wars? what were they thinking. Even the pirate scene didn't help there was more to it than just that. All the characters were better portrayed in the cartoon than the movie they don't have them all like the professor. I remember the twins Thomson and Thompson kept changing their disguises, Haddock had hiccups (*hic*) when he was drinking, snowy was more adorable had thought bubbles on dogbones or what would happen to him or trying to explain to tintin what he was saying. Tintin was not much of a sleuth in this movie everything just happened to fall into his lap, originally I'm sure he sometimes said 'lets search for clues' and he pulls out a magnifying glass and starts elaborating on his findings etc and each clue would lead to another, which was better told in the comics than the movie.Its so bad you could fall asleep, the only thing good was the introduction with the paintings reminiscent of Tintin and in one scene tintin had just one bullet to take down an airplane that was so funny in a corny way.",4,9,18,26 December 2011
Watchmen," Worst movie ever
","This is not a movie it's the same thing as LOST I went and sat there for three hours through this boring movie with a final disappointment at the end. I liked the action no doubt about that but flashback after flasback *yawn the only good things that kept me in my seat was watching hawkman and the missus in yellow and definitely watching Rohrschach a fantastic actor and character kept the whole movie from collapsing despite all that bs about the other hero being a rapist, smart guy being a villain and getting away with it which is utterly incomprehensible and blue genie with pp hanging out who has some serious social issues.I can forget all that terrible stuff despite that they killed Rohrschachh off at the end. Talk about a big let down what was the whole point then. I mean you sat through the whole movie for over 3hrs of talking and constant flashbacks which made you stay in your seat because of Rohrschachh and the villains get away with it and new york being wiped out. This is a total waste of my time I don't know why you gave this movie so much credit its something that the director would do on purpose just to get a laugh at how we are suckers for watching this movie just to scrw us in the end.",1,3,8,11 September 2009
The Matrix Revolutions," Worst finale ever
","I'll keep it short awesome action and to all the directors of film-making don't ever kill off the main characters in a last trilogy that's what infuriates ppl. You can do it in the 1st and second movies but don't ever kill off the main characters in the last installment. Big disappointment there, what was the whole reason then for Neo for surving the first movie and then Trinity surviving the second and only to kill them off in the end. What was incredibly dumb was how he killed Agent Smith he used the same attack in the first movie which supposed to kill him and worked why that bothers me? Don't use the same thing twice its like watching a repeat nobody likes repeats in trilogies. I still enjoyed it if they happen to resurrect neo and trinity in a fourth installment I'll take back what I said otherwise you just be watching X-Men 3 and yeh they killed off the main characters too.",1,1,4,11 September 2009
Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows: Part 1," Not wise to have 2 parts for Last Installment of Harry Potter
","I had to make this review because its really frustrating of how drawn out Harry Potter is. If anyone saw Harry Potter and The Half-Blood Prince we know that movie was way too long and they just cut out the most crucial parts of a story. Now if they wanted to do that then why split two parts for the last movie when you could of left it to just one or add in some parts you missed out from the Half-Blood Prince to clarify things. It's all about milking money from the franchise.So if you watch this movie its more of a romance between Ron and Hermione, lots of camping, forests and lots of dialogue saying 'who'd, what and where'. The ending is pathetic with Dobby the house elf dead. For a movie that's only based on a few pages and not even half way through, how many years do we have to wait when it's finished because its getting frustrating.",1,1,4,17 December 2010
Scott Pilgrim vs. the World," One of the Worst Comic Adaptations I've Ever Seen
","I already read the first comic it wasn't that good til it got to the ending with the action. The same I would expect from this movie which can't be helped since they have to stay true to the comic. The comic and the movie can be placed under one genre juvenile which is not a bad thing but if not executed properly than it's going to be ridiculous.This movie was not funny and it was too boring, not because of the dialogue and the characters but because the actors could'nt get into character. Who here has ever seen Michael Cera smile or at least act happy and rejoiceful, none from what I seen and because of that it has a domino effect on the other actors and they have to be the same boring, lame people. Most people would say it's not suppose to be serious well that's why I hate it because it felt too serious throughout the whole movie and the dialogue was suppose to be funny but the way they say it with a grim face then it's not. Why do they all look depressing? If you're going to see this movie fast forward to all the action bits otherwise you will be bored with all the talking. The comics are meant to be funny so don't bother listening to what the actors got to say.",1,9,19,10 December 2010
Unknown," Don't Judge a Movie by its Actors
","First off when I found out the movie had Liam Neeson I thought it would guarantee some action and have suspenseful story like Bourne or Taken. Well just like a book I judged by the cover, the rating in IMDb and the synopsis I thought this is so cool the character is going to beat some people looking for answers to find out who he is along the way, was I mistakenly mislead.First off Liam Neeson aka 'Who Am I' loses memory bumps his head against the taxi window because of a colliding refrigerator (I know sounds silly), reclaims his memory with the help of a taxi driver who just had to be a stereotypical bad female driver who drives over the bridge into the river instead of just stopping the car. Liam Neeson finds out that he was suppose to kill a scientist who can bring world hunger to an end but how does he do it he plants a bomb to wipe out the whole building and make it collateral damage just to kill this one guy who has no protection. There wouldn't be a story if he just shot the scientist and let that be the end of it, but no it has to be elaborate because..well there is no reason the movie is just bad to begin with. Anyway when he regains his memory he doesn't go through with it.In short the script would of lasted few mins but was stretched out to go for over an hour. There's not much to say because its poorly made, the dialogue is bad, story unintelligent, 5 villains are not that threatening and died straight away without uttering a last word or what their intentions were. If you see this movie its like a sparkler when it fizzles out you say 'that's it?' and you're left disappointed.",2,2,3,27 January 2012
The Great Raid," Good for a B-Grade Movie
","This was a good movie to watch I recommend it if you know what the story is about or even read books about it, I knew they weren't going to go into every single detail of what happened because it would be too much to put in the movie. Although it won't be close to the real thing with gore, brutality and historical accuracy you have to consider the movie went for over two hours and was made on a budget you should know this beforehand when you watch the movie don't expect it to be like Band of Brothers or Saving Private Ryan.Don't be discouraged by critics if they say its boring, in my opinion it was the opposite and the film was engaging all the way through dialogue and action with a steady pace. I don't expect the acting or portrayal to be Oscar winning but it wasn't so contrived as having an American teaching filipinos of 'this is how it's done' with an American flag flying in the background in the end. So not for propaganda use. They didn't ignore the filipino support in the daring raid and at least showed some acknowledgement to all the war heroes, even at the end of the movie with a dedication.Even if the movie flopped in the box office nobody watches war movies but it's there if people have a pique interest and its better than most B-Grade movies put out today. If you liked or disliked the Pacific Series you should watch The Great Raid afterwards.",7,1,1,21 March 2012
The Bridge on the River Kwai," worst war classic movie ever
","Just awful if I would say everything not because of the atrocities I mean the whole movie is really, really bad. I cant even understand why there is so many comments say this was a good movie and surprised they gave this movie a lot of awards.I like classics but this is one of the worst war movies I've ever seen because of the historical inaccuracy and it didn't even come close to the real thing. Despite all that the movie itself was filmed poorly, plot was terribly bad and the ending made you say 'what the?' it's still in my mind today I'm confused if you seen the movie you know what I mean. The characters and actors that were playing them were just 'fake' I didn't feel like they were real or admirable it's like they didn't get into character or kept looking at the camera. Also the movie is anti-British because of the portrayal of the British officer who is going along and helping the Japanese and guess who is the hero? yep American how typical always trying to play the hero and make the English look bad.",1,11,29,11 September 2009
The Dark Knight Rises," So many plot holes, loses its edge of darkness and mystery
","First things first there is no Riddler, that ruin my expectation to begin with from gossip news. The movie could of be done without Catwoman didn't add anything to the story except being as a cameo and used up precious time which could of been used on something else.Its like when someone has so many ideas, they want it all in the movie instead its a mess and they forget to summarise. The end result is too many plot holes. e.g. thousands of police go underground and get trapped and have to get out and fight their way above ground in human wave formation against guns blazing? Trying to get kids across bridge with school bus? willing human sacrificial pieces? etc etc just so many irrelevant ideas. Why wait for a few months until winter arrives, why stick around when the bomb goes off and all of a sudden Bruce Wayne travels across the planet to Gotham in time with a teleporter?Biggest problem is not enough character development or background details, for example Bane. There was an opportunity to explain why? At least it was explained with the Joker. Stop trying to show all perspectives from all non-main characters like extras. Just focus on the villain, hero and subcharacters thats it. Not on the army, reporters, stockbrokers, children, president of the united states or some well in the desert.. oh sorry jail pit with a rope to climbed.I like the mystery about batman's identity but its ruined when just about everyone close to contact with Bruce Wayne knows his Batman (facepalm). I enjoyed the brief fight between Batman and Bane but I wished it ended with Batman making a comeback from his spinal injury and defeating Bane. Instead Catwoman had to interfere by shooting off the batmobile. Poor Alfred was not even around when batman got snapped, he cant even stopped by and say 'how you doing, master Bruce?' Bruce:'Nothing particular Alfred just got my ass whooped where were you?'This movie doesn't resemble batman from its predecessors its lost its batman theme of staying hidden in the shadows and in the end of the action scenes it was like watching michael bay's decepticon wingfighter (it was bat hover flying vehicle). If the title is The Dark Knight Rises what is the epitome, Nightwing? If you want to see it that badly see it on DVD otherwise don't see it at all.An unsatisfying end to a trilogy 'Cafe' and water platform? Just show me the Batman basking in his coolness (dark theme music playing).",3,2,8,28 July 2012
Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice," Straight to DVD comic book hero movie
","To save some time the trailer is pretty much the whole movie I'm not kidding, so I saw this movie with low expectations. By the end of the movie I was very disappointed. It was not that great it was mediocre it should of been released straight to DVD. This is the reason why.They crammed about 3-5 subplots into this movie it was like watching a poorly edited film of snippets or deleted scenes put together to make a fan film hoping in desperation that it would work out as it plays along. Adding in dream sequences some good and some unnecessary that feel like Snyder or the writers wanted to throw all their ideas all at once. This is the problem some of this can be saved in future films I don't understand why they had to catch up with Marvel stop it DC take your time. The film suffers from story, structure, plot, pacing and character development.Most of the actors were fine, unfortunately they miscasted Luthor played by Jesse Eisenberg and he ruined the whole movie he was playing himself and sounded like a brat who had no ulterior motives, like a poor version of the joker.The cameos of the justice league shown on a computer screen felt out of place. There is only two fight scenes with Batman and Superman one is on the roof and one is helping to fight against Doomsday which is the worst looking CGI. These fight scenes were brief. Wonder Women was meh, just thrown in as a cameo I would of love to see her origins first but DC is doing this all backwards.The only good thing in this movie is Batman I am surprised that Ben Affleck did a better version in its own right, although there is a lot of irrationality of the character almost like a bully. There was not enough of Superman dialogue. The Superman franchise will greatly suffer because of DC (no spoilers), they made Lois look like a damsel in distress and her side quest in Africa was stupid. They were trying so hard to make this movie serious, but it stopped being serious to me after the Grandma's Peach Jar scene.Your better off saving your money and watch a different upcoming superhero movie.",4,3,7,1 April 2016
Toy Story 3," It's Almost perfect in every way except..
","I liked this whole movie throughout just about when buzz gets his companion Jesse, so what about Woody why no Bo Beep or at least have a new female companion its like watching the jocks get the girls and the friend sits on the sideline and gets nothing that's what made me sad. It's like the opposite of the Revenge of the Nerds.I know most people were disappointed by this but I still liked it, it's not as good as Toy Story 1 and 2 because sometimes things are best left on there own I don't want to see several years later that Andy gets older and his dog probably has heartworms and probably dies in the next few months along with Andy's childhood.At least it won't diminish the time we liked the prequels and how we liked Andy when he was young and the toys weren't thrown away or replaced with video games, unfortunately they were all given away or sold off to the garage sale in this movie but that's how it is.",7,0,1,26 October 2010
