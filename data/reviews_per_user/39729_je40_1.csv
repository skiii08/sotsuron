Blade Runner 2049," Needs an editor
","This film was good, not great. I consider the original a classic and watched it again 2 days before seeing 2049. While the original has some hokey dialog, and some plot-points don't hold up, all-in-all, a great film again. 2049 badly needed an editor. Many scenes drug on and on. A scene of searching through a building felt like it took place in real time. other scenes added zero to the film, other than someone said 'That'd be a cool visual.' Jared Leto's dialog seemed incomprehensible. Some better writing, tighter pacing, an editor allowed to cut, and you'd have had a much better end-product,",Null,7,15,10 October 2017
