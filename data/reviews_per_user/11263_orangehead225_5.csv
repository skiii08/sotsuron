Casablanca," Casablanca
","So this movie took me a while to get into and kind of figure out. Some of the things I noticed in this movie was that the more important characters were not a shinny I say that meaning feel they took better care of the main actors they looked better. Everyone else had shiny face like they forgot to put make-up on them. the lighting seemed to be coming from every where which I liked it gave it a really cool comfortable feel and the shadows made feel like it had more depth to it. Over all I like this movie not really my favorite and I don;t want to ruin the ending, but not what I expected. Good love story over all. Megan",6,0,4,21 October 2009
Dr. Strangelove or: How I Learned to Stop Worrying and Love the Bomb," Dr. Strangelove
",Didn't really fine this movie that interesting. Some of the things I noticed were that in the beginning of the movie the writing of peoples names or introductions were actually written. The one thing I did like was the camera shots upward of the crazy general Jack Ripper. The shots after that scene seem to be fake it didn't look like the planes were really flying. The pictures of the people in the plane were really dark. all the air force people were men.There was only one women in the whole movie and she was shown to us in her underwear. I did like the back ground music while they were reading there top secret letters they played the drums I liked that gave it a real scary feeling. I believe the message in the movie to be anti- nuclear war. Even tough I not a war person it was an OK movie. Megan Himmel,5,1,8,6 December 2009
The Grapes of Wrath," The grapes of wrath
","OK so this was kind of a long movie. It was sad. Some of the things I noticed in this movie were, how they kind of flashed backwards which is something I haven't seen in one of our movies. I liked the shot with the 3 shadows of the men standing there after they were told to get off there land. I thought that was a nice and different camera move. Some other things I saw during this movie is when they lit the candle in the house to see if anyone was there there was still a back light. where was that coming from? another thing was the sound. When the wind storm was rolling in it was extremely loud and if you looked around not everything was moving from these terrible winds. another thing was I liked the fact that they used a montage effect of all the signs when they were traveling from Oklahoma to California. The last thing i notice is when the family reached the Colorado river and they all got out to look at the beautiful sight, there voiced sounded as if there were on a set and not in an open area. over all I did like the movie but it was sad Megan",7,1,2,21 October 2009
The Graduate," the graduate
","the graduate was an odd movie. Finally a color movie. some of the things I noticed throughout the movie the music slowed down during the car scene, like when the car went through the tunnel. There were lots of long takes some of the long takes i thought were a good idea but some I feel made the movie slow down and made it kind of boring. the pool scene when he jumped in his scuba suit was kind of cool because they shut out all the sound which was a cool feature but when he was in the house he could here his father talking? this was strange.the sex scene was a little strange as well the woman started taking her close off and there were extremely quick flashes of nudity. when he started sleeping with her the lights would go out and you could still tell what was going on I liked that and thought it was a good idea for the movie.Each scene led itself into another which I liked. Think that he seemed very unknowing during the movie guess which is what it was all about.The las thing I nocticed was the running of cars didn't really sound normal to me they seemed to loud and really overbearing during the movie. The last thing I liked was the camera view through the glass table, I thought it was a really cool effect. Megan Himmel",7,0,2,16 December 2009
Psycho," Holy Psycho
",I really thought this movie was done well. The ending a surprise. Loved it. In the beginning I wasn't sure how this movie was going to be any kind of thriller or horror. I thought in the beginning the lighting was a lot better than in the end. Towards the end everything was so dark.I believe that to go along with the story the lighting fit in perfectly. I also noticed the music in the background they did an amazing job with that it was just in the right places even if there wasn't something bad going to happen you thought there was going to be. I think the plot was great and it kept you guessing. I guess this is why Hitchcock was so famous. Megan,8,0,0,16 November 2009
