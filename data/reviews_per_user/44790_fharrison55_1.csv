The King's Speech," A must see movie
","I saw this movie in the middle of a French audience. They watched the original version with french subtitles. We were all rapt in the storyline, the actors, the script and the historical context. We laughed in all the right places, were spellbound by the 'Royal' touches, appreciated the personal drama. Excellent cast and dignified approach though my opinion of Edward V11 is now even lower and I'm not sure if that was a fair portrayal of him or not.Nicely uplifting. I ended up having a tear in my eye by the end, not so much because of the personal struggle portrayed but because it all happened at such a pivotal time in history ie there they were waving to the commoners from Buckingham Palace in those iconic poses. The issue of war brewing was chillingly portrayed.",9,4,8,12 February 2011
