Kill Bill: Vol. 2," A Worthy Sequel
",Kill Bill vol. 2 picks up right where the firsted one lefted off. It is good but it lacks style that the firsted one had. It has a good range of characters but doesn't use them well. I am a big action fan and was a bit disappointed because it didn't have as much action as the first and most of the movie was just talk. Don't get me wrong this is a great movie the talking explained a lot of the story that the first one didn't. This is good because the first kill bill just gets into the action straight away and doesn't really explain the story too well. Overall kill bill vol. 2 finish well and is highly recommend! Kill Bill vol. 1 and 2 should not be missed and they should defiantly be classics.,Null,0,1,10 December 2004
Captain America: The Winter Soldier," Captain America The Winter Soldier Film Review
","Captain America The Winter Soldier is a thrilling throwback to 1970s spy thrillers and an excellent action adventure. Sprinkled with humour it does what every good sequel should do, surpass the first in every way possible. Twists and turns are aplenty and the 2 hour and 16 minute runtime moves at a swift pace and the viewer is never bored as there is such variety.The film deals with the titular hero Captain America aka; Steve Rogers (Chris Evans), attempt at adapting to modern times. This notion was severely lacking in The Avengers and cut to help with the pacing of the movie. An emotional scene that was supposed to be in The Avengers, was when Steve Rogers met Peggy Carter (Hayley Atwell), after not seeing her for years. It evoked a sense of sadness as she was the last link to his past. Sam Wilson (Anthony Mackie) 'Falcon' is introduced and becomes Captain America's sidekick in the vein of Batman's, Robin. Captain America's mistrust of both Nick Fury (Samuel L. Jackson), Black Widow (Scarlett Johansson) and the organization Shield in general are another big focus in the movie.The film does an excellent job at fleshing out the characters, particularly Steve Rogers, Black Widow and Nick Fury, and in doing so makes the viewer care about them in ways not seen before in any of the previous films. This is especially the case with the Black Widow, who we see more of and Nick Fury who tells about his grandfather who operated a elevator. The main villain of the movie alluded to in the movie title is The Winter Soldier (Sebastian Stan), who is one of the best villains in a Marvel movie, so much so that he could become a fan favourite, like Loki. The Winter Soldier is menacing, intimidating and an unstoppable force. He has an air about him similar to the Terminator and the fact that he can go toe to toe with Captain America and be a major threat to him throughout the whole movie, is something special compared to other villains in movies, who are all talk but can't back it up.The fight choreography and action sequences were some of, if not the best, I've seen to date. The first battle between Captain America and The Winter Soldier on the highway is a clear highlight of the movie. The Winter Soldier gives Captain America a run for his money and was able to take on Captain America, Black Widow and Falcon at the same time without breaking a sweat. The same could be said for the CGI and effects which were stunning.There was not much hype for Captain American - The Winter Soldier, yet ironically it is the best Marvel Studios film released, far surpassing The Avengers, which will surprise people who haven't seen this film. I highly recommend this movie. Although you can watch it without seeing the first Captain America â€“ The First Avenger, or The Avengers for full appreciation of the series I recommend that you view these first as you will get so much more out of the movie. Make sure to stay until the end of the movie, as there are two post credit scenes, one of which helps lead into The Avengers 2.",9,7,13,9 April 2014
Kill Bill: Vol. 1," The Best Movie By Quentin Tarantino So Far....
","By the director of Reservoir Dogs, Pulp Fiction and Jackie Brown comes Kill Bill vol. 1. I am not a big Quentin Tarantino but after seeing Kill Bill vol. 1 I think he is a pretty good director. After watching both the Kill Bills I thought immediately that they were classics and they should be. Kill Bill vol. 1 is a non-stop action romp which would definitely please the hardcore action fans. If the story dosen't suck you in the action sure will.The music is superb as well. It has a great cast: Uma Thurman, Lucy Lui, Michael Madsen and David Carradine just to name a few. It isn't just the cast that made the movie great it was their acting which was the cherry on the cake! Kill Bill vol. 1 is not for the faint hearted but is highly recommended.",10,1,2,5 December 2004
Scream," I Guess I Forgot To SCREAM.
","At first when I saw scream ( when I was younger) I thought it was kinda scary but now it is lame. The story, it has no story it is just about a group of teens who are getting murdered by a guy in a stupid costume. The Music, it wasn't that good but it was OK with speakers. The Special Effects It didn't have any or if it did there weren't many and they weren't that good. And a thing I hate and most horror movies have is the Killer never dies the first or disappears specially the 3rd one the killer gets shot about 5 times and then you find out he was wearing bullet proof vest. The sequels are just as bad the 2nd one is about the killer from the first mum is angry and wants and has revenge. I don't recommended this film especially for the kids because it is violent.",1,3,20,17 January 2005
