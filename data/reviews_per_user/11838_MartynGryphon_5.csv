Pirates of the Caribbean: On Stranger Tides," Sparrow takes flight yet again.
","As long as Johnny Depp continues to don the tri-cornered hat and banadana, it would seem the Pirates Of The Caribbean franchise has a lot of life left in it. After all it is a cash cow that Disney will milk until it's udders fall off.I've noticed in the past that franchise renewals,(Star Wars being a perfect example), seem contrived and somewhat straw clutching in their plots as film makers struggle blindly if not enthusiastically to take their old characters to new levels of excitement. POTC - On Stranger Tides is a welcome exception.I for one was thrilled with this new installment. I found that making the original films a trilogy bloated them slightly so I'm glad that the new movie, can be pretty much classed as a stand alone adventure as the original Movie was before the sequels were made. I also feel that the future of the franchise should lie in these stand alone adventures where you can watch them in any order you want like the James Bond movies and not watch them in any semblance of order just to keep track of the plot.Captain Jack Sparrow is without doubt the best anti-hero the screen has had since Clint Eastwood's 'Man With No Name' in the spaghetti westerns of the 1960's and it is a part that Depp will always be best remembered for. It would be a shame if they ruin the franchise by bloating it with a further interlinking trilogy.It has been a few years since Jack Sparrow graced our screens and it's as if he hasn't been away and everything you expect Jack to be is wonderfully still there. No plot spoilers here I'm glad to say as I do not want to ruin anyone's enjoyment of this magnificent film and you should see it without prior influencing opinionsThe only gripe I have is the 3D version which although is very good fails to capitalise on certain situations that would have been great had the 3D been used more effectively, so I feel that they've missed a trick or two on that score. Hollywood studios have been playing about with 3D now for the better part of 60 years and only in that last 10 years or so have nailed it into a viable art form. We now have the technology but it's the technicians that have let this one down slightly.Don't be upset that there is no Will Turner or Elizabeth Swann in this adventure as that's no bad thing as I feel that their story had gone as far as it could have. As I said earlier, the POTC franchise begins and ends with Jack Sparrow and most importantly, Johnny Depp as Jack Sparrow. As long as he's there, then I'm sure that they'll be many more of these movies to come and thrill us.",10,2,4,20 May 2011
Ocean's Twelve," Very Entertaining if not disappointing
","Oceans 12 has been given a lot of bad press, Some, if not most of it, deserved. However, there is no escaping the fact that this is a very funny and very entertaining movie.The film does have it's bad points though, first of all Andy Garcia reprising his role as Casino Owner Terry Benedict, is hardly given screen time apart for some at the beginning and some at the end, as a result the film is robbed of a really menacing 'bad guy' even though our hero's are in fact villains themselves. With this in mind I cannot help but feel that the trailer is somewhat misleading, as it wrongly portrays Benedict to be a major protagonist in this sequel, when he's there only to flesh out the plot.Three good things about this movie is Matt Damon, Matt Damon and Matt Damon as he is the only person on the screen that is taking his role half seriously, and he's a delight to watch, especially when he takes the reigns when most of his cohorts are incarcerated.Most of the cast from the first film, seems to be there only to tie it in with oceans 11 as Elliott Gould hardly says a thing neither does Carl Riener, and Bernie Mac spends the majority of the movie in a dutch prison and is hardly seen.Clooney and Pitt, don't seem as cool or as smart as in the 1st movie, and the whole team show themselves to be nothing more than frightened children afraid of the boogeyman, when confronted with an irate hotel owner to whom they owe nearly $200 million. So in contrast from the 'who care's who we're stealing from' type of guys we were introduced to a couple of years ago. This is where the disappointment of the movie comes.Catherine Zeta Jones, is introduced as some Interpol type of cop, who conveniently used to have an affair with Pitt's character, and for the first time in ages, she doesn't adopt a phony American accent, which subsequently make this one of her less annoying roles.We are also introduced to a character called 'nightfox' who tries to steal a faberge egg by somersaults, back flipping and dancing over the laser floor sensors, just like erm....Catherine Zeta Jones did in Entrapment.I almost die form Calcium overdose when the movie gets so cheesy to include a scene with Bruce Willis as Bruce Willis and Julia Roberts, pretending to be Julia Roberts, the cheese continues, when a woman comes to question the group from prison, which, (and quite predictably might I add), turns out to be Damon's Characters Mother. and the mozzarella marathon continues in the clichéd and predictable scene where Jones is reunited with her father.Contrary to the shape my review is taking, I did like the movie, and there was enough shenanigans to keep me chuckling throughout. However, a further sequel would be ill advised as it in no way stands up to the 1st movie.This movie will not win any Oscars, but an award should be given to Casey Afflecks Moustache, for 'best supporting actor in a comedy role' such is it's hilarity.",7,5,8,15 February 2005
The Football Factory," The Beautiful Game? Do me a lemon!
","I'm ashamed to say that I found The Football Factory to be perversely enjoyable, despite the fact that it depicts England's worst ever contribution to world culture - Football hooliganism.The film follows a group of Chelsea fans who for some strange and as yet unexplained reason, take sadistic glee by going around and beating seven bells of s*** out of rival football supporters just for jollies. Personally I like to watch the football, munch a steak pie (or two) at half time, neck a few (or more) beers and then sod off home.Football hooliganism was the cancer of Britain's inner cities throughout the 1980's, and was solely responsible for the total expulsion of ALL English football clubs from European competition for a number of seasons. In fact, I froth with rabid anger even today when I think of Coventry City's historic FA cup win in 1987, which would of allowed us, (and for the FIRST time may I add), to participate in the following season's 'Cup Winner's Cup' tournament, HAD WE NOT BEEN BANNED FROM IT! As the 80's gave way to the 90's, hooliganism started to decline and English teams were allowed back onto the European stage. However, the new millennium has seen a new dawn in football related violence and sadly, the cancer we all thought was in remission is back, and it is this re-emergence, that The Football Factory uncompromisingly addresses.Sadly, there are too many British film directors today, who are happy to churn out movies that contain a severe pornography of violence, drug abuse and potty mouthed profanity. The Football Factory has all three in very large and very obscene portions. It's violence is unparallelled, it contains more white powder than a talc factory and MUST hold the record for the amount of C word's used in a fictional motion picture, and I'm not referring to the word CHELSEA if you know what I mean.Director Nick Love rekindles his love affair with urban London, ala 'Goodbye Charlie Bright' and entices a fantastic and believable performance out of Danny Dyer, because those of us who actually come from British Inner Cities will ALL know, or have known, a Tommy Johnson at one time or another. However, the accolade for best performance is reserved for Frank Harper as the psychotic Billy Bright. I thought Harper was absolutely fantastic as Michael Caine's tough bodyguard Stoney in 'Shiner', but his performance as Billy Bright makes Stoney look like a ladies hairdresser in comparison, to the point that if I saw Billy Bright walking down the street I would literally s*** myself.Is it one for the family?, definitely not. Does it glorify Football violence?, maybe. Is it a great movie?, abso-bloody-lutely.However, One day I would love to see one of these gritty urban movies made somewhere other than London, as I am now convinced that most British filmmakers think that there is nothing north of Watford Gap.Enjoy.",7,2,3,17 May 2007
The Artist," A throwback to a bygone age.....and they nailed it to perfection!
","As a lover of both silent movies and early talkies, (as many of my other IMDb reviews prove), I was looking forward to seeing The Artist. However, this was not without a degree of trepidation. I've seen other movies try to parody the silent age using all the available clichés in the book. Flickery images, tinkling piano soundtrack etcetera. I was not expecting any different here.The Artist is the perfect homage to the age and the most realistic reenactment of what the silent movie experience was really like, with a great orchestral score. Silent movies were often accompanied with 100 piece orchestras in the theatre playing emotive music composed specifically for the feature as displayed here in the opening scene.I'm not going to give too much away on plot here but it centre's around a huge silent Hollywood movie star and a career ruined by the advent of sound. Sadly this was a scenario all too real for some actors, most notably John Gilbert, who tried his luck in talkies and failed and Douglas Fairbanks who retired from the screen immediately without even attempting a 'talkie', to whom lead actor Jean Dujardin, bears more than a resemblance.The scenes with Dujardin & the dog reminded me so much of the interplay between William Powell & Asta of the thin man movies of the 30's and 40's.Everything about this movie is ripe with symbolism. The movie is silent because our hero feels he has no voice in the modern world which is brought home in a wonderful scene where everyone and everything has sound apart from him. This scene raised a smile and must have had the Foley boys working overtime to get right.Bérénice Bejo is excellent as the young struggling actress Dujardin befriends, who's star ironically rises as his starts to fall. A nice little inter-title card declares mid-film, 'I want to be alone' a nice nod of the head there to Greta Garbo one of the greatest actresses of the silent age who in early talkies made that phrase her trademark.My nod of the head goes to the film makers that made everything as authentic as possible from the fashions, the music, the cars and the interiors. Look out for some natty dancing from our two leads as well.I've always loved silent movies and although this has been made over 80 years after the art form officially ceased to exist, this is one of the best. Will it revive the genre? Probably not. Will it encourage people to look outside the box and explore silent movies further? That's even less likely. Should it win every award it's nominated for? Certainly.Enjoy!!!",10,10,18,24 January 2012
Detroit Rock City," Tonight I'm gonna party like it's 1978
","As soon as this film began, you knew it wasn't going to win any Oscars, but you didn't mind as the film is so enjoyable from start to finish and is one of the funniest movies I've seen in a long time. Set in 1978, the movie centres around a quartet of male teenagers from Cleveland, Ohio, that are fanatics of the rock band KISS, and have tickets to see them in Detroit. Hawk, Lex, Jam and Trip are the foursome hoping to rock out at the concert, but after Jams 'god-bothering' mother finds the tickets, she burns them much to the horror of our four hero's. Deflated and depressed, the Guys then win tickets to the concert via a Detroit radio phone-in, and head out on the highway for the night of their lives. After an altercation with some disco loving stella's a guido's, they arrive in Detroit, to find that the tickets were not won after all as Trip, (the undisputed arsehole of the group),hung up the phone bfore the DJ could take his details. Once again without a ticket to the concert and with their car stolen, The four are at a loss, knowing that their favourite band are within spitting distance.The teen rockers decide that it's now every man for himself between now and concert time with each then having their own hilarious adventure. I personally can relate to this story as it was only a few years ago that a similar scenario happened to me i.e another city/band playing/no ticket.The acting is great, with Edward Furlong giving a brilliant performance as Hawk. Blessed with the looks of a young Michael J Fox circa Back to the Future, Furlong carries the lead role with confidence and believability. James DeBello, is hilarious as Trip, the true stoner of the group, and his moronic ways of thinking makes you laugh out loud. Lex, was played well by Guiseppe Andrews, though his character did seem superfluous to the proceedings at times. Sam Huntington as Jam gives us probably the strongest performance of the four leads. The character of Jam is a troubled one, and the audience, watching this movie, will love him, pity him and at times want to strangle him too, but the scene where he finally confronts his dominating and narrow-minded mother is the best acting in the whole film. Lin Shaye's portrayal of the mum from hell cannot go overlooked, and she is certainly one of the best character actors ever.If you like your rock music, or if you remember being a teenager that liked rock music, or even if you just like 'hold your gut laughing' teen-comedies, then Detroit Rock City should almost certainly be on your 'to watch list'. Oh! and by the way, This movie has one of the best Kick ASS soundtracks I've heard in a long time, comprising of Kiss (obviously), Black Sabbath, Thin Lizzy, Van Halen, Styx, The Sweet, UFO, AC/DC, Blue Oyster Cult and erm Popcorn by Hot Butter.Enjoy!!!",10,0,2,22 April 2004
