Changeling," Eastwood has outdone himself
","I have been a fan of Clint Eastwood since I saw Fistful of Dollars. I find his directorial capabilities far exceed his acting although I have liked some movies in which he has acted especially Absolute Power.I have seen Angelina Jolie in a few movies and never liked her. She has always come across as a who**sh personality, a high priced p**n star, willing to bear all for a few bucks.However in this movie Eastwood has managed to get excellent performance out of her too which is quite an achievement. All the actors play their characters very convincingly.Overall the movie deserves a rating of full 10.",10,5,7,16 March 2009
Live Free or Die Hard," Plagiarized ?
","I have been under the impression that most of the movies coming out of Hollywood including the Indie ones were originals and not lifted from some other source. I recently came across some new information that proves quite the opposite.Recently a friend of mine brought me some DVDs of a BBC serial 'Spooks' aired initially in 2002, which in my opinion is really great. In season 3 episode 7 which was aired in 2004 there is an identical situation where all the traffic signals turn green causing massive traffic problems accidents and deaths to thousands of bank accounts getting zeroed out. All this done by a security company based in Seattle, Washington.Sounds familiar? Except for being adapted to US there is no difference. I am surprised no one else noticed this. Find the episode details for this BBC TV serial and check it out.",7,1,2,3 January 2010
