Alien 3," Frustratingly Disappointed
","**SPOILERS AHEAD**I can't help thinking how much better this film could have been, had a more talented writer and director been set to work on it, artists who had a better feel for the series.  As it is, I just try to believe that this and it's successor are bad dreams Ripley had after Aliens.The plot holes indicate either a lack of commitment by the creators, or a lack of respect toward the viewers.  For example, there is no logical way an egg could've gotten on the Sulaco, which means that the events in the film couldn't have occurred in the first place.  Ripley's 'great sacrifice' at the end is meaningless, as there is an entire shipfull of eggs ready for collection back on LV-426.Clemens is introduced as the only truly interesting and sympathetic character in the film besides Ripley, and yet is killed off for nothing other than (existential?  Ironic?  Both?) shock value; all that building-up of a character, which is then flushed down the toilet for no good reason. The other characters are largely nameless and forgettable (excepting possibly Dillon and '85'), existing only as cannon fodder to remind us of how mean and scary the Alien is.Many pro-Alien3 fans point out what an alleged departure this film is from the first two, yet the plot is essentially identical to Alien, except with no real suspense and no characters to root/fear for.  We've become well-acquainted with the creatures by now, so there aren't any new surprises there.  The action scenes themselves are rather flat, and Fincher completely lacks the subtlety Scott employed with his 'impressionistic' shots of the Alien in the first film.Fincher's cinematography is well-done, but it's overly stylistic and distracts the viewer, like he's saying to us, 'Look how clever and talented I am!'.  Weaver gives a good performance, but I just wish she had better material to work with.  Alien3 is primarily of interest to film buffs interested in how not to make a successful horror film.

Alien: Resurrection," 'I want to slap this movie so hard, Joel.'
","**SPOILERS AHEAD**God, what a waste.  Where to begin, with a film like this?  It strikes me more as a Saturday Night Live skit based on the Alien films, rather than part 4 of the series.  The very premise behind Ripley's 'resurrection' would make anyone with even high-school level knowledge of biology alternatively cringe or laugh.Jeunet should not have been placed as director.  His style, while visually lovely, is too dramatically lighthearted for this type of film.  The comic-relief is badly-timed, jarring, and ill-suited to the 'Alien tradition', subverting any emotional depth or suspense.  Worse, though, is the pornographic level of violence.  Do we really need to see this much gore?  Remember how little of it was actually shown in the first two films, and yet how unsettling and effective those sequences were?I loved seeing Pinon in an English-language film, but he just seems miscast for this type of thing.  Hedaya should not have been in this either, only more so.  Perlman, while talented in general, is wasted as an unlikable caricature.  Weaver is just awful.  While somewhat interesting in the beginning, she quickly devolves into playing the role for ironic laughs.  I thought Ryder wasn't that bad, actually, but she seems to be here just to bring in more ticket sales.The 'birthing' scene is the most unintentionally hilarious thing I've seen in a Hollywood film in ages.  Dourif's delivery is so over-the-top it provokes snickers.  The Queen herself looks like she's kicked back in stirrups ('Puuuush!').  And the big reveal, the Newborn, is so absurdly stupid-looking I don't understand how it got past the conceptual stage. The way the thing's killed at the end is equally stupid, not to mention the fact that it's physically impossible and not even barely believable (should have stuck with the farm equipment, Joss).Alien3 was an object lesson in promising, but failed filmmaking.  Alien: Resurrection is simply trash, designed by a corporation to make money off of consumers who sadly don't know any better.",Null,0,0,23 June 2001
