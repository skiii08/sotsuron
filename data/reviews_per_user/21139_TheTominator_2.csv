Resident Evil: Afterlife," Expect decent action scenes and you'll be fine.
","The Resident Evil movies are one of the greatest examples of a movies series that is consistently good, but always fails to achieve greatness. RE4 is no exception. The acting is worst than on the rest of the franchise, but the visuals are top-notch and the action is amazing.Milla Jovovich is really disappointing in this, since she doesn't really have as much fighting scenes as i'd have liked, nothing comes even close to the awesome dog kick of the first movie. Spencer Locke had way too little to do here and Boris Kodjoe was a nice surprise.The movie is pretty predictable, every scenario has everything you expect. The single survivor almost has an existential crisis (she should, but still). In the prison, there's The jerk who turns out to be a traitor, the girl who doesn't do much but ends up having some surprise quality that really helps (not really helps, but the swimmer had the right buildup) the mysterious guy who ends up saving everyone, and the newcomers who change the whole system in the prison.But you can forget all that when the zombies show up and the shooting and fighting begins. Alice and Claire are as badass as usual, while Chris was a worthy addition and Luther was pretty meh. I have to say that while the fight choreography was decent, the big showdowns were really disappointing (The dogs, The Executioner, Alice vs. Wesker) And to finish, here's a heads up: If you think Snyder's films have way to much rampaging prepare for some really useless slow mos. It's really senseless since every scene in rampage mode fails to be badass and Executioner vs. Alice wasn't and was much better that way. Also, there were tons of fuel barrels in the prison, so why did no one blow them up when the zombies walked in",7,1,4,28 January 2011
The Butterfly Effect," Sad, bleak, disturbing, a modern masterpiece.
","And surprisingly, well crafted.When The Butterfly Effect came out, it seemed as though it would be a silly drama staring Ashton Kutcher, because, well, it starred Ashton Kutcher. But instead it is one of the most depressing movies to come out this decade.The script is incredible, with very real dialog and a faithful portrayal of modern society on many different ages. Kutcher's character (and his other self). Are very well developed and likable, and Amy Smart's is one of the saddest (and real) characters I've ever seen.Eric Bress's and J. Mackye Gruber's direction is so flawless it's hard to believe this is their debut movie. They can string tension and emotions so well, sometimes even in one scene.The acting ranges from amazing to unbelievable by all members of the cast, regardless of age, But John Patrick Amedori and Amy Smart steal the scene with truly flawless acting, especially given such hard parts.That together makes a truly moving movie. From beginning to end, things just keep falling apart, and every time you may hope everything will turn out okay, something happens and it all goes down the sewer again. Doesn't matter how much Evan tries, it never works out, partially because he wants to much, though. In one life, Kayleigh is a drugged up whore who kills herself, in the next, Evan has Kayleigh, but Thumper, his best friend, hates him. In other, everyone is happy, Tommy and Lenny are both mentally stable, but Evan has to f* it up again because he's handicapped. And that scene kind of ruins his character for me, because it turns him in a selfish guy. The ending, while satisfying in the theatrical version, is out of sync with the rest of the movie, because it is somewhat positive, but is more realistic, which makes the movie more disturbing, and less heartbreaking. The ending of the Director's cut, on the other hand, is far, far bleaker, but the supernatural turn it takes makes the movie less believable.All in all, a must see for everyone, but be warned: It will be a very depressing experience.",10,1,2,21 May 2010
