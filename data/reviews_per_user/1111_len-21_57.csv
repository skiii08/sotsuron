The Blair Witch Project," 9 on a scale of 10
","I saw this movie before I read any reviews on imdb. After going back and reading dozens of them, I realize that many people were unfortunately victims of the hype. By that I don't mean they went to a movie that wasn't worthy of their hard-earned money, but rather they went expecting something other than what the movie delivered.I think the critics loved it so much because it was fresh, unique, original, riveting, well-acted, and because they hadn't been told ahead of time that it was the scariest movie of all time. And, by the way, it isn't.However, if you enter the theater with the only idea that you are going to accept the premise for what it is and go along for the ride and don't expect a Hollywood ending (which would be impossible anyway if it were truly a real story), then you will be more than entertained. I was and so was my wife.I wouldn't call it scary, but I would call it creepy - very creepy. And, it leaves you with some questions that you want to be left with. I mean it would take another hour or more to have answers. The idea is that a film made by dead kids in the forest is found. Do you think they had time to wrap up a perfect ending just immediately before they were killed???? I don't think so.As to the jerky camera movements. All I can say is that I get sea sick on the water as well as queasy when I view surround video. And, I don't like roller coasters, etc. Nevertheless, shortly after the movie began, I didn't think about it again. I was too wrapped up in the adventure.",9,1,1,30 August 1999
Antz," 8 on a scale of 10
","Antz was an interesting movie with excellent animation. I watched it with another adult and 7 & 8 year old girls. Everyone liked it.There were scenes of violence and some language issues, but overall, considering how much kids know today, I thought it was acceptable.The most interesting thing about the movie was guessing the voices. We missed most of the initial credits - catching only the last one which included Sharon Stone. Though I could see her speaking, I became convinced that it was the ditzy brunette on  Just Shoot Me. Then, I decided it was Diane Keaton. In fact, even the facial animation reminded me of Diane Keaton. And, of course, it made sense that she would be Woody Allen's love interest. If you haven't watched it yet, think of those two. Anyway, I was so positive that it was her, I bet $10 against it being Sharon Stone - even though we both saw her name listed and I couldn't figure out who else Stone would be. I may be stupid, but at least I'm $10 poorer.... but I swear it was Diane Keaton!",8,0,0,10 May 1999
Miracle," 10 on a scale of 10
","This movie, though better, was similar to Rudy or Hoosiers or Rocky in that it was a sports story of success against incredible odds. I gave those others a 9/10. I've watched thousands of movies and only rated 19 of them as a 10. I'm going to make this only my 20th rating of a 10/10. The reason is because the story is so much more important, so much broader, and the payoff is so much greater than those others. Therefore, it had/has more effect on me directly. The only other sports movie that I gave a 10 to was Field Of Dreams - my all-time #2 movie.I'm not a hockey fan at all, but it doesn't really matter what the game was. It was the story that was compelling. I can't imagine that I watched the game live in 1980. I don't remember for sure, but I just cannot imagine it. I am pretty sure that I couldn't have cared less. I probably assumed they were going to get the snot beat out of them and, thus didn't watch. Because of this, I don't think I have ever appreciated the full significance of the game.The movie spends a fair amount of time bringing us up to date through the 70's as to what was going on in the world. The point of that was to try to lay a foundation for the event as well as to essentially lead us to accept that, in a way, this victory marked the first step toward changing the 70's disasters into 80's successes.But, here is the whole thing for me. Yes, it was interesting and very well done. But, I have to be honest. The last 20 seconds or so of the Russian game literally took my breath away. I actually started to lose my breath. It was so well done that I almost jumped out of my seat and yelled when the buzzer went off. And, believe me, that takes A LOT! In that respect, had I been a fan of the sport (NOT) and would have been watching during the game in 1980, I would have probably gone insanely wild at the end of that game. It was something incredibly special and the movie did a great job of building the suspense and making it real.'Do you believe in miracles?' is the greatest sports line in history and now I really understand why.Also, I just have to say - Russell was fantastic.",10,0,0,10 February 2004
Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," 9 on a scale of 10
","Welcome home. That's how I felt when I saw this movie. It was wonderful to become reacquainted with the series. I can't come up with a single objection to the movie. I can't say it blew me away (well, the special effects did), but it was as good as it could be short of that.Lucas did a magnificent job of setting the stage for the next episodes and for the 'future' trilogy. I thought I would surely have to watch the other 3 movies first to get prepared. I didn't get the chance, but I wouldn't have needed to. Of course 15 years or so is a long time to patch any holes.",9,0,1,30 June 1999
Catch Me If You Can," 8 on a scale of 10
","Not a classic, but interesting. I have to say I have never seen a movie based on a real life person whose entire life was a con. So, it was original, and therefore, a worthwhile 2 hours of my time.I thought DiCaprio and Hanks were both good. Hanks is ALWAYS good. The only downside was the lack of interaction between them. Of course, there likely was little, if any, interaction between them in real life, but all movies based on a good guy and a bad guy are enhanced by the 'relationship' between them.Otherwise, no complaints, just simple entertainment.",8,1,2,24 June 2003
Minority Report," 8 on a scale of 10
","This is a movie that is nearly perfectly made. It is also a movie that has a brilliantly conceived idea. Very creative. I admire just about everything about it. The direction by Spielberg was typically fantastic. Amazingly enough, I could find almost no holes or contradictions despite the unbelievable risks it takes with time lines.And, although 8 is a good rating - and I really probably would give it an 8.4, it still didn't quite do enough for me. I was never bored. I was satisfied with the ending. The acting was especially good. There really isn't a whole lot to criticize. In fact, even the genre is one that I have a bias for. But, there was something that kept it from being a 9 or 10.I think it boils down to this. It was too long and it required too much work. I realize that 2 hours is no big deal, but the intensity and constant mental gymnastics required were just more than I felt like giving on the day I went. If I was less mentally exhausted from work and had all the time in the world, I probably would have rated it higher. Now, that's not the movie's fault, but I have to rate it based on my own experience.I remember other past/future movies that I thought were great - and I had to think hard to appreciate them too. But, as I think about them as I write this, I realize I wouldn't necessarily want to see them today either. I guess the moral of the story is that any movie is subject to the particular point you are in your life. At least for now, give me something simple. Life is complicated enough.",8,0,0,7 July 2002
Meet the Parents," 7 on a scale of 10
","When I voted I clicked an 8. Although it was a mistake, it could have been an 8. In fact, it definitely was between a 7 and an 8. I just believe it failed to meet the standard that should be met to qualify for an 8.I suspect the audience I saw it with would, by and large, give it an 8 or better. There was a lot of laughing - and some by me. The movie had enjoyable characters and some entertaining circumstances.However, it had a couple serious flaws. In the first place the beginning and end were good - very easily 8 caliber. The middle 45 minutes or so, however were difficult to watch. The torture that Matt Damon had to go through was actually painful - not funny.Also, the biases that the other characters had against his character were unreasonable and unbelievable. But, worst of all was how quickly they came around to befriend him near the end of the movie based on very little reason.I found the movie somewhat disjointed and I'm barely able to recommend it.",8,0,0,17 October 2000
Mulan," 8 on a scale of 10
","What is there to say? Another Disney movie. Excellent characters for kids. A great story. And, wonderful voices - especially Eddie Murphy. Me? I'm 46. I saw it with my two girls who are 7 and 9. It makes them happy, so it makes me happy.Of course I would rather watch something for an adult, but even as an adult it is a good movie - a 10 for the girls and an 8 for me.",8,0,0,21 August 1999
As Good as It Gets," 9 on a scale of 10
","Simply put, this movie was a very enjoyable film to watch. I rank it with Pretty Woman, Roxanne, Sleepless in Seattle, The Goodbye Girl, etc. as other romantic comedies in the 9/10 category.It is difficult to say why any movie rates a 9 instead of a 10. Mostly it is just a gut feeling. In this case there are a couple specific weaknesses. 1) You have to be able to believe that a young woman (Helen Hunt) would become interested in someone as old as Jack Nicholson. More unbelievable is the fact that his character is anyone other than someone she would ever get interested. 2) The radical extremes from complete disdain to love and back and forth are too far fetched to be believed.Still the acting was sensational and everyone deserved all the credits they got. The characters were very interesting and it was easy to root for them. It was a feel good movie and that alone gets an extra brownie point from me.",9,0,0,1 January 1999
Shakespeare in Love," 9 on a scale of 10
","I went to this movie in 1999 because it won an Oscar. I don't know Shakespeare and don't care - gobbledygook. (I told my friend's kids that he was famous because he invented the Chocolate Shake.) I enjoyed the movie, but I was dealing with major emotional issues literally during the movie and it affected my judgment. What I'm not sure of is whether it made my opinion of the movie stronger or weaker.For future reference.....It is not a good idea to go see a double story about the greatest unfulfilled loves in the history of storydom WITH the person who you are going through an emotional crisis with! It was a very sad experience, but the movie was excellent.Besides that, I really had no objection except that it is a period piece - not my favorite genre. It was well acted, looked great and never lagged in interest.",9,1,2,17 October 2004

Number of excruciatingly boring seconds = 8458 (two seconds subtracted for the two smiles). And, believe me it seemed like 20,000!All I can say is that my kids drug me to this movie after they had already seen it once. What a fool I was. Look, cartoons are for kids. How complicated is that? There is no reason I should like this movie anymore than there is for them to like The Matrix.",4,0,1,18 June 2003
How to Lose a Guy in 10 Days," 7 on a scale of 10
","This was your typical run of the mill romantic comedy. I like the genre. In fact, two of my all-time favorite movies were When Harry Met Sally and American President. However, this movie was only average for this genre.I like Matthew McC. quite a bit. I see no reason he can't star in any light-hearted movie and be a major strength. But, Kate Hudson sucks. Oh, that the movie would have cast a Meg Ryan or Julia Roberts or someone OTHER than Kate Hudson. Despite my wife's strong disagreement, I don't find her attractive or interesting. Part of it was that we were supposed to kind of dislike her character until the end. But, that was a small part of my problem with her. She just sucks and I don't want to ever see a movie with her in it again. I have no idea on this planet why she is popular! Goldie Hawn would have been better in the role - today!I also found the story weak. I thought the concept was potentially brilliant and certainly peaked my interest. But, the reviews were very so-so. That didn't stop my wife from renting it. And, now I get the last laugh as I write the final chapter on the saga. There are many better romantic comedies. Save yourself the trouble unless you are an insane Matthew McC. fan.",7,0,1,1 September 2003
The Mummy," 7 on a scale of 10
","This movie easily warrants an 8 as a rating, but I only gave it a 7. The reason is simply because we have seen it all before. It is extremely similar to The Raiders of the Lost Ark series.The differences are that Harrison Ford was a much more likable, charismatic hero. The special effects, though dazzling, were actually overdone. The simplicity of the special effects in Raiders was part of what made it so enjoyable. Afterall, the movie takes place in the 1920's or 30's. It seems a little bit like putting ketchup on ice cream to me.All in all it was good and well worth seeing. There are too many problems with the plot to give it more than a 7 even if I hadn't seen 'it' before. Let's see, 10 plagues. OK, here goes. 1... 2... 3... 4... 5... 6..., and 'last but not least' . New math, I guess.",7,0,0,20 May 1999
Crash," 5 out of 10
","Best picture of the year??? YOU HAVE GOT TO BE KIDDING ME!!! It looked like a cross between an angry Spike Lee movie, Falling Down - the angry Michael Douglass on a bias barrage, and a souped up version of NYPD Blue in the gritty city.First of all, there was NOTHING believable about any of it. Nothing, nada. You cannot tell me a single scene, nor a single story line that had even a hint of believability to it. Every single character in the movie was played WAYYYY over the top. In every case, they would have been obliterated in real-life society LONG before they got to appear in this movie.Oh, and snow in LA. A mother of dead son spurning her other son. A cop going back into a burning car to save a woman that he knows could 'finger' him. And, on and on and on and on and on and on and on. Endless................The number of coincidences to allow all of them to end up interacting with each other is just plain ludicrous! What are we... 4th graders? Please!!!!!!!! What also bugged me to no end was the UNBELIEVABLE number of things that happened to all these people in the space of 24 hours. Not only was in completely impossible, but the number of times that it was PAINFULLY impossible ... are too many to count.If I want to see a movie about racism, I can watch Spike Lee or Falling Down. Either would be a more than worthy substitute for this GROSSLY OVERRATED movie! I give it a 5 out of 10 because except for all that, it wasn't that bad.Len",5,1,3,28 April 2006
Pan's Labyrinth," 6 on a scale of 10
","I simply can't see what all the fuss is about regarding this movie. There have been hundreds of more violent movies. There have been dozens of more magical movies. There have been tens of better war movies.What's more, there was very little, if any, character development. We were sympathetic to the child, but pretty much couldn't care less about any of the other participants. All of them were disposable.I don't like subtitles, but I can live with them and decided not to penalize the movie for them. But, given the choice, it's a no-brainer.The biggest problem with the movie is simple. It's the ketchup and ice cream analogy. Both are good, but they suck together. Here is a war movie with a child who lives in a fantasy world - presumably in order to escape her terrible surroundings. The fantasy was fairly interesting. The war was fairly interesting. Putting both together in the same movie is ketchup and ice cream. It is irrelevant to me that the reason the fantasy even exists is because of the war. The fact is, they don't mesh well in a movie. But, I will admit, that's just my opinion. Someone else may find the exist together just fine.Len",6,11,23,17 June 2007
Sweeney Todd: The Demon Barber of Fleet Street," 2 on a scale of 10
","One of the worst movies I've ever seen. Incredibly bad. Let's see if I have this straight.1) Not funny, so just in case I missed the joke, there was NO joke.2) The 'music' SUCKED!!! Give me Chicago or Fiddler on the Roof or Little Shop of Horrors or Music and Lyrics or a thousand others. This is the worst excuse for music I've ever heard in a movie by a country mile.3) Almost no likable characters. We can't even like the stars. Even if we did originally, we find out we shouldn't have.4) Dark, dark, dark, dark, dark.5) Heavy English accent. Maybe with subtitles, I could have given this a 3, but a 2.00001 is a little more like it.6) Ridiculously over the top gruesome bloody OJ Simpsonish throat slashings. And, not once or twice - many, many, many times. BORRRRINNGG!! 7) Oh, yum. Mommy, can I have one of those human meat sandwiches with roaches crawling all over them? The fact that the masses seem to like this unGODLY piece of Tim Burton crap no longer shocks me. You can never go wrong underestimating the intelligence of the average movie goer! Len P.S.

Star Wars: Episode II - Attack of the Clones," 8 on a scale of 10
","I enjoyed this movie just about as much as Episode I. I gave that movie a 9. I suppose the only reason I didn't give this movie the same as that is because the issue of nostalgia wasn't as big an ingredient in this movie. The last one was wonderful in part because it was the first episode of the SW series in 15 years. Having grown up with the other 3, I was eager to say the least.Nevertheless, there was a lot to like in Episode II. In fact, I never felt like it was dragging and there were just as many fun innovative ideas as any other episode. One problem with any movie is that by the time you get to part 5, you have just about seen it all. And, it is hard to make the argument that it should receive as high a rating as earlier episodes.I love Yoda, but I have to say I was a little blown away by the fact that he uses a cane to walk and yet, when necessary, is able to fight like a champion. Seems inconsistent, but after all, he is a Jedi Knight.",8,0,1,3 December 2002
10 Things I Hate About You," 7 on a scale of 10
","This movie maintains an even pace throughout. I enjoyed it and was never bored. However, I have to say that I only laughed a couple times and chuckled a few more. As this was a comedy, after all, I can't give it higher than a 7 despite the fact that I really liked all the characters and thought it was well acted.Nevertheless, it was definitely a lightweight movie. As is the case with most movies and certainly all lightweight movies, I won't remember it a week from now. If you have a few extra bucks to spend and a couple hours to kill and can't find anything better to do, rent it. Otherwise, hunt on cable or surf the net.",7,0,0,17 October 1999
Notting Hill," 8 on a scale of 10
","This was a pleasant movie to watch. I enjoyed it from start to finish. I'm glad I went. I rate it an 8.However...... I was a little disappointed. I know it is unfair to base a movie's payoff on the expectations I had going in, but I had heard that it was fantastic, but I only saw it as another You've Got Mail.I love Julia Roberts and I think Hugh Grant was more than adequate as a leading man. It's just that I didn't feel like the movie took control of me the way some romantic comedies do.Still, I can't specifically think of any criticism of it that is worth mentioning. But, at the same time, it won't be a romantic comedy that I will remember like When Harry Met Sally or Roxanne or Pretty Woman or The American President.",8,0,0,7 June 1999
The Italian Job," 9 on a scale of 10
","First of all I pretty much love heist movies. I love good action movies too. So, that gives this film a big jump on getting a good rating from me. But, of course, they have to deliver and The Italian Job does just that.I really have almost no objections to this movie. It is great fun and I hated to see it end.The only two extremely minor objections were 1) I prefer Ed Norton as a good guy. 2) The only ridiculously ridiculous issue was their parking right in front of the gate. Of course, almost everything in a movie like this is ridiculous. That's a given. But, the staking out the gate so visibly was over the line.Still those are so minor that they almost are irrelevant. And, I would have given it a 9 even if Norton were a good guy and there was no gate issue. That's about as good as I can give any movie that isn't some type of brilliant production.Better than Ocean's Eleven IMHO.",9,0,1,18 June 2003
The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring," ZERO on a scale of 10
","It is impossible for me to tell you how desperately you need to NOT go to this movie. IT IS A TOTAL RIPOFF!!!!!All they had to do was throw it in the lake or give it to Big Bird to drop in the volcano. That would have been too simple, but it would have saved me $8 plus what seemed like a week and a half of my time.But, if it were just a weak movie (and I don't think I can ever remember giving any movie a ZERO) then fine. I was prepared to give it a 6 or maybe a 7 until the last 30 seconds when I knew it was ending.SPOILER?? Though I don't see why this would be a spoiler. The spoiler would be if I DIDN'T tell you this. YOU CANNOT EVER, EVER, EVER have a movie that has no ending!!! You can have a TV episode without an ending. You wait a week and watch it. Doesn't cost you a cent. Set the VCR. But you cannot EVER have a movie that does it. Totally unacceptable and I will do anything and everything in my meager powers to see to it that not one person ever spends one second of their time or one cent of their hard-earned labor to line the pockets of the thieves that stole from me.For the love of God, for the sake of humanity, don't even THINK about going to see this rip-off!",1,1,6,4 January 2002
Cast Away," 9 on a scale of 10
","There is a lot to say about this movie. It was 2 hours 23 minutes, but had about 6 hours of memories. The airplane scene was a classic. Nothing in a movie terrifies me, but I have to say that was about as terrifying a scene as you will ever see. The most amazing thing is that it held you in terror for what must have been 10 minutes.There were a number of other times that the movie caused you to cringe in perceived pain. And, each time set a new standard. Half the audience hid their head and the other half closed their eyes. We all knew what was going to happen.But, that aspect of the movie was only a part of the overall experience. It was also a powerful movie about the human spirit - about courage - about endurance. It is impossible to fully appreciate what it would have been like, but CAST AWAY did a pretty good job of helping us to imagine it.Also, it was a rather moving love story as the Hanks character was in love with the Hunt character all the years he was stranded on the island. When they were reunited, it was truly one of the great scenes ever in movies. The conflict between desire and reality was extremely intense.No pat endings, but definitely symbolism - and a sense of coming full circle. You felt sorry for him, but you also wish you could have the freedom that he obtained after he escaped the island. And, I don't mean just the freedom from being stranded. I mean the mental freedom of knowing who you are and knowing what is important.",9,0,0,2 January 2001
Terminator 3: Rise of the Machines," 9 on a scale of 10
","I really have no complaints about this movie. I had been wanting to see it for quite awhile and finally rented it on CD. I liked it at least as well as the others. Probably more. I've been in the mood for action lately. Action starved. Too many Beaches movies. And, this movie has action. In fact, I remember several times thinking that I couldn't look away even for a moment afraid of what I would miss. That's the definition of action in my book.Unlike a lot of action movies, it wasn't just mindless mayhem. Each individual scene had a point --- in addition to the mindless mayhem. I even liked the plot quite a bit. Logical. And, I love movies that mess with the time line as long as it makes sense.The other nice thing about T-3 is that it set us up for T-4, T-5, etc. I don't know exactly how Arnold is going to do it since by the time he gets out of politics, he won't look anywhere near as chiseled and it will be hard to believe he is the best the robots have to offer. I would still like to see him have a role, but since robots don't age, it might be tough.All in all, excellent mayhem of the first-rate mindless variety.",9,8,10,30 January 2004
Spider-Man," 6 on a scale of 10
","SPOILERS! If I had never seen Superman, then I might have rated this movie higher. Actually, I almost certainly would have rated it a 7. But, it is a TOTAL RIP-OFF of the first Superman movie. Let me count the ways.1) Youthful boy discovers his powers. 2) Has adopted parents. 3) No other siblings. 4) Father dies unexpectedly and is focal point for future endeavors. 5) Falls in love with girl who doesn't know his identity. 6) Saves girl's life in alley. 7) Saves girl's life while falling from building. 8) Flies everywhere he goes. 9) Metropolis 10) Daily Planet vs XXXXX Planet (I forget the name) 11) Editor of paper obsessed with inside scoop. 12) Real life superhero works for paper. 13) String of bad guys stopped from doing harm. 14) City questions integrity of superhero. 15) Girl falls in love with superhero. 16) Saves girl's life one last time at end of movie. 17) Showdown with arch enemy - which he wins.And, I'm sure I have overlooked some of them. I mean it was ludicrous. I might as well be watching Superman over again. Thank God, they didn't have him changing in a phone booth!Besides that, there were numerous ridiculous events - such as when he got the holy crap beat out of him and yet he showed up at the funeral a couple days later without a scratch. And, how is it possible that she didn't know who he was. Please!And, what was the deal with all her boyfriends. First the big lug in school, then the bad guy's son, then Spiderman, then the superhero. Ridiculous.But, here is my biggest complaint about Spiderman. Where in the hell does all that goo come from? I mean in the space of 30 seconds, he used up more goo than he has in body weight. I mean, please!Lastly, he was grossly miscast in my opinion.If you just want mindless entertainment and you haven't either 1) seen Superman or 2) don't care about the similarities, then go waste a couple hours on it like me.",6,0,0,26 May 2002
Ocean's Eleven," 7 on a scale of 10
","I went into this movie expecting it to be great. It wasn't even close to great. Other than the fact that it had one of the most recognizable casts in history and the fact that it was very slick, it lacked quite a bit. As a 'theft' movie, it really offered nothing new. The twist was interesting, but not one of those things where you hear yourself say, 'wow'.I like this type of movie and I like the actors, so I don't feel cheated. A 7 is better than everything below it! Nevertheless, the chemistry was notably lacking in my opinion. Also, since I was miserably assaulted by TRAFFIC not all that long ago, any movie made my Soderbergh will, at least for awhile, have the Soderbergh stench.If you are interested only in movies that have even the slightest amount of believability, don't bother watching this one. Far too many implausible actions.Still, if you want to just sit back, turn off the brain and appreciate the star power and the continuous activity, it wasn't half bad.",7,0,1,10 December 2001
Pearl Harbor," 9 on a scale of 10
","Pearl Harbor was a visually stunning movie. Fantastic special effects, brilliant colors and wonderful to look at - as most movies set in Hawaii are. But, to imply these qualities are the sole - or even primary - reason to see the movie would be grossly misleading.First and foremost it is an education about what brought us into WWII and it is told in a way I have never seen and rarely heard. The educational aspect alone was worth the price of admission.Secondly, and most rewarding, it is the story about a woman and the two men in her life, their relationships, trials and, ultimately, their tragedies. This is a marvelous love story that has several chaotic twists - symbolic of the times. Even their hearts were at the mercy of events far beyond their control.Lastly, the movie was an awe-inspiring war movie. Bigger than life. Nothing can prepare you for how shocking (even to this day) it is to see American ships lined up like fish in a barrel and knowing that at any moment the lives of everyone there - and the lives of everyone around the world would be changed forever. The sudden and intense level of carnage was visually and emotionally played out on the screen in such a way as to permanently implant it on our minds - much as Saving Private Ryan did with the beach landing.I can only think of a couple criticisms of the movie and they are fairly minor. One criticism worth mentioning is that they could easily have shaved 30-40 minutes from the 3 hours and still maintained the level of intensity.Also, the Cuba Gooding character was one of the most extraneous add-ons I have ever seen in a movie. He had nothing to do with the other 90% of the movie we saw. His 10% was in its own world. I don't doubt that the reason it was there was to make sure the message of Pearl Harbor was that there were heroes - white AND black. But, either they should have tied it in better or left it out.Still, as I say, my criticisms are minor. The story was an epic tale in the scope of the Titanic. Better story, more action, superior acting and a visual masterpiece. Hard to beat. Glad I went.",9,0,1,7 July 2001
Remember the Titans," 8 on a scale of 10
","Naturally, any movie that I rate an 8, I liked. It was an excellent story about racial tensions within the world of high school sports in the early 1970's - a period I can identify with since I graduated HS in 1971.The movie was a tightly crafted retelling of a true story that took place in Virginia. As with all 'true' stories, you have to wonder how much of it was embellished to make it more marketable.Actually, I do not believe some things happened the way they showed. I wouldn't have bought them even if it was fiction, so I certainly can't buy them as nonfiction. And, they did detract enough to lower my rating from about 8 1/2 to 7 1/2. Interestingly, in either case, I would have given it an 8 - so in that respect, it was irrelevant except to the enjoyment of the movie.I had just seen another football movie - Any Given Sunday, so I was thrilled to see a decent football movie after that fiasco. But, as football movies go, the best I have ever seen is Rudy.",8,0,1,2 October 2000
Liar Liar," 8 on a scale of 10
","This movie is much more than just a vehicle for Carrey's comedic genius. It is also a sensitive story about a father's love for his son as well as his ex-wife. Additionally, it has a wonderfully creative script which includes a unique 24 hour period where he is physically unable to lie. That makes for hilarious comedy.The movie is a little too goofy for any rating higher than an 8, though the goof factor is slightly lower (and certainly not the entire focus of this film) than usual. But, for what it was, I'm not sure I could ask for anything better.If you like Carrey, you will really like this movie. It is his best overall work and shows a little different side than we have normally come to expect. Not everything he did was sarcastic. In fact, if you really looked into his eyes, you could see that he was actually a little insecure - but lovably so.",8,1,1,27 November 1999
Saving Private Ryan," 9 on a scale of 10
","I seriously doubt that there is anything I can say about this movie that has not already been said. I felt that it was one of the classic war movies I have ever seen. The direction was brilliant. In fact, I would say that was the number one asset. Secondarily, Tom Hanks was great and so was the intensity of the action - almost unparalleled.I nitpicked on a couple things - as I am prone to do, but the main reason I didn't give it a 10 was simply because, like Schindler's List, it was too depressing. I will never give a depressing movie a 10. Now, don't get me wrong. I didn't think it was THAT depressing, but the fact that 8 men set out to bring back one and that most of the 8 (I won't say how many in case you are the only one who hasn't seen it.) die trying to bring him back is a formula that I have a hard time with emotionally. Interestingly, the movie deals with that very subject and allows us to develop our own opinion.Be warned, however. There are lots and lots and lots of dead soldiers and lots and lots and lots of dead soldier's parts.",9,0,0,13 November 1999
"Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon"," 5 on a scale of 10
","A must-miss film, unless you want to waste your time AND money. I went to this movie for one reason - it got an A average by the 10 reviewers in Entertainment Weekly who rate movies. I'm now convinced, having been burned on American Beauty, Traffic and Thin Red Line, that critics LOVE these utterly worthless excuses for entertainment because they are (drum roll) utterly worthless excuses for entertainment (UWEFE). By that I mean, the average critic has seen 10 billion movies. The average excellent movie that entertains most of us (say Castaway or Finding Forrester or Gladiator) is simply some form of rehash that the critic has seen a thousand times. So, when some UWEFE comes out, they love it because it is different. Not good, but from their uppity perspective 'Thank God it is different.' And, they superimpose their relief on the rest of us with some idiotic critique justifying it.Here is why I nearly hated this movie:1) The book was highly superior, and I not only didn't read it, but don't even know if one was ever written!2) All movies have an obligation to lay out the physical rules - if they are different than the known universe - within which they will operate. There was NEVER one single reference made in any way that the players were not human. We were simply led to believe that they were trained by the greatest master(s) in the world. But, I'm here to tell you something. SPOILER ALERT: I don't care if they were trained by JESUS 24/7 for 100 years, they wouldn't be able to fly and walk on water! At least not if they were human. That was so ludicrous that nearly everyone around me was snickering with embarrassment for paying to watch it. (Minus 1.5 points and that's being generous.)3) I HATE SUBTITLES! Now, in fairness, I could have (should have) known going in, but I didn't. The only worthwhile subtitle movie I ever saw as Das Boot many years ago. I am going to a movie to be entertained - not to have to be fearful of looking away for even a second. I do not like to have to go back and forth between the two. Period. It sucks. I hate it. And, I would NEVER do it intentionally. Big negative. (Minus 1.5 points and that's being generous.)4) Here are the movie names of the players (just skim to save time). Li Mu Bai, Shu Lien, Jiao Long Yu (Jen), Xiao Hu Luo (Lo), Sir Te, Jade Fox, Bo, Madam Yu, Tsai, Auntie Wu, De Lu, Gou Jun Pei, Gou Jun Sinung, Mi Biao, Fung Machete Chang, Monk Jing. Now, here is the problem. We not only have to remember their names coming at us one after another (when we have no points of reference), but we also have to remember just as many ping pong, ying yang, hop sing places. And, believe me, they don't make it easy on us. I don't go to movies to have to spend half my time trying to remember which Moo Goo Guy Pan is trying to carve up what Chow Mein - if you know what I mean. If it was Bob, Ted, Carol and Alice in Philadelphia and Baltimore, hey, I've got the reference points. No need for wasted brain cells. Ironically, one of the lines in the movie was 'Who could remember all these long names.' (Minus 1.5 points.)5) WAY TOO LONG. IF a movie is good, then 2 hours plus is ok. If it is bad, then it better be 1:40 or less or it gets a time deduction! (Minus 1/2 point.)Some aspects of acting, cinematography and fighting were good to very good. Some weren't. Some of the fighting scenes were too long and too ridiculous. However, there were enough positives in these areas to outweigh the negatives, so a net wash.The bottom line is this. I possibly could have given this movie of 7 or 8 if it weren't foreign. Too many problems associated with it - not the least of which was culture. Frankly, beyond all my specific criticisms, I just didn't get it. What the heck is jumping off the cliff all about? And, who the heck cares? And, what on earth does the name Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon have to do with anything? And, who the heck cares?But, back to the foreign issue. Perhaps it deserves best foreign film, but best film????!!!! Give me a break! Simply because there is a category for best foreign film, logically (a seriously missing ingredient nowadays) MUST imply that the Oscars are American. This is as far from an American film as it is possible to be! Now, you can call me whatever you want. But, here are the facts. 1) 'I' rate it a 5! 2) 'I' am an AMERICAN! 3) 'I' went to the movie in the heart of AMERICA! 4) 'I' paid AMERICAN dollars! Conclusion: 'I' expect to be entertained as an American!! As far as I know, it may be the greatest Chinese movie ever made. But, then the French like Jerry Lewis and the Japanese like Godzilla too. So, if you think you think like me, then be forewarned. This is one film to avoid!",5,0,0,11 July 2001
Good Will Hunting," 8 on a scale of 10
","Unfortunately, I feel I am in the awkward and depressing position of having to criticize this movie - despite rating it an 8. The reason is because so many people rated it a 9 or 10.I just couldn't root for anyone in this movie - except for Robin Williams. As I am not a huge Williams fan, that left me somewhat empty. None of the characters were particularly likeable.Also, the premise was undermined by the fact that NO ONE on this planet can solve world class mathematical problems without training. No matter who you are, you have to know what the symbols mean in order to understand the problem and interpret it and express the answer - right?Some of the scenes were very good - enough to recommend the movie, but this is a classic movie that I think of as 'well done'. However, if I never hear of it again or see any part of it again, I won't have missed a thing - and neither will you.",8,1,4,7 March 1999

","As always, Michael Douglas is fantastic. If not for him, this preposterous movie would never have been made.I watched with the interest and intensity of an 8 on a scale of 10, but when it was over, I had to vote. It's kind of like eating something good (8), but the after taste is a 5. I mean you have to forget what it tasted like initially, because you are in the present - and sometimes the present tastes pretty bad. Thus a 7 on a scale of 10.My problem was that after it was all over and the mystery all solved (except for the blood on the back of Penn's jacket - what's that all about????) I had to just shake my head over and over and over and the only word that came to mind was preposterous, preposterous, preposterous.But, if you don't care or if you don't worry about that sort of thing or if you can hold your nose 5 seconds after the movie is over for at least as long as the after taste lingers, then you might really like this movie.As for me, I enjoyed the 2 hours, but I will not remember it fondly.",7,1,2,5 September 1999
Moulin Rouge!," 8 on a scale of 10
","Rarely does a movie come along that is as unusual and creative as this one. Even though there is very little similarity (other than a love story, musical and a screwball plot), it kind of reminded me of Little Shop of Horrors. I think there is a fairly good chance that if you liked LSOH, you would like Moulin Rouge.For me, I only rate the first 1/3 of the movie as about a 6-7. It was just too many bizarre scenes that didn't mean anything to me. However, there was one particular moment in the movie (and anyone seeing it will know when it was) that it all turned around. I would rate the last 2/3 as over a 9. I really, really liked it. And, I rarely say this, but I would like to see it again - especially the last hour+.The acting was very good, but the direction was sensational - hard to imagine how it could be beat. The sets were stunning. The music was very enjoyable as it was bits and pieces of modern day soft rock set in Paris a hundred years ago. Quite an achievement. Strongly recommend.",8,0,1,26 June 2001

I'm a math guy and I simply loved the idea of somehow being able to put the world in order via some equation.However, this movie really missed the mark. It was far too ambiguous. There is a TV show running right now called NUMB3RS which is highly superior.I didn't like the fact that everything was black and white. I didn't like the fact that much of it was as though seen through the eyes of someone on LSD. I just wanted a clear vision and story about what magical realization could result from a one in a billion genius stumbling upon an equation that essentially explains it all.I couldn't appreciate any of the characters. If not for the fact that the premise is potentially great, I would rate it considerably lower.",7,1,3,2 April 2005

","Slick? Yes. Lots of action? Yes. Tom Cruise? Yes. Good enough? Maybe.When I came out of the theater, I had decided to give the movie an 8 (7.8 actually), but by the time I got home I had decided to give it a 7.MI-2 is kind of fun to watch. Like I say, it is well crafted and some excellent special effects and really outstanding stunts. But, it has problems too.At over 2 hours, they should have cut 20 minutes of action and added 10 minutes of relationship building between Cruise and his new girlfriend - whatever her name is. As it was, the action got boring by the end. Also, the notion that Cruise would instantly fall madly in love with this girl is ridiculous!  I didn't buy it.Still, it had a few interesting details that I don't recall seeing. And, the first half hour was very good. So, all in all, I would recommend it. Just leave your brain at home!",7,0,0,11 June 2000
Black Hawk Down," 7 on a scale of 10
","I give this movie a 7 somewhat begrudgingly. The reason is because I didn't particularly enjoy it. In fact, after the first hour I was much more interested in the amount of time remaining than I was in the movie. It was constant action, but it was also sort of boring. The reason is because the action was so constant and so consistently the same thing, that it was tiring long before it was over. Minus 1 point.I also deducted a point for the fact that not one single character was even remotely developed. You could EASILY have watched this movie without knowing a single name or a single personal characteristic about any character and you would have lost nothing. The reason is because there was virtually nothing to lose. Far too impersonal. It seems to me we should have been much more aware of at least what was at stake for several of the characters. Instead it was one constant blitz of bullets - the result of which, we really didn't care who got hit since we knew some would get killed and some wouldn't. Minus 1 point.Lastly, I am sick and tired of movies that have the same ludicrously unrealistic scene. Well, in this case, scene after scene after scene. Close your eyes. Imagine 50 soldiers in the street. Now imagine another 50 of the enemy (all with automatic weapons) in the windows and roofs surrounding the soldiers. Now imagine all of them shooting at each other with little cover. Thousands of rounds per minute. OBVIOUSLY, the 50 in the street would be dead within 30 seconds. Well, there you have it. There are numerous 5 minute scenes just exactly as I described where instead of 50 soldiers in the street getting killed, perhaps 3 got hit and they were successfully carried off. Completely ridiculous. Minus 1 point.If you just want to watch blood and guts, you got it - perhaps the best blood and guts movie ever made. But, I can think of at least a dozen war movies that were far superior!",7,0,0,19 January 2002
For Love of the Game," 9 on a scale of 10
","I would have to say that I have seen very few movies better than For Love of the Game. My favorite genre is Romantic Comedy. This wasn't a comedy, but it was feel good. It was light drama and it was extremely well done.Costner portrayed an aging baseball player with a romantic attachment to the game that reminded me of Robert Redford in The Natural - another movie I rated a 9. The symbolism of the movie was the notion of ending a romance for the game and transferring that romance to a woman. For him, at least, there was room for only one at a time. And, fortunately for her, his career was at the very end. Fortunately for us, we got to see his last game interspersed with flashbacks.The movie was brilliantly done with respect to the actual game of baseball. I cannot recall having seen a sports movie that did such an excellent job of maintaining accuracy about the game. I honestly could have believed I was watching an actual game. The plays were realistic. The situations realistic. And, Vin Scully was sensational doing the play by play.I've only rated a few movies as 10's in my life. One of them was Field of Dreams - another Costner vehicle. This movie wasn't far behind FOD. In fact, it was nearly as magical and it was a lot more romantic. Why the reviewers of IMDB only give it a 6.7 is beyond me.",9,34,45,16 August 2000

Reservoir Dogs," 8 on a scale of 10
","This was not far from a 9 rating, but the primary reason I couldn't go with a 9 was that it was just too violent - and not in a sexy way (Godfather or brilliant caper). It was a simple robbery that went bad. However, the story is brilliantly told.Instead of starting out at the beginning and going chronologically, it meanders back and forth between time lines. The bulk of the movie takes place in about a two hour period immediately after the robbery. The acting was also brilliant. The direction sensational.I have to comment on Michael Madsen. He was truly evil - one of the more sadistic performances I have ever seen.SPOILER: Perhaps the most unique thing about the movie was that no one lived. Everyone of them died in the end - some of them at the hands of their own gang. This was a clever and exceptionally well-made film. If you like violence, you might give it a 10. Even if you hate violence, I can't see less than a 7. A real masterpiece. Congratulations to Quentin Tarantino.",8,1,3,23 October 2004

No surprise a very high percentage of people here give it a 10 or 9.My problem with it was that 1) it wasn't perfect, thus a 9 and 2) it wasn't linear, thus an 8. I like movies that have a beginning, middle and end. This movie was all over the map. It essentially ended (chronologically) where it began, but not before bouncing around in the future and the past with no road map.I realize that many people liked the fact that it was different in this respect. I like different, that just isn't one of the differences I like.",8,1,2,23 May 2000

Just on the chance that the last person to see it is reading this, then here goes.There are very few things to quibble about in this movie. The sets are phenomenal. The ship is magnificent. How they could create such a marvel is beyond me. The story is the key, however. It really is a relatively simple boy meets girl, falls in love, saves her life, gives his sort of a tale. A Romeo and Juliet on water.The performers are engaging, but I wouldn't go so far as to say the acting was spectacular. DiCaprio was very good, but otherwise the acting was adequate. The story was extremely good and fit in well to the historical event.I only wouldn't give this movie a 10 because it was a little depressing in the end and it was also a period piece - not my favorite genre. But otherwise it was truly a magnificent achievement.",9,2,3,1 January 2000
Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone," 9 on a scale of 10
","I went into this movie somewhat concerned about whether the subject matter would be offensive to me or anyone else who took religion seriously. I am quite aware that in western culture we tend to overlook many issues that conflict with historical (and conservative) religious viewpoints. Halloween would be a great example.However, as I watched this movie I realized that considering the absence of any direct references to God or to the Devil, everything else was pretty much fair game. Furthermore, I had to ask myself why would this movie be offensive and yet evil, non human entities such as the Klingons or the Borg aren't. And, I couldn't come up with an answer. So, I look at it as a modern day fantasy (which it is) set in London that isn't all that much different than a futuristic science fiction movie about the struggle between good and evil.Once I was over that issue, I could examine the movie on its merits. I had no idea how long it was until someone told me the time after the movie. I thought it was probably 2 hours, but I was surprised to hear it was over 2 1/2 hours. That clearly is a positive because it meant I wasn't bored.The movie is extremely well crafted and the special effects are first rate. I was reminded of so many other movies as I watched it from Superman to the Wizard of Oz. But, it was about as unique a movie as you could ever hope to see. Having not read the book (a ridiculous waste of time when I can get it all for just a 2 1/2 hour investment), I had no idea how fantastic was/is the imagination of JK Rowling. How anyone could create an entire world such as this is remarkable - to say the least. Really, the Einstein of imagination.One other thing. I noticed that the best two women groups in IMDB were under 18 years old and over 45 years old. And, the best men group is over 45 years old. That also is remarkable. It says that a story about a young boy in a fantasy world is liked as much or more by geezers such as myself. And, when you add the fact that ALL kids want to see it, you have the makings of a mega hit - perhaps the biggest of all time.",9,0,0,18 December 2001

They just keep taking it to the next levelThough the action was also corny, it was amazing to see what they can accomplish in cyberspace. Frankly, I loved the scene where NEO fights about 50 of the bad guys. Ludicrous? Yes. But, entertaining? A much bigger yes.Did I understand all of the plot? No way. But, at the same time, I'm not sure I needed to. This is about a big picture story of machines versus man. I can understand that and that's all that matters.I am anxiously awaiting volume III. Fortunately, I waited until II was out on tape before I saw it, so I can see III anytime without losing too much to memory.If you like pure, raw action you will like this movie. It would probably help to see the first version before this one, but I'm not so sure it matters.",9,0,0,8 November 2003
Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets," 8 on a scale of 10
","I gave the first Harry Potter movie a 9 and I honestly cannot determine there to be one iota difference in the entertainment or quality value of the second one from the first. And, I have a little problem with dropping a rating purely based on the fact that it is the second time around, but I did. The first movie was a whole new world that I had never seen or heard of. The second movie wasn't. That isn't the movie's fault. And, if the first movie I had seen was the second one, I would likely have given it a 9 too. But, it wasn't.I really have no criticisms of Chamber of Secrets. Once again, I was amazed how well it kept my attention for being as long as it was. It is a fascinating world. But, the only reason I didn't rate the first one a 10 is because it isn't a world that I would naturally be drawn into. As good as it is, it isn't necessarily my first choice for a genre. A kid in a magical world only rates so high.But, if you liked the first one, it would be impossible not to like this one. They are very, very similar - with just a different story line. But, even then, the good guys are the same good guys and bad guys are the same bad guys.It was poignant to see Richard Harris in his last role. I will miss him.

The only reason I didn't give it a 10 is because it isn't my favorite genre - you know, seeing men fry (literally) in the electric chair. I'd rather watch Sci-Fi or Romantic Comedies. But, given the nature of the movie it was truly sensational.The acting was as good as you will ever see in a movie. The direction was fabulous. The attention to detail was great. I know of no inconsistencies and I look hard for them. Some may complain about the 3:08 running time, but I rarely thought about the length. The movie was consistently riveting.Some of the scenes were among the most powerful I have seen in quite a while in a movie. Some I won't forget for a long time.The religious overtones were a welcome refreshing addition to the movie and added a critically important element to it. If not for them, the movie would not exist.Tom Hanks is great as usual as is the rest of the cast. However, you can bet your LIFE that David Morse will be nominated for best supporting actor.

","Ok, as I give this movie a 9, it is going to be hard to be critical, but I feel as though that is the responsibility of anyone who doesn't rate a movie a 10.First of all, the acting was sensational - as good as I have seen in a long time. The direction was great and the script was great. And, it turned into (unexpectedly) a true buddy story.I could only criticize a couple things - one of which was NOT the length - 2:20. I found it a little troubling that most of the criminals were extremely nice guys - except for the obligatory bad guys in the shower. I also have to confess a real distaste for the homosexual overtones - especially early on. But, then what prison movie attempting to depict real life could leave that out???Also, prison movies in the 1940's, 1950's and 1960's are not my favorite genre, however one of the advantages of prison movies are that you really don't care very much what period it takes place in.

Look, if you want to watch a good sports movie, watch Hoosiers or Rudy or For Love of the Game or The Natural or Field of Dreams. And, I could go on. But, if you want to watch the WORST sports movie I ever recall having seen, feel free to waste an ungodly amount of time (2 hours 42 minutes) on this pile of crap.I'll tell you one thing. Whoever put this movie together - whether the producer, director, editor or writer knew ABSOLUTELY NOTHING about football. Now, if you too know ABSOLUTELY NOTHING about football, you are 1/3 of the way toward being able to tolerate it. If you have ABSOLUTELY NO concept of chronology and time lines then you are another 1/3 of the way toward being able to tolerate it. If you don't mind horrible music and overacting by Pacino and Woods as well as others, then you might crawl your way up to a move that is passable. But, otherwise, for the love of God, save your time and money.I watched this movie with my wife and a couple friends. Now, we all know football. But, more importantly, we all have IQ's of over 50. We began the movie asking questions like 'Wasn't it supposed to be such and such.' Then, we progressed to 'That couldn't be true because of ....' Finally, the last 10 hours (oops, it just seemed like 10 hours), we were laughing hysterically at the ludicrous attempts to pretend it was supposed to be a serious insight into professional football.I cannot begin to list the at least 100 implausible, absurd mistakes and mischaracterizations that we couldn't help but see. Just let me give you a simple example. On one play of one of the games, a receiver catches a ball in the endzone. Fans scream. Immediately, the next shot is the ball on the 8 yard line, 1st and goal. This is one example that is representative of the inexplicable, incomprehensible, incompetent view of professional football.Perhaps if the movie itself had characters that we could root for or if we weren't forced to die of boredom by the time the 2 1/2+ hours had passed, maybe we could overlook some of the glaring weaknesses. BUT NOOOOOO. You can thank Oliver Stone exclusively for this fiasco. I have enjoyed some of his movies (JFK for example). But now in retrospect, if his attention to detail was only 1/10 as bad in JFK as it was in AGS, then JFK wasn't anywhere near as good as I thought.MISSSSSSSSSSSS ITTTTTTTTTTTTTT !!!!!!",4,0,2,4 September 2000

","In some respects, this movie was well done enough to be an 8 or 9, but in another very important aspect, the movie deserved a 5. So, I give it a 7. I like Mel Gibson a lot and the rest of the actors were fine. The concept was interesting. It had good intensity. And, the film looked very good. But, critiques are about criticism. And, ultimately, the movie was fairly ludicrous.I have two favorite genres. One of them is Sci-Fi. Anytime you watch a Sci-Fi, you have to suspend disbelief. But, I have always maintained that you do not have to suspend logic. By that, I mean, a movie should be consistent within the parameters it sets for itself. This movie did not.SPOILERS: I could go on all day, but how did the alien whose fingers got cut off manage to figure out where to come??? Was it looking for revenge? Where did it pick up the friend? Furthermore, they can travel across time, but they can't figure out how to get out of a closet??? And, why exactly doesn't it have any weapons? It can travel across time, but it can't carry a 6 shooter??? And, what is with the water? We have figured out how to wear protective covering since the middle ages, but despite being able to travel across time, they can't figure out how to protect themselves from water??? I mean, it was just one big duh after another in the last 30 minutes or so. They can travel across time, they plan to take over our world, and they need crop circles to tell them where to congregate??? PLEASE!!!The irony is that when we first went to this movie, we only got to see the first 70% of it before the theater - and all the other theaters - were evacuated for some fire (supposedly). So, we went back at a later date. We would have been better off never having gone back and just appreciating the first 70% and imagining the last 30%. If you can overcome the ludicrous assumptions at the end, you probably will like the movie. I can never forgive stupidity. But, I can forget. This is a movie I will forget.",7,0,2,26 August 2002
Identity," 8 on a scale of 10
","Very good suspense thriller. It would have been good even if it had not had the twists in it that it had. We get the idea very early on that there is more to the movie than just a bunch of travelers trapped in a storm at a motel in the middle of nowhere. They begin dying, but we know there is something odd going on that we can't put our finger on. Of course, we can't guess it. Who could? But, we are intrigued as a few of the early scenes go backward in time - making us realize we there is something to this time line issue. We also (if we were smart enough) might figure out that much of this takes place..SPOILERin someone's mind. Or does it? Even to the end, we are not completely sure. It is clever and unique. I liked it a lot. I only didn't give it a 9 because I watched two movies tonight and gave the other one a 9 already and I'm thinking that I am being too generous.But, when you compare it to the average slasher movie, there really is no comparison. This is an excellent suspense thriller with a major twist.",8,0,1,30 January 2004
The Sixth Sense," 8 on a scale of 10
","This is a movie that was only a 7 for the first 30% of the film, a 7.75 for the next 65% of the film and an 11 for the the last 5% of the film. Doing the math.... 7.69.The acting was brilliant as everyone has said. The kid was remarkable - the best kid performance I can ever remember (casting deserves a lot of credit though, his face is perfect for the required looks). The story is interesting and unique.There are a few scares, but mostly just an interesting and tense movie..... until the end.The surprise at the end immediately forces you to rethink the whole movie scene by scene to see if the logic holds up. Overall, it does. Though there are obvious impossibilities along the way, they are easily dismissed (retrospectively) by simply accepting the fact that in the spirit world, not everything operates 'normally'. So, given that premise, the brilliant ending is both shocking and powerful.So, why not a higher score? I'm not a fan of horror pictures. I'd rather see Sci-Fi or Romantic Comedy any day.",8,0,0,21 August 1999
The Matrix," 9 on a scale of 10
","This was a long movie - during which my opinon changed somewhat. I usually try to avoid rating it until it is nearing completion - thinking about what could cause it to be rated one notch higher or lower between that point and the end. I just love statistics!Anyway, for much of it, I had decided that the essence of the movie deserved a 7 and the special effects deserved a 9. But, the last half hour of Matrix is so sensational and unbelievable (the effects 10+ and the story and substance at least a strong 8), that I ultimately gave the movie a 9.This is the best special effects movie ever made without question! If ever there was a movie to see at a big screen theater - this is it. Even those (including the person I went with) who don't love the genre (cross between Blade Runner, Aliens, and Terminator) will be mesmerized by the special effects.I truly don't know what's next with special effects, however every few years I believe that I've seen a movie which moved them to a new level. And, each time, I can't imagine what more they can do. The exciting thing is that they will keep getting better - and I'll be there.",9,0,0,17 April 1999
Thirteen Days," 8 on a scale of 10
","I would like to give this movie a 9, but I just can't quite pull the trigger. I liked it a lot. It had the advantage of being the type of movie (political thriller) that I prefer. I can also say that there was never a single moment that I thought about how long it was or what time it was or if it was almost over.However, I admit that I was close. I feel that they could easily have cut out 20 minutes and it would have been a better, tighter, more intense thriller. Also, I was turned off by Costner's poor attempt at a New England accent. Interestingly, it was much less obvious by the end of the film.But, it has one big advantage - the fact that it tells a true story. It is truly amazing how close we came. The fact that we can watch the story 40 years later with no fear of realizing the ramifications adds a unique level of interest and suspense. Overall, it was well worth the time.",8,0,0,31 December 2001
Gangs of New York," 7 on a scale of 10
","This is one gory movie. You better at least be able to tolerate it or don't see it.I give this film an extra point because it really educates me on what NYC was like 140 years ago. I actually had no idea. I'd swear I saw some of the sewer systems that they still have - not that I am critical of NYC, it's just that I wouldn't ever want to go back unless my life depended on it. Anyway, I digress.The acting was excellent and the story compelling. All that should add up to better than a 7, however I just can't get excited about a bunch of thugs in the 1800's. Everyone has their favorite genres. I can honestly say, that 1800 thugs is not one of mine.I imagine most everyone would appreciate this movie unless you just couldn't stand the violence. I always am willing to say that the time was worth it if it reveals something new to me - and this movie did.",7,0,0,1 September 2003
Gladiator," 7 on a scale of 10
","I enjoyed this movie for the most part. I went with 4 others. Three of them, like me rated it as a B- or about a 7. One of them liked it considerably more. But, based only on a popularity contest, a 7 is low as per this site. I had several problems with the movie.1) It was WAY too long as so many movies are nowadays. It ran about 2:30. It wasn't that it was boring, it is just that it could EASILY have been 1/2 hour shorter and it would have been better. It bordered on dragging almost throughout. There were a few exciting scenes, but even they were too long. Minus 1 point.2) The fights were less than spectacular. I was very impressed with the sets, dress and scale. It was truly an epic in that sense. However, the fights were weak. Compared to Zorro and Matrix, the fight scenes in this movie were low tech. Minus 1 point.3) I'm not a particular fan of sword movies to begin with. I prefer modern movies as opposed to period pieces. It has been my experience that women like these types of movies better then men. I'm a man. You do the math. Minus 1 point.",7,0,0,10 May 2000
High Fidelity," 8 on a scale of 10
","This movie had a lot going for it. I didn't dislike very much. I also didn't overly like a great deal. That means I rate it in the upper 7's, but rounded to an 8.John Cusak was quite good. I loved his two employees - especially the arrogant one. They were great and added tremendously to the story.The ex-girlfriends were all well played. Who wouldn't want to see Zeta Jones even if it was a relatively small part?Overall, it is a romantic comedy. Possibly a little harder edged than some and a little less on the feel-good romance angle that characterizes the genre, but ultimately, that is what it was. Usually, boy meets girl and they fall in love and live happily ever after. In this, boy loses girl and attempts to recapture her heart.",8,0,1,15 April 2000
