Scarface," Bears the unmistakable mark of Oliver Stone
","I would have left this masterpiece uncommented, but then I saw the trivia section. Supposedly the great Steven Spielberg sacrificed a precious day of his to come to the set and help direct a scene...he he...now that's funny.HELP? So let me picture that: Al Pacino is walking around the set, with his face painted to look Cuban, looking like a psychotic, discussing with Oliver Stone on who should get rough on who, De Palma shouting - 'Hey, Al, you lost a f**k-you there, before Tony Montana kills the guy...', and checking out the best angle to catch the blood-spill more dynamical...and there comes the father of extinct animals, with his tidy little outfit and little glasses, asking probably:-Hey, why is Tony swearing this much?...yep!, really couldn't have done this one without you, Stevie,... GIVE Us A BREAK and stick to your little figurines!",10,1,2,20 March 2006
Borat: Cultural Learnings of America for Make Benefit Glorious Nation of Kazakhstan," There is an early warning system now against all this
","Thank God for Youtube, because it's the equivalent of an early warning system for earthquakes. Now there's no need to pay for filth like this just for being curious. You can watch pretty much the whole movie, and decide if you want to further sponsor this garbage Cohen's future s**t.It's a snuff 'movie' which almost manages to kill humor and common sense but certainly was born brain dead much like its dull and insipid creator. Baron -I make Jewish jokes because I'm entitled, cause I am - Cohen is a truly 'complex' comedian. I mean he grows hair(so I read in his profile section) to transform into Ali or from Ali into Borat and the other moron he embodies...I mean, you have to give him that. He's so complex that he needs three persona to cast his smut over common sense. He makes fun of people for being poor, or uneducated, because he's so complex and fascinating and above all that. He breaks boundaries with his 'revolutionary' take on humor (scato-ethnic-slur-pointless-brain dead-simplistic and ignorant, but flashy type of humor) Well, I say let's open our minds to this genius, and let's all leave our rigid shells and go play along with him, and all his (real life) family of prostitutes, because -'is nice', right?",1,59,120,16 November 2006
In Bruges," Some of the stuff great cinema is made of
","Schubert's 'Der Leiermann' is the story of a man who lost everything he cared for, and which wanders to the cemetery on a cold winter day, laying down cold and giving in to depression, only to hear Death creeping up on him, playing it's obsessive song, and asks it to let him go with it.McDonogh's first full feature film, and only second directing effort creeps up on you, like a cold winter breeze. The narrative follows Schubert's song, and unfolds in a bitter comic undertone, as religious references to soul redemption unfold in the background intertwined with local cultural art exhibits. The characters develop individually within a confined time frame to eventually become an intricate part of the bigger picture, as for the acting Farell and Fiennes truly stand out. As for political correctness, well, let's just say it gets a well deserved kick in the a**. Yeah, they ARE filming midgets...in this one, at least.Loved it.",9,0,4,10 September 2008
The Big Lebowski," Stylish, hallucinating ride!
","It's difficult to describe a Coen brothers movie, because the thing that makes the distinct is the flavor, the atmosphere(like a stylish fairytale) and the characters, which are very atypical to movies in general, because they cannot be described as heroes, and also the original point of view and the use of music. This is the case of this tale of a bum bowler on drugs, Lebowski(Jeff Bridges), his two friends, an idiot (Steve Buscemi) and a troubled veteran (John Goodmann), who is confused for a millionaire and gets his rug pi**ed on by a gang of self proclaimed nihilists(Peter Stormare,Flea).A hallucinating story unfolds, with occasional musical black-outs(fantastic vision, 'What condition my condition is in') as he, aided by his idiot friends, tries to recover the rug from the millionaire, who in turn offers him a job, to find his young and slutty wife, a porn actress, allegedly kidnapped by the nihilists. As usual for Coen brother movies, acting is top notch. Along the way Lebowski meets the most interesting characters, the pederast bowler Jesus (brilliantly played by John Turturro), the porn movie producer (Ben Gazarra), the painter daughter of the millionaire Lebowski (Julianne Moore), and her crazy friend (David Thewlis), or the Stranger(Sam Elliott).The Coens have made some great movies in the past (Raising Arizona, Barton Fink, Fargo- to name but a few), but clearly they refined their craft to an art form with this one.",10,2,4,27 January 2006
Fight Club," Waking up just got to hurt!
","Palahniuk talks about the modern man who enslaves himself for all the wrong reasons. The story is a criticism on the consumer-driven world we are living in, about the ties in our lives which are mostly material, society, and about our dreams to one day say and do what we mean and want - it's about freedom and a way to achieve it, or at least rebel against the status quo. The movie is an introspection, and a close and cynical observation of the exterior world, where we stand in it, It's a glimpse into the reality of things. It's smart, and an eye opener.The movie itself is perhaps Fincher's best, dark, stylish and brutal. It made me want to punch certain aspects of my life in the face and in many ways changed the way I react to things. And by the way, has anyone else seen the multiple subliminal frames in which Tyler appears before he actually appears? - have you never almost seen him in your everyday life? Cause I have!",10,2,5,24 November 2005
The Irishman," Weak by any standard but by Scorsese it's very
","Sadly a sub-par effort from one of my all time favorite directors. The story is weak (by Scorsese standard) and overly stretched. I can understand the appeal to revisit his trademark Italian gangster genre one more time, but this one feels unnecessary. The also trademark Scorsese humor is in-existent (except for the painting walls bit). De Niro looks disoriented, in the worst physical (hunched over almost the whole movie) and acting shape ever and out of place. Not very surprising, either. He spent the better part of the last 15 to 20 years doing mock impressions of himself which after the novelty faded ended him up in a series of quite dubious productions. That's a very long time to lower the bar and obviously takes its toll.The De-aging technique is unconvincing when the actors move. Their faces look animated, fake. There is little and uninspired music. Keitel looks fantastic but is underused. Pacino kinda overacts on occasion. Pesci looks fantastic and is in top form acting-wise but he's also in a supporting role (he's the best part of the movie) so he doesn't have a big impact on the movie. Romano is in top form but his part is also small.The movie is slow, linear, extremely long, predictable (how often have we seen the Hoffa story on screen? a superior version starring Nicholson comes to mind) and dull. There isn't much going on action-wise. A lot of innuendo and he said they said, but aside some quite dull hit-jobs where de Niro is supposed to be in his prime but moves like a 75 year old the story is quite static. The dialog is stale. Stunts are weak to say the least (Pacino's double excessively hiding his face when he hits the floor in a fight and obviously wearing a wig and body padding, and the store owner more than obviously throwing himself through the window of the store while De Niro clumsily mimics hitting him around come to mind, rendering those scenes borderline laughable). Colors, interiors, costumes are all in shades of beige. Camera work is rigid. Plus the Hoffa story is old news to begin with, there are so many insane things going on right now and would translate better to the screen in 2019. The edgy fast paced crazy energy of the more recent Wolf of Wall Street (not to mention his earlier masterpieces Casino, Raging Bull, Taxi Driver, Mean Streets or Goodfellas etc) seems that of a different director.All in all the weakest film in Scorsese's portfolio and not above a 6 stars out of 10 by any standard (I'm inclined to be lenient mainly because he managed to bring Pesci out of retirement for this. But by Scorsese standard it's well below that). It's more of a self-indulgent piece of nostalgia best left unmentioned when it's all said and done. And I'm hopeful that Marty will surprise us with more of his best work in the future and we can sweep this one under the rug.",6,1262,2033,27 November 2019
The Fifth Element," A beautiful thing!
","There is a certain Luc Besson feel about this eye-candy you can also find in the 'Taxi' - series, 'Leon', 'Nikita' and others, that is distinct compared to the movies that are being produced in Hollywood in our days. The humor is quite distinct as it has a certain french/subtle/European sophistication, and story-wise his movies have a certain fill(complexity) you will not find in their American counterparts.The story unfolds fluently, even if not always realistic(not necessary in a sci-fi blockbuster)and the many complex story lines will converge to deliver the maximum effect(Besson has specialized in action movies, as a writer and as a director).Visually the movie has the same complex texture, beautiful set design, fantastic costumes designed by Jean Paul Gaultier and the extraordinary graphic designs of Dan Weil(production designer). Colours are lavishly displayed as the cinematic eye takes you on a visual feast, accompanied by an extraordinary soundtrack(a special mention to the techno-opera recital).Great supporting acting by Gary Oldman, Ian Holm and Chris Tucker.I only hope America will allow in a distant future the cultural diversity to be celebrated as here and not as it is choked in our days.",9,1,2,16 January 2006
Ocean's Twelve," I'm getting real tired of these Soderbergh arty yawners
","Yes, the arty, trembled camera-work we have seen to death in his movies, and yes, the slow-paced narrative and the colors. In addition to that, the bloated, lazy Hollywood aging bankable stars: Brad - not to mention any recent movie - Pitt, George - ever growing double chin(but making OK movies, still) - Clooney, Julia - lately transvestite look-alike Roberts, Matt - pig-face - Damon and ever plain and insipid Catherine Zeta Jones. No story, no point, except the 'behind the scenes' - buzz that the cast partied in Clooney's Italian residence which was the pretext for the whole movie, I believe. The only plus is Vincent Cassel, who is excellent as always, but even that cannot make up for the rest. I'm glad I ripped it off the internet and didn't stuff another 10 bucks for a ticket into these bloated guys pockets, because it would have made me regret it. Maybe the ever-growing internet piracy will water-down the exorbitant paychecks these wretched f**kers get just for doing what is increasingly NOTHING.",1,2,4,17 February 2006
Blade II," Sharp as the edge of the blade!
","Del Toro takes the Blade franchise to it's fulfillment. He creates the dark, brutal, terrifying, fascinating world the first movie has grazing missed (and the third one truly ruined), and creates one of the most dynamic action movies in cinema history, and one of the best comic-book adaptation for the big screen. The story is compact as the very well choreographed action scenes are complimented by the most recent filming techniques to create breathtaking action.Snipes delivers one of his last notable performances, and one of the best action of his career.Great supporting acting by Ron Perlman and Kris Kristofferson and a great soundtrack.Sharp",8,0,11,17 January 2006
The Town," Get off your high horses, guys...
","I've been reading a couple of reviews here, and was surprised, granted out of only 10 comments written to this moment, to see raving blabber on 'most complex heist movie since...', or 'Ben has proved that x movie was not a fluke', and even references to 'Good Will ..', and one even mentioned Oscar nominations. Obviously some of these people have been born only 10 years ago, or else they would recognize the botched rip-off of such heist movies as Point Break 1991, or more recently Heat 1995(which is a remake of a lesser version of itself LA Takedown 1989), to name but the most shamelessly plagiarized ones. So Ben didn't really dig too deep for inspiration. I will call it inspiration although a plagiarism law suit wouldn't come as a surprise to me in relation to The Town. I guess Ben saw himself as kind of a Mc Cauley-de Niro in Heat, Hamm would be Hanna-Pacino, Jeremy Renner a kind of Tom Sizemore-Cheritto, and Rebecca Hall-Amy Brenneman-Eady. I especially liked the phone conversation between Ben and her where she stands at the window with all police waiting and she gives him the sign, wink!,that she's under surveillance and he should split...(to use a bit of heist flick lingo, myself)Does it remind anyone of the scene where Ashley Judd gives Val Kilmer the sign that he should disappear, after the heist gone wrong? I guess not, for the time being.I won't even start with the gratuitous work-out scene where Ben shows us his six-pack...talk about gratuitous. Also, there are some f-word written to a small piece of paper jokes, the guys in the last row will laugh at for sure. Real brain puzzlers. Acting, on Ben's part is no surprise. He walks around frown-mouthed and thinks he is in character. Pityfull. Hamm does not have another persona outside Mad Men, and should stick to TV, in my opinion. Direction-I especially enjoyed the shaky close-up camera work during the action sequences, to create dynamism, no doubt Ben must have thought to himself. Altogether a plot-holes filled rip-off, and not a good one at that, either.Oh, and one more thing, why again did Bendoug have to go poking around Claire? To find out how much she knows? After the FBI had already questioned her? So he can attract more attention to himself? Well I guess by asking these questions the whole plot kind of unravels like a poorly woven 5 bucks sweater when you pull a loose thread...",2,166,314,17 September 2010
Cast Away," Heart-felt
","The movie is beautiful and heart-felt. Some have commented on the ending, but I believe it's perfect. Chuck Noland works for FedEx, is engaged, and generally leads a pretty normal life. This all changes, as the FedEx plane he was on crashes in the Pacific. He is the sole survivor, and has to adapt to a new life, cast away from civilization on a deserted island. The movie accentuates the physical and psychological hardship one must go thru in order to adapt to a new life, in this case in communion with nature. The FedEx executive undergoes a transformation, passing thru the suicidal, angry and finally resignation stage, and adapts in order to survive, but cannot leave his social ties fully behind, so he creates a friend out of a volley-ball, Wilson(I found this friendship to be very touching), hangs on to the picture of his fiancé, and, most important, perhaps, in order not to go insane, and have something to live for, keeps a package in order to deliver it someday. This element is very important, because at the end it becomes everything that drives him (his fiancé married another instead, as he was presumed dead), all purpose in life, if you will, and this is why the movie ends with him at a crossroad, disoriented, because he didn't dare think he would come so far, and didn't plan anything past delivering the package. He is now in the same place where he was when the plane crashed, he has to adapt...",9,1,2,11 April 2006
The Thing," Still love it!
","Loved it from the get-go. Remote scientific base in Antarctica. Winter. Beautiful snow landscapes. A team of Norwegian scientists is chasing a dog to kill it. The Americans save the dog and bring doom on themselves, because the dog carries the Thing.The place becomes more and more claustrophobic as suspicion they are infected arises between team members. The music of Enio Morricone, adding to the suspense. Kurt Russel does what he does best, Keith David is brilliant as always. The monster looks extremely realistic, considering it was made in '82.Those who liked the Alien series, will like this one, too. For me, growing up with it, it's like one of my favorite toys from childhood, it feels like home.",10,0,1,10 April 2006
The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo," What a jip...the story, characters, and altogether movie experience
","Blabber about the Swedish versus US version, standing in line, all that hype. I manage to squeeze myself and my girlfriend in one of the smaller theaters in the city, as the large ones have been under assault since the beginning of the phenomenon. Movie starts, they start speaking English with a reverential accent toward the European and Nordic chef d'oeuvre. The enumeration of Swedish cities starts, just to state that this is not an attempt to dampen the color and depth of the original masterpiece. We meet the male lead David, who just got his arse handed over from Goliath. Needs to get away from the hassle. Lick the wounds. No cliché there. I notice a wall light is not working along the narrow hall way in the theater. Pretentious introductions of the very special family follow. Just like in a wrestling event we are being introduced with all the participants and prepared just for how twisted and awful they are. Then more stalling. More landscape. This is where I first look around and notice the led lights around the steps. I start finding them fascinating. I'm thinking about going out to smoke a cigarette. I remember, I don't smoke. DAMN!No doubt the light must affect the psyché of people in a Nordic country, I'm thinking. Let's see the monsters now. There's the rapist, but most importantly the only character in this story who ever outsmarts punky girl in a supposedly smart thriller, because from now on it's mission impossible for her. She turns into bike-hacker extraordinaire. Back to the storyline. More landscape and sterile interior design. The end.Just kidding, I purposely left the most important aspect for last. The cat and mouse game with the killa. There's a cat in the movie, does that count? No mouse. No game. The killa...what's special about him? The actor is actually Swedish. Hmm, just another layer to the story, better said trivia section. I remember I forgot to buy a bottle of wine for this evening. DAMN!Next: Punky beats Goliath Jane Bond style, THE END. Or is it? I remember, it's a trilogy, DAMN!You think my comment was long? Try watching the movie. You'll wish you were in attendance at an insurance seminar. At least there you would have a window to look out of.",1,45,82,26 January 2012
Dark City," Film noir meets sci-fi
","I don't feel the need to compare this to the Matrix, because it's a movie with its own distinct voice, and most important without the moralizing intentions or the unreal pure black or white characters. If I were to compare them, on the other hand, a great difference would be that Dark City is a film noir mystery thriller, and the supra natural element only intervenes as an accent, and not as a purpose, because practically the only sci-fi element is the graphic representation of the mental power of the Strangers, and the resulting changes in the scenery, which are important plot points. It's clear that there has been a bit of espionage involved, and I don't know who stole the idea from whom, but out of this came two distinct movies, each offering an ultimately different spin on the same core. Betweent the two, I choose Dark City, for the more human approach, the impressive set design, the original vision (a sci-fi story set in a 50's film noir atmosphere is intriguing), the cast (Rufus Sewell is a much more expressive actor than Keanu Reeves)and total lack of gratuitous display of violence in order to entertain.",9,2,4,16 March 2006
The Machinist," Disturbing imagery
","Regarded as a work of art, without any point of reference it's a good film with an interesting topic with some disturbing imagery and stylistic elements. Christian Bale brings final proof to me that he's a force to be reckoned with, an actor who will go to unbelievable great lengths to serve his art, and reminded me of the young De Niro. Aitana Sanchez Gijon is always a pleasure to watch, Jennifer Jason Leigh and Michael Ironside deliver great as well.However taking originality and the time period it was created in account one cannot avoid comparing it to previously released movies(for the single, distorted point of view, including imaginary characters and rearranged elements to fit a tortured mind searching for relief) like Memento, Fight Club, Angel Heart-to name just a few. Also for those who have the exercise in decoding the prolific in the last 50 years 'final twist'-genre(reminiscent Hitchcock-elements are visible, like the empty streets, absence of score and absence of true color), the movie will reveal it's secrets a bit earlier than intended.",9,6,10,5 June 2006
Aliens," Brilliant film-making
","Claustrophobic and dark and also action-pumped, this sequel manages to beautifully stand on its own but also compliment on the first movie. It's only natural that in order to evolve you have to reinvent but not miss out on the mystique, the soul of the movie, which is preserved perfectly in this one, as it is in all 4 Alien movies. Actually the Alien series viewed as a whole is like a work of art on its own, and all 4 compliment on each other, although being also significant different and similar, none of them repeating itself. Also you don't have to be too familiar with the previous movie in order to understand what's going on in each of them. Whoever had this fact in sight really did a great job. I believe maybe this one remains my favorite, beside Bill Paxton being cast in it, for benefiting of being made in the 80's, regarding complimenting a great idea/ story with perfect special effects, in this case the alien which couldn't look more real. I think regarding sci-fi this was the most interesting decade, because it benefited of altogether richer story/special effects ratio than recent films where pyrotechnics and special effects seem to be the only interest of producers. It was the melting-point of two movie making schools which created quite some timeless classics.",8,4,6,3 March 2006
Hardball," The hollow man
","It's a common assumption that Keanu is stupid. This comes from his acting, when it's not about portraying a drug addict('I love you to death') or a plain stupid guy('Bill and Ted's bogus journey'), where he fits perfectly. However, after a closer look, and after reading some of his personal quotes, I discovered that stupid is not what he is, probably, because he has a pretty interesting insight on life, and that is very uncommon for people who have achieved fame and wealth at an early age. The money certainly didn't spoil Keanu. The problem is, as in this movie, where he tries to portray a compulsive gambler, and fails, that he is definitely not gifted as an actor. He looks like an actor, but doesn't manage to transcend his feelings to the screen. The biggest flaw, though, is, that like Tom Cruise, he has absolutely no smoothness. He's like a brick.Thus, the rough, hollow , always the same interpretation in all his movies.What leaves to be enjoyed in this movie, are the kids, which are great, and the somewhat touching story.",5,2,3,4 April 2006
Tigerland," Extraordinary documentary style character study with the Vietnam war in background
","Really touching story of a recruitment camp in America, where young men are prepared for the Vietnam war. The human study always appealed to me when it comes to war movies, because it translates personal, subjective opinions on war, opposed war action movies where action, and technical data are being analyzed to the prejudice of the human factor. The movie manages to put a new spin on an already ancient subject, and manages to distance itself from usual war movies, especially by focusing on an anti-hero from the view-point of traditional standard. The movie focuses on the tragic character of Bozz, who smartly avoids being sucked in by the dehumanizing war machine, and refuses to give up control over his destiny and fight for something he doesn't believe in, spends his energy in searching ways to avoid being sent overseas, both for himself and comrades and ironically ends up finding his own just reason for finally going to war. Perfect irony.The acting is truly exceptional, and the documentary-style shooting almost makes you feel transposed into the movie. Also the movie will provide food for thought for those exhilarated by the action in usual war movies or war-games enthusiasts, hopefully awakening some minds of a generation which luckily escaped the terror of being drafted.",10,4,8,11 December 2006
Batman Begins," Not only for Batman comics fans
","This is without any doubt the most complex adaptation of a comic book for the big screen. Not only it's a translation of the spirit of Batman comic books, but it's in fact the meticulously constructed psychological transformation of Bruce Wayne into Batman. All the previous cinematic adaptations have only brought a sense of masquerade (in the case of the two Tim Burton, with Michael Keaton as Batman, the intended purpose was sustained 100% by the result, but the Joel Schumacher sequels are diluted and incoherent, despite the use of some Hollywood greatly talented stars, like Jim Carrey, Tommy Lee Jones or Uma Thurman), while this turns Batman into a respectable and complex character. This is mostly due to the talented Christopher Nolan, who has also previously proved to be a man with a distinct vision (Memento), and Christian Bale, who has proved to be the best choice for the tormented young Bruce Wayne. A solid story and a supporting cast line-up of prestigious actors like Michael Caine, Gary Oldman, Morgan Freeman, Liam Neeson and Rutger Hauer, with the talented new-comer Cillian Murphy, concurred to create quite a masterpiece.",10,2,2,14 March 2006
Hero," Beautiful martial arts epic
","Easily one of the most beautiful slide-show of Chinese landscapes, combined with astonishing martial arts scenes, where the parties involved are defying gravity, fight-dancing thru the air, and walking on water. The movie was surely made out of love for martial arts, as it takes them to another dimension, where sword-fights are a form of poetic expression, and the fighters are in communion with the elements of nature. Storywise it's not complex, the story revolving around the Hero and a love triangle involved in the killing of the King. Clearly Asians have developed a taste for the dramatic, as the characters seem as always a bit linear in their anger, climaxing with those typical stand-offs. Expect the typical Asian freeze-up and frowned expression when displaying dramatic undertone, also seen in Manga animation, with the impenetrable face expression, and seemingly endless staring, but leaving out the usual martial arts movie plot with adjacent characters (the usual crazy, lazy or drunken challengers) transcend the action-movie genre, and create a somewhat stretched, but nevertheless beautiful Chinese history epic.",8,0,0,1 March 2006
Garden State," Had at least one moment
","Plot keywords: dysfunctional family, coming home...well, that's about enough to get my attention when it comes to a movie. Beside the obvious reason for enjoying this let's call it genre, I have noticed that this is one of the very few subjects where almost no compromise is being made on the art, because it doesn't pay, commercially. I read some of the comments on this one, and, although I enjoyed it a lot, I have to say it's not quite all that. First, every generation identifies with some rebellious statement in art, although further in life one might notice that the substance of rebellion is pretty much the same regardless of generation, and second, this one, aside a brilliant moment of 'pure originality', is not all that original as a whole. The movie relies on atmosphere, thus the title, but somehow avoids going any deeper.On the upside, there is an enough subtle positive message to have made me smile on occasion. Braf proves much more versatile behind camera than in front. Ian Holm. And Natalie Portman.For whom enjoyed this one, I recommend two titles which I believe have a bit more substance: 'Home for the Holidays', with Holly Hunter, and 'Beautiful Girls', with Timothy Hutton and coincidently Natalie Portman, which have been made more than a decade ago, but haven't lost their universal validity.",9,0,1,21 December 2007
Kill Bill: Vol. 1," This is the end, my friend!
","Well, as I predicted Quentin finally made a fool of himself, as he tried to resurrect from the ashes making the - in his own mind - ultimate action movie. He kind of invented a certain spoof/action/violence/witty dialog/heavy artillery movie genre(kind of because in reality he remains forever in debt to pioneers like Scorsese and the Hong Kong-action movie makers which he remixed into a seemingly brilliant farce-kind of movie-film-making style), and then pursues this approach to absolute death, because as everyone can observe Quentin's productions kept diluting themselves of substance until they finally dried up to become this pathetic and uninspired crappy Hong Kong action movies rip-off/soap-opera with uninspired dialog and shitty action.It's actually sad to watch Quentin's cinematic free-fall, especially after his somehow significant contribution to modern cinema, mostly in a screenwriter capacity(Natural Born Killers, True Romance) in his early years, but as it looks he just has nothing more to say.What's next, 'Pulp Fiction 2'? 'Pulp Fiction 3'?Perhaps it's about time to think about early retirement, Quentin!",1,7,12,10 January 2006
Jerry Maguire," The additional points are for Cuba Gooding
","Yet another miss by exuberant with no apparent reason Tom, as acting is concerned. I mean to take acting lessons for this, and then to give the awkward ridiculous performance, with the icing on the cake being the 'did you think that I was gonna flip out' -scene, with those exaggerated gestures and ridiculously stare expression on his face, meant to portray grief, or constipation, couldn't get it. With the brilliant performance of Cuba Gooding which casts an enormous shadow on the either flat or exaggerated interpretation of Tom, the nice interpretation of Renee Zellweger, and the kid even. I mean Tom Cruise should stick to the big productions, one man show, he likes so much, because without a point of reference nearby, it's easier not to be put in a bad light, as in this one.

The Adjustment Bureau," Bhuu-ahahahahahaha!
","Until yesterday when I wasted 2 hours of my life I was totally unaware of this Nolfi fellow. The Sentinel, Oceans 95210's, Bourne Ultimatum...Well, all of these would have served me as a fair warning, but I was oblivious. Shame on me, because I had seen them all, and the man has absolutely no clue about what he's writing about. Paper thin characters, ludicrous story, and laughable cardboard cliché dialog. Sample: 'All I have are the choices I make, and I choose her, come what may.' Well, Tarantino's certainly got nothing on you, Nolfi...For those who are not familiar with Nolfi's oeuvre, here making his unfortunate directorial debut, expect a simple plot, no surprises, nothing new, nothing deep, nothing funny, no new filming technique, a fair insipid Damon, a fair Blunt, no chemistry whatsoever, no opportunity for chemistry whatsoever, a tired and apathetic Stamp, and a ludicrously adapted K.Dick story, some basic elements borrowed from 'Dark City' 1998(men in hats which adjust us while we sleep), and 'The Lost Room' 2006(doors which lead to far places) which unfolds like a soap opera episode of The Young and the Restless. Expect an uninspired soundtrack, and no twist. Yeah, that's right, there is no twist. And expect John Slattery with all the wardrobe from Mad Men. I guess with the recession and all, they thought of a way to keep the suits in rotation to maximize rentability. In a nutshell, expect no reason to remain seated and continue watching.Pff, I'm not even having fun dissing it...Avoid like bird crap on a blue obnoxious hat...Bo-riiiing! Nolfi, noted.

Once Upon a Time in America," It's about the difference between the view in and the view out of life
","Humans might have developed the ability to speak, but our language is so poor when it comes to speak from the depths of our beings. It's being said that a look can speak a thousand words. Art can be a much more effective communication tool than language. Sometimes you can read the artists eyes to understand his vision. That's the case here. The story of a poor kid growing up on the downside of advantage who takes the road to perdition not because he chooses wrong but because any road out of there would have been equally doomed to fail morally, achieves epic proportions when it transcends the genre to become a dissection of modern human society, a story about growing up, a gangster tale, a love story and an initiation trip on the downward spiral of memory lane direction purgatory. The story follows Noodle's reflections, from childhood to old age, revealing piece by piece what can be viewed as a failed life, or an immoral one, but really is a tale of broken dreams and promises to self and others, success and downside of it, fate, love and friendship, but most of all it shows the great difference between the view in and the view out of life.",10,1,4,23 June 2006

Inside Man," Spike had me at hello and lost me at goodbye, as usual
","The movie opens with Dalton Russel's alert announcement that sets the mood for a smart action-thriller, completely atypical for Spike Lee's films. Spike usually makes meticulous constructed insights into the human mind and social habits(usually afro-American), and not action-thrillers, like this. In fact the movie opens as such, and gradually returns to the roots of Spike's cinematic vision, the human study, only this time more multi-racial in approach, with some new camera moves he picked up. The subject is simple, disguised as complex: a gang of bank-robbers takes over the bank of Arthur Case( Plummer), and holds everybody hostage, as they wait, and wait, and wait, because it's not the money they are after. The Police sends a negotiator(Washington), with a questionable past, and somewhere in there you'll recognize versatile actor Willem Dafoe playing a diluted character ,who adds nothing to the story, and Jodie Foster, who plays a mystery-lady, rich guy's problem solving extraordinaire, also diluted. It becomes clear that billionaire Case has a secret hidden in the Bank. This is where the pace of the movie slows down, and also until it's entertaining. What it is, everybody can easily guess-Case has a Nazi past. Well, really original, keeping those 'dear reminders' from the past in a simple deposit box, big-shot that he is. So the robbers stay in there for hours waiting for what, to finally come out disguised as hostages??? And they stop the cameras, but there's also previous footage, and Police could identify everybody in the Bank prior to the attack. Finally our sense of justice is gratified(and this is where it becomes lame), and the evil, evil billionaire will face retribution-Bad, bad Nazi! Not remotely as smart as it advertises, it falls flat on the nose, as the 'smart' guys turn out to be plain, and the script a draft. Not to mention the cheap preaching.",5,4,8,21 April 2006
The Da Vinci Code," Quelle salade...
","I didn't read the book, and suspected it's a shameless exploitation of Da Vinci's name in order to cash in. That it is.It spins on the premise that Da Vinci had a special insight on the fact that Jesus and Maria Magdalena had offspring and that there's a bloodline running to our days. This has been matter of dispute between conspiracy theorists for quite some time. The fact is that Dan Brown exploits the controversy to create a dull and predictable, filled with laughable historic references no-brainer, not that I agree with official history(to those mildly interested in history it's not a secret that the Vatican is an organization that exerts religious power in order to control, and that Christianity is in fact a mix of religious concepts that entered Europe from the Middle East which put under just small scrutiny will reveal it's flaws). Also odd enough it doesn't mention the relation between Freemasonry and the symbolic shallowly depicted(five pointed stars, Star of David and most of all Rosslyn Chapel), but what could one expect from a mediocre fact-fiction salad eye-opener wannabe .From the credibility point of view it reminded me of Hudson Hawk with Bruce Willis-about two insane billionaires on the quest for a gold machine presumable invented by Da Vinci. But that was an entertaining comedy with witty, funny dialog and most of all done in good taste. This crap disguised behind Da Vinci's name is Dan Browns greasy hand stuck into your pocket to get your money. SAVE YOUR MONEY(goes for the book, too), and if still curious catch this clock-watcher on cable in a year for a quick laugh before you switch to the news. Better yet, rent Hudson Hawk, at least you'll be entertained.",1,3,8,22 May 2006
Mr. & Mrs. Smith," I haven't seen it and want to comment on it

The Departed," It's tough to live up to the name
","The movie takes off a bit slow and leaves certain question marks regarding the 'face-off'(by John Woo) kind of premise, which doesn't only appear far-fetched but also a bit childish, and even if it were true somehow has a comic-book feel about it. When one comes to terms with this there still remain some other plot-points insufficiently explained, like how come both of them are so successfully quick in infiltrating the structure. We are barely shown an interview both undergo which subsequently sets the premise for the cat & mouse game, but therein would have been the chance to transcend the action-genre. Comparison to, let's say Donnie Brasco, for example, would be unfair to the latter. In stead we suddenly find out that 30 minutes into the movie Di Caprio's character has already been one year undercover, and vice-versa. Character development is insufficient by Scorsese standards, and dialog is a bit wooden, proving that the Irish mafia is not quite up Scorsese's alley.This is not a usual Scorsese movie. It's an action movie with some scars moments reminding of Scorsese trade-marks, like music, violence and camera movement. Attention to detail, and that is what sets Scorsese apart from others, is shallow, in stead numerous close-ups are being used to distract. This movie is NOT Scorsese's masterpiece, and I'm sure time will bury it somewhere underneath the likes of Goofellas, Raging Bull, Taxi Driver, Gangs of New York, Casino, The King of Comedy or Mean Streets, and this for a simple reason, the standard is set extremely high for S., and honestly this one is a bit self-indulgent and shallow.However, taken by action-movie standards, it's above average, and there are some small treats for the fans of all the great cast involved, especially Di Caprio, who has studied De Niro's facial expressions lately, Alec Baldwin, and Mark Wahlberg. Also I was pleased to see that S. didn't sell out on the ending, which scores some big points with me. It's not a must see for Scorsese fans, but it doesn't disappoint either.",8,1,3,20 November 2006
War of the Worlds," Tommy and Stevie 'strike' again!
","Put these two 'greats' together and you can only get a soup of uncertain artificial taste, and I mean also their previous movie 'Minority Report'.Spielberg must clinically be suffering from a Peter Pan complex, or otherwise have a childhood fixation, as all his movies revolve around a big unreal toy.Be it a silly looking alien or the big dinosaurs, the big shark or ship or a future sterile high-tech desensitized world, or the big alien tripods, or any unreal element, all his movies totally lack the feel of reality. Spielberg always relies on that effect the first glimpse of the oddity he uses as a central element has on the audience, and then spins this element on display so all angles finally have been exposed, and the latest special effects techniques have been used(this is why children like his movies). This is all, no real emotions are being explored, or any real dramas unfold(with a few exceptions like 'Schindler's List', which in my opinion are also pretty surreal in the sense that they rely only on the visual).Who better could he find to portray his hollow fairytale than Tom Cruise, the least talented overpaid actor in Hollywood.The actor who after 15 years of 'acting' goes and takes acting lessons probably hoping that he will be awarded an Oscar, because the small sterile walking Razzie has an ego the size of a dinosaur.I'm sure these two will give us more reasons for a headache in the future, as they clearly just discovered the taste of each other.Also I'm sure that they will be responsible for some of the most expensive productions in the future, to make sure that at least cost-wise they made the biggest something.Condoleances to Dakota Fanning and Tim Robbins(and other true actors who associated themselves during the years with Stevie only to cash in), who really don't deserve this 'select' company. No matter how bright Steve and Tom light up the screen technically, the real world looks increasingly sad with the likes of them on the steering wheel of the American movie industry.",1,0,0,12 January 2006
Lord of War," The human comedy
","The movie feeds on the contradictory qualities which put together make us human, and dares documenting in a funny way. It's one of the most beautiful movies about the ugliest aspects of life.It's a cynical, powerful, fast paced, ironical, sometimes comic, and very graphical account of the rise and rise of an arms dealer, who takes advantage of the most unbelievable loop-holes history itself seems to deliver to those who are prepared to do anything for a buck. The story of a Ucrainean who's parents went to America after WW 2, pretending to be Jewish(because 'the 50's were one of the few moments in history when it was an advantage to be Jewish'), grows up in the poor neighborhood Little Odessa, and who ultimately wants to do something big in his life, immoral being no object. The movie doesn't tell us something new, but the point of view is indeed original, because it doesn't condemn the Lord of War, doesn 't condemn war, genocide, but instead gives us a pretty clear image of the ugly truth we live in. So, make up your own mind, and draw your own conclusions...because that's not going to change anything, anyway.",10,1,3,13 March 2006
The Shawshank Redemption," Beautiful
","It's been often said that the screen is merely one mm thick. The reference is made a bit condescending to the depth of the cinematic experience, perhaps at the time cinema was a novelty which, as a medium, told a story more facile than literature.I don't believe in the long way of achieving anything. That's why the story, unfolding over more than 20 years, paradoxically told in an hour and a half, in a manner which manages to express some of the most intimate experiences to being human, somehow ending up achieving epic proportions, truly became one of my all - time favorite in depth studies of the human spirit. And this due to a simple artifice in delivering the story, which probably is King's merit, but which has been perfectly transfered to celluloid, the one quality, perhaps, separating humans from the rest of living beings - hope, used as an incentive.As we gradually discover the humanity behind some of societies renegades, we also discover that true beauty of life lies in true redemption of the soul thru passion, the character of Andy Dufresne therefor achieving almost mythical proportions amongst inmates, because Andy is a man who cannot live without a project, without creating. He becomes a symbol for endurance, hope and redemption, but also of intangibility, because the path of the righteous is not only the path of the lonely, but also the most difficult, and thru a wicked twist of fate, he goes through purgatory almost like a biblical character. Truly a human experience that shows how a man can master a destiny which seems impossible to accept, and would most probably break most.'Some birds are not meant to be caged...their feathers are just too bright'",10,0,0,13 January 2008
Parasite," Very powerful social satire
","This genre transcending movie is a rare achievement in capturing the disparity in our global civilization as well as the clash of contrasting mindsets.A destitute family of four gradually inserts itself in the life of an upper class home in order to profit financially. At first things seem to go their way and the movie maintains a playfully comical tone but soon they must realize just how far apart their world is from that of their mark. The gap is insurmountable. The fun is over.The movie is no socialist propaganda. It's a brutally painted picture of class dynamic in society. Any human society. Be it past present or future. Things will never change because to have top people there must be bottom people. And in the underbelly of every nicely polished place an underground torrent of resentment builds up in silence in the hearts of the servants. Until a simple ill gesture of the master class makes it suddenly erupt. In this case it was the master holding his nose in disgust at the driver's damp clothes stink after he spent the last 24 hours salvaging his few belongings from his flooded home and sleeping on the floor of a refuge while currently holding his deadly wounded daughter in his arms. When all hope is lost the clash is unavoidable (valid also in the case of the other 'parasite' family).While the weak (characters) cling to naive hope to the very end, the movie remains satirical, visceral and poignant but mostly intransigent offering no solution because there can't be any. On might call the family parasites or disenchanted survivors depending on the view point.",10,17,26,22 September 2019
Prometheus," Tail spin into the ridiculous for Ridley
","Gee, I seriously fear for the up-coming Blade Runner 2, now. I get that it's all about the money these days, that he has to squeeze as much 3D technology possible inside his product, however ludicrous and unnecessary it may be, because they finally decided that for future marketing purposes tinsel is all that the younger generation should be accustomed to (like the control deck hologram meant only to tingle our retina, because for practical reasons it couldn't possibly have been made), and I get that they hire soap opera level writers because they're less expensive (and thus expose the public to sub par story writing, where all logic goes down the drain to the benefit of forced tension), but what I don't get is why it had to dirt-splash the Alien series. I can already see this topping the Alien Blu Ray 5-pack.Now on the unintentional comedy:1 Somehow they found the oldest cave paintings in Scotland and not the middle East where we had the oldest civilization.2 The drawings are so complex that they have to superpose them to show us that they are the same.3 Our creators didn't write much nor did they like math, they preferred to dribble little men pointing up. They invite us just to play a prank on us. When they have the chance to explain their actions they instantly turn Hulk Hogan on us.4 Robots are more unpredictable that humans, and also act better.5 Even in the 2090's explorers will split up like second graders on a school trip.6 They send a team of humans when they have the technology to send robots which do not tire or get sick.7 Our creators don't have robots to wake up their last sleeping beauty.8 Our creators fly in dough nuts very effectively designed for rolling and squishing morons.9 The crew has no weaponry on board except a flame thrower.10 Gravitation is coincidentally the same as on Earth but our genetic identical creators are 2 times bigger and stronger even woken up from hyper sleep.11 Future scientists like surprise parties which involve at least 4 years of their lives.12 They cannot operate females mechanically on board of the ship, but they send them on missions nevertheless because the machine is easy to fool and override from the inside control panel.13 They have machines that can read our own kind's thoughts but not those of our creators 100% identical to us, but still designed like Renault Twizy. They don't even try to read our creator's thoughts.14 Our creator's ships are quite easy to steer. Even by a non pilot scientist seriously injured and with an infected wound.Oh, and the master-mind old man routine they flat out lifted from John Hurt's character in 'Contact'-1997. Plus we do not create robots because we can, but to work for us as loyal servants.To those who liked Alien 2, I suggest seeing the much idiotic, but extremely fun Guy Pearce vehicle 'Lockout' 2012.Time to cut your losses and call it quits, Rid.

Halloween," You'll be seeing Michael forever lurking in the dark corner of your room!
","The most terrifying 'face' of evil is no face at all, and in this case the few explanations about Michael Myers's motives only add to the tension. Of course the movie does not appear as scary as today's visual effects-filled teen slasher movies, which only aim to give you a quick scare but fail to leave any real mark in your psyche. The obsessive music composed by Carpenter himself will stay buried in your mind long after you have left the theater.The movie is structured exactly like a real nightmare, where you only have to put the right ingredients and then your psyche will do the rest making sure you wake up in a cold sweat...You have to consider the fact that Carpenter leaves everything pretty much to your imagination, as he just gives you a hint(the masked Myers, the terrified Loomis and the frightened Laurie) and then pretty much obsessively plays the tune that will leave a scar in your mind forever.<ul><li>'Evil, pure evil!'</li></ul>",10,4,5,29 November 2005
Blow," Fits well generally but lacks something
","Beautiful crafted movie. The soundtrack including 60's and 70' rock music and vintage looking, expressive visuals reminded me, keeping the reference scale in mind, of such classic gangster epic as Once Upon a time in America, Goodfellas or even Scarface. Demme's film looks as if it were made 20 years earlier, and I'm sure it's what he intended. The first person narrative works like a charm. Ray Liotta, one of my favorites delivers brilliantly as the hard working, loving father(the father-son relationship is touching indeed) little man crushed by the system. Penelope Cruz is beautiful and temperamental as we have come to expect. The only aspect short of brilliant is Depp's acting. While being an interesting actor, who generally fits very well in the movies he chooses to appear in(this one included), and clearly has the best agent in the world, judging by his roles in the last 15 years, he doesn't have sufficient dramatic power to carry a part like this quite all the way(like Liotta did in Goodfellas, for example). Also it lacks memorable quotes altogether, which is a negative trade when it comes to movies of this sort(and is one more reason this movie couldn't achieve greatness). Nonetheless it's a very well crafted drug-lord rise and fall epic.",8,0,1,11 May 2006
The Silence of the Lambs," First principles - Simplicity
","The brilliance of this novel/film truly lies in simplicity. Simplicity in deflecting. The plot itself is actually very simple: The FBI is on the hunt for the latest serial Killer Buffalo Bill and sends a trainee to gather information from the most valuable prisoner the Bureau possesses-Dr Lecter. Up until this point pretty simple, but this is the point where the magic begins, because from now on, although incarcerated, the cannibal Lecter, will orchestrate the whole show to suit his purpose - escaping, but also indulging in a deadly sharp mind-game with Clarice. I was watching the movie again some days ago, and somebody raised the question: how did Lecter get Dr. Chilton's pen, in his cell, while he was in a straight jacket? The brilliance lay in the fact that they never show us. It remains a mystery. Maybe a hint lay in the horrific image of the hanged angel, skinned policeman. Why do that, if not to distract from the simple yet cunning escape plan? After multiple viewings you will notice that Lecter runs the whole show, and Clarice, like all others involved are just subjects on Dr. Lecter's couch, but watching this movie 15 years later, knowing the outcome and every little trick, one must marvel at it's brilliance and style in using smoke and mirrors.",10,0,0,4 December 2006
Heat," Astonishing cops and robbers tale
","Never have I seen L.A. look so cold and empty. The choice of music is superb as Mann depicts this self-sufficient city through a cold blue lens and a passion for detail I have rarely seen and creates one of the most complex character-study of cops and robbers ever to hit the big screen(incomparable to the original version which is not more than an action flick). The bold three hour marathon (a box-office draw-back) featuring a line-up of numerous character actors follows a web of numerous narratives(following not only the two leads, but also Neils crew: Chris, Michael, Trejo and traitor Waingro) in great detail rendering an extremely vivid picture of Hanna's relationship towards his job, life(deliberately placed second), colleagues, wife Justine, step-daughter and mainly McCauley, the man he's chasing after, but genuinely respects as a professional. Neil McCauley's perspective is equally consistent in depicting his relationship towards his co-workers(deliberately called that, for in fact they are true friends respecting and trusting one another 100%) and trade of choice, which he does with an obsessive attention for detail and a devotion that finally will even suppress his conservation instinct and feelings for Eady. The act of treason is depicted in rare realism and typological diversity, each shown for what it truly stands for and all involved condemned for breaking the code of honor, to which the two leads truly live and die by. Waingro-the psychotic serial killer who would sell anyone for a buck, Van Zant-the coward white-collar criminal, Alan Marciano- the sleaze ball two-timing snitch, Trejo- the true friend who succumbs to torture, and not at least Justine, for the chosen method of resolution with Vincent(these are but a few). The moment of the heist is truly impressive for its complexity and dynamics. The attention to detail is razor sharp, as it presents a truly real-life outcome, leaving the final confrontation secluded and private between two hunters that share the same values but are on opposite sides.",10,2,4,19 May 2006
Star Wars: Episode IV - A New Hope," Grow up, already!!!
","I am not going to comment on what this simplistic view on good and bad, space soap-opera saga represents to kids, but on what a hysteria it stirs among seemingly normal adults. Seemingly, because when you approach 40 and still get that sparkle in your eye talking about the dark side of the force or Death Star, you might consider getting your head examined. I think the 'are you a Star Wars fan?' question should be asked on job interviews, because an affirmative answer is going to pretty much give you an idea on the maturity level of the applicant. -'Well, I'm an ambitious and hard working professional, I've been trained at blah-blah,...no, I don't have any children...Oh, and my friends at the Star Wars fan club call me Solo, because I kind of look like him...' - OK, that would be all...And one more thing - girls love to hear the deep and wise Yoda and Emperor quotes, too.

A Walk to Remember," Liked it
","There are certain movie genres that traditionally don't attract me at all. Love movies usually aim to make the women identify with the female lead, and let's face it, are meant to squeeze a few tears. The story is always a little too dramatic, and you'll come to expect the stereotypes of betrayal, impossible love or tragic death. 'Love Story' is perhaps the perfect example for this, and I believed a 'cheesy' romance will never make me turn from my usual routine. I was wrong. This movie, which owes much to 'Love Story', and features teen pop-singer Mandy Moore(whose music I never listen to), virtually without any acting experience, of course guided by the script, gives life to this pure, smart, integer and delicately feminine high-school girl who mesmerized me with her stoic attitude towards destiny, and made me watch the entire movie.

","Supposedly based on actual events, the movie follows Chris road to success, beginning with him laying beat up on the floor of life, and up to his unbelievable challenge to the title, and finally his victory. The Underdog story, it seems, remains one of modern culture's most treasured dreams to cling on, in the face of uncertainty and class system, man is left with glancing at idols, and dreaming of unrealistic schemes and turn of events that would catapult him into social stratosphere.Here's the latest, in which a true story of hardship, but also chance, is being transformed, with aid of puppy eyes Smith, into a wannabe inspirational tale of self made success. But a miracle is an improbable exception which underlines the impossibility of it occurring. In an age of religion loss, here comes a new belief: we can all become millionaires, but most of all, we should all dream of that. And by doing so, we can empathize with the main character. By sharing his hopes and dreams. Oh, what an emotional ride that will be...",Null,1,3,13 November 2008
Goodfellas," Quintessential Scorsese
","An absolute point of reference in Scorsese's work, one of the most plastic, colorful and violent gangster-saga ever told. Some of the best character-study of Scorsese's career, alongside Taxi Driver, Raging Bull or Casino(clearly an annotation on Goodfellas, but nonetheless brilliant, too), to name but a few. Teaming up once again with long time friend De Niro and Pesci, and versatile Liotta(his first person narrative, a Scorsese trademark, is one of the best i've ever seen) he delivers THE gangster movie of the 90's. The story of a kid who just wants to become a gangster, teams up with the meanest fellas in the neighborhood, and goes on to lead a life of crime and excess, and ultimately pays the price.Joe Pesci is truly on top of his game in this one, almost stealing the show, and creating the best almost likable ruthless and funny bad-guy ever seen on screen('What the f**k is so funny about me ???'-bit is priceless).As long as the likes of Spielberg, Lucas and Clint Eastwood will continue to be awarded Oscars, I hope that Scorsese will never be a part of that charade and just continue to not compromise, because he's clearly in a league of his own.",10,0,1,11 May 2006
