Hereditary," It was all in the misleading trailer
",After seeing the trailer I went in set for a fast paced horror flick but instead got a fairly plodding emotional thriller. The trailer contains scenes from the last few minutes of the film which really annoyed me as I spent most of the film wondering when someon was going to burst into flames.Great acting throughout however.,5,2,5,22 June 2018
