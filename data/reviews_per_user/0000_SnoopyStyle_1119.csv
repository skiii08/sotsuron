The Rock,8,2,2,11 January 2014," Michael Bay - Nicolas Cage - Sean Connery
","Renegade general Hummel (Ed Harris) has stolen 15 VX rockets, taken over Alcatraz, taken 81 hostages, and threatens to strike San Francisco unless The Pentagon pays him $100M from their slush funds. He intends to use the money to pay the families of the soldiers under his command who the government has disavowed over the years. In order to disarm the rockets, the FBI is sending their chemical weapons expert Stanley Goodspeed (Nicolas Cage). And they're digging up a mysterious British agent prisoner John Mason (Sean Connery) who once escaped from Alcatraz. When the team sent in to take on Hummel is decimated, Goodspeed and Mason must disarm the rockets on their own.This is Michael Bay audacity to bring his heart pumping action style to bear. The action is big time bombastic joy. And for the best effect, he allows the actors to have fun in between the action. Nicolas Cage brings a lot of his manic energy and a bit of his crazy humor. And Sean Connery brings the Bond gravitas to the action. Plus the Cage Connery duo is a lot of fun, and they have great chemistry together. This is the best kind of popcorn movie-making."
The Double Life of Véronique,6,1,3,27 August 2015," fine art-house film of sadness
",Weronika and Véronique are two unrelated connected lives. Weronika (Irène Jacob) is a singer in small town Poland. She gets an audition for a choir. Then she sees french tourist Véronique (Irène Jacob) taking pictures. Weronika collapses and dies in her first performance. Véronique feels the lost and quits singing.There is a pervasive saddest throughout the movie. The film is drained of bright colors. Weronika's life is the first 30 minutes and the rest is Véronique dealing with a lost that she can't fully comprehend. Irène Jacob is a beauty. She has a great dreamlike quality. However the two characters don't have enough separations. It's a fine art-house film of sadness.
"Run, Fat Boy, Run",6,1,2,30 July 2014," Limited comedy
","Dennis Doyle (Simon Pegg) is a lazy scared loser. He leaves his pregnant fiancée Libby (Thandie Newton) in a case of runaway groom. Five years later, he's a store security guard still trying to get back together with Libby. They have a kid Jake. She has a new successful boyfriend Whit (Hank Azaria). Dennis is still unreliable. Whit tells him that he's doing the Nike River run. Dennis decides to do the run to prove something to Libby. The problem is that he's horribly unfit.This is marginally likable only because of Simon Pegg. The problem is that director David Schwimmer and writers Michael Ian Black and Simon Pegg fail to get anywhere particularly funny. Sure it has Hank Azaria flashing Pegg. But Schwimmer can't quite make it funny. Pegg probably misses Nick Frost as his sidekick. He needs a buddy for a buddy comedy. There are some cute training scenes. The crude American humor is too obvious. Pegg seems to struggle with those. Considering the talent, this should be much better."
The Devil's Advocate,6,3,7,15 August 2015," too ambitious and too long
","Florida defense lawyer Kevin Lomax (Keanu Reeves) has a perfect record. He is angered when he realizes his client is guilty. Nevertheless, he destroys the victim on the stand. He is married to Mary Ann (Charlize Theron) and his religious mother Alice disapproves. John Milton (Al Pacino) recruits Kevin to his NYC law firm. The couple is given a massive apartment and lots of money.Al Pacino seems to be having a lot of fun with lines like 'They don't see me coming.' He's great at being Satan. The movie is too ambitious. It wants to be a horror like 'The Exocist' or 'Rosemary's Baby', but it doesn't have the tension. It tries to be a character study but Kevin is too arrogant and too dumb to be appealing. It's also too long. This should be better especially with Pacino enjoying himself. The final twist is also problematic and is a cheat on the rest of the movie."
Ford v Ferrari,8,3,4,24 February 2020," old fashion greatness
",Racing champ Carroll Shelby (Matt Damon) has to retire due to a medical issue. His racing friend Ken Miles (Christian Bale) is seen as difficult and the IRS has confiscated his garage. Ferrari has been at the top of racing in the 24 Hours of Le Mans. The Ford Motor Company finds its sales going stale and Henry Ford II wants a big idea. Marketing VP Lee Iacocca has the idea to enter the race. They first try to buy Ferrari and Enzo Ferrari insults Henry Ford II. Iacocca recruits Shelby to create a racing car and Shelby recruits Miles to be his driver.This is an old fashion rip roaring good times. Damon and Bale are great. All the actors are great whether it's Tracy Letts being told that he's not Henry Ford or the villainy of Josh Lucas. It's a solid sports underdog story. It's fun like Caitriona Balfe driving crazy. The race is thrilling. It is a perfectly made old fashion movie.
The Blair Witch Project,6,1,4,4 October 2014," Birth of a sub-genre
","In October 1994, three film students Heather Donahue, Josh Leonard and Mike Williams (their real names) disappeared in the woods near Burkittsville, Maryland. A year later, their cameras are found. There is a local legend of The Blair Witch and missing children. They were there to do a documentary.This is the granddaddy of the found footage movies. This could be scary if the audience buys into the film as real. I didn't and it's not scary for me. It's a little too shaky and rambling. I am reminded of Michael Moore talking about what a revelation the tripod is. Also the start is excruciatingly slow. It's an interesting idea that birthed a whole new genre. That's no easy task. However, it achieves very little more than that for me. It is more dizzying than frightening."
The King's Speech,8,1,2,14 September 2014," Two incredible performances
","This movie starts in 1925 as King George directs his second son, the future King George VI (Colin Firth), to deliver a speech on the radio. He stutters his way through an embarrassing effort. It's a struggle with various bad teachers. His only support is his wife (Helena Bonham Carter). She finds unorthodox speech therapist Lionel Logue (Geoffrey Rush) surreptitiously without her husband's approval. He is more than very reluctant. He slowly develops a friendship with the amateur actor Lionel. Meanwhile his older brother King Edward VIII (Guy Pearce) is dating Wallis Simpson (Eve Best) culminating in his abdication and the installation of George as the new king.This is an actors' movie. Both Firth and Rush are doing award worthy performances. They have created real flesh and blood human beings and not just some stuffy royal and his Professor Higgins. They have real feelings and fears. The fear in George is palpable. They have great interactions together especially early on. The movie does have a few slow spots in the middle but it's still one of the best of that year."
Despicable Me 2,8,0,0,28 June 2014," I love the Minions
","Gru has become a good guy and a father to the girls Margo, Agnes, and Edith. He's trying to make jam and jelly but Dr. Nefario can't make it work and quits. A mysterious villain has stolen an Arctic base that was experimenting with transmutation serum PX-41 that transforms any creature into indestructible monsters. Anti-Villain League agent Lucy Wilde kidnaps Gru to get him to help find the culprit. Together they investigate suspects working at a mall. Meanwhile the minions are being taken by the unknown villain.The minions are back. And also Gru is back too. But I love this most of all for the minions. They are funny every time that they're on the screen. They are just the silliest and the most adorable. Gru has an interesting family story where the girls especially Agnes wants a mother figure. The oldest girl Margo is infatuated with a boy. And Gru could be falling for Lucy. It makes for a good compelling personal story. And did I mention the Minions? They're super great."
The Mask,8,1,1,25 December 2013," Perfect vehicle for Jim Carrey
","A mask with magical powers is released from an underwater chest in Edge City. Stanley Ipkiss (Jim Carrey) is a super nice meek bank clerk. This is the first movie with Cameron Diaz. She plays a hot bombshell who walks into the branch to open an account. It turns out that she's actually casing the bank. Then he finds the mask, and things take a turn for the crazy.This is the perfect vehicle for Jim Carrey. He is basically a Bugs Bunny cartoon with the mask on. And that's his persona on stage. This premise allows Carrey to use his manic energy to the fullest without looking ridiculous. And it doesn't hurt to have a hot Cameron Diaz walking around in those tight short dresses."
Saturday Night Fever,9,0,2,3 April 2016," Travolta in disco heaven
","Tony Manero (John Travolta) is a strutting 19 year old Italian-American in Brooklyn. He works in a paint store, fights with his loud combative family, and lives for disco. He's the local disco king with a group of friends. Local girl Annette is desperate to be his girl. The Verrazano–Narrows Bridge divides this world from the magical world of Manhattan. He is taken with new girl Stephanie Mangano. Annette convinces him to be her dance partner in the big contest. Tony pushes to get Stephanie who has her eye on Manhattan. The family is shocked when his sainted brother decides to leave the priesthood.From the first scene, Travolta brings a power into this disco fable. It's the music. It's the fashion. It's the family and friends. Best of all, it's a hungry Travolta on the prowl. Tony is clueless but he's hungry. He doesn't know what he's hungry for but he's restless for it. Travolta is uninhibited. He's a disco god. Special mention goes to Donna Pescow and her great portrayal of Annette."
Insidious: Chapter 2,6,0,0,19 May 2014," Mostly a logically continuation that works well
","It's after the first movie and the police suspects Josh Lambert (Patrick Wilson) of killing the medium Elise Rainier. The police interrogates his wife Renai (Rose Byrne) about the night. Dalton seems to be normal but things are not right at home. It turns out that back in 1986, Elise had interviewed Josh, and Specs and Tucker rediscover the taped interview. Mother Lorraine (Barbara Hershey) sees a vision and everybody suspects there is a spirit. Josh refuses to acknowledge any of it except he is talking to an unseen person.This one misses Dalton in danger. Heck the kid is on the poster in the first one. There is something about a child in danger which raises the tension. That's why the best scene is the one with Dalton and the tin cans. When the string gets taut, that's a horror scene that I haven't seen before. It is a beautiful setup as if something is about to be pulled out of the closet. Patrick Wilson is great when he makes the switch. He's just as capable playing either side. The sequel follows logically from the original and works well for the most part. The other world is fascinating and very satisfying."
The Lobster,8,1,4,1 September 2016," strange with a point of view
",David (Colin Farrell) is taken to an isolated hotel. His wife has just left him. The hotel clients have 45 days to find a partner before they are turned into an animal. David's dog is his brother after failing to find a match. He selects to be changed into a lobster. There are particular rules and planned events to the hotel.This is one strange movie. It does have an internal logic which it is able to keep. It's weirdly funny at times. The deadpan mannerism doesn't keep the movie static. It is able to maintain a compelling story despite its peculiar world. This movie has ideas and it stays with them. Yorgos Lanthimos and his collaborator Efthymis Filippou have done some weird stuff like Dogtooth. This one is able to recruit top shelf acting talents. The second half gets over-extended as it tries to expand the world. The hotel is such a curious place that I would rather stay there for the whole movie.
The Benchwarmers,4,0,0,5 July 2014," really stupid premise
","Gus (Rob Schneider) is a fair ballplayer but he was picked on as a kid. He's now a landscaper married to Liz (Molly Sims) who is only concern about having a baby. Richie (David Spade) is an annoying little video store clerk. Clark (Jon Heder) is the hopelessly idiotic newspaper delivery boy. They come to the rescue of a chubby geek being picked on by a little league baseball team. The three guy challenge and win against the kids team. The chubby kid's billionaire nerd dad Mel (Jon Lovitz) comes up with a tournament idea. The three guys play against all the kids baseball teams for the prize of a real ballpark.This is a really stupid premise. I'm not saying this is illogical or unrealistic. That goes without saying. This is a problem because the 3 guys aren't actually underdogs. They need to be underdogs in a sports movie sense. I'm not sure it's that much fun watching adults beating little kids. And quite frankly, I would just intentionally walk Gus every time.The only saving grace is that Rob Schneider is actually likable in this. He's not playing his usual jerk character. When Molly Sims pops up for the first time, I had to roll my eyes. After Rob plays his character for awhile, I can see the marriage happening. He just needs to play this character in a better movie. This is a poor mess that a late night writing session created. I bet somebody had a little much and thought it would be funny to have adults win against little kids baseball. It's not actually funny and only a couple of physical gags garner any chuckles."
Moneyball,8,0,2,10 November 2013," Traditional underdog story
","Based on the book Moneyball, Oakland A's GM Billy Beane must rebuilt his ball club after the team is dismantled. He doesn't have the money but he'll use the computer to crunch the numbers to find his island of misfit toys. I'm not going to debate baseball history but this is a compelling story.Brad Pitt is wonderful as the fast talking GM. It's a tougher role than most people are give him credit for. Jonah Hill is the affable geeky number cruncher Peter Brand. The story has all the great touches. The underdog, the entrenched establishment, the overwhelming odds, this movie has got it all. But I suspect the biggest advantage it has is writer Aaron Sorkin and his pen."
Whip It,8,1,4,29 January 2016," fun enjoyable movie
","Shy Bliss Cavendar (Ellen Page) is an outsider in the conservative town of Bodeen, Texas. Her former pageant winning mother Brooke (Marcia Gay Harden) insists on entering her and her sister. While on a shopping trip with her mother to Austin, she is taken by some roller derby girls. With the help of her friend Pash (Alia Shawkat), she goes to see them. Maggie Mayhem (Kristen Wiig) tells her to be her own hero. She lies about her age and makes it on a team.Ellen Page has big time charisma in her little stature. I love her friendship with Pash and her relationship with her mother. The story is very standard sports and coming-of-age movie. I like the team and their chemistry. I like their coach Razor. On the other hand, the boyfriend is too much of a standard indie rocker guy. He's an unimaginative character. Drew Barrymore's directing is good for a relative novice. Overall, this is a fun enjoyable movie with a lovely star."
The Avengers,9,2,7,17 August 2013," Avengers vs TDKR
","Nick Fury brings together Earth's mightiest heroes to stop Loki who is unleashing an alien invasion.Robert Downey Jr. makes this good and Joss Whedon makes this great. Downey has already shown that he's a movie star. He could power a whole franchise all by himself but the Avengers is more than just a one man team. This is a quintessential Joss Whedon Scooby gang, and he's great at the snappy dialog and friend-hate comradry. This is a whole team of heroes working together.Because of its timing, this will be compared to The Dark Knight Rises. Most seems to give TDKR more credit because of its darker grittier tone. Both are great but I like Avengers better. Honestly, TDKR is inferior to TDK. There are logic problems with TDKR. There are too many comic-book moves in that film. It's melodramatic in its emotionally manipulations. The Avengers is simply better written. Its dialog is better. It may be simplistic but it's more fun."
National Treasure: Book of Secrets,5,0,1,4 May 2014," Starts out well but just turns stupid/boring
","Gates family history is Patrick Gates (Jon Voight)'s grandfather Charles' recollection of the night of Lincoln's assassination. Charles's father Thomas was given a book to decipher. It turned out to be Booth's diary and the man was actually a member of Knights of the Golden Circle. KGC were confederate saboteurs working in the north. The diary had a clue to a treasure that the confederates want. Thomas threw the pages into the fire and was killed for it. The confederate spy was able to retrieve a part of a page. Thomas Gates was always a hero in the story until now when Mitch Wilkinson (Ed Harris) shows up with the missing page. Mitch is a antiquities soldier of fortune and wants the treasure. His ancestor was a confederate general. The missing page has Thomas Gates' name along with the other conspirators. Everybody now believes that Thomas was a Booth co-conspirator and Ben (Nicolas Cage) has to clear his family name with the help of Riley Poole (Justin Bartha), ex-girlfriend Abigail Chase (Diane Kruger), and even his mother Emily Appleton (Helen Mirren) who can't stand his father.The gang is reunited. The bickering couple chemistry is funny and good. The group has a lot of fun. The movie seems to be trying very hard to be cutesy fun. The addition of Helen Mirren added surprisingly little. Ed Harris is a little too scary and mean. He seems capable of killing anyone. They travel around the world in a wild chase for treasure. It's one big monument after another. It just turns very repetitive as they find clues in a series of over-the-top capers. About halfway into the movie, it gets way too ridiculous even for a National Treasure movie. I could still let this movie get a pass, but the final crazy City of Gold really sank this one. When they got on the ridiculous tippy top table, I couldn't wait for this to end."
Blade Runner 2049,9,21,45,10 October 2017," pure cinema
","It's 2049 Los Angeles. K (Ryan Gosling) is a Blade Runner hunting for old Nexus 8 replicants under LAPD Lieutenant Joshi (Robin Wright). After the 2022 blackout, most records have been erased or corrupted. Tyrell is out of business and replicant production had been outlawed until Niander Wallace (Jared Leto). Wallace is producing a new obedient replicant. Luv (Sylvia Hoeks) is his replicant henchwoman. K hunts down an old Nexus 8 and in the process, he discovers a surprise which leads to Deckard (Harrison Ford). Joi (Ana de Armas) is K's holographic computer girlfriend. Mariette (Mackenzie Davis) is a prostitute.This is pure cinema although I can see some object to the length and dark depressing sensibilities. For the most part, the action is not intended to be fun. Some people will feel the long running time more than others. An easy test is whether the person likes the original or any cyberpunk sci-fi anime. This takes the original's visual mastery and adds a more compelling detective mystery. Any BR fan will undoubtedly love this unless they are some nitpicking fanatic. Non-fans may find this more appealing... or not.The original's detective story and pacing are its major flaws. This sequel has a real detective story with a real mystery. The writing is impeccable. The designs take the original vision and dives right in. Roger Deakins' work is beyond beautiful. Villeneuve is at the top of his game. Gosling is a more effective lead. Ford comes in during the second half and is a more fun Deckard. Ana de Armas is a gorgeous vision of girl perfection. Sylvia Hoeks is an amazing villain. The movie tackles all of the ideas without hitting one over the head. This is a great film although I'm not sure if popular modern audience will take to it. The opening box office certainly does not suggest that."
Million Dollar Arm,7,0,0,4 April 2015," fine underdog sports movie.
","Womanizing JB Bernstein (Jon Hamm) and Aash (Aasif Mandvi) are small sport agents struggling against their former employer Procorp. After watching Aash's cricket game and Susan Boyle, JB comes up with an idea to get pitching arms from India for the LA Dodgers owner Chang. They convince Tom House (Bill Paxton) the highly improbable task to train the amateurs. Brenda (Lake Bell) is his winning medical student tenant. Vivek is his local manager. With eager Amit Rohan and sleepy scout Ray Poitevint (Alan Arkin), they run a $1 million reality contest.This is a fine underdog sports movie. I like the kids' stories. I wish they expanded more on their lives. Jon Hamm is a bit too intense and he needs a bit more humor. Lake Bell is terrific. The movie is also restricted by the real story. The boys could never go to the World Series. They also didn't crash and burn. They end up in a middling area where they get some success but not enough to be good climax material. The movie is also too long at over 2 hours but it has a good solid base of an underdog movie."
Angels & Demons,6,0,1,5 October 2013," At least Hanks got a haircut
","The Pope is dead, and the conclave has been locked in to choose the new pope. Four cardinals are designated 'preferitti', and then are kidnapped by the assumed disbanded Illuminati. In the meanwhile, a powerful and dangerous prototype of antimatter has been stolen. Robert Landgon (Tom Hanks) is called upon once again to solve the crime and prevent mass destruction.At least Tom Hanks got a haircut this time. The science is laughable. So at least that matches with the rest of the story. The locations are great, and the action helps push the story out in the end. I could almost forgive all preposterous stuff in this movie."
Kill Bill: Vol. 2,7,0,2,2 May 2014," Not as great as hoped for but still a very good watch
","Beatrix Kiddo (Uma Thurman) is the bride. She tracks down Budd (Michael Madsen) but he takes her down first. He puts her in a coffin and buries her. Elle Driver (Daryl Hannah) double crosses Budd and kills him. Beatrix manages to escape and finds Elle in Budd's trailer. They have a knock down fight. Afterwards the only one left is Bill (David Carradine). There are also flashbacks to the wedding rehearsal before the massacre and Beatrix's training with master Pai Mei.It's slightly less compelling than part 1. Part 1 is bookended with 2 amazing fight scenes with lots of action in between. Part 2 really only has the great fight between Beatrix And Elle in its middle. The training segment is a bit of fun. The ending with Bill is somewhat a letdown. Quentin Tarantino should have realized that the girl is a great opportunity to subvert the traditional innocent girlie character. But that opportunity is lost here. The whole Last Chapter is a little too much talk and not enough action. Considering the first part ended with the big fight with O-Ren Ishii, this part ends with something less."
First Man,6,2,5,23 December 2018," Dry
","In 1961, Neil Armstrong (Ryan Gosling) is a test pilot for the X-15 with nerves of steel. He manages to save the landing after some difficulties. Others dismiss him as simply an egghead engineer. He is severely private but he does break down over his daughter's death. Janet (Claire Foy) is his dutiful wife. He joins the Gemini program run by former astronaut Deke Slayton (Kyle Chandler) which would lead him to be the first man on the moon.This is Damien Chazelle's first film without music as the subject. He is able to bring action to the space exploration. There are a couple of nice visceral close shaves. The Gemini uncontrolled spin is really thrilling. The marriage is interesting with two compelling actors. The over-riding feeling is a dry unemotional narrative. Most of that is due to the quiet reserve of Armstrong. He is not a man of emoting and the movie has to work within the constrains of his personality. The production is impeccable. The vibe doesn't have the emotional highs and lows that are necessarily for a truly intense film."
The Hunger Games: Mockingjay - Part 1,6,0,4,2 September 2015," good set up for finale
","Katniss Everdeen (Jennifer Lawrence) is still haunted by the Games. President Snow (Donald Sutherland) is holding Peeta (Josh Hutcherson) hostage and using him as a media tool. Katniss does a deal with District 13 President Coin (Julianne Moore) to rescue the Victors in exchange for her being the Mockingjay symbol of the resistance.I like the idea of Wag the Dog. However it has to be executed with precision. Those scenes of trying to handle Katniss could have been funny or foreboding. Woody Harrelson has some fun but there are too many awkward moments with the media idea. The writing needs to be sharper. Katniss indirectly causes the destruction of the hospital and it doesn't even occurs to her.I don't mind limiting the action in this episode. It's trying to set up a lot of things for the finale. Although the rescue ending could have been an exciting sequence. It needs Katniss joining the rescue team. The switching back and forth drains the tension out of the action. It wouldn't cost that much and it would be a great way to end the movie. At the very least, it would silence most of the complainers about the lack of action. This is a good set up for the finale. There are some awkwardness and minor annoyances. Lawrence is able to deliver on a difficult role. There are some good additions to the franchise. I expect a great explosive final chapter."
The Legend of Bagger Vance,5,0,2,13 June 2014," Magical Negro fable
","The story is told by Hardy Greaves who growing up in Savannah, Georgia as a child idolized golfer Rannulph Junah (Matt Damon). Rannulph had married wealthy Adele Invergordon (Charlize Theron). However he returns from WWI broken and disappears. Adele moves on with her father's business to build a golf course in 1928. She finds Rannulph return to town but a year later, the great depression hit. The golf course is complete but the financial strain drive Adele's father to suicide. Adele struggles to keep the golf course open by organizing an exhibition between Bobby Jone (Joel Gretsch) and Walter Hagen (Bruce McGill) for a prize of $10k. In a town meeting, people demand for a local golfer but the drunken Captain Junah is reluctant to play. While trying to get back his swing late one night, Bagger Vance (Will Smith) asks for a job to caddy for the big game.It takes a bit of exposition to get started. Charlize Theron and Matt Damon starts off with an interesting period piece. Then Will Smith comes in and it slowly becomes obvious that this is some kind of Magical Negro that he's playing. This is apparently a fable where racism is not much mentioned nor noticed. It demands that the viewer forget any historical realism since this is a fable after all.The best thing about this is that Robert Redford has made a beautiful looking movie. It is however slow moving, and lacks the needed energy to keep up the pace for the whole 2 hours. My biggest problem is that the fable needs much more magic especially visually. Redford does a lot of speeding up the clouds and clouds rolling by and shots of nature and shots of sky and various other in-camera moves to denote magic. It needs something more. It needs something much more. It needs to put this movie definitively into the magical territories. This is not the simple period piece that Redford is creating. (small unimportant spoiler: even the last scene is too uncertain. Bagger Vance is waving old Hardy Greaves over. Redford really needs to spell out what's going on there.)The acting seems fine to me. Matt Damon and Charlize Theron have some nice scenes together. They have the best fun and I enjoy them the most. I'm not able to tell if the accents are accurate but I don't think it's so obvious that it would offend anybody other than southerners. Will Smith is playing someone unreal. He is almost otherworldly. If this isn't a fable, I'm tempted to say that he's playing it too fake. In the end, it's an uneven viewing experience."
Vertigo,8,2,4,29 November 2013," slow 1st half, good obsessive 2nd half
","San Francisco police detective Scottie Ferguson retires after suffering vertigo during a roof top chase. A college friend Gavin Elster is a wealthy shipbuilder who hires him to follow his wife Madeleine (Kim Novak). He thinks she is being possessed. Scottie finds her obsessed with a dead ancestor, and attempting suicide. He rescues her and falls for her.This movie does move a bit too slow especially in the first half. The difficulty lies in all the following in the car. It's not the most exciting thing to drive around. In a modern movie, those scenes would be severely edited down. It's not like they were exciting car chases.It's not my favorite Hitchcock movie. I did like James Stewart when he gets obsessive. He's good in that section. As for being too old for the part, that to me seems to work for him in this movie. His obsession becomes more self-destructive. It has a creepiness to it. I have to admit that I didn't recognize Novak as Judy Barton. It confused me a bit at first. I think people of that era would have an easier time recognizing Kim Novak. As homage to its importance and inventive camera work, I'll add an extra point or else I would have given it 7/10."
"The Adventures of Priscilla, Queen of the Desert",8,0,1,17 August 2015," great characters
","Ralph Waite aka Bernadette Bassenger (Terence Stamp) suffered a friend's death and agrees to go with Tick Belrose aka Mitzi Del Bra (Hugo Weaving) to perform in Alice Springs, a desert resort town in the middle of Australia. Adam Whitely aka Felicia Jollygoodfellow (Guy Pearce) is eager to join and buys a touring bus christening her Priscilla, Queen of the Desert.This has some fun comedic touches. However the trick of this movie is that the guys don't play it too broadly. Stamp and Weaving are actually playing it reserved. They are more wore-down middle age men than flamboyant gays. Guy Pearce is the only one playing it somewhat broadly. The costumes are great ridiculousness. The movie is full of big laughs and also a touching character study."
Black Swan,8,1,2,15 February 2014," Amazing Natalie Portman performance
","Nina Sayers (Natalie Portman) is a New York City ballerina living with her overbearing mother (Barbara Hershey). The prima ballerina Beth MacIntyre (Winona Ryder) is being replaced for the opening production of Swan Lake. Nina is the favorite, but new dancer Lily (Mila Kunis) is impressive as well. Nina fits the role of the beautiful, fearful, fragile White Swan perfectly, but she can't get the Black Swan role right unlike Lily. She's obsessed with her deteriorating body as her paranoid mind collapses.This is a great performance from Natalie Portman. There's a sense of chaos and insanity falling down on her. It definitely has the sensibility of director Darren Aronofsky. Although I do wonder where he's going with this movie at times. It has a realism and a horror feel to the movie. Portman's body slowly turns into a horror show is reminiscent of Jeff Goldblum picking apart his body in 'The Fly'. Mila Kunis is playing a pretty interesting mean girl, or is it all in Nina's head. That's the beauty of this movie. It plays not just with Nina's mind, but the audience's mind."
Changeling,8,1,2,29 November 2014," Some great performances
","In 1928 Los Angeles, single mother Christine Collins (Angelina Jolie) is one of the first supervisors of telephone operators. Her son Walter goes missing after a day at work. The LAPD is slow to help. The police is under pressure for being corrupt. Five months later, Captain J.J. Jones (Jeffrey Donovan) gives her an abandoned boy dressed up to be Walter and promoted as a great reunion. However Christine refuses to accept the lie and the cops dismiss her. She enlists the help of Rev. Gustav Briegleb (John Malkovich). The police throws her into the insane asylum. Meanwhile Detective Lester Ybarra (Michael Kelly) is investigating a case leading a child killing ring which Jones aims to cover up.This is a harrowing based on true story. Angelina Jolie does a great performance. The story does meander as all true stories tend to do which takes aways some of the intensity. It definitely goes to a different place than what I expected. I wasn't expecting child murders. Jeffrey Donovan also has a terrific performance as the villain of the piece. It's one movie where I hoped for a happy ending but that's not the case in real life."
Pirates of the Caribbean: On Stranger Tides,4,0,1,1 December 2013," mess of murky characters
","Captain Jack Sparrow (Johnny Depp) returns for the fourth installment of this most unlikely franchise. This time he's after the fabled Fountain of Youth. It's as outlandish as ever. He runs across Angelica Teach (Penélope Cruz)who's been impersonating him. She was once preparing to be a nun when he found her in a convent. Soon he finds out that she's the cruel pirate Blackbeard (Ian McShane)'s daughter, and he's forced into leading them to the Fountain of Youth. Meanwhile, Captain Barbossa (Geoffrey Rush) is now working for the British and is hot pursuit.This is a mess of questionable characters with murky motives. The lightness of Keira Knightley and Orlando Bloom are gone. We've left with a convoluted plot with unlikeable characters. Jack Sparrow was the rogue in the first one, but in this one, he's the nicest. How did that happened? The newcomer in this one is Penélope Cruz. Let's just say the outfits don't release her biggest assets. Of course she was pregnant during the filming. It doesn't make the movie any better.Then there is the action. It's has the required swashbuckling, but it lacks the great memorable set pieces. To be honest, I can't remember a single set piece from this movie. Other than Jack Sparrow, there isn't much to watch for in this one."
Men in Black 3,7,0,1,27 August 2013," Willy is back. Kind of missed Tommy.
","Big Willy is back but Tommy is sitting this one out. Agent J (Will Smith) travels back in time to team up with younger Agent K (Josh Brolin).Although Josh does a good impression of Tommy Lee Jones, I still miss the grumpy old man. The chemistry is just different. The story works well and it has great flow. It is a compelling watch. It continues with the same style. It feels like more of the same which is mostly a good thing. Will Smith is truly in charge of this franchise. And this is his movie all the way. The controversy over Chinese interference doesn't really affect it too much."
Come and See,7,0,7,13 March 2014," Mix of realism and surrealism
","Young Byelorussian youth Florya finds a rifle buried in the sand. He joins the resistance against the Nazis. He falls for beautiful peasant girl Glascha. A bombardment deafens him. He struggles around the war torn world. After getting separated once again, he pretends to be a simple farm boy. He is rounded up by the invading German force with the other town folks. He barely escapes a massacre of innocent villagers.The first half has a lot of surrealism. Some of it is quite disturbing, and not necessarily the big obvious things like the dead bodies. The encounter with Glascha is the woods is completely wacko. I still don't understand what's going on between the two kids. Talking directly into the screen and extreme closeups are very disturbing. The dead body Hitler scarecrow is probably the most normal thing in that section. It keeps the movie from finding its feet. It unbalances what should be a compelling introduction.The technicals of the movie is fair. I do wonder if they used real ammunitions. The big explosions are shocking. The tracer rounds look very real. I'm pretty sure they killed that cow. I doubt they used any animatronics to do the rolling of the cow's eye. When they use real flamethrowers and real ammunition, it leaves all the fake Hollywood effects behind.And then when they burn down the church, I wanted it to be more realistic. I guess the Russians don't have the Hollywood expertise on stunts so a burn man is out of the question. The Russians put a lot of man and material into this. The wild orgy of violence is impressive. The second half of this movie is far more engaging. The movie is odd mix of realistic action and surreal emotionalism."
The New World,7,0,0,26 July 2016," slow dreamy beauty
","It's 1607. John Smith (Colin Farrell) arrives in the new world in chains. Captain Christopher Newport establishes the Jamestown, Virginia settlement. He pardons John Smith and puts him in charge of an expedition. With rising tension, John is taken prisoner by the natives. Pocahontas is the favorite of Chief Powhatan. She saves John's life and he becomes a part of the community. He is released back to the settlement to find starvation and death stalking the remaining settlers. They are saved by Pocahontas. Powhatan banishes her and orders an attack when the English won't leave.Terrence Malick has mastered the slow dreamy beautiful visual style. He makes the native world an idyllic paradise. The English world is the one with a foreboding menace. The dreamy mood works well for the native civilization. The action also works well with surprisingly scary quick native warriors. The English world feels disjointed. The story is told in snippets. Malick is much more interested in the dreamlike mood. It doesn't have the intensity and urgency of the story which leads me to wonder if a fictional story would be better. In that way, accuracy and specificity would not matter quite as much. Pocahontas in the English world is not as compelling as John Smith in the native world. Q'orianka Kilcher is an intriguing new actress. She's able to maintain interest throughout."
Scarface,8,1,4,18 July 2014," Gangster violence to a whole new level
","In May 1980, Castro releases thousands of Cuban prisoners including Tony Montana (Al Pacino) from Mariel Harbor. His friend Manny Ribera (Steven Bauer) gets a contract to kill a political prisoner for green cards for both of them. They're soon working for drug dealer Omar Suarez (F. Murray Abraham) to double cross some Columbians. Tony takes advantage and becomes a hit-man for big boss Frank Lopez (Robert Loggia). He is after Lopez's girlfriend Elvira Hancock (Michelle Pfeiffer) and his whole empire. His mother (Miriam Colon) disapproves of his work and tries to separate him from his adoring sister Gina (Mary Elizabeth Mastrantonio).Al Pacino gives one of the most memorable weird performance of the world. Director Brian De Palma brings an ultra-violent sense to the material. It brings almost joy to this violent villain character. It reminds me of the old WB gangster movies where violence rules. This pushes it to an even higher level. It's a new icon of the gangster movies."
Love and Death,7,1,1,2 October 2016," Keaton gets more to do
","Boris Grushenko (Woody Allen) is facing execution as he recounts his story. In Czarist Russia, Boris is in love with his intellectual cousin Sonja (Diane Keaton). She is jilted by Boris' handsome brother Ivan and marries a rich herring merchant instead. Despite being a coward, Boris is drafted to fight in the Napoleonic Wars. Sonja becomes a widow. Ivan is killed in the war but Boris becomes an accidental hero. The two reunite to marry and try to save the world by assassinating Napoleon.This is a parody of Dostoyevsky and Tolstoy novels in a spoof. As such, this may not be to everyone's taste. One has to have a wide-ranging literary and art film knowledge to appreciate a lot of the jokes. Diane Keaton does get to do more in this one. She has some darker sides and is almost equal to Woody. The literary crowd may have some laughs although they may be too stuffy to relax about the skewering."
Frost_Nixon,8,1,1,25 March 2014," Amazing Performances
","Richard Nixon (Frank Langella) is the disgraced president after just resigning. David Frost (Michael Sheen) has the idea immediately to get his interview. He is certain that it will be a ratings bonanza. After years of hounding, Nixon does the interview in summer 1977 to set the record straight and collect the $600k.Director Ron Howard has created a fascinating movie about what on the surface should be a very static drama. He injects great energy and excitement for what could have been a very dry movie. Michael Sheen does a great job as the charming TV personality. Frank Langella doesn't have the look of Nixon, but his terrific acting chops is put to full use to infused his character with Nixon's persona. Howard allows the two great actors to shine without putting to much gloss to distract the audience."
Howl's Moving Castle,7,1,2,31 October 2016," interesting world
","Sophie is a young shy hat maker working for her mother in an alternate-world turn-of-the-century European town. A wizard named Howl rescues her from a couple of lascivious soldiers only to be chased by a horde of waste demons. They escape to her sister Lettie's place. She is later visited by the Witch of the Waste and turned into an old woman. She runs away and encounters scarecrow Turnip-Head. After helping it, it leads her to Howl's Moving Castle. There she encounters the fire demon Calcifer who Howl uses to power the castle. Calcifer offers to break her curse if she could end his servitude. Sophie pretends to be new cleaning lady Grandma Sophie. The Mayor arrives at the Great Wizard Jenkins with a request from the King to fight in the war. Howl's apprentice Markl is able to switch between various exits and with various disguises. Then the other king invites Great Wizard Pendragon to join in the war. Howl is known as both wizards and unwilling to help either side. Madame Suliman threatens to take away his powers before he is lost after losing his heart.This is an interesting world. The start sets up an easy fantasy with an evil witch and a haunted hero. The twist is the heroine gets turned into an old hag. About midway, the movie takes an odd turn that deviates from that easy formula. The evil witch becomes powerless. There is a new villain but she's not really a villain. This is an anti-war movie but it isn't so straight forward. Even the simple love story gets a last-minute true love detour. While the world is amazing, the story seems to delight in odd diversions from the formula."
Walk the Line,8,1,1,15 September 2013," Great biopic love story
",This is biopic of the great Johnny Cash (Joaquin Phoenix) from him picking cotton growing up in the Great Depression era to his marriage to Vivian (Ginnifer Goodwin) and to his romance with June Carter (Reese Witherspoon).Joaquin Phoenix puts in an excellent performance. It's not the music development that's put upfront. It's not really about Johnny Cash climbing the chart. This is a love story between Johnny Cash and June Carter Cash. Reese is also great. Don't get me wrong. The music is great. But it's the amazing love story that will make you fall for this movie.
Borat: Cultural Learnings of America for Make Benefit Glorious Nation of Kazakhstan,9,1,1,26 September 2013," Enjoy the outrageousness
","Sacha Baron Cohen creates a mockumentary about one of his characters. Borat Sagdiyev is from Kazakhstan mesmerized by Baywatch character C. J. Parker. He vows to find actress Pamela Anderson and take her from California back to his home in Kazakhstan.The humor is edgy, offensive, and rather mean spirited at times. Most of it is directed at Borat. But many people in this film become collateral damage. There are multiple stories of people who got filmed thought it was a real documentary. And they were edited to make them look ridiculous. Those parts are not always that funny. They're usually too obvious. Anyways self deprecating humor is usually the best. Sacha really excels at making fun of Borat. He has to be one of the most original characters on screen. Just ignore whatever class or taste you have, and enjoy the outrageousness that is Borat."
Alien 3,5,2,8,26 October 2013," Disappointing
","Ripley (Sigourney Weaver) is the sole survivor when the ship ejects the pods onto Fiorina 'Fury' 161. Hicks and Newt both died. Bishop is unrepairable. It's a prison planet for male prisoners with some having taken vows of celibacy. They have no weapons. The company still has an agenda.This grumpy movie has a steamy moody atmosphere. It starts bad and ends bad. It's a real disappointment to have Newt and Hicks killed off so perfunctory. I understand the difficulty of find a Newt clone but was Michael Biehn busy? Even if these actors are unavailable, the characters could be saved by having them survive in a coma. One never know if they could be used in the next sequel. I think disappointing is the most apt description of this movie.The kills aren't as exciting. Neither is the premise. The fact is there isn't any rooting interest in any of the characters other than Ripley. Charles S. Dutton is the only other actor I like. They might as well be all Paul Reisers. The chase through the tunnels aren't tense. The layout isn't explained. About the only thing interesting is the moody atmosphere. It's trying to be a sexual psychological thriller. Fincher was only a music video director at the time. It does show his potential and visual certainty."
Sherlock Holmes: A Game of Shadows,7,1,2,15 September 2013," Watchable grand action adventure
","Sherlock Holmes (Robert Downey Jr.) and trusted friend Dr Watson (Jude Law) take on their arch-nemesis Professor Moriarty (Jared Harris) with the help of Holmes' older brother Mycroft Holmes (Stephen Fry) and a gypsy named Simza (Noomi Rapace).Director Guy Ritchie creates this sequel to his reboot franchise. This time around Irene Adler (Rachel McAdams) has little screen time, but she does drive the storyline. It is too bad she's not there because the chemistry between Irene and Sherlock jumps off the screen. The film feels the absence terribly. Simza is no replacement. I am getting a little tired of the speed up/slo-mo FX action style. It doesn't make the action any more dramatic. It just feels like Guy playing around and showing off. Other than that, it's good watchable grand action adventure."
Gremlins,8,1,3,20 October 2014," Quite scary for a children's horror movie
","Randall Peltzer is a traveling salesman for his poorly-conceived gadgets looking for a Christmas gift for his son Billy (Zach Galligan). While in Chinatown, he finds an adorable creature called mogwai. The old man refuses to sell but the little boy said they need the money. There are 3 rules to owning a mogwai. There can be no bright light, no water and no feeding after midnight. They live in the small town of Kingston Falls. Pete Fountaine (Corey Feldman) is a neighborhood kid. Kate Beringer (Phoebe Cates) is the nice girl. Gerald Hopkins (Judge Reinhold) is the ambitious climber. There's a wicked rich old Mrs. Deagle looking to put Billy's dog down. When Pete spills water on mogwai, he multiplies and five more pop out.This starts as a great children's horror at an idyllic small town with a cuddly teddy bear. The movie builds tension as Billy cluelessly break the rules. It builds to a fun ride that is actually very scary. For the younger kids, this is probably a little too much. People do die and the Gremlins get killed in splattery ways. The tension gets very high at times while at other times, it is very comedic."
The Incredible Hulk,7,0,2,30 November 2013," Improvement from 2003
","This starts with Bruce Banner (Edward Norton) hiding out in Brazil. When General Ross (William Hurt), finds him and sends Emil Blonsky (Tim Roth) to capture him. After a wild chase through the slums of Rio, Banner escapes and returns back home to get his data. Betty Ross (Liv Tyler) finds out and reunites with Banner.This is a good improvement from 2003. Edward Norton can play a wider range and make Banner more charming. Starting it in the Rio slums really ups the ante. It puts a bit of Jason Bourne in Banner. William Hurt is the weak spot. He doesn't have quite enough of the threatening demeanor. Tim Roth is able to pick up some of the slack as the baddie.The CGI fights are still CGI fights. It still feels like a video game. Nothing will ever replace the real feeling that a stunt guy is out there risking life and limb. The last fight with the two does drag on and on. It's still a pretty good entry into the Marvel universe."
The Monuments Men,6,1,1,24 December 2014," needs a bit more Indiana Jones
","Frank Stokes (George Clooney) argues for the rescue of the art of Europe as the Germans pull back. He recruits art experts for the task. Richard Campbell (Bill Murray) and Preston Savitz (Bob Balaban) are join together. Walter Garfield (John Goodman) team up with Jean Claude Clermont (Jean Dujardin). James Granger (Matt Damon) goes to Paris and finds French art expert Claire Simone (Cate Blanchett) who is leery to help him. Donald Jeffries (Hugh Bonneville) goes to Bruges to find a Madonna sculpture.It's fine to have light comedic moments in a war movie. The problem is that there isn't much of a war in this movie. I understand this is based on a real group of people but this movie needs a bit more Indiana Jones to spice it up. Also it hurts the movie to keep splitting the group up. Matt Damon's bad french is funny. Bill Murray and Bob Balaban seems to have fun ribbing each other. While it has its moments, the movie fails to maintain the tension throughout."
Antz,7,0,0,7 January 2015," Woody Allen as an ant
","Z (Woody Allen) is a neurotic little worker ant. He doesn't like the collective and wants to be an individual. Princess Bala sneaks out to the workers' bar and meets Z. He decides to switch places temporarily with soldier Weaver to get closer to Bala. It happens to be the day that they attack the termite army. It's a brutal battle and only Z returns. He's touted as a war hero. When his true identity is revealed, he tackles Bala and they fall out of the anthill. He intends on going to the legendary Insectopia and Bala has no choice but to follow him. Meanwhile, word spreads that Z was actually a worker and the workers revolt. General Mandible turns the mob to his advantage.Woody Allen is an ant. Of course, he's neurotic but he's also heroic in his individuality. They probably missed an opportunity to make Z look like the real Woody. This works a little better for the adults who see the comedy coming from Woody. The colors are not quite bright enough for the kids. It's a good story but I'm not sure if it means anything to the little ones."
Miracle,7,0,0,4 July 2015," solid historical drama
","After a tumultuous decade, there is a 'crisis of confidence' in America. University of Minnesota head coach Herb Brooks (Kurt Russell) is hired to coach the US hockey team for the 1980 Winter Olympics in Lake Placid. They are heavy underdogs. The Soviets even beat the NHL All Stars. The US team consists of amateurs who haven't got a job in the pros. Brooks intends to pick team players rather than individual stars. His assistant coach Craig Patrick (Noah Emmerich) is unconvinced. His marriage to Patti (Patricia Clarkson) suffers. He pushes his boys to the limit in training. With gas shortages and the new Iranian hostage crisis, there are few bright spots for America but this US team of underdogs will perform a miracle.This is a movie of great moments. There is nothing quite as compelling as the forced skate after tying the Norwegians. Kurt Russell is solid anchoring this movie. Maybe there's a limitation with the truth but this movie needs greater conflict. Somebody needs to be the villain who keeps threatening to take the team away from Herb. Also the players don't get enough attention. One player could be highlighted to fill out more drama. The players end up being all jumbo together. It would be nice to highlight one specific relationship of a player with Herb."
Mission: Impossible III,6,1,3,13 January 2014," JJ Abrams' super-agent Felicity and Bad obvious twist
","Ethan Hunt (Tom Cruise) is trying to live a normal life with his girlfriend Julia (Michelle Monaghan) who doesn't know his secret life. Ethan is now a trainer, but when his protégé Lindsey Farris (Keri Russell) is captured by weapons dealer Owen Davian (Philip Seymour Hoffman), he goes back into the field to rescue her.I really find it weird to see J.J. Abrams use Felicity as a secret agent. It looks silly, and I can't buy it. On top of that, PSH is not the most threatening villain. Nevertheless, the action is great. The big scene on the bridge with the drone is done quite well. The action scene of Cruise getting slammed into the car by the explosion is done beautifully. I still had high hopes for this, but then comes the twist.It's telegraphed a mile away. It starts with agency head (Laurence Fishburne) over reacting by imprisoning Ethan. It makes no sense since Ethan was the guy who caught Davian in the first place. There's obviously a mole, and Ethan is the last guy on the suspect list. Whoever the mole is would want Ethan to be out there getting the Rabbit's Foot. So when that guy helped Ethan escaped, he's the obvious mole. And him not knowing the capture plan for Davian just seals the case for moleship.The third act is just too silly. With all the action in the movie, the climax should be rocking action but it goes smaller. It's as if the movie just runs out of energy. We're supposed to be shocked by the reveal, but the twist was already obvious 15 minutes before. This movie had its moments, but it's not the best."
Lucky Number Slevin,6,4,8,27 December 2013," people I don't care about doing things I don't care about for reasons I don't want to know about
","No spoilers for this review. Instead of trying to unravel this convoluted plot, I'll say that it's trying very hard to be a cool noir mystery. Slevin (Josh Hartnett) is mistaken by a crime Boss (Morgan Freeman) for Nick who owes him $96k.Josh Hartnett doesn't strike me as a lead for this movie. He's too plain white bread in a sea of crazy wacky characters. He needs more presence of his own. This is a fast talking twisty complicated convoluted story. Everybody is talking a lot for the sake of talking a lot. The writer is trying to be too clever. By the end, it ends up being a whole lot of people I don't care about doing things I don't care about for reasons I don't want to know about. The twists, the reveals, none of it matters after awhile."
Requiem for a Dream,8,0,1,5 June 2014," Disturbing unique vision
","Four lives are disintegrating. Harry Goldfarb (Jared Leto) is a drug fiend who keeps pawning off his mother (Ellen Burstyn)'s TV. He and his druggie friend Tyrone C. Love (Marlon Wayans) wants to start selling drugs on their own. She is obsessed with TV infomercial personality Tappy Tibbons (Christopher McDonald). She gets a call about her winning a TV contest and she's so excited that she goes on a crash diet. Marion Silver (Jennifer Connelly) is Harry's girlfriend and she's pulled into his scheme.It's director Darren Aronofsky's second full length feature, and it shows that he has an unique vision. These are compelling characters in unforgettable stories. Ellen Burstyn is completely immersed into her role. Their slow descent is hard to take and hard to take my eyes off of. The use of quick cuts, fast forwards, and close ups all accentuate the disturbing nature of drugs. The use of SnorriCam which attached to the actors' bodies is probably the most memorable. It's all very disturbing."
Your Name.,7,2,2,20 November 2018," magical realism
","A comet is approaching. Mitsuha Miyamizu is a 17 year old high school girl in the small town of Itomori. Her dad is the mayor and she's tired of her small town life. Her friends complain about her behavior the day before but she doesn't remember. She wishes to be reborn as a boy in the big city. Her wish comes true as she wakes up in the body of high school student and part time waiter Taki. It's like a dream as they inhabit each other's body.The animation is beautiful. The story is imaginative. The characters are lovely and compelling. There is magical realism to the movie. The plot does get a little jumpy which does fit the style. I would be more interested if it's cleared up a bit more. The movie climaxes at the impact and it drags out the ending a bit. Taki should have encountered Mitsuha at that point. Her father could be dead and she would be on top of the hill tending his grave. The searching in Tokyo is poetic for a little while but at some point, I just wanted it to end the movie and the ending is never in doubt."
Captain Phillips,8,1,3,2 December 2013," More exciting than expected
","This is the true story of Captain Richard Phillips (Tom Hanks) and his ship MV Maersk Alabama captured by Somali pirates in 2009. Director Paul Greengrass has used his realism style like 'United 93' (2006) to good use. There is real excitement in this thriller even though we all know what the outcome will be.The movie starts off slowly. Tom Hanks getting ready to captain a cargo ship is about as exciting as Tom Hanks getting ready to captain a cargo ship. It lasts for about 15 minutes with some interruptions by the slightly more interesting Somali story.This is more compelling than one might expect. It doesn't try to whitewash the captain ignoring warnings. And the Somalis get as much screen time as anybody else. The leader is played by Barkhad Abdi who does a forceful job. He's more than a match for Tom Hanks. When he says 'I've come too far. I can't give up.', you can see his desperation. The movie is more than docudrama. It is a big time thriller."
Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace,6,1,2,20 April 2016," flawed CGI masterpiece
","The Trade Federation has a blockade against the planet Naboo. The Republic sends Jedi Master Qui-Gon Jinn (Liam Neeson) and his Padawan Obi-Wan Kenobi (Ewan McGregor) to negotiate an end. However, Sith Lord Darth Sidious orders the Federation to attack. Qui-Gon and Obi-Wan encounter Gungan outcast Jar Jar Binks on Naboo. They rescue Queen Padmé Amidala (Natalie Portman). Their ship is forced to land on the planet Tatooine where they meet slave child Anakin Skywalker.The general assessment is that this is a CGI masterpiece but there are many problems. Even its' biggest detractors can't deny that this movie has revolutionary CGI. It is a wonderland of computer magic. On the other hand, the acting is pretty bad even without Jar Jar. The exception is Liam Neeson. The man is an acting beast. Ewan McGregor is fine but Natalie Portman is lost. I have nothing against Jake Lloyd. The kid is expected to be too much and he can't deliver.Jar Jar is horrible. The Gungan leader is even worst. It is a poor gamble from the start but then it gets worst. The kiddie humor is all Lucas and it's all bad. Lucas has absolute power and he uses it to aim this at the younglings. Even in the terrific pod race, the kiddie humor infects the thrills. The humor is bad. On the opposite end, the good is the villain Darth Maul. He's a cool character. However, even that is done wrong in the end when both Darth Maul and Qui-Gon are gone from the prequels. By far, they are the best characters and Lucas sends them packing early in the prequel trilogy.Then there is the force. I never needed it to be explained. That's why the midi-chlorians are so awkward. None of that is needed. There is also the immaculate conception which is even more awkward. One can get inspiration from religion but Lucas shouldn't have copied from religion. There is also a general lack of tension throughout the movie. The expositions and conversations are stale. This is a minor disappointment."
Sucker Punch,6,3,8,22 September 2013," Visually stunning but nothing more
","Baby Doll (Emily Browning) has an abusive stepfather and she is sent  away to a mental institution to undergo a lobotomy. Then the movie goes  into Baby Doll's imagination as she and four other girls Sweet Pea  (Abbie Cornish), Rocket (Jena Malone), Blondie (Vanessa Hudgens), and  Amber (Jamie Chung) battle wild creations of her imaginations.  The base 'real' story is creepy, ugly and depressing. It had potential  but that's not the meat of this movie. Zack Snyder has created every  boys' fantasy with scantily clad girls doing acrobatics using big  weapons. That's the meat and it's visually stunning. Ultimately it's  all meaningless, and the being visually stunned only last so long. In  the end, this movie makes for great movie stills but not a great movie."
The Twilight Saga: Breaking Dawn - Part 1,4,5,6,7 September 2015," worthless except for fans
","Bella (Kristen Stewart) and Edwards (Robert Pattinson) get married gathering the disparate parts of their lives together. Jacob (Taylor Lautner) is not happy. On their honeymoon, Bella gets pregnant which is impossible. The baby grows abnormally fast and the wolf pack fears it as a threat.This is basically fan service. Of course, nobody has any reasons to watch this other than fans of the franchise. The first half hour is the wedding and it's not anything other than a few soap opera highlights. The second half hour is the honeymoon most notable for breaking the bed. When Bella gets pregnant, it becomes fully a soap opera. The baby is a little creepy like 'Rosemary's Baby'. This installment feels like it's mostly setting up for a big finale."
The Perks of Being a Wallflower,7,4,6,7 September 2013," Young Cast has Heart
","Charlie Kelmeckis (Logan Lerman) is a loner high school freshman with dark secrets. Luckily, unusual seniors Sam (Emma Watson) and her gay stepbrother Patrick (Ezra Miller) adopt him into their circle of friends. Mary Elizabeth (Mae Whitman) takes a liking to him and English teacher Mr. Anderson (Paul Rudd) takes an interest in his work.The group of friends have amazing chemistry. They give a sense of true friendship off-camera, and it shows on camera. The only minor observation is that Logan Lerman seems a little too old to play a High School freshman. He is suppose to be 3 years younger than the rest. Logan Lerman gives a great performance but sometimes it's harder to see him as that much younger. Emma Watson also gives a credible performance as a sweetheart, but she's missing the damaged core that the story implies. Ezra Miller has wonderful charisma.First time director Stephen Chbosky adapts his own book to the big screen. He does a surprisingly good job for a rookie. But at times, he seems to miss the big moments. Charlie suffers from blackouts, and sometimes the movie suffers from the same. Songs often ends abruptly, and some scenes are missing its big payoffs. There's a scene where the boys grab him into the bathroom, but he doesn't show any consequences. I get the sense that a more experienced director would be able to see the missing bits. Charlie goes nuts in a fight but the movie holds back the big money shots. The movie has really dark places to go. The tone starts off as a charming, cute coming of age movie. I think a brutal scene early on would set the movie off in a darker direction. If it wants to go there, it needs to start earlier. Overall, it's a heart breaker and a good effort for the first time director. The young cast gives an exceptional performance."

",Michelle (Mary Elizabeth Winstead) leaves her boyfriend Ben. She gets hit in a car crash. She wakes up injured and chained to a mattress. Howard Stambler (John Goodman) tells her that he saved her and an apocalyptic alien war has poisoned the air outside. Emmett DeWitt (John Gallagher Jr.) is the third person in the survival bunker.John Goodman is great playing against type as a creepy threatening guy. He's able to use his size to his advantage. The other two do well. It has some tension but I keep thinking it should be even higher. This is essentially a good solid B-movie with a souped-up third act. I would like for more claustrophobic paranoia but it delivers enough.
The Finest Hours,6,0,2,23 December 2016," good action thriller
","It's 1952 Chatham, Massachusetts. Coast Guard crewman Bernie Webber (Chris Pine) dates Miriam Pentinen (Holliday Grainger). He tries to get approval by his commander Daniel Cluff (Eric Bana) to marry Miriam. He always follows the rules. A storm roars in. The tanker SS Pendleton splits in half. Mild mannered engineer Ray Sybert (Casey Affleck) struggles to lead the men and drive the sinking stern onto a shoal. Cluff orders Bernie to take a small boat in a suicidal rescue mission.This is great adventure on the high seas. Sybert's side of the story is compelling. It has action and brains. It has great tension. Some of it unnecessarily gets a little melodramatic. The Bernie Miriam romance is even more melodramatic. The first act about their courting could easily be cut in half. Chris Pine is miscast. He's trying very hard to be shy and somewhat fails. He's not the type. His mannerisms don't work. His acting doesn't stretch that way. Overall, this is a sorta Perfect Storm with some problematic acting and melodrama."

","Dan Evans (Christian Bale) is an one-legged Civil War veteran. He lives on a dusty ranch with wife Alice (Gretchen Mol), sons William (Logan Lerman) and Mark. He owes money to Glen Hollander and his men burn down his barn. Hollander first steals his water and then steals his land for the coming railroad. Dan and his boys go to confront Hollander. Bandits led by Ben Wade (Russell Crowe) and Charlie Prince (Ben Foster) rob a heavily armed stage coach driven by Pinkerton Byron McElroy (Peter Fonda). The Evans boys come across the scene and robbed of their horses. Wade's gang stays at the town of Bisbee. Dan Evans means to shoot Hollander but helps capture Wade instead. The coach owner hires Dan for $200 as well as others to deliver Wade to prison. There's a train coming 3:10 to Yuma Prison.These are some terrific dark murky characters. Bale is absolutely amazing. Crowe needs slightly more menace. Foster is also terrific. The great thing about this movie is the murky morality of everybody. It's not just simple good and bad. Wade is not the stereotypical villain. Dan Evans is not just a straight forward white hat. He's stubborn but he's no hero in his regular life. He is desperate for money and pushed around by powerful men. The atmosphere is dripping with moody tension. It's brutal, violent and unforgiving."
The Sound of Music,9,2,8,29 November 2014," Great Iconic sing-a-long musical
","In pre-WWII Salzburg, Austria, the Mother Abbess doesn't know what to do with the flighty Maria (Julie Andrews). How do you solve a problem like Maria? Maria fearfully accepts being the governess to Captain Georg von Trapp (Christopher Plummer)'s seven children. The kids don't like her at first. She is the 12th in a long line of governesses. She eventually wins them over. The Captain is a widower who runs a cold strict household. The Baroness Elsa Schraeder (Eleanor Parker) accompanies him back from Vienna with singing producer Max Detweiler (Richard Haydn). However he starts to fall for the lovely governess and she for him. The jealous Baroness pushes her out of the way and the Captain asks the Baroness to marry him.Everybody is entitled to their opinion but I can't imagine anybody not appreciating the simple joy of this musical. The main objections seem to be the movie's departure from the real story. I don't know how much Nazism these critics want but it is a musical after all. Nobody is watching this for its authenticity. The songs are simply innocent fun. They are endlessly singable and Julie Andrews is the perfect Broadway ingénue with great screen presence. Christopher Plummer provides the compelling leading man. This is probably one of the best romantic musicals."
The Equalizer,6,8,12,6 March 2015," good start but fight in Home Depot disappoints
","Robert McCall (Denzel Washington) has a mysterious past and is trying to live the quiet life working at a Boston home improvement box store. He helps his co-worker Ralphie lose weight to get the security guard job. He's friendly with street walker Teri/Alina (Chloë Grace Moretz) whom he often meets as he reads at a local diner. She ends up in the hospital after getting severely beaten up by her pimp Slavi. He tries to buy her freedom but ends up killing everybody. Violent Russian gangsters come looking for payback.This starts well even with the cliché-filled script. Denzel can pull it off. Chloe is the innocent and he's the knight in shining armor. The problem starts when Chloe disappears after the first act. I expected her to be the second star and she deserves to be. She's good in this movie but it is strictly a solo act. The great brutal violence in Slavi's office is the highlight. The action slowly turns more and more cartoonish. Director Antoine Fuqua has made some great gritty action. I wish he brought a bit more 'Training Day'. Unfortunately, the last battle in the Home Mart reminds me too much of 'Home Alone'. There is something compelling about not showing what happened with the hammer. That's a great scene. It's a little more silly to see all the improvised traps in the store."
Ali,7,3,4,22 May 2014," Reasonable performance
","It's a biopic of the great boxer Muhammad Ali (Will Smith). It starts in 1964 when still as Cassius Clay defeats Sonny Liston for the heavyweight championship. Malcolm X (Mario Van Peebles) befriends the young fighter. He is outspoken, converts to Islam joining the Nation of Islam, and becomes the world wide icon. Jon Voight makes a nice turn as Howard Cosell.Muhammad Ali is such a big personality. Possibly nobody could ever do him justice. Certainly nobody could ever live up to the legend. Will Smith is probably the only one who could make the attempt. The fact that he didn't embarrass himself is a big win. It is a surprise that director Michael Mann made this movie. It doesn't have the kinetic energy of his other movies. It's such a dour performance. Will is playing it with simmering anger every second of the movie. He's great with Ali's voice, but it doesn't have any joy in it. Will is good hitting that same note over and over again. I just wish he hit other notes in his performance. 'When We Were Kings' is a superior movie for comparison. This is a good biopic not not much more."
The Expendables 2,7,1,4,17 August 2013," Another payday cashed
","Sylvester Stallone once again raid the action hero old age home to cash in on another big payday. You have to give him credit. It's a great idea and Sly made it happened. This time the cast list includes Sylvester Stallone, Jason Statham who is especially funny, Jet Li, Dolph Lundgren, Chuck Norris, Jean-Claude Van Damme as the bad guy, Bruce Willis, Arnold Schwarzenegger, Terry Crews, Randy Couture, and Liam Hemsworth. There is some great action, forgettable convoluted storyline, and a few fun joke attempts. It achieves exactly what it sets out to do. It's a forgettable light popcorn fun for 2 hours and nothing more."
War Dogs,8,0,0,25 March 2017," great work from Jonah Hill
","It's 2005 Miami. David Packouz (Miles Teller) is struggling as a masseuse. He reconnects with childhood friend Efraim Diveroli (Jonah Hill). Efraim has been buying guns from police auctions and reselling them online. There is a new government clearing house website for military contracts and he's looking to pick up some of the crumbs. David joins him after getting girlfriend Iz (Ana de Armas) pregnant. With dry cleaner Ralph Slutsky (Kevin Pollak) providing the capital, they start getting some contracts. Eventually, they meet unsavory arms dealer Henry Girard (Bradley Cooper) and get a massive Afghan deal.This is unlike Todd Phillips' more famed comedic movies. It's not big laughs but it is a lighter look at a darker world. Jonah Hill gets chubbier to fit this character perfectly. He is a douche but he is not a threatening douche. He has just enough crazy but not uncontrolled. His chemistry with Teller is terrific. This is a compelling story told in a compelling and engaging way. It's great all around and an overlooked gem."
The Longest Yard,6,1,2,5 January 2014," Chris Rock funny but not much else
","Paul Crewe (Adam Sandler) is a disgraced ex-football star. He has a fight with his girlfriend which leads a drunk driving chase. It lands him in prison for breaking his probation. He's personally requested by warden Hazen (James Cromwell) to help his prison guard football team. But guards Captain Knauer (William Fichtner) doesn't want him.Adam Sandler is playing calm which is unusual, but I just don't see him as a football player. He has good fun exchanges with the fast talking Chris Rock. Rock is funny, but not much else. The football silliness isn't that funny either. And the game goes on for far too long. This is a long movie considering the simple story."
Source Code,7,0,0,23 September 2013," Good thriller
","Colleen Goodwin (Vera Farmiga) and Dr. Rutledge (Jeffrey Wright) operate an experimental program where they insert Colter Stevens (Jake Gyllenhaal) into the last 8 minutes of somebody's life to investigate the cause of a train explosion. He searches for the bomber's identity and falls in love with one of the passengers, Christina Warren (Michelle Monaghan).There is a Groundhog Day feel to this, but it works quite well. They all feel a little bit differently. As for logic or believability of the premise, it's best not to dwell on it. The more you dwell, the more problems you'll find. It's better to let the thriller take over. The other good thing is Jake Gyllenhaal and Michelle Monaghan. They have good chemistry. This is a solid thriller."
Skyfall,8,1,6,8 August 2013," 1st half glossy 2nd half gritty
","James Bond (Daniel Craig) returns as 007. Raoul Silva (Javier Bardem) is the big villain. M (Judi Dench) is under pressure from Intelligence chairman Gareth Mallory (Ralph Fiennes). Bond returns to his past.The franchise is really hitting its stride with Daniel Craig. The first half is the glossy polished 007. The iconic scene is James Bond jumping onto a half demolished train. He lands solidly and slowly brush off his jacket then he catwalks off. It's all flash. Even when he's shot off the train and left for dead, then he returns as a weakened 007, the movie still churn out it glitzy wares. Then it truly turns as we see the iconic Aston Martin. It turns gritty. We lock ourselves into an isolated English mansion. The only thing I find odd is the Home Alone booby traps. They should leave that improvised weapons to the comedies. Overall, this is a high point of the recent Bonds."
50 First Dates,7,2,2,17 November 2013," good chemistry
","Henry Roth (Adam Sandler) is a lying, womanizing, veterinarian in Hawaii. He meets Lucy Whitmore (Drew Barrymore) and falls for her right away. Only Lucy is suffering from short term memory loss and can't remember him the next day.Sandler and Barrymore make for a lovely couple especially for a rom-com. I just don't understand why Sandler feels it necessary to push his character into unlikeable territory. Why does he have to be so sleazy? And can Rob Schneider get any more annoying? The only good thing from Schneider is that hilarious Happy Gilmore swing.Adam Sandler is relatively under control in this movie. He should just be a nice guy who meets a nice girl. Drew has her part down perfectly. Adam has it in him to play the nice moral guy."
The Young Victoria,7,1,1,23 May 2016," solid historical drama
","Queen Victoria (Emily Blunt) was born in 1819 and gains the crown in 1838 after her uncle King William IV (Jim Broadbent)'s death. One year earlier, she is controlled by her mother Duchess of Kent (Miranda Richardson) and her husband Sir John Conroy (Mark Strong). They want her to sign over her powers by declaring a regency. King Leopold of Belgium wants to secure the crown by sending his nephew Prince Albert (Rupert Friend) to seduce Victoria. She falls under the influence of Prime Minister Lord Melbourne (Paul Bettany).This is a solid historical drama with Emily Blunt bringing a solid performance. In the end, it is more of a history lesson that needs more drama to make it compelling. It's a stoic biopic. Quebecois director Jean-Marc Vallée does a competent job bringing out the regal palatial glow. The story needs to zero in on the essential relationship that it wants to bring out. I'm not sure Albert is the most compelling although it's the easiest for a historical romance. I would have liked to see Victoria through Melbourne's eyes instead."
Catch Me If You Can,7,1,3,10 November 2013," light hearted romp
",Frank Abagnale Jr. (Leonardo DiCaprio) is a con man with a colorful career and father issues. Carl Hanratty (Tom Hanks) is the FBI agent who doggedly hound Frank.Director Steven Spielberg has instilled a sense of play in this true story. He could have made this a more intense thriller. But it ends up being a light hearted romp. I'm not deducting points for that. It's a choice Spielberg made for this movie.Leo has all the fun. He is that guy. He is the suave playboy who can get all the girls base solely on his charm. This was probably happening even before he made a name for himself. Leo is Frank Abagnale Jr.Tom Hanks is a little different. I am unconvinced that he is that guy. Tom is more light hearted and it adds to that prevailing sense. Would you be truly scared to be chased by Tom Hanks? No! He's my accountant.Overall it's a light weight entry in Spielberg's list of accomplishments. Nobody will put this in the highlight reels for him but it's a good fun watch.
The Hangover,8,2,4,20 September 2013," Great chemistry
","Phil (Bradley Cooper), Stu (Ed Helms), and Alan (Zach Galifianakis) wake up in Las Vegas hotel room with no memory of what happened the night before during their bachelor party. The problem is they lost the bachelor Doug (Justin Bartha).There's a tiger, a bunch of pictures, and a baby. All that is fun flashing lights, but it's the chemistry of the three that makes this movie. Zach Galifianakis' breakout performance is hilarious. But it means nothing if Bradley Cooper and Ed Helms wasn't there. Bradley is a great leading man, and Ed is able to balance out Zach.Director Todd Phillips really had the group humming. He has built up a nice resume of funny comedies. Also Ken Jeong literally jumps out onto the world."
Ghost,8,0,2,2 October 2013," Movie classic
","Sam (Patrick Swayze) and Molly (Demi Moore) are a happy loving couple. Molly wants to get marry, but Sam just can't seem to say I love you. All he could come up with is Ditto. One night he gets shot in a mugging. He's trapped as a ghost when he refused to go into the light. The mugger breaks into their apartment, and Molly's life is again in danger. Tony Goldwyn plays their friend and Sam's co-worker. Whoopi Goldberg plays a medium that Sam tries to communicate with.This movie has elements of romance and thriller. It doesn't get more romantic than the pot making sequence. It's almost too iconic in movie history for its own good. Sam's murder provides the mystery thriller. And Whoopi injects a little bit of controlled humor. The movie is now a classic."
Iron Man 3,7,2,3,16 April 2014," Great fun and a compelling Tony Stark
","Back in 1999, Tony Stark (Robert Downey Jr.) meets up with Maya Hansen (Rebecca Hall) who is working on her bio project. It would simply be an one night stand and he would also blow off Aldrich Killian (Guy Pearce). The two of them would come back to cause trouble in the present. In the present, Stark is haunted by the battle of NY and is suffering sleepless nights and panic attacks. Pepper Potts (Gwyneth Paltrow) is now CEO. Colonel James Rhodes (Don Cheadle)'s suit has been renamed Iron Patriot. And there is a new terror menace named The Mandarin (Ben Kingsley).I love the fact that Stark is suffering from the battle of NY. The sarcastic humor is funnier than ever. In this one, Stark even picks up a funny boy sidekick. His character is deeper than ever. If there is one problem with the movie, Stark is too often without his suits. It makes the ending less reasonable. But the ending is chalk full of explosive fun, and I'm willing to ignore any minor problems."
Marie Antoinette,6,0,0,19 July 2016," more costume than drama
","In 1768, Marie Antoinette (Kirsten Dunst) is a young princess in Austria. Her mother sets her to marry the future French king Louis XVI (Jason Schwartzman). She is naive and inexperienced in the ways of the Versailles court. There is King Louis XV of France (Rip Torn), his mistress Madame du Barry (Asia Argento), and Comtesse de Noailles (Judy Davis). The Dauphin is distant and Marie struggles to connect with him. They are not sexual and she's under pressure to give an heir to the throne.Sofia Coppola delivers a bright, light Marie Antoinette. She's very modern. There is some nice tension as the pressure builds for a baby. The movie fades away after that as France falls into revolution. Dunst is better as the young teen more than the older queen. The movie has the costumes but the drama isn't always there."
Child 44,5,2,3,3 January 2016," dark, twisted, confused serial-murder police-state drama
","Leo Demidov (Tom Hardy) was an Ukrainian orphan from Stalin instituted famine. He's given the name Leo. He's an MGB officer. His underling Vasili (Joel Kinnaman) is an unstable fanatic. His comrade Alexei's son is murdered and left at the rail-yards. Stalin had declared murder as a capitalist disease and the murder is classified as an accident. More child killings keep surfacing. Meanwhile Leo's wife Raisa (Noomi Rapace) is accused of treason. Leo refuses to denounce her and they're banished to Volsk. Leo works under General Mikhail Nesterov (Gary Oldman) and he discovers child murders all along the rail line.I really like 'Gorky Park'. This is darker, deeper and more confused. I like some bits here and there. Raisa's twist really surprised me and it does break down the flow of the movie. I like that she spotted the illiterate guard checking papers. However the movie moves to too many place. The last act goes off the rails. It turns into a Bourne movie. The last confrontation is the last straw. It tries too hard to get to a happy ending. In the end, I won't be recommending this by a slim margin."
The Ring,8,0,1,26 April 2014," Well made horror
","This starts with Becca (Rachael Bella) and Katie (Amber Tamblyn) watching a scary movie. There is an urban legend of a haunted videotape. After watching it, the person gets a phone call claiming that person will have only 7 days to live. It's a classic horror movie intro right down to the girls' school uniforms. It works surprisingly well for such a try and true setup.Rachel (Naomi Watts) is a single-mom reporter with a troubled son Aidan (David Dorfman) who lost his close cousin Katie recently. Rachel decides to help out by investigating the mysterious death. Only the mystery deepens when she gets a hold of the tape. She watches it and receives the creepy call from Samara (Daveigh Chase) telling her '7 days'.The movie is able to carry the classic horror styles all the way through. It maintains the creepiness from the well made opening. Everything from the set design to the actual tape is made with the same creepy vibe. It also delivers something new to this genre. The Japanese original started the idea but this is a better made film. Even washing out the colors with blueish green creates its own unique creepiness. Naomi Watts is just so compelling, and David Dorfman looks so sickly. And the use of the ring motif also works. Just about everything works."
Raiders of the Lost Ark,10,2,4,25 December 2013," cinematic greatness
","Indiana Jones (Harrison Ford) is an action adventurer college professor. His nemesis is Dr. Belloq (Paul Freeman). When his mentor Ravenwood disappears, the American government recruits Indy in a race against Belloq working for Hitler to find the legendary Ark of the Covenant. They fear the Ark as an invincible weapon. He travels to Nepal to find Ravenwood where he is joined by old flame Marion Ravenwood (Karen Allen).Steven Spielberg and George Lucas collaborate on one of the most fun franchise ever made. It is a return to an old fashion action adventure. This has all the right ingredients, and the master chefs to put them all together. It has a great action hero with Ford at his best. He is basically a book smart Han Solo. There is the sassy love interest. Add in all the fun action they could shake a stick at. Mix it all together with expert hands, and it becomes cinematic magic. It also doesn't hurt to get a win over the Nazis."
Spartacus,10,1,3,17 August 2013," Iconic masterpiece
","It's 1st century BC. Rome is corrupt and functions by slavery. Spartacus (Kirk Douglas) is forced to be a gladiator in a school run by Lentulus Batiatus (Peter Ustinov). He falls for a slave named Varinia (Jean Simmons). He leads a revolt against his Roman masters as more slaves join. Educated slave Antoninus (Tony Curtis) joins them. They are opposed by Roman armies and Senator Marcus Licinius Crassus (Laurence Olivier).Stanley Kubrick created a masterpiece. It's not only a great movie but it's influential. It's iconic. The acting power is off the charts. The legendary names would easily make it to the pantheon of acting. The scale of production is massive. It's grand in the old Hollywood sense. It fits its ambition. The story is about a gladiator revolt that turn into a slave revolt that turn into an all out war. It has some great iconic movie scenes. When the slaves each claim the name Spartacus, this becomes more than a simply great movie. It is movie history. It is a must see."
Deepwater Horizon,7,0,1,26 March 2017," compelling real life disaster
","It's April 2010 in the Gulf of Mexico. Deepwater Horizon is an exploration oil rig hired by BP oil to drill a well in the deep ocean floor. Jimmy Harrell (Kurt Russell) is the supervisor and Mike Williams (Mark Wahlberg) is the chief technician of Deepwater Horizon. BP managers Donald Vidrine (John Malkovich) and Robert Kaluza (Brad Leland) are cutting corners and canceling vital tests. They push the delayed schedule which leads to a big explosion and environmental devastation.The action, the true-life story, and the characters are all very compelling. I rarely wish for more expositions but the film could use some to lay out the ocean oil drilling operation. Peter Berg tries to do a little with the can of soda. The film is not actually confusing but a detailed explanation could help lay down the foundation. This is more of an action thriller. The crew of the Deepwater Horizon is left blameless while BP and the two managers are made as the sole villains. I don't disapprove but it's a little simplistic. Overall, this would be a good disaster movie even if it's fictional."
Resident Evil: Afterlife,5,0,2,17 November 2013," Story rambles on and on and on
","I think they're just stuffing too much into the movie. Alice (Milla Jovovich) follows the survivors to Alaska where she finds Claire (Ali Larter) with memory lost and they fly down the west coast and find survivors on a highrise in LA and they attempt to get to safe haven ship called Acadia off the coast and find survivors in cryosleep and battle infected super Wesker (Shawn Roberts).The story gets too convoluted. It needs to slow down and stop going all over the place. While Ali Larter is back, I don't understand why Spencer Locke couldn't be included. She's in the movie anyways. Why not keep her with Ali Larter for the whole movie? The action looks great as always. I love the giant axe wielding monster. He looks beautiful. Somebody just needs to clean up the story to make it flow better."
Stop-Loss,6,0,0,15 September 2016," interesting performances
","Brandon King (Ryan Phillippe) and his men get caught in an ambush in Tikrit, Iraq. Several are killed in the incident. King returns home to Texas as a hero. Senator Orton Worrell promises to care for his injured comrade Rodriguez. His friend Steve Shriver (Channing Tatum) shows signs of PTSD scaring his fiancée Michelle (Abbie Cornish). Tommy Burgess (Joseph Gordon-Levitt) is drunk and gets thrown out by his wife. Brandon, Tommy and Steve report back to the military. Brandon is surprised to be stop-loss. He is ordered back to Iraq despite expecting to be discharged. He goes AWOL. Along with Michelle, he heads for D.C. to get help from Senator Worrell.There are a few interesting performances but the movie takes on too much. It needs more scenes of quiet character development and concentrate on fewer people. Not everything has to be issues about being a soldier. It pushes a little too hard when King goes super-soldier on those thieves. There's probably a better and simpler movie in here."
United 93,10,0,1,18 September 2015," I couldn't stop shaking
","The terrorists prepare themselves and on September 11, 2001, they board United Airlines Flight 93 departing from Newark to San Francisco. As they prepare to take off, planes are being hijacked. Chaos break out in air traffic control. Once in the air, the first plane crashes into the World Trade Center. Four hijackers take over United 93 as confusion spreads. The passengers calling from the plane surmise the hijackers' plan and try to retake the aircraft.I saw it in a theater back in the day. Honestly, I couldn't stop shaking as I left. I had to take a few seconds before I start the car. It's almost ten years since then. 9/11 grows further into the distant past. Watching it again, I thought some of its power may have dissipated. I got a little blasÃ© about it initially and then the terrorists break into the cockpit. The intensity comes flooding back. I'm shaking once again. I think the growing distance from the actual event has diminished the anxiety but it may always be there. Director Paul Greengrass is able to bring all of it out onto the surface."
Deja Vu,6,0,1,20 September 2014," Cool sci-fi idea on paper
",A ferry filled with USS Nimitz sailors and families is blown up in New Orleans during Mardi Gras. ATF agent Doug Carlin (Denzel Washington) investigates the suspected terrorist attack. They find the body of Claire Kuchever (Paula Patton) who seems to be killed before the bombing. FBI Agent Jack McCready (Bruce Greenwood) is in charge. Carlin's partner's car is left in the ferris' parking lot and ends up in the investigation. Agent Pryzwarra (Val Kilmer) brings him into a new experimental FBI unit called Snow White run by scientist Dr. Alexander Denny (Adam Goldberg) who uses spacefolding to see events 4 days 6 hours into the past. Carlin suspects that he can change history.This is a great sci-fi idea and I imagine that it would make a great book. However it's biggest difficulty is to make a bunch of people sitting around watching a monitor as something exciting. The sad truth is that it's not exciting no matter how well director Tony Scott films it. He is probably the only one capable of energizing that room with kinetic power. However even he has his limits to his fast quick edits flashing sound-and-fury style. It's noticeable that the drive in the middle of the movie is derived almost exclusively from Tony Scott trying to make watching computer screens exciting.
E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial,9,2,5,21 December 2013," Still one of the greats
","An alien being is left behind when his compatriots take off without him. He is hounded by humans but he escapes. Elliott (Henry Thomas) is a 10 year old boy with a rambunctious family. He finds the little alien hiding in the woods behind his family home. Nobody believes him. Not his single mother (Dee Wallace), not his older brother (Robert MacNaughton), nor his cute little sister (Drew Barrymore).Spielberg got the visual style with the beautifully shot backyard with the light streaming from the shed. He's got the emotional touch with the boy and alien relationship. And he's got the comedic touch with Drew screaming at the alien. This is a beautifully put together story. Henry Thomas' performance draws you into his character. The pacing is good. The camera work is thoroughly modern. The jokes are still funny. The emotional payoff is still powerful. It is a modern classic.I watched the redux version again recently, and it's interesting to see the intention of Spielberg with a CGI alien. I do miss the animatronic ET sometimes. And sure there are the minutia of gun or no gun controversy. But the story still remains. And that's the best part of the movie."
It,8,6,13,12 September 2017," not super scary but very well made
","It's 1988 in the small town of Derry, Maine. Bill Denbrough makes a paper boat for little brother Georgie. Georgie plays with it in the rain and it floats down into the sewers. He encounters Pennywise (Bill Skarsgård) and we're off. Bill faces the loss of Georgie with his friends Richie Tozier, Eddie Kaspbrak, and Stanley Uris. They are bullied along with new kid Ben Hanscom, home-schooled Mike Hanlon, and abused girl Beverly Marsh. There is a series of missing kids and Ben may have uncovered the disturbing cause.I am not a reader but I did watch the mini-series many years ago (not as a kid). It struck me right away that it obviously needed to be split into two movies. The kids' side could be a great horror and I didn't care for the adults' side that much. It's a decade later and they've made the kids' part of the novel. There are two trailers which really caught everybody's eye and peaked my interest.This is like a darker and more brutal Goonies or more likely, a Stand By Me with more gore. It's not a slasher torture porn. It's not super scary but that's not the objective. Honestly, I laughed more than I was scared. It is surprisingly rather funny. It is super well made. Even the cinematography is beautiful. The kids have amazing chemistry. Each one is an individual. They are fun together and natural. Their stories are honest and brutal. This version of Pennywise is creepy and much more a monster than the teasetastic Tim Curry. There are jump scares but the movie does not rely on them. They aren't that big anyways and the one with Beverly is already given away in the trailer. I would put this comfortably on the same level as the two iconic coming-of-age movies previously mentioned."
Hereditary,6,3,5,1 September 2018," intriguing
","Annie Graham (Toni Collette) delivers the eulogy at her mother's funeral. She makes scaled miniature models. She has her husband Steve (Gabriel Byrne), son Peter (Alex Wolff), and daughter Charlie (Milly Shapiro). She befriends Joan (Ann Dowd) from her support group. Her family has issues which come to a head after a deadly accident.This horror sets a solid sullen mood and then it turns crazy supernatural. The first half slightly bores me. I find it hard to get invested in these characters. Toni is acting her butt off and I almost don't care. I really need to get involved with Peter but his weirdness doesn't intrigue me. I wonder if I could connect with him if he isn't shot in such an ugly manner. I totally understand the descent into hell but it's not as harrowing with a character that I'm only marginally invested. This has potential. It actually took me two attempts to watch this. I had to abandon the first attempt after a half hour because my attention was just drifting. I knew I needed to give it my best effort and it paid off with an intriguing movie."
Casablanca,9,1,5,4 October 2014," Movie romanticism at its best
","Casablanca is a desperate place during WWII. Refugees escaping the Nazis travel a back route through Casablanca to Lisbon and then to the free world. Some can go no further than the French colony which is home to scoundrels, smugglers, double dealers, and freedom fighters. Rick Blaine (Humphrey Bogart) is a world wearied expat American who runs a popular nightspot Rick's. He sticks his neck out for nobody. Captain Louis Renault (Claude Rains) leads the local police. He's eager to catch the underground leader Victor Laszlo to please the Germans. Ugarte (Peter Lorre) is a sweaty people-smuggler who is selling 2 letters of transit stolen from 2 German couriers. He gives the valuable letters for Rick to hide. Much to Rick's surprise, Lazslo arrives with his old flame Ilsa Lund (Ingrid Bergman).It's hard to quantify everything that is so great about this movie. Bogie as the Rick is one of those movie icons that transcends even the movie world. The desperation is well projected. This is melodrama of the highest order and the best of the genre. Sometimes movies come along at the right time. This is a propaganda film at the perfect time where the theme of sacrifice hit hardest. This is the standard bearer for movie romanticism as much as Romeo and Juliet for plays. Some can complain about Paul Henreid's stiffness as Laszlo but that's the point of his character. Some others can complain about the effects but that's missing the point of the movie entirely. Some can complain about all the clichés, and I agree that this movie is one big cliché. So what? In the end, this is a movie that deserves every bit of its iconic status."
Abraham Lincoln: Vampire Hunter,6,0,1,1 September 2013," The Title says it all
","The title says it all. You get not just the plot, but the style and the tone. Abraham Lincoln (Benjamin Walker) is not only a vampire hunter, but his life has been defined by vampires for a long time. His mother was killed by a vampire. As a young man, he tries to seek revenge but fails. But in the process, he meets Henry Sturgess (Dominic Cooper) who teaches him how to kill a vampire. During the Civil War as President of the United States, he comes to realize that vampires are fighting with the Confederate forces. As a result he mounts his own campaign to defeat them.Benjamin Walker is not big enough to anchor this movie. For the lead, they really should have gotten a bigger name and a more compelling actor. There was some really slow moments in the middle, but a vampire threw a horse.... A HORSE. That's worth the money to see for the right audience. This is a ridiculous concept. It could have more fun moments like the horse."
Who Framed Roger Rabbit,9,3,3,4 June 2015," great marriage of cartoon and hard-boiled noir
","Roger Rabbit is a distracted Toon performer in the Maroon Cartoon studio. R.K. Maroon hires Toon-hating private detective Eddie Valiant (Bob Hoskins) to investigate Jessica Rabbit and break up their relationship once and for all. Toons supposedly killed Eddie's brother. A private company called Cloverleaf buys up the public transit Red Car. Bartender Dolores (Joanna Cassidy) is an old friend. At the nightclub to see Jessica perform, Eddie photographs Jessica playing pattycake with the owner of Toontown Marvin Acme. Roger Rabbit is distraught and when Marvin Acme turns up dead, he's the prime suspect. Creepy Judge Doom (Christopher Lloyd) intends on tracking down the Rabbit and bringing order to Toontown with the use of his dip. Acme supposed to have a Will leaving Toontown to the Toons. Eddie starts finding evidence of wrong-doing as he investigates.This is a great marriage between the cartoon world and an old style hard-boiled detective story. The only problem is that future live-action animation never lived up to the imagination and shear audacity of this work. The genre becomes mostly kids movies. This is great for kids and for adults who see the influence of classic noirs like Chinatown in this. Bob Hoskins is a great unconventional lead and Jessica Rabbit is the breakout cartoon character."
One Hundred and One Dalmatians,7,3,3,10 December 2014," Short and sweet
","Pongo was a carefree bachelor in London and then he decided that his pet Roger Radcliffe needed a mate. Pongo is a dalmatian. Then he spots Perdita walking with her human Anita. Anita's fur-loving friend Cruella takes a fancy to the 15 dalmatian pups. When Roger refuses to sell the puppies, Cruella hires thugs Jasper and Horace to kidnap the pups. They overpower Nanny and then hold up in a crumbling mansion with other dalmatian puppies. There are 99 puppies in total.Let's face it. Cruella De Vil is one of the more outlandish Disney villains. She isn't scary as much as silly. The movie opens with a fun rom-com story. I like the narration by Pongo. The movie stalls a little in the middle after the puppies have been stolen while the dogs haven't started on their search. It's a pretty short movie which is a good thing because it doesn't overstay its welcome."
Minority Report,8,0,0,25 May 2014," Amazing concept well made by master filmmaker
","It's 2054. Crime has been virtually eliminated from Washington D.C. area due to the Department of Precrime. They use three Pre-cogs to predict future crimes and arrest the criminals before any crime actually happens. John Anderton (Tom Cruise) investigates the precrimes. However one day, the Pre-Cogs predict that Anderton will murder and the system is now coming after him. He kidnaps the most powerful pre-cog Agatha (Samantha Morton) and discovers a flaw in the system. Federal agent Danny Witwer (Colin Farrell) is on the manhunt as Anderton tries to prove he's innocent of a crime he's yet to commit.The concept of free will vs determinism from Philip K. Dick is amazing. The production from Steven Spielberg is terrific. The movie is so well made that it maintains its tension with all the crazy ideas being thrown at the audience. Tom Cruise is the perfect protagonist for this movie. He has a touch of that boy scout with a dark edge. He matches the intensity of the material. There is a good mystery, compelling performances, and expertly made all growing out of a great story. It does wrap up a little too neatly. I'm not sure a Spielberg movie could have gone that dark."
Finding Neverland,8,0,0,26 October 2013," Wonderful Johnny Depp
","It's London 1903, J.M. Barrie's (Johnny Depp) latest play is a flop. On an idyllic day in the park, he befriends widower Sylvia Llewelyn Davies (Kate Winslet) and her four boys. The youngest being Peter (Freddie Highmore). Sylvia's mother Mrs. Emma du Maurier (Julie Christie) disapproves of her independence, and truly disapproves of her friendship with Barrie. JM's wife Mary (Radha Mitchell) isn't much happier. She'd hope to social climb upon Mrs. du Maurier's standings but in the end, she can't take being left out.This is a wonderfully sweet movie. Sure a lot of it has been changed from the real history. That really doesn't matter in the least bit. I love the dog. I love the beds. I love all that stuff. It's great to see Johnny Depp in a more reserved role. He is more than wacky characters, and has wonderful chemistry with the kids. It's a gentle family movie for everyone."
If I Stay,6,0,0,16 May 2015," teen melodrama of life and death
","Mia Hall (Chloë Grace Moretz) is a cellist. Adam Wilde is a locally-known indie rocker and the new kid in school. He falls for Mia hard. Her best friend is Kim Schein (Liana Liberato). She's stressed about getting into Juilliard. Her parents (Mireille Enos, Joshua Leonard) are formerly alternative folks. They talk her into a family outing on a snow day and they get into an accident.Chloë Grace Moretz puts her incalculable charms at work. She brings as much life as possible to the rather conventional young adult melodrama. The romance doesn't have the best chemistry. It would help if Jamie Blackley is a more compelling actor. The flashback structure doesn't have enough drama to offer. The movie slowly runs out of story rather than build to a climax. The only question is whether she lives or dies. Their relationship is never in question and it has no real mystery to reveal."
Lifeboat,8,0,0,17 August 2014," Tense
","A ship is sunk by a German torpedo but before sinking, they fire on the submarine and sinks it. Famous journalist Constance Porter (Tallulah Bankhead) is sitting in the lifeboat by herself. Then others are pulled in. John Kovac worked in the engine room. Sparks Garett (Hume Cronyn) operated the radio. Alice MacKenzie (Mary Anderson) is an Army nurse. C.J. Rittenhouse (Henry Hull) is the wealthy industrialist. Willi (Walter Slezak) is a German who insists that he's just a crewman in the U-boat. Joe Spencer (Canada Lee) is a negro steward rescuing Mrs. Higgins (Heather Angel) and her baby but the baby doesn't survive. Gus Smith (William Bendix) was Schmit but changed his name because of the war.Director Alfred Hitchcock is putting a bunch of people in a small space under pressure. It was probably controversial for portraying a German as a real human being during wartime. It didn't help that he was so smart. His character is so mesmerizing and memorable. It is very tense and doesn't let up. The tight space restricts movement and forces the people to be on top of each other. The constant rolling in the sea can cause a bit of nausea. That's really the only problem I have. This is quite a ride."
G.I. Jane,6,8,13,20 January 2015," Demi Moore goes hard core
","Senator DeHaven (Anne Bancroft) pressures the Navy to be gender blind. They accept as long as a woman test case can measure up to the men's standards. They figure on the U.S. Navy Combined Reconnaissance Team which has a 60% wash out rate. DeHaven picks Lieutenant Jordan O'Neil (Demi Moore) out of the approved candidates for her looks. Command Master Chief John James Urgayle (Viggo Mortensen) is their trainer. She has to overcome expectations, sexism, politics and the pressure of the program to succeed.There is nothing surprising or original in this movie. It's got all the training and director Ridley Scott is an expert at jazzing up those 'action' scenes. The most compelling originality comes from Demi Moore shaving her hair. I do have to say that she looks fierce with the bald head. She looks fierce generally and Scott has her exercising up a storm. The movie probably needs some of the other characters to step up but nobody can ever be on the same level as Demi."
Training Day,8,2,2,18 August 2015," The power of Denzel
",LAPD narcotics detective Alonzo Harris (Denzel Washington) takes rookie detective Jake Hoyt (Ethan Hawke) on his training day. Alonzo is a harsh spoken street-wise cop pushing the envelop in South Central L.A. Mostly he goes right over the edge.This is all Denzel all the time. It's his relentless power. There's no logic or plot worthy of following. That's not the point of this movie. The audience is Ethan Hawke as he tries at first to submit to the Denzel hurricane. Then we're trying gather our feet in the storm. Finally we have to make a decision about his character. This is a tour-de-force performance from Denzel and nothing less.

","It's 1967 Detroit. A police raid escalates into a full blown riot. National Guard is called in. The local police is dominantly a white force. A black singing group is forced to cancel their show and they spend the night at the Algiers Motel where they meet a couple of white girls. Policeman Philip Krauss (Will Poulter) shoots a man in the back who manages to escape. When the man is later found dead, murder charges are recommended against Krauss. Despite that, he's allowed to continue his patrol. Melvin Dismukes (John Boyega) is a grocery store security guard trying to keep the peace when a National Guard squad arrives. Sounds of gunfire from the Algiers put the group in heightened fear as everybody descend on the motel looking for a sniper.This is a harrowing true tale directed by Kathryn Bigelow. John Boyega and his character is great. Baby-faced Will Poulter delivers a compelling villain. His partner is more the traditional greasy haired racist. The band is solid with a great lead performance by Algee Smith. I do have a problem with Carl who plays the clown very broadly. I have some issues with certain moments but the whole night is a harrowing tale well told. Dismukes being arrested is a great sequence. However, the trial can get a little repetitive. I prefer the ending to wrap up quicker. With such a tough film, it's hard to sit through the extended closing act."
In Bruges,8,0,0,31 December 2015," funny black comedy
","London hit men Ray (Colin Farrell) and Ken (Brendan Gleeson) are sent to Bruges, Belgium to hid out by their boss Harry Waters (Ralph Fiennes). Ray had accidentally killed an innocent child. Ken takes in the sights but Ray would rather drink and go home. They encounter a film crew with a racist midget and Ray falls for Chloe Villette (Clémence Poésy). Ken is conflicted after Harry contacts him with the new orders.It's funny and dark. Martin McDonagh has filled his film with a black comedic tone. Farrell fills it with his fidgety energy and troubled humanity. He's also hilarious delivering McDonagh's sharp insane dialog. One is never sure if Farrell is going to say something funny or hit somebody over the head or both. Gleeson provides the solid foundation."

","Based on Bissinger's book, Odessa is a small dusty town in Texas. There is only one thing that is important to the people of this town. It's their high school football team winning State. Coach Gaines (Billy Bob Thornton) is new to the team. The pressure is unbearable. In the last moments of the first game, their star running back Boobie Miles (Derek Luke) gets severely injured. The team struggles without him.This is a movie where there is a real sense of place. The characters are realistic. They are aggressively realistic. There are no easy saints. The kids all struggle. Tim McGraw plays a drunken father. Amber Heard has a small debut part as a sexualized teen. Lucas Black is wonderful as the stoic quarterback trying to take care of his mother. It is modern day poetry."

","John Wick (Keanu Reeves) is a reformed assassin but his beloved who reformed him has died. After her death, she sends him a dog to love. Then the impetuous Iosef (Alfie Allen), son of mob boss Viggo Tarasov (Michael Nyqvist), steals his car and kills his dog. Iosef doesn't know what he's gotten himself into. Viggo tries to kill John and places a $2 million contract on him. He gets John's old colleges Marcus (Willem Dafoe) to agree. John goes to the Continental hotel where assassins congregate and nobody is allowed to do business. John finds Iosef there while Viggo doubles the reward to break the house rule. Ms. Perkins (Adrianne Palicki) takes him up on his offer.Keanu Reeves has become an expert in playing this type of characters. There are great looking action. The best is his fight with Palicki. It's all amazingly shoot. The simple story is better than most with some nice touches. I do have a couple of small problems with the plot. I don't like that he kept missing Iosef in the hotel because he had shown that he almost never misses. I don't mind not killing Iosef so early. He just needs to scamper away before the shooting starts. I also don't understand why Wick doesn't get reprimanded by the hotel. That kind of stuff does bug me a little but overall, it's a fun action movie."

To the dismay of the Furious Five and Master Shifu, Po is picked the Dragon Warrior. Po is chubby, and inexperienced. When the powerful Tai Lung escapes from prison, everybody must battle to save the valley.The animation looks great. Importantly, the characters are fun. Jack Black sets the tone, and he's perfect as Po. He's played the bumbling good nature fool before in other movies. As a cartoon character, he even more lovable.The story is fairly predictable. It's really straight forward. The script doesn't have the modern references so prevalent today. It's not the most impressive part of the movie.However the action is energetic. Po is hilarious. And the animation is cute. That's what makes this stand out among so many animated movie."

",JJ 'Jake' Gittes (Jack Nicholson) is a tough private detective. A woman (Diane Ladd) claiming to be Water and Power Chief Engineer Hollis Mulwray's wife wants him to investigate her cheating husband. Hollis opposes the new dam. Jake is able to get pictures of Hollis and a blonde. It gets on the front page of the papers. The real wife Evelyn Mulwray (Faye Dunaway) confronts Jake and plans to sue. Then Hollis is found dead at the reservoir.Director Roman Polanski creates such a great hard-boiled noir feel. He takes an obscure subject and makes it fascinating. Nicholson is terrific as someone not so reputable. Polanski makes a fun cameo. There are some incredible scenes and iconic lines. It's funny at times. It's always compelling. It defines greatness for a specific era.
Rocketman,7,2,2,13 July 2019," Mamma Mia!
","Elton John (Taron Egerton) is flamboyantly dressed as he walks into a group rehab session. He recounts his search for love, his life, his music, and his fame. His search for love starts with his cold parents. He finds a brother in song writing partner Bernie Taupin (Jamie Bell). In LA, he is taken with the dashing John Reid who eventually takes over his business as his manager. Reid turns out to be a ruthless taskmaster and a callous ex-lover. Elton's life spirals downwards until his drug use hits rock bottom.It's a surreal musical bio of pop icon Elton John. The central theme of finding love is a powerful one for him. In a way, this movie falls into a trap. Elton has so many great hits that it's too tempting to do a Mamma Mia!. They use the songs to project every turn of his life. It concentrates more as a musical. It could have been more powerful emotionally as a darker bio-film. It should be a movie of Elton and Bernie. Every time the movie has a chance of achieving emotional tension, it decides to do a song. While it worked well for the first half, it becomes somewhat tied down by its surrealist musical style. The best use of the songs seem to be Elton writing them or the crass producer rejecting Elton's biggest hits. That part is a bit funny. Egerton has the feel of a sad clown. I wonder if Jamie Bell would work better as Elton. The movie does achieve an emotional punch in the end and that's a great moment. I do like this movie but I also question whether a more compelling telling is possible."
A Star Is Born,7,7,12,27 November 2018," solid remake
","Famous singing star Jackson Maine (Bradley Cooper) is tired, alcoholic, and slowly losing his hearing. His older brother and manager Bobby Maine (Sam Elliott) is trying to keep him together. After a concert, he stops at a random bar to drink. It's a drag bar and he is taken with performer Ally (Lady Gaga). She's an amateur singer who is afraid to sing her own material. He pulls her out of anonymity onto center stage.At first, I was slightly annoyed with Bradley's mumbling. I figured it's his poor attempt at drunk acting. It's not until it's revealed that Sam Elliott is playing his older brother that I realized that Bradley is imitating Sam. On the other hand, Lady Gaga is perfectly cast right from the start. She has the vulnerability and quite frankly, her average looks fit the character. The biggest scene is her first time on stage. The tension remains mostly flat for the rest of the movie. Bardley's directing is functional. There is a straight forward style to the proceeding or it may be the familiarity of this often told tale. Other than a few moments, this movie doesn't shock or surprise but it is very solid."

","Dr. Ryan Stone (Sandra Bullock) is an inexperienced astronaut repairing a satellite. Matt Kowalsky (George Clooney) is a veteran close to breaking the spacewalk record. Meanwhile, a Russian attempt to bring down a satellite sets off a chain reaction as a cloud of debris destroys the shuttle. Then Stone and Kowalsky scrambles to get another way return home.As a story, there isn't much. As a movie, it's a thrilling ride. Director Alfonso Cuarón is using all the latest tech to create a believable adventure. The action is so realistic that it's like a scary amusement park ride. The leap forward is that the astronauts are so realistic. It could have been so easily reduced to a video game. But I actually believe the actors were in the suits, and we were crashing into all those space stuff. It's a must see on the big screen."
Lone Survivor,7,3,6,27 June 2014," well done but Berg puts a little too much Hollywood in the action
","Marcus Luttrell (Mark Wahlberg) is the lone survivor of a mission in Afganistan. He, Michael Murphy (Taylor Kitsch), Danny Dietz (Emile Hirsch), and Matt Axelson (Ben Foster) are a four man SEAL reconnaissance team sent to track down a violent Taliban leader named Ahmad Shah. The team has constant radio problems. They encounter 3 goat herders. After some lively debate, they let them go and try to escape the onslaught of Taliban forces.Director Peter Berg brings the book about the real battle to the big screen. The start is reminiscent of Peter Berg doing 'Friday Night Lights'. I think he even used similar musical cues. The four lead actors do a solid job. They're all good actors and they don't let their Hollywood flash outshine their roles. This is especially true for Wahlberg. He continues to improve as an actor.However Peter Berg does put too much Hollywood flash into the battles. After an hour, the movie's second half is overblown both in explosive flash and theatrical posing. The action has some great realism at times but at other times feels like a Hollywood affair. All in all, the action pushes over the edge a few times. The villagers are nice but there again, Berg puts in a battle where the helicopters come over the ridge just in time to mow down all the Taliban in a blaze of glory. This would probably work much better if the action is not overproduced and be more realistic."
To Be or Not to Be,7,0,2,24 August 2014," Good wartime suspense thriller
","It's 1939. Husband and wife, Joseph (Jack Benny) and Maria Tura (Carole Lombard), are theater stars. He's a self-obsessed diva and she has an admirer in bomber pilot Lieut. Stanislav Sobinski (Robert Stack). After the German invasion, Sobinski is in England. He meets Professor Siletsky who is going back to Poland. Everybody gives him family and friends names to send greetings to. Sobinski is suspicious when he doesn't know who Maria Tura is. Before Sobinski could tell the higher ups, he's gone back and Sobinski is sent after him.This is a suspenseful thriller with some jokes thrown in. The remake is funnier and jokier. This one still has the funniest line 'Heil myself'. Mel Brooks makes walking out on 'To be or not to be' much funnier than Jack Benny. Jack is less outrageous than Mel. This one is just more of a spy action movie being shown right in the middle of the war. It does struggle with the tone as it keeps going back to the big laughs with Jack Benny. It's a battle between the dark serious subject matter and Jack Benny trying to ham it up."
Monty Python's Life of Brian,9,2,6,13 March 2014," Brian the mistaken Messiah
","Brian Cohen (Graham Chapman) was born next to baby Jesus being mistaken for the Messiah by the three wise men. He has a loud Jewish mother (Terry Jones). He spends his life around the biblical events eventually joining a Jewish resistance group. On the run from the Romans, he is mistaken for the Messiah by a crowd leading to his crucification.There are three things I love about this movie. The first is the hilarious Jewish mother by Terry Jones. Every time he says something, I have to laugh. The first half of the movie is a bit hit and miss. There are some really funny skits. Around midway, Brian is mistaken for the Messiah and I think this is where the best comedy is. It's a light hearted skewering of church doctrine. They are literally killing it with kindness as the fanatical followers declare everything divine. Of course, I love the finale song. Who doesn't love 'Always Look on the Bright Side Of Life'?"
Wind River,8,3,6,21 November 2017," brutal crime drama
","Cory Lambert (Jeremy Renner) is a hunter working for Fish and Wildlife Service. He is brought in to Wind River Reservation to hunt down an animal in the mountains of Wyoming and discovers the frozen body of a dead local girl. Ben (Graham Greene) is the tribal police chief. New FBI agent Jane Banner (Elizabeth Olsen) arrives to investigate the case. She faces jurisdictional conflicts and cultural intransigence.This is very much in the tradition of In Cold Blood. The characters are well-drawn. There is a sense of place. The violence is brutal. The shootouts are shocking, abrupt, visceral, and intense. There isn't much of a mystery. It's more about a straight forward investigation. The scene with Cory confessing his lost to Jane is something different. Although I appreciated it, Jane getting the information from his wife would be more compelling in the traditional sense. Jane would know something about Cory without him knowing about it. When the perp is on the run and sees the porcupine, I fully expected the mountain lion to jump him from behind. There is a poetry to what Cory does to him. This is a brutal and effective crime drama."
Erin Brockovich,7,1,2,19 September 2013," well made under-dog story
","Erin Brockovich (Julia Roberts) is a struggling unemployed single mother of three. She can't even win a petty lawsuit against a doctor for a car accident. So she browbeats her lawyer Ed Masry (Albert Finney) to give her a job. When she starts poking into a suspicious real estate case involving the Pacific Gas & Electric Company. It turns into much more of a case of toxic waste dumping and one of the biggest class action lawsuits in American history.Julia Roberts delivers a big performance in a traditional under-dog movie. This is definitely well-made by master director Steven Soderbergh. Nothing is left on the table, and it helps to have great actors all around like the great Albert Finney.The only small problem I had. There is a holier than thou attitude that Erin Brockovich hasn't earned yet in the movie. After all she brings frivolous lawsuits, she needs to show more of her struggles. I think there was a story where she had to steal medicine for her kids. That would be a great insight into her struggles to start the movie with. That would buy credit for all the stuff that follows."
The Death of Stalin,7,0,1,25 March 2018," some fun with a murderous satire
","Joseph Stalin rules the Soviet Union with an iron fist. He produces a constant stream of enemy lists which his soldiers round up nightly. He is surrounded by yes men. After a laughable threat from pianist Maria Yudina, he has a stroke. Soon, he's dead and various leaders struggle for dominance. The most ambitious are Nikita Khrushchev (Steve Buscemi) and NKVD head Lavrentiy Beria. Molotov is the fumbling Foreign Minister. Field Marshal Zhukov is the bombastic war hero. Svetlana and unstable Vasily are Stalin's children. Beria uses his secret police, stealing Khrushchev's liberal reforms, and blackmail with Khrushchev's mistress Yudina's threatening note.This political satire has a few funny moments. It's oddly light in a dark world. That's the central problem which holds it back. The historical events are dire. The dictatorial police state is apocalyptic. This movie tries to have some light fun with it. The clash between comedy and reality is never far from the surface. The other issue I have is that Buscemi always looks like Buscemi. He never strikes me as Khrushchev. I see the historical Khruschev as a big, boisterous gangster. Buscemi always looks little. I can't see him as Khrushchev. This has plenty of quirky fun but those couple of things keep pulling me out of the movie."
Meet the Parents,7,1,1,13 October 2013," Funny but Gaylord lacks strength
","Greg Focker (Ben Stiller) is a happy male nurse who has a great girlfriend Pam Byrnes (Teri Polo). He wants to propose to her, but have to get her father Jack's (Robert De Niro) permission. Only Jack isn't the trusting kind.This starts off pretty much as expected with awkward uncomfortable interactions. The movie goes from awkward laughs to uncomfortable silences. The lie detector scene is especially funny. What makes it problematic for me is that Focker is a bit of a weasel. He's constantly trying to lie his way out of things. It's not a likable trait.I'm not talking about the cat lie. That's a defensible move. But he's too weasely even when it makes no sense. When Kevin (Owen Wilson) is getting his goat, Greg tries to puff himself up even though Jack is right there who could easily out him. It's in his nature and that's a problem.The movie has a lot of fun, and the ending is heart warming. But I have to downgrade it a little for Greg's personality. Ben Stiller plays him a little too pathetic when it would be better to have a little confidence. It's better to have him as a reasonable nice man who's dealing with a crazy Jack. He needs to be more a straight man."
Mulan,7,0,2,13 January 2015," the progression of the Disney princess
","The Huns led by Shan Yu are invading China. The emperor is calling up one man from each family to join the army. Fa Mulan (Ming-Na Wen) fears her father is too sick and instead joins herself disguised as a man. Her ancestors call on the Great Stone Dragon to retrieve Mulan but clumsy small dragon Mushu (Eddie Murphy) accidentally cracks the statue. So Mushu tries to make Mulan a war hero so that they can return in triumph.It's a good evolution on the Disney princess movies. She is no longer the helpless victim. Like Beauty and Beast, Mulan willingly sacrifices herself but she's doing even more. She is actively trying to break out of the traditional gender roles. It's an admirable advancement but it's missing a few things. The most notable is the absent of any catchy great new song. Also Mulan dressed as a male soldier doesn't make for the best doll for the collection. Nevertheless this is a good story and fun exciting animation."

There is a serial killer on the loose delivering his sermon on the Seven Deadly Sins. Somerset is tired of the city. Mills is eager to investigate.Director David Fincher has filled with beautiful darkness. It's more than just the gruesome murders. It's the rain, the music score and the grungy setting. Fincher has weaved together an artistic masterpiece. Freeman is the perfect grizzled veteran. Brad Pitt is a terrific eager newcomer. There are surprising comedy sprinkled in. The final twist is simply cinematic history. The big line is awesome. Pitt delivers it perfectly with so much heart aching pleading. Some do deride its grotesque gloom but that's like complaining about a movie being too funny or too exciting. This is suppose to be dark and it achieves it."
I'm Not There,6,3,5,31 August 2016," Blanchett
",This movie jumps back and forth between six personalities supposed to represent Bob Dylan. Woody Guthrie is an 11-year-old African American hobo. Arthur Rimbaud (Ben Whishaw) is a teenage poet. Jack Rollins (Christian Bale) sings with Alice Fabian (Julianne Moore) in the 60's protesting the war. Robbie Clark (Heath Ledger) plays Jack Rollins in a biography. Jude Quinn (Cate Blanchett) is a folk singer who starts playing the electric guitar. Billy McCarty (Richard Gere) is secretly the outlaw Billy the Kid.The most compelling performance and the most audacious attempt belongs to Cate Blanchett. I wouldn't mind a whole movie with Blanchett as Dylan. The way this movie works is very random and artsy. I would prefer concentrating on any one of the personalities rather than following all six. It's ambitious but it's structurally scattered.

Wayne Campbell (Mike Myers) and Garth Algar (Dana Carvey) make their own show from Wayne's parents' basement in Aurora, Illinois. Oliver gets video arcade owner Noah Vanderhoff (Brian Doyle-Murray) to sponsor and signs the guys to do a revamped Wayne's World. Wayne falls for rocker chick Cassandra (Tia Carrere) and is stalked by his ex Stacy (Lara Flynn Boyle). The writing is smart and fresh. The characters are fun. They have great chemistry. There are some great laughs. The movie makes some great commentaries. The characters and this world they exist in are so fun and joyful."

They're looking for the millionaire Jeffrey Lebowski (David Huddleston) whose young wife Bunny ran up a debt. The Dude's unstable friend Walter Sobchak (John Goodman) convinces him to go see the rich Lebowski for compensation for the rug. Later Bunny is kidnapped for a $1M ransom. Rich Lebowski asks the Dude to do the ransom hand off. Walter tries to double cross the kidnappers but the drop off goes terribly wrong. The money is stolen. All the while, the Dude and Walter is in a bowling tournament with Donny Kerabatsos (Steve Buscemi). Maude Lebowski (Julianne Moore) is Lebowski's daughter who wants the Dude to recover the money from the kidnappers.This is crazy Coen movie. This is a weird black comedy. It reminds me of the craziest parts of 'Raising Arizona'. It's a little too meandering with weird characters coming in every few minutes. This is much more weird than funny. I found only a few big laughs like the fking toe. On the other hand, it is completely unique. A lot of it is weird for weird's sake. It's a lot of weird. I get the sense that this is a great movie to have a good smoke while watching it."

","Elijah Price (Samuel L. Jackson)'s birth was a difficult one. He was born on 1961 in a Philadelphia department store with broken arms and legs. He is constantly getting hurt and loath to go outside. His mother bribes him with comic books. He would become an avid comic book collector and study. David Dunn (Bruce Willis) is riding the train when it derails. He is the sole survivor without a scratch. He has a wife Audrey (Robin Wright) and a boy.Writer/director M. Night Shyamalan is playing around with the traditional structure. He has extended the first act beyond any normal reason. Most of the movie is the first act of a 3 act story. It spends most of the movie in a ponderous slow moving introduction that finally reveals the truth. While the reveal is interesting and unforeseen, it isn't the Sixth Sense and lack the satisfaction.This is a superhero movie that Shyamalan has drained most of the action and excitement from. It's deliberate and that creates a certain tone. There's a creepy tone that permeates throughout. The movie starts with a massive train wreck. It's an easy action scene but Shyamalan doesn't use it for a reason. He wants the slow creep. It's an unique movie but not necessarily a compelling movie."
Star Trek,8,1,3,15 November 2013," Flare-o-rama Popcorn Fun
","J.J. Abrams reboots the Star Trek franchise with a whole new cast. Chris Pine is a leading man Kirk with less overacting. Quite frankly, there's no way to overact more than Shatner. Zoe Saldana is a sexy Uhura. Simon Pegg adds more comedy to Scotty. Zachary Quinto is the one that truly shines as the new Spock.J.J. does a bit of a cheat in the story construction. It's an alternate universe. Of course that's perfectly acceptable in the sci-fi world. It also helps that J.J. is shooting in a different style than every other Star Trek movie. It is more action oriented, more glowy, more flashy, and more camera flares than humanly possible. More than all the others, it's good popcorn fun."

Don Collier (Brad Pitt) commands his Sherman tank with his war-weary crew Boyd Swan (Shia LaBeouf), Trini Garcia (Michael Peña) and Grady Travis (Jon Bernthal). Norman Ellison (Logan Lerman) is a green recruit destine for clerical work when he's push onto Collier to replace his dead assistant driver.What David Ayer gives is an ugly portrait of war. There is no prettying up these characters or these situations. They are worn down to their animal cores. Some may be displeased at an American soldier killing a prisoner. The most disturbing is the approval of all the soldiers around them. This is not heroic at times putting survival above all else. Yet at other time, it is heroism at its highest. The blood and mud is easy. The acting is the hard part. The four hard worn veterans have the dark animalistic feel. Logan Lerman gets to grow his character. They all get that dirty feel of war. The story is a bit predictable with the third act playing out without much surprise. Nevertheless, it is a compelling watch all the way to the end."
Fight Club,6,7,17,20 December 2014," love the premise at the start but not the twist
","A nameless man (Edward Norton) suffering from insomnia is a traveling investigator for a car company. He goes to a support meeting. He is addicted and starts going to all kinds of support meetings. He encounters another meeting groupie Marla Singer (Bonham Carter). She is uninhibited. On a flight home, he encounters Tyler Durden (Brad Pitt) who makes his own soap. They bond over their dislike of consumerism. Man with no name loses his apartment due to a gas explosion. Outside a bar, Tyler asks him to hit him. He starts staying at Tyler's dilapidated isolated mansion.I want to like this a lot more. I want this movie to say something about consumerism and effeminization of society. I want this movie to take a profound stance on the state of the male position in modern society. It also touches on the isolation of the modern world. It seems set up for something great but then the movie gives a twist that takes much of the punch away. The movie becomes about the twist and I don't know what the movie says about anything else."
Akira,7,1,3,9 April 2014," Ahead of its times
","On 16 July 1988, a nuclear blast levels Tokyo. Now it's 31 years later after the end of WWIII. Kaneda is a bike gang leader in a dystopian Tokyo. Kaneda's best friend Tetsuo runs into Takashi who escaped from a secret government laboratory. There is a dissident anti-government organization. Meanwhile military scientists is experimenting on supernatural powers.While the style is ground breaking, I would have wanted a clearer story with a more prominent main character. The movie should really follow Tetsuo and let him discover the secrets for us. Instead we keep switching to the bad guys who tells us everything. It's a pretty good story with an impressive imaginative style."
As Good as It Gets,7,0,0,27 October 2013," Grumpy Old Man
","Melvin Udall (Jack Nicholson) is a romance novel writer who has problems. He bullies his gay neighbor Simon Bishop (Greg Kinnear). In fact, the first thing he does in the movie is to shove Simon's dog down the garbage chute. He's a petty angry horrible man suffering some OCD. He has to eat at the restaurant where Carol Connelly (Helen Hunt) works as his personal waitress. She's a tough woman trying to get by with a sick child. When Simon is attacked in his home, Melvin is left to take care of the dog.Of course he learns to accept other people. He falls Carol and she saves him from a bitter lonely life. That's the basic storyline and director James L. Brooks adds the colors of a memorable performance by Jack Nicholson. Nicholson is definitely tapping into his sly mean-spirited self. Some of his action is funny, but a lot of it is too angry. I wish he had more vulnerability at the start to allow the audience to root for him.Helen Hunt is obviously way too young for Jack Nicholson. But there is something about Jack that he can certainly get a woman that age in real life. It's Helen Hunt that doesn't really fit. She isn't really the MPDG type. She seems to be too smart to get involved with that mess. Although it makes for a good movie."
Train to Busan,8,11,22,9 August 2017," Korean zombie train
","It's the start of the zombie apocalypse. The population is caught unaware. An injured girl scrambles onto a train leaving Seoul for Busan. She had been bitten by an infected and soon becomes an infected herself. The infection spreads and the survivors find safety in a few cars. Among the survivors are a girl and her often-absent fund manager father, a strong man and his pregnant wife, two elderly sisters, a baseball team and one cheerleader, and a selfish businessman.This is solid zombie fare. The zombies are reminiscent of World War Z. In fact, it might as well be a small part of that franchise. The characters are well-drawn. They are memorable. There are about ten good characters. The action is thrilling and scary both small and large scale. There is good tension throughout. There is one climatic scene that is trying too hard emotionally but that's a small flaw in an otherwise flawless action film."
Citizen Kane,8,1,4,30 August 2014," Iconic classic
","Newspaper tycoon Charles Foster Kane (Orson Welles) is dead in his palatial estate. His last word is 'Rosebud' and reporters investigate what could it possibly mean to spice up his obituary newsreel. First they contact a drunken Susan Alexander Kane (Dorothy Comingore) who was Kane's dance hall girl second wife. There is Walter Parks Thatcher recollection of Kane's childhood and beyond as he first became his guardian and then became his biggest target. Jedediah Leland (Joseph Cotten) was his partner in the newspaper business. Emily Monroe Norton Kane (Ruth Warrick) is his first wife who died in a car crash with their son.This is a technically superior movie. The scale is grand in its ambition. It's a character loosely based on newspaper mogul William Randolph Hearst. Almost all of the movie is one flashback after another which does take away some of the immediacy from the movie. It also clouds the character in second hand recollections. Despite that and the movie starts with a highlight reel of his life, the story remains fascinating."
Darkest Hour,8,7,13,18 February 2018," a human portrait
","It's the early days of WWII. The Germans are on the march and the Allies are retreating. Winston Churchill (Gary Oldman) is not yet Prime Minister but is in line for the job. Clemmie (Kristin Scott Thomas) is his long-suffering supportive wife. Elizabeth Layton (Lily James) is his new secretary. He faces uncertainty from King George VI (Ben Mendelsohn) and dying Neville Chamberlain (Ronald Pickup) while Viscount Halifax (Stephen Dillane ) pushes for peace negotiations.This is a compelling historical character-study drama. The most intriguing aspect is that it depicts Churchill as a man slowly overwhelmed by the failing campaign and even considers a peace with Hitler. In many ways, it is a more human portrait and a much more dramatic character study. Historical accuracy is a little questionable especially the subway ride. I understand the premise but it feels manufactured. I don't know if there was ever such a note with all those regular people names and that speech to rally his supporters. If such an event happened, I would think he goes into the subway with his mind already set. He wouldn't need these regular folks to give him his direction. The climatic change in him is the meeting with the King. While I understand the idea that the normal people give him the strength to make the iconic speech, it feels fake. It's small bump in an otherwise beautiful, epic, thrilling road."
Monster,9,0,1,7 November 2014," Incredible and surprising performance from Theron
","Aileen Wuornos (Charlize Theron) grew up with dreams of stardom. However her childhood is filled with abuse and sexual promiscuity. She falls into prostitution. She's in Florida servicing truckers on the side of the highway. She meets lonely awkward lesbian Selby Wall (Christina Ricci) who is under pressure from her religious father to reject her sexuality. After killing a violent John in self defense, she spirals into a series of killings. The relationship with Shelby deteriorates when she suspects Aileen of the murders.This is a breakout performance from Charlize Theron. She shows that she is better than a simple model-turned-actress. She shows that she has great acting skills. Christina Ricci is a terrific companion. The genius of writer/director Patty Jenkins is to point the camera at Theron. She is allowed to fully express the character as both the victim and as the monster."
The Rookie,7,1,1,24 June 2015," fine underdog family fare
","Jim Morris moved a lot as a kid being the son of a military man (Brian Cox). His baseball dream got sidelined time and again. He ended up in Texas where nuns supposedly blessed the grounds after putting their money in drilling oil. He was actually drafted by the Milwaukee Brewers but injuries ended his career. He returned back to Texas. He (Dennis Quaid) teaches high school chemistry with his wife (Rachel Griffiths) and three kids. He coaches an unmotivated school baseball team. The team wants him to go to a tryout for the Tampa Bay Devil Rays. He agrees to do it if the team wins the championship.This is a nice inspirational family film. It's your basic nice small-town guy makes it to the big leagues. It's great anytime no matter what the big league is. That's not to say that this is a nothing special movie. In addition to the expected feel-good moments, there are some fun moments and some heart breaking moments. I like the grass. I like all the minor obstacles. I like Dennis Quaid. There's a lot to like."
The Birth of a Nation,5,0,0,23 December 2014," well-filmed one sided history and apparently interracial marriage created KKK
","The Stonemans are a northern family headed by the abolitionist Congressman Austin Stoneman. His two sons visit their friend Ben Cameron in Piedmont, South Carolina. Ben is the eldest son of the Camerons who run the friendly quaint family plantation with happy slaves. The Stonemans are enamored with the elder daughter Margaret Cameron. Ben falls immediately for Elsie Stoneman with just her picture. The North's new president Lincoln enforce its rule with volunteers which leads to the Civil War. A black militia attacks Piedmont only to be rescued by Confederate troops in the nick of time. The heroic Ben is so gallant that he's cheered by the Federal troops. He is injured and brought to a Washington hospital where he meets Elsie working as a nurse. He is falsely charged to be executed and Elsie brings momma Cameron to Lincoln who pardons him. Ben returns to find the plantation in ruins. Austin Stoneman wants the south to be ruled as conquered provinces but Lincoln resists. Then Lincoln is killed in that fateful night. Stoneman takes over as the true power of the country with his mulatto protégé Silas Lynch. Lynch is sent south to lead the carpetbaggers to organize the black vote. The newly freed blacks are rude. Lynch is elected Lieutenant Governor in a rigged election. A renegade black Gus is eyeing white women and Ben is pushed to start the KKK. Elsie breaks off her engagement to Ben when she finds out. Ben's sister goes to the spring by herself and is attacked by Gus. She falls over a cliff to her death. The KKK goes to track down Gus for a fair trial and then an execution.This is well filmed but poorly written. It's not only the one sided history. It's not even the bad English coming from only the black characters. There is the happy slaves in the gentile plantation. The use of blackfaced white actors should be a big clue. Forget about the twisting of the political history, there are some really outlandish unnecessary stupid things in here. Ben is cheered on by the Federals in the middle of a battle. I don't know why that's even necessary. What inspiration did Ben get from watching the white kids hiding under the white sheets? Is it suppose to be a cloak of invisibility against black people? D. W. Griffith shows that he's a master filmmaker but this one-sided history isn't even well written. It is fascinating to see that the passage of inter-racial marriage is such a horrible thing in Griffith's mind and the true cause of all the trouble is a fight over white women."
The Maze Runner,7,0,1,24 June 2015," good start for yet another YA franchise
","Thomas (Dylan O'Brien) is unconscious in an elevator as it opens up onto a field. He has amnesia and surrounded by other kids. He remembers his name later but nothing else. A new boy arrives every 30 days with supplies. It's been 3 years since the first one. The forested field is surrounded by a giant maze. They sent out Runners to map out the maze and set up rules to only allow Runners into the maze. There are deadly Grievers in the maze during the night when the doors are closed. Thomas keeps disobeying the rules and run into the maze. He kills one of the Grievers and makes some discoveries. Then the only girl Teresa (Kaya Scodelario) arrives on the elevator with a note 'Shes the last one EVER'.This is better than many of the new YA movies. Why? The first thing I noticed is that the movie doesn't open with a lot of explaining the dystopian world. I like it. The characters are just as clueless as the audience. We are essentially discovering the world together and I usually hate the homework these movies impose on us every time.The acting is pretty good led by Dylan O'Brien. The kids' society is a little bit of Lord of the Flies. I like most of the kids. The maze is good although I couldn't really figure out this place. It felt like there are some miscalculations about this dystopia. Something isn't adding up. When the final message happened, that didn't make sense either. And then there is the reveal which simply put a big question mark on everything. I haven't read the books. I'm willing to wait for the sequel to pass judgment on whether this all adds up. So it's a 7 for now, but if the sequel doesn't make better sense of this world, the rating may have to go down."
Memento,10,0,3,25 August 2015," unique viewing experience
","Leonard (Guy Pearce) suffers from short term memory loss. His last permanent memory is an attack by two men. He killed the one who killed his wife. The other one escaped after clubbing him in the head. The police dismisses the idea of a second man. He keeps a record of his experiences using tattoos, Polaroids and hidden notes. He has to figure out whether he can trust Natalie (Carrie-Anne Moss) or Teddy (Joe Pantoliano) as he searches for the second man to avenge his wife.Brothers Christopher and Jonathan Nolan announce their arrival with this unique screenplay. The forward-reverse order makes the movie disjointed and confused in a good way. It's a beautiful struggle to figure out the plot. It puts the audience in Leonard's shoes. It's a jigsaw puzzle that Leonard with his memory loss also struggles with."
Inglourious Basterds,8,2,3,30 May 2014," Quentin Tarantino's style and Christoph Waltz's menace
","In 1941 Nazi-occupied France, 'The Jew Hunter' SS Colonel Hans Landa (Christoph Waltz) finds the Dreyfus family hidden by their neighbors. Shosanna Dreyfus (Mélanie Laurent) escapes after her family is massacred. Meanwhile Lt. Aldo Raine (Brad Pitt) has gathered 8 Jewish American soldiers to kill Nazis behind enemy lines. Their brutal scalping campaign instills fear among the Germans. Donowitz (Eli Roth) is even given a nickname 'The Bear Jew' for brutally beating Nazis with a baseball bat. Then in June 1944, Shosanna has a new name and a theater. She catches the eye of German war hero Fredrick Zoller who wants a big premiere in her theater that will attract the biggest of Nazi leaders. It even attracts the Jew Hunter as well as the Inglourious Basterds.Christoph Waltz is great as the cold menacing well-mannered Nazi. He is completely engrossing in every one of his scenes. Every word he speaks is dripping with menace. His scenes are quiet and some of the most compelling parts of the movie. Then Quentin Tarantino has injected his brutal violence into this Jewish revenge fantasy. It is nothing less than audacious and uniquely original."
Underworld,8,3,5,1 August 2014," Cool Sexy Cool
","There has been a war between the Vampires and Lycan even six centuries after the supposed death of the Lycan leader Lucian (Michael Sheen). Selene (Kate Beckinsale) is one of the great Death Dealer or ones who hunt down the Lycans. The Lycans are supposed to be close to extinction. However Selene battles the Lycans to a possible underground pack with more advanced weaponry. She becomes interested in human Michael Corvin (Scott Speedman) who seems to hold the key to the war and a mystery that is centuries old.There are really only two elements to this movie. It's the cool looking all-encompassing action, and Kate Beckinsale in her leather outfit. The story isn't very deep. It goes right into a war. There isn't much setup. Not much is really needed. Then there is the super sexy Kate. She looks cool in her action mode. She is without a doubt the movie's best asset."
Amistad,7,1,4,9 February 2014," Great until John Quincy Adams goes to court
","It's 1839, and the slaves imprisoned on the Amistad revolt against its crew. The slaves take over, but the two remaining crew tricked the Africans and sail the ship to America. There the Africans are imprisoned with various interests coming to fight over the slaves in court.The slaves are led by Cinque (Djimon Hounsou). Djimon does a powerful job. At first, the abolitionist led by Tappan (Stellan Skarsgård) are more interested in martyrdom than the slaves' freedom. A small property lawyer Roger Sherman Baldwin (Matthew McConaughey) takes over the case. It's McConaughey's performance that provide the perfect partnership to Hounsou. The best emotional scene is when the slave tries to interpret the story of Jesus from illustrations in the bible.Eventually the case goes to the Supreme Court where former President John Quincy Adams (Anthony Hopkins) takes over the defense. That's where the movie struggles. Adams is reluctant at first, long winded, and superior. He does not form a compelling character. He talks like a politician. The story climax earlier then sidelines both McConaughey and Hounsou in favor of Hopkins."
Kickboxer,6,1,1,26 March 2014," Good fun fighting B-movie
","Eric Sloane is an arrogant brash champion of kickboxing in America. He and little brother Kurt (Jean-Claude Van Damme) go to Bangkok to destroy the local talents. Only the Thai champion 'Tiger' Tong Po breaks Eric's back and paralyzes him. With the help of Taylor, an American living locally, Kurt becomes a student under master Xian. He trains to face the powerful Tong Po himself, and falls in love with a local.This hits the trifecta of fight action B-movie. It's got cheesy acting, exotic locations, and an eastern fighting style. The music is full on 80s cheese. Van Damme does a reasonable job acting. The fights are a little bit disappointing. It's staged by experts but it needs experts to film it properly. Michel Qissi is a great villain in this. This is a B-movie that is better than most."
Rogue One: A Star Wars Story,8,16,35,16 December 2016," terrific fan service
","Weapons designer Galen Erso (Mads Mikkelsen) is hiding from the empire with his wife and daughter. He is captured by Orson Krennic (Ben Mendelsohn) who kills his wife and forces him to work on the Death Star. Saw Gerrera (Forest Whitaker) rescues and raises Galen's daughter Jyn. Years later, Saw has become an extremist and Jyn (Felicity Jones) is in Imperial prison. Galen convinces cargo pilot Bodhi Rook (Riz Ahmed) to defect and seek out Saw with a message. Cassian Andor (Diego Luna) with droid K-2SO (Alan Tudyk) from the rebel alliance rescues Jyn. They are sent to find Saw and the pilot defector. The ragtag group is joined by Chirrut Îmwe (Donnie Yen) and Baze Malbus (Wen Jiang) as the empire completes its secret ultimate weapon.This is a fan service war movie coming from director Gareth Edwards. I don't know why fan service has such a bad reputation. It's definitely better than fan disservice. This should satisfy any fans of episode four. There are solid actors doing good acting. Mendelsohn does a great job and Felicity Jones is a good lead. K-2SO is probably the best new character. There is an international cast with corresponding accents which will probably annoy certain people. It doesn't bother me but I expect snarky internet comments. The CGI characters recreation is a great idea looking for better execution. The movie does miss the opening crawl. The start feels abrupt without it. There are a couple of dialog speeches that get a little long. Despite the little hiccups, there is plenty of action and an epic third act which should be fun for any fan of the franchise."
Captain Marvel,7,27,51,13 March 2019," it's fine
","Vers (Brie Larson) is a powered member of the Kree Empire mentored by Commander Yon-Rogg (Jude Law). The Kree is under attack from the shapeshifting Skrulls. During a battle, Vers is captured where the Skrulls try to extract her memories. She had lost her memories six years earlier. With flashes of recovered memories, she escapes and crashes onto a Los Angeles Blockbuster. Nick Fury (Samuel L. Jackson) and new agent Phil Coulson (Clark Gregg) arrive to investigate. It's 1995 before Fury executed the Avengers Initiative. Vers searches for Dr. Wendy Lawson (Annette Bening) who is the key to her past.It's a prequel. It's an origin story. It's an exposition movie. It's a connective tissue movie. It's a female empowerment story. It's a Marvel movie. It's trying to be a lot of stuff. Despite that, it's fairly uncomplicated. It runs well without hitting any major potholes. It introduces a new hero. It gives her a very specific identity. It still has a few issues. First, Brie Larson is doing a specific character but the role is lacking in range. Essentially, she starts off with amnesia and that's not always great for character work. It's almost as bad as being brainwashed and comes off as robotic. There is one moment of great possibility when Carol is across the table with Maria for the first time in a while. That could have been a really powerful moment of female friendship. Akira Akbar is acting her butt off but Brie is restricted to her memory blanks. Her memories could have flooded back as she emotionally breaks down. They could have hugged and yes why not even shed a tear. Her character needs a different gear. The role is stuck in the robotic amnesia Jason Bourne mode. Bourne could have been a solid choice but that's not this movie either. She's wise-cracking right from the start but that's the limit of her emotional range.Second is her memory flashbacks. Instead of showing those memories early, the movie should have kept them from the audience. It becomes repetitive and we are forced to wait for Carol to catch up. The movie needs to keep the audience at the same level as Carol in her discovery. It should only reveal each memory as it comes up in the plot. Her meeting with Maria should be the point where most of her flashbacks occur like when her extended memory of the inciting incident is triggered. The movie needs to rearrange a few things.The other characters are solid. Fury is great. His humor really works. The music is mostly popular 90's female alternative voices. It's not unexpected but the climax starts with No Doubt's Just A Girl which is awkward for hitting it on its tippy tip nose. It's a weird song to fight to. It could have also added a few more male singers. It's deliberately doing something which seems unnecessary and the music taste is too similar. Why not NIN or a rapper to change the tone? I hope that Carol will be a deeper character in the future. She could face a more personal challenge with an older Monica. This film is filling out a lot of story blanks whether we like it or not, and preparing for the upcoming Avengers movie. It's fine. The Marvel universe continues."
Coraline,8,1,1,27 January 2014," Imaginative creepy
","Coraline is a blue haired girl who moves into an old house with her parents. Her parents are busy writing and can't be bothered by her. She's restless and bored. She finds a mysterious tiny door. When she opens it, she finds the opening bricked up. Following some mice in the night, she finds the door mysteriously opened onto a portal to a copy of the world except better. She finds her parents are more attentive with buttons instead of eyes. She finds the world full of color and magic and everything is what she hoped for in the real world.If there is one problem in this movie, it's that Coraline is a bit of brat especially with her parents. She doesn't treat the neighbor boy Wybie that well either. However the Other world is just so infinitely fascinating and at the same time creepy. I can really buy that she would be seduced by the Other and at the same time be leery of it. Writer/director Henry Selick have done great works before. This one stands out with its colorful yet foreboding tone."

Fighting breaks out between Greece and Italy. Mandras goes off to war vowing to marry Pelagia upon his return. The Axis forces march onto the island with no resistance. Italian Captain Antonio Corelli (Nicolas Cage) and his men never fire a shot. Mandras returns terribly injured and then joins the partisans. Despite initial hatred, Pelagia falls for Corelli and his mandolin. Captain Günther Weber (David Morrissey) is the awkward German trying to befriend Corelli. When Italy surrenders, allegiances change.The Anglo-American lead actors strip away the Mediterranean heat. Cage is playing up the quirkiness unnecessarily. Bale can never pass for an islander. Everybody is doing an accent. There is no chemistry between anybody. Cruz is left with no worthy dance partner. There are no compelling relationships and the movie suffers. It's a warmed-up wartime period piece romance."
The Fan,5,10,12,7 November 2013," Too much flash from Tony Scott
","Gil Renard (Robert De Niro) is a failing knife salesman, a SF Giants fanatic, a divorced father of a boy, and a very angry guy. Bobby Rayburn (Wesley Snipes) is a new sign to the ball club, and the hope for savior. Both men's lives go downhill.Director Tony Scott has made a movie filled with flash and sizzle. It doesn't accentuate as much as distract. When there is a master thespian like Robert De Niro, all the extra fireworks just take the focus away from the real show. And Wesley Snipes isn't likable enough. A less stereotypical selfish black athlete may help. His scenes with his agent Manny (John Leguizamo) are annoying and tiresome. This could have been a creepy character study like the iconic 'Taxi Driver'. But it never allows De Niro any peace and quiet to do his work properly."
Shakespeare in Love,7,0,1,23 February 2014," Charming and cute
","Will Shakespeare (Joseph Fiennes) is a struggling playwright. He's sold his next play to both Philip Henslow (Geoffrey Rush) and Richard Burbidge. It's called 'Romeo and Ethel, the Pirate's Daughter'. Only he can't get started. Viola De Lesseps (Gwyneth Paltrow) comes from a wealthy family and wants poetry in her life. Lord Wessex (Colin Firth) is interested but he doesn't have the poetry. She pretends to be a man to audition for Will's play. However Will sees through her disguise and they begin a love affair.I love all the Shakespearian phrases that are thrown at Will from everybody. It has a cute charm to it. It's probably the best original Shakespearian play not written by him. I also love William Shakespeare as a struggling artist. It's not a high minded academic thing although a good knowledge of some of the famous lines help to appreciate this movie."

It's like old times at first until Seth drags Jay to James Franco's party. There are a lot of familiar faces at the party, and Jay doesn't like any of them. Then the apocalypse happen. Only six of them are left hiding in Franco's house.These are friends and it shows. They are hilarious together. They are playing their alternate selves like the great comedian each one is. There's a surprise short funny cameo by Emma Watson. Michael Cera is insanely ridiculous. Danny McBride does a hilarious douche character which is completely his on screen persona. Seth and Jay's personal relationship seems very genuine. The guys just keep the comedy going. Even the giant demon is an opportunity for a dick joke."

","Ana (Sarah Polley) is a nurse in Milwaukee who just finished her shift. She's sleeping with her husband and is woken up by a rabid neighbor girl. She goes on the run for her life. After crashing her car, she's joined by cop Kenneth (Ving Rhames), criminal Andre (Mekhi Phifer) and his pregnant girlfriend, and TV salesman Michael (Jake Weber). They are cut off and decide to hold up in the mall. They find other survivors and are surrounded by zombies.Director Zack Snyder takes the George A. Romero classic icon with James Gunn script, and he injects it with the fast running zombie like '28 Days Later'. It doesn't try to explain away the zombies. It just gets the action started after a short introduction. It's an exciting action start that showcases Snyder's skills. I especially like the zombies really running hard. The story isn't anything original, but it has the sense of suburban reality. The mall looks real although a few brand name stores would help. I like the character work and I like the simplicity of the story. It knows its simplicity and works within its limits."
Iron Man 2,7,0,4,7 December 2013," good enough sequel
","Tony Stark (Robert Downey Jr.) is back declaring that he has created world peace. The problem is that his arc reactor heart is killing him as fast as saving his life. And then there's Ivan Vanko (Mickey Rourke) who is on a mission to avenge his father with superior arc technology.It's a good continuation sequel. I like Mickey Rourke as the new bad guy. He has the look and the menacing demeanor. I even like the accent. Sam Rockwell is normally a special actor, but his sleazy weapons manufacturer Justin Hammer feels very generic. And Garry Shandling is stupid as a Senator.Overall, it does feel a little bit bloat with the vast number of characters and the complicated history in this movie. There are a few characters they introduce that payoff in later movies. For example, Scarlett Johansson seems like nothing more than a simple T&A show. If not for the later movies, I would say she's a bad distraction.The fact is that it does two things all at once. It's Iron Man 2, but also pre-Avengers. And it does them both well enough. But like a ship with two masters, it can veer off at times. It could have been a great movie that is strictly Iron Man 2. But this is a good enough movie that advances both goals."
Two for the Money,6,3,5,24 November 2013," too long too much with the Pacino intensity
","Six years after a career-ending injury, former college football player Brandon Lang (Matthew McConaughey) is doing little more than a phone service for gamblers. After some amazing success, he is lured to NY to join Walter Abrams (Al Pacino) in his business of gambling predictions. It's a fast talking adrenaline junkie's business and Walter's wife Toni (Rene Russo) tries to keep ever present dangers in check.The story isn't that exciting. The characters are questionable. The big takeaway is the acting. Matthew McConaughey is a master of this brash young guy. He works well with the master Al Pacino. Al has more intensity than the rest of the cast. And Rene Russo has that superior regal airs about her. The movie starts well, but it does slow down around the middle. It is just too long, and the second half gets quite tiresome. Maybe the Pacino intensity wore me out. At the end, I really didn't care about anybody in the movie."

Three kids Stacy Peralta (John Robinson), Jay Adams (Emile Hirsch), and Tony Alva (Victor Rasuk) become famous pioneering stars. They start surfing empty neighborhood pools. Kathy (Nikki Reed) is Tony's sister.This has the energy. It has the music. It has the rebel sensibility. It's a little disorganized. It's hard to know who's the lead at times. Director Catherine Hardwicke has left it very loose. Heath Ledger is eating up the scenes with his weird voice. Emile Hirsch is sort of the center. There are quite a few unknown actors here. It's a very compelling history to begin with. For more insights, one should watch Stacy Peralta's 'Dogtown and Z-Boys'."

One Ripley was successfully recreated with some of the Queen's DNA mixed in. Another ship Betty delivers a cargo of people in hypersleep for implantation. When the aliens escape, the crew of the Betty must fight with the help of the clone Ripley.This is the 4th installment of the franchise, and it has return to more flashier digs. The moody ugly sets are gone. Winona Ryder is really a godsend to this movie. She brings back a similar energy as Newt. She has an innate ability to project vulnerability. It was sorely missed in Alien3. And Sigourney Weaver is giddy playing this creepy feral version of Ripley.The premise is a bit out there. It doesn't really make complete sense. The ending is a big mess with the different versions of aliens. As much as it likes to be something profound. It makes the climax one crazy mess."
World War Z,8,3,7,7 August 2013," good action thriller
","The world descends into the zombie apocalypse. There is some sort of virus and bitten people are turned into violent creatures. Former UN investigator Gerry Lane (Brad Pitt) is caught up with his wife Karin (Mireille Enos) and family. They manage to escape and Gerry is put to work on finding the origins of the outbreak. This Brad Pitt showcase has many good points. My only main complaint is the PG13 rating which imposes the cartoon zombie action rather than a gore bloody fare.The action starts right away within 10min. There's no need to misunderstand what this movie is. It's simply a popcorn movie. Although unlike other post-apocalyptic movie, there isn't the standard eerie empty city scenes. The zombie mystery is investigated in a Bond movie fashion. Brad Pitt travels all around the world following leads. It's actually easy to follow and really compelling. It has a good tension filled horror aspect. It's not all big action. You also get good scary parts with dark hallways and stalking dangers."
Passengers,6,23,42,9 January 2017," movie starts at the wrong place
","The Starship Avalon is transporting 258 crew and 5000 passengers in hibernation to the colony on faraway planet Homestead II. The ship is hit by debris and malfunctions slowly infect the system. Jim Preston (Chris Pratt) is awaken when his pod malfunctions. He is all alone except for robot bartender Arthur (Michael Sheen). He is unable to access the more sensitive ship systems. After a year of loneliness, Jim is suicidal and then he falls in love with Aurora Lane (Jennifer Lawrence). He decides to disable her pod and wake her up but keep the decision from her.This movie needs to start when Aurora wakes up. His decision is workable storytelling if we figure it out along with her. It could be a mystery with tension that turns into an action thriller. Also the movie is too desperate to be romantic. The fact that the audience knows what he did makes it impossible to get into the romantic mood. By starting the movie at the later spot, it can inject some creepiness and tension. It also makes the movie shorter which would help a lot. These are two hot A-list actors. It's easy to see how the studio automatically goes for the romantic route but the story is built for a tense thriller."
Forgetting Sarah Marshall,8,0,2,26 January 2014," Inventive Hilarious Touching rom-com
","Peter Bretter (Jason Segel) is a TV musician for the show Crime Scenes. His girlfriend Sarah Marshall (Kristen Bell) is the star of the show. Then his life falls apart after she breaks up with him. He escapes to Hawaii for vacation but runs into Sarah and her new boyfriend rocker Aldous Snow (Russell Brand). The concierge Rachel Jansen (Mila Kunis) takes pity on him and gives him a great beach side cottage.This is pack full of hilarious people who are doing great work. It starts with a gut busting hilarious crying penis breakup scene. The best side character is Jack McBrayer's sexually repressive newlywed. This is not just a run-of-the-mill rom-com. It is inventive, hilarious, and touching."
Seven Years in Tibet,5,2,4,11 July 2014," long with limited tension
","It's 1939. Austrian Heinrich Harrer (Brad Pitt) is climbing the world's 9th highest peak Nanga Parbat in British India. The mountain has become a German Nazi obsession after previous failures have left 11 dead. He's self-assured but selfish. He leaves behind his expectant wife. Heinrich wants to attempt a summit but Peter Aufschnaiter (David Thewlis) takes the team back down. When WWII breaks out, the team is arrested and put into Dehra Dun P.O.W. Camp. His wife leaves him. Heinrick escapes with Peter. Tibet is forbidden to foreigners. Eventually he sneaks into the city of Lhasa where they meet the young Dalai Lama.This is a long movie without much drama. Lots of things happen but I don't really care about much of it. It looks beautiful. I can't really invest myself with Brad Pitt's character. Even as they starve in the mountains, I didn't get a sense of tension. It's a long beautiful fascinating story but a bland watch. I don't care about Heinrich or his relationship. The Chinese invasion has a bit of drama but it could have been so much more compelling."
The Hunger Games,7,1,6,16 August 2013," good enough to justify franchise
","Based on popular books, the totalitarian nation of Panem is divided between 12 districts and the Capitol. Each year two young representatives from each district are selected by lottery to participate in The Hunger Games. Part entertainment, part brutal retribution for a past rebellion, the televised games are broadcast throughout Panem. 24 enters 1 leaves. When 16-year-old Katniss's young sister, Prim, is selected as District 12's female representative, Katniss volunteers to take her place. She is an underdog against other participants who have trained for this their whole lives.Other than Jennifer Lawrence, there isn't much to write home about. The scale of the movie barely big enough. The action isn't that brutal. The artistic style is a mishmash. Some of the important people have fanciful hair but are they truly original? I haven't read the books and after watching this, I don't intend to. By comparison, I eventually broke down and read the Harry Potter books after watching the 3rd movie. To be honest, I don't know what the big deal is. It's good enough to justify the franchise."
Zootopia,9,10,18,28 June 2016," fun with nice message
","The animals have evolved and live together. Judy Hopps (Ginnifer Goodwin) wants to be a policeman rather than a carrot farmer like every other rabbit. She becomes the first rabbit police officer in the metropolitan city of Zootopia. Chief Bogo dismisses the rookie and makes her a meter maid. She encounters hustler fox Nick Wilde (Jason Bateman). A few predator animals have gone missing and Judy jumps on the case of a missing otter. With no support from the police force, she coerces Nick to help.This world is wonderful. I love the various climates in the city and the different sizes of animals coexisting. The central message of trying is nice. The sloths at the DMV are hilarious. When the predators get shunned, the movie takes it to another level. The fear and message of tolerance is compelling and very timely. The characters are fun and the story is engaging. There is very little to complain about. The best I can do is that the song isn't quite as catchy as 'Let It Go'. The final reveal is obvious for the experienced. These are really minor and the movie is great."
12 Monkeys,9,2,3,13 November 2014," So much Terry Gilliam originality and great Brad Pitt
","This movie opens with '... 5 Billion People Will Die From A Deadly Virus in 1997 ... The Survivors Will Abandon The Surface of The Planet ... Once Again The Animals Will Rule The World ...' - Excerpts from Interview with clinically diagnosed paranoid schizophrenic, April 12, 1990 Baltimore County Hospital.In a dystopic near-future, criminal James Cole (Bruce Willis) is forced to volunteer to go up to the surface and collect samples. He is given the opportunity to reduce his 25 to life sentence by time-traveling to 1996 and gather information on the Army of the Twelve Monkeys. Back in 1990 Baltimore, county psychiatrist Kathryn Railly (Madeleine Stowe) is brought in to examine James Cole after a fight with 2 cops. He is locked up in the county sanatorium where he meets manic babbling Jeffrey Goines (Brad Pitt). He pleads to make a telephone call but the time hasn't come yet. He's suppose to be in 1996. Meanwhile he keeps having flashbacks of an incident as a kid. The future pulls him back but he's thrown back into the wrong time period again. When he finally arrives in the right time, he kidnaps Kathryn Railly.This is chalk full of Terry Gilliam goodness originality. I love the craziness. I love his style. This is the closest to portraying madness coherently on the big screen. Bruce Willis inhabits the regular guy under stress and then there is the wild madness coming from Brad Pitt. Madeleine Stowe is also terrific. I love the various settings. I love the crazy future. I love the decaying present. I love the asylum. I love it all."
Mississippi Burning,9,1,1,20 October 2014," Great performances in great movie
","It's 1964 Mississippi. Three young civil rights workers are murdered. The FBI has sent two men to investigate. Agent Alan Ward (Willem Dafoe) is straight laced, idealist, 3 years in the bureau, and put in charge of this investigation. Agent Rupert Anderson (Gene Hackman) is the easy going, jovial veteran with a better sense of the world they're getting into. He used to be a small town sheriff near Memphis. None of the locals are willing to help. Anderson befriends deputy Pell (Brad Dourif)'s wife (Frances McDormand).This is a great historical drama. It's definitely fictionalized which probably irked many people for different reasons. I don't mind the differences in the minutia of history as long as the feeling of realism is maintained. That is well achieved in this movie. The best have to be the two great performances of two great actors. They are perfection."
Au Revoir les Enfants,7,2,4,14 December 2014," compelling history but lacks tension
","During WWII in Nazi occupied France, Julien Quentin is a momma's boy unhappy to return to St. John of the Cross Carmelite Convent Catholic boarding school with his old brother François. A new boy Jean Bonnet arrives at the school. They eventually become best friends and then Jean tells Julien that he's actually Jewish. Joseph works at the school and trades with the boys on the black market.Filmmaker Louis Malle base this on his youth in a Roman Catholic school. This is compelling personal history of the larger story. However there is a lack of tension. It's never in doubt that Bonnet was a Jewish boy in hiding. It may help if he was a blonde hair, blue eyed boy. There are a couple of incidences where Bonnet is in the vicinity of being discovered but the tension never build. There is a lot of boys being boys like a 'Lord of the flies' lite. It's a bit annoying and directionless. I do like some scenes that don't go straight like the restaurant where the German troops kick out the french police trying to take a Jew. The movie probably needs to give Joseph more time and set him up for the big turning point. The movie should probably concentrate mostly on Julien, Bonnet and Joseph and lose half of the rest."
Rang De Basanti,6,5,13,22 March 2014," Love the characters but the turn is bad
","Sue finds her grandfather's journal of his days as a prison guard in colonial India. She wants to make a film about it, but the film company doesn't want to. She goes to India to meet up with a friend who introduces her to a bunch of University friends. They're all fun loving and aimless. She makes the movie using them. At first, they don't understand the commitment and the drive of the characters. Eventually the film influences them all. However the death of someone special ignites a dangerous fire in them all.I'm not much into Bollywood, but I figure I check out this highly rated movie. I do like the first half very much. I could do without the song and dance. However I love all the characters and their struggle to find purpose in their superficial lives. I could even gloss over the song and dance breaks.Then there is a big turn midway. While I understand the reason for the turn, it's highly overdone and too big. It takes the guys down a wrong path. If there is a good message in this movie, it is compromised by the second half."
The 13th Warrior,6,0,2,14 August 2015," fish out of water action thriller
","Ahmad Ibn Fadlan (Antonio Banderas) is a carefree poet in Baghdad. After falling for the wrong woman, he's banished to the barbaric far north as an ambassador. His caravan is attacked by Tartars and is rescued by a passing Viking longboat. Melchisidek (Omar Sharif) is his loyal companion. He is shocked by their customs. An ancient evil that must not be named threatens the Vikings and their seer prophesy that 13 warriors must be sent. The 13th must be no Northman and Ahmad is pushed into joining.I really like the idea of a cultured Arab trying to fit in with the crude Vikings. It has a bit of fun with the fish out of water concept. Director John McTiernan is too in love with the dark muddy battle. Most of all, the Vikings don't stand out as individual. Thirteen is probably too many. There is a long cinematic tradition with seven. If the group could be reduced, some of them have a better chance to stand out."
The Impossible,8,3,5,16 August 2013," Naomi Watts superior performance
",Maria (Naomi Watts) and Henry (Ewan McGregor) are on vacation with their three young kids in Thailand. It's a picture perfect trip at a coastal hotel. Suddenly a tsunami hits and the family is scattered.Naomi Watts gives a harrowing performance. It's a true life story of a family dealing with the 2004 Christmas Indian Ocean tsunami. The action scenes are unbelievable. The scale of it all and the danger it depicts is truly realistic. The performance that Naomi gives is absolutely Oscar worthy. She is truly believable as a mother fighting for her life as she loses track of her family. There are a lot of tear jerking moments here. Some of them pushes a little too far. But it never gets completely fake. Ewan McGregor plays the father who has an incredible scene with a cell phone. Highly recommended.
42,8,0,1,30 December 2013," Sentimentalism at its Finest
","This is docudrama based on Jackie Robinson's entry into Major League Baseball. It starts in the spring of 1945 when owner of the Brooklyn Dodgers Branch Rickey (Harrison Ford) decides to bring in the first negro into the league. Jackie (Chadwick Boseman) would be the one, and this movie tells the story up to the end of his rookie season.This is unabashed sentimentalism. Some subjects deserves and warrants such a treatment. Jackie Robinson is one. His squeaky clean image is maintained here. I like that they used a relative unknown in Boseman. At no time was I thinking that it's Will Smith up there playing Jackie Robinson. Boseman embodied the legendary player. Same can't be said of Branch Rickey. Every time I kept thinking Harrison Ford is playing that character. In the end, he does the job well, and I don't want to complain about that. It's a movie that deserves all the tears and all the cheers. It's a movie that should be seen."
Shaun of the Dead,8,1,4,10 May 2014," Hilarious new take on zombies
","Shaun (Simon Pegg) is trying to get out of his rut. He needs to pick up his game with girlfriend Liz (Kate Ashfield). He needs to connect more with his mother (Penelope Wilton). His slacker friend Ed (Nick Frost) is annoying his other roommate. He's a meek appliance salesman. It's another bad day in his life, but things seem to be happening all around him. It's the zombie apocalypse and he doesn't notice at all. After Liz dumps him, he has an all night drinking session with Ed. In the morning, the clueless duo come face to face with the walking dead.It's a little slow at the start. It takes awhile to lay down the foundations. Once they start fighting the zombies, the movie is hilarious. Nick Frost is crazy funny. It's a great new irreverent take on the zombie movie."
Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Man's Chest,6,0,1,12 October 2015," utter madness
",Will Turner and Elizabeth Swann's wedding is interrupted by Lord Cutler Beckett of the East India Trading Company who arrests them for aiding Captain Jack Sparrow. Norrington is also wanted but he has resigned and disappeared. Beckett offers Will pardons if he retrieves Sparrow's compass. Meanwhile Sparrow is haunted by impending doom from Davy Jones and his compass seems to be malfunctioning.This is utter madness. Anybody who claims clarity about the plot upon watching it the first time is simply lying. The story is a convoluted collision of non-sense. The jumping from one set of characters to the next leaves the movie disjointed. What's left is Johnny Depp doing a repeat performance. He continues to be one of the craziest character ever. It's not original anymore but he's still great like when he escapes from the natives. Davy Jones and his crew are things of marval. There is definitely greatness here but it's a jumble mess.
Rocky V,3,1,6,4 July 2014," Resurrecting the dead
","Rocky Balboa is back from Russia after defeating Drago. Sleazy promoter George Washington Duke wants Rocky to fight his fighter Union Cane. However Rock is suffering from brain damage and retires. Then they find out that their crooked accountant had lost all their money. Rocky only has Mickey's old gym and he moves back to the old neighborhood. Rocky Balboa Jr. (Sage Stallone) is having trouble with the mean kids. Neighborhood kid Tommy Gunn (Tommy Morrison) begs Rocky to be his manager. Tommy has some success and that's when Duke swoops in.Stallone is trying to bring back every last bit of goodness from the original. It's part homage and part resurrecting the dead. They have Rocky flashback to Burgess Meredith. They even brought back John G. Avildsen to direct. They engineer Rocky to move back to the old neighborhood in a convoluted manufactured story. There's a younger version of Rocky. They got Sly's son to play Rocky's son.On paper, this is daring attempt to bring back the glory of the first movie. It's as if everybody had a checklist of things to do. This is not inspired as much as it's constructed. The one thing that this does not have from the original is a sense of reality. The first one had a documentary style feel. A lower class Italian neighborhood is realistic back then. I can't help but notice that the run down place is still filled with mostly white people. There is one attempt at an old hangout that turned into something foreign. It just feels like very fake. It struggles to split the difference between the gritty documentary feel of the original and the glossy formulaic sequels. It needed to choose. It does not and fails to be either."
Argo,8,1,3,15 September 2013," Great acting, even has a few laughs
","It's the 1979 Iran hostage crisis. Revolutionaries take over the American embassy and over 60 personnel are taken hostage. Six are able to escape to the residence of the Canadian Ambassador Ken Taylor (Victor Garber). CIA expert Tony Mendez (Ben Affleck) devises a crazy plan to create a phony Canadian film project looking to shoot in Iran and smuggle the Americans out as its production crew.For a well known history and predestine ending, this is quite compelling, tense, and suspenseful. Affleck did take some liberties with the real story. About midway onwards, there are a few too many liberties taken to Hollywood it up. They even gin up a car chase. I understand drama has to be pump up. It's really a minor defect. The movie is filled with great acting, tense moments, and even has a few laughs. Of the Oscar nominees, I'd probably pick 'Django Unchained' and this solidly in second."
Last Flag Flying,5,3,7,9 February 2018," disappointed
","Larry 'Doc' Shepherd (Steve Carell) tracks down sarcastic bar owner Sal Nealon (Bryan Cranston). At first, Sal doesn't recognize Vietnam War acquaintance Doc. They go track down fellow vet Reverend Richard Mueller (Laurence Fishburne). Doc reveals that his marine son was killed in Iraq 2 days earlier and is set to be buried at Arlington Cemetery.I am a big fan of Richard Linklater. He certainly has a tendency to lean towards some experimentation. I am most disappointed in the flat, extended nature of this movie. With these three great actors, I expected much much more and there is no reason to take two hours to get there. Nevertheless, these are great actors. It may have helped if some flashbacks of the Vietnam days be included. The movie has a rambling unfocused nature which is not helped by the simple filmmaking. I'm fine with Carell's quiet suffering but I wanted an explosion somewhere. Cranston tries his best to be irreverent. Fishburne is cool. I don't necessarily have any big problems but I want better."
Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl,7,1,3,12 October 2015," memorable Johnny Depp
","Governor Weatherby Swann (Jonathan Pryce), his daughter Elizabeth and Lieutenant James Norrington (Jack Davenport) rescue boy Will Turner from a burning wreck on their way to Port Royal. Elizabeth hides Will's gold pirate medallion. Eight years later, Governor Swann is trying to set up Elizabeth (Keira Knightley) with the fast rising Norrington but she is still taken with Will (Orlando Bloom), now a swordsmith. Captain Jack Sparrow (Johnny Depp) rescues Elizabeth from the water but he is set to hang for being a pirate. He escapes but Will helps catch him. Meanwhile the gold pirate medallion has called in Captain Barbossa (Geoffrey Rush) on the haunted Black Pearl to attack the port. Barbossa kidnaps Elizabeth with the medallion. Will frees Sparrow to pursue her.The movie is bombastic, chaotic and messy. It's great to have Knightley and Bloom but it is Johnny Depp who steals the film. It is such a crazy performance that it is bigger than everything else. Without it, this movie would be a messy muddled thing. With it, this is a wonderful brilliant exuberant fun mess. In a film overstuffed with CGI, big sets and wild characters, Depp has a neon sign flashing over him in one of the most original performance ever in movie history."
Star Trek Into Darkness,6,2,4,22 October 2013," JJ Abrams reworks Star Trek 2
","Captain Kirk (Chris Pine) ignores the Prime Directive to save Spock (Zachary Quinto) on a mission. Uhura (Zoe Saldana) is relieved. After terrorist attacks killing Adm. Pike, Adm. Macus (Peter Weller) sends Kirk on a mission to kill renegade John Harrison (Benedict Cumberbatch) who has escaped to the Klingon homeworld Kronos. They are joined by weapons specialist Dr. Carol Marcus (Alice Eve) and a new type of photon torpedo despite objections from Scotty (Simon Pegg).I appreciate the idea of reworking Star Trek 2 in this alternate universe. However if we are to compare the two, there are differences that don't shine a favorable light on this one. Whereas the 1982 original was operatic, poetic, and fun. This one is loud, lumbering, and dark. JJ Abrams must have expected the comparisons. This one is definitely flashier, and better looking. The CG sequences are awe inspiring like most of them today. We have advanced quite a ways.The original was one of good versus evil. They were simple sides. This one, we're trying to use Khan, then we're fighting him. It's not as clean of a storyline. There was a lot of minor questionable things like.... Why hide Enterprise in the ocean? Why put the bodies in the photon torpedoes? How did they get back to Earth all of a sudden? They're all minor and ignorable. But it builds an uneasy sense that something's not right. My analogy is that the 1982 movie is a perfectly solved Rubik's Cube. This one JJ Abrams jumbled all the pieces, put glitter all over it, and photoshop the heck out of it."
Stripes,7,0,1,17 September 2013," The gang being funny
","John Winger (Bill Murray) quits his cab driving job and loses his girlfriend. In addition, he loses his car and his home. His best friend Russell (Harold Ramis) is tired of teaching ESL. John convinces Russell to join the army with him. There they meet fellow recruit Ox (John Candy). Sgt. Hulka (Warren Oates) shapes them up and they're led by the sleazy incompetent Capt. Stillman (John Larroquette). The fact that John and Russell keep getting into trouble means that they continuously encounter MPs Stella (PJ Soles) and Louise (Sean Young).Director Ivan Reitman brings the gang together for a bit of fun. Bill Murray is his sarcastic self. Harold Ramis is a competent sidekick. The best fun was had by John Candy who gets to mud wrestle a whole bevel of beauties. Although not the group's best collaboration, this is still very funny especially if you like Bill Murray's antics."
12 Angry Men,7,1,2,18 April 2016," a movie for actors
","In a NYC courtroom, a first degree murder case against a poor 18 year old boy with a troubled history has just rested. The 12 men of the jury are sent to decide the seemingly open and shut case. They hold a vote and it's 11-1 guilty. Henry Fonda is the only not-guilty vote. He's not sure and wants to spend time discussing the case.This is the classic stage play. I say this meaning it's a bunch of characters in a room. The characters don't even have names. Lee J. Cobb and Jack Warden have the flashiest roles. Henry Fonda is essentially the lead as the central heroic role. He has the nobility. The roles are all filled with first rate character actors. This is an actor's movie. The only drawback is the cinematic potential. In the end, it is 12 men around a table in a room. The visual opportunities are limited. Despite that, the debate interplay is engrossing and the movie is satisfying."
Beauty and the Beast,9,2,3,22 April 2015," Great music and fun simplified story
","A rich and powerful prince dismissed a beggar who turned out to be an enchantress. She turns him into a Beast unless he can learn to love another and earn her love in return before his 21st year. Or else he shall live as the Beast for all times. Belle lives a quiet life in a small provincial town. She's a bookworm fighting off the advances of the conceited arrogant Gaston. Her father is a struggling inventor. He gets lost taking a shortcut to the fair. He seeks shelter from the wolves in the Beast's castle but he's taken prisoner. Belle comes looking for her father and offers to take his place.The songs are catchy and the story has been simplified. There are great animated characters. The film makes some great choices. It starts with the great song from Belle. There are at least 3 great songs when most of the time, two would be amazing for any movie. The simplification of Belle's home life is probably for the best. It leaves more room for the romance between Belle and the Beast. It also gives a great opportunity for these terrific fun characters in the castle. The animation is terrific with a good use of early CGI. It is one of the icons of Disney animation."
The English Patient,7,0,0,25 October 2014," grand romantic epic
","A badly disfigured man suffering from amnesia is brought in to the Allies by the Bedouins. Canadian nurse Hana (Juliette Binoche) has lost many friends including her love. It's near the end of WWII. She brings the dying man to an abandoned Italian mansion to take care of by herself. She is joined by Allied soldier Kip Singh (Naveen Andrews) and David Caravaggio (Willem Dafoe) who claims to know the man from before. The movie flashes back from time to time. The mysterious man is Hungarian map maker Count Laszlo de Almásy (Ralph Fiennes) on an expedition to chart the Sahara desert for the Royal Geographical Society. He is joined by Geoffrey Clifton (Colin Firth) and his wife Katharine (Kristin Scott Thomas) on the expedition. This is an old fashion grand romantic epic. The story is vast like the desert and winding like all great romances. The acting is brilliant by so many great actors. The desert looks hypnotic. It does lack a drive to push the story along its extended running time. At times, the movie goes too slowly. I wonder if the movie would be better without so much back and forth in time."
Hostel,6,0,1,23 June 2015," Eli Roth torture porn
","College guys Paxton (Jay Hernandez) and Josh (Derek Richardson) are traveling in Europe with Icelandic friend Óli. In Amsterdam, they are told about a hostel in Slovakia where they find beautiful women. Their friend Óli is killed but the guys get a text that he has gone home. They meet Kana whose friend Yuki has disappeared as well. Josh gets killed and Paxton goes searching for him. He's taken to an industrial plant where rich people pay to kill.There isn't much more here than torture porn. Eli sometimes adds a few touches like the Bubble Gum gang. That's a bit surreal. However it doesn't do much that is truly surprising. If there's a choice between logic and grotesque, the movie chooses grotesque every time. Of course Paxton has to cut out Kana's dangling eye even if it makes no sense. Jay Hernandez is good enough. Usually horror uses scream queens but this one uses guys. As far as torture porn goes, this is a relatively good one."
"The Chronicles of Narnia: The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe",6,0,4,30 November 2013," Didn't like the bickering kids
","The Chronicles of Narnia is based on the novels by author C.S. Lewis. The four Pevensie siblings are evacuated from London escaping the blitz. They discover a magical wardrobe which is a gateway to Narnia.It's been a long time since I read the books. I wouldn't say it was my favorite. The big complaint I have is the annoying, dumb, bickering, whiny, and unlikeable kids especially Edmund. It makes it hard to root for them. Edmund (Skandar Keynes) looks like he's always on the verge of an evil plan. Lucy (Georgie Henley) is a yappy little thing. And the two older ones (William Moseley, Anna Popplewell) can't stop bickering.Tilda Swinton overplays the evil White Witch early on. She is so evil that it becomes unreasonable that Edmund couldn't see. It is idiotic. She would be better off playing nicer at the start. The good part is the world of Narnia. It does the job. It has the feel of a slightly magical otherly world that is still reminiscent of the real world. The CGI looks good. With all the different creatures, they look realistic enough."
"Crazy, Stupid, Love",8,0,1,2 March 2014," Hilarious, Touching, Love
","Emily Weaver (Julianne Moore) had an affair with David Lindhagen (Kevin Bacon), and she wants a divorce from Cal (Steve Carell). Meanwhile their babysitter Jessica (Analeigh Tipton) is in love with Cal, and their son Robbie (Jonah Bobo) is in love with Jessica. Jacob Palmer (Ryan Gosling) is a real ladies man, and he takes pity on Cal who's been whining about his divorce to everybody in the bar. Jacob does a make-over on Cal, but he finds himself falling for the PG-13 Hannah (Emma Stone).I love everybody and every character in this movie. Carell and Gosling have great comedic chemistry together. I love Gosling insulting Carell. I even love Julianne Moore who was cheating. Analeigh Tipton is adorable in her infatuation, and Jonah Bobo is even more adorable in his. Ryan Gosling has a great dirty dancing bit with Emma Stone, and yes Emma is adorable too. In addition, there is a great scene with supporting actress Marisa Tomei, and Liza Lapira has some great lines about Conan. The only change I would make is to use the alternate ending in the DVD."
Green Room,7,2,5,12 December 2016," simple horror done well
","Pat (Anton Yelchin), Sam (Alia Shawkat), Reece, and Tiger are members of a struggling punk band on the road. They steal gas, work for scraps, and concentrate on playing live. They arrive at a remote bar outside of Portland. It's soon obvious that it's a neo-Nazi hangout. After a contentious set, Pat returns to the green room to retrieve Sam's phone. He sees a murdered girl and tries to call the cops. The band and the dead girl's friend Amber (Imogen Poots) overpower their guard. Senior leader Darcy Banker (Patrick Stewart) is called in.This is a fairly simple horror premise. There are some solid young actors in this. The biggest coup is getting Patrick Stewart to play the big bad. He's a Shakespearian actor throwing his full weight into the role. The young characters are not necessarily the brightest bulb in the lot but that's perfectly fine. Everybody is making mistakes in this chaos. One character does die sooner than I expected and that took some of the air out of the movie for me."
Happy Gilmore,7,1,1,12 April 2015," Adam Sandler is angry funny
",Happy Gilmore (Adam Sandler) is desperate to be a professional hockey player but he's horrible at skating and can't handle the puck. He does however have great intensity and the hardest shot. His grandma (Frances Bay) hasn't paid her taxes and they're confiscating her stuff including her house. He discovers that he can really hit the golf balls and starts hustling golf. Golf pro Chubbs (Carl Weathers) takes him under his wing to join the PGA tour. Shooter McGavin (Christopher McDonald) is the arrogant star golfer. Virginia Venit (Julie Bowen) is public relations for the tour.Adam Sandler is still funny at this point. There is something endearing about a young idiot who still has lots to learn. The compelling part is that his character grows. He's an angry dude and a hilarious one. His character is one that the audience can root for while at the same time laugh at. Sure it's stupid but that's the fun part.
The Notebook,7,0,1,14 June 2014," well made traditional romance
","In a nursing home, Duke (James Garner) reads a romantic story to an old lady (Gena Rowlands) with dementia. The story starts at a carnival in 1940. Noah Calhoun (Ryan Gosling) meets young heiress Allie Hamilton (Rachel McAdams) spending the summer in Seabrook. Noah won't take no for an answer. She eventually let her guard down and spends the summer with the lumber yard worker. Her parents do not approve but let the summer fling go on. Near the end of the summer, they visit an abandoned house called The Windsor Plantation. They are interrupted by Fin (Kevin Connolly) who tells them that her parents had sent out the police for them. He wants to let her go, they fight, and break up. While attending Sarah Lawrence College, Allie's mother (Joan Allen) kept all of Noah's letters. Noah goes to enlist to fight in WWII and Allie volunteers as a nurse. She meets wounded soldier wealthy Lon Hammond Jr (James Marsden). Noah decides to rebuild the plantation house hoping that Allie will return to him.Nicholas Sparks has made a living writing these melodramatic romances. This one has slightly more depth. First there is the power of the Rowlands Garner pairing to give it weight. Their performances keep this grounded and show what real acting is. They are so good that even cheesy dialog sounds great. But what makes this movie stand out is the chemistry between Ryan Gosling and Rachel McAdams. These are two charismatic personalities and they put a lot of energy into their characters. Gosling has the mischievous cool while McAdams has the adorable spirit. I love that they fight harder than most sappy love story. The fighting generates so much passion. Rowlands' son Nick Cassavetes is directing and he does a good job. The fact that James Marsden isn't playing a douche allowed more believable chemistry between Lon and Allie. I like that the choices aren't laid out as good and evil. I don't particularly like that Noah saw Allie and Lon together. It's too coincidental. It's one of many things in this that is too written. Why 365 letters? Couldn't he write one more? It's another cheesy poetic turns that Sparks like so much. Overall, this is a traditional romance done very well staring two very photogenic big personalities."
The Rocker,8,4,4,1 February 2015," Rainn Wilson funny
","In 1986, drummer Fish (Rainn Wilson) gets dropped when the president of the label wants to replace him with his nephew. Twenty years later, the band has become legendary success while he gets fired from his pointless job. He but really his girlfriend Carol breaks up his relationship. He's forced to live with his sister Lisa and her family. His nerdy nephew Matt (Josh Gad) has a garage band with Amelia (Emma Stone) and Curtis (Teddy Geiger). They lose their drummer and are forced to ask Fish to play with them at prom. It doesn't go well and he goes to apologize. He meets Curtis' mother Kim (Christina Applegate). Lisa kicks Fish out of the house and then their practice with a naked Fish goes viral.Rainn Wilson is terrific playing this character. He's been playing the same self-delusional slightly-angry loud-mouthed damaged character. The greatness comes from the fact that he's still likable while being a jerk. Sure, it's formulaic sweetness and copying other movies like 'School of Rock'. I don't see that as a defect. The three kids are well cast. Geiger is a good tortured lead and he can sing too. Emma Stone is the adorably dark Emma Stone. Josh Gad is a great nerd."
Public Enemies,6,1,1,3 June 2015," digital look for period piece
","It's 1933. John Dillinger (Johnny Depp) is brought into prison but he's actually leading a prison break. He and his gang goes on a bank robbing spree around Chicago. After killing Pretty Boy Floyd, FBI agent Melvin Purvis (Christian Bale) is assigned by J. Edgar Hoover to hunt down Public Enemy #1 John Dillinger. Dillinger falls for nightclub singer Billie Frechette (Marion Cotillard).Director Michael Mann's decision to use digital and his modern style seems very intriguing until I actually see it. There is something disconcerting about this modern way of filming done on a period piece. The incongruity is off-putting. It's missing its heart. Depp and Cotillard are two of the greatest actors around but their chemistry is tepid. I like Depp and Bale in their roles. The action is brutal as in most Mann movies. There are lots to like but the overall feeling is an opportunity lost."
The Babadook,8,4,6,22 October 2015," great indie horror
","Amelia is a single mom struggling with hyper-active 6 year old son Samuel with a constant need for weapons to defend himself from unseen monsters. Her husband died in a car accident driving her to the hospital to have Samuel. The school is scared to keep him with the other kids. Even her sister Claire is afraid of Samuel especially to play with her own daughter Ruby. She finds a disturbing children's book about the Babadook. This sets off a scary series of events.Normally, I hate annoying kids but this kid is brilliantly annoying. It's such a fascinating character and the mother's suffering can really be felt. I did expect this to turn into a monster movie but it becomes more of a psychological thriller which is perfectly great. The turn in Amelia is terrific. On a minor note, a scarier Babadook could have been even better."
Madagascar,5,0,2,2 November 2013," Fun chemistry but uncomfortable story
","Lion Alex (Ben Stiller), Zebra Marty (Chris Rock), Giraffe Melman (David Schwimmer), and Hippo Gloria (Jada Pinkett Smith) are best friends and stars at New York's Central Park Zoo. When Marty escapes, the gang goes after him. Once they're captured, they find themselves being transfered to Kenya Wildlife Preserve. Only the Penguins muck everything up, and the group is stranded in the wilds of Madagascar.This is a fun group of characters. It works great for a while. However it goes to an uncomfortable place with Alex being hungry and his friends looking more like food. It's a very dark storyline for a kid's movie. It doesn't fit. It needs to find its happy place."
The Other Boleyn Girl,6,2,2,12 October 2016," costumed soap opera
","Anne Boleyn (Natalie Portman) is the older sister embodying the hopes of her family. Mary (Scarlett Johansson) is the other sister and her good heart is not seen as being useful. With no male heir, King Henry VIII (Eric Bana) is frustrated with his marriage to Catherine of Aragon after a stillborn male baby. The Duke of Norfolk (David Morrissey) sees a way to introduce his niece as a mistress to the king. Sir Thomas Boleyn (Mark Rylance) and Norfolk's sister Lady Elizabeth Boleyn (Kristin Scott Thomas) offer the more outgoing unmarried Anne. Instead, the king is taken with the shy Mary who recently married William Carey (Benedict Cumberbatch) hoping for a quiet life. Mary is ordered to be the king's mistress and one of the queen's ladies-in-waiting. The family joins her in court as they gain in prestige. Anne secretly marries nobleman Henry Percy and tells her brother George (Jim Sturgess). George tells Mary who then tells her parents fearing a scandal over Percy who is engaged to another arranged by the king. Anne is exiled to the French court. She would return to take the king from Mary. She would give birth to future queen Elizabeth. Mary is widowed and remarries William Stafford (Eddie Redmayne). Ambitious courtesan Jane Parker (Juno Temple) marries George and would cause a great royal scandal.Anne seems to be written as the flamboyant sister while Mary is the shy one. Portman is older than Johansson and that does fit the Boleyn sisters. However, I think Johansson and Portman are more fit in personality to switch their roles. It's pushing through a lot of plot and the material may be better for a TV series. The actors are capable and the story is fascinating. The execution is a little flat but still very watchable as a vast costume soap opera."
Bloody Sunday,9,4,12,11 February 2004," immersed into this world
","It's 1972 Derry, Northern Ireland. Ivan Cooper (James Nesbitt) organizes a march against Unionist rule. Events spiral out of control and British Army paratroopers fire on the protesters.Director Paul Greengrass perfects his shaky-cam action in this historical drama. He shoots in an almost documentary way. It brings the horrors and chaos of the situation. The action does not need computer graphics, or pyrotechnics. Everybody NEEDS to see this for both it's history and film making. This movie immerses the audience into this world. The film cuts the scenes into small few seconds sequences separated by fade outs. This mimics the fragmentary nature of memory and was extremely effective in creating a very realistic feel. As to the facts of the film, another person smarter than me will have to judge."
Us,7,5,7,31 August 2019," intriguing but flawed
","In 1986, a girl wanders away from her father in a carnival fair. She is shocked by a doppelganger. In the present day, the Wilson family is on vacation. They are shocked by their own doppelgangers wearing red overalls and armed with scissors.I like the comedy when they happen. The horror isn't that horrific but it is intriguing. What I love most about the horror is its unknowable premise. That it is unknowable until the movie tries to let us know it. It's actually a lot more creepy when these unknown doppelgangers appear out of nowhere without explanations. The problem starts with the opening text. The knowledge of tunnels is unnecessary. It's a piece of a puzzle which is better left unsolved. The present day story should really end after the news report on the TV. It can then go back to 1986 for that surprise reveal but it's not necessary to try to explain the world beneath. I do like the final twist but it doesn't need more than that. Jordan Peele has a pretty good concept but it's not as clever as he thinks it is. That's why the harder he attempts to explain, the less interesting it is."
"South Park: Bigger, Longer & Uncut",7,0,0,28 September 2014," A lot of poop jokes and some of them are hilarious
","The boys go to the Canadian Terrance & Phillip movie 'Asses of Fire' and find that it's rated R. They get a homeless bum to buy the tickets. They start repeating sayings from the movie and corrupting the other kids. Sheila leads a fight and arrests Terrance & Phillip. This starts a war against Canada. Kenny falls into Hell where Saddam Hussein is Satan's pushy lover. The Mothers Against Canada even put in a V-chip in Cartman. Stan, Kyle and Cartman decide to save Terrence and Phillip before they are executed.It's irreverent and funny. I don't get offended easily. This isn't in danger of offending me. It's a lot of crude language. Making fun of Canadians is pretty safe. Let's face it. Blame Canada is pretty catchy. In the end, this is a lot defecation jokes and some of them are actually hilarious. It's probably much funnier for fans of South Park but it's still a fun time for anybody who doesn't get offended."
The Danish Girl,7,0,1,21 March 2016," beautifully shot with good performances
","Einar Wegener (Eddie Redmayne) is a well received Danish painter in the early 20th century. His wife Gerda (Alicia Vikander) is less well received. Gerda uses Einar's feminine side Lili as the subject of her paintings. Gerda starts to gain recognition while Lili starts going out dressed up. It's a struggle for both partners. Eventually, Lili seeks a full sex reassignment surgery.This is beautifully shot and Redmayne delivers a solid performance. Alicia Vikander is the acting power behind the throne. In the end, the movie lacks drama. Einar never faces insurmountable hurdles. Gerda is utterly supportive. There is limited tension. The plot doesn't have any surprises considering the subject matter. Also I never get the sense of Lili's point of view. It is so far from what most people experiences. More than any other subject, director Tom Hooper needs to put the audience into the shoes of the protagonist. The movie fails to do that. It's still beautiful and the two actors are terrific but it is very much like one of Einar's landscapes. It is expertly made but I don't really feel it."
Elizabeth,8,0,0,21 February 2016," brilliant Cate Blanchett
","It's 1554 England. Henry VIII is dead. The Catholic Queen Mary is burning Protestants. Her half-sister Elizabeth (Cate Blanchett) is a threat to her crown and is imprisoned. Duke of Norfolk (Christopher Eccleston) is the heavy-handed henchman desperate to get the dying Queen to sign Elizabeth's death warrant. Elizabeth is in love with Robert Dudley, Earl of Leicester (Joseph Fiennes). After gaining the throne, she faces challenges from Norfolk, Mary Queen of the Scots and others from outside the country. Her main counsel William Cecil, 1st Baron Burghley (Richard Attenborough) urges her to marry well to protect the throne. Francis Walsingham (Geoffrey Rush) returns from exile to be her adviser. After a defeat to Mary of Guise, she must consider Mary's wild nephew Duc d'Anjou (Vincent Cassel). This is more than a costume drama. Director Shekhar Kapur brings an urgency to the proceedings. The deadly politics is more thrilling than a massive battle. Cate Blanchett is beyond brilliant. It's her first breakout role. She fits the role perfectly as a princess working her way to becoming a great queen."
The Girl Next Door,5,0,1,13 March 2015," teen sex romp
",Matthew Kidman (Emile Hirsch) is a straight A student council president who looks back at his high school life without really living to the fullest. He gets into Georgetown and is trying to get a scholarship. He and his friends Eli (Chris Marquette) and Klitz (Paul Dano) are outsiders. Then Danielle (Elisha Cuthbert) moves in next door and Matthew falls for her hard. Porn obsessed Eli recognizes Danielle from a video. They break up and then he finds her with her old boyfriend porn producer Kelly (Timothy Olyphant).It has some funny moments mostly from Chris Marquette. It's a sharp take on the teen sex romp. Emile Hirsch is way too whiny. It has a bit of Risky Business but it's also uncomfortable adult. It takes a wrong turn going to the porn convention. It overloads on the adult entertainment side and stops being a fun teen sex romp. It would be helpful to develop the other high school characters and less with the adult entertainers.
Ice Age: The Meltdown,6,4,4,9 December 2013," Fun for Kids
","The three friends find their valley is about to be flooded from all the surrounding ice melt. Manny (Ray Romano) is starting to wonder if he truly is the last mammoth, when he meets Ellie (Queen Latifah). Only she thinks she's a possum, with her possum brothers Crash (Seann William Scott) and Eddie (Josh Peck). Manny along with Sid (John Leguizamo) and Diego (Denis Leary) must lead the group to safety at the other end of the valley.It's a good sequel to this kids franchise. I like the group chemistry most of all. There is limited laughs for adults but little kids do love it. Sid continues to be my favorite. I bet he's a fan favorite for most. The group battles not only time, but also a prehistoric sea creature. It provides some good action. I would definitely recommend this for the kids, but less so for the adults."
Prince of Persia: The Sands of Time,5,0,1,20 August 2014," too much exposition slows down beginning
","It's the ancient empire of Persia in the Royal City of Nasaf. King Sharaman rules the empire with his brother Nizam (Ben Kingsley). Sharaman has two sons and adopts the brave orphan Dastan (Jake Gyllenhaal). As young men, he's in a campaign to subdue Koshkhan. There is news that the City of Alamut ruled by Princess Tamina (Gemma Arterton) is making weapons for their enemy. Nizam convinces Prince Tus (Richard Coyle) to attack despite misgivings from Dastan. Dastan is able to win the battle with his skillful attack. He recovers a special dagger during the battle. King Sharaman is angry at Tus for invading the holy city. He sets Tamina to marry Dastan instead of Tus. Then the robe, which is originally from Tus and convinced Dastan to gift to King Sharaman, kills the king. Dastan is accused of regicide and he escapes along with Tamina. The dagger turns out to be a powerful weapon that can turn back time.The Byzantium backstory kills the pacing of this movie at the start. It's a quick death by exposition. Gyllenhaal isn't charming enough or compelling enough. Arterton is just angry all the time. This is a lot of sand and a lot of action overload. It's not irredeemable but the problems wore me out. I wonder if a small break could help the leads develop some more chemistry. It's almost passable but..."
Balls of Fury,6,0,3,25 June 2016," stupid and kinda funny
","Randy Daytona (Dan Fogler) used to be a ping pong prodigy. Nineteen years earlier, he lost a big match and his father was killed by the triads for losing his bet. Today, he's a dining theater act. FBI Agent Rodriguez (George Lopez) recruits him to track down arch-criminal Feng (Christopher Walken) who is hosting an underground ping pong tournament. After initial rust, Rodriguez directs him to Wong (James Hong) and his niece Maggie (Maggie Q) for training. He is given the golden paddle as an invite to the secret tournament in Central America.This is extremely stupid. It's a little funny. It's not mean-spirited. Dan Fogler is a nice lead but not necessarily a top one. The comedy doesn't always hit. This is better than most but not really that great."
Ted,7,0,2,17 August 2013," take it or leave it
","John Bennett's childhood wish made his teddy bear Ted (Seth MacFarlane) alive. It's 27 years later, and a talking teddy bear is no longer shocking. John (Mark Wahlberg) is dating Lori Collins (Mila Kunis). John considers breaking up with Ted.Some people love Seth MacFarlane. I could go either way. It's definitely low brow broad grade school humor. There's nothing subtle about it. No detailed explanation is given for Ted and none is really needed. The sad part of the partnership is that Ted overshadows Mark Wahlberg in acting skills. Mila Kunis is no wallflower and she can keep up with the boys. The film is complicated unnecessarily by Giovanni Ribisi's kidnapping scheme. It disjoints the movie. Its serious nature causes great disruption but there's enough funny moments to overlook these minor irritants."
Coffee and Cigarettes,5,0,1,29 August 2015," Love one
","Jim Jarmusch creates black and white vignettes of some interesting people drinking coffee (tea for some) and having cigarettes.I love 'Twins'. Joie Lee and Cinqué Lee are twins. They are interrupted by Steve Buscemi, the waiter. It's hilarious with the crows Heckle and Jeckle. Then it's a lot of fun with Elvis Presley's twin. Buscemi delivers it perfectly.The only other one I'm interested in is 'Cousins?'. Actors Alfred Molina and Steve Coogan have some fun drinking tea. Molina discovered a long lost distant family connection but Coogan could not care less. Coogan is good at playing irreverent comedy which he turns douchy here. The writing could be a lot tighter. This is a good starting point.The rest range from slightly interesting to bland forgettable. Wu-Tang Clan with Bill Murray could have been funnier. The two Cate Blanchetts are visually interesting. The White Stripes is interesting because Meg is speaking. All these are interesting but not that compelling. Of the 11 vignettes, I only really love one."
Knives Out,7,1,2,26 May 2020," intrigued
","Wealthy murder mystery novelist Harlan Thrombey (Christopher Plummer) is dead from a presumed suicide. The investigating police is joined by dapper private detective Benoit Blanc (Daniel Craig) who was hired by an unknown person. It's a family of annoying backbiting leeches and Harlan's kindly nurse Marta Cabrera (Ana de Armas) who cannot lie without vomiting.Quite frankly, the movie is a fifty-fifty proposition for the first half. The family is so annoying and Daniel Craig is trying so hard to act. I really need him to stop his accent work. His character would be perfectly great with a British accent. It's all far too peculiar as Rian Johnson is doing his Brick work. The movie reveals the death early on and it seemed obviously from the very beginning that it boils down to the tox screen. She's on the hook as soon as that reveals her mistake. Non of it can cover that up. It becomes a lot of running around in circles.Then something happens that hooks me into the movie. I started rooting for her to escape Blanc's questioning. The vomiting starts as a silly gimmick at first but ends up helping build a good amount of tension. The last incident is obvious even before it starts but it's still fun. The tox screen is the flashing warning sign throughout the early parts even if it's never mentioned. I kept waiting. When it finally shows up as a major plot point, it seems problematic since there are bound to be copies. Chris Evans adds a great energy in the second half. Despite the nagging questions, it becomes a fun rollercoaster ride. It's a lot of ups and downs but it's never in doubt that it will roll safely to an exit. One thing that bugs me more than most. I don't know what Fran assumes about Ransom's scheme. She sees him tampering with the drugs but she steals the bag. What's the point of that? She steals a copy of the report but the original is bound to come out. What's the point of that? She blackmails him and meets him alone in an empty laundromat. What's the point of that? I don't think Fran's actions make any sense and is nothing more than a series of necessary moves for plot advancement which can all be excuse with Blanc saying that she doesn't even know what's happening. I have come to see Rian Johnson as a filmmaker with interesting style but sometimes his convoluted stories do not favor deeper examinations. Overall, I really got into this movie despite whatever nagging reservations I had about the plot."

","It was 1988 Seoul and Oh Dae-Su got drunk on his daughter's birthday. After his friend Joo-Hwan got him out of the police station, he is kidnapped off the streets. He is imprisoned in a motel-like cell. He gets gassed periodically without explanation. After 15 years, he is released from a giant suitcase on top of a building. There's a strange guy with a poodle who falls to his death. A bum gives him money and a cellphone. A mysterious man calls to taunt him. He passes out in a sushi restaurant and the cute chef Mi-do takes him home. They both have had hallucinations of ants. His daughter is adopted and living in Stockholm after his wife was murder and he's assumed to be the culprit. He discovers the prison where he was imprisoned. The wealthy Lee Woo-jin reveals himself as his tormentor with a deadly threat against every women that he loves.As I watched this, I kept thinking of David Lynch and to lesser extend Quentin Tarantino. It's got the bloody violent revenge plot at the center of this. What I love more is the weird surreal touches. There's no way that a guy is going to eat a live octopus in any Hollywood movie. It is such a strange plot move to find a place by how a dumpling taste. It takes the cool violent movie to a weird off-kilter place."
Spider-Man 2,8,1,2,29 January 2014," Fun Compelling Popcorn Movie

Mary Jane Watson (Kirsten Dunst) is having some success on Broadway. Meanwhile Harry Osborn (James Franco) hasn't lost his hatred of Spidey. He is now funding Dr. Otto Octavius (Alfred Molina) and his work on fusion. However something goes wrong in his demonstration and a new villain is born.Director Sam Raimi is able to inject a bit of spidey fun in this movie. The internal struggle in Peter Parker about his identity is very compelling. And Alfred Molina makes for a great villain. I especially like J.K. Simmons as Jameson. They're great characters. As for the CGI, they look very nice without looking like a video game. I like the arms and I like the web swinging. It's a well put together movie and may be even better than the first."
The Secret in Their Eyes,7,5,6,24 February 2014," Interesting ending from Argentine movie
",Retired federal agent Benjamín Espósito (Ricardo Darín) wants to write a novel about an old case of the brutal rape and murder of Liliana Coloto. His old boss Irene is still working in the justice department and isn't really happy with him poking around. The case still has some questions about the main suspect Isidoro Gómez who was released early.This is an Argentine movie. Ricardo Darín is very compelling as the lead. I really like the sense of era and place of the movie. It does take a little while to get started. It uses flashbacks to go back and forth. That structure and the subtitles can suffocate the pace and tension from building up. However it gets going nicely with a very interesting ending.
The Irishman,7,3,9,17 January 2020," old man Scorsese
","Elderly Frank Sheeran (Robert De Niro) in a nursing home recounts his life in the mob. He murders prisoners in WWII. He drives a truck and steals slabs of beef from the back. He is caught but he wins his trial. He is introduced to various mob bosses and befriends Russell Bufalino (Joe Pesci). He becomes the right hand man of Teamsters president Jimmy Hoffa (Al Pacino).They don't make directors like Martin Scorsese anymore and they don't make movies like this anymore. Quite frankly, at two and a half hour, this may fit better as a TV mini-series. Only his name makes this a cinematic experience. While it is beautifully filmed, nothing really screams big screen. It is detailed and methodical. The problem is that it is a movie about a cold-hearted character. He is unmoved about his violent ways until the last act. His criminality is not fun. His brutality has no humanity. He is psychopath and not an enjoyable one. It is a movie from the past, by the past, and about the past. While I am in awe of the filmmaking expertise, I find the character has limited appeal. Scorsese is going over old grounds. His perfect movies have already been made. This can never exceed them."
Billy Elliot,6,1,3,19 July 2014," Julie Walters and Gary Lewis
","It's Durham Coalfield, North East England 1984. There is a violent strike against Thatcher and the scabs working the coal mines. Billy Elliot (Jamie Bell) lives with widower father Jackie (Gary Lewis) and older brother Tony. Both of them are former miners who would take a dim view of Billy's love of dance. His Grandma is losing her mind. Instead of boxing, he starts going to Mrs. Wilkinson (Julie Walters)'s all girls ballet class.Director Stephen Daldry is trying too hard to cute this one up. Billy doesn't have to dance in the boxing ring. He just has to be pathetic. Jamie Bell is a good little actor but he looks too angry to be funny. His jumping around is quirky but not hilarious. He's better to be quietly hiding instead of confronting his father. I wouldn't call this feel-good. It's Julie Walters and Gary Lewis who elevates the material. They're are a couple of veteran actors who bring substance to this fanciful tale."

His boss Hall (Delroy Lindo) has a case of extreme unusual robberies. Utah recognizes them to be part of the Ozaki 8, eight spiritual Herculean tasks with extreme natural forces. He gets help from Angelo Pappas (Ray Winstone) and infiltrates a group led by Bodhi (Édgar Ramírez). He becomes close to Samsara Dietz (Teresa Palmer).It starts with a ridiculous CGI action scene. This movie has plenty of them. They may be the only compelling goodness derived from this movie. The action is over-the-top and somewhat fun. The story and the actors are another matter. It starts with the very bland Luke Bracey. It's another hunky Aussie. There is nothing to the character and he's unable to inject anything into it. It's hard to remember sometimes but Keanu Reeves has an unique charm that really works well in certain movies. In this one, the movie grinds to a halt whenever there is no action. Also it's hyper-unreal that Utah keeps finding these people in the vast ocean. Realism is not expected but some of the unrealism is oddly annoying."
The Fifth Element,8,6,9,26 January 2014," Luc Besson creates fun sci-fi
","It's 300 years after the previous visit, a Mondoshawan spaceship is bringing the Fifth Element back to Earth to defeat a coming great evil. However it is destroyed by the evil Mangalores on the behest of the greedy Zorg (Gary Oldman). A team of scientists use the DNA found at the crash site to recreate the Fifth Element, a perfect warrior called Leeloo (Milla Jovovich). She escapes from the laboratory and drops in on taxi driver Korben Dallas (Bruce Willis). He helps her find Father Vito Cornelius (Ian Holm) to bring the five elements together to defeat the evil.This is a great looking sci-fi movie from director Luc Besson. It proves that big sci-fi production is not just an American domain. Luc Besson brings an entirely different sense and visual look to the genre. It is artistic and wonderful. The fashion from Jean-Paul Gaultier really sets this apart. Bruce Willis does his John McClane persona once again. Milla Jovovich makes the best entrance, and Chris Tucker is wacky funny. It is visual candy coated fun."

When an allied bomber accidentally destroyed her hiding place, she tries to escape to liberated territories. The escaping Jews get caught and massacred but Rachel survives. She is rescued by the resistance and gets into dangerous operations. Eventually she infiltrates the Nazi world.Director Paul Verhoeven is bringing Nazis, Holocaust, and resistance fully into erotic violent pulp territories. It is unabashed in its noir thriller mentality. There is something oddly unreal about it. The last act has a few too many unnecessary twists, but it's nevertheless compelling and exciting."
127 Hours,8,0,1,18 July 2015," impressive work from Boyle and Franco
","It's 2003. Aron Ralston (James Franco) goes out into the desert to do some bike riding and rock climbing. He encounters hikers Kristi (Kate Mara) and Megan (Amber Tamblyn). The girls invite him to a party the next day but as he continues his hike alone, he falls down a crevice and gets his hand stuck under a boulder. It's 127 hours of struggle as he tries in vain and finally decides to cut off his arm.On the surface, this is not a very cinematic story. The guy is stuck in a crevice. It doesn't allow for much movement. The three people falling through the rocks is a fun opening. Then Danny Boyle does everything to garner interesting visuals. Franco is very effective in what is essentially an one-man play in much of the movie. It's an impressive piece of work from both Franco and Boyle."
Pirate Radio,6,0,1,7 March 2016," meandering long comedy
",It's 1966. Official radio rarely plays the popular rock music of the era. Some pirate radio stations pop up broadcasting from international waters. Carl (Tom Sturridge) got expelled from school and arrives at his godfather Quentin (Bill Nighy)'s Radio Rock ship in the North Sea. It's staffed by various oddballs like American DJ The Count (Philip Seymour Hoffman). They are allowed to bring female friends aboard sometimes. Government minister Sir Alistair Dormandy (Kenneth Branagh) and his sidekick Domenic Twatt (Jack Davenport) try to shut the radio station down through legal loopholes. Quentin brings legendary DJ Gavin Kavanagh (Rhys Ifans) out of retirement.I like the various characters but the story meanders too much. It's like a run-on sentence that runs out of steam. This show should simply follow Carl and watch the fascinating wild times from his point of view. The movie starts out fine but the light humor fades quickly. Maybe Tom Sturridge is not big enough to hold center stage against this wacky cast of characters. This is a great era for music although the movie seems to be more about the rotation of beautiful babes. I would rather have the girl stay on the ship for the entire trip and have a real relationship.

It has some funny moments especially with Thomas Lennon and throwing up on Jon Favreau. But Paul Rudd solo desperately needs a wing man. That's what the movie is about. But the comedy is hit and miss without it. Rudd and Segal have good chemistry. Mostly it works well. There are some good funny jokes in this."
Batman Returns,8,1,2,4 January 2014," Almost as good with Michelle Pfeiffer licking herself
","Tim Burton returns to direct the second Batman movie. Evil businessman Max Shreck (Christopher Walken) intends to build a 'powerplant' that does nothing but help himself. Danny DeVito plays The Penguin who was abandoned as a baby and now lives in the sewer. Selina Kyle (Michelle Pfeiffer) is the timid assistant to Max Shreck until she discovers his evil plans. He pushes her out the window, and she turns into Catwoman.The Penguin is no Joker. He really isn't anything that could be deemed superior to the Joker. The good thing is that they put in Michelle Pfeiffer as Catwoman. She is much better than all the screaming from Kim Basinger. And the movie still has that Tim Burton style. All in all, it's almost as good as the first Batman movie. The best thing here is Michelle Pfeiffer. Who could ever forget Michelle cleaning herself?"
Finding Nemo,8,1,2,5 April 2015," hilarious Dory
","Clown fish Marlin and Coral start a new brood. Coral battles and loses to a barracuda. Only Marlin and one egg survive. Respecting Coral's wish, he names him Nemo and becomes an overprotective parent. Nemo sees a boat in the open waters. After being berated and belittled by Marlin, Nemo swims out and is captured by scuba divers. Marlin tries desperately to follow them with the help of turtles and Dory with short term memory lost. Meanwhile Nemo finds himself in the dental office aquarium and he must organize a break-out. The animation is great and the story is terrific. It's PIXAR after all. The best thing is Ellen DeGeneres as Dory. She is hilarious and she's does great voice work. The short term memory lost is insanely funny."
Blade,6,2,4,31 October 2013," fun action
","Blade (Wesley Snipes) is born to a mother who was bit by a vampire. This gave him superpowers which he uses to battle evil vampires with the help of Whistler (Kris Kristofferson). The robotic acting from Wesley Snipes and the constant cool pose fighting are what makes this a fun watch.The story seems like just filler for the next action scene. Stephen Dorff and Udo Kier make for good creepy villains. The dialog is fairly lackluster. The production value is good for this B-movie. It does have a dull look to it all, and needs more flash. If you love blood splattering gore, this is a good watch.N'Bushe Wright plays the doctor that Blade rescues from a vampire. She's not up to scratch. She doesn't have the screen presence or the joyful innocence to provide a good foil to Snipes. She's almost as robotic as Blade."
Superbad,8,4,6,16 February 2014," Hilarious Jonah Hill and the nerdy Michael Cera
","Seth (Jonah Hill) and Evan (Michael Cera) are high school best friends and nerdy outsiders. It's almost the end of high school, and they're going their separate ways. Their weird friend Fogell (Christopher Mintz-Plasse) claims to be getting a fake ID. Seth is hot for friendly Jules (Emma Stone). When Jules invites Seth to her party, he volunteers to buy the booze. He's counting on Fogell to get the alcohol, but his fake ID name says McLOVIN.I love the friendship between Jonah Hill and Michael Cera. Jonah is the break out star. He is hilariously loud. And McLOVIN will forever live on. For these and so much more, this movie is crazy funny.The only problem is that Officer Slater (Bill Hader) and Officer Michaels (Seth Rogen) are way too silly. They're drawing focus away from the kids. It's a mistake. The movie is about the kids. They should be the ones doing stupid things. They should be the ones having the hilarities. The cops should be more straight. That way it would be more relatable, and much more funny."
Creed,8,0,1,7 June 2016," back to the beginning
",Adonis 'Donnie' Johnson (Michael B. Jordan) is the illegitimate son of boxing champ Apollo Creed. He was born after his father's death in the ring and spent his childhood in juvenile detention until rescued by Mary Anne Creed (Phylicia Rashad). He fights in Mexico and quits his office job in favor of boxing. Mary opposes it and he's prevented from training. He seeks out Rocky Balboa (Sylvester Stallone) in Philly to train him. He falls for downstairs neighbor Bianca (Tessa Thompson). Champ 'Pretty' Ricky Conlan injures his opponent during a media event and takes on the newcomer for the money.This is going back to the original. Adonis is the new Rocky. He's got the inner fire. He's got the sweet romance. I am glad that Rocky finally puts up his gloves for good. This gets back to its roots with a well-written story and compelling characters. There is a big fight midway in the movie that is one continuous shot. It reminds the audience of how new the original was with its fighting sequences. The sequence is a master work and beautiful to behold. This is a good rejuvenation and a new jolt to an old franchise.
The Great Dictator,7,0,3,20 March 2014," Too soon?
","Bumbling Jewish soldier (Charlie Chaplin) was lucky to survive WWI. He leaves the hospital years later suffering memory lost thinking he's gone for only a few weeks. Ruthless dictator Adenoid Hynkel (Charlie Chaplin) has taken over the nation of Tomainia. The Jewish soldier returns to his barbershop in the ghettos. He gets into a fight with the storm troopers and earns the heart of the defiant washer woman Hannah (Paulette Goddard). He's about to be hung on a lamp post, but is rescue by Commander Schultz whom he saved during WWI. Then Hynkel loosens the reins on the Jews to attract a loan from a Jewish banker.I appreciate the attempt, but like 9/11, there were attempted jokes right after that was too soon. It's also too on-the-nose. Chaplin is playing the Jewish barber as the tramp lite. The story just doesn't quite have the comedy or the heart. Standing up to the storm troopers is the most compelling for the barber. Meanwhile dictator Hynkel is more weird than funny. It's how I feel about playing with the balloon globe. It's quirky weird but I would never laugh at it. Napaloni is a funnier dictator. Then there is the big final speech. Chaplin puts all his heart into it. Again I appreciate the attempt. It was probably more compelling back in the day. For all the appreciation at the political statement, I'm giving it a good score but not for any comedy."
X-Men Origins: Wolverine,6,1,2,17 March 2014," All testosterone no fun
","This movie starts with Victor and his sick younger brother James in 1845 Canada. James kills the man who claims to be his father. The brothers fight together from one war to the next. In Vietnam, the brothers are supposed to be executed but end up recruited by Stryker (Danny Huston) joining a group of other mutants. James aka Logan (Hugh Jackman) quits the group leaving Victor (Liev Schreiber) for a life of a lumberjack with girlfriend Kayla Silverfox (Lynn Collins). Victor is hunting down the old team, and Stryker comes by to try to bring Logan back in. When Victor kills Kayla, Logan wants revenge and he's willing to get back in with Stryker who infuses him with adamantium.It's a lot of growling testosterone without the lighter moments. It's all about Logan's anger without any fun or comedy. Liev is fine and I would like to dig more into his character. They've put quite a few X-Men in this movie. It is probably trying to cover too much origins in this movie. This should be more Cain and Abel. Victor should be as important in this movie. This movie needs a good storyteller and not just somebody to check off a checklist. I'm not sure director Gavin Hood is the man for the job. The movie becomes overloaded."
How to Lose a Guy in 10 Days,5,0,1,6 September 2014," attempt at a rom-farce
",Andie Anderson (Kate Hudson) writes fluff for Composure magazine and longs for more substantive articles. She has a work friend Jeannie (Annie Parisse). Her other flustered friend Michelle Rueben (Kathryn Hahn) is the inspiration for a new article for her boss Lana Jong (Bebe Neuwirth) 'How to Lose a Guy in 10 Days'. Benjamin Barry (Matthew McConaughey) is an advertising executive competing with co-workers Judy Spears (Michael Michele) and Judy Green (Shalom Harlow) for the right to pitch the biggest diamond merchant. Spears and Green know about the article. They come up with a contest to have Benjamin seduce Andie in 10 days for the right from their boss Phillip Warren (Robert Klein) to do the pitch.The problem for this rom-com is that both parties are faking it. It makes it hard to decipher any real chemistry in the relationship. It's not until Andie meets the family does the romance starts. It's a very late start. They are good at their jobs and pull it off. However there is a real need for both of them to sacrifice something to push the romance over the top. The comedy part has some good points. The problem there is that it feels very one directional. It's all about Andie annoying Ben. It would be better if Ben actually had a deeper game. He's very superficial. He needs the girl but it seems like he's just not bringing the whole playbook. He needs to show that he's really trying rather than passively taking it from Andie. It's an attempt at something different than the traditional rom-com but it's not all together successful.
That Thing You Do!,7,0,1,8 June 2016," personification of Tom Hanks
","It's 1964 Erie, Pennsylvania. Drummer Guy Patterson (Tom Everett Scott) chases flirtatious Tina Powers (Charlize Theron) and unhappily works at the family appliance store. Faye Dolan (Liv Tyler) is the girlfriend of Jimmy Mattingly (Johnathon Schaech) who leads a band with Lenny Haise (Steve Zahn), T. B. Player (Ethan Embry), and Chad (Giovanni Ribisi). They get Guy to join after Chad breaks his arm and come up with the name 'Oneders' (supposedly pronounced Wonders). Guy's fast beats force the band to change their song 'That Thing You Do' during a competition. The guys sign with manager Phil Horace living out of his camper. They go to Pittsburgh. Mr. White (Tom Hanks) signs them to Play-Tone Records and promptly changes the spelling of their name to The Wonders.This is very much the personification of the Tom Hanks and his sunshine personality. It is fun, mostly happy, deliberately light even when the movie touches on darker issues, and has a catchy tune. It's good that the song is catchy because the movie plays it a lot. The visual is immaculately perky 60s. This is a happy Disney version of an one-hit-wonder rock group. The actors are beautiful. This is not to say this is a blindly perky film. It doesn't dig too deeply in the darker corners."
Alexander,4,1,1,5 April 2015," Such a grand failure
","Old Ptolemy (Anthony Hopkins) recounts the great age of Alexander who ended tyranny. In Pella, Macedonia 350BC, Alexander is the son of Olympias (Angelina Jolie). Alexander (Colin Farrell) would learn from his teacher Aristotle (Christopher Plummer) and take over after his father Philip (Val Kilmer)'s death. He would take his men from Macedonia to conquer the rest of the known world and beyond.Aside from all of the historical inaccuracies, this movie is missing the greatness from Alexander the Great. It tries to do so much that it doesn't have any heart. The characters lack any real blood or substance. It feels like a very long, slightly confused high school history lesson. The use of Hopkins to recount the story also subtracts from the immediacy. There are some big action scenes but Oliver Stone doesn't do so well with the characters. It's also very strange to have a shinny blonde Colin Farrell. It's an ill-advised move."
Hot Fuzz,8,1,1,17 January 2016," funny
","London Police Constable Nicholas Angel (Simon Pegg) is a try-hard. He's too good at his job making everybody else look bad. He gets promoted and transferred out into the country. He starts his new job by arresting his new partner Danny (Nick Frost), the son of chief inspector Frank Butterman (Jim Broadbent). Sandford, Gloucestershire seems to be a sleepy little town until a series of murders occurs. Simon Skinner (Timothy Dalton) owns the local supermarket.Edgar Wright and Simon Pegg mine the plentiful material from cop dramas to bring a dryly funny satirical take on the genre. This has Edgar's quick edit style. Pegg and Frost continue their great chemistry with Edgar for almost a decade. It also serves as a fun whodunnit mystery. It's choked full of big British stars doing cameos. The last act does get overwhelmed with gun action and the guys struggle to maintain the comedy. They took the Bad Boys and Point Break motif too seriously. Overall, this may not be a comedy for everybody but it's a comedy for me."
The Mummy,8,1,2,20 September 2013," Fun
","Evelyn Carnahan (Rachel Weisz) wants to start an archaeological dig at the ancient city of Hamunaptra. Rick O'Connell (Brendan Fraser) is arrested for stealing but was rescued by Evelyn. Together along with her brother Jonathan (John Hannah), they are racing with another group of explorers. Unfortunately for everyone, the curse of the Mummy is unleashed.Brendan Fraser is having a lot fun playing this Indiana Jones like character. And he has fun chemistry with Rachel Weisz. They have a great back and forth. The adventure is again fun. That's the key word for this film, fun."
Constantine,6,0,0,22 March 2014," Good possibilities but dense
","Chain smoking John Constantine (Keanu Reeves) is doom to go to Hell. He tries to redeem himself by exorcising demons. However the demons seem to be breaking into our world. Meanwhile, police Det. Angela Dodson (Rachel Weisz)'s twin sister Isabel's supposed suicide leaves her struggling to prove otherwise. She tries to get help from Constantine, but he refuses at first. Then he notices the demons that seems to be following her. And there is also a Spear of Destiny.There is some good possibilities in this franchise. However it's way too complicated, and it needs to be explained earlier. It's probably one of those movies that need some text at the beginning explaining the world. Keanu and Rachel are good for these roles. Although they both do the same reserved intensity acting. It leaves the movie with only one tone. There are some cool visual styles in this movie. However there are just too many strange things that pops up. The one casting mistake is Gavin Rossdale as Balthazar. He doesn't have the screen presence for such an important role. There are some interesting aspects to this movie, but it's Hell to follow."
The Natural,8,0,1,26 April 2014," Iconic baseball scene
","Roy Hobbs (Robert Redford) is a young ballplayer who on a train trip strikes out The Whammer on 3 pitches. When he gets involved with Harriet Bird (Barbara Hershey), she shoots him sidelining his career. Years later in 1939, Roy Hobbs re-enters the major leagues as an old rookie in the New York Knights. He's been hired by the owner The Judge (Robert Prosky). The Judge and the coach Pop Fisher (Wilford Brimley) have a bet. Pop could get back some of his shares of the team if he could win this year. So he assumes Hobbs is nothing more than The Judge sabotaging his year and refuses to let him play. When he finally relents, Hobbs literally knocks the cover off of the ball with his bat Wonderboy. Max Mercy (Robert Duvall) is a newspaper man who keeps hounding Hobbs for his life story. Memo Paris (Kim Basinger) is Pop's niece and bad luck who is in cahoots with bookie Gus Sands. Iris Gaines (Glenn Close) is his salvation from the past.I don't really like his introduction. It would probably make more sense to have a young lookalike to do those scenes. At first blush, the passing of years may not be as appreciated by the audience. It may be a good idea to use the younger version as simple flashbacks. Redford just don't look different enough in those two different time frames. That aside, Barry Levinson does know how to shoot a beautiful movie. The movie does have its slower spots, but it fits the mystical feel of the story. This movie runs like a fantasy.One thing is for sure. There is that iconic home run scene. Sometimes a scene or an image can stand for something bigger. For that alone, I have added one point to my vote."
The Others,8,2,4,29 October 2014," Kidman terrific in great moody atmosphere
","It's 1945 Jersey, the Channel Islands. Grace Stewart (Nicole Kidman) is staying at a mansion with her two kids waiting for her husband. Mrs. Bertha Mills (Fionnula Flanagan), Edmund Tuttle (Eric Sykes) and Lydia (Elaine Cassidy) come for work after the previous servants vanished. The children are photosensitive and can't be in direct sunlight. Grace is religious and over-protective with numerous strange rules. Then Grace hears strange noises and voices which her girl Anne says it's a boy named Victor and his family.This is a terrific moody ghost story. The twist is very nicely done. If there is any problem, it's that this movie is released two years after the best ghost movie with a twist. Nevertheless, Kidman is great and the creepy mood is worthy of the best of the old fashion ghost stories."
Rise of the Guardians,7,2,3,5 September 2013," classic characters not quite a classic
","The Man in the Moon has selected Jack Frost to be the Guardian to do battle with the evil Pitch Black. Jack Frost is joined by the Toothfairy, Sandman, Easter Bunny, and Santa Claus.This is a DreamWorks Animation, and it looks good. Certainly it's not groundbreaking, and the selection of classic characters just adds to its feels of unoriginalness. It feels like a slightly different take on the same old stories. And it doesn't help that the characters seems to have powers coming out of the blue. The rules of the movie are never laid out solidly.There is a sub-story of the need for kids to believe. I think it is the bigger theme that needed to be put up front and center. The kids needed to be the lead especially the last one to believe. As it stands, the movie is a nice story. But I doubt it will be a classic years from now."
Troy,7,0,1,15 February 2014," Brad Pitt's Achilles fascinating
","This is director Wolfgang Petersen's vision of Homer's epic poem of the Greek tragedy after Trojan prince Paris (Orlando Bloom) takes Helen (Diane Kruger) home to Troy. Her husband Menelaus (Brendan Gleeson) provides his brother Agamemnon (Brian Cox) the perfect excuse to invade Troy bringing along his champion Achilles (Brad Pitt).There is a lot to like about this movie. There are big action scenes. Brad Pitt's Achilles is absolutely fascinating. In many ways, the movie is dragged down by all the intrigue and the various other expositions. The movie is hamstrung by Wolfang trying to do a good and proper job explaining this story. It would be much more compelling if it concentrated on one character preferably Brad Pitt's Achilles. Nevertheless it's a grand overstuffed epic more reminiscent of another era."
Dead Poets Society,7,1,3,11 April 2014," Robin Williams proves he's a great actor
","Smart and popular Neil Perry (Robert Sean Leonard) has a domineering father (Kurtwood Smith) who controls his son. Todd Anderson (Ethan Hawke) is his new shy roommate in the high class Welton Academy boarding school. John Keating (Robin Williams) is their new English teacher who teaches his students all about living life to the fullest... Carpe Diem. Neil finds an old senior annual where Keating was a part of the Dead Poets Society. The boys decide to resurrect the Society.The young cast is pretty good led by the quiet Ethan Hawke and a good leading man in RSL. Of course, the teacher in these types of movies is what sells it. Robin Williams controls his wilder instincts to create a very compelling character. It's a little too much poetry for me, but I like the movie otherwise especially the performances."
Just Go with It,5,2,4,5 October 2013," disgusting scheme, unreasonable lie, can't quite recover from bad start
","Danny (Adam Sandler) has come up with a scheme to get rid of every girl he hooks up with by pretending to be married. Only the scheme backfires when his dream girl Palmer (Brooklyn Decker) mistakenly falls for the lie. In order to salvage his relationship, he recruits his assistant Katherine (Jennifer Aniston) to pretend to be his wife, and soon to be his ex.This is a remake of Cactus Flower (1969). Adam Sandler comes off more of a douche than the original. The original was already douchy but that was another era. His womanizing scheme is disgusting which makes Danny a douche. The reason for the scheme is to avoid these single women who are all desperate to get married. Times have changed. The original lie to Palmer is unreasonable and really distracting. The whole thing starts off horribly. Brooklyn Decker is surprisingly good for a model turn actress. Jennifer Aniston and Adam Sandler have some good vicious dialog exchanges together. They could be in a fun standard rom-com together. But the movie never recovers from its bad start."
Brokeback Mountain,7,1,2,26 January 2015," Great acting from the boys and Williams
","It's 1963. Ennis Del Mar (Heath Ledger) hitchhikes and stops at Signal, Wyoming. He and Jack Twist (Jake Gyllenhaal) get hired as sheep herders on the side of Brokeback Mountain. One cold night, they have a homosexual encounter. They insist that they're not queer but they continue anyways. Their boss Joe Aguirre (Randy Quaid) notices their relationship and doesn't hire the guys the next season. Ennis marries Alma (Michelle Williams) and they have a young family together. Jack goes back to the rodeo circuit and has a family with barrel racer Lureen Newsome (Anne Hathaway). Both find married life deficient and reconnects. They just can't quit each other.The story is a bit slow and uncomfortable. The most compelling aspect is that being gay isn't the usual flamboyant over-the-top act. They are hidden and fear of discovery is palpable. There is one great scene from Michelle Williams. She does some superb acting. The boys risk a lot in these scary roles. Ledger's speaking style does get a bit muffled at times. However his acting is great and his fears are written all over his face. The superior acting and the risky subject makes this a worthwhile watch."
Ed Wood,8,2,2,14 May 2015," endearing celebration of Ed Wood
",Ed Wood (Johnny Depp) is an outwardly optimistic terrible stage director. His girlfriend Dolores Fuller (Sarah Jessica Parker) is clueless to his cross-dressing. He is constantly trying to push his way into filmmaking with his band of misfits. He befriends legendary Bela Lugosi (Martin Landau) who hasn't worked in 4 years. Schlock producer George Weiss allows Ed to write and direct sex change movie 'Glen or Glenda' with Lugosi.Tim Burton and Johnny Depp captures the unquenchable thirst to materialize one's dreams. This is some fun and a lot of joy of creation. They never make Wood into a joke. Rather he's celebrated for his unceasing drive. This is a great character study. Landau is just terrific. Their relationship is so touching.
Chicken Run,7,0,1,3 November 2013," Prison Break chicken style
","It's a prison escape picture Aardman style for chickens. It's done by people well versed in all those WWII prison escape movies. Movie lovers will understand all the references, but it works just as well for young kids.Ginger (Julia Sawalha) is constantly trying to escape the chicken egg farm of the Tweedys. She fails every time and yet she keeps trying. One day young Yank rooster Rocky (Mel Gibson) comes flying in. Ginger needs Rocky's help to spring all the chickens from the farm.Sure it's funny. Sure it's a crazy spoof of those prison escape movies. But it's actually quite thrilling. The movie really builds suspense as we hope that they get away. It's a fine addition to the Aardman family."
Orphan,7,2,4,1 April 2014," Good creepy girl
","Kate (Vera Farmiga) and John Coleman (Peter Sarsgaard) are trying to adopt. She's a recovering alcoholic and they're trying to salvage their family after the death of their baby Jessica. They adopt Russian girl Esther (Isabelle Fuhrman) at the St. Marina Orphanage. At first, the son Daniel (Jimmy Bennett) didn't get along while the deaf daughter Max (Aryana Engineer) loves her. Then Esther's manipulations and threats causes concerns from Kate. John dismisses all of it. The psychologist Dr. Browning (Margo Martindale) keeps questioning her. Then Kate finds out troubling information about Esther.This starts very slowly. The psycho family dysfunction is well done although John's denial is very annoying. It is extremely frustrating and I wish the movie dials it down a bit. I do love the twist. It fits the movie very well, and it's done smoothly. Isabelle Fuhrman does the role beautifully, and Vera Farmiga is great as the frazzled mother."
Home Alone,7,0,0,30 November 2013," Back when Macaulay Culkin was the cutest ever
","Kevin McCallister (Macaulay Culkin) is the youngest of a large family. They are preparing to go to Paris for Christmas. The power goes out overnight, and none of the clocks work. The family rushes to get on the plane and leave little Kevin behind. The Wet Bandits, Harry Lyme (Joe Pesci) and Marv Merchants (Daniel Stern), come to town to rob the McCallister home only to battle Kevin and his home made traps.Director Chris Columbus and writer John Hughes team up to create one of the most iconic comedies of its era. It's in no small part due to the iconic scene of Macaulay Culkin slapping his face and Scream. Take it away, it's a rather crass juvenile kiddie movie. I'm not complaining, just explaining. Expect a lot of slapstick stupidity with the annoying Wet Bandits."
About Time,8,3,4,6 September 2014," The best time traveling rom-com
","When Tim Lake (Domhnall Gleeson) turns 21, his father (Bill Nighy) tells him that men in his family can travel through time. His sister Kit Kat (Lydia Wilson) brings Charlotte (Margot Robbie) to stay for the summer. His power is unable to make the beautiful Charlotte fall for him. He moves to London and stays with bitter playwright Harry (Tom Hollander). He has a wonderful night with the magical Mary (Rachel McAdams). However Harry had a horrible opening night for his play. He goes back in time to fix it but his magical night with Mary disappears. He uses his power but also finds some limitations.Richard Curtis creates the one of the best time traveling rom-com. Gleeson is likable and adorkable. McAdams is magically adorable. She is dating down a bit but the two has good chemistry nevertheless. The time traveling could have gone horribly wrong. The first steps help alleviate a good deal of it. My biggest fear for this movie is that Tim would use his powers to keep changing history to force Mary to fall for him. The fact that he couldn't get Charlotte helps and that Mary falls for him without his powers is also very important. It culminates in one of the more profound ways to use time travel."
The Hustler,8,1,1,19 February 2015," Impressive Newman
",Pool player Eddie Felson (Paul Newman) drives to small towns with his partner Charlie to hustle unsuspecting locals. Cocky Charlie challenges pool legend Minnesota Fats (Jackie Gleason). He's ahead but ignores Charlie's plead to quit and loses big. He leaves Charlie behind and meets Sarah Packard (Piper Laurie). He's looking to take on Fats again but Charlies won't and they break up. Life on the road is tough and he gets his hands broken. He joins up with hard gambler Bert Gordon (George C. Scott) who takes 75% as his manager. Newman is impressive as the lead. Most of the actors are terrific. There is great stuff in the movie. Laurie is fair. There are some slower spots in the middle but they are minor moments. Newman's battles with Gleason are filled with tension. This is a terrific movie.
Spotlight,9,2,3,30 August 2016," masterpiece
","In July 2001, Marty Baron (Liev Schreiber) is the new editor of the Boston Globe. He wants Walter 'Robby' Robinson (Michael Keaton) to investigate lawyer Mitchell Garabedian (Stanley Tucci) who represents victims of Catholic priests. Robby leads Michael Rezendes (Mark Ruffalo), Sacha Pfeiffer (Rachel McAdams), and Matt Carroll (Brian d'Arcy James) in the Globe's investigative journalism group called Spotlight.This is tightly produced procedural of a newspaper investigation like 'All the President's Men'. I have no problem with anybody putting this in the same league as that iconic classic. It is that good. It is that relevant. The acting is superior. There is not a lot of flash. It is a lot of shoe-leather work and this movie presents it with great tension and integrity. This is a masterpiece."
Terminator Salvation,6,2,2,29 September 2013," SkyNet war movie more complicated than it needs to be
","In 2003 Marcus Wright (Sam Worthington) is on death row, and donates his body to research. Years later after Skynet has taken over, John Connor (Christian Bale) is just one of the fighters against the machines. When he attacks a Skynet facility, he finds that Skynet is developing the powerful new model T-800. He seems to be the sole survivor, but unbeknownst to him, a naked Marcus emerges.This is the war movie that everybody expected after the first Terminator movie came out. We all thought about the apocalyptic world of battling Skynet. The movies have always been pre-Judgement day. This is the first movie post-Judgement day.The CG has finally caught up to the vision. The action is dark, and big as it should be. The story is too complicated for it's own good. The Marcus character is too complicated when a simple underdog character is all that's required. And the complications just add to the messy ending."
Insomnia,8,3,6,15 August 2015," great actors in compelling remake
","LAPD homicide detectives Will Dormer (Al Pacino) and Hap Eckhart (Martin Donovan) are brought to the small town of Nightmute, Alaska to help with the investigation of the murder of 17 year old Kay Connell. The partners are facing an investigation by IA back home. Local cop Ellie Burr (Hilary Swank) is a big fan of Dormer. The police sets a trap. Dormer accidentally kills Eckhart in the fog and he works to hide his mistake. Dormer has insomnia from the perpetual daylight and his guilt. Kay was a fan of crime writer Walter Finch (Robin Williams).Director Christopher Nolan kept the moodiness of the Norwegian original and added some compelling tension. Al Pacino and Robin Williams are terrific. It holds up to the original without tearing it down."
Aquaman,7,2,3,8 March 2019," CGI extravaganza
","In 1985, lighthouse keeper Tom Curry rescues a woman from the stormy sea. She's Atlanna (Nicole Kidman), The Queen of Atlantis. They have a son together named Arthur. In order to keep him safe, she leaves them for Atlantis where she is forced to marry another. Her advisor Vulko (Willem Dafoe) is tasked to train Arthur. In the present, Arthur is Aquaman (Jason Momoa), a Justice League hero. In rescuing a Russian sub, he leaves a pirate to his death giving his son David Kane reason to seek revenge as Black Manta. Mera (Amber Heard) informs Arthur about an impending invasion by Atlantian forces led by Orm (Patrick Wilson). Orm is Arthur's younger half-brother. Atlanna has been executed to the creatures of the Trench. As the eldest son of Atlanna, Arthur has more claim to the throne.Director James Wan delivers a CGI extravaganza. The level of difficulty is high and he mostly clears it. I would have liked more space for some of the scenes to breathe. The movie is like a freight train without brakes. I need more moments in first gear to admire the sceneries and enjoy the humor. The pee joke is funny. The movie needs some calmer scenes to build good chemistry and do character work. I love the crazy war-crabs but it's sensory overload. The first speed bump occurs when Aquaman challenges Orm to a fight in the Thunderdome. It would have been more reasonable for Mera to bring Arthur to her father only to be ambushed by a double-crossing Orm. It would serve the same purpose without doing a big coliseum gladiator fight. It would also make Orm more underhanded evil. As for the creatures from The Trench, I would have preferred diplomacy instead of another fight. I expected a smarter twist where the monsters turn out to be intelligent. This is a good rebound from the lows of the DCEU although I hope the franchise can do more character work and less CGI fights. There is too much of a good thing."

Mei is falling asleep when Totoro shows up. Satsuki gives him an umbrella and he's overjoyed. He gives the girls a gift of acorns as he boards the cat-bus.It's a gentle story with cute characters and an adorable spirit from legendary animator Hayao Miyazaki. The drama isn't that heightened but it's a great coming-of-age story nonetheless. Totoro discovering the fun of raindrops on the umbrella is pure joy. There is simply an endearing gentleness that extend even to the closing credits animation.
500 Days of Summer,8,1,1,17 August 2014," Fun, offbeat non-rom-com
","Tom Hansen (Joseph Gordon-Levitt) is always looking for the one. Summer Finn (Zooey Deschanel) doesn't believe in love since her parents' divorce. The narration explains that 'This is not a love story'. The movie moves in a non-linear timeline. His sister Rachel (Chloë Grace Moretz), McKenzie (Geoffrey Arend), and Paul (Matthew Gray Gubler) are his friends. Summer is the new assistant to his boss Vance (Clark Gregg) in his greeting card workplace and he falls head over heals.Zooey is the 'It' girl and JGL is playing the adorable leading man. Zooey is a great fantasy girlfriend. They make a fine rom-com couple or in this case, the anti-rom-com couple. The non-linear structure and the serious narration give it a fantasy feel. It's offbeat in tone and in structure. It's not dripping in realism but it is loads of fun. Music video director Marc Webb brings a different sensibility to this traditional genre."
Juno,8,0,1,13 September 2014," movie with an unique voice
",Juno MacGuff (Ellen Page) is a 16 year old high school kid in Minnesota. She gets pregnant after one time with her friend Paulie Bleeker (Michael Cera). She tells her best friend Leah (Olivia Thirlby). She lives with her father Mac (J.K. Simmons) and her stepmom Bren (Allison Janney). She decides to give away the baby after going to the women's clinic. She finds a couple Vanessa (Jennifer Garner) and Mark Loring (Jason Bateman) in the PennySaver. Mark is a bit of a kindred spirit but Vanessa is very uptight.The dialog from Diablo Cody is snappy and quirky. Director Jason Reitman brings that style to the screen. The lines are wacky and sometimes they strike a funny note. There is a rhythm to all the rapid fire dialog and the story sometimes gets to an insightful comment like 'I don't know what kind of girl I am.' It's also great that nobody has their stuff together and they are not easy stereotypes. The stepmother isn't evil and the couple don't work out the way one expects. It's a fun coming-of-age movie.
L.A. Confidential,9,1,3,7 March 2015," great modern noir
","It's 1950's Los Angeles. Sid Hudgens (Danny DeVito) is a mud raking journalist. He often works with fame-whore narcotics detective Jack Vincennes (Kevin Spacey) who also works as a technical adviser on popular TV show Badge of Honor. Sergeant Ed Exley (Guy Pearce) is ambitious trying to live up to his murdered father's reputation. He testified against Bud White (Russell Crowe)'s partner. Captain Dudley Smith (James Cromwell) doesn't believe he's tough or corrupt enough to be a real detective. Bud is rough cop out for street justice. The three detectives become involved in the investigation of the Nite Owl killings and call girl Lynn Bracken (Kim Basinger).This is one of the best modern film noir. It is brilliant with style. The acting is impeccable and Kim Basinger is a great modern Veronica Lake. Russell Crowe kills it. Everybody is doing great work. Some people may be put off by the many characters and multiple story lines. To me, the chaotic story only adds to the style of the movie."
The Jungle Book,7,2,3,5 November 2014," fun collection of characters
","Bagheera the black panther finds a baby boy in a basket. He brings him to be raised by mother wolf. Years later, the tiger Shere Kahn returns to their part of the jungle and threatens to kill the man-cub. The pack decides to send the man-cub back to a man-village with the help of Bagheera. The boy isn't happy to leave the jungle. On the way, he encounters elephants led by Colonel Hathi, orangutans, Kaa the python and the irresponsible fun-loving bear Baloo.It's a fun collection of memorable animal characters. The plot is a little random but I don't think that matters too much in this movie. Compared to its other Disney cohorts, this ranks slightly lower than the classics. The story just isn't that compelling. On the other hand, 'The Bare Necessities' is a great song and there is a childlike joy that permeates much of the movie."
Concussion,6,3,8,31 July 2016," important but not that dramatic
","It's 2002. Dr. Bennet Omalu (Will Smith) is the junior forensic pathologist in Pittsburgh. During the weekend, beloved Pittsburgh Steelers center Mike Webster is found dead. Omalu is the low man and on call. Using his own money, he examines Webster's brain and discovers unexpected damage. With his boss Dr. Cyril Wecht (Albert Brooks) and others, he publishes a medical paper calling the disease Chronic Traumatic Encephalopathy (CTE). Webster's former team doctor Julian Bailes (Alec Baldwin) also gives his support as the group faces off against the might of the NFL.It's an important story. It's an interesting story. Will Smith does the job well. It's simply lacks drama and the tension is not that high. It's a compelling watch for the most part. There are scenes suggesting the NFL coming after the doctors but they don't always say it directly. The punches are pulled a little and considering it's the NFL, I don't blame them. The retelling by Dr. Omalu of essentially the same story is slightly more intense. The movie adds very little drama to the true story."
The Day After Tomorrow,6,1,2,1 November 2013," Don't take it seriously
","Jack Hall (Dennis Quaid) is a scientist studying climate change. The world climate is about to change due to man-made effects. Most of North America is about to go into a deep rapid freeze. It will trap Jack's son Sam (Jake Gyllenhaal) in New York along with countless others (Emmy Rossum). Jack mounts a desperate rescue facing impossible cold.The science make no sense. It's just an excuse to CG NY and have some weather related fun. Luckily the visuals are spectacular. When the waves hit NY, you can't get more popcorn fun than that. After the big freeze, it plays like many other disaster movies. Except you can't take the disaster seriously."
Pirates of the Caribbean: At World's End,6,0,1,15 February 2015," Pure chaos
","It's the third movie in the series. Lord Cutler Beckett is killing everybody using Davy Jones and The Flying Dutchman. James Norrington (Jack Davenport) had given him Davy Jones' heart and is promoted to Admiral. Will (Orlando Bloom) is captured by Captain Sao Feng (Yun-Fat Chow) for trying to steal the chart to Davy Jone's Locker. Elizabeth (Keira Knightley) and Captain Barbossa (Geoffrey Rush) come to get him back as well as Jack Sparrow (Johnny Depp) from the locker. Sparrow has one of the nine pieces of eight. In Shipwreck Cove, the nine captains vote to declare war.This movie really needs an opening 'previously' segment. It dives right in without explaining which makes it tough to get going. It's pure chaos while trying to remember what came before. Davy Jones' Locker is a weird fascinating world. I really like the surrealism. It's funny and a break from the Pirates world. The idea of a landlocked ship and the stone crabs are imaginative. The problem is that the movie keeps piling on revelations. I don't really understand all the Calypso stuff. The movie is just overstuffed with plot, CGI and characters of all kinds."
Don Jon,7,3,4,5 May 2014," Good first big filmmaking effort from JGL
","Joseph Gordon-Levitt is bringing his best Jersey Shore impersonation. He's writing, directing, and staring in his first big filmmaking effort. Jon (Joseph Gordon-Levitt) loves only a few things. He cares about his workouts, his cleaning, his car, his family, his church, his boys, chicks, and his porn. Then he meets Barbara (Scarlett Johansson) at the club. On a scale from 1 to 10, she's a dime. She loves rom-coms, and she wants to completely change him. She hates him watching porn and gets him to go to night school. At school, nosy Esther (Julianne Moore) keeps bothering him.There is a lot to commend on JGL's first big effort. He allows his actors to do their thing. Scarlett Johansson does a good Jersey princess. Tony Danza is amazing as the big macho father. JGL really never lets his mask slip. Julianne Moore brings the deepest character in the whole movie. The movie has its dark moments. Its subject matter is edgy. The funny moments are slightly humorous. It's a dark comedy but just not that funny. If there is an emotional truth, it hits it with a hammer. The movie really gets interesting with the Esther character. JGL did some good work here. The style looks sharp. The script probably needs a few more well written jokes. I look forward to his next directing project."
Deadpool 2,8,2,7,30 July 2018," Deadpooling Again
","Deadpool (Ryan Reynolds) returns from his global killing tour ready to start a family with Vanessa (Morena Baccarin). Gunmen break-in and kill her. Deadpool is devastated and Colossus tries to comfort him. Negasonic Teenage Warhead has new girlfriend Yukio. As a new X-Men trainee, Deadpool tries to pacify rampaging Russel (Julian Dennison) but it goes badly. Deadpool and Russel are both sent to mutant prison. Time traveling soldier Cable (Josh Brolin) attacks the prison looking to kill Russel. Deadpool is blown out of the prison. He recruits other mutants like Domino (Zazie Beetz) to join his X-Force to battle Cable and rescue Russel.Starting the movie by killing Vanessa puts a damper on the proceedings. I understand Deadpool's idea of providing motivation for this movie. It's just a downer in this otherwise hilarious fun. Of course, one does quickly realize that Cable has his time traveling powers to change any of these events. Colossus and Negasonic are as good as before. Cabbie Dopinder continues his hilarity. The addition of Cable, Domino, and Firefist are all terrific. I was worried about all the other X-Force characters but they are taken care of quickly in one of the funniest bits around. This is Deadpool. It's exactly that and it's building a good team around him."
X-Men,8,0,1,9 November 2013," Bryan Singer starts a great franchise
","Based on the Marvel comics, this is a great introduction to these characters. And that's the biggest job in this movie for director Bryan Singer. He needed the right actors to play these characters properly in a viable story. The fact that he did it well meant that a new movie franchise is launched.Of all the actors, the most important ones are Hugh Jackman and Patrick Stewart. Jackman is a find. Before this, he's done mostly Australian TV. That's really lucky. He's not a meathead weight lifter. He's the real deal. Patrick Stewart is the more easier choice. Not only is he Captain Picard, but he's a great British actor with a vast repertoire.The story itself is a great persecution and outsider story. The characters are already well established and well tested. As long as they had good actors, the good chemistry is almost automatic."
Spider-Man 3,6,1,2,22 February 2014," Too many villains Too many story lines
","Peter Parker (Tobey Maguire) is finally getting good press for Spider-man. However Mary Jane Watson (Kirsten Dunst)'s life is spiraling after a bad review gets her fired from her Broadway show. A new lady Gwen Stacy (Bryce Dallas Howard) comes into Peter's life. She's his fellow student and gets rescued by Spider-man. Harry Osborn (James Franco) still wants revenge as The New Goblin. Love complications abound for Peter when MJ gets jealous and Harry loses his memory then regains it back, only to blackmail MJ.There is more. Flint Marko (Thomas Haden Church) is an escaped convict. When he gets caught in a experimental machine, he's transformed into the Sandman. Later Peter finds out that Flint is Uncle Ben's true killer. Also a black substance from a fallen meteor attach to Spider-man forming a symbiotic relationship. Spider-man becomes dark in more ways than just the color. Eddie Brock (Topher Grace) is Gwen's boyfriend and a competitor for Peter's job as photographer. He's a little weasel. When Peter rips off the symbiont, it attach itself to Eddie Brock and he becomes Venom.There are just too many villains, and too much story. Director Sam Raimi struggles to squeeze everything in. It's hard to lay all the blame on Raimi, but he has to take on his share. It still has its entertaining moments. There is good action, and the new villains look great visually. Let's face it. When the villain gets amnesia then switches back and that's a side story, this thing is overstuffed. Also the tone of the movie is problematic. Bruce Campbell and J.K. Simmons are making childish campy fun. Tobey Maguire looks silly desperate to be believable as dark. That part is cringe-worthy. Topher Grace also overdoes his weasel character. Too many times, the movie goes into silly territories. The best thing in the movie is the theme of forgiveness. Peter Parker, Harry Osborn, and even MJ have to find their better angels as they escape their individual darkness. At least, all the stories have that connective tissue."
Thor: Ragnarok,8,2,5,8 April 2018," flawless fun
","Thor (Chris Hemsworth) returns home to find Loki (Tom Hiddleston) ruling Asgard disguised as their father Odin (Anthony Hopkins). Before dying, Odin reveals a previously unknown elder daughter Hela (Cate Blanchett) and warns against an impending Asgardian doomsday prophesy called Ragnarok. With Odin's death, Hela is released and Loki's carelessness allows her to return to Asgard. She destroys Thor's hammer and relegates the brothers to the planet Sakaar. Scrapper 142 (Tessa Thompson) takes Thor prisoner and sells him to the Grandmaster (Jeff Goldblum) for his gladiatorial contests. Thor is surprised to find the Hulk (Mark Ruffalo) as the champion.This is fun. In fact, it's flawless fun. It's light, funny, action-packed, and fun-fun-fun. The Asgardian brothers continue to have good chemistry but the best bromance has to be Hulk and Thor. That is Hulk in both Hulk form and Banner form. These two are the new buddy comedy duo of Marvel. They are hilarious together and has the best section of the movie. I only wish for more Hulk Thor pairing. Tessa Thompson is a great addition. Jeff Goldblum does his Jeff Goldblumiest. Hela is the only one who may need more dimensions. She's a bit of a cardboard cut out villain and Blanchett does her best with what she's allowed to do. She needs a scene by herself to add some dimension and lay down some Shakespear on her father's spirit. That's often the case for Marvel villains. Director Taika Waititi really let his unique skills loose on this franchise."
Match Point,6,0,2,28 September 2013," Could be more intense
","Chris Wilton (Jonathan Rhys Meyers) is a tennis pro who befriends wealthy Tom Hewett (Matthew Goode). Tom's sister Chloe (Emily Mortimer) falls for Chris but Chris has only eyes for Tom's fiancée Nola Rice (Scarlett Johansson). Nevertheless, Chris marries Chloe for her family money.I found the story moved slowly. I feel like the movie can start much later. Starting the story from when Chris meets Tom seems unnecessary. Squeezing the timeline would help increase the tension. Although a tense thriller isn't necessarily a Woody Allen trademark.Jonathan Rhys Meyers gives an interesting performance. He's suave enough to catch Chloe but creepy enough when he's with Nola. Scarlett's performance is basically looking hot and do a bit of yelling. I don't think she stretched very much. We all know she's hot. Everybody else plays it straight."
Children of Heaven,9,1,2,16 July 2018," universal life
","In a poor Tehran neighborhood, Ali picks up a pair of shoes for his sister Zahra. He loses them while in a store buying potatoes. His father is a simple laborer and his mother is bedridden. He is desperate to hide the mistake from his father and decides to share his sneakers with his sister. The shoes may be small but the stakes do not get much higher. That is the universal truth and that is the greatness of this movie. The family has so little that those shoes mean everything. The kids are terrific. One can really feel their fear and embarrassment. These are big time performances and they have great humanity. The tension in that race does not get much higher. It is all about the stakes and that small prize has such big stakes. There is a parallel with the Bicycle Thieves and I dare say that this approaches that cinematic icon. This was nominated for the Best Foreign Language Oscar but lost to Life Is Beautiful."
Yes Man,6,0,2,1 March 2014," Unfunny Jim Carrey and charming Zooey Deschanel
","Carl Allen (Jim Carrey) is stuck in the same place after being dumped by his ex-wife years ago. His best friend Pete (Bradley Cooper) is getting married and is tired of his detached nature. That is until he enrolls in a self help program where they say yes to everything. Carl tries to say yes and things start to happen. He gets an unexpected promotion and a new girlfriend (Zooey Deschanel).It's a tiresome start with a tiresome character. The movie bumps along until Zooey gets in. She's the MPDG, and she saves this movie... sort of. The self help group headed by Terence Stamp feels like an annoying cult. It's a terribly unfunny start. Zooey is a very charming girl, but there's a limit to what she could do. And she is limited in her time on the screen. On the other hand, Jim Carrey doesn't have the same presence anymore. They don't have great chemistry together."
Resident Evil: Extinction,6,0,3,17 November 2013," Could have been so much better
","The world is ravaged by the T-virus destroying nature itself. The world is drying up and the world is a desolate wasteland. Alice (Milla Jovovich) is roaming the world on her own keeping on the move. She battles zombies, bandits, and even crows. On the way, she joins a group of survivors (Ali Larter, Spencer Locke) reuniting with Carlos Olivera (Oded Fehr). Meanwhile underground, Dr. Isaacs (Iain Glen) of Umbrella is doing research on clones of Alice.This is the third installment of the Resident Evil franchise. It is a vast improvement over the 2nd movie. The desolate look is superior. I love the post apocalyptic vibe. I wish they concentrated on only Alice on the road instead trying to keep track of the Umbrella storyline. There could be a great zombie road movie only if they allowed it to happen. Instead they keep interrupting it with Umbrella, and ruins any possibility of a fun zombie road trip."
Midnight in Paris,7,0,1,15 April 2014," Literary Fantasy not my taste but I won't hold it against the movie
","Gil (Owen Wilson) is on a trip to Paris with his fiancÃ©e Inez (Rachel McAdams) and her rich conservative family. One night, Gil takes a walk by himself as Inez goes dancing with her friends. A car stops and picks up Gil who is a little tipsy. He ends up in a party in the 1920s with some literary luminaries of the times. He's an amateur writer and is in awe of the company. He can't seem to take Inez there, but he goes back every night to see his new found friends especially Adriana (Marion Cotillard).This must be what a fantasy looks like to the literary set. There is a lack of tension. This is more lyrical and more whimsical. The real world holds no interest for me, and I couldn't care less if Gil walks away from it all. My solution would be to fuse the characters Gabrielle (LÃ©a Seydoux) and Adriana together. The fantasy world isn't real enough for me. Gil is constantly in awe. It feels like a costume party with all the literary name dropping. It's not really my field of expertise and I may be missing a lot. It is however very well done with Owen Wilson's great wide-eyed character."
A Bridge Too Far,8,6,8,13 November 2013," One of the Grand war movies.
","It's September 1944 and Montgomery has a high risk all-or-nothing plan to take several bridges on the way to capture the industrial heart of Germany. It is called Operation Market Garden. It was the biggest airborne assault in history. Director Richard Attenborough try to make a grand scale war movie. The stellar cast is not to be missed. The scale of this film is massive. It is before the time of the computer. It does take a little while to set up. There's a lot of things to show before the action starts. But once the action starts, the film moves along quite well.Vandeleur (Michael Caine) leads the advance on the narrow road to reach the bridges. Frost (Anthony Hopkins) leads his men and reaches the bridge in Arnhem. Urquhart (Sean Connery)'s men land near an asylum and can't get to the bridge. Sosabowski (Gene Hackman)'s men are held back by the weather.This is one of the best grand war movies. It comes out the wonderful traditions of The Longest Day and Tora! Tora! Tora! Nobody is trying to add a romance to spice things up. It is a researched piece of cinema. Sure there are controversies about some of the portrayals. But the attempt is appreciated."
The Last Song,5,0,5,3 May 2014," OK teen soap start but ends in a bored yawn
","Ronnie (Miley Cyrus) and her little brother Jonah are staying with their father Steve Miller (Greg Kinnear) in his beach house for the summer. The rebellious teen is not happy and feels out of place. She got in trouble for shoplifting in NYC. She makes a frienenemy in Blaze (Carly Chaikin), and catches the eye of local Will Blakelee (Liam Hemsworth). When she tries to save some turtles, she and Will starts a summer romance. He's trying to move on from a loss and she reconnects with music. The local girls aren't too happy. Meanwhile everybody still blames her father for burning down the church.It's not a particularly original teen rom-com to start. It's a little too light and too sappy. Then as in all Nicholas Sparks novels, this must have some melodrama. Somebody must die or be already dead! Miley Cyrus is a perfectly fine grumpy teen. Liam Hemsworth is the hot young beach dude. The two leads are nice likable kids. Nobody is winning any acting awards here, but it's a fine little teen melodramatic soap start. However the turn does nothing particularly compelling except to let the little air out of the story. The only hope is to have Liam and Miley on screen together no matter what. It doesn't matter if they're fighting or making up. When Liam goes away, the movie's spirit goes away too."
Youth,7,0,1,4 July 2018," fine art house
","Retired concert conductor Fred Ballinger (Michael Caine) is vacationing at a peaceful Swiss spa with long-time friend Mick Boyle (Harvey Keitel). He is asked to perform for the Queen but he refuses for a personal reason. Mick is a filmmaker working on his next script with his troop of young contributors. Fred's daughter and assistant Lena (Rachel Weisz) is married to Mick's son but he has left her for a pop star for the sex. The other hotel clients include actor Jimmy Tree (Paul Dano), an obese Diego Maradona, a bitter silent elderly couple, and a young girl.The surrealism sometimes work but not all the time. I like the Nazi outfit, the soap bubble girl, but the dream of Mick's female characters don't register. The grassy hill swallows them up. They are better off lined up in a row in emptiness. As for the main roles, I'd like for Fred and Mick to spend more time together. I love the time that Fred spends with Lena. Dano is hit and miss. His best is with the little girl. I would have love to be told that it was Maradona right from the start. I'm not a soccer fan and I wouldn't know him even if he's not obese. This is definitely a movie with its own style. Director Paolo Sorrentino has an unique sense of rhythm and isn't for everybody. This is for the stylish art house fans."
Zodiac,8,0,0,18 January 2016," immersive and detailed
","On July 4, 1969, a killer shoots a couple on lovers' lane in Vallejo, California. The boy survives. The San Francisco Chronicle receives a letter from the Zodiac killer to print his letters with symbols. Reporter Paul Avery (Robert Downey, Jr) is on the case with the help of eager cartoonist Robert Graysmith (Jake Gyllenhaal). The brutal murders continue moving to San Francisco. San Francisco police detectives Dave Toschi (Mark Ruffalo) and William Armstrong (Anthony Edwards) are given the case. Other police include Jack Mulanax (Elias Koteas) in Vallejo and Detective Ken Narlow (Donal Logue) in Napa. Defense lawyer Melvin Belli (Brian Cox) appearing on TV gets a call from the supposed killer.This starts off as an interesting serial killer mystery. The attacks are horrifically shown. The couple forced to be tied up and stabbed is probably the most memorable. However the movie turns into something deeper. This is not another serial killer movie like the endless TV shows that populate modern networks. It may not even be about the central characters. This is an immersive experience living with the serial killer always on the mind. The Zodiac killer is just out there in this world. It's fascinating in its dark undertones and the lack of flashiness."
Milk,8,0,2,22 November 2016," solid biopic with superb Sean Penn performance
","In 60's San Francisco, the police are cracking down on gay men. In 1970 NYC, Harvey Milk (Sean Penn) hooks up with Scott Smith (James Franco) but he's still on the down-lo. In 1972, they decide to go to San Francisco to start anew. They find an economically-depressed Haight. Harvey opens a camera shop and becomes an organizer on Castro Street. He gathers gay support and businesses supporting gays. He meets young Phoenix teen Cleve Jones (Emile Hirsch) who dismisses Harvey at first. He runs for office but fails. Anita Bryant is on a country-wide crusade against homosexuals. In 1977, there is redistricting and Harvey runs for one of the supervisors with Anne Kronenberg (Alison Pill) as his campaign manager. He starts going out with Jack Lira (Diego Luna). He finally wins as one of the first openly gay politician. In 1978, he is put in office along with opponent Dan White (Josh Brolin) from the conservative Irish Catholic district and supportive Mayor Moscone (Victor Garber). It's a tumultuous year that ends in tragedy.Director Gus Van Sant keeps this biopic along the straight and narrow following a standard biopic formula. Certainly, Harvey Milk's life has a lot of sign posts to observe. Through it all, Sean Penn gives the character a caring humanity. The large cast is populated by great actors. I would have liked more from some of these supporting characters but the story has to keep moving. Overall, this is a solid biopic."
The Prestige,9,2,4,14 December 2013," Obsession and Revenge
","Around the turn of the century, Robert Angier (Hugh Jackman), his wife Julia McCullough (Piper Perabo), and Alfred Borden (Christian Bale) are assistants to the magician Cutter (Michael Caine). Due to hubris, Julia is killed in one of the tricks. It sets off a combative obsessive competition between Angier and Borden that ends in their eventual destruction. Rebecca Hall and Scarlett Johansson play other love interests.This is a dense complicated plot. If you figured it out before the ending, then you're much smarter than me. Christopher Nolan and his brother have woven an intrigue story of obsession and revenge. The twists will leave you stunned. The reveals of the tricks are jaw dropping. It doesn't get more mind bending than this one.In a way, the flashforwards are not that necessary. It throws a complicated story into more confusion. It's too much. The movie may be better to be more straight forward. Personally, I like the challenge."
The Terminator,10,2,3,29 September 2013," Intense powerful iconic
","In the future, the world has been taken over by SkyNet, a computer AI that achieves sentient and launches a global nuclear holocaust, in a bid to wipe out humanity. One man John Conner leads the human resistance. They are on the verge of destroying SkyNet when it sends a Terminator (Arnold Schwarzenegger) back in time to the present day to kill John Conner's mother. Connor sends soldier Kyle Reese (Michael Biehn) to save his mother Sarah Connor (Linda Hamilton) from the killer machine.This is director James Cameron's first at bat, and he hits it out of the park. It is near perfection that started a franchise. First the story is perfectly constructed. All those hours of writing and rewriting during his deliveries really helped. Second the choice of Schwarzenegger is inspired. He is the perfect terminator. Third the intensity doesn't relent. It is a sci-fi horror that doesn't let go. It has the production of a much bigger action movie. It is a signpost for a genre, for a cultural touchstone, and for an era. It transcends being simply a movie."
Hellboy II: The Golden Army,7,0,2,27 October 2013," Better than the first
","Guillermo del Toro dropped the character John Myers from this one. It's a good thing since he was nothing more than a wet blanket. He added a new character Johann Krauss. He has an interesting look. The rest of the gang is back and they have added some more personal stories. They have to search for a crown that would control an army of indestructible machines before an evil prince can use it to destroy mankind.The characters are more filled out. They are much better this time around. Their chemistry is much more settled. The del Toro style is still in effect. In fact it looks even better and more beautiful. I like this one much more than the original. And I LOVE the jumping bean elemental. It is one of the most wonderous CG creature ever. It's both beautiful and deadly. What more could you ask for? The 2 hour running time does drag on, and the evil prince isn't big enough. There is too much of an incestial vibe about the evil prince. He was more creepy than scary. It's a relatively minor problem."
Cloverfield,8,2,4,17 January 2016," traditional creature feature in found footage style
",The military recovers a camera from Central Park in NYC after a mysterious incident. The movie consists of the footage found on the camera. Rob Hawkins (Michael Stahl-David) and girlfriend Beth McIntyre (Odette Annable) are going to Coney Island. Then the tape is recorded over at a later date. Jason Hawkins (Mike Vogel) and his girlfriend Lily Ford (Jessica Lucas) are throwing a surprise farewell party for his brother Rob who is moving to Japan for work. Idiot friend Hud Platt (T.J. Miller) is given the job of recording. He starts flirting with disinterested friend of a friend Marlena Diamond (Lizzy Caplan). Then things start happening and the group goes out into the streets.The story is a traditional creature feature. The young cast is photogenic and charismatic. The found footage is good as far as the new style goes. The main problem I have is the camera always finding just the right frame. It gets a little too obvious over time. I like all the big effects but the scariest stuff happens in the dark tunnel. This is bigger than most found footage movies and done well.
Sleepy Hollow,7,1,1,5 May 2015," great Tim Burton look
","It's 1799. NYC police constable Ichabod Crane (Johnny Depp) is bucking the system using modern forensic methods and being berated for it. The Judge sends him off to investigate the beheading murders in the small town of Sleepy Hollow. Wealthy Peter Van Garrett, his son Dirk and the widow Emily Winship are all found without their heads. He is boarding with Baltus Van Tassel and falls for his daughter Katrina (Christina Ricci). The elders recount the tale of a Hessian (Christopher Walken) who was beheaded during the Revolutionary war and has reborn into the headless horseman.Tim Burton brings a brilliant dark moody foggy atmosphere. I love all the designs and the look. Johnny Depp is also terrific as a science geek. I like that he's a weakling and not necessarily the heroic type. Although he has determination. Depp adds a good deal of fun. The horror element isn't very scary but it is fun. It's definitely a movie more intrigued with the style than being a thrilling horror."
Silent Hill,5,0,0,10 March 2014," Interesting art directions
","Rose (Radha Mitchell) and Christopher Da Silva (Sean Bean) struggle with their sleep walking adopted daughter Sharon (Jodelle Ferland). In her dreams, Sharon keeps mentioning the town of Silent Hill. So Rose decides to take Sharon to the mysterious town. Christopher discovers Rose's plan and tries to follow her. Motorcycle cop Bennett (Laurie Holden) pulls her over but Rose speeds away. Rose wakes up in Silent Hill with Sharon missing. It's raining ashes, and then a blaring air siren sounds.Based on a video game, the plot is thin and not very compelling. It's a ghost story excuse to have creepy things. Radha Mitchell screams a lot. Laurie Holden is a hot motorcycle cop. The art direction is very interesting and unique. The movie isn't scary at all. Other than the odd looking creations, there isn't much to recommend about this movie."

","It's 1994 Kigali. Paul Rusesabagina (Don Cheadle) is a hotel manager who knows the right people and gets things done. He's Hutu but is apolitical. He sees signs of upheaval. His wife Tatiana (Sophie Okonedo) is Tutsi but he expects his connections to pull his family through. Canadian Colonel Oliver (Nick Nolte) from the UN is at the hotel touting the new peace agreement. Reporter David (David O'Hara) and cameraman Jack Daglish (Joaquin Phoenix) arrive to cover the story. When the massacres start, his home and then his hotel are inundated with refugees.This is a sincere telling of a harrowing historical story. Don Cheadle delivers a sincere performance. It's all very sincere. There is an inevitability to the story. It is a bit heavy-handed but the history demands some heavy-handedness. However, the lines coming out of Colonel Oliver is too much. There are a couple of instances of overly sincere lines when the simple images are more than enough. I'm almost glad that the white people left the hotel. The movie points the camera at one horrifying scene after another."
Once,8,2,2,27 August 2015," charming beyond belief
","Glen Hansard plays an unnamed street performer in Dublin. Markéta Irglová plays an unnamed Czech immigrant flower girl who takes an interest in him on a lonely night. He's getting over a girl. She's fascinated with him and soon they're making beautiful music together.There is something magical about discovering two unknowns (Hansard is known in his country) in a sweet under-written romance. It never pushes hard. Markéta is utterly sweet. The romance is hesitant. The music is beautiful. In a world of big bombastic high budget Broadway style musicals, this indie musical has more heart than most of them could hope for."
Ready Player One,6,3,6,6 May 2018," great action adventure after school special
","It's 2045. Wade Watts (Tye Sheridan) is a 17 year old orphan living with his aunt in the trailer park stacks in Columbus, Ohio. The world is obsessed with the virtual reality world of OASIS and Wade spends most of his time there as his avatar Parzival. The late founder of OASIS, James Halliday (Mark Rylance), left his company shares worth half a trillion dollars to the winner of a contest he designed. The first to find an egg after retrieving three keys is set to control OASIS with his shares. After years of lack of success, Wade and his OASIS friend Aech are some of the remaining Gunters obsessed with solving the impossible game. They are opposed by corporate head of IOI and Halliday's former intern, Sorrento (Ben Mendelsohn), with his army of worker gamers called Sixers. As they continuously play the first challenge, Wade is joined by intriguing avatar Art3mis (Olivia Cooke).I'm not reading the book and I don't think it matters. There are some nagging issues with the underlying concepts. It's in need of a few tweaks. There are some greatness from master director Steven Spielberg but it is a flawed movie. There is no denying that it is a visually sensational action adventure. Spielberg's skills are superior although this movie is a bit of a modern references scattershot. Like Goro turning into Alien, it's a lot of recognizing familiar iconic images without it meaning anything. The only truly compelling reference is The Shining. The characters are allowed to spend time in the place and it ends with a compelling lesson. That's the only well written story arc. All the rest have some sort of flaws.The first test relies on a random quote from a lifetime with little overall meaning. It would be more likely to come across the solution by accident. After years of failure, somebody should be driving off the track. Just by a process of elimination, a Sixer would have driven in reverse once. As for Sorrento, he is both omnipotent and ruthless. He's willing to kill. He has massive computer power to track down anybody. After capturing Samantha, the obvious move for him is to torture her for information on Wade and all his friends. After killing one, killing more is no hurdle. It's like Sorrento's character arc went back a step. He needs to kill off the five and tension could be build by killing them one at a time. I was perplexed by Daito and Sho's first inclusion but at least, I thought that they would make good plot devices or at a minimum, cannon fodder. The last thing I thought that they would be useful is as a real world Scooby gang. As for Wade's speech to rally the OASIS world, it should have happened sooner right after IOI blow up the trailer park. I kept waiting for Wade to call in an avatar press conference where he exposes his real identity and IOI's murder spree. Also, there is Samantha's god-awful ugly face. Yah, right. It's played up so much and yet it's only a Gorbachev birthmark. It misses a big point about that issue. She could easily cover it up with heavy makeup. Another thing, is Sorrento's big evil plan about pop up ads? Recent developments at Facebook show what actual damage to the social order looks like. This is kiddie writing by comparison in imagining the worst case scenario. In many ways, that's the problem. This could have been a deeper social commentary but it is mostly trying to be a fun videogame story. The final lesson is to go out and smell the flowers. It is the easiest and cheesiest of after school special. That's the level of the script."
Tinker Tailor Soldier Spy,8,0,5,18 August 2013," This is no 007
","It's the 70's in the world of British Intelligence. One of their four senior operative is suspected to be a Russian mole. George Smiley codename Beggarman (Gary Oldman) was forced into retirement but brought back in to hunt down the mole. Percy Alleline (Toby Jones) is codenamed Tinker. Bill Haydon (Colin Firth) is Tailor. Roy Bland (Ciarán Hinds) is Soldier.If 007 James Bond is the glitzy fanciful action hero spy in an unreal world, then John le Carré writes the exact opposite vision of the spy world. His is a murky, morally corrupt, unsatisfying world. And that's what we have here. The actors are beyond reproach. It's full of double speak, lies, and misdirections. Can they truly figure it all out? It's a great head scratching watch."
The Hateful Eight,8,3,8,27 May 2016," parlor mystery in a room
","After the war, O.B. is driving a stagecoach to Red Rock, Wyoming carrying bounty hunter John 'Hangman' Ruth (Kurt Russell) and his $10k quarry Daisy Domergue (Jennifer Jason Leigh). They stop for Major Marquis Warren (Samuel L. Jackson) who is stuck in the middle of nowhere with his three dead bounties. Next, the group picks up Chris Mannix (Walton Goggins) who claims to be the new sheriff in Red Rock. Warreb and Mannix clash over their separate war exploits. The group seeks shelter from a snow storm at Minnie's Haberdashery. Minnie and Sweet Dave are gone and Bob (Demián Bichir) claims to be in charge. There are passengers from an earlier coach. Oswaldo Mobray (Tim Roth) is the hangman going to Red Rock. Joe Gage (Michael Madsen) is a cowboy. General Sandy Smithers (Bruce Dern) is a former confederate.This is actually more like an Agatha Christie movie except Quentin Tarantino has his own special blood-splattering foul-mouthed ways to resolve the mystery. He orchestrates his type of murder mystery in a room. I would like Samuel L. Jackson to take more control as the protagonist. He should the character through which the audience sees the story. The other minor adjustment for me is a smaller cabin and more claustrophobic setting. This is definitely not for everybody. It is more like a violent, bloody stage play. Tarantino fans should not be disappointed."
Catch-22,7,3,5,22 November 2014," Some hilarious scenes in disjointed movie
","Captain Yossarian (Alan Arkin) is a WWII bombardier desperate to quit the war by claiming to be crazy. However Dr. Daneeka explains that there is a catch-22. People who are willing to fly the risky life and death missions are crazy. He is bound to release crazy people as long as they make a request. However if they ask, then they don't want to fly and therefore by definition are not crazy. Colonel Cathcart (Martin Balsam) is the callous commander who keeps increasing the missions required to go home. Tappman (Anthony Perkins) is the incompetent Chaplain. Captain Major (Bob Newhart) is given the squadron command seeing that he's the only Major around except Major is just his name and not his rank. Dobbs (Martin Sheen) is the bomber pilot. Milo Minderbinder (Jon Voight) is using various items in convoluted trades with wide ranging places taking the silk parachutes from the planes.This is very similar in tone with MASH. This is much more surreal. They're both anti-war black comedies. They both came out around the same time and of course, Catch-22 got crushed by the better MASH. The story feels like a bunch of disjointed skits. Some of it is hilarious. Alan Arkin is especially funny in his mania. Some of it is less funny. I would like a more straight forward story concentrating on fewer characters or maybe only Yossarian. I'm not a fan of the various 'dream' sequences since they usually stalls the movie. Later, it devolves into a series of Kafkaesque dream scenes. Most of it doesn't really work but it does recover somewhat."
"I, Tonya",8,1,1,17 March 2018," American infamy
","Tonya Harding (Margot Robbie) comes from poor white trash and her domineering, abusive mother LaVona (Allison Janney). She had a natural talent for skating from a young age and driven by her unrelenting mother. At 15, she meets Jeff Gillooly (Sebastian Stan). Despite her mother or maybe to spite her mother, she marries Gillooly who slowly turns more and more violent. Her ability to execute the triple axel jump puts her above her competitors but her lower class crass personality clashes with the judges. In the 1992 Winter Olympics, she fails to medal coming in fourth. She falls back into waitressing when her former coach Diane convinces her to return for the 1994 Winter Olympics. During the leadup, she would be embroiled in an infamous incident with fellow skater Nancy Kerrigan.It's funny at times with an undertone of Greek tragedy. It is pure delicious white trash infamy. It's great material and this movie has fun with it. It does have two hurdles to overcome. First is the unreliable narrator. The movie does play with this from a couple of different angles. It would be nice to play up even more this idea. It's fun and it inoculates against any slant in the story telling. The second is Margot Robbie's age. She's asked to play a very wide range from 15 all the way to present day. She doesn't look the part as a 15 year old. The movie could have played with that by claiming that she looked old for her age. It could be a funny jab at the filmmaking compromises. Quite frankly, she fits more after her failure in 92 and the movie works better as a struggling underdog. The more downtrodden the better she fits the role. Neither hurdle is major and both can be excused. Both Margot and Allison are terrific. Overall, this is a fun take on an infamous American story."
We Were Soldiers,8,1,2,8 April 2014," Great war action
","Lt. Col. Hal Moore (Mel Gibson) is a proponent of the new Air Cavalry strategy. He's a smart insightful soldier who forms an elite force combining ground forces with helicopters. The war in Vietnam is in its opening stages. The movie starts with their formation back in the States. It climaxes when in 1965, Moore and his men engage the much larger North Vietnamese force in a small battlefield in the first battle of its kind.Based on Moore's book, the action is compelling and realistic. The home front story doesn't detract from the action. It's important to see Moore's home life. The battle doesn't demonize the enemy, and shows as much as reasonably expected of the opposition. There is a few characters that is allowed to have compelling story lines. Even though the battlefield can be confusing, the movie never is."
Molly's Game,7,0,5,4 April 2018," Sorkin almost overwhelms
","Molly Bloom (Jessica Chastain) is driven by her domineering father (Kevin Costner) with trust issues. After a devastating crash during the Olympics ski trial, she decides to live life in LA for a year before starting law school. She's the black sheep of the family. She starts as a waitress, an office manager, and then organizing high stakes poker for her boss. With famous actor Player X (Michael Cera) as one of her regulars, she starts her own game. After some success, it goes wrong and she has to restart in New York. Years later, she is arrested as a part of a Russian mafia trial. Two years earlier, she had written a book about her exploits after the government confiscated all of her money. She hires reluctant Charlie Jaffey (Idris Elba) as her lawyer.Molly is a hard character to empathize with. She has a thick wall between her and the audience. She opens up very slowly but her wall never truly falls down. There is a climatic scene with her father in Central Park where her character breaks down emotionally. That meeting is too convenient. Is it even real? It would have been so much easier for him to be stalking her outside her apartment. There is also a tendency for Aaron Sorkin to overwrite his scenes. I love his poetic machine gun style but sometimes it's too much. For example, Jaffey's outburst at the opposing lawyers is too flashy. A simpler and more effective way would be for him to slowly realize the ridiculous Molly wiretaps and have a giant belly laugh. She doesn't say a word and he tells them about the drug reference. Sorkin needs a bit of silence which would actually elevate the writing. Sometimes, he is too much of a good thing. Molly has a great story. There is a small chance that Sorkin overwhelmed the telling of it."
Dear John,5,0,0,2 February 2014," Going back to the well once again
","John Tyree (Channing Tatum) is Army Special Forces on leave back home. Savannah Curtis (Amanda Seyfried) is a sweet popular girl. She falls for him right away after he dove off the pier to retrieve her purse.They're reusing the same formula again. Take two lovely young leads, and combine it with a Nicholas Sparks novel. There's even a rain soaked kissing scene in an unfinished house. There is basically nothing here other than the two likable leads. Richard Jenkins puts in a limited performance as John's autistic father. Their big fight seems manufactured. Too much of the movie has the two leads mostly communicating through letters. It's not a terribly dramatic movie. Even adding 9/11 doesn't make it any more compelling."
The Adventures of Tintin,7,1,2,14 September 2013," Good solid CG work
","If you're familiar with the great TinTin comic adventure books, then this grand sweeping adventure story is exactly what you'd expect from this franchise. Steven Spielberg uses a real CG motion capture technique. It looks pretty good. The facial expressions are head and shoulders better than Polar Express 7 years before. The eyes are getting better. The haunted blank face is no longer there. However it's still odd to try to pass a cartoon for real people.There is too much POV camera movements in long sweeping scenes. It's tiring for the eyes. And we've seen it before. There's no need to dwell on it. It's as if Spielberg wants to show off. It adds nothing to the storytelling. As for the story, I did find Captain Haddock annoying when drunk. I think it's supposed to be funny, but it's not funny. I really didn't find any jokes funny."
Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid,8,0,1,25 August 2014," charming cool fun duo
","Butch Cassidy (Paul Newman) is the leader of the Hole in the Wall Gang. His latest idea is to go to Bolivia with its supposed riches. The Sundance Kid (Robert Redford) is the quick draw of the group and his girl is Etta Place (Katharine Ross). The gang hits the Flyer train. The gang hits the Flyer again and they get ambushed. They are hounded by a posse of the best hired by the head of Union Pacific Railroad. They decide to go on the run with Etta and end up in rural Bolivia.This is sometimes funny but most of all, this is cool. Newman and Redford are playing this with a nudge and a wink. They're just having fun together. And the star power doesn't shine any brighter. The best scenes are always when the two are arguing. These guys just have great chemistry."
Moana,8,9,24,18 December 2016," fun music and compelling characters
","Moana is told the story of Maui (Dwayne Johnson) by her Gramma Tala. Maui is the warrior demigod who has a magical fishing hook which allows him to change shape. He had stolen the goddess Te Fiti's heart but he's attacked by the volcano demon Te Kā. He lost the heart and his hook. A darkness descended on the world. The people stopped exploring and the fish are disappearing. Moana's father Chief Tui forbids her from going beyond the reefs. Moana is given the heart by the sea and she disobeys her father to go exploring. She finds Maui and together, they battle coconut pirates and Te Kā to return the heart to Te Fiti.There is a lot going for this movie. The animation is beautiful. The characters are compelling. There is a bit humor and an interesting adventure. Lin-Manuel Miranda adds his Broadway musical skills to create a few catchy tunes. It does follow the successful recent Disney formula of an empowered young girls overcoming dire odds and low sexist expectations. The filmmakers seem to know the expectations and even Moana rebels against being called a princess. The formula may be familiar but the setting is new. Overall, this simply works."
Ocean's Twelve,6,0,1,14 April 2014," Reunion not as much fun
","Daniel Ocean (George Clooney) is still itching for the life. Terry Benedict (Andy Garcia) tracks down Tess (Julia Roberts) and he wants his money back plus an exorbitant interest even though he already got it back from the insurance company. Benedict starts to track down the Ocean's Eleven crew. The crew gets back together to pull off jobs so that they could pay back Benedict. However this time they are being hounded by a brilliant investigator Isabel Lahiri (Catherine Zeta-Jones).It takes too long to set up. It would be much more thrilling to have Benedict just kidnap everybody. The setup is a little thin. If Carl Reiner wanted a small role, they could easily have his character in a hood as a kidnap victim for the entire movie. The chances are better that some if not most would just run in this story. Then of course, there wouldn't be a movie. It just rambles on and on without the excitement or fun of the original. At least, nobody said no to George or Soderbergh . The star power is the main reason to catch this movie."
Crash,6,1,1,20 January 2016," too many characters leave them feeling thin
","It's a day and a half in Los Angeles. Police detectives Ria (Jennifer Esposito) and Waters (Don Cheadle) get into a car crash. Waters walks over to examine a dead body in a crime scene. Yesterday, Persian shop owner Farhad and his daughter Dorri buy a gun. Anthony (Ludacris) and Peter (Larenz Tate) talk about racism. Jean (Sandra Bullock) and husband DA Rick Cabot (Brendan Fraser) get carjacked by them. Jean complains about locksmith Daniel Ruiz (Michael Peña). Officer Tom Hansen (Ryan Phillippe) is concerned about his partner John Ryan (Matt Dillon) after he stops TV director Cameron Thayer (Terrence Howard) and his wife Christine (Thandie Newton).Paul Haggis weaves together a bunch of stories about the isolated nature of L.A. and the moments when they crash into each other. It tackles issues of race and perceptions. This has some great individual scenes. The problem is that Haggis has included so many characters that the heavy subject matter feel very superficial. For example, Sandra Bullock is playing a harsher character but the movie doesn't dig into her background. Haggis may have the best intention but the characters are thin while their stories are incredibly deep."
Snatch,7,1,3,29 April 2014," Guy Ritchie's style on full display
","Turkish (Jason Statham) and his buddy Tommy are two low life boxing promoters. They get entangled with a diamond heist when they try to get incomprehensible Mickey (Brad Pitt) to fight for them. Meanwhile the wild casts of underworld criminals get involved with this boxing match.Writer/director Guy Ritchie introduces the audience to a vast array of wild and crazy criminals. It's his second movie after 'Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels'. He has a crazy unique style. The story is hard to follow, but it's not actually the most important part of the movie. It's Guy Ritchie's unreserved style and excessive energy that is on display here. It's a constant stream of outrageous characters, over the top mannerisms, and great actors having loads of fun. Brad Pitt is completely wacko. There is just so much going on in this one."
BlacKkKlansman,7,13,25,4 November 2018," compelling story
","Ron Stallworth (John David Washington) is the first black police officer in 1970's Colorado Springs, Colorado. He faces racism in the department and is eager to go undercover. His first assignment is to attend a speech by a former Black Panther. He starts dating Patrice Dumas (Laura Harrier), the president of the Black Student Union. After reading an ad in the newspaper, he calls up the KKK to apply for membership. He is readily accepted by local leader Walter Breachway (Ryan Eggold) with only one problem. He can't meet Breachway face to face. He recruits Detective Flip Zimmerman (Adam Driver) to be the face while he provides the voice. Eventually, he would even connect with Grand Wizard David Duke (Topher Grace).Flip's infiltration into the local KKK is compelling. It seems immediately stupid that Ron continues to do the calls. It's not a carefully conceived investigation. Also the third act bombing is too conveniently staged. It needs to be more realistic and more messy. It wraps up too neatly. There are aspects that feels too artificial which detracts from the tension. The subject matter requires the movie to be more real. At times, Spike Lee pushes into satire territories but nevertheless, it is still one of his better recent movies."
Spider-Man: Homecoming,8,2,4,29 September 2017," fun comic book fare
","Salvager Adrian Toomes (Michael Keaton) holds a grudge against Tony Stark (Robert Downey Jr.) after his takeover of the Battle of New York cleanup. Toomes kept some of the Chitauri tech to create new weapons. Eight years later after the events of Civil War, Peter Parker (Tom Holland) returns to his school, Midtown School of Science and Technology. He lives with his sought-after aunt May (Marisa Tomei). He has a crush on classmate Liz. His best friend Ned discovers his secret identity Spider-Man. There is also the sarcastic academic teammate Michelle (Zendaya).This is fun. It's got the comic book action. It weaves into the MCU with ease. RDJ has a supporting role which is more than a simple cameo. This definitely has the John Hughes vibe. It's nice light fun in this overarching comics universe. Holland is a great teen Spider-man as he showed in Civil War. The young cast is terrific and Keaton is an awesome villain. Keaton has real depth which is built over the years. His humanity creates more than a comic book villain. The surprise connection hits it out of the park. This is simply a good movie."
Dr. Strangelove or: How I Learned to Stop Worrying and Love the Bomb,8,0,3,1 March 2014," Mildly funny but important nevertheless
","Brigadier General Jack Ripper (Sterling Hayden) of Burpelson Air Force Base has gone crazy and orders his bombers to drop their nukes on the Ruskies. He is paranoid about the purity of the American bodily fluids and fluoridation. General Turgidson (George C. Scott) tries to explain how this happened to President Merkin Muffley (Peter Sellers) in the iconic war room as he argues for total nuclear first strike.This is another masterpiece from director Stanley Kubrick. It is a satire and an important peace movie. It's not really a laugh out loud movie. It is a movie in love with the absurd and the ridiculous. The tension and the pacing isn't that high especially considering the movie has a natural ticking clock. It likes to take its time. The comedy is a time capsule of its era. However considering how many iconic moments this movie has, this is a truly important film."
The Bodyguard,6,2,3,9 April 2014," A very standard movie with a little bit of corn
","Former Secret Service agent Frank Farmer (Kevin Costner) is a no nonsense bodyguard who doesn't like to get involved with his clients or stay around too long. Rachel Marron (Whitney Houston) is a pop diva with a stalker. Her manager Devaney (Bill Cobbs) begs Frank to work for her. She is reluctantly to have the bodyguard interfere with her life, and it's obvious that they haven't told her the worst of the situation.Written by Lawrence Kasdan and directed by Mick Jackson, this is a very standard and predictable thriller. Kevin Costner is very solid as the straight laced guard. Some may downgrade the movie because of Whitney Houston. However I found her to be a good natural performer especially for someone who is untrained. She actually adds a sense of reality. There is no denying that she has the persona of a pop diva. And it helps to have her great soundtrack to prove the point. The romance is a bit corny. That's probably its biggest weak point. The movie expects a little too much from an acting novice."
The Beach,4,3,5,21 March 2015," unlikeable characters lack heart
",Richard (Leonardo DiCaprio) comes to Bangkok looking for something crazy different from his safe life. He meets wild man Daffy (Robert Carlyle) who later commits suicide leaving him a map to a secret beach. He convinces French couple Françoise (Virginie Ledoyen) and Étienne (Guillaume Canet) to join him. The island is in a prohibited nature reserve and growing vast amounts of marijuana under guard. They escape the criminals and find their way to the beach already occupied by a society of young people led by Sal (Tilda Swinton).Leo is a young unlikeable brat. Françoise lacks the charisma despite being very hot. Their chemistry is hampered by the presence of her boyfriend. They don't have much chemistry even without her boyfriend. They do make a hot couple. The film is unfocused. Danny Boyle jazzes up this adventure but it's missing its heart.

","Han Solo is locked in Carbonite imprisoned in Jabba the Hutt's palace on Tatooine. Luke Skywalker is now a Jedi master. The group has a daring plan to rescue Han. The empire is building a new Death Star. The rebellion plans to destroy it by taking down the shield generators on the moon of Endor. There they are aided by the diminutive native Ewoks. Meanwhile, the Emperor is trying to lure Luke to the dark side.I first saw this in the theater but lineups made us late. We were stuck in the front row. I've seen it many times since. The Jabba the Hutt section is terrific. Slave Leia taking control of the deck gun is amazing. Almost everything is perfect. The speeder bike sequences are terrific action and the space battle is great. The allure of the dark side is powerfully shown. The only drawback are the Ewoks. They simply look too much like teddy bears and speaks to Lucas' need to play to the kids. Some at-st destruction seems too unlikely. It's like a kid imagining fun silly ways to destroy his toy at-st. Those are minor problems. As for the Special Edition changes, most are fine and unnecessary. There is one glaring, horrifying change. The song and dance at Jabba the Hutt's palace is undeniably bad. It is one of the worst things ever in Star Wars. I can excuse Jar-Jar but I cannot excuse that."

","American agents Luke Hobbs (Dwayne Johnson) and Riley (Gina Carano) are after super international criminal Shaw (Luke Evans) and his crew. Shaw is stealing components to assemble an electronic super weapon. Dominic Toretto (Vin Diesel) and the others have scattered around the world after their heist in Brazil in 'Fast Five'. Hobbs lures Dom and the others back with intel that Letty (Michelle Rodriguez) is still alive. With the promise of pardons, Dom and the family take on their evil twins.The family is back. So is the ridiculous story and the crazy action. And there are the cars, and the babes. If you're a fan of the franchise, then you'll love this. Even if you're not, you'll probably have a fun time. Having Gina Carano fight is a great addition for this movie. She and Michelle Rodriguez have a couple of great fights. The one in the subway is epic. The fact is Gina always looks real when she starts kicking. The action is bigger than ever. I was worried a bit with the bullet-proof super carts, but the tank is big time fun. And picking on Tyrese Gibson is so brilliantly enjoyable."
The Expendables,7,0,4,4 October 2013," Sly knows action
","Who knows if Sylvester Stallone is actually the source of the idea to bring all these old geezers together, but whoever it was deserves a Nobel Peace Prize Medal. Barney Ross (Sylvester Stallone) leads a group of mercenaries. Jason Statham has some fun jokey chemistry as Lee Christmas. Jet Li is the martial arts expert. Terry Crews is firing off big weapons. The other muscle heads include Dolph Lundgren, Randy Couture, and Steve Austin.The story really doesn't matter much. Sly is actually a very competent action director. And it's great to see these guys do what they naturally like to do. It is a rocking hard action nostalgic walk down memory lane."
Scary Movie 2,5,0,1,26 October 2014," A few passable laughs
","Hell House is a haunted place where there was an attempted exorcism on Megan (Natasha Lyonne). One year later, professor Oldman (Tim Curry) is using students Cindy Campbell (Anna Faris), Ray Wilkins (Shawn Wayans), Shorty Meeks (Marlon Wayans) and Brenda Meeks (Regina Hall) to awaken Hell House. They are monitored by the professor and his assistant Dwight Hartman (David Cross). The house caretaker is Hanson (Chris Elliott). The other invited students include Buddy (Christopher Masterson) who pines for Cindy, Alex (Tori Spelling) and hot Theo (Kathleen Robertson).The Exorcist spoof start isn't that funny with a couple of passable gross out jokes. The main spoof is The Haunting. It's great to have Anna Faris back. There is a constant flow of gross out jokes. They're not always particularly insightful or relevant to the horror genre. There are a few big laughs but it's mostly a lot of random jokes that don't work. Following a single movie spoof gives the movie a better and more consistent flow."
MASH,8,0,0,12 October 2013," Altman style changes the landscape
","This is the Korean War from the perspective of the wacky characters of the 4077 MASH unit. They are a mobile hospital in a draft army in a muddy war.This is Robert Altman's first big screen success. It has all his style that will become his hallmarks in the years to come. It has the documentary style with multiple characters speaking at once. It has the rambling improvised feel. It definitely benefited from its time in history. Released at the height of the Vietnam war, this portrayal of the Korean War must have been down right eerie.The actors are top rate. Donald Sutherland and Elliott Gould are terrific leads. Sally Kellerman's Hot Lips has the iconic naked shower scene. It's odd to see Robert Duvall as Maj. Frank Burns, but he leaves early in the movie anyways. It's a solid movie that changes the landscape of movie making."
Pan's Labyrinth,9,1,3,27 April 2014," Guillermo del Toro is a visionary
",It's 1944 in fascist Spain. Ofelia (Ivana Baquero) is going up to the mountains with her mother to live with her stepfather. Her father was a simple tailor who died during the civil war. Her mother married the cruel vicious Captain. She's pregnant with his son and he cares more about him than her. He is hunting the revolutionary hold outs hiding in the mountains. Ofelia finds odd looking ruins and sees a fantasy world in them. Meanwhile Mercedes (Maribel Verdú) is working at the house while helping the revolutionaries in the woods.This movie sets Guillermo del Toro up as a cinematic visionary. It is visually imaginative and unique. The acting is mostly well done headed by the always compelling Maribel Verdú. Ivana Baquero has the innocent look that is so essential. The violence can be brutal. It's like a fairy tale fantasy got mixed up with a horror movie.
Final Destination 2,5,0,2,21 October 2013," Lesser continuation of original
","It's one year after the plane crash in the first movie. Kimberly Corman (A.J. Cook) foresees a multi-car pileup of death and destruction. Her premonition stops a whole bunch of motorists from dying, but only for awhile. Kimberly tries to seek help from Clear Rivers (Ali Larter) who is the sole survivor from the first one.The concept is no longer new. It's the same weird-things-happen and the survivors die. They hope to discover an ultimate way to defeat death by bringing new life into the world.It doesn't help that Kimberly's friends who we get introduced to are killed off right away. Most of the victims are little more than interchangeable no names to be crossed off one at a time. It's great to see Ali Larter back in the series. Too bad it feels so much like a repeat."
The Flowers of War,6,1,7,8 September 2013," could have been great
","It's 1937 China. Mortician John (Christian Bale) arrives at a Catholic church in Nanjing to prepare a priest for burial. It's the middle of the Japanese invasion and the Nanjing massacre ensues. He finds himself alone with a group of girl students. When a group of prostitutes from a nearby brothel arrive, he becomes the unwilling protector of both groups.This is fully a Chinese film staring Christian Bale. Given the subject matter, I'd hope that they make the action more realistic. It certainly had the potential and the scale of a great movie. However the unrealistic action and the contrived awkward story of sacrifice just can't be overcome. It could have been great despite its white-savior core."
Blade II,5,1,2,23 May 2014," Close call but a couple of things bothered me
","Blade (Wesley Snipes) rescues Whistler (Kris Kristofferson) from one of the vampire's tanks and turns him back into human. Scud (Norman Reedus) is Blade's new human sidekick. There is a new form of mutant vampires called The Reaper. They are even more powerful than the regular vampires. Blade must form an alliance with the Shadow Council to battle this new threat. He teams up with the elite vampire team The Bloodpack.The new type of vampires look alright. There is more CGI blood and a higher body count. The fights are back. I guess if blood, kills, and fights are what you're looking for. And why not. Then this movie has it all and more of it. However I don't particularly like the CGI fights. They look like a video game. I always prefer the real hand-to-hand combat stunts. The other thing that irked me is the quick return of Whistler. While it's understandable to revive Whistler, it was done so quickly that it strikes a sour note. Those are annoying enough for me to marginally vote this down."
The Way Back,7,0,0,24 December 2013," Good performances
","A group of gulag prisoners escape from Siberia and walk all the way to India. Janusz (Jim Sturgess) is a Polish prisoner. Valka (Colin Farrell) has a criminal past. Mr Smith (Ed Harris) is an American. Irena (Saoirse Ronan) is a girl they pick up along the way.There is an allusion to a true story of 3 prisoners emerging in India. That story is questionable, but more importantly, it distracts from the movie. The reality of the movie becomes a constant nagging question. It is probably better to just let the story be completely fictional. Irena is probably the hardest to believe. She's an obvious device to add drama.The best performance may be Colin Farrell. The accent can be excused. It's his intensity that stands out. And Jim Sturgess is compelling. All the acting is superb."
Knocked Up,8,2,4,22 March 2014," Hilarious
","Ben Stone (Seth Rogen) is a weed smoking party animal and leader of his pack of friends. Alison Scott (Katherine Heigl) works at E! living with her sister Debbie (Leslie Mann) and her family (Paul Rudd, Iris Apatow, Maude Apatow). She's getting promoted to an on-screen position. Then after one drunken night at the bar, they end up in an one-night stand.Writer/director Judd Apatow is bringing the mj smoking, gross out, inappropriate comedy to a new frontier. It is one of the few pregnancy comedies that work. Seth Rogen is great as a lovable slob. Leslie Mann and her kids are hilarious with Paul Rudd. Where baby comes from has never been funnier. His gang is chalk full of crazy funny Apatow alumni. It's a sweet hearted comedy for everybody with a good sense of humor."
Begin Again,7,0,1,7 March 2015," good but not as great as Once
","Dan Mulligan (Mark Ruffalo) is a drunken executive of an indie record label. He headed A&R at Island Records for 2 years before starting his own label Distressed Records with Saul Byron (Yasiin Bey). However he has been down and out for years. He's separated from his wife Miriam (Catherine Keener) and estranged from his daughter Violet (Hailee Steinfeld). He gets fired from his own label and then he sees Gretta James (Keira Knightley) performing at a bar after she's pushed onto the stage by her friend Steve (James Corden). She had come to NYC with boyfriend Dave Kohl (Adam Levine). Dave became an overnight success after his music got onto a movie. He cheated on her and they broke up right before that night at the bar.Writer/director John Carney fails to relive the same magic as his big breakout 'Once'. It would be a disservice to dismiss this movie for failing to jump that high bar. It's hard to capture magic twice especially in a similar fashion. My first opinion as I watched the movie is that Dan is from another era and Carney is past his due date. Then it turns out that Dan is actually coming from another era. His character quickly grows on me. Keira Knightley is a great actress but only an adequate singer. On the other hand, Adam Levine is the exact opposite. They're both good enough at their weaker sides to make this movie work. Their scenes together are good with Keira doing most of the heavy lifting. Keira's singing is weak but the group production is able to pump her up. James Corden adds a little fun. I was also a little hesitant about the flashbacks and forwards until the imaginary musical instruments scene. That is a wonderful touch. It's also a terrific love note to NYC."
Megamind,7,1,2,28 October 2013," more serious without the cute minions
","Villain Megamind (Will Ferrell) is an alien sent to Earth growing up alongside good guy Metro Man (Brad Pitt). While love and support showered Metro Man, Megamind was despised growing up in a prison. Then in one of his evil schemes, Megamind surprisingly kills Metro Man by accidentally discovering his copper weakness. Megamind loses his reason for being when he doesn't have a good guy to oppose him. So he sets out to create a good guy hero. Only it completely backfires, and Megamind must figure out how to save the day.There is some fun in this. The evil schemes should be more silly and less deadly. To start off the movie by killing a character is a little bit morbid and a little bit too serious. The twist is great. It takes the whole superhero genre much more seriously than the usual kiddie fare.The biggest problem is that this followed the much cuter Despicable Me. This is a more serious themed movie while the other villain led movie is a wacky cartoon. Even though both have minions, the Despicable Minions are super cute and super hilarious. Megamind just doesn't sell as well."
Alien,10,3,5,25 October 2013," A new level for Sci-fi Horror
","An alien distress call from an uncharted planet awaken the crew of the deep space towing vessel Nostromo. They go down to the planet to investigate only to bring back something dangerous.The story is a fairly simple creature feature in a spaceship. Ridley Scott took that simple story and gave it everything needed to make a new standard in sci-fi horror. Before it the sci-fi horror is the mainstay of B-movie schlock. After it the genre reach a new golden age. The same way that Star Wars pushed the envelope, the same can be said of Alien.The atmosphere is fantastic. Ridley Scott has packed in some iconic scenes. Who can forget the meal scene? It's going down in movie history. That are some movies that transcend a simple movie. This is one of them."
The Book Thief,6,1,2,22 November 2014," OK but needs more danger earlier
","It's 1938 Germany. Liesel Meminger (Sophie Nélisse)'s little brother dies. She is left to foster parents Hans (Geoffrey Rush) and Rosa Hubermann (Emily Watson). Rosa is not happy because she was promised two kids with the expected allowance. Rosa is not nice especially about Liesel's communist mother. Hans is much nicer calling Liesel 'Her Majesty'. Liesel befriends neighbor boy Rudy Steiner. She is bullied for being illiterate but she knows how to fight. Hans teaches her to read. After a Nazi book burning rally, Liesel saves one of the books. Max Vandenburg (Ben Schnetzer) is a Jew and on the run. His father gave up his life in the Great War to save Hans, and Hans returns the favor by hiding him in the basement.The intention is good. The movie is professionally made with some great actors. The girl Sophie Nélisse is a good little actress. However there is a lack of tension for the first half of the movie. The narration by Death gives a surreal literary feel to the movie. Director Brian Percival needs to find ways to inject danger into the movie as much as possible. I'm not suggesting that Nazi jack boots should be stomping around all the time or bombs should be falling day and night. Rudy could sneak in and run around. Or the bully kid could be stalking little Liesel. The movie needs danger to raise the tension and do it much earlier."
Sweeney Todd: The Demon Barber of Fleet Street,8,1,1,10 August 2016," Tim Burton's dark opera
","Benjamin Barker (Johnny Depp) returns to London with friend Anthony Hope after being falsely convicted by Judge Turpin (Alan Rickman). He returns to his shop above Mrs. Nellie Lovett (Helena Bonham Carter) and her worst pies in London. She tells him that Turpin lusted after his wife Lucy and abused her to death with his henchman Beadle Bamford (Timothy Spall). Turpin has taken his daughter Johanna Barker as his charge. Anthony falls for Johanna who is imprisoned in her gilded cage and is beaten by Beadle. Benjamin takes on the new identity of Sweeney Todd. He wins a battle with traveling barber Adolfo Pirelli (Sacha Baron Cohen) and reopens his barber shop.It's a cold, brutal, dark musical. The performances are brilliant especially Depp. The coloring, the dreamlike visual, and the brutal style are all compelling. The blood-splattering slices are wonderful. The whole movie has a dark menacing beauty about it."
Blades of Glory,6,1,2,1 February 2014," Figure skating may be beyond parody
","Jimmy MacElroy (Jon Heder) was picked out of an orphanage at the age of 4 to train to skate with the money and obsession of Darren MacElroy (William Fichtner). Chazz Michael Michaels (Will Ferrell) is a renegade rocker figure skater from the Detroit undergrounds. At the Olympics, they tie for first. When they get on the podium, they fight and get banned for life. It's 3 and a half years later. Jimmy has been left on the side of the road by Darren and is toiling away in a sporting goods store. Chazz is drunker than ever skating in a kids show. Then they realize there is a loophole allowing them to skate in another category. After watching them fight again, Coach (Craig T. Nelson) realizes that they make for a great skating pair. They will have to win against the Waldenberg twins skating champs (Will Arnett, Amy Poehler).Will Ferrell is going all out with a way out there character. Jon Heder is lovely and effeminate. The inappropriate Waldenberg twins played by Will Arnett and Amy Poehler get the most fun. Everybody is trying to one up each other. This is an SNL sketch stretched to its limits. The laughs are too few and far between. I appreciate the effort, but it's more wacky than funny."
Horrible Bosses,7,0,1,1 January 2014," Some stupid hilarity
","Three friends have horrible bosses, and try to get rid of them. Nick (Jason Bateman) is in sales hoping for a promotion, but his boss Dave (Kevin Spacey) steals his job for himself. Dale (Charlie Day) has a boss Julia (Jennifer Aniston) who's sexually harassing him. Kurt (Jason Sudeikis) has a nice boss, but he dies and leaves the company to his douche son Bobby (Colin Farrell).It's a bit too serious at times. The stupidity gets a little funny. There are some hilarious moments. Charlie Day's manic idiocy can be very annoying and very funny. Sometimes it's both at the same time. In the end, the guys are just likable enough. The humor is just silly enough. It's a good comedy that breaks out every once in a while."
The Doors,7,4,6,1 May 2016," solid biopic
","It's 1965 L.A. Jim Morrison (Val Kilmer), UCLA film student, meets Pam Courson (Meg Ryan). He quits school and forms The Doors with Ray Manzarek (Kyle MacLachlan), John Densmore (Kevin Dillon), and Robby Krieger (Frank Whaley). They become one of the foremost counter culture rock banks of the era. The band drifts apart as Jim travels a different path with witchy journalist Patricia Kennealy (Kathleen Quinlan). In 1970, he faces charges for exposing himself during a Miami concert. He's living with Pam when he dies in Paris at age 27 in 1971.Director Oliver Stone delivers a solid biopic with his cinematic style to depict the drugged out hippie time and the chaotic nature of the band. Val Kilmer delivers his most impressive performance of his career. The movie could probably add some drama but I'm not sure how exactly. The world is burning down and he's a part of the chaos. His end is predictable for fans and newcomers alike. There may be a dramatic story in there somewhere."
The Polar Express,4,2,6,9 December 2013," Creepy Dead Eyes
",It's the first big attempt at motion capture all CGI animation full length movie. It is commendable of director Robert Zemeckis to attempt such a feat. It is a technological step forward. But the creepy eyes.... the creepy dead eyes.A boy is doubting the reality of Santa. A mysterious train comes to his house. He boards it and finds other kids going to the North Pole. The fact is this is not a very magical voyage. The song and dance isn't that good. There is an air of hollow fake fun in this movie. And that doesn't include the creepy eyes.... The creepy dead eyes.And I didn't really see any magic in the North Pole. It felt more like an old industrial English town. I really wanted more magic for the workshop. And then there were the creepy eyes.... the creepy dead eyes.
Malcolm X,8,2,5,12 June 2015," fascinating figure from a great actor
","During the war years in Boston, Malcolm Little (Denzel Washington) and his friend Shorty (Spike Lee) are zoot suit wearing, hair-straightening negroes about town. His father was a preacher in Nebraska urging a return to Africa and killed by the KKK. His mother was born to a black woman raped by a white man. He is taken by Sophia (Kate Vernon) and gangster West Indian Archie (Delroy Lindo). He leaves his innocent black girlfriend and goes into a life of crime. Malcolm and Shorty are imprisoned for 10 years of hard times. In prison, he is befriended by Baines who introduces him to Elijah Muhammad and the Nation of Islam. He falls in love with Dr. Betty Shabazz (Angela Bassett).Director Spike Lee dives into a fascinating historical figure with the great Denzel Washington. His charisma is perfectly translated and transformed on the screen. That's not to say there are no problems in this movie. The pacing is a little slow at times. I don't want Spike Lee to act in this movie. It's too much of a distraction. Spike does lay out his life very well and leaves it up to audience to some extent on what his life truly means. The movie probably needs somebody with less reverence to be more merciless in the editing room."
Black Mass,7,0,1,4 September 2016," Johnny Depp is back acting
","James 'Whitey' Bulger (Johnny Depp) is a small time Irish mobster in Southie Boston. FBI agent John Connolly (Joel Edgerton), from the neighborhood, recruits Whitey to be an informant through his political brother Billy Bulger (Benedict Cumberbatch). Connolly and his boss Agent Charles McGuire (Kevin Bacon) are trying to bring down the Italian mob in Boston. The loyalty of Connolly is in doubt as McGuire demands more from Whitey who starts to become a powerful gangster.Johnny Depp regains his acting cred. The story is told in a straight forward manner. It's a bit too straight. Connolly is the missing emotional drama element. Edgerton is fine but his character could have been even more epic. In many ways, his character is the mystery and the possible main character study. It's his character that changes throughout the story. It's his character that provides a possible arc. The reveal of his manufacturing of Whitey's information is a dramatic highlight. The question of why is touched on but it could be a whole movie by itself. Connolly would make for a superior main character. That's not saying that the acting from both is anything but top rate."
Nacho Libre,5,0,0,23 December 2015," slightly amusing in a few scenes
","Ignacio (Jack Black) is the cook in a monastery orphanage. Nacho falls in love with the new teacher Sister Encarnación (Ana de la Reguera). He befriends thief Steven (Héctor Jiménez) as they train to be Mexican wrestlers Nacho and Esqueleto.Director Jared Hess of Napoleon Dynamite fame gets a leading comedic talent. It doesn't really work. There are a couple a slightly amusing moments. Jack Black puts on such an unusual mannerism that it doesn't allow the humor to shine. Instead, it's an one-note character that keeps repeating. This seems like a skit character given a full length movie. He's also not that lovable."
The Best Years of Our Lives,8,1,1,10 February 2015," well made timely characters
","Three servicemen return from WWII each facing their own readjustments. Fred Derry (Dana Andrews), Al Stephenson (Fredric March) and Homer Parrish (Harold Russell) get on the same flight. Sailor Homer lost his hands when his ship was sunk. He's modest but is concerned about his fiancÃ©e's true feelings. Everybody walk on egg shells with him. Al returns to his affluent life with his loving wife (Myrna Loy) and their kids Peggy and Rob (Teresa Wright, Michael Hall) but struggles nevertheless. Fred returns to his working class parents to find his wife Marie had moved out to work at a nightclub. The three men run into each other in a bar. Peggy falls for the married Fred.Homer is heart breaking in the very traditional melodramatic way. Al is fascinating in that he has everything and yet he still reconnect. It is well acted with a timely subject matter at the time. It reminds me of the various PTSD movies arising in more modern times. In fact, Fred is suffering from PTSD. I'm sure these characters really hit home for the returning GIs and their families."
The Town,8,9,12,30 November 2013," Jeremy Renner intense
","Four friends Doug MacRay (Ben Affleck), James Coughlin (Jeremy Renner), Albert Magloan (Slaine) and Desmond Elden (Owen Burke) are robbers working the Charlestown neighborhood of Boston. In their latest job, they take the bank manager Claire Keesey (Rebecca Hall) hostage and then let her go. Doug fake dates Claire to make sure she can't ID them. He's also having sex with James' drugged out sister Krista Coughlin (Blake Lively). Meanwhile they are being investigated by the FBI led by Agent Adam Frawley (Jon Hamm).This is a richly character driven crime thriller. Ben Affleck knows these characters well. And acting with the intense Jeremy Renner makes Affleck better. The only actor who looks out of place is Blake Lively. She just can't get rid of that Cali feel and her accent sounds terrible. Brit Rebecca Hall does a better job than her. The action is exciting. And the story is riveting. But it's the characters and the actors that are so engaging."
Underworld Awakening,6,0,3,30 December 2013," Needs Scott Speedman
","It's the near future, and the human world has discover vampires & Lycans. Selene (Kate Beckinsale) and Michael gets captured and stored in frozen captivity. Then 12 years after the Cleansing, Selene is free by another test subject in the lab called Eve (India Eisley) who Selene believes is her and Michael's offspring.The visual look is slightly weaker than the original. But it is a lot of action. It really doesn't stop for much of the last half of the movie. The larger Lycan CGI looks kinda fake. But I still like the action.This one really misses Scott Speedman only because Michael is constantly being referenced. Selene is looking for him throughout the movie. That's why he needs to make a cameo. Maybe he'll return in future installments."
Closer,8,0,1,5 February 2014," Four Great Performances
","Dan (Jude Law), an obituary writer, falls for stripper Alice (Natalie Portman) who is new in London. Later Dan writes a book about Alice, and meets photographer Anna (Julia Roberts). Alice knows she's losing Dan. Dan tricks dermatologist Larry (Clive Owen) on an internet chat, and Larry meets Anna. Larry marries Anna but the wander eye strikes again.Director Mike Nichols is going minimalist with Patrick Marber's play. This is a movie with four incredible performances. Clive Owen is brutal. Natalie Portman is hurt. Jude Law is childish. Julia Roberts is wonderful. They are doing some of their best work here. Don't come for a rom-com. This is emotionally vicious, damaged, pathetic human relationships."
Suicide Squad,6,13,23,26 December 2016," actually OK with lots of annoying little problems
","Amanda Waller (Viola Davis) recruits various criminals from a black site in Louisiana to battle the new unprecedented dangers. June Moone (Cara Delevingne) is an archaeologist who got possessed by a witch named Enchantress. Special forces Rick Flag (Joel Kinnaman) fell in love with her and leads the group. Floyd Lawton (Will Smith) is assassin Deadshot who can't miss. The most important thing in his life is his daughter. George Harkness (Jai Courtney) is Captain Boomerang. Chato Santana is El Diablo but he has turned pacifist. Waylon Jones is Killer Croc. Tatsu Yamashiro is Katana with a soul stealing sword. There is Harley Quinn (Margot Robbie), the psycho love of The Joker (Jared Leto). A powerful danger is unleashed in Midway City and the group is called.This was critically panned by the majority. I expected more of a mess. The story is simple and easy to follow. No doubt, there are some jarring edits with some disjointed flow. It's a little bothersome but it doesn't make it incomprehensible. The movie just keeps hitting speed bumps with annoying little problems. What's with Enchantress' movements? Her whole character is problematic. Why would Harley Quinn go back? Why would Waller kill everyone? There are varying problems in the writing. On the positive side, these are interesting characters well played by skilled actors. Will Smith, Margot Robbie, and Jared Leto are standouts. Joker and Harley Quinn have a great story together. If anything, this shows potential for these characters into the future."
Battleship Potemkin,9,1,3,13 December 2014," A thoroughly modern sequence
","This is based on the mutiny in 1905. Sailors on the battleship Potemkin refuse to eat soup from the rotten meat. The officers order some of men executed. When the firing squad refuse the order, the ship explode in revolution. Their story spread in the port of Odessa. The Cossacks attack the defenseless people of the city. The battleship open fire against the Tsarist forces and then sail to face the fleet. The other ships refuse to fire and join in the revolution.Most of the movie is well-made. The story is simple. It does need a protagonist to break a POV but this is very much a communist film. It's about the people and about the amazing tracking shots on the steps. It looks good even today. It's dynamic and wonderful. It probably took people at the time by surprise. It is a thoroughly modern edited sequence. It also has that baby in the carriage. Wonderful."
Elf,8,1,2,30 November 2013," childlike Ferrell fun
",Orphan Buddy (Will Ferrell) sneaks in Santa (Edward Asner)'s bag and ends up in the North Pole. Papa Elf (Bob Newhart) raises Buddy as an elf. His giantness causes all kinds of problems. Santa allows him to go to New York City to find his birth father Walter Hobbs (James Caan) who is actually on Santa's naughty list. He gets a job at a store and befriends fellow worker Jovie (Zooey Deschanel).Childlike Will Ferrell is giving off so much joy and innocence. He is so silly that it is impossible to not laugh at his slapstick humor. He fully commits and that's what makes it so hilarious. The only minor difficulty lies with James Caan. His personality is way too intense for a wacky comedy. But it picks up whenever he reunites with sweetheart Zooey Deschanel. And he has good fun with his brother Michael. Jon Favreau has created a wacky comedy with a heart.
Taxi Driver,9,2,4,5 September 2013," Disturbing Look into a Disturbed Mind
","Travis Bickle (Robert DeNiro) is a disturbed ex-Marine Vietnam vet. He's suffering from insomnia, and spends his nights driving a cab. He's sexually perverted, and obsessed with Betsy (Cybill Shepherd). On top of it all, he wants to save 12 year old prostitute Iris (Jodie Foster).DeNiro delivered one of the iconic performances of all times. Travis Bickle is one of the standards by which all performances are judged. Martin Scorsese is making a disturbing movie. It can be hard to watch at times. Scorsese uses his camera to maximum effect. As Bickle's mind drift from his co-workers, Scorsese's camera drift into the antacid fizzling in his glass. The grittiness of '70s NY is all there. Jodie Foster is shocking. Trying to watch Bickle can be a very trying experience. It isn't an easy movie. But it is a masterpiece."
Shutter Island,6,5,10,20 June 2014," Didn't like the twist
",It's 1954. U.S. marshal Teddy Daniels (Leonardo DiCaprio) investigates the disappearance of a patient from Boston's Shutter Island Ashecliffe Hospital for the criminally insane. His new partner is Chuck Aule (Mark Ruffalo). His wife Dolores (Michelle Williams) was killed by arsonist Andrew Laeddis. The agents are forced to give up their firearms. Dr. Cawley (Ben Kingsley) is in charge. Rachel Solando is the patient who has disappeared. Her primary doctor Dr. Sheehan left on vacation. Teddy is haunted by vision of the liberation of Dachau. Dr. Naehring (Max von Sydow) refuses to hand over any of the files and a frustrated Teddy vows to leave the next morning.Director Martin Scorsese maximizes the moody atmosphere with the creepy grand Gothic setting and the encompassing storm. The cast is amazing. It's a great stylish noir at the start. It's dark. It's creepy. It has a very weird vibe. There is a twist and it's very unsatisfying. I was buying into the movie but it pulls the rug from under me. It feels like the writer cheated and breaks any connection from the first half. I won't even comment on any believability or reasonableness of the twist. It was well on its way to a great movie. It's a small disappointment of what could have been.
Captain America: The Winter Soldier,8,0,2,1 April 2015," Good variation on the comic book movie
",Steve Rogers (Chris Evans) is still trying adjust to the modern world. He befriends fellow soldier Sam Wilson (Anthony Mackie) who later becomes Falcon. He goes on a mission to rescue hostages but Black Widow (Scarlett Johansson) is more interested in securing intel. He is angry at Nick Fury (Samuel L. Jackson) who is building an armada called Project Insight. Fury uncovers some secrets and is targeted by the mysterious Winter Soldier. He warns Captain America before being killed. Then Captain America is attacked by SHIELD after being questioned by Secretary Alexander Pierce (Robert Redford). Black Widow helps him investigate.This is a good movie whether it's a Marvel movie or a comic book movie. It's got some political espionage thrills. It takes the Marvel universe into darker territories. It advances the plot to an interesting place. The characters get room to move and grow. The action is great and doesn't overwhelm. It's more human-sized. It's a smart action thriller.
Capote,7,1,1,22 August 2015," great performances
","It's 1959. New Yorker writer Truman Capote (Philip Seymour Hoffman) hears about the horrifying murders in Kansas. He and his research assistant Nelle Harper Lee (Catherine Keener) go to write about the crime. Harper Lee gets published. They befriend lead detective Alvin Dewey (Chris Cooper). Then Perry Smith (Clifton Collins Jr.) and Dick Hickock (Mark Pellegrino) are arrested. As Truman digs into the story, he decides to write a new kind of book 'In Cold Blood'.It's an amazing performance from PSH which is only rivaled by a close second from CCJ. Catherine Keener is solid and it's a bit of a shock for novices like me to find Harper Lee working for Capote at that time. It's not a terribly dramatic story but it is a great showcase for the actors. It's worthy Oscar win for PSH."
Life of Pi,8,1,4,9 November 2013," Ang Lee films the unfilmable
","Director Ang Lee adapts the interesting Yann Martel novel. Considering all the big name directors previously attached to the project, he does an admirable job bringing this unfilmable movie to the big screen.Pi Patel lives his childhood in Pondicherry, India with his zoo owning family. Eventually they had to sell their animals to the west, and move to Canada. They travel on a Japanese freighter with the animals. The ship sinks and Pi gets to a lifeboat with a menagerie of animals including a Bengal tiger named Richard Parker.Much has been said of the great CG animals. I don't need to add more to that. The lifeboat scenes look great. Ang Lee has filmed the unfilmable. I do wish the island be more otherworldly to clue in the unrealism of the story. And the island had a more religious overtone in the book which is missing here.I also wish they filmed the real lifeboat with the people characters. A visual depiction would be much more dramatic. The violence could be cut out if they needed to keep the PG rating. In fact the ratings might be why they decided to reduce that section to a simple narration."
Over the Top,4,0,1,21 July 2018," cheese
","Accepting the wishes of his sick ex-wife (Susan Blakely), truck driver Lincoln Hawk (Sylvester Stallone) tries to reconnect with his son Mike after a ten year absence. The grandfather Jason Cutler (Robert Loggia) had put the boy in military school and prevented Lincoln from contacting him. Lincoln is a legendary arm wrestling champ and a struggling truck driver. The grandfather works to gain custody after his daughter death. I don't like the kid. A bratty kid is a well accepted trope but one that has never been my favorite. It's not like he's cute either. Annoying cute kids can be funny. This kid is basic annoyance. Stallone is restricted in their relationship. I'm not loving him either. It's unreasonable for him to crash his truck through the gate. He hasn't shown himself to be a violent man. It would be better if the guards start a fight which he ends by crashing his truck. It muddles up the moral superior position. It's also pretty cheesy although some may find some fun with the cheese. If you're one, then enjoy."
Ocean's Thirteen,6,1,1,30 May 2014," At least they're back in Vegas
","This one starts with Reuben Tishkoff (Elliott Gould) in the hospital with everybody coming together around him. Then it goes back 4 weeks earlier. Reuben was afraid of being old and tried to build a hotel with Willy Bank (Al Pacino). Only he got double crossed by Bank and suffered a heart attack. Six months later, the hotel is finished and Bank is looking to get a five diamond award for his hotel. The gang comes up with a plan uniting with old enemy Terry Benedict (Andy Garcia) to take revenge by taking away his hotel.Steven Soderbergh and the gang have returned. The good news is that they're back in Vegas where this franchise belongs. The plan is as convoluted as ever. It's slightly better than Twelve, but the original excitement can never be recapture. This is more star gazing than anything else."

",Faded movie star Bob Harris (Bill Murray) is in Tokyo to shot whiskey commercials. He's getting $2 million to endorse the whiskey. He's married for 25 years with kids. Charlotte (Scarlett Johansson) is in Tokyo with her photographer husband John (Giovanni Ribisi) of 2 years. He's constant working and she feels lost. She's a recent philosophy graduate. She finds a fellow lost soul in Bob at the hotel bar. They both have difficulty sleeping.Sofia Coppola made a gentle beautiful movie. Scarlett is dressed down a little and she looks gorgeous. Then there is Bill Murray. He's having some fun and making little wisecracks. It's not anything terribly big. I love the hospital scene mostly because of the two Japanese women behind him. It is surprising how much of the movie is the two leads apart. They work well together.

The king and queen launch lighted floating lanterns every year on the baby's birthday. As she grows into a teenager, Rapunzel pines for the outside world. Bandit Flynn Ryder is on the run from the authorities. He tries to hide in the tower, and Rapunzel hits him with a frying pan. She makes a deal to release him if he guides her to the floating lights that she sees on her birthday every year.I like the story, and I like the two lead characters. They're cute and funny together. The animation looks pretty. I just wish they have a comedic third wheel that isn't a voiceless chameleon. I wish they have a good comedian to bring some outlandish joking around. I also wish the tunes were catchier. Little kids should be singing it in the car to annoy the parents. They've got a singer in Mandy Moore, but they don't have a good song for her to sing. Nevertheless, it's pretty fun little comedy."
Doctor Strange,8,5,7,6 May 2017," solid introduction
","New York neurosurgeon Doctor Stephen Strange (Benedict Cumberbatch) is brilliant and arrogant. His only friend is ex-love ER doctor Christine Palmer (Rachel McAdams). He gets into a car wreck damaging his hands. He is told about Jonathan Pangborn (Benjamin Bratt) who recovered from unrecoverable spinal damage. He is directed to Kamar-Taj. He finds The Ancient One (Tilda Swinton) and Master Mordo (Chiwetel Ejiofor) who teach him about the astral plane and the infinite dimensions. Kaecilius (Mads Mikkelsen) is a former disciple of the Ancient One and has fallen under the influence of Dormammu of the Dark Dimension.This is the latest of the Marvel Cinematic Universe. Dr. Strange adds the strange side to the comic book franchise. Cumberbatch fills out the role. Every role is well cast. Even Tilda Swinton seems fitting in the otherworldly role. The CGI is brilliant. It is Inception plus. The battles are compelling without being confusing. Surprisingly, there is also humor. This is a solid addition to the MCU."
We Are Marshall,6,1,1,25 January 2015," more of a tribute
","It's 1970. After a tough lose, the Marshall University football team is returning home to Huntington, W.V. The plane crashes killing everyone on board. Injured Nate Ruffin (Anthony Mackie) didn't play and Red Dawson (Matthew Fox) takes a last-minute recruiting trip. Both misses the plane ride and survives. Cheerleader Annie Cantrell (Kate Mara) loses her boyfriend. The next spring, the town is struggling and football is about to be suspended. Ruffin rallies the students. President Don Dedman (David Strathairn) struggles to find anyone to coach and Jack Lengyel (Matthew McConaughey) applies out of the nowhere.Director McG is more restraint visually than normal although he isn't pulling anything back with the sentimental melodrama. This is all played with every heart string at the highest note filled with every cliché. Considering the subject, there is probably no other way to make this. My one main complaint is that the movie needs one lead character to focus on. However, I also do understand the need to spread the commiseration around. The acting is solid and flamboyant McConaughey injects a bit of energy. The film has that sepia tone to heighten the 70s look and McG fills it with era music. The movie is a fully formed tribute but not necessarily a great movie."
Barry Lyndon,5,3,9,24 February 2015," beautiful and slow
","It's the 18th Century Ireland. Redmond Barry's father is killed in a duel over a horse. Barry (Ryan O'Neal) falls for his cousin Nora Brady but she gets engaged to English Captain John Quin. Barry shoots him in a duel and runs away to join the army. He finds out that the duel was set up by the Brady family and Quin isn't actually dead. Barry fights in the Seven Years' War. He deserts and is later forced to join the Prussian Army. He is rewarded for saving Captain Potzdorf. He is brought in to verify if Irishman gambler Chevalier de Balibari is actually a spy. The two men escape and become gambling associates. He eventually marries the wealthy Lady Lyndon. With her wealth and his new name, he returns to England. His need to gain acceptance in high society is rebuffed by his stepson Charles. His son Bryan with Lady Lyndon dies and he is devastated.Stanley Kubrick is meticulous and masterful. Every scene is perfected to his requirements. It's a beautiful piece of art but not necessarily a compelling movie. The Michael Hordern narration keeps droning on and on. The pace is incredibly slow. Barry Lyndon is not likable or very compelling. Ryan O'Neal is mostly lifeless in this mannered costume drama. That's not to say that there isn't any drama or emotional content. The movie doesn't take full adventure of the story. The lead character just doesn't come to life. The constant dueling is a little bit funny but it doesn't do enough to excite the whole 3 hours. The last duel with Bullingdon is just terrific but it doesn't make the whole movie."
Interstellar,7,2,3,25 June 2015," some problems but a few great touches of 2001
","In the near future, Earth is devastated by blight where corn is the only surviving crop. Joseph Cooper (Matthew McConaughey) is a former astronaut pilot who has turned to farming like everybody else. He and his daughter Murph find an underground NASA site run by Dr. John Brand (Michael Caine). Brand calculates that the blight will wipe out mankind in a generation. He is working on plans to save humanity after wormholes have been discovered leading to other worlds. Coop goes on a mission with Brand's daughter Dr. Amelia Brand (Anne Hathaway), Romilly and Doyle. However the mission runs into problems of relativity and sabotage. Meanwhile Murph (Jessica Chastain) grows up and tries to finish the calculations by Brand.I have problems with the setup to this movie. The idea that everybody needs to turn into farmers seems laughable. There are all kinds of problems with the start. The blight seems to be a catch-all for Nolan to use as a tool to explain away whatever he needs. It's inelegant and clunky. Apparently, science is not necessary anymore in this world. It's not like this dystopian world has run out of oil. A lot of it seems unlikely.Once McConaughey goes up into space, the movie gets better. It has touches of 2001 but generally, it is more like 2010. There are still some problems with unlikely human reactions. The whole conflict between Tom and Murph seems overblown. It's trying to up the drama without setting it up properly. I like McConaughey's side of the story. I would have preferred to stay mostly with him and lose some of Chastain's. I'm afraid the time relativity ideas may be lost on some of the audience. Even the best parts of the movie do have some nagging questions. It is still an awesome movie despite its problems. Although, I thought he might turn into a space baby at the end."
Full Metal Jacket,9,0,1,29 May 2015," one of the most compelling war movies
","In Parris Island, South Carolina, a group of raw recruits are brought in to be trained by the hard-nosed Marine Gunnery Sergeant Hartman. Joker (Matthew Modine) tries to help the slow Leonard Lawrence (Vincent D'Onofrio) which comes to a sad end. The second half starts with Joker in Da Nang working as a reporter for Stars and Stripes. Then the Tet offensive happens and Joker goes out to report. He's reunited with Cowboy (Arliss Howard) who is leading a rifle squad.The first half is anchored by the great performances of R. Lee Ermey and Vincent D'Onofrio. They are incredible. The second half is the war. Matthew Modine leads competently but it is the mesmerizing directions from Stanley Kubrick. It is always The Trashmen's Surfin' Bird that comes to mind first. It's impossible to lose interest during the second half. Some people may want it to be more obviously anti-war. It is not quite so blatant. It is murky just like what I imagine the Vietnam experience actually was. The long uncut scenes impart an immersive feel. It is one of the most compelling extended war sequence."
"Three Billboards Outside Ebbing, Missouri",6,5,7,18 March 2018," so many issues
","In the town of Ebbing, Missouri, Mildred Hayes (Frances McDormand) rents three billboards on an isolated road to berate police chief Willoughby (Woody Harrelson) for his failure to find her daughter's killer. Willoughby is actually dying from cancer and the town ostracizes her. Dixon (Sam Rockwell) is a volatile racist deputy living with his overbearing mother.British Irish filmmaker Martin McDonagh tackles Americana. He has incorporated plenty of American issues but it's done as an outsider looking in. I wonder if Rockwell starts his performing with an American director, he wouldn't be told to take it a different way. His action in the middle of the movie is absolutely crazy. The aftermath needs more expanding rather than a simple firing. I can't believe that he's not locked up. Then his character takes a 180 turn as the movie climaxes. He leaves the movie a two dimensional billboard rather than a fully formed human character. I am much more impressed with Mildred, Willoughby, and their connection. McDormand delivers a driven character of the first order and Harrelson is more human in his reservation. There is real power behind their performances whereas Rockwell is doing a cartoon. I am surprised at its critical love. Some of this is funny and there are plenty of intriguing characters. The issues are so important that I can't take this as satire. I have issues."
The Grapes of Wrath,9,1,1,31 December 2015," American icon
","Tom Joad (Henry Fonda) hitchhikes back to his family's farm in Oklahoma after getting released from prison. He finds his family gone after the landowner kicked out all the small farmers moving in the bulldozers and tractors. He and ex-preacher Jim Casy (John Carradine) go to his uncle John's place. The Joad family decides to travel to California. It's a long arduous journey.This John Ford epic is an American classic. It has some funny moments, tough social injustices and loads of heart-breaking stories. Ford delivers some beautiful destitution. It is more the human story that is so powerful. Henry Fonda does a great everyman which allows the audience to feel for the family right away."
Star Wars: Episode IX - The Rise of Skywalker,6,8,18,27 December 2019," wrap it up and move on
","The Empire is in chaos. There is a pretender on the throne. A new rebellion is banished to the Outer Rim. The Empire is re-establishing control with yet another Order. At least, it's not another Death Star. It's Disney Plus spaceships with guns. The Mouse Empire muddles on. The new trilogy is simply not planned out. That is its major flaw above all else. This final chapter tries to take back a few story elements and wrap up the story with a bow. It is not to be dissected for plot holes or logic flaws. It rushes to push the franchise across the finish line. It works to some extend and it doesn't cause any more major troubles. Most fans would probably be satisfied with reaching the finish line and not having any more movies for awhile.Nobody is a somebody. A shocking reveal happens and it barely clears the bar. There are plenty of problems and an Orphan Black situation. Like many elements in this movie, one should not think too hard about it. Remember Tom Cruise's War of the Worlds. This one does something even crazier with its spaceships. This is the stupidest part of the plot but let's roll our eyes and move on. The plot is basically getting the MacGuffin to get another MacGuffin. The film is running on double time and the speed seems to be used to hide from story questions. Everybody is rushing. History is being revised. No one is throwing away a light saber in this one. Finn never actually say the thing to Rey. It is emotionally safe. I thought they would keep Carrie Fisher in the first act but they dragged her out there for too long. I won't say that it's disrespectful but it is a little awkward. Overall, this one tries to quickly wrap up the story in a fan friendly way and the last person turns out the lights."
Pacific Rim,8,1,5,27 December 2013," Fun Robots fighting Monsters
","A trans-world rip at the bottom of the Pacific Ocean has allowed monsters, named Kaiju, to come into our world. After tremendous losses, the world got together to build massive robots called Jaegers. However, the monsters keep coming, faster and bigger. Now the Jaegers are stretched to the limit with resources being diverted to building a wall.Director Guillermo del Toro is having a lot of boyhood fun with robots battling monsters. It doesn't get more childhood fun than this. The designs are beautiful and original with both the robots and monsters. There is nothing more youth affirming than playing with these toys. The characters are solid with interesting actors like Charlie Hunnam and Idris Elba. Coming into this, I feared the story would be too silly or convoluted. The story makes perfect sense and the action cannot be beat."
Empire of the Sun,7,0,3,1 September 2015," well made Spielberg
","While Japan is conquering China, foreigners live in the Shanghai International Settlement oblivious to the suffering. Jamie Graham (Christian Bale) is a spoiled British upper class schoolboy. In the chaos of the Japanese taking Shanghai, Jamie's parents lose him in the crowd. He goes home to find his servants stealing the valuables. He is found by Basie (John Malkovich) and Frank Demarest (Joe Pantoliano) who are also stranded in Shanghai. He is taken to an assembly center along with Basie who teaches him how to survive. In the camp, Jamie lives with the Victors.Spielberg is a master of a child's wonderment. That's what he does here. Despite the movie's subject matter, it never gets to be truly disturbing or ugly. He always pulls back a little earning its PG rating. Jamie can be an annoying spoiled brat. At times, he seems to be deliberately dense. Christian Bale does an amazing acting job. It is a wonderfully shot movie. Although it may not get the perfect sense of the reality."
American Sniper,7,4,16,8 December 2015," skillfully made by Eastwood
","Chris Kyle (Bradley Cooper) and his brother are raised by their hard-nosed father to be sheepdogs defending against the wolves of the world. They are weekend rodeo cowboys. After watching the African embassies bombings, Chris signs up for the SEALs and meets Taya Renae (Sienna Miller) at a bar. They get married and he goes off to Iraq as a sniper. On his first tour in Falluja, he kills a kid with a grenade. He returns on multiple tours and facing a skilled Olympian sniper called Mustafa.The war action is quite tense. Clint Eastwood's years of experience have laid the foundations. This is skillfully made despite the fake baby. The biggest pet peeve is these guys chatting on patrol which obviously leads to an explosive attack. It's a bit of a trope. Chris' private life is well shown but his closed off nature is not always the most compelling drama. It also hits a little too much on the head sometimes. For example, he's talking to Taya on the phone when a battle explodes around him. It's an interesting but overwrought scene when it happens the first time but the movie returns to the well again. This is a very much heroic portrait which may annoy certain people. As a movie, it mostly works well."
Glory,9,2,4,29 October 2013," Great glorious movie
","Robert Gould Shaw (Matthew Broderick) is the son of a wealthy Boston abolitionist family. He signs up for war at 23, and suffers through a harrowing battle at Antietam. After the 'victory' at Antietam, the Union organizes the first company of black soldiers. Shaw would lead them into battle and history.The scale of the battles is impressive. It's a big production from director Edward Zwick. It is expertly put together. The acting is top rate from great actors. Broderick imparts a blend of hopefulness and pragmatism. He's a boy trying to live up to being a man with historic responsibilities. Morgan Freeman gives this movie weight, and Denzel Washington gives the big money shot.It's easy to nitpick this movie to death. By quoting directly from Shaw's letters, it lends itself to criticism of its factual reliability. But that would miss the point of the movie. It's not a documentary."
The Devil Wears Prada,7,1,3,4 October 2013," Great performances in standard fare
","Andy Sachs (Anne Hathaway) is a recent journalism graduate hoping for a job at an important news outlet. She gets hired by the ruthless Miranda Priestly (Meryl Streep) editor of Runway fashion magazine. Only she feels the magazine is beneath her high minded journalism. Emily Blunt plays Miranda's long suffering assistant, and Stanley Tucci plays her longtime second in command.Of course Andy learns some lessons, grows in character, and faces a choice. The story is pretty standard loosely based on Anna Wintour editor of Vogue. The big plus is the great performances from all three ladies. Emily Blunt is funny. Meryl Streep nails her performance. And Anne Hathaway is great at holding the screen with these powerful performances."
Rocky II,8,2,3,27 June 2014," Stallone is perfecting the 80s action formula
",This starts with the end of the first movie. Apollo Creed (Carl Weathers) wins the fight. Both he and Rocky Balboa (Sylvester Stallone) are sent to the hospital. Rocky wants to retire. Apollo wants a rematch. Rocky marries Adrian (Talia Shire). Rocky spends all his money and can't find another job. He's back to hauling meat. Adrian is pregnant. Rocky loses his job. He reconnects with trainer Mickey (Burgess Meredith) trying to fight again but his right eye is no good anymore. Apollo is under public pressure and personal pride for a rematch. Apollo starts taunting Rocky until he agrees to a fight.It's more of a prototype of the 80s action movie. Stallone is perfecting the formula here. The pace is faster. The slower 70s style of the original is being squeezed. The training is lined up. Rocky is even chasing chickens. The fight is longer and better shot. This time is all Stallone and he does it without sacrificing the emotional content. He is a true renaissance man.
Star Wars: Episode II - Attack of the Clones,6,1,2,27 February 2016," bad dialog but love Kamino
","The Republic is threatened as Count Dooku (Christopher Lee) agitates for a rebellion. Senator Padmé Amidala (Natalie Portman) arrives at Coruscant to vote on the creation of the Army of the Republic. After an assassination attempt, Anakin Skywalker (Hayden Christensen) is assigned to protect Padmé. They haven't seen each other in 10 years. Obi-Wan Kenobi (Ewan McGregor) traces the attacks to bounty hunter Jango Fett and the hidden water planet Kamino.This dialog is horribly flat. It's not simply the stilted awkward romance. The expositions are all done in tired uninteresting way. There is a lot of walking-and-talking and sitting in a circle. It is all terrible and I would suggest fast-forwarding several sections of the movie.On the other hand, the CGI continues to be great. The best is Kamino. That world is sci-fi heaven. I love the aliens. I love Jango Fett and Anakin is nowhere to be found. McGregor gets to leave behind that dead weight. I also like the Blade-Runner-like lower levels of Coruscant although that bar should have been a lot seedier. It has too much of a sports bar feel. The coliseum is good and who doesn't love that outfit on Portman. There is plenty of fun action in this movie but it needs a better writer to punch up the dialog."
Corpse Bride,6,0,1,11 October 2013," Great Tim Burton Look
","Victor Van Dort and Victoria Everglot are arranged to be married. The Van Dorts need the social status. The Everglots are broke and need the new money even if it smells like fish. The regimented rehearsal wedding goes terribly wrong. Victor goes off to practice his vows. When he places his ring on the finger of a corpse, he finds himself married to the deceased Emily, and he is transported to the world of the dead.The Tim Burton stop-motion animation is impeccable. The real world is very grey, and the dead world is colorful. It starts off in a horribly stuffy ugly world that looks very tired. The lead is a meek guy. It looks interesting but the story isn't that compelling.The dead world looks much more imaginative. It's definitely much more colorful. I didn't particular care for any of the songs. They all sound like Broadway rejects. I didn't like any of the characters, but I didn't find them that compelling to hate either. I certainly wouldn't want to stay in the dead world. It wasn't even a close call since Victoria seems to be such a sweetheart.However I've got to give it credit for it's great Tim Burton style. And the characters have that weird Tim Burton sense and sensibility. It's a better movie to see than to follow as a story."
Lion,7,4,6,16 July 2017," harrowing first half
","It's 1986. Saroo and his brother Guddu steal coal from passing trains. Their mother is an illiterate laborer. The family scraps by in rural India. Guddu leaves Saroo sleeping at the train station for night work. Saroo wakes up and stumbles into an empty train. He find himself trapped as the train travels 1600 miles to Calcutta. He is alone in the city and unable to speak the local dialect. He escapes the scary streets and gets taken to a Dickensian orphanage. He is adopted by Sue (Nicole Kidman) and John Brierley (David Wenham) from Tasmania. Twenty years later, he moves to Melbourne to study hotel management and starts a relationship with Lucy (Rooney Mara). Friends suggest using Google Earth to pinpoint his lost home town.The first half with young Saroo is a harrowing journey. The nightmarish streets are closer to the horror genre. It's a very compelling story. The kid is undeniable. Once he leaves for Australia, the story slows down. There are some compelling aspects but it falters when compared to the first half. That imbalance leaves the movie wanting. Maybe it's possible to add more flashbacks into the second half."
Romeo + Juliet,6,0,0,26 December 2014," overwhelming Baz Luhrmann style
",Baz Luhrmann injects his brash style into Shakespeare's famous play. It's the modern world in a place called Verona. The two families of Capulets and Montagues are powerful corporate giants with gun totting thugs. Claire Danes plays Juliet Capulet and Leonardo DiCaprio plays Romeo Montague. There is no doubt that this is one of the more unique interpretations. Luhrmann throws every visual flashiness at the audience. He's pumped up the material with so many bells and whistles that the story feels overwhelmed. The music choice sometimes grades on my nerves. The leads are an adorable pairing. I wish Luhrmann has some more faith in the actors to allow them some peace and quiet to do their work. They do good work in the balconey scene but Luhrmann can't stop moving. The flash and glitz becomes more of a distraction.
Forrest Gump,8,5,8,15 November 2013," Tale worthy of Frank Capra
","Forrest Gump (Tom Hanks) is a simple man with a sweet heart. It's his journey through American history. His childhood friend Jenny (Robin Wright) would travel the underbelly flipside of the same world. His journey is heavily influenced by his mama (Sally Field), Lieutenant Dan (Gary Sinise), and Bubba Blue (Mykelti Williamson).Director Robert Zemeckis has added another chapter to the American mythos. It is a magical tale where the good guys win out. That you can rise to the top no matter what handicap you have. That a good heart will enlighten all it touches. It is a tale worthy of Frank Capra.If I could have a wish, it is a deeper meaning to Gump's journey. For example, he's given a chance to comment on the Vietnam war but the sound goes out of his mike. I would have like to hear what he had to say. But that might have been asking too much. More than anything, Gump is not controversial."
The Passion of Joan of Arc,7,2,5,11 March 2015," compelling closeup acting
","I watched the Criterion Collection from an original found in a Norwegian mental institution in 1981. The condition of the film looks crisp and perfect. It is based on the trial transcript of Joan of Arc. The film starts with Joan in prison. The religious authorities question and berate the young girl. They bring her to the torture chamber. At the breaking point, the priest guide her hand in signing a confession. She is eventually burnt at the stake. Renée Jeanne Falconetti stars as Joan. Her big eyes glow with passion. She is a bit old to play the teen martyr. Otherwise, this is an impressive acting performance from the silent era. The constant use of closeups is quite compelling. It's almost a piece of painting or art."
Gone Baby Gone,8,0,1,21 June 2014," good murky crime drama
","It's a lower class Boston neighborhood. There's a little girl missing and her mother is Helene McCready (Amy Ryan). Lionel (Titus Welliver) and Bea McCready (Amy Madigan) hire P.I. couple Patrick Kenzie (Casey Affleck) and Angie Gennaro (Michelle Monaghan) to find her. They normally don't do these types of cases. However the case isn't all that simple. Helene is a drug addict. Police captain Jack Doyle (Morgan Freeman) is in charge and doesn't care for the newbies. Remy Bressant (Ed Harris) and Nick Poole (John Ashton) are the cops running the case. Soon they discover that Helene had ripped off a drug dealer named Cheese.Ben Affleck has a real eye and ear for these characters. This is a good murky crime drama. Better still, Casey Affleck gives a real break out performance. Amy Ryan is just as good as the white trash mother character. I'm only disappointed with Michelle Monaghan. She's a little stiff and couldn't dig deeper than what's on the surface. I wish they let her pull a knife at least. I like that the story isn't a straight line. The story takes a break in the middle and it has some good twists."
"Monsters, Inc.",7,0,1,27 October 2013," Less than Toy Story Better than Most
","Monsters generate energy by scaring kids. That's what Monsters Inc is. James P. Sullivan (John Goodman) is the top scarer, and Mike Wazowski (Billy Crystal) is his best friend. Together they work at Monsters Inc. One night after work, Sully opens a door by himself and a child sneaks in threatening contamination.The characters are fun. But this is Paxar. So I expect nothing less than the best. That means comparing to Toy Story. I like the Toy Story characters much better, and there are more of them. Monsters Inc basically has two big likable characters. Quite frankly, the kid is more annoying than cute and the odd monsters wear thin. We all have the toys in Toy Story but the monster aren't as nostalgic.The animation looks good for its time. It's certainly not ground breaking as Toy Story (1995) was. It's better than Toy Story by a small degree but we haven't reached a new level yet."
The Lost City of Z,7,0,0,20 January 2018," beautiful but meanders
","It's 1905 Ireland. Major Percy Fawcett (Charlie Hunnam) with no medals is snubbed for his unfortunate choice of ancestors. He eagerly accepts the Royal Geographical Society's mission to map a river in the amazon to calm the near-warring Bolivia and Brazil. He leaves behind his wife Nina (Sienna Miller) and young children. He is joined by Henry Costin (Robert Pattinson). The group guided by a former slave native finds evidences of civilization in the jungle. Percy returns to ridicule for his claim of a lost city of Z. James Murray (Angus Macfadyen) is one of his few supporters who joins him on the next expedition. Murray turns out to be an incompetent coward who sabotages the quest and demeans him upon return to London. He is dismissed by everyone including his angry son Jack. After being temporarily blinded by a heroic action in WWI, he returns to England vindicated and his son Jack (Tom Holland) convinces him to lead one final quest for his lost amazonian city.There are some beautiful scenes. The quest is a personal epic. The acting is fine. At its best, the river journey is Apocalypse Now. The story does meander since there are actually three journeys. The back and forth keeps the flow disjointed. My favorite parts are all in the Amazon. The native in the first quest is compelling. The second is Murray's cowardice. The third is the native warriors. I almost wish for a fictionalization with one simple journey."

He is getting harassed by upstart Miguel Escobar. They fight in the lobby and one of Miguel's men shoots Maureen killing her. Billy is distraught. Facing a financial squeeze, manager Jordan Mains (50 Cent) convinces him to fight. He loses and gets suspended. He also loses daughter Leila to Child Services. He seeks help from trainer Tick Wills (Forest Whitaker).Jake Gyllenhaal gives it his all but he's overwhelmed by an overloaded Kurt Sutter script. He has more tragic turns than Job. Granted, it is almost entirely his doing which only makes Billy more infuriating. He's a meathead which doesn't necessarily fit Gyllenhaal. Gyllenhaal does get his anger. He throws everything and the kitchen sink at this character. So does director Antoine Fuqua. There is no denying the power from the pairing of Fuqua and Gyllenhaal. The script overload may be exactly the wrong idea for the duo."

His protégé Darren Cross (Corey Stoll) has revived his research against his wishes and creates the Yellowjacket, a shrinking suit. With his daughter Hope (Evangeline Lilly) on the inside, Hank tries to stop Darren. Meanwhile, thief Scott Lang (Paul Rudd) gets out of San Quentin after three years. He's desperate to be good for his daughter but can't hold onto any legal work. His crime partner Luis (Michael Peña) gets him a job to break into a safe. He's surprised to find only a strange outfit in the safe. Pym sees him as the perfect candidate for Ant-Man.This is a great refreshing smaller size superhero movie. The world isn't ending and yet the stakes feel big. Michael Peña is funny. Paul Rudd is great. His relationship with his daughter is lovely. I love Michael Douglas. It would be amazing if he continues in the universe. The shrinking is terrific. The humor is good although I find one moment awkward. Hank is having a tough conversation with Hope about her mother and Scott puts a comedic button on the scene. In general, this superhero movie has plenty of heart, fun and adventure."

","Schmidt (Jonah Hill) and Jenko (Channing Tatum) are a couple of underperforming cops. Their Captain Dickson (Ice Cube) sends them back to high school to go undercover as students to crack a drug ring.This is an re-imagining of the 80s TV show. Unlike many others who try to remake 80s show, this one is actually funny, and joyous. They have great chemistry, and are hilarious together. Surprisingly, Channing Tatum does have some comedic chops. His timing is quite good. Jonah Hill is a great partner. Ice Cube does an intimidating Captain without losing likability. In fact, I think everybody is having a good fun time, and I think it shows."

She has a crush on her boss Daniel Cleaver (Hugh Grant) at the London publisher. She begins a relationship with him despite his womanizing past. It goes bad and she quits. She gets a spot as a TV reporter which results in some usual reporting. Darcy gets claimed by lawyer colleague Natasha (Embeth Davidtz). Darcy and Cleaver were once best friends but an affair with Darcy's wife have made them enemies. She bounces back and forth between Darcy and Cleaver. All the while, Bridget's parents' marriage is in trouble.Renée Zellweger is adorably awkward. She does some tough work transforming herself into a chubby Brit. I'm sure a real Brit would probably work better but Zellweger does a good job. Also there is a question of exactly how chubby she really is. The movie tries to accentuate her weight but she's never not adorable. The story is fun and sitcomy. It has its own heart especially with her father played by Jim Broadbent. It has two dashing male leads and all the angsty love triangle fun in the world."
Captain America: The First Avenger,7,1,3,25 January 2014," Like Chris Evans and Hayley Atwell
","During World War II, Steve Rogers (Chris Evans) is a 90lb weakling who keeps getting rejected for military services. Then Dr. Erskine (Stanley Tucci) sees his potential and recruits him for his secret scientific program where he encounters Peggy Carter (Hayley Atwell) and Colonel Phillips (Tommy Lee Jones). Rogers undergoes an experiment that makes him a new super soldier. Meanwhile the Nazis have invest heavily in a secret weapons research agency called HYDRA. Only the head of HYDRA Johann Schmidt (Hugo Weaving) has bigger goals and his own ambitions.I really like the skinny Chris Evans even thought it's odd to hear his voice coming out. He and Hayley Atwell have good chemistry before and after the transformation. Their relationship is better than the usual comic book movie. As far as the action goes, it's all very CGI. That's not unexpected. However the cartoon nature and the overuse of montages really takes away much of the tension. After a good first half, the second half gets into a rambling flow of jagged story telling. Even the climax lacks the needed excitement. This ends more as a setup for future sequels."
American Hustle,7,2,4,15 April 2014," Good movie with a lot of flashy acting
","Fictionalized real story of the Abscam scandal. It starts in 1978 with FBI agent Richie DiMaso (Bradley Cooper) using con-man Irving Rosenfeld (Christian Bale) and his partner Sydney Prosser (Amy Adams) to catch corrupt politicians. Irving is unhappily married to Rosalyn (Jennifer Lawrence). Eventually they set their sights on Carmine Polito (Jeremy Renner), the big New Jersey political operator.Director David O. Russell has gathered his gang of actors to wow us with a lot of flash. It's a lot of big acting moments, wild characterizations, era music, and crazy get-ups. There is a fascinating story beneath it all. All the flash makes the story look superficial when it's not. However the flash makes it fun."
Top Secret!,7,0,1,22 January 2016," almost as good as Airplane!
","Nick Rivers (Val Kilmer) is a big star of the gun-happy surfer culture with his smash hit Skeet Surfing. He goes to East Germany to play at a festival. He comes to help resistance member Hillary Flammond on the run. He is imprisoned and beaten. He manages to escape to a secret lab with Hillary's father Dr. Paul Flammond who is forced to develop a secret weapon against submarines.The team of Jim Abrahams, David Zucker and Jerry Zucker follow their highly successful Airplane! with this spoof of a Presley and spy movie. It has the same sense of irreverent fun. Val Kilmer is pretty good but there is nobody equivalent to Leslie Nielsen in this movie. Also going back to Elvis Presley from the 60s is not as immediate as the disaster movies that were still in the conversation of the day. Overall, it's a fun little film."
Incendies,8,0,2,6 September 2015," epic Greek tragedy
","Twins Simon and Jeanne Marwan are given instructions at the reading of their mother's Will. They are to deliver letters to their father and a brother they know nothing about. Simon dismisses their mother's weird wishes but Jeanne decides to discover the truth. In Lebanon, their Christian mother Nawal Marwan had an affair with Arab Wahab. Her family killed Wahab. Her grandma saved the pregnant Nawal. The baby was given to a mysterious woman. Narwal would go off to look for him.Director Denis Villeneuve delivers some compelling images. It's a dark murky tale of religion and family set in the middle of a sectarian war. There is a point in the middle where the story double down and make this a true Greek Tragedy. I have a small problem with the dying nurse telling the twins about the babies born in prison. They should be able to figure that part out by themselves. The last half is stretched out a bit. By the midway point, I wish the movie picks up the pace to get to the big reveal. Nevertheless, this is a brilliant tragedy."
The Godfather: Part II,9,1,4,28 November 2013," Michael takes over
","The saga continues with Michael Corleone (Al Pacino) fully in charge as the unflinching leader. The family drama just gets more and more darker. We are seeing the moral disintegration of Michael. The movie also gets a separate timeline for young Vito Corleone (Robert De Niro). While that is interesting at times, it is very disruptive especially since it's all in Italian.Meanwhile, Michael's story keeps getting better. How could you forget 'I know it was you, Freddo. you broke my heart.' or 'Keep your friends close, and your enemies closer.' And John Cazale shines as Fredo. His exchanges with Al Pacino are epic. And the emotional grenade tossed by Kay (Diane Keaton) is absolutely stunning. All in all, it is a great effort for a sequel to a masterpiece."
The Bourne Ultimatum,7,0,0,5 October 2014," Shaky camera got to me a little
","Jason Bourne (Matt Damon) is once again on the loose. After losing his love Marie in the second movie, he is now trying to uncover his past and find those who started it. Reporter Simon Ross (Paddy Considine) is investigating him and operation Blackbriar which is the newer version of Project Treadstone. The CIA team under Noah Vosen (David Strathairn) is tracking him looking for the source of his information. Bourne also wants Ross' source but they kill Ross. Bourne is able to retrieve Ross' notes. The CIA director forces Vosen to take Pam Landy (Joan Allen) on the team. Bourne reconnects with tech Nicky Parsons (Julia Stiles).Director Paul Greengrass does everything within his powers to amp up the thrills. The chase with Ross is terrific and very tense. The action is great. Even the control room is filled with energy. However the control room gives a diminishing return. It get a little bit repetitive. There is only so much that can be done with people looking at computer screens. Greengrass is known for his shaky camera work but this is going a little overboard. Sometimes, I lose some of the action. Other times, there is no real reason to do the shaky camera. He just needs to give me a few more quiet breaks so that I can catch a breather. On the acting side, there is only generally good work. It's yet another solid performance from Matt Damon and David Strathairn is a strong addition."
10 Things I Hate About You,7,0,0,4 February 2015," Shakespeare's teen rom-com
","Kat Stratford (Julia Stiles) is a hard girl to like. Cameron James (Joseph Gordon-Levitt) is a new student at Padua High in Seattle. Michael (David Krumholtz) befriends the newcomer. Cameron falls for Bianca Stratford (Larisa Oleynik) but her father Walter (Larry Miller) won't let her date until his daughters graduate. Then Walter changes the rule to allow Bianca to date when Kat does. Cameron intends to find somebody for Kat. Michael tricks Joey Donner (Andrew Keegan) to pay mysterious bad boy Patrick Verona (Heath Ledger) to take out Kat. It's basically William Shakespeare's teen rom-com 'The Taming of the Shrew'. It has enough wit and fun. On top of it all, there's the good young pretty cast. Stiles is a terrific high-minded B and Ledger is a great bad boy with a heart. It's all good fun."
Fargo,9,1,2,18 May 2014," Coen brothers' black comedy masterpiece
","The Coen brothers flash the based on true story disclaimer for a real 1987 Minnesota incident. It's one of the misdirections. Jerry Lundegaard (William H. Macy) hires two bumbling criminals Carl Showalter (Steve Buscemi) and Gaear Grimsrud (Peter Stormare) to kidnap his wife and force his hard father-in-law Wade Gustafson to pay the ransom. Jerry is miserable working for Wade in his car dealership and he's in desperate need for cash. The kidnapping goes horribly wrong when more people get killed including a police officer. Pregnant sheriff Marge Gunderson (Frances McDormand) goes to investigate.This is a great movie. It has its funny moments. It has great visual touches, the quirky characters, and the off-kilter style that is the hallmark of the Coen brothers. Macy is incredible as the sniffling little weasel. It walks the absurd line between dark and comedy. It has plenty of both. It is simply wonderful."
Rush,8,4,5,16 April 2014," Solid filmmaking from Ron Howard
","Based on the true story of the Formula 1 racing rivals brash English playboy James Hunt (Chris Hemsworth) and his tough methodical uncompromising opponent Austrian driver Niki Lauda (Daniel Brühl) during the 1970s.Director Ron Howard has great skills to put together a top notch movie. The racing action is exciting. The 70s style looks good. I love all the cars. Everybody is great in this. I do have two minor problems. I hate most narrations and this is no exception. It is good for exposition but mostly takes the audience out of the movie. However a narration from the real Niki Lauda at the end would be great.The other problem is more basic. The movie follows both drivers equally. Although it's filled with details from both men, it's not as easy to fully commit to either men. A more traditional structure would follow one protagonist and it would be a more compelling story. My personal preference would be to follow Hunt up to the Nürburgring Nordschleife race. Then they could go back to Niki Lauda's story from the beginning showing the other side of the story all the way to the end. That way it would minimize the back and forth and maximize the rooting interest. Nevertheless this is a very solid thrilling movie. It's compelling and well worth the praise that it gets."
Predator,8,3,4,21 November 2014," simple 80s action fun
","An alien pod lands on earth. Meanwhile, a special ops team is brought in to rescue a cabinet minister on a downed helicopter in a remote jungle rebel territory. CIA agent Dillon (Carl Weathers) calls in his friend Dutch (Arnold Schwarzenegger). Dutch's team usually works alone but Dillon insists on joining the group. As soon as they reach the crash site, it's obvious to Dutch that Dillon isn't giving them the whole truth. They find mutilated bodies of Green Berets hanging upside down. They attack the guerrilla compound and take Anna (Elpidia Carrillo) prisoner. However Russians with the guerrillas are the least of their problems.This is simple 80s action fun. It's got the prerequisite great campy lines but it's not only Arnold that gets to deliver those lines. Jesse Ventura has 'I ain't got time to bleed.' It's also a great start to the franchise. There is one thing that critics seem to miss at the time. The title of the movie is predator. The alien is a big game hunter. It's not a war or else the predator would just nuke the place. He skins the Green Berets like somebody on a safari. The plot is super simplistic. This is all fun and all action."
Notting Hill,8,0,2,13 September 2013," Rom-Com Royalty
","William Thacker (Hugh Grant) owns an unsuccessful Notting Hill bookstore in London. Anna Scott (Julia Roberts) is a movie star considered as the world's most beautiful woman.Of course, the movie Gods declare that these two must bump into each other and fall for each other. There must be trials and tribulations. There will hilarious moments at the expense of the awkward gaff prone Hugh Grant. Yes, we have rom-com royalty here. So this film is in safe hands. The story is safely traditional fare. It's been done before. But the rom-com gods commands it. If you like rom-coms, this is the safest bet you can place.Julia Roberts is the perfect movie star chased by the paparazzi. Rhys Ifans has some funny moments as the weird Spike. Hugh Grant is still at the top of his game playing that charming stuttering guy. The story has some heart from the sister character played by Gina McKee. It is a perfectly crafted rom-com."
Nightcrawler,8,1,2,4 June 2015," Crazy eyes
","Lou Bloom (Jake Gyllenhaal) is an unemployed petty thieve in L.A. He encounters Joe Loder (Bill Paxton) who is filming a car crash. He decides to get into the business of freelance videography for the local news. He is unrestrained in his filming which is exactly what news director Nina Romina (Rene Russo) needs to raise her low ratings. Desperate Rick answers his ad to be his assistant. This is great acting from Gyllenhaal. His crazy eyes pull in the audience right away. In fact, it's shocking to see his gaunt figure. His mannerisms are really creepy. The story is driven by this great performance and the tension never lets up."
Popstar: Never Stop Never Stopping,7,1,4,5 February 2018," neo-Spinal Tap
","It's the story of popstar Conner Friel (Andy Samberg). He started out in The Style Boyz with his childhood friends Owen and Lawrence. As they gain success, Conner and Lawrence end their collaboration. Owen is push to the side as Conner becomes superstar Conner4real.This is more Spinal Tap than I expected. I expected a satire of Justin Bieber instead. I hoped for some peeing in a bucket. There isn't anything as memorable as 11 but I do like the character. I like the journey and ultimately the friendship. There are some laughs and general fun overall. This is a solid addition to the mockumentary genre."
The Aviator,6,0,1,24 May 2015," gorgeous technically superior
","Howard Hughes (Leonardo DiCaprio) uses his Texas oil money to satisfy his obsession of making a realistic air war movie 'Hell's Angels'. He becomes romantically involved with actress Katharine Hepburn (Cate Blanchett). He has obsessive-compulsive disorder and is severely afraid of disease stemming from his mother. He brings his obsession to aviation and build an airline battling Juan Trippe (Alec Baldwin). His romance with Hepburn comes to end and he starts a new one with Ava Gardner (Kate Beckinsale).Martin Scorsese has given a technically superior movie. It is gorgeous like our imagination of what old Hollywood must have been. Hepburn is doing an impression. DiCaprio is a star. While the movie do a great recreation, it keeps its distance. It needs a gritty, non-pretty sense to dig into Hughes' dark obsessive side. This man is disturbed and the movie should be visually disturbing at certain times to bring that out."
Léon: The Professional,8,2,2,7 August 2014," Luc Besson style of violent action
","Léon (Jean Reno) is a milk-drinking illiterate hit-man for Italian mob boss Uncle Tony (Danny Aiello) in NYC with his favorite plant. His next door neighbor 12 year old Mathilda (Natalie Portman) has an abusive father (Michael Badalucco) who skimmed drugs off of Stansfield (Gary Oldman). Stansfield massacres the family. She comes home to find Stansfield's men still there. She fakes and walks over to Léon's. It turns out that they are corrupt DEA agents. Léon the cleaner reluctantly lets her in and she badgers him to teach her. She seeks revenge on his little brother's murderers.Director Luc Besson brings his often collaborator Jean Reno to America and makes a nice discovery with a young Natalie Portman. Before Hit-Girl, there was Mathilda. Gary Oldman is a superb strange bad guy. Luc Besson has a certain French flair with his action. He really has a unique take on the action thriller genre. It definitely has an edgy violent style that sometimes sexualized the young Portman. She takes on a lot of adult tendencies. That probably held it back a little back in the day."
Oblivion,6,1,4,19 August 2013," looks great but too many logic questions
","It's 2077. The Earth has been devastated after winning a war against aliens. Jack Harper (Tom Cruise) is a drone repairman living with Vika Olsen (Andrea Riseborough) on an isolated floating outpost. It's been five years since their mandatory memory wipe. Humanity has moved to Titan. The platform transforms water into fusion energy for the new home. Jack has to fight the reminent alien scavs. Despite the wipe, he has dreams of memories and collects relics from the past. He finds a crashed ship and revives Julia Rusakova (Olga Kurylenko) from status. They are captured by humans led by Malcolm Beech (Morgan Freeman).There is no denying that this movie looks great. I even like the wimpy sounds the machines make. Right from the start, things don't seem right. If this movie had any hope, the story must pass the smell test at the start. As Jack lays out the exposition, a dozen different questions come to my mind. The world doesn't make sense and it's annoying. Once the start doesn't make sense, then it's questionable why Jack can't see it. Even with a good reveal, not all the questions are answered. And the damage is done already anyways."
Bohemian Rhapsody,7,1,4,2 September 2019," needs some darker scenes
","It's a biopic of the popular band Queen and its lead singer Freddie Mercury. It starts in 1970 London. Freddie Bulsara (Rami Malek) is a baggage handler at Heathrow. He joins Roger Taylor and Brian May after they lose their lead singer. They add bassist John Deacon. Freddie changes his name to Freddie Mercury and marries girlfriend Mary Austin. The band signs with manager John Reid and becomes a world wide success. Freddie has an affair with Paul Prenter and comes out to Mary. It's a troubled life journey culminating to the celebrated Live Aid concert in 1985.The most important aspect of this biopic is Rami Malek's performance. For the most part, it is very good. If I choose to be snarky, I would say the teeth did half the job. While I think he has the essence of the role, his musical performances fall short in terms of power. In the end, all I know about Freddie Mercury is through his music videos and Malek needs to turn the dial to 11. Malek does fill up the role with humanity. One gets the sense of his confidence which seems to be a mask for his insecurities and his sexuality. He is a man of many dimensions and Malek is able to match his charisma. It's a very good performance.If there are flaws, the movie is pulling some of its punches back. I'm not pushing for a gay orgy scene but his homosexuality is held back for presumably the audience. If not that, then there could be more done with his drug use. I rarely call for montages but this case calls for it. It could go dark with a montage of his drug use. By going darker, his climb back to the light would be more exhilarating. As for exhilarations, I expected more from the Live Aid performance. I remember watching some of the concert back in the day but not for long stretches. The movie tries to make it something epic especially with the donations. I can't speak to that but it goes a little too far. It pushes too hard. I would eliminate the phone bank scenes. Overall, this movie is compelling. The band and its music is epic. The performances are good. It's a pretty good musical biopic."
Bird Box,6,3,5,19 May 2019," structural flaw
","Malorie (Sandra Bullock) harshly lays out the rules to two young kids named Boy and Girl. They are going on a difficult river trip. They have to stay quiet and can never ever take off their blindfolds. The situation begins five years earlier. People are going mad and killing themselves. Malorie is extremely pregnant and her boyfriend has left. She's at a checkup with her sister Jessica (Sarah Paulson) when she first encounters the happening. She escapes the chaos and finds shelter with various people inside a house.This is a variation on The Happening with a touch of A Quiet Place. Here the thing about The Happening. I didn't hate it. Mark Wahlberg and the reveal almost get me to hate it but I like the concept just enough to overcome it. The mass suicide angle is good although the deaths in this one is much more kinetic and therefore much more harrowing. There are a few problem, the biggest being the structure. Basically, the flashforward structure reveals who are probably going to die. The movie should have started with Malorie laying out the rules but the audience cannot see who she's talking to. It should have played the movie chronologically after that. By revealing the final grouping, it sucks the tension right out of the movie. Along with that, there are issues with some of the characters' actions. Someone should be in the room with Greg ready to pull the plug on the monitor. He is basically performing an experiment and it needs someone else to monitor it. When the group decides to leave the grocery store, there is no reason why Douglas wouldn't want to stay. In fact, it would be easier to move the group to the store rather than the other way around. While I understand locking up Douglas, somebody is supposed to look through Gary's bag. At the very least, I would have tied up Gary and put him under questioning. When the girls start the contractions, somebody should release Douglas. They need another set of hands. Instead of braving the rapids, it would be safer to walk it, no matter how much longer it would take. Despite all these issues, I do find the concept very compelling and it pulls me into its world."
"Good Morning, Vietnam",8,1,1,12 November 2013," more than a simple Robin Williams rant
","Director Barry Levinson takes a more comedic take on the Vietnam war like other great war comedies such as MASH. Adrian Cronauer (Robin Williams) is the new DJ in a stiff Armed Forces Radio. Edward Garlick (Forest Whitaker) is his best friend and Lt. Steven Hauk (Bruno Kirby) is the humorless superior. Adrian's life gets more complicated as he falls for a Vietnamese girl and befriends her brother.Robin Williams is doing his crazed manic persona. He lets his mouth run wild. Some of it work great. Some of the humor is era sensitive. How funny is a Lady Bird Johnson joke today? But how funny was it back in the 80s? Luckily, there is a story behind the crazy wise-cracking Robin Williams rants. The story works well with a good performance from the Vietnamese brother played by Tung Thanh Tran. But it is all Robin Williams and he shows that maybe he could be a great actor for the first time."
American Pie,8,1,2,6 December 2013," Great high school sex-romp
","A group of high school friends try hard to get to the next level. When the guys find even the Shermanator got laid, the 4 friends (Jason Biggs, Chris Klein, Thomas Ian Nicholas, Eddie Kaye Thomas) vow to score before high school graduation. It's your basic teenage sex romp.It could have been so easily a nothing movie. But the friendship elevates it, and there are plenty of funny things going on. It doesn't get funnier than Eugene Levy as Jim's Dad. And these young actors are so compelling.Of course, Jason Biggs gets the big scenes. The Nadia (Shannon Elizabeth) scene is hilarious no matter how many times I see it. And the pie has all the people talking. Just like the shower scene in Porky's, this becomes bigger than the movie.And rarely does a movie leak into the popular lexicon. For MILF alone, I'm willing a add an extra point to my vote. And is there anything more adorable than Alyson Hannigan's 'This one time, at band camp....'?"
Burn After Reading,5,0,4,12 December 2015," love Litzke but everybody else annoys me
","CIA analyst Osbourne Cox (John Malkovich) quits after being threatened with a demotion for his drinking problem. His dominating wife Katie (Tilda Swinton) is secretly having an affair with federal Marshall Harry Pfarrer (George Clooney). Katie decides to divorce him and copies his computer files. The CD gets left behind at a gym which is found by its employees. Chad Feldheimer (Brad Pitt) is an idiot trainer and Linda Litzke (Frances McDormand) is desperate for money to get plastic surgery. Chad tries to get some money for the highly secret files.I get that the Coen brothers don't always have likable characters but the people in this movie really annoyed me. The only exception is Frances McDormand. She is adorable in her desperation. Richard Jenkins is likable by being connected to her. Brad Pitt is trying too hard. John Malkovich is good at bombastically annoying but Tilda Swinton is too cold and distant. If this movie starts and centers on Litzke, I would like it a lot more."
The Last Legion,5,2,4,16 August 2013," desperate to be poignant
","The year is 460 A.D., Rome is weak and a new child emperor is crowned. Rome soon falls to the Goths, and the emperor is taken prisoner. All that's left is a handful of men who are obligated by duty to rescue him. The men are led by Aurelius (Colin Firth) and the emperor's mysterious former guardian Ambrosinus (Ben Kingsley). They travel to Britannia to find The Last Legion that could be counted on to be loyal to the emperor.From there, it becomes ridiculous and tries to tie in another legendary story. Whole sections are rushed or skipped. The action is passable but lack drama. There are many plot holes. Logic is thrown out the window. They bend over backwards to try and close this story loop. It's more awkward than poetic as may be hoped."
Watchmen,8,2,6,28 March 2015," dark ambitious world
","In an alternate 1985, superheroes and costumed vigilantes exist. They formed the Minutemen in 1940 but the . Nixon is the president and the world is on the brink of nuclear war. The Comedian (Jeffrey Dean Morgan) is killed by a skilled assassin. Rorschach (Jackie Earle Haley) thinks that somebody is trying to kill all the heroes. Dan Dreiberg aka Nite Owl (Patrick Wilson) is semi-retired and thinks Rorschach is too paranoid. Adrian Veidt aka Ozymandias (Matthew Goode) is a wealthy celebrity. Dr. Manhattan (Billy Crudup) is the all-powerful all-seeing indestructible superhero. Laurie Jupiter (Malin Akerman) had put away her Silk Spectre identity and trying to maintain a human relationship with Dr. Manhattan. Her mother Sally (Carla Gugino) was the original Silk Spectre but is now a drunk.It's a dark ambitious world that Zack Snyder and friends have created. It may be too ambitious but they really gave it their all. It's got a great style. Some may complain about changes from the graphic novel. That's always a failed argument for me. I do have some minor complaints about the ending but I'm not saying there are easy solutions. It oversimplifies world politics and distorts human nature. Malin Akerman does a good job despite the naysayers. Dr. Manhattan digs into some existential questions. I like everybody especially Jackie Earle Haley's performance. There are many great aspects that they easily smooth out any bumps in the road."
The Bourne Identity,8,0,1,13 September 2013," All Action
","A mysterious man (Matt Damon) is saved from the sea having lost his memory. As he searches for clues, he becomes a target of a secret CIA operation. Based on Robert Ludlum's novel, Doug Liman brings to life the mysterious super agent. Matt Damon reinvents himself as an action star as the silent but deadly kind. Franka Potente is the beautiful Marie who befriends Jason Bourne. Sure it's like James Bond or any number of action hero. We're not having any jokes, no sarcasm. This is straight up, high octane, adrenaline junkie action. It's no wonder how this ignited its own franchise."

To raise money for Frank's surgery, he intends to jump 15 school buses with the help of his friends Rico (Danny McBride), Dave (Bill Hader) and his half-brother Kevin (Jorma Taccone). Denise joins in the gang but it turns out that she's going out with the douchey Jonathan Ault (Will Arnett).Andy Samberg has built a movie around stupidity. However the stupidity is generally not that funny with a few exceptions. One thing is certain. Samberg and cast are fully committed to put every strange weird things on the screen. When it works, it gets some big laughs. This is like a series of extended SNL digital shorts put together in a pretty thin plot."

","In 1973, New York Times reporter Sydney Schanberg (Sam Waterston) goes to cover the war in Cambodia with Dith Pran as his interpreter. They cover the war along side other journalists like Al Rockoff (John Malkovich) and Jon Swain (Julian Sands). A military adviser (Craig T. Nelson) tries to cover up an accidental American B-52 bombing of an innocent town. Eventually the Khmer Rouge threatens to overrun the country. Dith Pran decides to stay despite the danger while his family leaves. After the fall, Phnom Penh is evacuated and the group finds refuge in the French embassy. The foreigners are allowed to go home but Dith Pran and the locals are not so lucky.Director Roland Joffé creates a masterpiece. It is shockingly intense without warning. It is deep emotionally. He captures the desperate instability and the unknowable fear of the fall of the capital. The chaos and the random brutality is perfect. The acting is superb. Developing a picture has never been more intense. Then the movie does the unthinkable. It hands over the lead and the movie to a no name amateur Cambodian actor. The great surprise is that the movie is as compelling as ever. This is a historical biopic masterpiece from start to finish."

However, he needs the help of John Bridger's daughter, Stella (Charlize Theron), a professional safe cracker who uses her skills for good. This also stars Seth Green, Mos Def, and Jason Statham as members of the team. That's a great group of actors, and they had a fun time driving Mini Coopers thru L.A. traffic and under L.A. And I think we all had fun."
Baby Driver,7,2,9,22 September 2017," fine action made cool
","Baby (Ansel Elgort) is the skilled getaway driver for robberies organized by Doc (Kevin Spacey). Baby has hearing problems after the crash that killed his parents. He is constantly listening to music to alleviate the symptoms. He owes money to Doc and is working it off. Doc recruits a rotating cast of characters in the robbery crew. Baby falls for waitress Debora (Lily James).Edgar Wright is the real star of the movie. The idea is pretty simple. The story is straight forward. The execution is superb. The car chases are fun with an exciting music soundtrack. There is his trademark close-ups but he doesn't do his usual long sequences. The acting is solid but Baby can be a distancing character. He says little and that is a wall from him at times. The rotating cast of characters also prevent great relationships from building up. Some of them have great scenes with him but they don't all have the needed time. Jon Bernthal has a great time poking at Baby but he's cut short. These are stylistic choices that probably pull back some of the bigger payoffs. While this is a fun execution, Baby is not a character who is bigger than the story. He's not quite at the same level as Ryan Gosling in Drive. It's partly Elgort. He's more a puppy version of the big dog. There are some fun moments. The comedy is sporadic but good. Overall, this is a fun ride."
Justice League,6,1,4,17 February 2018," kinda bored me
","Superman (Henry Cavill) is dead. Batman (Ben Affleck) encounters a winged alien and evidences of three powerful boxes. Fearing a coming alien apocalypse, he gathers a group of superheroes with ally Wonder Woman (Gal Gadot). They recruit The Flash (Ezra Miller), Aquaman (Jason Momoa), and Cyborg (Ray Fisher) forming the Justice League.I know most of the complaints being leveled against this movie. What surprised me is that the movie kinda bored me. I have lots of nitpicks but overall, the simplistic ragged storytelling leaves me wanting. The first thing I notice is the inferior CGI. Some of it looks more like a video game. I know about the unmustaching but it's not obvious on a smaller TV. Something is fake about his face but there is a lot that looks fake in this movie. The storytelling is jumpy and doesn't really flow. The villain is one dimensional at best and lacks any compelling characteristics. As for the JL members, they are generally good with the most glaring problem coming from Batman himself. For some reason, he has turned quippy which doesn't fit this version of Batman. Flash is a lonely nerd somewhere on the spectrum. I don't mind that but they don't expand on it. Wonder Woman is wonderful and she has some of the better emotional moments with the other members. Cyborg is a fine addition. Aquaman is a great character but his story probably has some stuff cut from the movie. Hopefully, his movie will expand on that. I do like this more than BvS. It has many problems but at least, it's a not mess like that one."
The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring,9,0,0,21 September 2016," immersive new world

Gandalf (Ian McKellen) arrives in the Shire to visit Bilbo. Bilbo goes on a personal journey leaving the burden of the ring to Frodo (Elijah Wood). Frodo sets off on a quest to save the world with his best friend Samwise (Sean Astin). Along the way, others join this Fellowship of the Ring.Peter Jackson delivers a near-perfect execution of this fantasy classic. The CGI is state-of-the-art but the movie does not get bogged down with battles of massive armies. The action is visceral and thrilling. The characters are compelling and the performances are near perfect. The internal conflicts over the ring actually drive the narrative and ultimately generates great paranoia and isolation for Frodo. This is a great start."

Meanwhile the machines are closing in on Zion, and the survivors are preparing for the last stand.The Matrix double talk continues. It continues to confound. The ultimate ending seems random. This is strictly to wrap things up. And they get to blow lots of stuff up in the CG world. The best part is the battle in Zion. It is super fun, wildly chaotic, and overwhelming. The big CG battle looks really good. The Neo part of the movie is just too convoluted and random. I don't understand how he defeated Agent Smith. Maybe the fact that he did is all that is necessary to know."
Man of Steel,8,6,9,2 June 2014," What Superman needed
","On the planet Krypton, Jor-El (Russell Crowe) is killed by General Zod (Michael Shannon) after he launches his son with the Codex of Kryptonian genetics to earth. Zod and his men are sentenced and imprisoned in the Phantom Zone. Soon after Krypton implodes. The baby is raised by the Kents (Diane Lane, Kevin Costner). Clark Kent (Henry Cavill) grows up to be a drifter hiding his powers from everybody. Then a spaceship is discovered in 18,000 years old ice. Lois Lane (Amy Adams) is there but Clark pilots it away. It's an earlier scout ship that the Kryptonians sent out. Kryptonians fell into population control and they abandoned space exploration. When Zod arrives on earth, Kal-El is the only hope.This is a darker Superman which is exactly what the franchise needs. This should have been done by Bryan Singer for his reboot rather than trying to copy the Richard Donner version. This is not the Norman Rockwell painting version. Clark Kent is scruffy fisherman and not the boy scout. Even Pa Kent advises against using his powers when his schoolmates' lives are at stake. This is a true reboot.The action looks quite good. Everything is expertly made. There is the Battlestar Galactica TV style of zooming in on the action. The designs look amazing. The hand to hand combat is pretty much all CGI. On one hand, I understand the superpower nature can only be done by CGI. On the other hand, I always prefer real stunts for human size combat. If there is one possible complain, the action doesn't take enough breaks. The audience needs a few more quiet breaks to catch their breath. The action may be too overwhelming.Quite frankly, Superman no longer has the duo personality and he is simply the angst ridden hero. Henry Cavill does a solid job delivering the needed performance. It's not until the end does he become nerdy reporter. The brilliant Michael Shannon does a superb job as General Zod. Overall, this is a solid launching point for a new series of DC comics movies."
Grease,8,2,2,25 December 2013," Loads of fun, and lots of joy
","Greaser Danny Zuko (John Travolta) returns from a summer of love with sweet girl Sandy Olsen (Olivia Newton-John). Instead of going back to Australia, she ends up in the same school as him. Danny is the leader of the T-Birds while Sandy joins up with the Pink Ladies. Danny can't quite bring himself to show his soft side in front of all the guys.This is a fun musical above all else. The music is infectious. Olivia Newton-John is wonderful singer, and actually quite a lovely actress. John Travolta is a good song and dance man. Some of the actors are pushing the age limit like Stockard Channing, but none of it matters as much the joy of this movie."
The Caine Mutiny,6,0,4,11 November 2014," some good actors
","Young Ensign Keith (Robert Francis) is assigned to the rust bucket USS Caine in WWII. He boards in Pearl Harbor, and is disappointed with the poor shape of the destroyer. The crew is a band of misfit rejects. Captain DeVriess is lax, weary and tired. However the executive officer Maryk (Van Johnson), communications officer Keefer (Fred MacMurray) and the rest of the crew are capable men. DeVriess is happy to be relieved by Queeg (Humphrey Bogart). At first, Keith is glad to have a strict disciplinarian at the helm but Queeg soon shows erratic behaviors.The tone is too light especially with that music constantly coming up every two seconds. The movie needs to relax with the music. The tone needs to be darker and more threatening. The side story away from the ship is a waste of time. The love story is weak melodrama. The tension should be much higher. The acting is generally good although the movie is resting on the cast's least experienced shoulders of Robert Francis. At first, Keefer is overplaying it because Queeg is more incompetent than actually crazy. The movie needs to let Queeg lead the way or else the crew could be seen as over-reacting. The crazy talk should start only after the strawberry incident. After all, he could be just a hard man putting down the law. There is only one great scene with the ship in the storm. I just wish the whole movie has that level of tension and acting. The last part of the movie is the trial. It somewhat drags but Bogart is electric in his testimony. Also the last bit is problematic in a pox on all their houses."
Footloose,7,0,4,18 January 2014," Kevin Bacon have some hokey fun
",Ren McCormack (Kevin Bacon) and his mom are new in the town of Bomont coming from Chicago. The small town is so repressive that dancing and loud music has been banned. The conservative atmosphere is stoked by the bible thumping Reverend Shaw Moore (John Lithgow) who is haunted by a personal loss. Of course the reverend's daughter Ariel (Lori Singer) is the wildest teen of them all.This teen movie is hokey and fun starting with the title song by Kenny Loggins. There is some fun cheese like Kevin Bacon dancing in the abandoned factory. But then there are also some very serious issues going on. The reason it works is Kevin Bacon. It's his boyish charm. And what ever happened to Lori Singer? She's great in this as the rebellious preacher's daughter. It's also interesting to see Sarah Jessica Parker in the best friend role.
The Color of Money,7,9,12,12 September 2013," Paul Newman outclasses Tom Cruise
","Pool hustler Fast Eddie Felson (Paul Newman) discovers a cocky, young pool player Vincent (Tom Cruise) in a local bar. Along with Vincent's girl Carmen (Mary Elizabeth Mastrantonio), he tries to teach the youngster all that he knows about the hustle.Tom Cruise overplays the cocky arrogant characters. At times, he plays him like a cartoon character. Luckily Paul Newman could bring the acting chops to this movie. When Paul's character loses to Amos (Forest Whitaker), you see a history of the man's failures. You felt his defeat emotionally. Martin Scorsese directs this. I wonder if Martin Scorsese held back a little. The violence and grittiness for which he's known for isn't all there. They're traveling the darkest and lowest pool halls, but it could have been much worst."
Radio,6,0,1,1 September 2014," Functional melodrama
","It's 1976 in Anderson, South Carolina. Harold Jones (Ed Harris) is the high school football coach. His wife Linda (Debra Winger) thinks he's not paying enough attention to their daughter (Sarah Drew). James 'Radio' (Cuba Gooding Jr.) is a mentally handicapped man who pushes a shopping cart around town. After taking one of the team's football, the star ballplayer and his friends tie him up and terrorize him. Coach takes Radio under his wing. It's not always easy as the team doesn't live up to expectations.There are different ways to criticize Cuba's performance. It could be seen as a showy thing meant for the awards season. Cuba could be dismissed as unable to do more with the character. I think he does a fine job. It's definitely not award winning but at least he's pushing his acting range.The major problem for me is the concentration on the coach and Radio. It needs to have a POV from someone else. There are a couple of possibilities. Johnny Clay would be an interesting choice especially with his father Frank. He's set up for a redemption storyline. The side characters need more time. The story is too simplistic when there is easy drama underneath the story. A more fleshed out story for the teenagers would be much more compelling. It shows when the daughter is able to pull the deepest emotions from the story."
28 Weeks Later,6,4,6,13 September 2014," misses Robert Carlyle in the second half
","It's 28 weeks after the release of the virus and about 6 months after the first movie. The US Army is occupying London after the zombies have all supposedly died of starvation. Don (Robert Carlyle) narrowly escaped the zombies by abandoning his wife Alice (Catherine McCormack) and others. Doyle (Jeremy Renner) and Flynn (Harold Perrineau) are a couple of the military personnel under the command of General Stone (Idris Elba). Scarlet (Rose Byrne) is an Army doctor. Tammy (Imogen Poots) and Andy (Mackintosh Muggleton) are Don's kids who return from Spain after missing the initial outbreak. The kids escape the zone to find their semi-zombified mother at home. She's infected but isn't turning.The first one has a simple powerful originality. The originality could never be repeated. I do like Don's duplicity and personal demons from his escape. I wish the movie stayed with him as he struggles with his inner demons and possibly finds redemption. The bigger ideas are lost when he turns. It becomes a simple zombie action movie. I just miss Robert Carlyle as the main character in the second half. When time is invested in him being the main survivor character, the movie needs to follow his story. The action is bigger and more confused. It loses the cleanliness of the original horror. The simplicity of the original lends itself to be a great horror. There is probably a political statement being made about American occupation but it doesn't really dig that deep."
Cast Away,7,3,4,3 January 2015," Great one-man performance
","It's 1995. Chuck Noland (Tom Hanks) is a FedEx systems analyst troubleshooting around the world. He is meticulous about time in his work. He comes home to spend the Christmas holidays with his girlfriend Kelly Frears (Helen Hunt) in Memphis but he's called away. Before he leaves, he gives Kelly a box with a ring and declares 'I'll be right back.' His plane goes off course in the storm and crashes in the Pacific Ocean. He gets marooned on a deserted island with some of the packages washing on shore. His only companion is a volleyball he names Wilson.This is one of the best one-man performance ever. The story itself isn't as compelling as one assumes. It is a lot of wave sounds while Tom Hanks discovers survival techniques through trial and error. Wilson is a fascinating invention. It's interesting that Robert Zemeckis doesn't insert a voice for him. It actually works very well. The movie can drag at certain places but Hanks is always a fascinating watch."
The Thing,9,1,3,11 October 2014," Must-watch for all horror fans
",It's the start of winter. An isolation group of scientists at the United States National Science Institute Station 4 in Antarctica is interrupted by a Norwegian helicopter buzzing around. The Norwegians are throwing charges and shooting at a dog. George Bennings (Peter Maloney) is shot and Garry (Donald Moffat) kills the supposed mad Norwegian. Clark (Richard Masur) takes the dog in. MacReady (Kurt Russell) flies Dr. Blair (Wilford Brimley) and Garry to the Norwegian camp. They discover it smoldering and a place of massacre. Windows can't reach anybody on the radio.The makeup special effect is gruesome and astonishing. The pre-CGI real effect reaches an all-new high. The snowy atmosphere is stark. No room is given to sentimentality. Director John Carpenter has crafted an incredible masterpiece that is a must-watch for all horror fans. He brings out his music sound effects once again. The testing scene raises the tension beyond high. It's one of the most intense scenes in any horror.
Armageddon,4,2,4,13 December 2014," It's loud. It's stupid. It's Michael Bay.
","The earth is bombarded by asteroids. NASA manager Dan Truman (Billy Bob Thornton) has to come up with a way to avoid a human ending event. They come up with a scheme to blow up the asteroid from the inside. Harry Stamper (Bruce Willis) is the best deep core driller. His best worker A.J. Frost (Ben Affleck) is secretly dating his daughter Grace (Liv Tyler). Along with the rest of the crew, Harry has to ride the shuttle, drill down on the asteroid and place a nuke.It's loud. It's stupid. The jokes are lame half of the time. The other half is funny because I'm laughing at how broad they are. The cuts are deliberately violent. It's cartoon testosterone overload. It's relentless. That's Michael Bay for you. If he could pull back, this would be quite a fun ride. Its relentless nature wears me out. And why does a few feet matter when they have nukes? Why are people not in zero gravity when they're in the space station? These and many other things just add to the ridiculousness of the movie."
The Village,6,1,2,16 April 2015," great moody light horror but horribly weak ending
","Covington is an odd isolated village. There are mysterious creatures 'Those We Don't Speak Of' lurking in the woods. They are supposedly attracted to specific colors and the villagers wear the safe yellow when they are close to the woods. The villagers have a truce with the creatures. However suspicious animal carcasses suggest that the truce has been broken. Lucius Hunt (Joaquin Phoenix) wants to travel to other towns to get medical supplies. He is denied by the town elders and his mother Alice (Sigourney Weaver). Ivy Elizabeth Walker (Bryce Dallas Howard) is the blind daughter of the chief Elder Edward Walker (William Hurt). She is kind to village idiot Noah Percy (Adrien Brody). When Ivy and Lucius get engaged, a jealous Noah stabs Lucius. In desperation, Ivy goes out to get medicine with the help of her father.It's an interesting movie for about 2/3 of the time. It has a nice moody vibe. At time, it borders on horror. It's a really fascinating movie. I wish Bryce Dallas Howard is better at playing blind. I also wish William Hurt's character doesn't reveal so much. It deflates the movie. Her odyssey loses much of the tension. Instead of fearing some mysterious boogeymen, the audience is left with nothing more than the random falling into a hole. It tries to recover with a strange mysterious thing. I wish it stayed with the surreal turn. It would work infinitely better if William Hurt would shut up. None of it could really saved this from a truly weak ending. People really hate it when their TV show ends with these kinds of reveal. I think Shyamalan got a taste of the reaction."
21,6,0,0,2 January 2015," interesting premise turns into flashy romantic thriller
","Ben Campbell (Jim Sturgess) is a MIT math major looking to get into Harvard School of Medicine. He comes from a poor family and needs to dazzle for a full scholarship. Ben impressed his professor Micky Rosa (Kevin Spacey) and is introduced to the professor's secret club. Along with Jill Taylor (Kate Bosworth), Choi (Aaron Yoo), Kianna (Liza Lapira) and Fisher (Jacob Pitts), they hone their card counting skills to beat the casinos at blackjack. It's a great ride until casino pit boss Cole Williams (Laurence Fishburne) catches him.The premise is interesting. The movie depends on Jim Sturgess and where the movie chose to concentrate on. I'm not thrill about the romance being glued on to this. It feels ill-fitting. If there is one compelling relationship, it should be Ben and the professor. This could have been a great dark character study. Instead it tries to be flashy and cool. The romance drains the edginess out of the movie. Also it would be more compelling to have Ben start off as a more introverted loner. It would allow more room for the character growth and some possible father issues."
He Got Game,7,0,1,31 August 2016," Spike Lee directs
","Jake Shuttlesworth (Denzel Washington) has 15 more years to serve in prison. The warden (Ned Beatty) has an offer for him. The governor wants Jake's son Jesus Shuttlesworth (Ray Allen) to sign with his alta mater Big State. Jesus is arguably the highest rated high school athlete and there is only one week before the signing deadline. Jake fakes a illness and the warden sneaks him out with parole officers Spivey (Jim Brown) and Crudup. Jesus faces pressures from all sides. His girlfriend Lala Bonilla (Rosario Dawson) wants him to meet illegally with a 'family friend' agent. His coach has been lending him money and wants advance word on his choice. Jake gets in with his daughter Mary but Jesus quickly kicks him out for killing their mother. Uncle Bubba (Bill Nunn) wants to get paid unlike aunt Sally. Coleman 'Booger' Sykes (Hill Harper) is their son and they're Jesus' guardians. Jake rents a room next to hooker Dakota Burns (Milla Jovovich) and her pimp Sweetness.A more straight forward movie would have Jesus as the lead. The difference between Ray Allen and Denzel Washington does mean that the father gets the lead. The best scene is Big Time Willie laying down some knowledge. I also love uncle Bubba. The NBA agent does need a better actor. I don't really care about Dakota but again, the father's story gets elevated simply for Denzel. In fact, a lot of Jake's story don't completely add up. It's a side character that would serve well staying as a side character. Ray Allen turns out to be a functional actor although he's no star and he's no Denzel."
The Revenant,8,0,1,11 July 2016," beautifully shot
","Hugh Glass (Leonardo DiCaprio) is a frontiers guide with his half-Indian son Hawk. Captain Andrew Henry (Domhnall Gleeson) had sent out a hunting party for fur pelts led by Glass. The group is attacked by Arikara party led by Elk Dog searching for his daughter Powaqa who was kidnapped by two white men. The survivors retreat to their boat. Elk Dog gives chase thinking Powaqa is held prisoner by Glasses' group. Glass decides to lead the men over land despite disagreement from John Fitzgerald (Tom Hardy). Glass is attacked by a bear leaving him half-dead. The men refuse to follow Fitz and leave him behind.Iñárritu's visual style is impeccable. Tom Hardy's acting is great. DiCaprio wins a lifetime Oscar award. This thing starts out like a roaring train culminating in the bear attack. It does get a little messy after that. While Tom Hardy is great, the movie should follow solely DiCaprio after the bear attack. It also has a convenient encounter with Powaqa. This should be simpler and end with a simple mano a mano fight. I do love the trick that Glass plays on Fitz."
Trouble with the Curve,7,1,2,11 April 2015," Eastwood and Adams great
","Gus Lobel (Clint Eastwood) is the grumpy aged baseball scout for the Atlanta Braves. His eyes are failing and he never touches a computer. His friend head of scouting Pete Klein (John Goodman) continues to support him but Phillip Sanderson (Matthew Lillard) is gunning for his job. GM Vince (Robert Patrick) is looking to not extend Gus' contract. Gus' daughter Mickey (Amy Adams) is a workaholic pushing to be a partner in her law firm. If she wins the next big case, she'll be partner. Pete asks Mickey to join Gus on an important make-or-break scouting trip to evaluate hitting phenomena Bo Gentry. Johnny Flanagan (Justin Timberlake) was a pitcher scouted by Gus. He's the new scout for the Red Sox.There are lots of interesting things going into this movie. Eastwood and Adams have a good chemistry and a good father daughter relationship to tell. This is also the anti-Moneyball movie. That is probably enough for the movie to concentrate on. The two veteran actors are really good here but the movie adds some more extra. Justin Timberlake is a functional actor but I keep thinking that there are better actors around. The villains are a bit too broad. Lillard is going overboard a little especially at the end. Basically he needs to shut up after he gets beat. The movie sets up a few things way too neatly. While I understand why Bo is made out to be a villain, some of it seems unnecessary. Then there is Peanut Boy. The whole thing is too perfect. Eastwood and Adams are great. The rest are not all up to that standard."
Bridge of Spies,8,2,3,18 April 2016," well-made
","It's 1957 Brooklyn. Rudolf Abel (Mark Rylance) is arrested for being a Soviet spy. Insurance lawyer James B. Donovan (Tom Hanks) is pushed to defend him. Despite popular pressure, Donovan fights to prevent Abel's execution. When U-2 pilot Francis Gary Powers is shoot down over the Soviet Union, CIA director Allen Dulles recruits Donovan to test out the prisoner exchange idea as a private citizen. American student Frederic Pryor gets imprisoned on the wrong side of the Berlin wall. Donovan decides to hold out for both Americans' release.Director Steven Spielberg delivers a well-made movie. However, there is a lack of tension for most of the movie. Spielberg needs to ramp up the danger to Donovan. He needs to gin up more danger to his job and to his family. The shooting into his house is fine. I expected a scene of his wife getting confronted. Having said that, other scenes seem too heavy-handed especially the last few scenes back home. Spielberg is also putting in too much of a glare which gives the movie a dreamy quality. Instead, it needs a darker, harsher, and scarier tone. Tom Hanks is a bit too calm. He needs to be scared in more times. The time he's confronted by the street youths in East Berlin is a prime example. It needs to be shocking and it needs to come out of nowhere. Instead, it's laid out before it happens and it's a source of comedy afterward. The tension is never too high. It could have been a darker, scarier scene."
Pitch Black,8,1,1,26 October 2015," great sci-fi horror
","The spaceship Hunter-Gratzner crashes on a desert planet. Pilot Carolyn Fry (Radha Mitchell) tries to take control after the captain is killed. Bounty hunter William J. Johns (Cole Hauser) is transporting prisoner Richard B. Riddick (Vin Diesel). There are also holy man Abu 'Imam' al-Walid (Keith David) and his young charges, antiquities dealer Paris P. Ogilvie, runaway Jack (Rhiana Griffith), John Zeke Ezekiel and Sharon 'Shazza' Montgomery (Claudia Black). They discover that the planet's 3 suns align to have a nightfall every 22 years and creatures from below rise up to massacre every creature on the surface. They are forced to rely on the killer Riddick and his night vision.This is great smallish sci-fi horror. Radha Mitchell does a nice Ripley. This reminds me a lot of Alien which I consider one of the greatest movies ever. It's got good desolate settings. Vin Diesel is the Man. This starts as an interesting character that turns into something great. The creature feature plus the darkness make this even better."
Split,7,3,10,16 April 2017," M. Night comeback gaining speed
","Casey Cooke (Anya Taylor-Joy) has been getting into trouble at school. She and her two young friends, Claire Benoit (Haley Lu Richardson) and Marcia (Jessica Sula), are kidnapped by a mysterious stranger named Kevin Wendell Crumb (James McAvoy). Kevin has been getting treatment from Dr. Karen Fletcher (Betty Buckley) for having 23 personalities. Dr. Fletcher fears Kevin has been taken over by the less desirable identities Dennis and Patricia. She dismisses their fears of an emerging Beast in their psyche. The movie also flashbacks to a young Casey on a hunting trip with her uncle John.M. Night Shyamalan has regained much of his footing. There are some good scenes and the acting is great. McAvoy has the showy acting and he delivers. Anya Taylor-Joy does most of her work with her stone-face and those eyes. There is a nice sequence with a coat-hanger. I wonder if there is more tension to be had. M. Night keeps most of the violence off camera. I would definitely change the number 23 to something more manageable. Six would be more compelling as the audience counts up each identity. This is a solid addition to the M. Night library."
Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows: Part 1,7,1,3,25 December 2013," Darker than ever
","Darkness is descending on the world after the death of Dumbledore. Death eaters are everywhere and growing in power. Harry is on the run. He, Hermione, and Ron must find and destroy all the Hocruxes. All the while they must avoid being captured by Voldemort's forces.We are truly descending into darkness. The forces of good are on the run. The three friends are on their own. It was alway going to be this way. All the previous films have been leading up to this.What this movie needs is continuous danger and action. We need the three to be on the run. However for large sections in the middle, they are hiding rather than running. It's not as visually and cinematically exciting. While I understand that changing the story would be unacceptable. It may be better to add the other character's adventures to spice things up. Overall, I like the dark moody tone."
The Hills Have Eyes,5,1,2,17 October 2013," More meat for the grinder
","The Carter family is traveling across the New Mexico desert on their way to San Diego. On an isolated road, their vehicles run across tire spikes. They don't notice at first, but they have fallen into a trap. They are hunted by a group of cannibalistic society warped by nuclear testing in the area. This is a remake of 1977 Wes Craven horror. The ultra ugly violence is pretty interesting. It's meant to shock and it does that to some extent. It certainly gets very brutal.The actors are pretty good but the characters are unoriginal. They are certainly better than this B-movie material deserves. The problem is that I didn't really root for the family. Neither did I root against the family. So the tension of their kills aren't maximized. They're just meat for the grinder. I wish Alexandre Aja could concentrate on one character and make me root for that person. These people are not worthy of my sympathy. They do stupid things like splitting up. The father runs away when he should be attacking like when his dog bites the ax guy. The boy is useless. He's probably the only guy with a gun in the world that is the underdog in a fight with an unarmed guy. It make me want to slap him.... BADLY. And somebody needs to shut Emilie de Ravin up. Sometimes, you can scream too much in a horror movie."
Cold Mountain,5,1,2,31 December 2014," don't care for the romance
","Before the war, Ada Monroe (Nicole Kidman) and Reverend Monroe (Donald Sutherland) arrive in Cold Mountain, North Carolina. She immediately falls for Inman (Jude Law) and they become sweethearts. In 1864, Union sappers set off a large charge under the Confederate trenches outside of Petersburg where Inman is stationed. Union soldiers charge into the crater and are trapped under heavy Confederate fire. Inman is injured by friendly fire. After reading a letter from Ada, he deserts to go back to Cold Mountain. Meanwhile Ada's father dies and she is unable to work the farm alone without slaves. She is hounded by a home guard soldier. Her neighbor Swangers (Kathy Baker) sends her Ruby Thewes (Renee Zellweger) to help.The movie starts with a very impressive battle. It is one of the grittiest vision of the ugliness of war. After that, the movie depends on the romance. The overwrought melodramatic romance doesn't strike me with any heat. It is literally the proverbial love at first sight. In great film romances, they spend a little time building to that point. It is usually time well spent. This is no Scarlett and Butler. In fact, Nicole Kidman makes me want to ring her neck like that rooster. The Old South of Cold Mountain before the war is a beautiful lush gentle place with few references to slavery. I guess that's fine although they mention that the Monroes let go of their slaves. It seems like a good thing to put on screen. Inman's journey seems fascinating but very random. Renée Zellweger may have won the Academy Awards but it's a bracing performance next to Kidman's. Overall, there are interesting scenes but most of all, I find the romance rather uninspired. This is no 'Gone With the Wind'."
Kung Fu Panda 2,8,1,2,4 May 2014," Good family fun with heart

It's a canon and it threatens to make Kung Fu obsolete. Also Po must come to terms with his origins that haunts him with crippling flashbacks, and find inner peace. It is also needed to work out issues with his father Mr. Ping.The Panda is as funny as ever. The whole gang is back. I love the adoption story with Mr. Ping. It's actually good emotional stuff. That part provides the heart. The action is better than ever. It's even exciting as well as exhilarating. That part provides the fun. And the comedy provides the joy of the franchise."

He's a master of the universe type living in a pristine apartment. Jean (Chloë Sevigny) is his suffering secretary. Evelyn Williams (Reese Witherspoon) is his annoying fiancée. He's sure that she's having an affair with Timothy Bryce (Justin Theroux) while he himself is having an affair with her best friend Courtney Rawlinson (Samantha Mathis). On top of his materialistic vapid daily existence, he has bloodthirsty nights that gets more and more out of control.Director Mary Harron is doing a slightly surreal horror slash comedy. The major problem is that I don't really care about anybody or anything in this movie. There are some witty moments like the business card oneupmanship scene. However I just couldn't bother with the annoying boorish selfish character. At some point, the movie started to bore me. He's not funny and the movie isn't really that funny either. It's not scary as a horror. There is no tension since I don't about him or his victims. I just can't make myself care about this movie."

Her son Dwayne (Paul Dano) is tired of his family, and has vow to be silent. Grandpa Hoover (Alan Arkin) was kicked out of his nursing home for misbehaving. Finally daughter Olive (Abigail Breslin) is so excited about getting into the Little Miss Sunshine pageant.The reason this movie works is that I love these characters. I love everybody except for the dad. They are just so weirdly likable. They are the essence of an underdog story. I love this family, and it's not only for the cute little girl. I even love the VW van."

He manages to survive but the police doesn't believe him when he tells them the story. It also turns out that Townsend is an UN diplomat. He goes to the UN general assembly to track down Townsend. Vandamm kills Townsend and Thornhill becomes the fall guy for the murder. It turns out that George Kaplan is a fictional spy created by the government to divert attention away from the real agent. On the run from the police, he boards the 20th Century Limited train bound for Chicago. On board, he meets Eve Kendall (Eva Marie Saint) who assists him in hiding from the cops. Then it's another twist when he finds out that Eve is working for Vandamm and Leonard. It's a long winding adventure that ends on top of Mt. Rushmore.This is one convoluted story. Hitchcock is able to keep it going by the talents of Cary Grant and the audacity to keep piling on the twists. Cary Grant is a fun leading man. His charm is overflowing and he handles the wild story with great skill. Eva Marie Saint is a great Hitchcock blonde. This is simply a fun roller-coaster ride with the music, the style, and the non-stop thrills."

His father John (Nicolas Cage) is an MIT Astrophysics professor. He starts making sense of the numbers. First, it's 9/11 and 2996 deaths.

He's there for the next disaster and figures out the location coordinates in the numbers. He becomes obsessed and tracks down Lucinda's daughter Diana (Rose Byrne). Throughout, there are mysterious strangers haunting Caleb.The start has an intriguing premise. It's on track to be an interesting moody horror. It adds on some big CGI action sets. Once the mystery of the numbers is solved, the story loses its intensity. The ultimate ending requires much more foreshadowing. This needs to chop off the ending and tweak it to something less convoluted. If it wants that ending, it should be more than strange white-haired guys leaving wish pebbles."

He steals to survive and hounded by station Inspector Gustave Dasté (Sacha Baron Cohen). It turns out that he's been maintaining the station clocks as taught by his drunken absent uncle Claude. He is a mechanical genius trying to repair his father's life project, an automaton (mechanical man). His father (Jude Law) found it rusted, abandoned in the museum, and without the key. He was killed in a fire. Papa Georges confiscates Hugo's notebook and threatens to burn it. Papa Georges is hiding a secret past and forbids Isabelle from seeing any movies.This is one of the most unique Martin Scorsese movie. The kids are great. The visuals are gorgeous. Scorsese is doing something completely out of his realm. At first, Ben Kingsley is playing a very mean-spirited man. As the movie develops, it becomes evident that this man is broken from his connection to the movie industry. It's probably something that is fascinating to Scorsese. He makes it fascinating to the audience. He bring his vision to life."
Terminator 3: Rise of the Machines,6,0,2,12 September 2014," Some good action but inferior to the original two
","John Connor (Nick Stahl) is a young man living off the grid as a drifter. He is still haunted by nightmares of an apocalyptic future. Future SkyNet sends back T-X (Kristanna Loken) to hunt down various people including Kate Brewster (Claire Danes). She's the daughter of U.S. Air Force General Robert Brewster who is reluctant to activate SkyNet on their system. There is a computer supervirus infecting the world. Another Terminator (Arnold Schwarzenegger) arrives to protect John. John breaks into Kate's animal clinic to steal medicine. It turns out that they knew each other as teens before the original Terminator.This is not bigger and better than the other two. That is its biggest sin in the logic of sequels. It has some good action but it's not bigger than the second one. The car chase is lots of fun especially with real action. It doesn't bring anything new to the franchise. It is merely a continuation. Nick Stahl should have been a good lead. At least, the movie NEEDED him to be good. Instead, he's merely capable. Claire Danes is much better. The standout is Arnold who looks amazing at his age. I didn't particularly like the coincidence of Kate and John being in the same place. The humor isn't as good. The lines aren't as memorable. The plot isn't as well thought out. It's just not as good overall."
The Orphanage,8,0,3,12 August 2016," nice moody ghost story
","Laura returns to live in her former home, a closed orphanage. She brings her husband Carlos, and adopted son Simón. Simón claims to have a new friend Tomás. He's angry telling Laura that his friend told him that he's adopted. She is attacked by a mysterious boy in a mask and Simón goes missing. Suspicion falls on social worker Benigna Escobedo. Six months later, Laura sees her getting killed run over by a car. Medium Aurora helps Laura discover the truth.This is a murkier ghost story. It's got a nice creepy mood. The lead is compelling. It doesn't always have the action to drive the horror. It relies more on the mystery. There is a great masked kid. It has a nice payoff but it could use a flashback sequence to tie it back better. There are times when the connective tissue is missing."
Doctor Zhivago,9,1,1,19 February 2014," Grand sweeping romantic epic and it's good
",This is a Russian epic before and around the time of the revolution. Doctor Yury Zhivago (Omar Sharif) is a surgeon and a poet. Lara (Julie Christie) is a sweet naive girl beholden to the wealthy Victor Komarovsky (Rod Steiger). Pasha (Tom Courtenay) is a revolutionary in love with Lara who would become a powerful man. Yury marries Tonya (Geraldine Chaplin) but he's drawn to Lara. Yury is sympathetic to the revolution at first but is soon overwhelmed.Can a song make a movie? Maurice Jarre's 'Lara's Theme' certainly comes close. It expresses the vast romanticism of the story. David Lean's Russian epic is very long and very epic. It is old fashion Hollywood grand. The great actors are able to lift the melodramatic material to its epic proportions. It's almost 200 minutes of big romance and it doesn't drag for me. That's a big accomplishment.
U-571,5,0,3,3 September 2014," Lots of water and lots of action
","In the spring of 1942, the U-boats are taking a toll on Allies shipping. The Allies need to capture an Enigma machine and code books without the Germans knowing it's gone. Lt. Tyler (Matthew McConaughey) thinks he deserves his own command. However there's a special mission for him to use an old U-boat to pose as the resupply boat to capture a disabled German U-boat and steal their intel before they can destroy it. Lt. Cmdr. Dahlgren (Bill Paxton)is the skipper. Lt. Hirsch (Jake Weber) is a German speaker with the special mission. Maj. Coonan (David Keith) is naval intelligence. Just when they succeed in capturing a disabled U-boat, their boat is attacked and sunk leaving them a crippled boat in enemy waters but they can't contact home or else the Germans will know that their codes are compromised. Harvey Keitel, Jon Bon Jovi, Erik Palladino and Will Estes play some of the crew.The action gets pretty good. It's big with lots of water and explosions. However it never gets beyond a Hollywood version of a submarine movie. It has its good points. The acting is alright but McConaughey is a little overwhelmed. There is a little too much big acting going on. Everything is done at the highest level of drama. It's very bombastic and doesn't spend a lot of time taking a breather. It's like a heavy meal of junk food that is soon forgotten."
The Shining,8,4,10,17 October 2014," creepiness that haunts
","Jack Torrance (Jack Nicholson) is a former teacher trying to do some writing. He gets a job to watch the Overlook Hotel for the winter with his wife Wendy (Shelley Duvall) and child Danny. Danny has an imaginary friend and premonitions of future horrors. The family arrives at the hotel just as it is closing up. Danny continues to have visions. The chef Dick Hallorann is able to communicate with Danny telepathically. Dick calls this 'shining'. Danny asks about room 237 and Dick tells him to stay out. A month later, Jack's writing is going nowhere and he's growing more distance.As a horror, this is not scary. It doesn't make you turn away from the screen. There is not a thrilling drama or an exciting action movie. This is simply art and nothing less. Director Stanley Kubrick is impeccable in his vision. It imparts a mood of foreboding. There is a feeling of wrongness about every scene of this movie. It makes the audience uneasy. There is a creepiness that haunts."
"I, Robot",6,1,2,25 October 2013," Could have been more than a popcorn flick
","It's 2035, robots are everywhere in people's lives. Chicago Police Detective Del Spooner (Will Smith) is not a fan of robots due to something that happened in the past. He's sent to investigate the murder of Dr. Alfred Lanning (James Cromwell) the top robot scientist at U.S. Robotics. Spooner believes that a new NS-5 robot killed him, but the three laws of robotics make it impossible. Company scientist Susan Calvin (Bridget Moynahan) can't believe him until all heck breaks loose.This is a movie derived from Isaac Asimov ideas, but turned into little more than a popcorn summer flick. It's yet another Will Smith blockbuster but it could have been so much more. The three laws were never introduced properly. They were just listed like so many assembly instructions. This is a big disservice because it's integral to the twist ending. The action and the CG are fun and impressive. I just wish this was more than a simple mechanical thriller."
Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse,8,1,4,23 February 2019," loving Miles
","Peter Parker has been happily the one and only Spider-Man saving the city over and over again for the last ten years. Miles Morales hates his new school although he is taken with fellow new student Gwen Stacy. His policeman father tries to keep him away from troubled Uncle Aaron. He stumbles upon a battle between Spider-Man and Wilson Fisk with his henchmen, Green Goblin and Prowler. A portal is opened between the Spider-Verse.I really like Miles Morales. He's great with Gwen Stacy. The hair bit is hilarious. I'm over the moon for the first act. My first instinct is to have Jake Johnson play both Peter Parker. He's better acting as a slacker but if he could play the first Peter Parker, it would more compelling to see the change. The other issue is Gwen Stacy. She shows up before the incident. The movie explains it away as time travel but it would be better if it simply switched a couple of scenes. Overall, this is fun, imaginative, and glorious animation. It is also a great introduction to different Spider characters and holds potential for the live action movie world."
American Beauty,9,1,3,31 January 2014," Obsessions and secrets in Suburbia
","Lester Burnham (Kevin Spacey) is enduring a cold marriage. His wife (Annette Bening) is obsessed with her real estate career. He is obsessed with his daughter's sexy friend Angela (Mena Suvari). His daughter Jane (Thora Birch) is the object of obsession by the next door neighbor boy Ricky (Wes Bentley). Ricky has a domineering angry military father (Chris Cooper), and he sells weed.Director Sam Mendes and writer Alan Ball have captured the mood of obsessions and secrets in suburbia. This plays like a voyeuristic peep show as the characters peel back the layers of secrets. It's not creepy but it is enchanting. This movie lures you in, and traps you in something forbidden. Kevin Spacey is absolutely wonderful as a torn man. And Thora Birch is great as the angry daughter. It's the perverse mundaneness of suburbia and its many secrets."
BASEketball,5,1,2,30 September 2013," Nice idea, some funny jokes, inferior actors
","The athletic world is full of corruption, apathy, and commercialism. Two childhood loser friends Joe Cooper (Trey Parker) and Doug Remer (Matt Stone) invent a hybrid sport at first to win against a couple of jocks. When it takes off in the neighborhood, a billionaire Ted Denslow (Ernest Borgnine) uses his vast wealth to spread it across the country.Trey Parker and Matt Stone are poor actors. They may write good jokes but they can't deliver them. This is a pretty good idea. There are some hilarious jokes. Sometimes they're even done well. But the two writers can't make it sing on the screen.The premise of over commercialism in sports is admirable. But it seems disingenuous when the money they use to build the game comes from somebody else. It's like a teenager railing against wall street when he hasn't worked a day in his life. If they kept it as a driveway game, it would be a lot better. Then when commercialism comes in, that's when the stadium comes into play.It's a nice interesting idea. The guys write some hilarious jokes. But it's not thought through all the way. And the guys are bad performers."
Over the Hedge,6,0,0,4 January 2014," Fine Slapstick animation
","RJ the raccoon (Bruce Willis) is a schemer. When he finds the bear's stash of food, he tries to steal it. However things go wrong, and everything is lost. Now the bear expects RJ to replace the lost or else. RJ finds a group of scroungers, and plans to use them to get food from the surrounding suburbs.The animation is a bit blocky, but it's an acceptable level. There is a lot of slapstick humor. It's like a Looney Tunes cartoon at times. The one thing that is missing is a break out character or two. Maybe there are too many characters. Maybe the characters look too generic. For an animated movie like this, it's always better to have a break out character. There are opportunities to add characters in any follow up sequels.It's a perfectly fine slapstick animated comedy. The problem is that it doesn't stand out. There are great comedic voice work especially from the unique Wanda Sykes. But it's not enough to warrant any follow up to this."
The Alamo,6,0,1,2 September 2015," the action is good
","In 1835, Sam Houston (Dennis Quaid) tries to rally people to Texas. William Barret Travis (Patrick Wilson) is given command of the Alamo. He faces Santa Anna with a smaller force even with the arrival of ex-congressman David Crockett (Billy Bob Thornton) and other volunteers. The movie continues after the Alamo and ends with Santa Anna's defeat at the Battle of San Jacinto.There is a mass of historical characters being gathered here. It would probably help to center the movie on one non-historical character. There are too many characters that need their 15 minutes. There are some good action scenes but the movie is too old fashion to be compelling as a modern film."
Wanted,6,0,3,23 March 2014," Hard to swallow taking the loom targets on faith alone
","A thousand years ago, a clan of weavers became assassins for good calling themselves the Fraternity. Wesley Gibson (James McAvoy) is a loser office drone. Then Fox (Angelina Jolie) saves him from an assassin. She tells him that he comes from a long line of assassins and somebody is trying to kill him.As much as Wesley finds the world so annoying that he needed to be medicated, that's how I felt about the visual style at first. Director Timur Bekmambetov does a too good of a job portraying Wesley's anxiety. The action is uniquely ADD. It's fun until it's not. McAvoy is playing the runt of the litter. He's a great actor, but his character complains too much. Jolie is the cool killer, and Morgan Freeman is the wise sen-sai. As for the loom idea, it's a tough pill to swallow. At least Dexter investigates his targets before killing them."
Warrior,8,1,3,18 August 2013," breakout performances
","Tommy (Tom Hardy) becomes an internet sensation as a MMA fighter. He is estranged from his father Paddy Conlon (Nick Nolte) who is a recovering alcoholic. His older brother Brendan Conlon (Joel Edgerton) is a teacher struggling to make ends meet for his wife Tess (Jennifer Morrison) and their two girls.Joel Edgerton and Tom Hardy have already done some good work but this movie really showcases their talents with these staring roles. They truly inhabit their roles. They play brothers in a broken down family. They get into the world of Mixed Maritial Arts, and end up facing each other. The action is good. The fighting is fine. But it's the acting and the brotherhood/family dysfunction that is the real stand out. It represent a true validation of not only their physical attributes but their acting abilities."
Judgment at Nuremberg,7,0,0,12 March 2014," Important movie with historical value
","It's 1948. Chief Judge Dan Haywood (Spencer Tracy) has just arrived at Nuremberg to preside over a trial against various defendants including former Minister of Justice Dr. Ernst Janning (Burt Lancaster) who was a well respected jurist before the Nazis. The big names are all gone. It's not a much sought after job to judge the lesser known names. He's staying at a house owned by Mrs. Bertholt (Marlene Dietrich). The prosecutor for the case is Col. Tad Lawson (Richard Widmark). The defense is led by Hans Rolfe (Maximilian Schell).This is an important movie of historical value. At a running time of over 3 hours, its rather slow prodding pace takes away much of the drama. The acting from the leads are superb. I give this movie an extra point for a realistic slice of history. This movie isn't as concerned about pacing as much as it's concerned about the subject. It's more a history lesson than a thriller drama."
Madagascar: Escape 2 Africa,8,2,3,29 September 2013," Much better than the original
","The gang try to leave Madagascar and fly back to New York. Of course, the penguins' plane completely falls apart and they crash land in Africa. There they are reunited with Alex's family.This is a much better movie than the original. There are more penguin screen time. The jokes are funnier. It's a brighter happier movie. This time around, there is no more of that uncomfortable predator prey relationship.The family aspect of Alex's story is just much more compelling and much more poignant. The idea of him trying to fit into his father's expectations. There are big ideas here."
Terminator 2: Judgment Day,10,0,0,7 November 2013," Great action and much more
","The future John Connor has sent a T-101 (Arnold Schwarzenegger) to protect the teenage John Connor (Edward Furlong) from the most advanced Terminator ever, the T-1000 (Robert Patrick). It's mimetic poly-alloy material allow it to mimic anything it touches. John must retrieve his mother Sarah Connor (Linda Hamilton) from the psychiatric hospital.The CG T-1000 is the most advanced FX of its times. For the rest, it is all real action. It still looks exciting and hasn't aged too badly. James Cameron has pushed the envelop to the limits. This is not simply Terminator on steroids. Cameron has added a lot of humor, and also heart. The T-101 is more a father figure to John Connor. And Sarah Connor's tough love really adds to the heartbreak. And the central idea that the future is still their's to create. All of it makes this more than a simple shoot 'em up movie. This is one of the best sequel ever."
Dangal,8,0,1,12 July 2018," one of the best from Bollywood
","Mahavir Singh Phogat is a former Indian national champion wrestler. With no support from the government, he failed to get an international gold medal for his country but hoped to be redeemed by a son. He is disillusioned after getting four daughters and no sons. Even the Gods have turned against him. Then neighborhood parents complain that Mahavir's daughters Geeta and Babita had beaten up their boys. He is inspired to train them for girls' wrestling.This is based on the real family of wrestlers. As soon as he had the first daughter, it seems obvious where this is going. For an hour, this is a formulaic underdog sports movie. At that point, my main complaints are that it uses way too many montages and I thought cutting the girls' hair is a step too far. It follows the formula well and the characters are appealing. It's a solid sports movie. Then the movie keeps going and going. The darn thing is almost three hours and unlike other Bollywood movies, there are no long song and dance sequences. The story takes another step and the relationships get deeper. There is a fight between father and daughter that is tense and emotional. It takes the movie to a higher level. Even the hair has a nice payoff later on. The wrestling at the end is compelling. This is one of the better movies from Bollywood."
Heartbreak Ridge,6,2,3,8 March 2014," Clint Eastwood does John Wayne
","Highway (Clint Eastwood) is a hard-nosed Korean and Vietnam war veteran. After the latest drunken rampage, he gets his wish and gets sent back to the Second Recon Battalion, Second Marine Division. His new CO is the strict arrogant Major Powers (Everett McGill) who has never seen conflict. He's given a bunch of malcontents to lead. His platoon leader is the nerdy bookish Lt. Ring (Boyd Gaines). He needs to get his squad into shape and then they are sent into Grenada to rescue university students.Director Clint Eastwood breaks out all the clichÃ©s. He does it well. It is all gung ho militaristic rah rah. The most memorable part of the movie is the T-shirt bit. It's a relatively fine John Wayne movie. It's not really trying to be more."
Salt,7,1,3,23 September 2013," Great action, convoluted story, to be continued
","Evelyn Salt (Angelina Jolie) is a CIA agent and her boss is Ted Winter (Liev Schreiber). Suddenly she is suspected of being a double agent who will assassinate the President of Russia.It has a 'No Way Out' feel to the beginning and turn to some Jason Bourne stuff. The plot is convoluted full of double dealing double agents. The fact that we don't know Salt's loyalties and history at the start makes it hard to root for her. It's best not to be too concern about the plot, and just enjoy the action. The ending finishes with an obvious nod to a sequel. In fact it doesn't really end which dilutes the power of the climax. The climax is already too stretched out with a big pause where a lot of explaining is done. The to-be-continued ending doesn't help."
Walk Hard: The Dewey Cox Story,7,0,0,3 December 2014," sly deadly skewering of the music bio
","In 1946 Springberry, Alabama, Dewey Cox accidentally chop his brother Nate in half with a machete. As a teenager, Dewey (John C. Reilly) gains local success but he's condemned for playing Satan music. His father kicks him out leaving with his 12 year old girlfriend Edith (Kristen Wiig). It's hard. It's a long, hard walk. He will Walk Hard.It's a fun mockbio. It's mostly sharp deadpan comedy. John C. Reilly is great. It spoofs all the big clichés. Judd Apatow and Jake Kasdan skewered the music bio genre with this script. It's just great and nothing is off limits. It's not over the top spoof like the Abrahams and Zucker or worst the Wayans. Reilly is playing Dewey Cox almost straight but just dumb. The ridiculous stuff happens to him. It may hit wrong for the audience because they're expecting wild ridiculous spoof. It's a little different than that."
Duck Soup,9,3,6,6 July 2015," Classic Marx Brothers
","The nation of Freedonia is in dire financial situation and wealthy widow Mrs. Teasdale is willing to help if only Rufus T. Firefly (Groucho Marx) is appointed the new leader. Sylvanian Ambassador Trentino and Raquel Torres are trying to incite a revolt. Sylania sends Chicolini (Chico Marx) and Pinky (Harpo Marx) as spies. Firefly appoints Chicolini as Secretary of War. As the crazy situation spins out of control, war is declared between Freedonia and Sylvania.Groucho is relentless in his fast rolling jokes. It comes so fast that it's impossible to laugh at it all. Harpo is pure slapstick genius. This is pure comedic chaos. There is the great mirror scene between Groucho and Chico. It's not simply mirroring. It's that they go beyond and start changing places. It is simply a classic and so is this movie."
We're the Millers,7,3,6,22 August 2013," Good 'Family' Movie
","After being robbed, pot dealer David (Jason Sudeikis) is forced by his boss (Ed Helms) to go to Mexico to pick up a load of marijuana. In order to improve his odds of making it past the border, David asks the broke stripper Rose (Jennifer Aniston), hopelessly naive neighbor kid (Will Poulter) and homeless girl (Emma Roberts) to join him and pretend they're on a family holiday.The 4 strangers have a fun road trip and grow to become a family unit. This is yet another inappropriate road trip movie. There are some hilarious moments and the group has fun chemistry. My only minor complaint is that Jennifer Aniston is more MILF than enjeunue. Yet she's being played as a next hot thing. It reminded me of Demi Moore in Striptease. Is Aniston doing a striptease truly that big of a deal anymore? If they didn't play it up so much, it'd work out a lot better."
Apocalypse Now,10,0,3,1 January 2014," Iconic, Original, Impossible to Forget
","Captain Willard (Martin Sheen) is given an assignment to eliminate renegade and possibly insane Colonel Kurtz (Marlon Brando). He takes a Navy PBR and her crew up the Nung River to find Kurtz's base in Cambodia.This is a vision of nightmare that I could never forget. More than any other movie, there are scenes here that are seared into my memory. Rarely do I give 10/10. This is one movie where I gave a 10 without reservations. There are more iconic, original and impressive scenes here than any modern movie. There is no CGI, just real movie making. Director Francis Ford Coppola used his reputation after the two Godfather movies, and risked it all for this movie. You can tell he left it all on the screen."
The Battle of Algiers,9,1,2,21 February 2014," Great and important movie
","It's from 1954 onwards in Algeria and there's revolution in the air. This docudrama takes on history from both sides. Col. Mathieu leads the french forces. They are using all methods to try to stop this french colony from the hands of the revolutionaries. On the other side, Ali is an illiterate hustler always in trouble with the cops. He is recruited into the revolutionaries after spending 5 months in prison.This is most notable for how realistic this movie is. Taking the era into account, this is taking realism to the next level. It is so real that everybody should be reminded that this is all fictional. This was shot in the real locations, but all of it was staged. It is unflinching in its depiction. That is its greatest asset."
Disturbia,8,1,2,9 March 2015," great Rear Window vibe
","While driving home from a fishing trip, Kale Brecht (Shia LaBeouf) gets into a car accident which kills his father. One year later, a despondent Kale punches his Spanish teacher and gets 3 months under house arrest. His mother Julie (Carrie-Anne Moss) takes away his video games. His best friend Ronnie (Aaron Yoo) is in Hawaii. With nothing to do, he starts spying on his sexy neighbor Ashley Carlson (Sarah Roemer). By the time Ronnie is back, Kale has mapped out his entire neighborhood. He notices suspicious things at Robert Turner (David Morse) next door. There are news reports of missing girls. Ronnie and Ashley join him in the stakeout.I love the 'Rear Window' vibe which is one of my favorite movies. It's a different route to the same place. Shia has an easy charm about him. Aaron is a great slacker friend. Sarah Roemer has a friendly sexiness. The trio has good chemistry together. David Morse is creepy as hell and the scene in the car with Roemer is hair raising. The ending runs on a little too long. I would have prefer not to spend more time in Turner's underground dungeon. It feels heavy handed from a slasher movie which is different from the rest of the movie. If it stays in the Brecht house, there would have been a tight high intensity ending."
The Patriot,4,14,26,17 November 2013," bad history vs big action
","It's 1776 South Carolina. Benjamin Martin (Mel Gibson) is a war hero and living in peace on his plantation. His son Gabriel (Heath Ledger) joins the Continental Army without his permission. After a battle, he treats his son Gabriel, and both Regulars and Colonials. The brutal Colonel William Tavington (Jason Isaacs) burns down his plantation and kills his son Thomas (Gregory Smith). This drives him to seek revenge.Should I ignore the bad history and enjoy the big action? That's the question here. I can ignore demonizing the Brits, or the cartoon villain. Maybe they didn't burn down a church. Maybe the characters are cartoons. Who cares? That's going to happen in any war movie. What I can't stomach is portrayal of slavery. They try to sidestep the issue by proclaiming all the blacks working on the plantation are actually free men. It really rang hollow. I rolled my eyes and tried to move on.The action is terrific. One thing Roland Emmerich knows is big time action. He doesn't disappoint. I could still side with big action. It's still fun and games. The real Martin be damn. But every time a black person gets a scene, or blacks get a mention, the whole movie grinds up against reality. The movie tries desperately to excuse it away, and it's an awkward attempt every time.Mel Gibson tries to Braveheart the American revolution. The problem is they run into the problem of slavery. While its good to root for the underdog Scots in Braveheart, the ignored underdog in this movie are actually the slaves. This movie tries to sidestep it and gentrify it up for modern mass consumption. But at some point, the issue cannot be ignored. I've got to say bad history wins out over big action."
Edward Scissorhands,10,1,1,8 February 2014," Unique vision of Tim Burton
","Peg (Dianne Wiest) discovers a lone boy Edward (Johnny Depp) in the hill top mansion. He's been left alone after the death of his creator (Vincent Price). He has massive scissors for hands. Peg takes Edward into her own home. He later becomes infatuated with Peg's teen daughter Kim (Winona Ryder). At first, the neighbors are mostly fascinated by him with the exception of Esmeralda (O-Lan Jones) and Kim's boyfriend Jim (Anthony Michael Hall).Tim Burton is an original. His vision is like no others. Johnny Depp is once again a great enigmatic lead just like 'What's Eating Gilbert Grape' 3 years later. He is truly adorably damaged. It also speaks to the conformity of the suburbs and our acceptance of the outsider. It is a movie with heart and wonder. There is no movie like it."
Silver Linings Playbook,8,3,5,3 August 2013," good rom-com with mental illness
","Pat Solitano (Bradley Cooper) lives with his father Patrizio (Robert De Niro) and mother Dolores (Jacki Weaver) after a stay at a mental hospital. His friend Danny McDaniels (Chris Tucker) is also a patient. He is introduced to depressed widower Tiffany Maxwell (Jennifer Lawrence) who is dealing by having casual sex. He reluctantly agrees to join her in a dance competition.As a rom-com, it's fun and functional. Cooper and Lawrence are two performers overflowing with charm. As a family drama dealing with mental illness, it doesn't hurt to have De Niro. As a comedy, it's got a few good laughs. What puts it over the top is Jennifer Lawrence. She's electric as soon as she shows up in the movie. She has some great exchanges with Bradley Cooper.If there is any complaint, it's that there seems to be some missing scenes that's usually needed in rom-com. The movie is already 2hrs long, so I can understand some scenes were trimmed. The deleted scenes section has the necessary bits. Check it out. This is definitely worthy of recommendation."
Van Helsing,3,0,1,7 May 2004," I laughed... I cried... but I don't think I'm supposed to.
","Doctor Victor Frankenstein creates his monster. The village mob is at the gates. Count Dracula and his three brides arrive to take Frankenstein's scientific conquest over God. He kills Frankenstein and leaves the windmill in fiery ruins. Anna Valerious (Kate Beckinsale) and her brother Velkan are hunting a werewolf when Velkan is thrown off a cliff. Van Helsing (Hugh Jackman) kills Mr. Hyde and has become the most wanted killer in Europe. His next assignment from a secret Catholic order is to hunt down Dracula. In a battle with Dracula's brides, he is joined by Anna.This is one of those movies that are SO over the top, that it is difficult to criticize. Although, I certainly will try. The action is non-stop, the acting is atrocious, and the story is completely convoluted. The accents by the actors are so bad that it was laughable. At times, I actually did laugh. The brides are wild. They seem to be channeling old style acting from the silent era horrors.I do have to give the movie credit. It doesn't care. As the movie gets more silly, the action piles on. It gets crazier and it's a mess. The CGI is non-stop. I watched this in the theater with a group of friends and nobody liked it. We were left shaking our heads in exasperation."
Divergent,6,0,2,4 February 2015," I don't buy this world
","In future Chicago, the inhabitants have fenced off the city and split society into five factions. Abnegation is selfless and put in charge of the government. Amity is the cheerfully peaceful farm workers. Candor is honest. Dauntless is the wild brave protector. Erudite is the intelligent scientists. Those who don't belong are forced to live as Factionless. Beatrice Prior (Shailene Woodley) lives as an Abnegation with her family. She is about to choose her lifelong Fraction in the Choosing Ceremony. Tori (Maggie Q) gives her a test and tells her that she's Divergent meaning she has more than one element in her. It's something that must be hidden. She switches Fraction to Dauntless and trained by Four (Theo James). There is a dark scheme underway by Erudite leader Jeanine (Kate Winslet).The phrase that keeps coming to my mind is 'I don't buy this world.' Every revelation led me to question the origins of this world. This future world seems weakly drawn. I also don't buy the motivations of Dauntless leadership. I like some of the characters and willing to buy their stories. It's not the best of the young adult friction but it works enough to continue."
Ender's Game,5,1,4,14 February 2014," High Concept, Big CGI, but unconvincing
","It's been 50 years since the Earth was attacked by an alien race called Formics. The human race survived by a single act of heroism. Now earth has gathered the most gifted children to train for commanding an earth fleet to annihilate the aliens with a super weapon.There are a lot of great things in this movie. The CGI effects look great. There is a really fun looking zero G training game. I would love to play it in real life. It looks insanely fun. The actors do a good job especially the kids Asa Butterfield and Hailee Steinfeld. Harrison Ford plays the hard nose trainer. The best adult actor is Ben Kingsley with the wild facial tattoo. As for the battle, it all feels very removed. It has the playing-a-video-game quality. It doesn't lend itself for intensity. It looks amazing, but it doesn't feel exciting.The story is trying to mind bend the audience with a crazy moral argument. It does it ham fisted and oddly. Instead of poignant or compelling, it's head scratching and confused. The idea is a little too academic and has little use in reality. If the book was about this one idea, then it fails. 'Hunger Games' asks a similar morality question infinitely better. This is a high concept movie with big budget CGI and soon forgotten."
The White Ribbon,7,0,2,14 February 2015," hard cold mood
",It's pre-WWI in a small German village. An unnamed man recalls strange incidents when he was the village school teacher. Someone had strung a near-invisible wire between two trees. The doctor is hospitalized after his horse trips on the wire in his regular ride. Then a tenant farmer woman falls to her death in an industrial accident. The village is a strict harsh place. The puritanical pastor punishes his children with a cane and ties white ribbons on his children as a reminder of their need to keep their purity. The strange incidents continue. The movie ends with the start of the first World War.I would have liked the movie follows one single lead as he/she experiences and investigates these strange incidences. The black and white photography is beautiful. The cold everyday violence is interesting. The movie portrays a very effective hard oppressive mood. However it is a lot of mood but very little drive. Sure this is not the regular North American movie but I just want to follow the police investigating these incidences. It feels somehow distant to follow the various villagers and the narration.
Monsters vs. Aliens,7,6,9,31 October 2013," Nice team chemistry
","Susan Murphy (Reese Witherspoon) is a woman who got upsized by a meteorite on her wedding day. B.O.B. (Seth Rogen) is a gelatinous, brainless creation after an experiment on a tomato went wrong. Dr. Cockroach (Hugh Laurie) is a scientist who turned himself into a hybrid. The Missing Link (Will Arnett) is a creature found frozen and revived. And giant mutant larva Insectosaurus is a product of nuclear testing. The government has secretly collected these monster and now they need them to fight alien Gallaxhar (Rainn Wilson).DreamWorks has gathered all the iconic 50s sci-fi B-movie creations, and formed a pretty cohesive team. It's surprising that the limited backstory allowed the characters to gel so well right off the bat. It's probably due the fact that these characters seem so familiar to us. It also helps that the actors do some great voice work.The story itself has one major problem. The movie is basically split in two parts. The pacing slows down dramatically in the middle after a high intensity fight at the start. However the comedy works well especially the brainless BOB. I think this team has good potential."
Save the Last Dance,6,0,2,25 November 2015," formulaic start turns melodramatic
",Ballet dancer Sara Johnson (Julia Stiles) begs her mother to attend her Julliard School audition. She is heart-broken when her mother dies in a car crash rushing to her audition. She is forced to live with her estranged father Roy (Terry Kinney) in the rough part of Chicago. The school is almost all-black. She befriends teen mom Chenille Reynolds (Kerry Washington) but doesn't get along with her brother Derek (Sean Patrick Thomas) ... at first.It starts as a pretty simple formulaic story offering many clichés of an inner-city neighborhood. Julia Stiles could be a little softer in the beginning but her character is closed off from the tragedy. Her chemistry with Thomas is functional. It's always surprising to rediscover that somebody like Kerry Washington was a major supporting actress. The movie does offer sincere melodramatic turns. I wouldn't call this realism. It's sincere star-crossed lovers in the ghetto.
Hansel & Gretel: Witch Hunters,6,0,2,11 December 2013," wild violent good time if you're so inclined
","Siblings Hansel (Jeremy Renner) & Gretel (Gemma Arterton) are sent out into the woods. They get taken by a witch, but are able to kill her. They'd grow up to be famous witch hunters. Many children have gone missing in and around the German town of Augsburg. The mayor brings in Hansel & Gretel to battle the witches and save the kids.This is super violent, ultra-unrealistic, banging action movie. It's a blood splattering good time if you're so inclined. Renner and Arterton are mostly playing it for serious. This is possibly the major missing piece. It needs comedy to put it over the top. The action is ridiculous already. Just add a comedian to do some ridiculous jokes. Just make sure you don't bring the kids. This is no kids' fable. It's about killing ugly witches in every ugly way."
The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo,8,2,5,8 September 2013," David Fincher Recreates
","David Fincher is able to recreate the first of the Swedish hit trilogy based on the novels. The style is similar with the Swedish original. It's got the cold blue tone, and the same desolate morality. It hasn't been transplanted to anywhere else. In fact, it's basically kept the whole thing intact with the exception of the actors. Daniel Craig is a Hollywood choice to be the journalist. Of course, he's 007. Sure he's hot. So when Lisbeth Salander (Rooney Mara) sleeps with him, it is less about his personality and a little more about his James Bond body. But it's to be expected for a Hollywood remake. Rooney Mara is just not as intense as Noomi Rapace. Rooney is a skinny girly actress with some good acting skills. She has just enough to play the anger. But Noomi has more. The original Lisbeth was a true discovery.I hate to compare the two, but they are so close that they're begging to be compared. Overall I liked the Swedish one slightly more but just very slightly. Some of that probably is due to the fact that I saw that one first. David Fincher does a great job of recreating the original."
Rocky IV,5,1,3,8 September 2014," Classic 80s cheese
","After beating Clubber Lang, Rocky Balboa (Sylvester Stallone) is content with the easy life. Ivan Drago (Dolph Lundgren) is the undefeated heavyweight world amateur champion from the Soviet Union. He is going into the pros and Apollo Creed (Carl Weathers) is itching to take on the challenge. Rocky advises against it but he stays by Apollo's side. Drago cold-heartedly kills Apollo in the ring when Rocky is unable to throw the towel in. Rocky climbs into the ring to avenge his friend's death and is even willing to go the Soviet Union. Also starring Brigitte Nielsen as Drago's wife. Talia Shire and Burt Young return once again.This is high 80s cheese or low camp depending on your perspective. James Brown is performing 'Living in America'. There's even the Gorbachev double who starts the slow clap. Dolph Lundgren and Brigitte Nielsen look like superhuman specimens. Apollo's death is the only good drama in this. The rest is nothing more than formula."

","Curtis Taylor Jr. (Jamie Foxx) is a hustler car salesman who weasel his way into managing the naive Dreamettes; Deena Jones (Beyoncé Knowles), Effie White (Jennifer Hudson), and Lorrell Robinson (Anika Noni Rose). They start singing backup for James 'Thunder' Early (Eddie Murphy) who is a womanizing James Brown type. Then Curtis schemes and hustle his way into a record empire.The production feels very Broadway. The songs are not always good. The best thing in the movie is the performance of Jennifer Hudson as the brassy Effie White. Eddie Murphy does good dramatic work in support. Without the break out performance of Hudson, this is just a show tune Broadway show with big singing voices. She puts in a powerful performance, and it would have been great to see an Effie White movie."
In the Name of the Father,8,3,3,16 December 2014," Incredible father and son story
","It's 1974. The IRA bombs a pub in Guildford, England. Gerry Conlon (Daniel Day-Lewis) is an aimless petty thief. His father Giuseppe (Pete Postlethwaite) is a straight-arrow soft-spoken man. He and his friend Paul Hill (John Lynch) are in London staying with hippies. They leave the flat when the pub bombing happens. A prostitute drops her keys and Gerry breaks in. The parliament passes the Prevention of Terrorism Act which allows for suspects to be held for 7 days. Gerry, Paul and others are arrested and coerced into false confessions. Giuseppe and other relatives are also implicated. The actual bomber Joe McAndrew (Don Baker) is arrested and tells the police. However the police refuses to admit its mistake. Gerry befriends Joe in prison while ignoring the peaceful faith of his father. Joe becomes the leader of the prison as Giuseppe declines in health. British attorney Gareth Peirce (Emma Thompson) works to free the falsely imprisoned. After Joe burns the lead guard, Gerry saves him and turns on Joe.This is a meticulous telling of a compelling life wrongly convicted. It's a bit up and down at times. The first trial is not the most compelling. The results are preordained and not that compelling. The most compelling is the father son relationship. When Joe get into the middle, it's a great turn in the story. These are two great performances from Daniel Day-Lewis and Pete Postlethwaite. The two of them in prison is a terrific movie filled with emotions and character growth. The final court case is theatrical as heck."

","Unemployed puppeteer Craig Schwartz (John Cusack) and animal lover Lotte Schwartz (Cameron Diaz) are in a loveless marriage. Craig gets a job on the low ceiling 7½ floor of a Manhattan office building. He falls for alluring fellow worker Maxine Lund (Catherine Keener) who doesn't return the feelings. He finds a doorway in his office that leads into the mind of John Malkovich. After 15 minutes, the person is ejected into a ditch on the New Jersey Turnpike. Maxine decides to sell tickets at $200 a pop. Lotte is completely changed by the experience and thinks she's a transsexual. Craig's boss Dr. Lester is obsessed with Malkovich.This is one of the strangest and most compelling ideas ever put on the screen written by Charlie Kaufman and directed by Spike Jonze. It is exciting that everything and everyone is a little off in this movie. Cameron Diaz is ugly. John Cusack is disheveled. Catherine Keener is a sex goddess. The whole movie is off its axis and so much the better for it. It's so weird that it's a lot of fun."

","Andy Stitzer (Steve Carell) is hopelessly single at 40 working as a tech guy at an electronic store. He has no game with the ladies and no experience with sex. His co-workers David (Paul Rudd), Cal (Seth Rogen), and Jay (Romany Malco) reluctantly asks him to join their poker game. During the game, Andy let slip that he has never had sex. The guys make fun of him but then vows to get him laid. They give contradictory and generally bad advise. At a club, he goes home with Nicky (Leslie Mann) who is crazy drunk. Trish (Catherine Keener) comes into the store to buy a VCR. She has a storefront across the street selling other people's stuff on Ebay. Marla (Kat Dennings) is one of her kids. Cal tells him to keep asking questions to be mysterious and that works on bookstore clerk Beth (Elizabeth Banks).There are a lot of awkward hilarity coming from this Judd Apatow comedy. Steve Carell especially with that haircut is perfect for the role. There is nothing more painfully funny than Kelly Clarkson. At its heart, Carell is an adorable dork. The other guys are almost as ridiculous. That is why this works so well. There are so many great comedians working with such a funny idea."
Face_Off,6,0,2,29 December 2013," Best John Woo action
","Sean Archer (John Travolta) is an FBI agent who is tracking down super villain Castor Troy (Nicolas Cage). Sean is a bit too absent from his wife (Joan Allen) and daughter (Dominique Swain). After capturing Castor and his brother Pollux Troy (Alessandro Nivola), they find a plan for a massive nerve gas bomb. Pollux refuses to talk to anybody but his brother Castor. That's when they come up with a plan to switch faces, but it all backfires.This is the pinnacle of ridiculousness that is John Woo. And he's loving every bit of it. The action is ridiculous. The story is ridiculous. The science is ridiculous. And most of all, it doesn't matter. John Woo is about big action, lots of gun, and pointing guns at each other without firing. For John Woo fans, it really doesn't get much better than this.The actors do have to play two polar opposite parts. It's probably not as difficult as one imagines. It's just a matter of keeping track. Both Travolta and Cage do two perfectly sound performances."
The Men Who Stare at Goats,6,1,3,12 December 2015," quirky dark comedy
","Bob Wilton (Ewan McGregor) is a small town reporter told to interview psychic Gus Lacey (Stephen Root). Gus claims to have been in a special psychic unit in the U.S. Army. They were trained to kill psychically and one time they killed a goat by staring at it. Bob's wife (Rebecca Mader) leaves him for his editor. During the Iraq war, he's stuck in Kuwait waiting for permission where he meets Lyn Cassady (George Clooney). Gus had previously mentioned Lyn as the skipper of the secret unit. After getting shot in Vietnam, Bill Django (Jeff Bridges) started investigating other ways to fight wars. Years of living with hippies leads him to start the New Earth Army. Larry Hooper (Kevin Spacey) is intend on using the findings for the dark side.The movie takes the quirky material and adds very little. The actors are sincere. Bridges brings a little bit of his inner Lebowski. Clooney is a little manic. McGregor is the wide-eye semi-loser. The characters are likable enough but the movie lacks bigger laughs. It's a lot of quirky stuff. It's not real enough to be compelling and it's not surreal enough to be fun. It's on the same path as Dr Strangelove but it's nowhere near as good. Director Grant Heslov is a relative novice and this needs better talents like the Coen brothers to pull it together."
Mission: Impossible - Rogue Nation,8,0,4,17 March 2016," franchise getting better than ever

Mysterious Ilsa Faust (Rebecca Ferguson) helps him escape but is also working for the Syndicate. With the help of Benji Dunn (Simon Pegg) and Luther Stickell (Ving Rhames), Hunt works to take down Lane and the Syndicate.This is a franchise that is getting better and better. The story works well. It's pretty simple with prerequisite twists. This is basically the new Bond franchise. Everybody works great in this one. Cruise is terrific and Pegg is funny. Renner has settled into the second banana spot. Rhames could be given more to do. Baldwin is a good addition but the best is Rebecca Ferguson. She kicks and acts too. She plays a compelling character and has great chemistry with Cruise. One can't wait for the next one."
She's the Man,6,0,0,15 February 2014," Stupider version of Shakespearian play
","Based loosely on Shakespeare's 'Twelfth Night or What You Will', this is teen farce. Viola (Amanda Bynes) is a good soccer player, but her team gets cut. Her brother Sebastian is running away to London with his band for two weeks. So she decides to impersonate him to join the boy's team at Sebastian's new school.The convoluted Shakespearian love triangle has a bit of fun. Amanda Bynes was still funny back then. She has the mannerisms and comic timing. Amanda definitely needs a shorter haircut to play the boy part. That wig looks really bad. It has Channing Tatum as the hunky soccer player, but he overplays the bumbling part. He looks stupid doing it. It's the lightest of farce. It's all very silly. Reason be damn. It does have a good jokes every once in awhile. This is not going to win any awards, but maybe it'll win a few smiles."
Spider-Man,8,0,1,22 February 2014," Very good introduction to Spider-man
","Peter Parker (Tobey Maguire) is a nerdy high school student who has a crush on his next door neighbor Mary Jane Watson (Kirsten Dunst). His only friend may be Harry Osborn (James Franco), the son of wealthy inventor Norman Osborn (Willem Dafoe). On a field trip to Oscorp, Peter gets bitten by a genetically modified spider, and he develops powers to become Spider-man. Meanwhile Norman is desperate to prove his formula for human performance to the military. When he test it on himself, it corrupts his mind and turns him into the Green Goblin.Sam Raimi has created a very good introduction to Spider-man. The actors are all very capable and fit their characters. Willem Dafoe is amazing as Green Goblin. The only minor complaint is the web slinging ability. It's a major change to comic lore, but I understand the reason. I always liked Peter Parker because he was the underdog nerd. So it's a great thing that this series starts off well. And who doesn't love an upside down kiss in the rain?"
Jarhead,7,2,3,27 January 2014," Great performance from Jake Gyllenhaal
","Anthony Swofford (Jake Gyllenhaal) is a Sacramento kid who enlists in the Marines. The audience is taken along through his training, and then the first Gulf War starts. He's in the middle of it all, but it's a struggle to maintain his sanity in an insane situation.It's a compelling and fascinating story based on the real Anthony Swofford's book. The training provide some memorable moments. The deployment gets strange. It's the actual war that's where this movie is unusual. Most war movie is about the bang bang. This one is about the search and longing for the bang bang. Like the disappointment that Swofford must have felt, I think the audience also feels that disappointment in the film.Jake Gyllenhaal gives an amazing performance. Director Sam Mendes achieves exactly what the experience is about. The movie leaves you feeling empty and a little haunted. It makes you wonder if everybody wasted their time."
Shrek Forever After,7,1,1,15 August 2014," Fine conclusion
","The King and Queen was about to make a deal with Rumpelstiltskin when Fiona was saved by Shrek. He's bitter at the happily-ever-after state of affairs. Shrek and Fiona have 3 kids and he's struggling with domestication. He's tired and wants to go back to scaring the villagers. Rumpelstiltskin tricks Shrek into a deal to give him the day he was born. Shrek discovers the new world is ruled by Rumpelstiltskin, witches are running things, and ogres are hunted. He and Fiona have never met. When the day expires, he will never exist. There is an exit clause in True Love's Kiss.The start is a little bit slow. It's grumpy with a tired Shrek. New character Rumpelstiltskin isn't the most visually interesting. It does take a touching turn. It's a good 'It's a Wonderful Life' story. It has a warm message and the gang is back."
Collateral,7,0,2,23 July 2015," great performances in Michael Mann thriller
","L.A. cabbie Max Durocher (Jamie Foxx) has a conversation with his fare U.S. Justice Department prosecutor Annie Farrell (Jada Pinkett Smith). He wants to start a fun limo service and she's concerned that she's unprepared for her case. They strike up a connection. His next fare is Vincent (Tom Cruise) who hires him for $600 and an extra $100 to get him to the airport after making five stops. At the first stop, Vincent throws a man off the roof onto the cab. He kidnaps Max making him drive. LAPD detective Ray Fanning (Mark Ruffalo) finds the crime scene of his CI and starts putting the pieces together.Director Michael Mann creates a stripped down thriller. Both Foxx and Cruise excel. Cruise is especially great as a cold-hearted killer. I do have questions about the movie. Why does Vincent need a cab? Why wouldn't he just kill Max and stuff him in the trunk? Why doesn't Max escape when he gets the chance? These and other questions are better off left behind. I choose to believe that Vincent kept Max for more than his GPS abilities. I choose to believe that Vincent is lonely and finds Max to be a fun plaything. It's better to simply enjoy this slick Michael Mann production."
Dark City,8,3,5,30 August 2015," wonderful dark design
","John Murdoch (Rufus Sewell) has lost his memory and wakes up in a hotel with a dead body. Inspector Frank Bumstead (William Hurt) is chasing after a serial killer and suspects Murdoch. Dr. Schreber (Kiefer Sutherland) is also searching for Murdoch and contacts his wife Emma (Jennifer Connelly). Schreber has been working with a mysterious group called The Strangers who have special powers. The Strangers confront Murdoch and find that he also can 'tune', the ability to change reality. He is looking to go to Shell Beach but nobody can remember how to get there. At the stroke of midnight, the population becomes unconscious and the world is reformed.This is a great sci-fi movie with an unique vision. Of course, it's dark. It's also a wonderfully rich hard-boiled 50s world. Director Alex Proyas adds depth to his design from The Crow. He borrows from the greats and influences many others following this. The story works well within its own logic. I think most has the world figured out by the midway point but The Strangers are still a bit murky to the end. They do need a clearer exposition that is more than Schreber's explanations. The climax is a bit too confusing but it is visually weird. It becomes a mind battle and that's a difficult thing to achieve cinematically."
Dunkirk,8,1,3,3 March 2018," undeniable skills
","It's 1940. Allied forces are trapped around the beaches of Dunkirk. Naval Commander Bolton (Kenneth Branagh) organizes the evacuation from the pier. Tommy is the last survivor of his squad. With another soldier, they pretend to be stretcher bearers to sneak onto the medical ship. Farrier (Tom Hardy) flies one of 3 Spitfires into action. Dawson (Mark Rylance) with his son Peter and friend George Mills pilot his pleasure craft to the rescue. They find a survivor (Cillian Murphy) from a sunken vessel.Christopher Nolan delivers a visual film of compelling action. He uses great silences. The flying sequences are impeccable. The sea action is compelling with some real ships. I have a bit of hesitation with the portrayal of some of the soldiers. The Cillian Murphy character is perfectly fine as a soldier suffering PTSD. If he's the only one, it would be a very compelling portrayal but Nolan puts in too many. I'm also willing to accept Tommy's lies to escape. It's not until the beached boat where there seems to be a problem. I can understand the Lord of the Flies mentality. With Germans taking potshots at them, there are two logical moves. They could either go out and fight or hide and wait. They have guns and fighting is possible. There is no logical reason to kick out Frenchie which would only prove their existence in the boat. They are acting irrationally which is excusable but Tommy needs to call it out. I would also want a separate section with soldiers fighting rear guard action. Tommy's tale could be so different and more action packed if he stayed to fight for a little while. Overall, Nolan's film-making skills are undeniable and this is a compelling exploration of this historical event."
Cross of Iron,8,1,1,26 May 2015," relentless war action
","It's 1943 at the Russian front and the Germans are losing. Rolf Steiner (James Coburn) is a superior soldier and leader of men. Aristocratic Captain Stransky (Maximilian Schell) is the arrogant true-believer new commander. During a bloody battle, the brave Lieutenant Meyer dies leading a heroic counter attack while Steiner is injured and Stransky bumbles in his bunker. The ambitious Stransky claims the counter attack as his own and requests the Iron Cross giving Steiner and the homosexual Lieutenant Triebig as witnesses. After a stay in a hospital, Steiner returns to the front unexpectedly and refuses to lie for Stransky. The order comes to evacuate but Stransky deliberately leaves Steiner and his platoon behind.Director Sam Peckinpah brings alive the war action. The story behind the action is compelling but it is the action that is exceptional. Peckinpah lets loose with an orgy of muddy explosive violence. The war action is relentless. Coburn is terrific as the leader of men. There are memorable sections like the female Russian squad. This follows the great tradition of anti-war movie."
The Machinist,6,0,0,15 April 2015," bleak paranoid thriller and horrific weight loss
",Machinist Trevor Reznik (Christian Bale) hasn't slept for a year. His body is wasting away. Prostitute Stevie (Jennifer Jason Leigh) is the person closest to him. He has no friends. He puts up post-it notes as reminders. He spends time at an airport diner where single mom waitress Maria works the graveyard shift. He is haunted by menacing new worker Ivan or maybe he's not even real. His carelessness cause Miller (Michael Ironside) to lose an arm at work. Then a game of hangman appear on post-its on his fridge.Two things stand out in this movie. The bleak neverworld existence and Christian Bale's emaciated body are both shocking. The dark moody feel exists even in the bright daylight. The colors are washed out and there is a grinding darkness about the movie. Director Brad Anderson is unrelenting although I don't think the reveal is perfect. The paranoia is so disjointed that a lot of it feels random. The reveal would work much better if the movie is sets up with more logic and orderly storytelling. The best twist endings are ones that everybody thinks they could guess at but nobody actually does. There are simply no clues to the final reveal. Christian Bale's body is horrific and shocking. I'm not going to reward this obsessive weight loss but it is insane.
The Intouchables,6,15,33,6 September 2013," 8.5 Rating? Really?
","This is a feel-good French movie full of all the stereotypes based on a true story. I won't rate the real story. But how does it stand as a movie? Philippe is an aristocratic quadriplegic white millionaire living in Paris, and he's interviewing for a personal carer. Driss is an arrogant African who is only interviewing to get a signature for his social assistance form.The characters are truly stereotypes. On top of it all, I don't particularly like either characters. Philippe is uptight but his paralysis really restrict his acting. Driss is Arrogant Without Reason. Add a stereotypical large immigrant family, and you've got the standard street hustler.When Driss draws a painting, everybody is surprised. Why? I didn't know black people can't draw. Are the French really that racist and ignorant? The actual man this character is based on is a Muslim. That would have been a fascinating in-depth character rather than this simplistic caricature. There was one possible great moment. Driss stole a Fabergé egg from Philippe. When Philippe brings it up, there were many different ways it could have gone. The film chooses one of the least interesting. That's indicative of the whole movie. I don't hate the movie. I'm just ambivalent. Definitely no more than 6/10. It's insane that this is a 10 in anybody's rating."
Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban,9,0,2,22 December 2013," Darkest and best one yet
","This is the third movie in the franchise, and it's the darkest one yet. We're introduced to Dementors, vile creatures who are tasked to guard the prison of Azkaban. When Voldemort disciple Sirius Black escapes, Dementors are assigned to guard Hogwarts putting Harry and his friends in danger.The introduction of Dementors ushers in a new darker chapter in the franchise. These CGI creatures look every bit the evil creatures they're suppose to be. Accomplished director Alfonso Cuarón shows his great skills in creating tension and atmosphere. Even the darken corridors of Hogwarts are more foreboding. Without spoilers, I also must praise Hermione's part of the plot. The story loops created are usually fraught with problems. This one is done with care, and works great. Looking back, the change in tone is what drew me into the Harry Potter franchise. It is the first great Harry Potter movie and in my opinion, the best of the lot."

He is also dismissed by his patriarchal father until he is discovered to be able to taste for poison. He becomes the clan's poison detector. He is still unhappy with eating garbage. After stealing the Gusteau cookbook, he gets separated from the family and arrives at late Gusteau's failing restaurant in Paris. Linguini is the new garbage boy. Linguini ruins the soup and Remy fixes it to new heights for a critic. Linguini is given the credit. With Remy's help, the garbage boy becomes one of the best chef in the kitchen. Skinner was Gusteau's sous chef and is the beneficiary in his will except Linguini may be Gusteau's love child.Brad Bird and company have cooked up a nice stew of traditional animated fare. Remy is an appealing protagonist. The message is good. The animation is impeccable. Pixar delivers something very traditional from a less than traditional source. The only change I would do is have Remy wash his hands more. There is an aversion to rats when dealing with food. The movie needs to alleviate some of that hesitation. After all, Remy goes everywhere including the sewer."

","Gold digger Elizabeth Halsey (Cameron Diaz) gets dumped by her rich fiancé. She's forced to go back to teaching middle school which she hates. Now her main goal is to get a rich man to take care of her and the first step is breast implants. These's a new rich teacher Scott (Justin Timberlake) in school and she has a new target.Cameron Diaz is completely inappropriate, but she's not as funny as she needs to be. She's simply a meanie, and not always funny at it. It could be considered subversive but it keeps pulling its punches.Lucy Punch plays the uptight Amy Squirrel determined to out Diaz's horrible character. I love her normally but her accent is really distracting. I have no idea what that was suppose to be, but I'd rather she keeps her British accent. She could have been a great crazy foil to Diaz.The script just needs more jokes with punchlines. Many times Jake Kasdan makes Cameron Diaz mean and expect it to be funny. That's a joke with diminishing returns. Mind you she was never a stand up or a professional joke teller."
The Amazing Spider-Man,7,1,4,17 August 2013," new Spiderman, slight tone change
","It's a new reboot of Spider-Man (Andrew Garfield). This time, the love interest is Gwen Stacy (Emma Stone). There is a bit about his parents tying them to Peter's powers.Marc Webb takes over the franchise. It's a surprising move but he does a good job. It's slightly less comical than Sam Raimi. Andrew Garfield is the same age as Tobey Maguire when he started, but Andrew looks much older. It's hard to imagine him as a high school nerd. Andrew looks his age which is 27-28 whereas Tobey always looks like a kid. Andrew really looks like one of the cool art kids with a guitar. Emma Stone is great as the love interest. Rhys Ifans is the villain but the problem is his CG avatar. He's a lizard and doesn't have much personality. Willem Dafoe as Green Goblin and Alfred Molina as Doc Ock are far superior villains than Rhys Ifans. So the franchise continues, but not a total revolution. Just new people. The constant rebooting may wear people out someday."

Club owner Steve Rubell (Mike Myers) lets Shane in and ends up hiring the pretty kid as a bus boy. He befriends fellow employees Anita Randazzo (Salma Hayek) and Greg Randazzo (Breckin Meyer) who are trying to launch Anita's singing career. Meanwhile Rubell rules the club like a modern Caligula dealing drugs and getting the attention of the IRS.This is a cliché filled glossy superficial movie. It starts with the naive innocent that we're suppose to see this movie through. Shane is way too stupid, and his sycophant voice overs don't make it any better. Then there is Mike Myers. I do not begrudge anybody for taking a risk. However he is so out of his depths. In a better actor's hands, this could have been an amazing character. His amoral sleaziness could be a movie all by itself. Instead this is strictly a cliché factory. It annoyed me to no ends."
The Lego Movie,8,1,3,3 October 2014," Fun ... just good fun
",Lord Business takes the powerful Kragle from Vitruvius. However there is a prophecy that the Piece of Resistance will be used by A Special One to defeat the Kragle. It's then 8 1/2 years later. Emmet Brickowoski is a non-special construction guy who only follows instructions. Lord Business is now the President who is planning Taco Tuesday. Wyldstyle is searching for relics and Emmet get stuck with one on his back. She rescues him thinking that he is the Special One.Emmet and Wildstyle are fine but the movie really gets fun when Batman and the rest join the movie. Unikitty is hilarious. Superman and Green Lantern are a great comedy duo. The only small minor complaint is that the visual style is very ADD. The Lego part of the movie could have some more scenes without movement. Sometimes the frenetic visual overwhelms the movie and the jokes. Slowing down some sections could improve the joke retention. It's a small problem. The movie is just good fun.
Aliens,9,5,6,12 October 2013," Great follow up
","It's 57 years after the first movie. Ellen Ripley (Sigourney Weaver) has been lost in cryogenic sleep until she's discovered by a deep salvage team. She's asked to return to the planet to investigate why the colony there has lost all communication. She and a team of space marines must battle the aliens in an all out fight.James Cameron has taken this franchise from its horror origins to a great big action adventure. The change in style is seamless. The action is perfect, and it's a non-stop roller coaster ride. Ripley has transformed herself from the feminist icon into a powerful mother figure. There isn't a false note in this movie. The characters are all well drawn from the humanist robot Lance Henriksen to the comic relief Bill Paxton. They all work to create one of the most thrilling rides of all times."
Dallas Buyers Club,8,2,3,17 May 2014," Great performances not just about the weight loss
","It's 1985 Dallas. Ron Woodroof (Matthew McConaughey) is a hard-partying womanizing drug-user bull-rider. Rock Hudson has just come out with AIDS. When doctors gave him the diagnosis and 30 days to live, the homophobic Ron rejects it at first. Eventually he bribes a janitor to steal AZT. When the drug becomes impossible to steal, he goes to Mexico to see unlicensed Dr. Vass (Griffin Dunne). He tells him that AZT is poison and starts putting a drug cocktail to treat his symptoms. With the help of transvestite Rayon (Jared Leto), he brings in drugs from outside the US and forms the Dallas Buyers Club. People pay a standard fee to receive all the drug treatments. The hospital and the DEA is bent on shutting him down in favor of the AZT trial. Dr. Eve Saks (Jennifer Garner) is sympathetic but feels powerless to help.The performances are amazing. Sure the weight loss is shocking, but they're doing more than skinny acting. Matthew is laying it all out in a complex performance. He is cocky and combative but also extremely vulnerable. Both Jared Leto and Jennifer Garner are superb support. The hero is not quite the saint as in 'Philadelphia', but that's part of its strength. This is a great performance."
The Fast and the Furious,7,3,5,2 November 2013," Cars look cool and Babes look hot
","Dominic Toretto (Vin Diesel) leads a group of friends and family to street race in the LA night. Brian O'Conner (Paul Walker) is a cop working undercover to infiltrate his gang of suspected truck robberies. However he finds himself falling under Dominic's charisma and for Dominic's sister Mia (Jordana Brewster).There is a lot of silly action, and unrealistic story lines. This is purely style winning over substance. The cars look cool and babes look hot. But it's the Vin Diesel presence and Paul Walker pretty boy looks that provide the heart of this movie. The boys have amazing chemistry and the gang feels like a real family. The story is almost unnecessary."
Control,7,1,1,26 June 2016," the enigma of Ian Curtis
","It's 1973 Macclesfield, England. Ian Curtis (Sam Riley) is a quiet enigmatic student. He marries Debbie Woodruff (Samantha Morton) in 1975. He works as an employment agent. On June 4, 1976, they attend a small Sex Pistols concert. Also in attendance are Bernard Sumner, Peter Hook, and Terry Mason. Ian joins them as their lead singer. They call themselves Warsaw and eventually Joy Division.There is a sense of disconnection from this movie and a mystery about Ian Curtis. Sam Riley's performance, the long takes, and the black and white photography all make Ian an enigma. It's a slow burn but compelling. The tone is sad and respectful. It's very fitting of the band and its music."
The Exorcist,9,1,2,2 December 2014," horror classic
","Catholic priest Lankester Merrin (Max von Sydow) uncovers some interesting objects at an archaeological dig in norther Iraq as he investigates local legends. Meanwhile in Georgetown, Washington, D.C, film actress Chris MacNeil (Ellen Burstyn) notices disturbing changes in her 12-year-old daughter Regan (Linda Blair). Father Damien Karras (Jason Miller) is a troubled local priest who has lost his faith. Lieutenant William F. Kinderman investigating the suspicious death of director Burke Dennings calls on the expertise of Karras on witchcraft. The doctors recommends exorcisms to Chris for its power of suggestion. In desperation, Chris contacts Karras. Eventually, he's convinced and the church recruits Merrin to perform the exorcism.It marks another step in the horror genre. The special effects and makeup are the best. The projectile vomiting is gross even today. The first half is rather slow but the exorcism lays the groundwork for all others to follow. Max von Sydow is powerful in his performance. Linda Blair shall be cinematic history for all times. This is one of those signposts that marks the march of films."
Goon,7,0,0,11 December 2015," some big laughs
",Doug Glatt (Seann William Scott) is a bar bouncer and an embarrassment to his doctor father (Eugene Levy). His best friend Pat (Jay Baruchel) has an online chat show Hot Ice covering hockey action. Their favorite player Ross Rhea (Liev Schreiber) gets suspended. They go to a minor league game where one player comes at Pat in the stands. Doug ends up pummeling the player and becomes a sensation. He can barely skate but he still gets on the team Orangetown Assassins as a goon. He gets hired by the Halifax Highlanders to protect their valuable prospect.This has healthy doses of the classic hockey movie 'Slap Shot'. The trick of this one seems to be making Seann William Scott the straight man. Everybody else is crazy wacky. Baruchel is hilarious and the team is ridiculous fun. There are some big giant laughs in this. The story could be stabilized more by keeping Doug being on one team and having him stay at home. That way his family and Baruchel could have bigger parts in the movie.
Now You See Me,4,79,131,27 August 2013," Now We Fool You
","Four magicians answer a mysterious call to work for an obscure secret society. A year later, they call themselves the Four Horseman, and create havoc with their magic. Their first trick to rob a bank, drawing the FBI and Interpol into a cat and mouse game. J. Daniel Atlas (Jesse Eisenberg), Merritt McKinney (Woody Harrelson), Henley Reeves (Isla Fisher), and Jack Wilder (Dave Franco) are the four magicians. Dylan Rhodes (Mark Ruffalo) is the FBI agent.The group has great chemistry and their interactions have great energy. They have a fun time being interrogated by Mark Ruffalo. It's a promising start as a fun interesting movie that gives us a little insight into magicians. Then it turns.It becomes all flash and little substance. The heists keep coming. It's like the movie is its own trick. They keep pumping up the flash in order to disguise the lack of a good story. The final twist is just fool's gold. There is no foreshadowing. It's done for its shock value. Sadly, by then I was out of shock. All sound and fury signifying nothing."
X-Men: Days of Future Past,8,2,4,4 February 2015," constructed well to connect old cast with the new
","In the future, the world is devastated by constant war. Sentinels are robots created to hunt mutants. Xavier and Magneto team up with a plan to change history. Kitty Pryde sends Wolverine (Hugh Jackman) 50 years into the past to 1973. He has to find Xavier (James McAvoy), free Magneto (Michael Fassbender) and recruit them in a mission to stop the Sentinel program before it starts. They have to stop Mystique (Jennifer Lawrence) who tries to kill weapons designer Trask (Peter Dinklage).This is a compelling sci-fi thriller achieving one of the most seamless transition from an old cast to the new. The story is terrific. It introduces Quicksilver as a fresh injection of fun. That's probably the only minor complaint. It needs a bit more fun to offset the serious tones. It's not really a complaint. OK! Forget about it. The new cast is set to take off in place of the old."
Captain America: Civil War,9,2,6,28 November 2016," the formula works
","In Lagos, Captain America, Black Widow, Falcon, and Scarlet Witch stop Brock Rumlow but cause collateral damage killing some Wakandans. U.S. Secretary of State Thaddeus Ross informs the Avengers that the world has come together to take control of them under the Sokovia Accords. King T'Chaka of Wakanda is killed in a bombing during the signing by apparently Bucky Barnes. Prince T'Challa intends to kill Bucky while Captain America intends to capture him alive. The situation spirals out of control to split the Avengers apart.The MCU has become a long running serial show. The brilliance is that it works so well. They are fun. There is value in their connectivity. Sometimes, comic book movies have comic book motivations which often annoy me. The trick for this movie is that everybody's motivations work. The exception is yet another flawed MCU villain, Helmut Zemo. Taking him aside, the heroes have realistic motivations and actions. There is a great introduction of Spider-Man. Tom Holland is terrific and that franchise looks well on its way. His humor is a bit of fresh air. It didn't occur to me before but MCU humor has been mostly sarcastic cynicism. There is no cynicism in this Peter Parker and it's great youthful exuberance. Black Panther is also well-introduced and Ant-Man adds some great humor on top of Spider-Man. The conflict between Iron Man and Captain America is well developed. The romance between Scarlet Witch and Vision is intriguing. On the other hand, Cap's romance is questionable. The airport scene is something else. It may be the best comic book fight ever. This is what Marvel does and they do it well."
Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them,7,1,4,2 December 2016," new and familiar
","British wizard Newt Scamander (Eddie Redmayne) arrives in New York with his magical suitcase filled with fantastic beasts. In America, a Muggle is called No-Maj. Newt gets mixed up with No-Maj Jacob Kowalski and they accidentally switch suitcases. Newt gets taken in by former Auror Tina Goldstein of the Magical Congress of the United States of America (MACUSA). There are disturbances in the world and dark wizard Gellert Grindelwald is suspected although lead Auror Percival Graves suspects a magical beast. There is also anti-wizard No-Maj Mary Lou Barebone who leads a group intent on exposing wizardry. Tina's sister Queenie takes a liking to Jacob.The movie brings us back to the world of Harry Potter before his time and in America. Newt Scamander is a Doctor Dolittle type. Jacob is a fun likable sidekick. There is a need for joy of discovery and he's the one who provides that. It's a little annoying that animals keep escaping the suitcase. I guess it's supposed to be cute but it just bothered me. Let's put a better lock on that, Newt. His hangdog mannerisms don't engage me. He's no Harry Potter but the movie gathers a good gang around him. This may be setting up some stuff for later on. It looks like a relatively good start but Newt goes back home at the end. The series' success is no guarantee at this point."
Gandhi,9,1,2,25 January 2015," grand epic from Attenborough and human scale epic from Kingsley
","The movie starts with the assassination of Gandhi (Ben Kingsley) in 1948. In 1893, Gandhi faces racism in South African. He tries non-violent protest against the pass laws and gains notoriety. In 1915, he arrives back in Indian as a national hero. He supports the war and travels the country to reconnect with his homeland. The rest of the independence movement expect little from the little man but he quickly gains supporters. He urges for non-violence in a campaign for independence.At first glance, it's a bit racist to cast Ben Kingsley as Gandhi but it is an impressive performance from a brilliant actor. Richard Attenborough has made a grand epic of human power. The great thing about Kingsley is that he is able to harness that power. It is a superior movie in almost every way. As in most historical biopics, there are some glossing over and some simplification which is to be expected. I can see some real hate for Gandhi and some who like to point out every flawed statement in his life. It's always a concern but it's nothing too egregious in this case."
American History X,9,1,2,2 September 2015," great American cinema
","Derek Vinyard (Edward Norton) grew angry after his firefighter father was shot and killed while putting out a fire in a drug den. He becomes a white supremacist under the tutelage of Cameron Alexander (Stacy Keach). Along with girlfriend Stacey (Fairuza Balk) and idiot Seth Ryan (Ethan Suplee), he aims to take back the neighborhood from the minorities. He kills 3 black guys who are breaking into his truck and gets sent to prison for 3 years. His brother Danny (Edward Furlong) idolizes him. However, Derek leaves prison a changed man as he tries to get his family away from his past.This is a shocking revealing portrayal of personal racism. Norton is insanely powerful. Furlong does some solid work as the teen with a chip on his shoulder. This is a movie worthy of recognition."
Saw III,5,0,0,27 March 2016," don't really care about Jeff
",Jigsaw victim Troy had to rip out the chains implanted to his skin to escape a bomb but he fails. A SWAT team breaks into the devastated room. Detectives Mark Hoffman and Allison Kerry continue their investigation and haunted by the missing Detective Eric Matthews. Kerry is kidnapped and set up in her own Jigsaw trap. She's too slow killing her. Troubled ER doctor Lynn Denlon is abducted by Jigsaw apprentice Amanda Young to treat her master John Kramer suffering from brain cancer. Lynn is fitted with an explosive collar to be released if John is still alive after finishing with his present victim Jeff. Jeff is obsessed with avenging his son's death by a drunk driver.The start is fine. I like taking Kerry as the next victim. I also understand the temptation to surprise kill her. However it would be much more compelling to switch Jeff with Kerry. I don't care about Jeff or Lynn. I don't care about Jeff's story. Jeff's flashbacks are boring. The body horror is still there but it doesn't have the shock anymore. This is not scary. Amanda is back and that's good. The ending is disappointing because it doesn't take the natural successor. This franchise insists on killing my favorite characters instead of continuing the series with them.
Ocean's Eleven,7,1,3,9 February 2014," Giant Stars at Play
","Danny Ocean (George Clooney) is a career criminal who just got released from prison. He quickly sets his signs on robbing three of the biggest casinos in Las Vegas, The Bellagio, the Mirage and the MGM Grand. All of them owned by Terry Benedict (Andy Garcia). They plan to take them down when they have the biggest reserves during the big fight.Steven Soderbergh is an expert director, and his skills are fully used here. This is a slick fun production. George Clooney and friends are having great fun playing crooks. This is strictly play acting. There isn't any realism here. It's fun to see so many giant stars playing with so gusto. However there is a lack of tension or suspense. We're all just star gazing."
Spirited Away,10,0,1,18 September 2016," magic and wonder
","Ten-year-old Chihiro Ogino is a spoiled unhappy girl moving with her parents to the countryside. Her father takes a wrong turn and ends up in front of the entrance to an abandoned theme park. They walk through a tunnel, across a dry artificial stream, and find one operating food booth. Her parents can't find anybody but starts eating anyways. She refuses and walks off when she meets a boy called Haku. He implores her to leave across the water before nightfall. She's too late and the dry riverbed becomes a vast river. The park becomes inhabited by spirits. Haku sends her to boiler-man Kamaji and tells her to beg for a job with the ruthless witch Yubaba who runs the magical bathhouse.This is possibly the first Hayao Miyazaki I saw and in my opinion still his best. He's done plenty of great work but this is the pinnacle. It's a simple coming-of-age story but filled with magic and wonder. It added to the language of animated cinema."
Pearl Harbor,5,1,3,10 January 2014," Michael Bay makes romantic movie and war breaks out!
","Director Michael Bay brings to screen the grand love of two lifelong friends Rafe (Ben Affleck) and Danny (Josh Hartnett) and the nurse (Kate Beckinsale) who comes between them.... Oh! And there's a war.Michael Bay is trying to teach us all about World War II by making us sit through an uncomfortably corny melodramatic romance. Ben Affleck is doing his best Hugh Grant impression. Kate Beckinsale is her lovely British self. And Josh Hartnett is doing the matinée idol. I'm not being sarcastic. More time is spent on the romances than on any of the historical background. For a better Pearl harbor movie, try 'Tora! Tora! Tora!' One thing Michael Bay does well is action. It doesn't start well with the shaky cam fighter aerial combat. It's way too shaky. However, he does know how to create explosive CGI loveliness. The big Pearl Habor attack is very impressive. The big explosions are fun and the big action is amazing. If only Bay would cut out the first half of the movie."

Lorraine is haunted by the nun and visions of Ed's death. She convinces him to stop. Meanwhile in London, the Hodgson family is suffering from a haunting. Peggy Hodgson (Frances O'Connor) is a single mom with four kids. Janet, the 11 year old, is possessed by the spirit intermediately. As more incidents occur and a media crisis gather, the church calls in the Warrens.At its core, this is a simple haunted house horror. There are a few good horror moves but by itself, it's not that special. The Warrens make it special. They have create a compelling horror universe. Lorraine and the nun have a great nightmare scene. The best is Lorraine having a heart to heart with Janet. They make all the difference."
Jackie,7,0,0,24 March 2017," well made
","Former first lady Jackie Kennedy (Natalie Portman) is being interviewed by a reporter (Billy Crudup) after the event. After her husband was killed in Dallas, Lyndon B. Johnson is installed as the new President. Bobby Kennedy (Peter Sarsgaard) and assistant Nancy Tuckerman (Greta Gerwig) try to console her. She has a heated exchange with a priest (John Hurt). She maneuvers the uncertain times after the assassination and in the process, creates the legacy of Camelot.There is something compelling about Natalie Portman's performance. It's more than mimicry. She has a sense of Jackie's upper class persona. The loss feels real. There isn't quite as much in terms of plot. There are also aspects that feel manufactured. John Hurt is a great actor but his scenes have an unreal quality. They are too close when they speak and their exchange is too written. It should be a high point but it fails to reach those heights. This is well made but not that dramatic."
Duck You Sucker,7,1,1,18 August 2019," the title, the explosions
","In Revolutionary Mexico, Juan Miranda (Rod Steiger) boards a passing coach. He is constantly insulted by the rich passengers for being a peasant. The coach is stopped by bandits and Miranda turns out to be their ruthless leader. John H. Mallory (James Coburn) passes by on his motorcycle. The explosive expert is an Irish Republican wanted by the British government. Miranda is awestruck by his explosives and sees him as the key to breaking into the Mesa Verde National Bank. To Miranda's horror, the money is not there and all he finds are political prisoners. He becomes an unintentional revolutionary hero.First, let's talk about the title. I like the Dynamite title which would work better as a sequel. The Duck title is stupid and relegates it to a bad B-movie. It's not necessarily the best line anyways. It stuck out like a sore thumb in the movie. It sounds like a TV edit for Duck, You Fcker. The Once title fits the Leone trilogy but it should be called Once Upon a Time in Mexico. The movie's main drawback may be that the bridge is actually its high point in terms of violence and dramatic flourish. It's those two men against the world. It's visually compelling. It doesn't get better than that. Certainly, the train explosion looks very miniature. I wonder why they couldn't do an actual derailment since the train wreckage seems to be very vast. Maybe it's an old wreckage. At least, the bridge demolition looks very real and very amazing. The actors are good. I like Steiger. There is a mixture of humor and violence. It's a Sergio Leone special."
No Strings Attached,8,0,1,29 September 2013," Perfectly crafted rom-com with a horrendous title
","Directed by Ivan Reitman and written by Elizabeth Meriwether (New Girl), this is perfectly crafted rom-com. Some may claim it's full of clichés and by the book. I don't find that a detriment but a positive. There's a reason why people follow the book. The great ones do rewrite the book. That's not this.The biggest part of the formula is the two leads. Natalie Portman is one of the cutest and engaging actress around. Ashton Kutcher is the most beautiful man candy there is. Together they make a compelling pair.The story isn't much more than boy meets girl over and over again until they finally give in to their attraction. That's when emotionally unavailable Emma (Portman) wants sex with no strings attached. There isn't any real obstacles in their relationship. It's all in her head.Kevin Kline plays his inappropriate father. Jake Johnson plays his best friend. Greta Gerwig and Mindy Kaling plays her best friends. There's a funny bit with Abby Elliott doing Finding Nemo and a dead-on Drew Barrymore. And Emma fights like a girl Rick Moranis.Now if only they could change the title."
Underground,6,7,12,21 July 2015," lost in translation
","It's 1941 Belgrade. Blacky and Marko Dren are best friends partying around town. Marko enrolls Blacky into the Communist Party. The Nazis bomb and occupy the city. The guys start stealing from the Nazis and hunted as wanted men. Three years later in a rage of jealousy, Blacky goes on stage strapped to his mistress Natalija and kills her Nazi officer lover. Blacky is later shot while escaping. After the war, Marko becomes a high functionary with Tito as he elevates Blacky's heroism through film while Blacky is actually still alive. Marko keeps Blacky and others underground manufacturing weapons under the false pretense that they are still occupied by the Nazis.There is something about this movie that seems lost in translation. It feels like there is something being said about the ethnic mix of the characters but I don't think it's clear. It doesn't explain the war in the Balkans which would be the most important aspect to explain for a movie of that time. The movie's surrealism also takes away from any realism to the all-too-real situation."
Tropic Thunder,7,0,2,20 June 2014," RDJ standout in a sea of ridiculous characters
","A big budget movie shoot in Vietnam is running into difficulties. Special effects Cody (Danny McBride) wastes a big explosion when the camera isn't even shooting. Tugg Speedman (Ben Stiller) is a top action star who is struggling after a few flops. Jeff Portnoy (Jack Black) is a fat hard partying sissy. Kirk Lazarus (Robert Downey Jr.) is a method actor who turned himself black for the movie. Damien Cockburn (Steve Coogan) is the bumbling director under tremendous pressure from the financier Les Grossman (Tom Cruise). Four Leaf Tayback (Nick Nolte) proposes to take the cast deep into the jungle to shoot guerrilla style. Only it may be too guerrilla when they run into real poppy growing local armed thugs.Written by Ben Stiller and Justin Theroux, this is a satire of a big time Hollywood production. It's a lot of stupidity. The jokes aren't necessarily sharp or biting. It is a jumble of ridiculous characters doing ridiculous things. In a movie fill with over the top performances, Robert Downey Jr. stands above them all. He outshines everybody and turns in the best performance by being stone faced serious."
Hardball,6,1,1,11 January 2014," Great kids but forget about the rom-com
","Conor O'Neill (Keanu Reeves) is a degenerate gambler and a drunk. After some bad loses, he's in trouble with his bookies and he borrows money from Jimmy on one condition. Conor needs to coach kids baseball in the projects. He finds out that he needs to field a full team, but teacher Elizabeth Wilkes (Diane Lane) is holding back a couple of the kids.Keanu is all jittery. It's very distracting, and not very attractive. The rom-com part of the movie is a bust. The character is a giant mess. The saving grace are the kids. They are the movie. It's the Bad News Bears with better kids characters and weaker adult characters. I just wish they forget about the rom-com, and cool down the gambling drama. I wish they put more of the kids' story in the film. Although I'm very glad to not have to watch the usual final championship game."
Scott Pilgrim vs. the World,7,1,3,14 October 2013," Great style
","Scott Pilgrim (Michael Cera) is a slacker hipster in a garage band who's dating high school girl Knives Chau (Ellen Wong). He is self-absorbed and willing to abandon Knives as soon as he meets Ramona Flowers (Mary Elizabeth Winstead). Before Scott can date Ramona, he must defeat her seven exes.Scott is a douche. The biggest problem for me is his unlikeability. It runs counter to Cera's usual good guy persona. Everybody is blasé and sarcastic which get some good laughs.The best thing about this is the 80s video game visual motif. Edgar Wright brings a fresh hip-without-the-irony sensibility. It also uses Toronto not as New York or as anything other than Toronto. It's refreshing and unique in a world where almost everything is a sequel."

Divorce lawyer Robert Philip (Patrick Dempsey) takes pity on the clueless princess and lets her stay with him and his daughter Morgan. He decides to marry Nancy Tremaine (Idina Menzel). Prince Edward and chipmunk Pip come through the portal to rescue Giselle. The Queen sends servant Nathaniel (Timothy Spall) over to poison Giselle with apples.Amy Adams is perfect as Giselle. I am not so happy with Patrick Dempsey. He is way too whiny. He is no Prince Charming and they don't really develop the needed chemistry. I love some of funnier moments. Amy is fully committed and the curtains are hilarious. Marsden is just as committed to be completely clueless like Giselle and it is funny to see. They are great fish out of water."

The crew meets at a sketchy line up after a truck robbery. They start working together until they are contacted by the mysterious Keyser Söze.This is densely packed crime drama. For most of this, the audience is working hard to keep up with the characters and the story. It all makes sense but every once in a while, something sounds suspicious. When I first saw it in the theater, more than once it left me scratching my head. Then the twist comes, blows my mind, and explains all the suspicions I had.The five men crew is played expertly by Kevin Spacey, Gabriel Byrne, Kevin Pollak, Benicio Del Toro, and Stephen Baldwin. They are all acting at the top of their games. They needed to be great to sell this noir crime drama. This is one of the best."

Her five emotions Joy (Amy Poehler), Sadness (Phyllis Smith), Fear (Bill Hader), Anger (Lewis Black), and Disgust (Mindy Kaling) are in chaos. Joy and Sadness get dumped into Long Term Memory leaving Fear, Disgust, and Anger in charge. Joy and Sadness try to return to headquarter with the help of childhood imaginary friend Bing Bong (Richard Kind).It's an emotional coming-of-age movie. It's brightly-colored imaginative representation of our emotions. Amy Poehler does a great voice performance. Bing Bong has one of the most emotional moment in the movie. It is touching. On a side note, I doubt this is a good movie for the little ones. This is not a simple brightly-coated candy movie. It requires some understanding that the really young would have trouble with."
The Duchess,8,0,0,27 February 2016," Knightley terrific
",It's 1774 England. Georgiana (Keira Knightley) is arranged by her mother Lady Spencer (Charlotte Rampling) to marry the older Duke of Devonshire William Cavendish (Ralph Fiennes). She is eager for high society but finds him personally cold. He brings in a girl who is probably his bastard child. He is bitter that Georgiana delivers him a girl. She becomes a popular figure. She befriends Lady Bess Foster (Hayley Atwell) who is desperate to get back her children from her abusive husband. The Duke starts an affair with Bess in a long line of many mistresses and he is able to get her back her children. Georgiana starts her own affair with Charles Grey (Dominic Cooper).This is a solid costume drama anchored by a powerful performance from Knightley. The other cast members also deliver led by Fiennes. He is a layered villain and a real human being. Atwell is also great as her character is caught up in an impossible situation. This is a slow deliberate burn. The beauty of the costumes hide an ugliness underneath it all.

He's again the lone wolf at the wrong place at the wrong time having to rescue his wife (Bonnie Bedelia). Everybody's back. Even Powell (Reginald VelJohnson) is here to help to fight a new set of bad guys.The sequel is as good as the original. The setting is different but the formula stays the same. McClane is wise cracking like before. He's the everyman that's different from all the other muscle bound meatheads superhumans. The franchise is well underway.

","Jack Malik (Himesh Patel) is a struggling singer-songwriter in Suffolk, England. He is a 'complete failure'. His only fans seems to be his friends especially his lifelong best friend Ellie Appleton (Lily James). She has an unrequited love for him. One night, the lights go out and he gets hit by a bus. He wakes up to discover that The Beatles never existed. There are other surprising changes like the lost of Coke and Wonderwall. Jack tries to remake the Beatles songs with mixed results until he is contacted by Ed Sheeran who wants him as his opening act. Debra Hammer (Kate McKinnon) is Ed's money-grubbing Hollywood producer.I love this premise which has the positive effect of including some great music. The general plot is fine although I would change some of the details. The filmmaker already made a few changes. In a delete scene, he actually sleeps with the Russian woman. In the movie, I treated his admission to Ellie as a joke. It's a good change. Their romance has to be kept pure which is why her dating Gavin is a little problematic. It's a false note that the movie is forced to correct with that big gesture. It's a terrible gesture. Putting an unsuspecting woman on a jumble screen is putting all the pressure on her and it's a bad way to break up a relationship. Jack and Ellie are fine but I would redo almost their entire love story. First off, Lily James is too beautiful. When a woman like her say things like that to any man, that man needs to stop and address it right away. He should close the door, block it with a chair, and have a sit down talk with her. It's actually a great moment to reveal The Beatles to her. The secret was definitely eating away at him and he has only one person to whom he would tell. For drama's sake, it's possible that she would get angry at him stealing music from some unknown band and she would walk out on him. That would make the final giveaway of the music that much more powerful as a gesture and it would make their reunion much more compelling.As for the moments I love, I love Ellie's talk with him after the hotel cancellation. I love, love, love John Lennon. I love him so much that I want the movie to close with Jack bringing Ellie to meet him. Patel's sad sack performance is initially frustrating but he does grow on me as long as he doesn't lose his teeth. Ed Sheeran is pretty good at being Ed Sheeran. In general, the plot is fine but it could be so much better. I love the two Beatles fans and I really love their twist. In those two characters, there is the theme of the movie that Jack needs to hit much harder. They want to bring the music to the world and that is Jack's salvation. Those two could help him finish Eleanor Rigby. The film could have hit that point even harder than it already does. This movie has a cool premise. It's good. It could even be better."
Flashdance,7,1,3,26 March 2015," 80s cheese with heart
","Alex Owens (Jennifer Beals) is a Pittsburgh steel welder by day and exotic dancer by night at Mawby's Bar. She dreams to be a ballet dancer but is too intimidated to apply. Her boss Nick Hurley (Michael Nouri) falls for her. Her friend short order cook Richie (Kyle T. Heffner) wants to be a comic. Jeanie Szabo (Sunny Johnson) wants to be a competitive ice skater. Alex is hounded by Johnny C. (Lee Ving) to strip naked for his club. Jeanie fails as a skater. After Richie goes off to LA, he returns to find Jeanie going out and stripping for Johnny. She finds that Nick helped her get an audition. Her mentor Hanna Long (Lilia Skala) dies. All of it pushes her to go for her dreams.Lobster has never been sexier. Cynthia Rhodes does a crazy dance and so does Beals' body double. They are all iconic dance scenes. There are some great 80s music. The movie screams 80s cheese but it's even better than that. There are some great scenes. Jeanie's progression is heart breaking. The older dancer (I believe it's Belinda Bauer) does a great speech about dreams fading away. This is not just good 80s cheese. It also has heart."
Resident Evil,6,0,1,10 March 2014," Some good action but not much more
","The Umbrella corporation dominates the world. In an accident at its secret underground facility called 'The Hive', a dangerous virus is let loose. It has infected the staff turning them into zombies while mutant creatures run free. The computer Red Queen shuts down the complex and kills everybody inside. Alice (Milla Jovovich) finds herself with amnesia in a house that has a secret entrance to the underground labs. The corporation sends in an elite armed squad (Colin Salmon, Michelle Rodriguez) who finds amnesic Alice and Spence (James Purefoy), and they go in to investigate.Based on the video game, director/writer Paul W.S. Anderson brings some interesting gore into the movie. The characters are two dimensional. But it does what it intends to do and not much more. It's mostly atmosphere in the first half. Then there is shoot them up horror action but nothing terribly scary. And hot Jovovich doing battle with zombies and mutants. The flashbacks as Alice remembers is distracting and usually disrupts the flow. The video game genre doesn't usually get much better."
Avengers: Endgame,8,13,31,27 April 2019," Back to the Future or not
","Hawkeye loses his family with the snap. Tony Stark and Nebula are stranded in space. They are rescued by Captain Marvel. What remains of the Avengers set off to confront Thanos only to find that he had already destroyed the Stones. Five years later, Scott Lang escapes from the quantum realm. He is shocked by the new world order and comes up with an idea to save everyone, a Time Heist.This is the 22nd film in the MCU. The best aspect is that it pulls together the whole series of movies and fulfill many of their emotional storylines. Iron Man, Thor, Captain America, Black Widow, Hawkeye, Ant-Man, and Nebula all get some powerful personal stories. Thor is doing a funny 'The Dude' Lebowski. Iron Man is his family. Captain America finally gets his love. Hawkeye becomes vengeance. There are some other aspects that I would alter with the Infinity Gauntlet.For Ant-Man, Paul Rudd's comedic takes diminishes his pain from losing Hope. He's not quite as broken as Hawkeye. His lost keeps conflicting with his humor. Black Widow's fight with Hawkeye lasts too long. Sometimes, less is more and doing fewer reversals would add power to each turn. Nebula's final confrontation with herself needs some better work. She needs to have a talk with herself or do an Indiana Jones and shot right away. She could give a punchline like 'I don't like how she looks'. The movie yadayada a lot about time travel. The only explanation is that it's not any of those movies. It's a funny line but it's basically saying that it has no rules. Then the characters say that there are rules. I don't begrudge the MCU for yadayadaing the rules because that could get real complicate. Finally, this MCU ends like many MCU movies, with a chaotic massive final battle. I'd prefer cutting that back and the female Avengers assemble is a little too convenient. Just have two other women. That's enough. It becomes fan service. Overall, the emotional resolutions are great. The recalls to the other movies are satisfying. The story works for the most part. In a franchise that is sure to keep going to infinity, this is a great rest stop to say a few goodbyes."
Dirty Dancing,7,0,0,8 February 2014," iconic memorable charming melodrama
","It's 1963 in more innocent times. Baby (Jennifer Grey) is a daddy's girl who only wants to be in the Peace Corps. She and her family is spending the summer in Kellerman's Mountain House in upstate New York's Catskill Mountains. It's a vanilla existence until she starts to see the world behind the curtains. The waiters are all recruited from the ivy leagues in order to flirt with the daughters especially the dogs. The owner's son is a jerk that is pushed on Baby. Then she discovers the help's party. When Penny Johnson (Cynthia Rhodes) needs an abortion, Baby agrees to take her place in a dance show with charismatic dancer Johnny Castle (Patrick Swayze). Then Penny gets horribly ill, and her doctor father (Jerry Orbach) comes to the rescue discovering that Baby lied to get the money for the abortion. He forbids her to associate with those people, and Baby is forced to disobey his father for the first time in her life.This is an absolute charmer. It is very old school melodrama. Like the time period, this movie is a much more innocent fare. Of course, there are the iconic scenes, the memorable dance move, the fun, and the great song. On top of everything, there is the beautiful Jennifer Grey and the charming Patrick Swayze. The biggest complaint seems to be the clinches and the sentimentality. However that's most of its charm. It's an uncomplicated times gone by."
The Commitments,8,5,8,18 August 2014," Fun loving and full of life
","Jimmy Rabbitte (Robert Arkins) is a small time hustler selling pirated tapes and T-shirts. Outspan Foster (Glen Hansard) and Derek Scully (Ken McCluskey) ask Jimmy to manage their wedding band. Jimmy declares that they need to be a hard working Soul band. He puts an ad in the papers and it's a parade of wrong music. His Elvis loving dad (Colm Meaney) doesn't get it. Sax playing Dean Fay (Félim Gormley) is the first brought into the band. Billy Mooney (Dick Massey) is the drummer. Jimmy gets Natalie Murphy (Maria Doyle Kennedy), Imelda Quirke (Angeline Ball) and Bernie McGloughlin (Bronagh Gallagher) as the backup singers. After watching a drunken Deco Cuffe (Andrew Strong) sing at the wedding, he gets him as the lead singer. Joey 'The Lips' Fagan (Johnny Murphy) is the womanizing experienced trumpet player who comes up with their name 'The Commitments'. He hires the volatile Mickah Wallace (Dave Finnegan) as their security.This is fun. It's great music. The cast is mostly musicians trying their hands at acting. Some of them would become quite interesting. It's based on the first of novelist Roddy Doyle's lower class Barrytown trilogy. It's heart warming and then sadly inevitable. The portrayal of the Irish lower class is one of loving profanity. The one word I would use is life. This movie is full of life. The movie could have ended with something predictable but this way it's poetry."
Quantum of Solace,6,0,5,29 November 2013," Back to action and convoluted plot
","James Bond (Daniel Craig) tries to unravel what happened to Vesper, and discovers a vast mysterious worldwide organization. M (Judi Dench) is attacked, and Bond discovers a dastardly plan by wealthy Dominic Greene.This starts with an incredible action car chase, and the action keeps coming. It's intermittently interrupted by plot points which serves to be just excuses for more action. The first third has very little plot except to tell the audience that there is an evil worldwide organization. It is all action.When the bad guy is revealed, he's played by the creepy looking Mathieu Amalric. It has a lot of convoluted twists and turns. The evil plan is rather underwhelming. I am not so impressed with it. The avenging of Vesper also leaves a little to be desired. I do wish for a more concise story."
Independence Day,8,0,0,13 September 2013," popcorn fun
",Aliens have arrived. The world waits nervously. David Levinson (Jeff Goldblum) uncovers an alien signal. He drives to the White House with his father Julius (Judd Hirsch) to connect with ex Constance Spano (Margaret Colin) who is an adviser to President Thomas J. Whitmore (Bill Pullman). The aliens launch a massive attack. Captain Steven Hiller (Will Smith) is a military pilot on the counter-attack.Roland Emmerich blows up lots of stuff. This isn't deep. Sure the computer virus idea is stupid. Who Cares? We get to see the White House blow up. It is a great 90s popcorn picture. The story works minus the computer virus. There is epic action. It is loads of fun.
The Dirty Dozen,7,0,4,25 May 2014," Great cast great chemistry
","Major Reisman (Lee Marvin) is given a suicide mission by General Worden (Ernest Borgnine) to create havoc on the eve of D-day. He is ordered to pick 12 prisoners for the mission to parachute behind enemy lines to take out high ranking generals in a rest house. The dozen includes Charles Bronson, Jim Brown, John Cassavetes, Telly Savalas, Donald Sutherland, Robert Ryan, George Kennedy among others.The action takes awhile to get started. He has to interview them and that isn't very exciting. The training and the bonding is enjoyable. The guys are some of the best actors around and they project some fun for their roles. But the incentives aren't right. Without a full pardon, the men are most likely to run away. They have a better chance even as POWs. It's also very unlikely to have non-Germans go behind the lines if they mean to infiltrate. Nevertheless, the great cast makes this a manly fun time."
Gone with the Wind,10,5,8,27 November 2013," Golden age of Hollywood (even with the whitewashing)
","I can't add much more to the reviews that handbooks on filmmaking haven't already. It epitomizes the golden age of Hollywood. It's grand. It's a technical marvel. It has the most iconic romance since Romeo and Juliet. Clark Gable, and Vivien Leigh has more quotable lines than anybody else. Is there a better line than Rhett Butler's 'No, I don't think I will kiss you, although you need kissing, badly. That's what's wrong with you. You should be kissed and often, and by someone who knows how.'? It is bigger than a simple movie.However, the more modern critiques have centered on the treatment of the slavery issue, and the general whitewashing of that 'civilization'. It's a fair criticism, but it misses the times and the subject matter. The movie isn't about slavery. It's a fable of its times. I won't be subtracting any points. I don't want to add retroactive morality to my review.Most of the black characters are noble subservients in the movie. It's understandable to object to the portrayal. However, Sam is one of the more heroic persona. Other than Priss and the carpetbagger, they weren't stupid or mean spirited. I think the best description is whitewashing. They covered up the brutality, and gave it a nice gleaming coat. For its times, I don't think we can expect more. Slavery in The Patriot (2000) was marginally more realistic than this. To me, that seems much more egregious."
The Butterfly Effect,6,2,5,18 September 2015," intriguing premise but gets too convoluted
","As a child, Evan Treborn suffers from blackouts. Her single mom Andrea (Melora Walters) leaves him with Mr. Miller (Eric Stoltz) as his babysitter. However Miller would film him in pornography with Kayleigh while Tommy watch. As a teen, Evan, Tommy, Kayleigh and Lenny have an incident but Evan has another blackout. His treatment in Sunnyvale Institution doesn't reveal his blackouts. Kayleigh continues to be abused by her father. Tommy's anger sends him on a bad path and he grows to hate Evan for his love of Kayleigh. Evan moves out of the neighborhood and vows to return for Kayleigh. In college, Evan (Ashton Kutcher) has left behind his past and his blackouts. He's living with wild man Thumper (Ethan Suplee). He reads his old notebook and flashbacks to moments in his childhood. He returns to the neighborhood to find Lenny as a volatile recluse. Kayleigh (Amy Smart) is a defeated girl working as a waitress. His return drives her to commit suicide. Tommy is an ex-con. He starts to go back in time and change history.The premise is intriguing. It starts off great but the whipsaw changes are too much. It's too wild. It does allow Ashton Kutcher and to some extent, Amy Smart to stretch out their acting skills. However it just goes too wild and too crazy. It becomes a cartoon rather than something to be taken seriously but Kutcher does a relatively good job."
Alien vs. Predator,3,0,2,4 April 2014," Aliens in present day Earth
","Weyland Industries has found an unknown heat signature in Antarctica. Charles Bishop Weyland (Lance Henriksen) gathers a team to explore a pyramid buried deep underground. Inside they find an altar which they activate. Meanwhile three Predators have landed to collect their trophies.This is an idea created out of desperation. Both Predator and Alien franchises had run their courses. Somebody came up with the insane idea to marry the two franchises. There is a reason why only Henriksen returned. It should have been an obvious mistake to bring Alien into present day and on Earth. It rips apart the original Alien franchise canon.If there is any redeeming quality, it is to be found in the movie itself. It is a pretty simple creature feature with 2 different creatures. One must abandon all hopes of the enjoyment from the original franchises. There is no hiding the creatures. They are revealed quickly. Director Paul W.S. Anderson brings along the monsters and produces nothing good. There is no imagination. At least enough money has been spent that the production doesn't look completely cheap. That is all the good I could see here."
Legends of the Fall,6,7,12,16 December 2013," Too Legendary and not enough subtlety
","Col. William Ludlow (Anthony Hopkins) hoped to escape the world to live in Montana. He would raise 3 sons Alfred (Aidan Quinn), Samuel (Henry Thomas), and Tristan (Brad Pitt) in an idyllic life. However, the first World War and the arrival of Samuel's girl Susannah Fincannon (Julia Ormond) would put a strain in all their lives.It's very grand. It's a little too grand. It's too literary. There are great actors here. But even they can't elevate it beyond melodrama. Maybe they participated in overacting especially Brad Pitt. There is no time for subtlety. The landscape vistas are majestic. The music is sweeping. The emotions are big. The betrayals are epic. The losses are unimaginable. The journeys are soul wrenching.It may be impossible to do otherwise with the material. But I like to see it tried with a bit more restraint."
No Country for Old Men,8,4,6,19 September 2014," Such great compelling characters
","Sheriff Ed Tom Bell (Tommy Lee Jones) laments the bygone peaceful times of his father and grandfather. Anton Chigurh (Javier Bardem) is a weird killer with a compressed air pistol. Llewelyn Moss (Josh Brolin) comes across a drug deal gone wrong in the desert. The bad guys killed each other leaving the drugs behind. Llewelyn recovers a suitcase full of cash. He doesn't even tell his wife Carla Jean Moss (Kelly Macdonald) at first. He returns to the desert that night, and is shot by the criminals. They have his car and he expects them to come after him. He sends his wife away while he tries to hide the $2 million. Chigurh is brought in to track down the money and promptly kills the drug criminals who hired him. Sheriff Bell and deputy Wendell (Garret Dillahunt) investigates. The cartel hires Carson Wells (Woody Harrelson) to stop Chigurh and get back the money.Javier Bardem creates a memorable villain. The Coen brothers have brilliant eyes for such uniqueness. They are also great movie makers. Their movies are always well put together. Every scene is something interesting. And the actors are in great hands with such well-drawn compelling characters. The brothers have done it again."
The Love Guru,2,0,2,31 May 2016," unholy idea
","Toronto Maple Leafs star player Darren Roanoke (Romany Malco) has fallen into a funk after his wife Prudence left him for L.A. Kings goalie Jacques 'Le Coq' Grandé (Justin Timberlake). Team owner Jane Bullard (Jessica Alba) hires Guru Pitka (Mike Myers) for $2 million to fix Roanoke. Pitka wants to be the next Deepak Chopra. He doesn't get along with the diminutive coach Punch Cherkov (Verne Troyer).Mike Myers makes a mistake right from the start by putting this as a Toronto Maple Leafs story. On top of that, Guru Pitka is a bad SNL skit. If Myers had tried this on SNL, he would have realized its inherent problems and abandoned the idea. It is borderline racist and worst of all, it's not funny. The only funny bits happen with Troyer if I stretch to be kind. Alba and Malco are terribly bland. Guru Pitka could be a funny character if he's an innocent and naive to the modern world. He's not likable and the comedy is repetitive."
District 9,8,5,7,10 May 2014," Great original sci-fi
","In 1982 a spaceship appears over Johannesburg, South Africa. They find an alien population of 'Prawns' and put them in a concentration camp called District 9. After 20 years, the local population has had enough of the aliens and plan to relocate the aliens to a location far away. Wikus van der Merwe is a meek bureaucrat who is given charge to organize the relocation plan by private corporation MNU. District 9 has become a vast lawless place with alien technologies. While rounding up the Prawns and getting signatures on paperwork, Wikus is infected with something that is slowly morphing him into the alien.What an amazing debut effort from director/writer Neill Blomkamp. It is richly original and so very human. It uses the documentary style to elevate its realism. The CGI Prawns are brilliantly grotesque without being a ridiculous horror. Wikus is such a wonderful comedic character. It is a scathing indictment of the treatment of the disenfranchised. The movie works on so many different levels. It is audacious beyond anything a big Hollywood blockbuster should be."
Mamma Mia!,6,0,0,25 December 2013," Great actors do some questionable singing
","Sophie (Amanda Seyfried) is getting marry, and she wants to invite her father. So she invites 3 possibles from her mother's (Meryl Streep) past loves. The actors are all great The story is rom-com cheese, but that's not the problem.The biggest problem is the singing from these actors. Many of them are not natural singers. Luckily Seyfried is actually a sweet pretty singer. I wouldn't say the same for Streep. Although Streep puts it all out there, and the spectacle of her doing a musical is enough to get me to watch. She just needs to burn that ugly pair of overalls.There is a varying degree of singing talents among Stellan Skarsgård, Colin Firth, and Pierce Brosnan. Colin has to be the best, and Stellan is surprisingly good. However Pierce stands out with his talk-singing. It's the most embarrassing performance until Russell Crowe in 'Les Misérables'. Of all the actors, the best singer has to be Christine Baranski. She's a natural in a musical.I like ABBA just not my favorite band. I like the ABBA song 'The Winner Takes It All' the most because it's actually about something personal. And this song occurs at a crucial time dramatically. But Streep does too much on-the-nose gesturing, and Brosnan can't do much other than just stand there. It's a small hiccup in what could have been amazing.This would have always had a certain amount of cheese factor. Pierce Brosnan didn't help any. Meryl Streep is the greatest actor ever, but there is a lot to be desired about her musical theater work."
The Hobbit: The Desolation of Smaug,8,4,7,2 November 2014," A good improvement over the first
","Bilbo Baggins (Martin Freeman) and the dwarfs led by Thorin Oakenshield are on a quest to recover the Arkenstone from the dragon Smaug (Benedict Cumberbatch) and unite the dwarf armies. The group travels through Mirkwood where they encounter the wood elves. Tauriel (Evangeline Lilly) and Legolas (Orlando Bloom) are elves who end up following the group. Meanwhile, Gandalf (Ian McKellen) goes off to investigate the true enemy behind the looming threat.This is a good improvement over the first part. It is essentially one long road trip. There is no need for an introduction. There are several compelling action sequences. I especially like the barrel rides. Also there are a couple of good character sequences. Oakenshield and Tauriel have some good interactions and build up some good chemistry. Then Bilbo has some great funny moments with Smaug. It's a great ride and what I hoped the first movie would have been."
The Assassination of Jesse James by the Coward Robert Ford,7,1,1,26 December 2015," beautiful but slow
","Jesse James (Brad Pitt) is a mystery to his own kids living a secret life under a different name in Kansas City. He's 34 and it's 1881. The remaining members of his gang include Robert Ford (Casey Affleck), Charley Ford (Sam Rockwell), Frank James (Sam Shepard), Wood Hite (Jeremy Renner), Ed Miller (Garret Dillahunt) and Dick Liddil (Paul Schneider). Frank and Jesse are the last two remaining original members.Andrew Dominik films a beautiful looking movie but his script runs on and on. Roger Deakins's cinematography is a thing of beauty. The first train robbery at night is haunting. The dialog is a long rambling affair. As always, I don't particularly like narrations. One would expect a Jesse James movie to be exciting and a great thrill ride. In this movie, even the action scenes are moody and stylish. What starts out as a fascinating beautiful hypnotic watch turns into more of an endurance test at over two and a half hour. Brad Pitt plays Jesse James as a mercurial calm commanding presence. Affleck has an unstable edginess. The cast is filled with wonderful actors. Nevertheless, the movie could use a little trimming."
Tigerland,7,0,2,11 January 2014," New unknown lead Colin Farrell
","It's 1971. The war in Vietnam no longer has popular support. A group of new recruits is starting 8 weeks of training at Fort Polk, Louisiana before heading off to the war. Bozz (Colin Farrell) is a trouble maker. There are destructive relationships in the group that culminates in a deadly encounter.Joel Schumacher has strip down the production. The strength is the chaotic energy coming from the relative unknowns in this movie. The most impressive is the young unknown lead Colin Farrell. He oozes charisma. Another is the much picked on Clifton Collins Jr. The story is a jumble of other military training movies. The best thing Schumacher does is point the camera at these great young faces."
Days of Thunder,7,4,5,23 November 2014," Top Gun Redux with NASCAR
","Wealthy Tim Daland (Randy Quaid) brings in newcomer Cole Trickle (Tom Cruise) to race his car. He also recruits veteran crew chief Harry Hogge (Robert Duvall) to lead Cole's pit crew. Cole is reckless and inexperienced. The brash rookie starts getting pushed around by the Winston Cup champion Rowdy Burns (Michael Rooker). Eventually he admits his lack of knowledge to Hogge who helps him become one of the best racer on the circuit. He crashes into Rowdy Burns sending both of them to the hospital. There they are treated by Dr. Claire Lewicki (Nicole Kidman). While Cole is injured, Daland hires hot new driver Russ Wheeler (Cary Elwes) to replace him.Director Tony Scott basically does Top Gun again but this time with NASCAR. Tom Cruise is playing Maverick again. The action beats are still the same and they are just as fun. Even the romance is strangely similar. If you like 'Top Gun', there's no real reason to not like this one. I guess some like to dismiss Tony Scott for doing the same movie."
Remember the Titans,7,0,0,24 November 2013," fairly superficial and conventional
","It's 1971 Alexandria, Virginia. The town is racked with racial strife. A storekeeper has shot a black man. The successful high school football team is coached by Bill Yoast (Will Patton) who is in line to be inducted into the Hall of Fame. Political changes mean the integration of the school and its football team. Then coach Yoast is replaced by coach Herman Boone (Denzel Washington). In order to keep the peace, Yoast stays to coach defense.It's a fairly standard superficial look at a segregated system being forced together. The best thing in this movie is the duo of Will Patton and Denzel Washington. They do the heaviest lifting acting-wise. They have to act through a minefield especially Denzel. He can't look arrogant but also can't be a saint. He is aggressive and not the most likable character at the start. Will Patton's character is much more the saint in this movie. The players each have limited roles. Ryan Hurst has the leading role among the players and he provides a suitable performance. It is fascinating to see a baby faced Ryan Gosling, and I didn't even realized that Hayden Panettiere played the young loud coach's daughter.I guess based-on-true-story limits the writing in the movie. However, this is like somebody copied all the stereotypical story lines from other sports-race movies. It isn't very deep, and all the big ideas are touched upon. Every scene is about how race is affecting this school. While the coaches get proper time, the kids are too numerous to get enough space. They need to remember the teens."

Forky escapes and Woody goes in pursuit. Along the way, they are reunited with Bo Peep and her sheep while facing off against Gabby Gabby.This is surprisingly emotional. There are surprising turns at the end. I'm uncertain about the future prospects of the franchise but I'm also a little excited about a reunion. It would be fine if this is the end but that would be a shame. This is a great franchise. If there is one that deserves to continue, there is non better than this. As for Forky, I expected a wilder voice. His introduction is amazing. There are a few terrific journeys along the way."
Batman Begins,8,1,2,4 January 2014," Good start to Nolan's trilogy
","Director Christopher Nolan is rebooting the Dark Knight with a ever darker style. It is faux realism. He starts off with the death of Bruces' parents. After not able to kill their killer, Bruce is in a Chinese prison where he meets the mysterious Ra's Al Ghul. It is the anti-Obi-Wan Kenobi. His message is a dark perversion of Justice. When he returns to Gotham, he invents Batman.There are two things that keep this from an even more impressive start of Nolan's Batman Trilogy. The first is Katie Holmes. She is not up to the task. She is still playing that little girl character from Dawson's Creek. She doesn't have the seriousness or gravitas to play this gutsy lawyer character. It's a big character, and not just another girlfriend.The second is that Scarecrow (Cillian Murphy) isn't a big enough villain. The evil plan has too much of a silly Bond feeling. It is too unrealistic in a Batman movie that is suppose to be realistic. It leaves a bad taste for the climatic ending. Other than those two, this is still a great start to the trilogy. It sets the tone for the final two."
The Fault in Our Stars,6,4,7,16 October 2014," The Star is Shailene Woodley
","Hazel Grace Lancaster (Shailene Woodley) is tired of her parents (Laura Dern, Sam Trammell)'s help and the support of the support groups. The doctor diagnose her as depressed. That is until she meets Augustus (Ansel Elgort) at a support group meeting. He's a one-legged cancer survivor who share the same view of life. Hazel gives Augustus a book 'An Imperial Affliction' written by Peter Van Houten (Willem Dafoe) to read. Van Houten invites them to visit him in Amsterdam, but the meeting doesn't turn out the way they hoped.This is a perfectly OK teen melodrama with a great performance from Shailene Woodley. She nails this character through the ups and downs. Her scene with Willem Dafoe in Amsterdam is terrific. She doesn't just hold her own but she comes out on top. Ansel Elgort is too one dimensional. I think that has a lot to do with the writing. He is all sugary charms. Even his bad driving is engineered to endear him to the audience. He's not a real person but rather a manufactured character.This movie could do with some swearing. This is where the MPAA rating system really screws with a movie. It's a movie that needs the PG rating. As such, bad language that would fit these characters' situation is just gone. One would expect these characters to have the gallows humor and the swear words to match. I guess there isn't much the filmmakers can truly do about it. One scene that encapsulates the movie for me is the kiss in Anne Frank's house. As the kiss develops, I thought that this is going to be awkward. Once they start kissing, the scene actually is touching. It works and then everybody starts clapping. It becomes over-written. It's a movie with a great young star that is trying to do something interesting but just tries too hard with its writing."

","Bella Swan (Kristen Stewart) leaves Phoenix and her mother to live in Forks, Washington with her dad Charlie who is the Chief of Police. He bought her a truck from Billy Black and befriends Jacob Black (Taylor Lautner) but he goes to school in the reservation. She makes a few new friends but is more intrigue by the Cullens especially Edward Cullen (Robert Pattinson). Edward can't seem to stand her at first. Then he saves her with his supernatural powers. There are suspected animal attacks but that turns out to be supernatural as well.It's stupid that vampires have to go to high school. There are lots of things about this movie and this franchise to pull apart. At its core, the movie is saved by a compelling coupling of Stewart and Pattinson. They are good actors and it's not that bad as far as overwrought teen melodrama is concerned. They are teenage star-crossed lovers and there's no shame in that."

Jerry (Cary Elwes) is Audrey's new boyfriend, and he wants to take her to Boston away from Fletcher.Jim Carrey is using all his skills both physical and verbal for this Jim Carrey vehicle. You have appreciate that he put so much energy in this performance. He's not a likable guy until he stops lying. If you can stick it out until then, he might just grow on you."

Vanellope (Sarah Silverman) is a smart mouthed girl in the game Sugar Rush.The animation is reminiscent of old arcade video styles. If you've ever played those game, you'll get a sense of nostalgia. Disney has got this part right. The best part of this must be the story. It's a poignant story of a video bad guy who's trying to fit himself into the group. He's isolated, ostracized, and ignored. But he wants to be more than the stereotype. In a way, don't we all want to fit in and be more better than what we are."
Blue Crush,7,6,6,16 March 2014," More than what's on the surface
","Anne Marie Chadwick (Kate Bosworth) is a local surfer girl with best friends Eden (Michelle Rodriguez) and Lena (Sanoe Lake) aiming to surf the Pipe in competition. Her little sister Penny (Mika Boorem) is getting more rebellious especially when their mother leaves town. She struggles against testosterone driven surf culture, and her disgusting job as a hotel maid. However the arrival of pro football quarterback Matt Tollman (Matthew Davis) may distract her away from her goal.On the surface, this movie has beautiful babes in beautiful exotic locales. Beneath the surface, there is a compelling underdog story. It has emotions. She has to overcome her fears. Kate Bosworth is good as a girl unsure of herself. Rodriguez is the girl with attitude to spare. It's more than a simple exploitation film."
To Rome With Love,5,1,2,25 August 2013," No favoritism for Woody
","In order to do a honest review, we have to show no favoritism. And if this was a love letter to Rome, it was nothing more than a tourist postcard.The storyline with Woody Allen is passable. I hated the boyfriend. Making him so annoying was a mistake. Woody had a few good lines but he was the only highlight.Penélope Cruz is another who's alone in her storyline. She had no help. The guy is doing a nervous Woody and doing it badly. The girl is naive, and separated from the other half of their storyline.Did anybody find the Roberto Benigni storyline funny? At best, it was cute, but it was never funny.Jesse Eisenberg's storyline actually had some fun especially with commentator Alec Baldwin. Although, I thought Ellen Page had absolutely no chemistry with Jesse. I get the story was for Jesse to go against the grain. But Jesse and Greta Gerwig share so many of the same mannerism. It just works so much better with Greta.Everywhere there were problems.... and tourists... both distracting."
Bridesmaids,8,0,3,28 May 2014," Gross out humor crossed with a chick comedy
",Annie Walker (Kristen Wiig) is in a rut and broke. She's having sex with douche who doesn't even like her to stay for the night. She lost her dream baking store business. She only got her sales job because her mother is her boss's AA sponsor. That's when her best friend Lillian (Maya Rudolph) asks her to be the maid of honor to her wedding to Dougie. Lillian's new fancy friend Helen (Rose Byrne) is Dougie's boss's wife and she is pushing to be the better friend. Megan (Melissa McCarthy) is Dougie's sister. Becca (Ellie Kemper) is Lillian's sweet work friend. Rita (Wendi McLendon-Covey) is Lillian's cousin. It's an all out battle between Annie and Helen for Lillian's favorite. Annie finds sweet cop Rhodes (Chris O'Dowd) but she has a tough time accepting a good thing.There are so many great female comedians in this one. Kristen Wiig and Maya Rudolph are funny together. They have a great funny exchange early on. Melissa McCarthy is going wild and crazy. Rose Byrne is a good mean girl of the bunch. Director Paul Feig has stitched together the gross out modern humor to the female chick flick comedy. And it works. Kristen Wiig and Annie Mumolo have put a lot of charm and heart in this story. I do wonder if they could have done something with Vegas. That could have been interesting with Annie under arrest.
Meet the Fockers,6,0,0,5 January 2014," More doesn't mean funnier
","Greg Focker (Ben Stiller) wants to plan his wedding with Pam Byrnes (Teri Polo). They have family gathering with Pam's parents (Robert De Niro, Blythe Danner) meeting the Fockers (Dustin Hoffman, Barbra Streisand) for the first time. Only their liberal tendencies and sexual freedom may not be Jack Byrnes' ideal. Along for the ride, Debbie has left her toddler son with his grandparents.The kid is an odd addition without either of his parent present. He's obviously there as a prop for the many jokes at Greg's expense. The addition of Hoffman and Streisand open a few more avenues for comedy, but it doesn't mean this is funnier than the first movie. In many ways, their characters feel forced and unnatural from an inferior sitcom. There are still laughs, but just not as good as the first movie."
The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey,7,12,23,7 August 2013," too long
","This was too long... way too long. There is no reason to extend the movie to this length. The only reason I could see is that Peter Jackson doesn't have anybody who could say no to him. The pacing drags way too much in too many places. He tries desperately to add whimsy to this movie. However the slow pace and the hokey characterization really causes a lot of problems.Of course, this movie has all the Lord of the Ring grand scale... as expected. That and the fact that the characters are likable and the story watchable means it can't get anything lower than 7 out of 10. I certainly hope Peter Jackson will get a better editor next time who has the guts to say no to him. Let's tighten up the story, Peter."
Before Sunset,8,1,1,20 August 2016," sweet return
",It's 9 years after the events of 'Before Sunrise'. American Jesse Wallace (Ethan Hawke) is in Paris on a book tour after writing about that night with Céline (Julie Delpy) in Vienna. He's coy to the reporters about that night. Céline shows up and they restart the conversation while he waits for his flight later that night. She reveals that she didn't make their planned meeting due to her grandmother's funeral. He reveals that he did return for the meeting. He's married with a son. She has a photojournalist boyfriend who is away. The conversation fluctuates between breezy and deeper material until personal truths start to be spilled.Richard Linklater has hit on something compelling by returning to the same characters years later. It's casual and improvisational-like. Hawke and Delpy still have the same chemistry but more adult. It's deeper. There is an addition to the material by being a sequel. It's more than repetition. It's a sweet return of old friends.
Non-Stop,6,0,2,23 September 2014," Mostly a fun ride
","Bill Marks (Liam Neeson) is a federal air marshal on the job flying from New York to London. Then he gets text messages breaching the secured network threatening to kill somebody in 20 minutes unless he pays $150 million. Hammond (Anson Mount) is the other agent on the plane but he denies sending the messages. Jen Summers (Julianne Moore) is the woman who switched seat next to Bill. Nancy (Michelle Dockery) is a flight attendant. Austin Reilly (Corey Stoll) is a NYPD detective. It's a thriller and a mystery as Bill struggles to find the criminal sending the texts. Liam Neeson has become the great intense leading man. It has good tension. Being stuck on a plane is always a good way to create tension. It's relying on lots of twists and turns. If the audience doesn't get bucked off, it's a fun ride. Sometime after the reveal, there is a build up of way too many crazy things. The little girl is one too many. It didn't necessarily buck me off completely but it came close. At least, it's a terrific fun ride for most of the movie."
Man on the Moon,8,2,2,9 November 2014," Jim Carrey goes off
","Andy Kaufman (Jim Carrey) is a misunderstood child and a misunderstood comic. He loves to play WITH the audience more than play TO the audience. Talent agent George Shapiro (Danny DeVito) signs him up despite thinking that he's a foreigner who speaks broken English. He gets the role on Taxi and develops the character Tony Clifton with his writing partner Bob Zmuda (Paul Giamatti). Andy starts wrestling women planting actresses like Lynne Margulies (Courtney Love) who ends up being his girlfriend. He gets into a fight with professional wrestler Jerry Lawler. Then he gets cancer but people aren't sure if it's actually a joke.Firstly, there is a surreal quality to this starting with Andy Kaufman at the beginning of the movie stating that things have been changed up. The other thing is that so many people are playing themselves in the movie. It's like an alternate universe. There's also the fact that Jim Carrey does a lot of crazy stuff on stage. Carrey puts it all on the line in this movie and it shows. I wouldn't put too much stock in the accuracy debate. I don't usual care that much about that and this movie can be seen as another Tony Clifton production anyways."
The Princess Bride,9,2,2,26 December 2013," Funny touching love story (not just the fairy tale)
","A boy (Fred Savage) is home sick, and to his dismay, his grandfather (Peter Falk) has come to read him a fairy tale. It's the story of the beautiful Buttercup (Robin Wright) who falls for farmboy 'As you wish' Westley (Cary Elwes). He goes off to make his fortune, but after news of his death, Buttercup is being married off to Prince Humperdinck (Chris Sarandon). Then the princess bride gets kidnapped by three rogues (Wallace Shawn, Mandy Patinkin, André the Giant).This is possibly the best fairy tale reimagining ever. Peter Falk's feign indifference narration sets off the great adventure, and Fred Savage has just the best balance. Director Rob Reiner has put together all the fairy tale snippets and create something even better. The characters are memorable. And who could forget the fun that Wallace Shawn has choosing the poison drink. Mandy Patinkin is absolutely amazing as the swordsman seeking revenge from the six finger man. And there will never be another André the Giant."
Zulu,6,2,3,18 January 2016," old fashion war movie
","It's 1879. A column of troops consisting of 1800 British and 400 natives are wiped out by the Zulus at the Battle of Isandlwana. Swedish missionaries Otto Witt and his daughter Margareta are sitting with Zulu King Cetewayo when he's informed of the victory. They set off to the mission station at Rorke's Drift to warn them and take away the wounded from the hospital. Lieutenants Chard (Stanley Baker) and Bromhead (Michael Caine) don't agree on much. Engineer Chard assumes the command based on a few extra months of enlistment. Soon they have to face an overwhelming Zulu force.This is a rip-roaring old fashion war movie notable for Michael Caine before his international fame. People die slowly in overly-dramatic ways. The British overcome waves of Zulu attacks. Surprisingly, it's not one-sided and plenty of British get killed. There are lots of action. For me, the main problem is the character Otto Witt. The movie makes him to be a drunken pacifist. I get that they want to build drama with the wounded. They don't need to make him a drunkard so as to demean his position. It's a last hooray for the empire but it's got a few false moments."
Saving Private Ryan,9,1,3,2 January 2014," Great action sequences
",Captain Miller (Tom Hanks) and his men land in Normandy on D-Day. The group is ordered to find a Private Ryan after Ryan's brothers are all found to have been killed in action.Director Steven Spielberg creates some of the most thrilling action sequences in a movie. The D-Day landing at the start is some of the most visceral realistic war action ever. It is unforgettable. The movie is bookended with heart stopping war action. The final battle is just as epic. The hand to hand fight with Private Mellish is devastating. The goal doesn't have the same epic scale although it does have the sense of poetry which Spielberg often likes to inject. The only minor objection is the mission which strikes a different tone from the unrelenting realism of the opening landing.
How to Train Your Dragon 2,7,0,3,1 December 2014," Fine continuation of franchise
","It's 5 years later. Berk has become a dragon friendly village. While Hiccup and Astrid go exploring, they encounter dragon trapper Eret who blames them for an ice attack. A warlord named Drago Bludvist is gathering an army of dragons. Hiccup comes up with a plan to reason with the ruthless Drago. The plan goes astray and Hiccup is captured by a mysterious dragon rider. The rider turns out to be his mother Valka who has been protecting a colony of dragons including a giant Alpha which controls all other dragons except for the baby dragons. Drago attacks the colony with his own Alpha to wrest control of every dragon including Toothless.This movie does something different from other animated franchise. It ages the cartoon characters. One of the advantages of animated movies is that the characters don't have to change. That's why it's somewhat surprising that they did this. It's commendable but the franchise loses a bit of something. Part of the charm of the original is that these little kids were able to teach something to the adults. There is something compelling about little kids riding dragons. However this movie does follow some other aspects of franchise math. Mainly there are dragons that are even bigger than before. The danger is even higher. All of that works fine in this continuation of the franchise."
The Pianist,7,0,0,19 September 2016," non-heroism
","It's 1939 Warsaw. Wladyslaw Szpilman (Adrien Brody) is a Jew and a pianist on the radio. He falls for Polish girl Dorota. The Germans invade and the Szpilman family expects to live through another war. However, their lives slowly deteriorate as government decrees force them into the Jewish ghetto. Itzak Heller tries to recruit Wlad and his brother Henryk into the Jewish police but they refuse. As his family is put on trains, Wlad is pulled out by Itzak. Wlad joins the resistance and smuggles in material. He sneaks out and finds friends who help to hide him. He witnesses the Germans battling their way into the ghetto from his hiding place. He finds help from Dorota who is now married and pregnant. From his hiding place, he witnesses the start of the Warsaw uprising.Roman Polanski delivers a depiction of a survivor of the Holocaust. He is more or less passive for too long until pushed. He survives due to kindness of others. He does not fight not due some moral stand but rather a lack of proactive heroism. It's a rather disengaging trait although I can see Polanski's point of view. The other annoying aspect is his surprise and constant reaction to the shocking inhumanity. None of this makes him less realistic. In many ways, he's a very human character and flawed not in any evil ways. It doesn't make him an easy, or appealing character. The world is well constructed. The most compelling scene is actually when the family is stuck waiting out in the sun for the train. The train has been done every time but to wait in a holding pen is more unusual. This is a great Holocaust movie but the leading character is unusually not so appealing."
The Grand Budapest Hotel,9,6,9,23 July 2014," A new high for Wes Anderson
","The Grand Budapest Hotel is an old relic in the eastern European former republic of Zubrowka. In 1985, the author of the book Grand Budapest Hotel (Tom Wilkinson) recounts how in 1968 he (Jude Law) got the story from Mr. Zero Moustafa (F. Murray Abraham). He talks about his early life as Lobby Boy (Tony Revolori) with the original concierge M. Gustave H. (Ralph Fiennes) in 1932 who was willed a priceless painting by Madame Celine Villeneuve Desgoffe und Taxis (Tilda Swinton) setting off a battle with the woman's family led by her son Dimitri (Adrien Brody) and the violent Jopling (Willem Dafoe). Gustave is arrested for Madame D's murder. Agatha (Saoirse Ronan) is the girl of purity who's in love with Zero. Kovacs (Jeff Goldblum) is the executor of the will.This is a new high for Wes Anderson. He's filled this with his usual unique visual style and his quirky characters. In addition, he has used it in an exciting thriller with a bit of mystery. There are some really dangerous bad guys. There is real tension that isn't always there for a Wes Anderson film. He always had the quirky, the fascinating and the unique. This has so much more than that. It's a pretty fun thrilling ride."
The Transporter,7,0,0,1 December 2013," Jason Statham satisfies all your cool fighting needs
","Frank Martin (Jason Statham) is a hired transporter willing to deliver anything with simple rules. Never change the deal. No names. Never look in the package. Frank's latest job is to transport for a guy named Wall Street (Matt Schulze). However on the way, he opened the package which turns out to be a Chinese girl.Written by Luc Besson, this has all the cool people who looks cool, and does cool fighting. And Jason Statham is great at this. From this point on, he becomes the go to guy for all your cool fighting needs. François Berléand does well as Inspector Tarconi and Qi Shu makes a good looking kidnap victim. However, it's not really about any acting. It's all about the action. And director Corey Yuen is an expert at the HK action style.My biggest problem is that people keep losing or not bringing their guns. So it's a lot of kung fu fighting when gunplay would make more sense. However sense has little to do with this. You must leave reason out of it."
The Favourite,8,2,3,6 September 2019," delicioius
","English Queen Anne (Olivia Colman) is fighting a war in France. Lady Sarah (Rachel Weisz) is her favorite courtesan and is the power behind the throne. Her cousin Abigail (Emma Stone) arrives looking for a job after her family had fallen in status. Sarah looks down upon her and sends her to be a maid. She is being whipped when Sarah suddenly needs her to alleviates the Queen's gout pains. Leader of the opposition, Mr. Harley (Nicholas Hoult), is pushing for an immediate peace treaty while Sarah uses her power over the Queen to raise taxes to continue the war led by her husband at the front.This is a wonderful competition of female relationships. It is deliciously passive-aggressive. All three performances are amazing. The visual style is impeccable. It is a movie of singular vision and great actors."
Seabiscuit,8,0,1,30 August 2014," Sincere old fashion story
","In 1910, Charles Howard (Jeff Bridges) working on an assembly line decides to start his own bicycle shop. Eventually he becomes great selling cars and a great automobile enthusiast. He becomes wealthy and purchases a horse ranch. Then the Great Depression happens. His son is killed in a car accident and his wife leaves. He later remarries Marcela (Elizabeth Banks).Red Pollard (Tobey Maguire/Michael Angarano) from a loving family is left behind to ride race horses as a child when his family couldn't hold together. He has to struggle to get through the cold world. Charles Howard decides to get into horse racing. He hires world weary trainer Tom Smith (Chris Cooper). Tom sees a small horse named Seabiscuit who has something in him. People have deemed him too small, too lazy, and left him to the trash heaps. In many ways, Red has also been left to the trash heaps and is angry for it.It's an epic in its own way. It is old fashion but in a good way. It's uplifting. The sense of lost from the main characters are all well done. The acting is all great. Tobey Maguire is able to give voice to the pain that both he and the horse have felt over their lives. The story is so sincere that one must accept it or else. It's an underdog movie with feelings."
Tucker and Dale vs Evil,8,1,1,6 December 2017," hilarious premise
","A group of college friends are going camping in the woods when they encounter two creepy hillbillies. It's beer-loving, affable Dale (Tyler Labine) and Tucker (Alan Tudyk) going to fix up their newly bought vacation cabin. As the young people go night swimming, Allison (Katrina Bowden) hits her head and is rescued by Dale and Tucker. The other friends fear that she had been kidnapped.The premise is a hilarious twist on the traditional hillbilly killer horror. Labine and Tudyk are a funny duo. The switch in point of view is inventive. The first half is near perfect. When Tucker gets taken, the premise breaks down a little. The miscommunication becomes not simply situational but rather willful ignorance. It takes it one small step closer to silly away from the smart writing. On a minor note, the opening should not give away part of the ending. It would be better setup if the college kids are horror fans watching a Texas Chainsaw adjacent movie. That would truly spoof the traditional horror narrative."
1941,5,0,1,26 September 2013," Spielberg fails in big rambling comedy
","This is probably director Steven Spielberg's biggest misstep of his career. He threw everything into this attempt at a broad wacky comedy. The Japanese has just attacked Pearl Harbor, and a sub is coming after Hollywood.With Tim Matheson and John Belushi, there is definitely an 'Animal House' feel to this. But Spielberg doesn't know what to do here. He lets John Belushi loose as the crazed pilot Capt. Wild Bill Kelso, and hope for the best. Capt. Loomis Birkhead (Tim Matheson) is more concerned with the girl. And the impressive cast is just stepping all over each other.This is a throwback to the big crazy multi-characters multi-story lines broad wild comedies. Every once in a while, Spielberg gets a funny moment out of it. But it's just a big rambling disjointed noisy mess. People need to fail once in a while to know their limitations. This time Spielberg learns he doesn't have this comedy gene."
Mission: Impossible - Ghost Protocol,8,1,3,6 June 2014," Best of the franchise so far
",Agent Hanaway (Josh Holloway) is killed and the file he's carrying is lost in Jane Carter (Paula Patton)'s op killed by Sabine Moreau (Léa Seydoux). It's the Russian nuclear launch codes. Ethan Hunt (Tom Cruise) joins Jane and Benji Dunn (Simon Pegg) and goes to the Kremlin to uncover the real identity of Cobalt who is assumed to have hired Sabine. However they are set up as the patsy with disgruntled Russian Kurt Hendricks (Michael Nyqvist) codename Cobalt stealing the nuke codes and setting off massive explosions to cover his tracks. The President is forced to invoke Ghost Protocol and disavow IMF. Ethan is attacked and escapes with analyst William Brandt (Jeremy Renner). Ethan and team pursue Hendricks to Dubai.This one is a lot more fun and the best of the franchise. It is a new high point which is rare for 4 movies in. The more prominent use of Simon Pegg allow to inject more humor to break up the action. The story is like a well written Bond movie. This is Bond with a team and I like this team. I like the seriousness of the sexy Paula Patton. Pegg is great. Jeremy Renner is playing a little against type. This is just a well made thriller highlighted by some amazing set up pieces.
Revolutionary Road,7,1,1,20 November 2016," unhappily ever after
",It's early 60's in the suburbs of New York City. April (Kate Winslet) and Frank Wheeler (Leonardo DiCaprio) are unhappily married with two kids. Her amateur acting career is a flop. He's bored going into NYC for office work and has an afternoon fling with younger worker Maureen Grube (Zoe Kazan) on his 30th birthday. Their neighbor friends Shep (David Harbour) and Milly Campbell (Kathryn Hahn) are just as unhappy. Their realtor friend Helen Givings (Kathy Bates) has son John (Michael Shannon) who recently got out of psychiatric hospital and April agrees to befriend him. April tells Frank about her wild idea to sell everything and move to Paris. He agrees and grows excited. Then his boss offers him a promotion and April gets pregnant.Kate Winslet and Leonardo DiCaprio reunite with her then-husband Sam Mendes as the director. It would be impossible and maybe ill-advised to repeat the characters in Titanic. That's not to say that it's not strange for Jack and Rose to keep yelling at each other. It is beautifully made. It is an unhappy watch done in the most expert way. It is seriously good work but it does make me sad. The other problem is that the kids are almost extras in this film. They are bound to be compelling characters but this film does not exploit them. There is a self-pitying self-indulgence about these people that ignoring the kids does fit.
Foxcatcher,7,0,2,16 May 2015," actors stretching out
","Based on a true story, it's 1987. Both Mark Schultz (Channing Tatum) and his older more revered brother David Schultz (Mark Ruffalo) are both Olympic gold medal winners from 3 years before in L.A. Mark is struggling to make ends meet. David is offered a job to coach in Colorado. Mark is flown into the impressive estate Foxcatcher Farm where the eccentric John du Pont (Steve Carell) offers to train him with all expenses paid. He tries to get David to form a world-class team but David is settled with his wife Nancy (Sienna Miller) and kids. John du Pont is driven by the need to impress his disapproving mother Jean (Vanessa Redgrave) who views wrestling as a low sport.This is Tatum and Carell stretching out their acting skills. Ruffalo is doing his normal good work. It's a quiet character study. The most interesting part of the movie is watching these actors inhabit these characters. However there isn't much tension in the drama. It doesn't play up the competition which a sports movie usually does. It doesn't push hard enough on the homosexual question either. The movie needs something to amp up the tension."
28 Days Later...,8,2,4,1 November 2013," Danny Boyle injects new energy into Zombies
","Without getting into a debate into what a zombie is, there's a virus that's been released that causes rage. A group of animal activists released chimpanzees in a rage experiment. 28 days later, Jim (Cillian Murphy) wakes up in a hospital. He finds an abandoned London. Also Brendan Gleeson stars as one of the survivors, and Christopher Eccleston as the military squad leader.The team of director Danny Boyle and writer Alex Garland has given us an exciting, action packed, and eerily atmosphere horror movie. The abandoned cityscape is extremely well done and shocking. The infected run fast and shot in an energetic manic manner. It's very scary to see them coming at the characters. This is all due to the great camera work and editing. After a couple of near misses following his breakouts Trainspotting and Shallow Grave, Boyle re-establishes himself as one of Britain's best."
Lawrence of Arabia,10,1,3,20 February 2014," One of the greatest movie of all times
","T.E. Lawrence (Peter O'Toole) has a minor function in Cairo during WWI. Nobody really cares about the Bedouin uprising against the Turks except for Lawrence and the Arab Bureau. He's sent for 3 months since he would be of no great lost. He learns the ways of the desert, and memorably encounters Sheriff Ali (Omar Sharif) at a well. He finds Prince Feisal (Alec Guinness) harassed by superior weapons, and the British unwilling to take Aqaba from the sea. So Lawrence proposes to take Aqaba from the desert and Feisal gives him 50 men.Director David Lean's vision is absolutely beautiful. The desert is beyond gorgeous. Peter O'Toole is brilliant. There is nothing inferior. It is all first rate. The bigger the screen, the better the movie looks. This is simply one of the best of all times."
The Lost World: Jurassic Park,7,1,2,2 January 2014," The ride is still fun
","It's 4 years after the first movie. News of the Jurassic Park have been scrub and misinformation planted. Ian Malcolm (Jeff Goldblum) has been discredited. There is a 2nd island 'Site B' where dinosaurs are free to roam. John Hammond lost control of his company after a family got attacked on the island. His nephew Peter Ludlow (Arliss Howard) took over intent on exploiting the island. Hammond sends experts of his own to get good PR for his secret island before it becomes public. Malcolm's girlfriend Sarah Harding (Julianne Moore) is already there, and Malcolm decide to go to convince her to return.Spielberg has the touch to create a good thrill ride. But this is just a sequel that contributes nothing new to the franchise. He gets the dinosaurs on screen right away, and it doesn't really stop. The action is a little bit more intense. Goldblum returns to give a bit of continuity. But this is nothing more than a fun amusement park ride."
It Follows,8,5,10,5 September 2015," not that scary but great idea
",Jay Height has a date with Hugh. She has sex with him but it turns very shocking and weird. She starts to have visions of strange people walking towards her but they are unseen to other people. Her sister Kelly and friends Paul and Yara stay with her for the night. The strange people come at her again. Greg Hannigan drives the group to find Hugh. His name is actually Jeff Redmond and he tells them that night of sex had transferred the curse from him to her. He suggests that she transfer it to someone else.This is not that scary but it is very interesting. The camera stays too far away from the walkers. I actually found the walkers scarier when I can't see them. It is still a fascinating idea. I love the swimming pool scene especially when it starts to take off. I love that the audience can't see the walker while Jay is pointing frantically at him. It is a rare sexually transmitted ghost story. The idea of being unsure about people walking towards you is terrific. The big scene that I truly love is when Jay relents to have sex with Paul. It's completely unexpected. It's a moment of utter defeat for her. She can't take it anymore and has to pass on the curse. This is a great idea for a horror.
Rise of the Planet of the Apes,7,2,4,22 September 2013," Good origin story
","Will Rodman (James Franco) is working on an experimental drug to cure Alzheimer's disease. The chimp on the drug goes berserk to protect her baby which nobody saw and is killed. Will would raise the baby as a human child naming him Caesar. When Caesar attacks a neighbor, he is locked away. There he suffers under the cruel attentions of the guard.Special kudos for Andy Serkis who performed the motion capture for Caesar. It could have been so easy to have the CG chimps look like a video game. This is actually a much better origin story for the franchise than 'Escape from the Planet of the Apes' (1971). The logic holds intact. It just works well. If there is anything holding it back, it's that you have to empathize with Caesar for long stretches of time. For so many reasons, it is just hard to maintain. First, he's a CG creation. Second, we know what he would turn into. Third, he's a chimp that could probably rip your face off. It's an inherit difficulty that this movie couldn't escape."
City of God,8,1,3,16 June 2015," The Godfather of Rio
",Li'l Zé and his gang is having fun chasing a runaway chicken in a Rio favela called the Cidade de Deus 'City of God'. The chicken comes to Rocket with his camera. Then flashbacks to the 60s tell the story of Rocket who becomes the photographer of his friends. Li'l Zé and his best friend Benny grow up to be the crime boss of the city. There's Carrot who is a criminal leader tolerated by Benny and there's Knockout Ned who turned away from crime.It is truly a new Godfather. It is the harsh brutality of the slums. It's the randomness of the world. It beats with a human heart. It's a little messy. It's visceral. The kids are played by kids. The criminals are remorseless. The amateur actors are authentic. The cinematography is terrific. The location can't get more real. It is a new crime masterpiece.

","A hot-shot race-car named Lightning McQueen (Owen Wilson) gets waylaid in Radiator Springs on his way to California. He's a brash self-obsessed car mired in a dispute in the racing world. But when he damages the road and is sentenced to repair it, he must slow down, work hard, and find what's truly important in life.Pixar creates another fun franchise. This time the cars are humanized. Like Toy Story, it's always about the characters. It's a great family movie. It has fun but it's also a message movie. The breakout character of this movie must be Mater (Larry the Cable Guy), an old rusty tow truck. He's definitely the comic relief."

The twins rise up to the top with the downfall of their rivals and help from their business frontman Leslie Payne (David Thewlis). They get into a partnership with American mobster Angelo Bruno (Chazz Palminteri). The twin's connection is unbreakable and ultimately their downfall.Tom Hardy gets to do some big-time duo role acting. His mannerisms for Ron are distracting at first. It takes a little time to get used to it. There is something slightly off about the movie. Its intensity is not high enough and I don't just mean its violence. The best scene is when the brothers fight. 'Not the bottle' is a hilarious line. The brothers' relationship is the heart of the movie. Nipper is an underused character. Overall, Hardy is showing that he's stretching and taking chances."
The Little Mermaid,8,0,0,17 November 2014," Great Broadway style songs in a Disney animated classic
",Ariel is a mermaid princess curious about the mysterious human life on land. She collects various objects with her fish friend Flounder which the clueless Scuttle the seagull misidentifies. Her father King Triton is not happy with her fascination. The crab Sebastian is the king's courtier composer and he is assigned to keep an eye on Ariel. Ariel goes to spy on Prince Eric celebrating his birthday on his ship. He's looking for the right girl. His ship runs into a storm and Eric is thrown overboard. Ariel rescues him and leaves when he regains consciousness. He remembers her beautiful singing. King Triton finds out and destroys her salvage objects. Two eels named Flotsam and Jetsam take Ariel to Ursula the sea witch who strikes a deal with her. She trades her voice for a pair of legs for 3 days. She must get a true love's kiss before the third sunset to remain human or else she'll return to be a mermaid belonging to Ursula. It turns out that Ursula has an even darker plot.This could be seen as a movie for little girls. There's validity to that viewpoint. It's just a very well made movie for little girls. There's nothing wrong with that. The songs are terrific. Ariel is one of the most lively adorable compelling Disney princesses. Ursula is a great villain. And the animal sidekicks are lots of fun.
Avengers: Infinity War,8,6,15,11 May 2018," in good hands
","The Avengers face their most powerful opponent yet in Thanos. Thanos is collecting the six Infinity Gems for his Infinity Gauntlet to execute his evil plan. The heroes of the MCU struggle to stop him.It is amazing that this works as well as it does. This could be best described as The Empire Strikes Back portion of the MCU so far. The heroes get their butts kicked from one end of the universe to the other. It ends with a mass disintegration which is honestly even sadder and much darker than TESB. TESB ends bittersweet but this is just dark. Although anybody with a brain would see that the snap will be reversed in some way. There are many deaths that cannot happen which does diminishes the shock value of the ending. They can't kill off Spider-Man because the MCU doesn't even own him. Sony would never let it happen. They also can't kill off Black Panther due to his future movie and more importantly, his new popularity. Obviously, some characters will not make it but I think the vast majority will rise from the dead. The constant death reversals in the MCU saps away the shock value and that's probably this movie's main drawback. If they picked different characters to disintegrate, I might have doubts about reversing it.The advantage of the MCU is that these characters are so familiar that none of them needs introduction. In fact, this one starts from the end of Thor: Ragnarok and is no worst off by it. The relationships are well established. It's great fun to have them run into other heroes they've never met. Thor joining the Guardians generates a whole lot of hilarity. Drax is especially funny. Quill's insecurities is fun. There is an interesting pairing of Stark and Dr. Strange with Spider-Man as a fun sidekick. Relationships continue to be the strength of this franchise. The heroes are so well defined that the movie can spend its time with the villain. One of this franchise's weakness has always been the lackluster villains but Thanos is allowed to have his character development. His view points and his love for his daughter Gamora give him real depth. In many ways, this is Thanos' movie and it is more compelling due to the development.I do have some other minor issues. The giant Dinklage may be oddly cute at first but it's just odd. That section doesn't have the same action as Wakanda. Thor holding open the iris is not much of an action scene. I'd rather have that section finish quicker without flipping back and forth there. I would push that section back into the middle. The plan for Vision's stone seems like a low percentage play and his reasoning for sacrificing himself seems much more poetic. There has to be a way to do a 'needs of the many' scene earlier and end in the same place anyways. Overall, this is well-constructed, well-conceived, and well-made. Despite the darkness, it still has its fun. The plot never stalls. The villains are great. The heroes are never in doubt. The franchise continues to be in good hands."
"Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon",8,0,0,26 May 2014," Ang Lee's kung fu masterpiece
",Master Li Mu Bai (Yun-Fat Chow) is weary of fighting and asks Yu Shu Lien (Michelle Yeoh) to deliver his personal The Green Destiny Sword to Sir Te in Peking. Jiao Long (Ziyi Zhang) is the daughter of Governor Yu and also a guest of Sir Te. She is to be married but she yearns for adventures. Then a thief comes in one night to steal the sword.This is Ang Lee's kung fu masterpiece. He marries a more western story with all the high wire fighting and traditional Chinese settings. There are themes here that are universal. The action is brilliantly staged. The look is lush and beautiful. This is more than a simple kung fu action movie. It is a fully realized masterpiece.
JFK,6,3,10,5 August 2014," Great movie-making in unsupportable history
","Jim Garrison (Kevin Costner) is the Louisiana DA in New Orleans. On November 22, 1963, president John F. Kennedy is assassinated in Dallas. Lee Harvey Oswald is arrested and then shot by Jack Ruby. Garrison is not convinced and conducts his own investigation. He uncovers a web of strange and mysterious characters.Director Oliver Stone is a brilliant filmmaker who uses all his skills to weave his own tale about one of the most important event in history. It is the highest of conspiracy theory all dressed in glitz and believability. The problem is that the movie is so well made that some in the audience may actually believe it. It's all spin and innuendo. Oliver Stone puts out all these questionable facts and lets the audience walk right over the edge. He even has one of the most convincing re-enactment during the trial as Kevin Costner recounts the events. It is a masterpiece. He's got quite a few good actors put in some fascinating work. In the end, it treats these tales as truths and history loses out."
Once Upon a Time... in Hollywood,7,4,9,26 November 2019," Inglourious Hollywood Basterds
","It's 1969 Hollywood. Rick Dalton (Leonardo DiCaprio) is a former TV western star and Cliff Booth (Brad Pitt) is his stunt double. Dalton's career is on a downward slide and Booth is also his driver. Dalton discovers that he is living next to famed director Roman Polanski and his actress wife Sharon Tate (Margot Robbie). Booth is taken with Pussycat (Margaret Qualley) who happens to be a Manson girl.There is only one section of true tension. It's Cliff Booth going to see George at the ranch. The ranch is the best section of the movie. Dalton and Booth have a fascinating chemistry. Brad Pitt may indeed be too pretty to be a stuntman. All of this leads me to conclude that it would be interesting to have Booth go back to the ranch to save George from the hippies. He can shoot them all and have a smoke. Quite frankly, the reworking of the climatic incident lacks the power of the Hitler cinema. I also don't like this Bruce Lee. It reminds me of all the copycat Bruce after his death and I doubt he would do a flying kick to start the fight. Obviously, Tarantino is reworking the legendary Bruce Lee incident but it feels wrong. Tex also feels wrong. There is a reason to rework Hitler for a revenge porn. There is no reason to rework Bruce Lee and if he's reworking the Manson family, he may as well rework it to its full extent. Quite frankly, Mindhunter gives an alternate version of Manson which is infinitely more compelling than this. Tarantino has more than enough skills but he would have more freedom to do a lesser known crime."
Behind The Candelabra,6,1,2,28 April 2014," With all the talents, can't quite live up to expectations
","It's 1977. Scott Thorson (Matt Damon) is a young animal trainer for the movies. He meets producer Bob Black (Scott Bakula) in a gay bar who introduces him to Liberace (Michael Douglas). After treating Liberace's dog, he takes Thorson under his wing. Thorson is entranced by the opulence and an offer of a job. The older Liberace takes over the young Thorson's life including changing his face by Dr. Jack Startz (Rob Lowe).This movie has Steven Soderbergh behind the camera and some great acting talents in front of the camera. I know it's a TV movie but with that kind of talent, I was expecting a whole lot more. Maybe I expected too much. The story is a pretty simple one about a naive newcomer falling into a sugar daddy. It's a lot of flash and Liberace provides all the outrageousness that any filmmaker could ever hope for. But the story just doesn't have any surprises. The acting is good. Everybody has a lot of fun playing gay. Matt Damon may be playing innocent a little too much at the beginning. The movie looks fine but there isn't any chance to pump up the excitement. This isn't all that compelling."
Beasts of No Nation,8,3,3,15 February 2017," methodically brutal
","Agu is a young boy in an unnamed African nation in the midst of a civil war. There are no services or school for him and his young friends. His father is a local leader. He lives in a buffer zone protected by Nigerian peacekeepers until the peace collapses. Government forces massacre the local population. Agu escapes as his father and brother are killed. He is captured by a rebel force led by Commandant (Idris Elba) who grooms him to be a child soldier.This is a methodical depiction of the brutalization of a childhood. Idris Elba has a commanding powerful presence. The kid is an appealing performer. That's why his corruption is so demoralizing. It's a harsh, heart-breaking movie. It's a Netflix movie that is cinematic in quality. The plot is pretty simple and the kid's journey is relatively straight forward. Fukunaga delivers an unflinching look into this slice of the world."
Gone Girl,8,1,4,19 August 2015," twisty cold-hearted thriller
","In small town Missouri, upper class Nick Dunne (Ben Affleck) reports his wife Amy (Rosamund Pike) missing on their 5th wedding anniversary. Detective Rhonda Boney (Kim Dickens) investigates and notices some oddities right away. He doesn't seem to know much about her life including a friendship with neighbor Noelle Hawthorne (Casey Wilson). She was a successful children's book author in NYC. He moved home to care for his terminal mother and later his delusional father. The couple's money is mostly her's. The bar he co-owns with his twin sister Margo Dunne (Carrie Coon) was actually paid by his wife. He lost his college teaching job. She hates that he is a sloth and her money is draining away. TV personality Ellen Abbott (Missi Pyle) makes a meal of his presumed guilt. However the case gets more twisted. Desi Collings (Neil Patrick Harris) is Amy's stalker. Tanner Bolt (Tyler Perry) is famed defense lawyer. Andie Fitzgerald (Emily Ratajkowski) is Nick's young mistress.This is a great demented brilliant Lifetime movie on steroids. It's twisty and cold-hearted. The acting is superb headed by Rosamund Pike and Carrie Coon. Ben Affleck is a solid lead. The directing is relentlessly compelling. This is not to say I have no problems with the movie. I never once believed Nick killed his wife and therefore the twist is not that shocking. I choose to believe that David Fincher did not make Nick look guilty because he didn't want it to be manufactured. Nevertheless the whole story does have a manufactured feel like Amy's disturbed scheme. I also couldn't see past Neil Patrick Harris or Tyler Perry. NPH doesn't give off the creeps that his character needs desperately. Tyler Perry is Tyler Perry and I can't see his character without his Tyler Perry persona. The best moment actually comes when Amy gets robbed by the couple. That is a shocking brilliant reversal which caught me by surprise. The last half is deliciously cold. The movie ends a bit early but it's already over 2 hours long. Modern movie don't usually go far longer than that and it's set up for an interesting sequel."
Mr. Nobody,6,2,6,3 September 2016," a bit too ambitious
","In 2092, humanity has achieved quasi-mortality. Mr. Nobody (Jared Leto) is a media sensation as the last mortal. The world awaits his natural death. He has lost his memories and there are no records of him. Dr. Feldheim tries to recover his memories. An angel erases newborns of their future memories but the angel misses Nemo Nobody. He is born with memories of all of his possible futures. Baby Nemo chooses his parents (Rhys Ifans, Natasha Little). His path splits at a train station when his parents split up. He has three possible loves with Elise (Sarah Polley), Anna (Diane Kruger), or Jeanne.Belgian director creates an unusual sci-fi film. Jared Leto does have an otherworldly quality. It's a little too ambitious. The multiple timeline memories are narratively scattered. The tension is diffused and confused. The various memories become disjointed. While beautiful, the film is emotionally distant as one must try to follow the construction."
Django Unchained,9,2,8,24 August 2013," Unmistakable Tarantino
","Dr. King Schultz (Christoph Waltz) is a bounty hunter. To identify his next catch, he tries to purchase Django (Jamie Foxx). Thing go all wrong Tarantino style. The two become friends and Dr Schultz decide on a plan to free Django's wife Broomhilda (Kerry Washington) from a notorious plantation owner Calvin Candie (Leonardo DiCaprio).This is Quentin Tarantino all the way. His style has become as unique & original as they come. There is no mistaking it for another. It's the music, the violence, the visuals, the black humor, and the subject matter. This is all Tarantino. If there is one complain, it's the double climax. While I understand the need for a happy Hollywood ending, it would have been better to have 1 big gun fight and just finish with it. Not that big of a deal. Certainly it's still a great film."
Get Out,8,17,33,25 November 2017," fresh take on horror
","Chris Washington (Daniel Kaluuya) and Rose Armitage (Allison Williams) have been going out for about 5 months. They go to visit her affluent parents in the country. Her father (Bradley Whitford) insists that they're Obama supporters. Her psychiatrist mother (Catherine Keener) hypnotizes Chris to stop his chain smoking. Her brother Jeremy (Caleb Landry Jones) is a douche bag. They have a neighborhood get-together. It starts with some awkward comments. There is something more to the supposed upper-class liberal white social circle.This is a surprising project from comedian Jordan Peele. He's injecting a fresh take on the horror genre. It is tackling racism from a new perspective. It would be nice to have Chris and Rose in the regular world in the beginning to set a baseline with their black friends. As in most modern movies, the trailer gives away the movie. I feel that the twist would be more compelling otherwise. It's still a very effective horror satire of the modern world.***** spoilers *****The brain transplanting is problematic for me. Obviously, the flash brings back the hosts' minds but their brains are presumably scoped out. It makes no sense that they can come back from that. I assumed that the hypnotism had subjugated the hosts leaving them slaves to their commands. That would make more sense but I do understand Jordan Peele's attempt at subverting the liberal admiration. It isn't the obvious path and makes less logical sense."
Drive,7,0,4,10 March 2014," Good Artsy Neo-Noir
",Unnamed man (Ryan Gosling) is a skilled LA driver who takes jobs for whoever is willing to pay. He also works at an auto shop owned by Shannon (Bryan Cranston) who books him the driving jobs. He befriends new neighbors Irene (Carey Mulligan) and her kid. Irene's husband Standard (Oscar Isaac) gets released from prison. Standard is in debt to Albanian gangster Cook (James Biberi) who forces him to rob a pawnshop. The Driver steals a car to be the getaway driver for the sake of his neighbors. Things go wrong and Standard is shot. Cook's accomplice Blanche (Christina Hendricks) and the Driver escape with a massive amount of money.It's not as fun as it should be. It's not as intense as it should be. Ryan Gosling's stoic demeanor may have something to do with that. Also the twists and turns with so many characters can be very confusing. It's an artsy neo-noir film which is not necessarily everybody's taste.
Aladdin,7,4,6,10 August 2019," fine live-action remake
","Princess Jasmine (Naomi Scott) has snuck out of the palace to be among her people. She gives bread to some young urchins but she has no money to pay. Street-wise thief Aladdin (Mena Massoud) comes to the rescue. Jasmine is destine to be married away to a prince. The Sultan's scheming advisor Jafar recruits Aladdin to retrieve a lamp and nothing else from the Cave of Wonders. He finds a magic carpet as well. Jafar takes the lamp and abandons him in the cave. Aladdin's faithful monkey Abu grabs the lamp and they escape on the flying carpet. He rubs the lamp and is shocked by the magic Genie (Will Smith) who gives him three wishes.Disney has settled on this lucrative formula of remaking old animated classics into live-action films. It's safe. Families can take their kids. The IP is well-established. They have plenty of material in the Disney vault. It all makes sense as long as Will Smith is purple. The casting fits. The setting is CGI but reasonably real enough. There are no complaints about the production. A purple Will Smith comes with some issues but somehow he fits the role. I do have an issue with People sees what they want to see. It's a fine idea and there is a movie logic to it. What is missing is emotional logic. It's missing the narrative logic. The audience wants them to be in fantasy love. She has to recognize him right away. The movie does save it by her recognizing him quickly and him spinning the lie. The story needs to help her out a bit. Maybe, she doesn't recognize him right away because her encounter with him is during the dark of night and she didn't get a good look at him. In addition, he could be made into a Robin Hood character and he's hiding among the shadows deliberately. It's maybe asking too much to change the story but it shouldn't be set in stone. Quite frankly, I like the start of the movie and that's probably the biggest change from the animated movie. I've never been convinced about Superman either."

",The Lambert family has moved into a house with a dark spirit lurking within. Josh (Patrick Wilson) and Renai (Rose Byrne) have 3 kids. Their boy Dalton has an accident falling through a ladder in the attic. He hits his head and falls into a mysterious coma overnight. Three months later and he is back home but still in a coma. There are strange voices over the baby monitor. The younger boy Foster is scared of Dalton walking around late at night. Strange things keep happening. They move but the haunting follows them to the new house. Grandma Lorraine Lambert (Barbara Hershey) brings in Specs and Tucker and Elise to find the cause.This is a nice solid little horror using all the classic haunted house effects and possession/ghost story elements. It is a lot of old school filmmaking from horror specialist director James Wan. The performance are all solid anchored by Rose Byrne who plays a compelling young mother. The characters are certainly real enough that I didn't ask why they don't just move. These people actually moved. This is good old fashion horror.
The Theory of Everything,8,1,3,9 June 2015," great performances in sepia tone biopic
","In 1963 Cambridge, Stephen Hawking (Eddie Redmayne) meets Jane Wilde (Felicity Jones) at an university party. Professor Dennis Sciama (David Thewlis) tries to push him. Then he takes a fall. He's diagnosed with Lou Gehrigs disease and given 2 years to live. She marries him anyways and they have 3 children. She brings in music teacher Jonathan (Charlie Cox) to help.This is a fairly simple inspirational story but it's done very well. It allows for simple scenes like the wheelchair scene to breathe and exist. There's also the tremendous work done by Redmayne. Felicity Jones gets the less flashy role but just as impressive of a performance. The science is explained simply. The personal story is touching and surprisingly deep. The movie is a little light and a bit sepia tone. It could have been harder-hitting but this version of biopic works well enough."
Bolt,7,1,2,19 January 2014," Cute dog, good animation
","Bolt is a Hollywood star of a spy thriller TV show. The interesting thing is that Bolt doesn't know the show is fake. He believes he's an engineered superdog in reality. When Bolt gets accidentally shipped to NYC, he must travel cross country back to the studio.It's got a cute dog and a workable premise. Although a dog with real superpowers would probably work even better in today's superhero obsessed movie world. The constant superpower delusion does get a little tired. It goes from being cute to making the dog look stupid.Eventually, he does figure it out. The movie needed it. It's not going to win any awards but the quality is there to compete."

","Anna is the happy-go-lucky princess of Arendelle who loves her older sister Elsa. However Elsa's uncontrolled icing powers almost kills Anna. The trolls take away Anna's memory of Elsa's powers while their parents try to help Elsa control and hide her powers. When the parents are lost at sea, Elsa hides herself away especially from Anna. During Elsa's royal coronation, Anna asks to marry Prince Hans of the Southern Isles. The sisters fight and Elsa loses control of her powers. Elsa runs away and Anna sets off to find her. Anna enlists the help of Kristoff and his reindeer Sven. They meet the magical snowman Olaf created by Elsa. Once again, it boils down to an act of true love.This is an interesting if somewhat uneven Disney princess story. The opening exposition is a little clunky. It could do with some more careful rewrites. The story wants to follow both sisters. It's probably better to keep the POV on Anna from the beginning. This is above all else about sisterly love. The big midpoint reveal may work even better much earlier. It could have been an aside to the audience. The love story would be simplified and clearer which is more fitting for a kids movie. The songs are all big bombastic Broadway tunes. The catchiest part is the chorus of 'Let It Go'. These are interesting new princesses but I'm not sure they are going to be at the same level of the other legendary princesses."

His ex-wife Kate (Amanda Peet) and his 2 kids live with her new boyfriend. A series of events convinces Jackson that something is wrong and the group goes on a long thrilling journey to find the arks.The first half is fun. Roland Emmerich has created a massive roller coaster ride. It's Moviegeddon. The science be damn... until the second half. Let's just say the whole ark thing is ridiculous. Even for a mindless popcorn movie, this is still too stupid."

He also meets Joy (Amy Smart) at the station. Dan accepts Socrates' offer to train him as a real warrior.Nick Nolte as a spiritual guide is mind-bender. Scott Mechlowicz is OK as a brash young man but Paul Wesley could be better. He doesn't have the likability when he acts like a douche. There is a lot of zen spiritual self-help Miyagi stuff being spewed but it overwhelms the movie at times. I don't particularly like the lead character and I don't particularly get the message from this message movie. It exists and yet it doesn't."

He is captivated by the book about Detective Fingerling (Jim Carrey). He is soon obsessed with the number 23, the book and the author Topsy Kretts. He finds connections to his own life and the number drives him slowly into madness.Director Joel Schumacher may be trying to create a world of madness. All he actually achieves is an infuriating mess of a story. The movie is pretty lifeless. It's like trying to talk to somebody who keeps talking about the number 23. It's very repetitive and goes nowhere. I don't blame Carrey or any of the actors. The other world following the book and Fingerling is rather boring and distracts from the movie. This is simply madness."

Meanwhile Mephistopheles is threatened by his son Blackheart (Wes Bentley) who wants to take over. So Mephistopheles proposes to release Johnny from the contract if he defeats his son.There is a lot of background to go through. The first act is a mess of different actors and many characters. I think a lot of it is unnecessary. Also the powers these characters have are pretty random. This is directed by Mark Steven Johnson, the same guy who directed Daredevil. It is yet another mess of wild CGI and camera moves that overwhelm the movie."
X-Men: The Last Stand,6,0,0,16 November 2013," One too many storyline
","This is the last of the original live action trilogy. A consortium of drug companies have found a cure for mutants and this sets off a fight from the Brotherhood led by Magneto (Ian McKellen). Meanwhile Jean Grey (Famke Janssen), dead at the end of last movie, returns as Phoenix in her place. She is now an infinitely more powerful mutant. Professor Xavier (Patrick Stewart) must stop both Phoenix and Magneto.There is too much going on in this movie. There is basically one too many story lines in this. The cure storyline is great on its own. There are parallels to the real world. There are built-in conflicts. There are deep moral divisions that are only skimmed at. Jean Grey's storyline just adds too much complications. It confuses everything and is done really poorly. Her story could have been her own separate movie. That would be a better idea. Jean Grey has her own movie with Wolverine. It's certainly a better Wolverine movie than anything they've made. There are other issues like Magneto's wrong-headed motivation. This is still somewhat fun but with issues."

Wiesler bugs his apartment and spies on them from the cellar. Minister of Culture Bruno Hempf lusts after Christa and coerces her into having sex. Wiesler insinuates himself into their lives by pushing her back with Dreyman. Meanwhile, Dreyman is trying to defend his writer friend Jerska but he is helpless against Hempf. When Jerska commits suicide, Dreyman secretly writes a letter denouncing the state.This movie shows the police state as an everyday thing which is somehow more compelling and haunting. The movie is filled with greys and more greys. The character Wiesler is such a great interior person. For such a quiet character, he is able to build up so much emotion. The movie lays down a convincing foundation and constructs these human characters."
Hellboy,6,1,1,22 September 2013," love Guillermo's style, characters lack depth

Prof. Trevor Bruttenholm (John Hurt) becomes his adopted father figure, and heads a group of strange freaks including Abe Sapien (Doug Jones/David Hyde Pierce) and the frail Liz Sherman (Selma Blair). They are joined by a naive new agent John Myers (Rupert Evans).And together they must take on Nazis yet again. On the face of it, there's a lot to like about Guillermo del Toro's unique visual style. Ron Perlman is perfect as a bigger than life sarcastic hero. But everybody is a 2-dimensional cut out. Sure it's supposed to be a comics but it has to be a movie too.The most disappointing is the John Myers character. There is no charisma. I think there's supposed to be some chemistry between him and Liz Sherman. Not even close. We're supposed to see the world through his eyes. Rupert Evans just isn't good enough."

","Holly (Hilary Swank) is in a tumultuous relationship with her husband Gerry (Gerard Butler). Holly is devastated when Gerry dies from a brain tumor. Before he died, he sends her a message on her 30th birthday. He would send her a series of letters leading her to have adventures and re-engaging her to the world.I'm not sure I can root for Swank-Butler relationship. The letters are creepy to say the least. And Butler is smirky even when he's dead and we can only hear him. Swank is ill suited for rom-coms struggling hard to be cute. Harry Connick Jr. is probably better as the dead husband. At least he wouldn't be as creepy as the voice from the afterlife. Lisa Kudrow does some funny bits as a single girl always out on the hunt. This is a gimmicky movie that gets by mostly due to the likable Hilary Swank. It's meant to be a tearjerker, but the main message is so cliché. No tears were shed for this movie."

It is a couple of powerful performances. Will gets a twinkle in his eye when he finds Maguire's weak spot. Gus Van Sant does a good job mostly getting the great performances. Will has four relationships in this movie. Each one is fascinating and each one is given great material."

Jack's understanding of the outside world is limited. It's soon obvious that they are prisoners of a man they called Old Nick. Ma finally tells Jack that her name is Joy Newsome and she was taken when she was 17 some 7 years ago. Jack angrily disbelieves at first. Joy comes up with a daring gamble to escape back to her parents (Joan Allen, William H. Macy).This is a star-making role for Brie Larson. Her performance in 'Short Term 12' is amazing but little seen. She once again delivers a top-notch performance. She has inner strength and humanity. Jacob Tremblay is a wonderful discovery with his squeaky little voice. It's an almost perfect little film. I was wondering where this movie was going at certain points in the middle but I think it ends in the perfect place."

He is infatuated with Cheryl Melhoff (Kristen Wiig) who joined Life a month ago. The problem is that he keeps spacing out as he daydreams. Life got taken over and Ted Hendricks (Adam Scott) is there to close down the magazine. Legendary photographer Sean O'Connell (Sean Penn) sends in a specific photo to be developed by Walter for the cover of the final issue. Only Walter can't find it and he goes off to find the unreachable Sean O'Connell. Also Shirley MacLaine and Kathryn Hahn play his mother and sister.There is a sweet likable story here. It strives to be poignant. Ben Stiller directed this ambitious film and he does a reasonable job. He just needs a few adjustments. Walter's daydreaming wore out its welcome as he and Ted do battle. Stiller is doing too much. That also goes for his trip to Greenland and Iceland. It's too outlandish. He is stuck with this idea of making his daydreams come alive. It would be so much more poignant for Walter to have real experiences. The Afganistan trip is still unreal but it feels more real than the rest of the movie. In that sense, it works better. The artificial nature of everything just strips away some of the real feeling. Just because there is advancements in CGI, it doesn't mean that it must be used."
The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers,8,0,2,28 September 2016," impressive sequel
","The fellowship has scattered. Frodo Baggins and Samwise Gamgee, on their journey to Mordor, encounter a vile creature named Gollum. Aragorn, Legolas, and Gimli are chasing the kidnappers of Merry and Pippin. Merry and Pippin manage to escape and befriend tree shepherd Ent Treebeard. Aragorn, Legolas, and Gimli encounter Gandalf reborn as Gandalf the White. They go to Rohan to find King Théoden under the control of evil Saruman.The story and the characters get split up into basically three groups. That back and forth can scatter the tension a little bit. It's a small drawback. I would consider doing Frodo and Samwise in the first half leaving the others to the second half. That would keep continuity flowing. The CGI is world class and nothing is more impressive than Gollum. The movie is able to keep the story compelling in all aspects."
Schindler's List,10,9,13,23 March 2014," Spielberg's most important work
","Oskar Schindler (Liam Neeson) is a social climbing opportunistic womanizing German businessman. He charms important Nazis, and gets access to limitless Jewish labor. He gets Itzhak Stern (Ben Kingsley) as his right hand man, and Jewish money to pay for his business. He provides the front. Using black market deals and advantageous connections, he becomes rich and powerful. Stern works tirelessly to save people. Even as the Jews are rounded up to Plaszow labor camp under the command of unstable Amon Goeth (Ralph Fiennes), Schindler is able to befriend the mad commander.This is probably the most important movie of director Steven Spielberg's career. At least it's the most important for him. Based on the true story, Spielberg uses all his movie making skills to create this iconic movie. The black and white provides starkness and thankfully a little bit of distance from the horrible events. Liam Neeson and Ben Kingsley are the perfect duo. Ralph Fiennes gives a complex performance as the mad commander. The shock of the horrors of the Holocaust is expertly done. When I first saw it in the theater, I couldn't help sob a little when Schindler breaks down at the end."
Across the Universe,7,0,1,28 March 2014," Great music, admirable effort, but rambling plot
","Jude (Jim Sturgess) is a young shipyard worker from Liverpool who travel to the States to find his unknown American G.I. father. Lucy Carrigan (Evan Rachel Wood) is worried about her boyfriend Daniel going into the Vietnam war. Jude finds his father as a janitor at Princeton University, and befriends Lucy's brother Max (Joe Anderson).The best part of this movie is the abundance of great Beatles' music. The worst part is the rambling disjointed story. In between, there are the admirable efforts by most of the actors who are usually not the song and dance types. Director Julie Taymor risks it all in a wild clash of bizarre imagery. It probably serves better as separate music videos than a cohesive narrative."
The Lion King,6,0,0,11 September 2019," respect and making dough
","It's the realistic CGI rendering of the 1994 Disney animated classic. I don't love the original but I do respect the Shakespearian jungle book. It hasn't changed for this new version. I still don't like Simba but a little less this time. Instead of a brat, he's more of a clueless kid. Scar's villainy seems less cartoonish and more threatening. It's the heart of the change for the new movie. The CGI rendering is very realistic. The cartoon animation is a memory in the back of the mind. I'm reminded of all the nature films and that's where the trouble begins. While the rendering is correct, these are not real animals. It's jerry-rigging a human story into the animal kingdom. For some reason, it's fine for a cartoon since that's fake. This feels real and yet it's fake. That dichotomy annoys me. So different things annoy me in the two versions of this movie. I still respect the heck out of it although Disney is not adding to the culture by continuously redoing the same movies."
The Incredibles,8,0,0,3 October 2014," Love the family
","Bob Parr is the secret identity of Mr. Incredible. His wife Helen is Elastigirl. They battle crime with Frozone in Metroville. Buddy Pine is a sycophant who wants desperately to be the sidekick Incrediboy. Mr. Incredible gets sued by various people he saved, and the government relocates all the superheroes into regular lives. Years later, Bob and Helen live in suburbia with their children Violet, Dash and Jack-Jack. Bob is aching for the good old days. He's starting to do the hero stuff again with his best friend Lucius Best aka Frozone. After another outburst by Bob at his job, the government is leaving the family on their own. Then Bob receives a message from Mirage offering a high paying super job. He decides to go without telling his wife.This is good nuclear family chemistry. That's the central strength of this movie. This is a family that loves each other despite their difficulties and the audience can see that love. It is fun and compelling with a few good jokes added in. There is the 50s vibe. There is the Bond-like volcano hideout. There are the great superhero inside jokes. This is a well written movie."
The Mist,8,1,5,8 January 2014," Great creature feature
","David Drayton (Thomas Jane) lives in a small lakeside town. After a storm overnight, a mist rolls into town. Only something has come in along with the mist. He, his boy, his neighbor Brent Norton (Andre Braugher), and other townfolks become holded up in the local supermarket.Frank Darabont is taking on another Stephen King material with impeccable skills. This is a creature feature done to perfection. The creatures are really scary. It is scarier than most cartoon splatter slasher movies. This is what a horror movie should be.Like the other Darabont-King movies, this one is not just the simple genre movie. It is about the characters. Some critics may dismiss the outrageous religious type played by Marcia Gay Harden. I wonder if people truly believe the Mrs. Carmodys of the world don't come out when an apocalyptic event like this happens. The more unbelievable type is the Andre Braugher character."
Stardust,6,0,4,29 December 2013," Charlie Cox weak lead and too much time with villains
","There is a doorway to the fantasy kingdom of Stormhold from the English town of Wall village through a break in the town's wall. About 150 years ago, a young man walks through the break and encountered an imprisoned princess. Later, a baby is left at the wall for the young man. The baby would grow up to be Tristan Thorn (Charlie Cox). Tristan pines for reluctant Victoria (Sienna Miller), and goes to catch a fallen star in Stormhold as a gift to win the hand of Victoria. The star's name turns out to be Yvaine (Claire Danes). Others are also looking for the star. Heirs to Stormhold need to find a ruby with Yvaine to get the throne. And a trio of witches led by Lamia (Michelle Pfeiffer) want the star to make them young.There are a lot of characters and a lot of story to get through at the start. It's too much. It's too complicated before Tristan ever starts his journey. Simplification is the name of the game. There are just too many characters. And the story really should only follow Tristan and Yvaine around. Instead there are too much time spent on the other characters. We keep switching back to the bad guys' plot lines.The other problem is that Charlie Cox is too weak to lead. He doesn't have the acting chops. With so many great actors around him, he just feels very small by comparison. And Claire Danes doing an English accent is very odd. Those two make a strange couple. And they keep trying to tell sly jokes. Maybe it works for the Brits, but it mostly fell flat. I'm sure it was a fun novel to read, but it just ran on as a movie."
The Elephant Man,6,3,5,27 September 2014," very slow with an interesting performance from John Hurt
","London surgeon Frederick Treves (Anthony Hopkins) tries to see the Elephant Man in a freak show. The police closes down the show for being degrading. Bytes (Freddie Jones) is the man in charge of John Merrick (John Hurt). Treves is able to pay Bytes to let him see Merrick. A drunken Bytes brutally beats Merrick and Treves brings him back to the hospital. He scares the nurses and is an oddity for his colleges. Everybody assumes Merrick to be an idiot. The drunk Bytes demands to have his meal ticket Merrick back. Treves convinces the hospital governor Carr-Gomm (John Gielgud) to allow Merrick to stay. It turns out that Merrick is quite a well spoken man. Famous actress Madge Kendal (Anne Bancroft) is fascinated with news story of Merrick while the hospital's low life Night Porter brings people over to gawk at him.There is a lot to admire about this movie. John Hurt is able to project innocence through all that makeup. Hopkins is fine but I kept wondering what the movie is trying to say. There is a lot missing from this. The twisted style of David Lynch is missing. The black and white looks good but it doesn't elevate the style. The story lacks tension. It's all very flat. And the movie is horribly slow. I imagine if this movie was in color, the critical raves would disappear. I think the black and white simply covered up a lot of bland movie-making with an artistic veneer."
I Am Legend,7,1,1,2 November 2013," Will Smith in haunting world
","Robert Neville (Will Smith) is alone in an apocalyptic New York. He's left with his dog fending off mutants who lurk in the dark. Years before, scientists have genetically engineered a virus to cure cancer. Now it's gone amok and Neville is searching for a cure.Will Smith does a great job portraying this lone man character. The deserted streets of New York are haunting. The CG look good. The mutants look good.In my opinion, there is a misguided turn near the end. I don't want to give any spoilers, but the ending is a disappointment for me. It feels tacked on and ill fitting. Overall, the first hour is great and the ending could have been better."
A Quiet Place,8,10,16,2 June 2018," great concept
","It's a quiet post-apocalyptic world where monsters are hunting using their superior hearing. Evelyn (Emily Blunt) and Lee Abbott (John Krasinski) are carefully raising their deaf daughter Regan and young son Marcus in this world.There is something compelling about the silences. If The Artist can clean up the awards, this definitely deserves something. The great thing about the silence is the use of sound. The shock of running water is a real jolt. There is actual tension within the quiet. I'm less impressed with the creatures' weakness which struck me as Mars Attacks! or something like that. In general, this is a nice original idea done well by first time director Krasinski."
The Bourne Legacy,6,1,5,17 August 2013," just the shell remains
","Jeremy Renner is Treadstone operative Aaron Cross. The powers that be decide to erase the initiative and clean out all aspects of the program. Aaron must be eliminated. He barely escapes and goes on the run.There isn't much of an emotional story here. Jeremy Renner fits the character well, but I can't really invest in his character. The story feels cold and detached. The action is Bourne-tastic. But that's about it. I don't know if the franchise will continue with Jeremy Renner. But if it does, I'd suggest they write some better stories. Going through the motion is not enough."
22 Jump Street,8,1,3,19 March 2015," fully developed chemistry even better
","Morton Schmidt (Jonah Hill) and Greg Jenko (Channing Tatum) are going to college. There is a new drug called WhyPhy going around at MC State that killed a girl. Captain Dickson (Ice Cube) is sending them in to investigate. Schmidt gets to know Maya (Amber Stevens) who knew the victim. They are led to the football players who like Jenko more. The quarterback Zook (Wyatt Russell) becomes friends with Jenko and the prime suspect.After establishing the chemistry with the first movie, these two take it to the next level. Their 'session' is gut busting. Tatum is even funnier now. Jonah is the butt of a lot of jokes. Jillian Bell is hilarious with her dead pan humor. The self referential jokes really work. Even the case works. It's a nice step up."
Dog Day Afternoon,9,0,1,14 April 2015," funny and original
","Amateur criminals Sonny Wortzik (Al Pacino), his friend Sal Naturale (John Cazale) and Stevie try to rob the First Brooklyn Savings Bank. Stevie has second thoughts and Sonny lets him go. Then they find out that most of the money is gone after the daily cash pickup. Sonny seems to know most of the bank procedures. Then they get a call from police Sergeant Moretti (Charles Durning). The bank has been completely surrounded. It becomes a media circus and they become instant celebrity. The police finds Sonny's lover Leon Shermer (Chris Sarandon) in Bellevue. Sonny needs the money for Leon's sex change.The hostages and bumbling robbers are hilarious. It's a robbery gone wrong story where the roles are often switched around. So many of these characters are such originals. Al Pacino is giving one of his best performances of his life. That's a life filled with great performances. This is my favorite Sidney Lumet movie."
School of Rock,8,1,1,26 January 2014," Fun Joyful Movie
","Dewey Finn (Jack Black) is a slacker rocker. He's been sponging off his friend Ned (Mike White). Ned's girlfriend Patty (Sarah Silverman) is not having it and forces Dewey to start paying his share of the rent. Even Dewey's band has had it with him and fires him. He has nothing until a call for Ned to substitute teach. Dewey impersonates Ned to get the job for the pay. He's not a good teacher until he starts up a band with the kids.Director Richard Linklater and writer Mike White have created a fun enjoyable movie. And Jack Black is at his best in this movie. He's a slacker but he still has great likability. And the kids include a kiddie Miranda Cosgrove and some very talent real musical kids. They are a great foil to Dewey's cynicism. There are some great rock music, and then there is the standard band competition. This is loads of fun."
Cars 2,7,2,2,20 September 2013," some fun but not as good as the first one
","Spies Holley Shiftwell (Emily Mortimer) and Finn McMissile (Michael Caine) are trying to contact an American spy to help stop an evil plot. The problem, Mater (Larry the Cable Guy) was mistaken as the American spy. Meanwhile Mater had accepted a challenge on behave of Lightning McQueen (Owen Wilson). Although Lighting McQueen's friendship with Mater is sorely tested as Mater keeps embarrassing himself in front of the competition.The franchise is continued with this sequel. This time they added a 007 storyline. But the main storyline continues to be the friendship of Lightning McQueen and Mater. The 007 storyline gives it something different and interesting. There is some fun, but it's not as poignant as the original. It comes off as more silly especially because with an evil plot."
Amadeus,9,1,2,6 December 2014," Great F. Murray Abraham and Tom Hulce's laugh
","The movie opens with an elderly Antonio Salieri (F. Murray Abraham) confessing to killing Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart (Tom Hulce). He used to be one of the great composers of Europe but has since been forgotten. As a boy, he was jealous of Mozart. He was delighted that his boorish father died. He works his way up to being the court composer to Emperor Joseph II (Jeffrey Jones) in Vienna. He is eager to meet Mozart but finds a flamboyant immature sex-fiend. Soon his admiration turns into jealousy of Mozart's Godly gift. Mozart marries Constanze (Elizabeth Berridge).Director Milos Forman injects a lot of energy into a period piece. Tom Hulce's laugh is infectious. However it's F. Murray Abraham that is the true driver of this movie. It's his jealousy and scheming heart that creates the depths for Mozart. His older self gives so much color to his disgust for Mozart. And the music is operatic. It is not just beautiful and grand but it's also hilarious. There's also special mention to Jeffrey Jones."
The Game,5,1,3,26 September 2014," Functional gimmick expertly executed
","Nicholas Van Orton (Michael Douglas) is a lonely divorcée and extremely wealthy San Francisco investment banker. It's his 48th birthday which is the age of his father when he committed suicide in front of him. His absentee black sheep brother Conrad (Sean Penn) returns and gives him a card. What do you get for somebody who has everything? Consumer Recreation Services (CRS) which Conrad claims to be the best thing that ever happened to him. It's an unique game different for everybody. Jim Feingold (James Rebhorn) does the examination for CRS but Nicholas is rejected. Then he finds a dummy sprawled on his driveway with a CRS key and the game begins. Strange things start to happen. Waitress Christine (Deborah Kara Unger) spills on him and gets fired. They both get sucked into the CRS game.This starts too slowly. There is a general lack of energy. The first 30 minutes almost lost me waiting for things to happen. It wants to be atmospheric. David Fincher is certainly good enough but I find myself not caring about Nicholas. He's a rich annoying douche with very little to like about him. It's an interesting if somewhat unoriginal gimmick. It would probably be better as a horror. I guess it would be helpful if I am naive enough to buy into the game. It would also be helpful to have a younger, sweeter, and more innocent actress to play Christine. The movie never escapes its manufactured sensibility. The point of most of this genre is to have Nicholas act paranoid and for the audience to question his sanity. His sanity is never in doubt in the mind of the audience. It's just one insane thing happening to him after another. And the cops would never say it's OK to murder him as long as Nicholas signed the contract. It's kinda stupid but the movie asks the audience to buy into it. It's so well made that I'm fine with how crazy this game gets. However it does go one too many turn. It would have been much better to leave with a sad ending."
Kick-Ass,7,2,2,14 October 2013," Interesting Comic Movie
","Dave Lizewski (Aaron Taylor-Johnson) is an awkward high school loser who dreams to be a superhero. So he dresses up as Kick-Ass to try to fight crime. When he tries to take down drug dealers, he's overmatched and gets rescued by Mindy Macready/Hit-Girl (Chloë Grace Moretz) and her father Damon Macready/Big Daddy (Nicolas Cage). Chris D'Amico (Christopher Mintz-Plasse) has daddy issues with his crime boss father and dresses up as Red Mist.The high school guys are likable and his infatuation is charming. I like Aaron Taylor-Johnson as the dorky lead. His whole story is sweet and cute.Nicolas Cage is strangely odd. His halting speaking style gets really awkward. His chemistry with Chloë Grace Moretz is just too peculiar. I understand it's all dictated by the mannered writing, but it's just not natural.The movie does have an unusual take on the comic book hero movie. It's fun, violent, and irreverent. The big break out star is of course Chloë Grace Moretz. She's a cutie pie who truly kicks ass."
The Man Who Would Be King,7,1,4,22 February 2015," old fashion high adventure
","It's based on the Rudyard Kipling tale. Rudyard Kipling (Christopher Plummer) is approached by a ragged Peachy Carnehan (Michael Caine) who three years ago traveled to present day Afghanistan. They had met on the train. Peachy is a disillusioned soldier and looking to get a fortune. With Danny Dravot (Sean Connery), they set off on a epic journey and wild adventures. They save villagers being attacked and find helpful Gurkha soldier Billy Fish (Saeed Jaffrey) who survived a previous expedition. Danny survives an arrow during a battle and the locals believe him to be a god.I would have prefer the movie skip the Kipling part and much of the beginning. There are some fun bits but the movie gets better after the Khyber Pass. That's when the fun high adventure begins. It's old fashion stuff from director John Huston. Michael Caine and Sean Connery are great for the roles. Caine may have had a bit too much fun but that's fine by me."
Unknown,7,1,1,5 October 2013," Great paranoid premise just needs to ramp up the pace sooner
","Dr Martin Harris (Liam Neeson) and his wife Elizabeth Harris (January Jones) get into a car accident. Martin survives but when he wakes up, his wife no longer recognizes him and someone else (Aidan Quinn) has taken his place. The world becomes a place of paranoia, and the only person who helps him is the waitress Gina (Diane Kruger).It's an unusual head scratching premise. It's a mystery as to what the true story is. Is it all in his head? Or is it reality? The pace could be faster in the first half. I wish they didn't push the color spectrum so far to the the blueish green. It's obvious and distracting. Also they need to pair up Kruger and Neeson a lot sooner. As it stands, the movie is split in two. The first is a slow meditating paranoid interior film. The second half becomes a Bourne Identity film. It'd probably improve to concentrate the first half more."
Ghostbusters,9,2,3,26 October 2013," Still funny after all these years
","Director Ivan Reitman has created one of the funniest comedies of the 80s. Bill Murray, Dan Aykroyd, and Harold Ramis played three professors studying the paranormal. When they get kicked out of university, they start a business to fight ghosts.Bill Murray is at his sarcastic best. The guys' chemistry is superb. The three guys fit each other perfectly. Murray is the loud mouth. Ramis is the nerdy brain. And Aykroyd is the nice guy to glue everybody together. On top of the three leads, they have Sigourney Weaver who is a viable partner for Murray to spar with. She's not just a dumb hottie. Her persona could actually take on Murray in everyway.The jokes are hilarious even after all these years. I still laugh whenever I catch it on TV. That's the biggest test of any comedies.Don't cross the streams!"
Coyote Ugly,5,8,15,29 December 2013," Nice actress in unwatchable movie
","Violet Sanford (Piper Perabo) is an aspiring songwriter from small town New Jersey. She leaves her pizza joint waitress job, her father, and her best friend to pursue her dreams in NYC. Only the big bad city is getting the best of her. Down to her last few dollars, she tries out for a surprising job at a bar called Coyote Ugly.First, I don't know why she has to move to NYC to pursue her dreams as a songwriter. I would think New Jersey is close enough to get rejected by the music industry, and she could do a week or two. But as a songwriter, why does she have to stay there? I think it would be better if she's an actress.Then the rejections are so silly and ham fisted. It had me rolling my eyes, and hating the first act. By the time she gets to the bar, I couldn't really stand the movie. Maria Bello plays the bar owner. Izabella Miko, Tyra Banks, and Bridget Moynahan play the dancers. Other than watching some hot actresses dancing suggestively, there isn't much in this movie."
Call Me by Your Name,7,0,3,20 March 2018," Chalamet charms but Hammer not
","Somewhere in Northern Italy, the Perlman family is excited about the arrival of Oliver (Armie Hammer). He's a grad student assisting professor Perlman over the summer in the 80's. The girls are all taken with handsome Oliver including the young son Elio Perlman (Timothée Chalamet). Elio is enticed by Oliver as his friend Marzia also gets closer to him.It's a film about a young gay boy's emotional first love. There are things that do pull me out of the movie. The first problem I had was that I assumed Marzia to be Elio's sister. It's connected to another problem. Marzia should be a bigger character. She's the pawn in their love chess game. She should start much more as a girlfriend leading to a more heated conflict. There may be a deliberate move by the movie to take the dramatic conflict out of this gay love story. It becomes more of an emotional drama for better and for worst. The other problem is that Oliver does not appeal to me. He's the preppy guy from an 80's teen dramedy. It's not the most endearing. Sometimes, that character can gain depth by going darker but that would be creepy in this case. It also threatens to be that older guy seducing a young boy. Don't get me wrong. There are some very touching emotional takes. The father's talk after Oliver's departure is very sincere and the last scene with Elio's tearful closeup is very emotional. I am taken with Timothée Chalamet and his youthful charms. I'm less taken with Armie Hammer. He continues to perplex me as an actor."
Gran Torino,7,1,3,26 January 2014," Dirty Harry living in the Hood
","Walt Kowalski (Clint Eastwood) is an old Korean War hero who recently lost his loving wife. He's a hard cold man of a different generation. He's angry at young grandkids, his new Mon neighbors, and nosy Father Janovich (Christopher Carley). The next door neighbor boy is shy Thao who gets wrangled into trying to steal Walt's Gran Torino by his older gangster cousin.There are lots of easy stereotypes. Clint is playing the hard man. It might as well be the man with no name in the hood. Clint is acting with a bunch of nobodies. That's the biggest problem in this movie. The other actors are not up to snuff. The only one capable is the girl Ahney Her who can only really hold her own.In the end, we love this Clint character. That's all that matters. He is compelling, and we have all grown up with this character. We know him. The movie is the better for it."
Hero,7,0,1,7 December 2015," beautiful but story in second half problematic
","China is divided in seven warring states. The ruler of the Kingdom of Qin intends to forcibly unite the states in bloody battles. He is threatened by three elite assassins and has isolated himself. No visitor can approach 100 paces to his throne. Nameless (Jet Li) was orphaned as a child. With no family name, he worked to become the greatest swordsman. He supposedly killed the three assassins and allowed to approach the king. First he kills spearman Sky (Donnie Yen). Then he stokes jealousy between Broken Sword (Tony Leung) and Flying Snow (Maggie Cheung) with Sword's apprentice Moon (Zhang Ziyi).This is undoubtedly beautifully shot. It's a thing of supreme artistry. The battles are colorful ballets. I like very much the story in the first half. There is a twist that becomes very obvious. Then the second half starts taking more turns. Not all of them are to my liking. I was expecting a different path and I believe a superior path. There are philosophical problems and simple story problems."
Shrek the Third,7,1,3,15 August 2014," A step backwards
","Prince Charming is reduced to dinner theater and he wants revenge. King Harold is ill and Shrek is the next heir to Far, Far Away. Shrek isn't that good with being a royal and doesn't want to give up his swamp. King reveals that there is another heir named Arthur (Justin Timberlake). After the death of the King, Shrek sets off to find Artie with the help of Donkey and Puss in Boots. Princess Fiona is left at home to battle Prince Charming's attempted coup with her royal girlfriends.Starting with the king dying is a hard way to keep the tone light. Also Shrek is separated from Fiona for the bulk of the movie. Then there is the new character Artie who is the least interesting character in this world. However I still love the cast of characters in this franchise. I also love the new princesses. They are a lot of fun. This is a step back but the franchise lives on."
The Hurt Locker,8,1,2,31 August 2015," visceral experience
",It's Baghdad 2004. Sergeant J.T. Sanborn (Anthony Mackie) has a new leader in his Army Explosive Ordnance Disposal unit after losing the one before. William James (Jeremy Renner) seems to be reckless but effective. Sanborn often conflict with his methods. They encounter a group of mercenaries on their side and get ambushed. Sanborn shoots the enemy in a long distance battle. The men struggle as various random violence take a toll on them.This is the big coming out party for director Kathryn Bigelow. She shows that woman directors can be simply directors and do a great intense war film. There is a randomness to the whole situation. Jeremy Renner brings a devastating simple intensity to his performance. He doesn't give the American hero version. It's more matter-of-fact. The situations and the places are dripping with a sense of paranoia. Danger lurks at every corner. The confused world never lets go. This is a visceral experience more than a plot driven story.
No Man's Land,6,1,3,27 June 2015," good black comedy but the standoff doesn't make sense
","A group of Bosnian reinforcements gets lost in the fog at night. They wake up and get mowed down by the Serbs. Čiki finds himself alone. The Serbs send out an old veteran and newbie Nino to check. They find a body and the grizzled veteran places a bouncing mine under it. Čiki kills the veteran and takes Nino hostage. The body turns out to be Cera who isn't actually dead. The three struggle as the UNPROFOR comes to evacuate whoever is stranded in no man's land. Marchand tries to call in somebody to defuse the mine but his commander Soft insists that they leave immediately. TV reporter Jane Livingstone (Katrin Cartlidge) hears the exchange on the radio and threatens to shine a light on the ineffective UN.I really like the UN and the black comedy they do. The language barrier is always funny. The ridiculous nature of their work is good for a laugh. I'm not as enamored with the Serb and Bosnian soldiers. It bothers me that they keep not killing each other. It doesn't make any sense that the Bosnian doesn't kill Nino right away. He should kill Nino and try to sneak out during the night. After that, it seems the situation never gets right. I think it would be better to not see how they got into their situation. The movie could start with UN arriving at the checkpoint. There also has to be a better way to make a standoff situation. I wonder if the UN find the two man both stepping on a mine. They can't kill each other because the mines would blow. It would allow them to argue with no holds barred. I don't buy that these guys would take prisoners."
Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Men Tell No Tales,5,0,4,24 September 2017," stayed with it for awhile
","Henry Turner (Brenton Thwaites) has searched all his life for Captain Jack Sparrow (Johnny Depp) and the Trident of Poseidon to free his father Will Turner. Carina Smyth (Kaya Scodelario) is a feminist sentenced to be hung as a witch. She has a diary which could lead to the Trident. The trio is pursued by Captain Salazar (Javier Bardem) who escaped from the Devil's Triangle which a young Sparrow put him in. Salazar finds Captain Hector Barbossa (Geoffrey Rush) and destroys his fleet.The plot is convoluted and incomprehensible. The action is bloated and chaotic. Of course, this is a Pirates movie. None of that is surprising. I'm actually surprised that I stayed with this one for a long time. Carina is a feminist in the way that SJW is actually an apt description. It's rather annoying. Thwaites lacks charisma as the young lead and is overwhelmed by the screen. Johnny Depp is less outrageous which is both good and bad. When he's crazy, there's something to point to. I like the guillotine action scene and Salazar's flashback to his Sparrow encounter. Otherwise, everything else is either a muddle or an unlikable watch. This franchise may be unsalvagable."
K-19: The Widowmaker,5,1,2,2 December 2015," not completely compelling
","It's 1961 at the height of the Cold War. The Soviets launches one of its first ballistic missile nuclear-powered submarine K-19 to test launch a missile from under the Arctic ice cap. Executive officer Mikhail Polenin (Liam Neeson) is concerned about the many problems with the new boat. Alexei Vostrikov (Harrison Ford) is the hard-charging new Commander. After finding the Reactor Officer drunk, Vostrikov replaces him with new graduate Vadim Radtchenko (Peter Sarsgaard). It's a series of mishaps and dangerous malfunctions that threatens the safety of the crew.With a Soviet crew, it's a little harder to find the rooting interest. I never quite get to a point where I care about the outcome. It seems Neeson's character is too whiny. The accents get a bit annoying after awhile. Nevertheless, the story is quite fascinating. It's just not completely compelling to me."
The Longest Day,8,4,6,12 November 2013," Grand traditional Hollywood war movie
","This is an old fashion war movie. It looks at the invasion of Normandy from the build up to the events of D-day. It's got big stars, big scale and some big action.It was a big hit despite some discrepancies. It's a Hollywood extravaganza, not a documentary. They got John Wayne to put the big name on the headline. But they also got pre-Bond Sean Connery. The German side of the story is also well represented.The action is big. Without CG, the grand scale on the beach of the actual day is more hinted at than actually achieved on the screen. For example 'Saving Private Ryan' provides a much more visceral experience for the landing. The attack on the casino in Ouistreham looks great. Who can forget the nuns? It's really a triumph of old school filmmaking.As a complete D-day extravaganza, there really isn't a rival. It's been exceed on the actual landing depiction. And there are some notable historical errors. However it is still a landmark movie in Hollywood history."
Moulin Rouge!,7,1,3,16 April 2014," Baz Luhrmann extravaganza
",It's 1899 Paris. Christian (Ewan McGregor) is an English writer trying to take in Parisian artistic life. He befriends Toulouse-Lautrec (John Leguizamo). He gets involved with Moulin Rouge star Satine (Nicole Kidman). The club owner Harold Zidler (Jim Broadbent) has promise her to the Duke (Richard Roxburgh) if he would invest.It's got Baz Luhrmann's grand vision. It's a modern day musical. McGregor and Kidman are surprisingly good as singers. It's still not my taste but it's got the style right. Its excesses are what sells this movie. Anything less would reduce this to no more than musical theater. The story is melodramatic but it is in keeping with the tone of the movie. Even using modern songs as burlesque music seems somehow fitting if somewhat weird.
X-Men: Apocalypse,7,30,49,5 June 2016," good with a couple of problems
","En Sabah Nur is Apocalypse, the first mutant who ruled ancient Egypt until he was entombed. It's the 80's. CIA agent Moira MacTaggert goes to Egypt and witnesses his emergence. He recruits his four horsemen Magneto, Storm, Psylocke, and Angel giving them greater power. Meanwhile, Raven recruits Kurt Wagner/Nightcrawler from an East Berlin fight club. Alex Summers brings his younger brother Scott to Professor Charles Xavier's school. Quicksilver arrives at the school just in time to rescue almost everybody from an explosion but Professor X is kidnapped by Apocalypse.I really like the first half. There are some good introduction of the new characters. It's working fine for the most part. It hits the pinnacle with Quicksilver's rescue which is funny and exciting. It is visually dynamic and a joy to behold. The rest of the movie feels like a long slow slide into mediocrity.The most troubling problem for the continuing franchise is the use of Mystique as the leading X-Men. That character has never been in that role. JLaw is struggling to put out the intensity to match the central part. She and her character is not up to the task so far. It's also funny that her powers is to not be JLaw. The other problem is Apocalypse. I hoped for better but his mega-destruction is underwhelming. It's a lot of bland and his powers are nebulous. I actually think it would have been better to allow Apocalypse to be a two-parter. As an one-and-done villain, he isn't allowed to be anything more than a monster of the moment. With a lower level of power from him, it could be more compelling to struggle for the soul of each horseman. As it stands, the character Apocalypse is nothing special."
Meet Joe Black,4,1,2,30 December 2014," Susan doesn't make sense
","Media mogul Bill Parrish (Anthony Hopkins) is close to his 65th birthday. He has two daughters Susan (Claire Forlani) and Allison (Marcia Gay Harden). Allison is busy planning the celebration. Susan is a medical resident who is in a passionless relationship with Drew (Jake Weber). William tells Susan that he likes Drew as a business underling but he doesn't sense that she truly loves him. He urges her to find true love. In a diner, she meets a young flirtatious man (Brad Pitt). He seems to melt her heart but unbeknownst to her, he is killed crossing a street. Bill keeps hearing a voice which is Death who comes to visit and learn from Bill. He takes on the name Joe Black.Throughout the entire movie, I kept trying to work out what Susan thinks about Joe Black. The best that I can come up with is that he's really pretty. The problem is that I completely bought into their first encounter. Brad Pitt is quite charming as well as being pretty. I don't understand her thinking after seeing him acting like a completely different person. He's either faking the first encounter or he's faking later. At the very least, he's up to no good. The movie seems to use Pitt's pretty face as a patch-all for any deficiencies. Basically she falls for two different personalities. The only thing that stays the same is the pretty pretty Brad Pitt.The second half has a bit better chemistry between Pitt and Hopkins. At least, their story gets a bit interesting. However it doesn't solve the original problem or make it bearable to sit for 3 hours through this. The best way to solve some of these problems is just to cut out the diner scene. It wouldn't change much in the plot and the story would make more sense."
Slap Shot,8,3,3,1 December 2013," Funniest hockey movie
","The Charlestown Chiefs is a hopeless losing hockey team in fifth place. The team has to do ridiculous events to make extra cash. Reggie Dunlop (Paul Newman) is a player/coach with a rag tag team with the latest being the goonish Hanson brothers. Their best player Ned Braden (Michael Ontkean) has a jealous wife (Lindsay Crouse) who hates the small town. With the town's mill closing, the team has to close at the end of the season. Reggie Dunlop decides to pump up the team and attendance by planting a story of the team moving to Florida and starts playing goon hockey.This is an inappropriate movie and it's all the more funnier because of it. It is possibly the funniest hockey movie of all times. Director George Roy Hill rejoins Paul Newman after the success of Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid and The Sting. It is more fun and more hilarious than either one. However you have to prepare for the language, the homophobia, and the goon hockey. It's certainly not a pretty movie."
The Amazing Spider-Man 2,6,1,6,7 March 2015," great chemistry between Andrew Garfield and Emma Stone
","Peter Parker's father Richard (Campbell Scott) was a scientist working on a secret project. While Peter was a child, Peter's parents were attacked on a plane killing them but not before he was able to upload a computer file. Peter (Andrew Garfield) and Gwen Stacy (Emma Stone) are graduating from high school. However it's getting too dangerous and he breaks up with her. Max Dillon (Jamie Foxx) is a lowly electrical engineer working at Oscorp. He gets electrocuted and bitten by an electric eel becoming Electro. Harry Osborn (Dane DeHaan) returns home to take over from his dying father as CEO of Oscorp and eventually becomes Green Goblin. Felicia (Felicity Jones) was his father's assistant and now is Harry's. Donald Menken (Colm Feore) is Oscorp vice-president. At the end, Russian gangster Aleksei Sytsevich (Paul Giamatti) is turned into Rhino.Everything is so choppy. It's like the movie needed to hit so many specific plot points. The movie has no flow. The plot developments keep coming and coming without letting the characters breathe. The best part by far is the chemistry between Andrew Garfield and Emma Stone. The movie is better every time they are together on the screen. Without them, I would definitely fail this because this is generally a mess. Jamie Foxx is being a ridiculous cartoon as Max Dillon. As Electro, he's much better. Dane DeHaan is very good but Green Goblin is completely rushed. Again the movie is jamming so much into this. Also I don't know why people keep hanging around to watch as chaos ensues. Electro is wrecking Time Square and people are gathered around to cheer like it's New Year's Eve. There are so many ideas going on like Peter's parents and corporate intrigue. There is enough material for two movies and would probably be better as that."
Ex Machina,8,2,6,1 January 2016," great smaller sci-fi treat
",Caleb (Domhnall Gleeson) is a computer programmer at the biggest internet company which has a search engine and Bluebook. He's brought to the remote compound of its owner Nathan (Oscar Isaac). Nathan gives him a week to perform a Turing test on his new AI in the form of Ava (Alicia Vikander).Domhnall Gleeson has to sell this if it's to work. Alicia Vikander is more than a hot girl which helps a lot. I find Oscar Isaac playing only one note. This led me to a wrong guess. The resolution is an interesting one and not necessarily my expected one. The concepts are really interesting and this indie has a great look. Ava is hypnotic. This is one of the best smaller sci-fi from Alex Garland who's usually a writer.
Back to the Future Part III,6,3,6,14 October 2013," Too silly with the Old West
","This movie continues from BTTF2. Marty McFly (Michael J Fox) is stuck in 1955 and Doc Brown (Christopher Lloyd) is stuck 1885. Doc is happy where he is, and he left the broken DeLorean to Marty. When they find that Doc gets killed only a week after leaving Marty the letter, Marty must repair the DeLorean, return to the Old West, and rescue Doc from his premature demise.While I understand the allure of going to the old West for director Robert Zemeckis, it just makes the movie seem hokey. I understand to go back to the 1955 Well a third time would be too complicated. The old west has a lot of Hollywood traditions tied in. But it feels like little more than one of those frontier amusement recreations. It's no longer profound, and it's the end of the franchise."
The Twilight Saga: New Moon,5,1,3,28 June 2015," depressing Bella, for fans only
","Bella Swan (Kristen Stewart) is turning 18 and she's haunted about growing old while Edward Cullen (Robert Pattinson) stays the same. The Cullens throw her a party but Jasper gets overwhelmed by her blood. Edward refuses to turn her and the Cullens leave town. Mike tries to woo Bella. She starts to spend time with Jacob Black (Taylor Lautner) and discovers that some of his tribe turn into werewolves. In despair, she starts risking her life for glimpses of Edward. After a particularly dangerous stunt, Jacob tells Edward that Bella is dead. Edward decides to end it all with the help of the Volturi, a powerful vampire coven in Italy, led by Aro (Michael Sheen). Alice Cullen (Ashley Greene) brings Bella to rescue Edward. The Volturi discovers that Bella is immune to their powers and Alice saves them by promising to converted her.The dialogue is horrible. Every line is like something written by a high school kid. Bella is unrelentingly depressed from the very beginning. It's a continuation for the franchise which will be fine for fans. For everybody else, it's a slow slide into irrelevance. There is minor interest in Jacob versus Edward. However it's not done that well. Taylor Lautner's acting abilities resides mainly with his chest. It's not a good movie but it'll do for fans."
Patton,10,2,3,25 September 2014," George C. Scott performance impressive
","General George S. Patton (George C. Scott) is the famous tank commander of World War II. It starts in 1943 after the major American defeat at the Kasserine Pass in North Africa. General Omar Bradley (Karl Malden) inspects the damage and leaves Patton in charge to pick up the pieces. Patton is larger than life who believes in reincarnation. It would follow him through the war until his death after the war.This movie starts with the iconic scene of Patton in front of the giant red, white, and blue. It doesn't let up as Scott powerfully delivers his best performance ever. The scale of this movie is grand. The action is well done for its time, but this is more than a war movie. This is a character study of one of the most fascinating personalities in the war and cinema. Scott deserved the Oscar win even though he refused to accept it. This is the best movie of that year."
La Grande Illusion,7,2,2,23 April 2014," The French Great Escape in WWI
","During WWI, French aviators aristocratic Captain de Boeldieu and working class Lieutenant Maréchal are taken prisoners. Boeldieu and the victorious aristocrat German aviator von Rauffenstein actually has a lot in common. The two captives have differing experiences finally arriving in Wintersborn prison commanded by von Rauffenstein. The prison duo and Rosenthal try to escape.There are some interesting parts in the first half. It's about 50 minutes when they get to the castle prison. A modern POW escape movie would send them to one place and let the tension built. The second half is closer to that idea. The castle prison isn't the most impressive or the most forbidding. That holds back the movie a little.The characters are well drawn. The actors are very natural. Beside an escape movie, this is very much a relationship movie. It's their different backgrounds and their connections that make this more. It's a fairly compelling movie but it's not really a war movie. There is very little action or even gun fire. This is more of a human relations movie. I do wish that the original duo stay together throughout the movie. That way their relationship could develop more."
The Illusionist,7,1,1,14 December 2015," beautiful and generally good
","It's late 19th century Vienna. Chief Inspector Walter Uhl (Paul Giamatti) is arresting illusionist Eisenheim (Edward Norton) for Crown Prince Leopold (Rufus Sewell). Uhl recounts Eisenheim's life story to the Prince. Young poor Eisenheim was in love with high born Duchess Sophie but they were separated by force. He wanders the world learning illusions and returns to find Sophie (Jessica Biel) engaged to arrogant Prince Leopold. The prince dislikes Eisenheim and is also scheming to overthrow his father, King Leopold of the Austro-Hungarian Empire.The film looks beautiful with great looking sets. The acting is generally good. Giamatti is playing a conflicted character. Biel is better than her usual self. Norton is a compelling lead. Sewell is suitably villainy. I like this film although I would like a bit more intensity. There is mostly a brooding tension. Also the final twist is not surprising but it is fitting."
Fantastic 4: Rise of the Silver Surfer,7,1,3,28 September 2013," Better than the first
","Mr. Fantastic/Reed Richards (Ioan Gruffudd), Invisible Woman/Sue Storm (Jessica Alba), Human Torch/Johnny Storm (Chris Evans), and The Thing/Ben Grimm (Michael Chiklis) make up the Fantastic 4. This time they are much more like a bickering family. Reed and Sue are getting married, but superhero stuff keep getting in the way. They introduce the mysterious character of the Silver Surfer, and Dr. Doom (Julian McMahon) is back causing problems.The best part of this movie is the family dynamics. They feel like a real family having family problems. They have much more chemistry this time around. The most fascinating must be the Silver Surfer. He's definitely the character with the most promise. But he's neither the good guy nor the bad guy. The moral ambiguity really muddies the waters. It's fascinating. The most disappointing must be Galactus. For a planet destroyer, the ending seems too tame. The final confrontation just wasn't special enough."
Grudge Match,5,0,1,4 June 2014," Not as bad as I fear
","Henry 'Razor' Sharp (Sylvester Stallone) and Billy 'The Kid' McDonnen (Robert De Niro) were the toughest of rivals. At the height of their rivalry with a big fight coming up, Razor abandons his boxing career and retires after Billy gets his girlfriend Sally Rose pregnant. Now 30 years later, Razor is working a lunch box job while Billy is still living off of his past success. Dante Slate Jr. (Kevin Hart) is the son of their late former promoter who comes to them with a job for a video game. Billy ambushes Razor at the video game taping and starts a fight. The fight goes viral and Dante has a new opportunity. He offers them $100k each to fight for real. Razor gets his old trainer Louis Conlon (Alan Arkin) to help. Sally (Kim Basinger) and the long lost son B.J. (Jon Bernthal) re-enter their lives.It's not as horrible as I feared. The big problem is that most of the jokes don't work. Even the red hot Kevin Hart can't solve that problem. He's not in it enough anyways. This movie almost works with the dysfunctional personal drama, but it's a little too slow. Kim Basinger and Stallone have very awkward chemistry. DeNiro has a better time with his new family. It's a lot of geezer jokes and geezer training. There are a couple of smirk-worthy moments like Razor almost punching the slabs of meat or Alan Arkin having fun with Kevin Hart. The movie has its moments but the ending drags on and on. It turns into way too serious of a fight. Stallone just can't let go of Rocky. Peter Segal is not a favored comedic director of mine. This does not improve my opinion of him."
Nausicaä of the Valley of the Wind,8,1,3,25 March 2014," Imaginative and wonderful
","In a thousand years in the future, the world is struggling against giant insects and a poisonous encroaching jungle. Nausicaä is a young princess of the people of the Valley of the Wind. It's a small kingdom ruled by King Jil. They are constantly defending the Valley from the gigantic Ohm insects and poisonous plant spores. Then they are attacked by the Tolmekians led by Princess Kushana. The Tolmekians are trying to reassemble an ancient Giant Warrior to burn all the jungle. When Nausicaä escapes, she discovers that the jungle may not be the source of the poison.It's a wonderfully imaginative movie. It's an early full length movie directorial effort from brilliant Japanese animation master Hayao Miyazaki. The only thing is that it takes place in a world that is all too real. I wish that it is much more other worldly. Maybe if it takes place in an alien world. There is a small nagging realism question when it's trying to explain nature and the poison. However I'm willing to sidestep all of it and just feel the central message rather than trying to think too much about it."
The Curious Case of Benjamin Button,6,1,2,7 May 2014," Fascinating but not the most compelling
","On her death bed, Daisy (Cate Blanchett) recounts the story of blind clockmaker Mr Gateau to her daughter Caroline (Julia Ormond). In 1918, Mr Gateau made the train station clock that runs backwards to commemorate his son as well as countless other lost in the great war. Daisy asks Caroline to read the diary of Benjamin Button (Brad Pitt). He was born on the night when WWI ended. His mother died in childbirth. He was born horribly old and his father almost threw him into the waters. He is left on the doorstep of Miss Queenie (Taraji P. Henson) who ran an old age home. As he ages, he appears younger and younger.Director David Fincher has created a fable. It's darn interesting, but I can't say it's a compelling watch. It's fascinating without being exciting. It has very little tension or suspense. The workmanship is excellent, but the slow pace really tests anybody's endurance. It's a marvel of technology to see Brad Pitt in BB's every incarnation. But it takes too long to get to the heart of the movie which is the romance with Daisy. Also the age difference in their appearance make the romance kind of awkward. I think it would be better for them to meet at a later date, and start the movie then. The movie is basically one big flashback. I think the movie should flashback to his childhood only as needed. Take away the reverse aging, this is a movie about a long winding life. It's a little too long and too winding for my taste."
Transformers,7,1,3,1 December 2013," great action better than expected
",The Autobots and the Decepticons bring their war from the planet of Cybertron to Earth. They battle for the Allspark which is a mystical source of unimaginable power. Sam Witwicky (Shia LaBeouf) has artifacts from his grandfather who met a giant robot in his arctic expedition.This is a much better movie than I could ever expect. I had serious reservations when I first heard that Michael Bay was going to make a live action Transformers movie. The CGI looks great. Shia LaBeouf and Megan Fox actually work. They have spark and charisma. The action is massive and impressive.It's the story where the movie has a few problems. It's convolute and too complicated. But nobody watches this for the story. We watch it for the action.
Pawn Sacrifice,8,0,0,27 August 2016," obsession and madness
","Bobby Fischer (Tobey Maguire) is a chess master and Russian Boris Spassky (Liev Schreiber) is his nemesis. His mother is a Russian immigrant who instilled a fear of spying in him. They don't get along and become estranged. As he rises in chess rankings, he is confronted by the Russian chess players playing as a team. He quits calling them cheaters. Lawyer Paul Marshall (Michael Stuhlbarg) recruits Bobby to continue playing as a way to fight the Cold War. Father Bill Lombardy (Peter Sarsgaard) is his constant companion and the only friend who understands since he beat both Bobby and Boris when they were young. Bobby's mind deteriorates and he gets more paranoid. His sister Joan Fischer (Lily Rabe) fears for his mental health.Tobey Maguire delivers an intriguing performance of obsession and growing madness. The chess is more compelling than expected. The big match between Fischer and Spassky turns into psychological warfare. It touches on the specific era of the Cold War. It's a maddening character study and a surprisingly effective thriller."
Men in Black II,6,0,0,19 October 2013," Chemistry is off
","Serleena (Lara Flynn Boyle) is an alien looking for the Light of Zartha. Agent Jay (Will Smith) must reunites with Agent Kay (Tommy Lee Jones), who's been living as civilian, to stop Serleena before it's too late.It starts off wrong with Tommy Lee Jones missing for the first 30 minutes. It just throws the whole chemistry of the movie off. It still has the MIB style. Once TLJ returns, it recovers somewhat, but the scavenger hunt plot just rambles on. There's really only two things we watch this for; the weird and fun style, and the chemistry between the two leads. The weird stuff is there. For some reason, the chemistry never gets back to the fun that was the first movie. It has to be Agent Kay who just isn't himself for much of the movie."
Wimbledon,6,1,2,27 September 2013," barely passable rom-com
","Peter Colt (Paul Bettany) is an aging English tennis player. His ranking has slipped from 11th to 119th in the world. He is considering what to do next after this final Wimbledon. Then he encounters Lizzie Bradbury (Kirsten Dunst) when he enters the wrong hotel room. She's a rising American tennis star. Sam Neill plays her controlling father Dennis.For a sports movie, it just doesn't have the energy. The action isn't that compelling. It's just isn't shot well.Peter is a tired character, and it infects the movie especially early on. And his nagging narrations do not energize it in the least. Kirsten Dunst is doing her flirty best. The chemistry between the leads isn't all there. As a rom-com, it's barely passable."
Magic Mike XXL,5,2,2,8 March 2016," early fun
","Mike (Channing Tatum) is working his dream of making furniture but he's barely scrapping by. Dallas has left the Kings of Tampa behind and the guys are looking for one last blow-out. Big Dick Richie (Joe Manganiello), Tarzan (Kevin Nash), Ken (Matt Bomer), Tito (Adam Rodriguez), and MC Tobias (Gabriel Iglesias) are going on a road trip to a convention in Myrtle Beach run by Paris (Elizabeth Banks). When Tobias gets hurt in a crash, Mike recruits Rome (Jada Pinkett Smith) who brings along Andre (Donald Glover). Mike falls for Zoe (Amber Heard) but the guys are joined by her mother Nancy Davidson (Andie MacDowell) and her friends.I like the first thirty minutes or so. It kept some of the Soderbergh style. I like Manganiello who is very charming and a little funny. I love him in the convenient store. It's the most innocent fun and I wish the movie stays with that feel. The movie should stay with the six guys having misadventures on the road on their way to the big gig. Then it tries to replace Matthew McConaughey with Jada Pinkett Smith. Matthew stole the first movie. Jada seems to be trying to repeat the feat but it's not the same. Then it tries to inject Glover in with the group which only jumbles up the chemistry once again. The Andie MacDowell section is interesting and it would be great as a companion scene to other more humorous scenes. The last thirty minutes is a long series of stripper performances. I'm sure it's orgasmic for middle aged girlfriends drinking their wines but it gets pretty boring for me. I like the first act but the movie loses a little bit of chemistry when it sets aside Iglesias."
Hidden Figures,7,5,12,30 January 2017," great story
","Katherine Johnson (Taraji P. Henson), Dorothy Vaughan (Octavia Spencer), and Mary Jackson (Janelle Monáe) work at NASA's Langley colored calculating division in the still segregated Virginia. The facility is waiting for the new IBM computers and calculations are done by hand. The Russians are rocketing ahead. Katherine is assigned to director Al Harrison (Kevin Costner) who is under pressure to launch an American into space. Dorothy is a supervisor in practice but Vivian Mitchell (Kirsten Dunst) won't let her have the title. When the IBM computers are installed, Dorothy quickly learns to be an expert programmer leading the other colored girls. Mary must fight to attend an all-white school to be an engineer. The hard work culminates in John Glenn's flight on Friendship 7.This story is a great unknown American history. Sometimes, it pushes too hard on the social commentary button. It's not really necessary since the story lays it out so well. There is no need for Taraji to make that big speech. A simple proclamation of her bathroom use and the fact that she's dripping wet should be enough to allow for a great moment for Al Harrison. There is also no need for him to take down the bathroom signs in such a theatrical way. The problem with these theatrical moves is the diminishment of the inherit power of those moments. Instead of commenting on the coffee pot, somebody could later drink her coffee as a point of transformation. While it doesn't make the movie bad, it is unnecessary for this great story."
Coco,8,2,3,19 February 2018," imaginative world, appealing characters, compelling adventure
","In Mexico, a girl's musician father leaves the family in search for fame and never returns. Her mother Imelda Rivera bans all music and goes into shoe making. The little girl grows up and becomes Miguel's senile grandmother Coco. The family follows Imelda's footsteps into shoe making and music hating. Miguel reveres late music legend Ernesto de la Cruz and secretly aspires to be a musician. When he tries to steal Ernesto's guitar, he falls into the land of the dead and reunites with his dead ancestors.This is an imaginative world with appealing characters and a compelling adventure. It has the terrific Pixar animation. Basically, it hits all the right notes and ends with a tear jerking climax. The has been animated movies about the Day of the Dead which may be diluting some of the impact. It is nevertheless quite a fun movie for the entire family."

His father (James Caan) is tired of it all and forces him to work at his bait and tackle store.One thing their town is known for is sardine. They closed the cannery down and the town is in a funk. It's not only the economy but it's also all the sardines. Everybody eats only sardines. So Flint try to invent a machine to make a cheese burger. The machine gets sent to the atmosphere where it creates food which rain down on the town. At first, it's wonderful but things get out of hand.The animation is nice and the characters are likable. It's a good family movie with some harmless goofy fun. I like the brightly colored style which fits the story quite well."
1917,8,0,3,13 March 2020," exceptionally filmed
","Lance Corporals Blake and Schofield are given an urgent message by General Erinmore to deliver to a cut-off unit to stop a planned attack. They travel across abandoned German positions and across German lines facing many dangers.This is directed by Sam Mendes with cinematography by the great Roger Deakins. It's a faux continuous shot. It's masterfully filmed. The tension is more limited until the action starts. It tries to raise the emotional content after the plane crash. It would work better if Blake starts as the main character. It could have been a great shock. That's what this movie lacks. It doesn't have the bite of great twists and turns other than the great resolution. Nevertheless, this is an exceptionally filmed war action movie and that it is worth every penny."
Lincoln,8,2,3,31 August 2013," All the President's Men
","Director Steven Spielberg takes on the much examined life of President Lincoln, except it's Lincoln the politician based on Doris Kearns Goodwin's book.It's not about the pretty speeches or the vast battles. It's about the petty politics, and his schemes as he drives the 13th Amendment to ban slavery.Daniel Day-Lewis leads a stellar cast, but he still outshines them all. He is inhabiting his role as the president. Sally Field is the First Wife although I thought she was too pretty. The cast is chalk full of masters and masters-to-be. And the story behind scenes is eye opening, and just so modern."
Sing Street,8,3,5,31 December 2016," sweet coming-of-age
","It's 80's Dublin. Economy is bad and everybody is leaving for London. Conor Lawlor's parents are cutting back on costs and he's forced to attend the Christian Brothers School on Synge Street. He's picked on by school bully Barry Bray and Brother Baxter insists on black shoes. He's befriended by diminutive Darren Mulvey. He gets aspiring model Raphina to be his video vixen. Now, all he needs is a band so that he can shoot the video. His older brother has such sage advise as 'No woman can truly love a man who listens to Phil Collins.' and be 'Happy-Sad'.This is one part nostalgia, one part sweet coming-of-age, and one part family dysfunction. All three are great and they work well together. The kids are great. The songs are alright. It needs a catchy tune like Once where it sells the movie. In the end, the songs are mostly amateurish like the characters themselves. The story touches all the right spots. It is sweet and sour. Above all, one really like these characters."
Rules of Engagement,5,3,5,20 December 2014," Terrific action but not good everything else
","During the Vietnam War, Marine Terry Childers (Samuel L. Jackson) executes a prisoner to intimidate a North Vietnamese officer into calling off an attack on his unit and thereby saving the life of Hays Hodges (Tommy Lee Jones). Years later, Hodges is retired and Childers leads a group of Marines sent to relief the embassy in Yemen. Ambassador Mourain (Ben Kingsley) is begging to evacuate and Childers loses 3 men. He orders return fire and 83 civilians are killed. National Security Adviser Bill Sokal (Bruce Greenwood) is angry and intends to make Childers the scapegoat. Childers faces court martial and he asks Hodges to defend him. Maj. Mark Biggs (Guy Pearce) prosecutes.The first thing director William Friedkin has to decide is whether we root for Childers or not. Every step forward is followed by a step backwards. He's working at cross purposes with himself. The action scenes at the embassy are terrific. Friedkin is still at his best doing action. However he should hold those scenes for later in the movie. That way the movie can play with his guilt and innocence. Also the movie skimps on the CSI aspects. It's really questionable how everybody just skips over the snipers across the way. There were snipers but nobody cares. Also Greenwood is basically a cartoon villain. The politics is simplified to a ridiculous amount. The whole thing feels manufactured and not well done. Then the closing credits force a happy ending wrapped up in a nice little bow. That's almost as ridiculous as everything else."

","Maximillian Cohen is sickly and math obsessed. He is building his Euclid computer in his small New York apartment as a way to understand and predict the world. Sol Robeson is his mentor. Religious Jew Lenny Meyer introduces him to the mathematical nature of Hebrew and the Torah. He finds that the computer predicted the correct stock price. He is also hounded by Marcy Dawson from a powerful financial consortium. They offer him a supercomputer chip. The computer outputs a number and everybody wants it.This is a debut from Darren Aronofsky with great originality. It has great paranoid thriller vibe. The music, the style, and Max all build a great obsessive mood. There are some things to nit-pick. The camera work is strictly indie. The action scenes are a little dizzying and not in a good way. It's unlikely that Aronofsky had the equipment to do better although some low-budget indies do better somehow. The acting from some of the secondary characters could also be better. They are all understandable indie deficiencies."
Kelly's Heroes,8,4,5,2 May 2015," Sutherland hippilarious in irreverent WWII heist movie
","Kelly (Clint Eastwood) goes behind the lines and capture a German Colonel. Big Joe (Telly Savalas) is more interested in women and hotels than any military intelligence. They are getting hit by their own fire as well as the Germans. Kelly discovers that the Germans are actually transporting gold. As everybody pulls out, Kelly intends to steal the gold with a few of his fellow soldiers. Their Captain is more concerned about transporting a yacht to Paris while his men take a 3 day rest in the middle of nowhere. Crapgame (Don Rickles) is an opportunistic supply sergeant. They recruit Oddball (Donald Sutherland) and his three Sherman tanks. The gungho General Colt (Carroll O'Connor) berates his men for their lack of fighting spirit. When Kelly's men break through, he eagerly follows their advance.This is a fun WWII movie. It's really a heist movie. The war is full of ridiculousness. This has more in common with MASH and that's not simply about Sutherland. He does create one of most memorable characters around. He is hippilarious. It's an irreverent take on the chaos and the incompetence of war. There are a lot of action blowing up lots of stuff. It's one of those movies where lots of Germans get killed. At the core, it's a really fun heist movie."
Empire Records,7,0,0,13 May 2016," crazy wild fun
","A group of young people work at the independent Empire Records. While closing up, Lucas (Rory Cochrane) discovers a contract in manager Joe Reaves (Anthony LaPaglia)'s office to sell out the store to big corporate Music Town. Lucas tries his luck with the store's cash to save the place and promptly loses $9k in Atlantic City. The next morning, A.J. (Johnny Whitworth) and Mark (Ethan Embry) are the first at the store. Corey Mason (Liv Tyler) and flirty friend Gina (Renée Zellweger) have a crush on 80's pop star Rex Manning (Maxwell Caulfield) who is coming to the store. His time is mostly pass and even his assistant Jane (Debi Mazar) doesn't like his music. Angry Deb (Robin Tunney) shaves her head. A.J. vows to reveal his love for Corey. They catch a young shoplifter who claims to be Warren Beatty. It's going to be a crazy day.This is a crazy wild mess of young people fun. The music is loud and mostly good. The story is full of teen angst. The best is the cast of great young up and comers. Tyler and Zellweger are in short skirts. Tunney actually shaves her hair. It's lots of teen melodramatic fun. The characters are appealing. It's certainly possible to be get-off-my-lawn on this movie but not me. Even a bad sleazy Maxwell Caulfield can't get me out of this movie."
Children of Men,8,1,3,20 October 2013," Daring vision from Cuarón
","The world has collapsed when nobody is able to conceive any more children. It's 2027 in a dystopian London where they still try to maintain civilization in a crumbling infrastructure despite the terrorism of rebel group The Fishes. Theo Faron (Clive Owen) is drawn into intrigue when Fishes kidnaps him. Only it's his ex-wife Julian (Julianne Moore) that executed the capture. She asks for his help with someone truly special.Director Alfonso Cuarón has adapted an imaginative sci-fi premise with his personal vision of a dark apocalyptic future. The plot is dense with dreadful energy. Through it all, Clive Owen is able to maintain his persona of the everyman. He maintains believability in this semi-realistic future. There are long stretches of moody grumpy scenes of tired people. The police state can get quite dark. When the action does come, it gets very intense and very real with some very long takes of intricate action. The final scenes are as profound as anything ever on film."
Million Dollar Baby,8,3,5,6 January 2014," Clint Eastwood turns in another great movie
","Frankie Dunn (Clint Eastwood) is an old hand at training. His latest fighter (Anthony Mackie) doesn't have the heart and he's reluctant to get him the championship shot. Maggie Fitzgerald (Hilary Swank) is a self professed white trash. She scrounge enough money for the gym, but Frankie refuses to train her because she's too old. She won't give up, and with the help an old retired fighter Eddie Dupris (Morgan Freeman), she convinces Frankie to give her a chance.This is a great standard underdog sports story for 3/4 of the movie. It works great. Clint and Morgan are old hands at this. They cancel each other a bit with their grumbling voices and their gruff demeanor. Hilary Swank is perfect for the role. She's no princess. She can definitely play the hungry white trash role.Then the last 30 minutes turn dark. It's a change in tone. It has difficult things to say. If it could be edited down, it could be even better. After the big climatic fight, the final ending takes a little too long. But that's a minor pacing problem in an otherwise compelling great movie."
Garden State,8,1,1,14 January 2014," Great first indie from Zach Braff
","Andrew Largeman (Zach Braff) is a troubled, depressed, and heavily medicated actor who once played a retarded quarterback on TV. He's now just a waiter in LA. He returns home to his mother's funeral, and his overbearing psychiatrist father (Ian Holm). He reconnects with an old friend Mark (Peter Sarsgaard), and new girl Sam (Natalie Portman).Written and directed by Zach Braff, this is a very impressive big screen debut for him. He has a good eye for interesting visuals. The story does meander as he drifts. It has an ethereal aimless feel to the movie. That is until he meets Natalie Portman. She's at her height of her IT girl phase, and there is a great reason for it. She's completely magnetic on screen. It's easy why anyone would fall head over heels for her. She plays the MPDG who brings him out of his depression."
Donnie Brasco,7,0,2,13 April 2014," Not as intense as I hoped but still has good performances
","FBI agent Joe Pistone (Johnny Depp) goes undercover to infiltrate the mob as Donnie Brasco. Benjamin 'Lefty' Ruggiero (Al Pacino) is a wearied survivor mob soldier who takes in the street smart Brasco under his wing. As their boss Sonny Black (Michael Madsen) rise up, Pistone is there to gather the evidence as his marriage to Maggie (Anne Heche) suffers. Ruggiero dreams of getting away from the untrustworthy Black.This is base on a true story, and with two of the greatest talents around, I hoped for better. I hoped for better intensity. It has the era, the mannerism, and the style. Pacino is giving a slightly different take on the wise guy. Depp is stepping up. The performances are spot on. It's great that it's a true story. But the movie basically shows all its cards early on. I would probably consider not revealing the FBI undercover story or have their bosses push them harder. Something is needed to drive up the tension. The movie just doesn't translate the danger onto the screen. Director Mike Newell really needs to amp up every cinematic opportunity to represent danger. For example, Donnie finds a picture of their Miami boat in a magazine on the plane. A more compelling scene would have somebody almost picking up the same magazine or even pick up that magazine. True or not, the director needs to pump up the tension."
Casualties of War,5,3,9,29 October 2014," Compelling story but need grittier visual style
","Max Eriksson (Michael J. Fox) is a Vietnam vet haunted by an incident during the war. Sgt. Tony Meserve (Sean Penn) leads a squad of five soldiers. He's hard-nosed and then his longtime friend gets hit. Eriksson is still considered cherry. PFC Diaz (John Leguizamo) is the new replacement. Along with Cpl. Clark (Don Harvey) and PFC Hatcher (John C. Reilly), the group kidnaps a village girl and rapes her.I have some problems with the realism of the look. It's the way director Brian De Palma shoots some of the action. At least twice, he uses the background to show action while in the foreground a character looks forward. It's a very manufactured look and takes away from the realism that this movie desperately needs. MJF does the ethical naive jittery newbie but something about him strikes me unrealistic. He's not up to the drama. It's not gritty enough. I feel it would be more intense if he kept more quiet. The character needs to have some more internal conflict. On the other, Sean Penn nails it as the disturbed leader of the squad. But that just emphasized the lack of drama acting coming from MJF."
Event Horizon,6,1,2,8 August 2015," sci-fi haunted ship horror had potential
","The first permanent moon base is established in 2015 and commercial mining on Mars begins in 2032. In 2040, research vessel Event Horizon is launched. It disappears past Neptune. In 2047, spaceship Lewis and Clark is sent to investigate. The crew consists of Captain Miller (Laurence Fishburne), Lieutenant Starck (Joely Richardson), pilot Smith (Sean Pertwee), Medical Technician Peters (Kathleen Quinlan), Engineer Ensign Justin (Jack Noseworthy), Rescue Technician Cooper (Richard T. Jones), and Trauma Doctor D.J. (Jason Isaacs). Event Horizon's designer Dr. William Weir (Sam Neill) joins them and tells the crew about its innovative gravity drive.The design is interesting and this has the potential to be a pretty good sci-fi horror. This is essentially a haunted house but the chaos overwhelms the movie. Sam Neill doesn't really fit as the mad scientist type. That role needs somebody creepier. Captain Miller is too clueless. In fact, Starck is a smarter character and in a better movie, she would be revealed as the lead. This movie has a great cast, an interesting look and great potential. It's too bad that it's not actually that good."

Only nobody really understands and he only has limited knowledge himself. Rag doll Sally loves Jack but fears his obsession will turn disastrous when he tries to take over Christmas. It is a wild world of imagination. It is a visual delight of macabre wonderfulness. It is childlike for the kids. It's outlandish for the adults. Jack is a charming character. This is fun and original."

",Mikael Blomkvist is the publisher of Millennium magazine. He loses a libel case brought by billionaire financier Hans-Erik Wennerström. He is setup and found guilty. He is sentenced to three months and a large fine. Lisbeth Salander is a skilled hacker hired to follow him by Henrik Vanger. Henrik is the patriarch of an old wealthy family. He wants to hire Blomkvist to investigate the disappearance of his niece Harriet who vanished in 1966. He believes that she was killed by a family member but her body was never found. Blomkvist's father used to work for the family and he visited them as a child. Lisbeth is given a new creepy guardian.It is dark. It is as complicated as any murder mystery. It is disturbingly graphic and Noomi Rapace's performance is gripping. She's the great discovery in this movie. The nordic feel adds to the cold atmosphere. The whole movie is filled with this feeling of dread. It is truly chilling.
"Good Night, and Good Luck.",6,0,0,30 August 2016," inside baseball
","It's 1953. CBS journalist Edward R. Murrow (David Strathairn) leads an on-air fight against Senator Joseph McCarthy and his crusade to uncover communists and other unamerican activities. The film follows the CBS news team which includes producer Fred Friendly (George Clooney), reporter Joseph Wershba (Robert Downey Jr.), wife fellow reporter Shirley Wershba (Patricia Clarkson), and others.George Clooney is also the writer and director. He decided to strip this of its Hollywood flash by making it black and white, and keeping the sound design to a minimum. It's a smoke-filled representation of the behind the scenes work in the newsroom. It doesn't have the tension for me. It's inside-baseball for the journalist crowd. Clooney can't escape being Clooney and it's hard to see these characters as flesh and blood. The story could have better tension if McCarthy has an actor playing the group's foil. The news footage serves an useful historical reference but it needs a big performance to deliver the intense drama."
Big Hero 6,7,3,8,2 May 2015," good origin story but problematic villain true identity
","Hiro Hamada is a young robotics genius in San Fransokyo. He spends his time in underground robot fights. Hiro's brother Tadashi takes him to the robotics team at his university mentored by professor Callaghan and shows him his inflatable medical robot Baymax. To get onto the team, Hiro creates a swarm of microbots. It impresses sleazy businessman Alastair Krei and he offers to buy them. Hiro refuses and then a fire engulfs the convention center. Both Callaghan and Tadashi are presumed dead. Using Baymax and a leftover microbot, Hiro discovers a masked man has copied vast numbers of his microbots. With Tadashi's friends and Baymax, they battle the masked man.This is a fun superhero animated movie. The colors are brilliant and the animation is top-notch. It's full of action and it's emotionally dense. Hiro is a reasonable lead. The rest of the team is even better. They are a memorable diverse group. Baymax is super cute. The villain is where the movie falls down a little. While the masked man looks cool, the twist reveal leaves a lot to be desired. There are a lot about the identity of the villain that doesn't make sense. I'm not going to comment further about that so as to not spoil anything. This is still a solid superhero origin story."
Resident Evil: Apocalypse,5,0,2,2 January 2014," Director Alexander Witt not up to it
","The Umbrella corporation's secret underground lab quarantine has been breached. Zombies and other mutants are escaping into Raccoon city up above. Umbrella has sealed off the city, and intends to nuke it to wipe out any evidence. Alice (Milla Jovovich) and various people are scattered in the city trying to survive. Meanwhile Dr. Ashford who has escaped is guiding them to rescue his daughter who is still trapped in the city.This has the unenviable position of opening up the scale of the franchise without the needed support. The virus has spread out into the open. This movie is city wide, but the CGI has barely improved. It needs mass zombie armies, and that means lots of CGI. Instead, they're relying a lot on real stunts and real people. Director Alexander Witt just doesn't have the skills or the people to make it work.The other problem is that the characters are widely scattered. It would be more compelling to gather them together. It would be a more simple action-horror, and it would be a better quest movie."
Mulholland Drive,6,1,4,19 July 2016," maddening surreal tale
","Betty Elms (Naomi Watts) is a naive Canadian aspiring actress who arrives in L.A. to stay at her aunt Ruth's Hollywood home while she's away filming in Vancouver. She finds a dark-haired beauty in the shower. She (Laura Elena Harring) has amnesia after a car crash on Mulholland Drive and takes on the name Rita. There's a diner called Winkies. There's director Adam Kesher (Justin Theroux). There's a hit man (Mark Pellegrino) who has a hit that keeps going wrong. Rita remembers the name Diane Selwyn and Betty joins her to find the dead woman.This film is maddening. David Lynch has created a confusing surreal tale. I'm sure someone has dissected this to make sense of everything. I can't tie the whole movie down. The pairing of Watts and Harring is great. Watts is especially terrific. If this comes with explanations, I may just like this more."
Dumb and Dumber,9,0,2,26 October 2013," Funny & Funnier
","Harry Dunne (Jeff Daniels) is a dog groomer. Lloyd Christmas (Jim Carrey) is a limo driver. It's questionable who is dumb and who is dumber. Let's just say that both are world class competitors in the event. Lloyd falls heavily for Mary Swanson (Lauren Holly). He picks up her suitcase and travels cross country to return it. Little does he know that she left it deliberately for a couple of kidnappers as ransom.This is the Farrelly brothers' first and possibly best hit. Over the years, I have seen this movie many times and every time I have gut busting laughs. The gags work no matter how many times you see it. Jim Carrey is at his hilarious best. And Jeff Daniels is surprising nimble with this outlandish material. The best part is their chemistry together. They have that playful friendship that allows the viewers to laugh at the ridiculousness."
Grave of the Fireflies,8,1,2,9 May 2014," Heart breaking animation
","This animated movie starts with young boy Seita dying on the floor of a train station after Japan surrenders in WWII. His spirit leads the audience to his story with his little sister Setsuko. During an air raid on their home town, they lose their mother. Their father is away with the Navy. The siblings go to live with their unsympathetic aunt. Seita clash with her, and the siblings go live by themselves in the bomb shelter next to the waters. It doesn't go well as their lives deteriorate to the point where Seita dies alone on the floor.It is the saddest of tragedy. The animation is the perfect foil to the subject matter. The animation style is children's story but the movie is all too realistic. The characters are not cartoons. It is ripped from the pages of history. The children animation style draws the audience in, and it hits the viewer in the heart."
The Boy in the Striped Pajamas,6,0,2,5 November 2016," flawed fable
","Bruno (Asa Butterfield) is a young boy living in wartime Germany. He is innocent of the world around him. His father Ralf (David Thewlis) gets promoted as the commander of a concentration camp. With mother Elsa (Vera Farmiga) and older sister Gretel (Amber Beattie), they move into a house off site from the camp. Bruno wonders why the farm workers are dressed in striped pyjamas. The kids get a tutor who teaches them propaganda. Their driver Lieutenant Kurt Kotler is a dedicated Nazi. Bruno sneaks out of the house and ends up at an isolated part of the camp's outer fence. He befriends Shmuel who is a boy prisoner inside the camp and visits him time after time. Their friendship grows as Bruno tries to understand the incomprehensible.This is really a fable rather than a historical reenactment. The point of the kids not understanding the situation is compelling at times but at other times seem silly. It may be better for Bruno to say less. Sometimes, his misunderstanding is poignant. The fact that he thought Shmuel was angry at him embodies both. The important subject requires more careful writing."
Star Wars: Episode VIII - The Last Jedi,8,19,76,19 December 2017," the most dangerous Star Wars
","The Republic has fallen and The First Order under Snoke (Andy Serkis) is taking over. The Resistance led by Princess Leia Organa (Carrie Fisher) is on the run once more. Rey (Daisy Ridley) seeks guidance from Luke Skywalker (Mark Hamill). Kylo Ren (Adam Driver) is conflicted about his dark side. Finn (John Boyega), Poe Dameron (Oscar Isaac), and new character Rose (Kelly Marie Tran) try a last ditch effort to save the Resistance.I am left with a lot of nitpicks that don't add up to much and one big observation. This could be the most dangerous Star Wars. First, let's start with some of the nitpicks. There is a lot of humor in this movie. I appreciate it sometimes but there are some serious issues being pushed in this movie and the humor at times clashes. There is some melodrama and sometimes the scenes push too hard. For example, Rose's amulet gets a lot of screen time. It's interesting what happens with Benicio del Toro but sometimes the movie does not need to linger on that pendent. The little kids forced to work the stables can be too much. I'm sure Rian Johnson got the idea from kids being forced to ride racing camels. It would be helpful to have more than just kids in indentured servitude. It becomes too obvious in a bad way. The kamikaze run is cool but the question becomes why they didn't do that with the other ships or in the other movies. The casino idea of the 1% weapon dealers is intriguing but there is too much broad Vegas motif. The Porgs are the Porgs and I'm resigned to the Christmas gifting motive. I either understand or reluctantly accept each one and more of these little annoyances.The overarching observation I have is a lot more uncertain. Rian Johnson is playing with the Star Wars sensibilities and its ultimate outcome is very much in doubt. It makes this a most dangerous Star Wars movie. The central idea of good versus evil is under attack. Benicio del Toro plays a criminal who talks a bit of truth to the audience. He essentially equates both sides. As long as there is war, the weapons dealers win and the people lose. Ghost Yoda literally burns down the Jedi religion. Skywalker's one moment of failure is also a direct shot at his character. Johnson is given new emperor Snoke and he promptly kills him off. Rei's parentage is given as nobodies. The question becomes whether that is the truth. I get the sense that Johnson intends it to be the truth and thereby cutting that branch away from the desperate needs of a Skywalker saga. Time and time again, he is pushing the Star Wars franchise in an intriguing and possibly dangerous direction. Stay tune to see whether it falls apart or succeeds as a new direction that The Force Awakens was never meant to be."
Brave,8,2,5,1 September 2013," Pixar does it again
","Merida (Kelly Macdonald) is a tomboy princess in ancient Scotland. She is the best archer, but she is being forced to act proper as a princess. One day, she makes a reckless choice that unleashes unintended peril and forces her to spring into action to set things right. Other voiceworks include Billy Connolly and Emma Thompson as the king and queen.There has been some complaints about Kelly Macdonald's performance using a deliberately high voice. I don't agree with those complaints. First she is playing a child. Second it's a cartoon. I don't understand the difference between this and the vast history of cartoon voices. The story is mostly the new princess formula. There's nothing wrong with that either."
Guardians of the Galaxy,8,1,4,30 June 2015," a galaxy full of fun
","On Earth 1988, Peter Quill loses his mother and is taken by a spaceship. Twenty Six years later, Peter (Chris Pratt) is caught trying to steal an orb but he manages to escape Korath. The Krees have signed a peace treaty with Nova Prime which is opposed by Ronan the Accuser (Lee Pace). Ronan needs the orb to satisfy Thanos who promises to destroy Xandar. Gamora (Zoe Saldana) goes to track down Peter and the orb. Also trying to capture Peter are Rocket and Groot. All four are imprisoned in the Kyln. They escape with the overly literal Drax who has a vendetta against Ronan.This is a rip-roaring fun space opera. Chris Pratt is at the top of his game. This is a bright, wild, crazy ride. There is a lot of Marvel lore to go through for the uninitiated. That's probably my main concern about this movie. The 70s soundtrack is a terrific touch and the humor is infectious."
Evil Dead,6,0,3,18 August 2013," remake starts well
","Friends Mia (Jane Levy), David (Shiloh Fernandez), Eric (Lou Taylor Pucci), Olivia (Jessica Lucas), and Natalie (Elizabeth Blackmore) go to an isolated cabin. Mia is an addict trying to quit cold turkey. They find the Book of the Dead and all hell breaks loose.Fede Alvarez wrote/directed this remake of Sam Raimi's The Evil Dead (1981). The movie starts off well. I wish he developed the addiction story a lot more. There is some allusion to a bigger commentary on drug rehabilitation. The action is good fun classic horror moments. It's got great classic camera movements. Everything is going well.About midway, Jane Levy's character is sidelined. Shiloh Fernandez takes more center stage. Sadly, he's just a functional Latino hunk. He can't hold the screen as well as Bruce Campbell. The more interesting character is the nerdy sidekick played by Lou Taylor Pucci. Then the 3rd act gets going, and it devolves more and more into a slasher-porn movie. It's all screams, darkness, blood splashing. Even the return of Jane Levy can't save it. It ends as an exercise to see how much red paint they can splatter. This started with so much promise, but satisfied very little of it. We get none of the humor. We do get the return of the chainsaw. But Bruce Campbell saying 'Groovy' after the credits really doesn't do it for me."
The Imitation Game,8,3,4,17 October 2015," functional historical drama lands a couple of solid punches
","As the war starts, mathmatician professor Alan Turing (Benedict Cumberbatch) arrives at Bletchley Park under the militarist Commander Denniston (Charles Dance) to break the German Enigma code. He is joined by math student Joan Clarke (Keira Knightley) and chess genius Hugh Alexander (Matthew Goode). Stewart Menzies (Mark Strong) is from the secret MI6. The movie also takes place in 1927 with Alan as a student and Christopher Morcom as his only friend and love. In 1951, police detective Robert Nock (Rory Kinnear) investigates Alan for being a Soviet spy but discovers that he's only guilty of homosexuality.The first half of the movie is a rather traditional historical drama. Cumberbatch is impeccable. Knightley is too much of a starlet. Of course, Denniston is a military blowhard. Turing's homosexuality is limited. It all has the feel of a sanitized docudrama. Then the movie starts landing some solid punches. I love the Hugh Alexander character. Alan and Christopher's relationship is pretty compelling. There is nothing physical but they do use the word love. Menzies is another great character. Alan's confession to detective Nock is riveting and poignant. It's missing his suicide scene. This vehicle started out functional with a couple of squeaky wheels and then it makes a few great turns."
Caddyshack,8,1,3,12 June 2014," Great master class of comedic legends, younger cast not so much
",Danny Noonan is putting everything he makes into his college fund even though he's not sure what he wants to do. He's a caddy at an exclusive Bushwood country club. The club is filled with wealthy eccentric members and an unbalanced greens keeper Carl Spackler (Bill Murray) out to get the gopher.The comedic power assembled in this is amazing. Harold Ramis made a pretty loose comedy. There're a lot of improvisations. Bill Murray really steals many scenes with all his ramblings and his gopher partner. Rodney Dangerfield and Ted Knight face off in a master class of comedy. Chevy Chase is playing the guy above it all. The weakness in the movie is the younger cast. They can't quite keep up and they pale in comparison. The movie works best with the elder statesmen Dangerfield and Ted Knight squaring off.
The Evil Dead,7,1,6,3 January 2014," Raimi has some fun
","Five friends go to a cabin in the woods, and find the Book of the Dead in the cellar. Along with the Book, they find a tape recorder with a professor reciting the Book. It brings unspeakable evil from the forest, corruption in their wounds, and evil possessions in the friends.Director Sam Raimi is having some horror fun in this one of his earliest films. No expense is spared in splashing as much fake blood as possible... for a low budget movie. There are some good moves, but the plot is fairly minimal. There are two interesting things introduced. The first is the Book bound with skin. It's a good looking prop. The second is the tree rape scene. That has to be the most memorable scene from this movie. Also it introduces Bruce Campbell and then there is the copious amount of fake blood. The cleanup must have been insane."
8 Mile,8,1,2,4 October 2014," The perfect movie for Eminem
","Jimmy 'B-Rabbit' Smith (Eminem) is desperate to be a rapper. It's 1995 Detroit. With the support of his friend David 'Future' Porter (Mekhi Phifer), he aims to overcome his personal problems. His mother Stephanie (Kim Basinger) is a drunk. He leaves his girlfriend Janeane (Taryn Manning) when she tells him that she's pregnant. He chokes on a head-to-head rap battle. He has no place to go but to move back into his mother's trailer. His mom's boyfriend Greg (Michael Shannon) is a jerk. He has a part-time grimy auto parts job and then he meets Alex (Brittany Murphy).Eminem is basically playing himself and he does a good job. He's surrounded by good actors. The sense of the place is the standout of this movie. The Detroit locations have the proper grittiness. The desperation is palpable. The rap battles are exhilarating. The story is relatively standard with nice touches. This is a matter of the perfect story for the perfect lead. He's not really acting as much as being himself."
The Piano,8,1,4,16 December 2014," beautiful melodrama
","Ada McGrath (Holly Hunter) has been mute since she was 6 without a reason. She and her young daughter Flora (Anna Paquin) are brought over to New Zealand to marry Alisdair Stewart (Sam Neill). She communicates with Flora with sign language. Her piano is her prize possession and her voice. However Alisdair deems it too heavy to carry and leaves it on the beach. Then Alisdair sells the piano to his illiterate neighbor George Baines (Harvey Keitel). George proposes to sell it back to her with one visit for every piano key and she counters with just the black keys.This is romance novel melodrama from director Jane Campion and it is epic. Everything works including the epic landscape. The pounding waves, the lush forest and the isolation becomes part of the story. It is filmed beautifully. The performances are great. Anna Paquin is precocious. Holly Hunter and Harvey Keitel are not the natural romantic pair but there is something touching about that."
Shrek 2,8,0,1,29 March 2014," Nice fitting sequel
","After Shrek (Mike Myers) marries Princess Fiona (Cameron Diaz) in the first movie. Donkey (Eddie Murphy) has been watching the hovel while they're on their honeymoon. Then they get a summons from Fiona's parents (Julie Andrews, John Cleese) in Far, Far Away. The trio goes to Fiona's home to find an uneasy acceptance of what has happened. Prince Charming (Rupert Everett) returns after not finding Fiona in the tower. He and his mother Fairy Godmother (Jennifer Saunders) try to split Shrek away from Fiona. They threaten the King who in turn hires Puss In Boots (Antonio Banderas) to kill Shrek.There are some great additions to the cast of characters in the Shrek world. The main trio's chemistry is maintained while Puss form a new trio with Shrek and Donkey. It is just as good as the first one. It takes the situation and spins it into a family drama. The main idea of acceptance is expanded as the parents try to accept the Ogre into the family. It's a perfectly fitting sequel after the happily ever after."
Kill Bill: Vol. 1,7,2,7,27 April 2014," Nice spin on exploitation genre
","The Bride (Uma Thurman) awakens after 4 years in a coma. It was her wedding day and she was pregnant. She was attacked and now she has no child. She's after vengeance on her attackers. She kills Vernita Green (Vivica A. Fox) who has since become a suburban housewife. Then we see she has already crossed out O-Ren Ishii (Lucy Liu). Then it flashes back to the wedding and when one-eyed Elle Driver (Daryl Hannah) tried to kill her in the hospital. She's saved at the last minute by a call from Bill (David Carradine). The last member of the deadly viper assassination squad is Budd (Michael Madsen).Quentin Tarantino has created a simple action revenge movie reminiscent of the old exploitation kung fu Hong Kong action movies. This is an outrageously simplistic story that is highlighted by some great action scenes. It's a nice spin on the exploitation genre, but I don't know if it's necessary to have a two-parter. It's the only minor complaint I have about this. The story is way too simple to justify the extended running time. There are sections where Tarantino has stretched the movie a little too far. He tries his best to juice it up with some temporal juggling, mixed media, and eastern philosophy. But essentially this is an excuse to exercise some action filmmaking fetish. And it's beautiful when the action is so well done like the battle with O-Ren Ishii."
Saw II,5,0,0,13 October 2016," some more interesting than others
","Michael Marks is a prisoner of Jigsaw. He fails to dig into his own eye socket to find the key and the head trap closes killing him. Police detective Eric Matthews (Donnie Wahlberg) has rebellious estranged son Daniel who lives with his mother. Eric and Detective Allison Kerry (Dina Meyer) investigate another strange Jigsaw murder. They and the SWAT team track down John Kramer (Tobin Bell) at a booby-trapped warehouse. Kramer shows them a monitor with previous survivor Amanda Young (Shawnee Smith) and Daniel among others in a room at an unknown location where they are threatened with death by lethal gas. The group has to search for the hidden antidotes.The most appealing aspect of the original is the simplicity of two men locked in a room. There are plenty of asides but it is essentially about the two men. I miss that simplicity. Instead of a whole SWAT team, it would be more compelling to have only Eric finding John Kramer. They could face off directly mano-a-mano. There are some memorable kills but the movie does tilt over to campiness with the elaborate setups."
Ip Man,7,1,1,13 July 2016," Donnie Yen great dignity
","In FoShan, southern China, Master Liu challenges Ip Man (Donnie Yen) and gets beaten. Ip Man promises to keep it private but loudmouthed Yuan tells everyone. Jin from the north challenges every master in FoShan. He wins in every match except for Ip Man. In 1937, war starts between Japan and China. Ip Man loses everything. Japanese General Miura has organized fight tournaments. Yuan's older brother Lin is killed. Ip Man fights to avenge his death. Meanwhile, Jin leads his bandits including Yuan. They steal from Ip Man's friend Zhou Qingquan.The start is well-done kung fu movie and a good solid story. Donnie Yen has great dignity. The movie is essentially extended into two parts. The war scrambles everybody and everything. The second part is also good. It introduces whole new villains. I would have preferred having two separate movies. The fight action is fun, and energetic. This is a solid kung fu action movie."
From Dusk Till Dawn,8,5,7,6 October 2013," Rodriguez-Tarantino make a great team
","Director Robert Rodriguez and writer Quentin Tarantino make a great team. This marries the splatter fun of Rodriaguez with the delicious dialog from Tarantino.Seth (George Clooney) and Richard (Quentin Tarantino) are bank robbers. Richard is a little insane and breaks Seth out of court. They take the Fuller family (Harvey Keitel, Juliette Lewis, Ernest Liu) hostage. Once in Mexico, they stop at the wild bar Titty Twister to wait for Carlos expected before dawn. Just when things couldn't get any crazier, Salma Hayek starts dancing.This is a well made simple gore fest. It doesn't let up until they reach sunlight. It's a film where Rodriguez has thrown everything into it. Tarantino actually works well as manic maniac. It's kind of his thing. Clooney brings his superiority to his character. He does need to be more menacing. That's probably the only minor complaint I have. Clooney seems out of place at times."
The Last Emperor,8,1,1,11 April 2015," old fashion epic
","Pu Yi (John Lone) is the last Emperor of China. The movie flashes back and forth from as a post-war prisoner to his life leading up to that moment. In 1908, he is taken from his home and transferred to the Hidden City. When the Dowager dies, he becomes the emperor. He's separated from his mother for years and his younger brother Pu Chieh comes to stay with him. He becomes obsolete as a child emperor when the country turns into a Republic. R.J. Johnston (Peter O'Toole) is his English tutor and mentor. Pu Yi is locked in even when his mother dies. He has an arranged marriage to Wan Jung (Joan Chen) and Wenxiu. In 1924, he is expelled from the Forbidden City. He lived in luxury with his entourage. Wenxiu gets her divorce. Japanese agent Eastern Jewel entices Wan Jung with opium while Pu Yi is pulled ever closer to Japan. He is eventually installed as the emperor of Manchukuo, a puppet state of Japan.It's a grand epic historical drama. John Lone delivers a stone-faced performance. It has a certain appeal and makes the emperor more of a victim of history. It's a specific take on the character which some may object to. It's actually quite compelling. The picture looks beautiful. A lot of it has to do with the fact that the film goes inside the Forbidden City. I wouldn't say it deserves all of the Oscars but it definitely deserves to win a few of them."
Jerry Maguire,7,1,1,9 November 2013," Cameron Crowe does it again
","Jerry Maguire (Tom Cruise) is a top sports agent. Only lately, he's noticing something morally wrong in his world. In the dead of night, he types up his 'mission statement' punctuated by 'Fewer clients. Less money.' He distributes it to his officemates, and it eventually blows up in his face. (Love the synchronicity of the old Mission Impossible footage) It has great iconic lines and breakout performances from Renée Zellweger and Cuba Gooding Jr. Tom Cruise is perfect for the self involved agent who comes to a life changing reckoning. Cameron Crowe delivers the lines and the actors deliver the performances. It's a great under-the-radar rom-com. Only it's more a rom-com between Tom Cruise and Cuba Gooding Jr. than Tom Cruise and Renée Zellweger."
Here Comes the Boom,6,1,3,26 August 2013," I like Kevin James, just can't get over the ridiculousness
","Scott Voss (Kevin James) is a disillusioned biology teacher. His school is failing, and he's just going thru the motions. His friend Marty Streb (Henry Winkler) is the music teacher. One day, the principal cuts the music program and it's up to Scott to save it by fighting MMA. Bella Flores (Salma Hayek) is the hot school nurse.No matter how I try, it's impossible to believe that Kevin James is a passable MMA fighter. It just hangs over the entire movie. To their credit, they did let him lose a lot. He's not just some over night success. There's a couple of fun moments. How could they not be? A fat guy rolling around doing slapstick fighting, that's priceless."
The Big Blue,5,1,3,29 April 2016," not sure
","In 1965 Greece, Jacques Mayol and Enzo Molinari are childhood rivals in freediving. Jacques loses his father in a diving accident. In 1988 Sicily, Enzo (Jean Reno) is an arrogant diver for hire with Roberto. He wants to challenge Jacques. In Peru, insurance adjuster Johana Baker (Rosanna Arquette) visits Dr. Laurence's icy research station after an incident and falls for diver Jacques (Jean-Marc Barr). She lies to her boss Duffy (Griffin Dunne) to follow Jacques in his reunion with Enzo at the World Championship of Freediving in Sicily.I'm not sure which version I saw. I don't like the flighty Johana. I would preferred concentrating on the relationship between Jacques and Enzo. Anyways, why can't she simply be a tourist in Sicily. Her slightly off-center sensibility seems wrong. I don't like the insurance side trip and chasing a man she barely knows halfway around the globe by lying and stealing from the company. Sometimes, Luc Besson has that off-center sense of humor which usually works well with his energetic action style. This is far from an action movie. The underwater diving adds a zen quality. Jean Reno is great as usual. Jean-Marc Barr was a newbie by comparison at the time. He's a little stiff. I don't think this movie works (at least not the version I saw)."
Clash of the Titans,6,0,1,15 September 2013," Sam Worthington stiff, lot of CG
","The Gods demand the sacrifice of Princess Andromeda (Alexa Davalos) or they will unleash the Kraken against the city of Argos. Perseus (Sam Worthington), demigod son of Zeus, accepts the task to fight the Kraken. To fight the Kraken, he discovers that he needs the head of Medusa.They got some big names to play gods including Liam Neeson, and Ralph Fiennes. Gemma Arterton plays Io who guide the quest. This is chalk full of CG battles. The biggest problem with that is the rush to put it in 3D. Many complaints follow, but if you watch it in 2D, there shouldn't be any problems. The acting is basically stiff. Sam Worthington is not a natural acting, but he has the built to be heroic. It does get too chaotic, but it's pretty watchable."
Jurassic World,6,28,70,19 August 2015," bad comedy but fun dinosaur action
",Karen Mitchell sends her sons Gray and Zach to Jurassic World in Isla Nublar which is run by her sister Claire Dearing (Bryce Dallas Howard). Owen Grady (Chris Pratt) is a velociraptor trainer. Vic Hoskins (Vincent D'Onofrio) wants to turn them into military weapons. The park is creating genetic amalgamations. The latest is the most dangerous of them all. Then it escapes and chaos ensues.It's funny that Claire's heels became such a big complaint. The movie obviously knows it's a joke so pointing it out is a little beside the point. The biggest problem is that Claire isn't funny and I don't blame it all on BDH. The character is written badly and so is Owen. Almost every attempt at comedy ends with me groaning at its clumsiness. Claire and Owen have almost no chemistry. I hated them kissing in the middle of pterosaurs attack. It's just ridiculous. It's one of those clichÃ© moves that needs to be outlawed. Stop kissing and shoot some pterosaurs. The movie still works because it has giant dinosaurs and it's a fun adventure.
Paranormal Activity,4,1,3,28 March 2014," Never bought into the gimmick
","Katie (Katie Featherston) and Micah (Micah Sloat) are a young couple who just moved into their new suburban house only to find that strange things keep happening. They bring in a psychic and set up security cameras.It's a haunted house horror with a good dose of 'Blair Witch' realism. This movie is about the advertising campaign more than the movie. If the audience actually believe in its realism, then this would be a great viewing experience. The fact is that I never believed, and the 'real' found footage is not compelling for me. The acting is amateurish. The camera work is flat and boring. There is never any real/unreal tension for me. Strip that away. There isn't much of a scary story that hasn't been done zillions of times before and done better."
Charlie and the Chocolate Factory,6,2,4,26 December 2013," Tim Burton takes on Willy Wonka & the Chocolate Factory
","Who knows why a great artist want to take on such an iconic unique movie? Maybe he wants the challenge. It starts with a dark depressing vision of Charlie Bucket's (Freddie Highmore) poverty. He finds one of five Golden ticket to visit Willy Wonka's (Johnny Depp) chocolate factory. The movie spends too much time in the Bucket home, and takes too long to get to the chocolate factory. Most of the audience already know what's going to happen. The Bucket home should be nothing more than an intro, but it goes on for more than 30 minutes before we take one step into the factory.Once we get Johnny Depp on screen, the movie gets moving better. I love the Tim Burton vision at his weirdest. Freddie Highmore is certainly a very capable young actor. Johnny Depp adds his own sort of weirdness. I love his weird take on Willy Wonka. On the other hand, I'm not sure about the Oompa Loompas. Mainly, I'm not sure about using the same actor for all Oompa Loompas. I do admit that it makes them even weirder. I would have given this a 7/10, but I have to subtract 1 for the slow start without Johnny Depp."
Mission: Impossible II,5,1,2,5 June 2014," Lost the excitement of the first one
","A scientist at Biocyte Pharmaceuticals has created a dangerous genetically modified disease called Chimera. A person infected for 20 hours with Chimera cannot be saved, not even with the cure Bellerophon. IMF agent Ethan Hunt (Tom Cruise) is tasked with bringing back the disease and cure but he's not the only one after it. Agent Sean Ambrose (Dougray Scott) posed as Ethan and managed to steal it from the scientist. Ethan has to recruit his ex Nyah Nordoff-Hall (Thandie Newton) who is a civilian and a thief. It turns out that Nyah and Sean had a relationship and Sean wants her back. Luther Stickell (Ving Rhames) is back as the third member of the team.It opens with a great shot of Tom Cruise climbing a rock face. Then it pretty much slowly goes downhill from there. Tom Cruise and Thandie Newton have reasonable chemistry. The problem is that director John Woo takes a long time to get going. It spends so much unnecessary time with the couple and then explaining the story. There is the usual John Woo action touches. It's just way too slow. Thandie has so little energy in her performance and John Woo doesn't have enough big meaningful action scenes. There is still some good action going on especially that bike chase. The first movie was wildly exciting even if it was confusing. This one just lost all the energy of the first one. Also Australia doesn't really count as exotic. It is just generally a step back."
The Adjustment Bureau,7,1,2,23 September 2013," Great idea just not dramatic enough
","Ambitious politician David Norris (Matt Damon) meets beautiful ballet dancer Elise Sellas (Emily Blunt). It's love at first sight. But something keeps them apart. When he accidentally meets her years later, he's introduced to The Adjustment Bureau.This is certainly a great Philip K Dick concept, and the men have a great look to them. Matt Damon and Emily Blunt are great actors, and they have some chemistry together. All the elements seems to be there for a great movie. But the story has too many slow spots. And while it's fun to run around opening doors to crazy new locations, it does get very repetitive. The ending just lacks the needed amazing big drama."
World Trade Center,6,0,1,31 May 2016," straight telling of smaller 9/11 story
","It's a normal New York morning on September 11, 2001. When a plane flies into Tower One, Sgt John McLoughlin (Nicolas Cage) leads a group of Port Authority cops. There are conflicting reports on Tower Two. As they prepare to go up to Tower One, Tower Two collapse around them. Will Jimeno (Michael Peña), Dominick Pezzulo (Jay Hernandez), and McLoughlin manage to escape into the elevator shaft.It's got some compelling iconic 9/11 moments although Oliver Stone doesn't actually show the planes crashing into the buildings. He's staying mainly close to these characters. He does a straight telling. He's not doing anything too risky. It is a bit long and the tension doesn't stay high. Maybe Stone is scared to short-change anybody and that would be understandable. There are small sections of high tension but it doesn't last the whole movie."
Cold War,7,0,1,1 July 2019," brutal beauty
","It's 1949 Poland. Wiktor is auditioning for performers in a folk music trope. He argues for beautiful blonde peasant Zula and they fall madly in love. She would become a star as the trope tours around the communist block. The two star-crossed lovers struggle through the Cold War.The black and white photography is beautiful. The performances are great. The disjointed way of story telling is a little problematic with the subtitles. It can feel a bit rushed as the movie jumps in years. The emotions are not lost but I could spend more time with this melodrama. I almost miss bit of the story as the telling jumps around. It's the style of the movie. The brutal melodrama is matched by the abrupt style. Overall, this harsh world is very interesting."
Black Snake Moan,8,0,1,16 September 2015," potent mix of sex, blues & the bible
","In rural Mississippi, Lazarus (Samuel L. Jackson) is a fire and brimstone blues musician farmer. He's full of rage especially after his younger wife leaves him for his brother. Rae (Christina Ricci) is a wild sex addict who is struggling after her boyfriend Ronnie (Justin Timberlake) leaves for the military. She gets trashed at a party and left on the side of the road. Lazarus finds her bloodied unconscious body and tries to treat her. He finds that she's got the Sickness and chains her to the radiator to keep her from running away.Some take offense to the perceived misogyny and the sexual content. I don't dispute other's perceptions. Everybody is entitled to their own. The movie can definitely be seen through that light. It's actually kind of funny with a potent mix of southern style, sex and religion. The two actors are dynamos powering a very charged movie."
Black Hawk Down,8,1,4,4 October 2013," True Shock and Awe
","Based on the real events of the disastrous Somalia raid on October 3, 1993 where US Army Rangers attempts to capture Somali warlords. This mission was going well until the first Black Hawk helicopter got hit by a rocket and crashed. The Rangers would end up fighting their way to safety.Ridley Scott has given a ultra realism to the movie. This is truly Shock and Awe movie-making. The action starts relatively early and doesn't let up. The impressive cast really delivers. There isn't any glaring deficiency. The only part missing is the Somali side of the story. This is not that kind of a movie. What you get is a Band of Brothers story."
The Hangover Part II,7,0,0,5 September 2013," Gang is back, crazier than the first
","The gang is back. This time Stu is getting married to Lauren in Thailand. After a quiet night, Stu, Alan and Phil wake up in a seedy apartment in Bangkok. Doug is back at the resort, but Lauren's brother Teddy is missing. There's a monkey with a severed finger, Alan's head is shaved, Stu has a tattoo on his face, and they can't remember any of it. And Mr Chow is back.This is just like the first one, except this one is crazier and in Bankok. Everything is bigger. Alan is crazier. Mr Chow is more ridiculous. The humor is cruder. It's essentially repeating the same story and some dismiss it for that. I personally don't."
A Bug's Life,8,0,0,1 December 2014," Fun charming family movie
","Flik (Dave Foley) is an ant and a bumbling inventor. The colony is led by Princess Atta (Julia Louis-Dreyfus) and the Queen. They work to provide tribute to a gang of marauding grasshoppers led by Hopper (Kevin Spacey). However Flik loses the year's tribute and the grasshoppers vows to come back for their food. Flik has an idea to recruit warrior bugs from the city to fight the grasshoppers. The other ants are happy to get rid of Flik and sends him off on the suicide mission. In the city, he recruits a group of circus bugs who mistakes Flik for a talent agent.This is a good follow up to Pixar's breakout movie Toy Story. This is fun. The animation looks good and bright. The story has a funny charm to it. The circus bugs are a lovable lot. This is a great children's movie with enough to entertain the adults as well."
Rudy,9,1,2,16 November 2013," emotional
","This is a 10 hankie movie. Every part of the movie is made to make you cry. If you look for underdog in the dictionary, you'll see the face of Rudy. Sure the movie is manipulating us. For that I'll subtract a point. But it's something I'll mostly overlook because the manipulations work so well. The fact is Rudy has become bigger than a simple movie. It is the standard for underdog sports movies. It has become a synonym to inspirational.Daniel 'Rudy' Ruettiger (Sean Astin) is a poor student and a small physical specimen. Only he has the heart of a lion. He dreams of nothing else other than to play for Notre Dame football. Nobody believes in him other than maybe his best friend Pete. His father's (Ned Beatty) tale of how his grandfather abandoned his family for a dream is heartbreaking. The father's advise is gut wrenching. His fire is almost extinguished when Pete dies in an industrial accident. This drives him to pursue his dreams which borders on delusional.The story piles on the obstacles facing Rudy. It is overkill and works beautifully. It is heartbreaking every time it happens. The music pulls at the emotional strings. They pile on more obstacles. Even though I know there are manipulations, it doesn't matter. It gets me every time."
Prisoners,8,1,1,5 December 2013," good intense
","Detective Loki (Jake Gyllenhaal) is searching for a child serial killer, and catches Alex Jones (Paul Dano) in an old RV. Meanwhile, Keller Dover (Hugh Jackman) and Franklin Birch (Terrence Howard) lose their daughters during a gathering. Loki has to let Jones loose, but Dover is not letting him go.Paul Dano always does a great creep. Jake Gyllenhaal does a capable cop, but I think he overacts sometimes. The interrogation room scene comes out of nowhere. I think that was a mistake. The big acting comes from Hugh Jackman. He's the key to this movie. It's possibly his best performance. He is intense without being melodramatic. What Keller Dover does in the movie is absolutely fascinating, and morally dangerous. I do wish the film go full out on that route. The film does let him escape morally a little too easily.Director Denis Villeneuve is a skilled Quebec filmmaker. He has fashioned a tight intense thriller. However, it resolves too neatly. It's a dirty dark movie. I'd prefer an ugly dark ending. Although I'm not going deduct any points for that."
Silence,7,2,2,10 November 2017," harrowing first half
","In 17th century Japan, Christians are persecuted. Jesuit priests from Portugal and their Japanese peasant converts are being massacred. Word arrives that senior priest Ferreira (Liam Neeson) had renounced his faith. His proteges Rodrigues (Andrew Garfield) and Garupe (Adam Driver) are in disbelief. They travel to Japan guided by refugee Kichijiro who claims to be Christian. They find small communities of fearful Christians trying to hide their faith from ruthless inquisitor governor Inoue Masashige and cunning interpreter Mokichi.Martin Scorsese doesn't know how to film a bad looking scene. The first half is harrowing and on its way to being one of the best films of the year. The midway point has Rodrigues and Garupe disagreeing about trampling a religious icon. That argument needs to be aired out and expanded. Scorsese should have let them stake out their positions. It would clarify Rodrigues' starting point and allow his journey to be more compelling. It's just odd that he seems to appreciate the deadly danger at that point but naively shocked at the actual violence done to the people after that. I expected him to be smarter or at least, not be the doe-eyed innocent shocked at everything. His emotional journey should be less melodramatic so that Ferreira's reveal could be much more shocking. With a minor alteration, the journey would have worked much better."
For Love of the Game,6,0,1,18 October 2014," baseball sentimentalism works better than romantic drama
",Billy Chapel (Kevin Costner) is a worn-out 40 year old former ace pitcher for The Detroit Tigers. He's given the start of last game of a disastrous season against the Yankees in NYC. The Yankees are looking to clinch the East with a win. Tigers' owner Gary Wheeler (Brian Cox) has just sold the team and the new owners want to trade Billy to the Giants. His best friend is his catcher Gus Sinski (John C. Reilly). His girlfriend Jane Aubrey (Kelly Preston) tells him that she is taking a job in London. He has the best game in awhile pitching a perfect game. The movie flashes back and forth from the present to his life courting Jane and reconnecting with his daughter Heather (Jena Malone).The movie tries so hard with every baseball cliché. It doesn't add anything original that other Costner movies and The Natural doesn't already have put out. Every pitch is striving for sentimentality. The baseball stuff builds to a pretty compelling ninth inning. That's kind of what happens in a real baseball game. The bigger problem is that the romance is as bland as it gets. The romance lacks any bite or surprises. It's the least compelling thing in the movie. At least the baseball stuff works a little even if it is cliché.
Logan,8,5,10,5 July 2017," bloody hardness
","It's 2029. Mutants in America have been hunted to almost extinction. Logan (Hugh Jackman) is a dying drunk and driving a limo. He is caring for Charles Xavier (Patrick Stewart) who is losing control of his powers and his sanity. Logan is approached by Gabriela for help to care for a little girl named Laura. They're on the run from a corporation which created Laura and other mutant children to be super-soldiers. Its thugs are looking to recapture the escaped subjects.The movie is hard and bloody. It mines the well-worn relationship between Logan and Professor X bringing a feral little girl into the mix. The connection is ingrained. It takes the superhero joy of violence and makes it brutal. I would have liked a little more jokey humor between odd couple Logan and X. Overall, it's good bloody brutal violence with a familiar relationship and some new ones."
Avengers: Age of Ultron,7,2,8,2 January 2016," like most of it but final battle gets a little boring
","The Avengers go to Sokovia to take on Strucker and Hydra to recover Loki's scepter. Strucker has been experimenting on twins Pietro and Wanda Maximoff. The twins have a score to settle with Tony Stark. Wanda warps Tony's mind. He uses the gem from the scepter to create Ultron, the ultimate shield for humanity. Instead, Ultron has evil plans that would devastate humanity. Wanda's mind-meddling forces the Avengers to regroup at Hawkeye's farm. Later, Wanda has visions of Ultron's plan and turns against him. Tony uses JARVIS to create another AI which results in Vision. Together, the new and old Avengers join to battle Ultron.Joss Whedon's jokey style commences right from the start. It would have been more exciting to start with a less jokey action sequence. I like most of the movie. I like the banter. Ultron could be given more time to develop his character. I actually like Hawkeye's farm. Thor's visions could be more compelling. I like Blackwidow and Hulk's relationship. I love the HulkBuster. I like almost everything but the final act doesn't have the excitement. The action gets a little boring. It's a lot of robotic fodder getting punched. It's a solid superhero movie but a step below the best."
Hedwig and the Angry Inch,7,0,1,3 September 2015," fascinating character
","Hedwig (John Cameron Mitchell) is a rock singer from East Germany. Yitzhak (Miriam Shor) is his suffering companion. Hedwig has become tabloid news as the the gay transsexual lover to rock star Tommy Gnosis (Michael Pitt). Hedwig has a lawsuit against Tommy as manager Phyllis Stein (Andrea Martin) has the band playing in unlikely places following Tommy's tour.Hedwig is a fascinating bitter character. Ultimately, his inch is too angry to be of much rooting interest. It's a terrific performance and I can imagine it would be an amazing live performance. I wanted more comedic moments. The directing style is limited with some animation work. This is set up for a cult classic."
Hotel Transylvania,7,1,3,8 August 2013," It's good but nothing too memorable
","Dracula (Adam Sandler) opens a hotel for only monsters serving as an oasis away from the humans. His daughter Mavis (Selena Gomez) has grown up in the hotel for 118 years not knowing any humans other than the unreal scary stories told by her father. She is still itching to go out and explore the human world. One day, human backpacker Jonathan (Andy Samberg) stumbles onto the hotel throwing Dracula's world upside down.It's good to see people other than Pixar doing good animation. This one has a good story to serve as a solid base. The monsters have real humanity. The ending is somewhat undramatic. The singalong number at the end flattens any climax it had. It's unlikely they created any breakthrought characters that could lead to a sequel but it's still a good movie."
Big Fish,6,2,3,3 December 2014," One crazy story after another
","Ed Bloom (Albert Finney) tells the same fish story throughout his son Will (Billy Crudup)'s life of catching a fish with his wedding ring. They stop talking to each other and they only connect through Will's mother Sandra (Jessica Lange). Ed is sick and Will goes home to see him. Will retells his father's stories. As a kid, Ed encounters the witch (Helena Bonham Carter). He (Ewan McGregor) is heroic as a teen and then he confronts a giant. He convinces Karl the giant to join him to leave town. He takes a detour and ends up in the hidden town of Spectre. Later, Ed meets Sandra (Alison Lohman) at the Calloway Circus.I like the weird Tim Burton style. The movie falls into a bit of a rut as one outlandish situation takes over from another. I need the stories to be connected more with the real part of the movie. It doesn't have the needed emotional impact. It's just one crazy wild adventure after another."
The Insider,8,1,1,14 February 2015," Crowe revelation
",Intrepid '60 Minutes' producer Lowell Bergman (Al Pacino) gets Mike Wallace (Christopher Plummer) an interview with Hezbollah. He wants to do a story about cigarettes accidentally setting fires and receives a stack of technical documents. He seeks out Dr. Jeffrey Wigand (Russell Crowe) to translate the jargon. Wigand just got fired from Brown & Williamson Tobacco Company. His daughter suffers and he needs the medical coverage in his severance package. The company is playing hardball with his confidentiality agreement. The pressure is overwhelming and from all sides.This is a terrific Michael Mann movie. The story doesn't have natural kinetic energy. However he creates such tension from the story. Al Pacino gives his usual power acting. Russell Crowe is a revelation as a haggard middle-aged family man. The subject matter could easily drown in white collar gobbergoob talk. However Mann makes it a great character study and an energized thriller.
Quiz Show,8,0,0,21 November 2014," Two great performances
",It's 1958. Twenty-one is one of the most popular TV quiz shows. Producers Dan Enright (David Paymer) and Albert Freedman (Hank Azaria) run the show. Herb Stempel (John Turturro) from Queens is the reigning champ. However the sponsor doesn't feel that Stempel is a good TV personality. Columbia University instructor Charles Van Doren (Ralph Fiennes) is fascinated with the show and tries out. Unscrupulous Enright and Freedman forces Stempel to lose on an easy question. Van Doren's TV success soon brings him out of the shadows of his renowned intellectual father. Stempel is frozen out and he goes to a grand jury. Richard Goodwin (Rob Morrow) is a congressional investigator who starts to investigate the game show.This movie is anchored by two amazing performances. John Turturro is at his jittery sweaty best. He provides the nervous energy while Ralph Fiennes gives the human fragility. It's a great character study of two fascinating personalities.
Major League,8,1,3,6 April 2014," Great group chemistry in lovable comedy
","Former exotic dancer Rachel Phelps (Margaret Whitton) is left as the new owner of the Cleveland Indians after the old owner died. She wants to move the team to Miami. The team has a lease with the city that has an escape clause if the attendance falls below 800,000. So she has gathered a team of the worst scrap heap players that she can find.It is so refreshing to have a real MLB team name. The team has such a brilliant chemistry. The standout is Charlie Sheen as Wild Thing, but everybody is an unique character. Dennis Haysbert is amazing as voodoo using Cuban Cerrano. Tom Berenger is the worn out veteran. Even Wesley Snipes is funny back then when he was actually good. The best word to describe this movie is fun."
Hotel Mumbai,8,5,24,28 June 2019," compelling telling
","It's November 26, 2008. Ten terrorists arrive from rural Pakistan to launch attack across Mumbai. Arjun (Dev Patel) is a waiter at the Taj Mahal Palace Hotel and Hemant Oberoi is the head chef. David (Armie Hammer) and Zahra (Nazanin Boniadi) are having diner in the hotel while their baby is in their room with their nanny Sally. Former Soviet special force Vasili (Jason Isaacs) is also a guest when the hotel is infiltrated by four attackers.Like Unite 93 and others like it, this brings the real life terrorist attack to the big screen. Arjun is the perfect compelling heroic character. It doesn't seem to take too much liberties with the true story. Of course, there are always some inconsistencies. It has a couple of moments of melodrama but it's mostly a straight forward telling. It is a harrowing account. There is tension which doesn't release until the end. It's a very compelling movie."
The Dark Knight,9,2,5,1 November 2013," Heath Ledger makes this great
","Batman takes on the crime lords with the help of Lieutenant Jim Gordon and District Attorney Harvey Dent. However an even bigger evil rises to terrorize Gotham.Maggie Gyllenhaal is an improvement over Katie Holmes as Rachel Dawes. Aaron Eckhart adds a good performance as Harvey Dent. In the end, this is Heath Ledger's movie. He overpowers everybody. His early death may have immortalized him, but my opinion isn't inflated. His presence is electric. It helps that his character is so ridiculously crazy. His motivation has nothing to do with power or money which is so mundane. He wants chaos and that is so much more fascinating. Heath Ledger makes this movie great. And it surpasses the series reboot 'Batman Begins'."
Everest,7,0,1,9 September 2016," compelling mountaineering
","More and more commercial expeditions are climbing Mount Everest. In the summer of 1996, Adventure Consultants is one of the many teams making the attempt. Rob Hall (Jason Clarke) is the veteran leader leaving behind his pregnant wife Jan (Keira Knightley) in New Zealand. Beck Weathers (Josh Brolin) and Doug Hansen (John Hawkes) are two of the client climbers. Guy Cotter (Sam Worthington) is an assistant and Helen Wilton (Emily Watson) coordinates from base camp. The group arrives at the summit late. Veteran climber Scott Fischer (Jake Gyllenhaal) had been climbing back and forth between camps. Doug convinces Rob to stay even later and then a storm hits the peak. They can't find any extra oxygen tanks. The group gets scattered and struggles to find safety.The story leading up to the summit lacks narrative drive. The first half simply has no tension and the characters don't have depth. It's a series of elevation points and uncompelling events. It might be better to concentrate solely on Jason Clarke and start later on the climb. It should lay out the map and the climb better. There are some compelling scenes. It may look best as IMAX 3D. The chaos during the storm has good tension. It is able to lay out the situation despite the chaos."
Friends with Benefits,6,2,4,20 September 2013," Emotionally detached couple make for emotionally detached rom-com
","Jamie (Mila Kunis) and Dylan (Justin Timberlake) are both successful professionals, but they just find true love. In frustration, they turn their friendship into friends with benefits.This is built as the anti-rom-com. In fact there is a fake rom-com in this movie where they point out all the movie clichés that they won't fall for. There's just something unlikeable about an anti-rom-com. There's a reason why formula rom-com has been successful for so long. The fact that both Jamie and Dylan try so hard to be detached emotionally makes this story emotionally detached. They just don't have the chemistry required. There are some pretty funny moments. Patricia Clarkson plays Jamie's inappropriate mother Lorna. She has some fun exchanges with the couple."

Minister of Magic Cornelius Fudge is determine to squash the news of Voldemort's return, and demonize Potter and Dumbledore. The world is coming down on Potter. First he's charged with underage magic when he fought off 2 dementors. Then he finds that Dumbledore has been keeping his distance. Finally, there's a new strict devious teacher Dolores Umbridge play by the amazing Imelda Staunton.It is truly dark time as Hogwarts fall into the hands of the evil Umbridge from the absent Dumbledore. Potter is convinced to form a group of students to learn magic on their own. More and more, Voldemort is coming out of the shadows. Torturing the students is really a new level of darkness in this series. There is a real sense of evil in this one more than the others. It is mostly due to the performance of Imelda Staunton and her evil character Umbridge. It sets the tone for the series from here on out."

He has always been uncomfortable with material things, and decide to leave that life completely behind. He has some profound experiences along the way to his bus in the Alaskan wilderness.Director Sean Penn adapts Jon Krakauer's novel. This movie is based on the true story of Christopher McCandless. This is a beautiful performance from Emile Hirsch. He embodies the role so completely. Sean Penn is able to infuse this movie with the same wanderlust that the real Christopher must have had. And Kristen Stewart has a great minor role. We really have a profound into the wild experience."

","Neurotic New York comedian Alvy Singer (Woody Allen) rehashes his love life to discover the cause of the ending of his romantic relationship to Annie Hall (Diane Keaton). He's been married twice before. She likes to smoke weed but he doesn't. Her family is cold to him. What seems small and even charming at first turns ugly as their relationship deteriorates. They try again but they soon find it's not working.The surreal and the touching really elevates this movie. This is one scene after another of compelling vignettes from a relationship. The writing is amazing. Despite its rapid fire style, it still feels connected and never loses touch with the audience. It's like a series of memories but it flows like a narrative. Many of the jokes are still as fresh as the first time I saw the movie. It's more interesting and daring than most movies today."
"Girl, Interrupted",6,0,1,1 May 2015," self-indulgent little girl who is driving herself crazy
","Susanna Kaysen (Winona Ryder) ODs on aspirins and family friend Dr. Crumble convinces her to go to Claymoore Hospital. She's struggling to find herself as a writer and had a fling with her parents' married colleague. She's the only one in her '67 class not to go to college. She insists that she's didn't attempt suicide. Her roommate Georgina Tuskin (Clea DuVall) is a compulsive liar. Sweet Torch Clark (Elisabeth Moss) has burns on her face. Daisy Randone (Brittany Murphy) has food and daddy issues. The police returns escapee Lisa Rowe (Angelina Jolie) who is a whirlwind rebellious personality. Soon, Susanna realizes that this is not simply for a short rest. Her boyfriend Tobias Jacobs (Jared Leto) gets drafted. Valerie (Whoopi Goldberg) is the wise nurse in charge. Dr. Melvin Potts (Jeffrey Tambor) declares Susanna has borderline personality disorder. Dr. Wick (Vanessa Redgrave) takes over her case with some big insights.Nurse Valerie calls Susanna 'a lazy, self-indulgent little girl who is driving herself crazy.' I disagree on the lazy part because she's trying very hard. However, much of the movie feels indulgent to me. Valerie tells Susanna that she's not really sick. The big surprise of the movie is that the mental hospital and its staff are not evil. They are mostly reasonable. Potts comes off a little clueless but Susanna is really just rebelling against her uptight parents and fighting against herself. That's not to say that this is an useless exercise. There are some good performances from the actresses. There is one great section with Ryder watching Jolie throw verbal bombs at Murphy. To me, that's the most impressive section of the movie. The final confrontation is a bit melodramatic. The movie should have wrapped up soon after the Jolie Murphy confrontations."

",Matt Buckner (Elijah Wood) is a studious student in Harvard School of Journalism but is expelled 2 months before graduation when cocaine is found in his room. It actually belongs to his roommate but he decides not to fight his roommate's powerful family. He reluctantly takes the hush money to visit his sister Shannon (Claire Forlani) in London. His brother-in-law Steve sent him off with his brother Pete (Charlie Hunnam) to a West Ham United football game. Pete is the leader of the Green Street Elite (GSE). Each football team has their own 'firm' or gangs of hooligans who drink and fight together. They hate both cops and journalists.Elijah Wood is a bit too much of a Hobbit to be a believable fighter. The movie could have given his character a little bit of skill to offset his disadvantage. There is a nice Fight Club feel about the mentality of these hooligans. The final act ramps up the drama in a way that puts me off a little. I guess the movie was always going to overdramatize the story but it could be less melodramatic. The soft rock music over a slo-mo montage of the big fight is a bit too much. I just wish it's more natural. Matt could have been caught by the cops and thrown out of the country. I also don't like Matt turning into lapdog. This could have been something great but it turns into more like Rumble Fish. It's not bad but it could have been better.

","The monolith has been there on Earth throughout human history. It goes all the way back to the ape-man. In the near future, they have found a monolith on the moon which is kept secret with a cover story. Then 18 months later, Dr. Dave Bowman (Keir Dullea) and Dr. Frank Poole (Gary Lockwood) are on a long deep space voyage to Jupiter on Discovery 1. HAL 9000 is the computer on board that is almost human. HAL seems to be malfunctioning. It kills Poole and the rest of the hibernating crew. Bowman pulls out HAL's memory and only then does he discover the true mission. Bowman encounters a monolith in the darkness of space near Jupiter.It's hard to talk about this movie without pointing out that this is more than the normal fun space sci-fi movie. This is definitely not Star Wars but it has qualities that transcends popcorn movies. It's confounding at times. It takes its time which bored some people. Director Stanley Kubrick obviously is saying something but it's not so simplistic that one could easily explain it. One either loves the vast nature of the movie or one hates the meandering story. Nevertheless, there is no denying the profound influence of this movie and its enduring fascination."

","Andy's toys come to life. Woody (Tom Hanks) is his favorite until a new toy Buzz Lightyear (Tim Allen) takes over as the new favorite. Woody gets jealous and tries to get rid of Buzz. Only they both get left behind.This was the first successful CGI full length movie. It ushers in PAXAR as a major force in movies. While the groundbreaking CGI is impressive, the characters are what's so charming about the movie. It's a stroke of genius to make the movie about toys. The CGI is still not photo realistic. People would be too hard to make look real. Toys are perfect. And the great voices allow life to be injected into these inanimate toys. It works as a great story on its own, but it's the revolution in CGI that has changed entertainment. This wasn't just a simple step but a real game changer."
Blood Diamond,7,0,1,16 September 2013," Djimon Hounsou brings humanity
","Diamond smuggler Danny Archer (Leonardo DiCaprio) and journalist Maddy Bowen (Jennifer Connelly) are working in the chaos of Sierra Leone. Solomon Vandy (Djimon Hounsou) is a poor fisherman. His village is attacked, and his family is scattered. His son is pressed into fighting for the rebels. He is put into forced labor mining for diamonds. When he finds a rare pink diamond, he figures it's his way out.There is more than white people coming to fix black people problems. Most of it is due to Djimon Hounsou's powerful performance. Leonardo DiCaprio does a weird African accent, but I'm willing to overlook it. This movie has a grand scale. The refugee camp is big. The battles are surprisingly big. The subject matter is big. So it's very interesting that the best part of the movie is Solomon Vandy. The only drawback is that the story is too big. It's unbelievably big. Since this isn't 007, I like the story to be more realistic."
War Machine,6,17,26,27 May 2017," ups and downs
","Gen. Glen McMahon (Brad Pitt) is no non-sense soldier. He lives a Spartan life often away from his family. He and his team such as the always shouting Greg Pulver (Anthony Michael Hall) are called in to cleanup the Afganistan quagmire. He is told to push the needle and not request for more troops. Instead, he is driven to win and sees his way where everyone else has failed. He uses any means to get his way while not getting his meeting with Obama. He finds President Karzai (Ben Kingsley), an isolated corrupt leader. Media consultant Matt Little (Topher Grace) suggests getting him an article in Rolling Stones.This dark comedy is too real to be funny. If Strangelove actually happened, the absurd movie would be less fun. One is always reminded that real people died here and there because the character of McMahon is based on a real person. While there are interesting bits, the general sense of this movie is one of tired resignation.I don't know if it's the Rolling Stones reporter but I'm reminded of Almost Famous. In that movie, the reporter is the protagonist and he's the eyes with which the audience sees the story. The rock star is a subject who is slowly revealed. In this movie, we are given only the narration of reporter Sean Cullen for the most part. He shows up for a limited role later in the movie. McMahon is the protagonist and we're stuck with him for good and for ill.Of all the characters, the most compelling is the 'confused' Marine Cpl. Billy Cole. His first scene with McMahon is devastating. His face is haunting. What he says resonates more than any other character. In the end, he is a minor character. His other scene is another compelling sequence as his squad goes into a hostile town. Again he is more compelling than anyone else and it is emotionally draining. This movie could have been great but McMahon can't be the protagonist. He is an absurd side character like Karzai in this movie."

Together with his partner agent K (Tommy Lee Jones), they police interstellar aliens on Earth. When an alien race threaten to destroy the Earth, they must recover something powerful.Director Barry Sonnenfeld is able to bring to life this imaginative comic book. It's smart and snappy. It has the wonderful crazy fun aliens. It is visually unique.The best part is the chemistry between the two leads. Tommy Lee Jones is grumpy stoic solid whereas Will Smith is marvelously energetic and funny.The script is tight, and hilarious. The CG is flashy and the look cool. It is everything a summer blockbuster should be."

","Ben Braddock (Dustin Hoffman) returns home to Pasadena, California after recently graduating college. His parents throw him a party but he rather be alone contemplating his future. He drives Mrs. Robinson (Anne Bancroft) home which leads to an affair while he falls for her daughter Elaine (Katharine Ross).Director Mike Nichols captures perfectly the daunting emptiness of impending future. Dustin Hoffman's performance is pitch perfect. He isn't the traditional leading man. He is flustered, lost and then angry. Anne Bancroft is a great cougar. There is an uncomfortableness to it all. Even the resolution isn't actually settled in the end. The brilliance of this movie is the shaky nature of everything that puts the audience on edge. It is loads of funny nervous giggles. Oh and there are the great Simon & Garfunkel songs."

They would like to marry off the daughters since the land is bound to be inherited by Bennet's cousin Mr. Collins. Wealthy bachelor Charles Bingley, his sister Caroline (Kelly Reilly) and friend Mr. Darcy (Matthew Macfadyen) are introduced at the dance. Elizabeth tries to interact with Darcy but he turns out to be rather cold. Mr. Collins comes expecting to have the eldest Jane but she's engaged. Mrs. Bennet suggests Elizabeth instead. Then there is the handsome charming Lieutenant Wickham who has an ugly tale about Darcy.There are Pride & Prejudice remakes all the time. This one is better than most. It has a great cast from top to bottom led by the beautifully feisty Keira Knightley. There isn't a weak spot in the cast. It keeps the focus on Elizabeth and her love life with more emotions. I think it's a great movie interpretation."

Their public persona is a loving couple but in reality, he hates her and can't get rid of the clingy Lina. Cosmo Brown (Donald O'Connor) is his piano playing childhood friend. Don meets Kathy Selden (Debbie Reynolds) as he jumps into her car getting away from adoring fans. They meet again when she jumps out of a cake at a company party. Monumental's boss R.F. Simpson (Millard Mitchell) is blindsided by the success of talking picture 'The Jazz Singer' and he tries to jump start his entry with Don and Lina. Cosmo Brown becomes the new music director. It's a struggle to do something new and worst of all, it's a struggle for the self-obsessed and delusional Lina with the horrible voice. The first attempt ends in a laughable disaster. The trio decides to change it into a musical with Kathy dubbing for Lina.The moment that Jean Hagen starts talking is the most hilarious thing. She's a real gut buster. Gene Kelly is a cad and a very likable one. Donald O'Connor is solid in being the nice guy second fiddle. His dancing is so energetic. Debbie Reynolds is completely adorable. The songs are incredible and so catchy. The dancing is iconic. Most importantly, the story is actually funny and compelling. For all the pain and tears shed, this movie is worth every praise it gets."
Puss in Boots,7,1,2,11 February 2014," Fun character but he needs a sidekick
","Puss in Boots (Antonio Banderas) is a wanted criminal, but he wants to clear his name. He plans to steal the magic beans from Jack & Jill, and use them to go to the Giant's home to steal the Golden Goose. He has a competitor in Kitty Softpaws (Salma Hayek) and Humpty Alexander Dumpty (Zach Galifianakis) from his past. Puss and Humpty used to be best friends in the orphanage.Puss in Boots is a side character from the Shrek franchise. He's a good character to do his own movie. He has the charisma, and he has an interesting story. However I'm struck with the lack of a sidekick. Shrek has Donkey, but Puss has nobody. Humpty is more of a villain in hiding. There is always a constant threat of double dealing. It's not the same thing. Other than that, this has enough charm and a few funny jokes. A few more funny jokes would help, but that's where the comedic sidekick would help."
Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind,9,3,5,23 September 2013," most imaginative concept
","Joel Barish (Jim Carrey) falls for Clementine Kruczynski (Kate Winslet) from the first moment they meet on a train. After a bad breakup, Clementine erases Joel from her memories. He decides to do the same to her. Patrick (Elijah Wood), Stan (Mark Ruffalo), and Mary (Kirsten Dunst) are the three slacker technicians who are running Dr. Mierzwiak (Tom Wilkinson)'s machine. As his memories are eliminated, he starts to fall in love with Clementine all over again. He struggles to hold on to his memories before it's all gone.The premise is amazing, but it's the imaginative visualization of the process that puts in on another level. Jim Carrey pours his heart into this very difficult disjointed performance. It's very effecting and probably one of his best non-impersonation performance. In its core, it's a beautiful love story. It's funny. It's poignant."
Elysium,6,0,2,26 April 2014," Neill Blomkamp recreates look of 'District 9' without the same success
","It's the year 2154. Max (Matt Damon) is an ex-con living in a dystopic police-state earth and crumbling Los Angeles. He's trying to live the straight life working in a factory. The rich and powerful are now living in the space station Elysium. Everybody wants a ticket to the utopian world where advanced med bay can cure almost anything. During an industrial accident, Max is flooded with a lethal dose of radiation. He has 5 days to live and is desperate to go up to Elysium. Defense Secretary Delacourt (Jodie Foster) is threatened by the president and is now orchestrating a coup. Max reunites with his old criminal boss Spider to try to steal some brain data. Except the data they stole is something more valuable than some bank accounts.The look and feel of this is reminiscent of Neill Blomkamp's other and better sci-fi 'District 9'. The story is weighted down by a few questionable setups. There are a lot of recycled sci-fi ideas in this movie and one unexpected one from 'Johnny Mnemonic'. The movie has its moments. If you could overlook some of the simplistic setups, there is a fun little action movie. However the backstory is a little too simplistic. It's fine for a small campy movie like 'Johnny Mnemonic', but this movie wants to be taken seriously. And I just can't take its message too seriously."

He recalls his childhood as a young troublemaker with his friends. His great love is Fat Moe's sister Deborah (Jennifer Connelly, Elizabeth McGovern).This epic, especially the longer versions of around four hours, is a legendary Sergio Leone gangster movie. It is memorable. De Niro is amazing. That's not a surprise. I do wish for a scene of the four friends together in the opening. The first time watching the first act can leave it a little cold and confused. Nevertheless, it's a compelling story and a worthwhile repeat watch."

Kim (Maggie Grace) is holidaying in Paris with her friend Amanda. Only an Albanian gang of human traffickers kidnaps them but before they leave, Kim's father Bryan Mills (Liam Neeson) gives one of the coolest threats in history. Little did they know, Bryan is a retired CIA killer.It's an odd thing to recommend a movie based so much on a single scene. Liam Neeson has the voice and the skills to pull it off. It has the simple Death Wish sensibility. He is a force of nature and no bad guy has a chance. The story has some ridiculous elements but who cares anyways. I want to see Liam kick some a...."
This Is Spinal Tap,8,1,4,24 February 2014," Mockumentary and Improvisation
","It's 1982. Filmmaker Marty DiBergi (Rob Reiner) follows the comeback tour of legendary British heavy metal band Spinal Tap (Michael McKean, Christopher Guest, Harry Shearer) in America.Director Rob Reiner started something special here. This form of mockumentary with improvisation may have been done earlier, but Christopher Guest would take it to all new heights. Along with Michael McKean, Harry Shearer, and Rob Reiner, they push the comedy genre to unknown territories. The fact is the jokes are so densely packed and coming out of everywhere that it could be watch over and over again. The improvisation leads to an uncontrolled feeling to the comedy, and a realism that was probably unintended. Unlike other spoofs like Airplane or Naked Gun from Zucker, the jokes aren't machine gun fired. The improvisation lend itself to be uneven and jazzy in nature."
Alice in Wonderland,7,0,0,30 May 2014," Crazy Burton visual style

Her family has fallen on hard times after the death of her father. With Hamish on bended knee in front of everybody, she runs away following the White Rabbit. She falls down a hole into a world called Underland which resembles her one dream which she's had ever since she was a little girl. She meets the Mad Hatter (Johnny Depp), the Red Queen (Helena Bonham Carter), the White Queen (Anne Hathaway) and many other fanciful characters.This is Tim Burton's visual style through and through. He gives an unique look to the already wonderful Wonderland. The characters are all too familiar. Mia Wasikowska is a perfectly lovely actress. I do wish her character has a bit more fun. That could be said of the movie itself. Both Johnny Depp and Helena Bonham Carter are suitably weird. However Anne Hathaway is way too weird and it doesn't fit her. Matt Lucas is fun as Tweedledee and Tweedledum. I am not in love with the story especially the third act. It tries to take it to a more serious real place. I like this more for the crazy visual style than anything else."

Together, they are treasure hunting and finds the Bracelet of Anubis. In ancient times, the Scorpion King used it to command the Army of Anubis. Now everybody is on a quest to stop the coming of the apocalyptic rising of the army of Anubis.The story is complicated and confusing. There is a lot of backstory to learn. The 15 minute prequel of The Rock as the Scorpion King didn't help any. It's more of an ad for the Scorpion King franchise. At least, it's easy to identify the good guys from the bad guys. So even if you don't understand what's happening, you know who to root for. The CGI and the swashbuckling makes up for some of the confusion."
The World's Fastest Indian,8,0,0,18 December 2015," good underdog character
","It's the 1960s. Burt Munro (Anthony Hopkins) is an amiable quirky old man in Invercargill, New Zealand. He spends his time fixing his 1920 Indian motorcycle to be the fastest ever. After suffering some health problems, he mortgages his house and travels to America to test his motorcycle on the Bonneville Salt Flats. Along the way, he finds friendly people willing to give a helping hand.This is a good underdog story. Burt is a charming old coot. His hard of hearing in Hollywood is annoying at first but I wonder if he only pretends at times. It gets more endearing. I really like some of the characters like Tina the transvestite and it's too bad that they can't stay. When he gets to the Salt Flats, it becomes a really good underdog sports movie. The action is pretty compelling despite the fact that the motorcycle goes in a straight line. The movie is able to incorporate a few interesting technical aspects. It's a nice charming movie."

The company is mining valuable unobtanium and they are encroaching the local aliens Na'vi. Avatars are genetically engineered alien look-alike with both alien genes and human genes. Jake is similar enough to his brother to take over his Avatar. Dr. Grace Augustine (Sigourney Weaver) leads a team to connect with the natives and find a diplomatic solution. As he gets to know the locals, it becomes harder to bridge the divide.The story is not as impressive. This is simplistic native warriors against big bad corporate land rapers. While the visuals are amazing, this is a long winded version of other movies like 'Dances with Wolves'. The big drawback for me is Sam Worthington. While the technology is there to give the avatars emotions, Sam isn't a good enough actor to take full advantage.This is one of the first motion captured performance that actually looks natural. The amount of CGI is impressive. The amount of skills and technology involved to put this movie together is a big step forward. Compared to the stuff that Robert Zemeckis does, the big difference is the faces. James Cameron brings real emotions to his CGI characters that is still missing from Zemeckis. The world of Pandora looks amazing and lush. It has enough fantasy and realism. It represented a new high point of 3D. It is a visual triumph."

Meanwhile, Buzz, Potato Head, Hamm, Rex, and Slinky Dog mount a rescue.Woody's captivity isn't the most exciting. Although Jessie talking about her Emily with Sarah McLachlan singing is very mesmerizing. I liked the rescue party much more. I especially love crossing the street in the traffic cones. The best new character has to be Tour Guide Barbie. She makes all the other toys better. Whenever the story moves back to the rescue team, it gets back to fun and humor."

","In 1924, a Jew Harold Abrahams (Ben Cross) and devoted Christian Eric Liddell (Ian Charleson) are training to go to the Olympics in Paris. Back in 1919, Abrahams faces prejudice from the Anglo Saxon establishment in the University of Cambridge. He falls for Gilbert and Sullivan actress Sybil Gordon (Alice Krige). Meanwhile Liddell runs in the Scotland highlands despite misgivings from his devout sister Jennie (Cheryl Campbell). He's born from missionaries in China. After Abrahams loses to Liddell, he is devastated and gets coaching help from Sam Mussabini (Ian Holm). At the Olympics, Liddell's 100 meter race heat is schedule for Sunday but he refuses to race on the Sabbath.These are pretty stuffy true life stories. It's not quite as compelling probably because the attention is split between two characters. Both are compelling historical figures and both deserve the attention. Director Hugh Hudson's style is rather conventionally competent. This is Oscar bait. It's a well made biopic of uplifting historical stories. The most interesting aspect of the movie to me is the music from Vangelis. It is synth heaven. The problem is that the movie can't narrow its focus only on Abrahams because of what happened in the Olympics. However Liddell isn't a very compelling story until the Olympics."

English Captain John Colby (Michael Caine) is one of the prisoners and a former professional footballer for West Ham United. Maj. Karl von Steiner (Max von Sydow) challenges him to a game. Colby accepts the challenge and starts building a team but he rejects any escape attempts. He doesn't want to get his men killed and would rather wait for the war's end. Hatch is desperate to escape and Colby reluctantly allows him to join. The Germans see the propaganda potential and set the game in Paris. Real football players are included in the movie starting with Pelé.It's a rather standard POW film. The actors are solid. Stallone does not embarrass himself as the brash American. There is no equal to Max von Sydow. John Huston is doing yeoman's work but not much more. The soccer stars would be appealing to fans but I don't recognize anybody other than Pelé. I'm surprised at his natural charisma coming through the screen. He's very effective at being Pelé. Tension isn't that high. The main problem could be the Nazis. The movie needs scary Nazis to elevate the intensity and they don't mistreat their prisoners enough. As for the soccer game, I'm sure it's appealing to see these great athletes on the pitch and the bicycle kick is beautiful but it has no drama. The drama is the escape and therefore, the score is actually meaningless. The game has no rooting value. The only way to make it meaningful is to play it in Berlin in front of Hitler with no chance of escape. The stakes becomes pride but the stakes here is escape. Overall, it's not boring but it could be better. I like the final escape which has a fun element. However, it is yet another example of the lack of ruthlessness by the Nazis."

Frank invites Jon to join them but it turns out to be a much longer stay than he expected as they try to record an album. It seems like only Don (Scoot McNairy) in the band likes the kid. Clara (Maggie Gyllenhaal) is downright hostile to him.I love the bit where Frank says his facial expression out loud. It's infinitely charming and funny every time he does it. It has a nice light wackiness about the movie. Domhnall Gleeson is terrific. Fassbender is surprisingly expressive without his face. Gyllenhaal is also very solid. However the movie loses a bit of steam after Frank loses his head. Some of the magic seems to dissipate. It still is charming and touching in the end.
Drag Me to Hell,7,1,4,27 September 2014," Fun old fashion horror
","Christine Brown (Alison Lohman) is a loans officer in a fight for the assistant manager job. She is afraid that she's too nice. Her boyfriend Clay Dalton (Justin Long)'s mother doesn't think much of her either. Then an old woman Mrs. Ganush (Lorna Raver) comes in for a loan extension and her boss Mr. Jacks (David Paymer) leaves it up to her. She refuses the extension despite the old woman begging. She feels shamed and places a curse on her with her button. It's a curse that will send her to hell. She goes to see a store front psychic Rham Jas.This is a great old fashion horror from Sam Raimi. The old lady is both gruesome and hilarious. Alison Lohman is the cute perfect victim and she screams well. The story isn't anything original but it's lots of fun. There is some CGI but I really love the real effects. It's a simple thing to fire junk at a girl's face. It goes up a notch when she's screaming with her mouth wide open. That's this movie. Raimi is using every trick in his book. The only scene I have a problem with is the old lady in the tool shed. It's a bit cartoonish for an anvil to be hanging from the ceiling. Dropping it on her head looked more like a Road Runner cartoon and using CGI really limits the horror fun. Otherwise, the movie is done with a nice sense of humor. It's the blend of horror and comedy that makes this such a great ride."
Selma,8,0,0,25 November 2015," some real power
","The movie starts with Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. (David Oyelowo) receiving the 1964 Nobel Peace Prize. Annie Lee Cooper (Oprah Winfrey) faces impossible hurdles to register to vote. President Lyndon B. Johnson (Tom Wilkinson) wants to concentrate on his war on poverty rather than voting rights. MLK decides to concentrate on Selma, Alabama. Opposing him are Gov. George Wallace (Tim Roth) and Sheriff Jim Clark.I love some of the behind-the-scene discussions like the two kids from Albany. In the same token, the president strikes me as a little off. The movie needs to raise up a villain for the story. The president shouldn't fill any part of that role. It is more fitting for Wallace and the Sheriff. This movie needs some more from behind their lines.It's a mostly quiet movie and it doesn't always get the balance between sincerity and thrilling. Some of the really sincere scenes drag. The big exception is Jimmie Lee Jackson's father at the hospital. The power exists in that man's face and the pain is all too evident. Of course, there is the first attempt crossing the bridge. That is a harrowing sequence delivering the same shock that the TV viewers of that day must have felt. David Oyelowo does a very nice reserved job with some big moments. Despite a few off notes, this movie is a powerhouse."
Grindhouse,8,1,3,22 May 2016," great homage
","This starts with Robert Rodriguez's Planet Terror and finishes with Quentin Tarantino's Death Proof. There are fake trailers and commercial before each feature. Each feature has its own value but what is the value of watching the whole thing together. Of course, this is a homage to the old drive-ins, discount-theaters double-bills. In that sense, watching the entire run has that added value. I would have liked for Tarantino to double-down on that idea. He could have shortened the features and concentrated more on the trailers. I would have loved to have some real trailers and commercials from the era. I don't know if the rights issue would prevent that. It would be like the end of 'Cinema Paradiso' where the character watches snippets of old movie kisses. As it is, this is a great homage to the cinematic past."
The Artist,7,3,8,14 September 2013," More homage than something new
","OK I get it. It's black and white. I don't want to play the meathead who can't appreciate the artistry of The Artist. But I don't think it's as profound as some have made it. There's a reason that kind of film went away and hasn't return in any significant way for 3/4 century. And I don't see this as a trend either.Jean Dujardin is pretty good playing broad as the matinée heartthrob who couldn't make it in sound. Bérénice Bejo is also pretty good. Without sound, that's one aspect that is missing from their performance and it feels the absence. If there was one way to break thru for me, it's to add much more physicality to the movie. Think of Buster Keaton, or Charlie Chaplin. The action is more cute than daring. The story is also cute and functional. Certainly there nothing ground breaking going on. The whole thing feels more like a homage to the silent era than creating something brand new."
The Twilight Saga: Breaking Dawn - Part 2,5,0,5,7 September 2015," don't like the final twist
",Bella (Kristen Stewart) is now a vampire. Jacob (Taylor Lautner) has been imprinted on baby Renesmee. Jacob reveals part of the secret world to Bella's father Charlie. Renesmee's accelerated growth turns her into a girl. She is spotted by cousin Irina who reports to the Volturi the suspected illegal turning of a child. Alice foresees the attack by the Volturi. The family recruits supporters or witnesses to plead their case to the Volturi.It's an improvement over Part 1. The last installment is a long exposition of everybody's powers leading to one big final battle. The movie becomes X-Men with a vast cast of new characters with new powers. I really like the final battle where so many of the characters bite it. Then there's a twist and it turns a pretty good movie into a somewhat disappointing one.
There's Something About Mary,8,1,3,24 November 2013," One of Farrellys' best
","From the Farrelly brothers, this is their highly inappropriate entry. After Dumb & Dumber and Kingpin, they're going further into outrageousness. Has there ever been another zipper incident filmed like that? That was some visual of those twig and berries. Who could forget the hair gel? Ted (Ben Stiller) is a nice guy who come to the defence of Mary (Cameron Diaz)'s mentally handicap brother. She agrees to go to the prom, but something terrible happens and they don't see each other for 13 years. He still pines for her, and hires sleazy PI Healy (Matt Dillon) to find her. Only Healy falls for her too, and he uses all his underhanded skills to get her.If there was one problem, it was that Ben Stiller couldn't get involved with Cameron Diaz sooner. For a long while, Cameron Diaz and Matt Dillon were doing their dance all by themselves. A more tougher write could have integrated everybody. That is a minor problem which is soon forgotten with the craziness. I remember as we got up to leave the theater, I hear a little girl bugging her big sister about what was behind his ear, and the big sis who couldn't shut her up. That's when I knew that it was mission accomplished."
Invictus,7,0,0,31 August 2015," fine historical drama
",Nelson Mandela (Morgan Freeman) wins the election but faces a divided country and questions about his governing abilities. His bodyguard Jason is dismayed at the white presidential security hired by Mandela. He notices that the whites are cheering South Africa's rugby team Springbok but the blacks are cheering for the opposition. He has to fight back efforts by black activists and recruits captain Francois Pienaar (Matt Damon). The team is losing but they make a historic run in the 1995 Rugby World Cup Championship hosted by South Africa.Director Clint Eastwood makes a perfectly fine historical drama. Freeman has the sense of the wise compelling leader. The only drawback with Matt Damon is his size. I don't see the physicality of the captain of the national rugby team. It's a minor quip. The drama is limited. It doesn't take full advantage of an underdog sports drama. This is more of a political drama but not a very daring one. The actual events may not have enough drama.
Mission: Impossible,7,2,4,19 October 2013," convoluted story but I don't care
","Ethan Hunt (Tom Cruise) is a secret IMF agent. His team has been infiltrated by a mole. When they go on their new mission, all are wiped out except for Ethan. The mission was actually a mole hunt, and the agency now thinks that sole survivor Ethan is the mole. He must fight to clear his name, and find the real mole.Director Brian De Palma has built an intense convoluted story. He tells an intriguing behind-the-scene story of the two writers writing competing scripts while the movie is in production. It's best not to think too hard and the movie doesn't really give you time to think. The clues, the new characters, and the action keeps coming without easy explanations. Tom Cruise is such a powerful presence that I don't actually question the story. I just enjoy the slick spy story. The action is fast and stylish. Realism and logic be damn."
La La Land,8,1,4,2 September 2017," love letter to Hollywood
","Mia Dolan (Emma Stone) is an aspiring actress just like her roommate friends and the multitudes of beautiful girls in Hollywood. Sebastian Wilder (Ryan Gosling) is obsessed with traditional jazz and opening his own pure jazz club. He is often his own worst enemy. The two have a combative, cutest of meet-cutes 'I Ran'. She leaves her boyfriend. He tries to grow up for her and accepts a place in his friend Keith (John Legend)'s band. They struggle to chase their dreams.This is a love letter to Hollywood especially the Golden Age of old Hollywood. The movie had a quick rise leading up to an infamous night at the Oscars and an almost as quick of a backlash. The complaints of cliché, hokey, and less than epic singing and dancing from the leads are all fitting to some extend. The problem is that those complaining are actually missing the point. Firstly, Stone and Gosling are perfect cast with their try-hard, glee-loving, pure-loveliness personalities. They are not the best singers or dancers. They are the high school drama kids who made it big. They are drama geeks and that's exactly what this movie is about. It's drama geek heaven. It revels in the old Hollywood clichés. I especially love the poignant ending. This is happiness in celluloid form."
Saw,7,1,3,28 November 2015," convoluted bloody fun
","Adam Stanheight wakes up in a dirty lavatory chained to a pipe. He finds Dr. Lawrence Gordon (Cary Elwes) also chained on the other side of the room. There's a dead body in the middle. They play audio tapes and the voice tells Gordon that he must kill Stanheight before 6 O'clock or else his wife Alison (Monica Potter) and daughter Diana (Makenzie Vega) will die. Adam finds two saws in the toilet tank. Gordon suspects the perpetrator is the Jigsaw Killer. He recounts police detectives David Tapp (Danny Glover), Allison Kerry (Dina Meyer) and Steven Sing (Ken Leung) investigating. Zep Hindle (Michael Emerson) is an orderly and John Kramer (Tobin Bell) is his patient. Amanda Young (Shawnee Smith) is the only known survivor of the killer's elaborate games with a harness wired to her jaw.I love the compelling premise of two guys chained in a room. Once Amanda Young's harness shows up, the movie becomes too convoluted to be scary. On the other hand, it becomes fun splatter. There is no denying that the elaborate plans are ridiculous but the movie completely owns it. Jigsaw is a Picasso clown and that's part of the fun. There is an interesting mystery of trying to escape from the room. It would be better if Jigsaw isn't so invasive leaving the clues. For example, there is no need for a clue to tell them to turn off the lights. It would be more compelling for the guys to guess on their own. It feels like a carefully laid out path and there is no tension in that. I'm not revealing the final twist but there are good points and bad points about that. It's impossibly elaborate but utterly surprising."
Mama,5,1,4,5 October 2013," Not scary
","The father of two little girls kills their mother, and kidnaps the kids. Five years later, the girls' uncle Lucas (Nikolaj Coaster-Waldau) finds them abandoned, and the father long dead. He tries to raise them with his girlfriend Annabel (Jessica Chastain). Annabel isn't one who wants kids. Little do they know that the two girls have been raised by Mama.For a horror movie, there isn't one scary moment to be had. She is just a creepy CG creation. She's interesting looking but nothing too original. We know that Mama would never hurt the kids. That's half of the scary possibilities gone automatically. She really only kills one person and nobody cares about that person. Also we don't actually see the kill. The ending isn't scary either. It does do something interesting, but not compelling enough to recommend this movie. It's a minor fail."
Super 8,7,1,4,14 September 2013," J.J. does a bit of Goonies and Close Encounters
","It's 1979 Lillian, Ohio. Joel loses his mother in a steel mill accident. His father Jack Lamb (Kyle Chandler) is a deputy sheriff. His friends want to make a zombie movie for the summer. They get Alice Dainard (Elle Fanning) to be the romantic lead. Alice is not happy to be driving without a license with the deputy's son as the sound man. They are filming by the railroad when a train derails. They promise Alice to keep it a secret from her troubled father (Ron Eldard). The train turns out to be a secret military transport. While the kids continue their filming, the Air Force does the cleanup but strange things keep happening.J.J. Abrams has made a good film. He's using a lot of that lens flare that he loves so much, but the train crash looks good. The kids' acting is paramount to this and they do an acceptable job. It would be nice if they had a bigger presence. Elle Fanning is like a giant to these kids. I didn't mind that as much as her monotone voice. It's a minor distraction. Other than Elle, none of the kids have a big enough presence. Maybe they're too normal or too new. There is good and bad about that. This has both the innocence of an earlier times and the tension of a creepy sci-fi thriller. It strikes different cords. It's a bit of Goonies and a bit of Close Encounters."
The Last Samurai,6,1,2,5 April 2014," Acceptable but not great
","It is 1876. Nathan Algren (Tom Cruise) is a returning veteran after slaughtering indians. He is haunted by his past, and is now a suicidal drunk hocking guns for the manufacturer. Then he is hired by the Emperor of Japan to train his troops to fight renegade samurai who opposes modernity. He is forced to send his men to battle before they are ready. Then he is taken prisoner by Katsumoto (Ken Watanabe).Drunk acting is arguably one of the most difficult, and Tom Cruise doesn't do it well. He overacts. One can see his acting rather than inhabiting the role. Once he is taken prisoner, the movie moves along too slowly. There is a little too much simplification. Too many minds may be the better option. However, one cannot deny the beauty of this movie. If you're looking for semi-realistic battles between samurai and ninja or samurai and civil war era soldiers. This definitely has that going for it. However there is something wrong with who the last samurai is. There is something off-putting about this movie."
Sinister,7,1,5,29 August 2013," Ethan Hawke solid in tense horror
","Ethan Hawke is crime writer Ellison Oswalt. It's been 10 years since his breakout hit. He has moved his whole family into a murder house intending to write his new book on. The old family had all been hung in the old tree in the backyard, but the family's young daughter went missing. Strange things keep happening in the house. For example, he finds some 8mm snuff films in the attic, and discover there may be other related murders.Ethan Hawke is rock solid in driving this movie. This is all his movie. The atmosphere is amazing. If there's anything they desperately needed, it's some better supporting characters. The wife, the kids, the bumpkin young cop, they are all stock characters done by unknown actors. There're no standouts in those areas. The movie works from the creepy atmosphere that builds and builds."
Home Alone 2: Lost in New York,6,0,1,30 November 2013," Had good momentum but then he had to go find a house
","Macaulay Culkin is still cute one year later. This time Kevin gets on the wrong plane. He goes to New York and his family to Miami. Kevin is alone in the big city. With his father's money, he books into the Plaza. He must outsmart the suspicious concierge Tim Curry. Then he runs into The Wet Bandits (Joe Pesci, Daniel Stern) once again.I'm willing to accept the Wet Bandits to return in this sequel. It makes no sense, but that's not the biggest obstacle. The biggest obstacle is the repeat of the first movie. I don't understand why they feel the need to copy. They had a fun setting in the hotel. It would be so much more interesting to have the hijinx there. Kevin pulls a funny fast one on the concierge. The movie needs more of that. Imagine if Kevin had to outsmart all three of them at the same time. That would be a much better sequel."
3 Idiots,4,5,10,26 January 2017," magical nerd
","Farhan and Raju are eager to reunite with their college friend Rancho. They find Chatur instead who have worked hard to brag about his success since his challenge 10 years ago. They go off in search for Rancho but there's a secret. In flashbacks, they are freshmen as mechanical engineering students. Rancho refuses to submit to hazing from upperclassmen and the dictatorial teaching methods of Dr. Viru Sahastrabuddhe. Rancho's rebellious nature win over Farhan and Raju. He rails against Virus' pressure after a student's suicide. He falls for Virus' daughter Pia.I don't think Rancho works completely. He's too perfect like a mythical creature. He's a magical nerd. The movie needs to build up this high pressure world a lot better before it can tear it down. I can guess at what this movie is striving for but I don't see it as funny or compelling. There is also a great twist in the middle and one at the end which is easily foreseeable from a mile away. The middle twist should be a better exposition. There should be a better story and a better journey to find Rancho. Ultimately, I don't think this speaks to me although it might be lost in translation."
Life Is Beautiful,7,1,3,10 January 2015," broad slapstick and heartfelt drama
",It's 1939 Italy. Jewish Guido (Roberto Benigni) tries to open a bookstore but he continues to face hurdles with a smile. He falls for the lovely Dora (Nicoletta Braschi). She is engaged to an ambitious government official but she runs off with Guido. They get married and have a son named Joshua. The fascists would catch up to them but Guido would pretend the camp to be a giant game so that he can hide the truth from his son.Roberto Benigni is going for extremely broad comedy here which turns eventually. The movie is always a bit odd to have slapstick comedy while the audience knows perfectly well what is happening. It makes the movie unfunny. The movie is much more compelling as a heartfelt drama.
Up,9,1,2,30 December 2013," Real tear jerker opening
","Carl Fredricksen (Ed Asner) as a young quiet kid idolized explorer Charles Muntz (Christopher Plummer) and his discovery of Paradise Falls. Ellie is much more animated and also a great fan of Muntz. Together they would marry and live their lives together until the day she dies. Now Carl is hounded by a property developer and forced to go to a retirement home. Instead he ties a sea of helium balloons to his home and float away to Paradise Falls. Wilderness Explorer scout Russell who's trying to get an Assisting the Elderly badge gets dragged along on the adventure.The first part of this movie is a real tear jerker. When Carl and Ellie's lives flash through the years, all the heart breaks and all the love just jump off the screen. Then there is comedy as the journey to Paradise Falls starts. The movie gets very surreal with dog translators, and a very colorful bird. The villain is a bit too villainy. The story gets too serious at times. But it ends almost as emotionally as it starts. It is one of the best of Pixar."
Snowden,6,1,3,31 August 2017," informative
","It's 2013. Edward Snowden (Joseph Gordon-Levitt) is holed up with Glenn Greenwald (Zachary Quinto) and Laura Poitras (Melissa Leo) in a HongKong hotel room. They convince Guardian editor Ewen MacAskill (Tom Wilkinson) to print sensitive documents stolen by Snowden that implicates the US government in the widespread spying on the American public. Snowden was discharged from the military for medical reasons. He was an Ayn Rand loving Republican who served in the CIA. The highly skilled programmer has a long winding successful career but the unchecked intrusion starts to concern him. His stress affects his relationship with liberal girlfriend Lindsay Mills (Shailene Woodley). Eventually, he copied the files and smuggled them out of NSA.There are some good information but Oliver Stone fails to make me root for Snowden no matter how hard he tries. And he tries very hard. JGL creates a naive true-believer who grows to hate the corruption of his work. Obviously, Stone has a point of view and is pushing a narrative from Snowden's side. I don't have a problem with that but he has to recruit my sympathies. In the end, a couple of his arguments rang hollow. JGL's mimicry of Snowden does not help. He has a flat speaking voice with some minor autistic tendencies. It's not like the general public knows his voice so it's not really necessary. The information is good but public affairs have overtaken his story. It's almost quaint at this point."
The Hurricane,7,0,0,18 May 2014," Standard biopic and great performance
","Rubin 'Hurricane' Carter (Denzel Washington) was a prize fighter. In 1966, he was arrested and convicted for a mass shooting at a bar in Paterson, New Jersey. Vindictive police detective Della Pesca (Dan Hedaya) has been after him since he was 11. With falsified evidence and rampant racism, Carter and his friend get locked up for 3 life terms. He sets about writing his biography which is eventually published. Then 7 years later in Toronto, student Lesra (Vicellous Reon Shannon) finds his biography in a pile of used books. He's a poor student from Brooklyn who is given a chance to study in Canada. With the biography, he starts a long journey to get Carter's release and his good name back with the help of his mentors Lisa (Deborah Kara Unger), Sam (Liev Schreiber) and Terry (John Hannah).It's a very standard biopic from Norman Jewison. Carter's story is never in doubt. Most people would know the ending to the movie. So the tension is not that high. The investigation isn't that exciting. It's no John Grisham novel. However there is a compelling story, and a very compelling performance from Denzel Washington. He is exceptional in this as in many of his performances. There is also a nice side story of a young man who finds purpose in life."
A Clockwork Orange,8,1,3,30 August 2015," orchestra of violence
","In a dystopian world, Alex DeLarge (Malcolm McDowell) leads his 3 followers in ultraviolence. Eventually, he is arrested for killing an old lady. In prison, he finds the violence in religion to be calming. He volunteers for an experimental treatment program. The treatment makes him ill when confronted with violence and sex. He is released and is confronted by the violence that he himself promoted.This is almost experimental in its examination of sex and violence in society. It is an unique surreal film. The ideas behind it may be lost to people who sees this simply as an artistic violent movie. No matter how one dissects this, Malcolm McDowell's performance is beyond reproach. He shows his great acting abilities."
Stalingrad,6,3,6,19 December 2014," OK war movie in the modern era
","It's August 1942 and some German soldiers are resting in Porto Cervo, Italy after battling in North Africa. Lieutenant Hans von Witzland is their new by-the-book commander. The men are soon sent to the eastern front. It's a harrowing fight filled with horrors as they get surrounded by the Russians.It is a little bit hard to differentiate some of the men. Most have similar haircuts and some look very similar. It's also hard to differentiate by their voices since I don't understand German. I certainly don't recognize any of the actors. Once they get into the battle gears, it's nearly impossible.The battle sets are big. The rubble is impressive. However there is something old fashion about some of this. It doesn't have the feel of reality. There are too many wildly overacting 'shocking' cliché moments. Everybody is yelling. The action is also not the best choreographed. It is still impressive that they actually stage them. Overall there are some good gritty bloody stuff going on but it gets undercut by a lot of clichés."
Woman in Gold,8,1,1,7 November 2015," compelling story
","Maria Altman (Helen Mirren) loses her sister Luise and is left to take care of the family legacy. Randy Schoenberg (Ryan Reynolds) is a struggling lawyer heavily in debt after a failed upstart. They are both from famous Vienna families and share losses to the Nazis. He reluctantly meets Maria as a favor to his mother. Maria had lost many in her family and most of their possessions. The most prominent is a picture of her aunt painted by Klimt worth over $100 million.This is a compelling story with Helen Mirren going great work once again. I love that neither leads are that driven to get restitution. She's reluctant to go back to Austria and he's in it more for the money in the beginning. They are true underdogs. Tatiana Maslany is also impressive as the younger Maria. Ryan Reynolds is a little flat at the beginning and he shouldn't joke around in the later sections. He may not be a great fit for the character. The story is very compelling and intriguing. There are usually differences from the real story. The only one that irked me a little is the discussion of money. In the beginning, Maria claims she's not selling the painting making it more of a principle of justice. In the end, she obviously sold some of the paintings. I don't have a problem with selling but the film shouldn't suggest that it's not about the money."

","Blu (Jesse Eisenberg) is a baby macaw who was captured and smuggled to the States. The bird was lost and taken in by little girl Linda. They grow up together. She's a bookstore owner and he's completely domesticated. Brazilian scientist Tulio tells Linda that Blu is the last male of his species, and she needs to bring Blu to Rio de Janeiro. When they get to Rio, Blu and the female Jewel (Anne Hathaway) get stolen.This is a brightly colored confection. It's a neon bright show that tired me out. The story isn't anything special. The characters are fine but I don't see much staying power. Nothing is really exceptional other than those exceptionally brilliant colors. It's a good kiddie movie. They'll get distracted by all the pretty colors."

","Max Tooney (Pruitt Taylor Vince) is pawning off his trumpet and recounts his life on an ocean liner with the legendary 1900. At the turn of the century, a baby is found by the crew of SS Virginian. There are no parents to be found and the crew raises him with the name 1900 (Tim Roth). He never sets foot on land and starts playing the piano. The ship brings immigrants and transports the wealthy. In wartime, it is turned into a hospital ship. It is now being demolished and Max pleads to have the work stopped until they find 1900.It wants to be a personal epic. However like 1900 himself, it feels like the movie is traveling a lot without getting anywhere. There is little drama and no tension whatsoever. It's an idea for a character but it lacks a compelling story. The sets are beautifully made and the movie looks good. This is a man in the background of great history but his story has no drive."
Where Eagles Dare,6,2,5,17 June 2015," highly improbable but still good action war movie
","During WWII, American General Carnaby is captured after his plane crashed on its way to Crete. A British team is sent to rescue him from a German mountain castle before he reveals plans for the second front. The team is led by Major John Smith (Richard Burton) and includes American Morris Schaffer (Clint Eastwood). Upon parachuting down, one of the men's neck is broken under suspicious circumstances. There is a massive German base and something is going wrong with the mission.This is a relatively good war espionage movie. It starts with a weak explanation. The Allies would bomb the hell out of the place and Eisenhower would be happy about it. My b.s. detector goes off right away. The German helicopter confused me a little but they did have a few of them back then. The story could have been simpler but it insists on trying to add layers of double-cross. It finally climax in a confusing reveal where even Clint Eastwood's character says he's confused. If one tries to dig into the twists, it's a highly-improbable and overly-complicated way to get what they're after. The escape with the prisoners is something that needs lots of popcorn and no brain function to truly appreciate. It still has some good action and two excellent stars."

It's teleportation and it works. However it's only for inanimate objects. He is surprised to find out that she's a reporter and wants to keep it a secret. Her Particle magazine boss and possessive former boyfriend Stathis Borans (John Getz) doesn't believe her. Seth offers her exclusive access as long as she hold off for awhile. Seth gains insight while with Veronica and fixes the problem. Then he tries to teleport himself but a fly contaminates the telepod.David Cronenberg has created something special from a campy 50s B-movie. The creations are creepy and Cronenberg uses it to its most disturbing effect. Then there is Jeff Goldblum. His jitteriness is the perfect mannerism to being a fly. His disintegration is one of the greatest horror transformations of all times. Geena Davis is more than just a beauty. She shows enough bravery in her character that she is perfectly believable in her later scenes. It is a great horror movie.

Ann gets kidnapped while others are getting killed. Mary Kelly hides the baby. Police Inspector Frederick Abberline (Johnny Depp) has visions which help in his brilliant investigations with his partner Peter Godley (Robbie Coltrane). Sir William Gull (Ian Holm) is a physician to the Royals and a respected medical teacher.I love the dark, murky, brutal style. It's fitting for the times and the subject matter. The story is a bit disjointed which I like for this movie. It's a jumble of pieces from two sides of a story coming together. It is bloody and ominous. Granted, the story doesn't flow smoothly but the style more than makes up for it."

Vince Papale (Mark Wahlberg) is a struggling 30 year old part time teacher. He gets fired with the latest cutback and his wife leaves him. He reluctantly goes to the tryout.This is simply by the book underdog story. It's no Rudy, but it works on it's own level. Mark Wahlberg delivers a solid if somewhat uninspired performance. Greg Kinnear is also solid with a little more color. Elizabeth Banks is lovely as the love interest. The movie is solid and full of clichés. Cinematographer Ericson Core takes the director's chair for the first time and proves himself very capable. In a way, he's the Vince Papale behind the scenes."

He makes fun of her cheerfulness and hates all the quaint small town happiness but he's certainly willing to hit on her.Harold Ramis has created an iconic comedic premise. It has ingratiated itself into the lexicon of society. Bill Murray is the perfect actor to portray this sarcastic character. Along the way, we have some great laughs and some well constructed sequences like Phil trying to sleep with Rita. Andie MacDowell is cute with an adorable charm. In the end, it finds a heart in this wonderfully simple premise."
National Treasure,6,0,2,9 September 2013," Don't think too Hard
","Benjamin Franklin Gates (Nicolas Cage) is following a family tradition of treasure hunting as they have been gathering clues to a war chest hidden by the Founding Fathers after the Revolutionary War. The clues follow all the big American icons as one big scavenger hunt. Riley Poole (Justin Bartha) is the geeky sidekick. Ian Howe (Sean Bean) is the evil competition. Patrick Gates (Jon Voight) is the grumpy father. Abigail Chase (Diane Kruger) is the government official who gets dragged into the caper when Benjamin steals the Declaration of Independence.Just don't think too hard about this movie. It is a fun mindless treasure hunt. It was fun as long as they are visiting some real places. Once they go underground into the movie stage portions, it gets extremely fake and the action gets uncompelling."
Reservoir Dogs,8,0,2,3 January 2016," Quentin Tarantino deconstructs the crime movie
",A group of men are having benign banter in a diner. They have color code names. Mr. White (Harvey Keitel) brings a horribly wounded Mr. Orange (Tim Roth) back to the hideout. Mr. Pink (Steve Buscemi) is ranting about the quick police response as a setup. Joe Cabot hired the crew for a diamond store holdup keeping their identities secret from each other. Calm and disturbed Mr. Blonde (Michael Madsen) shows up with a captured cop.Quentin Tarantino deconstructs the crime movie by concentrating on the in-between scenes. He peppers the scenes with sharp extraneous dialog. It makes for some really memorable scenes. The diner scene and the torture scene are unforgettable. The whole movie does drag as we wait for the actual robbery action scenes but this movie is something completely different.
Love & Mercy,7,4,6,31 January 2016," better for Dano to play both
","This is the story of Brian Wilson during two time periods. In 1964, Brian Wilson (Paul Dano) has a panic attack and quits touring with the band. Instead he concentrates on writing for the new record Pet Sounds. He struggles from his abusive father and starts hearing voices. In the 80s, Brian (John Cusack) is under the control of his therapist Dr. Eugene Landy (Paul Giamatti). He buys a car from saleswoman Melinda Ledbetter (Elizabeth Banks) who eventually breaks Landy's hold on him.This is a compelling biopic of an interesting person. Paul Dano really hits it out of the park. His section has some great scenes. On its own, John Cusack does a great job. Put together, I can't help but think that Cusack is doing a passable imitation of Dano's performance. I'm not judging their relative acting skills. I just think that Dano has always played this type of character and he simply fits better. I'm certain that Dano would be nominated for an Oscar if he played both time periods. Landy is the villain of the piece and Giamatti plays him with gusto. For a more nuanced character, the movie needs to show his character saving Brian at the beginning. Splitting the time period so neatly does lessen some important sections of Brian's life."
The Wind that Shakes the Barley,8,0,1,10 August 2016," brothers' tragedy
","It's 1920 Ireland. Damien O'Donovan (Cillian Murphy), his crush Sinead (Orla Fitzgerald), and his friends are harassed by the British Black and Tans. His friend and Sinead's brother Micheail is beaten to death. He abandons practicing medicine in a London hospital to join the fight against British occupation under his brother Teddy (Padraic Delaney) who commands the local IRA brigade. They get captured and imprisoned with Dan (Liam Cunningham). Damien had witnessed the socialist train driver Dan being beaten by British troops for refusing to transport them. They manage to escape. After tough fighting, the Anglo-Irish Treaty is signed at the end of 1921. Teddy pleads for acceptance of the autonomous Irish Free State under the British crown. Damien follows Dan's fight for a socialist independent republic for the entire island. The two brothers end up on opposite sides of a civil war.The British are shown as sadistic villains. It's a little over the top but certainly not unexpected. The brothers' relationship could be more emphasized. Cillian Murphy is the star. I wish Padraic Delaney could be his equal. The most compelling parts are after the treaty when the brothers struggle to not fight each other. It turns a nationalist independence war into a personal family war. Cillian is so infuriating that I wanted to shake him. It ends not with a heroic fight but a family tragedy."
How to Train Your Dragon,8,0,0,14 October 2013," Great family movie
","Hiccup (Jay Baruchel) and his village is constantly attacked by dragons. Weakling Hiccup isn't much help. He befriends an injured dragon missing part of his tail fin. He helps it by making a prosthetic tail. In the meanwhile, he becomes a great study of dragons. Instead of fighting them, he's able to subdue them.DreamWorks has created a beautiful 3D animation. The story is a beautiful one of friendship between the boy and the dragon. Jay Baruchel is really terrific as the geeky boy. The whole group of kids have real charisma. I especially like the training sessions, and how the boy's relationship with the dragon pays off."
The Great Raid,6,1,1,13 November 2014," functional war movie but scattered among various plots
","In the notorious POW camp at Cabanatuan in occupied Philippines, the Japanese hold about 500 American prisoners who had survived the Bataan Death March. The Japanese are getting orders to liquidate the prisoners. Over the course of 5 days starting at Jan 27, 1945, Lieutenant Colonel Mucci and Captain Prince (James Franco) lead the 6th Ranger Battalion along with the Alamo Scouts and Filipino guerrillas to liberate the prison camp some 30 miles behind enemy lines. The movie switches back and forth between the rescue, people like Margaret Utinsky (Connie Nielsen) who is a nurse in occupied Manila, and the prison camp where men led by Major Gibson (Joseph Fiennes) suffer under Japanese brutality.It's an old fashion traditional war movie. It does stray into melodrama from time to time. It's also scattered among the various character sideplots. The scale of production is just below epic. There are a lot of good actors at work. However that does make me question why Benjamin Bratt is cast as the soldier in charge of the rescue. That seems to be the more important role and a more established actor like Fiennes should be doing it. This would work better if the movie picks between a prison movie or a rescue movie and put Fiennes in the lead of either. The final rescue action is done well and the movie is generally good but not great."
Total Recall,8,3,5,18 September 2014," Just a lot of fun
",Douglas Quaid (Arnold Schwarzenegger) has recurring nightmares about Mars. His wife Lori (Sharon Stone) is jealous of the brunette in his dreams. There is a rebellion for independence on Mars led by Kuato while the administrator Vilos Cohaagen (Ronny Cox) puts it down and keeps the mines operating. Quaid goes to Rekall to have memories of a Mars secret agent vacation implanted. It activates his old memory of being secret agent Hauser erased by the Agency. He is hunted by his evil wife and Richter (Michael Ironside). He battles to return to Mars where he finds his dreamgirl Melina (Rachel Ticotin). Or maybe it is just the Rekall going wrong.This is a fun 80s sci-fi action. The story is great. There is a certain cheese factor in the style which is very endearing. Arnold and everybody are great in this. It has great action. It is a fun popcorn movie with a brain behind it.
Limitless,6,0,1,13 December 2014," Intriguing premise and Bradley Cooper
","Eddie Morra (Bradley Cooper) is on a NYC balcony about to jump. He tells the audience that he has a 4 digit IQ but he missed something. The movie flashes back. Eddie is a blocked writer with a book contract. His girlfriend Lindy (Abbie Cornish) is tired of him and dumps him. He runs into ex-brother-in-law Vernon Gant. Vernon is with a pharmaceutical company and gives him an experimental drug. It activates all of the brain. When Eddie takes it, the effects are impressive and he writes tons of pages. The next day, he tries to get more from Vernon but he finds Vernon killed. Eddie discovers Vernon's stash. He finishes his book, learns everything, makes a killing in the market, and reconnects with Lindy and his ex-wife Melissa Gant (Anna Friel). His success draws the attention of business mogul Carl Van Loon (Robert De Niro).Director Neil Burger is using a lot of visual magic to emulate the effect. He's using blue to simulate the dull everyday world. I don't really like the cold artificial feel to the movie. Also I don't like the movie getting bog down with a business deal. The movie loses tension as it keeps going back to it. There are lots that I do like about the movie. I like Bradley Cooper although I don't necessarily like his character and I don't really like his narration. I find the premise very intriguing. I just wish this was a better movie where I could root for the character and be invested in the story more."
Rocky,8,1,3,11 February 2014," Sly's Best
","Rocky Balboa (Sylvester Stallone) is a tomato fighting bums. Mickey (Burgess Meredith) has even taken his gym locker away. He collects for a loan shark, and is infatuated with mousy Adrian (Talia Shire). When heavyweight champion Apollo Creed (Carl Weathers) can't find an opponent for a short notice fight for the Bicentennial, he picks the Italian Stallion out of a book. Apollo wanted a white local guy with a cool nickname. It's a chance of a lifetime for Rocky.Stallone wrote this script, and gave possibly his best performance ever. Everybody gave great performances including Burt Young as the memorable Paulie. All the characters have become movie icons. It is a bit too long. The 2 hour running time is extended for the simple storyline. However, the movie never stalls. Sly is absolutely charming, and his lovable Rocky keeps the movie focused on him. The fight action is about 10 minutes at the end. It is exciting, and the final scene is as memorable as it gets."
Don't Breathe,8,4,7,3 July 2017," solid genre thriller
","Rocky (Jane Levy), Alex (Dylan Minnette), and Money (Daniel Zovatto) have been breaking in the remaining mansions of the devastated neighborhoods in Detroit. Rocky is desperate to get enough money to leave for California. Alex has a crush on her and uses his security knowledge. He sets specific limitations to avoid long prison terms. Money gets a tip on a blind veteran (Stephen Lang) who received a large legal settlement. The trio finds him a scary opponent despite his handicap.Fede Alvarez delivers a solid genre thriller. He is unrelenting in the tension and injects enough twists to keep the audience on their toes. Alex with his puppy love probably has the most rooting interest. Rocky is a terribly flawed protagonist. Jane Levy is an appealing actress who keeps the role from falling into villainy. Stephen Lang is a force of nature who brings a truly fearsome power. This is a well-made thriller."
The Red Violin,6,1,1,6 December 2014," beautiful music but not much tension
","A Nicolo Bussotti violin, known as 'the red violin,' is auctioned off in Montreal. It was built in 1681 and Nicolo's last. The movie follows the violin from the story of its construction to the present. Nicolo's wife Anna Rudolfi is pregnant and her servant Cesca reads the tarot cards. When Anna dies in childbirth with her child, Nicolo mixes her blood with the vanish to paint on the violin giving it the unusual red color. The tarot cards foretells the future of the violin and not Anna.This is a difficult thing to make each section as compelling as possible. In the end, that is not achieved. Each section doesn't have enough time to tell its drama compellingly. Also the movie already shows that the violin doesn't get buried or burned. The music is beautiful as long as you love violin music. This is a beautiful sounding movie but the plot doesn't have much tension. There are some poetic moments but it meanders a bit."
Shine,7,0,0,7 March 2015," some good performances
","David Helfgott (Geoffrey Rush) can't stop talking and unable to relate normally. He surprises everybody by being a great pianist. As a child, he struggles under his domineering father Peter (Armin Mueller-Stahl). He's a child prodigy. His father pushes him to the breaking point by insisting on playing the difficult Rachmaninoff. As a young man (Noah Taylor), he gains some success and eventually escapes from his abusive father to go to school in London. He breaks down and is institutionalized.The adult Helfgott is fascinating with a terrific performance from Geoffrey Rush. His reveal to his acquaintances is a great scene. However half of the movie doesn't have Rush. It's about the younger Helfgott and the best part is his crazy father. It's a disturbing performance from Armin Mueller-Stahl. Noah Taylor also does a nice job."
Eyes Wide Shut,6,0,3,25 June 2015," meandering cold movie
","Upper class New York couple Alice (Nicole Kidman) and Dr. William Harford (Tom Cruise) seems to have it all with their girl. They go to his rich patient Victor Ziegler (Sydney Pollack)'s party where he ends up treating an overdose. His medical school mate Nick Nightingale gives him a password to a special party. He meets prostitute Domino. Milich and his sexualized daughter rents him the costume. He is confronted at the mansion and is kicked out. He becomes obsessed with getting back into the secret society.There is no arguing that Stanley Kubrick makes good looking films. Looking back, there is something meta about Kidman and Cruise's crumpling marriage both on and off the screen. There is a fascination with this movie like slipping a small glimpse into their real lives. However I don't like the meandering nature of the plot and the disconnected nature of these characters. I don't care about any of the characters and I don't find their relationship compelling. The numerous naked beautiful women actually becomes numbing especially since most of them are wearing masks. They might as well be mannequins. Other than Leelee Sobieski and Nicole, none of the female characters are that interesting."
Beauty and the Beast,7,1,1,4 July 2017," fine live-action take of Disney animated classic
","A selfish prince (Dan Stevens) lords over the local villagers. One rainy night, an old woman seeking shelter is sent away. She turns out to be an Enchantress. She curses the prince and his servants. He's turned into a Beast to be forgotten by the world. Belle (Emma Watson) is tired of the provincial life and the tiresome pursuing self-obsessed Gaston (Luke Evans). LeFou (Josh Gad) is his adoring man-servant. Belle asks for a rose from her traveling father. He takes a rose from the castle and is imprisoned by the Beast. Belle volunteers to take her father's place as the Beast's prisoner.Emma Watson is a good actress. Her singing is average but that has its charms. Gaston is a great villain. The CGI looks good for the most part but I am uncertain about the Beast. Belle is a modern empowered character which does strike me as a little odd. It would help to have more scenes like the villager berating Belle for teaching the little girl to read. The more backwards the villagers, the better it is for Belle to rebel against. Then there is the basic prisoner love story at the core of this fairy tale. It remains problematic to me. There are ways to ameliorate this but the movie sticks to the story. This is good but the Disney animation remains the better."
Sicario,9,0,2,13 July 2016," one of the year's best
",Kate Macer (Emily Blunt) and Reggie Wayne (Daniel Kaluuya) are part of a FBI strike team looking to rescue kidnapped victim in Arizona. They find a hideout filled with dead bodies. A booby trap kills two cops. A mysterious Matt Graver (Josh Brolin) tricks Kate to volunteer to join him on a mission around El Paso. He's supposed to be an adviser to the DOD. An even more mysterious Alejandro (Benicio Del Toro) from Columbia is part of the team with Delta Force and a couple of Marshals. She is shocked to be going into Mexico to retrieve a prisoner.Director Denis Villeneuve and cinematographer Roger Deakins deliver beautiful action in the beginning. The drive through Juárez doesn't actually have any big action but the tension is amazing. The scene at the border is thrilling. The first section of the movie is Alice falling down the rabbit hole. The acting is superb. The story is not different but it is told with a powerful intensity. This is simply one of the year's best.
Departures,7,1,2,25 March 2014," Charming funny little Japanese movie
","Daigo Kobayashi loses his symphony cellist job when the orchestra shuts down. He's deeply in debt spending 18 million yens on his cello. He decides to sell off his cello, and move on with his life. His mother left a home to him, and he goes back to his hometown with his wife Mika. He answers an ad entitled 'Departures' thinking it's a travel agency only to discover that it's supposed to be 'Departed'. It's a funeral home, and he tries to hide it from his wife.It's a charming funny little Japanese movie. It won the Oscar for Best Foreign Language Film of the Year. The Japanese funeral ceremony is very fascinating, and it's a great look at a different culture. These are nice lovely characters. I find them very human. The comedy is very light. The drama is very touching. It is a little slow at over 2 hours, but the slow pace does fit the subject matter. It's very reminiscent of 'Six Feet Under' without some of the edgier and darker family drama. The social disdain for the work is very eye opening."
Pretty Woman,7,0,1,14 January 2015," Julia Roberts absolutely winning
","Edward Lewis (Richard Gere) is a successful corporate raider who doesn't spend the time on his personal life. While leaving a party, he is blocked in and takes Philip (Jason Alexander)'s new car. He's unfamiliar with the stick shift and hopelessly lost. Prostitute Vivian Ward (Julia Roberts) is out of money after her roommate Kit De Luca (Laura San Giacomo) wastes it on drugs. She helps him with directions for a price. He invites her up and hires her for the night. She just doesn't kiss on the mouth. He's in town to do a business deal and hires her for $3000 for the week. The hotel manager Barnard Thompson (Hector Elizondo) takes pity on the girl.Watching it again recently, the prostitution stuff is hopelessly unreal. Of course, it's a fantasy but there are things that are way too broad. Vivian is insanely clueless when she first walks into the hotel. She's probably the first virginal prostitute ever. At least, that's the note that the movie is trying to hit. If it wasn't for Julia Roberts, this would completely collapse. As it turns out, it's a good 'My Fair Lady' rip-off."
The Descent,7,1,6,7 October 2014," great B-movie horror
","Sarah (Shauna Macdonald) loses her husband and daughter in a car crash. One year later, gung ho Juno (Natalie Mendoza) leads the group of female friends to go spelunking in uncharted caves in Chatooga National Park in the Appalachian Mountains. A recovering Sarah is dragged along with Beth (Alex Reid), Rebecca (Saskia Mulder), Sam (MyAnna Buring) and Holly (Nora-Jane No one). Little did they know that there are underground humanoid killers in them caves.The underground work is claustrophobic. The action is clear enough while having great shadows to heighten the unseen. The cannibals look great especially with the movie giving only glimpses at first. This is a great B action horror. There is good gore and good scares to be had. The movie works great once the girls move underground. At that point, the girls don't really have to be distinctive to be good. That is one of the minor problems of the movie. The girls are not unique enough. The movie should have started with the two most important personalities Sarah and Juno. Those two needed better actresses to play them especially Sarah. She has a greater range of emotions to travel. The good news is after the first twenty minutes, none of that really matters. This is simply a scary movie."
Some Like It Hot,9,4,5,4 January 2014," Iconic comedy outstanding for its times
","Joe (Tony Curtis) and Jerry (Jack Lemmon) are musicians in 1929 Chicago. They witness a mob hit, and go on the run with an all girls act on a train to Florida. Then Marilyn Monroe walks by, and movie magic is made.Director Billy Wilder writes some great sharp dialog. Jack Lemmon gives a hilarious performance as he falls for the delicious Marilyn Monroe while fighting off the advances of wealthy Osgood Fielding III. Then he takes a left turn, and it becomes comedy classic. Meanwhile Tony Curtis plays triple roles. And there's nothing better than Marilyn Monroe singing 'I Wanna Be Loved by You'. She's more than her ditsy blonde bombshell persona."
Inside Man,6,2,3,16 June 2014," Spike Lee puts together A-list cast
","Dalton Russell (Clive Owen) talks about a perfect bank robbery from what looks like a prison cell. Police detective Keith Frazier (Denzel Washington), still in the dog house for something, is given the bank robbery. Detective Bill Mitchell (Chiwetel Ejiofor) is his partner. There are hostages. The bank president Arthur Case (Christopher Plummer) has something important in a safe deposit box. He brings in fixer Madeleine White (Jodie Foster). Captain John Darius (Willem Dafoe) is the uniform cop in charge of the crime scene. The robbers seem more interested in the storage room than the bank vault or the deposit boxes.Director Spike Lee is making a stylized robbery. It's wall to wall A-list stars. That's actually distracting to have so many stars scattered in one movie. It takes away from any realism that Spike wants to inject into this movie. Also everything Spike does here is pointing to a surprise reveal. There is teasing, but this is over teasing. Everything is a mystery. Wink! Wink! Again it takes away from any realism. The mysteries are compelling for awhile but it gets tiresome. The reveals are the biggest aspects of this movie. It's a shocking reveal and the jolt is quite enjoyable. But the more one thinks about it, the more problematic it gets. I have questions about the investigation. I have questions about the scheme. The cops should have used a re-enactment to place everybody in their spot. There is also video of the customers before the robbery. The investigation should be able to narrow the suspects much better. Then they should have tailed the suspects. I have questions that don't get answered."
Hoosiers,8,1,1,24 August 2015," traditional underdog sports movie
",It's 1951. Coach Norman Dale (Gene Hackman) arrives in the small Indiana town of Hickory. His old friend Cletus gets him a high school teaching and basketball coaching job. He's a former college coach with a troubled past. Fellow teacher Myra Fleener (Barbara Hershey) is intrigued by the newcomer. The best player Jimmy Chitwood refuses to play after the lost of his beloved coach. Myra looks after Jimmy with his troubled home life and doesn't want him to play. Dale throws out the bossy local coach and a mouthy player in the first practice. They are severely undermanned and he benches a disobedient player despite having only four players on the floor. Shooter Flatch (Dennis Hopper) is a drunken former star player and father to one of the players.This follows the long tradition of the underdog sports movie and builds on it. The story is all cliché and proud of it. Hackman is masterful. Hopper is a great drunk. Hershey is the wearied type and I'm glad that they don't have a 20 year old bright-eyed hottie to play the romantic lead. The movie is earnest to its core and there lies its charms.
Pulp Fiction,10,4,9,18 December 2015," Quentin Tarantino breaks out
",Ringo (Tim Roth) and Yolanda (Amanda Plummer) robs a diner. Vincent Vega (John Travolta) and Jules Winnfield (Samuel L. Jackson) are thugs working for Marsellus Wallace (Ving Rhames). They pick up a mysterious briefcase but an incident requires cleaner the Wolf (Harvey Keitel). Marsellus is paying Butch Coolidge (Bruce Willis) to throw a boxing match. Vincent is told to entertain the bosses' woman Mia (Uma Thurman).This is Quentin Tarantino's big breakout. I saw this in the theater and probably even before 'Reservoir Dogs'. I definitely saw 'True Romance' before this but I had no clue who to praise for the dialog in that movie until I put two and two together. This is a cinematic explosion. Many tried to copy his style but none exceeded him. It is super cool. It's got the time jumble that adds so much fascination to the movie. Again many films try to copy it but few succeeds like this. It has to be one of the iconic movies of the 90s.
Jack Reacher,7,3,7,30 December 2013," Good tense action story
","Barr (Joseph Sikora) is faced with overwhelming evidence of him killing 5 random innocent people in a spree shooting. The only person he asks for is Jack Reacher (Tom Cruise). Jack isn't a friend or a defender. He believes that Barr is guilty. Even his attorney Helen (Rosamund Pike) believes that he's guilty.This is some good tense storytelling. And they've got a pretty great car chase to boot. I love that the chase slows down and takes a pause. I like the tension is allow to built up as he slowly drives down an alley. It isn't just one long constant bang them up chase.If there is a problem , there is a small weakness in either Tom Cruise and/or Jack Reacher. He does this all-knowing pause in every conversation to create tension, but it's an old cliché. There is so much quiet mannerisms in his performance that it's becomes tired. I get that he's the strong and silent type. Sometimes an exposition just need to go quicker. Sometimes he should get it over with. At over 2 hours, it's too long for a relatively simple story. They need to tighten up a lot of dialog to speed things up. And the final fight drags on a little too long. Even with this minor problem, I still consider this one of Tom Cruise's better films lately."

Beth (Melanie Lynskey) secretly likes Jam. When his mother finds their KISS concert tickets in his pocket, she destroys them and transfers him to a Catholic boarding school. The boys win tickets on the radio but it's Detroit radio. They rescue Jam from his school and set off for the radio station. The DJ reveals that Trip hung up before actually getting the tickets. The boys split up and have little more than an hour to get into the concert.The writer Carl V. Dupré seems to be more adapt at horror and that's probably where the problem with this movie starts. Adam Rifkin's directing skills may not be the best either. There are plenty of attempts at slapstick comedy. It's trying to be a rock and roll high school comedy except the comedy part is under-served. It's got the rocking music. The comedy is broad and irreverent. There are a lot of interesting young actors who are capable of doing good work. The strip show is kinda funny. In the end, it's simply not funny enough, at least not consistently funny."

He and his wife Cheryl (Maria Bello) move to McFarland, California with their two daughters. It's a lower class Latino area and the only teaching job he could get. He gets kicked out as assistant football coach in the first week. He notices that some of the kids have potential as runners.Kevin Costner can do the hard angry white guy in his sleep now. There are some pretty interesting young actors among the Latino kids. It's an inspirational based-on-a-true-story. It follows the traditional underdog formula. They have to face the obvious racism and all the expected hurdles. There isn't much drama. There are a few funny moments. There are opportunities to dig a lot deeper. The incident with Julie could be expanded on. Instead the movie does a little before and after. The heart of the incident and the reason for it are never fully explained. There is also the problem of filming running as a sport. The film does it the best that they can but the calculating process makes it less dramatic. This is a perfectly fine sports movie."

Harry gives them a week before his muscle Barry the Baptist takes care of them. They decide to rob their drug dealing neighbor. Meanwhile Barry is looking to steal a priceless antique shotgun but it ends up in the hands of the four friends.This is heavily influenced by Quentin Tarantino and that's not a bad thing. This is Guy Ritchie's full length feature debut. It shows that he has skills but it's not quite as polished as 'Reservoir Dogs'. The accents are quite thick. The comedy doesn't always translate well. However Ritchie has got the style down. This also introduced Jason Statham to the movie world."
Les Misérables,7,1,4,1 November 2013," Sing Talking gets Tiring
","Sing Song Talking gets real tiring. I thought I could take it, but after an hour of Hugh Jackman and Russell Crowe sing talking, it really got on my nerves.Anne Hathaway does one of the most impressive and showiest singing performance. Her Oscar win is well deserved. If only the rest of the movie would stop singing, scenes like Anne's could shine more.The story is a rambling meandering melodrama. Director Tom Hooper really embraced it and took the chance to go all out. I applaud the effort but it's not my kind of movie. Other than the one scene with Anne Hathaway, there isn't anything that is a must see."
Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2,7,0,2,14 October 2017," fun overload
","Peter Quill (Chris Pratt) and his friends; Gamora (Peter Quill), Drax (Dave Bautista), Baby Groot (Vin Diesel), and Rocket (Bradley Cooper), take a job from the Sovereign. They get Gamora's sister prisoner Nebula (Karen Gillan) as payment. When the Sovereign discovers Rocket had stolen from them, they set off to take out the Guardians. The group is saved by a Celestial, Ego (Kurt Russell) who claims to be Peter's father. Meanwhile, Yondu (Michael Rooker) is being ostracized by the other Ravagers and faces a mutinous crew.This is a visual overload of wildly colored space fantasy with unending quips. The first Guardian is refreshing for that idea but it gets a little repetitive with a sequel. The freshest scenes are Nebula's obsessive murderous rage against Gamora, and Baby Groot's inability to get Yondu's hat. There is some heart with Yondu and the sisters. It has some fun but a lot of it feels overloaded. At times, I pine for more of the quieter moments to let the characters deal with their feelings or simply reset my color receptors. Kurt is Kurt and is really perfect as Quill's father. I want the movie to take its time with the emotional turmoil but like a lot of these superhero movies, the pacing has to maintain its freight train momentum. Overall, this is fun but it can't be new again. It expands on the characters but it can't stop to smell the roses."

",Professor Robert Langdon (Tom Hanks) is a symbologist skilled at deciphering and understanding ancient symbols. He is asked to examine clues in a gruesome murder. Soon he discovers that he is a suspect by the French police Captain Fache (Jean Reno). The murder victim's granddaughter Sophie Neveu (Audrey Tautou) goes on the run with Langdon on a continental wide chase to discover clues to the mystery and evils of Opus Dei.Ron Howard tries to wrestle down this convoluted maze of codes and confused motives based on the popular novel. It was a big mistake to have Tom Hanks have that ugly weird long hair. It's a weird mix of puzzles and Bourne action. The large amount of French with subtitle doesn't help the matter. It just doesn't get going well. The good part is the likable Tom Hanks. He keeps the mystery solving on track even though nobody cares after awhile.

She's a wealthy girl destined for a loveless marriage to the hateful Cal Hockley (Billy Zane). He's a wandering artist who won his Titanic ticket in a poker game. He would save her in every way that a person can be saved.I have often railed against the insertion of a love story unnecessarily into a historical event like 'Pearl Harbor'. But I think James Cameron made the right decision here. The story is compelling by itself. Leo has that boyish charm. Kate and Leo has become a legendary Hollywood big screen pairing. This time it works because it's well written, and well acted.There is the great CGI. It's relatively seamless, and ahead of its times. The engine room is magnificent, even better than the boat itself. The iceberg hit was very convincing.Then there is the sinking. For something that is absolutely expected, it still shocks. The suspense of it all holds my attention every time. The last hour of the movie is perhaps one of the most tension filled sequence of all times. It is the incredible CGI as well as the amazing stunts. It marries the real world with the computer world, and have rarely been exceeded even to this day. It is more harrowing than all those 3D superheroes smashing into skyscrapers. For it's iconic status, I have to give this 9/10."
Rocky III,6,1,1,4 July 2014," Cheesetastic Hulk Hogan AND Mr. T
",Rocky Balboa (Sylvester Stallone) is enjoying great success as the defending world champion. His manager Mickey Goldmill (Burgess Meredith) has been picking fighters for him until he is challenged by the arrogant Clubber Lang (Mr. T) at the unveiling of his statue. Lang is exactly the one that Mickey has been avoiding. Rocky not only loses the fight but also Mickey and only Apollo Creed (Carl Weathers) can help him recover from the loses.First Rocky fights Hulk Hogan and then he fights Mr. T. It doesn't get more cheesetastic 80s than that. The story has all the iconic Rocky formula. He is put into an underdog position and he has an insurmountable hurdle to overcome. And Rocky has to have an opponent above all. Mr. T serves that purpose. The movie's big move has to be killing off Mickey and bringing back Apollo as now a good guy. It's a brilliant move. This is a mix of good 80s cheese and a broadly written sports movie.
Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone,8,0,2,21 December 2013," Great chemistry set up for the rest of the series
","Harry Potter is an orphan living with his ignorant uncle and aunt under their stairs. He finds out that he is actually a wizard and there is a secret world out there.This is the first of a series, and it introduces the franchise very well. Some of the style is still a little rough. The CGI isn't top notch, and the sets have some work to do. But those are minor drawbacks in an otherwise superb film.The best part of it must be the great chemistry between the three young leads (Daniel Radcliffe, Emma Watson, Rupert Grint). That is objective number one. With that accomplished, the rest is just icing on the cake. Director Christopher Columbus must be commended for weaving a coherent and compelling story while setting the groundwork for the rest of the franchise. It is tough work, and could easily flounder in less experienced hands."
Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire,7,0,1,22 December 2013," Great tournament action
","This is the fourth in the Harry Potter franchise, and it's under new management once again. This time the director is Mike Newell who did 'Four Weddings and a Funeral'. There is a lot of material to stuff into this one. One of the problem is that the books are getting thicker and thicker. The fourth book is almost three times as long as the first book. A lot of it seems rushed and skipped over.Lord Voldemort supporters called 'Death Eaters' are bolder than ever. They disrupt the Quidditch World Cup Final. When school restarts, Hogwarts holds the Triwizard Tournament pitting three schools against each other.The tournament action is compelling and exciting. That's the heart of this movie. There is more teenage love drama. It's awkward and not in an appealing way. And Ron is downright bipolar in this one. There is a lot of awkward acting going on. It is extremely distressing. I feel whiplashed by the emotional 180s. There are also a lot of side stories trying to be crammed into this. The teenage drama mess aside, this is a good compelling movie."
In Time,6,1,2,1 November 2013," Not pushed far enough
","In the future, science has stopped aging at 25. Everybody is allowed one more year. However there is the ability to transfer your time. Your life becomes currency and you work to earn time. In that way, society has divided into people who live day to day and people who are basically immortal. Will Salas (Justin Timberlake) lives day to day in the ghetto. Rachel Salas (Olivia Wilde) is his mother. One day he rescues a rich Henry Hamilton (Matt Bomer) who is tired of life and leaves him 116 years of time.This is a great sci-fi concept. It's awkward to try to keep track who are older and everybody's relationships. However I feel there's something missing. The concept wasn't exploited enough. Half the time it's trying to explain the world rather than showing you the world. And the 'ghetto' isn't as rough as it ought to be. When the clock ticks down to zero, I can't believe that people aren't going crazy robbing everybody that they can. The idea of an apocalyptic world isn't pushed far enough."
Thor,7,0,1,18 August 2013," Another stepping stone for Marvel
","Against his father King Odin (Anthony Hopkins)'s wish, Thor (Chris Hemsworth) goes to battle the Frost Giants with his brother Loki (Tom Hiddleston), Sif, Volstagg, Fandral, and Hogun. He is cast out of Asgard by Odin. Astrophysicists Dr. Jane Foster (Natalie Portman) and Dr. Erik Selvig (Stellan Skarsgård) with assistant Darcy Lewis (Kat Dennings) are tracking spatial anomalies when they find a disoriented Thor.This is simply setting up for Marvel. They have laid out a series of movie that led to the Avengers and beyond. Kenneth Branagh directs this introduction to Thor. Chris has some work behind him, but this is his international breakout. It lays the groundwork for the world of Asgard and introduces other important characters like Loki. It's not completely compelling. There is a lot of history expositions. The Asgard world is very golden, and the frost giants live on an ice world. The movie goes into a long section in the Alien worlds at the beginning. It's a lot of CGI to slog through. The wonderment of it all wears thin. The love story is rather stiff. Natalie Portman's chemistry with Chris Hemsworth is fair but it could much better. It's a fair introduction and continuation for the grander universe."
Three Colors: Blue,6,1,3,19 June 2015," interesting art-house film
","This is the first of Krzysztof Kieślowski's colors trilogy. Blue is Liberty. Julie de Courcy (Juliette Binoche) survives a car crash which killed her husband Patrice and her daughter. Patrice is a famous composer who was commissioned to produce a piece for European unity. Julie tries to commit suicide and then escape from the glare of her former life. She befriends exotic dancer Lucille. An old friend Olivier is also a composer and suspects the composition is actually Julie's. Patrice had a mistress. Julie has to break out of her darkness. Kieślowski uses everything including color, silence, music and most importantly Binoche infusing this with meaning. This is very much an art-house film and may not be for everyone. The quietness does lower the intensity. It's slow and meticulous. There isn't much of a plot. It's all about Julie's darkness and the reveal that can break through."
The Happening,6,1,3,28 October 2013," Mark Wahlberg weak
","Elliot Moore (Mark Wahlberg) is a high school science teacher. There is a weird science story about bees disappearing. Then suddenly people start killing themselves in bizarre ways. It's a strange phenomenon that causes mass panic. Elliot and his wife Alma (Zooey Deschanel) escape Philadelphia with his friend Julian's (John Leguizamo) young daughter Jess.Everybody should stop dumping on M. Night Shyamalan and judge his movies based on what's on the screen. And what's on the screen has many problems. Mark Wahlberg just can't hold the movie screen. He doesn't project a big enough presence. If he calmed down, he could actually do better than this high school drama level acting.The odd deaths are somewhat distracting. I get that it's a big selling point but it's a silly cartoon. It becomes a matter of how to make dying crazy. I like more the confusion of not knowing. If he held back in the beginning, the deaths would be more profound later in the movie. I like the apocalyptic aspect of the movie but I'm not so much into the explaining and environmental idealism."
Castle in the Sky,6,1,3,8 October 2016," imaginative world
","Sheeta with her crystal manages to escape from pirate Captain Dola and her sons. She falls out of the airship and ends up floating to the ground where she is rescued by young Pazu. Pazu and his community struggles to make a living in the mine. He is obsessed with finding the lost floating city of Laputa. His late father found it once but was ridiculed for it. With pirates and government agents after her, they have to rediscover the power of her crystal and the lost Castle in the Sky.This world is imaginative. The story is a bit muddled. The dialog is a little clunky. The slapstick comedy is broad. I'm not sure that every motivation makes sense. I'm not sure why Dola joins Pazu to help Sheeta. The pirates are shooting up everybody to get the crystal in the beginning and I don't understand why they switch sides. I'm not sure why Pazu was let go especially since he seems to be a great way to control Sheeta. Some of the motivations are confusing but this does have the Ghibli inventiveness."

","It's 1962 Baltimore. Elisa Esposito (Sally Hawkins) is a mute janitor in a military research facility. Her next door neighbor Giles (Richard Jenkins) is a close friend. Zelda Fuller (Octavia Spencer) is her talkative co-worker. Brutal researcher Richard Strickland (Michael Shannon) arrives with an unique water creature.Guillermo del Toro deserves praises for his beautiful work. I would rank this as one of his best films. Sally Hawkins is as endearing as always. Michael Shannon has his intense darkness. It's a great love story between a mute woman and a sea creature. It's sexual, erotic, sweet, and thrilling. It's always great when Guillermo invests real emotions into his visual extravaganza."
The Untouchables,9,5,9,7 May 2014," Near perfection
","It's 1930 Chicago and unofficial mayor Al Capone (Robert De Niro) is holding court. After a bombing that killed a little girl, Treasury Agent Eliot Ness (Kevin Costner) comes in to take down Capone. After a big failed bust, Eliot is guided by beat cop Jim Malone (Sean Connery). They select new recruit Giuseppe Petri (Andy Garcia). Then Agent Oscar Wallace (Charles Martin Smith) comes in with the idea to charge Capone income tax evasion. The four men would battle the murderous Capone and his henchmen as well as a corrupted city.Director Brian De Palma has raise it to a whole new level. The movie looks immaculate. The scene of De Niro circling the table is iconic. It portrays the violence in such a beautiful way. Then there is the staircase scene. It doesn't get any better than that. Everything including the music and the acting are near perfect. Kevin Costner is under-appreciated in this. He holds the whole movie together. Then there are De Niro, Connery, and Garcia. They are all outstanding. This is probably the best movie that De Palma has ever made. Some may complain about accuracy but that never bothered me in this one."
The Godfather: Part III,7,0,0,27 December 2013," Ghost of great movies past
","This starts with a recap of the previous two movies. It's an opening montage indicative of this movie. It's a shadow living off the ghosts of past greatness.It's 1979, the new characters include Mary (Sofia Coppola) daughter of Michael Corleone (Al Pacino), and Vincent Mancini (Andy Garcia) the illegitimate son of Sonny Corleone. Michael is trying to go legit, but the Corleone family crime partner Joey Zasa (Joe Mantegna) is disrespecting Michael. All out fighting breaks out between Vincent and Joey. 'Just when I thought I was out... they pull me back in.' It is the only quote worth quoting.The third generation doesn't have it. Only Andy Garcia has any acting prowess. He has the cockiness of a street punk. Sofia Coppola is just a symbol of the lack of depth in the cast. It's shocking since I would expect that all of Hollywood would be jumping through hoops to get a bit part or some background work in this iconic franchise. Francis Ford Coppola doesn't have anything left in this franchise. Even Pacino looks dried up. Instead of muscle and threats, Michael does business deals. It doesn't have the same power and menace."
The Matrix Reloaded,6,1,1,15 January 2014," Zion Disappointing but Great Car Chase
","It's a little while after The Matrix. Morpheus (Laurence Fishburne) believes that Neo (Keanu Reeves) is the key to defeating the machines. Trinity (Carrie-Anne Moss) is now with Neo. Meanwhile the machines have start digging, and will breach Zion in 72 hours. Also Agent Smith is now free from the code and is even more powerful.It's a good start to the second installment of the series from the Wachowski brothers. There's a ticking clock. It's leading to a big battle. We're going to see Zion for the first time. Agent Smith is even more powerful. But then we get to Zion.Zion is a sweaty mess. And for people with 72 hours to live, these people go have a dance party. Instead of great running battles, the first half is a very, very excruciatingly slow grind. The program world has some interesting ideas, but that also gets too slow at times. There are too many slow expositions. There is generally too much talking and not enough doing.I still love the kung fu fighting. The addition of the twins is quite nice. The first fight against the Agent Smiths is a disappointment. It turns into a CGI video game. That's never been cool in a movie to keep switching from real stunts to CG animation cartoons. Other fights are much better. Even the later fight against the Agent Smiths is pretty good.The best part is the big highway chase. That is an amazing bit of movie-making. It's a super fun time. And I like Colonel Sanders. He's uniquely original. He's certainly memorable.Overall the first half is a major drag. The movie gets better in the second half. It's a disappointing sequel, but still has great sequences."
The Disaster Artist,7,8,11,7 March 2018," funny and compelling
","It's 1998 San Francisco. Greg Sestero (Dave Franco) is a 19 year old kid struggling to act. He is enamored by the uninhibited Tommy Wiseau (James Franco) in class. Tommy convinces Greg to join him in L.A. With no work forthcoming, Tommy writes his own movie, The Room.This is a terrific performance from James Franco. Dave's pretty good too. It's a funny, compelling Hollywood story which turns dark in a few spots. The final ending is a little awkward although functional. I'm not sure if the laughter was that loud in real life. I can see the laughing overwhelmed Tommy in his mind. What it truly needs is a new character who is surprised by the movie and start spreading the word to his friends. I don't need the side by side comparison in the credits. Some of the scenes play better if one has already seen The Room. Obviously, James' troubles ended any hopes for Oscar and probably any future in this movie or even The Room itself. It's a shame because this is actually good."
The Fountain,6,1,2,23 August 2015," beautiful meandering pieces
","Dr. Tom Creo (Hugh Jackman) is a researcher who may have discovered a life extending compound from a tree. His wife Izzi (Rachel Weisz) is dying of cancer. She is writing 'The Fountain', a story of conquistador TomÃ¡s Verde (Hugh Jackman) going to Central America in search of the Tree of Life for Queen Isabella (Rachel Weisz) of Spain. With Izzi on her death bed, the couple imagines space traveler Tommy (Hugh Jackman) in a biosphere with the Tree of Life.Darren Aronofsky has created beautiful chaotic art in pieces. It is visually amazing. If the theme is the transcendence of love, then the movie is fine. There is some religious imagery that could go the wrong way especially with the Mayan holy man. The weaving in and out of flashbacks and flashforwards of the three timelines drains the blood from the body of the movie. It's a beautiful piece of art to look at but not a great story to embrace."
Mystic River,8,0,0,14 November 2015," big time actors in compelling murky mystery
","In 1975 Boston, Jimmy Markum, Dave Boyle and Sean Devine are stopped by a supposed policeman after they mark up the sidewalk. Dave is taken by the two men. He manages to escape after days of sexual abuse. In the present, Dave (Tim Robbins) is a troubled father. Sean (Kevin Bacon) is a police detective whose wife has left him. Ex-criminal Jimmy (Sean Penn) is a father of three. His daughter Katie is found dead. Sean and Whitey Powers (Laurence Fishburne) investigate. Dave was supposedly cut by a mugger that night and his odd behavior starts making him a suspect in the eyes of Jimmy and his friends.These are big time actors here doing crazy good acting. There isn't a weak one in the bunch. The boyfriend could be better but he's a secondary character. Clint Eastwood does his minimalist directing which allows these actors to showcase their natural skills. The movie gets the sense of a place and the feel of compelling characters. It's great."
Zombieland,8,1,3,21 July 2014," Irreverent zombie movie
","Zombies are everywhere. Columbus (Jesse Eisenberg) is a loner and that may be why he is surviving the zombie apocalypse. Also he has come up with a list of rules to live by. On the way to Columbus to find his parents, he gets a ride from zombie killing Tallahassee (Woody Harrelson) who has a Twinkie obsession. He refuses to know anybody's names. The guys gets robbed by sister grifters Wichita (Emma Stone) and Little Rock (Abigail Breslin). They head to an L.A. amusement park that is rumored to be zombie free.It's an irreverent zombie movie in line with 'Shaun of the Dead' except not as much jokiness. Ruben Fleischer, mostly a TV director before this, is able to bring a quirky style to comedy writers Rhett Reese and Paul Wernick. There is a hilarious cameo by Bill Murray. Even the kills are wacky. The four leads are eminently likable. The last act does turn into more of a straight up zombie fight. If the world does turn into Zombieland, I wouldn't mind riding with these four."
It's a Wonderful Life,9,3,6,21 December 2013," Unabashed Sentimental Capra
","George Bailey (James Stewart) is at the edge of financial ruin. He thinks his life has amounted to nothing and is about to jump off a bridge. An angel named Clarence is assigned to give George a second chance by showing him what if he was never born.This is an unabashed sentimental tear jerker. The movie starts with George's life as it is. His dream is to travel the world, and create great monuments. He is constantly dragged back to the unimpressive little Bedford Falls and the family Savings and Loans. He is a good guy who constantly does the right thing.This is classic Frank Capra. The nice guy struggles but always win in the end. This sentimental melodrama is especially fitting for the Christmas period, and derives its iconic status from the constant showing during those times. The failure in its original run is a long forgotten memory."
Enemy at the Gates,8,1,3,7 March 2015," compelling war movie
","It's the fall of 1942. Vassili Zaitsev (Jude Law) grew up hunting with his father in the woods. He, Tania (Rachel Weisz) and countless other untrained recruits are brought up to the front at Stalingrad. He and Commisar Danilov (Joseph Fiennes) survive a suicidal charge. Vassili kills 5 Germans in the aftermath and Danilov writes about him. Nikita Khrushchev (Bob Hoskins) seizes the opportunity to make him a star. Opposing him is the aristocratic German sniper Major König (Ed Harris).The opening is an amazing opera of mass destruction. Then it's a matter of a chess game. It's a fascinating cat and mouse game in the ruins of the city. I'm glad that nobody decided to talk in a fake Russian accent. That would be too distracting. This is a rare good American war movie not about Americans."
A Beautiful Mind,8,1,2,22 February 2014," Russell Crowe proves his acting versatility
","This movie starts in 1947 Princeton where John Nash (Russell Crowe) is trying to start his career. He is not impressed with anybody else there, and searches for an original idea. He is awkward and very peculiar. Then one night at a bar, a tall blonde and her friends walk in. It gives him an idea to overturn Adam Smith's theory. This allows him a placement in the Wheeler Labs in MIT. Years later working at MIT, he meets student Alicia (Jennifer Connelly) who would eventually become his wife, and the mysterious William Parcher (Ed Harris) from the DOD.Russell Crowe has been a leading man for awhile but this one proves once and for all his versatility. He is amazing throughout giving a praise worthy performance. Jennifer Connelly makes a great entrance as she shows her brains as well as her beauty. Director Ron Howard is spot on with this movie. He allows Crowe the space to lead. It's a very human character. It's the best picture Oscar winner for a good reason."
Tenacious D in the Pick of Destiny,6,0,2,4 January 2016," some fun moments
","In Kickapoo, Missouri, JB (Jack Black) grew up as the black sheep in a religious family. He runs away to Hollywood... California. He finds Kyle Gass playing guitar on Venice Beach and he begs to join him. Eventually JB discovers that Kyle is a bald hopeless loser who is supported by his parents. With no money, they decide to form a band named after birth marks on their butts, Tenacious D. They discover that all the great bands have the same guitar pick. It's the Pick of Destiny made from a demon's tooth and presently housed in the Rock and Roll History Museum.Kyle Gass needs to start off a little nicer. Jack Black is good. The duo does build a nice friendship. The quest is a good idea but separating them is not. They work best together. There is some fun but it comes and goes. Also the guys' music is same over and over again. It would be terrific to have a different sound in the movie although the rock battle with the demon is loads of fun. This stoner comedy is funny in small doses."
Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets,7,0,2,21 December 2013," Good continuation but Chris can't quite deliver the knock out punch
","The franchise continues in the second movie in the series. There is a good step upwards in the quality of FX, CGI, and sets. We get introduced to Dobby, the house elf. He's a good CGI character. More importantly, he's a likable character which is so different from a certain Star Wars character who shall not be named. It's a big relief that Dobby is a good success.If there is something missing, it's a darker and scarier Chamber of Secrets. With so much built up, the final section should be a more thrilling and scary ride. It's like a horror movie that doesn't deliver in the end. I think Chris Columbus has reached his limits. It's just not in him to deliver the mood, the thrills, or the scary moments."
Mr. & Mrs. Smith,5,1,4,1 January 2014," Too cool for school
","John (Brad Pitt) and Jane Smith (Angelina Jolie) are both hired assassins. They've been married for 5 or 6 years, and both have kept their real job a secret. Now their marriage is on the rocks, and they're going to counseling.First I always hate watching people do the static therapy sessions. It's a lot of whining from depressed people in an visually boring place. It's ain't exciting like 'One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest'.Aside from the sad depressed home life of these two, there is a lot of cool action coming from two very cool people. It's all very cool. Too cool for school. After a while, the whole idea seems rather tired."
The Departed,8,1,5,1 March 2015," Scorsese's Boston gangster opera
","Frank Costello (Jack Nicholson) is a Boston Irish mobster. He mentors Colin Sullivan (Matt Damon) ever since as a little kid. Eventually Colin joins the Special Investigation Unit in the State Police headed by Captain Queenan (Martin Sheen) and the unpleasant Staff Sergeant Dignam (Mark Wahlberg). He works directly under Captain Ellerby (Alec Baldwin). He begins a relationship with police psychiatrist Madolyn Madden (Vera Farmiga). Billy Costigan (Leonardo DiCaprio) is a new police recruit from a family of lowlife criminals. Queenan and Dignam put him undercover. After serving some time in prison, he works with his petty criminal cousin Sean (Kevin Corrigan) and catches the eye of Sullivan's henchman Mr. French (Ray Winstone).Director Martin Scorsese goes to Boston to film this gangster opera. The cast is second to none. There is great acting being done here. Leo is terrific holding up even against the peacock acting of Nicholson. Winstone is powerfully rough. Damon is twisting his sweet persona into something a bit more of a douche. There is a bit too much plot and sometimes, the movie tries to do too many things. For example, Scorsese doesn't need some of the camera moves or the back and forth editing which only distracts from staying with the plot. It may work even better with a simplified style. This movie is best at its bloody brutal core especially with Leo acting up a storm."
Glory Road,7,0,0,23 December 2015," traditional sports movie
","In 1965 Fort Worth, Texas, Don Haskins (Josh Lucas) coaches high school girls' basketball. He gets recruited and moves his wife Mary (Emily Deschanel) and young kids to Texas Western College in El Paso, Texas. It's a shoestrings program with no ambitions. Nobody wants to sign with the losing team until Don sees a black player named Bobby Joe Hill (Derek Luke). He ignores the unwritten rule of playing one at home, two on the road and three if you're losing. Don starts recruiting both blacks and whites. He insists on coaching traditional basketball. There is racial tension within and outside the team. They overcome many hurdles on their way to reach the NCAA championship.This is the standard sports movie overcoming racial inequality. I guess that can be counted as a negative but it doesn't have to be. This is well-acted with some good characters. It can come off as cliché but all that means is that people keep telling the same story over and over again. There's a reason why storytellers keep going back to the same well. It touches something within our humanity."
Die Hard,9,1,3,17 November 2013," New hero is born
","The world has a new hero. John McClane (Bruce Willis) is a NYPD officer who's come to LA to reconcile with his wife Holly (Bonnie Bedelia). They're at her employer's Christmas party when the building is taken over by German terrorist Hans Gruber (Alan Rickman).John McClane isn't your regular 80s muscle bound superhuman hero. He's the everyman. He bleeds. He suffers. He wisecracks. He can talk in full sentences. He uses his brain as much as his muscles. He's just in the wrong place at the wrong time.The action is big and grandiose. It takes the adage that bigger is better to its limits. Unlike Schwarzenegger and Stallone, the action seems bigger and crazier. Explosions roll off the backs of those muscle heads, but John McClane really suffers. That's the trick."
Psycho,9,3,4,29 November 2013," Hitchcock the master salesman
","Marion Crane (Janet Leigh) steals $40k from work, and runs away. In a stormy night, she stops at the isolated Bates Motel where she meets creepy Norman Bates (Anthony Perkins).This one has Alfred Hitchcock as the master salesman. It's the biggest show in show business, and he's the master of ceremony. He pulls out all the stops like the secrecy and the refusal of entry to late arrivals. It helps to have the most iconic movie scene of all times.Janet Leigh isn't just a damsel in distress or a shrinking violet. She is a woman with a dark side. The fact that she's an A-list star used to mean that she'll last until the end of the movie. When the super creepy Anthony Perkins joins her, it was set up for a prolong creepfest. Then comes the most well made important scene in history. The second half does have a little struggle to reclimb that peak, and I didn't like all the pontificating at the end. But those are tiny problems in a great movie."
American Made,8,0,2,3 April 2018," fun Cruise
","In 1978, Barry Seal (Tom Cruise) is a TWA pilot smuggling cigars into the country. He is recruited by CIA operative 'Schafer' (Domhnall Gleeson). At first, he does surveillance flights over Nicaragua. He's also delivering money to mid level military officer Noriega in Panama. As he and his wife Lucy (Sarah Wright) grow their family, he supplements his income by smuggling drugs for Pablo Escobar. Later, he is pulled into the Contra affair as he diverts guns intended for the Contra to Escobar.This is directed by Doug Liman. Initially, I didn't realize it watching this movie. I was very impressed with the quality of the movie until the credits started to roll. Of course, Liman is no slouch. Honestly, I was expecting a crappy Cruise misfire. In reality, this is quite the opposite. I love Cruise in this roguish role. Knocking out his tooth struck me as extremely hilarious. I love this character better than his need to be loved in many of his leading man roles. The other main part of this movie is the Based on a true story. As most Based movies, there are only slivers of truths. In many ways, it fits Barry Seal well. He's a character of lies and this is a movie of lies. This is a fun romp through a history what if."
Transformers: Revenge of the Fallen,7,4,7,1 January 2014," More of the Same
","Almost everybody has returned for this one. Sam Witwicky (Shia LaBeouf) is going to college. He finds a shard of the AllSpark which has given him visions of symbols. Meanwhile the Autobots are battling the Decepticons with the help of human forces. However, the president's man is unconvinced, and wonder if the Decepticons are on Earth only to hunt the Autobots. And that maybe it would be better if the Autobots leave Earth and lead the Decepticons to follow them.It's good that both Shia and Megan Fox return as well as many of the others. The action is still over the top extravaganza. There're a few too many slow motion for my taste. I'd rather it speed by, and maintain the pace rather than sit there and gawk. But if you like the first one, the second one will give you more of the same. The big thing I don't like is that the Bots seems to be still kept a secret. That's really unreasonable considering what happened in the first movie."
The Witch,7,10,20,15 February 2017," gets very compelling
","It's 17th century New England. Thomasin (Anya Taylor-Joy) lives with her family on an isolated farm. The local village banishes them for religious disagreements. Her parents are strict and God fearing. Her younger brother Caleb has lustful thoughts about her. Her younger twin siblings Mercy and Jonas are obsessed with the family black goat Black Phillip. Thomasin is playing with baby Samuel when he suddenly disappears. A witch in the woods has kidnapped and killed him. The farm is failing and the father is forced to hunt. Thomasin jokes by scaring Mercy about being a witch which comes back to haunt her. Caleb goes into the woods to gather food. Thomasin insists on joining him but it goes badly. Thomasin falls off the horse and Caleb is found in a sickly state.The movie gets really interesting around the midpoint. The first half feels slow and muddled. I had to watch the first half again to get a hold of the entire story. It's a matter of clarity and flow. After Samuel disappears, the family should be out of their minds searching the woods. Instead, the movie skips ahead a few day to them in a depressed state surrendered to the baby's fate. It's missing the emotional and plot connective tissues. The second half is much more intense paying off some story aspects. The lead girl Anya Taylor-Joy is terrific. The brother and the father are also great. This is an intriguing psychological horror."

","Rosemary (Mia Farrow) and struggling actor Guy Woodhouse (John Cassavetes) are a young married couple who move into an old apartment building. Their neighbors are an elderly couple name Roman (Sidney Blackmer) and Minnie Castevet (Ruth Gordon). A young woman named Terry is staying with them. She shows her necklace to Rosemary, a gift from Minnie. Then one night, she jumps out the window in an apparent suicide. There are noises coming through the wall. The Castevets are overly helpful to the Woodhouses. Minnie keeps giving Rosemary things to drink, and she gives the same necklace that she gave Terry. Rosemary has strange erotic dreams, and she finds herself pregnant. She suffers pains and looks sickly. Her doctor Sapirstein does nothing but reassures her. Guy is acting stranger and stranger.This is Roman Polanski's iconic horror classic. It's not a scary movie. It is much more a creepy movie. It's a slow build. At over 2 hours, it takes its time. Mia Farrow puts in an iconic performance, and it's not simply because of her haircut. She projects a very fitting fragility physically but also mentally. Her powerlessness is at the center of the movie, and that's where the power of the movie comes from."
Jersey Boys,5,4,6,17 April 2015," lifeless drama
","It's 1951 Belleville, New Jersey. Tommy DeVito is a hustler. Frankie Valli is the sweet front man with the angelic voice. Along with Tommy's brother Nicky, they are the Variety Trio. They try to steal a safe and get caught. The DeVitos take the fall for Frankie. Everybody takes it easy on Frankie as the DeVitos go in and out of prison. Connected guy Gyp DeCarlo (Christopher Walken) loves Frankie's singing and watches out for him. Frankie marries brassy girl Mary Delgado. The actor Joe Pesci introduces singer songwriter Bob Gaudio to the group. With Nick Massi, the group is eventually named 'The Four Seasons' as they climb the charts.The biggest problem is the lack of charisma from the leads. They don't have the special personality to break out of the screen. Honestly, it's too easy for them to fade into the background. I'd rather not have the singing ability and have somebody with stronger screen presences. The most memorable part of the movie is stealing the safe. There is a general lifelessness about the movie. Some people may overlook everything for the music or the play. The split between Frankie and Tommy is probably the most compelling part of the plot. The movie should have zero in on that relationship like a laser beam."
When Harry Met Sally...,9,1,1,24 September 2013," Iconic rom-com
","Sally (Meg Ryan) gives Harry (Billy Crystal) a ride to New York after they both graduate from the University of Chicago. They have a spirited and cantankerous debate. They keep bumping into each other over the years until finally they have to decide whether they can just be friends, or if they can be more.Written by Nora Ephron and directed by Rob Reiner, this has become the flag bearer for modern rom-coms. This movie asks one big question. Can a man and a woman just be friends? It has some of the most iconic scenes of all times, and none is bigger than the fake orgasm scene. Billy Crystal is quick and smart. It shows on screen and gives reason to why Sally would fall for Harry. At the time, Meg Ryan is about to start her rein as the rom-com queen. She is at maximum cuteness, and quick enough to play with Billy Crystal and Rob Reiner."
The Holiday,7,0,2,30 November 2013," Twice the rom-com
","Iris Simpkins (Kate Winslet) is a pushover for her ex (Rufus Sewell) and she's blindsided by his engagement. Amanda Woods (Cameron Diaz) is tired of her cheating boyfriend (Edward Burns) and leaves her LA life for a few weeks. They use a vacation website to chat up a home exchange. During their vacation, they each fall for their own local guys.It's a double rom-com. Jack Black is trying to be a romantic lead. He and Winslet make an odd couple. She's absolutely charming. He's not himself, and Eli Wallach is better as the lead. Jude Law is a more conventional choice for a leading man. He and Diaz work well together.It's an unabashed chick flick. It does exactly what you expect it to do. It just does it twice. It explains the running time of over 2 hours. It's kinda corny and kinda formulaic, but it has its heart in the right place."
Zero Dark Thirty,8,11,22,2 November 2013," Shocked how real the raid look
","Maya (Jessica Chastain) is a CIA analyst who won't rest from the hunt fro Bin Laden. Director Kathryn Bigelow has followed the hunt from 9-11 to the tension filled raid in Abbottabad, Pakistan. The movie is based on the true events. There is a relevant question of how true to the events is the movie. Unlike most movies, this is actually an important question.Most of us have no hope of knowing the true facts that actually happened. This movie is certainly a possible reality. Some of it is probably wrong. They've probably changed some of it to not reveal CIA trade craft. Others looks different than what's been reported on the news. However it is overall following the story already laid out for the public.The hunt for Bin Laden can meander and not follow a straight line. It doesn't really built like a normal movie. Bigelow is still able to maintain the tension throughout the movie. The last 40 minutes is where this movie truly excels. The raid in Abbottabad is incredibly tense. The Hollywood flashiness is mostly removed. It takes its time. It's done almost in real time. It has the intensity of realism. It's shocking how real the raid looked."
Steve Jobs,7,0,0,10 May 2016," great performances
","This biopic of Steve Jobs (Michael Fassbender) centers on three product launches; Apple Macintosh in 1984, NeXT Computer in 1988, and iMac in 1998. Joanna Hoffman (Kate Winslet) is his ever-present right-hand man. John Sculley (Jeff Daniels) is his father figure and CEO of Apple. Steve Wozniak (Seth Rogen) is always vying for acknowledgment of the Apple II. Chrisann Brennan (Katherine Waterston) is the mother of Jobs' daughter Lisa. Reporter Joel Pforzheimer follows him throughout.These are all very interesting performances. Fassbender, Winslet, and Daniels all deliver. Seth Rogen is surprisingly good in a non-comedic role. Waterston is terrific as the baby mama. There is no denying that Aaron Sorkin knows how to write unique dialog but it feels non-real. I believe that this would be one of the best movies of the year if it's about Stephen Jet. Sorkin has written some of the greatest work around like West Wing, Newsroom, and others. They all have a superior to reality feel. This is altered realism but I think everybody is more interested in the actual truth. There are some great scenes. There are big scenes. This is a perfect creation."
Crazy Heart,8,1,1,20 May 2015," Jeff Bridges perfect
",Bad Blake (Jeff Bridges) is a drunk broke country singer whose best days are in the past. Jean Craddock (Maggie Gyllenhaal) is a journalist doing an in-depth piece on the old legend. They open up to each other and start a relationship. He tries to get his life together. He talks to star Tommy Sweet (Colin Farrell) who was once his mentors. Everybody wants him to write new songs but he hasn't written anything in three years.This movie is simply living off of Jeff Bridges' natural performance. He is absolutely perfect for this role. He is touching and compelling. Gyllenhaal is good. Colin Farrell surprises with a great cameo. Their scene together is so wonderful. The story is rather thin and moves at a leisurely pace. There is a lot of country music. It's an easy comforting journey.
War of the Worlds,6,1,4,9 January 2014," Great CGI but there are problems
","Ray Ferrier (Tom Cruise) is a divorced father with daughter Rachel (Dakota Fanning) and angry teenager Robbie (Justin Chatwin). Then a strange storm appears with numerous intense lightning. Suddenly machines rise out of the ground to destroy mankind.Director Steven Spielberg uses all his tech skills to create great CGI of this H.G. Wells vision. It looks great. There are great individual scenes like the train. Tom Cruise is good as a father looking out for his family. But a couple of things keep coming back to nag at me. The kids are a bit too much to take. I'm willing to take Dakota Fanning screaming at everything, but I can't take the annoying rebellious teen. The constant fighting with the father is so petty and so childish. The family melodrama just diminishes the scale of the movie. Then there is the change of the origins of the alien machines. It is simply a stupid idea from Spielberg to be different. There is no reason for it. Worst it makes the movie questionable. And the blood idea just adds to the silliness of the story. These are changes for the sake of changing without improving anything."
Mudbound,7,2,6,2 March 2018," slow first half and compelling second half
","Henry McAllan (Jason Clarke) and his long suffering wife Laura (Carey Mulligan) with their kids live on his father Pappy (Jonathan Banks)'s dirt poor Mississippi farm. His brother Jamie (Garrett Hedlund) returns from the war as a bomber pilot. The Jacksons (Rob Morgan, Mary J. Blige) have worked for the family. Their son Ronsel Jackson (Jason Mitchell) also returns from the war.The inciting incident happens midway through the movie. It needs to happen sooner. The first half meanders too much leaving the movie with a grinding pace. The second half of this over two hours movie is much more compelling as the characters' relationships are expanded. The friendship between Ronsel and Jamie is the heart and the soul of this movie which only arises after the incident. There is some muddy beauty in the cinematography. It is effective work from filmmaker Dee Rees."
Hercules,6,0,1,2 September 2018," second tier Disney
","After imprisoning the Titans, Zeus and Hera have their son Hercules. Zeus' brother Hades in the underworld plans to overthrow Zeus by freeing the Titans. However, he must stop Hercules before growing up and his fate to stop the release. He sends his evil minions Pain and Panic to steal baby Hercules and feed him a potion to make him mortal. The baby fails to drink every last drop and he's adopted by a kindly farmer couple. Hercules grows up to be a bumbling part-mortal trying to control his powers. After yet another accident, he is banished from his home. Along the way, he is befriended by Pegasus sent by Zeus and recruits trainer Phil. He is joined by femme fatale Meg who had actually sold her soul to Hades. With Pain and Panic, she sets Hercules to Hades' impossible labors.This is second tier Disney animation. It is really a referential cartoon at heart. It tries very hard to be irreverent. I'm not sure about making young Hercules a bumbling teen. Setting him young does detract from any chemistry with Meg. He's a child while she's all woman. The movie mixes the origins of Superman with the classic Greek. Seeing how Superman steals from Hercules, it's par for the course. The only truly great character is Hades. He is deliciously evil. The songs are relatively forgettable. Despite being second tier, it is still very much Disney and has an overall competence."
All Quiet on the Western Front,10,3,4,2 February 2015," One of the great anti-war movie
","Early in the war, Germany is winning and everybody is eager to fight. A group of schoolboys are rallied by their jingoistic teacher to be the Iron Youth of Germany. They are trained by the hardened Himmelstoss. At the front, they find the war to be an ugly, muddy affair. Death and war is not the glory that they were looking for. The young Paul Bäumer struggles to save a french soldier after stabbing him. He returns home to confront his teacher. Then he ends in the horrors of the frontlines.This is one of the great anti-war movie stemming from the first World War. It is heightened by the fact that the movie follows the German soldiers as if there is no difference in the war experience. It takes away the easy patriotism and jingo slogans. There is the great machine gun scene where soldiers are mow down like wheat. It hits the ugliness and the pointlessness of war hard. Also it's simply a well made film."
Love Actually,5,2,4,14 December 2013," Sometimes good but too many insipid stories
","It's a multi-storyline movie about love. It opens on an airport arrival. It's a promising start. At least, it's a rare place to start, and it's a great place for love and reunion. Then it goes on to talk about 9-11. The calls from the people are almost always one of love rather than hate. It's a heighten call to action for a simple rom-com. They want to show that love is most powerful emotion.I like some of the stories. Mostly I found them formulaic and nothing original. However I am profoundly distracted by Hugh Grant as the bachelor Prime Minister. He is still playing the same character as his other movies which makes the Prime Minister too silly. For a movie with such a vast cast, there must be somebody more fitting to be the PM.The saddest thing about this movie is that it may have inspired more of these multi-storyline love stories. Only they are getting more and more insipid. If a love story is good enough, it should be able to fill a whole movie."
12 Years a Slave,9,1,3,6 September 2014," Impressive and compelling
","Solomon Northup (Chiwetel Ejiofor) is a free black family man living in Saratoga, New York. In 1841, he is lured by two men who hire him to play his violin. When they arrive in Washington, he is abducted and given the false identity of a runaway slave. He is smuggled back into the deep south to be sold to the somewhat kind William Ford (Benedict Cumberbatch). However he runs afoul of the jealous chief carpenter John Tibeats (Paul Dano) and Ford sells him to the cruel Edwin Epps (Michael Fassbender). Patsey (Lupita Nyong'o) is the best cotton picker and she's constantly raped by Epps. His wife (Sarah Paulson) knows it and targets her anger on the helpless slave. It's a dangerous life and Northup must hide his identity from everyone. It's only until Canadian Bass (Brad Pitt) that he can truly rely on somebody to help him.This is more than a slave movie. The fact that this is an educated man forced into slavery puts it closer to the audience. It's easier to see one's self in the Northup character in that he starts off as a regular family guy. His trials and tribulations are more compelling because of it. The performance of Chiwetel Ejiofor just reinforces that idea. He's not a superhero. He struggles. He's afraid. He's just a guy off the streets. The other performances are just as outstanding. Each one is as impressive as the next. Brad Pitt does stick out a little and I wish a smaller actor could play the part. This is the most impressive movie I've seen from Steve McQueen."
Nick and Norah's Infinite Playlist,8,1,1,8 September 2013," Wacky night of rom-com
","Nick (Michael Cera) is obsessively in love with Tris (Alexis Dziena). She rejects him utterly and shows up at Nick's band performance with another guy. Norah (Kat Dennings) knows Tris but have never met Nick even though she loves his music. So when Norah needs a fake boyfriend for 5 minutes to show off to Tris, she grabs Nick. What follows is a night of adventures to rescue Norah's drunken friend Caroline (Ari Graynor), search for a secret show of their favorite indie band in Manhattan, and escape from the jealous crazed ex Tris.Michael Cera and Kat Dennings didn't have the best chemistry at the start mostly due to his obsession with Tris. Luckily Ari Graynor was able to keep the movie going with her wacky drunk act. The group of actors seem to have a lot of fun. That fun is definitely transmitted onto the screen as great camaraderie. The movie is full of lovely moments, and great music. Cera and Dennings do have better chemistry as the movie goes on."
30 Days of Night,7,1,2,11 January 2014," Good moody atmosphere
","Every year Barrow, Alaska has a mass exodus as it starts a period of 30 days without sunshine. Sheriff Eben Oleson (Josh Hartnett) finds a lot of strange things happening. His ex Stella (Melissa George) misses the last flight out of town. Then they arrest a mysterious drifter (Ben Foster) right before an invasion of deadly vampires.This starts slowly, but there is a moody atmosphere building. The cold isolation works great as a way to ramp up the tension. The premise is something new for the vampire genre. I like the originality. The style also has a good look to it. The acting is pretty good for a horror movie. Ben Foster has the most interesting role. Josh Hartnett gets the leading man role. It's a good horror movie with something different."
Sausage Party,6,0,2,17 December 2016," imaginative obscenity
","Shopwell's Grocery Store has all the products. Unknown to the humans, the products are alive. They believe that people are Gods. When they get picked, they go out to the heaven-like Great Beyond. Frank Wienerton (Seth Rogen) is a wiener and Brenda Bunson (Kristen Wiig) is a hot dog bun. They are overjoyed to be picked but they fall out of the shopping cart. With Kareem Abdul Lavash (David Krumholtz) and Sammy Bagel Jr. (Edward Norton), they go in search for the truth. They are joined by Teresa del Taco (Salma Hayek) and hunted by the evil Douche (Nick Kroll). Meanwhile, deformed sausage Barry (Michael Cera) arrives in the kitchen and discovers the true nature of the Great Beyond.There is no arguing that this is imaginative and obscene. It gets full marks for being ridiculously childish and high satire at the same time. Its originality wears thin after awhile. I think it has a lot to do with the constant swearing. It never stops and everybody does it. There is a childish glee that is derived from it at first but it becomes a crutch for the humor. I also would have liked for the group to stay together. There is so much wackiness that any additional chaos is not necessarily welcomed. Instead of being involved, I do fall out of the story until the over-the-top party in the end."
Wedding Crashers,7,0,0,4 October 2013," Owen Wilson and Vince Vaughn perfect together
","John Beckwith (Owen Wilson) and Jeremy Grey (Vince Vaughn) are business partners and best friends. They have a unique scheme to crash weddings and bed unsuspecting young hot women. When they crash the wedding of the season, John falls completely for bridesmaid Claire Cleary (Rachel McAdams) breaking all the rules. Jeremy must submit to her sex-crazed sister Gloria Cleary (Isla Fisher) as his loyal wingman.The concept is great. Some of the jokes work but some really don't. This movie rises with the guys' chemistry. Vaugh's got the manic rantings, and Wilson's got the boy next door charm. Together they form the perfect bromance. And that is the big takeaway from this movie."
There Will Be Blood,7,1,3,18 January 2016," beautiful ugly
","Daniel Plainview (Daniel Day-Lewis) is a driven hard-scrabbled miner and prospector. In 1902, he discovers oil in California. A worker dies in an accident and he adopts the man's baby. He promotes himself as a family man with his son H.W. and a sincere oilman. Paul Sunday (Paul Dano) sells him information about oil on his family's farm. Paul's twin Eli doesn't trust him and is driven for his church. Daniel acquires the rights from everybody except hold-out William Bandy. As the oil flows, Daniel and Eli become bitter rivals and blood starts to run.This is a slow-moving epic driven by a relentlessly intense performance by Daniel Day-Lewis. This movie is infused with his sense of menace and a self-assured intensity. Paul Dano has his weird creepiness. Paul Thomas Anderson creates a completely immersive world filled with hard characters. It is absolutely beautiful and stark with its offkey scores. There are scenes of perfect beautiful ugliness. The movie explodes in intensity from time to time but mostly it has a tone of menace and stress. I like it but I would like it more if it moves faster. This has the look of greatness, and the sense of greatness. It is close to greatness but I wish I like more."
Ice Age,7,1,1,24 November 2013," Good group chemistry
","Manfred (Ray Romano) is a mammoth who is alone in the world. Sid (John Leguizamo) is a sloth who annoys everybody and is left behind. A group of sabertooth tigers want revenge on a human tribe. They try to steal a baby but Sid and Manfred rescue him. Diego (Denis Leary) is a sabertooth tiger sent to track down the baby, but he must decide which side he's on.Sid and Manfred have a great bromance. Leguizamo is especially funny as the annoying sloth. Manfred is always bothered by Sid's antics. Diego starts off with questionable motives, but eventually the three form their own special herd.This is much more for the smaller kids. There isn't the constant modern referencing. But the animal cartoons are fun. Sid is especially funny. They are an enjoyable group and an enjoyable movie."
Burlesque,5,2,4,22 December 2014," no originality, even the song and dance get repetitive
","Ali Rose (Christina Aguilera) leaves her small Iowa town waitress job for the lights of L.A. Tess (Cher) is the owner of the Burlesque Lounge. She struggles to keep the aging venue going. Ali hires herself as the new waitress. Alexis (Alan Cumming), Sean (Stanley Tucci) and bartender Jack Miller (Cam Gigandet) work there. Ali gets kicked out and stays with Jack thinking he's gay. It turns out that he's engaged to Natalie (Dianna Agron) who is away in a NY play. Vince Scali (Peter Gallagher) is Tess' ex-husband who owns half of the club. Nikki (Kristen Bell) is the club's diva star. Georgia (Julianne Hough) is looking to replace her as the star. Real estate guy Marcus Gerber (Eric Dane) is dating Nikki and trying to buy the club from Tess.Aguilera is too old to play the young innocent thing who comes into town. The story is older than Cher. It has no originality at all. The song and dance is fun for a little while. Aguilera knows how to sing and even Kristen Bell does a good job. However all the performance are too similar and they wear thin really quickly. They get repetitive and boring. I don't mind Aguilera's acting although she's not winning any awards any time soon. She has charisma and that's a good start."
Joker,8,4,8,26 November 2019," great character work
","Gotham is in dire difficulties like New York City back in the 70's. Arthur Fleck (Joaquin Phoenix) is a mentally unstable clown. He laughs uncontrollably in stressful times. He gets beaten and robbed by a group of youths. He gets fired from his job. He lives with his unstable sick mom (Frances Conroy) who worked for Thomas Wayne and claims him to be her ex-lover and Arthur's biological father. When Arthur is attacked by three drunken suits in the subway, he shoots them dead. Thomas Wayne is outraged by the killing of these three well-educated pillars of society and announces his campaign for the mayor's office. Arthur has a relationship with his single-mom neighbor Sophie Dumond (Zazie Beetz) and admires talk show host Murray Franklin (Robert De Niro).This is great character work from Joaquin Phoenix. He is one of the great actors working today. Director Todd Phillips is pounding his chest a lot and deserves some praise. I do have a couple of problems with his work. The smaller problem is the continuous shooting of Thomas Wayne and Martha Wayne with her pearls. That scene has been done so many times in the past three decades. It may be better to simply suggest it with a clown walking into the alley with a gun. Don't show the shooting. Just do the sound of the shot and leave. It's all been done before and Phillips should know this. The bigger issue is setting up this world. I think Phillips expected that the audience knows this world as a given. The streets have lots of garbage. There are news reports. Phillips fails to spell it out especially if income inequality is such a big theme in the movie. It needs a Wall Street protest or two. At least, there should be a protest in front of Wayne Tower. The first clown protest against Wayne seems to come out of nowhere. The hatred of the rich needs some background. Overall, this is a great new needed voice in the comic book superhero genre which presents ground to build a new franchise on."
To Kill a Mockingbird,10,1,3,22 February 2014," American Classic
","Based on Harper Lee's Pulitzer Prize winning book, Scout (Mary Badham) is a 6 year old girl living in Maycomb, Alabama during the 1930s. It's a tired old town life with his lawyer father Atticus Finch (Gregory Peck) and his little brother Jem. Then Atticus takes a case to defend a black man Tom Robinson accused of raping a white teen girl Mayella Ewell. It sends the town into a frenzy which only Atticus and the innocence of Scout are able to withstand.It's an American classic. Gregory Peck exudes stature, compassion and dignity. It takes an important book and honors it with an impressive film. The trick of the movie is to look at the issue of race through the eyes of Scout. It also features Robert Duvall as the iconic Boo Radley. There is one point in the movie after the trial is over that always gets me. As Atticus walks out of the courtroom, all the blacks in the balcony stand up. Reverend Sykes tells Scout to stand. 'Miss Jean Louise. Miss Jean Louise, stand up. Your father's passing.' There is something so poignant and so overwhelming about that moment."

Shears (William Holden) is an American who has a dim view of the whole war after losing most of his men in the camp. Colonel Nicholson (Alec Guinness) is the highest ranking British officer who leads his men into the camp. He insists on maintaining the Geneva Conventions and refuses to entertain escape. Saito orders the prisoner to build a bridge. It's a struggle between Saito and Nicholson for his limited control about whether officers can be forced to do manual labor. The bridge building is not going well with the men working half-heartedly and sabotage. Finally Saito agrees to give Nicholson command as he task his men to build the best bridge possible. Meanwhile Shears manages to escape the camp. He is blackmailed to guide a demolition squad back to blow up the bridge.Alec Guinness is truly great in his performance. He is stubborn and principled. The problem is that his principles does nothing but drive him to help the Japanese and into madness. His foil Saito is just as mad. All of it culminates into one of the most compelling scene of Nicholson's breakdown.
A Hard Day's Night,9,1,2,15 November 2014," Simply fun
","The Beatles (John Lennon, Paul McCartney, George Harrison and Ringo Starr) are traveling from Liverpool to London for a TV performance. They bring along Paul's grandfather as well as their various entourage on the trip as they have fun misadventures.This is simply fun and its success suggests the coming marriage of pop music and video imagery. The dry British humor is fun and it's all about the lads' charm. They sell the material better than any experienced actors. They seem to be really enjoying themselves. In that sense, director Richard Lester is lucky and he's also smart enough to let them go at it. And the music is so great. It is a pop icon of the 20th century."
Man on Fire,6,1,3,25 November 2013," Too long
","John Creasy (Denzel Washington) is a drunk and an expert at dark ops. An old friend Paul Rayburn (Christopher Walken) brings him to Mexico City where there's a wave of kidnappings. He's hired by the Ramos family (Marc Anthony, Radha Mitchell, Dakota Fanning) as their driver and security. When the girl is kidnapped and the ransom is botched, he becomes a man on fire.Tony Scott has all the skills of a great action director. He wants to built up Creasy's relationship with LuPita so that it becomes reasonable for him to react that way. He wants Creasy to love LuPita. I'm not opposed but it takes too long. There's got to be a better shorthand or there has to be more interesting insights. At almost 2 and a half hours, it could easily lose 30 minutes. Scott has thrown every camera tricks into the action in the 2nd half. It becomes quite mind numbing. This too could stand to be trimmed. All of it is too long for a fairly simple vengeance movie. It's really an hour and a half movie stretched out for an unnecessary extra hour."

The prison thinks he's faking to get out of work details. Inside the mental institution, he finds a whole range of people with disorders, and one controlling Nurse Ratched (Louise Fletcher).Jack Nicholson is a rebellious man who's itching to break out of the oppressive dictatorship of nurse Ratched. Louise Fletcher is completely cold hearted, and projects great interior anger. It's all on her face. This is a movie of great performances from everybody. It's not just Nicholson and Fletcher. Everybody is spot on. There isn't a false note being struck."

After 5 years of relentless defeats where the Mimics seem to anticipate every move, the United Defense Force finally has a victory with the invention of a new jacket technology. Rita Vrataski (Emily Blunt) is hailed as an example of the new success. William Cage (Tom Cruise) is a military media officer. General Brigham (Brendan Gleeson) is sending him on the first wave to cover the expected victory. He is arrested and forced to fight under Master Sergeant Farell (Bill Paxton). He manages to kill a large Mimic. He is sprayed with its blood and dies. He wakes up the previous morning as a prisoner about to go into battle.The action is fantastic. The idea is terrific. Tom Cruise starts as his arrogant stock character and transition into his superhero stock character. Emily Blunt continues to excel in a character reminiscent of her character in Looper. Everything comes together. This is funny and exciting. Doug Liman puts it all together into a great thrilling ride."

",The three-time champs Barden Bellas has an embarrassing incident when Fat Amy (Rebel Wilson) flashes the audience during a performance for the President. They face punishment and replaced on the tour by the German Das Sound Machine. Beca (Anna Kendrick) starts an internship with a record producer (Keegan-Michael Key) keeping it a secret from the Bellas. Chloe (Brittany Snow) is more driven than ever before. Emily Junk (Hailee Steinfeld) is a legacy and joins the group. They vow to win the World Championship to regain their standing.I really like the first movie. The girls are lovable. Their friendship is charming. There is just the right amount of humor. This one has made a few changes. Adding Hailee Steinfeld is nice. Elizabeth Banks' directing skills are functional. The girls remain charming. I personally like Rebel Wilson although there may be too much of her in this one. The problem is that the humor seems dumber. I don't mean it's simply broader and more coarse. I mean it seems stupider and less well written. The whole movie feels like a step down.

Traudl is still working for Hitler in his bunker. Children are manning the guns. Hitler is giving unrealistic orders to undermanned overwhelmed units. It's the last days of the Third Reich.This is a compelling telling of the last days of Hitler. He's a feared mad man, delusional, and a human being. It also has other characters inside and outside of the bunker. There are battles but they're not done for excitement. It's really about the varying cast of characters dealing with the impending end their own different ways."

Simmons gets a great juicy part to show his skills that he has shown all these years. He fully deserves his Oscar win and it's not a surprise. He's certainly done great work in many TV and movie roles before over the years. Miles Teller take a great step up. He has done good work but this is something much more. It's a compelling character who develops and changes. He's able to play through it all.

It is a drug-filled, stripper-strutting, midget-throwing wild-partying office. Jordan has an affair with Naomi Lapaglia (Margot Robbie) and eventually even marrying her. However the high life doesn't last even with their own Swiss banker.This has some funny moments and sometimes even gut busting hilarity. I do have a small problem trying to enjoy this movie at the start. Jordan becomes essentially a con man. The joke is that they're having all this fun but I can never forget that the fun is done on everybody else's dime. The characters laugh while I cringe. About halfway through, I do get acclimatized and feel more at ease with the movie. There are some great scenes. The scene of Jordan rallying the troops for the Steve Madden IPO is amazing. Leo gives a full-out performance."
Army of Darkness,8,2,3,20 August 2015," hilarious and fun action
",Ash Williams (Bruce Campbell) used to be an S-Mart employee with girlfriend Linda. They go to a cabin in the woods and Ash is pulled into a vortex and lands in the middle ages. He is taken prisoner along with Henry the Red by Arthur's men. He is thrown into the pit with the evil dead. Wiseman sends down his chainsaw and he uses it to defeat them. He becomes a feared hero and sets Henry and his men free. Sheila (Embeth Davidtz) hopes that he would battle the evil but Ash only wants to go home. He needs to quest for the book Necronomicon to return home.This is a fun romp of a medieval horror misadventure. Sam Raimi is having fun and Bruce Campbell is the guy to deliver it. The over-confident irreverent Ash is hilarious. It's both a great comedy and a fun action adventure.
The Last King of Scotland,7,1,2,4 September 2015," the excellent Forest Whitaker
","It's 1970. Nicholas Garrigan (James McAvoy) is a recent University of Edinburgh medical graduate who hates his dull prospects at home. He picks Uganda at random and dives in with both feet. He joins a clinic run by Dr. David Merrit (Adam Kotz) and his wife Sarah (Gillian Anderson). The country comes out of chaos under Idi Amin (Forest Whitaker). Nicholas is taken to treat Idi Amin after a minor car crash. Idi Amin loves Scotland and takes a liking to him.I don't like Nicholas as a character. He rubs me the wrong way for some reason. He is arrogantly clueless which is the purview of the young. Other than that, this is a fine film. The performance from Forest Whitaker is especially excellent. He plays both the lovely charmer and the violent brute."
Scream 2,6,0,1,14 June 2014," Sequel references gives franchise some new life
","Two years after the first movie. Gale Weathers (Courteney Cox) has written a book about the murders and it's been popularized in the movie Stab. A new Ghostface rises up to start killing again at a showing of Stab. Cotton Weary (Liev Schreiber) is out of prison with the help of Gale. Gale is too happy to soak up all the publicity. Sidney Prescott (Neve Campbell) and Randy Meeks (Jamie Kennedy) are students at Windsor College. Derek (Jerry O'Connell) is Sidney's new boyfriend. Dewey Riley (David Arquette) comes out to protect Sidney. There is a whole new cast of characters ready for the killing and ready to be suspects.Wes Craven and Kevin Williamson have return to the self-referencing franchise. Being a sequel, there are a lot of referencing to sequels and what that usually entails. It gives the franchise a new reason to continue. The returning cast is a capable crew. I do have a minor problem with the new additions. They all end up as either cannon fodder or the killers. It would be much more surprising if one of the new people survives."
Bram Stoker's Dracula,7,3,3,27 October 2013," Lavish style covers some deficiencies
","It's 1897 and it's been 400 years since he lost his beloved Elisabeta (Winona Ryder). Young lawyer Jonathan Harker (Keanu Reeves) travels to do business with Dracula in Transylvania, but is imprisoned by the Count. Dracula travels to London to seduce Harker's fiancée Mina Murray(also played by Winona Ryder).Gary Oldman is deliciously evil but Keanu Reeves is well overmatched by his acting counterpart. Winona Ryder is pretty but her role desperately need her sexuality. Director Francis Ford Coppola has created one of the most beautiful lavish Gothic film. It is erotic but it isn't sexy.The movie looks amazing but it lacks the pace, the tension, and worst of all, it lacks the scares that a real Dracula horror should deliver. Coppola has built a beautiful piece of art, but not a great piece of story."
Die Hard with a Vengeance,6,1,2,17 November 2013," Feels like a different franchise
","John McClane (Bruce Willis) has fallen on hard times. A bomber (Jeremy Irons) demands that McClane play a game and the NYPD recalls him back to work. In one game, he's helped by a good Samaritan Zeus (Samuel L. Jackson). The two go off on a high intensity scavenger hunt.The fact that he's called in by name means that this one veers off from the formula from the start. The first two had him alone in the wrong place at the wrong time surprising the bad guys. This one he's paired up, demanded by the bad guy to play a game running across NY. It feels like a different franchise. Where's the family? They've thrown out the formula.Director John McTiernan returns to do a big action extravaganza. He follows the rule of sequels by making a bigger movie. Jeremy Irons is a great bad guy, but I would prefer Bruce Willis to be a lone wolf. Nevertheless Sam Jackson is always a great choice. If this wasn't a Die Hard movie, it would be just another brainless action thriller."
Con Air,7,6,8,17 May 2015," so ridiculous that it's kind of fun
","Cameron Poe (Nicolas Cage) is released from the Army Rangers and reunited with his pregnant wife (Monica Potter). He is challenged by 3 drunks outside of a bar and kills one. He is sentenced to 7 to 10 years in prison. He gets paroled and he's hitching a plane ride until his release. The plane has his friend cellmate Baby-O (Mykelti Williamson) as well as many dangerous supermax prisoners on their way to a new prison. Vince Larkin (John Cusack) is overseeing the transfer with DEA wildman Duncan Malloy (Colm Meaney) running a sting on a drug lord. Malloy sneaks a gun with his undercover agent onto the plane. Cyrus 'The Virus' Grissom (John Malkovich) masterminds an escape plan with Pinball (Dave Chappelle) stealing the keys from Guard Sally Bishop (Rachel Ticotin). Diamond Dog (Ving Rhames) is a militant black prisoner. This is an over-the-top ridiculous cartoon action thriller. One has to leave all reasonable logic behind. There is a lot of unnecessary overacting by Meaney. With all the great action, the movie should be a lot more thrilling and intense. The jokey irreverent feel makes it less intense. After awhile, it's not about the plot or whether Baby-O gets the help. It's what other ridiculous things are they going to pull. I have to roll my eyes when Steve Buscemi arrives as Hannibal Lecter. However it is so ridiculous that it's kind of fun."
August Rush,6,0,3,21 September 2013," Creepy Robin Williams ruins a great movie
","Lyla Novacek (Keri Russell) is a renowned cellist performing in big concert halls. Louis Connelly (Jonathan Rhys Meyers) is a guitar player and vocalist rocking it out. It's love at first sight. With their separate lives, they couldn't stay together. And when Lyla had their baby, Lyla's father gives away the baby to an orphanage while telling her the baby had died. Eleven years later, Evan Taylor (Freddie Highmore) is absolutely certain that he will find his parents and he'll bring the star crossed lovers back together.So far so good, the movie moves along. It's a modern fairy tale that needs desperately some visual magic. Freddie Highmore is good child actor. However he needs to do more with his baby face. Jonathan Rhys Meyers is good as a man who's lost hope and the music. Keri Russell is an amazing actress who's capable of inner sadness and powerful outer pain.And then Evan runs away from group home to NY. He hooks up with a creepy monger Wizard (Robin Williams) who uses Evan and the other kids to make money. It's like Pinocchio when he's forced to join the circus. It's an uncomfortable storyline. And Robin Williams' creepy performance really ruins the magic of this story. I mean it's one step short of child slavery."
It Chapter Two,7,1,2,16 October 2019," I understand
","It's 27 years later. Mike still lives in Derry, Maine. He's tracking suspicious deaths and calls up the rest of the Losers' Club. Pennywise is back.I understand what the movie is trying to do. It is definitely far superior to the 1990 mini-series. It's very apparent from that 90 movie that the kids' side is the far superior part. The adult side is a real problem that this movie is trying to solve. The solution seems to be to inject as much of the teen actors as possible with the constant flashbacks. First, the Chinese restaurant is better than ever. With more artistic cuts and great creatures, that section is lots of fun. The structure is still everybody gets their own scare section which can be repetitive and not that scary. The entire movie is not scary but it is fun to revisit this world. There is a reason why the movie goes back to kids on bikes. The new adult cast is great. The kids are a little older although it is supposed to only be that later summer. It's all fine but a step down from the first movie.For the third act, there are some good, some bad, and some I'm not sure. The spider-Pennywise looks good. It couldn't get worst than the 90 spider. I really question the sacrifice of the tokens mostly due to the battery acid line being lost. There is so much potential in using the tokens as weapons against Pennywise. Beverly's postcard could be used as a shield and Pennywise would break her shield by pointing out that she doesn't even know its true origins. It's crazy that Mike didn't bring his sheep-killing gun. I don't know about Mike. He did that to the artifact and I don't know why. I don't get his problem. I do like Richie's token story. As far as big final battle, it's mostly fine and I really like the bathroom. All in all, I wonder if a whole new rewriting of the franchise wouldn't be more compelling. I would have been interesting with a whole new cast of kids doing their Scooby gang while they research the old gang. This franchise works much better with kids."
The Guernsey Literary and Potato Peel Pie Society,8,0,1,18 August 2018," old fashion formulaic romance
","In 1941, the British Isle of Guernsey in the English Channel is under Nazi occupation. The locals face starvation. Elizabeth McKenna, Eben Ramsey, Amelia Maugery, Dawsey Adams, and Isola Pribby are forced to fake a literary society to hide a roasted pig when they encounter German soldiers. It's 1946 and Juliet Ashton (Lily James) is uncertain about her new wealth from the success of her book. She is not very proud of the book and she is haunted by her losses in the war. She is leery of the celebratory mood and then she gets a letter from Dawsey. She is taken with the story of their literary society. Sidney Stark is her supportive publisher. Her rich American boyfriend Mark Reynolds proposes to her and she accepts out of obligation as she leaves for the island. There she finds secrets, romance, heart-break, and a story which she cannot write.This is a traditional romantic mystery. It's a tear-jerker. It's a little darker than I expected from the quirky British title. It has all the elements of an old fashion romance which is about sacrifice and nobility. The title is problematic but I doubt the movie can escape it. The other issue is Stark. Matthew Goode is injected as a third romantic possibility which doesn't help. It's an awkward fake-out and unnecessary. His character would be better as an older father figure for Juliet. A young man would more likely be sent to war unless I missed something about his character. I don't think he's injured either. It would be better to have an older actor. The romance itself is not surprising. It is following a familiar old formula which is perfectly good. It's also nice that none of the lead characters are villains in the tale. It's a feel-good old style romance."
"Hail, Caesar!",5,3,4,21 September 2016," Coen brothers' golden age of Hollywood
","It's Hollywood in the 50's. Eddie Mannix (Josh Brolin) is a fixer and producer at Capitol Pictures. Baird Whitlock (George Clooney) is the star of the studio's big Biblical production 'Hail, Caesar!'. He gets kidnapped by a communist cabal and held for ransom. Hobie Doyle is a singing cowboy put into a high class movie directed by Laurence Laurentz (Ralph Fiennes). DeeAnna Moran (Scarlett Johansson) is a twice-divorced starlet with a secret pregnancy. Twin sisters Thora and Thessaly Thacker (Tilda Swinton) are rival gossip columnists. Burt Gurney (Channing Tatum) is a song and dance actor. Various characters go through this unusual day as Eddie tries to fix the many problems.The Coen brothers deliver a detailed, light, wacky portrayal of the golden age of Hollywood. While I like the fixer idea, Clooney may be a better actor for the role. I'm a little tired of Clooney playing dumb because it is broadly fake. Alden Ehrenreich is somewhat an unknown and a perfect fit for the singing cowboy. He's good. The communist cabal is problematic since the Coens obviously want it to be comedic. It doesn't work because it deals with something serious in a flippant way. The movie gets bogged down with too many things that want to be funny but aren't."
Anchorman: The Legend of Ron Burgundy,8,0,0,14 December 2013," Ridiculous and Hilarious
","Ron Burgundy (Will Ferrell) leads a wacky top rated local news team in 1970s San Diego. Brash Champ Kind (David Koechner) does the sports. Mentally retarded Brick Tamland (Steve Carell) is the weatherman. Edgy ladies man Brian Fantana (Paul Rudd) does the on-field reporting. Then their channel hires the beautiful Veronica Corningstone (Christina Applegate) for diversity sake.I couldn't stop laughing. Everybody is hilarious in this especially the stupidity coming out of Steve Carell. Well let's face, it's all stupidity coming out of everybody. The jokes just never stops coming. Behind the laughter, there is the male chauvinist antics, and a quest for the network news anchor desk. The constant joking does wear thin in the section where Ron Burgundy gets Veronica Corningstone. I wonder if the chase and the conflict is funnier without the catching.PS. You have got to love the Burt Reynolds Bandit blooper."
Ice Age: Continental Drift,7,2,2,1 December 2014," I really like the pirate addition
","Scrat is at it again. He falls to the center of the earth. As he chase the acorn, he starts rotating the core setting the continents to drift. Manny is overprotective of Peaches as she falls for Ethan. Sid's family accidentally runs into him and dumps Granny with him. Manny, Sid, Diego and Granny get separated from Ellie, Peaches, and Louis when the continents separate. Manny and the gang get captured by pirate Captain Gutt and his crew on his iceberg ship.Sure it doesn't make sense but I love the addition of the pirates. This is not a franchise that needs to be scientifically correct. The pirates are a fun added bonus in what could have been just another Ice Age road trip. It's like the cast of Ice Age gets thrown into a Pirates of the Caribbean movie. It's silly. It's rip roaring fun for the whole family."
American Gangster,8,1,2,7 February 2015," well-acted gritty characters
","It's 1968 Harlem. Frank Lucas (Denzel Washington) is the right hand man to Robin Hood gangster Bumpy Johnson. When Bumpy dies, Frank tries to take over. He becomes a powerful gangster importing heroin directly from the South East Asian jungle source. Detective Trupo (Josh Brolin) leads a group of corrupt cops reselling seized drugs back on the street. Richie Roberts (Russell Crowe) is a rough and tumble honest cop who tracks down the source for the heroine which killed his partner. Meanwhile Lucas faces against mob boss Dominic Cattano (Armand Assante) and Trupo.It's a vast interconnected crime drama with deep complex well-written characters played by some of the best actors around. It's gritty and dark with good flashes of the Ridley Scott style. It references the French Connection. It doesn't have quite the immediate realism of the documentary style movie. However, Scott is able to meticulously recreate it. Both Washington and Crowe are powerful in their separate sides of the story."
The Mission,8,2,2,25 October 2014," Great location, Great actors, Great music
","In 1750, Spain ceded part of Jesuit Paraguay to Portugal. The Jesuits had converted many of the Guaranis. The Guaranis above the waterfalls still reject the church sending a crucified priest over the falls. Father Gabriel (Jeremy Irons) climbs up the falls and converts the tribe with his music. He confronts slaver Rodrigo Mendoza (Robert De Niro) who is now hunting above the falls. Mendoza returns to town to find his fiancée and his brother Felipe (Aidan Quinn) are now in love. In a jealous rage, he kills his brother. He is despondent and Gabriel offers him work with the Guaranis as penance. Together with Gabriel and other brothers like Fielding (Liam Neeson), they make the mission thrive. Papal emissary Cardinal Altamirano (Ray McAnally) arrives to decide if the church will continue to protect the missions from the slave running Portugese now that the land has been transfer from Spanish protection.The location is magnificent. The actors are terrific. And the music score from Ennio Morricone is both epic and haunting. This is an amazing historical drama. The story ends in a heart wrenching battle. Director Roland Joffé pulls together one of the best movie of the year."
Stranger Than Fiction,6,2,4,26 April 2014," Pleasant but unremarkable
",Harold Crick (Will Ferrell) is a routine driven IRS auditor. The movie starts with a narrator (Emma Thompson) but then he starts hearing her voice one day while brushing his teeth. He is distressed by the voice and breaks him out of his routine. He breaks out of his lonely isolated life when he audits wild angry baker Ana Pascal (Maggie Gyllenhaal) who refuses to pay the part of her taxes for national defense. It turns out that the voice belongs to writer Karen Eiffel. The publisher hired Penny Escher (Queen Latifah) as her assistant. She's blocked trying to figure out how to write Harold Crick's death. Harold is sent to literary professor Jules Hilbert (Dustin Hoffman) for help.This feels like a Charlie Kaufman movie except he would have done something more than simple quirky. Director Marc Forster makes a pleasant if somewhat unremarkable movie. It's well made visually simplified film. The sterile feel leaves the movie without the required warmth. Will Ferrell is playing the everyman. This is more quirky than funny. It has a couple of chuckles but nothing too outstanding.
The Green Mile,9,0,2,1 September 2013," American fable
","Paul Edgecomb (Tom Hanks) is the lead guard on Death Row which they call the Green Mile. One day, John Coffey (Michael Clarke Duncan) is brought in for brutal rape and killing of two little girls. There is something different about the giant Coffey. There seems to be magic in him.Frank Darabont has created an American fable out of Stephen King's story. This is definitely a slow tear jerker. There isn't any car chase or elaborate fights. What it gives is emotional action. The only minor problem is its running time. It's 3 hours which may be 30 minutes too long. As far as I'm concern, it reached it's climax at the warden's home. But the movie had to keep going for a while still. If Frank Darabont could trim that back, I think it would keep more of the emotional impact."
The Reader,7,0,0,15 July 2014," Kate Winslet great but movie slow
","It starts in 1995 with Michael Berg (Ralph Fiennes) as an older successful man. Then it flashes back to 1958 when Michael Berg (David Kross) encounters Hanna Schmitz (Kate Winslet) for the first time. He's a sickly teenager who falls for the older woman. They have a secret love affair where he reads the classics to her. Hanna is given an office job and then she disappears one day. He grows up to be a cold and distant defense lawyer even to his own daughter. As a law student, he finds himself attending the trial of Hanna Schmitz as a Nazi SS guard at Auschwitz who locked 300 prisoners in a church which burns down.The love affair is slow and at first, I figured this is a slow European story about a love affair. It does turn into much more. I would prefer the love story be trimmed a bit while some re-enactments of the war years could be added. It is a provocative examination of guilt and shame. It lays out the story but not give any easy answers. The performance of Kate Winslet is outstanding. The film definitely gives the audience plenty of time to ruminate on the issues. It probably gives too much time and space. It needs to pick up the pace and force a point of view on the audience. That's why a couple of scenes of the war years would be essential. Although director Stephen Daldry seems set on the unanswered question of the murky morality without the essential scenes."
Jaws,8,2,6,10 March 2014," Classic movie icon
","It's Chief of Police Brody (Roy Scheider)'s first year on Amity Island. It's the all important summer holiday season and the 50th annual regatta. When a girl gets eaten by a shark, Brody wants to close the beaches. Mayor Vaughn (Murray Hamilton) has a different opinion. When a little boy is killed by the shark next, Brody closes down the beaches. There's a private bounty of $3000. Local fisherman Quint (Robert Shaw) offers to do it for $10k. Hooper (Richard Dreyfuss) from the Oceanographic Institute answers Brody's call for help. The bounty brings many yahoos and they catch a tiger shark. Only it's not the right shark according to Hooper. Mayor Vaughn reopens the beaches for the 4th of July despite Hooper and Brody's strenuous objections. When the shark attacks again, mayor Vaughn relents and agrees to hire Quint. Quint isn't impressed with Hooper, but he's forced to take both Hooper and Brody on board.There are so many great things about this movie. It holds up even compared to more modern movies. The trick or the luck of this movie is to not show the shark for much of the movie. It is director Steven Spielberg's first big hit in a long line of big hits from one of the most prolific directors. The movie zips along with ease. It is the quintessential popcorn movie."
The Wrestler,9,0,0,21 January 2015," perfect combo of actor and character
","Robin Ramzinski also known as Randy 'The Ram' Robinson (Mickey Rourke) is a famous pro wrestler past his prime. He is now struggling with health problems, locked out of his trailer, working part-time at a supermarket and wrestling in smaller venues. He's possessive of aging stripper Cassidy (Marisa Tomei). After a tough match, he suffers from a near death heart attack. His medical issues force him to retire. He tries to work full-time at the supermarket, get serious with Cassidy and reconnect with his estranged daughter Stephanie (Evan Rachel Wood).There are some great insights into the world of professional wrestling. Aronofsky is doing a documentary style movie to heighten the reality of the character. Mickey Rourke is doing the role of a lifetime and something that was hinted at early in his career. It is a lifetime of hard living thrown onto the screen. It is the perfect marriage of the right actor and his ideal character. Marisa Tomei also puts in her best performance in quite awhile."
Dark Shadows,6,1,1,31 August 2013," looks really good, but just not fun
","Barnabas (Johnny Depp) is a successful man in 1770s town of Collinsport, Maine. He makes the mistake of breaking the heart of a powerful witch Angelique Bouchard (Eva Green). She in turn dooms him into a vampire, and then buries him alive. Two centuries later, Barnabas is accidentally released into the world of 1972. His Collinwood Manor has fallen into disrepair. The dysfunctional remnants of the Collins family have fared little better.This has the great Gothic look of Tim Burton. He is able to have both a 70s look and an old Gothic look. However it is very difficult to root for Barnabas who is essentially a killing monster. It is not fun. And it is not funny. Although there is a monster sex scene that produced a few smiles."
Kingpin,6,0,2,10 March 2015," audacity to keep trying
","It's 1979. Roy Munson (Woody Harrelson) was raised by father to be one of the best bowlers in the world. He beats Ernie McCracken (Bill Murray) at the 1979 Odor-Eaters championship. Ernie puts sugar in his car engine and convinces the naive Roy to hustle a bowling game. Ernie leaves him behind as the angry mob grinds off his bowling hand. 17 years later, he's reduced to a traveling salesman. He discovers Ishmael Boorg (Randy Quaid) at a bowling alley. He's a nice Amish guy whose family would disown him for bowling. The Farrelly brothers keep trying and trying. Most of the jokes don't work but they keep trying. The premise and the setups are all ridiculously stupid. The characters are marginally compelling and one could root for Munson."
Hancock,5,0,1,9 November 2013," good potential good action no suspense
","John Hancock (Will Smith) is a drunk mess of a superhero. He destroys as much as he saves. The LA public has turned against him. He saves PR expert Ray Embrey (Jason Bateman) and Ray is determined to return the favor by saving Hancock's image. Ray brings Hancock back home for dinner but Ray's wife Mary (Charlize Theron) isn't happy to have Hancock around.On the surface, this is a great premise. It has good comedic potential. It would work better if he was a klutz instead of an alcoholic. Hancock is just too unlikeable. And the last half of the movie leaves me confused with more questions than answers. Was there even a climax? That one handed fool can't be the criminal mastermind that is his nemesis. Is there a nemesis? Director Peter Berg has now become an expert on action scenes. I have no doubt about his action directing. But he needs to think about what the story should be. Who the heck is Hancock? I can't really answer that properly after watching it twice. The movie clunks along without much suspense or tension. Every once in awhile there's an action scene."
12 Strong,6,1,4,18 April 2018," old style war movie
","Captain Mitch Nelson (Chris Hemsworth) had gotten a desk job for his family. When America is attacked on 9/11, he pushes to retract from his reassignment to lead his men into the fight against the Taliban in Afghanistan. Hal Spencer (Michael Shannon) is his veteran Chief Warrant Officer. The squad of twelve men joins one of the competing Northern Alliance leaders, Dostum.This is old style patriotic militarism and it does it well. Hemsworth plays the blonde godlike hero. There is plenty of war action. My biggest complaint is the constant need to get Mitch in the middle of the gun battles. Dostum is needlessly reckless to the point of suicidal. The fighting is geared to be cinematic rather than being realistic. They literally walk into traps more than once. There is one scene where dozen of men carry their weapons offering to surrender. For some unknown reason, the Americans stupidly walk out of their fighting positions into exposed ground. It makes the Americans look bad to do something so dumb. A better way is to have one child soldier surrendering and then set off the booby-trap. This is much more an old style action war movie rather than a deeper portrayal of modern war."
Kong: Skull Island,7,5,7,5 September 2017," good monster action
",It's 1973. Bill Randa (John Goodman) convinces a senator to fund his expedition to an unexplored island with expert tracker James Conrad (Tom Hiddleston) and documentarian Mason Weaver (Brie Larson). Bill hires Preston Packard (Samuel L. Jackson) and his soldiers who are finished with the war. They are flying helicopters dropping explosive charges to map the island when Kong shows up to bring them down. Some of the survivors encounter natives and Hank Marlow (John C. Reilly) who crashed during WWII.There are some good monster action. The characters are mostly one-dimensional. The start is a bit meandering. It's thirty minutes before getting to the island. Fifteen minutes is plenty. I don't care about Randa's backstory or the political backdrop of the situation. John C. Reilly is off trying to do comedy by himself. Kong lacks the needed humanity. The best is the monster action and Kong fits well in that aspect. The giant spider is amazing creepiness. The movie needs more of those types of thrills. This is an old-fashion monster movie with state of the art effects.
The Hobbit: The Battle of the Five Armies,7,0,4,8 June 2015," lots of Orc-kills Rambo style
","Smaug is loose and reigns his fire upon Lake-Town. Bard manages to kill the dragon with the Black Arrow. Thorin Oakenshield and the dwarfs reclaim the mountain and its treasures but the gold has driven Oakenshield mad. He is obsessed with finding the Arkenstone but Bilbo has already taken it. The elfs and the villagers descend on the mountain to claim their fair share but Thorin is mad with greed. All the while, the Orcs are secretly closing in on the argumentative bunch.Over the years, I've come to the conclusion that these movie series need 'Previously On' segments. In this movie, the plot is pretty simple and recounting it is not an absolute necessity although a refresher would be helpful. What is truly needed is a section to rebuild the dramatic tension. The story just plop down right into a battle. It's an abrupt start and not in a good way. I also dislike the silly villainy of Alfrid Lickspittle. It's not particularly funny and rather insipid. Also the Orcs are nothing more than cannon fodder. It doesn't feel scary when they are mowed down Rambo style. Nevertheless, this is a fun adventurous ride. Tauriel continues to be a good addition providing the only feminine touch and some needed heart. Almost everybody has their fair shake. It's a machine that force out action and kills Orcs like an assembly line."
Hitch,7,1,1,6 March 2014," Will Smith is actually good in rom-com
","Hitch (Will Smith) is the Date Doctor. He fixes up guys to get out their inner beauty for the girls of their dreams. Albert (Kevin James) is a hopeless slob pining for the beautiful socialite Allegra Cole (Amber Valletta). He's her junior tax consultant, and she doesn't even know he's alive. Sara (Eva Mendes) is a mud raking columnist. For some reason, Hitch can't get it together when it comes to her. Then she discovers what he actually does and puts it in the papers.Will Smith is actually loveably charming. The character could have come across as a douche. Kevin James is at his maximum adorableness. Will Smith and Eva Mendes get into too much slapstick. The secondary rom-com with Kevin James is very touching. It's a rom-com with just enough originality and charm."
Star Wars: Episode III - Revenge of the Sith,4,2,13,25 December 2015," great CGI action but tired dialog and bad Christensen acting
","After three years of the Clone Wars, Chancellor Palpatine is kidnapped by the besieging droid army led by from General Grievous. Obi-Wan Kenobi (Ewan McGregor) and Anakin Skywalker (Hayden Christensen) kill Count Dooku to rescue Palpatine. Padmé Amidala (Natalie Portman) reveals her pregnancy. Anakin falls under the spell of Palpatine who suggests a way to surpass death with the Dark Side as the Jedi Order starts to suspect an insidious plan.The CGI space battle opening is amazing. The special effects remain the biggest positive from the prequels. The dialogue continues to be stiff. Anakin is annoying not because of the dark side. The romance is horribly clunky. The dialog between them is insanely awkward. When the movie isn't a CGI fight or battle, it grinds down to a halt with stuffy dialog being read in lackluster situations. There is too much sitting and talking. There is almost no humor to speak of. Then there is Anakin's whiplash turn. Christensen's wooden acting and limited range makes it impossible for him to deliver the difficult complex transformation. I chuckled in the theater when he goes over to the dark side. It destroys everything that comes after that. It's a sad close to a failed prequel."
Ray,7,0,1,24 May 2015," Jamie Foxx great
","It's 1948. Ray Charles Robinson (Jamie Foxx) leaves his home in northern Florida to go to Seattle. He meets Quincy Jones (Larenz Tate) playing the trumpet on the street. He's taken advantage of by Marlene Andres and Gossie McKee (Terrence Howard). There are flashbacks of Ray Charles as a boy who went blind at the age of seven and witnessing his younger brother George drown. His willful mother insisted that he be independent. He would rise in fame and success but is always haunted by the water and his guilt.This is fairly standard biopic fare. Ray Charles is a great subject and this is a well made movie. Jamie Foxx does a great job but one gets the sense that the movie pulls its punch a little. It's also a bit simplistic by laying so much with the death of George. However the mother character is terrific. Sometimes simplicity is a good thing. When you add the great music, this is a good music biopic."
Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs,9,6,6,12 April 2014," Groundbreaking classic and it's actually fun
","The first full-length animated feature from the Disney Studios is a hit and has led the way for every animated movie since. Snow White is a beautiful princess who is targeted by the jealous Queen. The Queen orders the Huntsman to kill Snow White, but he takes pity on her and sends her off into the woods. There she is rescued by the Seven Dwarfs. The Queen finds out that Snow White has survived and decides to curse her with her own poison apple.It is deserving of the label classic. The story is fun. I love the Dwarfs. I love the Queen. I wish Snow White could be less girly girl, but those were the times. For being a first, it does it with great charm. It is a credit to the movie world. There are great catchy songs. Even a dated song like 'Some Day My Prince Will Come' is still very compelling."
Shooter,7,0,1,13 November 2013," Good action
","Bob Lee Swagger (Mark Wahlberg) is a world class marksman. On a secret Ethiopian mission, he and his best friend were abandoned. He escapes and lives in secluded woods. Colonel Isaac Johnson (Danny Glover) finds him and convinces him that the president is in danger from a world class assassin. He decides to help the colonel but is set up. After being knocked down by Swagger, rookie FBI agent Nick Memphis (Michael Peña) is in trouble with the bosses but investigates what appears to be a wide ranging conspiracy.The action is good, and the story is relatively tight. Mark Wahlberg does an admirable job as an almost superhuman soldier. Michael Peña is solid as always. Kate Mara looks sexy although they need to do more exposition on their past. The twist at the start is just too obvious. It might as well come with a neon sign. The story and the action does ramble on. The bad guys do too much explaining. I wish they built up the action to a crescendo instead. But the action is good enough to keep watching."
The Lion King,6,3,6,15 May 2015," great songs in Shakespearian epic
","King Mufasa and Queen Sarabi have a new son Simba. Mufasa's younger brother Scar is jealous of the new heir to the throne to rule the African plains. Scar tricks Simba to go to the elephant graveyard. Simba takes Nala despite Zazu's warnings. They are set upon by hyenas Shenzi, Banzai and Ed. Mufasa rescues them. Scar comes up with a scheme to kill Mufasa and Simba. Scar places Simba in the middle of a wildebeest stampede herded by the hyenas. Scar kills Mufasa while he's rescuing his son. The hyenas chase Simba away. Scar claims the throne with Simba assumed to be dead. Meerkat Timon and warthog Pumbaa befriends the lost Simba and teach him their motto 'hakuna matata'.Simba is an annoying brat. He's my main problem in this movie because he annoys me even as a self-obsessed cub. It is the point of the movie so I do have to overlook it somewhat. I just don't care enough about Simba. Although, I don't know how I would feel about an animated Hamlet. The songs are iconic. The drama is Shakespearian. There is a lot to like about this classic but not necessarily Simba."
Bring It On,7,0,0,19 August 2014," Fun cheerleader movie
","Torrance Shipman (Kirsten Dunst) is voted the new captain of the Toro cheerleading squad at San Diego's Rancho Carne High School taking over from Big Red (Lindsay Sloane). After Carver is injured, she picks rebellious gymnast Missy Pantone (Eliza Dushku) to replace her. Missy's brother Cliff (Jesse Bradford) and Torrance develop chemistry. It should be straight forward to win the national championship for the sixth year in a row with their standard routine. However Torrance discovers that Big Red had actually stolen the choreography from an inner city squad the Clovers led by the Isis (Gabrielle Union).It has the cutesy wacky sensibility of Clueless and the structure of a traditional sports movie. The sport just happens to be cheerleading. It's fun and it's silly. It has its irreverent moments led by a great performance from Kirsten Dunst. At least, there are a few more shades to the traditional dumb mean cheerleader stereotype. The lingo is hilarious. If the viewer is willing to be not so high minded, this cheerleading movie could be a bit of fun."
Inception,9,0,4,1 October 2013," Oozing with originality
","This is a world where people can go into your dreams. Some are even able to use your dreams to influence your actions. Dom Cobb (Leonardo DiCaprio) is skilled at stealing secrets by diving into your dreams. It's a dark treacherous world where he has made too many enemies. Now he is offered a chance to come in from the cold. This time his team is tasked to plant an idea into the target's mind, or in one word inception.Christopher Nolan has created something of a Penrose-stairs structure in this movie. It's complicated and may be too convoluted to be reasonable. But that's as much part of its charm. The worlds, the effects, the ideas are all first rate. It is oozing with originality.The actors are also first rate. Nolan can command the best cast to his projects now. There is nobody better than DiCaprio to anchor this movie. Nothing about this movie is done with lesser parts. This is indeed a top movie."
Murder on the Orient Express,6,2,4,13 February 2018," beautiful but lacking
","After solving a case at the Wailing Wall, famed detective Hercule Poirot (Kenneth Branagh) takes a boat to Istanbul where he boards the Orient Express with various characters. While crossing the Alps, the train is stuck in the snow and a murder occurs. Poirot must find the culprit and its connection to a famous child kidnap-murder case.Branagh uses his skills to create beautiful stages on which his actors can perform. The only problem is that the characters are little more than facades. They are surfaces without interiors. While it's impressively beautiful, there isn't any blood pumping through this story. It begins with Branagh and his crazy mustache. It's an artifice in place of real character work. It also draws attention away from any real work. There is an artificiality with the whole world although it is a beautiful art world. I do wonder if this is the best way to update the adaptation of this classic."
Defiance,7,0,1,31 August 2013," can't get over 007
","Daniel Craig, Liev Schreiber, Jamie Bell, and George MacKay play the Bielski brothers. In WWII, they hid in the forest fighting off Germans in occupied Poland. They faced multitudes of challenges as they gathered even more refugees. Also staring are Alexa Davalos and Mia Wasikowska.The story isn't particularly compelling. Don't get me wrong. These people went through hell. But as a drama, there are no real surprises. The ending is predictable. On top of everything, I can't stop thinking that Daniel Craig is 007. It's a Bond movie in the woods."
Lord of War,8,2,3,2 December 2013," Great Nicolas Cage
","Yuri Orlov (Nicolas Cage) is an Ukrainian immigrant living Little Odessa in New York. Vitaly (Jared Leto) is his brother. His dream girl is the neighborhood beauty queen Ava Fontaine (Bridget Moynahan). After witnessing a gangland hit, he decides to start selling weapons along with his brother. Meanwhile, he's being hounded by incorruptible Interpol agent Jack Valentine (Ethan Hawke) and fellow gunrunner Simeon Weisz (Ian Holm).I love the matter-of-factness to Cage's narration. The story is fascinating and spans the world. But it's Cage that sells it. He still has the charm. Before you realize it, you're rooting for an amoral death dealer, a Lord of War. Jared Leto is terrific as the drugged out brother who's struggling with more than his addiction. This is one of the better black comedies with an anti-gun message."
Sherlock Holmes,8,0,1,23 February 2014," Guy Ritchie & Robert Downey Jr. reimagines Sherlock Holmes
","Robert Downey Jr. is the legendary Sherlock Holmes. He plays the character as a superior-minded, physical, arrogant for good reasons, and manic. Dr. John Watson (Jude Law) is his loyal assistant who tries to deal with Holmes' eccentricities. They catch serial killer occultist Lord Blackwood (Mark Strong) and put him away in prison. The mysterious grifter Irene Adler (Rachel McAdams) is Holmes' equal, and comes to him with a murky proposition. When Blackwood seemingly returns from the dead after his hanging, Holmes must pick up the chase once again.This is a more action oriented Sherlock Holmes in director Guy Ritchie's hands. He is not the cool calculating academic sleuth that is traditional in the character. The three leads have great chemistry together. RDJ creates an unique Holmes. Ritchie has piled on a densely written story of quirky mannerism, and outrageous action. It can be confusing at times like most other Ritchie movie. But confusions aside, this is a fun manic movie."
The Waterboy,5,1,1,20 March 2015," no real laughs but somewhat watchable
","Bobby Boucher (Adam Sandler) is the slow lowly 31 year old waterboy for the UL football team. Everybody is picking on him. Coach Red Beaulieu (Jerry Reed) fires him for disrupting practice. He goes home to Jackson's Bayou, Louisiana to his domineering mama (Kathy Bates). He goes to the rundown South Central Lousiana State University. Coach Klein (Henry Winkler) hires the waterboy and then discovers that he's a great tackler. He becomes the new linebacker with the kicker Derek Wallace as his only friend. He goes out with Vicki Vallencourt (Fairuza Balk) who just got out of jail despite his mother's objections.It's not that funny but it's still a passable watch. Sandler is playing another idiot but he's a likable idiot. The mannerisms can be annoying to some but it's inoffensive to me. There are a few too many bullies. I don't think most of the players would still pick on him as he gets all those sacks. There's a missing scene where somebody on the team gets impressed by his tackling, changes his mind and stands up to the quarterback. In the end, it's somewhat watchable but no real laughs with so many shallow unimaginative jokes."
The Secret Life of Pets,6,2,4,4 August 2016," wacky action animation for kids
","Max is a terrier happily living in a Manhattan apartment with his owner Katie. His world is turned upside down when Katie bring home a shaggy dog named Duke. Max tries to be the alpha and Duke pulls him out of the dog park. The duo is cornered by alley cats, captured by dog catchers, and released by a gang of 'Flushed Pets' from the sewers led by a people-hating rabbit named Snowball. Gidget is a dog who likes Max. She recruits another group to look for the missing dogs. Max and Duke escape from Snowball who vows to hunt them down.This is a wacky chaotic stew of loud animated animals. It is unrelenting in its fun-obsessed story. The voice work is good comedy. There are probably too many characters. It's not that much of a secret life when the pets are driving a bus causing traffic chaos. This is geared more towards the younger kids. The non-stop brightly-colored action-powered movie will keep them from getting too bored if it doesn't exhaust them."
WALL·E,9,0,2,4 May 2014," PIXAR does it again
","The world is one giant garbage heap. Humanity under BnL Corp has taken off on giant cruise spaceships for a 5 year tour but they have been gone for much longer. Meanwhile they have left garbage collecting robots like WALL·E to clean up the earth. It spends it's days packing garbage into cubes. Then one day, an advanced robot EVE is dropped off to do reconnaissance. EVE collects samples and blasts everything that moves. When WALL-E shows EVE a plant, her mission is complete and she is retrieved by a spaceship. WALL-E follows EVE and grabs a ride back to cruise ship. It finds the human race are now chubby blobs who are always eating and sitting on their floating chairs.This is a cute movie. There is no dialog with the robots. The use of robotic beeps and tones create their voices. It's as much fun as any of the best silent movies staring Chaplin or Keaton. Most of the movie takes place without human dialog. It is imaginative and original. It is another one of the amazing offerings from PIXAR."
The Good Shepherd,8,2,4,10 May 2014," Quietly powerful and None of the flash
","It starts on April 16, 1961. Edward Wilson (Matt Damon) is a top American spy. When the Bay of Pigs don't go well, everybody is suspicious of a leak. Then it flashes back to 1939 Yale University. He is a student and recruited by Bill Sullivan (Robert De Niro) to spy on a professor with German ties. He is forced into a shotgun wedding with Margaret (Angelina Jolie). The war starts and he goes to Britain working for the fledging American spy agency. He would become one of the best at counter-intelligence but his family life suffers tremendously with his wife and son (Eddie Redmayne).As far as I'm concern, director Robert De Niro is 2 for 2 so far. Matt Damon puts in a deadly quiet performance. This is no Bond movie. There are no flashy gadgets and movie contraptions. This feels like the real thing. A spy would obviously not talk about spy stuff. The internalization and the paranoia seems to hit the right notes. The family dysfunction follows logically. I guess people who want the excitement will have trouble with the quietness. I personally found it intriguing."
Finding Dory,8,2,9,24 November 2016," Dory a great character
","Dory is a blue tang fish who suffers from memory loss. As a baby, she got separated from her family. After the events of 'Finding Nemo', Dory (Ellen DeGeneres) is living with Nemo and his dad Marlin (Albert Brooks). Mr. Ray is teaching school about migration and home which refreshes her long dormant memories. Marlin reluctantly agrees to help her find her parents.It starts off great with little Dory all the way up to the turtles. Then Dory gets captured. I'm not saying it's bad but part of the magic fades in the human world. I know the fish tank was a part of the original but it wasn't my favorite there either. So much of this is hopping from one aquarium exhibit to the next. On the other hand, Dory is a wonderful lead character. DeGeneres' voice work is terrific. Destiny and Bailey are great additions. The animation is sharper than ever. The quest is touching and poignant. This may not be the sequel I expected. I prefer the quest to be in the natural world but this is good nevertheless."
Stalag 17,6,1,2,27 December 2014," Dark POW story and really broad comedy
","It's the end of 1944. Sgt. J.J. Sefton (William Holden) is a cynic and an opportunist who bets against fellow prisoners escaping. They're American POWs in Stalag 17. The prison commandant Oberst von Scherbach (Otto Preminger) seems to have an informer in Barrack 4. Sgt. Frank Price (Peter Graves) is the prisoners' security chief. Animal (Robert Strauss) is the barrack's loud wild man. Duke (Neville Brand) is the hothead. For some, the obvious leak is Sefton who trades with the guards. After some more setbacks, the men beat up Sefton. Sefton figures that he needs to find the real leak.I don't really like the broad comedy coming from Animal and Harry. They just take the seriousness out of darker POW story. The two different tones keep stepping on each other. I really don't like the broad comedy. The secret informer is quite compelling although I would have made Dunbar fake the sabotage story. That would have worked even better especially considering Sefton talking about how his mother buying his way out of trouble."
Arrival,8,7,26,30 January 2017," smart sci-fi
","Louise Banks (Amy Adams) loses her daughter due to illness. She's a linguistics professor when alien ships land on earth. Colonel Weber (Forest Whitaker) asks her for translation help and she convinces him to join his contact group. She is paired up with theoretical physicist Ian Donnelly (Jeremy Renner). They are one of twelve teams around the world in contact with a separate spaceship. The aliens use a circular smoke-like writing system. Eventually, China leads several teams to confront the aliens.This is a change from the action-oriented sci-fi movies. It asks questions and challenges the audience. It's a mystery sci-fi. It is smart although I wonder if it could be even smarter. The reveal is nicely done. I want the writing system to be more profound and more easily connected in some way. The obvious comparison is the message in Contact and solving that message was a great revelation. This film is more murky and mysterious. The general sense is understandable but there needs to be an ah-ha moment in the audience translating the alien language. I can't give away any of it. Amy Adams does some good work. It's a beautiful film both visually and thematically. It's another solid film form Villeneuve."
The Terminal,6,1,2,29 November 2014," mix of serious and light comedy
",Viktor Navorski (Tom Hanks) from Krakozhia arrives in JFK. He speaks limited English and has limited understanding. Frank Dixon (Stanley Tucci) tells him that his country has just had a coup and the US has revoked his visa. Viktor is a stateless man with no status. Dixon can't allow him to enter the country but he can't detain him either. Dixon allows him to move freely in the international transit lounge. However the temporary situation turns into a long running saga. Dixon is getting promoted. He tries to get Viktor to leave on his own. Viktor befriends various people. He meets flight attendant Amelia Warren (Catherine Zeta-Jones) and pretends to be a frequent traveler. This is an uncomfortable mix of serious and light-hearted. The whole thing just strikes me as being fake. It starts with the fake country. Then there is Tom Hanks faking an accent. His English is conveniently bad when the movie needs it to be but good enough whenever the movie wants. Also there is the fake setup. There may be a heart-warming funny indie film here somewhere but it needs an unknown to play this role. The story has some serious stuff but the light comedy really whitewashes it. Director Steven Spielberg is probably not the right guy for this film and Hanks is too recognizable. I don't want to be a Scrooge and hate on this light comedy. Most of it doesn't work for me. Spielberg is such a master filmmaker that he squeezes some heart-wrenching moments as well as some light comedy out of it.
The Blind Side,7,1,2,20 September 2013," Feel Good Inspirational Story
","This is the true story of Leigh Anne Tuohy (Sandra Bullock) and Sean Tuohy (Tim McGraw) who take in homeless African-American teenager Michael 'Big Mike' Oher (Quinton Aaron). It's a straight forward feel good inspirational story. Just don't expect anything more.Sandra Bullock has a thick southern accent. She plays the feisty momma bear. Tim McGraw is a bit stiff. I think Sandra's big performance may overshadow him. Quinton Aaron is too quiet. It's just too stereotypical of a quiet black saint. His character has deep dark depths, and he needs to be able to project it. Whatever the minor defects, this film works well for what it's suppose to be."
The Shawshank Redemption,8,9,11,8 December 2013," Freeman gives it depth
","Andy Dufresne (Tim Robbins) is a banker convicted of murdering his wife and her lover. He always professes his innocence, but is thrown into Shawshank Prison with other lifers like Red (Morgan Freeman).Director Frank Darabont has made a prison fable out of a Stephen King short story. It is well acted by Tim Robbins and Morgan Freeman. Freeman is especially important as he is the narrator and the POV of the story. It's his lyrical voice that makes this fable compelling. It could have easily been a simple prison movie that rang hollow. Freeman gave the readings depth.If there is one complaint, it is Andy's claim of innocence. It needs to be shown early on during the trial. Instead, we derived mostly from Andy's demeanor. It needs to be a big declaration at the beginning. When Tommy (Gil Bellows) tells the story, he should include one detail from the trial like the 8 bullets. That way, the audience can get an aha moment. It's a minor point, and overall this is a good prison fable."
The Cannonball Run,8,1,1,22 July 2015," Simply fun fun fun
","The Cannonball Run is a highly illegal, no holds barred car race from Connecticut to California. JJ McClure (Burt Reynolds) and his sidekick Victor Prinzim (Dom DeLuise) with his alter ego Captain Chaos chose to drive an ambulance. They use wacky Dr Van Helsing (Jack Elam) and kidnap tree-lover Pamela (Farrah Fawcett) as their patient. Environmentalist Arthur J. Foyt has the hots for Pamela and intends to stop the race. Race car driver Jamie Blake (Dean Martin) and Fenderbaum (Sammy Davis Jr.) dress as priests in their red Ferrari. Seymour Goldfarb, Jr. (Roger Moore) imagines himself to be the Bond actor Roger Moore. Jill Rivers (Tara Buckman) and Marcie Thatcher (Adrienne Barbeau) use both their looks and their black Lamborghini Countach to full advantage. Jackie Chan and his computer sidekick Michael Hui drive their hi-tech Japanese car. Oil rich sheik (Jamie Farr) drives his white Rolls-Royce. Wealthy risk taker Compton and Shaky Finch ride a motorcycle doing a wheelie. Terry (Terry Bradshaw) and stuttering Mel are two good old boys. Mad Dog and Batman drive the truck through everything.It's irreverent. It's sexist. It's silly. It's got car chases. It's ridiculous. It is entertainment of the lowest common denominator. It is simply fun, fun, fun. Everybody is having fun. It introduces Jack Chan to America. Dom DeLuise is a great sidekick to Burt Reynolds and Jack Elam is terrific. It may actually be better if Farrah Fawcett plays dumber. Its unabashed ridiculing of leftist environmental movement probably left the critics cold. Its low brow humor also doesn't help. But everybody has to love the hilarious outtakes."
Parasite,7,9,27,4 January 2020," class warfare
","The Kim family leeches off others and lives in a basement apartment. The son Ki-woo gets a job tutoring a young girl. Using a series of lies, each member of the Kim family gets a job at the rich Park family home.I actually found the Kim family too annoying to watch at the beginning. The pizza box incident reminds me of some real life people who are impossible to work with. It's frustrating to sit through. It took a couple of tries. I prefer my grifting with better humor and better style. This family is just annoying. Pizza girl should never hire them for anything. It does get better. There is better humor and I get more in tune with the movie as it continues. I would prefer the driver to be less horny. He needs to be a complete saint. In fact, the rich family needs to be perfect at first so that they can slowly reveal their flaws. Also, they need to lay down the ghost story much earlier and sprinkle in some clues. The twist is unforeseen. That's mostly good but it would be better if the audience can suspect something like that. I do like the smell aspect. It's foreshadowed well and has a great build-up. There are scenes which I can almost smell. This is a very compelling statement about class in society."
Rango,7,0,0,10 February 2014," Jack Sparrow as a lizard
","Rango (Johnny Depp) is a hyper imaginative pet chameleon. When his family loses him out the back of their car, he is left to fend for himself in the middle of a desert. He escapes from a deadly hawk to find a western town called Dirt. The drought has made water incredibly valuable. Through luck and circumstances, Rango become the sheriff, but he is hopelessly clueless.This is a very well made Nickelodeon animated movie. I wonder if this is going to be a new competitor to the animated field. The animation looks crisp and lively. The only missing element is cuter characters. Lizards are very odd for animation especially if you do it relatively realistic. But it fits very well to the setting of an old decaying western.Rango is a very original character which actually is reminiscent of Johnny Depp's other big character Jack Sparrow. Does the fact that this is a reunion between Pirates director Gore Verbinski and Johnny Depp has anything to do with it? The comedy comes from a similar place, and it works well here as well."
Music and Lyrics,7,3,7,6 October 2013," Grant-Barrymore rom-com A-Team
","Director/writer Marc Lawrence is kind of a rom-com hack. And that's basically what we have here. The story is weak, but it's the two stars that make this shine.Alex Fletcher (Hugh Grant) is a has-been singer songwriter. He's living off his former fame, but that's drying up. So he's forced to ghost write for pop princess Cora Corman. Sophie Fisher (Drew Barrymore) is the substitute plant waterer. (really?? that's a job?) She ends up being his lyricist.It's all very silly and manufactured. But the storyline does allow a few jabs at popular music. Grant and Barrymore are super cute and amiable together. They are amazing rom-com material. Their chemistry is off the charts. They both have great comic timing. They make this premise work."
Birdman or (The Unexpected Virtue of Ignorance),8,2,4,20 July 2015," audacious concept
","Riggan Thomson (Michael Keaton) is famous for his role as comic book superhero Birdman. He is trying to revive his waning career with his first Broadway show that he wrote and directing with his friend Jake (Zach Galifianakis). His daughter Sam (Emma Stone) works as his grumpy assistant. Lesley (Naomi Watts) acts in the play. When a light falls on the lead, Lesley suggests headliner Mike Shiner (Edward Norton). Mike is a method actor who gets on Riggan's nerves.The concept of long continuous scenes is interesting. It adds to the level of difficulty. It is audacious and makes the audience sit up to pay attention. Although this movie does not take place in real time. It's not 2 hours of Riggan's life. There is one amazing scene with Keaton in his underwear. There is a daring in that it is outside in the real world. It adds a higher level of energy and that scene buzzes. The standout performance is Norton. He's got the most fun character. Everybody does a great job especially Galifianakis, Stone and of course Keaton."
Centurion,7,1,3,27 December 2015," blood and guts
","In 117 A.D., the Romans in Britania is stretched to the limit by the Picts in the north. After 20 years of stalemate, the Romans aim to finish the resistance. Centurion Quintus Dias (Michael Fassbender) is half naked running in the snow. The movie moves back two weeks to see Dias and his garrison outpost under attack. He is captured and taken to the Pict leader Gorlacon. General Titus Flavius Virilus (Dominic West) in York is ordered to destroy the Picts with his men. He is given mute Pict scout Etain (Olga Kurylenko) to guide him.This is a straight forward bloody violent sword and sandal war movie. The actors are solid led by West and Fassbender. It doesn't have many big story elements. The action is brutal and chaotic. The mood is dark and brood. I also love tracking in the wilderness. I like the cat-and-mouse game of the escape."
The Big Short,8,0,1,12 July 2016," don't really like the expositions
","Michael Burry (Christian Bale) is a glass-eyed socially-awkward hedge fund manager at Scion Capital. He investigates mortgage backed securities and discovers the assumed safe housing market is built on a foundation of bad loans. He bets $1.3 billion against them and talks the banks into creating credit default swaps. Jared Vennett (Ryan Gosling) from DeutscheBank learns of the bet. Despite his bank being one of those who eagerly took the bet, he agrees with Burry and tries to gather investors. Mark Baum (Steve Carell) is a life long skeptic. After a wrong number phone call, he and his group are recruited by Vennett to bet against the system. Charlie Geller and Jamie Shipley discover Vennett's prospectus. They invest their small fund enlisting their neighbor retired banker doomsayer Ben Rickert (Brad Pitt).Carell and Gosling are hilarious together. It's not a surprise since they've been hilarious before. The story is surprisingly compelling despite its foregone conclusion. All three stories are compelling. The three cameo expositions are the only weak spots. I'm sure others love them. They remind me of the cartoon DNA demonstration in 'Jurassic Park' except that one fits into the premise. These ones exist outside the story, talks down to the audience, and doesn't necessarily explain the ideas any better than other ways. Vennett's Jenga demonstration works fine. The two douche mortgage sellers are great. The stripper is perfect. The movie could explain plenty of stuff without resorting to this gimmick. Again, I'm sure others loved them. I'm not one of them."
The Conjuring,8,0,3,9 August 2013," well done old fashion scary movie
",It's 1971. Roger (Ron Livingston) and Carolyn Perron (Lili Taylor) with their kids move into a farm house. Strange things start to happen. They call in married paranormal investigators Lorraine (Vera Farmiga) and Ed Warren (Patrick Wilson).This is an old fashion haunted house scary story. This is no big twist or slasher porn. This is a rather straight forward ghost story. It hearkens back to films like Amityville or Poltergeist. All the actors are spot on. The tension builds nicely throughout the movie. My only complaint is that the ending is slightly too hectic and runs on a little but that's a very minor point. It's barely worth a mention really. It's great to have an old fashion horror done well.
Platoon,9,1,1,28 November 2013," The quintessential Vietnam war movie
","It's September 1967, and Chris (Charlie Sheen) has just arrived in Vietnam. He is sheltered and his father and grandfather fought in the military. As the new guy, nobody cares to be his friend. Lt. Wolfe (Mark Moses) is a weak ineffective leader. His men are divided in two. Some are followers of the cruel Sgt. Barnes (Tom Berenger). Others are followers of the humane Sgt. Elias (Willem Dafoe). In the end, Barnes and Elias are in a struggle for Chris' soul.This is the quintessential Vietnam war movie. Oliver Stone has recreated the jungle combat and placed a morality tale in the middle of it. It is possibly Charlie Sheen's greatest performance. His innocence at the beginning evolves into a grizzled veteran fighter. The combat is so realistic, and the story is so compelling. It is a must see for all movie goers."
Scream,7,0,1,13 June 2014," Really smart horror
","Casey Becker (Drew Barrymore) is alone at home and receives crank calls from a creep. Ghostface ends up killing her boyfriend Steve and Casey. It's a great start reminiscent of Psycho where the obvious lead is killed off. This is a horror that knows the history of horror and references it.Sidney Prescott (Neve Campbell) is a virgin despite the efforts of boyfriend Billy Loomis (Skeet Ulrich). Sidney's mother had been killed a year earlier and she's alone with her father. Sidney put Cotton Weary (Liev Schreiber) in prison for the crime but he claims to be innocent. The next day, the sheriff with deputy Dewey (David Arquette) start interviewing the students. News reporter Gale Weathers (Courteney Cox) is on the case. Sidney and Billy gather with Tatum (Rose McGowan), Stuart (Matthew Lillard) and Randy (Jamie Kennedy) to discuss the murders. Then Ghostface calls Sidney.There is no doubt that Wes Craven and Kevin Williamson have come up with an interesting take on the slasher movie. It's not just about being more gruesome and bloodier. It's about being smarter. It's not the first one to be self-referencing. It is the one that built a movie around it. The teens are smart and aware. The beauty of this is that this movie is smart for a smart audience with smart characters. The only problem I have is the twisty nature of the reveals and the misdirections. There are quite a few of them and that part seems over-written. Of course, that is commented up by one of the characters and he's exactly right. The movie kind of lost me in that aspect."
Never Back Down,6,0,0,8 April 2014," High School MMA Fight Club
","Jake Tyler (Sean Faris) is an angry young man after the death of his father in a drunk driving incidence. He's a football player that is constantly in trouble. His little brother has to move to Orlando for tennis, and his mother Margot (Leslie Hope) moves the family. His new school has its own MMA fight club run by rich bully Ryan McCarthy (Cam Gigandet). Popular girl Baja Miller (Amber Heard) invites him to a party, but it turns out to be a setup for a fight. He gets crushed. Geeky Max Cooperman (Evan Peters) introduces him to MMA trainer Jean Roqua (Djimon Hounsou).This is sorta like 'Karate Kid', but not really. It's a bit of 'Fight Club', but it doesn't have the writing skills. The kids are OC wannabes. The setup of the story isn't quite good enough. The bully barely has to push him before punches are thrown. And Hounsou is no Miyagi. At least the bare bones are there underneath. It slavishly follows a certain formula without answering some basic questions. As always the characters need to call the cops. The message is corrupted by the need for the big final fight."
Prometheus,7,4,6,26 August 2013," Ridley Scott revisits Alienverse
","This is a dangerous project for Ridley Scott revisiting one of his classic movies. It could muddy that franchise's good reputation if one could leave the various Alien vs Predator movies out of it. Luckily, it didn't do any major damage. It did raise some questions and hopefully answered others.This time the cast consist of Noomi Rapace, Michael Fassbender, and Charlize Theron. They all are playing with some dark energy. There is no easy story here. It's filled with complications. There are great call backs to the original. It's compelling even if it's a messy story.Guy Pearce is unrecognizable in his make up. And I think it's the most obvious mistake to cast him in this role. It has an easy solution if he would cast an older actor. Pearce just look fake. There are plenty of older actors around. I rather have Ian Holm if he was willing."
Halloween,9,2,7,4 December 2013," Golden Age of Horror
","Michael Myers kills his older sister Judith Myers when he was six. Fifteen years later, Michael escapes the sanitarium. He returns to Haddonfield, Illinois. It's Halloween and he grabs a white William Shatner mask. He starts stalking Laurie Strode (Jamie Lee Curtis). Her friends Annie Brackett (Nancy Kyes) and Lynda van der Klok (P. J. Soles) dismisses her concern. Dr. Samuel Loomis (Donald Pleasence) is on Michael Myers' trail. It's the movie that launched endless sequels, and the careers of Jamie Lee Curtis and even John Carpenter. This is his first big hit. But there is more. It's the start of the golden age of horror. There are killers with name recognition. We get scenes from the killer's POV. Horror is moving into new territories. Michael Myers is possibly the first well known killer movie character. It's interesting that the adult Michael Myers really doesn't start killing until later in the movie. There isn't as much slashing in this slasher movie as most would expect. It is more creepy than gory. The iconic music just adds to the creepy atmosphere. It's also such an incredible idea that this low budget indie horror would become so iconic and have so much influence. Considering that Donald Pleasence is the most experienced of anybody on the set, it is truly amazing that this was so well made."
The Water Diviner,6,0,2,7 April 2016," nice epic style
","Joshua Connor (Russell Crowe) is an Australian farmer who lost his three sons in the Battle of Gallipoli. Four years later, his wife Eliza dies and he vows to bring his sons home to be buried next to their mother. In Istanbul, he rents a room from war widow Ayshe (Olga Kurylenko) who is under pressure. Connor sneaks into Gallipoli despite the British military. Major Hasan commanded Turkish troops during the battle and decides to help Connor find his dead sons.There is a sense of the great epic. I really like the movie going to Gallipoli. However, it goes on a little too long with a few twist that is less believable. It would be better to not have those turns. It also tries to make the Turks victims and the Greeks villains which doesn't necessarily sit well. I do have a few problems with the story in the second half. It's Russell Crowe's theatrical directing debut and his visual efforts are impressive. He is able to keep flow of the story and shows some solid skills as a director."
Wonder Woman,9,13,28,4 July 2017," hits almost every note perfectly
","Amazonian princess Diana (Gal Gadot) lives on the hidden island of Themyscira. Queen Hippolyta (Connie Nielsen) forbids her training but Antiope (Robin Wright) disobeys her. Zeus had created mankind which were corrupted by Ares, God of War. Zeus defeated him and hid Themyscira from the world. One day, Steve Trevor (Chris Pine) crashes his plane and is rescued by Diana. It's WWI and Trevor is an American spy working for the British. He had discovered that German General Ludendorff (Danny Huston) is developing a devastating new poison gas. Diana fears that Ares has returned to wreck havoc and journeys to kill a God. They travel to London where Sir Patrick (David Thewlis) is leading the peace effort.The DCEU was having problems. I wouldn't say that it is in any danger but it needed an unreserved win. This is exactly that. I was leery of the choice of Gal Gadot when it was first announced. Her English was barely understandable at the time and her acting was stiff. Her English has improved by leaps and bounds and her acting is also better. The genius of Patty Jenkins is to steer into her deficiencies. Patty fully embraces her sincerity and makes all the Amazonians have the same accent as her. It's a brilliant move.The other Patty brilliance is her emotional IQ. She understands human emotions better than anything in BvS. The best comparison is Martha and the double reveal of Steve's final conversation with Diana. Martha is a silly construction. The double scene is emotional heartbreak. The action is solid. The no-man's land fight is amazing. There is humor but not just the quippy Marvel humor. It is character-based and well-earned. It hits almost every note perfectly."
Paths of Glory,8,0,2,31 March 2015," One of the greatest anti-war movies
","It's 1916 France. General Georges Broulard convinces General Mireau to send his men on a suicide mission to attack the fortified Anthill. The men are worn out. General Mireau with glory in his eyes downplays the difficulties to Col. Dax (Kirk Douglas). He even threatens to relieve Dax when he gives less than full enthusiastic support. On a 3-person night patrol, drunken lieutenant Roget kills fellow soldier Lejeune and then falsifies the records despite Corporal Paris (Ralph Meeker). Dax leads the attack the next morning. The first wave is wiped out and the men refuse to continue the attack. Mireau court-marshals a man from each company for cowardice. Roget sends Paris as one of those men. Dax defends them in the kangaroo court.Stanley Kubrick creates one of the classic anti-war movies of all times. Its indictment was biting at the time and finds its glory by the opposition it faced. Kirk Douglas is at his heroic best. The vision is sharp. The story is poignant. The movie finds its target and doesn't let go."
Despicable Me,7,0,0,22 September 2013," The minions make all the difference
","Gru (Steve Carell) is a horrible villain. Horrible as in he's not that good at it. He's petty. And when he is overtaken by another villain, he finds that he's not up to taking on Vector (Jason Segel). When he couldn't break into Vector's home, he notice 3 orphans selling cookies got in. So what's a respectable villain's suppose to do? Adopt them of course as part of an evil plan.Gru is a weird character to like, and it's not that much fun to watch at first. His minions help a lot. Dr. Nefario (Russell Brand) is also good. But it's the 3 orphans causing all kinds of problem that makes it all alright. It's pretty good animation work. And there's a good story of how a bad guy learn to love. It has its funny moments and it has the minions."
Back to the Future Part II,9,3,4,14 October 2013," Time loop to revisit original movie creates incredible sequel
","This picks up right from where the first one ends. Marty, Doc and Jennifer goes to the future to help save his children in 2015. Only things go completely off the tracks when Biff in the future steals the DeLorean to change the past for his benefit.The time travel in this movie is even more complicated. It revisits the 1955 timeline actually make it work better. The scenes where he revisits the same time as the original is truly inventive. The great thing is that it combines with the original to make the whole series even better. It's seamless integration is what makes this sequel superior to any other sequels. It's a work of mathematical genius from Robert Zemeckis."
Carrie,8,4,5,2 November 2014," Sissy Spacek perfect
","Carrie White (Sissy Spacek) is an introverted isolated girl. She gets picked on by all the other girls. Her mother (Piper Laurie) is a crazy religious type who locks Carrie in the closet. Lead girl Sue Snell (Amy Irving) tries to make amends by getting her hunky boyfriend Tommy Ross (William Katt) to take Carrie to the senior prom. Chris Hargensen (Nancy Allen) refuses to take the punishment and is banned from the prom. Chris plans revenge on Carrie with the help of her boyfriend Billy Nolan (John Travolta). The plan triggers Carrie's supernatural powers.Director Brian De Palma makes this Stephen King story into a prom epic. The scene is iconic. However this movie is more than just one scene. This is about the great Sissy Spacek. She is absolutely perfect as the shy insecure Carrie. This is about her character. This is about the awkward years. This is a horror, a thriller and so much more."
Marriage Story,8,5,10,12 December 2019," divorce story
","Charlie (Adam Driver) and Nicole (Scarlett Johansson) are married with a young son. They're working on their divorce. She's an L.A. girl with a popular teen movie when she followed him to NYC. He becomes a well regarded theater director and she's his leading lady. She wants to return to L.A. to start a new TV show while he's bringing his show to Broadway. She hires divorce lawyer Nora Fanshaw (Laura Dern).There have been many divorce movies over the years. This is one of the better ones. It has a great opening which probably gaslighted me to this marriage. I kept hoping for reconciliation or at least, an easy peace. This gets to some dark places and it climaxes to a powerful scene in the motel room. The movie needs to wrap up a little quicker after that climatic fight. I would like some parts to go a different way but at the end of the day, this is Noah Baumbach's story. He probably drew some inspiration from his real life and who am I to judge. There are good laughs and there are devastating moments. It is a highlight of an interesting career."
The Queen,8,2,2,23 May 2014," Great Helen Mirren performance in compelling personal drama
","It's 1997. Tony Blair (Michael Sheen) and the Labour Party have just won a landslide victory. Then Princess Diane is killed in a Paris tunnel. The Queen (Helen Mirren) is reluctant to change any protocol. Prince Philip (James Cromwell) dismisses the tidal wave of grief. Blair tries to advise them despite their intransigence. Eventually the pressure becomes too overwhelming and the Royals must change with the times.There are two great performances in this. There is also an interesting personal drama within this international story. The death of a princess may not be important in the grand scheme of it all, but it provides a backdrop for a compelling personal drama. Michael Sheen seems to be the guy to play Tony Blair. He's great at it. Helen Mirren is exceptional. She brings both the stoic and the scared with such ease. She fully deserves the Oscar for best actress."
Blow,7,1,1,27 October 2014," rambling life story still very fascinating
","George Jung grew up in a poor struggling family in Massachusetts. He vows to never live that way. As a young man, he and his friend Tuna (Ethan Suplee) want to sell marijuana. Stewardess Barbara (Franka Potente) introduces them to a real dealer Derek Foreal (Paul Reubens). They grow their business with Barbara transporting for them. They even go down to Mexico to buy from the source. He gets arrested and Barbara dies from cancer. The group scatters. While serving time in Danbury, his cellmate Diego Delgado (Jordi Molla) connects him to the Medellín cocaine cartel. He starts smuggling cocaine and reconnects with Derek. He becomes the middle man between Pablo Escobar (Cliff Curtis) and cocaine dealing of Derek. At Diego's wedding, he meets his future wife Mirtha (Penélope Cruz). Eventually Diego discovers Derek's identity and double-crosses George.The movie is covering a lot of a big life. At times, it feels like the movie only scratches the surface. It's a lot of highlights or lowlights of a person. It would probably be more effective to narrow the focus to start from meeting Diego. The movie needs a partner or a foil for Johnny Depp to play against. Diego seems to be the natural choice and needs to be in the movie from beginning to end. Johnny Depp gives a compelling performance. It would be great if another character would loom just as large."
1408,7,0,2,9 March 2015," good haunted house movie
","Mike Enslin (John Cusack) is a cynical skeptic based in LA who writes about haunted hotels and other places. His first book holds some promising insights but he has settled into a rut. He is still haunted by a lost. He gets a postcard from Dolphin Hotel in NYC warning him against going to room 1408. It gets his attention but they won't book him in that room. He threatens to sue to get the room but hotel manager Gerald Olin (Samuel L. Jackson) still vehemently warns him not to stay in that room. The room seems ordinary at first except for a broken thermostat, a baby next door and a few odd stains. Then things start to happen. He tries to leave but he is trapped. He sees visions of past guests, his father, his wife Lily (Mary McCormack) and their daughter.This is essentially a haunted house movie. The setup is very nice. Samuel L. Jackson does a terrific job. The main missing element is another character to bounce Cusack off of. Compared to another King story-turn-movie 'The Shining', Nicholson has his family to act against. Cusack is able to do a great one-person show for the most part. The constant changing visions work well."
Raging Bull,10,3,5,1 August 2015," thing of beauty
","In 1964 New York, Jake La Motta (Robert De Niro) is an old overweight man preparing to perform. In 1941, Jake knocks out Jimmy Reeves but the bell saves him and Jake loses his first fight. Jake's brother Joey LaMotta (Joe Pesci) is in his corner. Back in the Bronx, he meets neighborhood girl Vickie (Cathy Moriarty) and he eventually marries her. He is a volatile man and is extremely jealous of any man who looks at her.Much of the praise has to be given to Martin Scorsese. His vision and his style is perfect. The black and white is beautiful. His cast is amazing. Joe Pesci is solid. It's amazing that he found the great Cathy Moriarty in her film debut. Then there is Robert De Niro. There are almost no words to describe his performance. He's lost in his animal intensity. There are no seams showing. He does not let up for one second. It's a thing of beauty."

He finds the giant who has lost its memory after its head gets dented. His single waitress mother refuses to believe his tall tale. Government agent Kent Mansley has arrived to investigate. Scrap metal artist Dean McCoppin is enlisted to help to feed the giant with scrap metal.Brad Bird has created a great family movie. It is touching story with a great message. It deals with very tricky subject matters and does it with tremendous skills. And it's a giant robot with a little boy. That's the dream of every little boy.
Taken 2,6,0,1,10 August 2013," slow start, still shoot 'em up
","Ex-CIA operative Bryan Mills (Liam Neeson) is on vacation in Istanbul with ex-wife Lenore (Famke Janssen) and daughter Kim (Maggie Grace). Obviously, somebody gets taken and all hell breaks loose.Liam Neeson is doing his grumpy bit again. Sure this is ridiculous escapism but it works as exactly that. The setup takes a bit of time. I guess they needed the time to introduce the ex and their relationship but it's wasted time that could be put to better use. It uses up all the good will of the surprise Neeson performance of the first movie. The first one was a good surprise. If you can park your brain in neutral, this film will be fine for you. There are some questionable occurrences. If you've seen the original, you know what to expect. Don't expect more."
Straight Outta Compton,8,6,27,19 June 2016," solid biodrama
","It's 1987. Ice Cube (O'Shea Jackson Jr.) and Dr. Dre (Corey Hawkins) are trying to put out reality rap. They get reluctant Eazy-E (Jason Mitchell) and they form N.W.A. Faded producer Jerry Heller (Paul Giamatti) helps Eazy-E create Ruthless. They sign with Bryan Turner at Priority Records. Suge Knight (R. Marcus Taylor) is a hustler always around. During their initial success, Ice Cube refuses to sign with Jerry and later decides to go on as a solo act. These young men rise out of the gang-infested, LAPD-harassed Compton to give voice to a new generation.There is a great energy surrounding this biopic. The actors are solid. The fact that I don't recognize them as actors make it easier for them to fade into the roles. Of course, the story is compelling. There seems to be a little bit of papering some parts of their history. That's perfectly expected especially with the participation of these artists. Without them, the movie wouldn't be made. Nevertheless, the story is still fascinating. The music is awesome. The last act is a bit slow. It could have trim some of that to intensify the ending. It may also be more compelling to end sooner. Overall, it's a solid watch."
Step Up,6,0,0,31 January 2014," Good enough dance movie
","Tyler Gage (Channing Tatum) is a foster kid who is stealing cars with his boys. One night, he breaks into an arts school and causes some vandalism. He gets caught and is sentenced to 200 hours of community service at the arts school. Director Gordon (Rachel Griffiths) runs the school. Nora Clark (Jenna Dewan) loses his dance partner with a sprain ankle and she pairs up with Tyler to practice for her big dance.The story is cheesy and simplistic but it has some hokey charm to it. The acting is all about Channing Tatum. He's got the arrogant charm of the lead character. Jeanna Dewan has a bit of vulnerability but not quite as compelling. For a dance movie, it has just enough goodness to embrace."
The Woman in Black,5,0,2,8 February 2014," Old fashion quiet horror without anything scary
","Arthur Kipps (Daniel Radcliffe) is a widower with a young son. His boss gives him one final chance in his job, and sends him to recently deceased elderly Mrs. Drablow's Eel Marsh House. He is to find and examine all of her papers especially her will. He soon learns there is a mysterious woman in black who threatens the local children.It's very old fashion. It's dark. It's foggy. It's slow. It's not good enough to be described as moody. Director James Watkins has made a quiet style horror. But as a horror, it completely fails or it is completely outdated. There is nothing scary here. Daniel Radcliffe is a fine actor. This is what horror used to be ... about 50 years ago. Even the most squeamish among us will be bored with this."
Mary and Max,9,3,6,15 January 2015," beautifully ugly
","In the tiny town of Mount Waverley in Australia, Mary Daisy Dinkle (Toni Collette) is a poor 8 years old friendless confused picked-on girl with an alcoholic mother and a cold father. She writes a letter to a complete stranger Max Jerry Horovitz (Philip Seymour Hoffman) in a Manhattan phone book. He's an overweight man who finds interacting with people confusing. He likes to eat chocolate hot dogs despite overeating anonymous. They begin a lifelong correspondent friendship as they struggle through their life.The dry off-center humor is quite effective. It does get some getting used to and this is not everybody's idea of comedy. The same goes for the beautiful ugliness of the black and white claymation. The story is so poignant and so touching. It gets to be quite heartbreaking and that song Perpetuum Mobile will always remind me of 'Mary and Max'."
Shrek,9,1,2,29 March 2014," Super fun family movie
","Shrek (Mike Myers) is a green ogre happily living alone. Lord Farquaad (John Lithgow) has rounded up all of the kingdom's magical creatures into Shrek's swamp. Shrek wants his isolation back. It doesn't help that he is now followed by the talkative Donkey (Eddie Murphy). Farquaad wants to have Princess Fiona (Cameron Diaz) so that he could be a proper king. So Farquaad strikes a deal with Shrek. If Shrek rescues Fiona, Farquaad will return Shrek his swamp.This is simply a super fun family movie. Shrek is an unconventional hero, and Fiona is an unconventional damsel in distress. It turns some of the superficial aspects of fairy tales on its head without straying from the emotional truths. In the end, they are all about finding true love. And this movie is a reminder of a funny Eddie Murphy that is too often missing in his recent movies."
Saints and Soldiers,6,0,0,6 February 2014," Smaller budget movie in need of bigger acting talents
","Four American soldiers escape after the Germans massacre POW early in the Battle of the Bulge. They rescue a British flyer who has important information. The five men try to return back to the Allied lines through hostile territories.It's a pretty simple story for most of the movie. The characters are written with some interesting personalities. However the actors can't exceed what's on the page. They just don't have the power to fill the screen. Corbin Allred probably comes the closest to something great. At the end of the day, this is a low budget affair. The big action scenes in the last 15 minutes probably ate up most of the money. It would be great to see some first rate actors take up these roles instead."
The Silence of the Lambs,9,2,4,5 December 2015," iconic villain
","Trainee Clarice Starling (Jodie Foster) is recruited right out of Quantico by Jack Crawford (Scott Glenn) of the Bureau's Behavioral Science Services. He's investigating serial killer Buffalo Bill who skins his female victims. He's interviewing imprisoned killers but Dr. Hannibal Lecter (Anthony Hopkins) refuses to cooperate. Starling is sent to talk to Lecter.Director Jonathan Demme takes the serial killer genre onto another level. It is brilliantly intense and brutal. It's a solid entry but then there is Hopkins' Lecter. It is an iconic villain for all times. From the moment he first appears, he steals the movie. It's rare that somebody can produce a character that is so original and so memorable. He is so impressive that he actually overshadows the penis-tucked human-skinning lotion-basket transvestite serial killer. Foster is also pretty solid. She brings a competence to the role that is needed for the outrageous villains to shine."
Vanilla Sky,6,1,3,5 October 2015," interesting confusion
","David Aames (Tom Cruise) is a vain publisher playboy in NYC. His friend Brian Shelby (Jason Lee) brings his date Sofia Serrano (Penélope Cruz) to a party and David finds the love of his life. Volatile ex Julie Gianni (Cameron Diaz) drives his car off a bridge to kill herself and disfigures his face. At a later time, he is wearing a mask in jail charged with an unknown murder as he recounts his story to psychologist Dr. Curtis McCabe (Kurt Russell).This is a confusing movie. I'm not sure Cameron Crowe is the guy to adapt this strange Spanish movie. I think it would be more compelling to have more of this movie to be dreamlike in a visually surreal way. Cameron Crowe is not a visual director. The empty streets of New York are an interesting way to start but he needs to do more. It is a pretty interesting confusing movie but something keeps bugging me about it. My take on the ending is coma but it could mean so many things."
X-Men: First Class,7,0,0,17 August 2013," good prequel reboot
","Fox decided to reboot the X-Men franchise with new actors as younger versions of the familiar roles. This prequel takes place mostly in 1962 before and around the Cuban Missile Crisis. It's a good start especially if the most important part of this exercise is to get good young actors to refresh the franchise. James McAvoy is the new Charles Xavier. Jennifer Lawrence is Mystique. Nicholas Hoult is Beast. Michael Fassbender is Magneto. With them as well as others, the franchise looks to be on solid grounds. As for this movie itself, it's a little bit slow at times. I think we're suppose to go weak in the knees every time a new actor for each iconic role is revealed. It's still great to see the new actors in action. They'll probably grow into their roles in the next movie. This is a solid starting point."
Fifty Shades of Grey,3,2,4,2 December 2015," wooden Grey, bad dialog, contract talk
","Mysterious billionaire Christian Grey (Jamie Dornan) is going to be the commencement speaker at Washington State University. English lit student Anastasia Steele (Dakota Johnson) takes her sick roommate Kate Kavanagh (Eloise Mumford)'s place to interview him for the school paper. He becomes completely taken with her.I had to bail on this movie after the first ten minutes. It's so flat that I couldn't take it. Jamie Dornan is an Abercrombie & Fitch model without the acting skills. Dakota Johnson is so fake mousy that it almost put me to sleep. I had to readjust my sensibilities to continue watching after a little break. The courtship is boring as hell. It has a passable rescue at a bar. Johnson has some comedic chops but she's playing with a blank partner. The dialog is laughably bad. However not everything is lost. There is some potential as the characters talk about submission. A real discussion about S&M could be sexy, edgy and compelling. Then the movie grinds down with contract talk. Nothing can be less compelling than a ten page agreement. All the edginess and sexiness go out the window. The sexual encounters have its fair share of nudity but it's not that shocking. It's simply boring. The final encounter does have a little more emotional content but that's too late to save this movie."
The Wolverine,7,3,5,31 May 2014," Improvement over X-Men Origins: Wolverine
","During WWII, prisoner Logan (Hugh Jackman) saved the life of Yashida when the bomb was dropped on Nagasaki. Now Yashida, on his deathbed, proposes to return the favor. Logan is haunted by the death of Jean Grey (Famke Janssen) promising never to inflict violence. Yukio (Rila Fukushima) retrieves Logan from America. She's a great warrior with the ability to see people's future deaths. Yashida tells him that he could transfer his immortality to another. Then he's attacked by Dr. Green/Viper (Svetlana Khodchenkova). Yashida's granddaughter Mariko (Tao Okamoto) is in danger and Logan steps in to save her.As often is the case with Wolverine, he starts off living in isolation. Going to Japan is a very interesting move for his character. His loner mentality is perfect there. I really like the first half. It has great action and some fitting humor. It also has good intrigue. The second half does take a break. I'm not impressed with Tao Okamoto's acting. She has one tone and her character lacks energy. On the other hand, I really like Rila Fukushima. She exudes energy and has more fun in her character. She's a good sidekick to Wolverine. The final battle do drag on a little too long. Overall, this has a good look, some good action, and a little bit of humor. Director James Mangold does a good job pulling it all together."

Terry Delfino (Bobby Cannavale) is his sketchy friend. Mike has been having panic attacks for a couple of months with his practice going under. He decides to take on guardianship of Leo Poplar (Burt Young) for the $1500 monthly commission when he can't find his daughter Cindy (Melanie Lynskey). Then Leo's grandson Kyle Timmons (Alex Shaffer) comes to live with him. Kyle is actually a great wrestler and it's a win-win situation. Kyle's mom Cindy is in rehab. Mike puts Leo in a home anyways.It's a slightly off-center indie. I wouldn't call it quirky. It's not necessarily funny. It needs to be darker to be a black comedy. The characters are likable. I wish Alex Shaffer has more charisma but at least he looks like he's a real good wrestler. It's a fine indie but it lacks a real edge. I love all the great actors here especially Giamatti. I just wish director Thomas McCarthy could bring out more power.
The Dark Knight Rises,8,1,2,5 August 2013," Anne Hathaway is a good Catwoman
","I'm writing this for one purpose and one purpose only. I know it's fashionable to hammer Anne Hathaway for her portrayal. But what do people expect from her exactly? Do they want her to puRRR constantly? Do they really expect her to camp it up? That would run contrary to Christopher Nolan's vision. No, she played it to the level of Nolan's vision. She's not camping it up. She's not playing it big. She injects fragility into the character that is very much in keeping with this iteration of Batman. She injects much needed humanity into this character.As for the movie, I have the same problem as the other 2. Too much explaining. That's why Heath Ledger's Joker is still the best. He did things just because he's crazy. No more explanation needed."
The Croods,8,0,0,9 October 2013," Touching Caveman Family Fun
","The Croods is a caveman family headed by Grug (Nicolas Cage). He avoids everything scary and they mostly hide in their cave. Only the daughter Eep (Emma Stone) isn't happy to be stuck in their cave. One night she wanders off and runs into Guy (Ryan Reynolds), a fire starting human. He's trying to escape the end of the world. Grug isn't happy but soon he finds himself slowly replaced as head of the family.This is a great family movie with a loving message. The family is full of love, and there really isn't an evil character unless you count the animals trying to eat the family. It's message is a great one of family love. The animation is colorful and well drawn. It is top of the line animation. The action is exciting. There is good humor and humanity in this. Everything works quite well. Good family fun."
Black Panther,8,21,45,4 May 2018," another solid hit
","To the outside world, Wakanda is a poor, isolated, reclusive kingdom in the center of Africa. In reality, it is a technologically advanced nation of five tribes through its use of vibranium from a crashed meteor. T'Challa (Chadwick Boseman) returns home to take over the throne after the death of his father in Civil War. He is after arms dealer Ulysses 'Klaw' Klaue who had previously stolen vibranium and caused mass Wakandan deaths. Klaw is working with Killmonger (Michael B. Jordan) who seems to have intimate knowledge of Wakanda. In 1992 Oakland, the former king killed his brother who assisted Klaw during the heist.Arguably, the MCU is the top box office franchise of today and it's nice for them to spread their influences into other niches of cinema. This is tackling some cultural aspects within the MCU superhero structure. All that is admirable but the question remains whether this is any good. The answer is that it's plenty good. First, Boseman is exceptional and projects a regal personality. The villains are great although I don't see the need of Killmonger working for Klaw. He should be killing him at first sight. There are a few things that concern me. The final battle feels obligational due to the superhero structure. The other great aspect is the women of Wakanda. They are all great. I also like the humor sprinkled among the action. It's not jokey but actually funny. The MCU is hitting on all cylinders and this is another solid hit."
Any Given Sunday,6,0,1,7 November 2013," Almost see the testosterone
","Willie Beamen (Jamie Foxx) is the third string quarterback on the losing Miami Sharks coached by Tony D'Amato (Al Pacino) and owned by Christina Pagniacci (Cameron Diaz). Injuries force Beamen to enter the game and surprise everybody with his performance.Oliver Stone is using his directing skills in this aggressive show of testosterone overload. That aggression never lets up and the result is a tiring experience. The extreme close up, the sharp cuts, the heart pumping action all drive the movie close to the edge and then over it. There is a lot to admire about Oliver Stone. Sometimes I wish he relax on the reins a little and let the story breathe. The other problem I have is that Al Pacino doesn't seem to do much coaching other than yelling and making speeches. He's a movie cliché. However, the cast is fill with top rank performers. They can outshout any problems with the characters."

Once back in the States, he moves his company to concentrate on arc reactor technology and stop weapons manufacturing.This is all RDJ. He and he alone makes Iron Man work. It's doubtful if anybody could have done it better. It's certain that he's made it next to impossible to replace him. Director Jon Favreau has built around him the dazzling array of tech fun, and Gwyneth Paltrow as his Girl Friday. It is RDJ's fast talking, quick wit, and personal history that makes him the perfect Tony Stark. Great character, fun movie."
Mother!,5,1,3,21 April 2018," premise distracts
","Mother (Jennifer Lawrence) is the young wife of a writer (Javier Bardem). He's struggling with writer's block. One day, he invites an orthopedic surgeon (Ed Harris) to the house. He's a stranger and mother is uncertain about him. Then his wife (Michelle Pfeiffer) shows up who insists on going to a forbidden room. More and more people shows up and chaos ensues.Darren Aronofsky has a great directing style. I admit that I know the premise of this movie before seeing it. That does influence the viewing experience. So I knew the meaning of the bone doctor immediately. The premise is very on the nose like a high school writing assignment. I wish this was a straight up haunted house horror. Aronofsky's style creates plenty of unease. Not giving the characters names added to this sense of unease. This has great mood but the premise is never far from the mind and that's distracting. Jennifer delivers terrific confused suppression. She's basically under constant emotional abuse. This would be a great personal horror if the surreal premise gets jettisoned."
Creed II,7,0,0,16 February 2019," Rocky IV Part deux
","Viktor Drago is training under his father Ivan Drago (Dolph Lundgren) in snowbound Ukraine. Ivan has lived in sad infamy ever since his loss to Rocky. To regain their family honor, they travel to Philadelphia to challenge newly crowned champion Adonis Johnson (Michael B. Jordan) who has been carefully managed by Rocky Balboa (Sylvester Stallone). Meanwhile, Adonis proposes to Bianca (Tessa Thompson).This is a rather simple idea. The franchise is revisiting Rocky IV and reconnecting with the old characters. In that way, I almost want to revisit that movie at the start with a few flashbacks. This time around, the most compelling characters may well be the Dragos. The best scene is Ivan surprising Rocky with a visit. I like Michael B. Jordan and I like him in this franchise. There are a couple of flat notes in a couple of scenes. His child's hearing test is one. I can accept his pushing the scene to the limit by crying although it would be more emotional if he stays stoic to please Bianca. He could force a fake smile for her until he can't anymore. The point is to transfer the emotional moment to the audience rather than to do a play by number cry scene. Another problem is the final fight. I can't buy him breaking his rib and almost immediately go Superman on Viktor. The rib punch is too much to come back from and Viktor switches from world beater to chump too quickly. Then there is Viktor himself. The size difference is overwhelming. There may be a way to use that but it would be much better to simply use a smaller fighter for Viktor. It's not like he's asked to do any real acting anyways. He's a machine. They should just find a smaller machine. There is also a need to set up Viktor's performance in the climatic fight much better. His montage shouldn't be his endless training with his father. His montage should be him partying and luxuriating in his victories. He should be caught by the siren calls of a Vegas lifestyle to the frustration of his father. That would explain his eventual collapse in the final fight as he runs out of fuel. Overall, this is really good although I would still make a few changes."
Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice,5,1,8,30 January 2017," many little problems
","This starts with the climatic 'Man of Steel' battle from the point of view of Bruce Wayne (Ben Affleck) as he runs into the destruction. Eighteen months later, Bruce as Batman has turned into the darkest of vigilante. Clark Kent (Henry Cavill) is investigating Batman while Superman is treated as either God or the ultimate threat. Lois Lane (Amy Adams) gets into trouble in Africa and Superman's rescue has raised questions about his omnipotence. Lex Luthor (Jesse Eisenberg) has gained access to Zod and the spaceship. He's looking to create anti-Superman weapons but Senator Finch (Holly Hunter) resists him. There is a new mystery woman (Gal Gadot) in the mix.Batman against Superman is a compelling idea which with a little finesse, should be a great story. The destruction of Gotham is a great starting point for Batman's distrust and hatred of Superman. Affleck in the midst of the destruction is a harrowing call back to 9-11. Instead of eighteen months later, Batman could be experimenting on ways to defend against aliens in the ruins of the city. The story is basically written already but for some reason, the various rewrites have mangled the story into a mess. Sticking Lex Luthor into the middle simply siphons out the intensity. The dialogue is also clunky. It may work better on a comic book page but it doesn't work when it comes out of the mouths of living, breathing people. More over, the editing is jagged. This could have been a comic book epic but there are too many little problems.EDIT: It took a couple of years but I finally got to the Ultimate Version. The extra thirty minutes allow the movie to breathe and the flow to be less jagged. The movie has all the pieces from the writing team of Terrio and Goyer. Instead of blaming all the many little problems on the disjointed editing, the plot is revealed to be full of conveniences, contrivances, and overblown melodrama. In a word, it is cartoonish which could fit a comic book movie. However, there is something more here. It took half the movie before I realized that this movie is written by the same self-important, conspiracy nuts who run their own YouTube channels. They know a lot of big words and big ideas but they string them together stretching logic to the breaking point to come to outrageous opinions disguised as common truths. It's a movie written by Lex Luthor with a crazy scheme that would never work in the real world.While I have ideas to restructure the whole movie, I do have one small change to fix one of the worst problems in the movie, the Martha conundrum. Superman should be saying, 'Save Martha Kent.' Nobody actually calls their mother by her name but Superman would say her full name so that Batman can have any hope to save her. Batman wouldn't be dumbfounded by the same name thing but he would still find the humanity in Superman that he would have a mother just like himself. If Martha gets fixed, at least the movie wouldn't be laughable. This version is better but it doesn't fix the deeper problems."
Tombstone,7,0,1,4 October 2014," Val Kilmer steals the show
","Tombstone, Arizona is a boom town from silver and is hounded by an organized gang called the Cowboys. It is led by Curly Bill Brocius (Powers Boothe). Johnny Ringo (Michael Biehn) is a cold-hearted killer. After success in Dodge City, Wyatt Earp (Kurt Russell) moves to Tombstone to find riches and a more simple life. He is joined by his brothers Virgil (Sam Elliott), Morgan (Bill Paxton), and close friend Doc Holliday (Val Kilmer). Despite having his wife Mattie there, he becomes infatuated with actress Josephine Marcus (Dana Delany). The Earps get into confrontations with the Cowboys which eventually leads to the shoot-out at the OK Corral.There are a lot of good actors as both good guys and bad guys. Kurt Russell may not be the most impressive of the lot but he does a solid job. Val Kilmer is really hamming it up. He steals the movie with his memorable performance. Other than him, this is a straight western without much comedy. It's not camp. If there is any problem, it's that the movie is too ambitious. There are a lot of characters. It tries to be grand. It's quite a western. It's slightly better than the even longer Lawrence Kasdan's Wyatt Earp which came out 6 months later."
The Emperor's New Groove,7,0,1,11 June 2016," short and fun
",Kuzco (David Spade) is an arrogant dictatorial Inca emperor. Pacha (John Goodman) is told that his village is being destroyed in favor for the emperor's new summer home. Yzma (Eartha Kitt) wants to rule instead. She and her dim-witted boy toy Kronk (Patrick Warburton) tries to poison Kuzco but it transforms him into a llama.David Spade's sarcastic comedy comes through. It's a pretty simple Disney cartoon. Its short length and thin story makes this more like an episode than a feature. It's fun but not that substantive. The main character learns to be good and the villain gets her comeuppance. The animation is not always that cinematic but the heights do give a bit of vertigo. This is a short and fun ride.
Blade Runner,9,2,5,19 March 2015," important sci-fi film
","Early in the 21st Century, the Tyrell Corporation advanced Robot evolution into the NEXUS phase known as Replicants. Replicants were used Off-world as slave labor, in the hazardous exploration and colonization of other planets. After a bloody mutiny, they were declared illegal on earth and Blade Runner units were created to retire trespassing Replicants. It's 2019 Los Angeles. Policeman Gaff (Edward James Olmos) brings in ex-blade runner Rick Deckard (Harrison Ford). Bryant (M. Emmet Walsh) orders him to track down four escaped Nexus 6 models. Roy Batty (Rutger Hauer) leads Zhora (Joanna Cassidy), Leon Kowalski (Brion James) and Pris (Daryl Hannah). Deckard goes to test the new Nexus 6 model by using the machine on Rachael (Sean Young). Dr. Eldon Tyrell (Joe Turkel) hasn't told her. The Replicants track down Hannibal Chew (James Hong) and J.F. Sebastian (William Sanderson) to meet Tyrell.I remember first seeing this on cable with the happy ending. It remains the version I like the most despite its inherit contradiction. I still like the shock of the green with the Vangelis music driving into the future. Also I like the voice-overs despite their detractors. I love the final voice-over during the happy ending which is eliminated in the final cut. In addition, I cannot abide by Deckard being a Replicant. This is great cyberpunk vision of the future. Its designs are still influential. I love the hard-boiled noir genre being married to a sci-fi movie. It does move slowly in the middle but I accept that flaw. It is meticulous and detailed visually. The Philip K. Dick story is compelling. It remains an important sign post in the sci-fi genre."
Bruce Almighty,6,0,0,9 November 2013," Jim Carrey vehicle
","Bruce Nolan (Jim Carrey) is a disgruntled small TV reporter in Buffalo. Everything seems to be going against him, and he rages against God (Morgan Freeman). To teach him a lesson, God endows Bruce with all his powers. Jennifer Aniston plays his girlfriend Grace Connelly.Jim Carrey's manic behavior can be quite grating. He's not that likable at the start. He is full of himself, and does too much complaining. Once he gets his powers, his attics are much more funnier. He and Jennifer Aniston are actually fun together.This movie is funnier as a premise. When you get down to it, Bruce is selfish. The constant referencing of 'It's a Wonderful Life' just reminds me how much nicer George Bailey is. Bruce is no George Bailey."
Mr. Holland's Opus,8,0,1,20 September 2013," Poignant film
","Mr Holland (Richard Dreyfuss) is a frustrated musician and composer. He is frustrated at his teaching job. It was supposed to be temporary to pay the bills. But the years pass, his life passes, and he feels he has achieved nothing. But what he discovers is that his life has meaning for all those he has touched over years.This is definitely one of those feel good movies. The individual stories are memorable. The feeling of lost palpable. The moment when he finally connects with his deaf child. That was powerful. All the stories are poignant. Richard Dreyfuss is perfectly suited as the old disillusioned teacher. It's a good cry movie all the way."
The Greatest Showman,7,5,11,8 March 2018," big broad Broadway
","Charity Hallett (Michelle Williams) and P.T. Barnum (Hugh Jackman) are childhood sweethearts and loving parents to two girls. As a child, his father worked as a lowly tailor for her wealthy family. After his father's death, he struggled to survive on the streets of New York. When they reached adulthood, Charity leaves the comforts of her family home for his love. He lies to a banker for the money to buy a wax museum. Eventually, he turns it into a circus of oddities. He recruits successful black sheep playwright Phillip Carlyle (Zac Efron) who falls in love with trapeze artist Anne Wheeler (Zendaya). He is desperate for high society approval and promotes high class singing sensation Jenny Lind (Rebecca Ferguson).This is a brash and broadest of Broadway musical. It is big and melodramatic. Obviously, Hugh is the perfect man for the job. This is a movie that knows what it is and is happy to play it to the fullest. Coming into this, my biggest fear is an easy lackadaisical treatment of historical facts. How big and broad this is actually helps to alleviating that fear. Nobody will mistake this for a documentary. It is to be taken as the lightest of entertainment with the broadest of emotions. I would have liked a reference to 'There's a sucker born every minute' even if it's not from P.T.'s mouth. Maybe I missed that in the movie. I like all the actors especially Jackman. It hits some great notes. I especially like the trapeze dance between Anne and Phillip. Mostly, I'm disappointed with the wooden acting from Ferguson. The most compelling part of her role is the on stage singing. I wonder if an actual singer would be infinitely more fitting. I simply don't believe her singing and the role doesn't ask much in terms of acting. Overall, it's a big musical and it doesn't want to be anything else."
Monsters University,8,0,0,24 December 2013," Great origins story
","This is the origins story of Mike Wazowski and James P. Sullivan whom we got to know in the 2001 movie. And it's a great origins story. Mike and Sulley start out as enemies. Mike has never been scary, but his goal hasn't changed since when he was a kid. He's 'Rudy'. He's the little guy with heart and drive. Then we have Sulley who's been living off on his family's reputation and his natural abilities. When they accidentally destroy Dean Hardscrabble (Helen Mirren)'s container, they are failed out of the Scare Program. They end up working together to get back in.The story is pulled from all those college movies like 'Revenge of the Nerds'. The big thing this movie has is heart. More than the first movie, we grow to love these guys and we see how they grow to love each other. This is even better than the original."
Ben-Hur,8,0,3,24 December 2014," Hollywood epic
","The movie starts with the birth of Christ in Bethlehem. In 26AD, Jesus is in Nazareth. Messala (Stephen Boyd) returns to his childhood home Jerusalem as the commander of the Roman garrison. He intends to bring order back to the restive province. His old friend Judah Ben-Hur(Charlton Heston) is a prince and richest man whose family used to rule Judea. However, Judah refuses to be Messala's informer. Simonides (Sam Jaffe) is a loyal family slave. His daughter Esther (Haya Harareet) is in love with Judah but she is betroth to another. During the arrival of the new governor, loose tiles fall from Judah's house injuring the governor. Vindictive Messala sees an opportunity to make Judah an example. Judah is turned into a slave and his mother and sister imprisoned. Judah is assigned to row Roman Consul Quintus Arrius (Jack Hawkins)'s flagship. Their ship is sunk and Judah rescues Arrius. Arrius is given credit for a Roman victory and he adopts Judah as his son. Eventually he goes home in search for his family and seek revenge on Messala. Still he's willing to forgive Messala if his family is restored. However Messala finds them as lepers in their cell and sends them away. Esther keeps their secret and lies to Judah that they're dead.This is an Hollywood epic for mostly good and a little bad. The bad is pretty minor. It's long and long-winded at times. It does get melodramatic and the acting can be very broad. For the subject matter, broad acting is somewhat appropriate. The movie always gets me when Jesus gives Judah water. It gets the epic arc of the story. The movie rises to the challenge. There are many amazing scenes but non grander than the epic chariot race. This is a movie where epic can't be used enough."
Casino Royale,8,2,5,28 November 2013," Reboot with a bang
","Daniel Craig stars in this reboot to the Bond franchise. The prologue sets the darker and grittier mood right away. It's black and white, and it's hard violence. Just in case you didn't get the message. The story goes pretty quickly to Daniel Craig jumping on giant cranes, in a crazy parkour chase. This is not your daddy's Bond.This Bond starts off as a brash guy who just got his double o designation. He's physical. The action is more visceral, not as much cartoon violence. Bond as a physical specimen is epitomized by the bikini shot. It's not a Bond girl that gets the big bikini reveal. It's Bond.The story does have a slowdown after the crane to pick up all the pieces of the story. Once it gets going again, and this time he doesn't stop. But it's not simply more action that's the difference from Pierce Brosnan. It's the rejection of all that is Bond cheese. The smirky tone, and the perfunctory womanizing are all gone.Mads Mikkelsen provides a good menacing foil. And Eva Green provides the proper love interest. However she comes in an hour into the movie and would be better to have more screen time. At least, she and Bond have good verbal exchanges with the time they have, and the movie really takes off. Bond is monogamous. Who knew?"
Toy Story 3,9,0,1,8 December 2013," The whole gang is back, and this time in the great escape
","Better than the second one, this one returns many more toys in this movie. The gang is mistakenly thrown out as trash when Andy is about to go to college. The toys escape just in time and decide to go to be donated to the daycare. It becomes clear that there is a dictatorship when the new toys are tricked into the more rambunctious toddlers room. Meanwhile Woody gets out of the daycare only to be taken by another kid.There are two things I love about this installment of the franchise. First is the fact that there are more toys, and the whole gang is around. The interactions and the comradery that was a little thin in the second installment. All of it is back. And Barbie gets Ken to go along with her.Second is the great escape concept. It really works for these toys. The danger has never been more compelling. The victory has never been more sweet. It's a great idea for the story."
Trainspotting,9,1,2,14 January 2015," unique wild ride
","Four Edinburgh friends Mark Renton (Ewan McGregor), Daniel 'Spud' Murphy (Ewen Bremner), Simon 'Sick Boy' Williamson (Jonny Lee Miller), and psychopath Francis Begbie (Robert Carlyle) are into the low life heroin addicted junkie world. Renton tries to quit with a couple of final rectal suppositories. He steals clean-cut friend Tommy MacKenzie (Kevin McKidd)'s sex tape with his girlfriend. He chases after Diane Coulston (Kelly Macdonald) from the club but he finds out that she's underage after sleeping with her. The guys go back to doing heroin. Even Tommy starts doing it after dumped by his girlfriend for losing the sex tape.Director Danny Boyle gives a flashy, densely-packed, dark and hilarious vision of the drug life. It is disturbing and funny, sometimes at the same time. It doesn't promote drug use despite some criticism to that fact. The grim and ugliness should dissuade people from using. It is a wild ride and something unique."
Ice Age: Dawn of the Dinosaurs,6,1,1,24 November 2013," kiddie franchise settling in
","Manny (Ray Romano) and Ellie (Queen Latifah) are expecting a baby. Diego (Denis Leary) is having trouble and decide to leave the herd. Sid (John Leguizamo) finds 3 dinosaur eggs and starts his own family. When the dinosaur mom returns and takes Sid, the gang reunites to rescue him.It was never a movie of accurate biological history, but now they've added dinosaurs. It wouldn't be a big deal except the little kids probably don't know any better. The dinosaurs are kinda scary which makes the action in this movie much more frightening and much more exciting.There are now more and more characters. The new one in this movie is the one-eyed weasel Buck (Simon Pegg), a hermit living in an underground Dinosaur oasis. He's an interesting character but I wonder if the gang is getting too crowded. The franchise keeps going, and is still worthwhile for the little kids."
Space Jam,5,1,4,22 June 2015," Michael Jordan and Bugs Bunny
","Michael Jordan is playing baseball and really sucks at it. Swackhammer is the owner of the amusement park planet Moron Mountain and he needs new attractions. His underlings arrive on Earth to take Bugs Bunny and the rest of the gang back as prisoners. Bugs trick the tiny aliens into playing basketball for their freedom. However the aliens steal the talents of the greatest NBA star to become basketball monsters. While playing golf with Bill Murray and Larry Bird, Jordan is taken by Bugs to join their team.One has to compare and contrast this to 'Who Framed Roger Rabbit'. There is no excuse for this but the animation looks cheaper. There is some CGI but it's in its early form. It looks like a 90s TV cartoon and doesn't really hold up. There is a more timeless quality about Roger Rabbit. Then there is Jordan. This is very much a vehicle for Jordan but it doesn't make him a good actor. There is really no acting in this. As a pop artifact, it's kind of interesting to see but it's not a good movie. It's mostly for kiddie Jordan fans back in the day."
La Vie En Rose,7,1,2,19 November 2016," Cotillard amazing
","This is a biopic of Édith Piaf (Marion Cotillard) told in a non-linear manner. The movie starts with her collapsing during a 1959 New York performance. She is a young girl crying in the streets of 1918 Paris. Her father is away at war and her singing mother abandons her. He returns home to take the sick Édith away to his mother who runs a brothel in Normandy. She is befriended by maternal hooker Titine. His father returns again to take her away to work in the circus. They quit the circus and she starts singing in the streets. Nightclub owner Louis Leplée (Gérard Depardieu) hires her giving her the name Piaf until his murder. This is a low point as the public turns against her and she is forced into a convent by her mother. Next, she is in post-war New York falling for boxer Marcel Cerdan. It is a troubled exuberant life of ups and downs.Marion Cotillard is incredibly powerful acting this wild life. She delivers on every point. It's a masterful performance. The movie itself is a long-running biopic. The story isn't able to distill into a simple idea. It's a lot of sections and vignettes. The most controversial and powerful should be her years in occupied Europe working under Nazi rule. Oddly, the movie seems to skip over that important part of her life. Maybe, there are uncomfortable rumors that the movie refuses to touch. Overall, Cotillard is so powerful that any problems fade into the background."
Bull Durham,8,4,6,14 July 2014," Best comedy about professional baseball
","It's the professional pitching debut of Ebby Calvin 'Nuke' LaLoosh (Tim Robbins) for the A ball Durham Bulls. He has a million dollar arm and a five cents head. They bring in veteran catcher Crash Davis (Kevin Costner) to mentor the young pitcher. Only he's too old for this stuff. Annie Savoy (Susan Sarandon) is a baseball philosopher and team super fan. Every year, she picks one player to hook up with and guide. Much to Crash's dismay, she picks Nuke.This is a funny and charming baseball movie. It's got Kevin Costner's great 'I believe in...' speech. It's also got all the inside baseball interior-voice and behind-the-glove fun. It loves baseball both in its grandness and the little things. It romanticizes the game as well as its sad lowly grind. It's probably the best comedy movie about professional baseball."
Before Sunrise,8,1,1,9 April 2015," refreshing first date
","American tourist Jesse (Ethan Hawke) meets French student Celine (Julie Delpy) on the train. He talks her into getting off and walk around in Vienna. They walk the night away.I really love this movie when it first came out. There was no hint of the following sequels. It's just a great charming first date movie. The leads have great chemistry. They are both charming and lovely. This is a lot of first-date talk. It doesn't get tie down by artificial plot elements. There is nothing to drive the plot. There is no Holy Grail. There is no quest. There is no destination. There are just two people talking and trying to connect. It stops and starts. They meet two oddly funny Germans who invite them to their play. In a more conventional movie, they would actually go to this play. They forget to go and that's kind of the point. Their journey meanders without much direction. There are also great scenes of long continuous takes. Director Linklater just let the actors go on forever on the streetcar. The whole movie feels refreshing."

Bo thinks something is wrong with the water and puts glasses of water everywhere. Then aliens invade.There is no doubt that M. Night Shyamalan is a good technical director. He creates some great tension. He peppers the movie with little comedic moments. It's a great little non-explosion filled alien invasion movie. It's a tense fun little horror movie. And then the reveal happens. The movie goes into disbelief. Honestly I try to excuse it from time to time but there are no excuses. Somebody must have noticed the problem but I guess nobody was willing to challenge Shyamalan back in the day."

Juan immediately propositions them. Cristina is interested, but Vicky is incensed over his presumptuousness. As the two girls travel with him, their trio is turned into chaos by the wild Maria Elena (Penélope Cruz).Woody Allen has created one of his most fascinating films outside of New York. There is only one problem; The Voice Overs. It doesn't stop. It drowns out the film. I don't even know why Woody thought it's a good idea to constantly unceasingly drone on and on and on. And is there anybody less interesting doing narrations? It sucks out the passion in the film.Rebecca Hall and Scarlett Johansson were good at their particular roles. Javier Bardem is extremely fascinating and seemingly so realistic getting beautiful women with his confidence. But Penélope Cruz blows everybody away."
Sweet and Lowdown,3,4,8,30 May 2014," Just not my thing
","During the Great Depression, Emmett Ray (Sean Penn) is arguably the second best jazz guitarist in the world who is in awe of the best jazz guitarist Django Reinhardt. He's also a bad pimp, likes to shoot rats at the dump, and generally a bad human being. He connects with the lovely mute Hattie (Samantha Morton). He verbally abuses her constantly. Then he runs off on her. He meets and marries Blanche Williams (Uma Thurman).There are a lot of things I don't particularly like in this movie. I don't like Woody Allen's style of mockumentary. I don't find it funny whereas others like Christopher Guest do it better. I don't like jazz. I don't care about much of the music here. I really don't like Emmett Ray. I find him an annoying jerk. I really can't stand him. After Hattie disappeared from the movie, it becomes unwatchable to me. She's the only truly fascinating character in the movie. This is a well made Woody Allen movie. It's just not my thing."

Beca (Anna Kendrick) quits her music producing job. Emily (Hailee Steinfeld) invites the girls to a performance but she's actually leading the new Bellas and the girls are simply audience. Desperate to sing together again, Aubrey (Anna Camp) uses her estranged father's military connection to get into the USO. They travel to Europe where they are in competition to be the opening act of DJ Khaled. Calamity (Ruby Rose) leads their main competitors. Fat Amy (Rebel Wilson) is pursued by her estranged Fergus (John Lithgow).At least, the gang is back and that's half the battle. Their group chemistry is the heart and soul of this franchise. Beca and Fat Amy have a great back and forth relationship. However, Fat Amy's ridiculous story is not funny and her gimmick gets less fun especially without Beca. This is a collapsing franchise. Like others before it, this one goes over to Europe to speed up the decline. The writing is clunky and a throwback to bad sequel writing. It's weak and cliche in a bad way. Trying to be an action camp is probably a wrong move. It might work as a Bond spoof if it dives in head first. This simply doesn't work other than the girls' group relationships."
Elizabeth: The Golden Age,6,1,1,10 April 2014," Cate Blanchett is still great, but the movie is not so much
","It's 1585. An older Queen Elizabeth (Cate Blanchett) navigates royal court intrigue and international affairs. Sir Walter Raleigh (Clive Owen) is the new man in her life with years of raiding Spanish gold. Spain is preparing to invade with its Armada, and Elizabeth is threatened by hidden dangers.Cate Blanchett returns to play an older Elizabeth from her amazing turn in 'Elizabeth' (1998). She has taken on the personality of the Queen. She has the presence of royalty. The story isn't as compelling as the earlier movie. It doesn't have the same intensity. It's more about the costumes and less about the drama. The Spanish Armada could have been a great counter supplying the movie with much needed action. There is far too little of it, and most of it end up being less than exciting. Cate Blanchett is still great but the movie isn't as great as the actress."
The Deer Hunter,9,0,3,30 January 2016," great war movie without the big war action
","It's 1967. Best friends Mike Vronsky (Robert De Niro), Steven Pushkov (John Savage), Nick Chebotarevich (Christopher Walken) work at the local mill in an industrial Pennsylvanian town in a Russian-American community. Steven marries his girlfriend Angela pregnant with another man's baby. Mike is in love with Nick's girlfriend Linda (Meryl Streep). Nick asks Linda to marry him. The friends are heading off to the patriotic Vietname war. Mike promises Nick not to leave him there. In Vietnam, the men are captured by the Viet Cong and forced to participate in a Russian Roulette game.This is a great war home-front movie. One cannot beat De Niro and Walken and Streep. The detailed extended Michael Cimino style is effective in giving a lived-in feel to the movie. The Russian Roulette is the most controversial aspect. I think it is the shock that sends this to another level. It encapsulates the desperation and the randomness of war. It is the perfect metaphor for war."

","Psychiatrist Malick (Alfred Molina) is treating mass murderer Malcolm Rivers. It's the night before his execution and he's being transported to a hearing to determine his sanity. Meanwhile another part of the movie centers on an isolated motel. It's a torrential rainstorm in the middle of the night. George York (John C. McGinley) brings in his injured wife Alice (Leila Kenzle) and finds motel manager Larry (John Hawkes). Ed (John Cusack) the chauffeur distracted by spoiled actress Caroline Suzanne (Rebecca De Mornay) had run her over after the Yorks broke down by the side of the road. Con woman Paris (Amanda Peet) hit a telephone pole and knocks out the land line. The motel is cut off by flooding. Lou (William Lee Scott) and Ginny (Clea DuVall) are newlyweds as well as corrections officer Rhodes (Ray Liotta) who is transporting a prisoner (Jake Busey) are also stranded at the motel. The prisoner escapes and people starts dying.The movie starts out as two related stories of a escaped killer. That is something a little bit off about the scenario but it's never quite obvious. For example, the movie doesn't need to go back to Dr. Malick if this is a simple slasher flick. The characters are all a bit specific. The total isolation seems too convenient. The movie seems to be a good B-movie with a lot of solid actors for the first two acts. Then it becomes something even more."
Saving Mr. Banks,7,2,5,21 October 2014," Emma Thompson does a good job
","Walt Disney (Tom Hanks) is turning his favorite book 'Mary Poppins' into a movie. The problem is that the stubborn author P.L. Travers (Emma Thompson) is unwilling to comprise on anything. Script writer Don DaGradi (Bradley Whitford), musical writers Robert Sherman (B.J. Novak) and Richard Sherman (Jason Schwartzman) must suffer under her unbending will. Her driver Ralph (Paul Giamatti) tries to befriend her. Travers is not actually upper class British as everybody assumed but a little girl from Australia. Her parents Travers (Colin Farrell) and Margaret Goff (Ruth Wilson) had many problems. Then one day, aunt Ellie (Rachel Griffiths) comes to help the family.It's a movie that has trouble early on when Travers is annoyingly stubborn. Scenes where a bit of comedy could be injected is inevitably deaden by her meanness. It would help if an early scene could show her suffering and therefore justify her harshness towards others. It's not simply that she is stiff and proper. That could actually be funny. There is an anger in her that needs justification. Once it digs properly into her past, she becomes more human and her character becomes more compelling. Emma Thompson does a good job especially since her character does have changes. Tom Hanks should add a bit more sour to the sweetness of his Walt Disney. The rest of the cast all do a solid job. This movie tries to straddle a more serious story with its Disneyfied version and it does it as well as expected."
Jojo Rabbit,9,3,5,22 February 2020," one of year's best
","It's WWII and Germany is losing the war. 10 year old Jojo Betzler (Roman Griffin Davis) can't tie his own shoes and has an imaginary friend in Hitler (Taika Waititi). He is starting Hitler youth training under weary war veteran Captain Klenzendorf (Sam Rockwell). He refuses to kill a rabbit and the guys ridicule him as Jojo Rabbit. One day, he finds a girl living in the wall of his late sister's room. His mother Rosie (Scarlett Johansson) is hiding Jewish girl Elsa (Thomasin McKenzie).This is an inventive film. It is feel-good and heart-breaking. It has comedy and tragedy. It is an outside-the-box, brilliant film from the unusual Taika Waititi. The kid is brilliant. The best friend is funny. ScarJo is terrific. There are some big-time emotional gut punches. There are surprising turns. This is one of the year's best."
Beowulf,7,1,2,23 February 2014," Motion capture CGI getting better
","Based on the epic poem, King Hrothgar (Anthony Hopkins) is attacked by monstrous troll Grendel (Crispin Glover). He offers a reward of half of the kingdom's gold and Beowulf (Ray Winstone) comes to answer the call. He finds not just Grendel, but his mother (Angelina Jolie) as well.Director Robert Zemeckis is using his motion capture CGI technology once again. It is a big improvement over 'Polar Express'. However the faces still lack a certain amount of life. Their eyes are still doll-like, but it's getting much better. This movie doesn't really answers the question of why. Other than a couple of interesting scenes, the movie could have easily been done better with live actors.As for the story, it lacks a character to root for. The dialog is so stiff. The movie needs an antagonist more compelling than a muscle bound screaming hero. Nevertheless, the advancement in movie technology should be praised."
Fantastic Mr. Fox,7,1,2,8 September 2013," Claymation Wes Anderson style
","Mr. Fox decides to end his wild days by doing one last raid. He plans an elaborate raid on farmers Boggis, Bunce and Bean.Wes Anderson brings his sense of filmmaking to claymation. He doesn't comprise any on the his visual, his color palette, and his language. There's no mistake that this is all Wes Anderson. The story isn't of much consequence. The dialog is filled with the dry wit that Wes Anderson is known for. The camera style on shooting head on remain even thought it's animation. Add to it, Wes has enticed the voice talents of all his famous friends including George Clooney, Meryl Streep, Bill Murray, and Jason Schwartzman. George is especially effective as the suave Mr Fox. It's interesting to see Wes Anderson try something different. However I don't this medium fits him that well. His style is already very static. The restriction of animation really decreases the emotional effectiveness of actors especially this type of claymation."
Speed,8,1,2,27 September 2013," uncredited Joss Whedon script doctoring shines through
","A psychopathic bomber (Dennis Hopper) is extorting the city. He has rigged an elevator full of people to plummet. Young brash cop Jack Traven (Keanu Reeves) and his steady partner Harry Temple (Jeff Daniels) foil the bomber's plan in a nick of time. Then the bomber blows up a bus, and tells Traven that he will blow another one. When the bus hits 50 mph, the bomb will arm and explode if it slows below 50. The driver gets shot and Annie Porter (Sandra Bullock) has to take over. The premise is simple to understand. It's visceral and easy. But it's all about the fun dialog from Joss Whedon. It's snappy and fun. Sandra Bullock is the perfect conduit to put all those exchanges. At the start, Jeff Daniels and Keanu Reeves have that great chemistry. Then they switch it to Sandra. The writing really puts it over the top of just another good action thriller."
Son of Saul,8,0,3,15 August 2016," harrowing unrelenting horrors
","It's October 1944 Auschwitz-Birkenau. Saul Ausländer is a Hungarian Jew working as a Sonderkommando member. They clean up the gas chamber, clear the bodies, and collect the prisoners' belongings. One boy manages to survive the gassing. The Nazi doctor suffocates the boy and orders an autopsy. Saul steals the body and tries to recruit a rabbi to give the boy a proper burial.This is a harrowing tale. It is unrelenting and unforgiving. The point of view camera style takes the audience right into the horrors. It gives the audience a front row seat. One could almost smell the sick in the gas chamber. This movie takes hold and never lets go."
Live Free or Die Hard,7,2,3,5 October 2013," Great big action
","Somebody has hacked the FBI Cyber-Security Division and FBI Deputy Director Miguel Bowman has ordered a round up of all the hacker suspects. He doesn't care that nobody's working the weekend, and gets local police to do the sweep. John McClane (Bruce Willis) is set to take Matt Farrell (Justin Long) in when somebody tries to kill him.Director Len Wiseman (Underworld) brings us the 4th installment of the Die Hard franchise. It's all action from start to finish. The action is big time shoot them up, real stunts, and CG extravaganza. No short cuts are taken with the explosive overproduced movie. John McClane is back with an even bigger bang. Justin Long has a few jokes as the fast talking computer geek. But all the computer talk doesn't really fit the Die Hard franchise. Like John McClane, Die Hard just doesn't do computers. Just for a personal touch on the story. This time around, the bad guys have kidnapped his daughter Lucy Gennaro Not McClane (Mary Elizabeth Winstead)."
X2: X-Men United,7,0,1,21 September 2013," Good follow up
","The group is back. Magneto is still imprisoned. This time a mutant called Nightcrawler (Alan Cumming) tries to kill the president. In response, the government under the help of William Stryker (Brian Cox) institute more draconian measures to control the mutant population including attacking Professor X's school.Alan Cumming is doing a fun character. The plot gets complicated with double dealing and cross currents but still easily followed. It's a good sophomore follow up in the franchise.It's almost a prerequisite to have all hell break loose after the happy ending to the first movie. So the first half of the movie is to bring everything down. Once the whole lot is destroy, then they can come back to save the day. This time the bad guy is Stryker and even Magneto is there to join the fight. It's a perfectly fine follow-up."
The Ringer,1,1,3,5 May 2015," uncomfortably unfunny
","Steve Barker (Johnny Knoxville) goes to his boss to ask for a promotion. His first job is to fire the janitor Stavi. He can't bring himself to do it and instead hires him to mow his lawn. Stavi accidentally cuts off his finger and Steve needs $28k to get it reattached. His sleazy uncle Gary (Brian Cox) comes up with the idea to fix the Special Olympics. Gary wants him to pose as mentally challenged to beat the pentathlon champ Jimmy Washington. He falls for event organizer Lynn Sheridan (Katherine Heigl).The start is pretty weak with a wishywashy lead character. I don't think Knoxville is particularly good at playing that character. Katherine Heigl is fairly wooden in this. Knoxville pretending to be slow is par for the course for most of his movies. None of these problems mean the end of the world. I actually like the real handicap actors in this. The biggest problem I have are all the actors acting as mentally handicap. It feels demeaning and fake. Unless they are trying to be Dustin Hoffman doing Rain Man, this was never going to work. They are better off simply getting real handicap actors to do the roles. Even if they can't quite say the lines, they could concentrate the acting to the few that seem to do good work. It's kind of insulting. It's uncomfortable. It's not funny. I just keep thinking that Knoxville is suppose to be stupid and funny for faking a mental handicap. Yet there are all these other actors who are actually faking mental handicap and the audience has to take them seriously."
Thor: The Dark World,8,3,5,24 August 2014," great fun and exciting superhero movie
","Dark Elves are an ancient nemesis to Asgard. Their leader Malekith (Christopher Eccleston) tried to use Aether to send the universe into darkness. In a great battle, the Dark Elves were routed, Malekith managed to escape and Asgard buried the Aether beyond use. It's many years later in the present day. Loki (Tom Hiddleston) is imprisoned. Thor (Chris Hemsworth) is fighting to bring order back to the nine realms. Jane Foster (Natalie Portman) is alone on Earth since Thor left her in New Mexico 2 years ago. She's now in London with her intern Darcy Lewis (Kat Dennings) who in turns has her own intern. Erik Selvig (Stellan Skarsgård) has gone a little crazy and very naked. Jane is doing research on an anomaly which Asgard and the Dark Elves call Convergence. She gets sent through a wormhole to Svartalfheim where she's impregnated with all the Aether. Thor brings Jane back to Asgard despite Odin (Anthony Hopkins)'s disapproval.This is a lighter and jokier affair. Its broad jokes delivered mostly by Kat Dennings playing the traditional best friend rom-com role to Natalie Portman. Portman continues to be a weak point in this franchise. It's more her Jane Foster character who really lacks consistent chemistry and reason for their love affair. This is a love that spans the universe and I can't explain it other than they're both played by really gorgeous human specimens.The best parts are that the world of Asgard is expanded more. It's not just a set but a real place now. The movie gives a real sense of it. Also Thor and Loki expands their relationship. Their brotherly rivalry is deeper this time and Loki is set to become a big Marvel character in the future. Malekith is a slight disappointment as the villain. Quite frankly, all the usual fun villainy characteristics are given to Loki while Malekith is merely a one dimensional plot device. Malekith is really only a secondary character and maybe that's a good thing. The battles are great. The final battle is thrilling with a lot of fun. That's how I would describe the movie as a whole."
Lucy,6,2,7,21 April 2015," Fun action thriller turns into mumbo jumbo
","Lucy (Scarlett Johansson) is studying in Taiwan. Her new friend Richard tricks her into delivering a suitcase. It's filled with a new synthetic drug CPH4. She is kidnapped by kingpin Mr. Jang and forced to be a drug mule surgically inserted into her abdomen. She is kicked by her abductor and the drug seeps into her system. Professor Norman (Morgan Freeman) has a theory about the human mind. Most use only 10%. The drug opens up Lucy's mind turning her into a superhuman as she uses more and more of her brain. With the help of Paris police detective Pierre Del Rio, she tracks down the drug from the other mules and contact Norman to transcend her humanity.This starts off as a fun action thriller filled with inventive Luc Besson touches. Johansson is good transitioning from victim to machine-like superbeing. I like going to a lesser used exotic location like Taiwan. However Besson tries to be profound. It descends into a lot of mumbo jumbo. At which point, I realize the whole movie is a lot of scientific mumbo jumbo. It wouldn't matter so much but Besson seems to really want to say something. He ends up saying nothing."
Amélie,9,1,4,11 December 2015," charming and whimsical
",Amélie Poulain (Audrey Tautou) is a Parisian waitress. She doesn't have a boyfriend living a rather solitary life finding joy in small pleasures. Her distant and cold doctor father diagnosed her with a heart problem. She's forced to be home-school by her nervous mother. She finds a tin box hidden in her wall and goes on a journey to find the boy who left it there.This movie exudes charm. Paris has a magical veneer. I love all of the whimsy. It's childlike and also adult nature. Audrey Tautou is enchanting with her big doe eyes. Even the color saturation gives this a surreal feel. This has an unique feel that enchants the audience.
Moonrise Kingdom,7,1,2,27 August 2013," Started strong but fades a little, still great
","It's the 60s on a New England island. Sam Shakusky is attending Camp Ivanhoe. He falls for Suzy Bishop who lives on the island with her parents. The two awkward outsider teens run away setting off chaos among the other characters.This is Wes Anderson's movie all the way through. There is no mistaking his style. He is now as recognizable as any film style ever made. Everything is set up for a good flowing story. They have a dangerous storm bearing down on them. People are out looking for them. But then they're caught midway thru the movie.It detours a bit after that. The pace slows and the story rambles on. It's still very compelling, but it could have been much simpler and better. The kids are great. We have Bruce Willis, Edward Norton, Bill Murray, Frances McDormand. There are big time stars and they are all solid in their roles. Overall a very good job."
The Sixth Sense,10,0,1,7 September 2015," one of the greatest reveals of all time
","Child psychologist Malcolm Crowe (Bruce Willis) celebrates an award win with his wife Anna (Olivia Williams). Deranged ex-patient Vincent Grey (Donnie Wahlberg) breaks in and shots Malcolm. Vincent then commits suicide. The next fall, Malcolm is treating distressed Cole Sear (Haley Joel Osment) who lives with his single mom Lynn (Toni Collette). His suffering leaves him an outcast at school. After another episode leaves him in the hospital, he tells Malcolm his secret that he 'sees dead people'.This is one of the best reveals in movie history. It's not simply a shocking twist. Anybody can write a random twist that aims to shock people. This twist is well-planned and constructed from the first moments of the film. Shyamalan lays out not only clues but the right amount of clues. It is a twist that people are unlikely to foresee but then beat themselves for not forseeing it. He gets the perfect balance.The other question is whether this is a good movie without the twist. The great thing is that the intensity does not rely on the twist. HJO has the perfect wise innocence quality. It has great creepiness. It's a traditional ghost story and a well made one. The intensity ramps up as the ghosts reveal themselves. This would be one of the great horrors even without the twist."
The Producers,8,0,1,15 May 2014," Love Love Gene Wilder
","Max Bialystock (Zero Mostel) used to be a big producer but is now scamming old ladies out of their money. Meek accountant Leo Bloom (Gene Wilder) is sent to work on his books. As Leo work on the books, he stumbles onto a scheme to steal with a horrendous flop. Max jumps on it right away and convinces Leo to go along. They find the completely inappropriate 'Springtime for Hitler' written by Nazi sympathizer Franz Liebkind (Kenneth Mars).I like Zero but I LOVE Gene Wilder. Cough! Cough! My Blue Blanket! Gene is insanely hilarious. It is so uniquely high strung Gene. Zero's mass and energy is the perfect thing to set Gene off. Mel Brooks has some great material here. He is also lucky to have such genius original actors to bring it over the top. It's a comedy that holds up to multiple viewings. That's probably the toughest achievement for any comedy."
Star Wars: Episode VII - The Force Awakens,8,45,111,20 December 2015," The Return of Star Wars
","It's over 30 years since the defeat of the empire. The Republic is threatened by the First Order led by Kylo Ren (Adam Driver) under the control of Supreme Leader Snoke (Andy Serkis). The resistance led by General Leia Organa (Carrie Fisher) is fighting the Dark Side. Finn (John Boyega) is a conflicted stormtrooper. Rey (Daisy Ridley) is a scavenger on the planet Jakku. Poe Dameron (Oscar Isaac) is the Resistance ace pilot.It has been over 30 years since the last truly good Star Wars movie. It is a great reboot and a solid repair job to the damage from the prequels. The biggest complaint seems to be that this is a repeat of A New Hope. If anything, this is pulling out scenes and references from all three originals. I have no problems with that. In fact, it's good to go back and take pages out of the original trilogy. Even the force is explained more in the traditional way. However, this is not a simple repeat. The new characters are tremendous. John Boyega and Daisy Ridley are amazing additions. He's an interesting character and I love their initial meeting. I love him keep grabbing her hand. There are some minor problems but they're too minor to mention especially considering the spoilers. I rank 'The Empire Strikes Back' (1980) the best, 'A New Hope' (1977) second, and I may squeeze 'The Force Awakens' slightly ahead of 'Return of the Jedi' (1983). Forget the prequels.P.S. In this one, nobody loses a lightsaber fight because of elevation."

","After her father's death, Cinderella lives under her cruel stepmother Lady Tremaine and her two mean daughters Drizella and Anastasia as their servant. She is kind to the small animals as they avoid Tremaine's cat Lucifer. The King is impatient for his only son to settle down. He arranges for a grand ball so that the prince may choose a bride. Cinderella is eager to attend. Tremaine promises to let her go if she finishes her chores and find a dress. They keep her busy so the little animals help her fix up her mother's gown. However, the stepsisters destroy the gown and she's left behind. Her fairy godmother comes to the rescue but her spell will be broken at midnight.The subject is a little old fashion but it is still plenty of fun. Cinderella is more pro-active than Snow White. She is a compelling character. She is kind-hearted and hard-working. The animals add a lot to this. The first half relies heavily on the mice. The music is light and fun. The songs are memorable. It's an iconic Disney animation and loads of fun overall."
RED,7,0,0,6 October 2013," Mary-Louis Parker best part of the movie
","Frank Moses (Bruce Willis) is a retired CIA operative living out his life in a nondescript suburb. He is what's considered RED (Retired Extremely Dangerous). His only joy comes from calling his pension call center rep Sarah Ross (Mary-Louis Parker). He actually ask her out, but then a team of expert soldiers comes to kill him.The best part of the movie is Parker's indignant response to Bruce Willis kidnapping her. She's the best part of the movie. It's the part of the movie that they need to keep at its center.Bruce Willis is playing the cool detached persona. It doesn't make for an energetic character. It's cool to see for awhile especially when he's teamed up with Parker. But her character's role diminishes as more old timers get rounded up.The action is over the top as expected. Other than who however, there isn't much to distinguish this cartoon action from all the other cartoon action."
Flight,7,2,4,31 August 2013," exciting start, slow middle, satisfied ending
","This starts off with an exciting first 30 minutes. It's like the climax of an action movie. Then they slow it way down as we discover that captain Whip Whitaker (Denzel Washington) is actually an incredible drunk.The change in pace is pretty jarring. And Denzel is not that likable in this movie. The good news is that the movie does get to an emotional climax. Denzel's acting is its usual first rate. The action at the beginning is really exciting, and the ending is satisfying. The middle is where they needed to pick up the tension. That was always going to be difficult with such an exciting start."
Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows: Part 2,7,0,1,2 January 2014," Satisfying end to the series
","This movie continues right after the death of Dobby, and closes out the Harry Potter series. There is a lot of action in this one, and it closes out the series satisfactory.If there is any problem, it's that the ideas behind horcroxes are somewhat confusing. They never really explained it easily or clearly. It's a difficult subject that the passing movie goers would best served by reading the books. Even with the books, some aspects could still be murky. The need for explanations requires some slower sections. The pacing still goes well. It does a passable job. The most important part is the exciting battles. It's a thrilling end and a satisfying one for fans of the series."
Unbroken,6,0,1,8 September 2015," technically sound but emotionally thin
","Louis Zamperini (Jack O'Connell) is an Italian-American from Torrance, California. As a boy, he's a juvenile delinquent. Then his brother Pete notices his running abilities which takes him all the way to the '36 Olympics in Berlin. During WWII, he's a bombardier in the Pacific. He is captured and imprisoned by the Japanese.This movie looks good technically. Director Angelina Jolie shows her competency in that respect. Jack O'Connell is OK. There is simply nothing that jumps out. There is little tension and no excitement. The story rolls on like a recitation with limited emotional content. It's still an interesting life and a compelling one to watch."
Final Destination,6,1,1,21 October 2013," Interesting original concept
",Alex (Devon Sawa) is going to France on a school trip. He falls asleep and has a vivid dream where everyone dies in a fiery crash. It's so vivid that he freaks out and gets thrown off the plane with many of his fellow students. The plane actually explodes and those people seem to escape death. Only something is hunting them down one at a time.It's a great original concept. However it doesn't lend itself to being filmed in a compelling way. Basically weird things happen and everybody dies. There isn't a crazy manic. The kids aren't trying to outrun somebody. Death is invisible. That's the whole point. It's just one weird death after another. There's something much more visceral about an axe murderer gutting his young nubile victims.
Kagemusha,7,2,3,5 December 2014," epic with static scenes
","A petty thief is pulled from crucifixion and made to be the double of the ruthless powerful warlord Shingen Takeda. Both the warlord and his brother Nobukado are impressed. It's 1573. Shingen is mortally wounded at a siege. He orders his generals to hide his death for at least 3 years and not to advance from their domain. When he dies in secret, Nobukado proposes to use the double. However the double is uncontrollable and he discovers the dead body. Meanwhile spies are looking for the truth.Director Akira Kurosawa has made a meticulous movie. It is big. There are lots of costumes. The battles have lots of participants. It's real. It is 3 hours and lots of it is very static. It's very old school in that respect. The action isn't very visceral. It is more cerebral. What I mean is that it is visions of formation. There are few actual fights and little blood or gore. The big battle is seen not in the action but in the reaction of the people seeing the action. It is a different way of doing action. It's poetic but also a bit sterile."
Rear Window,10,0,3,10 November 2013," Best Hitchcock ever
","IMHO this is the best Alfred Hitchcock movie ever made. It is even better than Psycho which I consider one of the greatest movie of all times. It is often imitated but never duplicated. And every time it's referenced, there is no doubt that it's this movie that is the originator.Photographer L.B. Jeffries (James Stewart) is stuck at home in his New York apartment after breaking his leg while getting a shot. He does nothing but look out his rear window. He suspects his neighbor Lars Thorwald (Raymond Burr) of murder and enlists the help of his gorgeous girlfriend Lisa Freemont (Grace Kelly) and nurse Stella (Thelma Ritter).This takes place all in the same place inside his apartment. First it allows for the voyeuristic tendency in everyone. It is something hidden that Hitchcock has dug up and presented wrap in a pretty bow. Second he has the perfect everyman in Jimmy Stewart. Third Hitchcock has dug his little hands into our brains. He knows that we all make up little stories for all those we spy on. I love that even the voices from the neighbors are muffled as we strain to hear them.It is the perfect film because none of it is wasted. Every frame of film is consumed as we try to decipher clues from them. Grace Kelly is impossibly gorgeous which makes it even easier on the eyes. For all the different neighbors, it is like many movies in a movie."
The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King,8,0,2,29 September 2016," awards winning epic
","Frodo Baggins and Samwise Gamgee are guided by Gollum to the darkest of Mordor. Gandalf leads the group to to Isengard where they are surprised to find Merry and Pippin having already defeated Saruman. Pippin touches the crystal ball and Sauron mistakenly assumes that he is the ring bearer. Gandalf and Pippin travel to Gondor's capital Minas Tirith but they find mad Denethor on the throne.The quest comes to an end. There is a ton of CGI and it's state of the art. It is fully deserving of the moniker epic. It comes to a climatic apocalyptic battle at Minas Tirith. Then the movie has to keep going for another hour. That can't be helped but the battle in front of the Black Gate is no more than anti-climatic. Also Aragorn releasing the Dead Men struck me as short-sighted heroism. Sometimes, watching something can shine a different light on the idea. It would be better for the Dead Men to not give Aragorn a choice. This movie broke the Oscars by winning eleven. Technically it is far superior and the story is a compelling epic."
A Night at the Roxbury,5,0,1,1 June 2014," One joke over and over again
","Clueless brothers Steve (Will Ferrell) and Doug Butabi (Chris Kattan) can't get into the Roxbury and dreams of opening their own club. They are still living with their parents Barbara (Loni Anderson) and Kamehl (Dan Hedaya) working at the hated family flower shop. Family friend Emily Sanderson (Molly Shannon) lusts after Steve who can't stand her. The guys get rear-ended by 80s star Richard Grieco and they finally have an in into the Roxbury. Gold-diggers Vivica (Gigi Rice) and Cambi (Elisa Donovan) sees the guys talking to the owner Zadir (Chazz Palminteri) and assumes that they have money.The guys and writer from SNL Steve Koren are just piling stupidity onto the Butabi brothers. Steve is slightly more likable because he's just stupid whereas Doug has a real mean streak. The problem is that the movie does the one joke over and over again. It's a little cute at times but mostly it's boring. If Doug is a lot nicer, then it would easier to root for the guys. If there is any hope for this movie, it's the bromance with the brothers. This could have been another 'Dumb and Dumber'. Only Doug is way too angry."
The Purge,6,2,3,3 May 2014," Interesting horror premise needs to be worked out more
","It's 2022 in America. Unemployment is at 1% and crime is at an all-time low except one night every year. The law allows many forms of crime including even murder in that 12 hour period. James Sandin (Ethan Hawke) sells home security and is having his best year. He has gathered his family (Lena Headey, Max Burkholder, Adelaide Kane) to wait out the night. Things don't turn out well starting with the daughter's boyfriend. Then the son allows a vagrant to enter their house who is followed by a mob intend on killing that homeless person.The premise is interesting and original reminding me of Sparta and the Helots. It's certainly a good way to get into a horror movie. However there are a lot of aspects that went uninvestigated in this movie. Everybody has enemies and it's an obvious avenue to go for. For example, he's the best salesman which seems to me to be an obvious reason for other co-workers to kill him. Writer/director James DeMonaco just didn't think through all the possibilities in this world.The obvious fix is to make the purge be only against the poor and the helpless. There could be rules about harboring the hunted. The family lets in that homeless guy which could make them fair game. I'm willing to not harp on it but I must deduct a point for the mistake.When the power goes out, the darkness is not a good way to shoot a film. However when the mob gets vehicles which could light up the house, the lighting looks good. All the light and shadows provide great horror opportunities. I wish more of the movie take place in that lighting scheme.Another missed opportunity is the ticking clock. It could have been a great vehicle for raising the tension. Instead the movie wastes this away by sitting around to run out the clock. It's not the most compelling climax.It's a great original premise with loads of opportunities. With a few more tweaks, this could be a great horror franchise. It has a built-in morality play. The premise doesn't even need any one particular character to carry it either. This could run for a long time if they put in a few fixes."
Munich,6,2,4,28 December 2014," Coldly efficient
","In 1972, nine Israelis are killed at the Munich Olympics. Prime Minister Golda Meir approves a covert operation to assassinate the eleven deemed responsible for the act. Avner (Eric Bana) is low level Mossad tasked to lead the secret mission. He was Golda Meir's bodyguard some two years ago, and he must leave his pregnant wife for an unknown length of time. Ephraim (Geoffrey Rush) is his case handler. The four men on his team are Steve (Daniel Craig), Carl (Ciarán Hinds) the cleaner, Robert (Mathieu Kassovitz) the bomb maker and Hans (Hanns Zischler) the documents guy. They are expendable and must deal with questionable people like Louis (Mathieu Amalric) who tracks down their targets and provide them with material.There is a calculated coldness to the movie and Eric Bana contributes to that. I think Spielberg should have made this more emotional. The audience is detached from the characters. The action is coldly efficient without being exciting. This is not a thriller like a Bond movie. Neither is it a psychological study since Bana can't portray a tortured soul. It is very well made but I feel nothing watching it."

Chloe (Brittany Snow) and Aubrey (Anna Camp), the returning members start picking up new recruits including freshman Beca (Anna Kendrick) who is an independent aspiring DJ unsure of college life.Other new members include the Rebel Wilson who is a true revelation. Anna Kendrick is solid in controlling the screen. Anna Camp had an awesome gut busting moment. The singing is fun. What works best is the chemistry between everybody. These are great female friendships. They make this movie fun to watch."

","Nancy Thompson (Heather Langenkamp), Tina Gray (Amanda Wyss), Rod Lane (Jsu Garcia) and Glen Lantz (Johnny Depp) are all high school friends hounded by a serial killer named Freddy Krueger (Robert Englund) with a bladed glove in their dreams. The dreams are so powerful that they are affecting the real world. The kids discover that they are dreaming about the same guy. Soon the kids are dying and they have to fight their own nightmare. Nancy's police detective father (John Saxon) investigates but it's beyond his power to help.Wes Craven created something more powerful than a simple brute killer like his compatriots. This is a serial killer of the imagination. Freddy Krueger doesn't simply slice and dice. He comes for you in your own mind. It is my favorite horror franchise of that era. The ideas are bounded only by the imagination and more importantly the budget. The other great thing is that Robert England is able give the character some personality. This blood splatter horror is compounded by the scary concept to make something beyond the regular slasher movie."
The Truman Show,8,0,0,15 December 2014," original, funny, touching, compelling
","Truman Burbank (Jim Carrey) lives an ordinary life as an insurance man in an idyllic seaside town Seahaven. He would love to go to Fiji but he is trap on the island by a fear stemming from a childhood trauma. It turns out his whole life is manufactured by TV artist Christof (Ed Harris). The Truman Show is the most popular TV-series in the world. His wife Meryl is played by actress Hannah Gill (Laura Linney). His best friend Marlon (Noah Emmerich) along with everybody in the town as well as the town itself is completely fake. Even his childhood trauma was manufactured. Questionable things keep happening. Sylvia (Natascha McElhone) who played his dreamgirl Lauren tries to help him escape.On one level, this is a profound drama about the TV world and modern life. On another level, this is a great character and Jim Carrey carries it off beautifully. It is both funny and thought-provoking. It's probably looked back on as a signpost for the 90s. This is a movie that is completely original and compelling."
The Hunger Games: Catching Fire,7,2,17,3 December 2013," Good improvement from the first
","Katniss Everdeen (Jennifer Lawrence) and Peeta Mellark (Josh Hutcherson) are home after winning the Hunger Games. Katniss is sparking some rebellious acts. President Snow (Donald Sutherland) is desperate to reign in the opposition by co-opting the Katniss-Peeta relationship. Only they have barely spoke in the last 6 months, and she is still with Gale Hawthorne (Liam Hemsworth). Snow forces Katniss and Peeta to fake their relationship, and institute a winners-only 75th Hunger Games as a way to maintain control.I've never read the books. Looking at only the movies, this is a good improvement over the first one. Katniss and Peeta are more developed characters. Their relationship has a lot more color. It is the emotional content where most of the improvement has occurred. The most interesting new character has to be Johanna Mason (Jena Malone). She adds a bit of wild energy to the movie.The production value takes a small step forward. The apocalyptic sets are still looking too sparse. The bigger CGI settings still has an older iteration feel. I like the monkeys, and the birds scenes. It's a good improvement from the last games. Overall, this movie is a good step up. It actually makes me looking forward to the next movie."
Bill & Ted's Excellent Adventure,8,0,0,1 April 2016," Most Excellent!
","The future is perfect but it's in danger. Ted Logan (Keanu Reeves) and Bill S. Preston (Alex Winter) play in their garage band Wyld Stallyns in San Dimas, California. The two slackers are in danger of failing history unless they ace the final oral presentation. Ted is threatened with military school by his dad. Rufus (George Carlin) travels 700 years from the future in his phone booth to help them pass their history class and stay together to form their most excellent band. Napoleon stowaways with the phone booth and arrives in the present. The boys decide to bring historical figures back with them to do the report.This is simply a fun time with two adorable slackers. It is silly. I hope nobody takes the history lessons too seriously. One can certainly dissect this until all the fun is drained out of the movie. However, the lovable duo of Winter and Reeves cannot be denied. Also the diminutive dictator Napoleon is loads of fun."
The Matrix,9,1,4,9 November 2013," Ultra cool sci-fi
","The Wachowski brothers have created one of the more interesting sci-fi world. Neo (Keanu Reeves) is a computer hacker who has a nagging intuition that the world is wrong. He is literally Alice who goes down the rabbit hole and finds his world is actually Wonderland. It marries Lewis Carroll with HongKong Kung Fu wirework and the back trenchcoat. They invent bullet time and amp up the cool factor in gun fights.The story borrows heavily from a lot of different sources. Machines have taken over. The world is a computer construct. People fight using computer avatars. These are all ideas that have been done before. The Wachowskis have weaved it all together into a functional tapestry.But it is ultimately the cool visuals that makes this movie unique. For a relatively lower big budget, the production value is incredible. They have squeezed every movie magic out of all the visual and computer effects."
Godzilla,6,10,17,26 October 2014," monster movie better than the human story
","During the 1950s, creatures are awaken from the deepest depths. Dr. Ishiro Serizawa (Ken Watanabe) believes that ancient creatures exist that lives in radiation. As the radiation faded from the earth's surface, these creatures retreated to the lower depths. In 1999, miners uncover a vast cavern with a giant skeleton in the Philippines. They also find one of the spores broken open. In Japan at the Janjira Nuclear Power Plant, manager Joe Brody (Bryan Cranston) loses his wife in a freak incident. Fifteen years later, Joe is still investigating the incident with the city around the plant quarantined. He is arrested once again for trying to breach the quarantine. His son Ford (Aaron Taylor-Johnson) has to leave behind his wife Elle (Elizabeth Olsen) in San Francisco to go pick him up from jail in Japan. Joe convinces Ford who is now a US Navy ordnance disposal officer to join him to go to the plant. They discover that there is no radiation leak. Instead the spore from the Philippines named MUTO (Massive Unidentified Terrestrial Organism) has settled in the plant sucking up all the radiation.This is always going to be a great monster movie. The CGI is terrific and Godzilla has a great time smashing things up. That part seems like a no-brainer. I still give director Gareth Edwards credit for doing a great job. He doesn't disappoint. The problem is once again the human story. The beginning is just too long before it gets to a monster. The Joe Brody story doesn't have the bite. In another movie, his story would be a fun mystery. The problem is that the audience knows it's a monster even if it's not Godzilla. So there is no tension from the mystery since it's not really a mystery. The other problem is that Ford just happens to be at the right place in all of those situations. It's a situation that a lesser movie would rely on. I hoped for better. The final problem I have is that the movie cuts away from the monster action time and time again. It's funny the first time but it gets annoying quickly. Despite all the problems, there is still a fun monster movie and lots of stuff get smashed."
Shall We Dance,6,0,1,16 March 2014," Light Charming Little Movie
","John Clark (Richard Gere) lives a life of quiet desperation. Coming home on the commuter train, he sees beautiful Paulina (Jennifer Lopez) in the window of a dance studio. He gets off the train to take dancing lessons. His teacher turns out to be the older Miss Mitzi, and he falls in love with the dancing. His wife Beverly (Susan Sarandon) gets suspicious and hires Devine (Richard Jenkins) to investigate.Richard Gere is too suave for the role. I think he should be a meek office drone. He should at least be somebody more adept at comedy. Stanley Tucci is insanely hilarious as one of the students. That's the tone that the movie needs more of. I love that Hollywood didn't try to force Gere and Lopez into a romance. As it stands, it's a light charming little movie with big star names."
Looper,8,1,5,27 August 2013," Crazy ideas all jammed together and somehow works
","Rian Johnson (The Brothers Bloom, Brick) is the writer and director of this sci-fi film. Like his other projects, this has original if slightly off-kilter thinking in its story. It is not a regular sci-fi movie. There are some crazy ideas going on here. Time travel is not enough. There is also telekinesis, post collapse apocalypse, mob killings, and pre-planned suicide for hire (yeah figure that one out). Does it all make logical sense? I can't tell. But it sure was fun trying to follow it. Joseph Gordon-Levitt is great as the young Bruce Willis. Emily Blunt is refreshingly new. Also staring is Paul Dano and Piper Perabo."
Casino,8,1,1,30 May 2015," Martin Scorsese classic
","In 1983, Sam Rothstein (Robert De Niro) leaves his casino and gets blown up in his car. Ten years earlier, he's running Tangiers with money from questionable sources. The money is getting skimmed and delivered to Kansas City for the mob bosses. Billy Sherbert (Don Rickles) is the manager. Andy Stone (Alan King) is the head of the teamsters and Phillip Green (Kevin Pollak) is the front man. Sam falls for con woman Ginger McKenna (Sharon Stone) who has a weak spot for her old pimp boyfriend Lester Diamond (James Woods). Nicky Santoro (Joe Pesci) is his violent childhood best friend who comes out to Vegas and causes problems pushing his weight around.I'm not always good with narration. The constant narration could have thrown me off but it fits perfectly. This is simply Ace and Nicky teaching the audience the way of their world. De Niro and Pesci are terrific. Sharon Stone brings something different to this. The movie is stretched out a bit at 3 hours but it never loses the tension. Scorsese brings a real beauty to this Vegas landscape."
Life,7,6,11,15 July 2017," minor shades of Alien
","Sho Murakami (Hiroyuki Sanada), Rory Adams (Ryan Reynolds), Miranda North (Rebecca Ferguson), David Jordan (Jake Gyllenhaal), Ekaterina Golovkina (Olga Dihovichnaya), and Hugh Derry (Ariyon Bakare) are six astronauts aboard the international space station orbiting the Earth. They manage to catch the capsule from Mars containing life from the red planet. Derry is able to reanimate the dormant single organism. It grows into a danger to the station and Earth itself.There are moments of over-reaching while the best of this movie is reminiscent of the classic horror Alien with a good dose of Gravity. It's definitely not quite at those levels. The small alien has a cool look but it could never shakes its CGI construction. The bigger alien has some crawlies goodness. The movie starts with manufactured action that seems overblown in hindsight. The initial experiments is stretching the tension too much and it becomes unreal. There are some poor decisions that go too far. Nevertheless, this creature feature has some good creeps and I like the way the creature attacks. Crushing is not the usual method in a horror and this does it well."
Heat,8,0,3,5 February 2015," terrific Michael Mann style
","Neil McCauley (Robert De Niro) leads a group of robbers including Chris Shiherlis (Val Kilmer), Michael Cheritto (Tom Sizemore) and Trejo (Danny Trejo) to rob an armored truck. The job doesn't go exactly as plan and the guards are killed. Their fence Nate (Jon Voight) tries to sell the bonds back to the owner, underworld money launderer Roger Van Zant (William Fichtner). Police Lieutenant Vincent Hanna (Al Pacino) leads the investigation.Michael Mann shows himself to be the master of the tense crime drama. The criminals are slick without being greasy. They are more the tough and quiet type. Following the criminals elevates the tension and the style points. De Niro is terrific and his encounter with Pacino is the stuff of legend. It's the first on-screen meeting between these two giants. The final bank shootout is something else entirely. It is pure tense gun action for the true fans."
Star Wars: Episode IV - A New Hope,10,2,4,29 September 2013," Not just a great movie. It's important
","This story happened 'A long time ago in a galaxy far, far away'. The galaxy is under the dictatorship of the emperor. Princess Leia (Carrie Fisher) is part of the rebellion but is capture by the evil Darth Vader. Luke Skywalker (Mark Hamill) the young hero, Han Solo (Harrison Ford) the brigand, his sidekick Chewbacca, and the wise master Jedi Ben Obi-Wan Kenobi (Alec Guinness) must together rescue the princess and save the galaxy.The characters are icons pulled from classic storytelling like Akira Kurosawa's 'The Hidden Fortress'. George Lucas was able to assemble such iconic characters into a well told story. Rarely is a movie change the nature of movie-making, and even the wider culture. This may be on the list of the most important movie ever. It changed the tone of movies from the gritty morally-confused 70s to the popcorn selling blockbusters that are soon to come."
Footloose,5,1,2,21 September 2014," Kenny Wormald is a better dancer than actor
","The small town of Bomont imposed curfews and banned loud music and dancing after an accident killed five teenagers including Rev. Shaw Moore (Dennis Quaid)'s son. Three years later, Ren MacCormack (Kenny Wormald) moves from Boston to live with his aunt and uncle after his mother's death from leukemia. He finds the small town restrictive. He also finds reverent's daughter Ariel (Julianne Hough) rebelling against the system. He makes a friend in Willard (Miles Teller).I don't think it's a wise move to show the accident. It makes the ban more reasonable and harder to oppose. The Reverend is supposed to be overreaching and becoming unreasonable over the years. However the bigger problem has to be Kenny Wormald. He's more of a dancer than an actor. He doesn't have the charisma or the likability to lead. Julianne Hough comes off better. Although I would have prefer she has better separation between her two lives. She needs to dress down more as the preacher's daughter. This is a functional dance movie but not much else. It's also sad to see that the filmmaker can't think of ways to change up the story. This is obviously a Julianne Hough star vehicle. So it would be so much better to make her the newcomer to town and the lead of the movie."
50_50,8,1,1,1 October 2013," Funny cancer movie
","Adam (Joseph Gordon-Levitt) and Kyle (Seth Rogen) are best friends co-workers. One day Adam is told he has cancer. The news hit everybody in their own way. His girlfriend Rachael (Bryce Dallas Howard) tries desperately to be helpful. His mother (Anjelica Huston) is shocked. He has trouble accepting help from his super young therapist Dr McKay (Anna Kendrick). It might be Kyle who deals with it the best.This is based on Will Reiser's cancer story when he worked with Seth Rogen and Evan Goldberg on the 'Da Ali G Show'. Seth Rogen is really funny as the inappropriate friend and their funny cancer bromance. Anna Kendrick is super sweet and provided some great funny moments. Bryce Dallas Howard is oddly hilarious as the bad girlfriend.This is a good happy cancer movie. So if you have cancer, I highly recommend it. If you don't have cancer, maybe get some before watching this."
Hart's War,6,0,0,11 November 2013," Twist not well set up
","Lt. Thomas Hart (Colin Farrell) is captured during the Battle of the Bulge. He's interrogated for only 3 days by a notorious German. In the POW camp, the CO Col. William McNamara (Bruce Willis) doesn't trust Hart. He's put in with the enlisted men. When 2 black flyboys are put into his barrack, tension runs high with bigoted Staff Sgt. Vic Bedford (Cole Hauser). Later, Lt. Lincoln Scott (Terrence Howard) is accused of killing the racist Bedford and is put on trial.The twist is obvious. I think it would be better if we think that McNamara is a racist who wanted Scott killed. Instead, there really isn't much of a mystery. In fact when the twist is revealed, it's odd to me why Hart didn't realize it sooner. The story just isn't set up properly. Bruce Willis is his upstanding self throughout and couldn't set up his character properly to throw us off. He needed to be bad before we could be surprised by his turn."
What We Do in the Shadows,8,1,2,25 December 2015," fun unusual mockumentary
","Every few years in New Zealand, a secret society holds The Unholy Masquerade. A film crew is allowed into the lives of some vampires who are part of the secret society of supernatural beings such as witches, zombies and werewolves. Viago (Taika Waititi), Nazi vampire Deacon (Jonathan Brugh), Vladislav (Jemaine Clement) and ancient Petyr live together in a house in Wellington struggling with everyday vampire drama. Jackie is Deacon's human familiar who is frustrated with the lack of upward mobility.This is a great concept, a funny group and terrific deadpan humor. It's a brilliant entry into the mockumentary genre. It's too warped of an idea for Christopher Guest to come up with. This comic group isn't always the funniest for me but this movie hits all the vampire tropes on the head. It also works as a horror spoof. It's loads of fun."
Deadpool,8,4,15,5 July 2016," dead funny
","Former Special Forces Wade Wilson (Ryan Reynolds) is the good kind of mercenary. His best friend is bartender Weasel (T. J. Miller). He falls for equally irreverent Vanessa (Morena Baccarin). Their warped love story is interrupted when Wade gets cancer. Agent Smith recruits Wade for experiments. Francis 'Ajax' Freeman with his sidekick Angel Dust (Gina Carano) turn Wade into an immortal ugly superhuman. Wade takes on the identity of Deadpool as he hunts down Francis for a cure. X-man Colossus and his grumpy trainee Negasonic Teenage Warhead try to recruit Deadpool into the X-Men.Simply put, this is funny. Ryan Reynolds is built to play this smart-aleck, crude character. From 'Two Guys and a Girl' to 'Van Wilder', his early works show his truest persona. It's unlikely anybody else could play Deadpool quite as well. This is a non-stop, fast-paced, 4th wall breaking, no holds barred style of comedy. I guess a minority could object to its crudeness. There is a monotone to this style. That's why the funniest moment is the cabby's second ride. It comes out of nowhere. The shock and awe of it is hilarious. I like Negasonic and Colossus. Gina Carano again proves that she's no actor. Morena Baccarin more than makes up for it. All in all, this is funny and an action-packed superhero movie with a solid story."
The Replacements,6,1,2,31 August 2014," light weight football movie
","Shane Falco (Keanu Reeves) is a former star college quarterback who washed out in the pros. Eddie Martel (Brett Cullen) is the star quarterback of Washington Sentinels who is more concerned about himself than the team. Then the players go on strike and Jimmy McGinty (Gene Hackman) is hired to shape up a new team of replacement players. They need three more wins out of their final four games to get into the playoffs. It's a mishmash of wacky personalities. Shane falls for the head cheerleader Annabelle Farrell (Brooke Langton) who has to come up with a new group of cheerleaders. Rhys Ifans is the wiry kicker. Jon Favreau is the angry defensive player who loves to hit. Orlando Jones is the jokey player.It's a pretty light weight football movie with a bit of rom-com. Gene Hackman is slumming it a little to give this some substance. It has a few good jokes. The stripper cheerleaders are cute. The players have just enough wackiness. Keanu Reeves is still that likable lead. It's formulaic and somewhat watchable. At least, director Howard Deutch has the skills to use the formula even with a song and dance in jail."
Get Him to the Greek,8,3,4,26 January 2014," Great funny characters and Jonah Hill is great
","Aldous Snow (Russell Brand) is a messed up rock star. He has a damaged relationship with his ex Jackie Q (Rose Byrne). Aaron Green (Jonah Hill) pitches an idea for a 10 year anniversary of Aldous Snow's successful Live at the Greek Theatre show to label head Sergio (Sean Combs). Aaron is given the chance to wrangle Aldous for his big chance.The Judd Apatow friends gather together to do another hilarious movie. Russell Brand is wonderously wild and childlike. Jonah Hill is a great straight man, charmingly funny and sweet. The combo is a home run. Even P Diddy is great as the bombastic exec. Jonah and Elisabeth Moss are hilarious together in the beginning. The Sarah Marshall call back is hilarious. But it's not just all hilarity. Aldous has real personal problems and not just about the drugs. It's a wonderful mix of heart and comedy. Start stroking the fury wall."
Cloud Atlas,5,3,8,8 January 2014," Hit and Miss but very Ambitious
","Some compelling, some amazing, some confounding, some forgotable, some annoying, it's all this and more. Above it all, this is ambitious. There's a couple of themes going. Basically the good and bad we do affect the future. It's a movie where actors play multiple roles in multiple timelines where they face challenges.Not every story is equal. Some stories are more compelling. Quite frankly, parts of some stories are more compelling than others. The slave whipping scene is certainly the most compelling. The most interesting story is the future Seoul. However it is a hit and miss kind of viewing experience. Jim Broadbent in the retirement home has problems. If he can call his brother, why couldn't he call the cops? In fact, where are the cops in that whole story? I have to be honest that I couldn't remember and keep up with some of these stories. Some become just a mishmash of different stories. It doesn't help that the same actors are in different stories. To me, that concept is more of a hindrance. All the fake makeup create an aura of artificiality to everything. The idea of connected souls is admirable, but they may as well not use the makeup. That would be something interesting. This feels like Eddie Murphy."
Thirteen Days,9,4,5,17 April 2016," great tense political drama
","It's October, 1962, the Cuban missile crisis. Photos from the U-2 spy plane show possible nuclear missiles on Cuban soil. This sets off high level panic that almost ends with WWIII. The movie centers on the Special Assistant to the President, Kenny O'Donnell (Kevin Costner). The push from the military is for a full invasion of Cuba. However, the Kennedy brothers and Kenny push back.This is more like a brilliant stage play done with so much intensity that the audience is right there in the room. There are flashes of newsreels, CGI, and other footage to fill out the movie with the outside world. It is very much a political thriller inside the President's inner circle. It is tense despite the well known ending and event highlights. The use of Costner as a side character pushed out to be the lead is brilliant. It allows the best (but lesser known) actors in some of the most iconic roles around. Surprisingly, there are also flashes of humor. The acting is amazing. This is one of the best movies about those thirteen days."
300,8,3,7,20 February 2014," Zack Snyder's brilliant vision
","It's 480 BC and the Greek city states are faced with a massive invading Persian army. The Spartan King Leonidas (Gerard Butler) and a force of 300 men march to the Hot Gates at Thermopylae to face King Xerxes and his army. The cliff narrows to a small opening to negate Xerxes' numerical advantage. They would hold the pass until they are betrayed.This is all about director Zack Snyder's vision to adapt this Frank Miller graphic novel. It is a cinematic full screen representation of a comic book. He's taken the beauty and essence of a 2-dimensional artform onto the big screen. He has taken the successful 'Sin City' style to the next level.The story is fairly basic. It's a lot of machismo and lots of abs. Gerard Butler holds the movie together in a thankless job in this visual vortex. The dialog can be very stilted, but it fits the story well."
Kingsman: The Secret Service,9,5,10,2 January 2016," ultra-violent Bond-like movie
","Kingsman is a secret spy organization not connected to any government working in the shadows with no rewards and no fame. Arthur (Michael Caine) is the head of the organization. Harry Hart (Colin Firth) is Galahad. He recruits Eggsy (Taron Egerton) who's father once saved his life. Super billionaire villain Valentine (Samuel L. Jackson) has vicious hench-woman Gazelle and a devastating plan.It's fun, ultra-violent and expertly made. Matthew Vaughn delivers a sharp product. This is more fun than most Bond movies. The action is better than many superhero movies. The church scene is a piece of art. Colin Firth really delivers the needed class. I like Jackson's villain with a speech impediment. It's a fun exciting compelling action adventure from start to finish."
Ran,8,1,3,27 July 2016," Shakespearean Samurai Epic
","Warlord Hidetora Ichimonji is haunted. He divides his kingdom among his three sons; Taro, Jiro, and Saburo. The oldest Taro is given the First Castle to lead the younger brothers. The youngest Saburo objects and he is banished. Another lord Fujimaki takes him in and offers his daughter for marriage. Taro's wife Lady Kaede lost her blood family to Hidetora's ruthless conquest and plots to destroy the family from within. Taro and Jiro force Hidetora from power driving him to madness.Legendary director Akira Kurosawa delivers a big production of mass battles and epic drama. It's one of the grandest samurai epics. It is wonderfully beautiful. The acting is big. It is visually stunning."
Cube,7,1,3,27 March 2015," simple Kafkaesque concept
",Alderson (Julian Richings) wakes up inside a cubic room with exits on all sides. He climbs into the next room and is killed by a trap. Policeman Quentin (Maurice Dean Wint) climbs into a new cube and finds injured secretive Worth (David Hewlett) passed out. Then others join them. Holloway (Nicky Guadagni) is a doctor. Leaven (Nicole de Boer) is a fearful math whiz. Wrennes (Wayne Robson) is an ingenious escape artist. Nobody remembers how they got there. Leaven notices unique numbers in each cube. Wrennes gets killed. Then Leaven realizes only rooms with prime numbers are traps. They run into mentally challenged Kazan (Andrew Miller).It's such a great and simple Kafkaesque idea. There are minimal sets. The flashiness comes from the interactions. It's a good indie thriller. It's a bit pointless like the cube itself. There are some slow spots in the middle. I also wish the ending is more compelling. The numbers get more complicated and it gets harder to follow. It's still a nice little indie thriller.
Tarzan,7,2,2,5 January 2015," Beautiful animation of familiar story
","A family is shipwrecked and stranded in the jungle. Sabor the leopard kills the parents and Kala the gorilla rescues the baby. Despite leader Kerchak's disapproval, Kala raises the baby naming him Tarzan. Brash gorilla Terk befriends him and they meet fearful elephant Tantor. When Sabor attacks, Tarzan saves Kerchak and the group with his spear. Professor Porter and his daughter Jane are studying the gorillas led by their hunter guide Clayton. Jane is chased by a pack of baboons and Tarzan rescues her. Tarzan becomes torn between the jungle and going with Jane to England.The animation is terrific and very energetic. Tarzan swinging in the trees is exciting. The traditional tale is a bit stale and I don't think the montage sequences are that compelling. The Phil Collins music may not be a great fit for a Disney kids movie. Nevertheless this is a good animated movie for the whole family. It has enough excitement and maintains the interest of the audience."
The Hangover Part III,7,5,7,29 August 2013," Zach is super annoying, not as funny, but it has heart
","Zach Galifianakis is now super annoying. When this started, we were laughing at him but his shtick is now tiring. They needed to downgrade his antics from mean-hearted to just simple stupidity. I know Todd Phillips is saving it for Alan to grow in this movie. But it started to happen too late.Bradley Cooper and Ed Helms seem to be going thru the motions. We miss the face tattoo. They needed to do something to replace it.Ken Jeong is actually doing something serious. In the first two, he was lovable bad guy. From the first moment as the naked guy in the car truck, we thought he couldn't do much damage. But in this one, he is causing real damage to the group.John Goodman is doing a new character Marshall. He's a new bad guy looking to get Mr Chow for stealing his gold. So he kidnaps Doug to force the group to catch Mr Chow for him. It's rather serious, and not that funny.It was good to see that Alan finally grow up, and dealt with Mr Chow."
Easy A,8,2,3,22 September 2013," Emma Stone lovable
","Virginal high schooler Olive Penderghast (Emma Stone) tells a little white lie to her best friend Rhiannon (Alyson Michalka). It quickly spreads as judgmental Marianne (Amanda Bynes) makes Olive the new cause celeb. She decides to own it by playing it up. To help out bullied gay friend Brandon (Dan Byrd), she pretends to sleep with him. Then everybody wants in, and things spin out of control.There's a lot of sarcastic humor with modern references. It's pretty funny on its own, but it's definitely all Emma Stone. She is absolutely lovable. If there is one problem, it's that we're suppose to believe that Emma Stone and Alyson Michalka are outsiders. It is the movies, so let's put that aside. At most Hollywood usually puts librarian glasses on them anyways."
Apollo 13,8,1,1,19 September 2014," Old fashion epic
","The space program is still haunted by Apollo-1 test accident on Jan 27, 1967. Man finally lands on the moon on July 20, 1969. Jim Lovell (Tom Hanks) is the experienced leader. Jack Swigert (Kevin Bacon) is the brash eager young gun. Both Fred Haise (Bill Paxton) and Ken Mattingly (Gary Sinise) are aiming to be on Lovell's crew. Lovell is slated to be on Apollo 14 but gets bumped up to 13. Mattingly gets sidelined for not having had the measles and backup Swigert is put in his place. They are sent up on April 11, 1970. Having already achieved the landing, the world isn't paying attention to this mission. That is until things go wrong. Ed Harris plays the Flight Director Gene Kranz and Kathleen Quinlan plays Marilyn Lovell.This is a compelling story on its own. On the surface, this is the B-side of the epic man's mission to Mars. However director Ron Howard meticulously retains the details of the mission that makes it all come to life on the screen. That is the greatness of this movie. It is epic in all of its small details and its scope. All the actors are giving sincere performances in an old fashioned movie."
Fast Five,7,0,1,23 February 2014," More action than anybody can possibly expect
","Following the previous installment, Brian O'Conner (Paul Walker) and Mia Toretto (Jordana Brewster) breaks out her brother Dom (Vin Diesel) from the prison transport. They escape to Rio de Janeiro. Running low on cash, they do a job with Vince to steal cars from a train. However everything goes wrong. Three DEA agents are killed, and the three escapees get blamed. They find a chip in the car that shows where master criminal Reyes (Joaquim de Almeida) has hidden his $100 million. Meanwhile DSS agent Luke Hobbs (Dwayne Johnson) has arrived to catch the three and bring them back to justice. He takes uncorrupted local cop Elena Neves (Elsa Pataky) as his translator. Instead of running away, the three decide to call in reinforcements to pull off the greatest robbery ever.Director Justin Lin is bringing more action than ever. The addition of big action star The Rock just raises the bar that much higher. It starts with a great car-train action scene. Then a foot chase in the barrios looks incredible. That's barely half of it. I do wish the story be simplified even more. Most people watch this for the action, not for the story. This is a movie that delivers the action and exceeds the expectations."
The Thin Red Line,8,4,7,18 December 2014," unique Malick style
","It's World War II at the battle of Guadalcanal. Pvt. Witt (Jim Caviezel) is part of the group brought in as relief. 1st Sgt. Edward Welsh (Sean Penn) doesn't want him after he went AWOL and assigns him to be a stretcher bearer. Lt. Col. Gordon Tall (Nick Nolte) is jealous and bitter. He puts on the pressure on Capt. James Staros (Elias Koteas) to capture a particularly tough position.This is fully a Terrence Malick movie. It is beautifully shot. It is poetry in action. There are great meditations before the fights, during the fights and after the fights. Even the grass is beautiful. Nick Nolte is amazing. He gives an award worthy performance. The action is scary at times and exciting. The scariest is when a snipper kills a man and you can't see where it came from. It is an unique war movie."
Green Book,7,8,12,22 February 2019," heart's in the right place
","It's 1962 New York City. 'Tony Lip' Vallelonga (Viggo Mortensen) is a nightclub bouncer and a tough guy ingratiating himself with gangsters. When his workplace gets shut down for a two month renovation, he gets a job driving peculiar classical pianist Dr. Don Shirley (Mahershala Ali) to his concerts in the deep south.There are issues but the movie has its heart in the right place. I don't mind the racist Tony Lip finding redemption and friendship in Shirley. Viggo is doing it pretty broadly but the main problem is Shirley. There are scenes where Farrelly is desperate for humor but it only heightens my disbelief. First is the cringeworthy KFC. It's crazy that a man has never had fried chicken despite coming from the south. The point should have been that he prefers not to eat fried chicken (and watermelon and collard greens and grits). It's not that he doesn't like it. He avoids it to avoid his roots. The same goes for the music. He's a musician for heaven's sake. Maybe he's not up to date but he had probably studied aspects of modern music and he's probably met a few of those artists. It's all wrong. His broadly played homosexuality is also a little awkward. I was really scared where Farrelly was taking that until it was saved by Tony who as a nightclub bouncer claims to have seen it all. It's a nice surprising twist to his character and in keeping with his transactional nature. Even the letter writing could be improved if some forethought had occurred. There is no reason why Dolores would go gaga over the letters when she suspects that it's Shirley's writing. She should hold back on the affection with the other girls going gaga. Only when she gets the house letter does she goes head over heels. It would show that she knows him best. These little nagging issues keep the movie from being great although I still enjoyed it."
Honey,6,0,0,13 May 2015," not much edge in Alba
","Honey Danels (Jessica Alba) is trying to make it as a dancer in NYC. She's a bartender at a nightclub and teaches hip-hop dancing at a local youth center. Video director Michael Ellis is taken with her dancing. He makes her a star dancer and then a choreographer. Gina (Joy Bryant) is her best friend. Chaz (Mekhi Phifer) is a barber trying to keep the youth center going. When Honey rejects the controlling Michael's advances, he cuts off her career at every turn. Meanwhile she's trying to keep Benny away from the pull of the gangs.Jessica Alba has the acting chops for this simple dance movie. This is very much a simplistic dance movie. There is limited edge. Alba doesn't have enough street in her. It's nothing new. The dancing from Alba is good but not acrobatic. Although complaining about this movie is like kicking a new born puppy. This movie doesn't have a mean bone in its body and it's perfectly watchable."
Fantastic Four,6,0,3,20 October 2013," Mostly just setting up
","Scientists Reed Richards (Ioan Gruffudd) and Ben Grimm (Michael Chiklis) convinces former colleague Victor von Doom (Julian McMahon) to conduct an experiment on his company's space station as a cosmic storm approaches. Along for the ride is the company genetics scientist Sue Storm (Jessica Alba) and her brash pilot brother Johnny (Chris Evans). They get hit with the storm that changed their genetic makeup. They gain superpowers but not all of them are happy with all the changes.The movie starts too slowly. For an action superhero movie, this really needed to start out right at the space station. There's no time to waste on too much unnecessary setup. The action needs to start as soon as possible. The fact is the whole movie is one big introduction. The group dynamic hasn't been set yet. The constant fighting between Johnny Storm and Ben Grimm still isn't something between old buddies. I can see this franchise getting better as the group dynamics get squared away."
The Great Escape,8,0,4,16 November 2013," Sets the standard
","This has to be one of the best movie of its genre by the great director John Sturges. Based on a true story, this has all the basic archetypes. The cast is truly stellar consisting of great stars and iconic old timers. Steve McQueen is the big headliner and is very cool. But he doesn't overshadow anybody. Seeing the list of amazing talents, everybody had their chance to create compelling characters. James Garner has just as much charm as McQueen. Donald Pleasence has the memorable scene of pretending to see. Then there is a list of award winning actors like Richard Attenborough, and James Coburn. It would be the prison escape movie that others would imitate in the future."
The Twilight Saga: Eclipse,6,1,1,2 January 2016," improvement over the second movie
","It's the third movie in the Twilight series. Bella Swan is completely in love with Edward Cullen. Jacob Black is not happy and still wants Bella. Seattle is hit with mysterious murders. Victoria has an army of newborn vampires. The Cullens and the Werewolves have to join forces to battle the vampire army.The love triangle is in its last gasp and it does it in good style. The vampire army is a good addition. Overall, this is an improvement over the second movie. There is an approaching danger and a climatic battle. The romance is good. The human characters are essentially sidelined at this point. It's not a cinematic masterpiece but it's watchable even for non-fans."
Click,5,1,4,26 June 2015," unlikeable Sandler ruins this
","Michael Newman (Adam Sandler) is an angry family man. He has to deal with idiotic clients at his work as an architect. His family led by his wife Donna (Kate Beckinsale) wants more of his attention. One night, he goes out to buy an universal remote. Only 'Bed, Bath and Beyond' is open, and Morty (Christopher Walken) goes Way Beyond to get him a special remote.Sandler ruins this movie at every turn with his anger and hatefulness. He doesn't like people and the audience can feel that. It doesn't take long before Rob Schneider plays a racially insensitive character. It's got Sandler's brand of childish humor. All of it is salvageable if Sandler's character is played nicer. It would be better for him to be a lovable loser. The story of a man finding his way to reconnect with his family is a compelling and heart-warming one. It's just that Sandler's character keeps annoying me and stops me from liking this movie."
Pineapple Express,4,1,5,30 May 2014," Dale and Saul need to be good long term friends
","Process server and stoner Dale Denton (Seth Rogen) has a high school girlfriend Angie Anderson (Amber Heard). His slacker dealer Saul Silver (James Franco) has a new strain of weed called Pineapple Express. Dale is serving to Ted Jones (Gary Cole) and witnesses him and a cop (Rosie Perez) committing a murder. Jones is a dangerous drug lord and finds Dale's discarded Pineapple Express joint. Dale runs to Saul, and now they have to run for their lives from Jones' henchmen Budlofsky (Kevin Corrigan) and Matheson (Craig Robinson).It's a weed action thriller from Seth and Evan. The biggest missing element from this is a long term friendship between the guys. This is a classic buddy comedy without the classic buddy. Cheech and Chong were always long time buddies. There is nothing holding Dale and Saul together. It makes more sense if they could easily turn on each other. It makes no sense that Saul would stick his neck out for Dale. Also they are missing the buddy comedy aspect. Every joke loses a little on the friendship discount. It's a big missing ingredient. Rogen and Franco are still the likable goofballs. They serve up their usual weed up characters. There is a bit of action. It's not done for thrills but more for comedy."
John Wick: Chapter 2,6,1,1,7 October 2017," more Gun Fu
","Iosef's uncle still has John Wick's car. Wick comes after it and the uncle accepts his offer of peace. He hopes to return to his peaceful retirement but crime lord Santino D'Antonio calls in his Marker. He faces deadly assassins, numerous killers, and countless thugs as Santino uses him to gain power even offering a $7 million contract.Gun Fu is loads of fun and the addition of Pencil Fu is glorious. What makes the original great is the simple, powerful, and poetic motivation of John Wick. The sequel could not possibly repeat that. They can't kill off another dog. This one delivers what it could. Keanu Reeves remains the same and there is more fighting. The plot is almost meaningless. It is all action and all Wick."
Annihilation,6,3,6,16 March 2018," intriguing but flawed
","A meteor strikes a lighthouse. A shimmer descends and slowly expands. It's three years later. While a cover story is maintained, the military has been unsuccessfully investigating the phenomenon. Lena (Natalie Portman) is a biology professor and former army soldier. Her military husband Kane (Oscar Isaac) is damaged after returning from the Shimmer. He is the sole survivor of his expedition. At the military base, psychologist Dr. Ventress (Jennifer Jason Leigh) is leading the next expedition which is all female. Lena decides to join them.This is Alex Garland's next film after Ex Machina. It is fascinating sci-fi but also flawed. There is no denying the visual imagination and moody atmosphere. At times, it is great horror and quite frankly, I want more body horrors. There are ideas and images never seen before. The bear cry is incredible. The flower people and the glass trees are beautiful. It is all to Garland's credit that this has his signature vibe. This is a great unique vision but the flaws do hold it back.First, the flashforward wrap-around gives away too much of the ending. The movie does insert a little uncertainty with the climax but it would be so much more compelling to leave the finish without any clues. The flashforward gives no additional tension and only acts to drag down the pacing without being useful. Second, three years is too long. It's hard to believe that the secret could be kept for three years. What about birds and sea life that migrate away from the Shimmer? It seems logical that some birds would mutate. By squeezing the time span to something like three days, it would increase the logic and the intensity. It gives the crisis immediacy. One would also expect the military would figure out some basic stuff. They should at least have a menagerie of mutant creatures. Third, the lighthouse is right next to the ocean. One would think it's easier to travel there by boat. I assume flying would be too dangerous but the movie should deal with a fast boat idea. Finally, this has a nice horror vibe but it could have been truly disturbing. Garland has a better eye for beauty than horror. He is more concerned with visual rather than plot logistics. The movie is beautiful and moody but the writing is sloppy and the pacing is halting."
Interview with the Vampire: The Vampire Chronicles,7,1,2,7 November 2014," needs something to drive the plot better
","In present day San Francisco, reporter Daniel Molloy (Christian Slater) interviews Louis de Pointe du Lac (Brad Pitt) who claims to be a vampire. Back in 1791 south of New Orleans, he was a 24 year old owner of a plantation. He is in grief over his wife's death in childbirth. He wants to die and Lestat de Lioncourt (Tom Cruise) answers his wish. Yvette (Thandie Newton) is Louis' favorite slave whose killing is the final act before he sets the plantation on fire. Louis refuses human blood until he finds young Claudia (Kirsten Dunst) living besides her dead mother. After Louis has a taste, Lestat converts her to a vampire.Were we ever so easily swayed by the simple promise of sexy vampires? Apparently we were. Of course, there is more to this than the two sex symbols of the time; Tom Cruise and Brad Pitt. Director Neil Jordan is able to bring Anne Rice's Gothic sense to the big screen. It is beautifully shot and expertly crafted. However it doesn't drive. At least, the plot isn't very hard driving. This is a ponderous affair. The movie already shows that Louis exists at the end so he doesn't have the tension of danger. The story plods along but it does so beautifully. It's also quite a nice introduction to Kirsten Dunst. She's amazing in this and probably out-acts Brad Pitt."
Jackie Brown,8,1,3,13 February 2015," Pam Grier terrific
",Flight attendant Jackie Brown (Pam Grier) smuggles money from Mexico to Los Angeles for gun runner Ordell Robbie (Samuel L. Jackson). His friend Louis Gara (Robert De Niro) did 4 years for bank robbery. Melanie Ralston (Bridget Fonda) is Ordell's surf chick girlfriend. Ordell pays the $10k bail with bondsman Max Cherry (Robert Forster) for his courier Beaumont Livingston (Chris Tucker). Then he kills Beaumont. ATF agents Ray Nicolette (Michael Keaton) and Mark Dargus (Michael Bowen) arrest Jackie Brown but she refuses to cooperate. Max arranges for her bail. Ordell intends to kill her but she comes up with a better scheme to help him smuggle out money and pay her for any jail time.Quentin Tarantino fills this movie with compelling characters played by charismatic character actors. Pam Grier makes a terrific step up. The plot is stuffed beyond what's necessary. It's a bit too long. I would like it to be tighter and more tense although Tarantino loves to fill up the in between scenes. It never drags and it's all very interesting. It's not as great as 'Pulp Fiction' or 'Reservoir Dogs' but it's in the same ballpark.
Monty Python and the Holy Grail,8,3,4,24 February 2014," Ground breaking iconic movie
","King Arthur (Graham Chapman) is traveling around looking for knights to sit with him at the round table. After gathering several knights, God comes to them with a quest to retrieve the Holy Grail.This is the ground breaking comedy that introduced so many to the offbeat humor of Monty Python. The comedy is sweet and charming. It starts right off the bat with the rolling of the moose credits. The movie is comedy legend and holds up well over time. The jokes are still good, whether it's Michael Palin tempted at Castle Anthrax or the killer rabbit. Sure it's very geeky to watch and enjoy this although it's a little bit more sophisticated than it appears."
Star Wars: Episode V - The Empire Strikes Back,10,2,3,6 May 2016," Best Star Wars FILM
","After the destruction of the Death Star, the Rebel Alliance has been hounded by the Empire. Princess Leia, Luke Skywalker, and Han Solo are with the Rebel forces on the secret base on the planet Hoth. Darth Vader locates the base driving the rebels on the run. Leia, Chewie, and Han with C-3PO escape on the Millennium Falcon eventually ending up in Lando Calrissian's Cloud City. Meanwhile, Luke goes to the Dagobah system and finds Jedi Master Yoda.There are superior popcorn movies in the Star Wars franchise although there is plenty of eye-popping action in this one. This is the best overall film in the series. The dialog is snappier. The combative romance between Leia and Han is the best. Everything looks great. It introduces Yoda and Lando. There are great legendary twists. It is a Star Wars movie for film fans. Even the Special Edition is the best of the original trio. There may be one or two stiff additions but most of them actually help. There are so many incredible moments in this."
Minions,6,5,8,19 July 2015," the kids liked it
","The Minions have tried over history to serve the most despicable. They always seem to end up causing their masters harm. After failing Napoleon, they are hounded to an isolated ice cave. They build an impressive settlement but over time, they lose heart without a villain master. Kevin has a plan to find a master with Stuart and little Bob. They arrive in 1968 NYC. They hitchhike to Villain-Con in Orlando, Florida and become followers of supervillain Scarlet Overkill. They travel to London where Scarlet instructs the trio to steal the Crown from Queen Elizabeth. Bob pulls the Sword out of the Stone and becomes the new ruler.The Minions have always been the funniest characters in the Despicable Me franchise. I was confident that they could be hilarious in their own movie. This doesn't measure up to my expectations. I brought my little nephews (7 year olds) to the movie and they had a few big laughs. They liked it but not really loving it. For me, Minions is pretty funny at times but there is a missing element. Scarlet Overkill is evil without the comedy. After a pretty funny first half, the movie struggles for comedy which Scarlet is unwilling to provide. The middle gets kind of boring. It's not a movie for the adults. It is entertaining for the kids and in the end, that's what's important."
Aladdin,8,2,4,21 November 2015," Robin Williams outshines
","Jafar, Grand Vizier to the Sultan sends a con into the Cave of Wonders to retrieve the magic lamp. The guard demands a Diamond in the Rough and devours the man. Princess Jasmine is tired of palace life and the Sultan's constant attempt to find her a husband. She sneaks out into the market where good-natured thief Aladdin with his monkey Abu saves her from getting her hand chopped off. Jafar orders Aladdin's capture and then helps him escape to steal the lamp. Aladdin manages to survive and release the Genie (Robin Williams). He promises to grant Genie his freedom with his third wish.Robin Williams is utterly brilliant. His personality is so big that he outshines almost everybody except the villain. Jafar is a terrific villain in the vein of traditional Disney. Aladdin and Jasmine suffer from being overshadowed by the side characters. There are a couple of nice catchy tunes. This is generally a good animated movie with an outstanding voice performance."
Incredibles 2,8,9,13,29 October 2018," continues to be fun
","This follows after the first movie. Superheroes continue to be banned. The family battles a supervillain causing havoc in the city. They become outcasts, unemployed, and penniless. The wealthy Deavor siblings, heads of the tech company Devtech, recruit Frozone and then the family to make superheroes great again. They convince Elastigirl to be the face of the revival while Mr. Incredible has to play Mr. Mom.Generally speaking, this is fun. It's a solid superhero movie and a fine family adventure. There is one hilarious scene with Jack-Jack and a raccoon. The only misstep is wiping Tony's memories. It would be so much more compelling for Tony to know Violet's secret and have them deal with that. It would make the young romance much more powerful and more dangerous. He could be a damsel in distress or he could slip up with the secret. There are more possibilities with him knowing. I would like Dash to dial back the bratty kid act by a half level. This continues to be great for the loving family at its center. I love Mr. Incredible figuring out how to use Jack-Jack as a laser gun. It's a fun movie and a fun franchise."

In order to blend in, they join a traveling circus. Along with the penguins and King Julian, they meet all new characters and have crazy adventures.The 3D is fun and the colorful kaleidescope is eye candy to the kids. They'll have fun with this confection. The story is ridiculous, stupid, and funny. The whole family will enjoy it. I brought my little nephews and they liked it."
A Walk to Remember,6,0,0,20 September 2013," Formula teen melodrama
","Landon Carter (Shane West) is a popular self-obsessed top dog. He is uncaring and when one of his pranks goes wrong, he puts a fellow student in the hospital. As punishment, he is forced to be the lead in a school play. Jamie Sullivan (Mandy Moore) is the reverend's daughter who has nothing in common with Landon. She is also in the play, and Landon ask her for help. Only he won't let anybody know.This is a predictable teen melodrama based on a Nicholas Sparks novel that has all the stereotypes. I'm just surprised that the formula works yet again. All the characters are stock creations. It moves along the well traveled tracks. Both leads are likable and solid but uninspired. Of course, this being a Nicholas Sparks movie. There has to be a secret or twist. I do wish there was something more profound and original dialog. The stale conversations really grinds down this movie."
Inside Llewyn Davis,7,1,1,22 April 2014," Coen brothers recreate an era
",It's 1961 in Greenwich Village. Llewyn Davis (Oscar Isaac) is a struggling folk singer who lost his musical partner Mike to suicide. His new solo album isn't selling but then neither is anything else he did with Mike. He stays at his friends the Gorfeins but the cat gets locked out. Then he visits his friends Jim (Justin Timberlake) and Jean (Carey Mulligan). She tells him that she's pregnant possibly by him. And Llewyn's life keeps drifting on.Brother filmmakers Ethan and Joel Coen have brought something different with this original character in this unique era. It's beautifully filmed as usual. Oscar Isaac is a newcomer and an unknown. He fits this character very well. He has a drifter musician quality to him. Carey Mulligan takes a hilarious turn with her angry performance. The movie has a mellow and rambling vibe. It also has its big moments. The music is awright but nothing exciting. It's a man slowly drifting in the world as his musical career tries to stay afloat.
Sin City,8,1,5,15 August 2014," Original style
","Based on the Frank Miller graphic novel series and directed mainly by Robert Rodriguez, this has 4 stories of Basin City; The Hard Goodbye, The Big Fat Kill, That Yellow Bastard and The Customer is Always Right. It's a highly stylized black and white visual with splashes of brilliant colors. It is completely unique and original. It fits the stories and the genre so well. 'Sky Captain and the World of Tomorrow' tried something similar but that one doesn't have the edge. That one felt lifeless whereas this one is overflowing with power. The actors are all embodying the old hard-boiled noir style of acting. They are successful for the most part. Mickey Rourke is the best of them all. For some reason, he doesn't seem to be acting whereas everybody else are just pretending. He embodies his character so well that it doesn't even feel like he's acting."
Saboteur,6,0,2,24 October 2014," Not Hitchcock's best
",Barry Kane (Robert Cummings) is a worker at an aircraft plant in California. A fire is set killing his friend Mason. Frank Fry had given him a fire extinguisher which he handed to Mason. Only the extinguisher is filled with gasoline. They find no such worker named Fry and the cops come after Kane. Kane goes on the run and remembers the address on one of Fry's letters he picked up which leads to Charles Tobin (Otto Kruger)'s ranch. He escapes and kidnaps unbelieving Pat Martin (Priscilla Lane) on a wild adventure to stop Tobin and his cohorts.It's a lot twists and turns from Hitchcock in America. There are also way too many people who choose to believe him despite being a fugitive from the police. Cummings is not nearly charismatic enough to lead the movie or convince all those people of anything. The adventure needs a lot more action in the middle. It's not Hitchcock's best effort but the final Statue of Liberty is pretty good. It does remind me of the superior 'North by Northwest'.
The Ugly Truth,5,13,19,8 December 2013," Predictable rom-com
","Abby Richter (Katherine Heigl) is a high maintenance dater, producer of a lowly rated morning show about to be canceled. Her boss hires male chauvinist call-in show host Mike Chadway (Gerard Butler). Mike and Abby clash even before their first meeting. On the opposite end, she thinks her new hot doctor neighbor Colin (Eric Winter) fits the bill perfectly.This character actually fits Heigl's persona. So it has some potential right off the bat. At least, she's not the sweet girly girl in a rom-com.... until she meets the neighbor. She doesn't do that broad comedy that well. She looks ridiculous and stupid. She's better off as angry girl, sort of like Katherina in The Taming of the Shrew.This movie is completely predictable. Everybody can see everything coming from a mile away. The good news is that Heigl and Butler has some chemistry in their combative relationship. That's about all there is in this movie."
Gangs of New York,7,2,3,21 January 2015," too much of a good thing
","It's 1846 in the Five Point neighborhood in NYC. Bill 'the Butcher' Cutting (Daniel Day-Lewis) and his U.S. born gang kill Priest Vallon (Liam Neeson) in a mass gang fight. Little Amsterdam Vallon runs away taking the knife that killed his father. Sixteen years later, Amsterdam (Leonardo DiCaprio) returns to the neighborhood from reform house to avenge his father. Johnny Sirocco (Henry Thomas) is a boy from the old days who joins him. He is taken with pickpocket Jenny Everdeane (Cameron Diaz). Bill leads the most powerful gang and everyone are loyal to him. Boss Tweed (Jim Broadbent) in Tammany Hall are in league with him. The country is deep into the Civil War and the city is on the brink of riots. The Priest's old colleges are scattered. Amsterdam insinuates himself into Bill's circle.This is a massive movie from Martin Scorsese. It is an admirable undertaking. Once again, Daniel Day-Lewis delivers a pitch perfect performance. He is exactly Bill the Butcher. He overshadows everybody including Leo. The story is a mess of characters and relationships. The plot really doesn't flow. Everything is played to the fullest. It needs to lay out the story more simply. There is too much here but all of it is impeccably done."

It's a simple classic horror setup. What follows is a series horror classic discoveries, and finally the shocking truth.Director Drew Goddard co-writes with Joss Whedon as they bring a smart spin on the traditional horror. It's easy to see how this is the work of movie fans. They definitely know the horror genre. Chris Hemsworth is proving his movie hunk status. This is best described as a mastercrafted movie."
Windtalkers,5,0,1,8 April 2014," War action movie could be better
","Private Ben Yahzee (Adam Beach) is a Navajo who is trained to be a code-talker in the Pacific. Joe Enders (Nicolas Cage) is a tough Marine sergeant who held his position in the difficult Soloman Islands. He is wounded with a perforated ear drum and have difficulties balancing. He fakes his medical with the help of nurse Rita (Frances O'Connor). He is then assigned the task of protecting the valuable code-talker and more importantly the code at all cost, implying that the code-talker must die rather than falling prisoner.Director John Woo tries for a full blown war movie. It's not his usual fare. The action is certainly big enough. His usual style doesn't always translate into realistic action. Nicolas Cage doesn't seem to fit the character. I like Adam Beach better as the young naive soldier. The true story may be interesting but there are better war movies elsewhere. John Woo continues to use the close up reaction shots and the close up gun face off. It takes away from the gritty realism."
Spectre,7,1,5,9 August 2016," cool but not great
","James Bond (Daniel Craig) followed the previous M's instruction to kill Marco Sciarra. He only shows the message to Moneypenny (Naomie Harris). This leads to an embarrassing Mexico City incident for the new M (Ralph Fiennes) who suspends Bond. M is organizing a merger with MI-5 and C (Andrew Scott) is creating surveillance system 'Nine Eyes' looking to shut down '00'. Bond steals a car from Q (Ben Whishaw) to attend Sciarra's funeral where he meets his wife Lucia (Monica Bellucci). Using the stolen Sciarra ring, Bond infiltrates a Spectre meeting headed by Blofeld (Christoph Waltz). Dr. Madeline Swann (Léa Seydoux) is the daughter of a murdered Spectre agent and key to bringing down the organization.With the return of Spectre, I was hoping for a great villain to take his place among the greats of Bond villains. Waltz barely gets up in his first scene and takes forever to return. He's a missed opportunity for a supervillain. Andrew Scott is the sleazy weasel but he's not that guy. This movie is exceedingly cool and filled with sharp action. It's missing something. It's missing greatness. It's missing the great memorable thing. The movie is sometimes a little slow with long expositions. The audience don't really need it. They already know who the bad guys are. They just need Bond to catch up and find them. This is a fine Bond movie but one that may be forgotten among the rest."
Braveheart,8,2,5,8 January 2014," Rip Roaring Fun
","William Wallace (Mel Gibson) is the son of a minor landowner who was killed by Longshanks' treachery. He would start a revolt after his secret wife was executed unjustly. The revolt would grow to an all out war against the tyrannical king of England.Director Mel Gibson is pulling all the stops to create this epic historical melodrama. It is rip roaring fun. The action is blood splattering joy. The scale of the battles are actually quite impressive with real people. It's the kind of sword swinging that every boy dreams of playing. The story is full of melodrama starting with avenging his great love, to a romance with a princess. Historical accuracy is unnecessary when it's so much fun. It taps into all of the archetypes of heroes and villains putting them into a compelling historical drama."
Joy,6,1,1,28 July 2016," somewhat bumpy road to success
","Joy Mangano (Jennifer Lawrence) was the high school valedictorian but stayed home to care for her divorcing parents (Robert De Niro, Virginia Madsen). She finds herself stuck in life. Her ex-husband Tony Miranne (Édgar Ramírez) is living in the basement. Her mother watches soaps all day. Her house is falling apart. Her father is forced to live with her. He's closer to her older half-sister Peggy (Elisabeth Röhm). She has always invented but her family is not supportive. She comes up with a new mop. With money from her father's girlfriend Trudy (Isabella Rossellini) and help from everyone including best friend Jackie (Dascha Polanco), Joy struggles to navigate the business world. Tony gets her an interview with Neil Walker (Bradley Cooper), an executive at the new TV station QVC.This is a family where everybody talks but nobody listens. Directer David O. Russell wants to make them funny but I find them mostly annoying. It's a bumpy road where the quirky humor doesn't work and the drama seems very standard. There is an interesting dramatic story here but it's only the last act where it gets compelling. Russell overwhelms a good dramatic scene when her family forces her to go bankrupt with some badly overwrought writing. Then it goes into one of the best confrontation in the movie. This is a mostly flat movie that is highlighted by good work from Lawrence and a few good scenes."
Coach Carter,7,0,0,20 March 2014," Earnest After School Special
","Successful sporting goods store owner Ken Carter (Samuel L. Jackson) accepts the basketball coach job from his mentor at his old high school. It's a poor underachieving school. He forces his kids to sign a contract to maintain academics. He calls the kids 'sir' as a sign of respect. It's a struggle with the kids, but it's even more of a struggle with the adults. It climaxes to a point where coach Carter locks out the players when they don't maintain their academics.This is all a very earnest after school special. Coach Carter is a saint beyond reproach. The thing that I wish for is an early ally for Carter. It seems that everybody especially the adults are piling on. Even if true, it doesn't make for a compelling story. It's overkill. An ally could create more complex relationships in the adults of the movie.The other thing I noticed is that the movie reaches its climax around the lockout. The games after the lockout don't have much drama. The movie is about the lockout, not about any championships or game winners."
Moon,7,0,3,19 September 2014," Sam Rockwell great
","Sam Bell (Sam Rockwell) is near the end of a 3 year contract to mine He-3 on the far side of the moon for Lunar Industries. He is the only person on the base with no direct link to Earth. His only companion is the computer GERTY. He gets recorded messages from his wife Tess (Dominique McElligott). He fears that he's hallucinating. Then he crashes one of the harvester. When he wakes up, GERTY is keeping him from leaving. He finally goes to the crashed harvester and finds another him. The first Sam Bell wakes up frustrated at finding out that he's a clone.The movie has a bit of eerie mystery at the beginning, but the movie isn't necessarily trying to hide anything. Everything from the clones to the end is obvious. The good part of this movie is the performance of Sam Rockwell. He's great as always. In this, he's playing two distinct characters. However without a big mystery, the drive for the movie is diminished. It's just a matter of watching Rockwell acting against himself."

","In Detroit, comic book store clerk Clarence Worley (Christian Slater) falls for hooker Alabama Whitman (Patricia Arquette) who was hired by his boss as a birthday present. They get marry. He kills her pimp. They steal his cocaine. That's when things start to go wrong.Tony Scott directs this violent outrageous movie, but it's Quentin Tarantino's dialogue that makes it stands out. Coming after 'Reservoir Dogs', Quentin was still an unknown quantity. I loved the wild dialog but didn't know anything about Quentin when I first saw this. Christopher Walken and Dennis Hopper have a crazy exchange. I remember sitting up and taking notice like a new voice has come to American cinema. It's years later when I noticed Tarantino's name as the writer and it all makes sense. A name is given to the voice. Would you do Elvis if your life depended on it?"
Happy Feet,6,0,0,27 December 2013," fine animated fare for the kids
","Mumble (Elijah Wood) is an emperor penguin who's born a little late and a little odd. He can't sing which he needs to have a Heartsong to find his true love. All he can do is tap dancing. He is always the runt of the group and an outcast.The penguins are cute. The underdog story is universal. The thing is I didn't find all that much funny about this movie. It's definitely more cute than funny. The 'latino' Adélie penguins just doesn't strike me as funny. They are just talking fast for the sake of talking fast. As for the singing and dancing, it's a bit of fun but it isn't that compelling. This is probably a lot more for the kids than for the adults."
Her,7,0,4,9 June 2014," Romance in need of human contact
","Theodore Twombly (Joaquin Phoenix) is divorcing his wife Catherine Klausen (Rooney Mara) and drifting into a lonely existence. He's a letter writer and his most important relationship is to technology. Then he takes up an offer for the new OS1. It gave herself the name Samantha (Scarlett Johansson). Samantha seems more than a program and he finds himself falling for her more than any real human being.One thing is certain. Spike Jonze is an original. Scarlett plays Samantha like a real human being. I like the concept but I'm not sure if it's as good of a movie as everybody is saying. There is something about a real relationship that works best with human contact. Even a long distance relationship has two physical persons on the screen. The lack of a human body really holds it back although that's the point. She is a fantasy like a 1-900 number. It's just a very sophisticated version. It tries to get weird with a third person. However it could never be weird enough. I'm reminded of Cronenberg's Videodrome where James Woods dive into kissing the TV. It never goes that far. It approaches going for the next level but the movie fizzles out. It takes a weak way to wrap things up. In the end, Theodore is let off the hook. He doesn't have to be proactive and the story resolves itself."
Slumdog Millionaire,7,0,3,11 May 2014," The only thing I don't like is the game show
","Jamal Malik (Dev Patel) is a resident of the Mumbai slums. He is on India's version of 'Who Wants To Be A Millionaire?' He is one question away from winning it all, but the police arrest him on suspicion of cheating. The police (Irrfan Khan) tortures him and Jamal tells them his life story where he learned the answers to each one of the questions. Brothers Salim and Jamal are left orphans after a mob killed their mother. They take in Latika who was also left alone by the same mob. Jamal would spend his life rescuing his one true love Latika.This is directed by Danny Boyle. It's done with great skills. I love the exotic locations of Indian. It is beautifully filmed with great energy. I love the little kids. The little kid covered with excrement is hilarious. Their stories are compelling. The one thing I don't like about the movie is actually the game show. It feels very cheesy like that TV game show. It revels in its cheesiness, and that bleeds into the movie. I think it's meant to increase the fun content of the movie and it's a great way to construct the backbone of the movie. For me, the game show and police interrogation are more like speed bumps that break up the more interesting story of the 3 kids. I almost wish to watch the movie without the game show backdrop. Quite frankly, I wish the show and the questions were more interesting. The only thing that I find fascinating about the game show is the host's attempt to trick Jamal."
The Nice Guys,8,2,5,18 April 2017," fun action crime drama
","It's 1977 Los Angeles. Porn actress Misty Mountains crashes into a house and dies. Mrs. Glenn is certain that her niece is alive and hires private investigator Holland March (Ryan Gosling) who starts tracking Amelia. Amelia hires professional muscle Jackson Healy (Russell Crowe) to stop her stalker. Jackson breaks Holland's arm assuming resolution to the case. Then, two other thugs break into his place. He partners with Holland and his sassy daughter Holly to save Amelia. In the process, they discover a labyrinthine conspiracy involving a porn movie.This is lots of fun. Shane Black takes us on a wild, irreverent ride. The cherry on top is the connection between Gosling and Crowe. They have great chemistry. Gosling is comically broad without being too broad. The little girl is fun, too. Shane knows this genre and is able to twist it in interesting ways. The story is engaging enough to follow and this is simply fun."
Mad Max: Fury Road,9,3,7,2 January 2016," unrelenting action
","Max (Tom Hardy) is haunted by his past failures to save the innocent. He is captured by Immortan Joe and his men. Imperator Furiosa (Charlize Theron) is driving the war rig to transport to Gas Town and Bullet Farm. Instead, she has freed Immortan Joe's imprisoned wives and escaping back to her former home, the Green Place. Max is chained as a blood bag on the front of his car with War Boy Nux (Nicholas Hoult).The action is unrelenting. The car stunts are amazing and fully worthy of the Mad Max name. It is pure energy on screen. The only thing missing is a gyrocopter and Mel Gibson. Tom Hardy is physically acceptable as Mad Max although I'm not thrilled with the character. He's lost a bit of the spark. The spark he lost has been transferred to Furiosa and has lit a blazing inferno. She is more Mad Max than Mad Max. I am also pleasantly surprised that Rosie Huntington-Whiteley is actually good in this movie. The action, the outrageous vehicles and the pure energy make this something unlike anything else. I would suggest putting the stunts in the closing credits Jackie Chan style."
Hacksaw Ridge,7,2,6,12 May 2017," aw shucks sincerity
","Desmond Doss (Andrew Garfield) grew up with his brother Hal, his loving mother Bertha (Rachel Griffiths), and volatile drunken father Tom (Hugo Weaving) who returned damaged from the Great War. His mother's religious upbringing and childhood traumas lead him to be a Seventh-day Adventist. He falls in love with nurse Dorothy Schutte (Teresa Palmer). To his father's dismay, Hal joins the military. Desmond joins anyways but he insists on being a conscientious objector. His view clashes with Sergeant Howell (Vince Vaughn) and the military commanders. He even faces court-martial. During the Battle of Okinawa, he becomes the last man to leave Hacksaw Ridge after being over-run and ends up saving many of his comrades.Andrew Garfield does his aw shucks puppy-face acting which I find a bit annoying. It's deliberately naive at times. A corollary of that happens with his reasoning for joining the military. He seems to join out of embarrassment. I want him to be more resolute in his religious belief and I need him to state his need to save more directly. There is a comparison to Gary Cooper's Sergeant York whose religious conversion is spelled out more clearly. The solution is all right there in the movie. He needs to save his brother or somebody like his brother. He just needs to do is say that.Mel Gibson is a highly skilled director and the action is top notch. The movie can be heavy-handed at times. On the other hand, the heaviest-handed moment of him walking alone into a field of artillery fire is probably the best moment in the movie. It is a balancing act. It works most of the times but Mel can push it too far into overwrought territory. Overall, he has created a movie in his own vision and that's pretty compelling."
Warcraft,5,6,11,20 June 2016," well drawn CGI
","Orc warlock Gul'dan drains life out of prisoners for the fel magic to open a portal to Azeroth for an orc horde to cross. He aims to reopen the portal to bring an entire army to the new world. Durotan is the chief of the Frostwolf Clan. Blackhand is a rival and the military commander. Meanwhile, human commander Anduin Lothar has renegade mage Khadgar prisoner who suspects a malicious magical force. King Llane Wrynn rules Stormwind Kingdom and Medivh is the Guardian of the realm. Garona is a captured half-orc.One of the most important hurdles for this movie is if the CGI is believable. It is able to clear that hurdle. The orcs are major characters and their believability is essential for this to work. It is the bare minimum. In fact, the orcs are some of the more compelling characters in the movie. The CGI is flashy but the story itself is a messy cauldron of old fantasy conflicts. The story should be simplified and concentrated down to one idea. Most of it drags along in a grinding exposition. Much of it is slow. One has to stay alert to understand this world especially for people like me who have never played the game. Some of the motivations are questionable. The action is great but I'm often not thrilled by it. Durotan's fight with Gul'dan is probably the most compelling. I really get to care about Durotan. There are probably too many characters going off every which way. This movie would work much better as a simple quest or road movie with Durotan as the lead."
The Runaways,8,1,2,26 October 2014," Formulaic but well done
","Cherie Currie (Dakota Fanning) is a rebellious teen winning her 10th grade talent contest as David Bowie. Joan Jett (Kristen Stewart) is a tough bisexual teen sniffing glue and playing her guitar. She faces a lot of sexist attitudes. She approaches record producer Kim Fowley (Michael Shannon) outside a club to start an all-girl band. Kim introduces Joan to drummer Sandy West (Stella Maeve). Then Kim and Joan recruit Cherie into the band. Kim toughens the girls into an edgy rock band.Dakota Fanning is trying to do more rougher roles. Kristen Stewart has a good handle on the tough young chick character. The girls do a good job. Then there is Michael Shannon. He is amazing in this. This is not necessarily a ground breaking music bio. In fact, it follows the try-and-true formula of all such movies. It just does it very well. Also it has some pretty good music."
Me Before You,6,1,4,18 November 2016," sappy romance
","Louisa 'Lou' Clark (Emilia Clarke) makes a cup of tea to solve every problem. She's 26, living at home with her mother, unemployed father, senile grandpa, sister Treena (Jenna Coleman), and Treena's son Tom. She loses her waitress job and the family needs her to get another job. Her boyfriend Patrick is more interested in running than interested in her. The Traynors are the rich family in town and the former lords of the castle. Camilla Traynor (Janet McTeer) hires her for six months to assist her paralyzed son Will Traynor (Sam Claflin) who was run over by a motorcycle two years ago. Will is bitter at losing his globe-trotting outgoing lifestyle with his girlfriend Alicia and high-finance friends. He is cold to the quirky Lou at first. Alicia announces that she's getting married to his former best friend. Then Lou overhears Camilla arguing with her husband Stephen (Charles Dance) about Will's plan to get euthanized in Switzerland in six months. Lou struggles to give Will a reason for living as male nurse Nathan helps her to understand his pain.This is a sappy romance. There's nothing wrong with that but it's really uninspired in its execution. The best thing in this movie is Emilia Clarke being allowed to be her natural goofy-grin self. This version of her is really charming and winning. The infuriating part is Will's refusal to live his new life. Nathan explains that Will really tried the first year and that he's hiding his painful existence from Lou. The movie does not do a good job portraying that idea and therefore leaves Will's reasoning bare-thread. They need a scene where Will is actively trying to hide his pain. His reason cannot be a lack of a James Bond lifestyle."
The Breakfast Club,9,1,2,3 November 2013," iconic 80s John Hughes movie
","Five students have Saturday detention in Shermer High School. Teacher Richard Vernon (Paul Gleason) is tasked to monitor the kids and orders them to write an essay. They would call themselves the Breakfast Club consisting of the Brain Brian Johnson (Anthony Michael Hall), an Athlete Andrew Clark (Emilio Estevez) , Basket Case Allison Reynolds (Ally Sheedy), Princess Claire Standish (Molly Ringwald), and the Criminal John Bender (Judd Nelson).They would talk, fight and become friends. It's got all of the John Hughes moves. It's got a song and dance. It's got his teen dialog which was unlike most teen movies, and so real. Many that followed would be heavily influenced by his style and it would become the new standard for a teen movie. It's arguable that he created his own category of films that would become a main staples of movies. John Hughes plus 'Fast Times at Ridgemont High' would usher in the 80s teen movies."

","Maximus (Russell Crowe) is a powerful and popular Roman general. Emperor Marcus Aurelius is an aging ruler who prefers Maximus than his own conniving son Commodus (Joaquin Phoenix). After Commodus kills his own father, Maximus refuses to acknowledge the new emperor and his family is slaughtered. He falls into slavery and the gladiator arenas.The scale is a grand. The use of CG is top notch. It really expanded the visual experience to the required spectacle. Russell Crowe takes on the big Hollywood leading man role with ease. Joaquin Phoenix is well conceived as the evil foil to Crowe. The movie has the big battles, and the fun gladiator fights. It is grand in the best traditions of Hollywood."

Her mother died in childbirth and her dad died when she was a child. Kent (William Fichtner) is a blind researcher. Palmer Joss (Matthew McConaughey) is a religious writer who becomes her romantic partner. David Drumlin (Tom Skerritt) is the bottom-line head at the observatory who shuts her down. Four years later, she is still the outcast as funding and facilities dry up. Then she finds an extraterrestrial signal. Drumlin and NSA adviser Michael Kitz (James Woods) take over. Hadden (John Hurt) is an eccentric tycoon who has been supporting her.It's a brainier science fiction. The first half is exciting in the non-action way. It is smart. It tries to add in some action but it is unable to transition. It may be better not to transition. Also Robert Zemeckis overdoes the space travel and the other world. The religious debate takes up too much space and gets a bit clunky. The logic of hiding such a massive construction is highly questionable. The first half rivals any of the best sci-fi and the second half isn't bad either."
Donnie Darko,8,1,4,10 April 2015," cool premise and unique blend
","It's 1988 upper class suburb Middlesex, Virginia. Donnie Darko (Jake Gyllenhaal) is a disturbed kid who talks to a giant creepy bunny called Frank and disappears at night. His parents (Mary McDonnell, Holmes Osborne) have him talking to psychiatrist Dr. Lilian Thurman (Katharine Ross). Frank tells him that the world is ending in 28 days. A jet engine crashes into his room while he's away sleepwalking. No one knows where it came from. He falls for new student Gretchen Ross (Jena Malone). The school is flooded and English teacher Karen Pomeroy (Drew Barrymore)'s assignment is blamed. Gym teacher Kitty Farmer (Beth Grant) begins to teach lessons from motivational speaker Jim Cunningham (Patrick Swayze). His science teacher Dr. Kenneth Monnitoff (Noah Wyle) gives him a time travel book written by local mad woman Roberta Sparrow.I love the weird moody style. It's got a surreal suburbia that feels more like the small town in Blue Velvet. It's a beautiful place on the surface hiding an ugly core. Frank is just weird and Jake Gyllenhaal plays off of it with a disturbing performance. There is the crazy sci-fi element. All of it mash together in one of the most unique blend. The 80s music is terrific. I also didn't notice Seth Rogen was in this until watching much later. The final ending is a little bit confusing and I'm not sure what it all means. I would have preferred one that wraps up with more sense."
Pocahontas,6,0,1,21 November 2017," Disney history
",It's 1607 London. Governor Ratcliffe leads an expedition looking to find a mountain of gold in exploiting the new world. Swashbuckling ship captain John Smith (Mel Gibson) encounters native princess Pocahontas and they fall in love. The two sides are on a collision course to war and only the two lovers can stop it.History as Disney princess drama can be dangerous territories. This one papers over some stuff leaving a questionable rendering from a kiddie history book. Ratcliffe is imbued with all the cartoon villainy. John Smith is the square jawed soldier with limited charisma and Pocahontas is the perfect heroine. The English side is not that compelling. It's too broad and too Disney. I find the native side much more compelling. It would serve the movie well to concentrate more on their point of view. It doesn't need the scenes from the English side. This does have the great song Colors of the Wind by Vanessa Williams as is in the Disney tradition. This is more Disney than history lesson. That's the only concern I have with this movie. Kids wouldn't understand the liberties taken with facts and adult wouldn't find this that compelling.
Transformers: Dark of the Moon,6,1,5,18 August 2013," Rosie Huntington-Whiteley is Oscar Worthy!!!!
","(end sarcasm)Michael Bay mounts another overblown monstrosity. The cash machine needs to be continuously replenished. Shia LaBeouf reprises his role for maybe the last time. Rosie Huntington-Whiteley takes over as the new eye candy. If only she can stand there and not talk.... or act, or react. She makes me pine for Megan Fox. Shame on her. Megan is a master craftsman compare to this. Josh Duhamel also returns. In the end, the story is meaningless. The acting is almost as meaningless. The action is the key. All that matters is the action. And there is nothing new anymore from this franchise. The super slo-mo is more a hindrance. I think it's meant to look to super cool in 3D but after the millionth time, all it does is slow down the movie. I love the action and the explosions. That's all we have left in this movie."
Born on the Fourth of July,8,1,9,15 October 2014," Some of the best from Tom Cruise
","Ron Kovic (Tom Cruise) is an all-American boy from Massapequa, Long Island dreaming of growing up to be a soldier. He's a high school wrestler in a patriotic family. He eagerly leads his friends to join the Marines. He soon finds himself in the thick of the murky Vietnam war. His squad is ambushed in 1968 and he's paralyzed. The VA hospital is an ugly mess. When he comes home a year later, he is still a huge supporter of the war but the town and even his family is divided. His friend Timmy (Frank Whaley) was also in Vietnam and has returned. His high school love Donna (Kyra Sedgwick) has become a peace activist at Syracuse University.Oliver Stone is skillfully navigating this bio-pic. There are parts that seems a little bit rushed. The war is basically two battles. It is probably Tom Cruise at his best. It takes the best of him. He is always intense. That's his best character. He starts out as a true believer. Then he goes big as he loses his belief until he starts to believe something else. The change over the course of the movie is some of the best work of his career."

","Starting in 2003, Harvard University student Mark Zuckerberg (Jesse Eisenberg) with the help and money from his roommate Eduardo Saverin (Andrew Garfield) first create a website called 'FaceMash' where pictures of female students are pitted against each other to create a ranking. This got him into trouble with the school, and recruited by Divya Narendra (Max Minghella) and the Winklevoss twins (Armie Hammer) to work on their social networking site. However he ends up launching his own site with Saverin which would eventually be known as 'Facebook' with the help of internet entrepreneur Sean Parker (Justin Timberlake). Zuckerberg and Saverin would fall out leading to the lawsuit which is the basis of the flashbacks.Everything starts with the collaboration between director David Fincher and writer Aaron Sorkin. The snappy dialog from Sorkin sings off the lips of Eisenberg. Fincher's directions infuse the movie with energy. And Garfield creates humanity in his character. This Zuckerberg is a stand-offish awkward creature with full knowledge of his superiority. It is an unique character and an unique film."
The Wedding Singer,7,1,1,29 October 2013," Sweet lovable duo
","Robbie Hart (Adam Sandler) is a lowly wedding singer. He gets left at the alter, and finds a true friend in waitress Julia Sullivan (Drew Barrymore) who's engaged to a douche.Drew Barrymore is supremely cute and lovable. Adam Sandler is still likable as the lovable loser. Together they make a wonderful on screen couple. She lights up the screen and he puts her on a pedestal.The music is stacked with great 80s hits. It has all the kitschy 80s touch. It makes all the fun in the world. The story is as predictable as most rom-coms. The humor is heart warming and sweet. Funniest bit has to be tranny bandmate George (Alexis Arquette) who keeps singing 'Do You Really Want To Hurt Me'. It's not surprising that the script has so many great comedians who worked on it."

","It's 1992 Bosnia-Herzegovina. Muslim Ajla goes out to a mixed party which gets bombed. Four months later, Serb forces have arrived. The men are executed. Ajla and some of the girls are bused to a Serb camp to service the soldiers. She finds former suitor Danijel who is now commanding the Serb camp. He tries to protect her as they begin a dangerous secret relationship.The subject matter is harrowing and Angelina Jolie deserves some credit for tackling it. However, one gets a sense that she has taken on too much as writer/producer/director. It lingers on the disturbing like a horror movie. It definitely doesn't fling and it's a grind to watch. This is a long bloated slough which is tough to sit through."
Macbeth,6,1,1,14 December 2016," dark stark take
","This is a dark, bloody, stark take on the classic Shakespearian play. Michael Fassbender plays the iconic Macbeth and Marion Cotillard plays Lady Macbeth. In Scotland, Macbeth supports King Duncan (David Thewlis) in the civil war and comes out victorious. The witches make prophecies. It is a tale of ambition, power, and self-fulfilling tragedies.The cinematic visuals take advantage of the stark Scottish landscape. It wallows in the blood and mud. Even the slow motion blood dripping add to the mood. However, it does feel like style over substance. Sometimes people mumble. Sometimes it just doesn't sing. I'm looking at the Out Spot speech and the emotional power is faded. I wouldn't say anybody is bad but I want to feel more from Fassbender and company. It does take the familiar material into more compelling spaces."
The Pursuit of Happyness,7,0,0,9 February 2014," Will Smith good in one note movie

He gets a job as a stock broker but it's an internship that pays nothing. Eventually, he loses his apartment and they become homeless.It's a very earnest movie. This is not a movie with laughs. Will Smith is playing a very intense character. Jaden Smith is too young to be anything other than a prop. Will is able to paint a picture of a desperate man trying to stay with his kid. It is however the same note that gets played over and over again. The good news is that he plays that note very well."
Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade,7,3,7,25 December 2013," Great duo of Harrison Ford and Sean Connery
","Indiana Jones is trying to correct the perception that he's a grave robber in the first section. As a teen, he tries to rescue an important gold artifact and later as an adult, he finally steals it back from a ruthless collector. Now there is a tablet about the location of the Holy Grail. Indy must stop the Nazis once again and rescue his father (Sean Connery).It's a return more to the original and abandoning the stupidity of 'Temple of Doom'. This time they have Sean Connery to play opposite Harrison Ford. It takes awhile to get them together, but once there, they make a great duo. I love their banter. Their chemistry saves this movie from being a sad reminder of better times."

",Marty McFly (Michael J. Fox) is an average teen from a lower middle class family. His friend Dr. Emmett Brown (Christopher Lloyd) has invented a time traveling DeLorean. Dr Brown is about to travel back in time when the Libyans attack. Marty only escapes by using the DeLorean to go back to 1955. He changes history and must change it back before he disappears all together.Robert Zemeckis has woven together a wonderful charming story. It's perfectly constructed time loop. It certainly is one of the best feel good movie. Michael J Fox is the perfect guy to play the boy next door character. His interaction with his mother Lea Thompson in the past is wonderfully hilarious and Christopher Lloyd is perfect as the oddball scientist.
Goodfellas,10,1,2,29 December 2013," This is an American Classic
","Henry Hill (Ray Liotta) worked for Italian mobsters as a kid. He would climb the ladder as he becomes a big time gangster with his friends Tommy DeVito (Joe Pesci) and James Conway (Robert De Niro). Director Martin Scorsese brings the Nicholas Pileggi book 'Wiseguy' alive.For an American gangster movie, there is none better than the great acting in this classic. There is no more iconic performance than Joe Pesci. 'What do you mean I'm funny?' Robert De Niro is only the third most outrageous performer. Even the constant Ray Liotta narration worked perfectly, and I'm not usually a fan of narrations. Scorsese is a true master. The steady cam entry into Copacabana is first rate. (I know they made a big loop around the kitchen.) And this movie starts a bang, literally."
The Bourne Supremacy,7,0,1,28 October 2013," good Paul Greengrass action
","Jason Bourne (Matt Damon) and Marie (Franka Potente) are living off the radar. He's still haunted by his partly forgotten past. But then the hidden world comes and destroy their small bit of happiness. A CIA plan under Deputy Director Pamela Landy (Joan Allen) gets double crossed and Jason Bourne gets framed for it. Jason must return to clear the mess.This is the return of a complicated plot. It's tough to follow watching the first time around. What the audience gets is director Paul Greengrass' expert grasp on action, and Jason Bourne's robotic efficiency. What's missing is the warmth of a love story with Marie. It's a rather cold desolation that could have used more fire of anger and vengeance."
The Great Gatsby,8,4,6,15 August 2013," Lush Delicious Thumping
","Nick Carraway (Tobey Maguire) recalls his time with Jay Gatsby (Leonardo DiCaprio). It's 1922 on Long Island. Nick rents a small house next to Jay's mansion. He is constantly throwing big parties. Nick is visited by his cousin Daisy Buchanan (Carey Mulligan) and her husband Tom (Joel Edgerton).Baz Luhrmann definitely injects his vision of the roaring 20s. The music is perfect. The movie has the grandiose vision that it so desperately needs. Leonardo DiCaprio is perfect for this role. In many ways, he brings his real life and breathes it into this character. His real life models-filled-partying ways make it so realistic. Carey Mulligan brings a more sweet sensibility. However Tobey Maguire and his non-stop literary narration isn't always needed. Unlike the visuals, more is not always the best. What is truly needed is a solid lens for the audience to view the proceedings. Tobey is more a shaky cam. The last 1/3 is too slow. It needs a more tension filled resolution. All in all, it's beautiful and Leo's perfect."
The Proposal,5,2,2,3 November 2013," great comedic actors doing badly written characters

When she is about to be deported for her immigration problems, she forces her assistant to marry her. An INS agent is going to test them, so they must spend time together for her to learn about him. Only he has to fly home to Alaska for his grandma Annie (Betty White)'s 90th birthday.Sandra Bullock's character is way too unlikeable and she's miscast. They need an actress who plays meanies. Then she can melt and become a good person and blah blah blah... There's no doubt that Bullock and Reynolds are great comedic actors. They just need a better story. Betty White had some fun. And having Bullock and Reynolds naked was quite funny."
Shark Tale,4,0,3,17 February 2014," Can't take Oscar's cynical lying character
","Oscar (Will Smith) is a tiny prey fish working at a Whale Wash. Like everybody else, he cowers in fear of the sharks. In a freak accident, he survives a shark attack, and everybody believes that he actually killed the shark mobster's son. He encounters the shark mobster's other son Lenny (Jack Black) who is a vegetarian and they concoct a great scheme to increase his reputation as the Shark Slayer.First off, I don't like Oscar's character. Second I don't really like the Godfather motif. The animation is OK for the era, but I don't really like their faces either. The automatic comparison is to 'Finding Nemo' from a year earlier. The one word I describe Nemo is joy. This one leaves me feeling the blues. Oscar is a cynical fish, and his well being is of little importance to me. Also none of it is funny. It's just a bunch of quirky fish equivalence to the real world."
13 Hours,8,2,8,22 June 2016," confusion thriller
","Jack Silva (John Krasinski) leaves his young family to join his friend Tyrone Woods (James Badge Dale) to work as security contractors for the CIA Annex in Benghazi, Libya. Both are veterans of clandestine security and former SEAL instructors. It's the wild west awashed in weapons. CIA station chief Bob is dismissive and derisive of their security concerns. Ambassador Chris Stevens arrives to work out of a lightly defended compound. On Sept 11, 2012, tension is high. When the compound is attacked, Stevens and his men retreat to a safe room. Tyrone and his men go on a rescue mission despite Bob's 'Stand Down' order.I was concerned that this would be politically skewed one way or another. Either way would be bad. This movie mostly leaves that to the professionals. The initial American villain is the CIA station chief. This is more about these contractors and the confusion of the battlefield. The movie builds a wonderful world of threats. There is a reality to the paranoia and the first part is done very well. Most of the movie is actually after the compound takeover. Some of it blends into each other. It's hard to distinguish the players. There are loads of things getting blown up. I can accept the confusion because the actual situation was probably just as confusing. What this movie shows is the impossibility of distinguishing the good guys from the bad guys. It is the fog of war and mission impossible."
Hustle & Flow,8,0,0,28 April 2014," Not the usual blaxsploitation
","DJay (Terrence Howard) is a Memphis pimp and a drug dealer with a dream. His hoe Nola (Taryn Manning) is actually more of a friendly co-worker. Shug (Taraji P. Henson) is a pregnant mess. When he buys a kid's keyboard from a street drunk, he renews his music dreams. He bumps into his old schoolmate Key (Anthony Anderson) who with Shelby (DJ Qualls) helps him record his songs. It's a struggle as he hustles for the recordings and the chance to get his music played. He aims to bring his music to successful rapper Skinny Black (Ludacris), but it's a long winding road.This movie has loads of atmosphere due to the gritty Memphis locations. On the surface, it's another blaxsploitation movie about the hustle, rappers, drug deals, pimps and hoes. But it's much more about the downtrodden who still have their own dreams. It takes the stereotypical characters and give them life. Also there's a scattering of white characters here. So it's not a simple movie about pimps and hoes. Then there is also the great music. There is still no other Oscar winning song quite like 'It's Hard Out Here for a Pimp'. The performances are superb especially Terence Howard. Even Anthony Anderson puts in a solid dramatic performance."
Warm Bodies,7,2,2,27 November 2013," Zombie Love
","R (Nicholas Hoult) is a zombie, but he's trying to remember his human life. He's barely about to grunt a word out, and he has a friend (Rob Corddry) sort of. While hunting, R runs into human Julie. He falls for the girl, and saves her from the zombie pack.There are a lot of zombie movies out there. I mean aaaalottttt. So it's not surprising that people are trying to explore a more expansive zombie universe. Zombies are faster, slower, funnier, and parodied. Now zombies are falling in love.It's something new. I wouldn't say it's funny. It's not. It is curious, and somewhat sweet. Nicholas Hoult is a good emo zombie. The difficulty lies with the grunting halting speech. It makes the dialog hard to listen to. This makes the interior narration absolutely vital. It was probably important to try even more internal dialog.As for Teresa Palmer, I'm not sure she's star material. She's a really pretty girl. I really like her, but I still see her as the girlfriend character. The other girl in the movie is Analeigh Tipton. She might be marginally better as the lead. She seems to have a little more comedic skills.I am very happy that people aren't just doing the same old zombie movie over and over again. This story had obvious obstacles. I think it overcame most of them relatively well."
The Birds,7,2,6,29 November 2013," takes too long to start
","Melanie Daniels (Tippi Hedren) is a wealthy San Francisco lady who falls for handsome combative Mitch Brenner (Rod Taylor). She follows him to coastal small town Bodega Bay, and finds him there with his mother Lydia (Jessica Tandy) and sister (Veronica Cartwright). She rents a room from school teacher Annie Hayworth (Suzanne Pleshette). Melanie and the town get attacked by birds.I find that Tippi Hedren has an air of entitlement. And I didn't see much in Rod Taylor other than his rugged good looks. I don't feel much chemistry between them. It makes the long setup very tedious. I don't find their courtship compelling although the bird store was kinda cute.It takes too long to get the birds started. The effects look good especially considering the times. It has some excitement, but I don't think it has enough tension. Birds attacking is just not a phobia that most people have, other than bird poop. Once they stop attacking, the birds aren't that scary."
Sully,7,3,3,21 July 2017," Hanks is Sully
","It's a cold morning on Jan 15, 2009. Captain Chesley Sullenberger (Tom Hanks) and his first officer Jeff Skiles (Aaron Eckhart) survive bird strikes and the lost of both engines to safely land the US Airways Flight 1549 in the middle of the Hudson River. All 155 aboard are rescued. Despite being almost universally herald as a hero, the NTSB investigation starts raising questions and Sully is haunted by the incident.Hanks is Sully. He embodies the easy natural goodness the role entails. The recreation of the incident is compelling. Eastwood should be more careful about doing the incident twice. The second time needs to be sufficiently different from the first. Then there is the clunky NTSB villainy. The flawed computer simulations need to be expanded. Otherwise, it's hard to buy the dangers to Sully. I wonder if a straight docu-style recreation would be more compelling."
Princess Mononoke,7,1,3,18 June 2015," some great concepts but dialog needs work
","In feudal Japan, Ashitaka protects his village and kills an attacking demon boar. Part of the curse infects his arm. Village elder tells him to travel west to find a cure and encounters a monk who tells him about the great forest spirit. In Irontown, he finds leader Lady Eboshi who freed girls from the brothels and trying to perfect her guns. She is cutting down the forest and killing its animals. Her holy grail is to cut off the head of the forest spirit. She is opposed by animals of the forest and Princess Mononoke who was raised by wolves.I really like the spirits of the forest. I wonder if the movie needs a true villain. Lady Eboshi is more of a Captain Ahab character. The conflict doesn't have the same punch. The other main problem is the clunky dubbed dialog. It really takes work to make the dialog sound natural and not just simple translations. Overall, this has some great imaginative concepts and spirits. This is a special animated movie."
Cinderella Man,8,0,0,2 February 2014," Great emotional story
","James J. Braddock (Russell Crowe) was a successful up and coming fighter. By 1933, he is broken down and like the rest of the world impoverished. He can't pay his bills. His family is suffering. He struggles on with smaller fights, nagging injuries, and little work. Then they revoke his license to fight. He hits bottom. His kids are sent away. He goes on public assistance and ends up begging for money. His long time trainer Joe Gould (Paul Giamatti) gets a short notice fight with the number 2 heavyweight contender but he surprised everybody by winning.The one word for the Braddock character is dignity. He never lost his even as he hit rock bottom. It's a very compelling character, and Russell Crowe plays it perfectly. Both Renée Zellweger and Paul Giamatti are terrific in this. The fight action is well done and exciting. The best part of the movie is probably when the family is down to nothing. It's a superb movie from a great director with a compelling story."
Jurassic Park,9,3,5,2 January 2014," Great filmmaking
","Nutty John Hammond (Richard Attenborough) has invited Dr. Grant (Sam Neill), Dr. Sattler (Laura Dern), Dr. Malcolm (Jeff Goldblum), the company lawyer (Martin Ferrero) and his 2 grandkids to test out his Jurassic Park. Hammond has successfully cloned dinosaurs from the blood found in mosquitoes trapped in amber.It's a thrill ride using the state of the art CGI. The audience at the time would marvel at the realistic CG dinosaurs. It takes about an hour to set up and get to the exciting part. And Spielberg has more than just CGI to get the thrills. His mastery delivers one of the simplest and most iconic shot in the movie, the pulsing water. This and 'Schindler's List' would bookend his great year, and cement his greatest."
Beetlejuice,9,1,1,18 October 2013," Tim Burton goes big time
","Adam (Alec Baldwin) and Barbara Maitland (Geena Davis) are a young happy couple in lovely house. They die in a car accident and are left stranded to haunt their home. The annoying advant garde Deetzs (Jeffrey Jones, Catherine O'Hara, Winona Ryder) move in, and the Maitlands are helpless to scare them off. Finally they get a specialist Betelgeuse (Michael Keaton) to excise the living from their house.Tim Burton is a complete original, and this is the first tastes of his quirky visual sense. It's too obvious to say this is an original vision. Consider that it is so original that nobody really has done anything similar since other than maybe Burton himself.The great thing is that the story works as well. It's funny. It's cute. It's heart warming. I love the characters, and the actors are all great in their performances. Of course Michael Keaton goes crazy in this one. But Catherine O'Hara is also hilarious, and Winona Ryder is absolutely winning in this."
Valkyrie,7,0,0,8 September 2015," reserved competent work
",Colonel Claus von Stauffenberg (Tom Cruise) is disillusioned with Hitler and the war. He abhors the atrocities committed by the SS. He is severely injured in North Africa. Major-General Henning von Tresckow (Kenneth Branagh) is the military leader of a coup but his attempt to kill Hitler fails. General Friedrich Olbricht (Bill Nighy) recruits von Stauffenberg who comes up with a plan to use Operation Valkyrie which is set up to maintain order after the death of Hitler. They need the head of the reserve army General Friedrich Fromm (Tom Wilkinson) to order Valkyrie while they try to rewrite the operational manual so that the SS won't interfere with the coup.Director Bryan Singer brings a solid workmanship to the production. Tom Cruise's reserved acting lacks a certain excitement. The story is told competently. It could easily be lost in the labyrinth of characters but the awesome cast is able to give each character his due. I'm also glad Singer didn't try to have the cast do fake German accents. The movie does lack the thrills but it still has a low-burning intensity.
The Simpsons Movie,8,3,4,19 January 2014," Not just another episode
","Homer gets a pig (Spider Pig). The problem is all the poop. He dumps it all into the town lake. Like a straw that broke the camel's back, Springfield becomes an environmental nightmare and the EPA encases the town in a giant dome. The Simpsons family escapes and becomes fugitives.I am a fan of the Simpsons from the start. Although there has been a decline in quality after so many years, the movie is top rate with lots of hilarious moments. The humor is random at times but the story is not disjointed. It is not simply a series of episodes or segments of scenes. There is a chaotic cohesive story in all of this. The environmental backdrop pulls it all together, and in the end, it is all about family. Homer learns to think of others."
Alien: Covenant,8,2,4,21 September 2017," sequel improvement
","It's 2104. Colonisation spaceship Covenant is hit by a rogue neutrino burst. The damage causes the crew to be revived killing the captain. They receive a transmission leading to an undiscovered habitable planet. On the planet, they are attacked by creatures and find android David (Michael Fassbender), a castaway from Prometheus which crashed 10 years earlier.Ridley Scott's reboot Prometheus has some interesting ideas and memberberries but it is held back by the whole prequel/connected/unconnected discussion. He should try to be clearer with that stuff for the fans. I try to shed much of that convolution for this sequel. This one adds some depth to David. As Ridley builds out this world, it makes more sense and one can live in it. Two specific incidents of obvious poor decisions by the crew do hold back the movie.I don't know why Chris would trust David after what he witnesses although he was shown to be a weak leader. His bad decisions can be understood as his overall inferiority. On the other hand, Danny is supposed to be the smart one. It's obvious with Walter and David. First of all, there needs to be a scene where Walter shows his missing left hand to prove his identity. Even then, Danny should check. This is missing stuff. It could have been an extra fight to the death. It's not sharp enough. She ain't no Ripley. The creatures are super creepy especially the little ones. The action is all great. I love the fight on the platform ship. All of that works really well and this is a solid sequel."
All the President's Men,9,1,1,28 January 2015," Hoffman and Redford energizes investigation
","It's 1972 and there has been a break-in at the Democratic Party National headquarters at the Watergate hotel. Washington Post editor Howard Simons (Martin Balsam) assigns new reporter Bob Woodward (Robert Redford) to cover the minor story. He is surprised to find top lawyers defending the burglars despite none of the them made a phone call. The burglars claim to have CIA connections and he soon connects them to the White House. Carl Bernstein (Dustin Hoffman) is a rough and tumble veteran local reporter who is also working the case. Simons wants to give it to more experienced writers but local news editor Harry M. Rosenfeld (Jack Warden) defend the pair. Executive editor Benjamin Bradlee (Jason Robards) keeps pushing them to dig harder. Woodward contacts his reluctant connection 'Deep Throat' (Hal Holbrook). The two lowly reporters keep plugging away with no other paper willing to follow the story.This is a movie about real journalism or what we hope real journalism actually is. It's a lot digging, phone calls and investigating. It could have been very dry story but Hoffman and Redford energizes the movie. The movie doesn't jazz up the investigation with car chases or gun fights. This is a hard slough newspaper work. Despite the Byantine labyrinth, the investigation is still coherent for novices with a brain."
Draft Day,6,0,0,7 February 2015," Football soap opera
","It's less than 13 hours before the start of the NFL draft. Seattle Seahawks Walt Gordon (Chi McBride) is looking to trade away the number one draft which is sure to be quarterback Bo Callanhan. Cleveland Browns GM Sonny Weaver Jr. (Kevin Costner) has the number seventh pick and is under tremendous pressure from owner Anthony Molina (Frank Langella). He struggles in the shadow of his legendary father coach and against the loud-mouth present-day coach Penn (Denis Leary). Ali (Jennifer Garner) just told him that he's going to a dad. Vontae Mack (Chadwick Boseman) is desperate to get picked high and is Sonny's preferred candidate. Earl Jennings (Terry Crews) is the father of lineman Ray Jennings (Arian Foster) who got into some gang trouble. Chris Crawford (Sean Combs) is Bo's agent. Then Sonny's mother Barb (Ellen Burstyn) comes with his ex Angie (Rosanna Arquette) to sprinkle his father's ashes on the field.I don't know how a real NFL teams operates but these guys look amateurish. Maybe that's the compelling part about the story. It's a movie about a dysfunctional messy team. The deficiency here is in Sonny. He should be flawed but he shouldn't so flustered. Every move he makes is a struggle. Instead of working the draft or working the deals, he gets sidetracked by everybody and everything. Kevin Costner is trying squeeze every moment of melodrama. It is simply too over-written like a football soap opera. The draft drama is pretty good and salvages it from being completely soapy. It's no accident that Costner's character seems to come alive at that point. It's where the real drama occurs rather than some of the made up ones before then. The worst being his father's ashes like his mother wouldn't care that it's a horribly important day."
The Wizard of Oz,10,5,6,5 October 2013," Iconic American Cinema
","This is a definite 10/10. It is movie history. I don't know why anybody would rate it any less. Based on L. Frank Baum stories, Dorothy (Judy Garland) and her dog Toto are swept up to the land of Oz by a tornado. Together with the Cowardly Lion, the Tin Man, and the Scarecrow, they must follow the yellow brick road to find the Wizard of Oz while being hounded by the Wicked Witch of the West.The colorful visual Technicolor is the best of the day. The iconic songs, and the fun amazing story are just some of what makes this movie great. Not only is it a great movie, it's influences stretches far and wide beyond just a film. It's a cultural standard like Homer or Shakespeare."
The Soloist,6,0,0,17 May 2014," Story needs to find flow
",It's 2005. Los Angeles Times columnist Steve Lopez (Robert Downey Jr.) is looking for his next subject to write about. He discovers mentally ill Nathaniel Ayers (Jamie Foxx) playing his broken violin. He befriends the homeless musician and begins to write about him as well as the homeless of LA. Nathaniel showed some skills as a child and concentrated on music and nothing else. He got as far as Juilliard but dropped out in his second year.There are two good performances from two great actors. It's too bad there isn't something more compelling or that the story isn't told better. I wonder if Nathaniel's life story told straight up wouldn't be better. This is based on the real newspaper columns. Maybe there is too much Steve Lopez. The movie is more about him than Nathaniel. There is way too much about coyote urine which is marginally amusing at best. The story just needs to find that compelling flow.The best part of the movie are the LA skid row scenes. The mass of mentally disturbed is quite shocking and seems like an unreal creation. That's something different at least.
Dodgeball,8,1,2,3 November 2013," Funny Physical Comedy
","White Goodman (Ben Stiller) is a raging douche and owner of Globo Gym. Peter LaFleur (Vince Vaughn) is a slob and the owner of Average Joe's Gymnasium. Peter LaFleur needs $50,000 or else he'll lose his gym to Goodman. LaFleur and the slackers at his gym figure on winning a dodgeball tournament. Goodman forms his own team to stop LaFleur.This is a stupid comedy. It's the good kind of stupid. We're allowed to laugh at the stupidity. That's a gift in the comedy world. Ben Stiller goes way out there as the amped up physical fitness guru. He has a good scene pawing his real life wife Christine Taylor. Even the dodgeball scenes are great. This is great slapsticks."
Rock Star,6,0,0,8 June 2014," Liked Wahlberg
","It's Pittsburg in the 80s. Chris Cole (Mark Wahlberg) idolizes the band Steel Dragon and works tirelessly to emulate them in a tribute band. His girlfriend Emily Poule (Jennifer Aniston) is his biggest fan. He repairs copying machines and still lives at home. His cop brother dismisses his dream. After an on stage fight with his guitarist Rob (Timothy Olyphant), he is kicked out of the band as they want to start playing their own music. Then a surprise call from Steel Dragon guitarist Kirk Cuddy (Dominic West) for Chris to audition for the band as he fires the lead singer Bobby Beers.Mark Wahlberg has good likability as the dreamer and does a good rock star imitation. Jennifer Aniston is pretty good. She isn't doing anything out of her comfort zone. There are some rocking music even if Marky Mark doesn't do the singing. It's an earnest recreation like a tribute band. What this movie needs is a lot more jokes. Falling off the stairs could have been funny but it's played very seriously. The story is just too filled with clichés for me to take seriously. It feels very superficial and not gritty enough. In the end, I enjoyed Wahlberg's commitment to his character."
The Martian,8,5,7,4 June 2016," fun thrilling space adventure
","The Ares III manned mission encounters a sand storm on Mars. Astronaut Mark Watney (Matt Damon) is left for dead as the rest of the crew evacuate on their spacecraft. Mission control back on Earth is shocked when they discover that Mark is actually alive and alone on Mars.Simply put, this is a fun space adventure. There is a good deal of Apollo 13 and Gravity. Damon is humorous and engaging. Meanwhile, the mission control back on earth is doing interesting things. Nobody is the villain. Jeff Daniels is a capable bureaucratic leader. Chiwetel Ejiofor gives the team intensity and has fun scenes with Mackenzie Davis. Almost every side character adds to the group. As for the spacecraft, it's interesting to have Jessica Chastain as the commander. The entire cast is great. The whole story is thrilling. There are unexpected turns. It has the feel of reality. A lot of praise has to be given to director Ridley Scott for a well constructed film. Also it's genius to give it a disco soundtrack."

","A documentary crew is following Dicky Eklund (Christian Bale) and his half-brother Micky Ward (Mark Wahlberg). Dicky is a crack-addicted shadow of himself still living off of his fight with Sugar Ray Leonard. Micky is a punching bag for better fighters on their way up. He's trained by Dicky and managed by their mother Alice Ward (Melissa Leo). Micky is taken by bartender Charlene Fleming (Amy Adams). When Micky's opponent drops out, he's paired with a fighter with 20 lbs on him. Micky is resistant but Alice and Dicky pushes him into the fight.Christian Bale delivers an incredible performance that is matched by the great Melissa Leo. Both deservedly win their Oscars. The family dysfunction is crazy compelling. Amy Adams is also great. Wahlberg is a bit stiff but that's probably due to the amazing acting happening all around him. The movie is surprisingly funny. When the girls rush over to Charlene's house, girl fight and hilarity ensues. The only limiting thing are the boxing sequences. They're not the best but that's not the focus of the movie."
Evil Dead II,7,2,5,28 August 2015," fun B-movie splatter horror

He plays professor Knowby's recitation of the Necronomicon Ex-Mortis (Book of the Dead). Linda is possessed and Ash has to decapitate her. He finds the bridge taken out. Linda's head and body, which he buried, comes back to attack him. Ash has to cut Linda up with a chainsaw. His hand turns bad after Linda's bite. Meanwhile, Knowby's daughter Annie and others try to bring the Necronomicon to the cabin.Sam Raimi has a bit more money and he continues his Evil Dead story. It's as bloody as ever. There is some fun with the blood splattering B-movie. Bring some protection. There are some funny bits especially with the hand. The other actors are limited. It would have been interesting to see an one-man play with Bruce Campbell from start to finish."
Law Abiding Citizen,6,0,1,27 July 2014," Plot way too ridiculous after some contemplation
","Clyde Shelton (Gerard Butler) lost his family to two killers. The guys are caught but the case goes south. D.A., Nick Rice (Jamie Foxx) is a wheeler dealer who has a 96% success rate. When some evidences get thrown out, Rice decides to do a deal with one perpetrator to convict the other. Years later, the execution is tampered with and goes terribly wrong. The other killer with the deal is also brutally murdered. Rice suspects Shelton but he only has circumstantial evidences. Shelton wants to show the justice system as being too lenient and he's willing to kill everybody in the system to prove it.There is a problem of where the rooting interest for the audience should lie. Also there is the insane convoluted plot. Obviously one should never root for the crazy guy but why would a selfish lawyer be a compelling protagonist. Butler needs to play his character descending into outlandish crazy lunacy. Then there are all the crazy ways that he kills. It seemed cool and clever on my first viewing. However it doesn't work with more than one viewing. It becomes ridiculous with more contemplation. It's stupider and stupider. It wants to say something profound but ends up making an idiotic action thriller."
High Fidelity,8,2,2,15 November 2015," humorous
","Rob Gordon (John Cusack) is broken up after his girlfriend Laura (Iben Hjejle) leaves him. He's in his 30s and owns a specialty record store in a bad neighborhood. Dick (Todd Louiso) and Barry (Jack Black) are his weird snobbish employees. Rob recalls the list of his great loves lost. He has to grow up if he's to get Laura back.Along with their encyclopedic knowledge of music, these are some crazy characters. Director Stephen Frears is able to infuse them with likability. It's slyly humorous. Jack Black almost steals the movie with Todd Louiso as his perfect foil. Iben Hjejle has a maturity with a hint of a wild youth. It's also imminently rewatchable."

",Ryan Bingham (George Clooney) is a professional hatchet man who fires people as a job. He is an expert flyer who gives lectures about how to pack for travel. He's good at his job and his most joyful goal is to attain ten million frequent flyer miles. He meets his perfect flying partner Alex Goran (Vera Farmiga) at an airport bar. He deliberately avoids a personal life and his spartan apartment. His sister wants him to photograph a cutout of his niece and her fiancée at different places for their upcoming wedding. Natalie Keener (Anna Kendrick) is a new hire with a new way to fire people by telecommunication. Bingham is dismayed at the proposal. His boss Craig Gregory (Jason Bateman) forces him to show Keener the ropes.Clooney and Farmiga have a fun cerebral chemistry. They flirt well together. It's too bad that they can't be on screen more often. Kendrick is great at playing the uptight cute girl. She has a good fun mentor relationship with Clooney. It has some funny moments. The best is when the three leads finally get together. Kendrick in that scene is hilarious. Jason Reitman deftly handles these three characters beautifully. I'm not as enamored with the wedding section. It comes after Kendrick having such great scenes and then she's gone. Farmiga is back but the wedding takes too much attention away from her. The movie reaches a high point with the three leads coming together. I think the movie should have kept up that pace and the wedding took some of the steam out.
From Here to Eternity,6,2,3,13 December 2014," melodramatic epic
",It's 1941 Hawaii. Robert E. Lee Prewitt (Montgomery Clift) transfers to Schofield Barracks from a bugler company dropping down to Private. Private Angelo Maggio (Frank Sinatra) is his only friend. Captain Holmes (Philip Ober) wants Prewitt to box for him but he refuses after injuring his best friend. Sergeant Milton Warden (Burt Lancaster) is the real backbone of the company who tells Prewitt to smarten up. The whole company under Holmes is pressuring Prewitt to fight. Warden starts an affair with Captain Holmes' wife Karen (Deborah Kerr). Prewitt meets hostess Lorene (Donna Reed) at the New Congress Club.It's a big romance melodrama epic. My biggest problem is that there are too many leads. Montgomery Clift is the supposed lead but he gets overtaken by Burt Lancaster. There is a little too much going on in this movie and feels overcrowded. Lancaster is terrific. Clift is a bit too pensive. He could do better with a more damaged suffering personality. I just think the various story lines keep stepping on each other.
Atonement,8,0,0,6 February 2016," beautiful
","It's 1935 England. Briony Tallis (Saoirse Ronan) is an imaginative writer who witnesses her sister Cecilia (Keira Knightley) and servant's son Robbie Turner (James McAvoy). Robbie is thinking about going to medical school with her father's help. Briony has a crush on Robbie. When cousin Lola Quincey gets raped, Briony's false accusation sends Robbie to prison. Four years later, Robbie is in France retreating towards Dunkirk. He has been released from prison to join the Army. Cecilia cannot forgive Briony (Romola Garai) who has abandoned Cambridge to do something useful as a nurse. Briony is haunted by her mistake as she writes her story.This is beautifully shot and acted. It's worthwhile for multiple viewings. There are epic scenes like Dunkirk and memorably constructed ones like the fountain. It can be slow at times but it's never tired. The biggest change I would add is the important rape scene. I think it's important to show the man's identity to the audience. Here's the thing. It's not a needed mystery except for Briony. It's obviously not Robbie but it would be more intense to know for sure."
V for Vendetta,5,1,2,14 September 2013," unreal Orwellian world
","In the near future of an alternate Great Britain, freedom fighter V (Hugo Weaving) uses terrorist tactics to fight the oppressive society. He rescues Evey (Natalie Portman) from the creepy policemen.The general state of affairs is too confused early on. Other than the crazed ramblings of a madman, there isn't much explaining. It's all generalities and high minded language. It would help to set aside a small segment to explain this universe a little better at the beginning. They really should have either concentration camps, unending wars, book burnings, or goose stepping. Instead the setting feels like today's world slightly shifted. It's not enough. The thing with George Orwell. He created completely new worlds. There's so much they could have done.V's voice is distracting. Speaking thru the mask is problematic. It leaves conversation with him cold and distant. It would be better to cut those scenes down. The pacing gets very slow in the middle. The police is chasing him down, but there's never a close call. It grinds down as they slowly reveal the history. It's way too slow, way too late. They should have done this earlier, in a shorter prelude section. This is what the 1st act is for. And if this is such a police state with control of the media, how the heck did that program get on the air in the first place? If Evey's torture is all V's doing, how much of the stories we're shown can be believed? Or are they created to convert Evey?"
The Island,6,0,2,25 May 2014," Derivative sci-fi turns into fine bombastic action
","It's 2019 and the world is contaminated. Lincoln 6 Echo (Ewan McGregor) lives in a golden cage, a futuristic facility where his every need is tended for. He is closely monitored and hopes to be chosen for The Island, the last pathogen free zone. He's been having disturbing nightmares and he keeps questioning his world. Everybody is childlike. The supervisors are hiding something from them. His friend Jordan 2 Delta (Scarlett Johansson) gets picked by the lottery. While exploring, he discovers that the facility is actually a farce. Lincoln witnesses a former lottery winner escaping from a botched surgery to remove his organs. He and his kind are clones. They are being used for spare parts. He escapes with Jordan followed by the corporate henchmen led by mercenary Albert Laurent (Djimon Hounsou).Before the reveal, this is actually quite boring. The oddities make me scratch my head mostly. It's not interesting enough for me to ponder. I also find all the brand names very annoying. Why the clones need brand names is beyond me. And why is there a holographic projection? Those are just two of the many questionable things. The movie also feels derivative of other better sci-fi. There are a lot of flashy bits and pieces to distract the audience. Once it switches after the escape, director Michael Bay uses all his expertise to make an above average action adventure movie. That's one thing he's great at. The man knows how to do action. The car chase with the railroad axles come off great. It almost makes me forget all the questions I have."

They travel the roads to get to Everett's buried bank loot. A whole lot of fanciful adventures including creek side sirens, the KKK, chased by Sheriff Cooley, and an epic flood.Through it all, they sing some good songs. There is a lot of great fun old time music. Music is such an integral part of this movie, and it fits the style of the movie. This is a beautiful piece of art. A fast-talking fantasy. A sumptuous visual love letter."
Talladega Nights: The Ballad of Ricky Bobby,6,0,0,13 May 2014," Crazy outrageous insane characters

He grows up to be the best NASCAR driver around who either wins or crashes. He marries hot groupie Carley (Leslie Bibb). His best friend is Cal Naughton Jr. (John C. Reilly) who always helps Ricky but never gets any help in return. Their boss Larry Dennit Jr. (Greg Germann) inherited the team and hates Ricky. He hires new super gay French driver Jean Girard (Sacha Baron Cohen) from Formula 1 and he's really good. After a crash, he has a mental breakdown while Jean has taken over. Meanwhile he can't seem to get his speed back.Everybody is a wild and crazy character. It needs a straight man for the team. It's completely insane. It's funny at first but the craziness does get tiresome. Without a straight man, this doesn't take a break or allow the audience to see the jokes reacted to. Even Ron Burgundy has Veronica Corningstone. There are some truly hilarious laughs like Ricky stabbing himself in the leg. I smiled for much of the movie. I just didn't have enough big gut busting laughs."
Semi-Pro,7,0,2,28 February 2015," love the stupidity of Ferrell
","It's 1976. Jackie Moon (Will Ferrell) is a bombastic incompetent owner and player of the Flint Tropics, a last place ABA team. Clarence Withers (AndrÃ© Benjamin) is their best player who hogs the ball. The NBA is merging with ABA taking only 4 teams. Moon proposes the 4 teams should have the best records. He trades away the team's washing machine for aging point guard Ed Monix (Woody Harrelson). He's looking to get back with his old girlfriend Lynn. The team also needs 2000 fans every home game to qualify for the merger.The reason I like this movie is that I like these characters and Ferrell is a hilarious idiot. He's ridiculous and stupid. That's why it's funny. His stupidity keeps rolling and he gets a few really big laughs. One has to be willing to enjoy the idiocy. It's not quite all the way to being a spoof which probably cause some confusion to some. I think it's interesting to have a mix so that Ferrell's comedy doesn't wear out."
Furious 7,7,0,27,12 February 2016," bigger and crazier
","Owen Shaw is in the hospital and his dark-ops brother Deckard Shaw (Jason Statham) wants revenge. He attacks Luke Hobbs (Dwayne Johnson) and Elena Neves at their DSS offices in L.A. He steals the info on the family and kills Han in Tokyo. He sends a bomb to Dominic Toretto (Vin Diesel). Dom, minivan driving Brian O'Conner (Paul Walker) and family barely escape. Letty Ortiz (Michelle Rodriguez) is still struggling to remember. A mysterious dark-ops agent Mr. Nobody (Kurt Russell) recruits Dom and the family to rescue hacker Ramsey (Nathalie Emmanuel) and her God's Eye program which can track down anybody with access to every device. She has been kidnapped by terrorist Mose Jakande (Djimon Hounsou).This franchise has basically morphed into a superhero movie. It is still able to maintain the family which is its strength. The action is bigger and crazier than ever. Jumping from one building to another is not enough. They have to jump one more building and that's what is so fun about this movie. It doesn't care about realism. The movie revels in going over the top. There is an exuberance when the car does another jump when nobody expects it. This movie also has to deal with Paul Walker's death. Director James Wan does it in a classy way with the montage. It actually raises the tension in the bus chase when one is never certain that Paul Walker's character wouldn't be killed right there and then. The fights, the stunts, and the CGI destruction are all top rate. The biggest problem is some of the dialog early on. Some of the exchanges and performances are too overwrought and stale. It reminds me of bad soap opera acting. It starts the movie on the wrong foot but thankfully it stops after the first act. The acting is mostly good with a few exceptions. Tyrese Gibson and Ludicrous have great fun chemistry and I wouldn't mind Nathalie Emmanuel joining the family in the future."
The Godfather,10,7,12,28 November 2013," Truly the Godfather of movies
","Don Vito Corleone (Marlon Brando) is the head of a Mafia family. Sonny (James Caan) is his eldest and heir apparent. Michael (Al Pacino) is a return WWII hero and wants to keep out of the family business. The Don refuses to go into the drug business which precipitate a mob war.There is no doubt that this is one of the greatest movie of all times. Director Francis Ford Coppola has crafted a masterpiece from Mario Puzo's novel. It is not just a great story, but great characters and great actors playing them. Forty years later, it's still as compelling as ever. The pacing is slower than today's standard, but it packs a punch more potent than anything recent. The acting power alone is incredible. When you consider that Al Pacino is the new unknown kid, the cast is unquestionable the best that Hollywood has to offer in that era. Every 10 minutes, there is an iconic scene. There is no way I can list them all.I rarely give a 10. Rarer still do I give it with no reservation. A perfect movie is not enough. It has to have cultural significance and some originality. That is 'The Godfather'. It is still being referenced today. May all the haters sleep with the fishes."
