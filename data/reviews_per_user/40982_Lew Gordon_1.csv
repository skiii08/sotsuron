"The Adventures of Priscilla, Queen of the Desert"," Loved it!
","What a great movie. Not being a fan of {British} humor, I truly enjoyed this movie greatly. It was funny, witty and sometimes a bit stupid and boring. I enjoyed the costumes and the finale.....my favorite part. I would definetly see it again, as I have about 5 times.",8,1,3,3 May 2002
