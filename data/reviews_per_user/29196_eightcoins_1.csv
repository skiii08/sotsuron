The Blair Witch Project," Pretty Boring
","Warning:Contains Major SpoilersWell,this is a Film,about Teenagers/College Students that get lost in the Woods and then get 'killed',its not a low budget Evil Dead Rip Off,as much as you might want to see that kind of Film(It would be far more interesting).And the concept of the Villain being unseen also could make for a great Film.So,first the Pros,for a Found Footage film a lot of Effort went into the Recording,the Actors got set out in the Woods for two weeks.(Its way more impressive than 'skyping' on your Computer for one day,don't you think?Im looking at you,'Unknown User/Unfriended')Now the biggest Problem with the Film is,that the main Focus is on the Actors,and they aren't 'Underactors' if you know what I mean. The second biggest is,that barely anything interesting happens most time The Group just walks through the Forest for most of the Film,thats all.After what felt like more than half of the film somethings do happen,but they aren't that interesting either. -The Group finds a dead Bird -The Group is unable to follow a River -Some people from the Group disappear -They enter a House and get scared by the WallNow for the Ending,it wasn't horrendous,but i wouldn't call It a great Scene eitherIt would have been much a better as between 15 and 20 Minute Length short Film,some Scenes were way too irrelevant,maybe some 'fanmade' Cuts can solve this problemStory:1/10 Actors:1/10 Concept:5/10 Visuals:3/10 Story:1/10",3,2,4,4 May 2016
