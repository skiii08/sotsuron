The Ring," People?
","OK, I could go on, and on, and on, about what I liked, what I didn't, what this movie means, but it had apparently been done to death about a trillion times. Suffice to say it was atmospheric with a few plot holes. Whatever. Just one thing that p***es me off: a lot of reviews say, 'I don't know why everyone says it's good/scary/original/cool/whatever, because it's not, and they're wrong'. Keep in mind it's JUST AN OPINION. You have the right to disagree, but don't say that your opinions are fact and concrete. Say, 'I didn't like it', not, 'It wasn't scary, I don't get it', because it makes you look stupid, anyway. There. Done.",Null,0,1,5 April 2003
Unbreakable," Underrated, as well. (Spoilers)
","Although perhaps not so much, seeing the positivity of the reviews here. I was actually, surprised, however, how many reviewers disliked the Sixth Sense. Anyway, off subject. Specifically, most reasonable complaints center around the ending plot twist. I thought that that was better then the one at the end of the Sixth Sense, because, while in TSS the evidence is laid out before you, in Unbreakable, you have to search for it, but it is there. 1. The Mr. Glass name. Obviouslly very supervillainish. 2. The way we meet Elijah - him snapping at a customer, very unreasonably, the seeds of lunacy. 3. His dress - his outraegous outfits counter everything else in the movie, and the glass cane and high tech wheelchair emphasize this. Also, if you watch carefully, all the characters who spark David's 'sense' are wearing interesting clothing, compared to the clothes of everyone else. Just like Elijah. 4. The name - Elijah Price. David Dunn was picked as the name because of it's sharp, edgy feel, like Clark Kent, or Peter Parker. Physical Name > Physical Character, like David, who is physically unbreakable. On the other hand, Elijah Price is a smooth, flowing, and unique name, often associated with more thinking characters, E.g., Xavier (Professor X), Victor (Dr. Doom), or Alastair Smythe (The Spider Slayer). All these characters rarely fight physically, but use their minds to combat good or evil, respectively. 5. The villain vacuum. Throughout the movie, there is no well-defined villain, which is always needed when there is a well-defined hero, like David. So who is it? 6. The lair. Limited Edition has a smooth, modern, sleek, technological look, much like a villain's HQ. 7. The Curve. Elijah is constantly telling David that they are on the same curve, just opposite ends. If David is on the superhero end, where does that leave Elijah? 8. Lack of contact. If you notice, throughout the whole movie, David never touched Elijah (as far as I can tell; does anyone see where he does?). This could be a clue. 9. When Elijah failes to acheive his goal, he becomes seethingly mad and commits random, angry acts of destruction, as in the comic store. Very villainesque. 10. His unusual upbrining. All supervillains have an interesting story behind them, usually some sort of trauma, or interesting story. Elijah's own story is also very, very interesting, and it also gives him a very interesting motivation, much like David.Whew. That was long, and I'm not going back and checking it. All I can say is, I can't wait for the sequel. Perhaps an unlikely escape by a certain criminal insane prisoner is in order? Only Time, God, or M. Night Shyamalan will tell.",Null,0,0,14 August 2002
Star Wars: Episode II - Attack of the Clones," Solid Sequel Proves Episode One Wasn't Good, But Necessary
","It seems nowadays that nobody who even considers themselves even the smallest of Star Wars fans can resist bashing Episode One. Lucas has lost his touch, too much talking, no action, Jar Jar is a pain. Well, Episode II has proved all naysayers wrong (mostly).Attack of the Clones, despite the ironic name, has everything that made the original three great - spectacular action, FX way ahead of it's time, a grand, sweeping epic story, and even a memorable line or two at the end.In fact, the only truly bad thing I could think about Ep. II is, unfortunately, that George Lucas took the pen into his own hands. As most Star Wars fans know, The Empire Strikes Back was easily the best of the three, primarily because the writing and directing were done by someone other than Lucas, who, despite his grand vision, does not have a way with words. But if you can wedge between the forced dialogue (especially in the love scenes) and a few instances of bad timing, Episode II shines in every way.But, not to upset anyone, but, if you didn't see Episode I, don't bother going to Episode II. Episode I wasn't all that good on it's own, no, but without it, nothing makes a bit of sense. It was the equivalent of the text that comes before the movie - it's just exposition.It feels as if George Lucas isn't trying to create a stand-alone trilogy with these prequels - I got more of the feeling that each movie is just part of a building process, that it is simply a three movie introduction to the original trilogy; watched alone, they are only so-so, but watched as the predecessor to the original trilogy, they are perfect. Maybe, once Ep. III is out, we can see.But, no matter which way you look at it, Episode II is sheer brilliance, and if you consider yourself a true Star Wars fan, you may even find yourself near tears at the end.
