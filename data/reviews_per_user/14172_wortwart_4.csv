The Ring," A classical horror movie
","I was sceptical at the begin because I was afraid of some teenage-girl-slaughtering (you know, 'Scream' etc pp), and the first scenes seemed to direct into that way - although it kept the suspense by the haunting atmosphere of the clean, lonely house ('Shining'?). What followed created more and more shivers: the gloomy pictures in foggy, rainy landscape and the well-wrought plot giving you no clue where it all ends did not fail to make this quite a frightener. The video itself is a fine, morbid piece of art, the clues in it are so hidden that one does not think that there is actually a story hidden in it. And the end was a really cynical surprise. This is a modern version of the classical subtle haunted-castle horror. Stay away if your nerves are thin - or if you lack sensitivity and only go for splatter blood-baths. (9/10)",9,1,1,10 June 2003
Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban," Too much, too fast
","Harry Potter goes to Hollywood ... this movie is a two-hour-rush full of 'special' effects. Large parts of it have the tempo of advertising or music videos. Alas, Harry Potter III lacks the charm of the books, it lacks the wonderful atmosphere of Old England so beautifully captured in the first two movies -- it lacks everything that made the previous films of the series something special, lovely. I would not recommend this movie to a 12- or 13-year-old, not only because of the many horror scenes (don't know what they watch on children TV today, but I think this is way too much for a child) but also because I wonder how many of the young watchers who are so keen on Harry Potter get the story right (if they didn't read the book which should not be a prerequisite for watching the film) -- e.g. the side-story of Harry not being allowed to go to the village and getting the map as a help.My conclusion: the director was not interested in the story, not in the characters, not in the atmosphere. All he tried is to make you shed as much adrenaline as possible. I hope they will make a more old-fashioned movie next time. It would suit Harry Potter much better.3/10",3,4,7,20 December 2004
Kill Bill: Vol. 1," For pseudo-cineasts and manga-lovers only (1/10)
","This is supposed to be one of the 100 best films ever (as presently in the IMDB poll)? I don't understand this - actually, I did not expect to ever watch such an awful movie in my life. So, why is it so bad? Because it leaves you completely cold. The story (if you want to call it story) is ridiculous. Yes, there are some surprises, beautifully arranged scenes and laughs, some original moments too. Tarantino obviously was in command of many tricks and means and links to other movies (as you expect), but to what end? I guess that any film is bad that does not show real characters. I guess 'Kill Bill' is utterly inhuman - not due to its excessive violence (which is annoying nevertheless), but because it's not about human beings.
Surely, Tarantino had lots of fun when making this movie. Watch it if you like stupid mangas.",1,15,27,30 October 2003
Mystic River," Rather Mythic than Mystic
","Although there are strong and interesting women in this film, this is a truly male movie, full of rough buddies and small jokes, drinks and stories. Things that count are left unsaid - they are told by the (thoroughly great) actors and a close, intimate camera. Yes, this is a western, just as 'Unforgiven' was. All the figures are bigger-than-life, telling the myth of strong winners and born losers, of cruelty and the way life ignores our sense of justice. Very moving. 9/10",9,1,1,8 January 2004
