Sucker Punch," Hmmm, why PG-13
","This movie should be rated R. Don't take your teen.Very warped. I worry about the type of people who enjoy this film. If you are warped and like the idea of abusing females, you'll like this movie. If that's a turn on, you'll love it. For everyone else, there are far better examples of this sort of cinema available. The themes of going with the main character(s) reality, and then getting glimpses that they may not be in reality, but that character's hallucinations is a popular addition to many plots now. Most people think the Matrix is what launched this wave of popularity. That movie was done with class though, this movie is just plain warped and tasteless. Again, I really think the appeal would be for the abused, mentally tortured, and sexually abused females. I personally think that's warped, but obviously that's popular in cinema and our culture. If that's not your thing, you most likely won't get much else out of this movie. It seems pretty clear that the producers of this film are people who that is their turn on, and they wanted to waste everyone else's movie going experience to cater to those who share their sick fantasies. If you're mentally healthy, skip it! It could make you ill. As several of the other reviews said, 'haunting' 'images that stay with you' This is not the type of stuff you want to dream of, and yes, it may stain your subconscious.",1,10,20,30 March 2011
Tangled," So mediocre... did I miss something?
","Of course anything with the Disney label gets a certain rush at the box office openings. That said, I really do not understand how this film did so well. Really?It was so mediocre at best. The plot was boring over all. There were somethings that either didn't make sense, or where unnecessary to the plot. The princess is weak and totally out of it. Do the girls of this generation need another princess who's dingy, and lacks visible depth? Her character isn't believable, and is only able to be consistent, because she lacks character, so is able to maintain the lack of. Her hero is a tad more mentally present, but doesn't exhibit much of what we'd want in a hero. He kind of gives a, 'I'm already in this story, so might as well play the hero,' vibe. What was lacking was heroic efforts, or something major to be overcome, etc. Again, no depth. The villain was poorly crafted. The villain, and the villain's motivations were slightly creepy, but not enough to be engaging or interesting. Mainly, I left feeling the villain's role was just plain weird. As I said, this movie was so mediocre, lacked depth, lacked humor, lacked suspense, and there was nothing to latch on to, to relate to, to hope for. What did other viewers enjoy? The day my family saw it in the theaters, it was really quiet, no laughing, no squirming, nothing. Several dads were asleep, and the rest of the audience wore no expressions on their faces. The one surprise in this movie, to me made absolutely no sense at all. I didn't feel like it added to the plot, nor made the film more interesting. It seemed out of place and ridiculous. It also seemed like the main character just forgot about some things that would be important to remember, like the surprise I mentioned. 'Oh, that's right, I'm an airhead, I have a surprise, but forgot, oh, now I remember, (poof) magic...' STUPID!!! I love animated movies, I love children's movies, I love many Disney movies. This was one where if at any point it had been turned off, I wouldn't have cared much to see the rest. This title stayed in the theaters for soooooo long, and is so well rated on here, I might try to watch it again. Obviously, I missed something that other people were able to see. I'm glad others were able to enjoy this film. I'm a little worried as well, if Disney gets the message that this level of story writing creates a winner, than we'll all get more of this sort of thing. Ugh! I hope not. After this and Brave, I'm ready for something more like Aladdin or Mulan... something awesome!!!",4,9,34,16 July 2013
