Conquest 1453," Terrible, terrible movie
","This is, in all aspects, a terrible production. It lacks acting, it lacks realism -it doesn't reflect the true nature of war, either a war from the 15th century or earlier- it lacks simple directing 101, it even lacks basic war scene techniques...It certainly doesn't lack anachronism or a nationalist propaganda in a very retrospective way though. Since a very few directors who have been able to redeem themselves from the chauvinist nature of the art about Turkey's political and social history, do not show any interest of adapting the country's, -Ottoman era in particular- history into a movie; we're dealing with the likes of Faruk Aksoy whose only contribution to the Turkish cinema is shooting some cheap comedy series called Recep Ivedik and suchlike.And for our pathetic youth generation whose desperation for their nationalist masturbation to get recognized by the foreign audience and be applauded somehow never seem to come to an end anytime soon; this movie, or a piece of garbage as how you like to call it, is a national treasure. The overall rating of 8.1 from a roughly 35 thousand people proves that, if you like to make money through cinema in Turkey, you just need to have a nationalistic point of view in which you crave for the 'mighty' days of Turks to come back and be terrible at directing. The rest will follow and your movie will be a hit on IMDb thanks to Turkish internet solidarity!Shameful, really. Fetih 1453 consists of Faruk Aksoy's hopeless attempt to bring the Fall of Constantinople -or the Conquest of Istanbul, as Turks call it- into screen and his, inevitable failure. The topic should indeed needs to be put into screen, but not by an incompetent director.Final piece of advice for the people from all around the world except Turkey: If you have a soft spot for eastern culture and want to explore Turkish or Arabic history; have a second thought before watching any product on screen who are made by the people of the related country itself. Go for a reading instead.",1,5,11,22 October 2012
