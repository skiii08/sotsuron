Catch Me If You Can," simply one of the best, most fun movies of the year
","What could have been a great film is merely a good one, by way of forsaking the gritty details for directorial sleight of hand.",10,1,2,3 January 2019
Casablanca," Every kid should see this Bogart classic.
",Even hardened cynics who might be impelled to dismiss it as a collection of button-pushing clich√©s will most likely get swept up in the all the unabashed romance.,9,2,3,21 February 2019
Train to Busan," The very definition of a mondo midnight movie!
","Part horror and part satire, this is an exceptional movie that drags you screaming along at bullet-train speed. Extraordinary tension is counterbalanced with eerie calm, as survivors embark and disembark in quiet fear.",8,0,2,24 April 2019
Zootopia," This is a new Disney classic.
","The political landscape from which this film was born is apparent almost from the start, and though at times less than subtle with its agenda, it still manages to be an incredibly witty, emotional and entertaining movie experience.",7,1,1,20 February 2019
The Others," Masterpiece!
","Nicole Kidman's brilliant turn dominates this sumptuously made supernatural thriller, which sustains creepy tension without relying on gory violence or special effects.",10,2,2,12 January 2019
L.A. Confidential," A sublimely complex story.
","The genius of the film -- and it is a film of genius, without a doubt -- is that it holds an investigation into the human soul's capacity for evil, while somehow still managing to be funny, thrilling, lively, shocking and unremittingly entertaining.",10,3,4,13 January 2019
Lion," 'Lion' features great performances and tells an essential story.
","An emotional, skillfully-made film about the need to love and accept people just as they are.",10,0,0,1 January 2019
Forrest Gump," Exquisitely made, expertly crafted... and a work of purest, blackest evil.
","Forrest Gump is a perfectly competent movie. Its major failure is one of morals and ideas, and the fact that so many, many people did not seem to notice or care, is what really flummoxed me.",5,1,6,14 January 2019
The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring," An epic movie of a once-in-a-lifetime sort.
","Director Peter Jackson has not only attempted the most ambitious film project in modern cinema history, he's pulled it off with a breathtaking mixture of nerve and verve, too.",8,1,1,20 February 2019
Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse," A great story from top to bottom.
","The climax is perhaps one of the year's most sensational sequences, taking Into the Spider-Verse into another astral plane of superhero filmmaking.",8,0,1,8 July 2019
Dallas Buyers Club," Brilliant would be an understatement.
","A powerfully moving film, and McConaughey's extraordinary physical transformation is much more than a stunt.",8,0,0,5 March 2019
Inside Out," Welcome back, Pixar. You were sorely missed.
","The film is smart, engaging and funny. It has all the standard tug-at-your-heartstring components of a Pixar film, along with a delightful dose of grown-up wit and charm.",6,0,1,26 May 2019
The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey," What could have been a breezy, thrilling stand-alone film is instead a long, sometimes tedious, excursion.
","It would be wrong to ignore the technical achievement that Jackson has pulled off yet again. But when said and done, 'The Hobbit' feels more like a cinematic encyclopedia of Tolkein's mythical world rather than a trip to the movies.",6,0,0,19 April 2019
"Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon"," Ang Lee's crowd-pleasing martial arts actioner is captivating and thrilling from beginning to end.
","The movie is good, sometimes very good, but I suspect it's a masterpiece only for those who haven't seen all the earlier masterpieces that equal or surpass it.",8,2,3,11 April 2019
Gone Girl," It's riveting, shocking and hits every target it aims at.
","David Fincher claims he's always wanted to make a date movie that made three million people get divorces as a result. Believe me, he's made it here - this is a film that revels in its audience's discomfort.",10,1,3,10 February 2019
Room," Room is filled with curiosity that excites and exhausts all of our emotions simultaneously.
","Room shows us a horrible situation from the most innocent of perspectives, and in doing so creates a truly unique film experience.",9,0,1,16 April 2019
The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers," Part two is more a straight-ahead action flick, substituting brawn and brawling for the pastoral radiance of the first film.
","The movie doesn't deepen or expand the tale's themes as masterfully as The Empire Strikes Back added to Star Wars' mystique. But as a stirring story of unsullied heroism, it's a winner, and as an action epic, it features superb battle sequences.",8,0,0,20 February 2019
A Quiet Place," It is a horror movie, and it is also a family drama. More importantly, it is a good movie.
","A Quiet Place is an all-timer, a modern masterpiece that feels, even while you're watching it, like the kind of film that's quickly going to make its way into your regular rotation.",9,0,3,16 October 2019
Prisoners," ...wants to show how one heinous act creates not only victims, but more monsters.
","Whenever you can set aside a few hours for this thing, go and see it. Just be prepared for it: this ain't a movie you can just casually watch.",9,4,5,12 April 2019
Logan," Logan is the film that Wolverine so rightfully deserved.
","This is the Wolverine story fans have wanted to see on screen all along, and the filmmakers are to be commended for taking the character to this difficult but necessary place.",10,0,0,10 February 2019
The Dark Knight," The Dark Knight is a triumph from beginning to end.
","CHRISTOPHER NOLAN gave Batman back his self-respect. After years of comical, camera-hogging villains and rubber outfits sculpted from Ann Summers fetish wear, Batman Begins took the series back to basics. Nolan rediscovered the dark, troubled soul of this vigilante hero.The Dark Knight takes the process a giant leap further, transforming a typical summer blockbuster into a brooding, unsettling reflection on the increasingly blurry boundaries between good and evil.This is a film for our times and is so violent and intense in its execution that you wonder what the censors were thinking about when they only awarded it a 12A certificate. This is definitely not for children.A year has passed since Batman Begins. Gotham City is like a lawless frontier in the Wild West. Organised crime flourishes but billionaire playboy Bruce Wayne (Christian Bale) is warming to the idea that the city may have found a genuine hero in district attorney Harvey Dent (Aaron Eckhart).Dent is a fearless crime fighter who doesn't hide in the shadows or consider himself above the law. He is also deeply in love with Batman's former sweetheart Rachel (Maggie Gyllenhaal). Even loyal lieutenant Gordon (Gary Oldman) believes in the power of Dent to bring about change.Dent has everything going for him and could be the man to make Gotham safe again. Naturally, there is a very big fly in the ointment by the name of The Joker (Heath Ledger), a frightening psychopath who describes himself as an agent of chaos. Ledger plays the lipstick-smeared character to the hilt but without the flamboyant theatricality that Jack Nicholson brought to the part. Ledger's Joker is the embodiment of anarchy, creating a climate of fear and loathing just because he can.Ledger invests him with a chilling conviction. You believe that he is capable of anything. His performance is both a tremendous swan song and a sad reminder of just what a fine actor was lost with his death earlier this year.The Dark Knight is a movie that has the substance to match the style. There are stunning car chases and death-defying acts but they don't exist just to catch the eye and dazzle the senses. This is not the kind of film that fills you up with spectacle then leaves you feeling empty half an hour later.Actions have consequences. People die in violent and horrible ways. There are no comforting certainties or absolute heroes. In a world where nobody respects the rule of law, how can you possible tell who the good guys are any more?The picture's ability to catch you off balance is especially true in its treatment of Batman. Christian Bale seems even leaner and more anguished than ever as he watches Dent steal his legitimacy and his girl. Dent could provide Wayne with the opportunity to abandon his Batman persona for ever but what else could he do?There are times when Batman seems responsible for more carnage and death than any of the villains. He believes the ends justify the means but wouldn't the pursuit of justice also mean that Batman should be behind bars?The film's mantra becomes the line: 'You either die a hero or live long enough to become the villain' and Michael Caine's stalwart Alfred begins to sound more and more like Batman's conscience.A movie that combines nail-biting tension with impossible moral quandaries, The Dark Knight is an intelligent, provocative epic for people who like their blockbusters to have brains as well brawn. It might well be the best Hollywood film of the summer.",10,1,1,13 January 2019
The Dark Knight," One of the most stylish extravaganzas in years.
","The most thematically sophisticated, most philosophically profound, most narratively complex and most viscerally thrilling super-hero movie of all. It transcends the genre.",10,0,0,22 January 2019
Rocky," Sly's best pic winner sets underdog-hero standard.
","Rocky retains its power to enthrall ... a quieter movie than some may remember.... It's worth seeing again, for what it was, before it was betrayed by it's less intelligent, testosterone-soaked progeny.",6,0,0,18 April 2019
A Beautiful Mind," A Beautiful Mind is Howard's best movie
","Director Ron Howard has created a moving masterpiece, elegantly guiding the audience through John Forbes Nash Jr.'s life.",10,0,2,9 December 2018
The Departed," Very violent, but very, very good.
",The shocking violence is well-placed. The action scenes are always comprehensible -- no jump cut cheats here -- and the suspense will make you fidget in your seat. What a corker.,10,0,2,14 January 2019
Whiplash," Electrifying. Dangerous. Masterful.
","It's a riveting, thrilling film that gets away with an ending that's perhaps just a little too keen to cleanly resolve the jagged drama. But if you ever thought Glee or Fame would be better rendered as a one-on-one psycho-thriller, here's your film.",10,0,0,21 February 2019
The Lion King," The best of Disney animation.
","With its remarkable narrative, memorable characters, stunning animation, and brilliant music, The Lion King remains the very pinnacle of Disney's animated achievements.",10,2,2,11 July 2019
The Conjuring," A great antidote to your standard dehumanizing horror movie.
","James Wan has become a master of the modern horror flick; distancing himself from the torture porn trend he began with Saw, focusing instead on using old-school horror tricks to their best advantage. We may have seen these scare set pieces before (e.g. the possessed doll, the dark cellar, the crows flying into the house) and we know how music manipulates us to create jumps, but Wan pulls these off in such a way that the film feels both fresh and terrifying.He's achieved that, in part, by paying homage to the type of horror films he loves from the 1970s. Most of the effects in The Conjuring were created practically on set, rather than through a computer, which makes them feel all the more real. The cinematography by Frank Leonetti is simple and beautiful, and together with Wan, has created some creepy images, which may become iconic and possibly will be lampooned by the Wayans brothers at some point.",9,0,0,13 January 2019
The Dark Knight Rises," Cold, bleak and brutal, it's easily the moviegoing spectacle of the year.
",Every facet of this impressive piece reaffirms the same thematic gristle as it forces the viewer to chew on the notion of personal responsibility.,10,1,1,22 January 2019
The Sixth Sense," One of Hollywood's most accomplished genre films of the last 20 years.
","Dr Crowe gradually comes to believe that little Cole can indeed commune with the unquiet souls, who are reaching out to him for help. And, yes, the scenes where Cole does so can be very creepy indeed.",8,1,1,5 April 2019
The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King," This is a masterpiece of filmmaking and Jackson truly deserves an Oscar.
","In Return of the King, the battle for the very survival of Middle Earth and all its fantastical creations will be fought, and unless you are a congenital buzz-kill, you will feel the urgency, terror, and sweeping import of it all.",9,0,0,20 February 2019
