It," an incredible rebuild of an epic novel
","This movie was single-handedly the best of its gender so far. I'm not gonna compare It with the latest release Annabelle, since the two of them share so little. While Annablle focus is giving us a bunch of scares, building up a dark atmosphere that compensates the lack of neutral dialogues, the movie It perfectly combines scary-creepy elements with comedy ones, and God, how did it blend so well. I read the book a few months ago, but I can recall of everything important, and I believe I saw at least 80% of the first half in the screenplay. It felt just good to point a scene out and shout 'OMG, it's exactly like this on the book!'. when I left the theater I was in awe. The scenes was very well shot, and Bil Skarsgard was amazing as Pennywise. I'm looking forward for part 2.",8,7,16,9 September 2017
Hereditary," Very pleased to see this on the screen
","I left the room feeling very unsettled about what I experienced there. This movie really affected me somehow. I guess because of the rawness of some scenes and all the secrets that you only get a glimpse of. You develop some kind of bond with the characters, and at some point you kinda wonder about the nature of their actions, if it's natural for them to do the things they do. It is a incredible masterpiece, it reminded me of The Witch and, incredibly, Paranormal Activity, but in avery good way. Everything blended together just fine, and at the end it's really fast pacing. One of the best of the genre, and my favorite of this year so far.",10,2,4,23 June 2018
