Requiem for a Dream," Requiem for a Dream A+
","I wish I could give this film a 100/10.... I have watched this film 6 times and remains my favourite ever film.Truly amazing film and as for the audio... its something else. The music is probably the most beautiful group of pieces I've ever heard. Composed by Clint Mansell and Krono, the heart pumping and soul grabbing soundtrack is available on CD and is oh so very worth getting. Buy this film people for the great creativity or even just for the music!!!!! Thumbs up all the way! 10/10 AAA+++ ***** ******** ***** ****** **** ***** ****** ****** ******** ******* **** **** **** ****** **** ******* *** ******* ******** ***** ***** **** ***** **** **** **** ****",10,0,1,8 May 2006
