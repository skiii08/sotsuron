The Ring," a true horror movie
","I don't have much to say except this- once all those Hollywood movies that rely on a CGI creature/monster, tons of blood, gore, and fake, sudden scares are long forgotten, this one will definitely stand out.This is a dramatic, moving, and nonetheless truly frightening psychological thriller.though I was hesitant to see this movie remembering how bad remakes usually turn out, I can't say that for this movie. I enjoyed this movie better than the original (the reason being- its beautiful score and stunning performances from Watts and Dorfman)This is not your traditional horror movie, this is what movies is all about.P.S You'll enjoy it more if you watch it on a VHS system, in the dark, by yourself, on the biggest TV set you can find =]",9,1,1,19 July 2008
WALLÂ·E," A brilliant film, to say the least
","I recently saw this film, and having heard all the mixed feelings about this movie, I went into the movie theater with my mind wide open; well, what can I say? I left the movie theater with a mind full of thoughts and reflections on our society. Wall-e, the newest film from Pixar, not only entertains you with its comical, robotic- romance theme and its very interesting general premise, but it challenges you to think in unexpected ways (i.e, these thoughts have been triggered by an ANIMATED movie, very few animated movies can do this) It is a well-crafted warning for us about the dangers of media, pollution, global warning, etc...The only draw-back-- the ads. and trailers for this film make it seem a lot more entertaining for kids so don't be surprised if your kids get bored (especially towards the beginning of the film) Two thumbs up!",10,1,2,5 July 2008
