Ford v Ferrari," Well done movie!
","I watched this again for the second time on Amazon (first time in theater) and loved it. I'd say there are two scenes in particular that really stood out to me as meaningful and unexpected reactions See if you can figure out what they are, one included fighting and a lawn chair, another included a grown man crying. Highly recommend",10,1,3,11 March 2020
Forrest Gump," A legend, a classic, heartfelt good movie
","Tom Hanks showed us in Forrest Gump what a fantastic actor he is, if anyone had any doubt. But the story, the other characters, and the directing, made this movie overall a heartfelt classic. This is one you can watch again and again and get new things out of it each time. How can you not feel for Gump, who struggles with issue, which really aren't even the issues that others see. We are drawn into him, his mom, his life path, and his desires.",10,1,1,10 December 2019

Jojo Rabbit," Refreshingly different in style and tone
","I enjoyed this movie more than I thought I would. The description doesn't do it justice, there are real gems of dialogue woven throughout that highlight the films underlying meaning. The acting is superb, the directing is brilliant. The coloristic And creative choices are bold And work to make the story unique from any other war film. Keep an open mind, try it, you might enjoy the journey more than you think.",9,0,2,9 May 2020
The Godfather," Best Gangster movie of all time
","The classic gangster movie that all others after it aspire to be like. Yes its long, but engaging throughout. A realistic view into the life of being in the mob family from all perspectives, the boss, the wives, the rest of the family, the cops, and the others on the outside. 'Never hate your enemies' and 'friendship is everything' are my favorites quotes. Inevitably in the mob world back stabbing and double-crossing happens, and outside of the mob world too.",10,1,3,7 December 2019
