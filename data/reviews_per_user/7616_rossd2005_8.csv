Borat: Cultural Learnings of America for Make Benefit Glorious Nation of Kazakhstan," It Doesn't Get Much Better Than This...
","For those of you who are not familiar with Sacha Baron Cohen, he is the Jewish comedian behind the characters Ali G (a white man who thinks he's black, Bruno (A gay fashion expert) and of course Borat. The theme he has with these characters is an interview based environment with unsuspecting subjects that are unaware the interviews are set up. Borat is a journalist from Kazakhstan, a a country that stretches over a vast expanse of northern and central Eurasia. His cultural differences between him the interviewee's are vast making for some interesting conversation. He has a lot of jokes reflecting around the characters misinterpretation's of Hebrews, gays, women and pretty much everything else. This sometimes lets out the interviewers opinion reflecting their 'ignorance' rather then Borat's. What makes the character so special is the amount of integrity Cohen has for this character. Even if someone has complained about it (The Kazakhstani government) he will come out and give a statement in character. He has no shame, he takes it as far as he can and doesn't apologise for anything. It's a fantastic little character.Apologies for rambling, I'm at about 18 lines already without even mentioning the movie that much. This movie is NOT safe for kids. It may be a 15 in the UK but it must have narrowly missed an 18 rating. It has every lewd, crude, sick and disgusting jokes you could ever wish for. Though that is one of the charms of it. You'll be better off sticking your kids into Flushed Away or Open Season. If you are easily offended by ANYTHING, you may want to see Open Season with the kids. There is something in this film to offend most people (not me included by the way). It may not be the best comedy film ever made, or the smartest. It may not have the artistic integrity of The Great Dictator or Clerks, but it is definitely the funniest film I have ever seen. It has a laugh a minute and I have never been part of a louder audience. I was horse afterwards from laughing so much.I recommend this film to everyone. Except maybe kids, pensioners and Jews.",10,3,18,14 November 2006
Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Man's Chest," Not A Pirates Fan But Still...
","Okay, I wasn't looking forward to seeing this film. It was a combination of my hate for Orlando Bloom's acting, the hate I've had for years of the Pirates Of The Caribbean Ride at Disneyland, and how bad the first one was. This film is very slow and it didn't excite me too much. But don't take my word for it because for those of you who enjoyed the first one, this sequel is the kind of sequel that blows you away much further than the first one (a good example includes Batman Returns). The action scenes are pretty impressive, the tribal scene is a little exciting but at this time the film is still nothing special. The thing that brought this film up from a 2/10 to a 5/10 for me is the final 45 minutes, the action scenes are phenomenal leaving me with a feeling like 'Why couldn't the rest of the film be like this' So for those of you who enjoyed the first film, go see it, but for those of you who didn't but do like good action borrow it off a friend when the DVD's released and watch the final 45mins",5,1,3,12 July 2006
Hostel," This is no Pulp Fiction
","Upon first seeing the TV spots for this I expected a fantastic well thought out thriller that I would now expect from Tarantino (Kill Bill aside). Eli Roth did a great job advertising this film and catching the attentions of Saw fans. The movie itself is horrible. It starts with three young men travelling from a drugs filled time in Amsterdam to Bratislava where they plan to get some sex from some of the girls who they have been told are there. If you hadn't seen the opening title sequence you would think this is a remake of Euro Trip. It's even got them travelling by train and a creepy foreigner getting into their spot and touching one of the kids legs. This is exactly the same as what I've seen before. I came to this film looking for something different. The film is mostly build up. It's 70 minutes of sex and confusion followed by 20 minutes of indescribable violence. The film is predictable, it doesn't tell a good story and it has an extremely clichÃ© ending. It defys everything that I thought it would be (the extreme violence aside).But hey! At least it wasn't as bad as House Of The Dead",3,0,0,17 August 2006
Nacho Libre," Leave Your Brain In The Lobby And You Will Thoroughly Enjoy This
","Ignacio (Jack Black) is a semi-Mexican friar who's only dream is to become a luchador wrestler. The problem is it is against his religion. He teams up with local tramp Esqueleto (Héctor Jiménez) and start earning money in the tag team business to raise money for the orphans under the name Nacho, but along the way they find that making their way to the top isn't too easy.Down to the nitty gritty. If you are not a fan of Napoleon Dynamite and the kind of random chuckles that turn into big laughs genre, it might not be something you have to see. Jared Hess (who directed Napoleon Dynamite) uses the same kind of childish humour in the film.Jack Black does his usual song, dance and jump all-over the place routine and once again pulls it off. I'd recommend this film to anyone with a varied sense of humour but if you don't come to this film prepared to see a very comical slapstick comedy then don't come at all.",8,0,1,24 August 2006
Shrek the Third," Another Example Of How Third Times Are Unlucky
","Everything that could've went wrong with this chapter of Shrek, DID. The plot had great potential but fell flat on its face with the same dialogue, poor jokes and Justin Timberlake. Plot: Shrek and Fiona are next in line for the throne of Far Far Away but Shrek doesn't want it so goes to fetch Fiona's cousin Artie (Prince Arthur), whilst at the same time Prince Charming throws a hissy fit, rounds up Disney's bad guys and plans to stand in Shrek's way...again. The fact is the characters aren't lovable anymore. The third film lacks the heart that the first two had. The same thing happened with Ice Age 2. I got about 7 laughs out of a 90 minute film, that's very poor.Justin Timberlake's voice is nauseating in both movies and music. It's strange he had one of the lead roles in the same film the woman he was sleeping with at the time just happened to be starring in. Mike Myre's voice work determines a new character, whilst Timberlake's voice is distracting and irritating. He still sounds like he's 12 years old at age 26.Shrek is okay at best given the action sequences and beautiful animation, but it offers up nothing new. 75% of this film is dry and humourless and loses so much appeal, heart and character that the first two films offered.What would I like to be changed? Sack Justin Timberlake and rewrite the entire film, or just forget about it all together.However the kiddies will enjoy it.",4,1,2,2 July 2007
Tenacious D in the Pick of Destiny," A Must See For Fans Of The D.
","This movie is everything a Tenacious D fans can hope for. Director Liam Lynch partnered with The 'D' is a concoction of epic proportions. Of course you need to understand the humour and format of Tenacious D. When I saw it there wasn't too many laughs from the audience but the reason is not a lack of humour or intelligent jokes. This movie seems to have been released on to an unsuspecting public that haven't familiarised themselves with the musical duo. This movie does stay true to it's roots. For the few of you who have seen the HBO TV series and heard the album, they have not forgotten what their audience loves. Like the TV show people have noticed from the trailer the JB and KG apartment scenes and of course the open Mic nights that each Tenacious D episode would start and finish with. The soundtrack is phenomenal and each song blows you away....And Dave Grohl plays a fantastic Devil.This is the perfect movie for those of you looking for a hard time and a rocking musical.",10,2,3,1 December 2006
Con Air," Nicolas Cage, John Cusak, John Malkovich and Dave Chappelle. What more could we ask for?
","I just finished watching this film for the first time on Sky Movies. Okay this film does sound a little cheesy when you first hear about it but this film is one of the most heart pounding action film ever made. A whole gang of extremely dangerous convicts hijack an aeroplane being used to transport them to another prison. Nicolas Cage plays Cameron Poe, a now ex-convict ready to meet his daughter for the first time in his life but finds himself caught up in this nightmare with wings. I've always thought Cage is a fantastic actor but he hasn't had that many good films to show that. He is fantastic in this film although the redneck accent he puts on is annoying at first. John Malkovich; well there you're only getting better. I am a big fan of him especially in his role as Lennie in Of Mice & Men. He maintains the psychopathic mentality he has in most of his other films as Cyrus 'The Virus' Grissom, the deadliest convict on the flight.I won't tell you anymore because you have to see this film for yourself. So go on... see it, see it, SEE IT!",9,0,1,26 July 2006
Click," You'll Laugh, You'll Cry, You May Even Learn A Lesson Or Two
","As you're like me and you have seen the film you would have been walking into the screen to see this groaning and rolling you're eyes at how bad the movie looked via the trailers. It starts off with the kind of silly jokes you expect in any Adam Sandler movie and I accepted that, but through the movies . The acting isn't fantastic from Christopher Walken, some scenes are slightly cringe-worthy, but this film hops all over. David Hasselhoff makes his appearance as Michael Newman's (Sandler) boss Mr. Ammer. This is a great role for David Hasselhoff because the plain fact is that David Hasselhoff is playing a stereo typical David Hasselhoff character. He has the grin going all the time, he is cocky and of course has the young attractive secretaries sitting on his office desk. This movie has such a huge jump from slapstick comedy into extremely sad tear-jerking drama. And Of course the ending's predictable but it's an Adam Sandler movie. Plus it cheers a weepy audience up. I was relieved by the end, But if you haven't seen this movie go and see it, I hope I haven't given too much away for you",8,0,1,1 November 2006
