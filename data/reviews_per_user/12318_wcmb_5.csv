The Monuments Men," Uneven but a necessary story
","The story is uneven, Cate Blanchett is wonderful, the sets and lighting are beautifully done. Drama/comedies are hard to pull off and this film is proof. If Clooney had gone more comedic or more towards the drama it would have done better. The basic story is true, the Nazis also burned pieces symbolically and used art to finance the war. It is a complicated story for certain.",6,0,0,3 July 2020
Match Point," Why aren't any of the characters likable?
","You've got a tennis pro who has scraped his way up from the bottom. He's aloof, manipulative and a social climber. He's not likable nor easy to relate to. I'm not sure why we're supposed to care about him or what happens to him. There's no chemistry between him and the other characters even the female lead. The performances seem flat, hollow. Not one character stands out and I found this film to be painful to watch. I coudn't see the appeal of this film. If the lead character appeals to you then maybe you'll like this film. If you're a Woody Allen fan, more power to you.",3,4,8,8 July 2006
Dreamgirls," I loved this film!
","Prior to viewing this movie I was only aware that it was loosely based on the story of the Supremes. I refused to read any reviews because I just wanted to enjoy the film. The buzz was that Jennifer Hudson stole the show. Listen folks! She is the show! The story is centered around Effie White and the group. She and Jamie Foxx are the lead characters. I was so impressed by Jennifer Hudson's singing that I walked out of the theater and walked to the nearest CD-selling store and bought the soundtrack! I cannot wait for Hudson's first album! Wow! Oh, Eddie Murphy stands out! We all know that he has a decent singing voice, he really shines in this film! His character is fun and believable and there is one scene where his facial expression speaks volumes! LOVED IT! If you like Motown, R&B you'll love this!",9,2,4,30 December 2006
Mamma Mia!," A musical without singers
",None of the leads are singers and none of them are very good. It's a shame because real singers would have done the songs justice.,5,0,0,18 November 2018
Iron Man," Another Special Effects Film
","Another special effects film which means if you want good dialog, character development and chemistry walk away now. I thought this one was going to be good and was greatly disappointed. The special effects are fine and predictable and like so many superhero films of late the characters are one-dimensional. The fact that Favreau left the dialog up to the leads instead of investing in a good writer is apparent.Surprisingly Robert Downey Jr. is just okay. His Tony Stark is mildly appealing and his scenes in the lab are probably the best in the film, maybe it's because he is talking to inanimate objects and his computer. He has better chemistry with JARVIS (Paul Bettany) than anyone else in the picture.Gwyneth Paltrow brings nothing to her part. She is again the wooden girl, but there isn't much to the part. Anyone could play it and someone else might have been convincing in her scenes with Robert Downey Jr.Terence Howard seems miscast. For a military man his character is soft and has no military bearing. It's too bad because he's a much better actor than he is allowed to be in this film.Jeff Bridges seems to have a lot of fun with his role. He plays it for fun and it shows. He is the only one who seems to be playing his part for what it is. Everyone else is either taking it too seriously or just can't seem to get past their own parts.If you haven't seen this movie save yourself some cash and rent it. You won't feel like you've wasted any money that way.",2,5,11,12 October 2008
