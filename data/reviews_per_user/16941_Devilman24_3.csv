The Incredible Hulk," Finally a true Hulk movie.
","I saw this movie when it came out and i think it was so awesome. I saw the 2003 movie when it came out on opening night and i hated it. When i hear about the new movie i careless until the i saw the trailer which look good. The acting in this movie was very well done and Edward Norton as the Incredible Hulk did a great job. His acting fit very well with the role as Burce Banner. The fight scenes with abomination where awesome and very well done! The CGI in the movie was really good and it not bad as everyone said it was because The CGI in Hulk (2003) was bad due to the skin texture was crap. In the 2003 film, when bullets hit him, his skin ripples and wobbles. But in this new Hulk movie, the skin texture look better and more realistic then the design in the 2003 movie. The story is very simple to flow and the opening credits for the movie shows how Burce became the Hulk, so you don't have to worry about the story being slow.This movie is awesome and it worth checking out.",Null,2,3,19 June 2008
The Love Guru," More like the 'The Hated Guru' then the 'The Love Guru'
","I like Mike Myers and i think he is a pretty funny actor. I remember i saw a trailer for this movie back in March and it look pretty funny. When the movie came out, i did not saw it because of the low reviews from the critics. I saw it today for free and i'm Gald i saw it for free because this movie was just pain awful. The movie had one or two funny jokes and the movie had very little story what so ever. The whole movie feel like a video on Youtube then a movie. The movie is full of pointless fart jokes that are not funny at all. The casting was the only good thing about this movie! I think the trailer for this movie was funnier then the movie it self.Don't waster your time or money on this movie because nothing in this movie is worth checking out. If you want to see a good funny movie that came out at the moment then see Hancock!",Null,3,10,16 July 2008
The Dark Knight," A comic book movie that truly deserves!
","I finally saw the movie when it came out and I really enjoyed it. I had stayed away from all press of the film as to not fall into hype/ disappointment before I had even seen the film. This movie will not disappoint anyone because this is one the best comic book movies to date and Heath Ledger is the perfect joker. Ledger as the Joker was dark, funny and twisted at same time. His version of the Joker is, without a doubt, one of the most terrifying movie villains of all time.The acting in this movie was great as ever and the casting is the same from Batman Begins expect for Kaite Homes did not returns but who cares really because she was bad in Batman Begins. None of the drama is boring and the movie was bit long but it was worth it. It was not long and boring like The Day After Tommorw and King Kong (2005) was. I love the portray the mood of the movie and the movie feels like a movie not a comic book movie like Iron Man or X-Men. I did though the first ten minutes where bit dull but it gets better later on in the movie. I was bit disappointed with the ending but i'm not going to spoil the ending though.Overall the movie is worth the wait and if you have not seen it then you are missing out because this movie is one the best movies of 2008! 9/10",Null,1,3,24 July 2008
