The Avengers," Exactly what you expected probably.
","In order to understand the situation of my review I'll clear some things up. I saw this on a regular movie screen, no 3D and no IMAX so maybe I wasn't fully engrossed in this film due to the medium I chose to view it in, but lets cut the crap, if a movie needs images popping at your face every other 30 seconds and IMAX sized screens to be 'TOTALLY AWESOME, BRUH.' it was never that solid to begin with. That being said lets analyze the film shall we? So here is the main problems with The Avengers as a whole, it relies too much action with too little meaning. What did I expect though, right? Well I expected something a little less cookie cutter than this.If Transformers is a bad movie (which it is and far worse than this.) for lacking fan service of its original audience to connect to, The Avengers is stunningly mediocre for the exact opposite reason. God bless the man or woman that enters the theater with no prior knowledge of every superhero movie released in the last 7 years, because all this film contains is fan service upon fan service. There is nothing organic about this film and it shows in spades. Everything and everyone is merely glazed over waiting for there 12 minutes of solo screen time no risks are taking and there is so much Star Wars prequels-equse action going on that it kills any tension you might have the film almost runs 150 minutes 100 of which are unnecessary fights between the bad guys and good guys or the good guys and the other good guys not gelling as a team its just an obvious film.The avengers isn't irredeemable though it has some solid performances particularly Colby Slomders of How I met Your Mother fame proves she can probably take a stab at being an action heroine on her own project and Mark Ruffalo's take on The Hulk impressed me. The action sequences while over abundant are masterfully crafted and the comedy is surprisingly what works the best in this film with several witty one liners strewn through out the film.At the end of the day I think the film was too much Bang and not enough buck. As I was leaving a gentlemen was talking to his wife and said 'I thought there would be a lot less talking.' my inner monologue rebutted 'Wanna just watch stock footage of things getting blown up and punched?' but this is what it is. If you are a fan of superhero movies you'll probably love this. If you are fan of things that blow up and implode you'll probably love this too. Fans of focused films with a little more story and character development, maybe a risk or two being taken will probably feel the same way I do about it.My one sentence summary of The Avengers, '2 and half hours of non-specific escapism.' I that sounds like something you like which there is no shame in then I recommend it. If not id pass or wait for a rental.5/10",5,9,24,7 May 2012
Zodiac," You know whats also slow and unappealing? Taking a dump.
","There is a lot wrong with zodiac but most of it can be summed up in one word, SLOW, now I im not some guy that needs a non stop action thriller fast paced bombardment of action, in fact im quite the opposite, but this is unacceptable the tension of the movie is already compromised by knowing the outcome before the movie starts at least as far as the serial killer plot goes, obviously he is never caught. In the meantime its just a play by play of what was happening that anyone watching the news in the 70's could have seen, mixed with a ho hum story based on the paranoia of a local reporter. I mean the acting is solid for it is which saves it from being a complete abortion, but aside from that its just a slow paced snore fest that makes The Human Condition trilogy look like it has a Transformers like pace in comparison, and thats like 9 and half hours long.",3,0,4,13 April 2010
Trouble with the Curve," Clint is old and mad about being old...but its still hard not to like him.
","We get it Clint you can play a good crotchety old man. Luckily fr the viewers of Trouble with the Curve its the best crotchety old man in Hollywood today.Trouble with the Curve is the story of a widowed, aging, and of course blinding baseball scout on one last run because 'The man' is now nor longer using the scouts as much as they are computers putting people like Eastwood out of their jobs. Amy Adams plays the loving but distant daughter of this scout still wondering if why her father left her after her mothers passing almost 3 decades before hand, while having the loving instinct to give up her job as partner in a lawyers firm to help her father along the way of his swan song.There isn't much here that hasn't been seen before man is extraordinary at his job blinding or not, daughter finds a love interest in a baseball player that was once scouted by Eastwoods charter now hoping to be a scout/announcer (played admirably by Justin Timberlake.), daughter secretly knows A LOT about baseball too (this is not a spoiler trust me)., and Eastwoods former darftee (still Timberlakes character) is still a friend but also a scout thats team has the pick before Clints (I know this might be a little confusing for non baseball fans..but its sort of a base ball movie.) Okay so the good is the Performances top to bottom the people that need to be subtle are subtle and those that need to be over the top are over the top. I myself grew up in a baseball family (my father worked full time for a Double A club for a long long long time) so I can assure you its accurate when it comes to scouts and their ways, its beautifully shot. It is always important that the massive grandeur of the baseball field is felt while filming in a real stadium while the homey feeling of backwoods Southern American high school baseball leauge is also right on point due to great camera work.....and finally, Clint Eastwood yea I know I said the performances already BUT Clint is in a league of his own (get what I did right there? lol puns are funny) and he still holds up on the silver screen. No this isn't as good as his performances in Gran Tarino or Dirty Harry but with age he hardly misses a step, his seems spunky and weak at the same time and its just amazing to watch a vet work. Walking the tight rope as an aging actor is a hard thing to do and sometimes we just give former stars passes for being former stars even as their acting skills diminish for whatever reason, but Clint earns respect from his performances and no pity is needed for the man. He is still A list and Trouble with the Curve shows us that.Okay so the bad. Obvious side love story is obvious, obvious premise is obvious, and obvious outcome is obvious...but those things don't ruin movies with the story given to them the cast, director, and crew do a very good job and salvage something that could be hum drum into something worth watching...at least for Eastwood and Baseball fans.I recommend giving it a viewing it'll probably one of the stronger wide releases until 'Rush out the art projects so we can get an Oscar!' season starts in late November.",7,3,7,7 October 2012
Transformers," The Reason Movies are Dying
","OK, this is why the world is going no where in the way of cinema.I have been called a fan boy or an art film elitist, but no thats not the case at all. The producers of Transformers clearly just took the naming rights of a cherished childhood cartoon and neglected to do anything with it nostalgia wise, while somehow not being able to make a single new convincing story.Now when i first came into the theater i was expecting the Citizen Kane of giant robot movies, but there wasn't even any fan service, John Turturro makes what is sure to be a regrettable cameo for such a talented actor, I assume they where trying to add some credibility to a cast of what would otherwise be b-list actors. (Sans Bernie Mac whose cameo is negliable at best) The ad placement in this movie made me borderline ill, and the fact there was little to no fan service from a past series that had such a giant following and tons of material to choose from made me damn near dry heave This is the kind of movies that are the reasons good films are dying, from the sub par acting to the nonsensical shallow plot, to the clich√© dialog the whole thing reeks of Micheal Bay, and mediocrity which any one who takes movie making as an art form opposed to a circus should know by now are synonyms when it comes to film making.I can only recommend this movie to drunken frat boys, and children that don't know any better, aside from that demographic STAY AWAY!",1,3,5,18 December 2009
Dark Shadows," Tim+Johnny, for better or for worse.
","Tim Burton and Johnny Depp feed off each other immensely as working partners and have developed what I can only assume to be a legitimate close friendship over the years. Due to their friendship Hollywood has seen some of the most incredible and original motion pictures over the 90's and 2000's. Im not saying they cant work apart thats not the case at all. Im actually saying they work together so much they might want to be caviler in choosing projects to work on.Dark Shadows is a disappointment for many reasons, and after collaborations between Burton and Depp such as Ed Wood, Edward Scissorhands, and Sleepy Hollow, one has to wonder why this was ever even made. The script doesn't only not work on any real level, its pace is horrible and the film cant decide what it wants to be at all. Dark Shadows cant even decide if it wants the main character in the film Branabus (Played by Depp) to be liked or not, he goes from goofy to high class to murderer in a eye blink and it all comes off flat.Another big problem Dark Shadows has is it never fleshes out any side plot. Like the side plot is glanced at for like a scene then it just pops back in 25 minutes later and you are like 'Oh thats what that random scene 25 minutes ago was about.Other times things just seem forgotten completely. I swear I forgot Bella Heathcote was in the film at on point and she is the love interest, and I didn't forget because I was 'Caught up in the thrill ride that is Dark Shadows.' I forgot because she disappeared for a good 35 minutes and she isn't doing anything during that time, not in danger or kidnapped just kinda goes off screen and comes back later, as to say 'Did I miss anything?. No, Bella. You missed nothing.Much like The Avengers people fight for shoehorned screen time unlike The Avengers the screenplay isn't fan friendly at all so aside from some beautiful filming techniques the film has nothing to offer.If you a Depp fan, Phiffer fan, or A die hard fan of Burton ascetics as a director I guess its worth a watch, but as a film that stands alone its not funny, its not scary, and its not engaging. Its nothing really, you would expect more from Depp and Burton at least a little more.3.5/10",4,9,19,20 May 2012
Star Wars: Episode VII - The Force Awakens," A shot a nostalgia.
","My story is far from a new one in the realm of movie goers. I grew up in the 80's and 90's and a family member introduced me to the Star Wars trilogy I instantly feel in love with the franchise, from the action to the cheesy hat tips to serials of the 40's and more subtle nods to directors like Kurosawa I was stuck a fan. I often argued with friends which one was better, why the Ewoks aren't that bad, and what gave lead these characters to where they ended up. The story while simple was fulfilling a little epic about how a regular joe saved the galaxy.Then of course the dark times came. 3 unnecessary movies that amounted to trying to get Darth Vader into his Darth Vader suit haunted my teens. Metacholrins? Why? Liam Neison playing the most boring role possible? Why? All these little plot holes and points that existed in the original trilogy but were easy to ignore to do immaculate story telling stuck out like the sorest of thumbs on the biggest of hands and I being a teenaged weed smoking to cool for school type of fella had all but given up on Star Wars.Needless to say even though I am a tick away from 30 now I still love me some Star Wars and chalk it up to becoming soft in my old age but even the prequels now have their charms (not the second one though thats still awful) still when I heard Disney acquired Star Wars it did not inspire A New Hope, I figured another Empire was Striking Back, and I did not fawn for The Return of any Jedi (Notice how clever I am). The way I figured is George Lucas almost destroyed his own creation what damage would a soulless corporation like Disney do to it? Well Apparently they would bring back everything I loved about Star Wars and restore my faith in the story and brand as a whole.Episode VII is a simple review. It's big on what we wanted out of the prequels. There are no galactic senates bartering treaties, no stale uninspired pseudo love story seemingly written by someone holding a paint a movie romance by numbers book. There is no Jar Jar Binks, there is no 110 minute build up to a Clone War that lasts 2 minutes, there aren't even any vaguely racist aliens based on stereotypes from the 70's. Nope Episode VII is just all out old fashion fun and excitement.A small droid is sent off in the desert holding a map to the whereabouts to one Luke Skywalker who has been missing for some 30 odd years now. It is sought after by both the rebellion and the first order (empire or sith they are all the same embodiment of evil.) while slaughtering a village to get this map, a storm trooper quickly realizes the fault in his ways. With his help the help of his some familiar and new faces they set off to stop the first order and find Luke to save the galaxy. The black and white duality of the original series returns here things aren't murky conflict exists but at the end of the day it is Good must stop evil or evil wins. The action is brisk and enthralling and the script may be the wittiest of all the Star War films to date. Harrison Ford never losses a beat and continues to embody the Han Solo character as much as he did 30 something years ago. The new cast is beyond charming and reek of talent and exuberance and the Nostalgia alone will have any fan of Star Wars on the edge of their seat waiting for the next line or sequence just because it captures the soul of the original films so well. As far as new viewers well it's treat for them too. JJ Abrams is a fine director and anyone thats a fan of his Star Trek reboots will drool over the delicious set pieces and action sequence entrapt within this wonderful world he creates for the character. There is everything you need for a good film, concise action, love, betrayal, heartbreak, and most importantly old fashion star wars sensibilities.8.5/10",8,2,12,19 December 2015
