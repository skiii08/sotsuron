The Blair Witch Project," What's the big deal?
","Considering how much everyone has been going on about Blair Witch, I really did think that it was decidedly ho hum and average.A friend of mine actually had to leave the cinema through nausea at the movement of the cameras, but I sat through it until the end, despite its lack of any real conclusion.The actors were good and fairly believable, but this certainly did not live up to hype as anything particularly special to me.",6,0,1,8 November 1999
Kill Bill: Vol. 2," Good, but is it getting old hat?
","Kill Bill Vol 2 is the latest in Tarantino's epics, and is very good with it.  As a sequel to last year's very over the top and very violent flick with many throwbacks to martial arts classics, it's often funny but also well put together and watchable elsewhere.However, is it time to ask the question as to whether Tarantino is becoming old hat?  Throughout the film I had an undercurrent going around in my head that this was following what is becoming a set pattern for Tarantino films -- they're becoming a tad manufactured.  As he makes them at significant intervals, this isn't as much of an issue but are his films now becoming over crafted?  Is he becoming a parody of himself?As ever, let's see his next move.",8,1,2,15 May 2004
The Legend of Bagger Vance," Golfing classic!
","A film about golf.  Yawn!Usually.However, Will Smith and Matt Damon work well together in this tale of the local hero taking on the world's greatest two golfers.Smith as the caddy has all the advantages of his natural demenour, and this brings much to the role.  The young upstart golfer Damon plays the same kind of part he always seems to without ever being really challenged.",7,2,5,9 December 2002
Ali," Disappoints ...
","This could have really been a landmark, but unfortunately it falls short. It's reasonably well acted, and Smith has obviously put much work into his portrayal, but it just doesn't quite make it for me.It's hard to put a finger on it -- perhaps its the fact that Smith isn't quite there in physical resemblance to Ali, perhaps its the reminders that you get of the When We Were Kings film, perhaps its the likes of van Peebles not being convincing as Malcolm X.Also, perhaps its the fact that it concentrates too much on the bouts themselves and the boxing action, rather than developing some of the characters who stay on the periphery.This was OK, good even.  But it could have been special.",7,0,1,4 August 2002
Catch Me If You Can," Decidedly average ...
","Despite featuring the wonderful Chjristopher Walken in another excellent performance, catch me if you can is a decidedly average Hollywood portrayal of the life of a playboy conman.Matt Damon (cue silly voice from Team America: World Police) is his usual wooden self as he continues his quest to become the new Keanu Reeves of his day.Tom Hanks is annoying as usual and only some good performances from peripheral cast members and a half decent story hold together and make it watchable.I'd watch it again, but only if it involved much beer!",6,0,4,24 January 2005
The Ring," Seriously Scary!
","Finally ... a big budget Hollywood horror film that is actually scary!A mysterious video is doing the rounds.  If you watch it, you die 7 days later.We follow a mother [a journalist] who has seen the video in her attempts to figure out what is going on so that she can survive herself, and further complicated when her estranged husband and her son see the tape.Well directed and acted, this was worth the admission price.",8,1,2,9 December 2002
Minority Report," Not all that good, actually
","In a day and age when some feller talking to a volleyball passes as a film, this was supposed to be much better.As someone said, like AI but only good instead.I didn't enjoy this that much and found it a bit tiresome in sections, as Cruise did an average job as the cop from the pre crime unit.It was an interesting idea, but you'd have expected that Spielberg would have developed it a lot better.The special effects were very good.",6,0,2,14 July 2002
Training Day," Go Denzel!
","Denzel Washington is so often cast as the good guy that his ability in playing a truly evil character is often misused.  Here he excels as the senior, corrupt, police officer trying to show Ethan Hawke the ropes on his first day in the job [hence the title].Of course you knew that Hawke would rebel against this, but all the same this is thoughtfully directed and the cast play well off Washington.Some of the cinematography is excellent as the longest day seen in film since Nicolas Cage's 'Bringing Out The Dead'.Worth a look.",7,1,11,1 November 2001
Erin Brockovich," Stunned!
","I really don't like Julia Roberts, she really gets on my nerves with her playing the same role in every single film she does.This is an exception, she was fantastic.Brockovich is a struggling single mother who takes on a huge corporation and wins millions of dollars for sick locals who have been poisoned.The strengths of the real life Brockovich are brought through by Roberts, who was excellent.She was outshone by Albert Finney, playing her boss Ed Masry, who was brilliant also.A very much must see, this is a well made film that tells a tale excellently.There was plenty of humour throughout the story, but it was used in its most powerful way - to hammer home the real life story of how these people were treated.",9,1,2,22 April 2000
Meet the Parents," Good - despite the Ben Stiller handicap!
","I don't like Ben Stiller, so De Niro is [again] what attracted me to want to see this film, and again he doesn't disappoint as the greatest character actor of the modern time.As the ex-CIA agent father of the bride to be, he is superb in his overbearing role - particularly enjoyable is him giving Stiller a lie detector test! - and the remainder of the cast operates well around him.Well written and directed, the acting of De Niro did make this a great little film that you have to see!",8,0,0,27 December 2000
Unbreakable," Nonsensical rubbish!
","The closing credits of this film would suggest it is a true story.  I'm very sceptical of that, but if so it's worrying to say the least!Jackson plays a lunatic man who is obsessed by comic books and has had a whole life of injuries and illness, the direct opposite to Willis' seemingly unbreakable life.I didn't really enjoy this to be honest, and it was nowhere near as good as the combination of the two in the Die Hard series.",5,0,0,14 December 2000
Fight Club," Whoa! Here's a film and a half
","Now _this_ is definitely a film and a half.  It features a great script, excellent acting (yes, even from Brad Pitt), some great action scenes and choreography and some world class directing from Se7en director David Fincher.Edward Norton stars again with a performance in the same league as his last film, American History X, and if this man doesn't get an Oscar for one or the other, there is something very, very wrong with the academy.Without revealing the twist in this film, the only thing stopping it getting a 10/10 from my vote was a truly lame last half hour that lead to a completely implausible and corny ending, but that can't take away from what is a must see film.There are some obvious references to comic books, the holocaust and several other events that are very well done, and the interplay between the two main characters has shown just how good the casting was as the on screen chemistry is there for all to see.Don't just watch this film.  Buy the video and watch it several times.",9,0,1,27 November 1999
Monster," Competent tale, highlighted by Theron
","I've never been a great fan of Theron's acting.  She has other assets I'm more keen on :-)However, I was pleasantly surprised by the quality of her performance opposite Ricci, as the lesbian homicidal prostitute Wornos in what is a well put together portrayal of a true story.This was competent throughout without being particularly spectacular, but it was watchable all the same.",7,0,4,8 February 2004
Memento," Not as good as they'd make you believe
","Don't believe the hype -- people seem to go out of their way to tell you how great this film is.  The truth is that, when it comes to the crunch, it's actually not really anything that special.Pearce, as the man who has no short term memory after he sustains a brain injury when his wife is raped and murdered, is competent enough, but this film does get really annoying in the way that it loops within the plot in order to get you back to the same point you were at 2 minutes ago -- and then moves onto the next scene.That was really annoying.A lot of this only makes sense in the last scene -- when the Sammy story finally comes to a point -- but by then it's taken an effort to sit through a lot of the rest of the film.Make no mistake, it's not bad, but it's not anything sensational either.",6,4,6,25 January 2002
Shaun of the Dead," Lots of fun
","As comedy zombie films go [and it's not the hugest genre to be honest!], this is one of the best.  It's not in the same league as Braindead, but Peter Jackson's the king of comedy horror paradies, so it's not fair to compare.Shaun is a electronics salesman who finds himself in the position of needing to save his friends and family when London is over-run by zombies.This doesn't have a go at horror films, as much as actually pay a lot of respect to them and there's enough references there to keep the avid horror buff entertained.In Dawn of the Dead, the mindless braindead zombies go to the mall.  In Shaun of the dead, they go down the pub - a take modern day life if ever this was one.A rollicking good laugh throughout.",8,0,1,10 April 2004
Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl," Unexpected pleasure!
","Often I've not been the world's biggest Johnny Depp fan, and any film made by Disney is usually by default corny rubbish targeted at raking in as much cash as possible with no merit whatsoever.This is very different.Depp plays a wonderfully camp pirate captain helping the sickeningly annoying (as usual) Orlando Bloom get the girl while battling against the new pirate captain Geoffrey Rush, who mutineered Depp when he was his captain.Swashbucklingly funny frequently, the highlight is definitely Depp's performance is what is a very enjoyable ride.",9,1,5,24 January 2005
"South Park: Bigger, Longer & Uncut"," Let's show the moral minority!
","I'm not the greatest fan of the TV series, and I can't say I generally go out of my way to watch it, but I'll see any film that's on, so I trudged along to the cinema to take it in.Firstly, and noticably from the start, it's a lot cruder.  The funniest thing about the whole film is that it's a parody of censorship and mimicks the reaction they knew this film would get from the so-called moral majority (more like minority in my case).To quote Cartman after having seen the silly and offensive Terrance and Philip film: 'you've warped my fragile little mind'.The script writing was excellent, the film took a swipe at everything from Satan's sexuality to Saddam Hussein, and there was some brilliant scenes in which the writing really shone through.Perhaps it's time to change my mind and start watching the series, although it's much toned down to appease the incredibly anal culture of US television.",7,1,2,31 August 1999
Blade," Bearable second time round
","First time I saw this, I thought it was utterly pants and didn't enjoy it at all.  In fact, I'd have given it a 1.On second viewing, it actually isn't that bad, and is far better on the small screen.Wesley Snipes is half vampire [his mother was bitten when she gave birth to him] and his life is dedicated to some kind of revenge, in eradicating them from the planet.The action scenes are well choreographed, Snipes is better than he usually is [not wooden at all for most of the film], and even an appearance by the under-rated Kris Kristofferson can be spotted as this comes towards what is a rather predictable climax, though well put together.One for watching by the less serious moviegoer, it's hardly Citizen Kane, but then again it's not Billy Zane either.",6,0,4,14 July 2001
Troy," Give it a miss
","Right.  Ancient Greek History for Americans.There was some Greeks, and some Trojans.  They fought a bit, spoke in appalling dialogue, acted shockingly and then got into a trojan horse that looked more like a rabbit.  And stuff.  And then some.This has got to be one of the most dumbed down historical 'epics' ever filmed.  Get a cast of well known actors, a terrible script with shocking dialogue [about as deep as a specimen dish], terrible acting and drag it out over 3 hours.The star is the CGI, which doesn't look as choreographed as it usually does, and that's probably the one saving grace.Probably harmless enough tosh, but surely you can find better things to do for 3 hours?  I wonder if Terry Jones is going to sue over the rabbit?",4,1,5,23 May 2004
Chicken Run," Top animated film!
","Nick Park's first full length film is definitely worth seeing.  The characters are really well developed, the animation excellent - but most of all the storyline is brilliant.The concentration camp references are well managed and used satirically, the introduction of Rocky [Mel Gibson's voice] character adds a lot to the film, and there's even an excellently done (if a little contrived!) Star Trek reference in there.Of course they didn't let me fly in the RAF, I'm a chicken!",8,0,0,30 July 2000
Insomnia," Surprising performance from Williams
","I can't stand Robin Williams.  He's incredibly annoying, vaguely talented and has verbal diahorrea.As the killer playing against Al Pacino's cop, he was actually very good and brought much to one of his darkest roles.The name of the film comes from the location of the killing -- in Alaska where it is light for months on end [even at night], as Pacino is slowly driven mad by the perennial brightness.Definitely worth seeing, and one of Pacino's better roles in recent years. He's ageing well.",8,0,0,10 September 2002
The Day After Tomorrow," Great SFX!
","If you go to see a big Hollywood blockbuster nowadays, you can at least rely on the special effects being good.  In the case of The Day After Tomorrow they're a lot better than that, and some of the action on the big screen is truly jawdropping.As you can also expect with Hollywood blockbusters, the money's been invested in the effects and the script suffers it accordingly.  A cast of nobodies [other than Quaid] seemed to do well enough with it, but the dialogue was a bit corny and was lacking craft.That's what you've come to expect though, and if you go to see a big name film that's been much hyped expecting anything else, you *are* as stupid as they think you are!I enjoyed it as some harmless fun.",7,0,0,5 June 2004
X-Men," Classy with top effects, who were they really though?
","I was very impressed by this.  Going by the blurb, I was expecting it to be a silly film based upon cynical money making merchandising.It was actually a classy, well made Sci-Fi film, featuring some superb special effects and some good acting from a capable cast, starring Paquin who was superb.What did irk me though was a burning question, were we told the truth?  Who were the starts *really* ?When Patrick 'Wheels' Stewart put on his silly helmet, he _WAS_ Davros, leader of the Daleks, Dirty Harry played Wolverine (Magneto - you feeling lucky punk?) and if Sabre Tooth wasn't Richard Branson on a bad hair day, I'll eat my hat.",8,0,0,28 August 2000
Sleepy Hollow," Nonsense ... but fun nonsense
","I'm not a great Johnny Depp fan.  He was OK in Edward Scissorhands, but whatever he does has to wipe out the memory of the mind bogglingly awful 21 Jump Street, so he has a way to go yet.This was silly nonsense, but I enjoyed it for that.  Depp is policeman/amateur pathologist (yes, suspend any sense of reality right now!) Ichabod Crane who is sent to the small town of Sleepy Hollow to solve the mystery of murders in which people are decapitated.Without spoiling the plot there's the compulsory love interest (Ricci), the wonderful Miranda Richardson as her step mother and plenty of gore and blood with the special effects of heads being removed at source.It was fun though, and does justice to one of the more famous scary stories you read as you were growing up.  The headless horseman, aaarghhh!",7,0,0,4 January 2000
Scary Movie 2," Avoid! Avoid! Avoid!
","The first film was a fun idea, and not a bad film.  This was pig awful.The classic American need to take parody and then do it to death - see all Mel Brooks films since Blazing Saddles - to the point of overkill was plain to see, and the taking the mickey out of all modern day teen type films was dull, boring and predictable.Avoid it.  With a passion.",1,2,3,1 November 2001
Bridget Jones's Diary," Surprising ...
","This isn't a film I'd usually see.  Were I not on a long haul flight and had seen everything else, I still wouldn't have seen it.Yes it's a chick flick, yes it's soppy, yes Hugh Grant is frequently annoying.Actually, it's not too bad.However, it's well scripted and there are some other good acting performances throughout.  Zellweger is actually quite good, and the dialogue amongst the trio is well structured and believable.I wouldn't bother to see it again, but you might wish to see it if there are no other better options.",7,0,0,1 November 2001
The Bourne Identity," Dull!
","Perhaps having a few beers before seeing this was a good idea after all!It was supposed to be an engrossing thriller [if the book is anything to go by -- which outshines the film by the way] but it was actually dull and uninteresting, and my thoughts about Damon being a mediocre actor haven't changed from seeing it.The relationship between him and his co-star was scarcely believable and not very realistic, and I was bored way too soon into the film.",4,3,6,9 September 2002
The Thing," One of the better examples of its genre
","Actually quite a freaky tale, Carpenter's The Thing is one of the better horror films of the early 80s [and there were some awful ones!] and one of Kurt Russell's best performances.An alien life form is waken from a deep sleep by some Norwegian [well, it wasn't going to be American was it?] Antarctic residents, and begins to morph into earth life forms and wreak havoc -- starting with huskys and then getting into the men themselves.Worth watching, and had dated well.",7,1,3,13 July 2003
Pitch Black," Pitch Pants more like!
","This film was just plain dumb.  The effects and the cinematography were good, but the cast and particular the script were abysmal.Lowlight has to be the character who exclaims 'crikey' when someone dies. Yes, _that_ cringeworthy.",3,0,1,13 November 2000
American Psycho," not bad, but hardly a classic
","There's a lot of talk about this film, basically down to the book presumably.Christian Bale was good, but this was hardly a classic.  It was a little dull actually, as a tale of 80s debauchery and some utterly tragic music - which I thought I'd forgotten about!It wasn't bad, but I wouldn't cross the road to see it.  The scenes of graphical violence weren't as bad as the hype, but when are they ever?",7,1,2,2 May 2000
North by Northwest," Almost the tops
","Were it not for Rear Window, this would be the greatest of Hitchcock's films.Perhaps I should have given this a 10/10 as I did for the James Stewart classic, but I just can't bring myself to compare it in the same class as that superb film so it gets a 9!Cary Grant is an advertising executive who is mistaken for a spy [who is actually just a decoy anyway!] and gets chased across the country and ends up falling for the token blonde along the way.Excellently directed and acted, the special effects scenes are without doubt ahead of their time given that this was made in 1959, and there are some spectacular scenes on Mount Rushmore that really give the film some realistic credence.James Mason and a VERY young Martin Landau also provide some superb supporting roles to the excellent Grant.  A must see.",9,1,2,27 December 2000
Terminator 3: Rise of the Machines," There's only one Arnie
","He might be an aging hero how, but there's still only one Arnie and he reprises his role as the Terminator as if he's never been away.John Connor's now in his 20s, and a female Terminator [the T-X] has been sent back to get rid of him and his future wife.   On, of course, judgment day.Some of the action scenes and one liners are classic Arnie, in what is a bit of a darker film than you'd expect from Arnie given his reputation nowadays.Quite enjoyable and fun, and definitely worth seeing.",7,0,0,5 August 2003
U-571," My opinion changed!
","I must admit to being a little reticent about seeing this at first - due to the fact that I have an irrational hatred of Matthew McConaughey; I just can't stand him!  I don't think he can act, he just gets parts because of his pretty boy good looks in cynical money making Hollywood.OK, I'll not get started on that one ;-)This is the story of a group of American (as always) war heroes who are given a mission to recover an ENIGMA machine from a stricken Nazi submarine.Its best features are the special effects, and the performance of Harvey Keitel, despite his particularly awful moustache.  Bill Paxton plays the captain well, getting the obvious arrogance needed in such leadership across well.This is worth a look, and by the end of it I was actually quite enjoying it.And as for McConaughey ...",7,0,1,4 June 2000
The Shining," Good, but not as much as you'd been told
","This is good for a Stanley Kubrick film.  Kubrick being the most over-rated film maker of all time, who made dross after dross after dross.This is well acted, had a good plot [the influence of Stephen King's storytelling shows through], and were it not for a under the weather performance from Duvall -- compared to her colleagues -- and the annoying directing of Kubrick -- the king of uninspiring and dull symbolism, this would have been a lot better.Jack Nicholson plays a nut case in the way that only he can, he truly is one of the outstanding actors of his generation, well up there with De Niro, Malkovich et al.Worth a look, but you'd have to enquire what extra value you get on the DVD -- is it really worth the price difference?",8,0,1,19 January 2002
American Beauty," Spacey shines in modern day classic
","A classic of our time, Sam Mendes' American Beauty is yet another showcase for the truly outstanding acting talent that is Kevin Spacey.As the father in a suburban family, Spacey is going nowhere with his life. So he sets about making some changes to every facet of his being, his work, his love life, his family as a whole - himself in short.Annette Bening is also very good as his wife, and some brilliant supporting performances by an excellent cast make this a rare pleasure in what seem to be times of low brow Hollywood blockbusters that have little artistic merit.There is so much to this film that made it film of the year, and so many obvious reasons why it won so many awards.  The symbolism alone is powerful and brilliant.",9,0,0,2 January 2001
Terminator 2: Judgment Day," Arnie's best
","Many years on, T2 is still one of the best sci fi films ever, and is definitely the Governator's best performance in his acting career.Arnie as the robotic 'good' Terminator becomes more human by the end of the tale as he attempts to save the Connors from the liquid metal 'bad' Terminator.The special effects are still spectacular today, and the only downside is some of Linda Hamilton's voiceover cheeseyness.",9,1,1,9 February 2004
The Patriot," Braveheart in the USA? Don't know about that - but not anything special
","Mel's son's killed, Mel becomes all vengeful, runs about holding up the flag - 'you can't kill me, I love the United States of America' type stuff (didn't he _SEE_ how bad The Postman was?) - cheesy stuff all round.Some of it was very well done, without offering a spoiler the 'church scene' in particular, and there were some good and quite realistic special effects, particularly of the battles between Mel and the Redcoats, which got across the arrogance of the British that we only know too well from colonial times.Worth watching, but I wouldn't bother again.",6,1,2,30 July 2000
Being John Malkovich," Now that's what I call a film!
","This is more like it, a film that actually surprises you all the way through with some brilliant writing and superb acting performances from Cusack, Diaz and Malkovich himself.Just the whole concept is weird enough to make you take a completely different slant on the film, right down to the portal to John's mind being itself on the 7 and a halfth floor of a building.Excellent script, brilliant acting and a fantastically weird idea makes this one of the best films I have seen in a long time.",9,1,2,2 April 2000
54," Had promise, didn't really deliver
","Must admit that I'm quite a fan of Mike Myers, but by the end of this film he was starting to annoy me.  Perhaps it's because he is so good as Austin Powers that the character seems to pervade everything else he plays also - such as Steve Rubell in this case.  There were moments that he sounded and acted like Powers far too frequent in 54.Rubell, the founder and owner of trendy NY nightclub 54, finally fell foul of the authorities as we all know; but the story of what happened and how is interesting all the same.It should have been a lot longer film, it was only starting to really go somewhere when it finished.Salma Hayek and Ryan Phillippe gave good performances, and Neve Campbell was absolutely gorgeous as usual, and is a really under rated actress at the same time, doing a good role as the soap star looking to get big.  A credible, believable and well acted role.Could have been a lot better, didn't quite make it.",6,0,1,4 March 2001
American History X," Truly superb
","This is a brilliant film, but very disturbing.  Norton as the skinhead who sees the error of his ways is excellent in the role, notably his internal strife and his trying to guide his brother away from following him.The rest of the cast support him well in what is a truly frightening insight into a section of society that people don't talk about, but is there and needs addressing.",9,0,0,28 May 2000
Ocean's Eleven," Not the greatest of remakes
","Given the cast on offer, this was more than a little disappointing.  As a remake of a particularly uninteresting 'Brat Pack' film, perhaps expecting anything more is unreasonable.George Clooney leads a brood of villans -- including Matt Damon and Brad Pitt -- who are trying to rob Andy Garcia's casinos, but he is personally more interested in getting his wife [Julia Roberts] back.Predictable and the star studded cast failed to hold together an underperforming plot.",6,0,1,9 December 2002
Pearl Harbor," It's not THAT bad
","It's average.  It's long.  It's average [again].  But, it's not all that bad.Sure, Ben Affleck can't act, and Josh Hartnell was not credible as surely the most effeminate male hero in a major blockbuster film.Kate Beckinsale is good enough, and the effects make the film.  The script is poor, but some of the special effects of the attack itself are absolutely fantastic.",6,0,1,5 June 2001
Die Hard 2," In retrospect, rather tiresome
","Bruce Willis doesn't get on well with Christmas in Die Hard, so we have obvious grounds for a sequel.  Set at Dallas Airport, Willis has to try and overcome some terrorists who are threatening to let planes drop from the sky - including the one bringing his wife home.This is everything that was Hollywood in the 80s [despite this being made in 1990], action, big explosions, gun fights and not a lot else.  Any semblance of a plot is out of the window -- although that's not why you watch these films is it?In comparison to the other great sequels of the time, the Lethal Weapon films, this really does look aged and haggard.  The Lethal Weapon series at least moved on, and developed the characters well as they got older and moved with the times.Credit must go to Dennis Franz, who might as well have been called Officer Stereotype.  How an actor could be so desparate as to play possibly the most one dimensional character in film history, one can always wonder.Watch it when having a few beers on a Saturday night.  Preferrably about a dozen of them.",5,1,3,19 May 2001
Resident Evil," A bit different
","OK, I'll admit I went to see this film because of Jovovich.  Isn't she lovely?However, this actually offered something a bit different from the standard genetic experiment/DNA freak type of film you've seen a bit over recent years.The innovative environment of being stuck in a 'hive' underground and having to save the world from the nasty virus offered lots of good action scenes, some innovative effects and the occasional fright.Worth seeing.",7,0,1,22 July 2002
Man on the Moon," Carrey needs some credit
","Jim Carrey has made some appalling rubbish, but again (as with the Truman Show) he shown his ability as an actor, rather than just a moron in Man On The Moon.For me Andy Kaufman was just 'that bloke from taxi', as US tv is only seen in its entirety in ... well, the USA!Carrey portrayed the mind of the man excellently, in what started off as an enjoyable comedy and ended as a tear jerker.",7,0,0,22 May 2000
28 Days Later...," Has its moments
","This concept has been don before -- the world is ravaged and a few have to live on and save the human race.  Nothing can come up to the mark of the Day of the Triffids [but then what could?], but this has enough originality and strong performances from an all British cast to keep you interested until the end.The only well known cast member -- Christopher Eccleston -- helped hold things together well in his role as the commander of the army unit.",7,0,0,9 December 2002
Coyote Ugly," Could have been a lot worse!
","When you hear as much about a film, you don't have any option but have to see it!And I must say the majority of the reviews were a little unfair -- it wasn't actually that bad.Piper Perabo goes to the big city, and ends up working as a barmaid with a penchant for dancing and signing on the bar.  She was actually quite good, as was her father [John Goodman] and the rest of the cast were bearable.The token Australian love interest was a strange character who never went anywhere, but this was actually watchable all the same.",7,0,1,14 December 2000
K-19: The Widowmaker," He's not exactly Sean Connery is he?
","As far as russian submarine flicks go, there's only one Hunt for Red October.  Although hopefully this is better than the inevitable Kursk film that must come along and is bound to be a bunch of sentimental clap trap!K-19 [wasn't that the robot in Doctor Who?] is a sub that fails in a nuclear incident, and then Harrison Ford & Liam Neeson brush up against each other trying to make a decision as to what to do.And that's about as interesting as it gets.As an old man 25 years on, Liam Neeson looks about the same age with a dodgy grey wig on.  Plenty of playing of meaningful music and all that Hollywood rubbish abounds too.Definitely an average film, and disappointing at 6/10.",6,0,2,23 May 2004
Moulin Rouge!," Particularly silly film
","Oh yes, all the critics love it.  As usual, that's a great indicator that the film is rubbish.  And this film is particularly rubbish.Some of the sets are well crafted - why this gets a 2/10 rather than a 1/10 for me - but both Kidman and McGregor are annoying and embarrass themselves with the singing roles as this drags on.And on.And on.And on.Yawnfest.",2,1,5,1 November 2001
Men in Black II," Not so bad
","I've heard good and bad about this sequel, but I thought it was OK and enjoyed it.Smith has to deneuralise Jones and bring him out of retirement in order to save the world [unexpectedly!].There's the expectedly array of funky aliens -- the worms in particular -- and some good gags, especially the Michael Jackson related ones and the postal workers.",7,0,0,9 August 2002
Donnie Brasco," Stereotyped
","There are some things every gangster film must have.  Someone called Pauli, Michael Madsen playing exactly the same character he always does, lots of people wandering around saying 'Forget About It' [hey, this even made an art form of this] and Al Pacino being, well, Al Pacino.Pacino is excellent.  Johnny Depp isn't bad either.  It's based on a true story, but the portrayal of the characters is a bit stereotyped to say the least.  The usually excellent Anne Heche is pretty poor as Depp's wife, and there were a few sloppy parts of the plot.The FBI had an operation called 'Operation Donnie Brasco'.  Now, I just don't believe that for a second.  That operation name would have got out, with mob connections in the FBI, and he'd have been killed.  They're just not stupid enough to do things like that.All that aside, it's as good as most other films of this genre since Goodfellas.  Worth a look.",7,0,4,14 July 2001
Kill Bill: Vol. 1," Tantalysing ...
","OK, I'll admit that I did know it was a 2 part film series.  However, by the time that Kill Bill had finished, leaving a tantalysing wait till the sequel, I'd forgotten!This has had much criticism, but if people don't like Tarantino, then they just shouldn't go to see his films.  As the bride left for dead, Uma Thurman gives her usual good performance as she starts hunting down her assailants before she goes for Bill himself.Lucy Liu gives the best performance in a cast that features several of the Tarantino regulars, including Michael Madsen again.Worth a look, although there is much gruesome violence.  The swordfight with Thurman vs All of Japan is the best part.",7,0,0,18 October 2003
Mission: Impossible II," Tom's back, and it's silly
","You wouldn't expect anything more from John Woo, the director of the nonsensical Face Off amongst others.Tom runs around doing silly things, stupid stunts for the sake of it, and gets the (admittedly gorgeous) girl.  The Face Off theme is back, and this just became ridiculous as people began tearing off their faces seemingly endlessly to reveal that they were someone else.I was just about waiting for Elvis to show up!The fight scenes were very Oriental with silly mid air kicking things all over the place, and as for the motorcycles that 'happened' to being driven around the island that Tom stole one from, that was the most obvious prop setup I've seen.  Their presence was completely irrelevant to the story.Enjoyed the effects, but the film itself is nothing other than pure Popcorn stuff.",6,0,1,30 July 2000
Black Hawk Down," What's the big deal?
","A great war movie?  As if.The tale of US soldiers who foolhardedly go into Mogadishu isn't half Hollywooded up and stereotyped big time.  The recycling of cast in war films - Josh Hartnett [rubbish, again] and Tom Sizemore [even wearing his helmet at the same angle as the last war film he was in] - is a bit cynical, and does little to interest the viewer.The pleasant surprise was the performance of Ewan McGregor, who was truly excellent.This is OK, but hardly anything to write home about.  And it did drag on.",6,1,3,20 January 2002
Big Fish," Fantastic
","I really enjoyed this Burton story, more so than some of his other films. McGregor is fantastic as the young, tale-telling, hero of our story, and Finney is just as excellent as him in his old age.Featuring some fine performances from other members of a well drilled cast, Burton's ability to spin a tale shines through in what is entertaining throughout, and often emotional as the story of a son's relationship with his father is weaved throughout.",9,0,0,8 February 2004
The Insider," Pacino and Crowe shine
","I find it amazing that such a good film as this did not get a larger billing, or a longer release window, certainly in the UK anyway.  To have had to catch it on video as I couldn't get to the cinema at the time is insane.Al Pacino is the 60 minutes producer battling with the story that he can't put on air, due to legal machinations and pressure from a tobacco company, after getting the story from insider [hence the name of the film] and whistleblower Russell Crowe, who is again showing that he is an all round actor of some repute - not in the same league as Pacino obviously, but impressing more from film to film.Pacino is wonderful, as he seemingly always is, and is incredibly convincing as the TV producer who'll fight as much as it takes to get his story across.A top cast, a well scripted and directed film, and an amazingly candid tale given the subject matter; and that it's based on a true story.I'm sure that the soundtrack had some classical music tunes that also appeared in Gladiator, perhaps Russell gets a bulk film discount from the record company!",8,0,1,23 February 2001
2001: A Space Odyssey," So what?
","Not having seen this film until 2001; I'm compelled to enquire as to what is the big deal?  We all know Stanley Kubrick was a weird man in many ways, but this film is just decidedly average.Other than some of the visual effects which are spectacular, and the fact that it was OK in parts aboard the spaceship, the rest of it was rather boring and nothing special.The video is true to the film ... down to the point of the 10 minute blacked out section in the middle with music playing and a title in the screen saying 'Intermission'!That's taking realism a little far.",6,3,6,28 September 2001
There's Something About Mary," Better on the big screen!
","Having seen this on video now as well as at the cinema, it doesn't have the same impact as on the big screen.Diaz is brilliant, Spiller and Dillon are very good - and there are plenty of other sweet and funny moments.Hair gel is the highlight though.",8,0,0,7 May 2000
The Last Samurai," Dropped away significantly
","For a film that started off well, this dropped off significantly as it dragged on.And on.And on.Tom Cruise as the soldier from Custer's regiment who ends up training with Samurai was his usual self.  Not spectacular, but solid.  The rest of the cast were competent enough, and the only real interest by the end was the insight into 19th century Japan when the Western influences started to flood in.",6,1,2,11 January 2004
The Hurricane," Truly awesome performance
","One of the best films I've seen for years, this is absolutely excellent all round, from the script to the directing, to the cast, to Denzel Washington himself as the wrongly convicted boxer Rubin 'The Hurricane' Carter.Set in the 22 years from his conviction to his release, The Hurricane is the story of racism, corruption, hope, and above all, one man's torment.When I say torment, the peace and tranquility Carter found while in prison is amazing, as is his drive and determination to keep going - a lesser man would have died in half the time.Washington shows his brilliance as a convincing character actor yet again in what, perhaps along with the Green Mile, is the film of the 90s.The Hurricane deserves all the accolades and awards it got [which are nowhere enough by the way] and a whole lot more.",10,3,5,20 February 2001
A Clockwork Orange," So what?
","Having waited such a long time to see this film, it really was a bit of a disappointment.That would be a bit strong perhaps, it was good without ever getting to the levels of being anything special; although that is perhaps due to it being a victim of its own hype and being as dated as it now is.Burgess' brilliant book was largely turned ho hum by one of the most over-rated directors of all time, and the main redeeming factor was the soundtrack and the performances of the supporting actors to the ever irritating Malcolm McDowell, who is now a part of that annoying band of celebrities who are famous for being famous, having done nothing any good since.Worth seeing to judge for yourself, and the soundtrack is excellent.",7,1,3,2 April 2000
From Hell," Double vision!
","Interesting perspective on the Jack The Ripper tale, this is one theory as to who the killer was and the reasoning behind the killings of this group of prostitutes, of which Heather Graham plays her role brilliantly.Depp is the investigating officer with the appalling excuse for an East End accent who is assisted by the always fun and class Robbie Coltrane.  Iain Richardson is Depp's boss, and plays the role of an arrogant Victorian in the way that only he and Nigel Hawthorne can with greatness.Definitely entertaining and well made, I had an interesting experience in that I actually saw Depp himself while on the way to the cinema in Los Angeles!",7,0,1,1 November 2001
Rocky," Stallone's best ?
","Some might say that it's not the greatest of accolades to call a film Stallone's best cinematic effort.Actually, I think over the years he has been under-rated and has done some good material, but there is no doubt that Rocky is his masterpiece.As journeyman boxer Rocky Balboa, Stallone impresses throughout with both his physique and his character acting, in the ultimate story of David vs Goliath - his bout with undisputed heavyweight champion Apollo Creed not exactly something that seems realistic in these heady days of Don King dominated 'show' boxing.Immensely enjoyable and excellent throughout, even 25 years on this is still an excellent film and good entertainment.",8,0,0,24 January 2005
Mystic River," Clint's best
","Better even than Unforgiven, Clint Eastwood's mystic river is his best effort at directing so far, much helped along by an outstanding cast with performances that ranged from good [Penn, bacon] to outstanding [Robbins].The late of the murder of Penn's daughter is much deeper than first impressions suggest, with the trauma of Robbins as a schoolboy intertwined into the tale.A must see.",8,0,0,28 December 2003
Enemy at the Gates," Decidedly average
","I can understand a film centreing on Russia featuring actors who speak in English to aid comprehension of the dialogue.However, when the actors do not speak with anything resembling Russian accents, and in fact speak in a variety of English and American accents when they are supposed to be Soviets, the film loses much credibility.Jude Law played the role of the hero in the same style he always does, Bob Hoskins was utterly not credible as Kruschev and Fiennes and Harris came across as scarcely believable also.Given the current fashion for making WWII films, this is at the poorer end of the scale, and is one to watch only when there is nothing else available in-flight [as I saw it].Give it a miss.",5,1,3,1 November 2001
A Beautiful Mind," Superb
","This was thoroughly superb from start to finish, highlighted by a magnificent performance from Russell Crowe as the schizophrenic genius John Nash, with fine supporting performances from Jennifer Connelly and Ed Harris.Ron Howard has outdone himself in obviously the greatest directing performance of his career, as this superbly crafted film comes to a brilliant and very emotional climax.One of the best films I've seen, I can't recommend it highly enough.",9,0,2,10 March 2002
Mr. & Mrs. Smith," Excellent fun !
","Not sure what to expect, I went along to see Mr & Mrs Smith based largely on the cast ... particularly Angelina Jolie :) I was very pleasantly surprised by what was often silly, but harmless fun throughout as contract killers Pitt and Jolie get pitted against each other as their supposedly final hits.Jolie was fantastic, Pitt was very good and this is very cleverly written, directed and acted. It's not Oscar winning material, but it's thoroughly enjoyable if you're looking for a non serious film to while an evening away.Definitely one to see.",7,0,3,4 July 2005
Die Hard with a Vengeance," Spectacular
","Regardless of what you might think of Bruce Willis, he really does excel in this series of films and John McClane, the all action policeman is the perfect role for him.This time his sidekick is the guru of the action film, Samuel L. Jackson, the owner of an electrical store, as he goes up against the ever excellent Jeremy irons, who can play a bad guy like few others.Irons is executing the greatest heist ever, and the shots throughout the film are spectacular.  The lack of any half decent script is completely masked by explosions, but what else would you expect?",7,56,76,18 July 2001
The Green Mile," Hanks picks another winner
","Probably the best film I've seen of the year; The Green Mile deserves all the plaudits and awards it gets.Tom Hanks is excellent as the prison guard on death row, but Michael Clare Duncan is superb as John Coffey, the miracle working giant.The barbarism of the death sentence comes through during a blundered execution that was the deliberate work of a sadistic guard.Thought provoking and moving throughout, the length of this film wasn't a put off whatsoever.  Several funny moments also made it enjoyable as well as moving.",9,1,2,14 December 2000
Platoon," Disturbingly dark
","At a time when Vietnam films abounded, Oliver Stone's Platoon is one of the darker and probably one of the best of the lot.A young recruit has a major conflict of conscience when ordered to massacre villagers, and the moral dilemma gives this film an edge that many of Stone's other films lack [I personally think he's majorly over rated].With a cast of 'starts of the future' at the time it was made, this is worth a look.",7,0,1,28 September 2003
Blow," Fails where Traffic succeeds
","I wasn't a great fan of Traffic as a film, but at least on this subject it was a little innovative and broke some new ground.Watching Depp in Blow, I was forever reminded of his role in the terrible Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas, and that he has gone over this ground before.His role as George Jung, a man significant in his drug trafficking achieving down the years, he got across the point of now being a sad old man with many regrets, so the message did come across -- if a little long and drawn out as far as films go.  This was more than a little lethargic at many points, and could have used some more detail being given to the editing.Depp as an old man bears an uncanny resemblance to Noddy Holder from Slade, which didn't help for credibility towards the end!",6,0,1,10 June 2001
Raging Bull," The making of De Niro the actor
","The most renowned film of the Scorsese/De Niro partnership, Raging Bull is an insight into a highly disturbed man's life, superbly played by De Niro [as usual].His growing paranoia and jealousy, particularly where his wife Vickie is concerned, helps build a man who you should have pity for by the end of the film, but you just can't bring yourself to have that pity.De Niro's talent as a character actor shines through, and you do believe that he is a boxer as he is incredibly convincing as Jake La Motta.The black and white cinematography and camera work gives Raging Bull the feeling of a documentary well, and it fits perfectly as a classic Scorsese film.Some of the supporting cast did well, others gave a predictable performance [particularly Joe Pesci], although perhaps this is inevitable given that the same Italian Americans seem to appear in every film set in this community.",8,1,2,27 December 2000
The Iron Giant," Good entertainment all round
","This wasn't what I'd expected at all.  I haven't seen a general certificate film for years through frustration at the corny over commercialised cynical tripe dished out by the Disney corporations of the cinema world, but I really enjoyed this animated feature.A small boy befriends an alien killing machine robot and changes his ways in 1950s USA, with all the paranoia over the Russians, the Cubans and Nuclear War in the background.This is a delightful little story as the boy and his mother have a government agent move in on them and bully the boy, Hogarth, as the army tries to destroy the giant alien machine.Most enjoyable was the comical parody of the 'duck and cover' informational films, which was quite funny and almost Ren and Stimpy-esque.",8,0,0,31 December 1999
Vanilla Sky," One of Cruise's better performances
","One of Tom Cruise's better films of recent years, and certainly less 'Hollywood' than most others he has done for a long time.Publishing magnate Cruise has everything -- money, fame, success and two beautiful women [Cruz & Diaz] in his life.Then he loses it. And spectacularly so.As a portrait of a man losing his sanity after a terrible car crash, this is actually quite intriguing and I didn't see the end coming, which is unusual for a big budget film these days.",7,2,3,9 December 2002
Any Given Sunday," Oliver Stone shocker!
","I'm not sure what brought me to be watching a film about American Football. It's a silly sport that makes no logical sense.Perhaps it's the benefits of late night satellite TV!DeNiro was superb as the coach in this film, and the other benefit of course is the lovely Cameron Diaz.It's well scripted, acted and directed [a surprise, given that it's Oliver Stone] and the interplay between the characters is both believable and enjoyable.In the end it's a tale of people as ever, and not of Grid Iron, so it's actually well worth watching.",7,0,0,10 March 2002
Bruce Almighty," Tiresome
","He can do silly voices, he can do a rubber face.  That's it.  He's not actually funny.Ladies and gentlemen, Jim Carrey is back in his 'comedy' genre.  Quite why a great actor such as Morgan Freeman lowered himself to this I'm not sure, but his performance as God is one of the few saving graces of what is a tiresome film that makes you want to leave as early as possible.Give it a miss.",5,1,2,19 July 2003
The Deer Hunter," DeNiro at his best
","The quintessential DeNiro role, to which only Jake Lamotta in Raging Bull can compare, the Deer Hunter is a truly classic rendition on the destruction that the Vietnam War causes to a small community.Excellently supported by perhaps Christopher Walken's best performance, this gets better the more times you see it.  The Russian Roulette scene is truly harrowing, and never loses this impact despite now being 25 years old.",9,1,2,5 May 2003
Identity," Decidedly Average
","You'd expect something a bit better pairing off John Cusack and Ray Liotta, but Identity is a dreary tale of the multiple personality disorder of a mass murderer who is about to be executed.Not really offering anything of interest, it's voyeurism is rather predictable and part of a dull trend of such films.",6,1,2,16 June 2003
Speed," Don't bee too hard on Keanu
","OK, we all know that Keanu Reeves can't act, and that he's only in films to give the ladies something to look at.  Putting that aside, Speed is actually quite a good film and a bit of fun.Dennis Hopper is excellent - as ever - and Sandra Bullock is passable, in the days before she was *incredibly* annoying.The high speed chase, the effects [the bus jump particularly] and even the plot were good, and Reeves isn't as bad as he has been elsewhere.",7,0,0,28 May 2001
X2: X-Men United," Harmless enough, but it's still like the Daleks!
","I've tried very hard, but it's almost impossible to take Patrick Stewart's character serious in these films, looking as much like Davros, leader of the Daleks from the Dr Who series as he does.Resisting the temptation to loudly shout 'exterminate' when he's duped into attempting to wipe out the mutants from the planet earth, he joins forces with his arch enemy Magneto [Ian McKellen] to attempt to save the mutant race when the president declares war on mutants.With Hugh Jackman reprising his role of Wolverine well, and with some competent performances from co stars Anna Paquin, Halle Berry, McKellen and the lovely Famke Janssen, this is one of the better Hollywood sequels of recent years, and is worth a look if you're after some harmless enough fun.",7,0,0,30 May 2004
The Sixth Sense," Excellent twist
","This I really enjoyed.  I'd heard a bit about it ('I see dead people'), and was amazed at how good Bruce Willis was.The star was Haley Joel Osment though, as young Cole.  He was superb and really chilling, and scared me more than once.  This was an excellently written and directed film, and without spoiling the twist in the tale, it was real goosebumps down the spine material.Go see it!",9,0,0,8 November 1999
Final Destination," Not exactly a horror film
","If it wasn't for a few gory death scenes, this would be firmly a thriller, but I suppose it is a horror of some sorts - more a teen slasher film where some nauseating adolescents get what they undoubtedly deserve.The main character, Alex Browning (scarily similar name to my own!) sees a hallucenation of a plane crash, and upon getting off a plane this actually happens.  The main premise is that there is a force of evil knocking off those who survived, which although not a novel idea was well brought across.This film was occasionally frightening, and kept going right till the end - which is more than you can say for a lot of the Hollywood pap of recent times.",8,1,2,22 May 2000
Rear Window," Awesome Hitchcock Classic
","I could go on about this film for ever and ever!Having never seen it before, I had taken the opportunity to buy the restored film on video [which they have done a great job with BTW] and have just been blown away.Jimmy Stewart is fantastic as the injured photographer with only his rear window to entertain him all day, as if he were watching the people out the back on Television.The newly weds, the couple sleeping on the balcony, Miss Torso, Miss Lonely Hearts, The Composer, and, of course, Mr Thorwald [Raymond Burr] keep this film going and going and going.And that's before you even mention Grace Kelly, whose beauty is all the more in this restored copy of the classic.There are so many levels to this story, the relationship between Stewart and Kelly which Stewart seems to be using his Rear Window to detract him from, the police officer investigating Thorwald, Stewart's home help Stella [Thelma Ritter] who provides much of the comedy in this story.Hitchcock was an absolute genius, and this was his masterpiece.",10,1,3,4 June 2000
The Replacements," Mr Talent strikes again!
","Keanu Reeves is allegedly the star of this film, which you'd have expected to be a straight to video classic.  Some films don't deserve a cinema release, and this is so average and uninspiring that it doesn't either.Trying to turn a bunch of rejects into a grid iron team that can take on the world sounds uninteresting.And it is.",5,0,1,23 August 2002
Thirteen Days," Anything is possible!
","I've had a long running joke with a friend for a long time that goes 'Anything is possible -- Kevin Costner might make a watchable film!'This man has more to answer for than most for the unadulterated c*** he has subjected us to down the years.  Dances with Wolves, The Postman, Waterworld, that awful baseball film.None of them come near the Postman, undoubtedly the worst film ever made, but all an insult to the intelligence of the moviegoing public.Hence, I was a little sceptical when I went to see Thirteen Days, the story of the Cuban missile crisis.What a film, well cast [Bruce Greenwood was superb as JFK] so that you actually believed the characters were who they purported to be [amazing for a Costner film] and scripted, the direction was also excellent in what was a film that got across just how close we did come to World War III.Of course there was the usual Hollywood bending of the truth on this one, but watching it as a film indicative of those two weeks that gets the message across, it is well worth seeing.Perhaps I'll see another Costner film one day, but then am I pushing my luck?",8,0,0,25 March 2001
Monty Python and the Holy Grail," Gets better every time you see it!
","One of the great comedy classics, this is simply the greatest work of the Monty Python team.  The much missed Graham Chapman is superb as King Arthur, and the rest of the crew are also brilliant.As a story, the quest for the Holy Grail gets sillier and sillier, and funnier - particular favourites being the French castle dwellers and the Knights who say 'ne'.This would get a 10/10 rather than the 9 I have given it were it not for what is rather a lame ending.",9,0,0,14 December 2000
Saboteur," Fails to set the screen on fire
","One of Hitch's earlier forays into cinema, Saboteur is good enough, but doesn't light any particular fires as to being anything worth writing home about.Set in wartime, the undercurrent is always there as Robert Cumming fights to clear his name having been accused of sabotaging his factory.  He gets caught in a plot that goes all the way to a thrilling [for its time] climax on the Statue of Liberty.Love interest Priscilla Lane does well, but some of the supporting cast were actually very poor actors and completely unconvincing.One for video on a rainy day.",6,1,5,30 June 2001
Gangs of New York," Day-Lewis shines through
","You could say that this is Scorsese's best film for years -- but then that's not hard as he has made some rubbish down the years.The tale of the gang warfare that surrounded the growing pains of New York City in the early days needed telling, and he does an excellent job of it.It's a shame that the always annoying DiCaprio was cast in this, as he really gets on your nerves [as usual] within the first 5 minutes.  And for a film of this length, that is cruel and unusual punishment!Cameron Diaz makes up for it with her best performance in a serious role, but the star is Daniel Day-Lewis as the Butcher, and he was as superb as he always is in an utterly breathtaking and outstanding performance.  If he doesn't take away an Oscar for this role, my opinion of the Academy will be set in stone.",8,0,0,1 February 2003
Windtalkers," Believable?
","Seeing the previews you'd think this was actually rubbish.  It looked like patronising Hollywood tripe.In reality, it actually wasn't all that bad.  Nicolas Cage was good -- but then isn't he always? -- and Christian Slater wasn't as annoying as he has been in the past.Despite the fact that the concept sounds a little silly -- Navaho speaking radio operators that communicate in code to confuse the Japanese during WWII -- when you actually see this true story you do appreciate the contribution made to the war effort.",7,2,4,10 September 2002
Gladiator," Scott classic!
","I've never been a great Ridley Scott fan.  Anyone who can make GI Jane has a lot to answer for, but this absolutely excellent - the acting is brilliant (Crowe particularly), the script is OK and the effects are awesome, especially the coliseum scenes.The only compliant is that is drags on a little long.Crowe - a New Zealander who started in acting in Australia, got his break in the USA and plays a Spaniard in Rome - is certainly showing his versatility, despite his accent occasionally being out of place.Joaquin Phoenix is also good, and undoubtedly the least irritating member of that family!  Richard Harris did well, and the Oliver Reed pieces were also good.  Despite his notoriety for his drinking, people actually tend to forget that Reed was a talented actor, and it is well displayed here.",8,0,0,28 May 2000
Donnie Darko," Deeply freaky
","A thoroughly strange film about a paranoid schizophrenic kid that believes he is being followed around by a giant rabbit that is making him do bad things, Donnie Darko is hard to know how to take as a film.Often bizarre but also sometimes good, this is one that keeps you thinking after the fact.",7,1,2,3 May 2003
Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade," Silly, but fun all the same
","Indiana Jones III has all you would expect -- a silly story, corny jokes a la Arnie from front to back, a good performance by Connery, and Jones' usual antics.It's not particularly good to be honest, but then it doesn't need to be does it?The search for the holy grail was the task behind the adventure, and it's only been done better by Monty Python -- perhaps they should have got together and made the story more fun!",7,0,0,27 January 2002
The Birds," One of his best
","This, apart from Rear Window, is the best Hitchcock film I've seen.  The symbolism of the birds throughout really does start to freak you out, and the acting of Hedren particularly does bring out genuine terror in the predicament that the people are facing.The superb use of silence in this film really does grip you, and who can forget the scene when the family's house is under siege from gulls, and the sight that faces them when they go outside.Truly freaky!",9,1,1,13 November 2000
High Fidelity," What was the point?
","OK, it's probably not a good move to go and see films when they're based on books written by people you can't stand, such as the annoyingly pretentious Nick Hornby, that most detestable of creatures - a 'trendy' football fan.John Cusack was OK I suppose, other than the lists which annoyed me a lot, the music wasn't bad - but I wouldn't go and see it based on that alone.One to miss.",3,5,11,7 September 2000
"O Brother, Where Art Thou?"," What's this obsession all about?
","There's something about the Coen brothers.  While Fargo and the Big Lebowski were excellent, they seem to have this obsession with symbolism.In the Big Lebowski it was a rug, in this film it's the tin of hair gel. Bizarre.  It got a bit off putting by the end actually.This wasn't as good as some of their other writing accomplishments, but is a well told little tale without ever jumping out at you as being an outstanding film.Clooney is as good as ever, and someone in the theatre was even stupid enough to think that the signing tracks were George himself, D'uh!",7,0,0,22 September 2000
