Resident Evil: Afterlife," Chris and Wesker were the only saving grace
","Wesker was neat before and I would have loved to see him killing Alice.Oh and before I forget, Lets play a game. When you have a group when 2/3 are main characters; who do you think is going to die? BUT they did keep the insane black guy alive....though nearly killing him off. I think they put him in just to say 'Hey, see everyone can jump that high and bad*ss! It not that we God-Moded Alice even when she is supposed to be human again! EVERYONE can do it!'It deserved a one for all intensify purposes; but it did have Wesker beating the sh*t out of Alice....so its propped up to 2. Of course this was before the messed up everything about Wesker and copied an entire fight scene directly from the fifth game.",2,9,20,11 September 2010
