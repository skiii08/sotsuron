Kill Bill: Vol. 2," Bride with the deBill
","Kill Bill 2 isn't just the sequel of the first movie.It stands imperiously as a self-existent creation.Undoubtedly,it's astonishing.Comparing Kill Bill 2 with Pulp Fiction or Reservoir Dogs would be a trap.These movies are traps by themselves. Presumably,Tarantino could make again a Pulp Fiction.Who would blame him?However,seeing that he is an omnipotent director and he hasn't the same power of surprising like 10 years ago,he did his wonder!And his wonder is double,completed in the second movie. This part focus on Tarantino's attention on the perfection of the screenplay,of course always with the presence of his great directing man oeuvres. The union of the story isn't linear but this fact doesn't deprive the viewer of its complete comprehension.The film is embellished with various philosophical monologues and dialogs which prove that Quentin isn't behind in the ample and interesting shading of the characters and this very shading of Bride's enemies is the reason of transforming her revenge into viewer's revenge. This man certainly knows how to direct and it's easy-understanding that when he does it,he enjoys it.I take his influences from the East for granted and they're given in a masterly way.There aren't so many colors as Kill Bill 1,since the logic of the second part is black and white:Bill vs Bride.Also,there's an evident lyrical mood which makes Kill Bill 2 an epic. The core of the film is David Caradine.'Kung-Fu man' is acting explosively in the most cool way and he is starring in 2-3 anthology scenes.What a father!The most interesting character is Pai Mei (Gordon Liu) who gives an East-atmospheric tone in the movie.Hannah and Madsen form firm values,whilst for Uma Thurman words are useless.Uma,will you marry me? Conclusively,in my opinion Kill Bill 2 is something different and it cannot be compared with the past Tarantino's films.Quentin steals and he knows it.However,he steals in a perfect way and he makes movies that he likes first of all.Is there any cult director more rich than Tarantino is?Think about it while you're listening to the marvelous soundtrack.Do you think that Kill Bill 2 will be a classic?It still lies in the womb of time...",8,0,1,30 March 2005
