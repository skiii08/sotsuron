Skyfall," New James Bond is Dead!
","Totally disappointed! This movie just kills the James Bond's character which is built up from Casino Royale. What' a wasted!The story lines are boring and stupid. The machine guns on the car? It's a joke! Are they trying to turn this movie into old school style James Bond film? Please! Don't! The only good part in this movie is: the opening action scene; (but don't compare with last 2 James Bond film) Just wondering why so many action movie have to be happen on the roof top?By the way, ain't Silva's character look familiar with the Joker in The Dark Knight ? It is part of the plan?When that part Sévérine ask James Bond:'What do you know about fear?'James Bond answer: ' All there is.' Then she said: 'Well not like this. Not like him'. Since her character slightly look like Cat Woman in The Dark Knight Rises... I thinks they shall add this quote from the Dark Knight Rises:James Bond: 'What do you know about him?' Sévérine: 'That you should be as afraid of him as I am.'",3,17,36,4 November 2012
Star Trek Into Darkness," It's entertaining with the same old story
","Remake of 1982 Star Trek II: The Wrath of Khan?Sci-fi version of Silent Of The Lamb ?Well, almost the same old stories. I wanna get caught by you, because i wanna use you to fulfill my destiny. Oh! my boss was villain!!Oh! i'm dying; but guess what? I'm alive again!!this and that...etc, sound familiar? Yes, those story already been use by lot of movie.But don't worry, with lot of action scene, this movie won't get you bored, Still very entertaining. Honestly, i quite enjoy this movie.If the Director can cut down his 'Trade-mark light reflection' effect, will be much more better.",8,1,13,15 May 2013
Man of Steel," Is OK only, not that great
","Pleas read it after you watch the movie, Thanks!The story can be told better, if make it more then 2 hours long movie.basically, the story concept is great.(But not the script!) Why he is here, why he wanna hidden his superpower and identity, why he wanna show up as man of steel, and until last part why they call him Superman. Too bad it all ruin up by the Overload CG & fighting scene!Too much of white out on the screen,; and those scene.. er.. i don't know what shall we call it, i just name it 'Poetry scene'. (as we saw in the teaser trailer)The fighting action way too fast, i know the director wanna show how fast Kryptonian can be, but, the movie is for HUMAN to watch, right? Making it so fast... think we can see it?Some CG a bit fake & too much, The fighting part, the background etc.Overall, The movie is just OK for me, (i don't wanna say is 'Good'), because i strongly believe it can be better. So.. Let's look forward to MAN OF STEEL II. See got any improvement or not..;)here are some very personal opinion:Superman I & Superman II - still the best Superman movie.The Dark Knight - still the best superhero movie (or remake movie).300 - still the best movie of Zack SnyderThe Matrix Revolutions - still gain the best 'Fighting in the sky' scene",7,2,14,13 June 2013
