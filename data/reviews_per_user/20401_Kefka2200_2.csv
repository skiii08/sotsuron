Alien 3," The perfect chapter
","Alien 3 is undoubtedly the least appreciated of the four films; it took a complete different path than the others, was more visually enthralling and, to the dismay of the general public, has anything but a Hollywood ending. But is that so bad? Given the circumstances Fincher had to deal with during production, we should be glad anything came of it. While the theatrical version is chopped up and grasps at a complete story, we have to again realize that it was FOX that screwed it up, not Fincher. Furthermore, the extended cut, or assembly cut, included in the box set is almost an entirely different film. It captures more of Fincher's vision and is a complete story. The fact this film is widely regarded as 'abysmal' cements the fact people don't like change, but in reality this film is a breath of originality, beautiful cinematography, and a score to reckon with. I'm not here to convince anyone to like it, rather, Im here to say if you have not seen the extended version, you haven't seen the film period. see it",10,1,8,18 February 2007
Silent Hill," Horror at a new level and Game/movie adaptation at its all-time best
","I cannot begin to say how big a fan I am of this series, and I have been watching the Silent Hill film project for 3 years or so. I was so excited when i saw the first trailer and now it's finally here. I saw it on Friday when it came out and I was more than pleased with what they managed.Christophe Gans knows his Silent Hill. I won't give any great details because I don't want to spoil anything, but just trust me, this is not a Resident Evil...it's good. Keep in mind it's rated R for a reason. It is an intelligent horror/psychological horror movie. It will keep you guessing and leave you with questions at the end, but that's supposed to be that way, trust me. Go with an open mind, and believe me, this is great horror.",10,4,7,25 April 2006
