Skyfall," The Shakespearian Bond
","+ Positives
Beautifully filmed and concisely staged action with some excellent ham from Javiar Bardem. A genuinely moving finale.<ul><li>Negatives</li></ul>The most overrated Bond film by a country mile. By crowding out any high stakes with cartoonish posturing, we're left with a petty retread of the worst bits of The World Is Not Enough (Villain is on a vendetta to kill M). Some terribly contrived plot details stand bare and Thomas Newman's jaunty score wanders into his comfort range.",5,5,7,13 February 2020
