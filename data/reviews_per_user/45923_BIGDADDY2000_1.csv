The Blair Witch Project," OVER HYPED
","I went into this movie thinking that it was going to be the greatest horror film of the season after hearing all the hype,however I did not find this movie remotely frightening. In fact, the ending was such a let down that everyone in the audience (myself included) walked out disgusted.",Null,0,1,1 August 1999
