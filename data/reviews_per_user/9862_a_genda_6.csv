The Legend of Bagger Vance," A consistent Robert Redford film.
","The Good Stuff:The beautiful imagery. Will Smith's sometimes very subdued acting. The always Gorgeous Miss Theron.The Bad Stuff:Bagger Vance portrayed as some sort of ancient stereotype. The melodrama. (Did Charlize Theron HAVE to faint while scattering the ashes?)The Verdict:Manipulative, nice-to-look at, slightly patronizing 'golf-is-like-life', fable/parable.Note that 'Bagger Vance' sounds like Bhagavad (Gita), a part of the epic indian novel Mhabarata in which a god in disguise guides a prince, or something like that.",6,1,5,24 May 2001
Unbreakable," Well rounded, Willis-Shyamalan second collaboration.
","I went to see this movie with mixed feelings, after reading some not-too-good reviews, Was I glad I saw it!Even if the overall look of the picture is dark, it is tolerable and help explain the sadness of Mr. Willis character and his constant wearing of the raincoat.  His never ending melancholy gets explained as well, what I liked best is Samuel L. Jackson's character's line, he says: 'life can't be contained inside a little square box' (or something to that effect), and the next few scenes are shot in a very 'comic book style', with static camera and framing the scenes in 'square boxes', playful and beautiful!The director gave us plenty of clues to the ending, but we didn't use them, I like that.Never mind the people that hated the 'ending' it explains everything and definitely closes the picture.I highly recommend it!",8,0,0,27 December 2000
Pitch Black," Very competent Sci-Fi film
","The Good Stuff:The editor not showing too much stuff to build up the suspense. Complex, 3-dimensional characters. The way we learn that not all the characters are what, at first glance they might seem. The quite realistic crashlanding. Excellent effects! (Richard Riddick's first escape has to be seen, yet it is subtle).The Bad Stuff:The editor not showing too much stuff to build up the suspense. The design of the aliens. The cheesy catchphrase at takeoff. ('We have to say goodbye'.)The Verdict:A most competent film that entertains and keeps you on the edge of the seat and guessing more than once.",6,0,0,24 May 2001
Doctor Zhivago," Confusing History, unforgetable Story...
","The Good stuff:The 'Black & White' images with color at the begining, specially the red star when the workers 'punch out' brilliant! All the big name actors (just one american!). The story's span of about 50 years. The set design, in those days before CGI, they had to drape the far countryside in white plastic to simulate snow!The Bad stuff:The unclear 'disease' of Lara's mother (couldn't elaborate for censorship reasons). The slightly repetitive Jarre music. The too obvious 'plastic' (fake) touches; the falling sunflower petals when Lara leaves, the 'ice castle' (abandoned house sequences), though in those times such resources were quite original and unused. Zhivago's spectator/narrator role, makes him seem too pasive.The Verdict:An ambitious, slightly political, personal, romantic and great film that has aged well.",8,0,1,14 April 2001
The Mummy Returns," NO review, this goes to the 'Goofs' section.
","Much of the story involves a magical pyramid of which it is written, 'No one who has seen it has ever returned alive.' That logically leads us to wonder how they ever found out about it.'Factual error' or 'Error in Geography'When the action returns to London, and we see Tower Bridge, the dome of St. Paul's and Big Ben clustered closely together in one shot. This is no doubt to make it easy for the geographically challenged.Copyright Â© Chicago Sun-Times Inc.(By ROGER EBERT)",Null,0,0,7 May 2001
The Mummy Returns," Goofs.
","Factual errors: Rick, carrying Alex in his arms, is able to outrace the sunrise; we see the line of sunlight moving on the ground right behind them. If the Earth is about 25,000 miles around, and since there are 24 hours in a day, Rick was running approximately 1,041 miles an hour.Factual errors: In London we see Tower Bridge, the dome of St. Paul's and Big Ben clustered closely together in one shot. This is no doubt to make it easy for the geographically challenged.Plot holes: Much of the story involves a magical pyramid of which it is written, 'No one who has seen it has ever returned alive.' That logically leads us to wonder how they ever found out about it.All from Roger Ebert's May 4 review.",Null,0,0,10 May 2001
