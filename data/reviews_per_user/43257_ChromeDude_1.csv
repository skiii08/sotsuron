Mission: Impossible III," Works while in the theater
","This movie is so full of action and moves so quickly from scene to scene that it is hard to be bothered by the problems with it, until after you leave the theater. But I guess that is to be expected from a Tom Cruise movie. They are not 'brainy' flicks.I am beginning to think all he can do as an actor is grimace, show extreme pain and have that Tom Cruise grin. This performance reminded me of his in War of the Worlds.I wonder how much it bothers Philip Seymour Hoffman that Tom will make $100 million from this flick, while he can act circles around Cruise. His performance in this movie was chilling. Even with the little time he had on screen, he stole the spotlight.",6,0,0,16 May 2006
