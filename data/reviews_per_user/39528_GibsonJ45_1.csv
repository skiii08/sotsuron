Marie Antoinette," Good movie for teens
","Reinterpretations of past events/people/plays can be good... e.g. Romeo + Juliet (1996). This file, however, is for the young and impressionable. The film 'looks' great, but it is devoid of wit and good dialogue (which made the French ancien regime, if pathetic, at least fun). Nobody has anything to say in this film. Why must so many new re-interpretive films lack good dialogue? (like Pride and Prejudice, 2005) Like the world in which we live live, that which is serious and compelling is reduced to a music video or magazine advertisement.This film lasts too long and has nothing to say. If you're a vapid teen, you'll love this film because there nothing to THINK about... but there's loads to LOOK at.",3,2,3,19 October 2007
