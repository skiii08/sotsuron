The Blair Witch Project," Who's afraid of the Blair Witch? Not me
","'The Blair Witch Project' gives nothing to the audience but motion sickness. One walks into the theater expecting an refreshing, original, independent film. What is dished out, however, is a cross between a slasher movie and bad ghost stories from camp in the 7th grade. I must admit that the format was an interesting idea, and was almost executed well. The movie gets off to a good start with the interviews with the local population. However, once the students go into the woods the film quickly degrades into a an episode of Friday the 13th. Also, the movie confuses the audience as well as itself by focusing the interviews and the background information largely on the legend of the witch who lives in the forest, but than actualy plays-out another, half-mentioned legend concerning a hermit in those same woods. Over all 'The Blair Witch Project' was an idea that could have produced some fruit but instead died on the vine. The acting, overall, was decent and I would like see these kids in well written movie.",5,0,2,22 February 2000
