The Ring," Liked it a lot!
","Finally went and saw it after a friend said it was good. I was not disappointed. The movie is intense and keeps you thinking. The theater was very quiet. I haven't seen the original, but would like to. I would see it again and will buy it when the dvd comes out.",Null,0,0,22 October 2002
