Minority Report," Very clever in every respect.
","There's something for everyone here. Excellent special effects, good acting, good-looking men and women and the (albeit lightweight) addressing of an ethical dilemma. The script is well thought out with a delicate sprinkling of twists - enough to keep us on our toes without overwhelming us. All in all - it might just be the best film I've seen in 2002.",9,0,0,15 August 2002
Resident Evil," Nice special effects. Not much else.
","Hmmmmm. The idea is a bit corny but if only they had kept the information until the end, it might have been a good film. In the end we get an action-packed but brainless effort where the endless parade of mutilated and bloodied monsters chasing scantily clad heroines down corridors and up stairs becomes just plain tedious.",4,0,1,15 August 2002
Amélie," My favourite film of 2001.
","This film is a delight from start to finish. I cannot recall any other film where the cinema audience laughed so often in unison. If you need cheering up, watch Le Fabuleux destin d'Amélie Poulain. It will keep you smiling for days afterwards.",9,0,1,15 August 2002
