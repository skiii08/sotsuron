Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," I challenge the critics...
","I have no objection to critics hating movies that I like, as long as they have good arguments. I have yet to hear a bad review that brings up any good points. They say 'there isn't any love story,' Bull! Much like the first installment of the other trilogy, the first chapter just sets one up. Anakin and Queen Amidala's scenes together point it in the right direction. Second, all the critics say 'The plot is paper thin.' Yeah, so, the original 'Star Wars' movies weren't exactly 'Citizen Kane.' Everyone is entitled to his or her own opinion, but these critics ought to go back to the film schools they failed out of. I, like every other fan who LOVED this film, think that no matter what would have happened in this movie, the reviews would have been terrible. Reviewers, for the most part, just like to see big movies fail. Don't even get me started on the critics who are upset because Anakin didn't start to turn evil yet. (That kills the credibility of anyone who says it). Now I'll get off my soap box and actually give a few thoughts on the film. Lloyd, Nieson, and Portman were all good. Ewan Mcgregor stole the show, though. He really is a promising young actor. The effects, and trust me I usually hate computerized effects, are seemless. Finally, to keep this review brief, the little bit of foreshadowing at the end was magnificent. I can't wait until Episode II.   Also, I was glad to see Roger Ebert liked it. Cheers to him, and the handful of critics who resisted the temptation to pan this film.",10,0,0,22 May 1999
Jerry Maguire," A shameless attempt to make a buck, but still good!
","Has there ever been a movie that was cooked up for money more than Jerry Maguire? Can't you just hear the producers at the company: 'We need money, let's make a romantic comedy. Put in Tom Cruise and a cute kid and women will line up around the block. Add a sports theme, with real pro athletes and announcers, men will be more than happy to go also. Throw in a Bruce Springsteen song and we have a license to print money!!' But, in spite of all this, the movie was still pretty good. The story is true, agents are ruining sports. The romantic side of the story wasn't bad either. See, commercialism isn't always bad!",7,1,4,25 July 1999
Evil Dead II," Best movie with no plot ever made!
","Even though the 'plot' in Evil Dead 2 is just a weak patchwork to tie gags together, it is still a classic. Why? Because its so d*mn funny, that's why. Definitely the best movie in a great three part series.",10,1,1,21 December 1998
