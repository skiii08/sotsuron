Blade Runner 2049," A Brilliant Sequel
",The landscape that they create in Los Angeles is stunning and mesmerizing to watch on the big screen. What I really liked about the movie was the sort of 80's looking futuristic technology that carried over from the first movie. They don't try to over dazzle you with action and it presents itself at the right times. A very very good movie and I would pay to see it twice in the theaters.,9,1,7,19 October 2017
