Airlift," Pretty Decent But not Spectacular !!
","The Movie only appeals in parts, that's it! It begins superbly, but 30-minutes into the film,the pace drops & blame for this drop goes to Writing.Also,The first-hour moves on a slow- pace.The second-hour picks up momentum & fares better in comparison.But overall, 'Airlift' is a great opportunity lost.The Writing needed to be stronger & more urgent.Songs Are totally out of context & badly misplaced to make it fit for typical viewers in Indian cinema.They could have made the scene better when Indian Air force airlifted Thousands of people from Oman.The scene when Iraqi army attacked Kuwait was also look ordinary. Akshay Kumar is Fantabulous as Ranjit Katyal & Nimraut Kaur as Amrita is OK.As my first full fledged review on IMDb i will go with 7 out of 10 for this movie.A feel Good Patrotic Movie but certainly not extraordinary as ratings suggests.",7,1,7,25 January 2016
