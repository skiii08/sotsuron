Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," Awesome! How could anyone NOT like Jar Jar?
","I flew over to the States last week to catch The Phantom Menace, which won't open here until July 2. It was totally worth it! Got to see it three times, and I can't wait to see it again. Repeat viewings are definitely a must to fully appreciate the complex plot, especially the political intrigue that takes place behind the scenes, unnoticed by the Jedi Knights. Also, it's the first live-action film with several computer-generated characters (Jar Jar Binks, Boss Nass, Watto), which previously had only been seen in animated movies (Toy Story, Antz, A Bug's Life). Definitely a milestone in film history!",10,0,0,28 May 1999
