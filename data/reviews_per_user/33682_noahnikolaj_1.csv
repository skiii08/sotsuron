Blade Runner 2049," A visual dream
","With great camera work and pretty scenes, colors and acting that takes you into the world of Blade Runner. This movie is stunning to look at but packs a deep story with deep characters. The Movie can get little hard to follow especially if you missed a part. All around a great movie that is fully packed plot twists.",8,0,10,2 January 2020
