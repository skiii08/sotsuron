Skyfall," Stupid, stupid, stupid.
","There are spoilers from the start – the point of a negative review like this is to save you wasting your time on something you may not enjoy and in order to explain why the plot doesn't work, I have to say what it is. Here's a thumbnail. Bond has a little mishap, decides to take some time off (for no reason we're ever told) then later sees MI6 under attack and returns, but (for no reason we're ever told) unable to shoot straight or pass any test for suitability as an agent. Of course he's put straight back into the field and helps an international terrorist achieve his goal of killing M. Pretty stupid, right? Fine, it's only Bond, so am I taking it too seriously? Well, if the plot doesn't matter, what remains of those wonderful Connery films? Bond dallying with gorgeous women? – nope, a couple of women have tiny parts, and JB doesn't lay a finger on either of them. Fun gadgets? – nope, apparently we've got rid of those too. A clever screenplay, based on a brilliantly witty Fleming novel? – nope, since we ran out of novels, we don't seem to bother much about the repartee any more. Great, or at least adequate, acting performances? – nope, Dan Craig used to be able to act (didn't he?) but recently just struts about trying to be Vin Diesel with face perpetually set into a hard-man grimace, Bardem is stupidly OTT at all times, and even the wonderful Dame Judi doesn't seem to care much any more – and with a plot and screenplay like this, who can blame her? All we're left with is a lot of running around, shooting and missing, and explosions. A gazillion cheap B-movies have all of this and plenty of them have better plots, acting and screenplays too.Just to return to the stupidity – the movie's defining feature. With the bad guy in his sights, stranded on a ladder, why does Bond not shoot him, instead talking about nothing much until the guy dumps a tube-train on his head? Stupid. When the bad guy gives his gun to M, imploring her to kill them both with the same bullet, why doesn't she just shoot him? Stupid. When they escape via a secret passage to the middle of a midnight moor, why do they wave a flashlight around so the bad guy knows where they are? You guessed it – stupid. Why does the bad guy 'want to be captured' so he can escape and launch a terrorist attack, why not just launch the attack? Clichéed and stupid. And the acme of stupidity. A nasty terrorist wants to kill M. Oh dear, whatever shall we do? I know! – let's take her to a remote Scottish country house. Let's make sure no-one but the terrorist (along with his small army of thugs equipped with helicopters, explosives and high-tech weaponry) knows where she is. Let's defend her only with a washed up agent who can't shoot straight, and an old gamekeeper type, the two of them armed with nothing much at all. Then, when she's unsurprisingly killed, let's say well done to Mr B (whose moronic idea all this was) and line him up for further doubtless equally stupid sequels.How stupid does this stuff have to get before people stop liking it? How much more stupid is it in fact possible to get? I appreciate that people do like movies of this type, especially if money's been spent to make them look glossy, as it has here, but if making some kind of sense is important to you, better avoid this.",2,6,9,23 July 2016
Ready Player One," 150 minutes watching people play computer games. Seriously.
","What's the point in leaving a review when there are already a couple of thousand out there? Well, this has a very high rating, I guess most of those reviews are positive, and I'd like to register a little warning for anyone looking for one.In a grim future dominated by a single online game, the game's creator has hidden a huge real-world prize, with clues to find it. That idea is good, but nothing else is, and even this brings a problem, placing all the action inside the game - there are hardly any real-world scenes. Therefore the viewer spends 2.5 precious hours watching other people play computer games in which the worst that can happen is 'game over'. Serious gamers would surely sooner be playing than watching this.There are references to gaming history, but far more to film and other aspects of pop culture, most of them very dated, and possibly tedious for younger viewers. OK, we all know Millennium Falcon, but how many people know what 'Valley Forge from Silent Running' is?So what's so bad? Everything. There's no plot beyond the idea itself. It's way way too long for something with no plot. The characters are boring, partly because the acting is poor across the board, especially bad-guy Ben Mendelsohn who sleepwalks through. The original score is horrible, loud and intrusive. The dialogue is flat, dull and rarely funny. The direction is patchy with long sequences of sheer tedium. The FX, which dominate the movie, are same old same old, with nothing to surprise. And finally: in this future world where, supposedly, everyone plays this game, how come the adventure features a bunch of guys (with one token, fashionably feisty woman serving as love-interest) versus, you guessed it, a bunch of guys (with one token black-leather clad woman in a tiny part, presumably for the benefit of male viewers who like women in black leather)? A third female does emerge late on as a kind of (hugely predictable) joke/surprise in an even tinier part, but basically this is sexist crap for no reason.Spielberg has made good films but it's been a long while. I haven't seen all his work, and wouldn't want to, but this surely must be the worst. Maybe he should go back to WW2 so he wouldn't have to bother with female characters at all.",1,6,9,29 November 2019
28 Days Later...," Run of the mill zombie flick.
","British attempt at a 'scientific' zombie flick. A virus takes '10-15 seconds' to transform victims into raging biting speeded-up zombies. There's nothing original here, the plot never quite makes sense, and the actions of the standard group of survivors never come close: at one point they destroy the zombies with Molotov cocktails and a triggered explosion which takes out a city block, a bit later they have only a machete and a baseball bat and they never bother to even look for more effective weapons. But the whole thing is reasonably staged and reasonably acted. Minor spoilers follow.This is an OK piece of mindless entertainment  apart from the treatment of the female lead, who starts the movie as a tough, resourceful survivor, efficiently killing an infected companion before he can become a threat. By the end she has unaccountably become a frightened girlie, making no resistance as she's dragged around by a nasty man, just waiting for a (previously feeble) nicer one to rescue her. There's nothing new in reducing strong female characters to props for some hero-type's emerging macho-linity, but the message here is: when society breaks down (as it so often does in so many parts of the world) forget being tough and resourceful, girls, go find a man to protect you. Outdated, hard to take and just very silly.",4,6,10,10 June 2007
"Girl, Interrupted"," THE definitive nuthouse film
","This film is very similar to One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest, inevitably, as it's almost entirely set in a mental hospital, at roughly the same time, in this case the late '60s. Cuckoo's Nest was a great film, but, though flawed, this all-female version based on a true story is better. This review contains spoilers, but only of a general nature.The plot, concerning a young woman who commits herself following a failed suicide attempt, and is 'cured' more through contact with the other inmates than the rather hapless attempts of staff to help her, is more connected and purposeful than that of Cuckoo's Nest. The supporting cast of inmates here are real people with real backstories, rather than twitching Christopher Lloyds, leering weirdos and silent Indian giants.The acting is what sets this film apart though. Winona Rider's low-key Susanna is easily a match for Nicholson's McMurphy and Fletcher's Big Nurse, and she's ably supported by a super-straight Whoopi Goldberg (as a nurse) and an interestingly odd Vanessa Redgrave (as the head doctor). But this film is all about the stunning performance by Angelina Jolie, proving that truly great acting sometimes does win Oscars (she got Best Supporting Actress). As the ward's sociopathic 'top dog', Lisa, Jolie flits from the vulnerable and charming to the terrifyingly pitiless, conveying more with half a glance than others can through whole speeches. This is one of the great acting performances of cinema history, all the more astounding as this actor, though always competent, has never produced anything near this level elsewhere. Not to be missed.There wasn't much about the film I didn't like, but the ending left me feeling dissatisfied. The message almost seems to be that Lisa is the problem and the hospital, however ineffectual, is a kind of solution. In fact Lisa is just as much a victim of the barbaric practices (electric shock therapy, lobotomy, etc) used in psychiatry in those days as McMurphy, but, while we can hate the system that destroys McMurphy - a powerful element of the final payoff in Cuckoo's Nest - it's not so easy here. All the hospital staff, despite varying degrees of competence, are uniformly pleasant and well-meaning, and it's harder to hate a system that contains no hint of any villain. This is a true story of course. I'm not sure how closely the film follows the book, but the truth was that many psychiatric staff in those days were honestly applying damaging treatments which they believed were helping their patients. With the human mind still largely unknown territory, this still happens today.Though this lack of a villain to hate detracts from the power of the film's conclusion, the brilliantly acted cast of real people with real problems ensures that this is in fact the definitive nuthouse film.",Null,4,5,28 April 2003
Sicario," Pathetic irresponsible misogynist slander
","Usually I'd start with an assessment of the various aspects, acting (generally fine) screenplay (perfectly serviceable) plot (works in places, nonsense in others) etc., etc., but for one particular reason no-one should worry about any of that, nor watch this film nor encourage in any way the irresponsible idiots who made it.The theme concerns the extreme violence employed by people running the Mexican drug-cartels and suggests that extreme measures, going beyond not only the law but normal decency, may be required to combat them. I don't have a problem with that, and it is left for the viewer to decide whether measures such as facilitating the murder of innocent children can be justified if it may be the only way to defeat these malicious, brutal, ruthless and amoral enemies. I hope and presume most would think not.It is conceivable that an experienced FBI agent, drafted in to add a veneer of legitimacy to illegal CIA operations of this kind, could find themselves out of their depth. The problem arises because this agent is a woman, while all the people involved in the operations on the CIA side are men, and because of the way the movie then treats this woman. At the start she is shown as functioning well in a demanding job (specialising in storming hostile locations to rescue hostages). However, after joining the operation, she becomes entirely ineffective: every physical confrontation leaves her defeated and humiliated and every time she takes positive action, usually to try to temper the excesses of the CIA and their hired thugs, it always fails. Having achieved nothing throughout the operation, she fails even in her determination to expose the illegality. In the final scene, the nastiest of the thugs taunts and humiliates her yet again, ('You look like a little girl when you're afraid') as he terrorises her into signing a declaration that all procedures were correctly followed. She is left apparently broken and abject, advised to find a safe small town where she can function, since she isn't tough enough for this real world.Of course it may be a coincidence that a female character was used for this role and no other in the film. But that's about as likely as the squadron of wild boars doing aerobatics outside my window as I write. This movie has a second message and a far less ambiguous one, none other than the old misogynist lie that women cannot handle various roles, fire-fighters, infantry, whatever, and that when things get tough, they will fail before the men. Any actress who would accept a part which carries such a message should be ashamed of herself, and shame on all concerned for turning out something as despicable as an online misogynist hate-post. If this was done unintentionally, these people are irresponsible and foolish beyond belief, and whether their crime is idiocy or slander, it is equally damaging. Nowadays women work on many extreme front lines in law enforcement, the military, security services and so on. Reinforcing and thereby perpetuating these old misogynist lies can only undermine them and could possibly place them in harm's way.If you hate women, enjoy seeing them humiliated, or believe their proper place is in the kitchen, then, who knows, you may well love this movie. If you are a reasonable human being who celebrates what women have achieved, then stay very well clear.",1,12,23,20 December 2016
Casino Royale," Bond gone far off the rails
","I've never been a big fan of Bond and haven't bothered with it much since Connery, but I heard this was good so I took a look. What is good here is the mega-budget, making everything look expensive, the sustained production values – and, as always, Dame Judi. But in terms of acting, script and everything else Dan Craig wanders about, face set into an unchanging hard-man mask, showing nothing of his undoubted acting ability, and the support, Dench apart, aren't much better. The story, at least in the early part of the film, consists entirely of running about and shooting. When fifteen straight minutes of jumping around on top of cranes gave way to an apparently endless gun-battle (all for no explained reason) my attention wandered and I never really managed to get it back.This film clearly thinks it's very gritty and cool, and some seem to agree, perhaps because it says Bond on the label. But the story is too ridiculous for grittiness. In fact it's an expensive but mediocre attempt at an action flick, po-faced throughout, with no hint of the style and wit which established and once defined this most successful of series. For Fleming's great creation to be reduced to sub-Willis-Diesel nonsense, without even the benefit of a Willis or a Diesel, is tragic.",4,6,9,24 September 2009
Kingsman: The Secret Service," Silly, sexist and annoying
","OK, this isn't entirely awful. Much of the acting is OK, Sam L is typically amusing and quirky and Firth isn't bad as a poor man's John Steed, though the main character's attempt at cocky assurance mixed with chip-on-shoulder inferiority (I think that's what he's trying for) is more irritating than anything. Pacing is fine – it keeps moving right along. The blades are a great idea and Boutara wears them well, though it would've been cooler to cast a real paralympian in the role, and why not as hardly any acting was involved. I've heard worse screenplays, though it could have been a lot funnier. It's better than the latest Bond movies, but then, what isn't? However it's extremely annoying for two reasons.First it's very silly. Some of those who liked the film suggest it is parody and therefore is entitled and indeed expected to be silly. Depends what you mean by parody though, the definition: 'an imitation of something with deliberate exaggeration for comic effect'. That could well involve silliness, but this isn't hugely exaggerated compared with the stuff it's supposed to be parodying, and it's never that funny, apart from a couple of Sam L's lines. Both The Avengers (I mean the 60s UK TV show, not Downey Jr & pals, though this also applies to them) and the old Bond movies, extensively referred to here, are funnier than this without being considered either parodies or comedies. Silly on its own is not funny, especially when too many tough-guy movies intended to be taken seriously, involve the same kind of silliness. Example: this cliché that some guy can defeat large numbers of supposedly tough and trained enemies by leaping around in the middle of them in silly ways (see John Wick, The Equaliser and a million others), hinges on one thing only – the supposedly trained enemies cannot manage to shoot him from five yards away. Breathing round a toilet bend in a flooded room is not funny, it's stupid. Breaking glass thick enough to hold the pressure of ten feet of water with an underwater punch is not funny, it's stupid. Austin Powers is parody. Coburn's Flint is parody. Doing silly unfunny things a million other movies have done, or unfunny things so stupid no-one else would ever do them, is not parody, it's copying and idiocy respectively.Second reason. It's deeply sexist because: they are kings-MEN; the essence of their approach is to be John-Steed-gentleman imitations (no idea why they don't wear bowlers but at least the umbrellas have survived); all existing kingsmen were male; even when a female becomes one she is given a male name.It probably thinks it isn't sexist because: the most (in fact only) effective bad-guy is female; it allows women to try out to be kingsmen; one of them wins the try-out, beating out our male hero.But it is really because: even olde-worlde patriarchal sexism has never had a problem with either female villains or demonisation of women in general, going back to Morgan le Fay (to keep up the Arthurian parallel) it's female heroes sexism can't cope with; while Roxy is winning the try-out, she's the only one to be shown whining, 'I can't do this,' and to need helping out by our male hero; though Roxy is the qualified kingsman and our male hero is not, he gets the all-important gentleman's suit, while they didn't bother to make her one; she's subsequently sidelined on a stupid pointless mission, which she completes but still achieves almost nothing; while our male hero is defeating all the bad guys single-handed in the usual silly way, she is falling to earth and floundering around in the snow. Can't they give the only qualified female kingsman even a support role in the mayhem? Of course not. They just want her out of the way so our male hero looks bigger and badder.More than half a century ago, the UK Avengers was one of the earliest action series to depict female agents (Cathy Gale, Emma Peel) as equal to their male counterparts in every way including the physical. It's rather pathetic that this wholly inferior ripoff has gone back past the 50s to Neanderthal times – and I doubt the reason is even misogyny, more likely ignorant carelessness.Just very annoying. 3/10 is generous.",3,3,7,20 December 2016
