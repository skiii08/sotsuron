Whip It," Rolling Right Along
","Meet Bliss Cavendar (Ellen Page), 17, a student at suburban Bodeen HS. Her mother Brooke Cavendar (Marcia Gay Harden) is pushing her into the round of beauty pageants. At a petite 5'1' she's hardly the hostess model type in an evening gown that wins the bouquet of roses even if her inclinations were in that direction. On a chance visit to Austin, Bliss meets up with some tough chicks in roller derby who tell her she has to be her own type of hero. With old Barbie doll skates recovered from the attic, Bliss tries out for the team. Size and speed work in her favour for a change. Now on the team Bliss begins a secret life as a roller derby star under the handle 'Babe Ruthless.' What will happen when her two life paths collide. The film is a sensitive coming of age film revealing the essential conflict between parent's ambitions for children and young adults pulling away. There are excellent scenes on the skating floor.",8,1,5,25 November 2010
Walk the Line," The JC legacy
","I did like Johnny Cash and his music and I did enjoy this bio-pic which focused on JC's divorce, recovery from addiction and second marriage to June Carter. I was disappointed that the JC story omitted a significant part of JC's career: his friendship with Richard Nixon which catapulted JC out of regional country western onto the rock and roll stations and the mainstream pop chart.Politics do blend interesting harmonies.JC's WELFARE CADDALLAC made JC a favorite at the Nixon white House where JC was often invited. Long before the fall of Nixon, Cash and Nixon parted ways when Cash started singing tunes with a more liberal flavor.This aspect of the JC legacy was entirely ignored in the story. Yet I find it the most interesting facet of Cash's career.There is one item I do note. Frankly the alleged controversy over Cash's Huntsville concert. JC is supposedly told by his manager that his church going audience would not approve of a prison concert.Regrettably much of the stories about Christians are written by other who do not understand them. Christianity was founded by a prisoner who walked the line.",7,1,2,5 May 2007
Stop-Loss," An Incomprable Journey: from Hero to Fugative
","Military Clerk: You have orders to report to the First Brigade. Brandon King: Not me, I'm getting' out today.Military Clerk: You leave on the 22nd, shipping back to Iraq. You've been Stop-Lossed. Brandon King: With the shortage of guys and no draft, they're shipping back soldiers who's supposed to be getting' out. Senator Orton Worrell: Your country needs you to go back. You know it's the right thing to do.Brandon King: Sir, I've always done the right thing. And this is wrong. Stop Loss is the incomparable journey of SSG Brandon King from Irak back home to Texas. Scenes from Irak alternate between young adult hi-jinx and bloody firefights with Haji, the locals who would send the US packing notwithstanding President Bush's dramatic declaration of victory aboard the USS Kennedy (not shown in this film) and Toby Keith's song sung off key by the GIs during respite from conflict. As cheerful as they are, even baptizing themselves in a curious mixture of Catholic and Pentacostal rites. the last fire fight with Haji takes out half the platoon and destroys all its equipment.Back Home there's a parade and medals. After receiving a paltry Bronze Star, SSG King renders the type of rambling, disjointed speech many veterans might give to feather merchants (US civilians). Superiors upbraid him for not pitching recruiting. What does King care? He's getting out!Boy does he have a surprise in store for him when Colonel 'Boot' (Timothy Olyphant)wants to send him back yonder. 'But President Bush says we won the war,' protests SSG King.This is the type of movie true supporters of the war might not like to see: the wards of amputees, the crazed survivors and the blood stained bodies of enemy civilians caught in cross-fire between the Hajis and US forces..",9,5,12,1 April 2008
The Birth of a Nation," Not The Birth of a nation
","I have seen Birth of a Nation twice. I had heard whispers about it and the racist filmmaker DW Griffiths for many years. In my youth the film was let us say politely a little too far to the right to be shown on TV's Big Show: the PM movie that came on after school.Perhaps the first feature film Birth of a Nation tracks two families separated by the faction they supported in the Civil War. There are fantastic battle scenes of Sheridan's advance through the Shenandoah valley. And of course had DW Griffiths ended the movie with the Rebel collapse and reconciliation of the opposing factions, this film would be regarded as a masterpiece. Regrettably DW continued the story into reconstruction and presented an extreme Southronist version.In fairness to DW it must have seemed to the Southernors who rebelled to guarantee the continuation of the peculiar institution that the world had turned upside down when Southron arms failed and the fate of the Lost Cause was sealed. The Democratic president the Southern carpetbagger to New Jersey Woodrow Wilson agreed and called this film 'History written with electricity.' By all accounts the film was out of step even in the times it was issued.The film deserves a **** 1 **** and should be consigned to the deep.The defeat of the South in 1865 was not the birth of the nation. The nation was already 89 years old in 1865. If there is any tears to be shed for lost films they all belong to Robert Goldstein who produced the suppressed film The Spirit of 76, about the true Birth of the Nation.",1,10,23,14 May 2006
Amistad," Hidden American History
","The Armistad case was one of the points along the road to Civil War that has been consistently overlooked. This film focuses primarily on the trial to determine the right to own certain persons said to be chattels. Taken in the British protectorate of Sierra Leone, the Armistad prisoners mutinied. Eventually brought to shore by the US Navy, the trial was in theory a contest between a US Naval officer who asserted the right of salvage and the Spanish title owners. Brought to trial in New Haven, mutineers were determined to have been free persons justifiably rebelling against their captors.When the Spaniards appealed to the US Supreme Court dominated by Southernors sympathetic to slavery, John Quincy Adams played by Anthony Hopkins delivered an eloquent Fath of Our fathers speech which swayed the court to grant release.The film addresses an important facet of American History too readily ignored even by careful students of American history. One of the commentators claimed never to have read anything of the armstad incident in years of reading American History; I confess to having first come across the story in the french language.",9,0,1,8 July 2007
We Were Soldiers," Gary Owens Sir!
","War is Icky 'War is icky!' exclaimed a US super-patriot who flaunts a UNITED WE STAND T-Shirt and drives a car plastered with US emblems. He hasn't volunteered in the current emergency to do anything other than act as a billboard. Over twenty-five years later, that sums up the general US sentiment. Even in the conservative ex-urbs far removed from the effete centres of banality and liberal thought, the Vietnam War remains such a sore topic that it is hard to make a movie salable to general audiences. Despite the top line billing of Mel Gibson, WE WERE SOLDIERS sadly opened to empty movie theatres here in Eastern Long Island. The tough knot of veterans stayed home. Having seen the live staged action, they had enough. The newcomers to US patriotism, singing songs, spouting slogans and flying banners didn't come to the movie either. Too gory and violent, they said. The Vietnam War is a tough topic to handle for cinematography. Unlike other wars fought by soldiers who were required to see it through, the Vietnam War was fought by replacements thrown together. Most units lacked any cohesion. The Army refused to use its trained leadership; instead leadership fell to whoever was around and available, constantly changing. Even on a political level, the agenda and objectives remained ephemeral. The Man and the Moment WE WERE SOLDIERS does not try to tell the whole story. It focuses on one battle in a valley in Western South Vietnam fought by the GARY OWENS BRIGADE, 1st Battalion, 7th Cavalry Regiment, 1st Cavalry Division, against a purported North Vietnamese Division in the early part of the war 1965. The story does not begin in battle but in training of the Air Cavalry inside the US in a training programme designed to adjust Cavalry tactics to the age of the helicopter. The choice for command is LTC Hal Moore (Mel Gibson). Mel excels in the part assuming the persona of Hal Moore right down to the staccotic Army accent.The name for the new fighting force is the GARY OWENS Brigade, famed for having been wiped out in combat with the Sioux Indians. However as deployment is implemented the President decides against declaring an emergency which will freeze enlistments. Thus the battalion goes into action at about half strength without adequate intelligence as to enemy strengths and dispositions. Colonel Moore is a mountain of a man willing to make every sacrifice and endure every hardship. However the movie subtly details the obstacles the Colonel faces. No one speaks Vietnamese other than a South Vietnamese Ranger seen briefly interrogating a captive. No one knows enemy strengths. No one except seemingly Colonel Moore knows that the Viet Minh defeated the French in approximately the same location and under similar conditions. Everything about the proposed operation is thrown together. There aren't enough choppers to carry the whole attacking force in one swoop. The first wave will have to wait almost an hour for backup. A Moment To Reflect There is a moment to reflect as the troops board the steel mounts for combat. The breeze of the swishing rotors hides a Gaelic War Cry blending the furies into song. How is it that Gaelic melodies so easily lend themselves to War? The engagement itself breaches a canon of strategy: never plan an attack without securing your staging area. The landing zone (LZ) is quickly overrun by enemy forces compelling Colonel Moore to improvise another site. As battle is joined Higher Headquarters waffles. The brass even General Westmoreland want to recall Moore the trained tactician and to send in a brevetted replacement. Moore ignores the order and fights on with the men. Certainly the vignette explains the many brevetted commissions from that war. Were other real life commanders as faithful to the unit and to the men as the story makes claim for Colonel Moore? Who can be sure? Fighting is toe-to-toe and nose-to-nose. A napalm strike hits US forces. Ultimate success in a temporal sense is won for the Americans who by the touch of a feather put the Viet Cong to flight. The cost to the US is frightful. Nearly half the Gary Owens brigade and almost all of its officers except Colonel Moore have been killed. General DeGaulle, then President of France, remarked caustically, Americans have learned little from our mistakes. But with all the victories of Vietnam, though the field is won, it is quickly evacuated and left to the enemy. Madeleine Stowe plays Julie Moore, the Colonel's wife, to whom the dirtiest task of the war has been left by the Army, that of informing nearly all other officers' wives of husbands' death in combat. If Veterans stayed away having first hand knowledge of the cost of war, this movie would be a good one for those whose patriotism is newly found in the politically correct response to current emergencies.",9,4,7,26 May 2007
Empire of the Sun," Coming Of Age in Perilous Times
","Meet Jaime (Christian Bale) an English boy, 13 year old son of a British Tai Pan growing up in the British zone in Singapore on the eve of the outbreak of WW II in the Pacific theatre. The British are showing a stiff upper lip. They've even dressed up for an early Christmas party at the country club. Just out of sight the Japanese are nerved up readying themselves for war.In the confusion of the Japanese incursion on the British concession in Singapore Jaime becomes separated from his parents and is separately interned with British and American civilians.In the movie version his substitute father is the American comparadorBasie (John Malkovich). Jaime becomes the adopted American Jim. And the American barracks are a tale of two cities. Where the English preserve the pretenses to an affected gentiility in soiled clothes and dire circumstances, the Americans make a big joke of it all. The American barracks are one big party. Even the raid by the USAAF on the nearby airstrip is like a wild cowboy and indian attack.The American promises to run away with Jim. Will he?The movie enlarges the role of the American Bassie from the book version at the expense of the Japanese substitute father Jim acquires. The movie version does more graphically display the death of innocence. How? see the movie!",9,0,2,20 July 2004
Forrest Gump," The Empire of Wishful thinking
","Every liberal ought to see this movie and have their faith restored in America. Forrest Gump starts running after kicking off his braces left from a polio infection and never stops. His task is to overcome his borderline IQ, 75, just below the edge of normalcy and his trek takes him on a course through the Vietnam Era, the war, the unrest and the post - Vietnam malaise.This is an excellent movie for a liberal to reinforce the twin pillars of liberalism: (a) universal guilt shared by all except liberals and (b)moral superiority of liberalism.On such sublime matters, Forrest Gump however is clueless. He thinks of the Vietnam War as a long walk in the jungle and he's waiting on a check for 'the million dollar wound' that got him out of the combat zone. He visits the White House to receive a medal and inadvertently addresses a peace rally the same day.He never loses sight of his objective his true love Jenny who has turned away from values of any kind and embraced the drug culture of the Vietnam era. As much as Forrest is guilty of living in wishful thinking so too are the admirers of this movie.As I see our liberal friends watching this with moist eyes, they're living in the delusion that just somewhere there must be legions of young men like Bubba and Forrest ready to go over yonder as clueless as Forrest.I gave this film a '3' because I did enjoy the liberal world's perception of people on the outside of its snobbish feeling of moral superiority.",3,1,14,1 January 2008
The Village," is separation from everyday life more of a state of mind?
","We have faced the enemy and find it to be ourselves.The movie thrusts you into the apparent tranquility of a remote ante-bellum 19th century Pennsylvania village. The villagers are celebrating a communal feast and then you hear it the howl from the woods just outside the clearing. Exactly what forces of darkness are out there in the forrest that make the villagers avoid the color red and use a beigish-tan as a protected color.The movie spirals into the nature of the threat and the secret past identity of the elders, the adult villagers.The film is well recommended for its occasional cinematical brilliance in moments of tension, fear and surprise, but I think errs on one point, very perilously close to its central premise: If one transported 21st century people back to the tranquility of an era of good feeling prior to the civil war, wouldn't they be 21st century people in costume transplanted anti-modernists rather than 19th century people? Think on it.",6,0,0,18 December 2005
Cold Mountain," An American Odysseus from Penelope's Perspective
","I hesitated to see Cold Mountain. I figured it for a heroic tragedy from an officially sanctioned Southron viewpoint in the vein of Gone With the Wind. But to my pleasant surprise Cold Mountain was very different anti-heroic and anti-war to the point that I'm surprised top see that the Bush administration allowed it in the theatres. Perhaps Cheney left no instructions.Cold Wind is an ant's eye view of the Civil War's impact on the Carolina Highlanders, an everyday in the life of story of the frightening last days of the Confederacy. The Highland lads have been dragged off to fight for slaves they did not have. Many included Inman (Jude Law) have become disillusioned and have deserted the Lost Cause. Rebel officialdom has branded them traitors and ordered them hunted down and shot or returned to the crumbling front lines breaking under the pressure of Yankee raiders.Back home genteel Ada (Nicole Kidman) sits on her front porch reading books as she pines away awaiting Inman's return and as the farm goes to seed. Wooed by an offensive, murderous member of the home guard, Ada is content to live off the generosity of neighbors who have little to spare. There is only hope for Inman's return; no word has been heard; postal service has deteriorated from sporadic to non-existent. Outside of die-hards in the Home-Guard freed from service at the front, most locals are praying for the cause to be lost and the end of the war.Enter roughneck Ruby (Eileen Aikens) who forces Ada off her pedestal into the real world of living off the sweat of the brow and brings the farm back to productivity. Ruby came from a family dysfunctional even for its times and despite her hatred of her Pa, she saves him from capture by the Home Guard. Ruby says of the men who planned the war being lost that 'They go out into a thunderstorm; stand there till they're drenched and all they can say is 'Sh - - it's raining.''Inman's Homeward Odyssey is laden with traps: sirens, the home guard and yankee raiders.Will Ada and Inman survive the tempest? See the film which is steeped in the local color and Keltic styled music of the Highlands.",9,2,3,13 July 2005
The Alamo," Billy Bob Thorton: An Introspective US Rep David Crockett
","I liked this version of The Alamo as much as I liked all previous ones, Last Command, The Alamo (John Wayne Version), Alamo (made for TV) and Gone to Texas. The story of how the Texians annexed the US and detached Mexico is one of bravery and courage of both Texians and Texicanos against a superior force. This version does introduce a more introspective David Crockett in the form of comic actor Billy Bob Thorton who captures much of the real David Crockett's humor in irony and introspection. David Crockett in the Billy Bob Thorton interpretation is more a captive of his public image than the Mexican forces surrounding the Alamo.All the US versions since Last Command have treated the Mexican view in an honorable manner. This particular version adopts the Mexican account that Crockett survived the battle but was executed thereafter.The failure of this version was in the inability to explain clearly Jim Bowies' personal devastation and in its neglect of the heroine of the Alamo legend Mrs Susan Dickenson who knitted the Texian flag in Mexican colors with the legend 1824 for the --- gasp --- liberal ---gasp --- constitution that Santa Ana usurped.",8,5,7,5 February 2006
Judgment at Nuremberg," Final Judgement on The Reich
","The big shots have already been hanged or have committed suicide when Chief Judge Dan Haywood (Spencer Tracy) a political hanger-on who just lost an election back home is sent as a political reward for party loyalty to occupied Germany to help mop up some of the remaining cogs in the Nazi system, more particularly, Dr. Ernst Janning, a former German judge now defendant in the War Crimes Tribunals for Crimes Against humanity. There is considerable doubt about Janning's guilt; many of Janning's decisions as a judge were no different than those made by similar authorities in the US.Judge Haywood approaches Janning with a degree of fascination. Janning was no avid Nazi but a man of intellect and distinction.What is the responsibility of a man of integrity in a world gone mad?In occupied Germany, the Germans still bristle with hatred and resentment to their American conquerors, but the hatred is not quite so white hot as once was. The new Germany or at least West Germany would like to join the Western powers. Certainly a political figure like Judge Haywood is not immune to the pull to render a decision motivated by a spirit of reconciliation but one which integrity cannot sustain.The movie is a classic for having presented this inner conflict through multiple levels of ironies and without preaching.",8,4,5,7 May 2006
The Battle of Algiers," Paix du Brave (Peace of the Brave)
","Fredrich Engels the Communist theoretician once said that so many factors shape an event that what emerges is something no one might have expected. PBS replayed last night the Algerian made fast paced movie The Battle of Algers, a docudrama of the Algerian struggle for independence, released shortly after the event in 1965 when the right saw the Algerian war as a communist inspired take over and the left saw it as a struggle for national liberation. True to Engle's axiom neither was correct. What emerged was the phenomena of Arab or Islamic nationalism, the most recent product of which left a big crater in NYC; former Russian communists also do battle with this phenomena. Hedonistic liberals enchanted with national liberation in 1962 need not sit back in self satisfaction; today the phenomena hates liberalism more than it ever did colonialism.The tactics of the Algerians would be recognised instantaneously to the casual reader of war news from Irak. Indeed President Bush might have been well advised to have studied the movie carefully before embarking on his wars in Afghanistan and Irak.The movie takes an Algerian perspective but is fair to French Colonel Mathieu whose tactics put down FLN's uprising. Torture scenes were cut from the film in US showings to preserve the sensibilities of the weaklings in the US audiences; a real American ought to be able to eat oily, buttered popcorn during such scenes.The film skirts France's waffling on the commitment to continued war, the OAS (Organisation d'Armee Secret) coup in Algeria in conjunction with the pied noir (French residing in Algeria) and the plebiscite which led to the Peace of the Brave, a French withdrawal.In many respects French President General de Gaulle accurately predicted the future Irak war when in another context, he said, 'americans learn nothing from France's mistakes.'With the war going so badly in Irak, I'm surprised the Regime allowed this to be shown.Comparable films include LOST BATTALION starring Anthony Quinn.",7,0,1,26 August 2007
Disturbia," Rear window redone poorly
","Philip Wagner editor of the literary magazine ICONOCLAST quotes Ezra Pound for the proposition that literature should say something new and different. American cinema has violated this injunction repeatedly. Someone ought to tell Hollywood imitation is the insincerest form of ignominy.Disturbia is a poor attempt at remaking the Alfred Hitchcock tale Rear Window. Change the reason for remaining indoors from a broken leg to house arrest, add a cute girl in a skimpy swim suit and make the murderer a psychotic mass murderer who does not particularly hide his victim's bodies but rather keeps them for trophies and there you have disturbia.David Morse of St Elsewhere fame departs his usual good guy image to play Mr. Turner, the superficially but persuasively reasonable neighbor. Morse's performance was eloquent by comparison to the flat and tinny lead.Jose Pablo Cantillo plays the cameo role of a minor character Officer Gutierrez with great skill and bearing.The performance of Jose Pablo Cantillo and David Morse saved the film from a lower rating.",4,3,8,6 May 2007
The Patriot," Mel Gibson : The Patriot Under Fire
","Recently George W Bush shocked a sedate audience in the White House by thanking Queen Elizabeth II for the assistance the British gave in celebrating American independence back in 1776. The shock on Her Majesty's face and the stunned awe that spread over the gathering tell it all. Mr Bush maybe a little short on his history: the American Revolution was a grisly spectacle which lasted eight full years until the last of the Red Coats departed.The story of the seminal event still rankles Merry Olde. When this film was released as Mel Gibson's magnum opus, the English couldn't keep a stiff upper lip. The Independence Day the epic The Patriot, was scorned as 'Gratuitously anti-British' and a Hollywood vision of 'excessive violence is all too real,' Brits say Mel Gibson emerged from playing the Scottish rebel Wallace as a stock anti-British character. Seemingly all the sneering, smirking, evil villains speak the Kings English. Certainly, The Patriot's considerable emotional force stems from sheer rage, an unforgiving anger, but as the story opens Mel's character Benjamin Martin was hardly a rabid patriot. As a South Carolina legislator Martin joins a small block which opposes independence, warning of the tremendous military power Britain can bring to bear. Martin's frightening prophesy of the war coming home comes true; the Palmetto flag is replaced by the Union Jack when the colonial capitol of South Carolina falls to the British. Even so Benjamin Martin might have been content to have sat out the war on his farms perfecting his woodworking skills until atrocities force Martin who to arms. The struggle devolves into a personal feud with a surly British Colonel Tavington whose nasty deeds would make him an able accomplice of PFC Lynndie England, supposed ringleader of US warders at Abu Grave.Are the British entitled to cry foul?The Patriot to some extent tracks the struggle between British Colonel Tarleton and American Francis Marion for control of the Carolinas. The Patriot's Colonel Tavington is based on the very real life exploits of Colonel Banastre 'The Butcher' Tarleton. Dubbed 'Bloody Benny' Tarleton's slaughter of surrendering American cavalry at the Waxhaws made him one of the most feared Brish officers. The historical Banaster Tarleton is a complex character,,, Yet Tarleton the defender of the monarchy was no aristocrat but of the same general merchant class that supported the revolution Excesses sometimes cow an enemy ; sometimes they encourage resistance,,, Tarleton certainly scared off many faint of heart, but what remained behind to fight him in the swamps and forests were uniquely determined to fire off a few shots melt away and send The Scarlet Wonder Tarleton charging aimlessly about looking for a vanished enemy already in position for its next ambush Yet British critics are correct in one sense. The historical 'Swamp Fox' Francis Marion who in the William Cullen Bryant poem sent a shiver to the timbers of the British foeman with his very name, discouraged personal feud. There was none of the in-your face repartees. Contact with the British was so distant that Marion's sword rusted into his scabbard. This core message about the origins of the Republic, however is its historical roots in real-time, real-place communities. As far as the violence, this was a Revolution chock full of it. The Revolution by no means was a series of parades, speeches and declaration. The Revolution was a violent, divisive event which divided all classes and races. To Mel's credit, The Patriot makes an interesting point concerning the soldiers of the Revolution. They were good men recruited in church, as well as denizens of the taverns. Some were slaves enlisted by masters. The Revolution divided all classes and races. Some American Blacks fought for the British; some for the Americans. On the American side some were enrolled by their masters or tagged along with them, some were recruited and promised freedom and some were just counted as white.",10,0,3,12 May 2007

Seabiscuit," good horse sense
","Seabiscuit is three stories in one: the biography of his owner, a short history of the US depression and recovery and the pedigree of the horse. Though slow and plodding at times in its knockoff of the 1949 version, the movie gives great insight into the never-say-die spirit that once infected the country (and certainly is utterly lacking these days) and good social comment on the rise of the parvenue West and its rivalry with the staid East. Good show Mr Howard who persuaded the white shoes at Pimlico to open the infield to the average Joe and Jane. Rich and poor alike should have had in the pre-OTB days equal opportunity to lose money gambling. I never thought much of any of the Bridges as actors but Mr Bridges renders a marvelous performance.

The Lives of Others," THE DDR: Utopia for Dick Cheney
","Welcome to East Germany (DDR) in the 40th year of Communist rule right before the fall of the Berlin wall.Meet Georg Dreyman (Sebastian Koch) he's East Germany's most accomplished playwright deemed loyal to the Regime. Komrad Dreyman is so loyal he has been befriended by the Communist Dictator Honnicker and especially Honnicker's wife. Dreyman has produced a play entitled Other People's Lives which centers around a character who has The Second Sight, the ability to see and feel events happening at a distance. His gal-pal Christa-Maria Sieland (Martina Gedeck) who plays the leading role on the stark East German stage has attracted the attention of the Dick Cheney-ish Minister of Culture Kamarad (Herr) Minister Bruno Hempf (Thomas Thieme).Official interest is not purely artistic. The Cheney look-alike Komrad Minister would like to unload Dreyman to win Christa. He calls on Stassi. Anyone that loyal has to be hiding something.Stassi is overjoyed at the opportunity. Oberstleutnant (LTC) Anton Grubitz (Ulrich Tukur) thinks Stassi is about to take down a member of the Politburo (cabinet). The mission is entrusted to Hauptmann (Capt)Gerd Wiesler (Ulrich Mühe), a hardboiled instructor in Stassi's spy school. In the process of intensive surveillance Hauptmann Wiesler starts to read books he steals from Dreyman's apartment and in a bemused mood deletes adverse information from surveillance reports.Can Wiesler save Drayman and Frau Sieland or will the caprices of the totalitarian state swallow Dreyman and Frau Sieland? The story skillfully told with multiple layers of ironies is a stark warning to Patriot Act America. How can people like you lead a country? Dreyman would ask Minister Bruno Hempf Dreyman does get that opportunity. In a revival of the play Other People's Lives staged with more pizazz in wealthy united German after the fall of the wall, Dreyman meets the former minister displaced by the dissolution of the East German State.",9,1,2,23 July 2007
K-19: The Widowmaker," The challenge of command
","The conflict prophesied by de Tocqueville between the US and USSR (Russia) runs to the roots of European civilization: authoritarian Sparta vs democratic Athens, eclectic heterodox Rome vs baroque Byzantium, middle class revolution vs working class revolution, the same theme bobs in and out of European history popping up in different form.In the evolution of the conflict spoken of in this movie, the shields and swords have been replaced by thermonuclear weapons and USSR faces some tense moments in the arms race. They've developed a nuclear sub which Mr K has given the Red Navy but who shall command? There is Capt Mikhail Polenin (Liam Neeson). Mikhail is all Navy and worshiped by the men. The Soviet admiralty's concern is that he's a little too much in league with the men and won't take the right risks. Higher headquarters decides to supersede Capt Polenin with Captain Alexei Vostrikov (Harrison Ford) who has better standing in the political apparatus and is more daring. 'Without me,' Capt Vostrikov tells the crew, 'you are nothing; without you I am nothing.' Though Captain Polenin professes that the change does not concern him, 'It's never difficult to do one's duty,' Polenin tells Captain Vostrikov, the tension between hard charging, mission oriented Vostrikov and the plodder, crew oriented Polenin always hovering near the surface, explodes when Vostrikov brings the vessel from crush depth to break through the polar ice in seconds.The real test of strength is just over the horizon. Like American vessels fitted with poor equipment to serve political ends, the Soviets have skimped not a bit on valves and dials. Can the democratic leader Polenin work with the autocratic leader Vostrikov to save the vessel? The film is interesting for presenting the essential contradiction, or dialectic to take a liberty with the Soviet political lexicon, in command. Leadership has two faces: one which argues for the men and the other for the mission. Before he had any idea of what this meant, Captain Vostrikov correctly said this on the ship's dedication. Only few films compare to the magnificence with which the conflict between different styles of leadership: Twelve O'Clock High, Major Dundee and the Godfather.",9,0,2,18 June 2006
"Girl, Interrupted"," a haunting movie
","It would be hard to say this is a story of a descent into hades like say SNAKE PIT or some of the mental hospital films of the 1940s or 50s. Susanna Kaysen (Winona Ryder) is not really insane nor is she truly suicidal. In reality she is just a little morose.Her unwillingness to go to college suggests to her upper middle class parents a serious psychological disorder. Since she comes from an upper middle class status conscious family which finds her late adolescent problems upsetting, the rule is where there's money there's treatment and a convenient label. In Susanna Kaysen's case the label becomes BORDERLINE PERSONALITY DISORDER.The hospital is a farce. It's borderline between being a holding pen for well connected young woman and a joy camp. The Doctor supposedly treating her sleeps during psycho-theraphy. There's kindly Val the nurse who's more of a Super-Mom babysitter for wealthy girls. Meanwhile at night the girls can have the run of the facility as soon as they drug up the night nurse and send her off to sleep. Notwithstanding locks and bars, little toughie Lisa Rowe can escape whenever she wants.Val is the first to tell Susanna to grow up.The characters on the ward are interesting: little toughie Lisa Rowe (Angelina Jolie) who bullies the other patients around, wishy-washy Daisy Randone (Brittany Murphy) whose insecurities toughie Lisa knows how to probe; Polly 'Torch' Clark (Elisabeth Moss) and assorted others who just don't want to grow up.Susanna Kaysen keeps a diary in which she's keeping book on her co-inmates. Can she survive to tell the tale or will the hospital destroy her.The film is interesting for its period: 1968. The girls are seen huddled around the TV listening to Chet Huntley announcing the grim news of the assassination of Dr Martin L King. Yet there are slight historical lapses: the draft lottery that caught Sussana's boyfriend wasn't started until 1970 or 1971 when Nixon was President. In 1968 LBJ still President that year was still playing catch as catch can with men eligible for the draft.Yet the film did catch some of the flavor of the 1960s, girls hair styles and clothes excepting Sussana's date from that period. Winona Ryder did exude that occasionally less than subtle upper-middle class racism when addressing Val the nurse.There is a poignant scene where Susanna meets up with life having passed her by while she was on ice in the looney bin. On a walkabout with the ward and nurse Val off grounds, Susanna meets a high school friend who went to Sara Lawrence University and then on to The Sorbonne.",8,1,1,7 January 2007
From Hell," Hell Knows its Own
","Dateline: 1888, the London, slum of Whitechapel. Harassed by thugs and pimps, streetwalkers Mary Kelly (Heather Graham) and her companions meet daily misery until their friend Ann (Poppy Rogers) whose marriage to a budding artist (Mark Dexter) has rescued her and her daughter from the mean streets is mysteriously kidnapped in broad daylight and prostitutes disappear in a series of gruesome murders. To ferret out the fiend who delights in gore, Police officials summon Inspector Fred Abberline, (Johnny Depp) a brilliant though erratic detective lost in the haze of cocaine addiction hiding from his terrifying psychic ability on one hand and the recent loss of his wife on the other. The film's focus on the infamous Jack the Ripper caper of Victorian times cuts an exciting murder mystery with just the right number of hints to keep the breathless pace compelling at every turn through the twisted back alleys of Whitechapel. Depp gives an other worldly performance entirely appropriate to the subject matter. Ian Holm, Katrin Cartlidge, Robbie Coltrane and Ian Richardson recreate change of century London in a dark though not totally depressing tone. As Abberline becomes immersed in the case, he is aided by a retired physician (Ian Holm) whose hands are no longer steady enough to hold the knife. At the same time, the recently widowed Abberline is falling in love with Mary. To lift the London fog, Abberline frames an interesting hypothesis. His nemesis Jack the Ripper might have been crazy, but still acted logically in his own perverted way to be sure but for purpose larger than killing social undesirables, a handful of expendable prostitutes. But as Abberline breaks through the slippery cordon of roadblocks put in his way, Whitechappel becomes more perilous for Abberline, Mary, and the other girls. Will Satan dance in delight or will Abberline turn back the minions of evil to Hell from whence they came? The Gates of Hell The ripper has overshadowed his competitors for gruesome honor because of his methodical MO: delightfully dissecting his victims with the care worthy of a devoted physician. That the Ripper operated with impunity in the heart of the world's most crowded city of the era and that high police officials ordered destruction of evidence suggests the protection of an highly placed person, the Crown Prince perhaps? Did a wealthy fraternity with influence in the higher levels of power in the police and the ministries of the baroque world empire shield the culprit? Very well shot with stylish backdrops lending a Gothic, creepy touch, From Hell is based on a comprehensive novel by Alan Moore. Directors excelled in attention to period detail and costuming. They may not have been the first to see a royal cabal. But the murders ended when the Crown Prince disappeared from public view into a sanitarium. WHO WERE THE FREEMASONS? Could Lucifer in concert with bedlam have devised a more fiendish plot? The Freemasons have been the villains of many versions of the Ripper Saga. From Hell is extraordinarily candid in portraying supposed Masonic rituals. Yet their role in From Hell is ambivalent. Was a rogue Knight Templar implicated in the Ripper caper? Did the brotherhood punish him for the atrocity itself or for failure in attaining the ultimate goal? The Masons will never say. The Freemasons in the 18th and 19th centuries saw the flowering of their fraternity not only in reactionary Britain but in Republican France, Italy and the United States and even in the Austro-Hungarian Holy Roman Empire. Masons included princes and presidents, police and military officials as well as common tradesmen. Masons were noteworthy figures not only in politics, both democratic and reactionary as well as the arts, sciences and literature. They promoted public education, endowed hospitals and performed acts of charity and benevolence in a time when public and private charity was regarded as fostering excessive growth of a dependent class. As a matter of policy, Masons neither take nor seek credit for their good works nor rebut their critics.",9,3,5,4 August 2007
War of the Worlds," H G WELL'S WAR OF THE WORLDS Emmigrates to America
","I wasn't much impressed with this version of War of The Worlds. Did it live up to HG Well's original? I don't think so.HG Wells must be recognized as one of the founders of SciFi and futurism. Writing at the height of the British Imperium in 1898, HG Wells posited the unthinkable a direct attack on the peace and order of the world at its pulsating heart: London with an almost unbeatable foe.But of course while it might be unimaginable that invincible Britain could be beaten, war drums had spread in the Sudan in 1880s and the mighty British Lion would seem to have met its match in Mahdist rebels. Not to worry, the Mahdist rebels though they took Khartom in 1885 and killed the hero of the Imperium General Gordon, succumbed to a plague left from unburied dead in the wake of their rampage through Khartoom.Hence the genus of the idea from War of the Worlds put out in 1898 when the last of the Mahdists were being put down: the seemingly indestructible Mahdist enemy wiped out in a plague.This movie is called HG Well's War of The worlds. A certain liberality was indulged here when Well's story migrated in this movie to American shores. There are stock American characters such as the bratty kid who'll act up in the car when absolute obedience and immediate compliance is required. I suggest in such circumstances a more direct approach than reason and understanding if undertaken in the proper dosage might prove more efficacious.Then there are the extras the 10th Mountain Division whose badly needed manpower and equipment could have been used elsewhere in the US struggle against the spiritual successors to the Mahdists were devoted to cinematography instead, no doubt to demonstrate the firepower and resources of the current Imperium. The 10th was shown in full retreat, retiring ominously in disorder. When one sends a message out, one best ponder what message might be transmitted. The two might not be the same.For all the special effects, the movie dragged. I gave it a *** 5 ***.",5,0,0,14 August 2005
Downfall," Gotterdammerung : the Reich on the pyre
","Adolph Hitler has accumulated more film reals than even the worst of his rivals. We can ask which is your favourite Hitler movie? We could not say the same for FDR, Churchill or Hitler's equally brutal nemeses the dictator Joseph Stallin.This version carefully tracks the Historical accounts rendered by reputable historians Trevor-Roper and John Toland. And we have two prior films specifically dealing with Hitler's demise and the collapse of the Reich: Last Days and The Bunker which follow the same general line. However some in recent years have questioned whether this account is correct.Some say the account given us is far too heroic, a tale shaped into a Wagnerian epic. I suppose we'll never know what really occurred in the Bunker but the performance of Bruno Gantz as Hitler was grand eloquent. I'm sorry I know only a smattering of Deutch insufficient to follow the dialogue without sub-titles but Ganz does not read lines they echo off his face. One needs no sub-titles when he acts.None of the versions of the Untergang (literally Going Under) talk of Hitler's double, found by the Russians stuffed in a chimney in the Reich Chancellery Garden.

The Last King of Scotland," The Operating Theatre of Power
","The Last King of Scotland brings us back 40 years, a time when real news still was carried in US newspapers.Nicholas Garrigan (James McAvoy) is a freshly minted MD ready to go out and conquer the world. Rather than take up with his father in practice in relatively tranquil Scotland, he goes on an adventure to Uganda, a newly independent African country formerly in the British Empire. Garrigan might have spent his time in a rural clinic unnoticed but fate puts him in tight with Uganda's new dictator Idi Amin (Forest Whitaker) who has recently seized power. Amin brings Garrigan to the capitol Kampala where Garragan is installed as Presidential physician and best friend to a lonely ruler.With a touch of self - deceptive innocence, Garrigan plays the neophyte walking in the shadow of the perilous backstage to power. Garrigan enters the operating theatre of power with a detached bemusement of the spectator at a play. And Idi Amin is one for creating good theatre with his antics.Can the attraction of the glamor of the power, prestige and privileges blind Garrigan to the brutality of the dictatorship he serves? Certainly aspects of Idi Amin's rule, like that of George W Bush would have been comic if it were not for the cost in lives.Forest Whitaker rendered a bravura performance as the paranoid dictator, capturing both Amin's exhilerance for power and love of the the theatre of power.",8,3,4,28 January 2007
The Green Mile," Good and Evil Meet on Death Row
","Mel produced THE PASSION and was hated by many in may quarters for it; King wrote the same story to general acclaim.Green Mile is narrated by Paul Edgecomb (Tom Hanks) recalling his days as a prison guard on death row escorting the condemned down the last mile. in Edgecomb's facility this is called the Green Mile. there are three prisoners awaiting the hot seat, a psychotic killer who delights in impish, sadistic maliciousness as he weaves in and out of catatonia, the confused Cajun and John Coffey. Coffey is a convicted killer with extraordinary powers complimented by childlike gentleness, despite his imposing size and physical strength. He is described by his captors as a wonder of nature and a gift of God.Though impressed with Coffey's demonstrated talents, Edgecomb and the crew decide that Coffey must walk the mile, simply because they can't figure out anything else to do with him. Coffey is too childlike to escape.The movie version of Green Mile though it attains near perfection in story telling, fails to grasp only one aspect of the King novel on which it is based: the erratic and occasionally contradictory flow of Edgecomb's (played in twilight years by Dabbs Greer) recollection.

At points the book and the movie hint at that classical collision of values worthy of an Ibsen or an Arthur Miller in An Enemy of the People: the needs of the community to make a living as opposed to the potential hazards they are creating. The film and the book upon which it is based approach but do not attain a ranking with the classics.Near tragedy for the mayor's son persuades the mayor to hire the real shark hunter.Thus ends the conflict of values in Part I and begins Part II The Fish hunting story of three men against the smartest and strongest that ever swam.Can they beat the Great White?

Says the director:Christof: We've become bored with watching actors give us phony emotions. We are tired of pyrotechnics and special effects.

300," Recycling the Myth
","When the Greek writers composed the original version of King Leonidas' stand at Thermoply, Athens and Sparta were locked in a deadly internectine war. The Greek writers recollected upon a time when Athens the Great Democracy stood together with Sparta the Great Autocracy and saved Greece from the Great King of Persia. Greek writers were careful however in treating with the enemy extolling the Persian warriors for their courage in battle.The original version of this film was released when US and USSR, former allies in World War II, the Great Patriotic War, were deadlocked in struggle for the mastery of the world. the deadly duel between Athens and Sparta was often used as a simile for the conflict between former allies. Why couldn't they work together as before might have been the hidden question.Today the USSR is gone and the US now a debtor nation is hardly the industrial or military giant it once was. Where once the plains thundered with US troops in an army of millions, President Bush can barely raise an army equal in size to that of Switzerland.Every civilisation in stress returns to its happier moments. Here we see the Greeks representing the cause of Western Civilisation fending off the hoards of Asia. We can savour the courage of the Greek Alamo, as a sop for US impotence.The author of the updated version did not do honor to the Greeks who scribed the original tale. I don't believe Herodotus described Xerxes as a pervert. I believe Herodotus claimed that Xerxes' proclamation to the Greek City States before embarking on war was conciliatory in nature. Xerxes even claimed to be an Acadian, IE Greek. Herodotus also extolled the virtue of the Persian immortals who shoot the bow straight, ride in formation and always tell the truth.The film made perverts out of the Persians and imported part of the Hanibal legend into the tale.Yet I gave the film an 8 as the story deserves to be told and the character of Leonidas is true to that which history credits.",8,3,5,5 June 2007
Gangs of New York," New York's Five Points: The Gate to Hell : America Born In The Streets
","Five Points: The 19th-Century New York City Neighborhood That Invented Tap Dance, Stole Elections, and Became The World's Most Notorious Slum Boss Tweed: The appearance of law must be upheld at all times! Especially when it is being broken. Welcome to the Five Points, New York City's wretched slum along the East River. Across its mean streets battle lines are forming. It's 1836; on one side of the street stands Priest Vallon (the mountebank Liam Neeson) with Celtic Cross in hand; on the other stands William Cutler (Daniel Day Lewis) the local butcher and 'civic leader' of the down and out Nativist faction. Growling and sneering speeches precede the brutal work of the day, the battle for control of the Five Points. The battle ground is Paradise Park at the heart of The Five Points in lower Manhattan, officially named the Sixth Ward, the 'Bloody Auld Sixth,' where there was at least one grog shop for every six people. Most immigrant Irish and the poor native neighbors rarely sat in anybody's pew though religion ostensibly was the point of contention between the inhabitants of the ill-light rickety next to slaughter houses, stables and breweries. In the first battle, the Nativists prove the strongest. The heaviest wave of Irish immigration is yet in the future. Setting the Irish to flight and killing Priest Vallon in the fray, Cutler's henchmen capture the priest's son and commit him to a Protestant orphanage on Blackwell's Island. The Gangs of New York: An Informal History of the Underworld Bill Cutler as diabolically violent as he is does have an interesting tale to tell as he drapes himself in the American flag. The orphaned son of an American soldier killed in a British massacre Cutler despises the British and their affected American counterparts even more than he hates the Irish. Cutler has many insults for the Irish but his main complaint with them is that they have cheapened the value of American labor. Cutler is the stuff from which Labor leaders in a generation then yet to be born were cut from. Cutler boasts that he closes his hand on the Five Points like a bloody fists. Democratic politicians kowtow to Cutler: Cutler delivers the votes that keep the venial, corrupt Democrats in power. Daniel Day-Lewis slices up an electrifying, overpowering performance in his role as Bill the Butcher Cutler. His manner, accent and handlebar mustache topped by a stove pipe hat capture the lower class New Yorker of his time. Yet, though grey has not cropped into Cutler's mutton-chop sideburns, time is marching on aging Cutler. Amsterdam Vallon (Leonardo DiCapria) is coming of age. Released from custody, Amesterdam tosses the parting gift The Bible in the River as he marches home to the Points. He's out for vengeance but first he serves a stint as Cutler's henchman until his identity is unveiled. The twisted Cutler might have liked have to acknowledged Amsterdam as a son. 'I never had a son,' says Cutler. A Hollywood ending was not in store. Leo DiCapria rendered a magnificent performance as the American born son of the Irish priest. DiCapria variance between the New York accent and an affected pseudo-Irish one might have unintentionally caught Amsterdam's difficulty in deciding which side he belonged to. In the end, Amsterdam's decision is made for him when he is pushed out of Cutler's natives after a betrayal by a friend. A new Argamenon is slated; the opponents face each other across Paradise Square. The final battle is disrupted by a barrage from a ship in the harbor aimed at the draft riot nearby. This film has all the makings of the great cinematic masterpiece. Camera work recreates the historical setting. The film's touches of multiple overlaying ironies are worthy of a Shakespearian tragedy. The corrupt democrats, the rigged elections, the raging Civil War and the New York uprising against the draft in the backdrop add depth to an understanding of the period.",10,0,2,4 August 2007
Braveheart," The Gospel According to Mel
","It's the late 13th century. Scotland suffers under the brutal occupation personified in the evil King Edward I whom American born Irish actor Patrick McGoohan plays with a diabolic frenzy, the very embodiment of iniquity. 'The problem with Scotland?' Edward I muses aloud, 'The Scots live there!' Among the many outrages is the institution of Prima Nocte. Defeated and dispirited, the Scots argue best with each other. The line of Scottish kings has been broken. The claimant to the throne Robert The Bruce lacks the support of the nobles, many of whom were paid off by King Edward. How can such a nation bitterly divided against itself produce a hero? Heroes come by strange twists of fate. In the confusion, William Wallace in a fit of rage renders a powerful reprisal to the occupier. Mel Gibson lends all his charisma and charm to the the title role.Where the defiant Wallace urges revolution, the timorous Scottish nobility busy with wealth and titles have no interest in Freedom and Country. The noblemen try to sucker Wallace himself with the meaningless compliment 'guardian and high protector of Scotland.' Wallace pleads with the pretender to the vacant throne, The Earl of Bruce to bypass the corrupt nobility and make his case directly to the people: 'The people would follow you, if you would only lead them.' The Bruce who would succeed to the Throne may be ambivalent but Wallace does have a significant loyal following nonetheless. Brendan Gleeson later to play the dysfunctional father Stobrod Thewes in a different highlands in Cold Mountain brings strength and humor to his role as the robust swordsman Hamish Cambell. David O'Hara brings up the rear with comic relief as the crazed Irishman who threw in with The Cause. Brilliant in the director's chair, Mel Gibson captured the intrinsic beauty of the Scottish highlands while as an actor Mel at the same time took on the heroic character of a great warrior adding to the dour Scot a breezy Lochinvar charm raising the élan of warriors steadying themselves for battle with the unforgettable battle cry 'Alba gu bragh!' The battle scenes are frantically staged, spilling a bit too much gore in the horror and brutality of massed hand-to-hand combat for an overly sensitive US - er audience functioning with intestinal fortitude on a par with the wicked King Edward's namby pamby son of whom the evil king says: 'Who shall I sent to negotiate with this Wallace? Not my gentle son, his appearance would only encourage an enemy to take over the entire country.' Yet if Wallace's purpose is to free Scotland under its rightful native ruler Robert The Bruce, in the tangled weave of factionalism, Wallace may have become the stumbling block in The Bruce's rise to power. The movie is about Wallace but the Bruce is by far the more interesting and complex character. Angus Macfadyen born Glasgow, Scotland plays the enigmatic Bruce, ambitious yet cautious and ever duplicit. Certainly The Bruce's battle-plan at Bannochburn, not far from Fallkirk but on better terrain for the unarmored Scottish troops, was nothing short of magnificent. However, Bannochburn and with it Scottish independence was yet in a distant future, when King Edward I marched on Scotland. Upon the English attack, The Bruce stands next to the demon Longshanks himself whom the Scotts condemn as a pagan. Keltophiles for seven centuries have tried to rationalize The Bruce's choice of friends at Fallkirk. This film politely adopts a version of the legend which attributes The Bruce's treachery to the machinations of the leper David, Robert The Bruce's father. Unstated in this movie is the more likely premise that for The Bruce to gain the throne Wallace must be die. Later at Bannockburn, this movie does show The Bruce to be stroking his elbow guards embossed with the lion of Scotland with the gritty uneasiness of a newly minted butter bar lieutenant. Perhaps the explanation is simple: it takes more than a patriot to be a great leader, it take a bit of a devil. However in the earlier battle at nearly the same spot, Bruce forgoes Wallace's invitation to lead the Scottish Kingdom. When Edward I invades to restore English rule, The Bruce stands with the enemy at Fallkirk Bridge. There is an important historical lapse in Mel's otherwise brilliant cinematography of the apocalyptic battle at Fallkirk Bridge. Mel decided against shooting at the original site because the bridge would get in the way. 'Ay,' agreed a local sidewalk superintendent, 'So too, the English found....' Defeated after a spirited battle at Fallkirk Bridge, Wallace takes to the Highlands to re-stir the resistance. Betrayed on his way to a meeting with The Bruce, Wallace is taken to England to be hung drawn and quartered for treason. On the gallows, Wallace echoes that blood chilling scream: 'Freeeeedom.' A tale of love, freedom and national pride, Braveheart uses a gentle Celtic score as a haunting counterpoint to the blood and gore. The movie ends with The Bruce throwing Wallace's sword at the English at Bannockburn, but the story of the fight for Independence had an even more dramatic ending in the The Declaration of Arbroath 1320 in which the Scots renounced not merely England but divine right as well in the chilling words:. 'For, as long as but a hundred of us remain alive, never will we on any conditions be brought under English rule.' The line did run fallow and Scotts would be humbled at Colladen some four hundred years later, ending the independence of their kingdom until Mel revived it in 1996.",9,2,4,9 February 2007

Atonement," Atonement or Bragging?
","Atonement is a brilliant adaptation for the screen of Ian McEwan's World War II dark, mis-casted romance of Robey Turner (James McAvoy) and 'C' Tallis (Keira Knightley). The division of Christopher Hampton's brilliant screenplay into three principal parts, first set pre-war on an English country manor, then four years later in the midst of the disaster at Dunkirk, and then 60 years later in post-war Britain follows in the main the direction of McEwan's popular novel. It avoids the oppressive ennui of the first 50 pages of the McEwan novel by focusing directly on the major theme of the work, the misinterpretation of an adult event seen through immature teenage eyes. To emphasize the point, Christopher Hampton uses a technique that violates the cardinal rule of story telling employing a multiple perspective on a particular scene. The first part of the screenplay faithfully follows the book without venturing into the book's tedium.The matriarch of the Estate, suffering in the summer heat from a migraine, laments that warm weather leads to immoral conduct. Age 13, Briony Tallis, 'C's' teenage sister, is particularly attentive. Having caught the servant's son Robey and her patrician sister in 'fond embrace' in the Manor's library, Briony has persuaded herself that Robey is a sex maniac. When she spies her 16 year old cousin Lola Quincey (Juno Temple) out in the bushes with guest Paul Marshall (Benedict Cumberbatch), Briony cries rape and accuses Robey. Out of convenience or indifference, the elite prosecute Robey who is whisked off the prison with 'C' crying 'Come back to me.'Part II of the movie is fairly faithful to the book. Indeed in Part II, the action in the book becomes somewhat lively and interesting. Flash ahead four years, Robey is out of stir in the fire of battle on the continent with the 'John Bull' type Tommy Nettles (Daniel Mays)and the colonial sergeant Frank Mace (Nonso Anozie). Nettles complains 'give the Jerries the continent; the French hate us anyway. Lets keep our Empire.' Robey promises a kindly French farmer that the British will return. The Colonial emblematic for what was to come drifts away.Rescued from Dunkirk, Robey reunites with 'C.' Briony tearfully promises to atone, to set the record straight. Is this a formula Hollywood ending?Flash ahead 40 years to Part III for the surprise which is delivered with a bang. The ending differs from the book. The movie ending is well played and short, but one wonders whether Briony is atoning or bragging.The book's ending is more drawn out and leaves a different question most subtly: Did Briony make the whole thing up?The story is typically English with the long time gaps. I might have thought Robey's trial and conviction too interesting to leave out.",8,0,2,25 December 2010
The Island," A Sick Future As Planned By Dick Cheney
","I liked the movie but there is a long drag with the high speed chase through LA in a future of sparkling technological novelties. The chase actually becomes boring. However the concept of the movie is excellent, the mad scientist (Djimon Hounsou) Albert Laurent raising clones for replacement parts and creating an imaginary world wherein they await the service they would render.The imaginary world is the Island, the last unpolluted spot left on earth. The clones await their turn to be called to the Island through a lottery.That (Ewan McGregor)Lincoln Six Echo and (Scarlett Johansson) Jordan Two Delta would eventually outsmart Laurant and his system is consistent with human nature. The fall of any autocrat comes from taking a big clomp on the Big Lie he preaches.I won't spoil the ending but I'm not sure that conforms with my understanding of human nature. If you destroy an entire population's belief structure too quickly might they not take defencive measures to preserve it?",4,1,3,14 August 2005
The Godfather," An American Masterpiece: An Offer You Cannot Refuse
","Based on Mario Puzzo's book, The Godfather translated to the screen is an American masterpiece in the study of management and command. As a serious film it is one of the few American films which rises above syrupy American romantic comedy.Meet Vito Corleone (Marlin Brando). He's a self made American gangster who came up biting and crawling. The American mob however is different from its Sicilian progenitor racked with such vendetta driven violence that whole cities are decimated. The American offspring is a business. Wars (going to the mattresses) happen according to one character only every 10 years and then only to flush the trash out of the ranks, almost a statement one might expect to hear from a career military man.Don Vito wants to make his second son Michael (Al Pacino), a war hero into a real American of culture, rank, and distinction. Third Son Sonny (James Caan)will head the mob. Elder Son Fredo (John Cazale)is a dolt the others will have to look after. Adopted son, a non-Italian, Tom Hagan (Robert Duval) slides through a shadowy zone of near legitimacy as an attorney for the mob.War strikes. Rival gangsters want to sell drugs. The Don is firm but is almost assassinated; Sonny is killed. Only Michael is left to head the family business, defeating the Don's grand design. Will Michael survive to keep both the biological and mob family together?Senator Pat Geary (G.D. Spradlin), an official suborned by the mob, tells Michael that 'The Family' is Michael's delusion.It was an all-star performance by the entire cast.Though I read the book many years ago. I hesitated to see the movie out of respect for the sentiments of many Italians who believe the film to be anti-Italian. After watching the film many years after its release I decided it is not anti-Italian as much as it is the finest study of leadership the American theatre has exhibited. Only Twelve O'Clock High (Gregory Peck) and Major Dundee (Charlton Heston; Richard Harris) come close in the study of the personality of command. I prefer the combined version of Godfather I & II.In the gangster film genre, the comparables ST VALENTINES DAY MASSACRE (Jason Robarts), CAPONE (Ben Gazzara), VALACHI PAPERS (Charles Bronson), and LEPKE (Tony Curtis) are all great in their own right with splendid acting but nonetheless they barely approach the eloquence of THE GODFATHER.",10,1,4,29 April 2006
