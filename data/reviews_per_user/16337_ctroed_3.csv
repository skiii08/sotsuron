Ali," What went wrong??
","This movie was a massive failure. When I go to a movie about somebody I know almost nothing about, I expect to know a fair bit about that person after the movie is over. Well I still know very little about Ali. At the end of most scenes, I asked myself 'what just happened?' or 'what did he/she say?'. This is not a good sign. In interviews, Will Smith said he had to learn all about being muslim....why??? I learnt absolutely nothing about it from this movie, just that apparently the leaders of the faith wanted Ali's money. Michael Mann's 'The Insider' was a terrific movie that gave me tremendous insight into that situation. So why has he failed this time?",7,1,2,22 February 2002
X-Men," Finally a Good Summer Movie
","For so long audiences have had to put up with alot of crap during the American summer. Eg. Wild Wild West, well basically anything will Will Smith. But finally a movie like X-Men has come along to hopefully show what a big budget studio CAN do if it actually tries to make the movie work effectively, rather than just shove a big name into a bad script and expect $20 million in the first weekend. X Men is different because A. It's well written, with good dialogue and characters you care about B. uses its budget to show special effects that other films are too lazy to show and C. when you walk out of the theater you don't feel ripped off AGAIN! I praise the filmmakers also for allowing people like me who have no idea what X Men was when they entered the cinema to understand where all the characters have come from and to finally enjoy what they can do.",8,0,0,15 July 2000
Saving Private Ryan," Hollywood rewrites history yet again
","Steven Spielberg has such an enormous ego that he thinks he can slab a few cardboard characters together, make one of them Tom Hanks (who cannot act to save his life) and whooppee another Oscar and $200+ million bucks will come his way. Unfortunately, the uneducated, buy anything that is told to them by a screen American public justifies his ego by buying tickets to his films. Saving Private Ryan is just another war film written by an ambitious, highly paid writer hoping to slap a few scenes together with as little thought as possible and win an Oscar as a result. If this movie was released in 1999 it wouldn't have been nominated for anything. If you want to see a GOOD movie, go see Girl, Interrupted, Being John Malkovich, Magnolia or even Toy Story 2! They are all FAR superior to this attempt at saying to Americans 'we won the war, with no help whatsoever, and we beat the rest of the world, yippi!' If Americans knew the REAL TRUTH, Oprah would have to extend her contract another 10 years just to talk about it with her brainwashed, braindead American housewife viewers.",Null,0,0,14 October 2000
