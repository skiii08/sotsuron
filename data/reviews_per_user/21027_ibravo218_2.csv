Iron Man 3," This is a very spectacular movie.
",I went in the movie excited. I've read reviews online which were mixed (most on the hating side) so i decided that id see it for myself to judge it. And as you guessed i enjoyed it.I didn't enjoy the twist but the movie is awesome. Everything fit well in each scene of the movie and didn't disappoint. The acting was great and the plot was understandable and acceptable for me. I personally think this is the best iron man yet. When there are scenes without the iron man suit it turns into a Bourne identity type movie. It had the right amount of humor and darkness in it...I am supposing that most people dislike this movie because of the villain. I mean who would blame them. i know it's one of my hatreds towards the movie but that was it. As an action movie it was great. Most people thought it was too humorous but to me it had the right amount of humor. It didn't feel like a comedy it felt like an action movie. So yeah I enjoyed it.,8,2,6,6 May 2013
Man of Steel," This is a spectacular heart racing experience with excellent crafted action And Music by Hans Zimmer
","Man of Steel Has exceeded my expectations of how good this movie will be. This movie is almost perfect but close enough to being perfect that this movie gives you hope for a Juatice league movie. Almost everything was good about this movie...The plot flowed well throughout, The acting was all the way top notch with Henry Cavill proved that he is the man of steel. The action, all I have to say is wow. The music composed for this movie is breath taking and well fitted for every scene..... This movie has no gripe from me. The only gripe I can say is that the love between Lois and Clark seemed underdeveloped as to where it moved fast and made them romance for each other earlier than expected. But It's not a big complaint....Go see this movie!",10,0,4,17 June 2013
