Walk the Line," I don't rush out to buy, but I did this one. Seen twice in two days!!!
","The only thing short on this movie is it could have gone further into their life together. It was tender, painful, loving, real life emotion through addition and the love that is strong enough to break it. It had points to make, viewpoints from all sides of the people involved.It was said when the movie was coming out that Miss Vivian was discredited in this movie. I didn't see it that way at all. I saw her portrayed as a woman who was fighting to save her marriage who was a wonderful mother and wife while her husband was hellbent on finding his dream. Many women have walked in those shoes and I think she was portrayed with utmost respect and at that time of his life, she was probably better without him.But the love story of Johnny and June showed a fire that wouldn't go out and that is what the story was intended to prove -- a lifetime love.",10,2,4,1 March 2006
