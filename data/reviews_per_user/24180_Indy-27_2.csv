Raiders of the Lost Ark," My 3rd favorite film of all time
","This movie is 3rd on my list of film greats (behind E.T. and Star Wars), and is at Spielberg's, Lucas's and Fords' best.  I've seen this movie like 100 times and I still love it.  Anyone who doesn't like this movie seriously does not know what they are talking about.  Everyone rent it tonight!",10,0,0,14 May 1999
The Mummy," Awesome movie! In the same vein as Indiana Jones.
","'The Mummy' for myself, was an instant classic.  It had everything: action, romance, comedy and some stunning Special effects.  I was amazed at how the film was so potent and adventurous.  It had some obvious influences (ie. Raiders of the Lost Ark,  old adventure serials, etc.) but I think they created something new here.It has some queasy sequences that might turn off a few viewers, but it is done in such a fun way that you hardly notice, like the 'Indiana Jones' series.  It is not quite as good as the Indy pictures but it is something to tide us over until Indiana Jones 4.  For fans of adventure and comedy alike see 'The Mummy'!",10,0,0,10 May 1999
