Gremlins," Gizmo ka ka
",I remember when I saw this in the cinema for the first time.  There was a queue a mile long!  We actually had to sit in the aisle to watch this movie! I really enjoyed this.  You feel like you're on an adventure to find Stripe and the other mutated Gremlins.  The scene in the swimming pool in the YMCA where there are hundreds of pods waiting to hatch.  That sent a chill up my spine I can tell you.  Well I was only 7 at the time.  Gremlins is a good mixture of horror and comedy.  Another good scene is the one where Gizmo is driving around in the toy store in a toy car.  A good laugh for everyone. Stay away from Gremlins 2 though....  it's is not half as good as this one. Rent Gremlins today!,Null,0,1,21 July 2000
Billy Elliot," Touching story
","This is one of the better films of 2000 so far.  It has an excellent story which tells the story of Billy Elliott (funnily enough) who wants to be a ballet dancer more than anything.  The story is set against the Miners' strike of the early 1980's and Billy's family struggle to get money together to send him to the Royal Ballet School in London.  Like most lads, I thought that it might be a little 'female' for want of a better word, however, this is an excellent film that will make the hardest of lads well up just a bit.  The scene where Billy's father nearly goes back to work over the picket line is especially poignant.Go and see this today.  You won't be disappointed.",Null,0,0,2 October 2000
Dead Poets Society," Carpe Diem!
","Robin Williams is Professor John Keating who takes over an English poetry class.  He is a revolutionary in that he tells his class to 'suck the marrow out of life' and seize the day.  I thought that this would be a drag from the title, but it is misleading in that it shows the lives of several students in the authoritarian school of 1950's America, which is at times humourous and sad.Williams should play more of these kind of roles.  He has lost his way a bit in recent times with such trash as 'What dreams may come' and 'Flubber'. Check this movie out for some fine acting and a good story.",Null,0,0,31 July 2000
American Pie," A laugh a minute
","American pie on the outside seems like one of your coming of age movies, but.... take another look.  If you don't want to be challenged in thinking out plots or storylines, watch this.  Basically it's about a couple of high school kids who want to 'get laid' before the end of the prom.... (sound familiar?)  Some good laughs along the way though.",Null,0,0,4 August 2000
The Fast and the Furious," Fasten your seatbelts!
","This is a VERY fast movie!  Put it this way, if you like cars at all, you will love this movie.  Fast cars, fast women.... you've heard all the cliches, but they are all in this movie.  The cars look excellent and they must have spent a small fortune for each take on the crashes!",Null,1,1,30 October 2001
The Commitments," deadly!
","This is one of the all time great music/Irish films.  Alan Parker directs all these musicians brilliantly, and that's what they are.... musicians who act and not the other way around!  That's what makes The Commitments so genuine.  Andrew Strong has an excellent voice and the rest of the band, Joey the Lips etc., give some great one liners, for example, Joey 'Sure we could have made albums and toured and all that other stuff, but this way it's poetry'.I hear they are making a sequel soon, which I am looking forward to.  Check out the original as I doubt that this can be topped.  Excellent viewing.",Null,2,3,9 February 2001
28 Days Later...," Great idea, great atmosphere...
","I thoroughly enjoyed this film.  Because Ireland is such close proximity to the UK, the idea of a virus infecting a whole country both disturbs and fascinates me.  28 days later has some excellent photography (just look at the deserted London streets) and some fine acting from the up and coming Cillian Murphy (who is Irish also!).  I have just seen Dawn of the Dead, but it doesn't compare.  This is your typical gore fest from Hollywood, but it doesn't have the same feel or look as 28 days later.  Danny Boyle is a brilliant director and has done a great job.  I wouldn't mind seeing a sequel to this film.  It would be nice to see how they cure the infected UK.Anyway, have a look at 28 days later.  It will make you think. 8/10",Null,1,2,30 March 2004
There's Something About Mary," Ouch, that's gotta hurt!
","This movie is pure laughing all the way.  It's the only movie that I went to see again in the cinema.  Ben Stiller plays a love lorn teenager at first, with a crush on Mary (Cameron Diaz).  He asks her to the prom and she accepts much to his and everyone elses' surprise.  Unfortunately the night doesn't go to plan with Mary's brother beating him up at first and then he has an unfortunate accident in the toilet... oooooh, for anyone who has seen this film, you know what I'm talking about.13 years later Ted (Stiller) is still in love with her.  He hires Pat Healy (Matt Dillon) who deceives Ted into thinking that Mary is married and ugly with drinking problems.  This doesn't put him off however, and he meets up with Mary in Florida.  The dog steals some of scenes though especially when he jumps up on Ted. (very funny scene)The Farrelly Brothers are masters of comedy and this is no exception.  If you liked Dumb and Dumber this is a must.  Also check out the outtakes at the end.  They are funnier than the movie! (if that's possible).  9 out of 10.",Null,0,0,4 August 2000
Final Destination," Who's next again?
","This is one confusing movie!  Don't get me wrong it's damn scary with some really tense moments.  The scene of Todd getting killed in the bath really drags out and the tension is almost unbearable.  I don't think that Scream can be compared to it as Scream has more dark humour than Final Destination. All the actors/actresses are good in their respective roles and I'm sure we'll see them in future releases.Final Destination is a film to go and see on an empty stomach.  It'll make you cringe, laugh and think beyond all conceivable doubt.  The film's line 'Am I next?' is all that I can really remember of the script.  The crash scene in the plane is very realistic (too realistic in fact!). Don't go and see this if you have any fears of flying!  I give it a 6.5 out of 10.",Null,0,0,14 August 2000
Born on the Fourth of July," War is hell
","To anyone who thinks that Tom Cruise was a typecast actor, I ask them to take a look at this movie.  There is some splendid acting from Cruise as he plays Ron Kovic, a Vietnam Veteran, who, before he goes to Vietnam, is an eager teenager, who wants to join the Marines.  He is convinced by the recruiting officer that this is what all young men should do.  Cruise is then sent off to 'Nam, where he accidentally kills a young private and is racked with guilt.  He is then shot in the foot and back which sends him home paralised to the Vet's hospital in the Bronx.  When he returns home a hero, he soon realises that war is not the answer and ends up with his childhood sweetheart fighting for peace.  This is truly a masterpiece by Oliver Stone, one of the great directors of the modern art of moviemaking.  I recommend this film to anyone for a truly good night's viewing.  There is also an excellent soundtrack which fits right in with the action and the atmosphere of the late 60's and 70's.  8 out of 10.  Well done Tom Cruise!",Null,0,0,26 July 2000
Back to the Future," Classic time travel adventure
","I love this film!  Michael J Fox plays Marty McFly/Calvin Klein, an 80's teenager who is going nowhere.  His only friend it seems is Doc Brown, an eccentric inventor, played by Christopher Lloyd, who invents a time machine out of a De Lorean.  I loved the scene where the De Lorean backs out of the lorry in the JC Penney parking lot from the Dry Ice.  The soundtrack is excellent and really fits in with the action. The skateboarding is well done too as Marty tries to escape from Biff and the gang in the 1955.  Rent this out now, you will really enjoy it.  If you enjoy this go and rent the sequel.  It's more of the same fun.  I've given BTTF a 9 out of 10.",9,1,2,24 July 2000
