The Sound of Music," a classic, if ever there was one
","For those of us who love the musical theatre and lament over the fact that the original star was not cast in the movie this movie is the supreme exception. I am sure Mary Martin was wonderful as was Australias leading lady June Bronhill but there is no denying that Julie Andrews is the perfect Maria. She is indeed practically perfect in every way. The opening when the camera pans over the glorious scenery and we see Maria singing the title song must be one of the great moments in film. It is up there with the shower sequence of Psycho. The whole cast is great. One performance that just get better and better each time I see it and lets face it we have all seen it dozens of times, is Eleanour Parker as the Baroness. She is wonderful. It was great to see Marni Nixon, the great voice but unseen in many a movie. It is a pity a few grumpy old critics could not see through their bias and take the film for what it is, a joyful celebration. It gets a ten from me and it always will. I read once that Christopher Plummer was not happy with his performance in the movie but in actual fact he gave a nicely restrained gentle performance. It is indeed the role he will be remembered for.",10,3,10,18 September 2005
X-Men Origins: Wolverine," wolverine is a bitch
","Some movies can be so bad that you wonder why it was made in the first place. Melba once said of the public, 'give the muck' Muck is served up in this shambles with abandon. The feeble plot is meant to give us an idea about the beginning of the character played by Hugh Jackman. I quite liked the other movies but this is all over the place. The special effects are as we predicted, special, but the movie is not backed up with any talent. The normally wonderful Hugh Jackman puts on a terrible American accent and wanders around the movie looking rather like a constipated poodle. Someone should put him on a leash and take him to the nearest Broadway stage. One wishes this fine performer would get back to musicals which he does better than any one. Maybe a few show tunes would help this mess. Hugh is not the worse actor in the movie because that distinction goes to the hopeless Liev Schrieber who has about as much screen presence as a block of wood. He grunts and mumbles and you hope a vet will put the poor sod down. Julia Blake and Max Cullen are dreadful in thankfully minor roles. You actually start feeling as though you want to cheer when the annoying old bag snuffs it. It is dreadful. The effects are good but play the video game instead.",1,1,8,11 May 2009
Sweeney Todd: The Demon Barber of Fleet Street," well made but its a pity about Mrs L
",I really looked forward to this movie. I love the score and I love Mr Depp. Sondheims score is a demanding one for any singer and I must say thats the disappointing thing in the movie because apart from young Ed Sanders as Toby very few of the cast are up to it. The scene with Helena B Carter as Mrs L with Saders is an eye opener. He sings his socks off and Carter is not in his league. Carter is pretty ordinary not awful but it just is not the tour de force we got from Lansbury or Patti Lupone in the concert version. The problem is that there are much better actors than Carter and she has very little presence and at times walks through the role looking very uncomfortable. Depp makes a solid fist at the role but you cannot help longing for a gutsy performer like George Hearn. Its odd that they snub the Broadway stars today just as they did in the old days. How wonderful it would be to see the roles and performances kept forever on celluloid. How wonderful it would have been to have some of the original stars preserved on film. Oh well. Its a good film but not a great one.,Null,0,2,11 April 2008
No Country for Old Men," over rated and confusing
","There is nothing wrong with the acting in this movie. Indeed all the performers give strong characterisations. Visually at times it is splendid and the small cameo performances such as the two kids on their bikes fascinated with the guy's bone sticking out of his arm and handing him a shirt he uses as a sling. Scenes of an injured dog on the plains are heart breaking. There are some gruesome scenes unbearable to watch but that rarely worries me. I do think it becomes over done though. Shock and shlock! But in the end its a very over rated empty vessel. It is totally confusing, convoluted and incoherent. Either the film is badly edited and we end usp with a disconnected mess or the directors are trying to be too clever for their boots. Obviously audiences liked it but for this movie goer it was very unsatisfying and hardly worthy of an Oscar. Still if the Academy can over look a masterpieve like Broke Back Mountain and give it to a dud like Crash, what can one expect?. Another woeful unsatisfying move by two over rated movie makers. A cop out ending.",2,11,25,28 May 2008
