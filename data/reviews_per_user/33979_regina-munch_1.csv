Abraham Lincoln: Vampire Hunter," Take it for what it is and it's really fun.
","It's definitely a guilty pleasure movie, but once you get comfortable with how ridiculous the concept is, it's great. The whole idea is clever, well-done, and fun and weaves events from Lincoln's life together with the vampire theme in an inventive way. I loved that it was presented very straightforwardly, with no hint of irony or winking at the audience, which I thought was refreshing and made it much more enjoyable than it would have been if they'd tried to make a joke out of it. The action sequences are, as one other reviewer put it, 'a feast for the eyes.' The character development is lacking, but that's not the focus at all and I didn't think it really detracted from anything else. Some Southerners might not like it...",8,4,9,22 June 2012
