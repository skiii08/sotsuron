The Ring," Excellent...I'm still in shock !
","Except the ending was not so good , a kind of short ; the movie was really excellent. The thrilling faction was thought marvelously and filmed great. Each thrilling scene hits you like a punch in the face. I really do not like '16' label on the boxes but I really think this movie shall not be seen below 16 , alone at a dark night or if you have any heart problems . The mystery facts are shot well and makes you forget the time while you are watching the movie. The cast is not consist of well known actors/actresses but the performance was great. This movie is a must to see for thriller/mystery fans and is really a must for archives. I enjoyed watching it and still in shock because I didn't think it would pass average and also I don't think that I will be watching it alone at home although it will be 2nd time.  10/10",10,0,0,29 January 2003
