Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," Not Bad
","All the critics have been bashing this film, but I enjoyed it.  The special effects were amazing (of course), but also, I found there to be no lacking of plot, as many reviewers will have you believe.  The acting was also good, contrary to what the reviewers say.  The computer graphics characters interact well with the real actors, especially Watto, a fly-like junk dealer.  Overall a good movie.",8,0,0,22 May 1999
American Beauty," My New Favorite Film
","I just returned from seeing what may be the best movie since Schindler's List.  American Beauty is funny, powerful, tragic, and it leaves an impression that will take weeks to wear off.Why is American Beauty so great?  Is it the smooth transitions from comedy to tragedy?  Or is it Kevin Spacey's performance, which may even top that of The Usual Suspects and Seven?From Thora Birch's opening lines to the close of the movie, which is both chaotic and peaceful, the movie leaves the viewer mesmerized.  Sam Mendes' direction is perfect.Trying to describe the plot of American Beauty would be like trying to tell someone's life story in a sentence.  But it is the story of a miserable man who tries to become happy again.  And while the story may sound told, it is not the story but the script that makes it seem fresh again.Rumors say that American Beauty may be too dark to have an Oscar chance, but I hope not.  I hope the academy recognizes all involved with this film.  It is truly great.",10,0,0,24 September 1999
Being John Malkovich," Second Best Movie of the Year
","It has been years since we, the moviegoing public, has seen a year as filled with great cinema as 1999.  First The Matrix, then The Sixth Sense, the cartoon The Iron Giant, my favorite movie of all time American Beauty, the raging Fight Club, and now, Being John Malkovich.  Never have I seen such a creative concept for a movie.  And the entire series of plot twists that make the entire movie one huge jumble of plots and stories.  And right at the center is John Horatio Malkovich.The story is so original and absurd it is hard to believe anyone could think of it:  A puppeteer/file clerk finds a doorway into John Malkovich's head, in which you can see the world through John Malkovich's eyes for fifteen minutes.  The clerk teams up with a beautiful coworker, who his wife ends up falling in love with.  And the coworker loves the wife-when the wife is inside of John Malkovich.  Saying anymore would wreck the movie experience, but there is one scene, with the Million Malkoviches, that blew me away.10 out of ten.",10,0,2,31 October 1999
