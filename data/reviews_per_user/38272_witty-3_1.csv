Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," Overlong in places, with some sparks moving in from the west...
","I wasn't expecting much from The Phantom Menace, especially as the title sounded more like an episode from Scooby Doo, and partly also due to Mark Kermode (Radio 1 film critic). However, I was impressed by the totally amazing special effects, and some nice touches:1. Fish-I will never look at them in the same way ever again due to that brilliant underwater scene 2. Podrace commentators+Tuscan raiders- an interesting touch to plant an alien with two heads in as well as some excitement to a souped up Formula 1 Grand PrixThere are others, but I'm sure they've been pointed out. However, no film is without faults:1. Podrace was far too long- My 12 year old sister noticed this first; yes, she is a Star Wars fan before anyone says.2. Why didn't George Lucas give Darth Maul more lines?
3. Jar Jar Binks (enough said there)4. Qui-Gon Jinn took far too long to die at the endBut overall, this is a really good special effects movie, but be prepared to be disappointed by the script.",Null,0,1,7 August 1999
