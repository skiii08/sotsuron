Scarface," unbeatable
","This movies has everything you could possibly ask for. Pacino's performance is probably the best he's ever done. The directing is dark but brilliant, even so this movie might touch on the darker elements of human behaviour such as the constant form of violence you cannot take this away from the movie. Even so certain scenes might be a little much for some people I still feel it is one of the best movies I have ever seen.",9,0,1,21 January 2003
The Green Mile," a rare treat of a movie
",I think frank darabont has done himself proud with this magnificent film. Of course it did originate from the master himself stephen king but the movie itself could not have been better portrayed. The performances are extraordinary and the plot is something I have not seen since the usual suspects. all in all the green mile is gauranteed to keep you on the edge till the very end.,9,0,1,20 January 2003
