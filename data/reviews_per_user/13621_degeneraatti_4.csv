Abraham Lincoln: Vampire Hunter," A serious attempt at Lincoln hunting vampires. Seriously?
","A film with Abraham Lincoln, the 16th president of the United States, the guy with the iconic beard and a very tall top hat, hunting vampires? Sounds like fun!Unfortunately, this film takes itself way too seriously, which is kinda baffling considering the title and the synopsis. It's not all garbage, but with light-hearted action and the thrill of supernatural violence written all over the premise, Abraham Lincoln: Vampire Hunter proves to be a major let-down.Maybe a simpler story would've helped? Why have so many pieces in it, when all people come to see here is what has been promised even before the film started: Mr. President kicking some fang-toothed butt amidst the internal turmoil of 19th century USA. Considering that being the main attraction here, the tone is also all wrong. Why so serious? If a point is being made here, it's really being lost in all the blood and the ax-wielding.Admittedly this film does have some cool shots and some nicely inventive action. But in the end, a neater package and a lighter approach would've been the key to success. Now it's bouncing off the walls and running and bumping into household objects like a 3-year-old on a sugar high.If they ever decide to make Teddy Roosevelt: Zombie Hunter or George Washington: Alien Hunter I hope they take note of all this and treat us to some quality leave-your-brain-at-the-cloakroom fun this film promised but failed to properly deliver.",3,3,5,28 September 2014
Ghostbusters," A film that doesn't miss a step
","Laughing at someone is an easy way to make comedy. It's the way school bullies operate. Laughing at an unwilling comedy vehicle also gives to ones doing the laughing a sense of superiority, tickling the satisfaction centers in our brain.This is not the way Ghost Busters work. They had every possibility to ridicule various groups of humans, but luckily decided not to. The humor here is benign, well written, and constant. The humanity of all characters present is both endearing and an endless supply of laughter.But what makes Ghost Busters a classic is the fact it doesn't stop here. The story is exciting, with a real sense of adventure. Still, not missing a beat, it never goes overboard, helping audience to laugh whenever laughs are provided.This movie is comedy gold, and a must for everyone with even a mild love for movies and entertainment. Best watched with a pack of marshmallows.",8,4,4,28 September 2014
Black Hawk Down," A world record attempt at used squibs, blanks, explosions and testosterone.
","There is no doubt about the level of realism exhibited in Black Hawk Down. The explosions look more like real explosions compared to the fuel explosions we're used to, the fog of war is dense throughout, and the steep difference in skill between trained soldiers and angry men with automatic weapons is clearly visible. I was reminded of a recent Vice documentary about the Malian Army's fight against their local rebels where in the end the French army had to come and clear the village like a deus ex machina when the local force couldn't.Well, realism is expected when based-on-real-life-events meets Ridley Scott. And realism, to an extent, is good. But here it seems to highlight the testosterone-fueled romanticism we are fed with in between all the shooting and mayhem, which just doesn't sit. In a more drama- like war film it wouldn't bother me that much, but when the tone of the movie is the same as in a military recruitment video, it sticks out like a sore thumb.The grittiness of a shootout, with dust and mud getting everywhere, the numbing stress, the mix of utter fear and cold determinism, those all come across here. But the drama part, the content this movie advertises itself with, is a bit cheesy to my tastes and exposed with the well-done fight sequences. Soldiers under fire are not in shambles, I should know, but neither are they spitting out instantly quotable lines or delivering moving monologues at every opportunity.",4,0,3,5 October 2014
Centurion," A pack of decent action scenes doesn't yet make a movie
","Centurion is the fourth film by Neil Marshall, the director previously responsible for the films Dog Soldiers, The Descent, and Doomsday. So it can be expected that when it comes to action Mr. Marshall should deliver.And deliver he does. The action parts are, if occasionally suffering a bit from slight excess and shaky camera, a pleasure for the viewer. The thought and dedication that went into making them is visible. It has to be noted though, that the amount of graphic violence on screen will definitely be too much for those who think that eg. Robocop or Sabotage are too violent.That is, however, where the praises end. The acting present is good, yet nothing spectacular, and the delightful action scenes would benefit from more flesh in the story to makes the viewer more engaged. The Eagle, that in theory could be a sequel to Centurion, had that side covered better, even with the less-inspired direction and acting. Maybe combining these two would make a real gem of a movie?All and all, this film is worth a watch for those with a bit of taste for action or historical movies, and maybe even a re-watch for those with more than just a bit of that aforementioned taste. No damnatio memoriae required here.",5,1,5,11 October 2014
