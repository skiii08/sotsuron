Who Framed Roger Rabbit," No More 'Piddies'? No more Tweety! Root 4 Sylvester
","POSSIBLE SPOILERS. If I watch future Sylvester & Tweety cartoons, I'll be very tempted to root for Sylvester after the way little Tweety disregarded poor Eddie Valient's life for the sake of a 'Dis wido piddy went to market' game! LOL. Doing it to Sylvester the cat would be one thing. At least he was trying to harm him, so it would be easier to justify the actions. Eddie was just trying to save himself after walking through the wrong door. I think a good poetic justice on Tweety would be the 'Adult Swim' treatment. Tweety is put so at the mercy of Sylvester that only Eddie Valient save his butt.Though I am largely being tongue & cheek & I thought the whole feature was funnier than all get-out, I think there is still some food for thought. Namely that Tweety Bird was a character we grew up believing we should be sympathetic towards when he's being stalked by Sly. One of the things that made the violence & misfortunes in the W/B cartoons easy to laugh at is that they were usually just desserts visited upon the trouble makers. Unlike some of the Walter Lance(Woody Woodpecker ect.)features, which I think I remember as being a little more malicious.All the Sigmund Froid aside, I think I can pretty well mirror what the reviewers before me said. This brought mixed animation & comedy to a new level. Like Back to the Future before it-to use an old cliche- it was a laugh a minute.In a very real way, it was a coming full circle of the classic cartoons. It wasn't just for kids, it was for adults who remembering these toons from childhood. It capitalised on many of the gags in a way that's easily funny to adults. OBTW, my understanding of many of the W/B cartoons were intended to be as adult-funny as permissible for a child-friendly cartoon for the standard of the time.",Null,0,1,6 May 2002
The Terminator," Internal Consistency Problem?
","WARNING:POSSIBLE SPOILERS AHEAD.    Very riveting. One of the holes in the plot however  is the fact that when  John Conners-Sarah Conners' son sends his dad back from the future to rescue his mom from Arny, he makes her pregnant with....JOHN CONNERS!!  Pop had to go back in time for his son-who ordered him to go(interesting family chain of command)TO EVEN EXIST IN THE FIRST PLACE! I wonder if this should lead to a prequel. Was Sarah already in an alternate time line, already touched by time travel? No doubt, it's probably hard to do a movie or story about time travel without some internal consistency problems. For example, in movies like Back to The Future II, where Marty & Jennifer see their future selves. Seems theoretically they should have discovered that their future selves disappeared the day they went into time warp, casualties of their own time travels!  All that said, use of time travel stories as metaphors of observing & experiencing variables in the impact different choices can have on our destiny can more than make up for not being scientifically correct. Especially since no body's sure if time travel itself is even possible- much less scientifically correct. Nevertheless, when I see anomalies like the aforementioned conception, I find it worth noting.",Null,0,0,18 March 2002
The Untouchables," Ness prophesying his dying act, or De Palma's hindsight?
","SPOILERS:At the end of this movie, Ness(Cosner) was asked what he'd do if prohibition was repealed. He said he'd probably pour himself a drink. I saw a documentary on Elliot Ness that said that in his last moment B/4 a fatal heart attack he had poured himself a drink, & dropped dead just as he raised it to his lips. Tempting to view this as poetic justice because he was doing what he made a career condemning in others.  What qualifies this is his expressed view of prohibition-as played by Cosner. 'It's the law of the land'. That leaves open the possibility that Ness was after the disregard for law & order that seemed to explode from disregard for the prohibition laws, rather than a condemnation of alchohol itself.",Null,0,0,20 May 2002
The Wizard of Oz," Gives 'Talking Head' a New Meaning
","POSSIBLE SPOILERS. Actually, I suppose the Wizard's manifestation could be called the ORIGINAL TALKING HEAD! Many things could be said about this movie, but for lack of time, one of the most impressive scenes in the movie when I saw it as a kid was the twister. It was the 1st non-cartoon tornado I'd ever seen. Seeing how the periferal winds were already giving the folks a hard time, I even at that young age figured the winds in that ominous vortex in the background must be REALLY INTENSE to contrast so conspicuously against the surrounding tempest. Was surprised in later years to learn the twister was NOT a dubbed in video of an actual tornado, but a very complex(for the time)stage 'prop'. I think it involved a large windsock. Said to be the most sophisticated & expensive Special effect in the whole feature-& in the B&W portion no less! Very seldom, if ever, b/n WOO & Twister have tornadoes been so realistically been simulated on the silver screen.",Null,0,1,12 April 2002
