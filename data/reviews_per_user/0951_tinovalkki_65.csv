Blade Runner 2049," Masterpiece, almost as good as first one despite Zimmerman
","The original Blade Runner is one of my favorite movies of all time. With it's cult reputation, earned well, I was little exited how well Blade Runner 2049 redeem it's expectations compared to first movie. Luckily my expectations were not vain. Blade Runner 2049 is visually stunning, philosophic and strong movie. Not even it's length (almost 3 hours) feels too long. It satisfy all the expectations and in some parts even fly over them. Movies ambiance has well preserve compared to first Blade Runner movie. Even the script succeed to keep it's secrets up until the end. Philosophic deliberation comes very near what Philip K. Dick has reached in his novel. To every viewer movie leaves their choose to make, what is enough to compare androids to humans and and their humanity.Los Angeles looks even more dangerous with it's all crazy weather what climate change has made for it. Movies dystopia is merciless to watch and draws sorrowful view to future.Even though Hans Zimmerman almost manage to compose the score close enough of original it doesn't feel right enough. Score of Vangelis at the first movie is so strong and hypnotic and mesmeric that it is impossible to outweigh.After all Blade Runner 2049 is austerity masterpiece and it almost achieve from it's role model. Denis Villeneuve as director manage to exceed to expectations well enough. Ryan Gosling is convincing as K. Harrison Ford renew his role better as Deckard than any other 75 year old senior actor. Movie has substance enough to be such a cult classic as the first Blade Runner movie is.",9,2,6,25 October 2017
The Hunger Games: Mockingjay - Part 1," Greed Hollywood
","The Huger Games has clearly grown up in Mockingjay. Social criticism is much stronger than previous movies. Films theme is much more brooding and ominous than before. But that doesn't save this picture totally. Dividing the movie in two parts is clearly a huge mistake. Many scene are way too long and some of them are clearly just vain. Topmost feeling is just making more money. It would be much better to make only one movie instead of two. One three hour long movie is much easier to keep together, than two over length movies. It is clearly Hollywood's greed to capitalize on movie (and book) series fans. How many times more the audience will accept that? Jennifer Lawrece is great at her role as Katniss, but somehow Josh Hutcherson as Peeta's role as brainwashed puppet doesn't convince. There is a lot of good elements in this movie so it is a shame that Hollywood want just get few more money from the fans. Mockingjay part 1 is despite that quite eligible movie that end up in green money making. Good movie ends up to mediocre action flick and that is shame.",6,53,82,22 November 2014
It," Excellent adaptation from Stephen King novel.
","Many Stephen King filming are pure rubbish. It is very hard to bring Kings twisted books to a good film adaptation. Books are often so massive and text so weird, that making them a proper movie is almost impossible. Only few of Stephen King filming are goo, most are bad. IT belongs to good ones. Director has been wise to split massive book to two movies. Original book meander between 50's and 80's. In this movie story has split to two stories. First one has moved from 50's to 80's and second movie will be placed to present day. Very clever, because 80's is so nostalgic these days. Everybody who has seen Stranger Things in Netflix knows, that 80's nostalgic is very popular right now. Somehow IT reminds much like a Stand by Me and Goonies, but at the same time those movies are like kids movies compared to IT.Many times children actors are embarrassing to watch, but somehow these young actors are brilliant. Characters are plausible and you will get fond of them enough, that the scary scenes are really scare. Compared to many present horror movies, IT won't have too much digital effects, that makes it feels even more scarier. Nostalgic imagery combined to old school horror works well. Music and sound effects are used wisely, but effective.If somebody still remember the old TV-series from same story and traumas it left, you won't be disappointed. IT update nostalgic horror wisely to present day. Even story has now divided to two parts, movie still works perfectly as a independent story. Massive 180 million box office at the first weekend although will guarantee, that we will see the second part very soon.",10,6,15,11 September 2017
Gravity," Simply the best movie of the year
","http://tinovalkki.blogaaja.fi/gravity-3d-2013-2/Gravity is simply brilliant movie. Gravity is claustrophobic thriller about surviving. Gravity is incredible realistic space adventure. Gravity is extremely beautiful to watch. Gravity sounds perfect balance between Steven Prices roaring score and absolute silence. Gravity is simply the best movie of the year. If I have to bet next spring Oscars, I would say that Gravity will get the most of the nominations and perhaps trophy's too. I bet the next ones:Best movie.Best director.Best leading actress.Best cinematography.Best staging.Best sound recording.We will see how many I hit it right. 3D is beautifully used and it brings great depth and that feeling of helplessness when you try to reach out the rescue that verge on your fingertips and you are totally powerless to affect to reach it. Gravity is one of the most visually stunning space adventure motion picture. From a simply story movie grows to breathtaking survival story which fights against the time and decreasing oxygen. Sandra Bullock makes the most perfect role of her career as Dr. Ryan Stone. George Clooney is great as always, even his role stays Sandra Bullock's shadow. Movie is certainly worth to watch. Full five stars and Oscar's too.http://tinovalkki.blogaaja.fi/gravity-3d-2013-2/",10,4,7,10 November 2013
The Maze Runner," Good, but could easilly be better
","Although The Maze Runner story isn't one of the brilliants I have seen, it is interesting enough to satisfy my interest. Opening scene is intriguing and wakes your interest to wait to see what to come. Story itself is many times seen in various movies, but citation to such movies as Cube and TV- shows like Lost keeps you interest awake about what to come. Biggest problem is the movie casting. Thomas (Dylan O'Brien) is interesting character enough, but Will Boultier as villain of story is too lame personality. And somehow I don't understand the meaning of Teresa's (Kaya Scolecario) character who seem to pointless for the whole story. Maybe her role for the story grows and clears at the forthcoming movies. Sequel is coming next fall. After all great scenery combined with intensive storytelling is fresh enough to bring this movie a little bit more interesting, than most of those Hollywood's post-apocalyptic serial productions these days. I stay wait sequel with great interest.",6,35,54,22 November 2014
Rogue One: A Star Wars Story," Perfect Star Wars movie finally
","Rogue One is my kind of sequel to saga I have always wanted to see. If you liked Force Awakens you will love Rogue One. Movie have many hints to old Star Wars movies, especially to A New Hope. Many don't like the way they brought back some of the old characters, but to me it was OK. If somebody had any questions how Disney will treat Star Wars and can they keep saga alive after this movie movie I think there is no any questions about it. Disney is a perfect home for Star Wars and I hope we will see many Star Wars movies in the future. In Rogue One makers had free hands to handle the characters because there is no need to make sequel for it. You could think that story is dull, because you already know the ending. Despite that movie is full of surprises and script is clever. Without a doubt Rogue One is one of the best Star Wars movies.Star Wars movies has always been my favorite movies since 1977 first movie. It was a good choice to sell Star Wars to Disney after not so good episodes 1 to 3. This way we Star Wars fans get a chance to enjoy many more Star Wars movies in the future. Rogue One is an excellent continuum to Star Wars saga.",10,2,6,5 March 2017
World War Z," Not like the book, but great entertainment after all
","OK, the story in this film is nothing like the book. Does this mean it is a bad movie? The book is still fresh in my memory. I just read it last week. But like I, everybody who has read the book understands that the book is too hard to turn a movie by line to line. The book and the movie are practically two different stories. Maybe that is a good thing. I waited to see something familiar from the book, but perhaps it is better this way. This is not a bad movie at all. Even the story is quite coarse and ending is downright lame it doesn't bother too much. Good entertainment after all. This movie is not typical zombie movie. Lack of all grotesque mauling and killing is missing here. Reason for that must be movie huge production budget. It just simply needs to get enough viewers to cover at least that massive production value. U.S. PG13 sounds much rational than local Finnish age limit of 16. Movie is racy catastrophe movie, which is at best with it sneak and nightmare crawling scenes. Special effects are great and some of them are quite clever. 3D is quite unnecessary although it surprise you few time to splash movies incident to you face. After all it is an OK catastrophe movie. With better ending it could end up to five stars, now I will give it four stars.",8,1,6,21 July 2013
Passengers," Visually stunning in 3D
","Passenger is visually stunning movie and it is directed well too. The biggest problem is script. It is too predictable. Even so the movie is staggering beautiful to watch. Especially 3D looks great and is worth of a movie ticket. Directing is solid and expertise. At the beginning of the movie Chris Pratt is acting well as a lonely passenger. Romance at the movie is plausible and Jennifer Lawrence proves to be a great actress. Passengers is not the best sci-fi movie I have seen, but it also won't be worst. It is one of the best sci-fi movies a long time ant it's visuality is worth to see.Passengers plot is well done and it works all audience. It is some kind of Titanic in space. Little bit more drama and it would be perfect movie. Story is quote light but the way it has been done is well worth a movie ticket. It is best to watch in 3D from a big screen, visuality of it is the best in this movie.",8,2,4,5 March 2017
Star Trek Into Darkness," Great and entertaining
","Even the new Star Trek has gone far from the original, this movie works fine with J.J. Abrams. As a friend of the original series it is delightful to watch this movie when it discreetly follows the original series. Even the new Star Trek is full of action it somehow feels familiar. Humor lightens the action. Movie looks magnificent even the 3D feels a little futile. There is a lot of similarities to a original movie series. Enterprise has set beautifully and largely which allows camera to move with the action. It feels like you are really inside of a spaceship. Movie works fine with it's two hour length. It will be interesting to see what mr. Abrams do with the Star Wars. I enjoyed the whole film.",9,1,4,4 July 2013
Thor: Ragnarok," Simply the best Thor movie so far
","Thor: Ragnarok is simply the best Thor movie so far. It is funny, colorful and visually stunning adventure. Movie script is clever and even some of the jokes may sound almost too stupid the script rocks. Movie is not a narrow minded comic book filming and it wont take itself too seriously. Movie finishing is visually stunning to watch and 3D works surprising well. Chris Hemsworth and Jeff Goldblum shines at their roles. Sometimes you may think if there is already too much of comedy, but then again not. Timing is perfect and movie offers enjoyable mix of action and comedy. Like Guardians of the Galaxy movies Thor: Ragnarok is well made scifi action comedy. Very enjoyable movie with great acting and one juicy cameo.",8,1,4,13 December 2017
Ready Player One," Nostalgic for those who spend their youth at eighties.
","Ready Player One mixes snugly reality and video game in same movie. Many nostalgic characters and familiar music from eighties makes it very comfortable to watch. Many of the quotations remains most likely with any meaning for younger audience, but to me it feels nostalgic. Movie feels like 3d roller coaster and the story makes you laugh many times. All the citation to pop culture has made with good taste. It certainly feels like it has made back in eighties, but in a good way.In spite of all story feels a little too lame. It doesn't make you any anxious and after all the story is not satisfy enough. All the characters remains weak and lackluster. Steven Spielberg's directing is confident but perfunctory. Tye Sheridan makes his role moderately as Wade Watson. All the other characters are not interesting. Despite of all this, Ready Player One firmly and nostalgic movie for youngsters. With a perfunctory story it succeed to entertain you, despite of it's almost two and half hour length. It is not best movie from Steven Spielberg, but satisfy enough to entertain.",7,0,1,20 April 2018
Fast & Furious 6," Love these movies
","Fast and Furious won't let you down. Even it is a 6th installment on this series it still rocks. Movie is turbo loaded popcorn entertainmet loaded with testosteroine and smell of gas. The story isn't the brightest, but that can easilly forgive because this movie is exactly what you are waiting for. Movie is full of great action scenes which are so exaggeration that you can only laugh for them. Thankfully movie doesn't take itself too seriously, you understand that at the latest when Dwayne Johnson is to be called as a sumerian Thor. With the previous movie I was hoping that next movie get it's bad guy from Jason Statham. It didn't became truth in this movie, but the end scene promises that Jason Statham will be the bad guy in next installment. Can't wait to see that. Leave your brains to cloakroom and enjoy great entertainment.",8,6,10,4 July 2013
Suicide Squad," Simply too many characters
","Suicide Squad is DC comics counterpart to Marvel universe. Unfortunately bad one. Movie tries to bring record amount of meta humans to one movie and that is it's biggest problem. There are simply too many characters to one movie. It has no time enough to concentrate any of it characters enough Even movie have great rock classics from Queen to Black Sabbath on it's soundtrack won' make any difference. Too much is simply too much. Best part of the movie are Jared Leto's Joker and his girlfriend Harley Quinn (Margot Robbie). You almost hope that hole movie were focused on these two characters instead of what it tries to do. Suicide Squad also attempt to make DC comics movies darker and more violent movies than Marvel movies are. By doing that they ignorance bigger audience to close out of the audience younger peoples who normally are bigger audience for comic book too. Only Deadpool has succeed on that, but it was clearly targeted to more mature audience than this one. 3D on the movie feels just vain. They don't use it in any camera or cinematic effects at all. It just feels that they wanted to get that 3D added to movies name. If DC comics tries to compete to Marvel movies in any measures in the future they should focus more on story and characters than try to make their movie unnecessary noisy and violent. Suicide Squad is, unfortunately one of the worst comic book movies ever. Too bad.",4,2,4,16 August 2016
Doctor Strange," Pearl at the Marvel universe
","Marvel has brought a lot of super heroes to silver screen past few years. Not always with a best succeed, but Dr. Strange happens to be quite good of its genre. Movie catch its audience from the first moments. Benedict Cumberbatch is outstanding as role of egotistical Dr. Strange. Tilda Swinton and Mads Mikkelsen complete of satisfying roles of movie. Length of the movie is proper to story and it doesn't feel any too long.Visuality of the movie is still the best this movie can offer. With 3D/4K picture and Dolby Atmos sound movie looks and sound stunning. Movie is quite a pearl in such rugged Marvel universe. As usual, Stan Lee makes his little (and funny) cameo. The end scene with Thor engage some great feelings what we might see in the future. Hopefully mixing these movies will have a satisfying outcome.",9,0,1,4 December 2016
Interstellar," Great but not perfect
","Last year's Gravity picked many Oscar's and I would love to happen the same for Interstellar this year, though I think it have to settle for few technical Oscar's only. Matthew McConaughey is very good at the leading role, but because he won the Oscar last year for the leading role of Dallas Buyers Club, he probably won't get it for the second time subsequent. I could easily give this year's best movie Oscar to Interstellar, but the actor's guild may think that Interstellar borrow's too much of it's themes from Stanley Kubrick's A Space Odyssey 2001. Interstellar is very scientifically accurate movie as we know about space travel, worm holes and black holes today. This makes it interesting and clever depiction our changes to travel vast spaces. Hans Zimmers music is beautiful and powerful and it deepens movie themes beautifully. I probably would give at least a Oscar nomination because for that, we'll just have to wait and see what happens. After all Interstellar is one of the best and most visually stunning movie this year so far which makes it one of the musts to watch it in movie theater. It is well worth of a movie ticket. As it's best Interstellar is beautiful and enormous movie spectacle which sustain many times to watch. One of the best movie this year anyway.",9,0,6,22 November 2014
Pacific Rim," Digi-geeks wet day dream
","Pacific Rim takes summer block buster movie to it's new level. After a short and vigorous beginning the movie grows bigger than ever seen digital effect rumble. With the length of over two hours the movie is simply eye candy. Guillermo Del Toro holds the story just enough interesting that you can handle all that effect rumble. When all the Transformer movies are just empty digital effect after digital effect Guillermo Del Toro's apocalyptic world is just enough interesting to keep it watchable. Too bad that the story here is so cheesy and it has told so many times in so many different ways. But anyway this turbo loaded effect rumble is quite beautiful to watch. Many times you can see almost see a raindrop to fall from the neck metallic monster. 3D looks great even it hasn't use in every way it could have used. Movie is typical popcorn movie but the trouble here is that it can be too much to most of the viewers. You have to be geek enough to like it. For me there is no trouble to like it and it really is worth of movie ticket price. This movie is a digi-geeks wet daydream, but if you want a good story instead of effect rumble you better to avoid this movie.***1/2",7,7,11,4 August 2013
Ant-Man," B-class Marvel production
","Ant Man is baffling experience even at Marvel's universe. It tries to be as a super hero movie at the same time it is actually a anti hero movie. Marvel has manage to convert many comic books to satisfy movies recently. Ant-Man is not one of the best unfortunately. To me Ant-Man is all new experience and that might be a one reason for me not to be all pleased. Movie has made with quality, but somehow it leaves you cold. It feels like it has tried to make almost too perfect and it leaves no personality to director. It looks good but feels empty. Like some of the worst Spider Man movies. Movie doesn't offer any particular reason to pay full price of a movie ticket. It actually feels B-class Marvel movie and it would be probably best as a television series than silver screen. So if you have even a decent home theatre at home it is best to wait BluRay release. At least then you can pause it as many times as you wish.",5,12,34,6 August 2015
Oblivion," beautiful and surprising
","Oblivion is one of those movies that it is not good idea to read anything about the movie before entering movie theatre. It is enough to know that it tells a story after alien invasion , world has destroyed and Tom Cruise is in it. Movie starts nice smoothly and builds it's story slowly with nice mystery. Tom Cruise seems to fit his role as a last man after apocalyptic post mortem nuclear war which has almost destoyed the whole world. He makes his role with main requirement way, but somehow that is not enough. And Andrea Risenborough as a winy Victoria won't help the acting at all. Even Morgan Freeman won't help the story as it shoud be. Even that the roling won't convince enough Obilvion is so beautiful to watch. And somehow the story surprises you at the end. Visuality of this movie is the best you get of it and helps to rise the movie easilly above the average scifi flick. This is one of those movies that you have to watch it in movie theatre. Not any home theatre is good enough to enjoy fully it's visuality.",8,2,7,4 July 2013
Justice League," Quite a mess
","Justice League is a bit better comic filming, than Batman vs. Superman was, but nothing special between all comic filming dominating by Marvel. DC comics tries to create their own superhero universe, like Marvel has done with their comic super heroes. Basics are ok in Justice League, but poor script and too many characters makes it too fuzzy and thin. With massive 300 million dollar budget viewer expect much more than this. Maybe too many actors with too big salary is reason for this. Some special effects feel quite poor unfortunately.DC comics should have use their resources to introduce us some less known super heroes like Aquaman, Flash and Cyborg with their own movies before they rush to dump them all in the same movie. Now there are simply too many stories to tell and focus does not have enough of room to breath. Jack Snyder's replacement with Joss Wheadon at the movies finishing, many screen writers and last but not least some re filming has made the movie too unfocused.Justice League is mediocre comic book superhero filming. We shall see how many flops like this DC comics can afford, before they hang Batman's and Superman's rope conclusively. Maybe DC comics should concentrate their own movies and leave Marvel's movies not to mimic.",4,0,0,13 December 2017
Man of Steel," simply best Superman yet.
","Man of Steel divides critics. Some of them considers this movie great, some debunks the movie overloaded with effect rumble. I think that Man of Steel is at least great, maybe even awesome reboot of Superman saga. I can't deny that the effects grow quite epic at the end of the movie, but then again - so what? You can find many similarities with Batman movies, but that is quite clear with Christopher Nolan on the background: the one who rebooted Batman so well. Henry Cavill is a gret choice for role of Superman, not just because a great body of his, he looks quite hot in his tight Superman outfit. Luckily they have renewed Supermans outfit and he doesn't have to wear those ugly red underpants anymore. Russel Crowe is a good choice for Jor El and Kevin Costner fits in his role as a Clark's foster father. Michael Shannon is great as a psychotic general Zod. Movie looks great as so many other Zack Snyder movie. Effets are great to watch and that emphazises effect rumble at the end part of the movie. Scenery at planet Krypton looks fantastic in the beginning of the movie. This is quite great rebooting and can't wait to see the sequel which is already announced with Zack Snyder directing it. Definitely worth of price of a movie ticket.",Null,1,4,4 July 2013
The Revenant," Boring and lame but will get its Oscars
","Spit, dirt and painful faces. That was a first sentiment of mine about this movie. It surely is gritty picture of settler, but after tenth time when Leonardi Di Caprio rescues himself from certain death everything starts to feel too unbelievable. I am certain that many of you disagree, but for me this movie is boring and predictable. There is a lot of beautiful scenery, maybe even too much to handle. You could easily cut this movie under two hours length instead of over two and half an hour length without any suffering for the storytelling. Maybe this is what they call an artistic of a movie what it needs to take notice in Oscars. Probably it will get more than ten nominees, but is it really worth it? I am quite definite that Leonardo will pick an Oscar of best leading actor, because there are enough of spit, pus and painful faces and if that is all it needs. At the beginning of a movie is very realistic Indian attack scene, almost a racist. Attack of a bear is also very well done and it gives a strong start for a movie. Unfortunately magic vanish quite quickly. Somehow you just start to wait the end scene. Everything that happens in between star and the end starts to feel just vain. The Revenant is well produced drama, but at the same time it is boring and predictable. It is very patriotic and I'm sure the old members of actors guild will love it so much that many Oscars are pretty undisputed. To me it was just too lame and boring.",6,2,4,21 February 2016
Bridge of Spies," Not very realistic for my taste
","Bridge of Spies is very typical movie of Steven Spielberg. Drama set in near past history. Everything seems to be in place, well produced, authentic and it looks great. Very qualified drama indeed. Yes and no. Even everything seems to be in place, somehow the movie won't reach the right mood of cold war era. Maybe younger generation, who don't have own perspective about cold war era thinks differently, but to me the feeling is not somehow right. Everything is set almost too well and polished. Maybe it is an American perspective and it is not rough enough. Also the storytelling is too slow and almost boring. Story is solid. Acting is good, well directed and set looks authentic. But somehow there is something wrong in whole picture. Bridge of Spies is well done drama movie, even I don't agree. Very typical movie to win in Oscar's. I am sure that this is a movie that actors guild like. Bride of Spies is kind of movie which success at Oscar's is guaranteed. Well done drama even a lightly too smooth for my taste. It is very typical American way to see about European history. Not accurate enough, but solid story after all. ***1/2",7,0,3,20 February 2016
Divergent," Twilight meets Hunger Games
","Divergent is valid movie it own genre. Maybe even better than Hunger Games. Divergent thou have same problems than many other movies at the same genre. To maximize the profit movie violent must keep mild. If they would go to PG-15 instead of PG-13 they might get more depth to the movie. Also it might get more adult audience to watch it. Now this feels like Twilight meets Hunger Games. Story itself is quite fascinating, but it is too dragging. When something finally starts to happening movie comes to its end and you have to wait for sequel at least a year. Maybe two movies instead of three might work better. But the studios won't think viewers as much as they think profit. The problem here is that the second movie will be just a middle story to tell and you have to wait the third movie to see how the story will end. Chemistry between Tris and Four be conspicuously absent, but luckily Four is worth to watch; ) This movie is little bit better than average on its genre, but it might work better in 3D format.http://tinovalkki.blogaaja.fi/",6,0,1,3 June 2014
Ender's Game," Visually stunning with great story to tell
","http://tinovalkki.blogaaja.fi/enders-game-2013/ Ender's Game is smart sci-fi movie. Little bit like Starship Trooopers or Blade Runner. Beneath a beautiful skin there is a strong social criticism story. You may notice it or you may watch the whole movie as a beautiful sci-fi story. You may see the story as a criticism against USA:s policy to defend itself with prevention strike against anyone if they think to be threatened. In the movie almost fascist like society has tame their youth to make prevention strike without any criticism. They defend strikes justification for their youth just because enemy will strike if they don't strike first. Young Ender's dares to rise against authority and mistrusts that. Ender's Game has a great story to tell, but it is also beautiful to watch. It feels like 3D movie despite it is not. Space landscapes and -fights are gorgeous. It is always a risk to put a child to a leading role at a movie, but Asa Butterfield is a great choice for Ender's role. There is enough of sensitivity, yet enough character in his role. Harrison Ford is great as a General Graff. It is hard to believe that he is over 70 years old. Only thing which bother here is that movie feels to end too soon. It feels like it is a big budget Television show pilot movie. We will see if Ender's Game gets enough audience for a sequel. That really is needed. The great story may just to be a little too clever to its target audience. Visually stunning movie, which is have to watch from a big screen.http://tinovalkki.blogaaja.fi/enders-game-2013/",8,16,28,5 December 2013
Mission: Impossible - Rogue Nation," Perfect summer block buster
","Mission Impossible Rouge Nation is maybe the best MI movie so far. It is a perfect summer block buster movie. It feels retro at the same time it looks very modern action flick. It feels little like old time Roger Moore Bond movies. Simon Pegg is perfect contrast to Tom Cruises Ethan Hunt character and their chemistry combines very satisfy way to a perfect action movie. Beautiful scenery around the world together with Puccini's dramatic Turandot theme makes it perfect entertainment. Release date same year with the new Bond movie, six months earlier is perfect time to release this film. Timing works perfectly combining great action scenes with storytelling. Movie is enjoyable way retro and same time it feels very fresh. It is a perfect summer action rumble. Tom Cruise practice all his stunts by himself and that make the movie feel as realistic as it is possible to feel. After a movie you will leave movie theatre so satisfy that you almost can't wait the next movie. It leaves to you same feeling that old Bond movies did, you can't wait to see the next movie to see how they will surprise your expectations. This is what Hollywood's dream factory is as it's best. Shameless entertainment made with big heart to audience regardless critics. Just perfect movie entertainment.",10,0,2,6 August 2015
Now You See Me," Great entertainment
","Is there anyone who doesn't like good magic show? Few years ago I witnessed one of most amazing magic show at Las Vegas in MGM Grand hotel. Sitting in a theatre at the very first row and wondering all that magic and how it's done just few meters away from my eyes. The magician was David Copperfield and show was pure magic and at the end of the show magician shook hand with all the peoples at the first row. I was sold. Maybe that is the one reason I liked this movie very much. It started at Las Vegas in MGM Grand hotel. This movie is great illusion entertainment, almost perfect. This is visually and fantastic movie. Four magician works together perfectly and Brian Tyler's music full fill excitement. Viewer is constantly derived to think what happens next, just to see that you were wrong. That is why the end of the movie is too annoying and frustration. With better ending it would be perfect for five stars, now we have to acquiesce for four star. It is great entertainment anyway.****",8,1,4,19 July 2013
X-Men: Days of Future Past," Best mutant movie so far
","X-Men: Days of Future Past is definitely best mutant movie so far. Story plays nicely with time travel story which makes it more interesting. Movie is irresistible stylish, charismatic and most of all sincere enjoyable super hero thriller what you can compare to Christopher Nolan's stylish Batman movies. Previous Wolverine movie was a little disappointment, but this one is almost as good as first two X-men movies. You can almost say that this movie combines all the best parts from first two movies to one excellent story. But not so good that there is something bad too. Once again 3D feels vain. If you don't trust your camera man enough to let him bring something more artistic for shooting, then the result feels only lame stereophonic view. A bit like your childhood view master experience. After all movie is a great summer fun movie and very enjoyable to all X-men fans.http://tinovalkki.blogaaja.fi/",9,2,5,3 June 2014
Captain America: Civil War," Entertaining, but quite lame superhero movie
","Captain America: Civil War is quite entertaining, but empty superhero movie. Somehow I don't understand, why they have named it to Captain America movie? Iron Man is as least as predictable in this movie, that it could be Iron Man movie as well. It is better to call it Avengers movie. Movie is quite long (2,5 hours). It has inflate to almost too big. Somehow it feels, that it won't take too long when audience starts to get bored to these superhero movies. It has too many characters to tell well enough any of them story. It feels like presentation of all Marvel's superheros more than a decent movie. The story won't actually start and end nowhere. It is very entertaining thou and you easily spend 2,5 hours with it if you have enough candies, popcorn and soda to flush it all down. Movie has filmed in 3D format, but they won't get almost anything out of it which is quite surprisingly with this kind of digital effect movie. Primary movie leaves quite empty feeling, even it has a lot of action. Lee Falk's cameo is nice surprise at the end of the movie. At least it is his legacy to Marvel. Entertaining, but quite lame superhero movie.",6,3,9,10 May 2016
Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them," Familiar but not enough
","At Fantastic Beasts we got a long awaited return to Harry Potter universe. At the beginning everything seems to be as it should be. Movie looks an sound great (even with short score from HP movies), but somehow the original feeling blaze with its absence. Set and scenery looks great, actors are good and even era of 1920's recession be present, but somehow it all feels just too shallow. It doesn't help even how hard you try to believe and imagine that the beasts are just magical beasts. There are simply too may characters and their essence looks too plastic. Even their absence as nature conversation point of view feels vain. They are too external to feel any sympathy for them.Eddie Redmayne is a good actor, but as a role of Scamander he feels just like a dizzy freak. It may be a original meaning of character, but to me, I haven't read original story, he feels too light headed character. Movie ha s a lot of scenery from original Harry Potter movies, which is per se a good thing, but at the other hand it excluded some of the audience, who are not so familiar with original movie universe. Unfortunately movie feels too shallow and unclear and it never rises to level of original Harry Potter movies. The biggest filament for it may be J.K Rowling's role as a author and screenwriter. I'm sure that all characters are familiar to her, but sometimes it is better to see all of it out of the box and hand the screen writing to someone else, not so familiar with original story.Hopefully with sequel makers has a courage to challenge the audience to re familiarize for new characters. Fantastic Beasts surely is a satisfying experience to all of the biggest fans of HP universe. I haven' t read all the books tens of times with different languages as the biggest fans of the series and I have to be content of movies and to me Fantastic Beasts is a little too hard to focus, even the illusion is made as well it is. Digital character are just too much and vain. Unfortunately, but true to me.",6,0,3,4 December 2016
The Hobbit: The Desolation of Smaug," Wet daydream to Tolkien/ Jackson fans but...
","The Hobbit: The Desolation of Smaug looks beautiful and sounds brilliant, but somehow at the same time it feels so empty. Movie starts to repeat itself. There is nothing new to tell. Same old orc slaughtering and digital effect rumble that we have seen from the beginning of Lord of the Rings. How long that really can satisfy you really? Dividing a short novel to three almost three hour movies starts to feel capitalizing the audience. You also may wanted to see a movie which is more loyal to a book. Now there are characters that won't even be in original story and many crucial parts of the book are diluted. Smaug has achieved very impressive way, but the chase in dwarf's dungeons is way too long to watch. I am sure that many fans of the series will be insulted to me, when I say that this movie is nothing more than mediocre fantasy adventure. 3D feels frustrating because of using so much of studio sets. HFR makes the picture looks very sharp but at the same time set design start to look too unrealistic. Details are well done on sets, nut that doesn't help that it looks just a studio framing. It might be a good thing if Guillermo Del Toro has directed this as it was originally planned. Maybe this movie is a wet daydream to many Tolkien/ Jackson fans, but I am starting to get be bored. Sorry to say that.",5,3,12,14 December 2013
Behind The Candelabra," Great movie with great actors
","Behind the Candelbra is great fiesta of great actors. Script emphasizes brilliantly 70's and 80's zeitgeist when homosexuality was still forbidden and illegitimate. Michael Douglas sparkles as aging Liberace and Matt Damon is ingenious as young boy who falls in love with Liberace. Movie underlines finely how sinfulness show business is at the time period when artist should surely determine his career if telling to be homosexual. Movie tells sophisticated love story where Liberace can buy everything with his money, even love. Liberace fulfill his life loneliness with shopping everything he can, even young men. Matt Damon acts elegantly young man who falls in love for rich and famous older guy. Money, sex alcohol and drugs finally ends poor boys fairy tell from rags to riches. Movie doesn't underline Liberaces rich and luxury life who can buy everything with his money, even a love but tells a vulnerable love story. Even they love story ends belligerent divorce it is still nice to see that Scott was Liberaces true love. At his deathbed Liberace tells to Scott that he was his only true love. Brilliant roles and great script crowns this beautiful and funny movie.",9,1,4,6 October 2013
Gone Girl," Good thriller, but little slow
","Gone Girl is a functional thriller. With it exceptional story it will keep your interest up until the end of movie. Both sides of the story open bit by bit and it keeps spectator at loose end. There is one problem though. Story stats very slowly witch is not the biggest problem. The biggest problem is that when they start to open the story, movie is almost over and they have to rush the end of the story too much. David Fincher's directing is smooth though a little bit of rigid. This might be the problem of movie's script. Gillian Flynn might be a great writer, but his first script is not as good as it should. Writer knows his story well, but the spectator needs to see a little more to be acquainted with story. Movie script is so much more than a book where you can open story more. Ben Affleck manage his role as Nick Dunne but Rosamund Pike as Amy Dunne is brilliant. If the story would told a little better, this would get easily five stars from me, now I give it only four stars. Great thriller even though.",8,0,3,25 December 2014
The Theory of Everything," Beautiful and humble love story
","The Theory of Everything is brilliant, beautiful and most of all honest movie. It won't mince it's story and other way it won't take pity on Hawking's dramatic life. It is a honest story how hard life can be with life lasting serious illness. It is a story how relationship will be put to test in this hard situation, but it is also a beautiful story how sustainable true love can be. Eddie Redmayne is brilliant as slowly crippling Hawking and deserves his is if he will pick it. Felicity Jones acts strongly as Hawking's wife, but I not well enough to deserve Oscar from her role. This movie is humble and touching story, but many ways very positive story. Somehow the whole story feels much bigger than life. It is a tragic love story which ultimately comes ti it's tragic end and becomes a life lasting friendship. I haven't read Hawkins A Brief History of Time but I certainly will read it when I get a copy of it. Remember to bring tissues with you, because you certainly find some tears on your eyes to watch this.",9,0,0,14 February 2015
X-Men: Apocalypse," Shameless entertainment
","More doesn't always mean better. This time however it works well. X Men: Apocalypse is massive digital effect swarm, but surprisingly the story doesn't get buried under all the effects. Story is set on 80's during cold war era. Picture of the time has bring freshly to set, although it won't bring all the cliche's of that time to silver screen. The iron curtain and cold war era has brought well on set. Somehow the story reflects nicely that period manly world, but surprisingly strong women are the last and only hope for the human kind. There are of course some weakness in story. There are so many characters, that story have difficulties enough to no-one's background. Maybe that is not a big problem here. Massive effect rumble is so beautifully implement that there is enough spine for weak story. 3D is executed spontaneous well. The story is not extraordinary, but movie's razzle-dazzle is so entertaining and beautiful and collection of great young actors and actress satisfy easily. Limits of movie madness is tested on this movie. Does it means that we have finally reached all what these digital effect movies has to offer? I don't think so as long as people are ready to pay price of a movie ticket to see them.Movie is typical summer blockbuster movie. Massive effects, action combined to a light story makes people to wander to ticket window. And there is nothing bad in it, you pay the price easily, especially when it has produces so well, than this is. Shameless entertainment.",9,8,17,20 May 2016
The Amazing Spider-Man 2," Good but not great
","Once again a good example about movie that critics don't like, but I enjoy to watch. Of course this isn't greatest movie of history, but as a comic book filming it is very entertaining. Spider-Man's leaps between skyscrapers are beautiful to watch especially in 3D experience is like sitting on a roller coaster. Andrew Garfield is great as a Spider-Man, Emma Stone succeed well as Spider-Man's girl friend despite the tragical end. Sally Field is always great actress. Only Jamie Foxx don't convince in his role as a nerd. Luckily he act nerd only half of the film and the rest of the movie he is digitally enhanced Electro. Story is entertaining and pretentious comic book adaption and that is the way it should been watch. Albeit the dialogue is quite childish at time to time it doesn't bother too much. Lots of popcorn and enough of soda is all you need to enjoy this movie. If you want to say something bad about the movie you could say it has been inflate to so big that it will be a hard to surpass on next movie. Movies massive budget (200 million dollars) is hard to cross over. On the other hand if movie makes enough profit as theatrical release couple of more millions should not be any infeasible to approve.http://tinovalkki.blogaaja.fi/",7,25,41,3 June 2014
Star Wars: Episode VIII - The Last Jedi," Not perfect, but must see
","Star Wars: The Last Jedi has already divided Star Wars fan to two camp, those who love it and those who hate it. Me myself belongs to that camp, who can not dislike any Star Wars movie. Biggest problem in The Last Jedi is it's fragmentation and focusing to tell too many stories. After all it is story of Skywalker family saga. Movie doesn't fixate enough of Skywalker story, like the original trilogy. For example leaving Rey out of the family drama even she is in the middle of story telling is a little baffling. Although it may be deliberate and the next movie may contain some big surprises. If so this is easy to forgive at this moment.After all movie is quite satisfying space soap opera. In many times you start to compare it for original saga and The Empire Strikes Back. In many ways movie feels a variant of Empire Strikes Back, but there are enough of plot twist not to compare them too much. But something seems to miss. Killing Snoke at this point of trilogy feels a little precipitate. On the other hand, some of the big villains has already killed and still they came back to saga later, like what happened to Anakin Skywalker on third movie. Other thing is Rey not seems to be part of Skywalker saga, even she is in the middle of story telling. It may be that they haven't told us everything yet, but somehow it would been better to give some hint to us at this point if she somehow be part of Skywalker family saga after all.Final Result is not perfect Star Wars enjoyment, even it is eligible space soap opera. Movie is brilliant to watch and it is best to watch in 3D as big silver screen as possible. Vastness of space feels really vast and star ship chases feels like sitting in a roller coaster ride. Movie is simply must to see for all Star Wars fans and even you haven't seen any Star Wars movie before, it is still visually stunning to see.",9,1,4,25 December 2017
Guardians of the Galaxy," Visually stunning, fresh truly funny
","Guardians of the Galaxy don't take itself too seriously, and that's good. It imitates pitilessly 80's B scifi movies avoiding to mock them too much. Big production budget guarantee, that the movie looks great and there is visual for at least for two movies. 70's and 80's soundtrack brings suitably nostalgic. Guardians of the Galaxy is fresh breeze against all current comic filming. There is enough of good humor and stunning visuality. 3D works well, but as so many times before it won't use enough. Guardians of the Galaxy is eye candy to all who enjoys space action movies. At the end of the movie there is a promise of the sequel. I hope they honor this movie and avoid too cliché humor, good script is needed. Guardians of the Galaxy is entertaining, visually stunning and truly funny comic adaption, which won't let you down.",9,1,4,1 August 2014
The Imitation Game," Great and touching story
","At time to time comes a movie which story is so unbelievable that it feels it can't be true. The Imitation Game is just like that. The story is so under lining, that it feels almost implausible. This kind of stories needs valid story telling. The Imitation Game is well done quality production and it has great actors too. Benedict Cumberbatch is great choice as Alan Turing, well worth of Oscar nomination and Keira Knightley is valid at opposite role. Movie script is great and zeitgeist of the movie is brilliant. It is a touching and tragic story that deserves the best actors and actresses. The story of Alan Turing is at same time worth of proud to Britain and same time such a shame to British history. It is a good reminder of a time when England didn't treat it's own minority and homosexuals almost any better than Nazis did during the great war. Great and strong story to watch. Well worth of it's Oscars.",9,1,7,1 March 2015
Jurassic World," Great back to Jurassic...
","Dinosaur park is open and very magnificently way. Jurassic World is the best thing for this series since it's original opening back in 1993. The way they bring digital dinosaurs to big screen with true actors is simply amazing. Script may not be the smartest it it has depth enough. Chris Pratt is great choice to be a hero and Bryce Dallas Howard is brilliant as cold business woman. Even the child actors are no embarrassed this time. Even the story is quite similar with original Jurassic Park it is clearly sequel than reboot because it's hints to previous movies. The script may be quite light but it has few well written depths in the story that it keeps it entertaining and even touching. Final battle scene is quite effect rumble with all the dinosaur fighting, but end scene of the movie is almost too sweet. At once 3D works well at the movie and camera ride feels like wild roller coaster ride. Steven Spielberg has made a good choice to stay as a producer and Colin Trevorrow do good job as a director. Fine and entertaining summer block buster which leaves you to wait more to come. First weekend box office is so persuasive that it would be a miracle if this would be the last visit in park. I'm looking forward to see more visits to Jurassic World. It almost make me to hope it would be real theme park somewhere south pacific. Very good return to Jurassic Park.",9,15,40,13 June 2015
Logan," Simply the best Marvel movie so far...
","Logan is without a doubt the best Marvel movie so far. It has been made for more mature audience than other Marvel super hero movies. Far gone is terylene suited super heroes with laser sights, instead of aging whiskey drinking tired superhero. Previous movies mutant commune is gone. Logan is old and tired Professor X /Patrick Stewart) is senile old shadow of him. With them 10 years old Laura, genetically evolved new mutant super soldier. Rarely maybe never before young superhero like her has act in such gore action scenes. This group of three are looking safe heaven called Eden in North Dakota. Trip is breath taking, thrilling and even frightening. Road trip proceed up to imminent end with very gore action scenes. Logan is definitely meant for more mature audience than previous X-men movies. It is a good thing, that makers has dared to offer super hero movie for more adult audience, that give for Logan rougher and bloodier look than other super hero movies. This is something that I like more and it looks like it will make enough money at box office. If this is a last movie of Hugh Jackman as as Wolverine it is a perfect salute for his role. Logan is entertaining, full of blood and with many great action scenes included superhero movie. Something I like to watch and hopefully we will see many of it's kind at the future.",9,1,5,7 March 2017
Avengers: Age of Ultron," Digital and sound effect extravaganza...
","Do you remember the time you were child and you ate something good so much, that your stomach became sick? Can you still remember the time you got an idea which was too hard to execute? What about a time you promised to start exercise and finished it way before you started it? And do you remember that morning after when you had the worst hang over and you promised never again to drink that last beer and find yourself from pub with pint of lager next day? All those promises and movie Avengers, Age of Ultron combines the same thing. If you are not totally devoted you simply can't fulfil everything you promised to yourself. Avengers, Age of Ultron is like the promise you made. It is so stupid, that if you are not a total fan of series it is totally too much. At the same time it is so enjoyable to watch that you just can't stop watching it. There are simply too many characters that it is impossible to concentrate to tell a valid story. If you can enjoy two hours of effect rumble or if you are a total fan of Marvel comic book books you definitely can enjoy this movie. Avengers, Age of Ultron is just a turbo loaded action flick, nothing more or nothing less. I'm sure it will get it audience who are willing to pay the price of a movie ticket. As long as people do this you will get what you want. But one day, I am sure, some studio will fall from sky and hard, when people won't find these digital effect rumble any more satisfied enough. If you can enjoy enough of great digital effects without a decent story, you will find this very satisfying. If you need even a little use for your brain it is smart to avoid this movie.",6,4,10,26 April 2015
Elysium," Best sci-fi movie this summer
",Without a doubt Elysium is the best sci-fi movie this summer (yet). It also works well as an action movie. Imaginative action scenes are partly quite brutal but it just emphasizes movies dystopia. Beautiful Elysium is pleasant to watch and it highlights it's difference to slummy Los Angeles. Gap between privileged citizens of Elysium and poor people of earth is breathtaking to watch. Clever social criticism is narrated very strongly and evocative story works beautifully together. With it length of less than two hours the story works great. Movie doesn't stop until the story is told. It would be perfect movie if action scenes were filmed with still cameras. Manual shooting is partly quite hard to follow. Matt Damon is great at Max but Jodie Fosters Delacourt stays little lame. Elysium is imperative to see for everyone who loves clever sci-fi movie. I will wait with great interest Neil Blomkamps next movie. Great summer entertainment.,9,4,13,10 August 2013
La La Land," Perfect old fashion musical
","Opening scene of La La Land is spectacle. It is good to see, that there is still a place for a old kind of musicals. Without a doubt La La Land is a classic and it promise a good for upcoming Hollywood musicals. La La Land is one of the best movies of 2016 and it will pick many Oscars next February. It is not a realistic movie, but it as a musical it is a perfect hit. If you don't have a two weeks lasting earworm after this movie it is a miracle. Story is sweet but not too sweet and the ending is bittersweet. Something to expect from Hollywood's dream factory.Emma Stone's and Ryan Gosling's chemistry works and feels right. Even La La Land is quite old fashion movie it is well done and feels fresh. It is a kind of movie that you wish to see many more in the future. It is must movie for all romanticist and all the people who want to watch old fashion musicals. Perfect Sunday entertainment.",10,3,10,5 March 2017
Beauty and the Beast," Tale as old as Time...
","You can have many opinions about movie remakes. It is true, that many times remakes are stupid and vain and many times they flop simply because of their contradiction in terms. So is Beauty and the Beast remake legitimate? Absolutely yes. Movie is a thoroughbred true musical and many musicals are very populated in theaters all around the word and people travel to see them in many theater cities around the world. There is no reason why we can't enjoy the new version of Beauty and the Beast. With the new technology movie has brought back so beautifully. It's legendary themes sounds so lovely and familiar, that even new generation can enjoy it's magic and luxury. Also the movie characters are now more profound and therefore more interesting even for more adult audience. Beauty and the Beast takes it's audience from very beginning to it's magical world and entertains it's whole audience. Movie follows almost exactly the original movie concept. Most of the time it works, but not all the time. Especially at the middle of the movie 'Be my Guest' song is little too blurry and childish and could be replaced with better scene. That doesn't bother too much and movie maintains it's magic.Emma Watson as Belle manages her role very well and surprises with her talent to sing. Dan Stevens has make-up almost unrecognizable, but digitally created monsters face and eyes are brought to screen so lively and humanly as possible. Strong story, great characters and Alan Menken's score is so beautiful watch and hear, that it sensitize even strongest viewer. Remake of Beauty and the Beast is very well done update of original Disney classic.Tale as old as time True as it can be Barely even friends Then somebody bends Unexpectedly Just a little change Small to say the least Both a little scared Neither one prepared Beauty and the beast",9,4,9,22 March 2017
The Shape of Water," Not something I waited from Guillermo del Toro
","Guillermo del Toro knows how to make visually beautiful scenery to silver screen and The shape of Water makes no mistake. Movie is beautifully set it's visually effects outstanding. The story is also interesting even it is a little too straightforward. Now, when Oscar's are out I dare to make some criticize too. The story it self is quite lame and unbelievable love story. OK, it is a fairy tale, but somehow a love story between fish and a woman is quite stupid. Even the end scene won't surprise you and that is something not to expect in Guillermo del Toro's movie.Sally Hawkins makes her role credibly and that with movie set is the most impressive in this movie. Set is beautiful and looks like many fantasy movies from -50's fantasy movies. Directing is good, but nothing special. Somehow I just waited something more from del Toro.Even movie has well-earned it's Oscars, to me it left a little lame feeling. To me it surely is not the best movie of last year, but who am I to disparage movie academy's choice.The Shape of Water is dreamlike, beautiful and watchable movie. Old fashion scenery and story telling may not satisfy all the viewers, like not me.If you want to watch old fashion fantasy movie of love between fish man and mute woman you may even like it. To me it was just too lame. I just expected more of Guillermo del Toro movie.",5,7,17,20 April 2018
Kong: Skull Island," Surprisingly entertaining
","To be honest, I didn't expect much about Kong: Skull Island. Actually I was just waiting to see pretentious effect rumble movie. I was glad to see I was wrong. Of course the biggest thing in this movie are great CGI-effects, but surprisingly there is something more too. There is some great ragging to Americans about Vietnam war and also a reminding that sometimes it is better to let earths nature to alone or we might face even bigger problems in future. Quite clear parable to climate change and present human kind. Even movie has these 'deeper meanings' it is fundamentally funny and stupid effect rumble movie. Of course there is also that Beauty and the Beast aspect, like in every Kong movie.The storytelling and movie action are thrilling and great to watch. Some great evergreen songs slates movie action and cgi-effects greatly and quite enjoyable way. At the beginning of the movie it is very clearly who are the bad guys of yhe story and earn to get killed by Kong. Actually Kong is the stories Biggest lonely hero (in all way), who keeps safe the rest of Island inhabitants.Although the story is quite stupid and brainless effect rumble, it has it's good moments too. Crazy scenes is easy to laugh and in many way they are the best part of the movie. CGI-effects are great and in their silliness surprisingly believable. Director Jordan Vogt-Roberts has created very enjoyable neoromanticism Kong-story in quite old fashion way. The biggest lesson of the movie is that the human is the biggest monster of the nature and they should learn their lesson, before we have to face even bigger catastrophe. Kong: Skull Island is very entertaining CGI movie and well done new Kong story.This movie is in it's best when you watch it from big screen. 3D works well and is well worth of a movie ticket price.",8,8,15,11 March 2017
The Hobbit: The Battle of the Five Armies," Reprise from L.O.T.R. just collecting more money from audience
","Peter Jackson's Hobbit has been gorgeous to watch, even it has been too recursive. I think it would be better if studio would change director to Guillermo Del Toro as they first intend to do so. It should give a little bit different angle to story. Now Hobbit seems to be a reprise from Lord of the Rings. Also to cut up a quite short book to three chapters feels like just making more profit out of it. Now Battle of Five Armies feels just over length end battle and main character, Bilbo Baggins stay more like a statistic in this movie. HFR brings staging out brilliantly, but the same time it feels more like a theater staging and it doesn't look any more realistic. Most of film is just digitally effect rumble and that left the story too lame. 3D works well as it should be in any animation filming. Beautiful to watch but too over length story telling. It is shame that studio wanted to collect money too much from the fans of movie series. I don't wonder why the heirs of Tolkien's don't want to give any more stories to film, especially if Peter Jackson is involved with it. Hopefully they give rights to some another studio to film more stories from Middle-earth and audience will get more and better stories to watch.",5,0,2,25 December 2014
Murder on the Orient Express," Quite enjoyable, but not perfect
","Murder on the Orient Express is on of the Agatha Christie icons. Even there are several filming of it, both to small screen and silver screen, the story is here what makes it classic. Middle sized budget filming new version has still been quite big success and most likely we will see more Agatha Christie filming near future. Perhaps next is Death on the Nile for what they hint at the end of the movie.A lot of famous actors and actresses, old fashioned drama and good screen write makes it enjoyable to watch in a middle of all digital effect rumble movies. Even the story has told many times and you know how it will end, it is still enjoyable to watch this kind of old fashioned drama. Only one thing doesn't feel quite right. Somehow Kenneth Branagh don't impress enough as Hercule Poirot. Maybe he is too young to be Poirot or maybe it is that he can't act enough of Poirot's accent. Despite of this little blemish, Murder on the Orient Express is very enjoyable movie. Scenery at Istanbul is beautiful. Dramatic mountain views makes some tickle feeling for crime story. Scene at the end of the movie 'The Last Supper' is quite dramatic and metaphorical and it ties story telling nicely together. Even you know the ending the movie is very enjoyable old fashioned crime drama.",8,0,2,25 December 2017

","The Secret Life of Pets surprises you very satisfyingly at the very start. Movies visuality is enormous and the silhouette of New York is stunning. I have visited in New York few times and I instantly start to the Big Apple. Animal characters are very clever and well fulfill. Script is quite straightforward and used many times, but the visuality of the movie forgives a lot. 3D is beautifully used and you can wait some roller coaster ride between skyscrapers. Many characters, especially dog characters feels familiar, especially if you have ever owned a dog. Nostalgic music makes you feel familiar and patch up some flaws at script. Movie is so full of particulars that you certainly can enjoy this many time. If there is something to accuse, the script is quite simple and used many times and you could get much more out of the communication between animal characters and humans. More laugh out of that. After all The Secret Life of Pets is quit enjoyable despite some lack to all audience.",8,8,14,8 August 2016
Arrival," Not enough entertainment to me
","Without honest Arrival is a kind of movie that critics like. To me it is too familiar and feels old fashion. The theme of Arrival has been be tangent in some Star Trek episodes and because of that it doesn't feel fresh idea to me. Arrival is a good movie, but somehow predictable and way too slow. As an episode of a television series it might work, but as a two hour movie it is simply too long. Even plot feels somehow clumsy. If you want to make serious science fiction film sappy romance won't be a part of it. Especially when chemistry between lead actors doesn't feel right in any level. End scene of the movie is also stupid and hasty. There is no real meaning for the aliens and suddenly they just disappear???. Beside all that Arrival is a quite good movie. It is not bad, simply too long and slow. It is a kind of movie that make movie critics pee honey. I am sorry to say that Arrival is not movie to me, even probably many people likes it. Arrival may be a good movie at a certain kind of mind state, but to me it didn't work well enough.",7,1,5,5 March 2017
The Conjuring," excellent encomium to old and classic horror movies
","The Conjuring is stylish old fashion horror movie. It is strange combination of The Amityville horror and The Exorcist. Movie doesn't invoke digital effects and macabre violence like so many present horror movie does. It acquiesce more traditional horror effects. Suspension tightens stylishly up to the end and there is surprisingly lack of blood to be a horror movie. Picture of the 70's time is staged elegantly and it brings eccentric old feeling to this movie. Brooding tense is created cleverly using dark, waiting and suitable horror element. Sound and picture telling feels like straight from the best 70's and 80's horror movies. The Conjuring is stylish old fashioned horror movie, the one you don't want to watch alone at remote farm house in a dark fall night. The Conjuring is excellent encomium to old and classic horror movies. Hopefully there will be more horror movies like this in the future.",9,0,2,23 August 2013
Black Panther," Just lame Marvel production.
","The deluge of Marvel movies starts to be a little tire. Massive super hero movies are mainly so bare empty. In this category Black Panther makes no exception. It doesn't differentiate any way between all grandiloquent Marvel movies. Concept it self is quite ok, but the story itself is so boring and lame. Technically Black Panther is well done and it looks great on screen, but use of 3D is just nonsense. Even it is great to see a superhero movie with just black actors, the conclusion feels too underline and pointing, which hardly is what the makers wanted.Movie also feels too vain and clearly it has just made to underlay upcoming Avengers movie. It only purpose is to introduce new character to audience, so they don't have to do it at Avengers movie.Black Panthers massive budget of 200 million dollars gives you some beautiful scenery but nothing else. Stan Lee makes his cameo in this movie and that feels the most funniest part of the movie.Visually Black Panther is guaranteed Marvel production. As a brisk action movie it finds it's audience for sure, but at Marvel universe it is incorrigible tail end.",4,2,3,20 April 2018
The Greatest Showman," Good but could be better
","The Greatest Showman is visually eventful and very entertaining movie. Music scenes are big and well done. Hugh Jackman is very charismatic as P.T Barnum and Zac Efron isn't just handsome, but can sing too. Their joint musical number, The Other Side, is breath taking to watch. All the other musical numbers are superior, especially freaks This is me is outstanding. Over all everything seems to be in right place in this movie, but... Dramaturgy of movie is too straightforward. Everything seems to happen too easy. From rags to riches, getting arrogant, back to the bottom and get up again just happen, without any drama. Movie could be little longer and added more drama to feel more realistic. After all it is not a bad movie at all. It is visual, speedy and rhythmical movie. It sounds and looks great. Great acting, fine casting and well execute music numbers are great to watch. Clumsy script and lack of drama is still too verity.",7,3,5,13 February 2018
Thor: The Dark World," Great comic book adaption
","Thor: The Dark World is a great superhero movie which combines elements from fantasy and scifi movies. There is enough surprise moment and humor to keep it ongoing and sustainable. Movie lends shameless elements from Star Wars and Lord of The Rings movies and combines them together to an original adventure. Movie looks and sounds beautiful. Bouncing between different dimensions could easily be confusing but director Alan Taylor keeps them tightly together. Even the length of the movie is suitable, less than two hours, which is great remittance despite all the action and scenery. That ensures that you won't get bored and movie rumbles through it's duration like fast train. Balance between humor and drama is great in spite of some murky moments. It is good to see that Marvel takes good care it's movies and combines finely different productions. That ensures nice comic feeling in their movies. Unquestionably Thor: The Dark world is Marvel's elite in these comic book adaptions. The end of the movie promises more sequels for this sledge hammer hero. I just hope they have more courage to bring elements from Asgard mythology in upcoming sequels. That would make this even more enjoyable movie experience. Hemsworth is good choice as Thor but Natalie Portman's role leaves a little bit too easy. Great entertainment no matter what.",9,6,13,2 November 2013

It contains all the elements that made the original story so epic. It tells an epic story with great scenery and with fine action and adventure. The Force Awakens is like a reboot of an original story, but the same time it is clearly continuation to an original saga. The story and characters are written well. Actors and actresses get through greatly at their roles. No one feels lame or factitious. The story is clearly a tribute to Han Solo, but at the same time it brings new characters well present. Maybe only one thing is not perfect. The story serves background stories of some characters almost too easily and dish out them with no big surprise which made the original movie so epic. The original story was actually a soap opera of one family. There are some elements in this story too, but they are reveled almost too easily. Greatly the story leaves enough of loose ends, so probably we will get bigger surprises of the characters later at upcoming movies.Star Wars: The Force Awakens is loyal to its fans and it lacks of prequels plastic look. It looks familiar, but at a same time it is fresh and interesting. Iconic characters are brought back honorably, but at a same time it tells a new story with new characters. It offer a nostalgic and new epic adventure at same package. Great script offers enough of action and adventure. It almost feels like George Lucas says: 'This is what the Star Wars meant to be'.J.J. Abrams manages to refresh Star Wars saga to present day without forgetting the original fans. It almost feels like I was again that 12 year old boy at 1977, who watched the original story 13 times in two weeks.I watched this movie first time in 2D, but I will watch it again and next time I will see it at 3D, so I will add later to this review how 3D worked in this movie.",9,138,288,16 December 2015
The Hunger Games: Catching Fire," Way better than Hunger Games
","Catching Fire works much better as a movie, than Hunger Games did. http://tinovalkki.blogaaja.fi/the-hunger-games-catching-fire-2013/Hunger Games focused on more teenage romance such like Twilight movies. Catching Fire trusts more social criticism and action. There could be more social criticism but even like this movie brings enough out subsurface smoulder rebellion. Katniss grows in her role better as a face of a mutiny. Jennifer Lawrence as Katniss does manage her role way better than Josh Hutcherson as Peeta. Donald Sutherland endorse as President Snow. Action scenes are clever and excited. Violence has kept quite mild to ensure low age limit for the movie, but even like this they are brutal enough. Movie timing works perfectly and length of two and half hour do not feel too long. End scene could be better built, because now it feels a little too rapid and terse. On the other hand we already know that there will be third movie so that can somehow vindicate cliffhanger in this movie. Third movie will be divided to two parts, so we will let see does in feels same kind of capitalize on like Twilight did. Good movie anyway, can't wait to see Mockingjay.",8,3,21,24 November 2013
Godzilla," Great summer monster movie
","Gozilla is monster movie masterpiece. In the middle of all destruction is a valid story to tell. Monsters have feelings and that makes them more charismatic than average movie monster. You can feel sympathy for the huge monster. They have a story to tell in middle of all effect rumble and humanity's nothingness against natures forces is well told. Gozilla is shown as a hero whose destiny is to survive human kind. Aaron-Taylor Johnson is quite vacant as a human hero, but survives his role as a father and soldier quite well after all. 3D works, but it is quite vain because they don't use it more cinematic. Plain 3D landscape is not enough, that is why I drop one point from five to four. After all Gozilla is a great summer movie and even I enjoyed watch it.http://tinovalkki.blogaaja.fi/",9,5,10,3 June 2014
Life," Tries too hard to be next Alien, but fails...
","Life tries really hard to be next Alien. Life is not bad, but you hardly can compare it to classic like Alien. The biggest problem in the movie is monster itself. Found from Mars life form, which starts to kill space stations crew one by one. Everything is like in Alien, so what is wrong with it? Actually everything. Monster is too pretty to be horrified. It is too sleek and smooth and looks too digitally made, not scary at all. Besides the terror for crew is not grotesque enough. You hardly see blood and monster looks a little like octopus, too cute to be scary. It might sound corny, but in these days when you find many TV shows more graphic and violent, monster here and it's ways to kill staff is too sleek. Besides the international space station feels too big and doesn't feel any claustrophobia at all, like space craft in Alien.Still Life is not too bad at all. It's visuality is stunning camera run is breathtaking. It is too bad that this movie is not in 3D format. Space station looks quite realistic and spacewalk are very enjoyable to look. Even though Life is quite OK space monster movie, it hardy can compare classics like Alien. In some parts story starts to meander and fumble, but script is good enough to tighten the story back to basic. The end of the movie is more funny than scary. After all Life is quite descent space monster movie and it leaves great expectations for Alien Covenant movie. Hopefully at May we can enjoy great space horror flick, when Alien Covenant get it's release world wide.",7,2,7,10 April 2017
Deadpool," Hilarious and totally fresh
","Deadpool is hilarious news at superhero genre. Humor is fresh delightful. Violence scenes are not the wildest you have seen, but there is a blood enough in this movie too. Ryan Reynolds is great as a Deadpool and seems to enjoy at his role. Deadpool is not greater than life experience, but certainly it is fresh at Marvel series. There are a lot of hints to other Marvel movies and that makes it feel a little disoriented. It feels like a big action hero movie with a low budget at the same time, and that maybe is a reason it feels so fresh. Deadpool is very schematic comic book story made to silver screen. It doesn't offer lot of anything new, but there are a lot of very funny moments in it. It is full of obscene humor, but not enough to be tasteless. It certainly is not suitable for younger audience, but mature audience will enjoy it. Sequel had already announced and it will be interesting to see if they found something new to story. Hopefully Deadpool 2 will be as hilarious as this one. It gonna take a lot from screen writers, but if they manage of it movie may be even more hilarious than the first one. Deadpool is fresh and funny movie to an adult audience. Very entertaining and it feels all new at its genre.http://tinovalkki.blogaaja.fi/",9,3,15,1 March 2016
Kingsman: The Secret Service," Great entertainment
","Kingsman: The Secret Service is functional James Bond parody. As it's best parts it is clever as funnies Bond movies from -80's. In many ways it feels like Roger Moore Bond films. Funny, clever and harmless not too serious. It is not a perfect movie. Some of the scenes are too extravagant to take seriously and I hope that if there will be sequels script writers remember this. It is a eventful and funny but not very original. Harmless entertainment that works surprisingly well if you don't care too much some of the clichés. Nostalgic Bond parody but not big movie extravagant.",8,5,12,1 March 2015
Spectre," Guaranteed Bond adventure
","Spectre is more traditional and lighter Bond story than previous Skyfall was. Darkness of Skyfall has replaced with more classic Bond storytelling. There are a lot of exoticness, Bond girls, dry English humor and luxury, like it should be in Bond stories. Story is lighter than it was in Skyfall. Is that a good or bad thing? I leave conclusion to viewer. Personally I like more these airy spectacles. Spectacle start scene is massive, but Sam Smith's 'Writings on the Wall' is a little letdown.Villain of story. Spectre's leader (Cristoph Waltz) manages his role, but hardly stay in history as most vicious bad guy in Bond movies. Mr. Hinx (David Bautista) is like a copy of iron tooth (Richard Kiel), but even his role won't match for his paragon. Daniel Graig as a Bond is convincing as usually.Spectre has a lot of references to earlier Bond movies. There are white cat, ejection seats and spectacle chase scenes which will certainly satisfy older audience. On the other hand some of these scenes are too long and numb. Big picture is anyway very good entertainment. Spectre is obscenely entertainment and functional Bond adventure even it is not as satisfy as few previous Bond movies.",8,9,17,28 November 2015
Mad Max: Fury Road," Visually stunning average script..
","Mad Max is visually stunning film. Most of the movies special effects and stunts are real and you really can see it. Mad Max looks like a movie which won't produced any longer. Today most of the special effects are made with computers. Even the quality of today's CGI-effects still never looks so good like the old type explosions and stunts like they were done in this movie. Frank Millers visuality is beautiful to watch and movies red/brown landscape looks almost magical. Movie is full throttle action from start to finish. That can be a strength of this movie, but it is also the weakness of it. Because of all the action thru out entire movie it's ending won't blow your mind. Also there are some weakness in it's script. Script isn't very clever but it's weakness is buried with all the action. Tom Hardy is good choice to play Mad Max even the story won't give to him much enough to shine in his role. Despite it's weakness in story Mad Max is still one of the best action movies this year so far. With better script it would be perfect.",8,4,13,29 May 2015
Warcraft," Fresh at it's genre
","Warcraft works surprisingly well to be a game movie. Even it has a lot of same visual as so many other fantasy movies does, there is still something original too. I was a little surprise that Duncan Jones took this movie to his helm, because earlier he has made much smaller, but great movies like 'Moon' and 'Source Code'. But maybe it is a good thing that they gave this movie to him and not to any worse director. Under all that bombast is some original too. On the other hand it feels more copyright holder kind of movie, than Duncan Jones movie. Maybe the massive budget has tight his hands. Anyhow Warcraft is quite nice and well done fantasy movie, which entertain even audience like me who has never played the game. The Beginning at movie title predicts that more Warcraft movies is on the way. Let just hope that they find someone as good director as Duncan Joness is to helm upcoming movies. Warcraft is fresh wiff at fantasy movie genre in between all those Hobbit and Lord of The Ring movies. For once Orcs has some own character and are something else than just killing machines. The even have feelings and that brings some originality to this movie.After all Warcraft originality won't carry the movie up to end. Maybe the studio bosses haven't enough courage to let director make the movie on his own. The story ends too easily and it underlay too much of upcoming Warcraft movies. Warcraft is fresh movie at it's genre and it could have been even more, if studio bosses had let Duncan Jones bring more originality to his movie. Not bad at all.",7,2,3,14 July 2016
The Martian," Great just great
","The Martian represent more realistic scifi movie to Ridley Scott than his Alien movies. Story may sound simple and boring, but it way more than that. Story has build to very solid thriller, kind of modern Robinson Crusoe survival story. Story keeps you awake entire two and half an hour time. Occasionally you almost hope that story would take more time to tell. It scientific side is executed with Nasa's co- operation and that makes it so realistic. Even it's survival story may sometimes feel a little unrealistic it still is great narration of human inventiveness and relentlessness to survive in hostile environment. Matt Damon is convincing in his role as astronaut Matt Watney. Maybe movie is sometimes trustworthiness because it won't tell anything about his loneliness in vast planet, but with story's humor and great nostalgic choice of music makes it more enjoyable.3D format is once more plea than normally. Harsh scenery of Mars looks great and it's vastness is breathtaking. Movie set is brilliant, crisp an very realistic. It is good that Mars has shown mostly at day time so framing won't get too dark and it's scenery looks great in 3D.The Martian is a great survival story which is at it's best when you watch it from big screen at movie theatre. Set design and scenery looks that great that there might be a change to get Oscar from it's visual effects next spring. Great choice of nostalgic music piece at the end crowns the whole story.As Gloria Gaynor sings 'And now you're back from outer space...I will survive' the movie ends.",9,3,9,10 October 2015
Furious 7," Great action with descent script, fine tribute to Paul Walker (R.I.P.)
","Fast and Furious 7 is brilliant ending to a great turbo action packed movie saga. It is also a fine example that it is possible to combine full throttle action with descent movie script. Furious 7 is loyal to previous movies and it's script combines finely the whole saga. Movie is full with total mad action scenes, but it also tells a good story of family love and revenge. First scene of the movie is brilliant as it's simplicity. The whole movie is a great encomium to Paul Walker who died before finishing all shooting of the film. You almost want to see more, but it is good to end before it is too late. Jason Statham is great as a bad ass and Vin Diesel is as good as he can be. This effect rumble is great honor to Paul Walkers memory and brilliant end to one of the most turbo-action packed movie saga in cinematic history. I just love it...",9,1,4,5 April 2015
