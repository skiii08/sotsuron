Alien 3," Alien vs Studio
","I've read some heavy criticism of this movie before I had seen it. When I did see it, I was not particularly impressed. I had Alien and Aliens on videotape and somehow they got stolen.So when the Quadology became available reduced from £70 to £15 with the Theatrical Releases as well as the Directors cut versions and all the making of documentaries I thought what a bargain.I feel sorry for the first time director on this movie as the whole plot of the third movie sounded ridiculous in the first place and sounded more a like a comic-book short story.The studio constantly wanting and making changes to the script on a daily basis and interfering with the shoot itself, would and could not let Mr Fincher direct the film the way he wanted to.After repeated watching, the final version of the film if it were not a sequel would, I feel not stand up as film on it's own. It's too dark and slow moving and the other 'monsters', i.e. the prisoners you really only just start to know them when they start dying.Give it whirl though. You might enjoy it like Marmite or Vegamite, I say yuk, you may say yummy.Men in Suits eh?",6,0,0,22 August 2009
Transformers," Cack!!!
","I remember the cartoons from the 80's and they were not particularly good compared to say Battle of the Planets. The cartoon was basically about shifting units of toys. The toys themselves looked pretty good. Like He-Man and others of that ilk it was all about being bright and flashy with nothing to engage young minds. I watched this film on Film4 at 9pm. Why they chose this time to show, what is basically a children's film is beyond me. The humour was stale and dragged out and schoolboy level. I love action movies, but this was by the numbers Hollywood pap. Lots of bang for your buck, but no story to speak of. Dire. This movie sums up what is wrong with Hollywood action movies these days. Too much reliance on special effects and hardly any story. Now I know why people groan when they hear a movie is being directed by Michael Bay.",2,6,12,13 December 2010
