Requiem for a Dream," If you really admire movies this must be in your top 10 list.
","I've seen this movie after 13 years and I am certain that this movie is one of the best of this century. From the story to the performances everything was amazing.I've heard a lot about this one but never expected that this one will be so grand. The story of the movie was scarily beautiful.The direction was amazing, the performances by Ellen Burstyn and Jennifer Connelly were so live. After watching Jennifer's performance in Blood Diamond I became a fan of her but now after watching this movie I'm literally in love with her and her acting. She was WOW!This one is a must watch, you'll like this movie as much as I did no matter what genre you're into. Thank you Darren Aronofsky and everyone involved with this masterpiece. 100 minutes of pure entertainment.",9,0,1,19 October 2013
