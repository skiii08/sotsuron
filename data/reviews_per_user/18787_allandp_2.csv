Hereditary," Spiritualism and witchcraft - burn in hell
","How do you create a suspenseful but ultimately pointless, run-of-the-mill movie? This is how.I had no expectations, just saw a 7.3 IMDB rating for a horror-ish movie and was intrigued.The camera work, lighting and effects as well as the acting from the actors are great, but I can't help but feel that there's just something wrong with the casting and the characters of the children.Hobo clothes and wet look, they're casted to be younger-than-they-really-look. It annoys me a bit from the get go, but I lean back and tell myself to look past these annoyances to enjoy the unfolding of the story and plot.The story does twist and turn a bit by throwing rubble in the gears and a stick in the wheel, but I slowly realize that this is nothing more than another witchcraft movie.I don't know what it is about witchcraft movies that gets on my nerves... I just find it ridiculous, especially because they are often over-the-top stories instead of staying near the ground. This movie confirms the rule and it's just unbelievable.This movie is extremely overrated. It's a 5-6 depending of how you feel about witches.I'm gonna give it a 3 just because overrated movies are a menace to movie watching. Oh and 3 rather than one because of Toni and the better-than-average visual style.P.S. Maybe I'm just getting too old for IMDB? Naah, because I love Ash vs Evil Dead and that's both witchcraft, occult and fun, so this movie can just suck my boomstick!",3,4,7,23 June 2019

","Whoa. Poor short movie material stretched to 1h30m - good thing I skipped through this in 35-45 minutes, looking for the movie to live up to the rating.You really should never trust IMDB ratings or even metacritics, that's for sure. Even with all the real ratings in which people actually describe their excruciating pain of dragging themselves through this horrific movie, the rating is still 6.8 which should indicate an amazingly good horror (since they tend to score lower). That's NOT the case.I found the boy's acting INSANELY annoying which in itself breaks the movie. I'm usually most sensitive to bad acting in my native language, but everything from the dialog to the body language of the main characters is hugely annoying.However, the movie goes waaaay beyond in it's efforts to candidate for the title of worst movie ever.It could have been a good movie because of the psychological aspect, but the plot doesn't align with the story which results in a unengaging, bleek, lifeless and pointless utter waste of time.The setting in the house is unbelievable bleek which is obviously intentional, the light is sharp and cold, there's no warmth, no humor, no charm, no twists, no surprises, no satisfying scares, no food for thought and no merits really, except maybe for the visual effects which are pretty well executed. That's why I try and stay objective by rating it 2/10.I find it difficult to believe that anyone can be entertained by this piece of crap and I strongly advise that you spend your valuable time on something else.Just about any other movie will be better, I think.",2,0,2,25 February 2019
