The Blair Witch Project," not bad
","I just saw this movie on one of the TV movie channels, so I've been exposed to most of the hype, the initial attempt to portray the film as factual, and the revelation that it is fiction. I knew what to expect as far as the amateur home video quality of the movie, and the language, and I thought it was pretty good. Certainly there were imperfections, and at some points I couldn't help adding my own mst3k type comments, but considering the lack of money spent, I was very impressed by the amount of creep for the buck. There was a lot of bad language, but in character for 20ish college students, particularly when trying to be macho (even Heather)in the face of an increasingly frightening situation. If you are willing to be scared for entertainment, see Blair Witch Project. If you have to have elaborate special effects, or CG, to be entertained, don't.",7,0,1,28 March 2001
The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring," It could have been SO bad, and it was SO good.
","I guess I have to begin by saying that I have read the books, (I've lost count of the times), and I was (am) a real Tolkien geek, particularly in my teens, some years ago now. In the 70s I was favorably impressed with Bakshi's attempt (I know, I know, I'm sorry) but I think some parts were well done, for the money they had available, and I think Bakshi's heart was in the right place. The cutesy versions of The Hobbit and Return of the King were terrible. When I heard of the attempt to be made by Mr. Jackson (who?) to do a live action version I was, to put it mildly, not looking forward to it, although I knew I would feel obligated to go, and be tortured. Well, the first film is here, I went, and I loved it. I knew some parts would have to be modified, but the job they did was a miracle. It's not perfect, like the books <g>, but Mr. Jackson satisfied this Tolkien fan. To nitpick, I thought that the scenes in Farmer Maggot's field and Bree were not led up to or explained well, the Black Riders might have been explained better, and the stay in Lorien seemed to me a little too new-agey for me. Could I have explained it better? No way, at least not without adding a couple of hours, and most people seem to understand just fine. To those who haven't read the books, I think they make the movie better, whether you liked it or not. I wonder what it would be like to read the books for the first time after seeing the movie(s). This is probably not the best film of all time, it will doubtless come down a few places after the novelty has worn off, but I give it a solid 9.",Null,0,0,7 January 2002
