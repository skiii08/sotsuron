The Incredible Hulk," Underrated MCU gem
","Let me just say that almost everyone hates this film, just like all other Hulk solo films and MCU decided to make their own solo hulk movie to see if solo hulk does work out this time but it didn't because of people whining that this film is boring which is absolutely stupid this film is extremely entertaining and defines what the Hulk really is, with great final battle and good villain.
If people really would have liked this film a red hulk sequel was planned but got scrapped because of bad reviews of this part.",Null,0,0,19 January 2020
Man of Steel," Fatastically great film!
","I think this film is one of the best superman films ever and the second best DCEU film after Aquaman, it transforms superman from a superhero for babies with crap dialogue ( ' stop right there evildoer' 'I will stop you robber') to a superman for teenagers which is a great result and his origin fits perfectly.
Pros-greatly visualised fight scenes.
Extremely great ending.
Entertaining.
Great new personality change of superman
Awesome music.
Tells superman's origin story in the best, most efficient way.Cons-They should have found some other way to defeat Zod except for getting him killed by KAL.
Clark does not change his personality from a tough guy to a wimp as Clark Kent to keep his secret identity.But the movie is so good that I don't care a about the cons, its still great.",Null,4,5,19 January 2020
