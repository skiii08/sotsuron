Ford v Ferrari," Fantastique!
","How did this not win more awards?I am stupefied. This was an amazing tour de force of a movie.Bale & Damon knock it out of the racetrack.When they get to fisticuffs and Mollie brings out a chair & beer to watch. Gold simply gold!Whether completely true or not, this movie does not shine a good light on Ford or BeeBee. If their true actions were anything close to portrayed in the movie - they deserved every bit.Great movie. If I had more time - I would have watched it again!",9,1,3,9 March 2020
First Man," Snooze Fest
",Only got about half way through. Dry and boring. Not even Ryan Gosling could save this movie.,3,2,7,18 March 2019
It," That was creepy
",I don't much remember the mini series. But I found the movie high with the spook factor and the cast of rag tag teens enjoyable.Band together against bullies kiddies and maybe the scary monster won't get you!Worth the rental.,8,0,0,20 January 2018
If I Stay," Another revolution of a young adult novel made into film
","What would you do if your entire immediate family perished in a car crash? Would you choose to live or follow the light?That is the decision Mia is grappling with in her out of body experience.I take umbrage with several of the plot points though. The weather is sooo bad they cancel school, but the family decides to go out in their car sledding? WTH? See also not much snow on the ground when everyone arrives at the hospital!?Despite all that it was an enjoyable movie!",7,0,0,26 June 2017
Rocketman," Wow!
","Taron Egerton is a tour de force!Singing, Dancing, Costumes.This film has it all!Props to Elton and the film-makers for not holding anything back.All the grit and drama is shown.",8,2,2,2 December 2019
A Star Is Born," Blown Away - it's that good.
","Wowszer! What a great job all around by all the actors. Not to mention the music! It will stay with you for days, but in a good way.I did get slightly spoiled by something I read about the ending, but it didn't spoil the movie for me. Also I have never seen any of the other iterations.Check it Out!",9,1,4,4 March 2019
Darkest Hour," Gary Oldman's Oscar Winning Performance
",Historical film looking at the days of Winston Churchill's reign as Prime Minister of England.Even some people from his own party weren't onboard with his ideas.How he dealt with the circumstances he was dealt. An interesting peek behind the curtain.,7,0,3,12 March 2018
Captain Marvel," I enjoyed it..
","But Goose the cat, steals the show!This movie will make all the little girls of American want to become fighter pilots.I enjoyed the bits with Fury and Coulson.Brie as Marvel kicked ass & took names!",4,3,8,22 April 2019
Passengers," Could have been better
","Passengers was good but not great. The potential was there, the film was trolling along it was equal parts funny, romantic, space travel and then they don't show the ending. Just a simple sentence. They could have at least done a montage of clips illustrating what happened to the characters. Instead the viewer gets nothing and are left wondering... Not satisfying imho. Both actors were great. Jennifer Lawrence and Chris Pratt did amazing.",6,1,2,6 April 2017
Knives Out," Whodunnit Done Well!
","At some point I had my doubts but I ended up really liking this movie!The twists & turns kept coming, as did the one-liners. One of my favorites was CSI: KFC! Later there was a reference to Daniel Craig's Foghorn Leghorn accent.Such a cast of talented actors, but they each took their moment to shine.Bravo!",8,2,4,9 March 2020
Home Alone," Perfect viewing during the Christmas season!
","The music, the booby traps, the dysfunctional family memories during Christmas..This movie will make you laugh so hard you'll be rolling in the aisles!Perfect for viewing with the entire family.Be nice to your loved ones!",7,1,1,12 March 2018
Aquaman," Enjoyable
","Wow. Jason Momoa is easy on the eyes. That alone has brought many people to watch this film.The action, locales and fight sequences are all on point.A few times was I checking my watch and feeling as though it dragged a bit.But worth a rental!",7,0,1,13 April 2019
Deadpool 2," A sequel that delivers all the raunch and bawdry humor you didn't know you were missing!
",DP2 does it again. The action. The humor. The one-liners.It was all great. Several of the lines thrown at Cable aka Josh Brolin were fantastic. References to Goonies and Avengers had me rolling with laughter.Not your momma's superhero flick with heart.Did not disappoint.,9,1,3,7 June 2018
Thor: Ragnarok," Caution Teenage Boy Humor
","Mostly enjoyable flash, boom, bam popcorn flick.BUT and that's a HULK sized BUT some of the jokes were in poor taste. Lots of ASS jokes relating to Asgard. But naming the portal the Devil's Anus?Lots of fights, lots of humor, saving the world, yadda yadda yadda.Stan Lee's cameo was perfect!It's Marvel either you like it or you don't.Worth the rental if you're a fan!",6,0,4,19 March 2018
Ready Player One," So disappointing..
",Flash. Boom. Bam.The movie pales in comparison to the book.The audio version is also narrated by Wil Wheaton (bonus nerd points).The majority of the plot lines I was so excited seeing make it to the big screen did not make it to the big screen. For whatever reason.They really ought to say inspired by the book as the final movie was no where near at the awesome level that the book was.Skip It.,4,1,2,22 July 2019
"I, Tonya"," Fire & Ice
","Fantastic train wreck that you absolutely cannot look away from.What the true story is, I doubt we'll ever know.Allison Janey received the Oscar for playing Tonya's mother.Wacky & Delicious!",9,2,3,10 April 2018
Molly's Game," About so much more than poker
","Ah, the justice system at its finest.True life story and Jessica Chastain does an amazing job!",8,4,6,29 April 2018
BlacKkKlansman," Sad but True.
",The world would be a much better place if this movie was only fiction.Sadly the subject matter occurred and keeps occurring in this day and age.America needs to wake up and learn the true meaning of American Christian Values.In the end it is sad that the American voters have learned nothing.Racism is alive and well in the USA.,6,2,4,18 December 2018
Spider-Man: Homecoming," I really liked it!
","Wow. Some of the reviews are brutal.I liked it. It was entertaining. I enjoyed all the cameos of other Avengers. Captain America's videos interspersed throughout were quite comical. Tony Stark as a father figure... Well, let's just say he needs practice.Worth the rental if you are a fan.",9,12,19,27 November 2017
The Polar Express," Magical!
","As great as I remembered! The songs, the animation. I BELIEVE this is a great movie.",8,1,1,31 December 2019
Doctor Strange," One STRANGE movie
","True to the name this was one strange movie. Enjoyable, but on the odd side. Fantastic cast, I'll be interested to see where the next installment goes. Also points for Thor cameo in the ending credit scene. The CAPE stole every scene it was in - let's hear it for inanimate object acting! According to the trivia Stan Lee has a cameo reading an Aldous Huxley book on a bus, but I did not see it!",4,0,2,1 April 2017
"Three Billboards Outside Ebbing, Missouri"," Don't Anger Momma...
",Dark and profanity laced movie that holds nothing back.Raw emotion and situations that no one would want to deal with.Vigilante Justice...right or wrong is at the forefront of the movie.Oscar winning performances by Sam Rockwell and Frances McDormand.Great movie only flaw - I am not a fan of the ending/non-ending.Otherwise top notch.,9,1,4,19 March 2018
Lion," Roars into your heart and soul
","WOW! What an epic movie and true life to boot. How this did not win any Oscars is beyond me. Such emotion that all the actors portrayed. Heart wrenching scenes, make sure you have tissues close at hand; you will need them several times throughout the movie. Then the ending, is there such a thing as a happy gut punch? During the credits are real life video and images of the family portrayed in the movie. Fantastic movie with emotion and epic vistas. Unbelievable and I cannot wait to read the book the movie was based on.",9,5,5,23 April 2017
Ant-Man," Supporting Cast Brings the Laughs!
",Good. Solid. Comic Movie.Rewatched in preparation for the second movie.Enjoyable again.,8,0,2,4 March 2019
10 Things I Hate About You," You want me to date the shrew?
","Updated teenage romp of William Shakespeare's The Taming of the Shrew.Most known for Heath Ledger's starring role. His foil is Julia Stiles, as the shrew who doesn't give a fig what anyone thinks of her. Also stars: Joseph Gordon-Levitt, Larisa Oleynik, David Krumholtz, and Andrew Keegan.If you've never seen this you should take a look, it will take you back to the 90s in clothes and music! The soundtrack is also worth a listen.",8,0,0,26 June 2017
Bohemian Rhapsody," Rami Rocked!
",Oscar Worthy!Once again the music of Queen will be introduced to new generations!Great background of Queen & Freddie Mercury.,8,2,4,26 February 2019
Baby Driver," Hits all the right beats!
","I absolutely loved this! From Edgar Wright, the director of Shaun of the Dead and Hot Fuzz. Right from the jump the soundtrack is what drives this movie (pun intended).In my opinion music can either make or break a movie and this one has a killer soundtrack! Not a bad cast either!Fully enjoyable and definitely recommended. According to the extras very little cgi all the car stunts were filmed live.",9,0,5,27 November 2017
Justice League," Disappointing
","Such great characters, such great source material. Yet, the DC movies continue to be underwhelming. Ugh. Superheroes with temper tantrums does not make for a good movie.Get it together DC!",3,1,2,10 April 2018
Footloose," Great 80s Flick!
","Small town America where dancing is banned. New kid in town conquers high school, catches the eye of the preacher's daughter and attempts to plan a school dance.Such fantastic music! Kenny Loggins in his prime!!",8,13,13,5 February 2018
Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse," Surprisingly Good!
","I was amazed at how much I liked this movie. With the words splashing up on the screen, the comics really come to life. Who knew we needed a Spider-Pig...Peter Parker has always been a teenager, but Miles is a teenager that speaks fluent Spanish with black and Hispanic roots!A+ all the way around. Lots of charm and heart wrapped in a comic book package.",9,0,0,4 June 2019
Dunkirk," Historical Blather
","Put me into a history coma. I really was excited to watch this, but it left me out in the cold and clueless.Unless you are really interested I would skip it.",3,2,3,16 January 2018
Jackie," Nothing again can ever be Camelot
","Natalie Portman channels Jackie fantastically. The music is eerie, haunting and at times annoying. Please remember this is not fiction in its entirety! While the film does use actual footage of events that occurred, parts are embellished and greatly fictionalized. Great job by everyone involved.",7,0,1,3 April 2017
Yesterday," I really wanted to like it.
","Well the music was good. But we really already knew that didn't we!This movie was such a slow burn in places, it was like molasses.Cute. But not the star quality film I was hoping for.",4,3,4,10 February 2020
Avengers: Endgame," Not so super...
","Ugh. This three hour opus did not need to be three hours.Sure, it had moments. I love you 3000 being a stellar one. America's ass being another.But mostly ick. Still I watched it as I have been a fan of the rest. Glad I waited for it to come out on dvd.",5,1,7,4 September 2019
Dirty Dancing," She's Like the Wind
","This movie has stood the test of time. Jennifer Grey and Patrick Swayze make movie magic with the sultry dance moves. The choreography and the music make this a ride you will not want to get off of. Now considered a cult classic, it has spawned a television series, Broadway production and most recently a remake (that was horrific). Fantastic piece of celluloid history that ought to be revisited every now and again.",10,20,24,30 May 2017
Gone with the Wind," Rotten Georgia Peach
","Jeepers! What awful characters.Four hours of death, trickery, and lust for someone else's husband.Ugh.. A classic is may be, but not my cup of tea!",5,2,14,29 January 2018
Mamma Mia!," Abbalicious!
",A fantastical trek through the Abba song catalog starring some great actors!You will be tapping your toes and singing along for the entirety of the film!,9,0,0,4 December 2018
Toy Story 4," Better than I thought...
",I actually ended up liking this more than I thought I would!I knew the ending and I still cried!Woody & Buzz have touched generations of kids & adults!,8,0,0,27 October 2019
Wreck-It Ralph," Ralph Rocks!
",I watched this in preparation for the second Ralph and I have to say I did not remember the plot of this movie at all!It was like seeing it for the first time.Just as enjoyable meeting Ralph & friends for the second time.I can only hope the second one is just as enjoyable.,8,1,1,18 March 2019
Bridesmaids," Bawdy, Raunchy Humor
","Funny, just go in knowing the humor gets very blue at times. This was a rewatch and I did not remember several of the scenes. A good majority of the actors are now quite a bit more famous than when this movie was filmed.I would watch Chris O'Dowd read the phone book! Check out The Sapphires if you are a fan of his.",6,0,1,18 September 2017
The Favourite," Beyond Bizarre!
","So weird.I know, I know it won Oscars and all three leading ladies were nominated. But Oh My Goodness!The music was so irritating and at points even grated on my nerves.Unless you are a really big fan of the actors I would skip this.",2,3,7,10 April 2019
Avengers: Infinity War," Oh Snap!
","Bless their hearts they tried.Everything you expect in a superhero movie:Big Bad Villian
Superheroes Galore
Big CGI BattlesThen the other shoe drops...Just about everyone dies. Was that really necessary? Especially when they are going to bring most of them back eventually...I think not.I for one like my Avengers working together and getting along.All the hogwash about them not speaking to one another is bull.Marvel needs to get it together for the next one!On the whole entertaining...just a little disappointing...for what could have been.",7,1,4,17 June 2018
Once Upon a Time... in Hollywood," Was there a story?
",WTF was that?At almost three hours long there should have been a story.It seemed blathering to blather.I guess I am one of those that don't get it.The only thing enjoyable was the ending. Finally some action!,1,8,11,19 January 2020
Get Out," Meet the Parents with Horrifying Twist
","This movie lived up the hype. Fantastic, entertaining and thought provoking.The time has come for Chris, a young black man to meet his girlfriend's (Rose) white family. They are polite and seem to be warm, but there are some things that Chris just can't put his finger on. Oddities repeatedly bubble up and something is definitely amiss with the two black servants, but what Chris just can't pinpoint.Strap in for a wild ride! The ending oh the ending. I will never think of TSA the same way again.",8,9,17,3 July 2017
Aladdin," Why was this necessary?
",Oh Disney. Why. Oh Why?Will Smith...is no Robin Williams.I can't fathom other than money why a live remake was necessary.The only redeeming quality is that Jasmine is a badass. Her song about not being silenced was epic. But not enough for the whole movie to be made.,2,1,1,2 December 2019
The Lion King," Deserves to be Banished!
",Horrible. Simply Horrible.They took a 90 beloved animated classic with fantastic visuals & Elton John songs & bloated it to 120 minutes by taking out all the good things.WTH?This is why remake after remake is a bad idea.,1,5,6,2 March 2020
Call Me by Your Name," Love is an Enigma wrapped in a Riddle
",The two players in this game of love are Elio and Oliver. Timothee Chalamet and Armie Hammer. Over a summer of will they or won't they express their feelings for one another. Elio is the teenage son of an Italian professor and Oliver is the visiting grad student.The emotion is raw and the music drives the emotional feeling throughout the film. You will never look at a peach the same way after this film and you also may desire apricot juice.Good film overall with emotional lilting music that will stay with you long after the movie is over. If you can't handle a movie with gay themes I'd suggest you stay away. You only need to look at the homophobic reviews for evidence.,9,1,5,26 March 2018
Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Men Tell No Tales," Enjoyable foray into the franchise
",I don't know that I even remember much of the initial movies but I enjoyed this one. My expectations were not all that high as this is the fifth or so installation in the franchise. It was great fun seeing original cast members return for their various cameos! Overall worth the rental and if you like the characters and franchise you will most likely enjoy the movie. Not the bottom of the heap nor the top of the shelf but somewhere firmly in the middle.,7,0,1,16 November 2017
Coco," Fantastico!
","The music, the colors, the dancing were all epic!The story of Miguel and his love of family and music. Music is pulling at his soul to the worry of his family.Miguel goes on a journey to discover what family really means and to help his Mama Coco remember times gone by.Don't Miss - Perfect for the whole family!You will be singing the songs for weeks after viewing!",9,0,1,12 March 2018
Star Wars: Episode VIII - The Last Jedi," Disappointing..
","Several problems in the film.Characters doing and saying things that come out of left field.Questions not fully explained, yet more earth shattering questions asked.Plot holes galore!It was a hot mess. But a hot mess that is a cash cow, so they will keep making them.Sad to see a great franchise go to the trash dump.",3,19,26,16 April 2018
Guardians of the Galaxy," Fantastic!
","Scruffy Nerf Herders out to save the galaxy!Chris Pratt buffed up to play Peter Quill part Indiana Jones, part Han Solo, all the way bad ass who ends up leading the rag tag team of space criminals to save everyone.The music is phenomenal, as is the dialogue. The one liner fly by as fast as phaser blasts!",9,1,2,21 September 2017
Hotel Mumbai," Intense & Horrific
","Yowszers! Most of the movie, I was left thinking - I can't believe this really happened. How did any of them survive?",5,2,5,1 July 2019
Puss in Boots," Puss gets a starring role
","First seen in the Shrek franchise, Puss in Boots gets his own hero story in this Dreamworks Film.Most of the film is indeed funny. Antonio Banderas and Salma Hayek voice feline foes and tangle with sword and tongue heartily throughout the film. Funny, but not worthy of repeated viewing.",6,0,0,19 June 2017
The Shape of Water," Interesting...maybe that's the word..
","How to describe the movie?A mash-up of many genres. Science Fiction, Romance, Spy, Noir....A fairy tale for adults with sexual elements, perhaps...As I sat down the woman next to me advised a couple of friends told her it wasn't very good and then during the viewing of the film a senior woman exclaimed well this is just ridiculous!I like the film. The actors all did great jobs. But it was well out there to say the least. Towards the beginning of the film the lead character masturbates in her bath tub. From that point you know sex is going to be a theme.I enjoyed it, but I don't think it will win the Oscar for best picture.If you go be ready for solo sex and mermaid sex.The music was fantastic as the minor dancing done by some of the actors emulating Hollywood dancers of yore.Worth a rental if you have an open mind and enjoy fantasy/sci-fi.",8,26,46,22 February 2018
The Disaster Artist," So bad it's good!
","Only one problem I now have a hankering to view The Room!So it's a film within a film within a film. How did James Franco accomplish all that without going bonkers?An interesting look at the real life film making buddies that made one of the worse movies ever made.Tongue in cheek, this movie pulls all the punches on itself.Entertainingly funny.",6,1,2,26 March 2018
Joker," Ick..
","There didn't seem to really be an understandable story. Maybe there was at the end, but by that time I was snoring.Apparently the ending was quite the to-do but the film didn't hold my attention the whole way through. You know it's a bad sign when you are checking constantly to see how much of the film is left.Two hours I'll never get back.Great transformation by Phoenix losing 50+ pounds, but a great movie does take a bit more.To me it was a jumbled, confused, depressing mess.",1,9,20,23 January 2020
12 Strong," Mediocre
","Great story, but the movie was not riveting the way it could have been.But man, Chris Hemsworth could read the phone book and it would be visually appealing.Unbelievable story and next time I'm in NYC I'll look for the horse statue.",6,3,7,23 May 2018
Murder on the Orient Express," Take a ride with Hercule Poirot
","Murder on the train..Hercule Poirot attempts to solve the who, where, and why.A cast of characters portrayed by actors with many accolades.In the end good but not great.Worth it if you are a fan of Agatha Christie.",5,1,3,19 March 2018
Wonder Woman," Good not great
",I had such high hope! I mean I had wonder woman underoos!I don't remember any of the backstory at all from the television series of my youth..so did they just invent all of that for the movie or was it in the comics? Either way...mostly boring.Good action sequences but WW Diana was like a fish out of water. If I just kill him it will all stop... LAME!,7,1,3,13 November 2017
Black Panther," Mediocre for Marvel Expectations
","Ho-Hum. Ripped actors that want to tear each other apart.The best part of the film were the female actresses. Lupita Nyong'o, Danai Gurira, Letitia Wright, and Angela Bassett!Otherwise is was a lot of flash, boom, bang. Style but not very much substance story or otherwise.",3,1,1,29 May 2018
Mother!," WTF
","Well this was a waste of celluloid.None of the characters have names, they kind of simply moved about spouting lines that really didn't tract or entertain.Ugh, this was painful. I think I would rather have been at the dentist.",1,29,45,21 January 2018
Creed II," For the Rocky fans!
",Enjoyable if you are a fan of the franchise.The remixed scores of all the favorite music from the Rocky films was greatly enjoyed.The rap not so much.The beautiful ballet of boxing set to exquisite music.Worth the rental if you're a fan.Also great to see an old family character again!,4,2,4,7 May 2019
The Emperor's New Groove," No Touchy!
","The internet memes that are based on the movie might just be funnier than the movie itself. I don't automatically equate David Spade with Disney kid's movie for good reason. Parts were funny, but as a whole meh. It's taken me almost 20 years to see this movie & I didn't miss much...",3,1,3,28 April 2020
The Greatest Showman," What a spectacle!
","Fantastique!The music, the dancing, the aerial work!My only beef is the rather large age gaps between the two sets of leads. There 12 years between Hugh Jackman and Michelle Williams and almost 10 years between Zach Efron and Zendaya.Otherwise great.April 2018
Rewatched - just as great if not better! Also the extras on the dvd are fantastic!",9,2,5,15 February 2018
Pitch Perfect 3," Mostly on key and in tune!
","This is the third movie revolving around the Barden Bella acapella group.There is choreography and singing, but into the mix a little danger and international intrigue courtesy of Fat Amy's dad who wants to reconnect her for selfish purposes.The songs are good, it's great to see the gang back together again. The story, meh...it's the third one folks.Sing along, laugh and enjoy the frivolity. Worth the rental if you are a fan.",8,1,2,12 April 2018
Life," Fantastic Sci-Fi Horror Flick!
","Watch out Calvin will get you!Phenomenal cast. Yes, you have to suspend scientific belief about some things. But the scares are worth it in the end.A team of scientists & astronauts revive an extraterrestrial organism and then all manner of things go wrong and people begin dying.With several scenes including the ending that leave you squirming in your seat and screaming the movie lives up the horror genre.Worth a rental.",8,2,6,5 July 2017
Deadpool," Not your typical superhero movie
","With tongue firmly planted in cheek this movie takes shots at everything and everyone. No holds barred Deadpool is for adults.The holiday sex montage and the whole entire movie will make you laugh like never before.I recently rewatched the original in preparation for the deuce and enjoyed it just as much, if not more the second time around.Worth a view!",9,1,2,7 June 2018
Kingsman: The Secret Service," The ending ruined it
","This movie was fantastic the whole way through. Then they spoiled it with the ending. The movie ends with an anal sex joke. I understand it is 'R' rated but that in no way added to the story, it was just a trashy throwaway joke. Aside from the ending unpleasantness, all the actors did a great job. I highly doubt I'll be viewing the sequel though.",3,1,4,7 April 2017
Green Book," Great Film!
",From the writing to the acting everything was superb!They got everything correct in the period from the clothes to the cars and the music oh the music was diving.The Italian eating scenes has me rolling.Great movie. Not to be missed.,9,0,3,7 April 2019
Incredibles 2," Worth the wait!
","So good to so the Parr family back in action.I would have been great for them to fight crime all together for the whole film. Did they perhaps forget that lesson from the first film? Me thinks, so.Enjoyable if you are a Disney/Pixar fan.",8,1,2,25 June 2018
