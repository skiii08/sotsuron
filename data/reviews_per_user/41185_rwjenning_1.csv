Walk the Line," Where is Merle Kilgore?
","I have not seen movie yet but am disappointed that Merle is not listed anywhere in film credits. For those of you who are Johnny Come Lately's to the career of Johnny Cash, Merle was Johnny's best man at his wedding and co-wrote 'Ring of Fire' with June Carter. He was far more instrumental in the life and career of Johnny Cash than was Waylon Jennings.Mr. Kilgore began his career carrying guitars for Hank Williams. He was roommates with Elvis in the 50's and was a key player in the rise of popular country music. In addition to 'Ring of Fire' he penned a number of hits including 'Wolverton Mountain'.Merle passed away this past March and was a legend in the industry! Hats off to Merle!",Null,0,3,18 November 2005
