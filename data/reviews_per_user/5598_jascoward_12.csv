Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," Ughhh!
","On Sept 9 2019 I re-watched Episode 1. It was even worse than I remember. Some of the accents were deliberatly extreme. Asian for example. It's very hard to watch this as a serious film and not a farcical extravaganza. How do you go from the original trilogy, a masterpiece. To this which is a master piece of crap.",5,1,3,9 September 2019
Terminator Salvation," What's your deal yo!
","I do not get all the negativity. You want every future T director to just copy James Cameron.
Fun, creative, follows in the timeline. It's not perfect but did you see Genisys. That was abhorrent. This looks like the aftermath of an apocalypse. I dig it yo!",8,10,14,24 March 2019
Thor: Ragnarok," Four
","I've seen Ragnorak four times now and it is never not gnarly.
One issue.
Loki said he'd been there for two weeks and is friends with the Grandmaster.
Why does he look shell shocked and act as if he had no idea The Hulk was The Champion?",9,1,4,9 March 2019
Suicide Squad," Ughhhh!
",I tried so hard to like this New York sized dumpster fire. Its just so bad. And not the good kind of bad that becomes a cult classic. Its just sooo bad! The trailer was cool. So I guess that's something.,3,0,1,16 March 2019
Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse," Man!
",I can't believe I got emotional watching this man.,9,0,2,23 March 2019
Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse," Whoa. (Keanu Reeves voice)
","What brilliant way to incorporate an alternate comic book canon into a theatrical format.
I am in awe of all this.",9,0,2,23 March 2019
Terminator 2: Judgment Day," Linda Hamilton
",This is what a kickass woman looks like. A real female heroin. She would anhilate today's whiners. And she would look amazing while doing it.,10,5,5,9 November 2019
Terminator 2: Judgment Day," Perfect.
","The perfect sequel. Perfect acting. Perfect story. Perfect action. Perfect effects.
Did I leave anything out?",10,2,2,9 November 2019
X-Men: The Last Stand," Bummer
","I just rewatched it. If you could merge the best of the previous two with the best of from this one you would have a powerful film.
You can't blame Rather because he didn't make this project in a bubble. Multiple producers and reps from Marvel had a sat and input on it. Just like any other comic book project. The studio knew what the movie was months before it's release. So they are as much to blame if not more since they have all the power. It's just like the Fantastic Four reboot. They could have pushed the release date if they wanted to, but they thought they a quality project. I'm glad Dark Phoenix got pushed back. Hopefully, it's creator's saw room for improvement and did so. It may be last for a few major actors in the franchise, I hope they go out on a positive note.",6,1,1,12 March 2019
The Happening," S**t happens!
","Wahlberg woke up one day and said to himself 'I need a challenge'. He then calls his agent and tells him to find the worst script ever. His agent then goes above and beyond and delivers this gem.
The rest is history.",1,0,2,18 March 2020
X2: X-Men United," Nightcrawler
","It's one thing to exclude some characters from the big screen, but you include Nightcrawler in X2 and he is amazing. And then he disappears.
I say boo to you producers.",8,0,0,10 March 2019
300," This is Sparta!
",I just got a 65' smart tv and I am chilling like the proverbial villain. This masterpiece never disappoints.,8,3,4,13 April 2019
