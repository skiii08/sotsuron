Hereditary," Fans of cheap stay away
",A near perfect horror movie.. But if you're a fan a cheap jump shocks and fast paced constant expositions you will hate this ..,9,6,11,7 September 2018
Wind River," Good movie spoiled by shocking sound design
","Good movie overall but let down by really bad sound, volume button was getting a good workout for the majority of the runtime .. Super quiet voices, almost mumbling.. Did they not hear this in editing? Or should i say not hear !!",6,0,0,15 August 2018
Knives Out," A fun time ..
","I don't understand reviews that are 10/10 .. Shouldn't they be for mind blowers ?This movie is fun, its undeniably a well thought out clean piece of cinema . a ten no ..If your into who done its . go see it .. Its fun ..",7,10,26,29 November 2019
Star Wars: Episode IX - The Rise of Skywalker," Disney needs to sack the current team.
","I have just watched ep 7 of the Mandalorian, this one 30 minute episode had more heart, drama, style and meaning than TLJ and TROS.
The rise of skywalker is so bad its literally on a different level, TLJ was bad but not THIS bad, at times i felt like i was watching some sort of cross between scooby doo and the fast and furious .. And thats somewhat an insult to scooby doo.. It was nosensical rubbish, poor acting, dialogue and editing. The story telling was pathetic. I have never walked out of the cinema before, and would have walked if i had not been with family.
If the same team is involved in any Star Wars projects again i will not watch.
Absolutely pathetic ..
A travesty in movie making .. No talent.",3,23,39,21 December 2019
Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them," What is this tosh?
","Just who is this movie made for? It can't be for kids because its boring, it can't be for adults because again its boring, so i can only assume its for the hollywood studios to cash in on JK woke Rawlings Harry Potter fame.
A hideous mess of a movie which never holds your attention and doesn't give you anything interesting to do.
Not to mention Stephen Hawkins clambering all over the screen ... What was that poor man thinking playing Hawkins?! Talk about selling your soul to the devil.",2,1,1,27 March 2019
Climax," Climax - is everrything but.
","Maybe its just me or is is virtually impossible to get thought a Gaspar Noe movie without being bored to tears?I have failed to be impressed by Gaspar Noe now on every occasion, his movies just plod and draw without any creative flow, giving the viewer the odd kick of extreme violence or sexual brutality to stir the testosterone in aid to stop the warm tide of sleep just around the corner.Climax is no differnent, its all style over any substance and even then the style is reminisent of the poundland DVD section.And to those that bleat on about 'CINEMA EXPERIENCE' i would rather subject myself to a 24hr Trolls2 marathon than to 1 Gaspar Noe movie.I'm out.",3,2,6,25 February 2019
Once Upon a Time... in Hollywood," Oh dear .. A movie with no story
","Edit:On second viewing this movie is way better, not Quinton best by any means, but after having to survive TROS and Dark Fate.. This is a cinema master piece ..Slow and deliberate story telling, great performances.
I like it a lot.
How the mighty have fallen, 2hr 40mins slow with no story to note.. Just a few characters that do some stuff and have little back story.. Set in a what could be a parallel world alongside what really happened to Tate in reality.
Good performances from Pitt and Leo, and a decent scene when pit goes to the Manson lair.
Massively failed in the humour department and felt forced, for me it missed the mark, other movie goers laughed in places, but i just didn't find it even remotely amusing or witty.
Don't believe the hype and watch Pulp Fiction again, then ask yourself, what happened to Quinton?",7,6,15,15 August 2019
1917," Good, but could have been great.
","Undoubtably a very good movie.
In todays climate of trashy politically charded progressive agenda set pieces, this was a breathe of fresh air..
No gender baiting no race baiting just a story.
Well made and has some great imaginary, a stand out set piece was when our hero was entering a ruined town, the shadows and subtle almost subliminal imagines of German soliders gave expostion as to what was to come and the dangers that lay ahead.. it was masterfully filmed.. blink and you missed the.A few silly little plot holes here and there still didn't ruin the experience, the milk from the last cow in France that had survived German machine gun fire(obvious a set piece for the baby sence which was not needed) the none lesson our hero picked up from the second German that shopped him!! He actually HAD FOOD in his rigging, why was he chuntering on about have no food? The Enfield ammo clip he had only holds 5 rounds, he shot way more than that.. even the scene at the sniper in the building he fired more than 5 rounds without a reload.. im just picking now..Great movie no the less.. and those few points are just me being picky.",7,0,1,24 January 2020
