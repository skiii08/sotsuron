Scarface," This movie held my attention like no other.
","I don't know why but I could watch this movie as long as it is , over and over again. I think it is one of the best performances Pacino has ever done. He was so believable in this role. And somehow as bad as he character was you were devistated at the end.",Null,0,0,4 December 1999
