Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," The Shadow of the Darkside.
","The Star Wars series reaches an all time low with this one. This is without a doubt the biggest let down in movie history. A movie not living up to standards is nothing new. But a movie that not only fails to reach standards and kill most of what was in the original series, is downright terrible. On the positive side, the battles in the movie especially the light-saber battles are fantastic, though at time it seems to slow down, bordering on fake. That's about all I can list. My biggest complaint is the characters, not all of them, but some. They just seem out of place in what was such an epic legacy. Die-hard Star Wars fans will watch and weep at this movie. If you want to know what happened in this film , best get someone else to tell you.",3,1,2,24 June 2007
Star Wars: Episode IV - A New Hope," A Legend
","What can anyone say about Star Wars? It's amazing, well written, box office hit? Yes to all the above, but why? Because of the imagination behind it all. The spaceships, the robots, the light-sabers, Darth Vader...How can it not be awesome? Right now , you're thinking ' Hey, he only gave it a nine. What's up?' I gave it a nine because though I personally loved the movie, others will hate it. Those will find it boring through most of the movie, because it doesn't have a person getting shot every two minutes...maybe every 15 minutes but not every 2. But for those who can enjoy it, this is one of the best movies in history, and you'd be a fool not to watch it.",9,0,0,24 June 2007
