Walk the Line," One of my favorites.
","Joaquin Phoenix. What can I say? He is such the amazing actor, and he stars as Johnny Cash in the greatest movie ever seen, Walk the Line. And, for all you folks who doubted he actually sang in this motion picture, well, think again. Phoenix actually took voice lessons along with fellow actress Reese Witherspoon, who played the beautiful June Carter. So, if you are stuck at home, go out and rent/buy Walk the Line. The moving story about Johnny Cash+June Carter, played by outstanding actors/actresses, written by a lovely writer, and directed by an amazing director. Not only did the story help you understand the life of Cash, but it helps you respect it, too. Most people don't think that actors in Hollywood can pull of the 1940's star's life, but Phoenix and Witherspoon proved them wrong. All I can say is, if you don't go out and see this movie sometime in your life, you are missing, a one-in-a-lifetime chance to see an adorable, unique, calming story, Walk the Line.",10,0,0,22 June 2006
The Last Song," 'Last Song' hits some good notes, misses others
","Enter Veronica 'Ronnie' Miller, a recently graduated seventeen-year-old with an attitude problem, divorced parents, a fresh shoplifting arrest and combat boots. When Ronnie is sent from New York to Georgia to live with her dad for the summer, she is less than thrilled and at first resists letting anyone in.Enter Will Blakelee, a rich small town 'hunk' (if you will), with volleyball skill and charm. Not exactly a rebellious teen aged girl's cup of tea, right? Well... not quite.Ronnie, played by Disney's princess Miley Cyrus, seems set not falling for anyone over the summer. But she ends up doing the opposite. Will's (Liam Hemsworth, Australian newbie) consistency pays off after just a couple of run-ins. He's writing 'Forever' on Ronnie's converse and playfully pushing her into the ocean before she even comes to fairly good terms with her piano-playing father, Steve. (Greg Kinnear) The fast pace relationship was sweet, considering it's between teenagers. Nothing like clich√© summer romance, huh? If only there was more depth to the relationship... (not counting Will's secretly damaged family, and Ronnie's dramatic anger towards her dad) ... then maybe it would have been a more successful movie as a whole.I'm not going to blame Cyrus' ability to act (or maybe lack thereof) on the low points of the film. I'll actually give it to her, she did a nice job transitioning from little miss Hannah Montana to a darker, not as tween-based character. There is always room for improvement, however, as she seems to get bored of her alter ego throughout the film. But all in all, I did find her likable for the most part.At the end of the day, I cannot really complain or bash The Last Song. It was a debut in a lot of ways... Julie Anne Robinson's directorial debut, Nicholas Spark writing a screenplay debut, and Miley's debut as someone other than Hannah. So, cut it some slack. Excuse the sometimes cheesy moments and keep your mind open.6/10, Not too shabby.",6,40,69,31 March 2010
Cars," One nice ride.
","Pixar. Let's just keep that name in mind. Because, as a matter of fact, Pixar has made children's movie's a huge hit...and this movie, 'Cars', is their seventh time, in a row. First there was Toy Story, with the lovable Woody and the hero Buzz. Then, A Bugs Life. Who wouldn't love the cute little ants? After that came along the excellent Toy Story 2, which all the little kids adored. Then, Monsters Inc., with a cute story line and just as cute characters. After that is Finding Nemo, which was a big hit. Before Cars, was The Incredibles, which was, well, incredible. Finally, we came to 'Cars', which just so happens to be one of my new favorite movies. I see Cars plushies, Cars toy car's, Soundtracks, books, MP3 cases, CD players, even TV's and Radios. At the Movie Theatre, I got a package of trading cards, my little brother was sporting a Cars tee shirt. I guess you can say, we are all obsessed with this one-of-a-kind movie. Which deserves a perfect 'Two Thumbs Up' + four golden stars. This Pixar movie is as cute as a button, the whole entire family will laugh and enjoy it. So, don't blow off the chance to see this brilliant motion picture, Cars.",10,0,0,22 June 2006
The Dark Knight," What great films are made of!
","I remember when I started counting down the days until 'The Dark Knight' came out. I remember when I heard the terrible news of Heath Ledger's death. And now, I will remember what a great, no, BRILLIANT piece of film 'The Dark Knight' truly is.Waiting in line for the IMAX showing on July 18 felt surreal. This is what I had been waiting for. I'd read many positive reviews about this movie, and I was more than certain it would live up to all the hype. Oh boy, did it ever.Christian Bale returns as billionaire Bruce Wayne, having played the same part in 2005's hit 'Batman Begins'. Can I just say that Christian is marvelous? I've heard that some people aren't too fond of his voice as Batman, but to me, it was music to my ears. His goal is to scare off the villains, and trust me, when he yells in that voice, it's a bit frightening.Maggie Gyllenhaal was a perfect replacement for Katie Holmes as Rachel Dawes, who is probably Bruce's only true love. I've heard complaints she's uglier, but hey, her acting was about ten times better. Rachel's new love interest is played by Aaron Eckhart, who brings Harvey Dent (or Two-Face, which by the way, gave me chills) to life better than anyone else could've.Finally, the late but great Heath Ledger. I knew that he would hit this out of the park. He definitely did. DEFINITELY. I've heard that he makes Jack's joker look like Bozo the Clown. I couldn't agree more. This is coming from a girl who loves scary movies and rarely gets scared, Heath scared me, at some points I looked down and cringed. I couldn't bare watching how frightening he was. It wasn't Heath. It was The Joker. He was that believable. Oscar? Please. This will be talked about for ages... it's more than the Academy can offer. He was a HUGE loss, I hope everybody knows that.'TDK''s acting was superb, it's storyline was nothing less than brilliant, and those 2 and a half hours will fly by, they certainly did for me. It didn't drag on, it couldn't have been more perfect. Bravo, Christopher Nolan, you're a mastermind. This is what great films are made of!",10,5,11,19 July 2008
