Black Swan," This is not an easy movie
","Simply put, this is not an easy movie to watch. Ballerinas, a status that is acquired through painstaking practices and determination, is always mysterious. This movie uncovered the shadow behind their glorious careers on stage. While it is fiction, it describes the internal and external pressures, the rise and fall of careers, the competition among peers, the stereotypes for ballerinas, and most of all, the sheer will behind a perfect performance. Through out this movie, Natalie Portman's restrained character faces every type of blood, sweat, and tears to perfect herself. The movie's intensity, realism, and Natale Portman's superb acting make this a difficult yet rewarding watch.",9,2,4,9 January 2011
Nick and Norah's Infinite Playlist," Nice Aftertaste
","I did not have great expectations for the movie. Watching Nick and Norah crash their car and Norah punches Nick's throat in the trailer, I thought this movie is another 'super bad' but toned down on the sex. But I was wrong, this movie is like a satisfying piece of chocolate that you'll only crave for more. The music and camera work is natural and polished. The performances by these young stars are surprisingly good since I can vividly feel their emotions and conflicts. I would have to give up thumbs up for the script since as a teenager, I can clearly imagine myself saying some of those stuff and the plot is engaging as well. The aftertaste of this movie did not leave me confused or cheated, the movie inspired me to be more tenacious in life like the way they chase after Where is Fluffy and their courage to pursue what they want despite temptations.",8,0,0,17 August 2009
