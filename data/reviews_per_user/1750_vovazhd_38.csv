Raiders of the Lost Ark," The ultimate adventure film
","Like many people, I grew up with Indiana Jones. The series was shown repeatedly on television and I could never resist watching it. For a casual viewer, few films are more entertaining. It has been several years since then and I have finally seen Raiders of the Lost Ark again. This time I was able to make some observations about what makes it so great.The acting is flawless. I'm tempted to say that Indiana Jones was Harrison Ford's career defining role. He is incredibly charismatic, honest, and iconic. There is not a single scene where he feels out of character. His heroic appearances always draw me straight into the film. His witty comments add a lot to the character. The rest of the cast almost matches Ford's quality. Marion Ravenwood (played by Karen Allen) makes a realistic and lively companion, often in extreme contrast to Indy's style. This makes for some intriguing development between them. Sallah (played by John Rhys-Davies) makes another good companion, although he is a bit one-dimensional. The villains are some of the most creative around. Dr. Rene Belloq (played by Paul Freeman) serves as the perfect nemesis. Although he claims to have a lot in common with Indy, some key characteristics are reversed (such as his ignorance of others). In addition, Major Arnold Toht is another unforgettable villain.The plot is very good. There are relatively few plot holes compared to other films that try to do as much. The events are unpredictable for the first time watching (well, except for Indy always escaping safely). The film alternates between riveting action sequences and slower plot development parts. This leads to some interesting pacing, which in my opinion is a success. The music score is varied enough to cover the entire range of situations while staying true to the adventure theme.The action is amazing. Everything is timed perfectly and executed with minimal inconsistencies. The film avoids simple punching or shooting action. Instead, it explores creative ways to maximize use of the surrounding environment. The climactic truck-chase scene is one of the best action sequences ever filmed.There are definitely some (but not many) better films, but Raiders of the Lost Ark is one of the most accessible classics around. You don't need to understand symbolism, art, history, or filming technique to appreciate it. I can't think of a more complete adventure film. It also ranks among the best action films. It has a place in my personal top 10 favorite films. If you haven't seen Raiders of the Lost Ark yet, then find some friends and check it out. You are in need of a true adventure.",10,0,1,18 May 2008
The Birth of a Nation," Epic film from the dawn of cinema
","The Birth of a Nation is way ahead of its time technologically and structurally, but backwards socially. It tells the story of two different families, the northern Stonemans and the southern Camerons, and their evolution through the civil war (part 1) and the years of discontent that follow (part 2). Although both halves intertwine, the first half is ultimately a meticulous war epic, while the second half is a social investigation into the KKK and black militias.There was an adaptation period during the first 20-30 minutes where I had to get used to the silent-black-and-white-ninety-year-old technology. But after that, I was absorbed all the way.The characters were easy to follow, especially throughout the second half. Even without sound, it was easy to tell what was going on because of their precise expressions and movement. Silas Lynch makes an especially interesting 'villain'. The battle scenes are so ambitious that they are still impressive today. Visually, it looked decades ahead in several parts. The plot has several layers, which makes it complex but at the same time easy to follow. The story is also very unconventional, partly because of its scope.The main downside of the film is that the technological gap between 1915 and the 21st century may be too large for some audiences to scale, even with the film as good as it is. It requires mental concentration for a period at the start, but then things settle in. Another obvious negative is the backwards social message. Even so, I found that watching the film expanded my horizons in a positive way.Therefore, this film gets a high recommendation despite its age. It allows one to peer into the far past, where the world was different socially, technologically, and culturally. This is something that is important for everyone to experience, and this film is one of the best ways to do it.",8,1,3,22 September 2007
Memento," Incredible Achievement
","Memento is a fresh breath compared to most mainstream movies. The main character is an amnesiac investigator searching for the killer of his wife. He utilizes tattoos and notes to follow a trail of evidence, even when he can't remember how he gained the evidence. The plot has enough twists and turns and surprise endings to be part of an amusement park. Just when you think your getting a hold of what is going on, everything swings into another direction. The reverse chronology of the main plot line makes things interesting to say the least.Guy Pearce does a convincing portrayal of Leonard (the amnesiac), and pretty much all the other actors are fitting in their respective parts. The music is excellent and used very effectively. The individual segments (roughly 5 minutes each) are well executed. There is even some well-placed humor thrown in.The flaw that prevents me from awarding Memento a 10 is also its main strength: the plot. While the plot is excellently crafted and executed, it is just too convoluted. Maybe thats partly because of the reverse chronology, but it feels really unstable and is hard to follow at times. The complexity adds a lot to the meaning as a whole, but prevents casual viewing.Nevertheless, this is essential viewing. The material is of the highest quality and the subject is fascinating. So many questions are spawned about the uses and abuses of amnesia, and just memory in general. It is one of those films that your going to think about all the time.",9,1,5,29 September 2007
Inglourious Basterds," Fascinating epic by Tarantino
","Inglourious Basterds is an alternate history World War II war epic. Unlike other war epics, it is completely fictional, using Nazi occupied France as a setting but hardly taking into account any other historical information. The film is stylistically similar to Quentin Tarantino's other films, such as Pulp Fiction and the Kill Bills. There is a lot of exaggerated violence, quirky characters, and dialog.There are several scenes of extended dialog between characters. Sometimes I criticize this in Tarantino's other films, but it works very well here to introduce the characters and develop them. It even helps demonstrate Hans Landa's fluency in multiple language. Since most of the conservations are only loosely connected to the plot, this may draw some people off. However, these scenes usually conclude with some important plot development or action.The cast is very strong, although not perfect. Tarantino does not give us as much information about the characters as we would want. He always leaves mysteries open and does not have a single figure take up much of the film's time. In particular, Brad Pitt and Christoph Waltz gave commendable performances. The other actors all fit reasonably well.The plot is secondary to the characters, but is generally good. Split into five chapters, not much happens in the first four parts except for character and plot development, mixed in a few surprising moments. By far the most significant part is the fifth chapter, which is an astounding finale. It is shocking and exaggerated in typical Tarantino fashion.It is arguable about how much of a point the film has, but for most people it should be entertaining. If you enjoyed Tarantino's previous works, then you would find this one equally worthy.",9,3,10,23 August 2009
Superbad," One of the best comedies of the year
","Superbad may look like a typical high-school movie on the cover, but its actually much more. It follows a trio of high-school seniors that decide to have one last party before leaving for college (and one last shot at grabbing a girl). The trio consists of Seth, Evan, and Fogell. They make a likable main cast that is very easy to compare to. Their acting style is ideal for this type of film. Joining them are several other intriguing characters. My favorite were the two police officers, Slater and Michaels. Pretty much every scene with them made me laugh; from their references to other movies to the spoofs on being an officer, its classic slapstick comedy.The plot is definitely a strong point, unlike many comedies today. Most of the movie follows two distinct plot lines that join up at the end. Inter-weaved in the plot are countless jokes that kept me laughing almost the whole time. The plot itself involves booze, partying, and law enforcement, and somehow works these in to make a very absorbing story. Also, the particularly close friendship between Seth and Evan is an element that surpasses the comedy genre. The plot as a whole has plenty of unrealistic details, but manages to successfully meld comedy with some deeper meaning.The comedy aspects are some of the best ever. Some of the jokes were a little disgusting (mainly the part about Seth's childhood), but I gotta admit they were hilarious. The beer aspects were pretty cool, and the sexual jokes did their thing. The law enforcement spoofs and McLovin gags were probably my favorite.The movie as a whole is among the better comedies ever. I liked it more than Knocked Up (7/10). It still suffers from some of the weaknesses inherent in the comedy genre, but has a lot more value than most movies nowadays. Highly recommended for people in high school or college, and also recommended (albeit to a lesser degree) for everyone else.",8,87,145,3 November 2007
The Natural," Solid baseball drama
","The Natural is based on Bernard Malamud's famous novel about baseball. It follows Roy Hobbs' first season as a player for the New York Knights. Despite being older than the average player, he lives up to his title of being a natural. In addition to the baseball part, the film also includes a love story that impacts Hobbs' performance in various ways, making things interesting.If your a fan of baseball, this is the movie for you. Despite playing for a couple years while I was a kid, I never cared much about the sport. I decided to give the film a chance anyway. Robert Redford has the image of a great baseball icon, which suits him perfectly for the role of Hobbs. The team manager, Pop Fisher, makes a perfect coach. His lines about being a farmer are priceless. The opponents of Hobbs, particularly The Judge (the corrupt owner of the team), are a believable bunch that adequately reflect the hurdles of organized baseball. The music is also a strong point of the film; its main score has become forever intertwined with achievement in sports.The plot was interesting enough to keep my attention. While not particularly exciting or deep on the whole, it certainly has its moments. The last ten minutes are a good wrap-up, and is probably the best part overall. I was satisfied with the movie and would highly recommend it to fans of the sport.",7,0,1,4 January 2008
Once," A musical I actually enjoyed
","I'm not particularly fond of musicals. In fact, I think its safe to say I hate musicals. Once proves that there are always exceptions. It is an Irish film about two struggling musicians that cross paths. They find a common interest in music, which allows them to help each other out with their personal difficulties. I could have easily imagined this film going a little too far and losing its meaning, but it shows incredible composure and consistency in its themes.The acting is excellent from both significant and minor roles. The two main characters are acted by real-life musicians Glen Hansard and Marketa Irglova. They are simply known as 'Guy' and 'Girl' rather than having actual names, which I think was a great decision. You can feel a relationship form between them, but at the same time that relationship is a practical impossibility. Their performances are extremely believable.The key part of any musical is a good music selection. Once certainly satisfies in this category; 'Falling Slowly' deserves its Oscar and most of the other songs are nearly as beautiful. The film avoided cheesy or silly editing for the music segments, which I felt made it multitudes easier to watch than most other musicals.Overall, I was pleasantly surprised by how much I enjoyed Once. I came in skeptical, but at some point (not exactly sure when) it won me over. I must add that the ending sequence is flawless, especially the last camera pan. I genuinely cared for the characters. You will not regret watching Once at least once.",8,1,2,28 February 2008
Dr. Strangelove or: How I Learned to Stop Worrying and Love the Bomb," Satirical masterpiece
","Dr. Strangelove or: How I Learned to Stop Worrying and Love the Bomb is one of Stanley Kubrick's most critically and publicly acclaimed films. It is a political and social satire about nuclear war. When a United States general orders a nuclear attack on the Soviet Union, the President scrambles to cancel the attack and mutually work things out with the Soviet Union. Negotiations seem to work, until it is realized that there is a Doomsday Device implemented to automatically counter-attack any nuclear hits. Needless to say, things become complicated.The cast is one of the greatest strengths of the film; all the characters are finely crafted and acted flawlessly. Peter Sellers does his legendary performance in three roles (Dr. Strangelove, the President, and Group Captain Mandrake). I do wish that Dr. Strangelove had more screen time; seeing that he was the title character, I expected a bigger influence from him onto the plot. Mandrake was a solid comedy character and the President had a believable, political image. Performances from other actors were also great. George C. Scott as General Turgidson was commendable; his paranoia and fights with the ambassador were classic. Slim Pickens was simply fantastic as the bomber pilot Major Kong, seething with a heavily pro-American mindset.The technical aspects of Dr. Strangelove are also a strong point. The camera angles and cinematography are excellent. The scenes all have the same dark comedy mood in them. Although there was extensive dialog, it never felt overwhelming. The decision to use 'When Johnny Comes Marching Home' as music for the bomber scenes (with no music used elsewhere) was a good choice. There are many nuances that fill even the smallest holes in the movie, and each character is meticulously detailed.The message is perhaps the most important part of the film, especially when focusing in the context of its release date (during the height of the Cold War). It is basically a satire of mutual destruction, but carries other intriguing implications. There is a lot of sexual imagery, although it is hidden as a second layer to the main plot (although it is mentioned in Dr. Strangelove's ending speech). The whole conclusion was epic and hilarious, and wraps things up just like it should.Dr. Strangelove is a masterpiece that is rightly praised. In my opinion, it is Kubrick's second best film, and perhaps the greatest comedy movie ever.",10,2,4,20 December 2007
Battleship Potemkin," Perhaps the greatest silent film
","Battleship Potemkin is a silent film by Sergei Eisenstein. It gives a historically dramatized account of the battleship Potemkin, where the crew revolts against the captains. This is Soviet propaganda without a doubt, which gives it an interesting historical perspective. It mainly focuses on the importance of revolution, brutality of the Tsar, and individual expense for the greater good. All these strong themes make the film easy to focus on, even for modern audiences.The acting is good, although not outstanding. The main captain, doctor, and priest make an infamous representation of cold leadership. The captains of the ship are contrasted with the crew by their black jacket. This makes it instantly recognizable which side is which. The placement of the people and actions is perfect. Its editing like this that makes it so easy to watch even though the film itself is old. The good planning carries out through the whole film.The most impressive quality is the cinematography. The shots of the water, ship, and building structures are all meticulously done. A very effective image is shown early on, where the ships meat is crawling with maggots. The captain's refusal to provide adequate food for the crew reaches a climax when he plans to execute crew members that did not like the soup. This leads to the first impressive scene: the ships revolt. The action here is comparable with many modern action flicks. Later, the famous scene on the Odessa steps and the conclusion are also shown through phenomenal editing. It is very obvious that this quality is years ahead of its time. Few films are so technically great without the use of color and sound.This might be the greatest silent film in existence. I have yet to see Metropolis, but have seen most other notable silent films. I found Battleship Potemkin to be the easiest to watch out of the bunch. That, along with historical and technical significance, makes this a must see for anyone that loves studying film.",9,0,0,3 November 2007
Glory," A glorious war story
","Glory is truly an effective war film. Set in the American Civil War, it recounts the history of an all-black regiment, the 54th Massachusetts Volunteer Regiment. Obviously a controversial idea at the time, the regiment defies all expectations to play a pivotal role in the war.The characters are a strong point of the film. The cast includes Morgan Freeman and Denzel Washington. The biggest (pleasant) surprise was Matthew Broderick, who does a fantastic job as Colonel Robert Shaw, the commander of the regiment. His personality and style suits the character perfectly. Generally, the cast's actions and dispositions feel historically believable.The plot is fine, although in retrospect it might have been a little too straightforward. Roughly the first half consists of developing and training the regiment. Here we see the racial injustices of the period. The officers have good intentions but are unsure of how to treat the blacks. They slowly gain an understanding of each other. Then they are off to fight together against the Confederates. They see more injustice, but also the opportunity to make a difference. There are only two major battle scenes, but both of them go the distance. The last one is especially well executed, with beautiful special effects and cinematography. The iconic music theme adds a lot to the emotional impact of the film.Glory is a powerful war film. It allows us to accurately experience a tumultuous period in American history. It also reminds us of the crimes of prejudice. It has a clear goal and doesn't wander out of focus like some other war films do.",8,4,6,28 May 2008
The Godfather: Part II," More than worthy continuation of the Godfather saga
","The Godfather is considered to be among the greatest films ever made, both critically and publicly. Its sequel, The Godfather: Part II is a continuation of Michael Corleone's goal to create a powerful and respectable family empire. At the same time, the film gives a history of his father, Vito Corleone (played brilliantly by Robert De Niro), and his rise to power at a young age. Both of these plot lines are excellent parallels, although Michael's is much more depressing because of the internal conflict with his brother, Fredo.The plot is much more widespread this time, but still packs a punch. There are so many classic scenes that you'll be left much influenced far after the film is over. Some of the technical aspects are taken directly from the first film, such as the music score (although it feels even more refined). The acting is also comparable to the first film; although Marlon Brando is lost, Robert De Niro completely makes up for this. The returning characters give performances that are worthy of the first film.It is also longer than the already lengthy first film. All the time is used well, so thats not too big of a problem. The tension and suspense from the first film is lacking, but a new mood of uncertainty is produced. The conflict is based more on the characters than the plot itself.The Godfather: Part II is as good as a sequel can get. Like its predecessor, it is worthy of a place among the all time great films. I would probably give the first one a nod because it was more fresh and original. But if you get yourself situated to watch this film, you cannot go wrong.",10,0,1,14 January 2008
The Bourne Ultimatum," Almost certainly the best action film of 2007
","The Bourne Ultimatum is the third and final film of the Bourne trilogy. It builds on the themes of identity and national conspiracy, while also presenting some of the most stylish and intense action sequences ever recorded. This time around, Jason Bourne discovers a source that is connected with his past. He takes the final steps toward discovering his identity while simultaneously avoiding CIA capture. He travels through Moscow, Paris, London, Madrid, Tangier, and finally New York City before completing his journey.The action sequences are simply incredible. Rather than focusing on stationary punches or gun fights, they always involve 1. Bourne being chased or 2. Bourne chasing someone. Often, the sequences alternate between the CIA surveillance room and the actual area of action. As a result, its a chaotic but well defined hunt.The most noticeable feature of the film is the shaky camera. The camera trembles for literally the entire time, even during discussion scenes. While its not distracting, its hard to tell if it gives any benefit. It certainly adds to the style, so I won't argue too much.The plot has a few well placed twists to keep things interesting. The acting is realistic, although the character motives are not always believable. The dialog almost completely consists of technical discussion or orders, with few moments in between to get a real look at Bourne's tortured life. The pacing is excellent, switching between intense action and methodic planning, always slowly building up to the finale. The ending of the movie is simply perfect, both in length and clarity.A sacrifice occurs between realism and style. Any sensible person knows that driving a car off a parking ramp, jumping between buildings, or navigating this accurately through death zones is suicide. It surely isn't realistic, but its awesome; that is what matters. Above all else, the Bourne Ultimatum is an action film, and in that it succeeds.",9,1,4,1 January 2008
Doctor Zhivago," Epic romance and drama
","Doctor Zhivago is an epic romance/drama set against the backdrop of the Russian revolution, based on the novel by Boris Pasternak. With a three hour and twenty minutes running time, it takes its time in order to fit everything in. The slower stretches lead up to key scenes that are simply magical. The story centers around the life of the young Dr. Yuri Zhivago, who serves as a medic during the first World War and civil war that follows. He builds a intimate relationship with Lara Antipova, the wife to a enthusiastic revolutionary leader. This is complicated with family relationships and the fact that he is already married to Tonya, as well as the physical barriers that anarchy imposes.The characters are an important part of the film. The acting is good and the relationships between the characters are very complex. None of the characters are perfect, but each has respectable traits. Dr. Zhivago is one of the most interesting people in any film. The cinematography is fantastic. Each scene is beautifully played out and designed. The environment consistently changes from winter to summer, each time bringing new colors and textures to please the eye. The music is also excellent, and fits the mood of the film perfectly. The historical aspects of the film are very interesting, although perhaps not completely accurate. It adds another dimension, since it takes place during one of the most tumultuous periods in history.My only major complaint is that the film feels longer than it needs to be. Although each segment is important, it takes a while to get through the less eventful parts. While it doesn't detract from the film's overall majesty, it does limit the amount of times I feel I could watch through the entire thing again.Overall, Doctor Zhivago is an enormous accomplishment. If you like good dramas, then watch it.",9,0,1,4 January 2008
The Shining," Chilling horror display
","The Shining is Stanley Kubrick's famous horror film, starring Jack Nicholson as Jack Torrance, a former teacher who stumbles upon a winter maintenance job in the Overlook Hotel. He brings his wife and child, and then is isolated for the winter. The isolation and creepy hotel history ends up effecting each character differently, slowly bringing psychological chaos.Kubrick uses several disturbing images to build up the suspense, such as an elevator spilling out blood and two twin ghosts meeting the boy, Danny. There is also some unconventional, even alien, music. The acting is realistic. At first I did not like Shelley Duvall's portrayal as the wife, but the desperation and anguish is so convincing that it won me over. Jack Nicholson, as expected, is perfect for his role. The boy, played by Danny Lloyd, is suitable (the Tony sequences were more than a little weird).The atmosphere is probably the key factor in making The Shining such an effective horror film. The set design is great; the hotel rooms are decorated with tapestries and ornaments. A real sense of isolation is created, although it is clear that another entity is involved.Although not Kubrick's best film, the Shining is among the best horror films around. How scary it really is depends on how you watch it. It is not the fright or sudden surprise, but the suspense and atmosphere that makes it chilling.",9,1,2,29 December 2007
American Beauty," Takes normal life and turns it extreme
","American Beauty follows the narration of Lester Burnham, a completely average middle-aged working man. When he sees his daughter's friend at a cheer-leading display, he becomes instantly attracted to her. His attitude toward life takes a wild turn that impacts the surrounding community, ultimately leading to a tragic conclusion.While some of the individual segments of the plot are uninteresting, the good parts come together to make a compelling story. The snippets of Burnham and his new mentality are simply priceless; from the moment he quits his business job to the scenes revolving around his new job at McDonalds, it never fails to satisfy. It brings to light a more enjoyable and funny concept of the movie: the rejection of a 'boring' life to ultimately have more satisfaction with oneself. Kevin Spacey excels as Burnham and deserves his Oscar win of best actor. Chris Cooper perfectly fits the character of Colonel Frank Fits. The rest of the cast is also convincing, although some of the teenagers could have been better played. The ending is brilliantly crafted and involves all the previous content that was introduced in the film.The usage of colors (mostly red) and symbolism (mostly regarding roses) is wonderful. It helps develop some of the nuances in the themes. Plus it makes the whole visual experience much more effective. The movie touches on many themes are all relevant to everyday life. It takes situations and emotions that we can relate with, and plays them to the extreme.It all comes together to make a visually and emotionally effective movie. It can be analyzed for the deep messages on intriguing themes or can be enjoyed at face value. American Beauty is by no means flawless, but it elaborates on themes and emotions in a way that few other movies can. Recommended for all viewers.",9,2,4,17 October 2007
Judgment at Nuremberg," Judgment has been made
","Judgment at Nuremberg is a standard court-case drama that focuses on the trial of four Nazi judges in Nuremberg following World War II. The importance of the trials from the Allied viewpoint remains contested throughout the film; most people are indicated to have little interest in it since the political and military figures have already been tried, while the actual people involved in this case strongly believe that justice must be achieved. On the other hand, the German people see this as the last chance to retain some dignity. As might be anticipated, Judgment at Nuremberg delves deep into the moral questions regarding the German citizens under the Third Reich.The acting is one of the most powerful aspects of the film. Spencer Tracy makes a sympathetic aged Chief Judge Haywood, who pursues the morally correct verdict by closely considering both sides. Richard Widmark is an admirable but shortsighted American colonel who carries out the prosecution. Burt Lancaster is Dr. Ernst Janning, an enigmatic Nazi judge on trial, who appears to be the only one that realizes the extent of the crimes. Judy Garland also deserves some praise in her role as a witness to the central case. The role that impressed me the most was Maximilian Schell as Hans Rolfe, a formidable and proud German defense attorney. He has such a commanding voice and vivid personality that makes him perfect for the role. A small role that pleasantly surprised me (being a Star Trek fan) was a young William Shatner as Capain Harrison Byers, Haywood's aide. You must admit, he fits right in!The plot is very interesting. There are several moments that will sway your opinion of what is right and wrong. The real message seems to be that we cannot know for certain what the proper verdict is, although the film hints that in the future we will be able to look back and decide. The ending was perfectly executed, and the last scene was somewhat of a surprise. The historical text at the end indicates the irony of the matter.The only significant flaws of the film were that it was a little overlong (even if I hate using that as a criticism) and didn't seem to have much to offer in terms of a second viewing (although I might be wrong). Occasionally it repeated ideas, but never to the point where it got repetitive.Overall, Judgment at Nuremberg appears to be one of the best American court-case dramas, right up there with 12 Angry Men. The themes it deals with are still relevant today. The point of the film is basic, even if it has some complicated consequences, but oftentimes people tend forget these things. If you are looking for some trial action or a loose historical film, then this should be near the top of your list.",9,2,2,18 December 2008
The Battle of Algiers," A stunning view on Algeria's struggle for independence
","The Battle of Algiers is a multi-layered film describing the attempts of Algerian rebels to gain independence from France in the 1950's. The French bring in military might, but the guerrilla tactics of the rebels prevent direct assault. Thus the French officials are left with an unclear path of bringing order to the city. The film chronicles individual terrorist plots and attacks, while also describing the attempts of the French army to react and hunt down rebel power. The small attacks slowly build up into a brilliant, touching conclusion.The person that stood out the most was Colonel Mathieu, a confident and cunning head of the French military. He made an admirable character from his first appearance in a paratrooper march to his final statement. The rebels meet our expectations; there are a few major rebel figures, but none of them have the unanimous command like Colonel Mathieu. They are also imperfect. The plans are drawn up quickly, but the goal is always the same: to stimulate Algeria's resistance to French command. Overall, it makes for an uncannily realistic plot structure.The film is loaded with material and messages that will keep you thinking long after watching it. It is not the usual well-defined revolution that we expect; rather, the rebels are terrorists whose bombs kill innocent people, while the French army is very orderly and (despite torturing prisoners) civilized. Neither side is perfect, and its hard to tell what side is right. This makes for a highly realistic vision that is as complex as it is political.The only major downside to the film is that, although filmed professionally, the quality of the footage and sound is not always the best. It isn't enough to detract much from the experienced viewer, but its a shame that it could not have been better preserved or restored. Other than that, the film is masterpiece.",9,1,2,7 December 2007
No Country for Old Men," Haunting investigation of humanity
","No Country for Old Men is the Coen brothers' adaptation of Cormac McCarthy's novel. It is a modern western about a man named Llewelyn Moss, who finds a suitcase full of two million dollars after stumbling onto the scene of a drug deal that resulted in the death of all but one thirsty man (who dies shortly after). Taking the money for himself, Moss is then chased by the Mexicans and private hit men (primarily Anton Chigurh) as he flees across the state. The story consists of many intriguing plot twists. It largely deals with dark themes and disturbing psychology.The acting is great across the board. The most memorable character is Anton Chigurh, the main hit man that chases Moss. He is clearly psychopathic, but nobody is able to stop him from doing his job. A close second is Sheriff Ed Tom Bell, played by Tommy Lee Jones. He is a complete opposite of Chigurh. An aged veteran sheriff, he agonizes over the fact that he is unable to bring justice to the community, due to the fact that the criminals are much more adept (due to changing times).The film creates an atmosphere that, during several moments, ranks among the greatest movies. The suspense centering around the inevitable encounters is reminiscent of the Godfather, but takes on a whole level because of the obvious mental derangement that is involved. An interesting feature is that the real plot ends about 80% through the film. After that, it feels like a free fall where the characters have no goal. And it ends suddenly, with several loose ends. But the beauty is that it is exactly what the film is about, adequately summed up by Sheriff Bell's decision about retirement at the end.No Country for Old Men is among the best films of 2007. Although it will first need to face the test of time to see how it ranks among the all time greats, it certainly carries a lot of potential to secure a spot in history. Even if your hesitant about the genre or subject material, I recommend you watch this movie.",9,1,5,5 January 2008
District 9," Excellent premise but mixed execution
","District 9 has a fresh science fiction premise: an alien mothership arrives to Earth and inertly levitates in the sky over Johannesburg, South Africa. Once humans find their way inside, they find a famished alien worker population. There is no value in them except for their advanced weaponry that is rendered inoperable to humans. Like any great science fiction story, there are plenty of things left as a mystery.It is clear that Peter Jackson's role as a producer has benefited the film in many ways. There are excellent special effects and environments. The alien design is beautiful, although I'm sure that not everyone will agree with me. Their culture, language, and eating habits were reasonably believable. The attention to detail is fantastic, especially in implementing features such as the 'For Humans Only' signs.The beginning of the film takes advantage of a documentary style. The story is told through interviews and news footage to retell history as it happened. Soon afterwards, the film follows events through the perspective of Wikus van der Merwe, a field operative played by Sharlto Copley. Although he is one of the more sensitive humans around, he still suffers from arrogance and selfishness. In fact, one of the things that might have hurt the film is the lack of any admirable characters in the cast. I found the alien leader and his son to be the only respectable characters.If the first half of District 9 is science fiction, the second half is action. Generally I enjoy action, but it was not very compelling here. I was disappointed to find that there was essentially no insight after the halfway mark. No plot surprises, no deep character interactions, and no creative uses of technology. The film simply deteriorated into unbelievable action and illogical consequences. The main characters dodge hundreds of bullets, blow up things (including lots of humans, which effectively burst in a spray of guts when hit by alien weapon projectiles), and manage to survive despite countless mistakes. The ending was strange, but does leave plenty of room open for a sequel (in 3 years?).District 9 opened fine, but slowly lost its appeal for me as it progressed. It felt like the writers wanted to send a message, but then worried that the audience would lose their attention so they threw in lots of action to try to make an exciting finale. That might be fine for most people, but it diminished my appreciation for the interesting parts.",6,4,15,15 August 2009
The Pianist," A touching film about one man's extraordinary experiences
","The Pianist is a dramatic Holocaust film about Wladyslaw Szpilman's experiences during World War II. A brilliant Jewish pianist played by Adrien Brody, he quickly gains the audience's sympathy after being a victim of the horrific, methodic actions of the Third Reich. It appears that the film never strays far from the truth, which in turn makes the it all the more emotional.There are some very chilling moments, but I think the most powerful parts of the film are where kindness is shown by people who you don't expect it from. Szpilman's life is saved several times by strangers that provide shelter and food, and even by a couple individuals employed by the Nazis. I felt that those things give the film an optimistic tone.Brody's acting is great and he deserved his Oscar. Since the entire film revolves around his performance, this was an important aspect for its success. Other performances are effective as well. The directing by Roman Polansky is solid and shows no considerable error.I would not find The Pianist to be an overly disturbing film at all, despite the fact that several characters close to Szpilman are killed. The full scale of the Holocaust is hidden from the scope of the film, which is due to Szpilman's luck at escaping. A wide range of emotions are displayed throughout the film, but what you are left with is an admiration of Szpilman's life.",9,0,0,16 August 2009
Across the Universe," Psychedelic but inconsistent
","Across the Universe is a sensory musical that uses songs from The Beatles to tell a story about America in the tumultuous decade of the 60s. It is about a young man named Jude, who travels to the United States from his native home of Liverpool. Once there, he meets a dropout student named Max and they quickly become friends. They move to a building in New York City, where a relationship builds up between Jude and Max's sister, Lucy. They also meet a number of peculiar people from the city, widening the friendship circle. Alas, Max's departure to fight for the war and the differing stances between the remaining friends soon gets in the way.Across the Universe is basically a bunch of neat music videos, tied together by a mediocre plot. The only reason the plot is not a complete mess is that the characters hold it together (although at some points the characters have rather impractical motives). Some parts of the film are downright silly, but I guess that stems from it being a musical. It gets more serious toward the middle, when the Vietnam War and protests play a greater role. All in all, the plot left me unsatisfied.The music parts were certainly interesting. There were a couple of abstract segments, but it was very artistic and beautiful. The special effects are excellent. The use of colors (especially when Jude creates a 'strawberry farm') is thoughtful. Depending on viewer tastes, the music might start to take a toll toward the end (although that is where the best songs come in). The music selection was a definite draw for me.The acting and dialog was pretty much standard. There are cameos by Bono, Eddie Izzard, Joe Cocker, and Salma Hayek, which adds to the musical flavor.The main problem I had was that the whole film was plagued by inconsistencies. It felt like the writers attempted too much to fit the songs into the story, which leads to problems. It presses for an emotional response, but often I disagreed with the messages.I should note that I am not a fan of musicals. Someone who likes musicals will probably enjoy the film more and be able to ignore the problems. If you like the Beatles, then the film is definitely worth watching. For a general audience, Across the Universe is a solid film.",6,2,4,1 February 2008
The Incredibles," Carried by great animation and action
","The Incredibles describes a period in the life of two ex-super-heroes and their young family. When Mr. Incredible loses his 'normal life' job, he discovers a suspicious job offer that requires his super abilities. This brings him out of retirement without him explaining it to his family. Eventually, the job develops into a large scale scheme. This is mostly done to set up a rivalry between Mr. Incredible and Syndrome, a troubled villain whose anger was spawned from Mr. Incredible's rejection of him as a sidekick.Syndrome is a stereotypical villain: a selfish and remorseless man that somehow has access to a lot of technology and employees to carry out damage onto society. He is flat and unlikable. The good guys (primarily the Incredibles family) are also very stereotyped, and do not really show any deep emotion. I guess it is supposed to reflect what we expect super-heroes to be like, but it leaves a little void when trying to understand them. Even so, the characters are used creatively in the action sequences, especially the ones that combine all the abilities together. The animation was top notch quality and flowed smoothly. The music was exactly what you expect super-hero music to be. It went good with the action sequences, but not much else, and got dry by the end.The Incredibles is a great kids/family movie, but does not have enough essence to make an impact on older viewers. There were some good parody moments and unique action sequences, as well as plenty of comedy (I loved it when Syndrome remarked 'You caught me monologuing'). Recommended for all viewers, but especially the younger ones.",7,0,0,13 October 2007
Stardust," Fantastic proverbial fantasy
","Stardust is a fantasy about a young man named Tristan, who journeys to collect a fallen star that he and a girlfriend notice in the sky one night. In doing so, he journeys from his 'real world' town of Wall into a magical land that is hidden behind a wall nearby. But he is not the only one after the star; a band of witches and the son of a King also pursue the fallen star. The star turns out to be a woman that carries an attitude of her own, further complicating the quest. The film has several subplots that are important but too complicated to describe here. When everything comes together, you get a fascinating and elegant structure that forms a perfect fantasy tale.The movie is, above all else, creative. The fallen star visibly glows as she becomes happy and strong, the witches grow old and ugly as they cast magic (which is why they are after the star; the star's heart regenerates their youth), the King has a unique method of choosing his heir, and there are countless magical spells or objects that are remarkable to imagine (Babylon candles, witch hexes, trapped lightning). One of my favorite ideas is that of Captain Shakespeare (perfectly played by Robert DeNiro), a pirate that believes reputation is everything. The imaginative use of the fantasy world and bright characters is the factor that puts it above most movies.Stardust does suffer from occasional acting or dialog problems, although none are too distracting. The music is fantastic; its not too intense or overused, but perfectly suits the style. Depending on your personal tastes, it could be a little slow, but for most people the pacing should feel perfect. The finale was especially put together well, with a few exciting surprises to wrap up all the subplots.I recommend the movie for people of all ages. It has a magical atmosphere that you can't go wrong with. People who love fantasies, dreams, or adventures will like it the most.",8,2,2,1 January 2008
Into the Wild," Solid film, but fell short of my expectations
","Into the Wild is a road-trip/biography film based on a true story about an adventurer named Christopher McCandless. After college graduation, he decides to give away all his possessions and hide from society. He adopts the name Alex Supertramp and travels across the United States, making money from small jobs. At the same time, he finds time to experience the beauty of nature. Eventually, he decides to journey into the Alaskan wilderness alone.Emile Hirsch does a good job acting as Alex. Although I can't say I was entirely impressed his performance, I respect him because of the difficulty of the role. The fact that he was believable was one of the main things that made the film work.The plot is somewhat convoluted, alternating between his adventure in Alaska and his previous experiences around continental United States. For much of the film, I did not feel like I was connecting with the events or emotions that Alex was experiencing. The pacing was rather slow as well. There were some things, such as the problems with Alex's parents, that were unclear. Toward the end, it did get better. The final scene was simply beautiful. Despite this, its difficult not to label the film as overlong.Into the Wild holds high standards in direction and editing. The environmental scenes are a clear contrast to the bland city or slum segments. They are beautifully shot and panned. There are some neat effects, such as slow motion or stylistic blurring, that add a nice touch.The film fell short of the expectations that I built up from significant critical praise. Some parts were very well done, but as a whole it was too idle. But I did find value in it, even though I disagreed with several of the main messages. All in all, it was a solid but unspectacular adventure.",7,0,1,15 February 2008
2001: A Space Odyssey," An unforgettable experience that transcends cinema and our imagination
","Note: This is my second review on 2001: A Space Odyssey (original on 10/1/07). Although I gave the film the same 10/10 score and my highest praise, a lot has happened since my first viewing. The beauty of the film is that it (vastly more than any other film I have seen) does not leave you after you finish watching it.After I first watched 2001: A Space Odyssey, I quickly realized what an incredible achievement it was. Unfortunately, I have recommended it to several people that did not enjoy it as much. My father remarked that Kubrick must have been on drugs, my mother did not understand any of it (although after reading the book, she decided she liked it), my brother called it bland, my classmate felt it was immensely tedious (and his roommate hated the movie altogether). I only know a couple people personally that liked it. I suppose this shows the dividing opinions from the public of the film (although critics generally love it). Either way, I would like to explain why this is currently my favorite movie.2001: A Space Odyssey is unlike any other movie around. Instead of focusing on story or drama, it is a massive visual and artistic experience. It is so unconventional that you must watch it under its own terms (for first time viewers: patience). Upon my first viewing, it felt much like the space missions I dreamed about as a kid. The experience was surreal. You actually feel like you are part of the events because it is played out so meticulously. There are no shortcuts; the space ship maneuvers and astronaut procedures may feel long or tedious to some people, but for me it carried an enormous sense of isolation, realism, and the cold void of space. The ideas and themes brought out by the movie are very creative and kept me mentally engaged the entire time. It makes me feel like a child experiencing something new and special for the first time.The Dawn of Man segment starts off the movie with an iconic moment with apes discovering a mysterious monolith. The reactions of the apes show how far man has evolved from a primitive and savage state. The monolith sparks the realization of the existence of tools into the apes, visualized by the use of a bone as a club. This carried human evolution into the year 2001, where their entire existence depends on new, more sophisticated tools. The brilliance of Kubrick is that the space vehicles and structures largely resemble anatomical features, retaining a connection with the past. When a new monolith is discovered on the moon, a whole new stage of evolution begins.An occasional complaint that I hear which makes no sense to me is that the 'acting is bad'. Where is there a moment of a bad acting? The characters are exactly what you expect astronauts and scientists to be like. This is not a drama, so you should not expect characters giving long monologues or showing extreme emotions. That said, the one character that really stands out is the computer HAL-9000. A complex mix of cold menace and childish innocence, it opens up interesting speculation about the (still) future prospects of artificial intelligence.The music is absolutely outstanding, from the epic (and symbolic) fanfare of the introduction, to the strident vocals of the monolith encounters, and to the gentle waltzes that are played during the space scenes. It adds a lot of substance to the scenes that flow a little slower. The cinematography is practically flawless. The one trait that is universally appreciated is the special effects, so I won't add too much more discussion to that aspect. I should mention that I believe this is the best use of special effects in any movie; although newer films have better technology to use, they rarely use it in the best ways.Upon my first viewing, I decided that the ending, while fascinating, was overly abstract. Afterwards, I thought about it for a while and realized that it was truly a great sequence. The symbolic imagery and significance is phenomenal, unmatched by any other film. I have a hard time imagining any better ending to the film.Some people compare this movie to art, but I think that is only part of it. It is an amazing journey that left me agape. It was eerily realistic and touched upon the most important themes in history. Significance like this is lost in many of today's blockbusters. Watching this movie is the best way to experience space exploration (ignoring actually becoming an astronaut). As a science fiction fan, I am glad to label it as the epitome of science fiction. This is the movie that made me respect Stanley Kubrick. It currently sits comfortably on the top of my favorite movies list. It has changed the way I watched movies. More importantly, it changed the way I viewed life and the universe. It earns my absolute highest recommendation.",10,0,3,1 October 2007
Grindhouse," Surprisingly fun time
","Quentin Tarantino and Robert Rodriguez both know how to make a movie alone; together, they produce magic. Grindhouse is nothing short of a brilliant idea with many more great ideas inside of it. I laughed, screamed, gasped, gaped, stared, thought, and enjoyed. The duo of films takes some stamina to get through, but by the end you don't even notice because its so much fun. Since Grindhouse is really two films, I'll give separate mini-reviews:PLANET TERROR: Great horror/comedy hybrid. The characters were likable and acting decent (at least better than most horror films). In fact, the characters were great because each one had a distinct, unique attitude around him. The action sequences were phenomenal, if not a little overdone. It seemed that by the end the movie stopped taking itself seriously and threw a few nonsensical ideas around, but considering its genre, thats not much of a problem. It reminded me in many ways of Shaun of the Dead, but even better. It is stylistically bold, and succeeds in being a powerful experience.DEATH PROOF: Started a little slow, but otherwise built up perfectly to the conclusion. There was too much dialog and chatting in some parts, especially considering that the topics of discussion were uninteresting. Other parts were fine, and the action sequences did not disappoint. Kurt Russel gives an impressive performance as Stuntman Mike, the bad-guy. Overall, the film didn't have much of a moral or logical point, but succeeds in entertainment.The two films go together nicely and share many similarities (although at first glance they seem to be entirely different). There are a couple deja-vu moments in Death Proof that were cool. The two films also had several stylistic similarities (which was good). The fake previews before the feature films are a nice touch. Before watching, I was expecting Grindhouse to be a little overrated, but it won me over.",8,4,8,20 November 2007
A Clockwork Orange," A vibrant and innovative journey into identity
","The more I watch Stanley Kubrick films, the more I love them. They have a certain quality and innovation that makes them a step beyond the typical movie. A Clockwork Orange is no different.The film follows a period in the life of a young man named Alex deLarge. It takes place in a futuristic totalitarian Britain, where the government attempts to 'cure' crime. Alex is part of a gang that assaults women to please their own instinctual urges. After killing a woman and being betrayed by his friends, he is arrested and experiences the harsh environment of prison. While still in prison, he discovers religion and yearns for a day when he will be 'good'.The thing that really caught my attention was the creative use of colors. This becomes obvious right from the starting title, which is has a bold red background. Other uses of color include the white and black outfits of the gang and the decorations of the rooms (the design of Alex's bed cloth especially sticks out). The music mostly consists of classical tunes from Beethoven, which mixes with the color to create a vibrant atmosphere. This, along with some of full frontal nudity, makes the film truly feel like a work of art.The performance by Malcolm McDowell as Alex is priceless. The rest of the acting in general is good, and the characters are very interesting. Its neat to see how their actions towards Alex are reversed from the first half to the second half. I found the Chief Guard to be an especially likable character; he serves as a comedic diversion during some of the darker scenes in the middle.A Clockwork Orange is rich in themes that include identity, choice, forgiveness, and crime. Kubrick creates a world that absorbs viewers without any effort and leaves them in awe. The movie itself is a journey that takes you through an experience that you would not have otherwise. It may even change the way you look at criminals. This is a movie not to be passed up!",9,2,4,6 October 2007
Pretty Woman," Decent comedy-romance that lacks anything special
","Pretty Woman is a comedy-romance that uses a basic plot and tries to make it interesting. It tells the story of Vivian Ward, a hooker that gets more than she bargained for when she persuades a rich business man to take her in for the night. The man, Edward Lewis, enjoys her company and offers her payment for the whole week if she stays. Then the typical romantic relationship slowly develops, with a predictable outcome. The plot tries nothing new and is too simple to garner much interest. The balance between business and love could have been good but is underplayed.The acting delivers mixed results. Generally, Richard Gere and Julia Roberts do fine as the main couple. Unfortunately, a few scenes are genuinely unconvincing. The side actors are not bad, but put up forgettable performances. The music fits well, and the 'Oh, Pretty Woman' sticks out perfectly. The camera work and effects are average for the genre.The movie was not bad, but also not one that I would readily watch again. It was too shallow and didn't have anything to bring me back. It has no depth or hidden messages, just the straight story. Pass it up unless your a romance fan.",5,1,3,12 October 2007
It's a Wonderful Life," Uplifting and heart-warming tale
","It's a Wonderful Life is one of those movies that is beyond its time, especially in transferring emotions to the audience. The plot is highly sophisticated; it centers around the life of George Bailey, a successful business man that is thrown out of control when financial aspects hinder the progress of his Building and Loan enterprise. The business crisis is the focus of the story, but the majority of it is a laid-back reflection of the good parts of Bailey's life. In the end, Bailey is brought to redemption and sees the world in a new light, ultimately leading to one of the most uplifting endings in any movie.The cast was perfect all around; there was not a single actor that jumped out as a poor choice. James Stewart shines with the critical role of Bailey. He starts off as a confident and envisioned man, but is eventually consumed by business problems and sees no way out. He completely misses the positive impact that he has made on the community, but reaches a sort of understanding by the end. Stewart is excellent at conveying this development of ideas. Even Mr. Potter, the antagonist of the film, becomes a sympathetic character. Even though he initially comes off as a selfish pest, it is hard not to respect his business achievements and feel sorry that he does not enjoy other company.The plot is put together so well that it is impossible not to be drawn in, even for modern audiences. The idea of guardian angels watching over us might seem ridiculous, but ends up being an intriguing plot element. The mix of fantasy with reality works out. The camera work, dialog, and way the scenes were set up are surprisingly modern. It does not require the audience to watch the movie from the lens of someone from the 1940's, but rather is a timeless experience that can be enjoyed by families of any generation.Simply put, I recommend this movie to all people, especially as a family. If you get a chance, it would be best to watch it during the winter holidays because it fits in really nicely with the atmosphere.",9,0,2,20 October 2007
A Beautiful Mind," Excellent fact-based drama
","A Beautiful Mind is an excellent drama that has everything you would want: suspense, sadness, happiness, comedy, an engrossing plot, and good characters (although it doesn't have any real action, except for one sequence that comes to mind). It follows the life of John Nash (acted by Russel Crowe), a mathematician who graduated from Princeton. If you don't have any background on the movie before watching it (like me), then there is a pretty nice plot twist towards the beginning that completely changes the direction of the film.The film is excellent at illustrating the troubles that Nash encounters throughout his career. Its one of those things that just thinking about could drive you insane. But there are plenty of supporting characters (and opposing characters, that are quite complex) to help him out. In the end, the film gives a feel-good conclusion.I didn't find the film to be spectacular in any one category, but everything came together to make a neat experience. Its one of those films where you are introduced to a completely different personality than yourself. This makes you think about all those things you haven't taken time to learn about (in this case, mathematics, schizophrenia, and a Nobel laureate's life). Then your left satisfied because you learned some things and had fun. This is a film you'll love if you like dramas.",8,0,1,5 October 2007
All Quiet on the Western Front," Touching antiwar story
","All Quiet on the Western Front is an early antiwar film about World War I. It focuses on the German side of the war, opening with a scene at a schoolhouse where a patriotic teacher enthusiastically tells his students to support the war. The students are converted and join the infantry. Soon after being deployed to the front lines, they realize that war is not as heroic or honorable as they came to expect.For being such an old film, All Quiet on the Western Front feels surprisingly modern and refined. The battle scenes are excellent, even though there is not all that much time devoted to them. The trench warfare and shell shock was very accurately recreated. It is considered to be one of the most violent films of the period, which is not a surprise. As Paul Baumer (the main soldier the film focuses on) goes around, he witnesses many gruesome deaths. The most touching moment comes when he kills a French soldier. Watching the slow death of the enemy, Baumer realizes that the war is pointless. This signifies a turning point in the film. There are a couple equally touching deaths toward the end, but I best not spoil them.There were some pacing and continuity problems. Although several parts were slow, the key scenes are well worth sitting through the whole thing for. The ending comes full circle, revisiting some of the important places and people from the beginning. The last scene is simply beautiful.The film has important antiwar themes and forces you to think about death in a different way. If you enjoy war films or complex situations, and don't mind sitting through older films, then you need to see this one.",8,3,5,26 January 2008
There Will Be Blood," Beautiful masterpiece centered on a dark personality
","There Will Be Blood is a riveting drama film centering on Daniel Plainview: an ambitious and egocentric oil prospector who develops a wealthy business by manipulating his competitors, employees, friends, and family. Three phases of his life are chronicled: his first oil deposit discovery, his consolidation of power by transforming a ranching community to a drilling field, and his personal struggles later in his life.Daniel Plainview is one of the most profoundly complex characters in film. There is ample truth in his character: selfishness, greediness, and ambition are traits that we are all familiar with. His character might be expected to be one dimensional from these traits, but this is not the case. Occasionally, we might sense remorse or sympathy from him (for example, when he holds the son from a killed worker), but it always turns out to be based on a selfish goal. The essence of his beliefs is summarized in an enticing dialog midway through the film, where he states that 'I see the worst in people'. Despite his unrelenting flaws, it is impossible not to pity him. Daniel Day-Lewis does a phenomenal performance as Plainview, which will certainly be remembered as one of his career highlights.The supporting characters are also well acted (although they don't stand out as much as Day-Lewis). Paul Dano does an interesting take as the preacher Eli, who serves as one of Plainview's opponents. Plainview and Eli parallel an industry versus religion struggle, which adds an important element to the film's main theme.Another strong point of the film was the music. There is no powerful theme or melody. Instead, it consists of disjointed and convoluted sounds. Occasionally, the tone of a melody may be heard, but its rather unconventional. I liked this type of music and felt that matched perfectly with the film's atmosphere. The music and visuals (primarily of the desert environment) were adhesive complements. An example of this is a scene where the drilling tower catches fire. The contrast of dark and bright colors with the thumping music in the background creates a vibrant sensation.There Will Be Blood is now my favorite movie of the year (with a close, but discernible second of No Country for Old Men). The direction was beautiful, the acting was incredible, and the plot was engrossing. The themes were important and it left a strong aftertaste. If those are the things you look for in a film, then you can't go wrong with There Will Be Blood.",9,4,8,11 April 2008
American Gangster," 'American Gangster'; fitting name
","Crime-drama/gangster movies generally fare well (The Godfather, Goodfellas, The Departed, etc.). American Gangster continues that streak. It follows the rise and fall of a black family crime empire, headed by Frank Lucas (played by Denzel Washington). Lucas is successful because he imports drugs directly from Vietnam, resulting in a stronger dose for lower price. The real hurdle is met when a detective, Richie Roberts (played by Russell Crowe) pursues a lead to bring down the empire. The plot starts off slow, following the distinct daily lives of Lucas and Roberts. After the first hour or so of setting things up, everything comes together to form a compelling story. The last hour is extremely high quality across the board.The direction from Ridley Scott is as expected: clean and elegant. The acting from Washington and Crowe is also as expected: powerful and believable. These two factors are the key to what makes American Gangster so good. It reminded me in several ways of The Departed: the first hour sets up and develops the characters, while the rest is a beautiful clue hunt and battle of smarts. The whole thing is unpredictable but flows in a logical way. One thing that I especially liked was the Vietnam War reflections. Throughout the film, there are snippets of television news programs that reveal the breakdown of the war. It effectively parallels the growth and decay of Lucas's drug empire. The drug production sets were realistic and effective. While most of the movie revolves around the drama aspects of crime, there were some fantastic action sequences.In the end, I was left with plenty of material to think about. There are interesting points about the drug empire and moral questions that arise from the conclusion. The main message is not hidden; it is expressed explicitly in a dialog between the two characters toward the end. Ultimately, I was left satisfied. One of the best movies of the year, so don't miss it.",8,1,7,4 November 2007
The Deer Hunter," Beautiful production about the importance of home and friendship
","The Deer Hunter is about a band of close friends that is broken apart after three of them decide to serve the country in Vietnam. It begins with many celebrations; a wedding, a deer hunting excursion, and a night at the bar. The gang drinks heavily and does many foolish things (such as swerving in front of a semi with their car), but are tied together by friendship and have genuine care for each other. When Mike, Steven, and Nick leave for Vietnam, the whole group is forever changed.Robert De Niro does an impressive portrayal of Mike, the one who has the most success in Vietnam. The majority of the film is witnessed from his perspective, which makes sense since he retains his mentality the best. Christopher Walken also does a notable performance as the disturbed Nick, who is dragged into betting with his life via Russian Roulette. There two characters are the main focus of the plot; Mike witnesses Nick's gradual decline and attempts to save him.Russian Roulette is an interesting way to illustrate the impact of Vietnam on soldiers. This is probably the thing that most separates it from the other Vietnam movies around. The Russian Roulette scenes are disturbingly tense, despite the fact that they are quite predictable. The other Vietnam scenes are beautiful and realistic. It is overflowed with detail that makes the whole thing believable. You don't just watch the transformation happen; you feel it.The non-Vietnam segments are interesting and important, but I would say they are a bit overlong. The wedding part was especially long; I got the point after the first ten minutes of it. The deer hunting segments make up for it. The mountain scenery is simply magnificent (to the point that I swear that I could feel the mist). I suppose the advantage of spending extra time on the homeland scenes is that it makes you grow attached to it. The whole town (primarily the bar and Mike's house) feel reassuringly familiar, especially in contrast to the chaotic maze of Vietnam. This is a great contrast that is important for when Mike returns from Vietnam to revisit home.The Deer Hunter is among the best Vietnam films around. Currently, it rivals Apocalypse Now for my personal favorite Vietnam film. The thing that makes it so powerful is that it compares Vietnam chaos with benevolent life at home.",9,0,1,9 January 2008
Click," Drama aspects overpower the comedy
","I went into Click expecting a solid but simple comedy. It ended up being much more. I didn't get as many laughs as from typical Sandler films, but it touched me much more emotionally. The plot basically involves a job-serious man named Michael Newman that discovers a 'universal remote' that manipulates time, volume, and other things in real life. When using it, he becomes detached from his family in order to satisfy his personal tastes and lead a successful business life. The message is strong and powerful. By the end, its hard not to feel sympathetic towards Newman.The acting was great and the dialog was decent. Adam Sandler does a great job as Michael Newman, conveying the emotional impact of the remote perfectly. The other acting was great as well. The special effects were good, but a little bit overdone when displaying the interface of the universal remote menu. The first half was basically the comedy part; I got a few laughs but nothing priceless. During the second half, things really come together to create an intriguing story line. It reminded me a lot of Charles Dickens' A Christmas Carol, in which Newman plays the part of Scrooge and Morty (the remote vendor) is the ghost. Newman experiences his past, present, and future and sees the problems of his life. Despite this, the ending is very 'feel-good'.I was pleasantly surprised by the quality and content of Click. It is much different than Sandler's earlier films in a good way. One can't help being absorbed by the plot, despite numerous technical errors regarding the remote (which doesn't damage the story at all). Recommended for all viewers.",7,0,1,14 October 2007
Donnie Darko," Haunting but satisfying experience
","Donnie Darko has an unconventional plot that is intriguing but absurd. It follows the experiences of Donnie, a boy that survives a jet engine landing on his room by listening to an eerie voice that persuades him to leave the house. A man dressed in a bunny suit then becomes a normal sight in his life. The movie brings together many apparently unrelated events that cumulate in an effective conclusion.The music that is played between significant events fits very perfectly, both thematically and stylistically. The lyrics help watchers penetrate into the mind of Donnie. The character of Frank is visually impressive, leaving a haunting impression after every scene with him. Jake Gyllenhaal does a great job as Donnie, but the other acting was nothing special.The plot is creative but not without problems. The physics behind the time travel is a stretch, although I admit that is not the main focus of the film. Some of the individual segments are flawed and need additional explanation, but fortunately it all comes together nicely towards the end. The conclusion is wide open but at the same time gives complete satisfaction.Donnie Darko is one of those films that will stay in your head for a long time. The ideas very creative and carry several philosophical messages (many of which are directly mentioned during some of the scenes). The plot, despite some faults, is so far out of mainstream material that it is hard not to enjoy. The bunny suit will remain an image connected to the content of Donnie Darko forever.",8,1,4,7 October 2007
Atonement," Powerful
","I read Ian McEwan's Atonement novel a little over a year ago for class (it's not the type of book I'd read for myself). Naturally, I decided it would be interesting to see the critically acclaimed film adaptation. Atonement follows the novel faithfully, with the exception of a couple scenes. It tells the story of a imaginative child, Briony Tallis, who discovers a love relationship between her sister Cecilia and friend Robbie. She mistakes Robbie for a sexual maniac, and wrongly accuses him when another friend, Lola, is attacked in the night. The rest of the plot follows the consequences of this accusation and Briony's attempts at atonement.The film is Oscar quality in many ways. The direction is excellent; the complex plot is difficult to clearly convey on screen, but Joe Wright is able to put it together with few flaws. In the first half hour or so, the pacing is a bit jumbled; this clears up as it develops. The camera-work is well done; a notable scene is the five minute single-shot recreation of the Dunkirk beaches. The acting is good from all parts and the character development is solid. The music score was also excellent; it really fit the mood of the whole movie and added a nice touch to the key scenes.Atonement is an emotional film. It carries a sense of sadness that few films are capable of. The remarkable thing is that the sadness is not at all depressing, but more sympathetic. It is sad to realize the extent of such a small moment and how it could tear lives apart. That is the main thing that makes Atonement a film that I would highly recommend.",8,2,3,14 January 2008
The Godfather," The epitome of cinema
","The Godfather is placed near the top of any reliable best films list. It is an American classic based on Mario Puzo's novel and directed by Francis Ford Coppola. It recounts the ascent of Michael Corleone to the head of his crime family, originally headed by his father, 'the Godfather' Don Vito Corleone. Don Vito is played by Marlon Brando in a key performance, which actually does not amount to all that much screen time (at least, relative to the whole film). The majority of the film focuses on Michael and his acquaintances trying to sustain an empire that satisfies their vision of an American dream.The film exhibits masterful quality in virtually every category. The acting is one of those key aspects. Although I'm not a fan of Al Pacino, his performance as Michael is unarguably a great achievement. Marlon Brando is even more iconic and unforgettable as Don Vito. Robert Duvall and Diane Keaton are good supporting actors. In addition, I think Sollozzo and the corrupt police captain are wrongly unappreciated as bad guys.The camera-work and direction is solid (although nothing groundbreaking). The music is fantastic. Although the main theme is most remembered, I believe the suspenseful music used to lead up to inevitable encounters is more important. It makes the tension come straight through the screen and into the audience.The movie is a little on the long side, but most of the time the scenes are completely engrossing. It would be difficult for anyone to argue that The Godfather is not a great film. While its not my favorite movie of all time, it deserves its place in critic lists. It is as near perfect a movie as you can expect a human to make.",10,2,5,10 January 2008
