Skyfall," My Review
","I have just recently been to see this the 23rd outing in the series of Bond films,and i must say it was a real treat for any true bond fan.The plot was so much different to the past few from Goldeneye onwards,the film harks back to the good old days of Connery,and of course that added treat of seeing the Original Aston Martin DB5 in action just clinched the deal,Daniel Craig super as ever as 007,with an air of Timothy Dalton's role as bond slightly shining through,Dame Judi Dench again superb as M,Javier Bardem excellent as the bad guy Silva,and i have to say great performance by Ralph Fiennes as pompous MI6 boss Gareth Mallory,and was great to see one of this country's finest actors in cameo-role,Albert Finney as Kincade,also have to remark on actor Ben Wishaw as a very young Q.The film is a much darker bond film,showing the vulnerable but also caring side of bond,harking back to Licence To Kill,Overall one of the best,with a lot of twists and turns,and a remarkable ending,Adelle's song is a true winner,one that reminds me of a John Barry hit,so what will be the 24th in the chain,as i sat in the darkened cinema,end credits rolling,i pondered the idea,the idea of seeing a good old fashioned bond ending,remember those far off bond days,when the baddies hidden lair was stormed at the end by hundreds of guys in boiler suits,007 leading the fight,maybe even actor David Hedison reprising his role as the famous Felix Lieter,but as far as bond films go,Skyfall is a winner.",10,6,20,29 October 2012
