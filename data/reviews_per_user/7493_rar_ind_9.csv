Sucker Punch," Eyecandy material
","Me being a fan of Zack Snyder's movies, I went into see Sucker Punch with the correct level of expectations and I came out happy. The movie similar to other Snyder's movies, is fantasy based and high on style with stunning slow-motion action scenes and a pulsating background score. If you expect a classic cinematic masterpiece, give this one a miss. This movie needs to be seen as a out n out commercial entertainer. Girls ruled the movie and they looked hot(particularly Jamie Chung). Great art direction and good editing. This movie might not do well in US but will definitely rake in the moo-la in Orient countries. Snyder's creative imagination knows no bound. 300 , Watchmen and now this movie. I would definitely watch this movie again. Now waiting for Snyder's Superman reboot :)",6,9,17,26 March 2011
Terminator Salvation," This franchise deserved a better treatment
","I got to see the movie last night.I didn't have much expectations from the movie and I did come out with mixed feelings.I thought the movie was made with an unclear idea.The writing and story is not upto the mark.Its tough to match James Cameron but they fell well short.The movie doesn't really have a solid base but it was not boring in any means.It's the kind of movie which doesn't give anything to think about once it ends(contrary to what Mcg said) The acting was good.Christian Bale tried too hard and gives a decent performance.Bale gives a lot of credibility to John Connor.It clearly shows that he has done a lot of homework but sometimes, it's just enough if you act normally, which Bale is quite capable of.Sam and Anton were great.I don't know what Common was doing in the movie.Direction by Mcg, was not upto the terminator standards.Writers have done a very bad job.Skynet looked like a sky tower controlled by some humans.Skynet's human capture zone looked more like a dance bar with inferno and dance lights.I also felt Arnold's CGI appearance was not required and the climax was intentionally made to resemble the previous films.How about some originality guys? Overall, i feel the producers have gambled with a huge budget but I am sure the movie will be a success outside the US since it will be a fun movie to watch.There is no fear factor due to the PG13 rating.But I guess it should have been R.I give it a 7 out of 10 and i hope the franchise is allowed to Rest in Peace.We don't want another film unless it is made by James Cameron",7,3,9,29 May 2009
The Prestige," absolute class
","the prestige is the one of the best Hollywood movie i have seen.t2 and rocky balboa were my previous favorites. This movie is a pure masterpiece.It has the best screenplay and individual performances. Chris bale continues to impress again....Chris Nolan is such a amazing director,i cant see anyone else directing this movie to such perfection...This film cant be remade anywhere else... One who did not get he hang of the movie the first time,has to see it again...you will be amazed.. I cant imagine how much time it took to write this magnificent script,its just top notch..This movie is way better than departed or some other 2006 movie,it should have got an Oscar 100/100..",10,4,7,7 September 2007
The Flowers of War," Artistic n Touching
","I haven't seen many Chinese movies before but had to see this due to Bale's presence and I am glad that I saw. Great movie on the summation of beautiful photography, neat(but sometimes over the top) acting and few good war set-pieces. Christian Bale shows why he won the Oscar with a performance that shows transformation from a filthy persona to a responsible one. His facial expressions are a treat to watch particularly when he tries to conceal the truth with the Chinese girls. If you are a CB fan, you have to like the ending of the movie just because of the signature look on his face while driving away the truck. Ni Ni, the female lead is beautiful and does her part well. I thought the buildup of romance between Bale and Ni Ni was very well done, reminiscent of the traditional Asian way in which a male has to win over the heart of a female to make love. The pace of the movie is not tearaway and it moves at its own pace and I think its justified with the emotions in play with the characters. Direction is top notch on the strong base of a lavish production. Overall, I would recommend this movie to war film enthusiasts and also others.",8,2,4,23 May 2012
Chak de! India," Best of 2007!
","We have seen a lot of underdog sports movies over the years which have been inspirational,cinematic and realistic...chak de India follows the realistic genre..... the film is very predictable in most parts but what makes the film memorable is the performance of the actors,screenplay,direction and also the background score...its a patriotic movie which depicts the story of women's hockey in India,the difficulty faced by the coach in uniting a diverse team and finally make them successful...srk pulls of a fantastic performance without his signature songs and dance...he has silenced all his critics with this performance....amin deserves a perfect 10 for direction which makes him the director to look out in the future....bgm is great throughout the movie...finally all those young girls deserve a standing ovation for their respective roles(most of them are débutante's) My verdict: a must watch...best of 2007",10,39,55,13 August 2007
Man of Steel," Fast paced action and visually appealing
","I have been a fan of Zack Snyder's work and when I heard he would be filling the director's shoes for Superman, I was excited. Man of Steel works at many levels. A solid story that starts from Krypton and ends at our world. One is made to feel like a Kryptonian more than a Earthling and the screenplay is very natural. I felt that the pacing was quite good and there was never a dull moment. The action is thick and realistic and you can expect a lot of destruction and havoc, but still befitting for a Superman movie. The casting was apt and Henry Cavill and Russel Crowe are the standouts but I will credit Zack for this movie's success and I hope WB persist with him for the sequel.",8,155,284,12 June 2013
The Dark Knight," The Dark Knight experience
","The Dark Knight is no ordinary summer Hollywood flick,it is unconventional,convoluted and most precisely BRILLIANTAfter weeks & weeks of surmounting hype with the media throwing in all possible tidbits about the movie,the movie still managed to live up to the hype.This effort by a dedicated set of actors and technicians will certainly be remembered for a long long time.. I am not going to spill the beans by giving the whole movie plot,but i sure can review it The most probable question in your mind would be 'Who was the show-stealer??' .The answer to this question is a no-brainer now(Thanks to all those critics who watched this movie a week ago),it is Heath Ledger.His final performance surely does leave an impactHeath literally lived the role of The Joker and everything about him was great,be it the dialogues or the body languageOn a scale of 10,i give him 11,no villain in the recent past has been as menacing as the jokerIt is sad that he died earlier this year.He was a great talent and he would have given us more memorable roles.Big round of applause for him and i surely hope he is nominated for the Oscars next year..RIP!! Outwardly,just like Batman Begins,the whole city of Gotham is made to tremble and joker brings the whole city to a standstill with multiple homicides,explosions and threats.The trio comprising of Batman,Lt. James Gordon and the new district attorney Harvey Dent join hands in wiping out the skum of Gotham City and they are quite successful until the city's thug mob give in to Joker's terms and what follows is sheer chaos.Joker goes on a killing spree demanding the batman to reveal his true identity and he almost succeeds!!The whole story involves a lot of sacrifices to counter Joker's moves and as an audience,we are jolted by one twist after the other.The story surpasses the mundane superhero storyline and is just inches away from realitySee it,to believe it!! From the acting department,everybody give their best.My favorite Christian Bale delivers yet again as Batman and also as Bruce Wayne although he has very less screen time as Bruce Wayne.Bale is very much self assured but looks a tad anemic.He reprises his role just as a day at the office.Gary Oldman is given more scope this time around and he looks resolute as Lt. James Gordon.Aaron Eckhart is a new member to the cast and this is the first time i have seen him in a movie.He does well as the dedicated DA and also as the vengeful Two-Face.Maggie Gyllenhall,Micheal Caine and Morgan Freeman go about their roles with finesse and no one looks wasted at the end.The director Nolan had a clear picture of what we wanted and his ensemble deliver just the sameBravo!! Coming to the technical department,the background music was just pulsating and concise.Hans Zimmer and James Newton Howard rework on their Batman Begins theme and bring about an haunting experience which lasts the movie's length.This movie deserves it.Cinematography by Wally Pfister is top notch and is award worthy.I was dazed with the camera movements .Editing was jarring sometimes but very much acceptable.But do save your praise-points for Christopher Nolan,Jonathan Nolan and David S.Goyer.Christopher Nolan is the man who made Memento and The Prestige and he now according to me,holds the distinction of being called the most sophisticated director in Hollywood.Nolan's direction is very much in keeping the movie pacy and also elaborate at the same time.Screenplay is tight as usual.His brother Jonathan teams up with Goyer for penning the story and they sure have done their homework with the comic books .Supposedly,they have read a heck lot in bringing together a serious crime epic of a movie.Oscar worthy stuff!! And now,my favorite moments from the film 1.) The start of the movie.a urban bank robbery which acts as a superlative intro for the Joker. 2.) The scene where Batman jumps from the top ledge of a skyscraper to gate-crash into some thugs 3.) The pre-interval chicken chase scene was just AWESOME with old fashioned stunts and gripping music.This is as good as the climax chase in Terminator 2!! 4.) All of Joker's scenes..and also his preening HEHEHE In a nutshell,the movie was just great and it can be seen more than twice.By the end,we were left gasping for more,everybody was unwilling to move from their seats,such was the impact.It was 152 minutes of a thrill ride.Batman and Joker brawl their way into a slobberknocker and their escapades make me think by picturising the batman as a silent dark do-gooder who detests the limelight and who does everything to be within his code of ethics and the joker who is the Satan or the anti-Christ with absolute chaos as his solve motive,a person who is an crime artist with a love for the theatrics.Together,they are yin-yang but they are fun to watch So what are you waiting for,get a load of The Dark knight before your friends deliver the spoilers.",10,2,5,18 July 2008
Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice," Brilliant cat and mouse game between four characters
","Before going into the movie, there were multiple issues for the writers and Zack Snyder to contend with. First, the large-scale destruction in MoS (an inconsequential issue raised by some people). Second, the attempt in bringing a fresh outlook to Batman, without redoing the whole origin story again. Third, the need to setup a proper pathway to the justice league movies. I think they addressed all these issues along with a riveting story-line, at least till the last 30 minutes where it became slightly predictable. This is probably Snyder's best work since Watchmen. The allegiance to comic book style storytelling was very much apparent. The story made sense and it did not appear to be rushed. This movie will be loved by DC comics readers. The character of Lex Luthor has been written very well particularly. The story is basically a cat and mouse game between four characters - Batman, Superman, Lex and Wonder Woman. Cinematography is top-notch with perfect lighting and good use of camera angles. The background score deserves special credit. The new themes of Batman, Lex and Wonder Woman are outstanding. Batman theme accurately shows the transition of mood from despair to rage. Superman's character in this movie is something similar to how Batman was treated in Nolan's Dark Knight. The character was made to suffer, repent and stay grim all through the movie. But, the characterization made sense in the overall context of the movie. I hope WB make more movies for the DCEU. Overall, this was a near- perfect movie for me. Certainly, the best comic book adaptation in recent times.",10,6,14,24 March 2016
Live Free or Die Hard," wow!!
","Die hard 4.0 is an excellent movie... a perfect popcorn flick as you could call....the movie has everything right from hacking,an interesting plot and hardcore action...Bruce Willis pulls of a fantastic performance out of nowhere(haven't seen him in any film for a while)... computer whiz kids will have a strong liking for this movie... director wise-man does well and keeps the movie moving in a good pace... scenes to watch are the subway scene(excellent screenplay) and the climax chase(too cool!!)... for me,this is the best movie of the year followed by Transformers...way to go Bruce,you are a action guru...strongly recommended",8,2,4,1 October 2007
