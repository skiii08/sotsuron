The Blair Witch Project," Excrutiatingly Terrifying
","Everyone you talk will say, oh, it wasn't scary, it was hokey. Oh, I wasn't frightened for a minute. This is the worst movie I've ever seen. And critics are saying this film was overhyped? I don't think so. Not since 'Event Horizon' (a film that was much scarier than anyone said it was) have I ever been so frozen with terror. I just sat down in the theater and let the suspense build up to a point where I couldn't move any longer. This was an excellent film. It might not have been as scary as the billing suggested, but that doesn't mean it wasn't scary as hell. 'The Blair Witch Project' chronicles the journey of three student filmmakers who venture into the woods near Burkittsville, Maryland while trying to film a documentary about a witch supposedly living in the hills who would take children into her house to draw blood from them. Even though the filmmakers never have a direct encounter with the witch, what happens to them is just as bad. They begin to fight, lose their food, direction, and find themselves fighting for their lives while in the meantime they're being stalked by someone they don't even know is watching them. As I've said before, in my opinion anyway, 'The Blair Witch Project' was an excrutiatingly terrifying film. Many people will have their own opinions, and I don't intend on challenging that, but if you ask me, it was excellent. The camerawork was crude but still had some incredible shots, the editing was masterful, the direction was also great, but what really takes the viewer are the performances of the three unknown actors, Heather Donahue, Joshua Leonard, and Michael Williams. Slowly they take their characters from happy, to goofy, to normal, to anger, sadness, and then finally terror. They won't get nominated for any Oscars, but they were still great. I give 'The Blair Witch Project' 5 stars on a five star scale.",Null,0,1,31 October 1999
Catch Me If You Can," Lightly dramedic period piece
","Since 1993, Steven Spielberg has burdened himself down in heavy material. After releasing 'Jurassic Park' that year, he won a best picture Oscar for 'Schindler's List,' and with the exception of '97's 'The Lost World,' has had trouble making a happier movie since. He followed the '93 pattern that year, releasing the depressing true story of 'Amistad,' 'Saving Private Ryan' in '98, and in the past two years, two bleak visions of the future, 'A.I.: Artificial Intelligence' and 'Minority Report.' Is Spielberg saying something by making a lighthearted flick that takes place in the past? 'Catch Me If You Can' finally pulls Spielberg out of the doldrums, quickens the pace, and leaves his audience with a pleasurable experience. At the same time, he gives Leonardo DiCaprio a chance to prove he's very capable of pulling off a great performance that is a driving force in a great film.Frank William Abagnale Jr. (DiCaprio) lives a happy young life with his father, Frank Sr. (Christopher Walken) and his French mother, Paula (Nathalie Baye,) whom Frank Sr. met during WWII in Mont Richard, France. They have a happy family, but Frank Sr. has had far too much trouble managing his finances and runs into endless trouble with the IRS. As a result, Paula leaves him for a family friend, and Frank Jr. runs away. Frank Jr. did, however, pick up a few con artist tricks from his father while he tried to dodge his financial troubles, and he never forgot them.Frank Jr. cons his way into a position as a co-pilot for Pan Am Airlines, printing fraudulent cheques to maintain a financial balance. From there, he successfully impersonates a lawyer and a doctor on the way to cashing over 5 million dollars in fraudulent cheques, which soon earns the ire of the FBI. Agent Carl Hanratty (Tom Hanks) is hot on his trail and is outwitted at every turn. He is embarrassed by Frank's actions and his coworkers and superiors begin to lose their confidence in him. But soon enough, as his fatehr becomes less of an asset to him, Frank turns to Carl for a parental figure for lack of his own parents. He turns to the only one left who is watching out for him... even if all he's trying to do is catch him.
'Catch Me If You Can' is a whimsical film. The chemistry between DiCaprio and Hanks hit just the right notes, creating a delicate relationship that fuels a lightly comedic drama about family. DiCaprio starred in two of my favorite films of 2002, this one and 'Gangs of New York,' though in the latter he did little more than fill the space of the lead role. He truly comes into his own in this film, playing a lost young boy looking for a father, and using a variety of criminal means to get that attention.
There are three stars in this film: one is DiCaprio; another is Tom Hanks, who breaks his emotionally-repressed typecast and plays a role that allows him to be funny and touching at the same time; the third star is the amazing effort that went into staging a '60's period piece. Every visual detail is authentic, from the bathing suits, to John Williams' score bookended by appropriate hits from the period, as well as the costumes and production design. It's all spectacular - this film is a dead ringer for any popular '60's setting.What made me happiest about 'Catch Me If You Can' is that Spielberg made a film that I could enjoy without feeling guilty about it. I couldn't easily say the same for 'Schindler's List' or 'Saving Private Ryan,' but here the director has returned to his better form, the form that made me love his early films in the first place - let there be hope he continues in the same vein. 4 stars on a five star scale.",Null,0,1,18 May 2003
Blade," As good as a vampire-hunting film comes
","Recent action directors have carried with them a message about how to make an exciting action film. This is the message: if you're going to make an action scene, make it look really good. 'The Matrix' directors Andy and Larry Wachowski took with them that message, as did Alex Proyas with 'The Crow', and so does director Stephen Norrington with the best vampire-hunting film ever made, 'Blade'. Wesley Snipes and Stephen Dorff star.
Blade (Snipes) is a part-human, part-immortal vampire hunter who was born just as his mother was giving birth to him. At the time, she had been bitten by a vampire directly before she gave birth to Blade. That was 1967. Jump 32 years into the future, and you will arrive on the present day, where an evil vampire lord named Deacon Frost (Dorff) has begun to act on his plan to overthrow the human race and populate the world with vampires. Blade has become a full-fledged warrior who, with the help of his friend and mentor Abraham Whistler (Kris Kristofferson) intends to stop Deacon Frost from doing so.
Frost, however, has some more plans of his own. He has translated the vampire language (and God knows what it's called) and now has the ability to summon the power of the Blood God, an evil spirit which will make it that much easier to overthrow the human race. The whole vampire population will be given powers allowing them to never be hurt, even by a wooden stake. Blade must stop this from happening as well, before the world is taken over by vampires.
'Blade' was a violent, exciting, well-crafted action-horror film, if not having been rather gory for most of its duration. The film is visually arresting, with excellent cinematography and film editing so hypnotic, you'd think the film itself was on speed. There was also a powerhouse techno soundtrack, featuring a fast remix of New World Order's 'Confusion' which made the action scenes more exciting yet. The special-effects were generally good dazzling, although some were extremely unconvincing. And as for the acting, well, Stephen Dorff was respectably terrifying as the evil Deacon Frost, and Wesley Snipes is all right, although this is not even close to his best performance. But the film is so atmospheric and energetic that you hardly have any time to pay attention to the acting. I give 'Blade' 3 stars on a five star scale.",Null,0,1,12 November 1999
Sleepy Hollow," Striking film by a creative director
","Tim Burton has quite the reputation for being one of the quirkiest directors in Hollywood. His previous efforts include the bizarre 'Beetlejuice', the melancholic drama 'Edward Scissorhands', and the visually striking animation of 'The Nightmare Before Christmas'. One thing that every one of his films has in common is their sense of originality in one way or another, whether it be the storyline, the performances, or the visual aspect of the film. While most of it may not be very original, 'Sleepy Hollow' still manages to execute a striking picture, yet still containing Tim Burton's quirky pace and direction.
It is 1799 and, and as the film states, the world is at the dawn of a new millennium (apparently the screenwriters got themselves confused with the mass hysteria of reality at the time of the film's release and incorporated it into the film). A hamlet in upstate New York known as Sleepy Hollow has become notorious and controversial for some bizarre goings-on about town. According to recent reports, there have been several bloody murders attributed to a serial killer known as the 'Headless Horseman'. This killer has become infamous for his method of beheading his victims to kill them.
Constable Ichabod Crane (Johnny Depp) is a police officer in New York who does not believe in the big city's method of solving crimes: if a man is found in the water, he drowned. If he has a hole in his body, he was shot. Crane believes in sense and reason, and that there is a logical explanation for everything that occurs in society. He wishes that the New York City police department would allow him to do autopsies upon victims of crimes in the city. He appeals his ideals to a judge, who reassigns Constable Crane to Sleepy Hollow to investigate the murders occurring there.
Once in Sleepy Hollow, Crane is asked to stay at the house of Baltus van Tassel (Michael Gambon), the patriarch of the van Tassel family and highest member of society in Sleepy Hollow. Crane makes eyes at his beautiful daughter Katrina (Christina Ricci) as soon as he enters the house, Katrina returning the favor. Crane recollects what his superiors have told him about the crimes in the sordid little hamlet and then finds out that he had not been told the whole story. van Tassel informs him of the murders and the true story of them, the fact that they are attributed to the Headless Horseman, and Crane remains in reality, refusing to believe that a supernatural force could commit such crimes.
Crane, now having been in Sleepy Hollow a while longer, is called into question about his beliefs in sense and reason when he sees a beheading with his own eyes. While talking to the town's local magistrate, the horseman rides into Sleepy Hollow, sword in hand, and lobs off the man's head. Crane now doubts any belief in reality and starts to further examine these crimes. A large factor in his investigation is the fact that the horseman did not go after him when he beheaded the magistrate. He notices that the horseman is not exactly a random killer who beheads every person he sees, but that there is more to him, and that he may be motivated in some way or another.As Crane continues his investigation of the beheadings, he finds himself more unwelcome in the town and sees that the citizens think he has uncovered too much. van Tassel and other high members of society in the town don't want him there much longer and plot to have him run out of the town, never having solved the mystery. Crane refuses these attempts to be rid of the town and thrown off the case and continues his investigation as fast as he can before the horseman rides into town and beheads another victim. Through Crane's investigation of this strange town, sparks will fly, fires will rage and heads will roll.
'Sleepy Hollow' was a throughly enjoyable film. While not for the weak at heart (or the weak-stomach for that matter), the film is an extremely well-plotted, performed, and spectacularly-visual film. Tim Burton's passion for the supernatural is ever-present in this film as he explores the other side of reality and the supernatural for that matter. The film is brilliantly designed and photographed, and seems to have an old-fashioned black-and-white feel about it, only a few colors emerging out of the film's dark theme and atmosphere. Johnny Depp is entertaining to watch in the lead role as a weak-hearted police officer who questions his own beliefs as he is drawn into a place that is both mentally and emotionally challenging. All in all, this film was spectacular and refuses to let its audience down when it comes to entertaining it. I give this film 3 1/2 stars on a five star scale.",Null,0,1,24 June 2000
The Matrix Revolutions," Just like I imagined
","After seeing 'The Matrix Revolutions' I made sure to come online as soon as possible to see where I left off with my review of 'Reloaded.' I ended the latter review predicting, but hoping against the Wachowskis collapsing under the weight of their material. Now that I've seen the final instalment in the 'Matrix' trilogy, my own prophecy was correct - the Wachowskis tank, and they tank hard. This film makes for one of the most disappointing trilogies in film history since the Star Wars prequels (I know we have yet to see the final instalment there, but do you really think that series can resurrect itself from lines like, 'We live in a real world! Come back to it!') The looser ends created by 'Reloaded' have an attempted mending in 'Revolutions,' and they fit to some degree, but they don't make a tight whole. Keanu Reeves, Laurence Fishburne, and Carrie-Anne Moss sing a swan song for their careers in 'The Matrix Revolutions.'250,000 sentinels have begun digging down into Zion, one for every man, woman and child in the last surviving human city, and all the humans have on their side are hope, mech warrior and a whole lotta bullets. And oh yes, there's Neo, but by this point he's become little more than a vegetable, having passed out and sunk into limbo after a face-to-face confrontation with a sentinel at the end of 'Reloaded.' Also, Agent Smith (Hugo Weaving) has uploaded himself into the real world via the body of Bane (Ian Bliss), a soldier on a ship fighting alongside the Nebuchadnezzar.
Neo wakes up, finding himself in the Mobil train station (an anagram for Limbo) unable to leave at the behest of the Trainman (Bruce Spence) in the most gripping scene of the film. Trinity, Morpheus and Seraph (Sing Ngai), the Oracle's bodyguard from the first film, are left with the task to get him out, forced to make quick work of the Trainman and bring Neo back to the real world. The fate of humanity hangs in the balance, of course. Meanwhile, Trinity and Morpheus are forced to dispose of the Merovingian, which the Wachowskis solve by dropping him out of the story without resolution. Easy as that.The human resistance arms itself for battle amongst all this philosophical banter, and is set into the most draining action scene of the series as they are set upon by the machines in the forms of enormous drills which allow them a path into Zion. The human race tries as it might to stop the onslaught by the use of Mech Warrior-like machines that unload clip after clip against them. They enjoy some success, but cannot defeat the machines alone - they require the help of Neo, who has committed himself to enter the Machine City (01, for those who've not yet watched 'Animatrix: The Second Renaissance') so that he may negotiate a peace with the central brain of the Machines, appropriately called Deus Ex Machina (Henry Blasingame).
In the Matrix, Agent Smith has copied himself into an army of... well, himself, and is infecting programs of the Matrix each time he copies himself again. He has now gone rogue and fights no longer with the Machines who created him - humans and machines have a common enemy, and Neo is the only one who can stop him and, hopefully, secure a peace for Zion. This negotiation will culminate in the answers to everyone's questions, to Neo's fate and purpose, the future of humanity, and whether everything the Architect told him at the end of 'Reloaded' was true. To recap quickly, the purpose of 'The Matrix Revolutions' is to answer for us if Zion will be destroyed a sixth time and if Neo will survive it and begin a new Zion so that it can be destroyed once more. The humans and Neo have much to fear, for the Machines have destroyed Zion five times already and have become 'increasingly efficient at it.''The Matrix Revolutions' has been passed off by most critics and audiences as a terrible movie that does not tie up any loose ends that were made loose by 'Reloaded.' This is not completely true, but may seem so to anyone who does not understand what the 'Matrix' trilogy is based on. The best way to understand the story is to see it in Biblical terms, seeing the Real World as Heaven and the Matrix as Hell. Agent Smith and his minions were cast out of Heaven for defying the natural order (by surviving after being destroyed) and have embarked on their own agenda. The Machines want to punish humanity with complete destruction (Genesis Flood story) for having helped him come back to a level of strength that rivals the Machines, and Neo, the obvious Jesus figure, is the only one who can save humanity by defeating Smith. Neo and Smith coexist as an unbalanced equation kept that way by the Oracle (Mary Alice) and the defeat of one over the other would balance that equation. Hence, the future of humanity hangs in the balance.The trilogy tells a very interesting story, filled with allusions to mythology, religion and philosophy, but ultimately fails to deliver the closure that its fans, audiences and critics were hoping for. This is due partially to the quality of the writing which is, well, terrible. Just as Roger Ebert said it himself, in the first film Agent Smith was the only one who spoke in monotone - in 'Revolutions,' everyone does. And it's annoying. Smith was an interesting character even when he spoke in such a monotonous voice, but that does not mean the human characters had any place to do the same thing. Now none of the characters mean anything to the audiences and therefore their hearts are not in keeping with the goals of the films.This is not to say the film is a failure on all counts. There are some very interesting scenes, particular the opening sequence in Mobil, where the Trainman, paralleling the Boatman on the River Styx, refuses to allow the savior to leave and save his people. Even the philosophical ramblings have some merit here, but these are soon forgotten as the central characters head to Club Hell to drop the Merovingian and his wife Persephone from the story. The final battle sequence, as well, between Smith and Neo reaches momentary grandeur as Neo approaches his enemy in a torrential rainfall, all of his minions staring him down from all sides on the street and in the windows of buildings leading up to the big fight. The Battle of Zion is equally spectacular, but it is so long-winded, loud, and obnoxious it's boring. It's basically this movie's version of the Smiths battle in 'Reloaded.'At the end of the film, people all over complain that nothing has been explained, but that is only because they must not be aware of the story it is trying to tell. Loose ends are tied together, but no one cares. The beauty of the original 'Matrix' is that it told a story under a noirish cloak, and by this film has erupted into the action epic of a lifetime. It doesn't pull that off at all, partially due to the competition from another trilogy, but also that the trilogy loses its appeal some way, somehow by the final film. It is a wonder whether our race will be saved, but we just don't care anymore. 2 stars on a five star scale.",Null,0,0,3 January 2004
Terminator 2: Judgment Day," Surprisingly moving and exciting apocalyptica
","There's not an action filmmaker alive who does it better than James Cameron. He's given the world 'Terminator,' 'The Abyss,' 'True Lies,' 'Aliens,' and his masterpiece... 'Terminator 2: Judgment Day.' Cameron is one of few filmmakers I've seen who can take the details of a previous film and apply them with new and better insights in a sequel. He did the same thing with 'Aliens,' which he wrote an entire script for when he was given the following starting point: 'Ripley comes back to life.' This time around, Cameron gets to expand upon his own material, bringing back to life a feared character from his earlier 'Terminator,' and making him a protagonist whilst complementing him with an equally fearsome villain. Arnold Schwarzenegger is simply unforgettable in 'T2'.It is the year 2029 AD, and humanity is embroiled in a struggle for its survival. On August 29, 1997, Judgment Day occurred, an event where the entire human race nearly came into extinction from nuclear bombardment by the world's most powerful nations, leaving machines gradually begin to take over. In the future, John Connor has become a great leader for the human resistance, and an attempt was previously made on his life when a cybernetic organism, a T-100 Terminator (Arnold Schwarzenegger) was sent back in time to kill his mother, Sarah Connor (Linda Hamilton), before he was born. Luckily for humanity, his efforts were thwarted by Kyle Reese (Michael Biehn), a soldier sent back in time to protect her.Many years pass, John Connor (Edward Furlong) is eventually born, and is forced to grow up without a mother to guide him. Her visions of the dark future have placed her in a mental hospital, where the unforgiving Dr. Silberman (Earl Boen) will not set her free even despite good behaviour. Unbeknownst to all of them, the system that controls the machines in the future, Skynet, has sent a new, more advanced model of the terminator back in time, the T-1000 (Robert Patrick). This terminator is made of pure mercury, and can transform into any shape or image it encounters. Its mission is to find John Connor as a child and destroy him.
In the future, the adult John Connor somehow found out about this plot to destroy him, and sends a model T-101 (Schwarzenegger again) to protect him as a child. This sets the course for a long chase during which John Connor and the Terminator must free his mother from mental prison, destroy all precursors of the Skynet system, all the while fleeing the menacing T-1000, who proves harder to elude and destroy than even the T-100! John, Sarah and the Terminator are now embroiled in a race against time to save the Earth from Judgment Day and preventing the war against the machines before it happens.The magic of James Cameron's filmmaking is that he knows how to create consistency and add action appropriate to the story. He often engulfs his films in dark blue tones, and that's no exception here. His action scenes in all his films are relentless and violent, just as action should be. He takes no notice for what his audience can stomach, only what he feels is appropriate for length and for helping the storyline. He reaches new heights of special-effects advancement with T2, making spectacular use of only a total five minutes of CGI effects. The T-1000 is one of the most deadly and spectacular villains ever put on screen, and remains so to this day (it's 2003).Not that the film is without its flaws. I've never been a fan of Linda Hamilton. Frankly, her whining and her gasping and panting all the way through the 2.5-hour film got quite tiring for me. Her character was absolutely necessary, but there are other ways to communicate a repressed soul who fears the future. Nor was I a fan of Brad Fiedel's score as a piece of music. The score functions for the atmosphere, communicating a sense of dread all the way through that Jonathan Mostow could not duplicate for 'T3'; however, if one listens to the score on CD, you wouldn't believe how horrible it sounds as music.Aside from its small flaws, Arnold Schwarzenegger is never better than his performance here, delivering again his famous lines 'I'll be back' and 'Hasta la Vista Baby' with a conviction and brutality that's so convincing it's almost humorous. Edward Furlong delivers an impressive debut performance, playing a child who becomes an unwilling victim of fate and making it totally believable in the process. Schwarzenegger and Furlong have an excellent father-son chemistry that actually becomes touching in the end.With 'T2', Cameron has crafted a modern classic. Its beautiful special-effects, cinematography, and disheartening sense of dread will remain for decades in the collective memories of sci-fi, action and cinema fans alike. 4 1/2 stars on a five star scale.",Null,0,0,7 August 2003
Collateral," Michael Mann - master of the urban thriller
","An unoriginal idea for a thriller taking place in the most oft-used location for an action film next to NY is here placed in the hands of Michael Mann, a talented filmmaker responsible for such well-crafted dramatic thrillers as 'Manhunter', 'Heat', and 'The Insider'. Unlike his earlier films, here he experiments with a fairly formulaic plot, but lays it on so thick with style, great characterization and brilliant acting that within 15 minutes of the film's opening one forgets that they may have seen this plot before. 'Collateral', a hostage-and-hit-man thriller taking place on the mean streets of LA, in fact becomes more of a morality play than a simple action thriller, at least up until its final minutes. The familiar story is salvaged by a tense atmosphere, a script ripe with great characters and the magic hand of Michael Mann for crafting gripping action sequences wherever required.Many things happen as the dark blanket of night descends upon the City of Angels. An older man, Vincent (Tom Cruise), dolled up in dark sunglasses and a gray suit arrives at LAX and bumps into another man with whom he exchanges briefcases - we know immediately that this is not his first time to Los Angeles; a younger cab driver, Max (Jamie Foxx) gets set for the evening grind, preparing to cart around a multitude of characters and getting friendly with pretty clients by taking them on much faster routes throughout the city - we become immediately aware that this is a lonely man who has been on the job for a long time. Neither expects that their paths will ever meet, and when they finally do, the night falls out of their individual control as a number of meetings and incidents takes them both on a wild ride that forces them to question their morals and values.Vincent welcomes himself into Max's cab and touts himself on a real estate broker in town for one night to close a deal. Impressed with Max's ability to travel more efficiently between points A and B, he employs him for the night as his chauffeur in six Ben Franklins. Max is uneasy about this, but finds it difficult to resist Vincent's charm and a huge payroll in cash. Reluctantly, with cash in hand, he agrees to transport Vincent to 6 clients before the night is out.Waiting in the alley of an apartment block while Vincent goes inside to deal with his client, he remains in the cab finishing off his dinner when something happens that he never would have expected - the dead body of a adult male falls on the roof of his cab. Taken aback by this strange experience he jumps out of the cab and frantically informs Vincent of what has just occurred. 'He just fell on the cab! I think he's dead' 'Good guess,' Vincent answers, 'I shot him. Bullets and the fall killed him.' By allowing Vincent to hire him, Max has signed a death warrant as he soon discovers that he is the personal chauffeur for a hit-man on assignment to off six (well, five left) witnesses in a drug trial. He attempts to release himself from this terrible predicament, but Vincent is simply too intelligent for him and will not let him go until he has finished his work. Max does what he can to reason with him, but gradually discovers throughout the night that he is not dealing with a charming businessman, but a predator who pounces on his victims like a lion and does not let go until he has finished them off.Boasting a series of tense encounters and thrilling action sequences, Michael Mann is given fantastic material to work from in a clever, punchy script by Stuart Beattie. An unlikely pair, Tom Cruise and Jamie Foxx overcome their respective Hollywood reputations and succeed in portraying two characters of conflicting morals and social statuses who find themselves increasingly at odds with each other over the length of the film. There is fantastic chemistry between these leading men in a film that is certain to provide a turning point in both of their careers. Cruise succeeds unbelievably well at portraying a cold-blooded hit-man who manages to get under the skin of his foil and the audience at the same time. Conversely, Jamie Foxx is equally impressive as an innocent young man who for 12 years has kept his dreams of owning a limo company at bay and is forced to confront them in the guise of a predator who coldly advises him that his own morals exceed his. Vincent is a killer making a living through what he's good at - Max lies to his mother about starting a limo company even though he has spent the last 12 years driving a cab.In addition to these stars, the film boasts a multitude of memorable cameos, notably Javier Bardem as Felix, the drug lord whose guilt Vincent is trying to protect; Irma P. Hall as Max's ailing and naive mother; and Barry Shabaka Henley as a jazz musician who makes small talk about Miles Davis with Vincent shortly before he gets offed. Michael Mann has assembled a cast with excellent chemistry, bookended by fantastic cinematography and gripping, almost poetic action sequences. The shootout in an Asian nightclub is a particular standout, as Max and Vincent crawl through the club looking for an Asian crime boss whilst dodging a full house of young people gyrating to the sounds of 'Ready Steady Go' by Paul Oakenfold.Mann's use of a hand-held digital camera is unusual for a film of this variety, but it functions well - it provides an element of naturalism to a city that, while hellacious, is as real as it gets. A wonderful shot about 3/4 of the way through the film of 4 coyotes crossing a downtown street is one of the most compelling moments of the whole film - unexpected, and yet gripping for both the film's characters and the audience.'Collateral', although it fails to deliver at its ending, is a tense thriller that does exactly for the audience what Vincent does for Max - lodges itself under your skin and scars you, even for hours after the credits roll. 4 stars on a five star scale.",Null,0,0,9 September 2004
Batman Begins," Satisfying resurrection of a dead series
","Christopher Nolan must have felt a weight on his shoulders greater than Atlas when he signed up to revive the Batman franchise. After three films which successively spiraled downhill in overall quality since Tim Burton's 1989 original, Nolan, along with comic-book friendly screenwriter David S. Goyer ('Blade,' 'The Crow') and a younger, stronger, more intense Bruce Wayne in Christian Bale, had nowhere to go but upwards following the bottoming out of 'Batman and Robin' in 1997. He has wisely gone back to the beginning of the series and sought out the dark knight's darker roots in an effort that, though it plays out its story safely, succeeds in raising the series from the bowels of Gotham City.In a build-up edited to the speed of light, we are introduced to Bruce Wayne as a young boy, the son of a millionaire Thomas Wayne (Linus Roache), who lives at an enormous manor outside Gotham City. The young boy faces his first confrontation with fear when, playing with childhood friend Rachel, he falls down a well and faces a traumatic experience that haunts him into adulthood.Cut to Mongolia. Bruce Wayne (now played by Bale) is now an aimless wanderer, seeking respite from Gotham City following the murder of his parents and the city's subsequent fall into the hands of criminals and corruption. Recovering in prison, he is taken under the wing of Henri Ducard (Liam Neeson, who has now officially been typecast in the role of father-figure and trainer to younger heroes), a member of the secret brotherhood the 'League of Shadows', and trained to combat fear under the watchful eye of the menacing Ra's Al Ghul (Ken Watanabe). Ducard gives him the lesson that 'in order to overcome fear you must become fear' and is placed through a series of rigorous exercises, including some spectacular sequences which include a sword fight on ice as well as a breathtaking fight scene above a bed of ashes. Through his training with the shadowy brotherhood, he slowly restores his confidence in order to return to Gotham City.His spirit restored, Bruce Wayne returns home and rekindles his relationship with family butler Alfred (Michael Caine) and Rachel, who has grown into the gorgeous, yet bland guise of Katie Holmes. He has returned to a city which suffers still under the corrupt rule of crime lord Carmine Falcone (Tom Wilkinson), who has made some dangerous dealings with Dr. Jonathan Crane (Cillian Murphy), a scientist at Arkham Asylum who as the 'scarecrow' plans to unleash upon Gotham a chemical that induces fear in the minds of his patients. Wayne, meanwhile, has confronted fear face-to-face in the furthest corner of the world, and is not primed and ready to fight crime in the guise of the most fearsome creature to stalk the streets of Gotham City - the 'Batman'.An epic narrative that crams itself with some trouble into 2.5 hours, 'Batman Begins' is one of those rare cram-jobs that works. And how! Nolan wisely returns to Batman's darker origins, giving us the tortured, haunted Frank Miller hero rather than the Barnum and Bailey version of the latter sequels. Perhaps the wisest decision was the casting of Bale, one of the most intense actors in Hollywood who previously terrified audiences with his assaulting performance in 'American Psycho' and his self-destructive preparation for his role as an insomniac in 'The Machinist'. He brings to Bruce Wayne a haunted countenance that explodes into fits of brutality and violence as his fearsome alter-ego. Bale puts forth a character who scares the audience more with his relentless crime-fighting tactics than any one of the film's numerous villains.Likewise, Nolan was an appropriate choice at the film's helm, moving the action along at a swift pace, sometimes too briskly for the audience to fully comprehend. The film's early moments are so eager to complete Bruce Wayne's transformation into Batman that the audience barely has a chance to breathe. So, too, is the case with the editing, which appears to suffer from the 'Gladiator' syndrome, sometimes disallowing the viewer from understanding at all what is happening.Nevertheless, despite too much quick-cut editing and a Hans Zimmer score that refuses to shut up, Nolan hits his target. Perhaps a little off-center, but he successfully resuscitates a series which just 8 years ago seemed it would never recover. 3.5 stars on a 5 star scale.",8,0,1,14 August 2005
Moulin Rouge!," Learn to love LOVE again
","The summer of 2001 was, as most critics will wholeheartedly disagree, a fairly reasonable season for the movies. Sure, we've had some giant disappointments ('Pearl Harbor', 'Planet of the Apes' anyone?) but hey, 1999 had both 'Wild Wild West' and 'Star Wars: Episode 1 - The Phantom Menace' in the same summer, so 2001 can hardly have that held against it. Then, there have been some highlights this summer as well. 'A Knight's Tale' was some fun relief at the summer's opening, as well as 'Shrek', the ultimately hilarious CGI-film that surprised all who saw it, and then there was 'The Fast and the Furious', which can hardly be called an excellent film but was widely praised for its supercharged action sequences.
With impressive summer movies already put on my shoulders, there was one film missing in my so-called repertoire... I had been waiting to see it all year long. It was 'Moulin Rouge', a musical, of all things, directed by the man responsible for the dance-masterpiece 'Strictly Ballroom' and the bleak vision of society's association with William Shakespeare, 1996's 'Romeo + Juliet'. With all the hype behind it, and the fact that it was a Baz Luhrmann film, AND the fact that I had been waiting all year to see it, I could not afford to be disappointed... and I wasn't. This fantastic film was all I expected and much, much, MUCH more!
First, the story. Christian (Ewan McGregor) is a poor writer who deceives his father by moving to Montmartre, France, circa 1899. He has 'demenaged' to this 'city of sin', hoping to indulge the four things he believes make life worth living: truth, beauty, freedom and love. Once there, he moves into an apartment directly below the dwarvish French artist, Henri de Toulouse-Lautrec (John Leguizamo, nothing short of hilarious in his diminutive role), who is conceiving a mass-production for the notorious nightclub across the street, the 'Moulin Rouge'. Henri's problem: his star and associate writer is a narcoleptic Argentinian (Jacek Koman). After the Argentinian falls asleep through the floor into Christian's room below, Toulouse-Lautrec commissions Christian to help them out in writing the production they call 'Spectacular Spectacular!' Christian, seeing he has little choice in the matter, agrees to do so, and leaves an indelible impression upon Toulouse when Christian - dressed in Lederhosen and mounted above cardboard Swiss Alps - electrifies their creativity as he sings 'The hills are alive - with the sound of music!' Toulouse and his compatriates feel it is time for Christian to propose the production to the nightclub's owner, Harold Zidler (a very flamboyant and eye-catching Jim Broadbent).Once Christian enters the Moulin Rouge, he is immediately captured by this nightclub of dreams. The can-canning ladies enter the room belting out 'Lady Marmalade' with a background techno beat by Fatboy Slim, while at the same time the men seeking pleasure in these women burst into the room with their own, hyped-up, rousing version of Nirvana's 'Smells Like Teen Spirit'. This is a nightclub that would capture anyone, anyday, anytime, anywhere... even in our modern, shallow society that couldn't bare to get their money's worth with this masterpiece of a film.
But anyway, on with the summary! In the midst of this frantic foray, the jewel of Christian's eye in this nightclub is the marvelously gorgeous Satine (Nicole Kidman). She stumbles into his life looking like Marilyn Monroe on a trapeze, all the while singing Monroe's own 'Diamonds Are a Girl's Best Friend'. In a mysterious set of circumstances, Christian is arranged a meeting with this diva, and in turn captures her heart with his uncanny obsession with love and all he knows about it. This soon becomes a problem when the Duke of Worcestor (Richard Roxburgh) becomes aware. The Duke is the one whom Zidler turns to for investment in the nightclub. It is the Duke who will provide finances for 'Spectacular Spectacular!', but he'll only do it with a contract binding Satine's talents... and her body... to him. Christian and Satine, in turn, are forced to hide their love from the Duke so that the show can go on, Satine can be made into a star, and the two can go on, loving each other beyond time itself, happily... ever... after.
Had enough? I've only scratched the surface in terms of what there remains to be seen in 'Moulin Rouge'. This film, by all terms, is the perfect one for all who find their niche in the performing arts, whether it be music, acting, writing, or even loving itself. Conservatives, anal-retentives, and nitpickers I bid you beware... you'll be indulged by all that you may find to complain about with in the film. Perhaps 'Moulin Rouge' is an allegory for Baz Luhrmann's true mission as a filmmaker. It seems to me that Baz Luhrmann is an ambassador of love for all who cease to understand it. Think about it a moment, all his films have the underlying subject of love (in 'Strictly Ballroom' and 'Romeo + Juliet' it's quite clear, not to mention this one), and in each one he ventures to present the power of love, the pain of love, and the ultimate outcome of it all. He ventures to present every angle of love, not to merely let people know that it is 'good', because in some cases he lets us know how painful it is. But in the end, we realize that Maestro Luhrmann's mission is to show all his audiences how to love again, and personally, I believe he's done a far better job here than James Cameron did with 'Titanic' or, worse yet, Michael Bay and Jerry Bruckheimer did with 'Pearl Harbor'.
'Moulin Rouge' is a film where there is something for everyone. For singers and music lovers, there are a million songs we have all grown to love (and, in some cases, loathe) over the years, including Nirvana's 'Smells Like Teen Spirit,' Whitney Houston's 'I Will Always Love You,' U2's 'Pride (In the Name of Love),' Eden Ahbez' 'Nature Boy,' (performed in this case by David Bowie), and the latter singer's 'Diamond Dogs' and 'Heroes'. (Ironically enough, David Bowie beautifully masters Ahbez' jazz classic 'Nature Boy,' but he seems to have been kept as far away as possible from singing his own tunes.) For visual-seekers, the production design, costumes, and cinematography are more than enough to satisfy your ravenous eyes.  For musical-lovers, there's plenty of reference to musicals past, so you'll definitely find something to identify with here. And, even for the sarcastic and edgy-humored, you'll find much to enjoy with parodies of 'Titanic' and other sappy love stories of the past.
Whew! I think I've said enough to praise this film. Satan be the name of those who try to discourage me from loving it so dearly. I give 'Moulin Rouge' 4 1/2 stars on a five star scale.",Null,0,0,22 August 2001
The Matrix Reloaded," Beyond spectacular, matriculating sci-fi thriller
","Embarrassing as it is for me to admit it, 1999's 'The Matrix' was what first got me interested in dissecting and interpreting literature. I was in grade 9 at the time, so I can be forgiven. Needless to say, though, that with the cliffhanger ending of the first film, a brilliant marketing campaign, and a well-promoted anime build up, 'The Animatrix,' 'Reloaded' became a film I anticipated more than any other for about three years. And now that I've seen it, twice (once sober, once not) I don't know if I can say I'm disappointed, but something didn't quite do it for me.The second film picks up where the Animatrix episodes 'Final Flight of the Osiris' and 'Kid's Story' left off, with a warning that's been sent out to the human race that 250,000 sentinels are tunnelling their way into Zion, and will reach the city within 72 hours. In the meantime, Neo (Keanu Reeves) is struggling with a disturbing dream, in which Trinity (Carrie-Anne Moss) suffers a dark fate. The ensuing crisis forces the Nebuchadnezzar, with new operator Link (Harold Perrineau), to return to Zion, and bring Neo before his people for the first time. He is still struggling with his status as the One, unsure of what his function is.When the crew has returned to Zion for humanity to hear the news and to celebrate, Neo discovers the Moses-like appeal that Morpheus has to his people, standing on a rock and bellowing to the remainder of humanity, 'WE ARE NOT AFRAID!' after which the population moves into a percussion-driven rave to celebrate that they are all still alive. During this time, Neo sees the people have enough faith in themselves, and makes love to Trinity away from prying eyes. The rave scene was panned by most critics and viewers - I thought it was excellent, using an excellent selection by Fluke to drive the scene, and capturing the essence of what a rave truly is: a celebration of life and love, the two factors that are keeping humanity in existence. This scene perfectly encompassed the love humans hold for each other, as well as showing hope as the species' greatest strength.From there, however, it's time to get down to business. Neo and the crew of the Nebuchadnezzar leave Zion to find a way to stop these machines, and so they enter the Matrix. Neo goes to see the Oracle, who explains to him that he must find the Keymaker (Randall Duk Kim) who will lead him to the Source, where all questions will be answered, and Neo will be revealed his destiny. To get the Keymaker, Neo must go past the Merovingian (Lambert Wilson), who's guarding the important figure for his own benefit. Soon after, however, Neo is confronted by a newly-resurrected Agent Smith (Hugo Weaving), who found a way to survive his destruction in the first film, and to make things more complicated, he found a way to copy himself. So now, as Neo says, there are more Agent Smiths... 'a lot more.'Through a series of elaborate fights and obstacles, Neo struggles to find the Keymaker so he can truly learn his place in the world. He does not yet know whether he's supposed to save anyone, but his answers lie at the Source, where he encounters the Architect (Helmut Bakaitis), the creator and conceiver of the Matrix. The man speaks in elaborate computer and mathematical language, so that only Neo can understand what he's saying, though I'm sure even he had some trouble figuring it all out. The film leaves the audience with a number of questions: why is Neo here? What is his true purpose? How can Smith copy himself? Why, in God's name, couldn't the Architect have avoided using numbers and integers to speak when English would have done just fine? (Maybe because he's a machine... dumbass)'The Matrix Reloaded' functions as a sort of religious, mythological and philosophical lesson for a 21st Century used to special effects, techno music and kung fu action. This film tries to capitalize on its predecessor in every way, so that in the end it is stretched out to over two hours and forces its audiences to see it again to catch everything. That would be impossible for one person to understand every aspect of the film, for it is equal parts Christianity, Greek mythology, Zen buddhism, Platonic thought, computer technology, martial arts, and several other factors I've missed completely. The film might often be passed of as being too complicated, taking itself too seriously, and poorly outlined, all of which are true. However, in the case of this film, it can almost be forgiven - the sheer quality of the filmmaking and the special effects is so flawless in some scenes you'll forget anything else entirely.Certain parts of the film are unfairly criticized, namely, the fight with the army of Agent Smiths. Most audience members have asked, 'how come Neo didn't fly away earlier, like he did at the end of the scene?' Well, like the Oracle said, what kind of a One would he be? Neo's got a huge burden on his hands - he's supposed to be the savior of mankind, and if he's going to immediately run away from a fight with the beings he's supposed to defeat, well, who are they putting their faith in? Despite the fight scene dragging on a little long, it provides a chance for viewers to see some spectacular animation in action, not to mention an overload of spectacularly-choreographed fighting.The greatest strengths of the film lie in its effects, its cinematography (though diminished from the quality of the first film), the music (assigning techno group Juno Reactor to remix Don Davis' score was a stroke of genius) and its willingness to entice its audience to think. Not to mention it leaves the audience, again, with a cliffhanger, eagerly anticipating 'The Matrix Revolutions', due out in November. The final film gives the filmmakers a chance to put everything together - and they better do it right, or the Wachowskis will go down in film history as a filmmaking team that caves in under its own material. 3 stars on a five star scale.",Null,0,0,12 June 2003
