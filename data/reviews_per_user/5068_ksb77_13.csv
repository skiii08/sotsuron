First Man," Sublime
","First man is a far cry from typical Hollywood movies from this genre. Gone is the epic soundtrack replaced by raw sounds and the silence of space. Gone is the long sexy shots, gone the superhero trappings. This movie takes you on a journey to the moon from the perspective of Neil Armstrong. In the decades since the first moon walk we have been bombarded by images that have been sewn into the fabric of pop culture. MTV logo's,cheap posters and screen savers with Neil Armstrong standing on the moon. These romanticised views hide the incredible bravery, ingenuity, sacrifice and sheer horror of getting a man to the moon. First man shows us how it was, the impact upon colleagues, families and friends. This movie avoids the America is great rhetoric and instead focuses on the real challenges. The script is a slow burner and it's pacing may not be to everyone's expectations, this is not Apollo 13. It's takes its time to tell the human story. Extremely well directed and acted by the leads and support cast. Ryan Gosling delivers a thoughtful and introverted performance whilst Claire Foy counters this with an awesome performance as Mrs Armstrong. Portraying her fear and pessimism throughout every phase as she deals with the day to day realities of the risk to life. Go see it.",8,2,8,13 October 2018
Rogue One: A Star Wars Story," Almost......
","Excellent but not quite. Tonally a very different film to what you may expect but part of the Star Wars universe for sure and different in its look and feel. Although it beautifully shot and acted my issue with it is not an an issue with the film, its the fact that its prequel to one of my favorite films. So throughout the movie your waiting for those familiar moments to connect it to the start of Episode 4 and don't get me wrong this does deliver. However its all a bit anti climatic, did I really care about all the cliff hanger moments leading up to the start of episode 4? ...Well no actually I didn't care for them at all because I knew they would succeed in their mission and their ultimate fate either way didn't bother me...and that ultimately bothers me. I should care about the characters, I want to care about the characters. Thererfore for me it wasn't really a story worth telling. Its a geeks dream with lots of little easter eggs all over the place. Overall it was like a trivia movie that answers questions that I didn't ask e.g. Did you know who invented the death star and have you ever wondered what their story was? Did/do you want to know and do/did you care ? If you did or do then this film is amazing and tells it in a brilliant way. Its a disjointed film, dark for a majority of its run time but then constrained too not fully unleashing in the way that it could have done - they should have been a bit more braver and gone darker. But at the the end of the day Disney is writing the cheques, so there will always be limitations. All in all though its enjoyable and its STAR WARS so enjoy it and watch it on the big screen. Good to see some familiar faces on the big screen :).",7,2,5,1 January 2017
Knives Out," Awesome who done it
",Haven't seen anything quite like this for some time. This genre of movie I thought had been done to death. The trailer in my opinion was not that appealing to me personally but I went following some strong recommendations from friends and family. What can I say ? The film simply blew me away. The best film in its genre hands down. Brilliantly directed and acted by a ensemble cast who gelled perfectly. I didn't see any of it coming which in today's reveal all world was very nice. Liked all the cast. Big fan of Christopher Plummer and Daniel Craig however the entire cast in my opinion were all on par with each other. Rian Johnson does an amazing job with this one. Go see it and enjoy it. Money and time well spent.,9,0,6,31 December 2019
Star Wars: Episode IX - The Rise of Skywalker," Unhealthy fanbase.. filmmakers can't please anyone!
","You know I've learnt to enjoy movies for what they are. I don't delve too deeply into logic with certain movies. Star Wars is one of those movies series that's equivalent to a box of chocolate. You'll love some hate others. What star wars does very well is offer an awesome amount of escapasim - I'm happy we have 9 plus movies to enjoy. Star Wars is a Space opera. Soap Operas frequently change story direction and move the story on as they please. And these changes often don't make sense but are always enjoyable! These movies are episodically big screen versions of what I might of enjoyed as a child on Saturday tv. So in traditional Star wars fashion this movie set the scene with the scroll and off it went. Did I enjoy it? Yes very much so ! Was the acting good? Very much so? Was it well made? Yes excellent effects, soundtrack pure genius. Oh and did I enjoy it? Yess very much!!üòÅ. A great Star Wars. Problem is that there are far too many people out that take this canon of films a little too seriously. I didn't have any issues with the story threads, in fact they all made sense to me. A lots been made of discarding the last Jedi storyline. I'm not a hardcore fan so may be lost on me but I thought it followed on nicely. As a later trilogy I think it stands up nicely. Go see it, forget real life for a couple of hours and enjoy!!",9,5,14,31 December 2019
Bohemian Rhapsody," Surprisingly good
","When I first saw the trailer for this I couldn't figure out whether this was a spoof comedy. Rami Malik looked like he was taking the Michael with those teeth! So I stayed well clear of it. I'd also heard something about Byan Singer being sacked last year meaning they had to get someone in to the rescue the movie. However everyone I met and trusted said nothing but positive things. Having now seen the movie I have to say that I really enjoyed it. The acting by Rami was fantastic and I knew little about this chap. I thought he was a Brit. This is a star turn by a Californian actor... well done. Although I love the music I can't say that I knew too much about Queen so I enjoyed watching their journey to stardom unfold. It's one one the best movies I've seen this year a true crowd pleaser. You will laugh, cheer and cry. Go see it and see if you recognise Mike Myers!",8,3,3,31 December 2018
Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse," Great fun ... 3D version
",Really enjoyed this one and highly recommend that you go see it. Good plot and some nice touches in the script with things I didn't see coming! Great animation- I watched it in 3D and personally I thought it added to the experience. It was more fun than the recent live action efforts and nice to see spidey doing his own thing again without Stark's Avengers. Hope they make more of these!,9,5,39,9 December 2018
The Favourite," Good period comedy drama
","Very funny period film chronicling the relationship between Queen Anne, Lady Sarah and Abigail. Great cast and excellent acting by all especially the lead trio Coleman, Weiz and Stone. Very much like a play with a majority of the movie talking place within approximately 4-6 sets and a few outdoor locations. With each section introduced like the chapter of a book. That's not a negative though as it's an intimate movie focusing on power, gain, jealousy and loss. Eerie but fitting soundtrack also. This film would have benefited from a better ending though it's abrupt and while it's arty it's trying to hard. A traditional end would have been better. The positives outweigh the negatives with this one. Go see it.",6,1,2,5 January 2019
Everest," One of the best mountaineering movies
","This was a great movie. Fantastic cinematography, solidly directed and great performances. Empathy for characters who spend a small fortune to go up a mountain with the understanding that they could be killed and for that eventuality to be realized is difficult to achieve. Even the script is self aware of that and in one scene the characters ask what the appeal is. But do we need this justification?, the extremity of mountaineering, its toll to the human body and ultimately the human spirit is drama enough. To that end Everest beautifully charts the beauty and horror of mountaineering as well as its impact to powerless onlookers. This would have been easier to make as a documentary but bravo to the filmmakers for scripting and acting this piece out. A great technical achievement. The performances are great too, Jason Clarke is knock out. Josh Brolin was great too putting in a very honed in nuanced performance. However the usually brilliant Jake Gyllenhaal plays it too cartoonish and his performance was just that believable. But thats a very minor negative, I strongly recommend you view this movie on the largest screen you can fine.",6,1,2,20 December 2015
The Shape of Water," Best movie Oscar goes to this ????
","Now Im not jumping on the hate bandwagon, I saw this a couple of months ago at a preview, ahead of Oscar hype. I went in expecting to be blown away. I like del Toro movies, by enlarge they tend to be very engaging. Pans Labyrinth being one of my fav movies. However I couldn't connect with this one. Well acted for sure but nothing Ive not seen before, for example the mute character was just a rip off of Am√É¬©lie and the rest was beauty and the beast. It was crude - daily masturbation is not something I want to see. I get it but you don't have to drill it home del Toro - its not clever mate and after a while I just found the main character annoying. Any way it gets worse and I draw the line at the love scene...really ...too much del Toro- please give it a rest. Not a great watch just plain weird and I left feeling ripped off and seriously underwhelmed. Watch it if you like and make up your own mind but I recommend you watch a proper film like Dunkirk and enjoy the scale of that movie. How does Dunkirk not win the best picture or best director? Oscar's winner really have been weird as of late. But who knows what happens behind the scenes?As we know from recent events anything goes in Hollywood so I do wonder what perks did the studio provide to the voters of this one. In my humble opinion, this film is really not Oscar worthy.. it truly is pants.",1,8,26,5 March 2018
Creed II," Was good but not great
","A lot of people loved this. I thought it was good but that's it. Creed was awesome, felt raw and gritty. This is weaker as it's based heavily on a cartoonish entry to the Rocky Sage .... Rocky IV. That was a great movie when I was 11 and I still enjoy it today but that's nostalgia. Having said that it's well made Michael B Jordan plays it well as does Sylvester Stallone. What about th Drago's? Well their story was good but again didn't resonate with me, felt like it belonged in another movie. Were things really that bad for them? How did Drago junior manage to get into suvh stunning form.... far fetected but then so is the movies in what it's based. It's fun and it's good but it could have been much better. Rocky II+Creed+Rocky IV=Creed II",6,3,3,31 December 2018
Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice," Much better than expected based on critic reviews
","Now I do sometimes wonder whether critics see the same film and what their mindset is like before they view the film. I saw this movie without seeing a single trailer, I despise those things as they just set up a completely different expectation, its happened on far too many movies for me now, where the trailer just has me thinking about what the film will be about. I subsequently get excited about these themes but ultimately they never transpire in the finished product. So generally speaking if you can avoid the Hollywood propaganda and view the film without any prior expectations then go for it, its much more rewarding. Now first off the performances, loved Mr. Irons in this pure class and lends gravitas. The rest of the cast were very good too with the exception of Jesse E, for me his interpretation of Luthor was wrong, reminded me of Jim Carrey in batman forever. Miscast in my humble opinion. The plot - a lot going on here but they could have paced it differently in the editing room and they could have cut out the retelling of the Wayne massacre. Having said that though I enjoyed it, great action the big show down was executed very well, the second showdown was good too but as a consequence of a combination of Jesse's performance/script and pace, Doomsday's inclusion seemed rushed. Not saying that they should have left it out but just needed a different way of handling it. Anyway enjoy it for what it is, a good fun well made film that entertains for 2.5 hours 7/10.",5,3,11,30 May 2016
Star Wars: Episode VII - The Force Awakens," Nostalgia personified
","Mixed feelings on this one. Again the hype machine set my expectations way too high. The trailers were brilliant. When I see trailers that good, my mind starts to imagine what to expect from the plot, I just cant help it. When the picture in my head matches what I see on the screen, I view that as predictable and relatively enjoyable (if made well), when on the other hand a movie exceeds my imagination, I hail that movie as something amazing. This ones a mixed bag, but fundamentally the story elements and characters are not very well written, rushed in some areas and overwritten in others, the balance is wrong if you pardon the pun. I just didn't care for the wonderfully directed action scenes and didn't emotionally connect with the main protagonists. The Star Wars universe is wonderfully created here and seeing Han,Leia etc on the big screen is a great tick in the box but therein lies the problem, it serves to be a tick in the box; the whole thing just feels a bit forced. George Lucus got a bashing for the prequels, but thats because he's not a great Director of actors, but he a great story writer - the prequels though badly executed, were actually good stories. Fortunately the force awakens doesn't suffer some of the cringe worthy moments present in the prequels but the story is one that you've seen before. Being cynical then this is just another franchise and as such is just a precursor or advertisement if you like for all the memorabilia that will be available for the kids to enjoy. Go see it but be sure to dumb down your expectations.",6,13,28,17 December 2015
Spectre," Goldmember
","Have to say that I really enjoyed this, but they've gone backwards. I know a lot of people have commented on its runtime, but I didn't have issue with it. Spectre could have been right up there with Casino Royale but the austin powers reveal in the third act was unnecessary, not sure why the writers felt the need to do that? Casino Royale, QOS and Skyfall all played up the Illuminati theme. Wish they'd explored that theme in a less cartoonish way, in fact the organisation 'spectre' wasn't required as they'd already introduced Quantum, so why not keep that? All marketing, spectre harks back to the good old days(..and hence the nostalgia vote) and Quantum brings up memories of a crap experience. The link back to JB and Blofelt, well that was just plain silly. Didn't enjoy the song either, in fact I really disliked it, should have been much better, no excuses. The music score also appeared to be a rehash of skyfall, not impressed with that. In summary they've played it safe though and gone back to an old Bond formula which ultimately has no where to go from here, again nostalgia seems to be gripping Hollywood at the moment. Daniel Craig is brilliant but there's no where to go with this incarnation of Bond, may be its time to call it day and do something different? Would be sad to see him hang up the tux but the writers owe him a brilliant story to exit on.",6,0,3,17 December 2015
