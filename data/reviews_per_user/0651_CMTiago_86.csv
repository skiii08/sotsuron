Despicable Me 2," Quite possibly one of the funniest movies of all time
","If there are two things I love in an animation film those things are a good story and plenty of laughs. Although in this movie one eclipses the other by a large margin, Despicable Me 2 is as good a story as any. Now a family man, Gru has given up his evil ways and is stuck in sort of a rut. When he is recruited by the Anti Villain League he grabs the chance to once again experience a thrilling life, but at what cost is the question. Steve Carell reprises his role and shines yet again. All of the mannerisms in Gru's character are very well played and you laugh and cry along with him throughout the movie. Newcomer Kristen Wiig is a very welcome addition to the saga. Her quirky agent Lucy is a delightful character and provides a few giggles herself. However all of these great roles are overshadowed by those crazy yellow creatures known as the minions. In every scene they make an appearance they steal the show and leave you wanting more. Cuteness is also a factor played out very well by the Gru's girls with Agnes leaving a white smile in your face every time she speaks. Probably not a masterpiece of a movie, Despicable Me 2 is a hell of an entertaining piece of blockbuster cinema and feels fresh every time you watch it. Personally I find it to be one of the funniest movies of all time and overall a fantastic way to spend 1 1/2 hours without any worries at all.Rating 9/10",8,1,1,12 February 2014
The Avengers," Ultimate superhero movie
","There have been many superhero movies that I have massively enjoyed like Spider-Man and the much praised X-Men 2. While I do get that some people consider X-Men 2, or even Spider-Man 2 as the best examples of a superhero movie done right, one cannot ignore the sheer magnitude of The Avengers project. With the set-up beginning in 2008 with Iron Man and ending with Captain America: The First Avenger (2011), fans had been waiting anxiously for the result and I for one loved it. The plot revolves around the threat that Loki poses as he hopes to conquer earth with a feared army of advanced alien beings that will be transported to our planet through the energy source known as the Tesseract. In this dire situation, Nick Fury will look to assemble a group of remarkable people that will be known as The Avengers.The pacing of the film is wonderfully done as it takes about 30 minutes to introduce the characters in the movie. From then on, the perils outside but also within the group's personality will create the conflict the film needs. The choice of going with Joss Whedon as the director and co-writer was definitely a wise one, as he supplies us with his sharp vision of the story and characters, but also his dynamic and funny dialog. Everyone of the performances were great with everyone having their time in the spotlight, at least in my view. The effects are of course very well put within the film and only add to its spectacle.As far as I'm concerned, it may take a long time for me to get sick of this movie, and even then that's a remote possibility. With it's spot safely secured within my Top 20, its unlikely I'll ever watch a film like The Avengers. I just hope the sequel can deliver as much as this, and perhaps something even more unexpected.Rating 9,5/10",10,1,4,5 July 2014
The Monuments Men," Paused and calculated, The Monuments Men lacks a little soul
","For the most part, this film is clear on what it wants to present and with the talent involved, you would think the result would be splendid. While the movie isn't terrible, it has few redeeming qualities which is a shame, since I had high hopes for it. The plot sees a group of men, spearheaded by Clooney's character, who are looking to preserve the works of art that are being threatened by Hitler's path of destruction. In a movie like this I would think there would be a linear story and strong personalities in the characters. Instead we get boring mumbling about some other stuff, with the objective of the mission being neglected at times. Being a history buff I hate to side with those who claim it to be a waste of time, but with this case I have to agree. While I did enjoy some of the guys having fun doing this movie (e.g. Bill Murray), this isn't enough to make the movie great. I believe Clooney can do more in the directing and writing department, and I hope his next project is more thought out. In the meantime, I must say that The Monuments Men failed to impress me.Rating: 6/10",6,0,0,6 June 2014
Captain Phillips," Greengrass's direction guides movie to a built-up tension.
","Paul Greengrass has directed two of Hollywood's best action movies when he sat in the director's chair for The Bourne Supremacy and Ultimatum. This time around though he tackled a real life situation and the result was something quite phenomenal. I would say most of the movie is good, but due to the incredible shots by Greengrass's camera the film only gains quality. Tom Hanks plays Captain Phillips, a man who in 2009 was captured by this Somali pirates and faced a life threatening equation. The experienced Hanks handles the character well and gives a very human side to him. This isn't a particularly hard role, but let's just say that besides Tom Hanks, there are only a handful of actors who could have pulled off what he pulled here. The revelation is obviously Barkhad Abdi, who puts some so called 'Hollywood' actors to shame. He shows a lot of maturity in a demanding role for someone with his inexperience. My favorite part of the film was without a doubt the directing approach by Paul Greengrass. It is the kind of work that I believe should have been nominated at the Oscars and it is truly a shame. Captain Phillips is a very entertaining thriller and overall it delivers. Dramawise however the movie lacks a bit since I don't believe it to be the best worked angle. It is dramatic but not to a great extent.Rating 7,5/10",7,0,1,19 February 2014
The Expendables 2," Nothing better than watching legendary action stars kicking ass
","Looks like I finally broke my 'Expendables' cherry by viewing this much expected sequel. In this movie we add iconic heroes such as Chuck Norris, Arnold Schwarzenegger, Jean-Claude Van Damme as well as new blood in Liam Hemsworth. Personally I think these types of movies are a great way to just have irrational fun watching popcorn flicks. Everything ranging from the blow em up style of Stallone and Lundgren, to the specialized tactics of Statham as well as the experience of Norris and Schwarzenegger, and you get all you need in a movie full of action. My only complain was the lack of Jet Li, who just seemed to pop up at the start of the film to earn his paycheck, which is a shame because I would have loved to see Van Damme vs Li, even though it's Stallone who is the main hero. So if you're looking to see some old fashioned ass-kicking from your favorite action legends, then this is it. Now let's eat some popcorn and watch stuff blow up.Rating 7/10",7,0,0,4 July 2014
Iron Man 3," Iron Man 3: The Human Side Of Tony Stark
","After being totally thrilled by The Avengers, I didn't expect exactly the same amount of greatness in 'Iron Man 3', yet I still needed a solid story to keep me interested. There were two things that I was certain were going to satisfy me: Robert Downey Jr. 's performance and the special effects. Granted they did not disappoint, however aside from that, I either accepted all other aspects or felt they were done in a messy fashion.The plot consists of a terrorist called the Mandarin threatening America's safety and teaching its president and people a lesson. After his friend Happy Hogan is put into a coma thanks to one of the Mandarin's attacks, Tony vows to strike back. But after an attack from his enemy leaves him homeless and weaponless, Tony must find a way to stop his foe's plans while reevaluating his troubled existence. Downey Jr. hits the ball park once again with his Stark character showing his usual playful charm, but also his vulnerability at times. The events that took place in The Avengers take a heavy toll on the character and RDJ plays it quite professionally. Other characters were sort of a bore to me with Pearce's Killian as an exception. The plot once again fails to make sense, making it more comparable with the second rather than the first. Overall the film entertains and the visuals combined with the leading man's appeal make for an enjoyable time, however when it comes to the story it doesn't come close to Marvel movies like the first Iron Man and The Avengers.Rating 8/10",7,19,32,17 January 2014
Gravity," A story of survival
","By definition, Gravity is a technical wonder. All of the details were meticulously orchestrated by Alfonso Cuaron in a very masterful way. Given the incredible work that was put into this part of the film, it's quite understandable that the story is a bit overshadowed, at least in my estimation. It's not a bad story by any means and the fight for survival is always an interesting enough subject to portray in cinema, especially when you take into account the complications that our leading star goes through. Still it fails to impress when compared to some more complex stories at this year's Oscars. As far as other aspects go I must say that Sandra Bullock handles her role very well as she brings a lot of intensity throughout the entire 90 minutes of the movie. Much like Chiwetel Ejiofor in 12 Years A Slave, although in different circumstances, Bullock is the central focus of the movie and therefore must be very convincing. There are mostly two aspects that I'd like to highlight in the movie. The first is the amazing job Alfonso Cuaron did directing the film. You could really tell this was a passion project and the end result was something quite outstanding. On the other hand though, one can't be a little turned off by the simplistic story of survival in outer space, one that while well constructed, ultimately fails to capture the dark yet beautiful magic of the world that is Gravity.Rating 8/10",8,3,5,23 February 2014
Lone Survivor," Gritty war movie with a heavy sense of realism
","Lone Survivor is the depiction of a navy mission that fails and leaves the men entrusted to carry it out in an out gunned fight with a huge taliban force. Based on real events, the movie is presented with a fantastic sense of realism. This is a war movie at its best and the scenes leave nothing to imagination. Whether it's the terrible effects of the explosions or the cringe worthy wounds these men suffer, you will find yourself very attached to what's going on. All the performances are equally and resoundingly superb. Throughout the whole ordeal the bond these soldiers share will be tested and in the end it will triumph despite the obvious consequences.This is usually a genre that doesn't do it for me. I like most of the films and some are exquisitely better than others (E.G: Saving Private Ryan). What makes this one a little more interesting than others is the incredible courage of these man and the sacrifices some of them made. Lone Survivor is about as real as a war movie will get nowadays. I certainly understand the praise and is deserved. On a personal note it is merely yet another movie I enjoyed due to great entertainment values.Rating 7/10",7,0,3,12 February 2014
Star Trek Into Darkness," Stakes are high as Kirk fights for his family
","Not being a huge Trekkie, I wasn't particularly interested in watching this sequel to the rebooted franchise. But given its obvious box office success and consequent Oscar nomination, it climbed in my watch list and I experienced STID. I believe that the first Star Trek from Abrahams is a bit overrated, as I find it to be a welcomed adventure film but not worthy of the rating it scores. Having said that I would probably put this entry in a similar spot as its predecessor. It offers a wide variety of thrills and uncertainties, while presenting us with emotional sides to most of the main characters. As any Star Trek fan would agree, Kirk, Spock and Khan are the most highlighted characters in the film and they all are played with the right kind of charisma. Pine once again offers determination and leadership as James Kirk, a irreverent man who will do anything to keep his crew (family) safe. Quinto is spot on as Spock, a Vulcan that's calculating but also influenced by his human half to not only serve Kirk in the right manner, but also to connect affectionately with Uhura. Finally the MVP of the movie is clearly Benedict Cumberbatch, who is superb as Khan, a ruthless villain that shows a huge psychological advantage throughout the film, until he meets his ultimate demise.Star Trek Into Darkness is a fun and great movie experience. Some fans may complain about its lack of greatness and its detachment from Trek themes, but since I am not a die hard fan, I don't feel there's anything to bicker about.Rating 7/10",7,3,5,19 January 2014
Finding Nemo," A cherished childhood favorite
","Having watched this movie back when I was in my 8/9 years of age, Finding Nemo struck me as a very funny movie and I, of course, loved Dory and her quirkiness. Over time I began to appreciate the emotional impact of the story and the detail that went into the animation process, which in turn led to the establishment of this movie as my favorite of all time. Having only been surpassed three years ago by Toy Story 3 (another Pixar gem), Finding Nemo still holds a strong impression on me, as well as remaining one of my top 10 movies and my second favorite animated movie.The plot follows a clown fish named Marlin, that after his son is taken by a human, sets out on a dangerous and treacherous journey to get him back. Along the way he will meet Dory, a blue fish that suffers from short term memory loss. Together they will stop at nothing to get to Nemo, Marlin's son, who along with a group of ragtag aquarium fish will also plan to escape to the ocean in order to avoid a bratty, but, deadly child and get back to his dad.So like I said, there 3 reasons why I love this movie. The first one is the comedy, provided mostly by the goofy sidekick Dory, as well as other characters. The combination of the smart script, plus the voice talent involved makes for the great comedic side of Finding Nemo. The other great quality of the script, is the emotional turmoil that ensues in the movie, and personally I believe that some parents might resonate with it most, even though I myself do not know this reality. Finally Pixar proves why they are the top of the animation game, by assembling the proper research and creating a great oceanic world, as well as the Sydney landscape.Finding Nemo will forever be a cinematic mark in my cinematic history. It is a funny, energetic and entertaining picture, and that is all I can ask from a movie like this. Rating: 10/10",10,1,2,4 October 2014
Dead Poets Society," Thank You Captain
","It was with a sad reason that I re watched Dead Poets Society, as we lose yet another talent and an all round good person in Robin Williams. This being my favorite Williams film, I took it upon myself to honor his memory by remembering his best body of work, in my opinion. Mr. Keating is the teacher that I wish I had, and granted this might be a mixed opinion within the film's context, but the matter of the fact is that he was no ordinary teacher, and that's something you don't see very often.The thing about this film is that it doesn't shorten its importance to Williams's performance. The supporting cast is one that balances the film like no other. Every one of those students that revived the DPS is, in one way or another, influenced by Mr. Keating, be that positively or, unfortunately, negatively. The story being an Oscar winning screenplay, is one that I think mostly resonates with younger people, and with this movie being part of my 10th grade Portuguese course, I, personally, embraced its essence and of course its driving message of seizing the day.As I've seen here on IMDb, this movie might not gather nearly uncontested praise, but it is very much highly regarded today as it was 25 years ago. The final scene still gives me chills to this day, and in the midst of our sad goodbye to Mr. Williams I just wanna say Thank You My Captain. It was a pleasure learning to become my own motivated person. May we all Carpe DiemRating: 9/10",9,45,48,12 August 2014
The Prestige," Nolan's Masterpiece
","Up until very recently I had Inception as my favorite Christopher Nolan movie and quite frankly I thought that the remaining movies I had to watch weren't up to the task of dethroning it. With Following and Insomnia still in my list to watch, The Prestige is now the movie to beat. With a simple story about a rivalry between two magicians lies a complex script full of symbolism and that itself is presented as an illusion. Combined with Nolan's mastery in technical aspects and you've got yourself an enthralling movie that will leave you asking questions long after its finished (much like Inception did for me).Like I said this whole movie feels like an illusion and it's like the audience is being played. The question is will you want to be fooled? Or will you want to find out the secret. I won't go into plot details as I feel you should watch this with as little info about it as possible. About what I found was great in the movie, of course the technique put in by the crew complimented the movie very well. In a movie like this, though, the performances are the key to connecting with the audience and both Jackman and Bale show why they are the top talent today. Scarlett Johansson,Rebecca Hall, Michael Caine and even David Bowie contribute well to the movie and only add to its greatness. Some people might condemn it for being over explanatory, but personally I don't believe this to be a problem as I still questioned a lot of things after the movie was over. See it for yourself and find out if you were fooled. For me it was definitely worth it.Rating 9,5/10",10,0,1,16 May 2014
Fast & Furious 6," The Fast and Furious franchise gets even bigger
","Just when you think this series can't get any better, they blow your expectations away and deliver another entertaining ride. After getting back on track with the 4th, and stepping their game even further with the 5th, Furious 6 will reach new heights which may be impossible to reach. Following the events of the last movie, Dom and his crew have settled down and are living the life thanks to their successful heist in Brazil. But when Special Agent Hobbs approaches Dom with photos of Letty, Dom's former girlfriend thought dead, the crew get back together to earn their pardons and return home to the US. They will have to face off against Owen Shaw, a ruthless criminal who now has an Letty at his disposal, since she doesn't remember Dom. From the moment the plot is set, the action kicks in and it almost doesn't stop. In between the action less parts, some humor will kick in as well as the genuine drama felt by the characters. As I grow older, I begin to appreciate some finer works of cinema, yet my youthful spirit still has me searching for the right kind of blockbuster, and once again I hit gold with this one. So as far as the aspects of the filmmaking process, aside from the action sequences there isn't anything totally worthy of an applause. But with crazy stunts, characters with the cool factor and insanely fast cars, what more can I ask for. As a fan I can't wait for 2015 to come so I can watch the next film, and in this case, give a memorable farewell to Paul Walker, an eternal member of the FnF family.Rating: 9,5/10",8,4,6,31 May 2014
The Book Thief," Powerful yet simple story that shows us innocence
","Having not read the book, I wasn't going in to this movie knowing fully what I was expecting, but had a certain amount of reasonable expectation: I was either going to be bored or I would sort of like it. The end result was something quite different. Everything in this movie just connected perfectly and once I got attached to this world I couldn't let go. Starting with the characters, every single one of them did what they were supposed to do. Liesel was a beautiful and curious girl, Hans was a caring and loving father, Rosa while also caring, was a bit more strict, as to create a balance within the family. All other characters were just as important as they had connections with the girl and eventually had a mutual effect on each others lives. Then there were two characters that were mostly linked to Liesel than any other character besides her father. Rudy and Max were two friends that while with different backgrounds, provided Liesel with some much needed life lessons. While Rudy was a simple incarnation of her childhood and her best friend outside of her home. Max helped her understand the world and its injustices.Set in World War II Germany, the mood manages to be quite cheerful at times, but as reality kicks in, we are reminded that the situation is much more serious and the danger is always present. The direction of the movie allows us to know this and fear for the characters safety. One of the better elements, and the reason John Williams scores his 49th nomination for an Oscar, is the beautiful and light soundtrack that accompanies this young child's journey and ultimately falls into the collection of great scores by Williams. In conclusion, this is a smaller and more calm movie when compared to the big budget blockbuster being churned out today (nothing against it), yet it captures the imagination of being young and innocent through some brilliant performances and an enjoyable story.Rating 8/10",8,4,8,26 January 2014
Captain America: The Winter Soldier," Stealth action in Cap. movie makes for a terrific approach
","The Winter Soldier is the best sequel possible to the Captain America story arc. With fast and furious combat scenes, as well as some spy intricacies, Marvel has made a movie that has become a stand out, in the sense that it offers a slightly different product.After being frozen for 70 years, Steve Rogers must now find a way to live in the modern world by coping with the changes occurred and his perception of things like they are. He is being used as an asset for SHIELD in missions but doesn't seem to fully agree with some of Nick Fury's more obscure intentions. When SHIELD becomes compromised by the resurgence of HYDRA, Cap, Black Widow & Falcon are framed for Director Fury's death and in the process are declared fugitives. Now they must find a way to overtake HYDRA, which means a confrontation with The Winter Soldier, who is incarnated by Bucky Barnes, Rogers's old friend, and may even mean the destruction of SHIELD itself.Captain America may in fact present itself as an Superhero Action flick, with great emphasis on Action. The fight sequences in the film are quite possibly the best Marvel Studios has created. Knifes, guns, punches, kicks, etc. The fights are entertaining as is the overall presentation of the confrontations. The political and surveillance themes in the story are a good backdrop in the movie as they show us what a character like Captain America has to deal with. I usually tend to give the acting a pass in comic book movies, as long as it's not totally incompetent. In this movie I would say the veteran Redford was very natural and charismatic in his role and the one who stood out.The Winter Soldier is definitely a Marvel movie worth seeing as it brings great excitement and a solid plot to the table. As a fan of these movies, I can't wait to see more from Marvel and I sincerely hope they keep up the good work.Rating: 8/10",9,0,2,31 August 2014
Interstellar," A visual treat for Sci-Fi fans
","As I begin this review of Christopher Nolan's latest movie, I want to point out the gorgeous visuals that we as an audience were able to behold with Interstellar. I truly believe this to be the movie's best quality and a true feat for the people in charge of visual effects. Having said this, I believe that many viewers were divisive over the plot's complexities. In fact, this is the most emotion driven movie I've seen from Nolan, something that he isn't ultimately known for. Nolan's strenght as a director lies in his ability to present us with a vision. He is meticulous and works the technical aspect of a film like no other director today. Once again, this is proved in every frame shot for Interstellar. So leaving behind my long praise, I now redirect this review to the story.The earth is dying, as the effects of our abuse of the natural resources is taking out the crops of food we need to survive. Upon this dark scenario, former NASA engineer Cooper (McConaughey) is asked to pilot a spaceship with the purpose of crossing a wormhole that will lead to another galaxy. This, of course, in hopes of reaching three possible habitable planets explored by scientists sent there in previous missions. Given the unpredictable nature of an unknown environment such as a different galaxy, Cooper will have to decide whether he is willing to sacrifice everything for the sake of humanity or if the urge to reunite with his daughter again is stronger. Personally I liked the story Nolan told us with this film, as it left you thinking about it after the movie was over, something Nolan does very well with his projects. Compared with his previous work, there are still movies that I love more than this. Still Interstellar is a brilliant film in it's own right and yet another great addition to this great director's Filmograhpy.In the end all I can say is, if you're a Sci-Fi fan, you surely must not miss this one. It will offer an unique visual experience and leave you wondering what the hell you just watched, even if you didn't feel completely satisfied.Rating: 8/10",8,6,11,16 April 2015
American Sniper," Enjoy your movie, America
","Before I start the review, I just need to say that for a non- American such as myself it's a bit tough to connect with someone like Chris Kyle. While I do understand that not every person in the US is praising this film as well, I feel I may just need to explain my stance when it comes to this movie and it's review.So in short, the film tells the story of Chris Kyle, a Navy SEAL that is sent to Iraq in the course of four tours and there is becomes a legend by having over 150 confirmed kills on duty. However glorious his presence is looked at in combat, he fails to leave this environment mentally, therefore separating him from his family emotionally. This right here was a great plot point that could have actually been expanded during the film. Instead we see this troubled man doing what apparently he seems to like most, and that is fighting for his country. The need to showcase the war scenes is totally fine by me, as it is a great display of Kyle's patriotism and his obsession with the cause. Still a little more balance between his life as a soldier and his life as a family man would have made the experience much more approachable to me.American Sniper ends up being a disappointment, as it features a talented actor in Bradley Cooper and is directed by a Hollywood legend in Clint Eastwood. His agenda in this movie is clear, which is what pisses me off about this movie. I have loved some Eastwood's previous work and Cooper wowed me in Silver Linings Playbook. In here I'm left with a movie that downright justifies the Iraq invasion and presents a man that, no matter how Bradley Cooper or any other actor portrayed him, I couldn't give a damn about. If anything I feel sorry for his wife and kids that had to endure long periods without him and ultimately lost him when he was in a good place.Rating: 5/10",5,7,30,18 February 2015
Forrest Gump," It's a classic for a reason
","Forrest Gump seems to be a movie that is either dearly loved or passionately torn down. It almost always generates discussion and is a cultural landmark in American cinema. I haven't yet gone in to a discussion like this, but should the moment arise, I will definitely defend it, as it is one of my all time favorites. The thing that always gets me is the innocence in which Forrest sees the world. He doesn't really know what he is doing or saying, yet to us he makes a huge difference in the world. On the other side of the coin, Jenny makes her own choices. Choices that lead to a complicated life and an ultimately predictable demise. Unlike other characters that seem to have a positive impact on Forrest's life, Jenny always seems to be the light in his life, despite being a completely dislikeable person at one point of the movie. Once again the naive Gump doesn't judge Jenny's bad decisions, as he still sees that lovely, but damaged young girl he met when he was a child.As far as the movie making goes, FG presents us with a career defining performance from Tom Hanks, as he handles the emotional conflicts very well in the movie. In a midst of strong supporting performances, for me Gary Sinise steals the show as Lieutanent Dan Taylor, a man whose changes in life end up being an inspiration. Zemeckis's directing is precise, and Roth's script is very involving: In the end though, I think Alan Silvestri's delicate score is what accounts for at least 50% of the movie's dramatic effect.1994 will always be a year I will fondly remember as a great cinematic year. It features 3 Jim Carrey comedies that cemented his place in movie history, one of the greatest animated movies of all time, and 3 best picture nominees that would become worshiped movies. Whether it's with Pulp Fiction's violent world, or Shawshank Redemption's gritty prison vision, or even the endearing drama story that is Forrest Gump, this is top notch cinema.Rating: 10/10",10,4,6,6 September 2014
"Monsters, Inc."," Funny and inventive, it delivers the Pixar mark
","I've been wanting to review this movie for some time now, and that is because Monsters Inc. is already a beloved classic from the company that makes us dream like no other. With this movie it's no different. We are introduced to a world that is inhabited by monsters who are just trying to live their normal lives in a happy society. Our main characters are Mike and Sully, two creatures that work at Monsters Inc. , whose goal is to power the city with children's screams. When a little girl crosses the threshold of both worlds, trouble will arise as friendships and the overall faith of Monstropolis (the city's name) will be on the line. Providing a perfect mixture of comedy and warmth, this movie delivers an entertaining ride that will leave you laughing out loud, as well as invested in the emotional trials the characters goes through. The film's lasting message is also one of the best in showing us that through a happy spirit we can overcome anything. Pixar at their best, Monsters Inc. is a must see movie for any animation and ,most of all, Pixar enthusiast.Rating: 9/10",8,0,1,17 June 2015
American Hustle," Not as great as it could have been
","American Hustle is the latest project from Hollywood's recent rising director, David O. Russel. I wanna start by saying that I loved both The Fighter and Silver Linings Playbook. This was supposed to be Russel's step to something even greater, with perhaps a best director and best picture win at the Oscars. I'm sadden to say that this isn't that movie. Although it has grown into a major contender, it will probably walk away with few awards or even empty ended. As far as the movie goes, one of the things I enjoyed the most was Christian Bale's performance of this con man. Bale gives a stylistic feel to his character and is by far the richer in the film. Amy Adams also gives a good performance as well, and Bradley Cooper and Jeremy Renner are solid. I am a huge fan of Lawrence, and while she showed yet again her maturity in the role, she could have brought more to the table. Despite its cool imagery and decent performances, American Hustle fails on one important issue and that is its plot. The premise is good, but the plot is basically unattached to the con world and all its tactics. It misses the key element to fully entertain given its genre and I for one am a a little disappointed in this.Rating 7/10",7,1,5,23 February 2014
American Pie," The first slice
","Ah the first time. In 1999, American Pie joined an elite club of teen comedies that would forever be remembered as classics in the genre. Not since Porky's, had a movie been as more outrageous as American Pie, and the fact is that the late 90's generation had a movie to sort of label them, but not in a negative way.The story follows a group of four teenage boys (Jim, Kevin, Oz and Finch), who pledge to lose their virginity, but things aren't as easy as they might seem. Jim is a bumbling buffoon who gets embarrassed talking to girls and listening to his father's awkward sexual advice. Kevin is dating Vicki, but has trouble balancing his feelings for her and his desire to have sex with her. Oz, after a college girl rejects him and gives him pointers, is looking to bring his sensitive side and ends up falling for Heather. And Finch finds a way to spread rumors about himself in school, but things don't turn out the way he planned.In all of these individuals, the raunchy, hilarious and sometimes even sexy situations will make you fall on the floor with laughter. However what I also love about this movies is that the characters evolve and actually face teen, and later adult, complications. As for this movie, it is my second favorite of the 4 movies, as American Pie 2 is my favorite. Still this first slice of pie, will always have a special taste for me.

Man of Steel," Superman in big budget action
","When Superman was released back in the 1978 not only did it set the bar for all superhero movies to come, but started the genre as we know it. Since then there have been many movies that have stepped up as classics and with Man Of Steel, Warner Bros. were looking to create yet another masterpiece, especially given that DC's main competitor, Marvel have taken the lead cinematically speaking. While not on par with, let's say The Avengers, Man Of Steel is very much it's own movie and manages to set up a respectable story. I didn't think much on it upon my first viewing, but returning to it now, the movie made more sense and despite a necessary, but somewhat long set up to the movie's conflict, Man Of Steel delivers a comic book movie filled with great action.Henry Cavill is the perfect fit for this modern day Superman, as he embodies his difficult nature as a young man trying to figure out why he is different and shows tremendous character as the ultimate Superhero. Amy Adams makes for a more attractive Lois Lane, yet the character continues to be perceived as the damsel in distress. Michael Shannon gives an exciting performance as General Zod, the movie's villain hellbent on accomplishing his goals. And with the veteran talents of Russel Crowe, Kevin Costner and Diane Lane, the movie is well handled in the cast department. Much has been said about the destruction the movie showcases. Mostly I agree that it's a bit mindless and there could have been better ways to show combat between the characters. Still one can't deny that it's a pleasure to watch, at least for someone like me who likes intense action.Man Of Steel won't go down as a classic. In fact its middling review suggest that DC and Warner Bros, still have a long way to go before they get to Marvel levels. Still it's mildly entertaining and very much worth a view.Rating 8/10",8,3,5,16 June 2014
Grease," Always ready for Grease
","Grease is the kind of movie that always puts me in a good mood. With Travolta and Newton-John in their iconic roles as Danny & Sandy, you can't help but join in the fun and sing along happily. Personally I feel that this movie shouldn't be over analyzed, as I feel it creates a darker tone than what the movie tries to convey, after all it is a musical.The music is, in great part, the reason I love the movie. Combining the great performances and script with the perfectly synced dances and beautifully sung pieces only makes for a more enjoyable experience, especially with a musical nut such as myself. Among the memorable soundtrack my 4 favorite tracks are Summer Nights, Greased Lightning, You're The One That I Want and We Go Together. With Grease, I know that I will have the time of my life, and every year the movie never ceases to amaze me, as it grabs my full attention and appreciation. Overall a great musical classic in its own right.Rating: 9,5/10",9,0,1,25 July 2014
American Beauty," A beautiful film
","American Beauty is the epitome of perfect emotional cinema. It boasts great direction, screen writing and performances all round, making it, in my opinion, one of the greatest films ever made.The story follows Lester Burnham, a man who seems to have lost all hope in life, as he is stuck in a joyless marriage and has trouble connecting with his teenage daughter. This all changes when he meets Angela, his daughter's best friend. From then on, Lester decides to take back control of his life. The question is, how will it affect those around him?Kevin Spacey gives a career defining performance and once again nails it as Lester, a man so fed up with life that he needed a radical change. The evolution of the character is done to perfection and Spacey's Oscar winning work is the proof. All other actors do their parts in great fashion as well and make the movie even better. With inspired performances like these, the film only gets better with a magical combination of Alan Ball's script and Sam Mendes' debut as a cinematic director. Among other things I love about this film, I can't go on without mentioning the heart wrenching soundtrack that pulls out a wallop of emotions.American Beauty is a wonderful, yet ultimately tragic tale of how people can hide their true selves. However they choose to change, one thing is certain: it will affect everything in the status quo. Lester's story is the example of that and it is one that I will heartedly support every time I watch this movie.Rating: 10/10",10,2,3,11 October 2014
We're the Millers," Pleasant comedy movie
","We're The Millers is a great movie, if you're looking to spend about 2 hours just laughing out into thin air. It gives a good premise and delivers the jokes perfectly, from that premise. With the kind of characters presented in the movie, one could only get these funny situations. All the main roles, plus a solid supporting turn from Ed Helms contribute to the movie's appeal and only make it better.So in a nutshell, long-time pot dealer David Clark asks a group of misguided people to create a fake family with him, in order to smuggle a shipment of weed from Mexico to the U.S. He offers compensation for the job, given the danger involved. However when he finds out that his boss was actually stealing from a Mexican drug lord, David must find a way to survive, while also learning to cope with this strange group of people pretending to be a family. Between a stripper, a virgin and a runaway, we get a strong comic dynamic which I felt was well explored. Anniston shows once again why she is still a strong name in comedy and Poulter gives a standout role as the bumbling teenager that always seems too naive. Still my favorite of the bunch is Sudeikis, as he always plays these parts right on the money.We're The Millers is a crude and sometimes inappropriate comedy movie. In my estimation, it does a great job with the laughs, even if the story does get a bit sappy at the end (as most movies do anyway). I recommend you watch this movie whenever you feel like laughing your ass off, provided you're not offended by the content. It will most definitely please youRating: 7,5/10",7,0,1,29 August 2014
Ender's Game," Enjoyable sci-fi adventure movie
","Upon viewing this movie, I wasn't familiar with the novel from which it's based. Nonetheless, I very much liked the film and am kind of sad they are not making anymore movies off the series. So at the start, we are introduced to Ender, a young boy who seems to be just one step ahead of everybody around him. His quick wit and ability to assess the best solutions make him a perfect candidate to lead an attack on an enemy alien force, at least in the eyes of Colonel Graff, who trains him to be the best leader possible. But can Ender manage this difficult responsibility? Overall I was pleased with the story and the performances. Asa Butterfield is a great lead actor in this movie and brings a lot of energy to the film, along with the likes of Abigail Breslin and Hailee Steinfeld. The seasoned actors such as Harrison Ford, Viola Davis and Ben Kingsley balance the cast quite well and the result is very satisfactory. In the end, I guess if you're looking for a nice adventure filled, family film, Ender's Game might just do fine as the choice.Rating: 8/10",8,1,2,5 November 2014
Hansel & Gretel: Witch Hunters," Fairy tale children become foul-mouthed assassins
","With an R-Rating, this movie had been sold to me like an action movie that was gonna have scary moments and some violence. Imagine how surprised I was when I found out that the gore is shown to a great and over the top extent. Not that this was a problem for me, as I think it had a great deal of style to an already showy flick. The performances in the movie fit perfectly with the story and make it a fun ride for the audience. Renner is a badass Hansel who loves to kill witches and party like there's no tomorrow. Gemma Artenton is beautiful as a determined Gretel, who seeks to find the truth about her parents's history. As the villain, Famke Janssen seems to have a great time playing a menacing witch who provokes our heroes in order to succeed in her mission to become basically immortal. Besides the violence, I thought the make-up was terrific as the angry faces of our antagonistic witches not only gave me chills but are enough to make a child have nightmares for weeks. This is strictly an adult movie and any connection to the sweet fairy tale we know is immediately thrown out the window as soon as the heavy violence kicks in. With some entertaining moments, H&G: WH delivers as a good way to pass the time and see kick-ass action.Rating 5,5/10",5,1,3,27 January 2014
The Lego Movie," Everything is awesome in The Lego Movie
","To quote the movie, this tale of high impact adventure and stakes is quite simply, you guessed it, awesome. Everything ranging from the animation to the story and its laugh out loud jokes, this is a must see movie for all ages. The story follows a an ordinary construction worker named Emmet, who through a series of mishaps, ends up being mistaken for an unlikely hero. Sure the plot line is obviously close to the dozens of adventure, hero driven movies being made. What sets Lego apart is its execution that will make you burst out with laughter, while also adding a dynamic dramatic edge to it.Coming from the pair that brought us Cloudy WIth A Chance Of Meatballs in 2009, I knew that this project was in good hands from the start. Still what makes this one better, at least in my eyes, is the satirical look into the whole story and for that I thank Phil Lord and Christopher Miller. Plus, with the multiple pop culture references there will be plenty of familiar faces to recognize, not to mention Batman takes center stage as the character who will bring in more chuckles.At the end of the day, The Lego Movie may be seen as a commercial movie given its brand recognition, however, I strongly advise you to watch this movie as not only will you have the time of your life, you will make your own interpretation of the story's true meaningRating: 8,5/10",8,0,2,31 July 2014
Dallas Buyers Club," The strenght of the actors
","As has been said, Dallas Buyers Club is a movie that depends on the hard hitting performances of Matthew McConaughey and Jared Leto. I have to say I agree with this. The directing is actually one of the least redeeming parts of the film, the script grows but yet isn't anything extraordinary and this not being a technical movie there isn't much to applaud in that process of filmmaking.So this movie presents the real life story of Ron Woodruff, a southern 'cowboy' that upon learning that he has been diagnosed with HIV sets out to make a difference for those suffering from the same fate, and this after he first dismisses it. McConaughey is simply great in this challenging role. His physical transformation was a point that was very much praised, but his emotional take on the character was a big assist to the success of the performance. This is a guy who really changes for the better and the actor makes sure we realize this. In an equal level, Jared Leto gives one of the best performances not only of his career (perhaps is very best), but also one of the best of the year and one that will surely be remembered for the ages.DBC is a movie that relies on top quality acting and thank god they got the right actors for it. Surely the biggest contender in both actor categories at the Oscars.Rating 8/10",8,2,2,19 February 2014
Now You See Me," An entertaining film, despite some heavy criticism
","With a splendid cast of actors and with a story hanging on the unbelievable, Now You See Me is quite the entertaining film and one which truly pulled me into it. Needless to say I've already read some of the hate posts here on IMDb, and while on a reasonable note, these complaints don't actually resonate with me, as I found the movie to be great and exciting, despite its flaws. The basic premise is that a group of former solo magic performers, team up at the request of a mysterious figure, and end up robbing banks during their performances as The Four Horseman. This action quickly gathers the attention of the FBI who assign an agent who, along with an Interpol detective will try to decipher the ultimate trick. As was said, the plot execution is borderline insane and one can see the problem some of the viewers had with the film. Also the four main characters seem to act merely as plot devices and lack any real development. As far as my view is concerned on these points, my conclusion is that it doesn't really matter to me, since I watched this movie to have a little fun and to enjoy being tricked, as is the case here. As much as I enjoy a well crafted movie, Now You See Me is a perfect example of a movie that has worrying flaws, yet achieves what I wanted from it, and that is top notch entertainment. And I'm 100 fine with it.Rating 9/10",8,2,3,2 June 2014
X-Men: Days of Future Past," More epic and with higher stakes
","After watching X-Men: First Class a few years back and learning of this movie's production, I immediately got excited. FC was a slick and cool movie that showed us the mutants in a spy sort of setting. Overall I was very pleased and it became my favorite X-Men movie. With this one I expected to love it even more but for different reasons. Days Of Future Past always seemed like an epic action packed story that was going to up the ante among X-Men movies. Now after it completing it, I must say I was once again entertained by these characters and their struggles. Still, it didn't claim my number one spot among X-men moviesThe plot is centered on a time travel journey, as Wolverine's consciousness will return to 1973, courtesy of Kitty Pryde's powers. There, he must convince a young Charles Xavier to stop an assassination attempt by Mystique that will lead to a world of destruction for both humans and mutants. Hugh Jackman once again delivers as Logan/Wolverine as he offers the action and comedy part of the film perfectly. Featuring mutants such as Iceman, Storm and one particularly fun Quicksilver pop up, it's kind of hard to fully highlight every one of these special beings. The movie however works on the basis of the Mystique, Magneto & Professor X dynamic. Betryal, love and regret are among the emotions explored between these characters and every one of the cast members delivers.Bryan Singer is the director that was tasked with tying together this franchise within this movie. As far as I'm concerned, I believe he did the best considering the circumstances surrounding this picture. Singer gave us a fun and explosive film, while also presenting the themes so closely associated with the X-Men terrificly. And now let's see what Apocalypse brings us.Rating: 8,5/10",8,0,0,8 May 2015
Mamma Mia!," The joy of ABBA's music
","Whenever the time comes for me to re watch this wonderful movie, the feeling that most resonates with myself is joy and the great melodies from ABBA's music that made us basically just enjoy the songs with a smile in our faces. This movie takes their lyrics and turns it into a musical story about family, romance and the everlasting mark of youth power.So our plot begins with Sophie (Amanda Seyfried) sending 3 wedding invitations to three men, from which she thinks one might be her father. As soon as these men arrive on the island, trouble will ensue as Sophie's mother, Donna (Meryl Streep) tries to figure out why they are there and ultimately keep them away from Sophie. Sophie on the other hand tries to figure out which one of the three, Bill (Skarsgaard), Sam (Brosnan) and Harry (Firth), is her dad. Add in secondary characters like Donna's old friends and Sophie's fiancée, and you have the stage set for great comedic situations.Overall I consider this movie to be a success in terms of the performances, granted there were a few amateur mistakes, but given that some of these actors hadn't done a musical yet and the fact that they actually tried, one can look past them. However a key player in this movie is Amanda Seyfried, as she steals the show with heavenly voice. In the end, Mamma Mia! will always be a movie I enjoy based purely on its entertainment value, as it isn't exactly a storytelling masterpiece, but it delivers laughs and a splendid time.Rating: 9,5/10",9,1,2,21 July 2014
The Hobbit: The Desolation of Smaug," A far more impressive outing
","Having recently seen the first hobbit movie for the first time, I wasn't expecting to watch the second one until after the Oscar nominations, where I was hoping to watch it as a contender in the technical categories. By a stroke of luck, I attended a midnight showing with a few family members, and left the theater amazed by how this picture had captivated me.Following the quest started in 'An Unexpected Journey', this movie begins with an initial flashback as to how the whole plot to take back Erebor came to fruition through a meeting between Thorin and Gandalf. Having set the foundations for those that missed the first part, the story then moves us to where we left off from the previous film. From then on you will be taken on a ride full of thrills, as you witness the perils of The Company facing the constant threat of the vicious orcs. But all is not gloomy as allies will arise in the form of two rebellious elves (the return of Legolas) and the despaired lake humans, with it all leading up to the epic encounter with Smaug, the dragon everybody had nightmares about when they were kids.As a whole production, The Desolation Of Smaug is a movie adventure of epic proportions that provides us with a variety of aspects to enjoy, from the incredible visual effects that bring Smaug to life, to the beautiful photography that takes us to Middle Earth once again and makes us glare at its beauty, all while adding a little light humor to amuse the audience. The acting is once again on par with what is required, as leading man Martin Freeman brings his witty and goofy charm to the character of Bilbo Baggins. Other standouts include Sir Ian McKellen as the wise and determined wizard Gandalf, and the voice of Smaug, done splendidly by Benedict Cumberbatch. Peter Jackson manages to make this second entry more exciting and riveting, by never directing an action packed story that never lets us breathe. One particular scene that wowed me was a chase fantastically choreographed through battles between the elves (arrows), orcs (wooden clubs) and the dwarfs in the barrels (pieces of wood and stone), that closely resembled the one in The Adventures Of Tintin (produced by Jackson)Running nearly three hours long, Desolation Of Smaug once again stretches the story so that the one book can be accommodated to three feature films. Nonetheless it doesn't drag at a slow pace like its predecessor, and with the combined efforts of the effects and narrative, it flows perfectly towards an ending that leaves us sizzling for the final entry in the series.Rating: 8/10",8,3,5,3 January 2014
The Fault in Our Stars," Good, but underwhelming
","I must say that The Fault In Our Stars caused a certain feeling on me that I'm not accustomed to, since I'm still trying to figure out my emotional reaction to the film. On one hand, I enjoyed the story and the movie flows in a good way. On the other I feel a little underwhelmed by the effect the movie was trying to convey. Cancer is always a tough subject, especially at a young age as is the case in this movie. In a way, I related to the characters, but didn't care enough to cry at the end. Unfortunately I have experienced one side of this disease, as I saw my Grandfather pass away because of it. Still this personal heartache wasn't enough for me to end up loving the movie.In terms of execution, I have no complaints, as the movie is expertly directed, written and acted. Shailene Woodley & Ansel Elgort handle their roles in a great manner and make the romance more believable. There has been some Oscar talk for Woodley's performance, and personally I wouldn't mind seeing her nominated.I guess that by the end of this review, I have decided upon my evaluation of the film. So, in the end, I believe that a movie like The Fault In Our Stars is primarily a 'chick flick', as its marketing strategy pointed out that. However If you're looking for a good story and may, or may not, have had a personal encounter with cancer, I would most definitely recommend this film. Speaking for myself, I think it's a nice enough movie to feel like you haven't wasted 2 hours of your time, yet ultimately the story failed to fully grab me in a spectacular emotional fashion.Rating: 7,5/10",7,0,1,31 October 2014
Non-Stop," Thrilling ride with messy resolution
","Non-Stop is, without a doubt, one of the most thrilling movies of the year. Starring modern action hero Liam Neeson, we get a tale of suspense and suspicious thinking (a la Filghtplan). Neeson plays an air Marshal that drowns himself in alcohol in order to surpass the death of his young child and the consequent divorce. While on duty he receives a text message from an anonymous source saying that unless 150 million dollars is transfered to an off shore account, a passenger will be killed every 30 minutes. From then on, Bill Marks (Neeson) will have to work to keep the passengers safe as well as cope with the fact that all evidence points to him being the culprit.Liam Neeson shows once again why he's at the top of his game when he does action. Of course he can do great roles in other genres, but here he handles the role very well and I would say you could not find a better lead for the film. Names such as Julianne Moore, Michelle Dockery and Corey Stoll make for a solid supporting cast and the roles are also brilliantly portrayed. As for the plot and direction, my only complaint can only be the conclusion. All the set-up that leads to the climax is done to a great extent leaving the audience guessing what's gonna happen. Personally I managed to guess the villain (sort of), but I won't go any further here. I'll just say I didn't appreciate the motive.Other than the messy resolution, Non-Stop offers a great story filled with thrills and that will certainly please action enthusiasts. It is a well rounded film wit good acting and overall one of the most solid films of the year.Rating: 7,5/10",7,0,1,5 September 2014
How to Train Your Dragon 2," Incredible sequel and an animation film for the ages
","In 2010 a little movie called How To Train Your Dragon was released by DreamWorks to great critical and commercial success. As circumstances would have it, I would watch the movie 2 years later and be completely mesmerized by its beauty and amazing storytelling. So with success came the inevitable sequel. I think it's safe to say that most of us fans weren't worried about this one. For starters, the director and writer of the first was back on board. Then there is an undeniable connection between leads Hiccup and Toothless that even with a lackluster script, I think it would still have had its moments. The thing is that not only does HTTYD2 deliver, it is on equal level with its predecessor, but in a different way.The movie's plot focuses on a now human/dragon community in Berk and all seems well. Hiccup is in search of the many lands and dragons to be discovered, while his father is trying to pass the mantle of leadership onto his son. When Hiccup and his girl Astrid come across a ship that's trapping dragons for an unknown figure named Drago who's assembling a Dragon Army, an impending doom seems certain. Hiccup will also come into contact with his estranged mother, whose disappearance is explained in the most beautiful of ways. In the end though Hiccup will have to make choices and deal with the consequences of what does around him do.Overall, this movie is a better sequel than most. Not only does it become its own movie without disconnecting from the first one, but also does lead to some bigger stakes, something I feel most sequels should do. The relationship between Hiccup and Toothless is a strong one, yet not impervious to threat. It was very refreshing seeing even the most strong of friendships challenged with both sides coming out stronger after the ordeal and their bond even more apparent.There's no doubt that comparisons will be made between both movies, and for me I'm still on the fence given I haven't watched the original in a little while. Still I feel that they are of an equally good quality whilst being different from each other. For now though, I can't deny the impact How To Train Your Dragon 2 had on me and I can safely say that this is one of the most incredible movies I've ever seen.Rating: 9-9,5/10",9,3,5,17 June 2015
The Grand Budapest Hotel," An oddball comedy inside a picturesque world
","In what is surely the most weird movie nominated at this year's Oscars, The Grand Budapest Hotel is a movie that feels like a painting come to life, and in that process adding a sense of quirky adventure that will feature the most random of characters. A rousing appreciation has to be given to Ralph Fiennes for giving a comedic performance for the ages. Perhaps not the most Academy Award worthy performance in the eyes of some, but definitely a stand out from the more dramatic roles that earned high praise this year.This film is yet another project from Wes Anderson that has his mark written all over it. I believe that Wes Anderson is about as close as you'll come to an American director that has a very European style to his films. His American cast counterparts in the movie bring that Hollywood vibe to an other wise independent project. Overall the production values of Grand Budapest Hotel are some of the best of the year. Beautiful cinematography, set design and a smooth directorial effort make for a beautiful movie to behold. On the writing and acting side of things, we get a throwback to the times of screwball comedies. I would say this is the modern screwball movie prototype. Once again, all of the highest praise goes to Fiennes for giving us a wonderful character that not only makes you laugh at the right times, but to a certain degree intrigues you. Throughout the extensive cast there are many good turns, yet our most inexperienced member Tony Revlori more than holds up against our leading man, making for a very believable friendship between the two in the movie.It's not every day that I watch a movie like this. In fact, this is my first Anderson movie, and I gotta say that his style can go either way with me. While I hold off for a while on seeing more of his movies, I leave The Grand Budapest Hotel with a solid score and with the memory of being thoroughly entertained by it.Rating: 7/10",7,1,2,20 February 2015
The Theory of Everything," Endearing and beautiful
","Stephen Hawking is a man whose deficiencies seem to have stuck with the image the public forms of this celebrated scientist. The feeling one gets from watching The Theory Of Everything is that before his illness started leaving its mark, Hawking acted like an ordinary scholar. Of course his brilliance is now very much acknowledged and the fact is that his theories would have come to light whether or not he had to battle the disease.Anyways, this movie is adapted from Jane Hawking's memoir 'Travelling To Infinity: My Life With Stephen' and is a story about the many difficulties that their marriage had to endure as Stephen fought to live and find a way to make his life's work meaningful, and on the other end, the commitment Jane gave to her marriage, despite everything going against it. With two heavy protagonists such as these, top talent was needed and suffice to say that Redmayne and Jones were more than up to the task. Redmayne gives one of the best performances of the year as he plays three stages of the character. The transition from one stage to another is phenomenal and brings the best out of our leading man. Felicity Jones does equally well, although her role isn't as flashy. Still her charming and charismatic nature allow for a great turn, when one could expect a less than good performance.While the movie does come together beautifully through it's two leads, the filmmaking process isn't as strong with the biopic structure being very normally used. Johann Johannsson's soundtrack is a delight to hear though and along with the performances, are the best part of the film. The Theory Of Everything isn't the most brilliant film in this year's Oscars, but it certainly is worth it to see some of the best performances of the year and hear a rich score that I hope, deservedly, wins an Academy Award.Rating: 8/10",8,0,0,18 February 2015
Frozen," Disney just brings magic into my world
","Frozen is quite simply an unforgettable movie experience that in my view is to be enjoyed by people of all ages. Adapted from the tale by Hans Christian Andersen, Frozen is a story of young princess, named Elsa who inexplicably has the power to create ice. When she accidentally hurts her younger sister, Anna, she is instructed by her parents to conceal these powers. After her parents tragic death, she loses all control on her coronation day and leaves her kingdom trapped in a eternal winter. From then on Anna sets out on a journey to search for her sister and bring summer back. Anna is a very likable lead character as she is very energetic and brings the spirit of youth that the movie lives off. Kristoff is a great romantic interest for Anna and you sense it growing as the movie progresses. As for the comedy, Olaf and Sven are quite funny and bring the lightest moments in the film.Not since The Lion King have the songs from a Disney movie stuck to my head as much as this one. I'm still hearing 'For The First Time In Forever' and 'Let It Go' in my head. Overall fantastic job in the musical department. As an animation film, Frozen is very grand in its imagery and captures the magical feeling that these movies set out to do. If it wins at the Academy Awards, and it probably will, it is very much deserved. Simply magicalRating 9,5/10",9,3,7,13 February 2014
The Bourne Legacy," Elegant replacement, but we miss Bourne himself
","Aaron Cross (Jeremy Renner) has stepped up and I would say that he is a worthy replacement, but it's just not the same thing without Matt Damon and his iconic Bourne character. After a wonderfully constructed trilogy, this franchise enters new territory with a change of characters, but with the same CIA secrecy and the same universe. In this movie, we find out that behind Treadstone and Black Briar, there is another covert program called Outcome that focused on developing bio- weapons that can be used to enhance the skills of their agents. Due to the ripple effects that occurred in the Ultimatum, the people responsible are looking to terminate everything and leave no trace and that ultimately sets up the plot for the rest of the movie.Renner's Cross comes into the picture as an agent that escapes this dreadful fate and seeks out Dr. Marta Shearing (Rachel Weisz), another survivor of the clean-up, in order to get the viral treatment he needs to remain mentally and physically stable and therefore able to survive. The lead performances are great as Renner and Weisz expertly play their characters and understand them. Most importantly, Renner is very suitable as a combat expert and while not as awesome as Bourne, the shoes were filled quite nicely. As our CIA chaser, we have Edward Norton giving a good, if slightly less intense than any of the previous performances of this type of character. I'm usually not a critic of Paul Greengrass's shaky cam technique, at least not in Bourne movies, But I must say that Tony Gilroy's approach was an enjoyable and lighter one and I for one liked it. The script is, as you'd expect, a by the book Bourne story and a good one at that.You might find yourself missing Bourne in this film and I think it would be awesome if Matt Damon could get on board again and perhaps team up with Renner's Cross. As far as this one goes, while it doesn't bring anything new to the franchise, it is still an enjoyable movie and on par with the original trilogy.Rating 8/10",8,2,3,3 July 2014
22 Jump Street," Sequel that makes fun of itself...ummm
","22 Jump Street is first and foremost a sequel, something the movie itself will tell you repeatedly. Not a bad thing though as most of the fun comes from there. In this installment of the Jump Street saga, Jenko & Schmidt are now heading to college to take down a drug scheme that lead to the murder of a student. Sound familiar? That's because as they were instructed, our undercover agents are told to do 'it' exactly like last time. In all seriousness though, we all came here for the comedy and that fact the movie goes for a self-referential approach is the platform for all the crazy stunts and jokes we want to see.Hill and Tatum are once again great in their roles as they share an incredible chemistry on screen and nail their characters. As far as supporting cast goes Ice Cube is once again good in his type of character, particularly in one hilarious scene. Also a shout out to a great Peter Stromae turn, as he explores his comedic side. Overall this movie is a very worthwhile follow up to the original. It's as funny and explosive and it undoubtedly pleases fans. As the movie suggests as well, we can't wait to see what's to come for this building franchise. Let us hope 23 Jump Street is another fun one.Rating: 8,5/10",8,1,3,17 June 2015
Moulin Rouge!," You'll either love it or hate it
","Moulin Rouge! has cemented itself as one of my most cherished movies of all time. It was the first film that made me cry, and that's saying something since very few movies have done this.We are introduced to Paris at the start of the 20th Century. The bohemian spirit is alive and well, so a young English man traveling from London named Christian, decides to get involved in this movement. Upon meeting a group of misfits, lead by Toulouse-Latrec, Christian is set up as the writer of a new play that will embody the values of the bohemians: Truth, Beauty, Freedom and above all Love. He ends up falling for Satine, a beautiful courtesan that sells her love. Trouble arises when the play's investor, The Duke, is also enchanted by Satine. What follows is a tale of despair and heartbreak that will showcase a full range of emotions.What gets to me most in this movie, are the musical numbers which are mostly well sung and choreographed. From the wonderful Your Song to the magical Elephant Love Medley, and from the beautiful Come What May to the daring El Tango De Roxanne, everything falls into place in a wonderful production work. It also helps that the movie is extremely well acted and the cast's strenght help the message get across.Moulin Rouge! is by no means a perfect movie. No movie is, at least in not in the sense that everyone is fully pleased, and despite my feelings towards it, I too recognize the flaws. Still no movie pulls me into the fantastic world that is cinema quite like Moulin Rouge! . That for me is worth every penny.Rating: 10/10",10,0,2,18 October 2014
The Amazing Spider-Man 2," Not so amazing, but not terrible Spider-Man movie
","Let me start by saying that I have enjoyed all the Spider-Man movies released so far, some more than others, and while they are different in various aspects, I think they all provide enough quality entertainment for those less demanding. In this second installment of the rebooted series, we get yet another authentic Peter Parker/Spider-Man performance from Andrew Garfield, who seems to have fitted in well to this iconic role, and a plot that while it does present some inconsistency, manages to at least keep itself going with great action and good character development in some cases.So the movie follows Peter Parker loving his life as the hero of New York City: Spider-Man. We immediately get to see him going at it, being cocky and jokey, but also knowing when it's time to stop the bad guy. Throughout the film Peter will have to fight with his inner conscience, as he ponders if he should stay with his love, Gwen Stacy, or respect her father's wishes to keep her out of danger. As Spider-Man, he will also have to deal with Electro, formerly known as Max Dillon, an lonely Oscorp worker who becomes obsessed with Spider-Man. Upon having an accident at his work place, he turns into Electro and will begin to hold a grudge over Spidey, after he sees things in a different perspective. Perhaps the best part of the movie is the Harry Osborn subplot, which in the long term, seems to lead into the Sinister Six storyline that Sony is trying to put together.All parts of the movie have their ups and downs, but mostly combine to make for an enjoyable experience. Peter & Gwen's relationship troubles are at times front and center and the chemistry from Garfield and Stone (real life partners) really helps the movie's flow. I think that some comic book fanatics just need to appreciate the emotional aspect of this connection in the movie. Electro was at times very misused. but the good effort by Jamie Foxx makes him an acceptable villain for the movie. As far as Oscorp and Peter's dad's past, all the components are well put together, even if it does depend on coincidental actions. Dane DeHaan's Osborn is in my opinion well portrayed, and I for one can understand why he comes off as whiny, after all I did appreciate his back story.The Amazing Spider-Man 2 delivered some aspects well, mainly the action. Yet much like Iron Man 3, it felt like the potential was fully stretched, which is a shame, since it could have made the movie live to it's title, and be amazing, which is something the first one wasn't, despite being better than its successor. I really hope they can give us a terrific third movie. Fingers crossed Rating: 7/10",7,2,5,5 October 2014
The Imitation Game," Cumberbatch's power as an actor elevates the film
","When it comes to The Imitation Game I think that in the future I will remember this movie as a great vehicle for Benedict Cumberbatch to score an Oscar nomination (his first). There is no doubt that Cumberbatch is one of the most talented actors of his generation and in this film he finally gets the role that writes his name in movie history. Assuming he keeps up the great work he's done so far, I believe this is only the start for him.The story is of Alan Turing, a brilliant English mathematician who, along with a team of equally brilliant minds, cracked the Nazi code Enigma and ultimately played an instrumental part in winning the war for the allies. What makes him the idealized subject for a biographical film, however, is his troubled sexual orientation. Given the mentality that was a part of the world at that time, Turing's homosexuality led to him being very secretive. In the movie we get side plot lines that explore the past heartbreak that this genius man endured and also the aftermath of the war and how it took it's toll on our him.As I said before, Benedict Cumberbatch is simply brilliant in the representation of Alan Turing. The man sells insecurity, meticulousness and emotion like no other. There may, in fact, be no part that the he can't play in nothing other than astounding fashion. In his shadow, I would say that all the supporting players are on par with each other. I personally enjoyed seeing Matthew Goode and Mark Strong respectively offering different types of character in a strong manner. As far as Knightley's nominated performance goes, I feel she was solid and was a fresh female presence in an otherwise men's show.The directing and writing are mostly just above average unfortunately. And I say this because the movie was captivating enough to hold my attention, yet it was the great acting by the cast, with special consideration for the leading man, that elevated the movie . Nonetheless, The Imitation Game is a somewhat valid choice if you want to reach the surface of Turing's contributions to the world and his turbulent private life. As far as I'm concerned, I will look back and appreciate Cumberbatch's enigmatic performance in future viewings.Rating: 7,5-8/10",7,1,5,20 February 2015
A Bug's Life," Pixar's hidden gem
","When looking back at the Pixar movies, one almost seems to forget A Bug's Life. Perhaps it's the fact that another similar movie from DreamWorks called Antz came out that same year and the two are often mistaken for one another. Or maybe it's the fact that Pixar has made even bigger and slightly better movies since. Either way, this was the last movie from Pixar's first few I had left to watch, and once again great animated fun was delivered.I'm happy to say that the Pixar mark was very much hit with this movie and my expectations were met. So this movie tells the story of an ant called Flik, who has to recruit 'warrior' insects to fight off the Grasshoppers that demand double the amount of food the ants can supply. The movie really starts to get funny when the circus bugs that Flik gets as warriors (or so he thinks) come into play. Their interactions, as well as their quirks make for some very good comedic scenes. As for the main plot, the empowerment of the little ants over the mighty grasshoppers is endearing enough to pull you in. Overall, this movie is a sort of a hidden gem of Pixar, as it is overshadowed by movies that even I admit to liking more. Nonetheless, A Bug's Life is on par with those entertainment wise.Rating: 8/10",8,2,2,11 September 2015
Prisoners," Dark and cold thriller that nails the mark.
","Prisoners is the type of movie that is getting less and less recurrent in Hollywood and a must-see for anybody that enjoys a thriller that doesn't reach exaggerated proportions. Morally challenging and provoking, this is a story about how to handle a dire situation such as the disappearance of two young children. The two main characters provide us with very different scopes of this dilemma. On one hand Jackman's Dover is an emotional driven man who while acknowledging his wrong doings, doesn't restrain himself and goes past any boundaries to ensure his family's safety. On the other hand Gyllenhaal's Loki is a detective that not only shows determination to succeed in another case, but grows to be defined by it, as even he will boil under pressure. The performances are astonishing from these two men and you feel their tribulations throughout the film, whether it's Jackman's descent into near madness or Gyllenhaal's anxiety as he pursues every lead possible. Director Denie Villenueve provides us with a moody setting that not only attracts us to this shadowy story, but also connects with all aspects provided with his co-workers such as a fantastic cinematography work and a striking script that will fill with as much doubt as the characters in the movie. My only complaint is that I thought it ran a bit too long and a little sharper editing would have been fine with me, since not only would I rate it higher, but also would have had an even better experience. Having watched the film, I can only say that is deserving of its recognition (IMDB Top 250) and I hope I get to see more movies churned out like these.Rating 7/10",9,1,2,22 January 2014
Toy Story," The one that started it all
","In my love for movies, I have come across various types of movies that feel very special to me, but there is one production company in particular that resonates closely to my heart. Pixar is that company and the animation powerhouse of the industry. In 1995, they ventured into their first movie feature with Toy Story, the first movie to be 100% made by computer effects. This of course gives the movie an iconic status in cinema history.The story is about toys that come to life when we aren't watching and in this case, we see Woody (Tom Hanks), a cowboy doll cope with the arrival of a newer toy named Buzz Lightyear (Tim Allen). For such an innovative film, the plot might seem quite basic. Still, this works pretty well for the movie, as a good buddy story ended up being a fitting way to introduce us to this world. Future installments would tackle more intricate themes of toys having 'souls' and their ultimate relationship with humans and specially children. However, the first adventure is still fondly remembered as a feel good movie for all ages that entertains to a great extent. In retrospect, we now know that this little movie was the start of a great series of films (with some duds along the way as well). And what a great start it was.Rating: 9,5/10",9,0,1,11 September 2015
Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind," A beautiful awakening
","Translated to 'The Awakening Of The Mind' in my country, Sunshine is an homage to the beauty of love, but also its ugly side. Combined with a scientific feel, the movie delivers a funny and witty love story that makes some rather important questions that are mainly associated with moral and ethical dilemmas. The plot revolves around a man that chooses to have his former partner erased from his mind, after finding out that she did the same procedure. The leads are played wonderfully by Jim Carrey and Kate Winslet, who show off their acting skill by playing characters not usually associated with their type of roles. The direction and co-screenplay by Michel Gondry is a visual and quirky feast for the eyes and will suck you in right from the start. The supporting performances are also very pleasant, as they deliver what we ask of them. A very beautiful film and a true awakening from the complications of life, Eternal Sunshine nails the mark.Rating 8/10",8,1,3,13 May 2014
Elysium," An entertaining summer movie that hides some of its plot flaws
","I realize that most of the people who watched Elysium felt a little bit disappointed with the end result as they, much like me, may have been expecting a poignant story by Neill Blomkamp. Personally I was thoroughly entertained by this movie and the fact is that perhaps the non-stop action was there to keep some more distracted viewers busy, while the more observant moviegoer caught some plot holes that may have hurt the experience all together. Sure I like to see a movie like this present itself in coherent a manner, yet I feel that the incredible action sequences, as well as some marvelous special effects swayed my opinion on the film. As far as plot goes, it's a fairly simple set up. In 2154, the functioning world is separated into two spaces. Earth is over populated by the poor and is pretty much a disorganized land. Then there is Elysium, a idealistic paradise for the wealthy. What sets the story in motion is one man's mission to change the current regime of things in order to save himself and other desperate earthlings.Being released during the summer, I believe that this choice was valid as it definitely stacks up among the more entertaining crowd of movies in this season. What puts it over some of those is that it presents an interesting idea, if somewhat underdeveloped. So with good performances, stunning action and great effects, Elysium is definitely a movie worth watching. If you want to be entertained then I guess you will enjoy it. However if you seek more from the story than what is presented you may find yourself disappointed by it.Rating: 8,5/10",8,0,1,11 August 2014
Toy Story 2," A very worthy follow up
","With the massive success of the first Toy Story, a sequel really had to deliver to not be forgotten and fortunately this was very much on par. I look at this movie as yet another brilliant part of a perfect trilogy in my eyes. In this installment, the gang are back and this time, Buzz will lead a rescue mission for Woody, who has been kidnapped by a man looking to get rich from Woody and his roundup collection. This film gets a little more visceral in some parts, as segments such as new toy Jessie's back story with a girl who 'abondened' her and even Woody questioning his place with Andy after his arm is ripped. The fun, however, is still here and our favorite secondary characters are once again prone to give us the laughter we yearn from these movies. Toy Story 2 is yet another accomplished Pixar project and a great continuation of its most accomplished movie series. As far as I'm concerned, this movies are as awesome as movies can be.Rating: 8,5-9/10",8,0,1,11 September 2015
Frank," What Is Frank?
","At first sight, Frank seems like a quirky, indie movie that you don't quite know where it will end up. Once you connect with the story and the characters, I believe the comic part of the film will resonate more. Basically, this movie tells the story of a young man attempting to make it big in music. When he is brought in to an unusual band with the lead vocalist wearing a big paper head all of the time, he will not only discover his true intentions, but also affect the band in the long haul. I was mostly pleased with the story, with all it's complexities and messages. The comedy was spot on though, with the laughs coming out the right way. Don't expect a laugh out loud riot, as this is a more restrained comedy. Still Frank was an enjoyable experience and Fassbender makes the gimmick work to a very acceptable degree.Rating: 6,5-7/10",7,0,0,28 February 2015
Selma," The man behind the legend
","Selma is about as powerful a movie as you're ever going to get about the extraordinary life of civil rights activist Martin Luther King Jr. . In a time in which racial discrimination is still an important issue, this chronicle of events regarding King's fight for voting equalities in Alabama, presents us with a vision of how the tension between the two sides was even more intense during a period of controversy and change. The movie's goals are to give you this retelling of the struggle and hopefully connect with the audience, while also honoring the heroes behind the progress that was achieved.The plot revolves around MLK's attempts to grant his fellow people the right to be registered voters in their town of Selma. It isn't without resistance that this movement will be met, and from then on the movie lays out the advancements and regressions that ultimately led to the achievement of the objective that was set. As our protagonist we have British actor David Oyelowo who proves he is more than capable of portraying this iconic figure. When it comes down to it, the character is without a doubt brilliantly interpreted by Oyelowo and throughout the film, one feels that the end result of the performance is a signature portrayal by the actor who owns the character from the moment the camera is on, and in return the character lives through the actor. All in all a mixture of characteristics that combine to give an extraordinary rendition of an extraordinary human being.The movie comes together quite nicely and aspects such as the direction from Ava DuVernay and the competent script are all adequate for each other, offering a rich cinematic experience. I really hope Selma has a healthy staying power among liberating movies such as Glory, 12 Years A Slave, etc. It truly is deserving.Rating: 8,5/10",8,2,3,16 February 2015
Mission: Impossible," Timeless franchise starter
","With the release of each Mission: Impossible movie getting better and better reviews after the 2nd one, some portion of the audience affirms that the saga only gets better with each passing installment. Looking forward to seeing Rogue Nation further down the road this year, and having seen Ghost Protocol and enjoying it, I still say with enormous confidence that the first Mission is still to be beaten and maybe the fifth will do it, but I will talk about that another time. Getting back to the point at hand, this movie truly delivers thrills like no other and an incredibly twisted story that keeps you guessing and guessing. Tom Cruise really nailed a role of a lifetime here as he begins to give us Ethan Hunt, a spy that gets more and more iconic status as he is associated with the likes of Bourne and the top spy himself Bond. But the movie succeeds on a lot more levels than this, ranging from the supporting cast to the screenplay and direction. This is a franchise I very much enjoy (even the maligned MI2), but this is the standard bearer of the series and the more espionage driven movie of them all. Terrific StuffRating: 9/10",8,2,2,3 August 2015
Mama," Thrilled and entertained
","These are the two words to describe how I felt watching Mama, and those two adjectives resonate how pleased I was with this film. Horror can be done in flashy style with lots of gore and screaming that rattle your ear drums to exhaustion. Sure the screams are an integral part of this genre, but when done with a touch of mystery, a movie can rise above others as a must see experience that shows what the genre is capable of. The plot is about two children that were abandoned in the woods, where they found a way to survive for 5 years. With their uncle's continuous efforts to find them, eventually the children are rescued and brought home to their relative's care. However they seem to have grown attached to a mysterious entity which they name Mama. This figure will create a lot intense moments and the result is an emotional roller-coaster that will take you to a breathtaking finale. Continuing her string of strong performances, Jessica Chastain once again shows her maturity in a lead role that while not challenging is played with a lot conviction. The child leads reveal their acting abilities as well, as their fears and distrust towards others convey their state of mind quite well. I find Mama to be one of the best in the genre and congratulations are in order to those involved. This movie delivered on what it was supposed to deliver. It thrilled and entertained me.",8,1,3,20 January 2014
Zero Dark Thirty," Chastain shines in a so-so film
","Zero Dark Thirty is a retelling of events that ultimately lead to demise of America's number one enemy: Osama Bin Laden. Lead by CIA operative Maya (Chastain), the mission takes about 8 years to be completed, as both sides play their tactics of deception in what appears to be a dead- end confrontation. Kathryn Bigelow directs this Mark Boal script in the fashion that she wants. In a neutral role, Bigelow presents us with what happened in a period stretching from 2003 to 2011, as the US intelligence worked extensively to apprehend the most ruthless terrorist on earth. Jessica Chastain is once again brilliant as her character conveys determination, but also fear and uncertainty as leads come and go. By the end she is the one pushes the most to see her 8 year work be rewarded with the ultimate goal being achieved. As for technical aspects, the sound is used to great extent to support the visuals. Overall the film does tend to drag at points, and the constant documentary-like look on the story adds a little to the toughness i had connecting with it. I applaud it's virtues in filmmaking and the wonderful performance by Chastain, but in the near future i won't look to this movie to impress me.",7,1,3,13 January 2014
12 Years a Slave," Powerful and worthy of its recognition
","12YAS is the most powerful film among the Best Picture nominees this year, at least when it comes to emotional terms. In fact emotion runs the show in this Steve McQueen directed film. Chiwetej Ejiofor fits the leading man's shoes perfectly and he is the heart and soul of the movie. In a year where Leo DiCaprio and Matthew McConuaghey gave enormous performances, Chiwetel may have to settle for the nomination. This is also an actors movie by excellence, so much that I highlight from the large cast Michael Fassbender and Lupita Nyong'o, both Oscar nominated performances. McQueen's take on this tale is one of a very dark nature, one that is not for everybody. One particular scene is terrifically cringe worthy as you see a sight too horrible to behold. While it may not feel as fresh as other contenders, 12 Years A Slave is a wonderful film that depicts a dark time in American history. Recent movies about slavery have been getting a little backlash as they are becoming far too insistent. I believe that when well done, like in this case, it's no problem that this topic is presented. In fact I encourage it.Rating 8/10",8,0,2,22 February 2014
Whiplash," The determination and drive to be the best
","If there is a craft in which you are trying to succeed at all costs, you need to fully realize that it will take every ounce of commitment from you, even if that alienates you in the eyes of others. The question is are you willing to go through with it? Whiplash is, in that regard, the answer to that situation, and whether one agrees with the method of getting to one's full potential, one cannot deny that once the final product is revealed, the struggle was worth it.So, we are introduced to a young man named Andrew (Miles Teller), with dreams of becoming one of the great jazz drummers to ever exist. At the music school he attends, Andrew is picked by the most lauded teacher in the staff, Terrence Fletcher (J.K Simmons), seemingly to Andrew's delight. But he will soon discover that his new mentor is abusive and mean spirited with his teaching method. From there on, Fletcher will look to push Andrew to his limits in order to truly shine as a full fledged drummer, while Andrew will have to decide how much he is willing to give up in order to make his dream come to fruition.All in all, when it comes to passion for art, in this specific case music, Whiplash showcases a powerful connection between the art form and it's performers. The movie works around the dynamic between Andrew and Fletcher, which is to say the student and the master. However it's in a twisted reverse psychology motivational tool that Whiplash stands out from other movies of the type (besides maybe war movies, where tough discipline is a way of preparing for the future). The relationship as a whole grows throughout the movie, as does Teller's performance, as he becomes increasingly more confident and focused. As for the soon to be Oscar winning turn from J.K Simmons, one can immediately highlight is commanding presence and demanding nature when he is angrily shouting at his students, yet his ability to change right back to a more understanding figure shows the diversity he brought to the role, as he is asserting in both capacities.Whiplash is unlike any movie you will see about the fight to excel no matter what obstacles are put in front of you. It's an addictive, powerful and complete film that will leave you begging for more.Rating: 9/10",9,0,2,18 February 2015
The Wolf of Wall Street," Scorsese reaches yet another level with this outrageous outing
","Unapologetic and completely wild, The Wolf Of Wall Street is another landmark film from legendary director Martin Scorsese. Excess is a understatement when it comes to this story of American capitalism and its consequences. Jordan Belfort rose to extreme wealth and chose a lifestyle incomparable to the regular way of living. He was filthy rich and made sure everyone around him knew that. If I were to separate this movie in parts it would be 3. Start, Climb and Fall. Belfort experiences these three stages and you feel part of him changing in every one of them.Being a passion project from Leonardo DiCaprio, it is quite understandable the amount of heart and soul he put into this film. Leo is explosive,huge and just breathtakingly grand in the skin of this Wall Street king. Throughout the long running time you just feel that everyone around Belfort just follows him and ultimately end up imitating him. Matthew McConaughey pops in for a brief cameo and for me, it seemed that he was the starting point of Jordan's transformation. In one scene we still notice that JB is a little green to this new world. What follows from this first meeting is the beginning of a road that leads to a downfall of epic proportions. Jonah Hill is a believable best friend to Belfort, if you can call him that, while Margot Robbie is a woman that while associated with the lifestyle, stands above it all in the end.Marty presents all his trademark tools to tell this immoral story. Despite feeling that you have seen this before, you will witness it all happening again but in a different way. The script is filled with words that basically describe the feeling of being powerful. Jordan Belfort doesn't kill or hurt people. He grows financially due to some illegal processes. Maybe that's why I felt that Jordan's punishment didn't really feel deserved. Don't get me wrong he is a despicable human being, but despite his flaws you just don't want his journey to end. You enjoy this world as long as you're watching it from a distance. The Wolf Of Wall Street is a movie that exemplifies human behavior at its lowest, but are you going to do something about it? No. You just sit back and watch them fall on their own.Rating 8,5/10",9,0,2,17 February 2014
The Hobbit: The Battle of the Five Armies," An effects spectacle
","I decided from the very start to take this film for what it was gonna be and that was a finale with the most epic of battles. As far as story and characters go, the movie does resonate with me on a couple of things. First and foremost, Thorin's transition from a man obsessed with power to a fighting warrior that is willing to die for his brothers is one of the good things this movie brings. Bilbo is also another character that gets good closure, and let's be honest, it would be a travesty if he didn't since he is in the movie's title. Regardless of how you felt about their objective, the battle scenes were terrificly shot and added to the overall scope of the film.Still not all is well with this final chapter in the saga, such as the misguided way to highlight all stories in the movie. It straight up continues on from the end of DOS, as it takes care of that in the first 20 minutes, making it only the official end of the previous movie. With Desolation Of Smaug we still had a meet up between Gandalf and Thorin prior to the mission, something I felt was a good way to start an individual chapter. Once again, criticism of how the book was divided is reasonable. I think with some good editing, these three movies could have easily become one 3-hour single film with each of the three movies made taking one hour. Instead we got what we got and it ended up only having some good moments when compared to the ultimate journey that was The Lord Of The Rings. So to close this review, I say that The Hobbit trilogy had its ups and downs. I found the first one nothing more than a set-up with some dullness behind it. The second one upped the ante and is my favorite of the trilogy and the last one tried its best to wrap up everything in a pleasing fashion. Having come after the LOTR movies, the comparison was always gonna be unfair and given that a trilogy was drawn out of one book, the adaptation was always going to be difficult. Despite this, I appreciated the efforts and actually found the last 2 movies to be quite entertaining if slightly muddled in their overall cuts.Rating: 7,5-8/10",7,5,8,23 May 2015
Inception," Nolan's vision is still breathtaking
","As much as I can't deny that in more recent viewings, Inception hasn't wowed me as much as the first time (but then again few movies do). Still, in one of my latest revisits, the movie continues to grab my full attention whether it's with smartly written dialog or exciting action scenes. Plus I still believe that DiCaprio deserved a bit more recognition in his role as it's one of great emotional depth.So in Inception we are introduced to a world in which dream-sharing is possible and procedures like extraction are the norm in the espionage game. Cobb (DiCaprio) seems to be the biggest player, but now he is faced with a choice, as a wealthy energy mogul named Saito (Watanabe) promises him an opportunity to stop running and go back home to the U.S. The catch? He must perform Inception on the subject, or in more known terms, implant an idea in the subconscious. Christopher Nolan has directed one the best movies of the genre for me. A complex idea that is shown to the audience by fantastic visuals and asks some pertinent questions, Inception allows you to be entertained but also mentally aware of what's going on. It is a blockbuster movie, there's no question there. However it's one that offers a unique story that plays out at a fast pace and with ideas that will certainly be discussed after the movie finishes.Inception is without a doubt still a great movie. It's been 4 years since its release, so understandably the hype has died down, as has the discussion of the movie's plot. Some of us still love it, others have been let down in repeat viewings, while some still claim the movie is flawed and not smart. Personally I believe it's a masterpiece within the genre. As a general movie? Well that's a discussion for another time. My final advice is whether you end up liking it not, do yourself a favor and watch this movie if you still haven't. It's unmissable.Rating: 10/10",10,0,1,1 September 2014
The Shawshank Redemption," Hope overcomes everything
","This subtitle might sound a little cheesy, but in fact the movie presents us with a story of having to cope with a harsh reality, and in the end, managing to move on from it. The Shawshank Redemption always gives to me the feeling that it is separated between two very different acts. Although this separation isn't balanced in the runtime, it is, in a way, the manner in which the film is constructed.At the beginning, we are introduced to Andy Dufresne (Robbins), a man accused of murdering his wife and her lover. He is sent to Shawshank Prison for life, and there he meets Red (Freeman), the man who can get you anything you want. Over the years, Andy will become good friends with Red, be brutally abused by a group of aggressive homosexuals, and participate in a series of scams orchestrated by the warden. All the time Andy spends in incarceration seems like a living hell, thus setting up the dark, absorbing environment of most of the movie's runtime. By the time we get to the last part of the film, we see a pleasant payoff that presents itself in a different tone, one that while sometimes present in the movie's gritty prison setting, lashes out fully in the last few scenes.Directed masterfully by Frank Darabont, and with career defining performances from Tim Robbins and Morgan Freeman, Shawshank lives on as a cinematic landmark. It's a movie that captures the essence of good storytelling and lives up to its legacy through that, while also being a competently made film, with a diverse soundtrack and a beautifully planned production design.For me, The Shawshank Redemption represents assuming responsibility and coming to terms with a complicated situation, while also having the strenght to triumph over adversity. As Andy says, hope is what keeps a man mentally stable and in my estimation the most powerful feeling in a movie like this.Rating 10/10",10,0,0,2 October 2014
Birdman or (The Unexpected Virtue of Ignorance)," Beautifully shot, complex story
","Upon watching Birdman I was left with a sense of bedazzlement. The movie features great performances with characters that are a reflection of the real world. The long takes by Iñárittu are wonderfully executed and exceptionally supported by great lighting and a competent cinematography. Still the whole experience felt somewhat underwhelming.To summarize, this movie is about Riggan Thomson, a man famous for portraying Birdman, a comic book superhero. Now he is trying to shed this association as he attempts to make it big on Broadway with an adaptation he writes, directs and stars in. Keaton was off course a perfect choice given his background as Batman in the late80's/early 90's. I feel that this movie expertly satirizes the pop culture aspects of today in a way that doesn't offend. Since I am as much a fan of this type of movie as I am of the blockbuster, I can relate to that. While Riggan is the main focus, characters like Mike, Lesley and Sam all offer their version of a real life person. Norton's Mike is a mockery of the method actor that seems to over accentuate everything when it comes to their art. Stone's Sam is the typical messed up daughter of a once famous actor and to a lesser degree, Watts's Lesley is that actress that doesn't know what happened to her ambitions as a performer. I do admit that last one isn't that apparent. All in all, these three and other main cast members do a stunning job.Birdman is a movie that did seem to wanna say something about the current world. It's problems along with how people from a different time are adapting and coping with themselves. Still the message fails to fully come across, at least for me. However I still applaud what is an otherwise well made film.Rating: 7/10",7,0,5,21 February 2015
The Conjuring," The right atmosphere
","The Conjuring is a great and genuinely frightening horror movie that, given the right atmosphere, can scare anyone in to their deepest core. The story follows a case taken on by paranormal investigators Ed & Lorraine Warren in which they will attempt to rid a family of a demonic presence that threatens to destroy their lives. Congratulations are very much in order to the people who made the movie what it is ranging from the isolated location and its gloomy surroundings. The visuals involving the demons are also very well presented and make you gasp at what you are seeing. The players stick to their roles and give the performances the film needs to succeed. I strongly urge you to watch this movie if you're looking for a well constructed thriller that will definitely have you at the edge of your seat. Just make sure you have the right atmosphere to watch it. I guarantee it will be worth it.Rating: 8,5/10",8,1,1,21 July 2014
Raging Bull," De Niro & Scorsese in their peak
","Raging Bull is quite simply one of the best works that cinema has offered and part of that is attributed to a genial directing job by Martin Scorsese and a brilliant performance by Robert De Niro (My 2nd favorite of all time). This movie is about the downward spiral of boxer Jake La Motta, who due to his jealousy and temper issues alienates all those close to him. With the objective of becoming the middleweight champion, Jake is angry, stubborn and always finds a reason to start arguing. Robert De Niro gives his career best performance that earned him his second Oscar. La Motta is a despicable human being that mistreats his wife and nearly murders his brother. However with De Niro's own mark, one can see that this man isn't all bad. He manages to conquer his girl by being sweet and caring, while also sharing a deep connection with his brother Joey, at least until his dark side wins over. Speaking of Joey, Joe Pesci also delivers a poignant performance of Joey La Motta, who always tries to bring his brother to reason, until he can no longer help Jake. Complementing this movie's emotional strenght we see spectacular cinematography work and great boxing sequences that are as gripping as you can get. I have yet to see a better Scorsese movie. This is the one that always leaves me baffled and De Niro gives the 2nd best performance I have ever seen, only surpassed by Daniel Day Lewis in There Will Be Blood. Raging Bull is a timeless classic and a movie that exemplifies the best of Martin Scorsese & Robert De Niro.Rating: 10/10",10,2,2,23 August 2014
Fifty Shades of Grey," The problem is... it's boring
","I must say that having not yet ventured into any sexual activity, let alone BDSM, I went into this movie for the mere curiosity surrounding it. And much like the Twilight movies, I found myself bored and unpleased. Basically this movie is about nothing, and not in the good Seinfeld way. To tell you the truth, the only parts with some actual excitement to them were the more spicy ones. It's nothing too extreme, but still sexy in a small way. While the movie does have some good set decoration and wardrobe, that's about all the redeeming qualities about it. The leads share little chemistry, the dialog is awful and the script is about as pointless as it gets. Let's be honest here, I know this is for the ladies looking to see their fantasies on screen and I don't condone that. Still it's clear that apart from those 'bold scenes', there isn't much more to this movie and its future sequels.Rating: 1/10",2,3,6,14 May 2015
The Wolverine," Good personal story, but lack of enthusiasm
","Starting a bit off topic here, but usually the Christopher Nolan films get bashed by their detractors for their serious, grounded approach that in their view takes out the fun of watching a superhero movie. Being a huge fan of those movies, I strongly disagree, as the conclusions to those films have a great climax and you can actually feel some excitement. In The Wolverine, however, I didn't exactly feel that.The movie begins with Logan/Wolverine saving a Japanese soldier during the Nagasaki bombing in 1945. Now 60 years have passed, and Logan is wandering alone in the woods, mourning Jean Grey, who had died at his hands in X-Men: The Last Stand. He is summoned to Japan by the man he saved in the past. A now dying old man who seeks Wolverine's immortality. Through a web of deceit and a world he does not know, Wolverine must fight his inner demons, while also protecting Mariko, the grand daughter of old man Yachida.The individual story is always one of the more unique in the X-Men universe, and this movie tried to show us Wolverine, the troubled mutant, instead of presenting us with Wolverine, the bad ass mutant seeking revenge, like X-Men Origins: Wolverine did in 2009. This was an idea I was fond of, since it could actually turn into an interesting movie plot. The execution, though, was mixed. Once again, I think the focus of the film is spot on, but in the end I didn't feel like I was watching an awesome comic book movie. Instead the mood was overall OK, and the movie isn't shockingly bad, but still more could have been done.While I still wait to watch X-Men: Days Of Future Past, it's good to see Hugh Jackman owning his iconic role yet again, even if it is a lesser X- Men film. I guess I have to wait just a little bit more to experience ,what I hope is, an excellent X-Men movie.Rating: 7/10",7,1,2,4 August 2014
The Croods," Visually stunning and very nice story
","The Croods is one of those movies that has you wonder at the marvelous setting that is provided by the filmmakers, while also managing to keep you attracted to the plot and its characters. Basically Eep is your typical teenager that in this case lives in a world in which her family are the only cavemen left alive and under the protection of her father, Grug, live a safe but uneventful life. Wanting to explore and find out more about her world, she escapes one evening and meets Guy, a human boy about her age that appears to be more knowledgeable about the world than her father. Eep learns that change is coming and that time is running out. Soon The Croods will be taken on an adventure in which they will bond as a family, while experiencing change in a world that is now showing its marvels. The Croods is a light animation feature that will surely entertain the little ones with some funny jokes and characters. As for the grown ups, the story is strong enough to hold the audience in and at some moments may have you doubting the outcome of this family that one can relate to. DreamWorks Animation is back in full force and I for one am pleased with this family film.Rating 8/10",8,2,3,3 February 2014
Monsters University," On par with level 2 movies of Pixar
","Pixar has made some very well regarded animation films that will surely stand the test of time as some of the best animated stories of all time. In level 1 of these movies, and the ones I consider classics we find Toy Story (1995), Toy Story 2 (1999), Monsters Inc. (2001), Finding Nemo (2003), The Incredibles (2004), Wall-E (2008), Up! (2009) and Toy Story 3 (2010). This prequel to one of the movies above is on par with level 2 of Pixar movies with movies like Cars (2006) and Ratatouille (2007). They don't necessarily disappoint, but they lack the powerful brilliance of the other films.So the plot centers around young college freshmen and bitter enemies at first, Mike Wazowski (Crystal) and James P. Sullivan (Goodman), as they attempt to get their scaring majors at Monsters University. For little monster Mike, things are very tough to achieve and his main challenge in the movie is to work against adversity and prove to the whole school that he is scary. As for Sullivan, he seems to have it all easy and is very much admired by his fellow classmates due to his family's good name. But with the pressures of living up to the high standards he is expected to meet, he will have to find the strenght within him and believe in himself. Both these characters look to show this at the annual Scare Games, with the haunting Dean Hardscrabble watching their every move.Like I said, the unique feeling of the first one is missing. While in Monsters Inc. Boo churned most of the heart, in this one the scenes involving Mike and Sullivan's vulnerability just don't match up, despite being great on their own. The laughter is as good, if slightly different from the previous movie. In the end, I think this movie is yet another delightful movie from the studio that has become the hit maker of Hollywood. Out of the two movies I prefer to watch MI, but don't pass out on this one either. It's a real treat.Rating: 8/10",8,0,0,28 June 2014
Toy Story 3," Perfect
","Toy Story 3 is my most cherished movie experience of all time. The whole trilogy is a creative, heartfelt and overall perfect piece storytelling for all ages. With the first movie, we experience jealousy and rivalry between toys, as well as the realization of finding out you're a toy. In the end, the toys come to terms with their differences, and their roles in life and learn to co-exist. Toy Story 2 explores issues of abandonment and how lonely an unused toy can become. However it's with 3 that Toy Story packs a wallop of a tale. The years have passed and Andy has grown up and is set for college. Woody & the gang haven't been played with in years and face the dire consequences of human aging. Before they come up against this situation, they are thrown into one last adventure, where they will have to escape an evil teddy bear that resents being replaced by a young girl.Pixar's magic always seemed to work because they managed to mix a good story with nice comedic elements and great emotional moments. Basically the goal was to explore human feelings by presenting us with a beautiful animated world, where anything can happen. The balance between real world conflicts and an imaginary existence was mostly the secret behind Pixar's success. So it's no surprise that Toy Story 3 not only embodies this, but may have the best execution of that idea. Never have I been more in sync with the plot and the characters in a movie. They laugh, I laugh, they get scared, I get scared, and most of all, they cry, I cry. In what I can describe to you as the best 10 minutes I've ever seen in a movie, animated or live action, Andy says goodbye to his childhood by passing down his toys to a new owner. He will always remember them, and they, in return, will always be there for them.So if you know what it's like to let go of your childhood and grow up, but still crave a nice reminder of those carefree times, Toy Story 3 is the perfect film for you. I'm 18, and even I already feel like Andy and all others that can relate. This is my favorite film of all time, and it may very well be for years to come. Just breathtakingly perfect.Rating: 10/10",10,3,4,29 October 2014
Before Sunrise," A Trip In Vienna
","Before Sunrise is the start of a beautifully constructed trilogy that will make you feel very close to the story and its characters. Set in the Austrian capital Vienna, one gets to see a visceral beauty that only a more classic European city can give. The story follows Jesse (Ethan Hawke) and Céline (Julie Delpy), who, after meeting on a train bound for Vienna, decide to spend the day in the city before Jesse has to leave the next day for his home in America. What follows next is a wonderful connection between these two people who seem to be very interested in finding out personal details from each other. First of all, when a movie tries to sell long conversations as a pivotal point in story and character development it needs a solid script and top actors to deliver this to the audience and in my view this is accomplished splendidly.Hawke and Delpy fit perfectly into their roles and it's no wonder they have contributed to the evolution of the characters in the 2 later installments in the trilogy. As for this first movie's screenplay, Rinchard Linklater and Kim Krizan succeed in presenting a convincing and thoughtful story that is wonderfully told through every word spoken by the leads. Aspects like cinematography and directing are also very well handled and only add to the movie's immense quality.At the end of the day, I look at Before Sunrise as an unique film that stands out as a quiet little movie in a time of loud blockbusters, and as much as I love some of those less artistic movies, I know that when I need a little peace, this is the perfect movie for me to invest in.Rating 9,5/10",9,0,0,27 June 2014
Saving Mr. Banks," Made me want to see Mary Poppins
","Not to tread on the movie's qualities, but it actually made me want to see Mary Poppins. The story behind the making of one of the most beloved Disney movies of all time showed how much the books meant to the author and, how deep down, P.L Travers searched for her happy ending. Emma Thompson brings the essence of this complicated character to the screen and manages, in the end, to make us connect with her. I must say that I found the woman to be quite obnoxious at first, and while it did take quite a long time, I eventually found myself rooting for her. Tom Hanks just won me over with his portrayal of Walt Disney, a man that with an empire that wants to add another jewel, yet a one with a certain significance to his family, namely his daughters. To Disney, making Mary Poppins is a promise he must keep, and he will stop at nothing to persuade Pamela to sign the rights and stick with the project. Having watched the movie I know understand the title, as it resonates with the most important person in Travers's life: her alcoholic yet caring father which is played superbly by Colin Farrell. In the end, the movie comes down to letting go of something personal and refusing to see it generalized as a light cartoon. I supported Traver's cause and after all the problems that precede it, all I wanted to do was see Mary Poppins come to life.Rating 7/10",7,0,1,26 January 2014
Star Wars: Episode VII - The Force Awakens," Delivered in every way
","I wanna start by saying that I'm not the biggest Star Wars fan, even though I do enjoy some of the movies more than others. I believe the original trilogy to be a fine series of films and the prequels to be terrible at times but with some good things accomplished at times. Nonetheless, from everything I had seen from the previews for this film, I was definitely anticipating it a lot and I can definitely say that it was quite a birthday present watching this on opening day. The Force Awakens was entertaining, it set up new characters terrificly and brought back the beloved heroes of the first three movies in a respectable way.With this new installment, we follow Rey (Ridley) a scavenger that has her life changed when a droid named BB-8 has an important message for a resistance fighting what rose from the fall of the Galactic Empire, the First Order. She must now deliver this message with the help of Finn (Boyega), a storm trooper that has managed to escape the First Order and Han Solo. With the First Order we will get a new villain in Kylo Ren, a Sith in training shrouded with mystery, and could ultimately play a big part in these character's lives.For me, the franchise is now in great hands as Daisy Ridley and John Boyega were wonderful in their roles and could very well be the big heroes for this new generation that Luke, Han & Leia were for the first viewers of this saga. I thought Abrams held his own in the directing department and delivered a quite competent job. The effects were on point and the movie as a whole was a fantastic piece of entertainment.As far as I'm concerned, this movie brings back Star Wars in a big way. It's not a perfect movie by any means, but its definitely quite a experience and I can see only very nit picky people not enjoying it. Having said that, I hope you really enjoy the experience like I did, if you do choose to watch it. and may The Force be with you.Rating: 9/10",8,7,27,20 December 2015
Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows: Part 2," Fitting Conclusion To One Of My Most Beloved Sagas
","After watching Part 1, I had great expectations about this movie. There is just something about the Harry Potter world that fascinates me and had captivated my imagination for 10 years. So in this chapter we reach the climax of a battle that had been building up to this boiling point. It's finally come down to Harry vs Voldemort. First of all the characters make this movie and the entire saga legendary, as they all have their remarkable characteristics and personal conflicts. Therefore kudos to these exciting characters and especially Severus Snape (You'll See Why). Secondly, the entire work and effort put into bringing this fantastic tale to life, ranging from production to direction. It all flows perfectly.So what to say, except to thank everyone behind this project for the amazing ride they gave us and be happy for the outcome of our ''friends''. Harry,Ron and Hermione we wish you all the best of luck in your lives",9,0,1,8 July 2013
Unbroken," The endurance and resistance of one man
","Unbroken, based off the book of the same name, tells the incredible true life story of Louie Zamperini, a man whose determination and strong fiber helped cement him among historic Americans. In only her second directorial effort, Angelina Jolie presents us with her vision of this man's struggle, as the movie will mainly focus on his time during the war, with some initial flashbacks showcasing his trajectory to the Olympics (another important aspect of his life). Overall I felt the dramatic effect of the movie delivered. Jolie's direction highlights feats of inner strenght and resistance as Louis takes everything that is thrown at him. Whilst familiar, the script does adapt well to this individual and personal journey. It features some of the clichÃ©s used in this type of film, yet with some solid acting, it just about pulls it off. I guess I would say that this movie was acceptable in filmmaking terms. With nothing particularly innovative about it, Unbroken succeeds in connecting you with the protagonist, someone who you root for right from the very start, something that the lead actor has a hand in as well. I personally would have liked a more linear plot, but in the end it doesn't take anything away from the movie. It's quite clear that the film's most redeemable quality is its incredible accessible character and if you wanna find out how he survived the ordeal, then I believe you'll enjoy this movie.Rating: 7,5-8/10",7,0,1,22 May 2015
The Purge," Suspenseful and genuinely scary
","When I heard that the concept of The Purge was basically 12 hours of legality for all the horrible crimes that plague society I was immediately intrigued by the movie and with leads such as Ethan Hawke and Lena Headey, I was sure the movie would be well acted and entertaining. I have to say I was not disappointed and while I would have also liked to see a movie about the questions this theory raises, I didn't mind the path the movie chose as it played out well as a horror movie.So the story focuses on one particular family during The Purge. A family that, due to their economic status, can afford to protect themselves from the dangers of the night. But after the young son lets a wounded victim inside their house, chaos will ensure, as blood will be shared and the family's believe in the cleansing that is the Purge will be tested. Having also made Before Midnight last year, it was hard for Hawke to top his performance there, but he pulls off a great turn as the leader of the Sandin family and with a strong performance by Lena Headey and decent secondary performances, the acting is generally acceptable. While the rest of the movie is okay in terms of the crew's functions, it's the whole mood of the film that makes it feel very eerie and darkly mysterious.At the end of the day, The Purge is a suspenseful and entertaining way to spend 85 minutes. As far as the ethics of it all goes, I guess we'll just have to wait until a more serious filmmaker takes this story into account and makes a thoughtful and engaging movie about it.Rating: 8/10",8,0,0,8 June 2014
Godzilla," Terrific experience
","I must say, I was surprisingly entertained by Godzilla. Even though I don't usually love monster movies, this one kept me hooked even after a somewhat normal 20 minutes. From then on, I really got into it and ended up having a wonderful time. It comes to me as a surprise why so many people disliked it, but I guess to which his own.While there are some subplots, the main focus of the film is on Aaron Taylor Johnson's character Ford Brody, as he will be brought up against all sorts of chaos stirred up by the monsters. As for the title character itself, he will act more like an anti-hero, serving as an assistance against the true baddies the MUTO's. I personally didn't hate the main story line, even though it wasn't the most interesting thing ever. It was at most okay, not terrible. Getting to the good stuff however, the movie lives up to its summer blockbuster status as it offers great action sequences that don't give you too much at once, but rather a visual treat of destruction.Maybe it will become a guilty pleasure of mine, but for now I firmly state that this movie was ,quite frankly, awesome. Sure the story isn't the most engaging, yet for me it was a great background for what I wanted to see and that was the spectacular effects and fights. If that's your thing, then I strongly recommend it.Rating: 8,5/10",8,2,4,21 May 2015
Kingsman: The Secret Service," A spy action film like no other
","The thing about Kingsman is that this movie mixtures genres unlike any movie I've seen. With the Bond influence ever present and the crazy Tarantino-esque violence that was also present in Vaughn's previous movie Kick-Ass, this movie not only pays respect to the old spy films, but also comes into it's own to become a classic for the next years in my opinion.The movie begins with Firth's Harry Hart visiting the family of a fallen partner and he leaves the door open for any help to the son of said partner. Fast forward 17 years later and things aren't going too smoothly for young Eggsy. He is constantly in trouble and has to deal with his mother's boyfriend bad treatment. Luckily for him, he will be chosen as a recruit by his dad's old friend and therefore be a candidate for the secret organization known as the Kingsman. Yet an imminent threat will come to light, as billionaire Valentine will look to eradicate the human race. Will Eggsy be up to the task and manage to save the world?Unapologetic fun is what you're gonna get with Kingsman. Its R rating suggests a lot of violence and the movie delivers with some of the best action sequences of the year. Vaughn really shows off his talents as a director with the camera always moving but capturing every single important moment. Truly a great directorial effort yet again from the British man. The acting is also phenomenal as Firth pulls off an unlikely role, Egerton emerges as a rising star and Jackson makes for a fun villain. I gotta say though that Gazelle was my favorite character with a number of kick-ass moments.Thoroughly entertaining with a great artistic touch, Kingsman is a refreshing take on the spy genre as it plays with the changes that have occurred over time and with Spectre coming out later down the line, I don't see any reason why we can't have different variations of the genre succeeding. I for one welcome it.",8,2,7,18 June 2015
Fast Five," Fast Five: The Big Climax Of The Franchise
","Without a shadow of a doubt, The Fast And Furious Franchise reaches it's peak in this installment with breathtaking action and a sense of friendship and brotherhood shared by the lead characters. Vin Diesel and Paul Walker return and are joined by newcomer Dwayne Johnsson for the 5th Fast and Furious Movie, entitled ''Fast Five''. There's not much to say about this, the action movie of the year, except it's fantastic shots of Brazil, the heist plot that brings even more excitem«ent to the table and overall the continuation of the story of these characters we have come to love and support, as their bond streghtens over time.In Conclusion, if you love the franchise then you can't miss it9/10",9,15,19,26 August 2013
Inside Llewyn Davis," What to do when all meaning is gone
","Inside Llewyn Davis is a rich work of art, be that in cinema or in music. The title character is a man filled with remorse and emptiness, who after the suicide of his partner drifts around looking to basically survive and live off the music he makes. All throughout the movie he will interact with people he knows and even travel to Chicago. This story invites you into the life of someone who seems to be going through life without any sense of purpose. He assumes music as his way of being, folk music to be exact, and all he does ends up being connected with the songs he does and also his presence in the whole business. Personally I rooted for this folk singer despite his flaws and wrong decisions that after all just makes him more human.I am usually not a fan of the Coens and their feature films. The only other movie I can say I've loved from them is No Country For Old Men, and that one was from a different perspective. I'll admit that I haven't seen Fargo. but still they fail to capture my fullest attention. Given its musical nature, Inside Llewyn Davis nails the mark on the songwriting and composing point. The commitment the filmmakers had on perfecting every single detail is something I very much appreciate. The performances are quite good and Oscar Isaac handles the responsibility of leading the movie quite splendidly. With some eerily beautiful cinematography and a inquisitive script, Inside Llewyn Davis is one of those rare movies that leave you asking questions but on a positive note. Definitely a must-seeRating 8/10",8,0,0,11 February 2014
Her," Her is the most unique film to come out in years
","Mind blowing is how I classify the experience of watching 'Her'. In a society that grows more and more attached to technology and everyone seems to shut out real human connections, Her emerges as a movie that allows for a genuine link between our protagonist and his operating system and all the while manages to balance out the feeling of being human. Joaquin Phoenix gives one of the best performances of the year as he plays a man driven by his lonely nature. Having drifted way from his wife, he seems to have trouble letting go and therefore postpones the divorce settlement. When he purchases a new operating system he will be taken on a journey of self introspection and the search for the overall purpose of living, with its many perfections and imperfections. I believe Scarlett Johansson should have been more of a constant presence in the awards shows. Samantha is essentially a voice, yet you feel so much just from the way she talks. She is a conscience, just not a physical one. Among supporting roles, Amy Adams is also worth a mention with a very deep heartfelt turn. With a fresh and original script combined with fantastic directing. Her is magnificence incarnate and a must see for anyone respectful of top notch cinema.Rating 8,5/10",9,0,1,16 February 2014
Born on the Fourth of July," Cruise's greatest performance
","Born On The 4th Of July is the movie in which Tom Cruise gave the best performance of his career. Emotionally disturbed, Ron Kovic is a character which you invest fully in and have trouble watching him go through hell during his life. In the end, though he manages to pull through and rise back up. The movie starts with him growing up in a small town during the 1950's and 60's, in which he learns the values of the time. As the Vietnam war approaches, he enlists in the marines believing this to be his duty as an American. But soon after he his crippled by the enemy, Ron will return to a home changed by the effects of the war he was fighting, creating a conflict between everything he believed in and the wave of dis contempt that rages on around him. Despite it's heavily talked about context, let's not forget that this is a story about one individual and how reacted to these events. Ron Kovic was a man that descended to the bottom and within him found the strenght necessary to reclaim his lost dignity. On the filmmaking side of things, Oliver Stone once again delivers his intense directing style and with the usual sharp editing, a riveting script and another classic score from John Williams, the movie is technically brilliant. The divisive story is, for me, an inspirational one and I find it sad that some people don't see this because of their political views.Rating 8,5/10",8,0,7,3 June 2014
Back to the Future," Time traveling was never the same
","Sure one might argue that this movie does have some discrepancies in the time-line, still what makes most of us forget this, is the wonderful story being told on screen, which is why I believe many people, including myself, fell in love with this movie. Starring the newest star on the block back then, Back To The Future is a thrill ride that will surely entertain you, and for me part of the success of the film was due to wonderful dynamic acting by Michael J. Fox. When you add in Christopher Lloyd, Lea Thompson and many others who put up great supporting roles, as well as a delightful (despite its plot holes) script, then this a must-see movie.The movie's narrative focuses on a young boy named Marty McFly, who having traveled back in time to 1955, in his friend Doc Brown's time machine, has to fix his parents with each other in order to assure his existence. Factor in a comedic side to the story with his mom feeling attracted to him and a more dramatic side with Marty struggling to tell 1955 Doc that he dies in 1985, just before Marty traveled to 1955, and I would say the story is balanced. Just like Jurassic Park would put dinosaurs in the midst of popularity in 1993, I believe time traveling was a hot topic among those who watched and enjoyed the movie in 1985. It's that kind of reaction that I think creates a classic movie.It might not be the most perfect film, however Back To The Future is blockbuster royalty and an audience favorite. It pleases with its light comedy and might even cause a few tears here and there. Bottom line: I don't think I'll ever stop loving this movie.Rating: 10/10",10,1,1,15 August 2014
The Great Gatsby," Fitzgerald's masterpiece shown in lavish Luhrmann style
","Having known that The Great Gatsby was going to be adapted yet again to cinema and that Leonardo DiCaprio was going to star as the lead, I immediately felt obliged to read the novel by Scott Fitzgerald. It was definitely worth the read and then I found myself even more excited to watch it. When I finally got the chance I got the feeling that most of the essence of the original story was brought to the screen. As for the other aspects, and some people actually had problems with this, they combined to give us the entertainment that movies are supposed to provide. Ranging from the modern day soundtrack to the computerized shots of 1920's New York, everything fell into place to give us a thrilling ride. I like to think that the music and the extravagant production provide a comparison as to how the parties of Gatsby and overall the fun spirit of the 20's would be like today.DiCaprio proves once again that he is one of the best actors working today and the intense feelings he brings to Gatsby are a joy to watch. Carey Mulligan makes for a sweet Daisy and serves well as the object of Gatsby's desires. Tobey Maguire is competent as Nick Carroway, the narrator of the story. He is taken in by this world and leaves it disgusted. Joel Edgerton plays a despicable Tom Buchanan who you hate more and more as the movie progresses. The overall tone of the film just grabbed me and never let go. I enjoyed seeing this lavish production, I enjoyed watching these performances, and yes I even enjoyed the music.My perception of the film may differ from more older audience members. In my opinion most of the heart and soul of the book was captured, and that combined with all the over the top scenes and electronic based music was all I needed to enjoy it. I recommend it to anyone looking to see this classic story come to live in a more modern setting.Rating 8/10",8,0,4,11 February 2014
Warm Bodies," Quality zombie entertainment
","Warm Bodies seems like something fresh and peculiar when compared to movies released nowadays. Sure some aspects are more than overdone by Hollywood on a regular basis. What makes this movie stand out among the others is the fact that it was carefully made and everything about it fell into place. Our lead character is someone that will get you off on the right foot with the story that is going to be told. He is funny, interrogative and sort of fits in with his kind, but seems to wanna break free. When he meets Julie, a human girl sent out to get supplies, he senses a need to protect her and therefore takes her home. From then on he will change as he spends time with her and begins to bond. This change will progress from R (the boy's name) to the other zombies, as they begin to feel and dream like they hadn't in years. Despite these good news, danger is present when the bonies (zombies reduced to deadly skeletons) become aware of what's happening and both the humans, led by Julie's father, and the evolving corpses face extinction. Not too long, the movie manages to entertain with competent acting that makes you root for the characters. The fine directing helps as well as it is quite compatible with the smart script, based on the novel. Warm Bodies is a good movie experience for people who not only appreciate this genre but also enjoy logical romances filled with thrills.Rating 7/10",7,0,0,3 February 2014
Jurassic Park," A special movie
","Jurassic Park is to many, a special movie, since it is in fact the pinnacle of the cinema going experience. Great action and sense of wonderment make this one of the most celebrated blockbusters of all time and with good reason. The effects were top of the art for their time and the movie proved to be a trailblazer for the CGI style of filmmaking. While it doesn't give us a completely groundbreaking story with a great deal of complex characters, it's still entertaining enough to make you root for the people in peril. Plus, charismatic actors like Sam Neill and Jeff Goldblum offer a few laughs here and there to balance the mood. For me, Jurassic Park will always be a special movie, as it is to the majority who've watched it. The way everything comes together to give us a near perfect package is the reason I love movies and why names like Steven Spielberg and John Williams inspire me. Hopefully Jurassic World will give me back this happy, careless feeling that the the other sequels took away.Rating: 9/10",8,2,3,22 June 2015
Furious 7," For Paul. The family will miss you
","Ever since Paul Walker's untimely death in 2013, this movie has been hailed as his ultimate homage. I'm pleased to write that not only does this movie continue the trend of great F&F movies started by Fast Five, but it also honors the late actor who had been a big part of the franchise for many years.So we are brought into the movie with a return to race wars, a place we haven't seen since the first one. Dom is attempting to get Letty's memory fully restored and hopes this will be the trigger she needs. This will be one of the movies plot points, But focusing on the main plot, after Owen Shaw was incapacitated in the last movie, his older brother Deckard Shaw (Statham) will look to exact revenge on those hurt his sibling. Also coming into play is a international spy plot involving a highly innovative tracking system that could be dangerous in the hands of mercenaries. The thing right now with the Fast And Furious movies is that you can mix the cars with the most crazy of plots and it works. Scenes like the crew jumping out of a plane in their cars, Toretto driving a car through 3 towers in Abu Dhabi and more are now a part of this wild series of movies. They embrace their silliness and if you're willing to shut down your brain for a moment, you will be in for another exhilarating ride (no pun intended)Furious 7 also acts as Paul Walker's final film to this world and it couldn't have played out better. Brian O'Connor will now enjoy his family life until we see him again.Rating: 9,5/10",9,1,3,15 May 2015
