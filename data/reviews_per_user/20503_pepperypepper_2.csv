Resident Evil: Afterlife," Best Resident Evil so far!
","I was very happy when I went to see this today with my friend. This resident evil has paid a lot of attention to the Resident Evil 5 game. I would say through out the series each new title to it is better than the previous. The scenes are great, the story is brilliant and really keeps you on edge to know what's going to happen. I am rating this 10/10 because of the fact how true they have stuck to the franchise with this film. The soundtrack is truly something to listen out for and the action scenes are brilliant. The ending leaves another massive opening for a 5th title. If you haven't seen it yet, pay close attention to the 'tunnel scene' towards the end. You will see what I mean. I recommend this for any Zombie fans out their!:)",10,21,45,15 September 2010
Pineapple Express," James Franco & Seth really make this film a hit
","This film is just amazing, heck yes its is a bit unrealistic on how many times Red got shot.James franco plays a great part, he was just amazing i actually have to say he acted much better than he did in spiderman 1,2 & 3. He constantly kept me interested and just didn't want the film to end, i wish i could be his BFF haha!.Seth rogen always plays Key in films and i have to say his role in this was much better than Superbad and Knocked up he really did make the LOL's. I recommend this film and don't listen to the negative reviews because there just superbad fanboys.",10,3,7,18 October 2009
