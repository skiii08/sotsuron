The Ring," Great Movie
","I am not so impressed with the new horror movies coming out these days, but for this one, I was very impressed about how good it was. I don't usually go to the movies to see the new horror movies coming out. The reason why I saw this is because my aunt made me watch it telling me and persuading me that I would definitely like it.  The beginning was really scary to me, but the end was scarier. The movie did move a little slow but it was interesting because the whole time you are wondering what is the cause of what is happening and the ending all explains it.",Null,1,1,24 July 2003
The Exorcist," So scary, sometimes I want to sleep with mommie!
","I am 19, and I have been watching this one since I was at least 6 years old.  Believe me , it still scares the **** out of me and I still choose to sit up there and watch it over and over and over again and again and again. It is soooooooooooooo scary how a little 12 year old girl who was possessed knew every thing that was going on even though she stayed in the bed tied up the whole damn time.  Think about how she knew about Father Karras's mother so much.  Even though she was tied up, if you didn't notice she got up when she wanted to at times.  I heard from an older person in their fifties, that when this movie first came out in the 70s, the movie was sold out left and right, and people were coming out the theatres passing out and throwing up. Most  People think that the true story that William Peter Blatty based this movie on happened in Georgetown D.C., but it didn't.  It happened to a 13 year old Mt-Rainer, Maryland boy years ago which is not too too far at all from where I live.  Isn't that scary as hell?  Sometimes after watching this movie, I walk around my house and I get so scared that sometimes I think I can here Reagan screaming even when I go to sleep at night!",10,0,1,6 June 2001
The Butterfly Effect," Good movie
",This movie was not boring at all.  It was very different from most horror and it was interesting.  I could afford to go see it for the second time since it was good and watchable.  I will buy this movie on DVD once it comes out.,Null,0,0,3 February 2004
