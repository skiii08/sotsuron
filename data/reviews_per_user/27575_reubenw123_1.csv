It," An OK film with a nice moral. Full of cheap scares.
","As horror films go it is alright. The plot is loosely attached to the book - don't expect too much. The scares are cheap and are seen in hundreds of other horror films. If your looking for a good, phycological thriller/horror that is actually well-written: watch Get Out.",6,0,1,28 December 2019
