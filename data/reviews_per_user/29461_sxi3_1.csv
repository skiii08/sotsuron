First Man," Magnificent cinematography, not your average blockbuster.
","This movie is a intense portrait of Armstrong, his family, close friends and colleagues. The difficulties an introvert astronaut as Armstrong was has to deal with. The cinematography is breathtaking and the colors of the (Imax) Kodak 35mm and 16mm film really do help intensify the feeling of the 60's. The constant use of (extreme) close-ups makes the viewer almost claustrophobic, and reflects the feeling of sitting in a spaceshuttle and/or being really drawn into work and emotions. The lighting and art-direction was also really well done. This movie is about the emotional storyline of Armstrong and not an average patriotic blockbuster or informative documentary. I read people comparing it to the simple and utterly unrealistic movie like 'The Martian'. Where so much happened in the first 5 minutes of screentime a complete movie could have been made out of it. I wouldn't even dare using these two movies in the same sentence. 'First Man' is a really great movie that done things right up to the very detail.",8,0,1,20 October 2018
