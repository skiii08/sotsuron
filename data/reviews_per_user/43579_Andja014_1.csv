Blade Runner 2049," Visually and audibly superb, point missed
","It really reminds you at times. Sounds, landscape, the whole concept of interrupting the dynamic with passive scene and well known music, the view of futuristic Los Angeles, holographic advertisement, japanese letters, millions of lights and reflectors on a giant building, vibrations and, of course, slowly floating flying car and the sight of a driver. Then you really feel it. And it's good that there are similarities and parallels: Mariette and Pris, that are almost the same person (almost), the eye opening at the beginning, telling the machine to zoom in the picture, the bizarre kiss of a creature and the creator et cetera - without all this this movie really shouldn't be called the sequel of the masterpiece from 1982.
However, although it's visually and audibly superb, it misses the point. Blade Runner is a story about humanity, dark and bizarre and beautiful. It poses so many questions. Stays unsolved. Unexplained. Abiguous. Blade Runner 2049 simplifies that whole concept. It states one problem and bases the whole fabula on it. The difference between humans and replicants in 2049 is biological, while the accent in the original is on empathy, on soul (read humanity). Give machine the ability to conclude, feel, the desire to live and it won't essentially be any different from a human being. Technology is the one that improves, replicant bodies are the ones that get perfected. Virus particles created by men reproduce by themselves. It's just the matter of time and technological progress when replicants will be albe to reproduce too. 
Biological predispositions are what makes us human beings. But savvy, emotions, empathy, soul - are what make us men and women, humane.
Blade Runner states that. Today, robot looks like a metal device, composed of cables and chips. Robot in Blade Runner looks like a human, made of organs and is identical in physical sense, but it has expiration date and doesn't sympathise. Robot in Blade Runner 2049 is brought to perfection, identical to a human, sympathetic, emotional, with normal lifespan and on it's way to be able to reproduce, although being made. Birth isn't something that would suddenly make it different from a human and change the whole concept. In that case, we are no loger talking about robots - but humans. Made, build, created, whatever, humans that, as such, will be able to give birth. And the only reason we aren't accepting that is because it means we are returning to chattel slavery system. Man want's a slave, a slave that's aware of its position and that's able to develop an opinion and feelings about it. Human slave. But man doesn't want to admit it.
This movie, techically, is fantastically done, but it lacks depth in fabula that the orignial one had. It also lacks complex and impressible characters whit whom the watcher can make an emotional bond.",7,0,1,24 January 2018
