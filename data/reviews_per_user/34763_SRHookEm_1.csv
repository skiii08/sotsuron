Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," The Best Part
","The best thing about this movie was watching it with my 6 year old son. Who cares how it developed characters or set-up a sense of urgency. When I saw Star Wars as a 10 year old, I left the theater just as my son left today---in awe and a fan for life!Oh yes, I left that way today too!",Null,0,0,22 May 1999
