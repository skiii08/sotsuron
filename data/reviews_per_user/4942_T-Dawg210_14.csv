The Hunger Games: Mockingjay - Part 1," 'The Revolution will be 'On Air!''
","The much anticipated, The Hunger Games: Mockingjay Part 1, was finally released in theaters on November 2014! Unlike its previous series, this movie is set outside the arena. The film managed to vividly deliver the exciting settings and frequent tense moments to the audience. Katniss (Jennifer Lawrence) is in District 13 under the leadership of President Coin as she tries to form a revolution against the Capitol. Even though the movie is divided into two parts, with the Mockingjay Part 1 being the first of the two, it managed to keep the audience's interest. Leading up to a big finale, the plot is exhilarating and builds up suspense.74/100",8,1,3,9 December 2015
The Maze Runner," 'Get Ready to feel the Intensity!'
","The lights shine down as Thomas (Dylan O' Brien), a teenager arrives into the grassy, pastoral area known as the 'Glade.' Within the 'Glade,' there are others waiting for his arrival, yet no one knows where they are, who they are and how they got there. Hence, they join forces with other 'runners' for a shot at escape. These days, we see many famous novels being made into a movie. Director Wes Ball did an 'a-maz-ing' (pun intended) job of vividly presenting the plot! The movie indeed captivates the audience with numerous exhilarating scenes. Sci- Fi/Thriller fans should not miss their chance to check this movie out!80.5/100",8,0,0,9 December 2015
Interstellar," 'Christopher Nolan's grand sci-fi film'
","Christopher Nolan's epic, blockbuster movie, Interstellar, deserves to be seen on the biggest screen with the best sound system. Nolan's ambitious desire to portray the mind-blowing concept of time and space in his movie is praiseworthy. The story line is spectacular, the embodiment of the universe is surreal, and the acting of the cast is stirring.The staggering visual effects which range from the ocean rising up to form the largest wave imaginable to a spaceship traveling past the rings of Saturn fascinate the audience. If Interstellar is not worth watching in the theaters, I daresay that nothing else is94.5/100",10,1,3,2 November 2015
The Revenant," A well-made beautiful movie
","Finally Leonardo Dicaprio wins an award for Best Actor in Oscars and the Golden Globe Award for best actor. After watching this movie, I realized that this movie had great cinematography. Alejandro González Iñárritu definitely made the visuals of this movie very pleasing for the audience's eyes! Alejandro definitely is a unique director and just like what Dicaprio said, this movie was really one of a kind. This historical/survival/revenge drama was taken place in the Canadian wilderness and according to Alejandro, it was extremely difficult to shoot this film because the cast and crew had been filming it for 6 months. You might wonder why it took so long to finish filming for this movie, but that's because the director decided to use all natural light. No wonder the visuals were beautiful! In addition, I really liked how the director decided to portray the transitions. In most of the scenes, the transitions would just show the mountains, trees, river, etc. and showed nature's pristine beauty. Also just like Birdman, there was this one particular scene I vividly remember and it was when Dicaprio was trying to hide from the Native Amecans and the camera applied the 180 Degree Rule, and the camera spun around 180 degrees. Instead of going on describing how awesome the visuals are, I also want to talk about the acting. The acting was no doubt really good. Leonardo Dicaprio did well, but Tom Hardy, Will Poulter, and Dohmnall Gleeson's acting was incredible too. You know that the movie is good when everyone's acting is phenomenal.Moreover, Dicaprio doesn't have that much line, but you can feel his emotions through his breathing. As you can tell, this movie is more of a kinesthetic type sort of movie. You can literally feel how Dicaprio felt every time he was gasping for air. It was filled with anger, agony, and sadness. It was painful to watch because the acting felt so realistic. Even at one point, the camera lens were filled with Dicaprio's mouth mist, which I thought was really cool.The movie was gory, but it felt different compared to Saw and other thriller-gory movies. One of the most memorable scene was the bear scene. Dicaprio gets brutally attacked by a bear and gets nearly killed. They show all the scratch and bite marks and it looks so painful. In addition, there was this scene when Dicaprio drinks water and the water leaks out of his throat. Finally, the most mind- blowing scene was when he opens up the horse's stomach and takes out the premature horse babies and goes inside the horse in order to not freeze to death. (Literally OMG) During the movie, Dicaprio would sometimes see a vision of his dead wife and son and at the end, it was really sad because after Dicaprio accomplishes his revenge by letting Tom Hardy die, now he has nothing to hold on to because he has accomplished his mission. So in the final scene, the wife looks at Dicaprio and turns away... :(Anyways I think the director and actors did well and even though the plot is simple, this is more of a feel-type movie. 94.5/100 (A)",9,1,2,23 March 2016
The Shining," 'Creepy as hell!'
","The movie The Shining is a psychological horror film directed by Stanley Kubrick. This movie is definitely one of the most scariest horror movies of all times! The eerie music always made me tense during the film. Nowadays, there are some good horror movies, but most of them are jump scares and the chills don't last that long. However, this movie gave me so much chills and freaked me out throughout the movie and even after the movie! Jack Nicholson did a great job acting as Jack Torrace and I was especially impressed with Kubrick's determination. Apparently, he made Jack Nicholson do method acting which was why his acting was outstanding! Another interesting fact was that the kid didn't know that this was a horror movie until he was 17! Finally, there was this one scene where an elevator door opened and blood flooded the entire set. And according to an article from MoviePilot, that blood was actually real blood and it took 6 months to completely clean up the set!Overall, this movie was eerie and I recommend this movie for people who are obsessed with horror.96/100",10,5,7,9 December 2015
Gone Girl," Wow!
","Gone Girl was definitely a A+ rated movie and it was my TOP3 favorite movie from 2014! Rosamund Pike's acting was phenomenal, which was probably why she was nominated for the golden globe award. Also to be honest I didn't really like her before but after watching this movie, I think she deserved to win the golden globe award instead of Julianne Moore. Anyways, this movie was based on the novel Gone Girl, and nowadays we see a lot of movie based on a novel and usually it's not as good as the book. However, David Fincher did a intricate and richly satisfying adaptation from the book. I've never read the book, but still the movie gave me chills! Gone Girl is a psychological thriller movie and my favorite genre are thriller movies which is why I absolutely loved it. I know I keep on reiterating things but you guys should watch it! What I am impressed about this movie was that everyone's acting was really smooth and absolutely flawless. Ben Affleck's acting is usually composed, calm, and in a way a bit boring. But I think his acting suited the character especially in this movie. Neil Patrick Harris and Tyler Perry also did a fine job as well. But I was most impressed with Rosamund Pike. In the movie, she was kind of the smart, self-centered bitch who is actually a freaking sociopath! two words to describe her acting would probably be 'DAMN Girl!'Finally, before I say that this movie is good and all, the movie may be dull at the beginning, but it gets better throughout the end, so don't give up while watching this film!! 98/100",10,0,3,9 December 2015
The Secret Life of Walter Mitty," 'The Secret Life of Walter Mitty Movie: Unique and Special
","'To see the world, things dangerous to come to, to see behind walls, draw closer, to find each other and to feel. That is the purpose of life.' - Â© 2013 Secret Life of Walter Mitty MovieThe Secret Life of Walter Mitty is a movie that gets you moving on your feet. The movie teaches us a very essential lesson that just dreaming won't allow your life to succeed. But one should always try to start living rather than just dreaming, and that experiences are essential in achieving one's dream. Furthermore, it grabs the audience's attention with funny imaginations. During the movie, Walter starts zoning out and falling into bright daydreams multiple times. One time, he becomes a hero by saving residents from a burning building; in another, he fights with his boss in a very dramatic action movie like way. The overall ambiance of the film was peculiar, yet special. To illustrate, inspirational quotes popped up and kept you thinking deeply throughout the movie. Personally, I really liked the movie because it seemed very sincere. Nowadays, its hard to find a movie that is sincere. But it wasn't boring. The Secret Life of Walter Mitty is funny, but it also isn't a comedy either. It's complicated to put this movie into a particular genre. In a way, its kind of vague but exclusive. Therefore, I would say that The Secret Life of Walter Mitty is my all-time favorite movie! :D100/100",10,1,1,2 November 2015

The Imitation Game," Movie: The Imitation Game
","Based on a true story of Alan Turing, Morten Tyldum's Oscar-nominated movie The Imitation Game, depicted Turing's life during World War II as Alan Turing tried to crack the enigma code with the help from fellow mathematicians. The Imitation Game was vibrant and lively, engaging its audiences on three levels: The fascinating way the Nazis managed to outsmart the rest of the world until Turing came along, how his giant computer worked, and what happened to him in the end, when the truth about him was finally revealed. However, the movie had been criticized for inaccuracy, and historians claimed that Turing wasn't a socially awkward, fragile man as depicted in the movie, but rather a brave and courageous man. But still, I enjoyed the movie because it held the interest of the audience through several dramatic qualities. The lead actor and actress Benedict Cumberbatch, and Keira Knightley, did a fine job, even though he was perhaps too well fixed in the minds of the audience now as another peculiar genius, Sherlock Holmes. 87/100",9,1,2,9 December 2015
Sinister," A well-made horror movie: Sinister
","When I first saw the movie cover, I wasn't really expecting much from this movie. But one of my friend kept on begging me to watch this movie so I decided to give it a try. Thankfully, I watched this movie and it was worth it!From the producers of Paranormal Activity and Insidious comes a well-made horror movie! A dedicated true-crime writer Ellison Oswalt is trying to write a new crime story and decides to move into a new house in order to write a new successful novel. However, he finds a box of videos and things start to become dark and sinister...Sinister has lots of jump scares that make you jump out of your seat and there is also a little bit of a twist at the end. One thing I really regret is that I watched this movie by myself, which I shouldn't have done!Finally, I would like to say that I really enjoyed the storyline as well.88/100",9,2,4,9 December 2015
The Shape of Water," Great Film that emphasizes the importance of communication and fear of 'others.'
","The Shape of Water-A Wonderful Adult Fairy Tale Movie about CommunicationEver since visiting the lakes, going fishing, and watching the Disney movie Atlantis, I've always had an obsession with the underwater world and believed that other human-like creatures were lurking beneath the oceans. So, before watching Guillermo Del Toro's The Shape of Water (2017), I was initially excited for this film, and after watching it, I was genuinely impressed with the cinematography, visuals, and theme. The Shape of Water (2017) stylishly tells the story of a classic monster-adult fairy tale and fuses with old Hollywood musical, making it a fascinating experience. Furthermore, with exceptional cinematography and visuals, this film has a great message about the importance of communication and shows it through the excellent development of the characters and narrative. The movie shows us Elisa (Sally Hawkins), who is a mute woman that works as a nighttime janitor in a research facility center. She doesn't have many friends, except her African-American co-worker friend Zelda Fuller (Octavia Spencer) who spends most of the time talking, and her close neighbor, who is a closeted gay man called Giles (Richard Jenkins). One day, as Elisa is working, the facility center brings an amphibious creature that lives underwater. Intrigued by the creature, Elisa secretly tries to get closer to him by bringing eggs, playing musicals, and teaching him to sign language. Eventually, these two get closer, but Elisa's superior Strickland wants to dissect the creature for study purposes and to avoid the Russians to get more information as well. In Del Toro's movies, many of his films have great visuals, and with The Shape of Water (2017), the director carefully uses colors to evoke the character's state of mind. The turquoise and teal colored background were used through the entire period to evoke the sense of bleakness and loneliness. All the characters, despite generally having a happy life have some sort of emptiness in their lives and Del Toro wanted to show it through the screen vividly. And so, when the use of color red appears, it is used in controlled situations to show passion and delight in Elisa, making it easier to establish the overall mood. As for the performance, all the characters including the supporting roles had great depth. The most astonishing feature of the film's vision was that the story was delivered from a voiceless woman, a gay artist, and a black woman, all sharing some problems regarding communication. In particular, Sally Hawkins undoubtedly outshines the rest of the characters as she only uses her body to communicate with others, making it both humorous, powerful, and truly magical. Additionally, Spencer and Jenkins elevate the arc of the story while Shannon as Strickland is genuinely a horrific villain. Because the creature is an outsider, naturally, Elisa, Zelda, and Giles who are also social pariahs see the amphibious creature as something magnificent while Strickland sees him as 'ugly as sin.' These direct contrasts show how the importance of communication is demonstrated through the character's situations. Questions such as what happens when we are taken away the ability to communicate with others or who gets to decide who talks are all emphasized throughout the film. In a way, because the characters are social minorities, their voices are all suppressed. Elisa cannot verbally communicate, so she gets help from her close friends Zelda and Giles, making her feel marginalized and incomplete. On the other hand, Strickland's position in society allows him to abuse his powers and use communication only to take advantage of his subordinates. Just as the title suggests, the element of water is flexible and adaptable, which illustrates that love can have many different shapes and form. Even though Elisa might not be able to communicate verbally, she still can interact with the creature through sign language and does not have to be judged for who she is. In a way, as she bonds with the being, it is shown that sex can also be a form of communication, one that Elisa eventually does to deepen the relationship with her love. Despite the absence of speech, Elisa uses other methods-especially in the water- to connect and communicate with the creature, making her self-expression fill the void that was empty in her life with someone who will love her just for the way she is.All in all, Del Toro and his cast and crew delivers a compelling film by showcasing unique and imaginative elements of the characters and story. It is no doubt that The Shape of Water (2017) is one of Del Toro's best works. By sticking with the theme of communication, this movie has a relevant message in modern society, and just like water, one can decide what kind of meaning love wants to be.",9,53,105,11 March 2018
Inception," Mind Blown!
","I remember when I first watched this movie in the theaters and I was just really confused. Some people even left the theater because they were confused! All I knew was that a bunch of characters go into a dream into another dream into another dream in order to accomplish their mission. So I had to watch this movie multiple times in order to understand the ending.As usual, Christopher Nolan can sometimes mesmerize the audience with mind- blowing, extravagant ideas such as The Prestige and The Dark Knight series. Likewise, Inception has done the same thing once again! Nolan's exciting sci-fi movie starring Leonardo Dicaprio combines the best of modern filmmaking. Just the thought that other people can 'invade' your dreams is actually pretty terrifying and disturbing. The deeper you go into another dream, the harder it is to wake up into the real world. Christopher Nolan came out with this idea when he was 16 years old! Maybe that is why the film is so detail-oriented and mind-boggling! Inception was extremely exhilarating. One thing that made me and probably many other people confused was its mysterious ending. Will the spinning top keep spinning or was it about to fall over just before the end of the movie? It's up for the audience to decide, but I believe that the spinning top was about to fall. This is because I have watched the movie multiple times and when Leonardo Dicaprio was with his ex-wife, he had a ring on but when he actually saw his kids, there was no ring in his finger. It's just a guess, but I think that is the reason why I believe that Leonardo Dicaprio came back to the real world. What do you think?97/100",9,0,2,9 December 2015
The Cabin in the Woods," Woah! That's creepy...!
","When I first watched this movie, I thought that this was a very typical horror movie, where a group of friends go into a deserted cabin and horrific monsters start to kill each of the friends one by one. There is the typical jock, the slutty girl, the hot athlete, the smart guy, and the virgin. These teenagers are portrayed so generically that you actually kind of want them to die because of their stupidity. But as the story progresses, we find out that they were selected and manipulated by an organization in order to complete a ritual. So as I watch this film, I knew that all the monsters were controlled by this one huge organization, but the thought of that was pretty creepy. And then after I finished watching the movie, I realized that there are a lot of conspiracy theories in this movie. At first I thought this was such a typical horror movie but then I realized that this movie had a deeper meaning, and it's not just a horror movie, but also a mystery movie. Like I've mentioned before, this is because there are a lot of conspiracy theory in this movie. In the movie, they never mention the name of the organization and it appears that the organization is highly sophisticated and dealing with a lot of military tech. In addition, after the death of the first victim, we see one of the workers praying a dark prayer and kissing an ornament. Hmmmm starting to get a little bit freaky. So basically, there is a cult organization which is constantly sacrificing people. It's definitely puzzling and ominous. In the end, there is this huge fiery-hand that comes out from the ground and it grabs the audience and basically the world ends. I thought the ending was definitely something. Then it made me think, whether or not if the protagonists were the real protagonists. Because the jock and the virgin weren't offered as a sacrifice, the world ended. So I realized that it was difficult to decide who the protagonists were. The organization was trying to stop the end of the world, and the two teenage friends were just trying to survive. 80/100",8,0,2,9 December 2015
Furious 7," 'Furious 7 makes cars fly and people cry'
","Finally, the anticipated Furious 7 has been released in theaters! Get ready to experience some next level action, as cars jump out of planes and buildings! Just like the rest of the series, Furious 7 has some action and it's very exciting! But it is also very emotional, and it was genuinely moving at times. As you all know, one of the main actors, Paul Walker died last year in a car crash while in the filming process of this movie. Due to his passing during the production of the movie, his two brothers had to replace him with the help of CGI work. It was extremely devastating for the entire cast and crew. They even had to take a step back to figure out if they could finish it and how. Luckily, director James Wan created an amazing finale that was absolutely beautiful for the character and to Paul Walker's memory. In many ways, this franchise has evolved so much from where they started. They were able to embrace diversity and use that as a strength! My eyes teared up as the music 'See You Again' started playing, not just because it was wonderful, but it brought to me so many memories from the times when Brian O' Conner (Paul Walker) was on screen. Also, the song goes well with the movie because the characters are well known for their gangster style family. Unlike the previous Fast and Furious movie series, you can jump right in even though you've never seen any of the Fast and Furious series. The film opens with an introduction of Deckard Shaw (Jason Statham). He seeks revenge against Domonic Toretto (Vin Diesel) and his family for injuring his brother. That's it. The movie plot is that simple! However, there are a lot of complicated technicalities that the screenwriter throws at the audience. But in the end, the film is driven by the most underlying motivations. The plot is unimportant. Family is everything, and 'Furious 7' is a blast! The movie director of 'Saw' and 'Conjuring', James Wan did a great job in making a confident jump to a big budget action filmmaking. He tries everything to make sure that every scene has a sense of momentum, whether it's just the dialogue or one of those crazy monster action scenes. We are not sure if the next movie will come out, but it will sure feel empty without Paul Walker. 84/100",9,0,4,9 December 2015
