Who Framed Roger Rabbit," A zany film that won't be repeated in this century...
","Yeah. Laugh at me. I have never seen the whole thing through and through until 2008. I'm like 20 years behind? Genius. A world where cartoons and humans coexist. An interspecies murder. One reluctant detective, one dumb Roger Rabbit and his hot wife. Jessica Rabbit....Lord have mercy.But I digress. Who Framed Roger Rabbit fused film noir, hardboiled detectives and homages to old school cartoons. I want to see the contracts that the lawyers made up in order to have all those cartoon characters in there. Cameos galore. I bought the VHS copy for a dollar at my library. They told me that the DVD's had edits on it, and I didn't want that. Censorship for the sake of censorship is not good. You knew the stuff was risky 20 years ago, and now you want to try to rectify the (supposed) mistakes? Get real. It won 4 Oscars and deserved every one of them. I wish they had created a sequel. But this one stands the test of time.",8,0,0,14 July 2008
Cloverfield," Cloverfield has distinct possibilities
","So we got the beginning of the movie saying 'Property of the Government.' Then this kind of drama show begins with a group of Friends clones. It didn't get good until the monster touched down. Then those kids started to run. Run, chumps run! Of course, they acted just like movie characters act in monster/horror movies, not using their heads. Then again, if everyone had sense then there would be no movie. I wish for a sequel because I like the concept of Cloverfield. That monster has a lot of possibilities. He could become American's answer to Godzilla. Picture it. Godzilla vs Cloverfield. I'd buy tickets to see that. The filming the movie with a hand held camera would have been cool in parts, but it was used way too much. One thing that amazed me was how Cloverfield was shot with just 25 million. That's what I call good budgeting and good use of unknowns. I anxiously await the sequel, just without those Friends clones and the hand held cameras.",7,0,0,14 July 2008
Wanted," Excellent piece of action film...
","Wanted(2008)- Jolie, McAvoy and Freeman make awesome assassins. McAvoy plays Wesley Gibson, a cubicle dweller who gets clowned on by everyone, from his boss (who treats him like crap), his girlfriend (who is nailing his best friend) and takes pills for anxiety attacks. In short, a complete wuss. The worse part is that he doesn't even have the sense to fight back. Until Angie Jolie shows up and informs him that his dad just got killed, and that Wesley's dad was one of the most hardcore assassins on earth. Wesley then finds himself caught in the crossfire of a gunfight, kind of like in most anime series.Wesley wants to know more about his dad, so he joins The Fraternity, the assassin group that his old man was part of. Morgan Freeman is at its head, so you know its going to be good. What happens next defies description. What I just said is not really giving away the plot, since you can see this in the trailers.Timur Bekmambetov, a director I never heard of came out of seemingly nowhere and weaved magic. He took bullet time and made it unique again. Bullets fly around objects with reckless abandon, people perform seemingly supernatural feats and everyone looks so cool while doing it. Jolie played the typical hardcore chick with a sensitive side to the tee, and McAvoy plays both a wuss and a killer with equal parts efficiency and gusto. One of the few worthwhile rappers, Common, is in there as well.*comic book spoilers* Wanted is based off of a comic book series, but changed dramatically. I think that some of the changes made in the transition from comic book to film were for the better. In the comic book, Wesley was more of a sick and demented antihero committing disturbing acts with very little accountability (acts disturbing to a person who still has a soul), and the Fraternity was just as wicked as the people they killed. You kind of wonder about the creator of the comic book, and what points he was trying to get across. In the movie the Fraternity plays more of a heroic vigilante role and Wesley becomes a warrior seeking justice for himself and the world. These changes are for the better, in my opinion. If they had filmed Wanted as the comic book was, you would have protests in the streets and an automatic NC-17 rating. There are plot twists that you might see coming, and then again you might not. *end comic book spoilers* In short, what the heck you're waiting for? An invitation? Go see Wanted!",8,3,8,14 July 2008
Hancock," Could have been so much more...
","Will Smith as a superhero. That alone made me plunk down 9 bucks. He's practically homeless and hits the bottle pretty hard. Then when he tries to save the day he winds up messing up the city even worse. Everyone hates his guts. Then he runs into Bateman, a publicist who fixes images. Bateman and Smith butt heads for a while, and Bateman's wife (Theron) swears that Hancock can't change.First of all, I didn't really go off of the critics for this one. Usually superheros are supposed to be so good and noble, a sterling example of what we should be like. Thankfully, the superhero movies in the last few years (Spiderman trilogy, Iron Man, The Incredible Hulk, The Incredibles, Batman Begins) have been exploring the inner turmoil of superheros. Hancock seems to break the mold. Will Smith's character is a mess. He doesn't even try to pretend otherwise. This is a role that you don't usually see in superheros.Second, he's a black superhero. But people don't have issues with him being black, they have issues with Hancock being such a jerk. So it started off good, and touched on some important superhero questions that are rarely dealt with: 1. Who do superheros go to when they have mental issues and drug addictions? 2. Who can really punish and arrest a superhero if he/she breaks the law, especially if there's only one superhero in town? Second, how could you keep a superhero locked up? Could you really count on his/her word that they will stay in prison? What jurisdiction do superheros fall under in a city? Are they like private investigators, reserve police officers, citizens or just outlaws? Then it all went backwards. Hancock is all of a sudden nigh immortal and can't remember squat before 80 years ago. Amnesia rarely works as a worthwhile plot device in movies, people. Remember that. Also immortality kind of places Hancock even further out of touch with the people. Then you have Theron displaying superpowers. Say what? That makes no sense. And the explanation that Theron and Smith get weaker when they are close to each other seemed kind of disjointed. First, the immortality and amnesia hadn't been worked through, and now you throw in a half baked explanation of how all the other heros died off due to wanting true love? Say what? Too many ideas and too little time to flesh them out.Second, there was no main super villain. How are you going to not have a super villain? Or at least the opportunity for a super villain...like have Theron say that there are more people like them in hibernation or in hiding or something like that...Or make Theron out to be the true arch nemesis that wants to move Hancock away because she's wanting to do something diabolical, they fight, Theron loses but vanishes for the time being. That's your second lesson, people. Always leave some room in your film for a sequel.Thirdly, why did Hancock have such average powers? Flight, super strength and invincibility. Hancock had the seeds to be so much more, but bad writing damaged it. Maybe if they do a sequel they can retcon a lot of this nonsense. Or do a reboot like Batman begins or The Incredible Hulk.",6,1,1,14 July 2008
