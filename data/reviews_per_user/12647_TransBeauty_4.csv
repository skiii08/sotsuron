The Incredible Hulk," Great Movie!
","I want to comment on this movie, especially since I just recently saw 'The Happening', which came out at the same time, and commented on that. The difference between them is night and day. 'The Happening' was probably the worst movie I have ever seen, and I rated it a 1..because it was awful. This is an awesome movie! This 'Hulk' movie was way better that the 2003 one, and put that one to shame. I was in awe at some of the scenes, and totally engrossed in the movie from start to finish. It had great special effects that rocked! I love Edward Norton, and he was terrific in this. It also seemed realistic, and felt like that could happen to people, from experiments gone wrong..etc. This was fun, and exciting. This movie was a 10 for sure!",10,14,28,18 June 2008
I Am Legend," So Cool!
","this movie was pretty darn good in my opinion. Its scary, unique, and so real-like. I think it was meant to be a scary and 'helpless' type movie, and it succeeded in that. Its so embracing because it makes you feel like this can really happen. I mean, no matter what people say about this movie, i bet no one looked away for a second..lol The zombies and zombie dogs are so cool looking, super strong, fast, and agile. This gives the 'we are so much in trouble and helpless' feeling, if this happened to us..which makes it frightening. This was a different kind of movie, with great cg, and good story in my opinion. The ending wasn't that bad either *cough*. He was legend for sure though! Its just that the ending comes so fast. Not enough time to put more stuff in to make it longer i guess. I guess if i had to put a microscope on it, it could have had more content and story to the movie itself. Its obvious they didn't have the space to put everything in it though, to make it a perfect movie. A solid 9 though no matter what.",9,3,6,15 December 2007
The Happening," What was the hype about??
","This movie was terrible..lol. I mean, the previews showed the only decent parts, and there weren't any other decent ones. I love Mark Whalberg, but this was his, also MNS' worst movies! They probably paid him big time to do this, because I cant believe a man who is in charge of the amazing 'Entourage' would do this movie. With all that hoopla about the previews, I cant believe that is what i saw. I'm rating it a 1 because first, it was an awful movie, like the 1 rating indicates. And second, it might be a legit 2 or 3, but i have to lower the 6.8 total voting, that it truly isn't! I would rate the previews a 9 or 10, and the movie a 1. I think the big problem that hurt, was making the previews look so good..lol. Lol..I still cant believe it was that terrible *sigh* How did the rating even get to a 6.8 anyway???? Lol. What were these people watching? I thought that a comparable movie, 'The Mist' would be an 8. It was pretty cool, wasn't bad..etc. It had really cool monsters in it..etc. But hindsight, thinking about that movie now, I would rate it a perfect 10 compared to this one. This is so terrible, its probably the worst movie I have ever seen..lol",1,13,43,13 June 2008
Ice Age: Dawn of the Dinosaurs," Ice Age 3 is so perfect!!!!
","I love all the Ice Ages', and the 3rd is my favorite for sure! So, cool, fun, and exciting. Wow..I just saw it today, and I just can't believe how good this movie was! This is way better than UP, and also beats out Wall-E. Cartoon or not, this is in my top 3 for best movies ever! I hope they come out with a 4th too ;) I loved it so much..you have to see it! I feel like Manny, Sid, Diego and the gang are really family members..lol. Its that real, and even for a cartoon. I so love the side scenes of the prehistoric squirrels..lol. Such great imaginantion to put them in there, and in perfect sequence places every time! This movie is way better than any pixar film ever made!! I really cant believe how much i loved this! A 10 for sure!",10,2,7,6 October 2009
