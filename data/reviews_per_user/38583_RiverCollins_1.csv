Requiem for a Dream," Absolute Genius.
","Beautiful, artistic, haunting movie about 4 people whose lives and relationships are destroyed bye their drug addictions. There's so much to think about and so much symbology. Not recommended for people who like to have movies 'spoon-fed' to them. Certainly recommended for people who like more from a movie than just a few laughs or a few scares. Certainly not the sort of movie you forget about.The editing is absolutely beautiful. And note the position each character is lying in for each of their last scenes. I'd love to talk more about the symbology but I don't want to ruin it for people who haven't seen it yet.Excellently acted. Jared Leto is WAY under-rated. Most likely because he's always linked to some no-talent in Hollywood (eg. Lindsay Lohan).Marlon Wayans also showed that he's a terrific actor. It's a shame he doesn't do more movies like this, because he certainly proved to be a very versatile actor. A few more serious movies and the man would've had an Oscar under his belt by now.",10,4,7,11 April 2007
