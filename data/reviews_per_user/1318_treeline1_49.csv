The King's Speech," Even Kings have obstacles to overcome
","The story opens in 1925, as the Duke of York (aka 'Bertie' to his family), played by Colin Firth, is about to give a speech. It's torture for him, as he is shy and is nearly unable to speak because he stammers so badly. Still, he takes some comfort in the fact that he'll never have to be King since he has an older brother, the playboy prince known as 'David.' Bertie's beloved wife Elizabeth (Helena Bonham Carter) engages the services of an elocution therapist and Bertie grudgingly starts classes, but the teacher (Geoffrey Rush) has some unorthodox techniques.This is mostly a very good movie with sympathetic characters and historical significance. Bertie's older brother did become King, but he abdicated, forcing shy Bertie into the job. The film leads up to Bertie's (now King George VI) very important first radio address to the nation after WWII is declared. The era is recreated well and one feels the weight on the King's shoulders as he prepares to address his countrymen, to guide and strengthen them. It's a moving scene as the King manages to deliver the speech nearly flawlessly with the help of his teacher. Rush is bubbly and funny and kind, Carter is loving and supportive, and Firth is every inch a King.The pace was a bit slow at times and I nearly dozed off in the middle. Also, the lighting was a problem; most indoor scenes appeared to be lit by small lamps, leaving half of the faces too pale and the other half in darkness. There are many familiar faces in the cast and all are excellent. Recommended, especially from an historic standpoint.",Null,0,0,4 February 2011
Black Swan," Unpleasant thriller
","Nina (Natalie Portman) is a troubled, young ballerina who lives her life in an endless and hopeless pursuit of perfection. When the company's lecherous director gives her the star role of the Swan Queen, he expects her to put out and be more like the sensuous Black Swan character and less like the demure White Swan. Her deeply conflicted psyche creates a world of illusion, chaos, and terror as she gives in to her dark side.We know early on that Nina has a loose grip on reality and that nothing we see is real. Given the dark storyline, one would expect an exciting movie, but I actually found it predictable. Portman gives a one-note performance, always frightened and helpless but never showing a range of emotions until the very end. There are several violent and sexual scenes intended to show her fragile state of mind, but they are often over-the-top and downright gross. While rail-thin Portman does convince us she's a ballerina and the dance sequences are lovely, the other characters are unlikable and rather stereotypical. Barbara Hershey is repellant as Nina's disturbed mother and sassy Mila Kunis, as Nina's rival, is also fairly loathsome.This psychological thriller is more off-putting than entertaining and frankly, I was glad when it was over.",Null,0,1,5 May 2011
Captain Phillips," Thrilling and unforgettable
","Captain Rich Phillips (Tom Hanks) was taking his American cargo ship on a routine voyage off the coast of Africa, when a small band of armed Somali pirates boarded the ship. While most of the crew stayed hidden, the pirates took Captain Phillips hostage in a lifeboat.This movie, based on a true story, is extremely intense and exciting, so frightening, I don't think I could have watched it on the big screen, but on DVD, it was riveting and enlightening. There isn't any real violence until the very end, but the drama is kept at a unbearable level by the non-stop yelling of the pirates. Their leader is played by Barkhad Abdi in his first acting role. He is outstanding and deserves his nomination for Best Supporting Actor. Tom Hanks delivers a powerful performance, remaining calm and providing a balance to the pirates' hysteria.The script manages to elicit sympathy for the pirates because of their miserable lives; they live in abject poverty, forced to hijack ships by their warlords or die. The movie is excellent and highly recommended.",Null,0,2,22 January 2014
Skyfall," 'What did you expect, an exploding pen?'
","Bond returns after being presumed dead to find MI6 in peril from a man with a (big) grudge against M.Fans of the series won't really care about the plot and its holes; it's all about the explosions, pretty girls, high body count, and 007's cleverness. Daniel Craig's emotional repertoire consists of pursing his lips and squinting his eyes - he's no Sean Connery (who, by the way, would have been great as Bond's trusty, Scottish gamekeeper). We do get much more of Judi Dench as M and she's wonderful. Javier Bardem is good as the crazed villain, but his blond hair keeps him from being truly menacing.My biggest problem was with the plot which is quite narrowly focused on offing M, rather than the traditional 007 storyline of massive weapons of mass destruction aimed squarely at the West. It was okay but didn't have the gravity of some past Bonds where world domination was at stake.The movie delivers nonstop action scenes and that's what James Bond is all about. 7.5 stars.",Null,1,8,4 December 2012
The Young Victoria," 'I will be good.'
","As the story opens, we meet 17-year old Princess Victoria (Emily Blunt), the niece and heir-apparent of her uncle, King William IV. The girl is controlled in every way by her selfish mother (Miranda Richardson) and greedy adviser, Sir John Conroy, but is still spunky and strong-willed. She meets Prince Albert of Saxe-Coburg and Gotha, well-aware that their marriage would be politically advantageous and at 18, becomes Queen.This movie is first and foremost a visual feast, with sumptuous costumes and elegant sets that make us feel we are truly peeking at royals behind closed doors. The script itself is rather episodic and choppy, with an endless parade of characters that we don't have time to identify or understand, and the political wrangling and power-brokering among her advisors is sometimes tedious. The relationship between Victoria and Albert is handled discreetly and they are shown to be a very happy couple indeed.Emily Blunt makes a beautiful, passionate, and poised Victoria and Rupert Friend is fine as the reserved young Albert. The DVD extras on wardrobe and Victoria's life are informative and enjoyable. All in all, it's pretty enough to make any girl want to be a queen.",Null,1,1,5 June 2010
Abraham Lincoln: Vampire Hunter," Well-made gore fest
","When young Abraham Lincoln angers a man (who happens to a vampire), the man takes his revenge by killing the boy's mother. Lincoln then dedicates his life to finding vampires and killing them with his silver-tipped ax.I really enjoyed this movie. Yes, it's horrifically gory at times, but the clever mix of fantasy and true events is cleverly done and I wouldn't wait to see what would happen next. We follow Lincoln from store clerk to the White House. The movie isn't playing for laughs, it's utterly serious. I actually found it more entertaining than Daniel Day-Lewis' 'Lincoln.' The title had me expecting a cheesy, low-budget slasher, but the production values are high and the special effects are excellent. The acting is also very good; Benjamin Walker plays a convincing Lincoln and Rufus Sewell is truly menacing as his nemesis.This is a surprising, clever story that includes just enough historical facts to make it almost plausible. A lot of blood, but still recommended.",Null,0,0,10 December 2012
The Big Lebowski," Disgusting
","Jeffrey 'The Dude' Lebowski (Jeff Bridges) is an unemployed slacker whose only interest is bowling with his moronic friends (John Goodman and Steve Buscemi). He becomes involved in a kidnapping case when he is mistaken for a millionaire also named Lebowski. Mayhem ensues.I had heard for years that this was a Great Movie, a piece of Film Art from the Coen Brothers. So much for my curiosity. If you like your movies PG like I do, this is a movie to avoid at all costs. The main character is a disgusting slob with no redeeming qualities and the 'F' word is used 260 times in 117 minutes. The movie is vulgar and pointless. I give it one star only because I can't give it zero stars.",Null,30,72,10 May 2010
Au Revoir les Enfants," 'Goodbye, children.'
","The year is 1943, and Julien returns to boarding school where he meets a new, rather mysterious boy named Bonnet. Julien doesn't like the new boy at first, but gradually their mutual love of books and an exciting game of capture the flag cement their friendship. Life is good at the school and, except for having no heat and meager meals, the war has little effect on the students until the day the Gestapo comes to class.This film is based on an event in director/writer Louis Malle's childhood, one that obviously haunted him decades later. It is a war movie for people who hate war movies, focusing on the ups and downs and youthful hijinks of boys at school, until the sudden and shocking conclusion. The boys who play Julien and Bonnet are both naturals and give sincere, touching performances. The war era is faithfully reproduced and it feels like a movie made in the forties, instead of 1987. In French with subtitles. Heartily recommended.",Null,0,1,8 March 2010
The Impossible," Frightening true story
","Naomi Watts and Ewan McGregor star as parents who take their three sons to Thailand on vacation where they become victims of the deadly tsunami of 2004.Every minute of this true story is gut-wrenching, from the incredibly realistic recreation of the tsunami to the mass death and devastation afterward. Watts and McGregor are excellent as the suffering and selfless parents and Tom Holland gives a wonderful performance as their brave young son.I saw videos of the disaster, but putting a personal, family face on the horror makes it all the more real and heartbreaking. Filmed on location in Thailand, the movie is intense and very moving. Highly recommended.",Null,0,1,24 January 2014
Argo," A secret operation comes to life
","During the 1979 take-over of the American Embassy in Tehran, six Americans escape and are hidden in the Canadian Embassy. The CIA hatches a plot to get them out by having them masquerade as members of a Canadian sci-fi film project.What a stunning movie. It is unbearably tense and the ending left me breathless and in tears. Director/Star Ben Affleck does a wonderful job and it's all the more harrowing because it's a true story. John Goodman and Alan Arkin play Hollywood insiders and add a bit of much-needed humor in small roles. Argo won the 2013 Best Picture Oscar and I enjoyed it very much.",Null,0,2,26 March 2013
The Secret in Their Eyes," 'The eyes...speak...'
","Benjamin Esposito (Ricardo Darín), a retired detective in Buenos Aires, is haunted by a shocking rape/murder case he worked on twenty-five years ago. He decides to write a novel about it and returns to his old office to enlist the help of his former partner, a perpetually drunk but true-blue friend (Guillermo Francella), and his boss (Irene Menéndez Hastings), a beautiful woman he has secretly loved all this time.This outstanding film won an Oscar for Best Foreign Language Film. The script is extremely clever, mixing equally-compelling stories of crime and love. There are frequent flashbacks so we feel we really become involved in the case and know and care about the three main characters. The grizzly crime is thankfully seen only for a few fleeting moments but its horror keeps the story exciting and moving at a fast pace. I was on the edge of my seat the whole time.The actors are all outstanding, so good I never felt they were acting. The entire film is riveting, the dialogue is realistic, and there is a great 'what would you do?' ending. Heartily recommended for those who enjoy crime stories with twists and turns with occasional comic bits plus a bittersweet, unrequited love story.",Null,0,0,9 October 2010
127 Hours," A cautionary tale
","28-year old Aron Ralston was an experienced hiker and climber who set out for a day of fun in Canyonlands that changed his life forever. He fell down a crevice, a boulder pinned his arm, and he was unable to free himself. Over the next five days, Aron recorded his thoughts on his video camera and dreamed about his family and friends, then, with no food or water left, decided to end his ordeal.This movie is filmed almost like a documentary, a virtual one-man show for James Franco. He's very good and believable as the hot shot outdoorsman who kept his head in a hopeless situation. The whole film leads up to the famous scene where Aron got free the only way he could, by severing his arm. That scene is very graphic and hard to watch, but it is short.The movie is a testament to one man's courage and resourcefulness. It wasn't the best movie I saw last year, but it is very well made.",Null,0,2,29 March 2011
Ed Wood," 'This story is gonna grab people.'
","Johnny Depp stars as Ed Wood, arguably the worst movie director of all time, in this amusing and at times, touching story of Ed's career in the fifties. Ed was an unparalleled optimist, enamored with movie-making; he possessed little talent, expertise, or money, but he and his little group of pals made cheap and very bad horror/sci-fi movies and loved it. The only star he ever worked with was Bela Lugosi (Martin Landau), decades after his success as 'Dracula,' now drug-addicted and in failing health. Wood and Lugosi made several films together, the most (in)famous being, 'Plan 9 From Outer Space,' which was actually made after Lugosi's death.Depp is extremely likable and sympathetic as the effervescent Wood. His quirky, driven personality and penchant for wearing angora sweaters seem entirely believable. Landau won a Best Supporting Oscar for his portrayal of the washed-up Lugosi; he's pathetic and grotesque and absolutely mesmerizing. Watching Ed throw together a whole movie in a few days is hilarious. For Ed, quality was in the mind of the beholder and he loved his movies.This is a sweet, amusing, lightweight tale about a fascinating Hollywood character that may inspire you to see some of his movies. Recommended.",Null,0,0,1 September 2011
500 Days of Summer," 'Loneliness is underrated.'
","Tom (Joseph Gordon-Levitt), a twenty-something greeting card writer, recalls the 500 days in which he loved a girl named Summer (Zooey Deschanel). Though she made it clear she was a free spirit and didn't want a boyfriend, the two coworkers became involved and then parted, reunited briefly to be parted again.This much talked-about romantic dramedy is fairly lightweight stuff, aimed at the teen and early-twenties set. To my older eyes, it seemed a bit of fluff, a forgettable reverie, some bittersweet moments on the way to growing up. The episodic movie is broken into individual 'days,' with each scene lasting only a minute or two; it soon became clear there wouldn't be time to develop deep feelings and each vignette felt cursory and sometimes even corny. Although Gordon-Levitt and Deschanel are both appealing, there was no chemistry between them and no connection with me as a viewer.I suppose it's pleasant enough if you like lovesick boy meets girl-type flicks, but it just wasn't engaging enough for me.",Null,4,6,17 May 2010
Children of Heaven," Charming
","As the story opens, young Ali is picking up his sister's shoes from the repair shop. On the way home, the shoes are inadvertently lost and Ali must tell his little sister Zahra they are gone. The family has no money for new shoes and Ali fears they will both be beaten, so they don't tell their parents but come up with a plan: Zahra will wear Ali's shoes to school in the morning and he will wear them in the afternoon.This Iranian film is absolutely charming. We see the world through the children's eyes...the harsh realities of their poverty and the contrasting luxury Ali sees when he helps his father as a gardener. Ali risks serious consequences by sticking with the plan and Zahra's heart longs for the beautiful shoes of her classmates. The children who play the leads are natural actors, completely believable and sympathetic; sadly, this was their only movie.I couldn't wait to see what would happen next and the long-distance race at the end is really exciting. Highly recommended, but keep the tissues handy. (In Persian with English subtitles.)",Null,0,0,3 November 2009
Midnight in Paris," 'You're in love with a fantasy.'
","Owen Wilson stars as Gil, a burned-out Hollywood script writer, who's visiting Paris with his fiancée. The couple have very different opinions of Paris and of life in general; she hates the city and wants to hurry back to her Beverly Hills life while he adores Paris and wishes he had lived there in the 1920s. One night, at midnight, Gil's fantasy comes true as he is magically transported to the glittering world of Fitzgerald, Hemmingway, Picasso, and Gertrude Stein.If you love Woody Allen, you'll enjoy this movie. Wilson plays the typically introspective, dissatisfied, stammering, good-hearted dreamer that Woody used to play but with much less success. Wilson just doesn't have the power and charisma needed to pull off the role. He's boring and I never cared about him or Rachel McAdams, who plays his fiancée. She's really annoying and unremarkable in every way. Marion Cotillard, on the other hand, is utterly charming as Gil's 1920's love interest and Cathy Bates is fun to watch as Gertrude Stein.The city of Paris never looked lovelier, with nearly every scene saturated in golden light, befitting Gil's fantasy land. The period costumes are lovely and several scenes featuring famous people from the past are enjoyable (although the fun wears off quickly). Writer/director Allen's script is silly, predictable, shallow, and dull. I couldn't relate to any of the characters; it was like visiting a wax museum that's pretty but the mannequins aren't real.",Null,0,0,12 January 2012
The Adventures of Tintin," Very entertaining film
","Tintin is a young European journalist who also solves crimes. After buying a model ship, he becomes involved in a mystery about a pirate treasure and finds his life is in danger.I loved this movie. The motion capture technique is fascinating and so well done. Some characters look cartoonish while others look very real; the scenery is strikingly beautiful. The action-packed story is part pirate swashbuckler and part Indiana Jones adventure; the combination makes for a spectacular and exciting film with a sweet, smart, and very likable young man at its center.Highly recommended, especially for adults, and you don't have to be familiar with the graphic novel source material to enjoy it.",Null,0,0,13 March 2012

Little Liesel adjusts to her new life with the help of her kindly new Papa and the books she steals, which teach her to read. But life becomes frightening when the war starts and the family decides to hide a Jew in their home.This is an exquisite movie, the best I've seen a long time. The story is unforgettable and the cast is outstanding. Geoffrey Rush and Emily Watson are wonderful as Liesel's foster parents Sophie Nelisse is perfectly cast as Liesel, growing from age 8 to 16. We see the war through her eyes; she is unflinchingly brave and lovable.There is a small amount of violence, mostly bombing, with just enough good people to show that life is worth living. This is a tear-jerker, but well worth watching.",Null,1,1,26 April 2014
The Town," Exciting crime drama
","Doug MacRay (Ben Affleck) and his pals are career criminals. On a bank job, they briefly take a hostage (Rebecca Hall) and soon after, she and Doug begin a romance. He wants to start a new life with her, but he can't change his ways and his next job is to rob Fenway Park.This is an excellent movie. The characters are compelling and sympathetic and the script is fast-paced and intensely exciting. Affleck co-wrote and directed this tale of Charlestown, Boston, an area famous for its high percentage of deadly criminals. He captures the toughness and desperation of its inhabitants and the viewer feels a connection to the place and the people. Affleck is very good in his part and Jeremy Renner, who plays Doug's loyal but vicious buddy, was rightly nominated for Best Supporting Actor. The wonderful Chris Cooper has a small part as Doug's convict father.The movie is full of brutal gunplay, car crashes, and bad language and still manages to portray Doug's sensitive side and have him emerge as a kind of hero. Its edge-of-your-seat action kept me engaged even though I don't usually like this kind of movie. Recommended.",Null,0,1,1 March 2011
Life of Pi," A boy, a tiger, a boat
","A young boy's family is moving their zoo animals from India to Canada when a storm sinks their freighter. The only survivors are Pi, a hyena, a zebra, and a tiger named Richard Parker, who find themselves in a lifeboat in the middle of the ocean.On the plus side, I liked that the movie was faithful to the book. The photography and special effects were breathtaking; director Ang Lee has created a dreamy, magical, and stunningly beautiful world for Pi. The CGI tiger was excellent; I could not tell when he was drawn and when he was real. The soundtrack is lovely.On the down side, I found myself glancing at my watch at times, wondering when it would be over. The pace was too slow for me and I think it would have been an even better movie had 15 minutes been cut from it.The acting was outstanding and fans of the wonderful book will not be disappointed.",Null,2,5,29 November 2012
Gone Baby Gone," When is the right thing the wrong thing?
","The story opens in a poor section of Boston, where a 4-year old girl has been kidnapped. The police Captain (Morgan Freeman) isn't having any luck with the investigation, so the child's aunt hires two private detectives (Casey Affleck and Michelle Monaghan) to help. Their work takes them into a cruel world where life is very cheap.This movie really surprised me. First off, it was a tense and scary detective story, but then it became a story about Right and Wrong, leaving the audience to judge the actions and the characters. While it's full of violence, depravity, and bad language, it is a memorable story that deserves to be discussed. The actors are uniformly superb, especially Morgan Freeman in a very sympathetic role. Casey Affleck is excellent as the detective with street cred despite his baby face, and Ed Harris does his usual great job playing a police officer. Boston native Ben Affleck directed the movie and filmed it on location, giving it a sleazy, but apparently accurate look at life in the area.The moral dilemma posed at the end is not easily answered. I know I was left shaken and sobbing, so sorry for the situation and wondering what I would do. Highly recommended.",Null,0,2,19 June 2009
Burn After Reading," Good Coen Brothers romp
","In Washington, D.C., a group of seemingly unrelated characters and a tangle of subplots makes for an entertaining, if lightweight, star-studded comedy with tragic overtones. A CIA man (John Malkovich) gets fired while his wife (Tilda Swinton) is having an affair with a playboy (George Clooney); an insecure woman (Frances McDormand) and her dippy co-worker (Brad Pitt) find the CIA man's memoir and try to peddle it to the Russians.This film has all the delightful earmarks of a typical Coen Brothers film: It's full of ordinary, somewhat dim characters, greed has a major role, the dialogue is often hysterically funny, and things get quickly out of hand and disaster ensues. The casting is typically odd; Clooney is made out to be a pretentious and rather unsavory guy despite his charisma and Pitt is a foolish simpleton. McDormand is wonderful as the naive middle-ager who gets mixed up in international affairs, and Malkovich is manic and off-kilter as usual.It's all chaotic and weird, silliness gone wild that is fun to watch but soon forgotten.",Null,2,4,23 June 2009
Bridge of Spies," Very good
","The story of the prisoner exchange involving Francis Gary Powers is one of unending tension broken just occasionally by little humorous comments. Tom Hanks plays the lawyer defending the Russian spy that was eventually traded for U-2 pilot Powers. The negotiations are complicated and could have been tedious in the hands of a lesser cast and director.Hanks is completely believable and a pleasure to watch. We get to know and, to some degree, sympathize with the Russian spy and Powers is certainly a likable character, shot down on his first spy mission. Very entertaining and educational film.

Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows: Part 1," Fans of the book will like the movie
","As Harry Potter turns 17, he and his pals Ron and Hermione decide to forgo their last year of school in order to finally bring an end to Lord Voldemort whose evil has taken over the wizarding world. To do this, they must locate and destroy six Horcruxes that house parts of Voldemort's soul. He, on the other hand, is searching for three Deathly Hallows, magical items that bring immortality to their owner.The film is exactly like the 7th book and if you loved the book, you'll love the movie. For me, the book was bloated, pointless, and poorly written so I wasn't surprised to find the movie left me cold. The kids have outgrown their youthful charm and are cranky teenagers. Special effects so dominate the film that there is little actual dialogue. This is the first movie in the series to take place in the Muggle world instead of Hogwarts School and the fun of earlier episodes is sorely missing. Characters and scenes fly by so quickly you'll be lost if you haven't read the book. Plus, it's dreary-looking, filmed entirely in sepia, grays, and black shadows.So, it's a faithful adaptation of the source novel; if you found that entertaining, you'll enjoy the film.

","Four unrelated vignettes involving tourists, newlyweds, and quirky locals play out in Rome. The characters are neither sympathetic, likable, interesting, nor memorable. The plots are like fantasy daydreams but still manage to be incredibly tiresome. I was so glad when the movie was over.On the plus side, the photography is exquisite. Rome is filmed in a warm, golden light that makes it look like a fairytale city for lovers. Some very good actors get stuck with trite material and Woody Allen is still playing the same loser character he's been doing for forty years.Terrible movie.",Null,12,22,24 January 2013
Non-Stop," Thrilling mystery
","Liam Neeson stars as troubled air marshal Bill Marks, who is enroute to London. He starts receiving text messages saying someone on board will be killed every 20 minutes unless $150M is sent to a secret bank account. And then people start dying.In this movie, every character, except for Bill, is set up as a likely suspect; they all look very shifty and fully capable of murder. It's fun to watch everyone look guilty and my mind was racing to figure out the culprit (I couldn't.). Neeson is outstanding as the air marshal, running the gamut of emotions from grief to confusion to terror; he's instantly sympathetic and likable. Julianne Moore is good as Bill's seat mate and it's great to see Michelle Dockery ('Downton Abbey') as a flight attendant.From the opening moments, I felt uneasy; that quickly turned to paranoia and then fear. The story kept me on the edge of my seat the whole time and I really enjoyed the mystery of it. Recommended.",Null,2,4,14 March 2014
Behind The Candelabra," Opulent but often unpleasant
","The movie opens in 1977 as Liberace (Michael Douglas) is starring in Las Vegas and seventeen year old Scott Thorson (Matt Damon) has just become his latest boy-toy. They carry on a passionate affair for five years before Lee's eye begins to wander again.This is not a biography of Liberace, but rather the story of Lee and Scott's affair. The two stars are very good, although Douglas' Liberace wasn't quite as likable as I'd wished. The two make a dynamic duo and really hold one's attention. Rob Lowe has a funny role as a plastic surgeon with one too-many bad eye jobs. Debbie Reynolds has a few lines as Lee's mother. The sets and costumes are lavish and the whole movie glitters with a Vegas aura.The movie is based on Scott Thorson's memoir, so, naturally, he comes out as the hero and victim while Liberace is the slimy predator. Much of the graphic storyline had me cringing in shock, but, still, I watched. I was a big fan of Liberace's old TV show and this film doesn't change that, but it did sadden me a bit.",Null,0,3,18 September 2013
2012," Noah would be proud
","When Jackson Curtis (John Cusack) set out with his kids on a camping trip, little did he know that the world as he knew it was about to end. It seems top scientists and world leaders have known for years what the Mayans knew - that the earth would be destroyed by earthquakes and tsunamis in 2012 - and only a few people would be saved aboard giant arks being built in China. Jackson, being a resourceful (and preternaturally lucky) guy, rushes his family to China with no time to spare.This movie delivers on the special effects, no doubt about it. Watching California collapse into the ocean was really convincing. There were two problems for me, however: I didn't like any of the characters (many of whom were cartoonish) and the endless narrow escapes were too ludicrous to take seriously. Cusack wasn't a strong enough leading man to hold my interest; likewise Amanda Peet never convinced me she was a real wife and mother experiencing the last day on earth. Their kids were too cute, the Russian bad guy was neither villainous nor funny, just off-putting, and Danny Glover was wasted playing a noble President.I've enjoyed watching Emmerich's other disaster flick, 'The Day After Tomorrow' many times because the characters were likable, the plot was compelling, and the effects didn't dominate the story. This movie, in contrast, had too much CGI, unbelievable action, and an ending that was never in question. This is a good enough movie to see once, but that's all.",Null,0,1,26 November 2009
Lincoln," Boring
","The movie examines Abraham Lincoln's (Daniel Day-Lewis) efforts to pass the 13th Amendment in the last few months of his life. It is a detailed account of his strategy and the negotiations of the members of his cabinet, especially his Secretary of State, William Seward (David Strathairn). The story deals with the minute details involved in making slavery illegal; conversations between pompous politicians are endless and dry and I found it boring. I would have preferred a biography of Lincoln's life; the nonstop speechifying was tedious in the extreme. None of the dialogue sounded spontaneous; each line sounded well-rehearsed with the result that it looks like a filmed play.Day-Lewis certainly looks the part, but his Lincoln isn't very interesting or charismatic. His soft, high voice is particularly unengaging. I expected his voice to sound like Gregory Peck as Atticus Finch. For me, the movie was too long and a crashing bore.",Null,263,471,30 November 2012
The Piano," Two words: Harvey Keitel
","The story opens in the mid-19th century, as we meet the voluntarily-mute Ada McGrath (Holly Hunter) whose only form of expression is playing her beloved piano. She and her daughter and the piano arrive in New Zealand to meet a man she's been married to in absentia, a shy farmer trying to carve a homestead out of the Maori rain forest. Sadly, Ada has no interest in him, but she is strangely attracted to their rather earthy neighbor (Harvey Keitel).Wow. This story captures sensuality, desire, and love in a very adult movie. Hunter won Best Actress of 1994 for her performance as the drab and somber Ada and eleven year-old Anna Paquin won Best Supporting Actress for playing her spunky daughter. Neill is appropriately stiff and unsure (and altogether adorable) as the unhappy husband, but the real surprise here is Harvey Keitel, who is unforgettably lusty. I'm really surprised he didn't become a romantic star after this, because he was Really Good.This is an unusual and erotic tale with unlikely lovers finding each other in an inhospitable place.

Quiz Show," Exciting story of a scandal
","The year is 1957, and everyone, it seems, is watching the popular TV game show, 'Twenty-One.' Contestants can stay on the show for weeks, earning then-astronomical sums of money and becoming household names. Such was the case for Herbert Stemple (John Turturro), a buck-toothed, blue-collar guy who raked in the money. Little did the public know that the show was entirely scripted and that Herb was told the answers in advance. When Charles Van Doren (Ralph Fiennes) a bright, attractive college instructor came on the show, the producers decided it was time for Herb to lose; he did and Van Doren became the biggest thing on television, even making the cover of Time Magazine. But he and the show were no match for Congressional watchdog Dick Goodwin (Rob Morrow) who exposed the show for the fraud that it was.I was really surprised at how exciting this movie was. It's got humor and drama and is filled with tension. Fiennes portrays Van Doren as a witty, charming Connecticut Yankee from an influential family. We care about him and suffer with him as he prepares to confess his part in the fraud not only to Congress, but to his trusting father. Turturro's Herbie is a fascinating, naive, greedy man whose life was ruined by the show. Morrow is excellent as the whistle-blower.The movie is a wonderful look back at a time when we as a people were so much more trusting and innocent. This scandal rocked the nation and changed us forever. This is a great movie.",Null,0,0,1 November 2010
Everest," Interesting, but not great
","In 1996, the dreams of a group of Everest climbers ended in tragedy at the top due to poor decisions, short supplies, and blizzard conditions. This is a well-made and fascinating story, but it lacked emotional power for several reasons: In 3-D, every time the camera panned, the background images were an unrecognizable, shaky blur that left me queasy. I didn't feel the 3-D added anything to the scenery, which was already awesome (They really did film at Everest Base Camp). Another problem I had was that the characters were hard to tell apart with the beards, goggles, caps, and other gear hiding their faces. And lastly, there were a variety of accents that I found hard to understand, so I was basically just following the action like a silent movie.The old question of 'Why do you climb a mountain?' is never answered in this film, and there was only a very brief epilogue, but the movie does make you think about the costs versus the rewards of scaling the peak.(There was a 1997 TV movie, 'Into Thin Air: Death on Everest,' which had a smaller budget but packed much more of an emotional wallop because it focused on personalities and backstories of the climbers.)",Null,0,0,27 September 2015
Into the Wild," Poignant adventure story
","When Chris McCandless (Emile Hirsch) graduated from college, he had one goal in life - to finally break away from his unhappy family and the constraints of society in general and live off the land in Alaska. The episodic film flashes back and forth between Chris' adventures in Alaska and the months leading up to it, focusing on the people who befriended him, including an aging hippie couple and a lonely, old man (well-played by the venerable Hal Holbrook).Based on a true story and narrated with many of Chris' journal entries, the film is an emotional roller coaster; I was torn between admiring his youthful idealism and courage and hating him for the pain he inflicted on his family. The movie feels much like a documentary as it follows Chris hitchhiking and working his way across the country and then surviving, at first, quite well in Alaska.Emile Hirsch is well-cast as Chris and makes you care about him right from the start. He did all of his demanding stunts himself and even lost 40 pounds to play the ailing Chris. It is a very touching story. Amid the splendor of the wilderness but ultimately alone, Chris finally understood that happiness is only real when it is shared. Highly recommended.",Null,7,9,26 June 2009
Avatar," Lovely
","It is the year 2154, and Jake Sully (Sam Worthington) arrives on the planet Pandora, which is home to a rare mineral needed back on earth. Scientists there have created 'avatars' which are a cross between humans and the indigenous blue Na'vi people; Sully is asked to use his avatar to befriend the locals and get them to leave the area so mining can expand.The movie blends live actors and computer-generated scenes to make a story that reminded me a lot of 'Fern Gully' (1992); both have innocent Mother Earth-loving natives pitted against evil industrialists, lush forests with a pleasing color palette of greens, pinks, and purples, and even a sacred tree. This movie is lovely to look at and the 3-D effects are fun, even if much of it does seem like a fancy comic book. The actors are all fine, the animation is well done, and the script is exciting, if predictable. Recommended for fans of animation, action, and adventure.",Null,1,3,25 December 2009
The Artist," 'Cut.'
","As the story opens, it is 1929, and we meet George Valentin, a dashing matinée idol who thrills his fans with his silent movies. He meets a star-struck young lady named Peppy and helps her get into show business as a extra. Soon, she's rising to super-stardom, while George's star is fading fast.This is a gimmick movie; a silent, black and white homage to silent and early talkies. The actors mug and ham it up throughout the film, the story is sweet and predictable, and the dog was my favorite part.It was a good try at doing something different but after ten minutes I was saying, 'I get it, already. It's a silent movie.' I would have liked it better if it were 20 minutes long.I don't think it deserved 5 Oscars. The novelty got old fast for me. I watched most of it in 2X FF.",Null,2,5,26 June 2012
Super 8," Not super at all
","The year is 1979, and 14-year old Joe and his pals sneak out every night to make a Super 8 zombie movie. One night, while filming, they witness a horrific train derailment that involves their teacher. Before they know it, the military arrives and takes over their little town and the boys find themselves in danger.The first half of the movie focuses on the boys' friendships and their movie-making and is fairly interesting, but I didn't particularly like any of the kids and they use too much profanity. When the sci-fi part kicks in, logic flies out the window and there are plot holes galore. It was hard to follow because this part is filmed in near-total darkness and very hard to see so it was dull for me. The whole thing tries to be similar in tone to 'ET,' but seems like a cheap rip-off. The kids aren't charismatic, the military men are cartoonishly evil, and the monster is a let-down (when you can see it). The special effects are great but the story itself is weak.",Null,0,1,24 November 2011
Up," 'I have just met you and I love you!'
","When Carl was a little boy, he was fascinated with the daring exploits of Charles Muntz, the famous explorer. Then he met Ellie, and she shared Carl's passion for adventure. They had a long and happy life together, but now that Carl is alone, he doesn't want to do anything but be a grump. One day he meets a young scout named Russell and his life changes; maybe Carl has one more adventure in him, after all.I'd heard this animated film was touching, and sure enough, ten minutes into it, I was reaching for a tissue and sobbing. The movie deals with love and loss, and adults who have experienced this may well get more out of the film than children will. It's all about doing what you always wanted to do and it's very good.Ed Asner provides the voice of the old codger Carl and I liked him more than I thought I would. Christopher Plummer is the villain who's not really very menacing at all. The little boy, Russell, is a bit annoying in his helplessness and naiveté, but Dug, the dog is so adorable that I would see the movie again just for him.While not quite as memorable as Pixar's 'Wall-E,' this movie will leave you with a smile on your face and a lump in your throat.",Null,3,6,13 June 2009
Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire," Deatheaters and *gasp* Dates!
","Now in his fourth year at school, Harry Potter (Dan Radcliffe) becomes unwittingly involved in the infamous 'Tri-Wizard Tournament,' wherein champions from Hogwarts and two visiting wizarding schools face frightening challenges in the hope of winning eternal glory. With help from his buddies Ron and Hermione, Harry battles dragons, survives underwater, and faces a terrifying maze. Equally scary for him: He must choose a date for the Yule Ball. He has his eyes on the lovely Cho Chang but is too shy to ask her. Lord Voldemort and his Deatheaters play a prominent part in this installment as Harry faces a life and death duel.The movie is very well written and the acting is good, too. The three kids are now playing 14-year olds and are showing a greater range of emotions. There is much humor when it comes to dealing with the opposite sex, a talent the usually capable Harry seems to lack. Watching the three at the Yule Ball is sweet and awful, as these things tend to be at that age.The soundtrack and special effects are wonderful as usual and the suspenseful story is acceptable and enjoyable for children over eight as well as older audiences. If you're a Potter fan, you're sure to enjoy 'Goblet of Fire.' This is the best of the series so far and definitely lives up to all expectations.",Null,1,2,2 September 2010
Crazy Heart," 'Life, unfortunately.'
","Bad Blake (Jeff Bridges) is a sick, old, bum of a country singer whose better days are long gone. Reduced to one-nighters in bowling alleys, he stumbles through his shows in a drunken haze, but still knows how to please the groupies. On one stopover, he meets Jean (Maggie Gyllenhaal), a young reporter and single mother. Though she's been sorely disappointed by men before, the two begin an unlikely love affair.I was prepared to dislike this movie, because I generally don't like slacker has-been characters. Bridges' Bad Blake is indeed an aimless loser, but it's impossible not to see his underlying vulnerability and I liked and cared about him. Bridges is completely believable as a singer and musician, looking and sounding very much like Kris Kristopherson on a bad day; he performs effortlessly and with the assurance of a pro. He is ably supported by the wonderful Ms Gyllenhaal who plays a sadder but wiser young woman and the always great Robert Duvall in a small but meaty role.This movie is ultimately about redemption and would make good viewing at an AA meeting. The stellar cast and fine script make for a rewarding viewing experience.",Null,2,3,24 May 2010
WALL·E," Wall-E
","Rating: +5 Humans left the uninhabitable earth 700 years ago to live in luxury aboard a huge space ship. Left alone on the planet was Wall-E, a little robot who endlessly collects trash, compacts it, and neatly stacks the cubes in sky-high stacks. He finds many interesting things in his job, but every night as he watches the romantic songs from his video of 'Hello, Dolly!' he sighs wistfully and wishes he could find someone to love.I wasn't prepared for how moving this wonderful movie would be. The early scenes showing Wall-E painfully alone and longing for love are absolutely heartbreaking. Happily, love does come in the form of a robot named EVE, sent to earth to detect plant life. Much of the movie is without dialogue and when it does come, it's very short and very sweet:'Eva?' 'Wall-E?' 'EVAAA!!' 'WALL-EEEEE!!!'There's lots of fun and high-speed action aboard the huge spaceship and some guilty insights into the future of mankind (fat, lazy slobs catered to by robots). With humor, romance, thrills, and above all, an adorable trash-compactor named Wall-E, this is a movie all ages can enjoy. Highly recommended. (Bring your tissues!)",Null,0,2,18 September 2010
The Blind Side," Insipiring family film
","When Leigh Anne Tuohy (Sandra Bullock), a wealthy Memphis wife and mother, meets homeless teen Mike Oher (Quinton Aaron), she brings him into her home as one of the family.The movie, based on a true story, is fairly predictable as it heads toward its happy and tear-jerking ending, but it's told so well that it's never corny or maudlin. The traumas Mike endured early in life are alluded to rather than graphically shown, and one is left with overwhelming admiration for him and the Tuohy family. Sandra Bullock is great as the feisty Leigh Anne and singer Tim McGraw is very likable as her husband. Quinton Aaron is excellent as the abandoned child who went on to graduate from college and play professional football. Many real-life college football coaches play themselves as Mike is wooed by all the top schools. Highly recommended.",Null,1,2,12 December 2009
The Woman in Black," What happened to the dog?
","In the early 1900s, young lawyer Arthur Kipps (Daniel Radcliffe) is sent to a remote village to go through the papers of a recently deceased old woman. He finds the villagers oddly hostile, yet sets about his work in the woman's creepy, old house. There, he begins to unravel the story of a mysterious woman believed to haunt the place.If you're looking for a scary movie, look no further. There are scares every four minutes or so once Arthur starts (voluntarily and against all common sense) exploring the house, endlessly going from dark room to dark room while the eerie music and sound effects build to get-ready-to-shriek levels. The movie has little dialogue, with Arthur alone most of the time just looking for the ghost.This kind of alone-in-the-house part is usually played by a beautiful, helpless, young woman but Radcliffe does a good job and comes off as serious and mature and not too scared of the dark. If you saw the movie without sound, it probably wouldn't be nearly as frightening, so a great deal of credit must go to the music and sound effects. CiarÃ¡n Hinds is good in a rather undemanding, supporting role. The titular character rather disappointingly resembles a mannequin in a high school haunted house.The movie makes the most out of people' primal fear of the dark and genuine shocks come on a regular basis. I found the movie a bit unsatisfying, though, because it's so unpleasant and there's little to relate to since Arthur is a rather stoic, one-note character.",Null,0,1,7 February 2012
Saving Mr. Banks," Excellent acting but forgettable story
","When the author of 'Mary Poppins' comes to see Walt Disney about making her books into a movie, we learn a lot about her childhood and the inspirations for her characters. She's a rigid sourpuss, immune to the warmth and charms of Mr. Disney, however, and won't even consider the changes he wants.The constant flashbacks to P.L. Travers' idyllic-then-tragic childhood are quite interesting (although I still don't understand the title). Tom Hanks is utterly lovable as Disney and plays well against Emma Thompson's brittle, control-freak old maid, Travers. It's fun to see the two pros act together.There is a lot of trivia for fans of the Mary Poppins movie, but this is actually a very lightweight and inconsequential story, more suited as a 'extra' on the Mary Poppins DVD, rather than a full-length film. I enjoyed it but have forgotten most of it already.",Null,1,3,24 April 2014
Moonrise Kingdom," Not funny
","Two 12-year olds meet one summer and fall in love. He's a troubled orphan staying at scout camp and she feels misunderstood by her big family. They run away together.This is a typical Wes Anderson movie; if you like his other movies, you'll like this one, too. I found it boring, poorly written, and a wannabe-cool movie. All the actors speak in a monotone and wear a poker face in the movie; no one ever smiles or looks real. The kids who play the main characters never sound spontaneous and aren't likable. They try to be like Christina Ricci in 'The Addams Family,' except she was funny and they're not. The adult cast includes many top actors, but even they can't pull it off; they look and sound like they're reading the script for the first time.The humor is (too) dry, the characters are devoid of personality, and the action is absurd. I know this is what Wes Anderson was going for, but I didn't care for it.",Null,4,6,24 December 2012
Flight," Exciting but flawed movie
","A routine plane flight encounters a catastrophic malfunction, but the alcoholic, drugged pilot miraculously saves many lives. Now the question is: How will his additions affect the crash investigation?Denzel Washington plays the pilot and gives an outstanding performance. He's utterly charismatic, sympathetic, and a pleasure to watch. Though his character is troubled and weak, I was rooting for him. The plane emergency is so real and scary, you'll never want to fly again.On the down side, I found the prolonged nudity in the opening scene and the nonstop profanity to be completely unnecessary and degrading. Also, John Goodman's comic-relief drug dealer is viewed as an amiable and even helpful man, which is off-putting.Washington is such a fine actor, I wish he had had a better script that didn't rely on the shock value of gutter language, nudity, and drug abuse.",Null,2,3,7 December 2012
Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows: Part 2," Well, it's finally over
","Part 2 starts at the moment Part 1 ended with Voldemort getting Dumbledore's wand and Harry grieving at Dobby's grave. Harry and his pals then go to Gringott's Bank in search of a horcrux which must be destroyed so Voldemort can be killed once and for all. They also would like to find the three deathly hallows, objects which give the owner immortality. Their journey leads back to Hogwarts, which is now under Death Eater control and a grim place, indeed.This movie is exactly like the book, so I knew what to expect and wasn't surprised or disappointed, just not particularly entertained. This director loves CGI and the film's cartoony and chaotic mood doesn't lend itself well to emotions. Big events like deaths are rushed, the movie is confusing even if you're familiar with the plot, and it just didn't deliver a Grand Finale to Remember. Ron and Hermione have very little to do here and their big kiss is robotic; speaking of robots, Ginny still can't act and has no chemistry with Harry. The long-awaited epilogue scene was just like the rest of the movie - okay but not, 'WOW.' If you like computer animation and explosions, you'll love this movie. If you prefer heartfelt emotion and meaningful dialogue, you'll be disappointed but glad you stuck it out to the end.",Null,0,1,19 July 2011
The Pursuit of Happyness," 'If you want somethin', go get it.'
","This true story opens in San Francisco in the eighties, where salesman Chris Gardner (Will Smith) is barely able to make ends meet. His wife (Thandie Newton) gets fed up and leaves, and Chris must juggle a non-paying internship with a brokerage firm with caring for his five-year old son, Christopher (Jaden Smith). With no income, Chris and Christopher go from cheap apartment to cheaper motel and eventually become homeless.I waited a long time to see this movie because I thought it would be sugary-sweet and corny, but it's not; it's realistic and scary, heartwarming, and inspirational. Smith portrays Chris as an intelligent, hardworking, and extremely likable man who sees his world crumble around him. He gives a truly memorable performance. His real-life son Jaden is also wonderful as the plucky little boy who rolls with the punches and loves his dad no matter what.This film about a father's descent into homelessness is full of frustration, tempered with the innocence and resilience of the little son. It's sweet, but not too sweet, despite the title. Recommended.",Null,1,1,14 June 2009

He reluctantly agrees and takes her to Alaska to meet his family which includes his 90-year old grandmother (Betty White).I liked this movie a lot. Bullock is talented, mature, and naturally funny and Reynolds is very likable. On the down side, Bullock almost looks old enough to be his mother and that was a bit distracting. The story has certainly been done before, but the actors' charm makes it feel fresh and Betty White provides some really belly laughs. The exquisite Sitka scenery really had me fooled; I read that it was filmed in Massachusetts with CGI mountains.This rom-com has a familiar plot but clever writing and an appealing cast.

He likes his work and his life, which is uncomplicated by relationships or domestic demands. On one stop-over, however, Ryan meets a female version of himself (Vera Farmiga) and sparks fly.The success of this movie must be due entirely to the charm of its leading man, because it is in no other way unusual or special. Clooney is indeed quite likable playing a handsome, confident, smooth-talker while Farmiga is good in an undemanding role (but not worthy of an Oscar nomination, in my opinion). The plot is pleasant enough, but hardly memorable, so I don't understand all the hype. It was just okay for me.",Null,1,2,9 April 2010
