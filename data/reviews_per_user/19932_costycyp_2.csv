Black Swan," Perfect!!
","Black Swan is a cinematic triumph, bringing a modern day twist to the well-loved Grimm's Fairy tale style of story telling. Darren Aronofsky, director (Requiem for A Dream, The Wrestler) will have you holding your breath as he takes you into the fascinatingly beautiful and complicated world of prima ballerina, Nina (Natalie Portman). Natalie Portman holds nothing back as she slowly reels you into her startling, repressed, emotionally charged inner world. Aronofsky has skillfully interwoven the very sensual world of the ballet with the passion of the individuals who inhabit it.Beautifully designed, photographed and acted the movie is stylish and full of powerful images and intense emotions, my main criticism is that a movie like this needs to be centred around the lead character's relationship with the people around her, but her relationship was mainly to the character in the ballet. What was her fear about? Why was she so afraid of exposing her inner self? What demons lived there? You never find out.'Black Swan' leaves audiences with all sorts of questions and debatable points, which can be cumbersome, but it really makes for a fascinating discussion. You'll probably be internally at war over questionable little bits and pieces of the film, but it's those little moments that really make the film what it is. The performances here by all the actors are mesmerizing, as is the art direction and the general storytelling itselfâ€” this is truly a fascinating, off-kilter piece of cinema, and a true 'black swan' among recent films. It may leave you scratching your head in regards to some of the material that is hinted at and thrown toward us without full explication; but ultimately it won't matter, because 'it was perfect'. 10/10.",Null,2,6,26 December 2010
Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows: Part 1," Harry Potter!
","Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows:Part 1 is automatically very different from the previous films. Why? Firstly, at no point during the film is it set at Hogwarts where the other films have been centrally based. Some may not like this change of scenery, however I do because it gives a sense of freedom (and growing up) for the three protagonists. Again this next installment of the saga gets even darker with more deaths, fights, snakes and torture. There is a reason why such films are placed with a certificate of 12, so I suggest that youngsters should not be taken in less you know they can cope. Even I jumped a few times with the appearance of the snake. Again this Gothic feel adds to the sense of growing of age and freedom, as the three protagonists get a feel for what real life is like after leaving the relatively safe haven of Hogwarts. Dangerous; particularly if you are the infamous Harry Potter or are friends with him. Many people have been disappointed with the film, saying that not as much occurs compared with the other films, however, don't forget it is only part 1, and all those who have read the book will know that we have saved the best 'til last, and that this film is setting up for the explosion as the series concludes. So please wait until you have seen the second part before you make your concluding opinion of the film, because some things may not add up until you watch the second. Part 1 focuses mainly on the three protagonists, their relationship with each other, and the task that Harry Potter has put upon himself, with the help of his friends. The film also shows how wicked Voldermort and his other death eaters are, particularly Helena Bohnam Carter, who plays her part fantastically.Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows: Part 1 is a superb film that greatly lives up to my expectations. All aspects of it are really well done, story telling, character development, depth and emotion, even great action. Looking forward to part 2 which I feel has all the capacity, meaning even more thrilling plot to be even better!",9,0,0,26 December 2010
