The Blair Witch Project," Boring
","How can anybody seriously think this was a scary film? Perhaps people who have not been out in the woods camping or something, and thus don't know how it is to sleep in a tent and find your way out there, perhaps for them this movie could offer some chilling moments.But watching these three people walking around in the woods and getting scared by some noises is not my idea of a good movie. A few laughs, but nothing that got me scared s**less, like for example Time magazine had me hoping, based on their article entitled 'The Scariest Movie Ever'. I have a very hard time understanding how this film got its cult status.",3,0,1,14 January 2000
