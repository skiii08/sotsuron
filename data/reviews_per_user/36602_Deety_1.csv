The Blair Witch Project," Yay! An intelligent horror movie!
","This is one of the most original horror ideas.  I'm a big fan of scary movies.  I love cheesy low-budget slasher movies.  But intelligent horror movies are the scariest of all.  This movie scared me more than all of the fake blood and gore ever could, because it's subtle.  It's not really the kind of horror that makes you jump and scream in the theater.  It's better. It basically takes realistic people and screws with their reality.  If it can happen to them, it can happen to you.",Null,1,1,2 August 1999
