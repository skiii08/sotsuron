Casablanca," The best film ever made
","If it weren't for Casablanca, there would be no best film ever made. To see it is to love it. Bogart is wonderful in it. Bergman is wonderful. Greenstreet is wonderful. Everyone in it is wonderful.  I can't get enough of this film.  I'm gonna watch it again tomorrow!",10,0,0,1 February 2003
Battleship Potemkin," Old propaganda
","I love battleships and all the stories about them. This film is hard to watch. Yes, Eisenstein made great filmatic beauty, lo these many years ago, with his play of the camera and his directorship. But it is hard to watch nevertheless, in light of the history that has passed in the 102 years since the events portrayed in the film, and in the 82 years since the film was first released, and in the 18 years since the final fall of the Soviet communist dictatorship that killed so many millions in Russia and in the territories that the Soviet Union dominated for so long. This is not to mention, of course, the nazi-fascist response to communism that killed so many millions more. No mention of this famous, much acclaimed, and truly artistic film can go without a mention of the millions who died as a consequence of the events portrayed here and which in 1917 began and continued for the next six decades until this brutal regime was finally put to rest by the efforts of the United States of American under the leadership of President Ronald Reagan. The scene with the peoples' sailing craft going to the famous Battleship Potemkin is beautifully dramatic, though little do they know the fate that awaits them. The famous and horrifying Odessa steps sequence, one of the most momentous and prescient cinematic displays in moviedom, portrays not only the response to the communist revolution but the communist revolution itself when viewed in the clearer air of the 21st century. Sad as it was that these hundreds were murdered by the 'White Russian' soldiers, it pales to white in comparison to the millions killed by the 'Red Russians' of the 'revolution'. The Odessa steps sequence, complete with the baby carriage and baby rolling down the steps is emblematic now not only of the horror of the Imperial Russian reaction to the 'revolution' but of the effect of the 'revolution' itself. The Battleship Potemkin for all of its supposed greatness, and Eisenstein's artistic genius, is merely another piece of propaganda for the murder and genocide for which the communist 'revolution' and its evil spawn the nazi 'revolution' were to use to compete with one another in the following decades. The Battleship Potemkin's ready accessibility to the gullible collegians of the 60's and 70's, was just another glorified piece of communist propaganda, so popular then, that has been enshrined into our present age as something we should treasure. Rather, in light of the millions and millions who have suffered and died as a consequence of communism and fascism, this film should be relegated to the ash heap of history along with the works of Mao, Hitler and Marx as mere curiosities, to be studied for what they are, aberrations in the progress of mankind.",7,1,7,17 February 2007
Apocalypse Now," What a great shoot-em-up movie!
","Apocalypse Now is another of those films that is about half dream sequence. First of all it is a great movie.  It has great characters: Sheen defines the height of his character actor career.  Hopper plays his Easy Rider character o a T,  but this time with a job and a camera. Duval, utters those immortal words 'I love the smell of napalm in the morningÂ…' and 'Charlie don't surf!', and Brando is at his best. It has plenty of Vietnam War action for you, whether you liked the war, hated the war or fought the war, and is a slam-bang shoot-em-up of the kind that has been replaced by the computerized action films of the 21st century.  Realism or the lack of it aside (your opinion, your call) one can't help caught up in Sheen's Willard and his mission to terminate the command of Brando's Kurtz 'with extreme prejudice' and all the entertaining and exciting stuff involved in this purposeful character's quest.  Never does Sheen's character waiver from this purpose and seldom does the story of the film wander from this path. (when it does wander, you love it.) With 'Redux', through the wonder of the DVD format (ever heard of too much of a good thing?) New scenes are added (swept up from the cutting room floor) and pasted in here and there.  A new viewer of Apocalypse Now Redux might not notice that the bits are added, even though the movie has gone on past his bed time, but a veteran watcher of it might find them annoying, irrelevant, and easily skipable.  To me the 'Redux' version came down to this question:  'OK, so they didn't change the ending, why did they change the end'.  In 'Redux' I seriously miss the dreamy end with its combination of napalm, burning trees, The Doors and the final credits.  I'd give up all the cutting room floor stuff for the original finale.",10,1,1,4 February 2003
Kill Bill: Vol. 1," About as silly as they get
","Kill Bill (the first one) is the silliest movie I've seen in years!  It's sillier than Blazing Saddles, sillier than a Monty Python movie.  It is very cartoonish.  Part of it even is cartoon, (although it's that highly stylized Japanese cartoon).  Uma Thurman plays a good role, but I thought she used to be good looking.  All the murder, mayhem, incredible martial arts, spurting blood, severed limbs, funny character names, and goofy plot twists will keep you munching your popcorn with great animation. This silly piece of fluff is filled with fantastic violence, totally unbelievable plots and characters. Keeping all that in mind, it is hilarious from beginning to end! I hope the sequel is as cutely charming.",Null,19,37,4 June 2004
Pulp Fiction," Highly enjoyable non-stop action, fun, silliness, twisted and perverted.
","Having seen both of the Kill Bill movies, and having enjoyed their extreme entertainment value, I decided to see Tarantino's earlier Pulp Fiction. This film, filled with the 'f' word and the 'n' word and all manner of profanity (enough to make a sailor blush)and obscenity (who really cares), is a highly entertaining and cartoonish, mish mash of stories, plots and subplots centering about a gang of varied characters featuring drug dealers, dopers, perverts, rednecks, gangsters, murderers, bullies, victims, and all their blood, guts, violence, stupidity, and even a smattering of religion. What Tarantino has done here with his cast of wild characters is cover all the bases, providing non-stop entertainment and excitement for the viewer who is able to suspend his disbelief and disconnect from reality long enough to last until the head-scratcher that comes when the film runs out. (The story really doesn't end; I think Tarantino just ran out of time!) This is a great vehicle for the ever-familiar and versatile John Travolta. Samuel Jackson is a great and lovable baddest-type bad guy. I loved Harvey Keitel's cameo. Don't look for a lot of reality here, but enjoy the exaggerated realism. I found lots of laughs (it's easily as funny and silly as Kill Bill 1), lots of gore, lots of nice guns, strange twists, and enough time warps to want to see it again just to get things straightened out.",8,0,1,3 April 2005
Godzilla," Really, really awful
","It would be hard to sum up the poor quality of this movie in more than 10 lines, but I'll try. First, thin plot. like watered down chicken soup, not much to hear, feel, taste or see. Then acting, acting? Hardly any, dull, flat, high school play, these words come to mind. Then there's action, rather, the lack of any interesting action on the screen. Suspense? Nothing to see here, either. Truly a waste of celluloid, cheap sets, fake pyrotechnics and computer generated stuff. This movie (I won't call it a 'film') is a flat, amateurish, over-hyped loser which left me begging for less. Had I spent money to see this (borrowed DVD from library) I'd be suing for a refund! Bottom line for me: an unforgettably and unforgivingly bad movie!",2,2,8,29 October 2014
The Thin Red Line," Too tedious for me...
","These comments came into my head before I read anyone else's comments, and thus were not influenced, though I did read some. My view of this film is very different from the comments I read. First of all, I had a hard time enjoying this movie, and a hard time watching it, finding it sleep-inducing, slow moving, and insipid in dialog. Despite its having plenty of blood and gore, it just seems to lack realism. The characters seem trite and stereotyped, and only of three or four 'types'. I find it difficult to write the required ten lines here, because it it hard for me to find words to recommend this movie. Maybe it's too much of an 'anti-war' movie to be a good war movie.",Null,1,3,12 March 2006
