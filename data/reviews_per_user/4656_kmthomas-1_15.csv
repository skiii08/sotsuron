Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," One compound word: Jar-Jar
","Here's a great idea: never let people see screentests with better actors than the one you chose.  Jake Lloyd was easily the worst performance of a child actor in history.  He made me root for Sebulba (spelling?) in the pod race.  Forget the abomination of Jar-Jar Binks, let's talk about that rotten little kid.  Why didn't Lucas CGI a kid in there?  It couldn't have been worse, could it?  Why didn't Liam Neeson do that weird fading thing ObiWan does in episode 3?  Is there any logic to this stuff at all?  I am seriously doubting it. Sheesh, I don't need to go too far into this flick--it'll take all week to discuss the bad...",3,0,1,15 June 2003
Spider-Man 2," Didn't think Raimi could pull it off
","Artistically, the first SpiderMan was a failure. It was everything wrong with big budget Hollywood flicks--horrible, soap opera acting with ignorant, mind-numbing scripts that have so many loop holes in their logic as to make any fanboy pray for an aneurism. This movie, amazingly, was far better than its predecessor.In terms of where it started, Spiderman2 is easily the best sequel of all time! I say that simply because, while Godfather 2 was excellent, so was The Godfather. Spiderman 2 is excellent, but SpiderMan was crap. The level of improvement from original to sequel is astonishing.I'm not sure I believe Raimi directed this film, though. He's never done anything to prove (IMHO)he had any talent for non-camp material, but somehow he pulled this one off. Anyhow, most fanboys were thankful for the greatest improvement of all: less Willem Dafoe.",9,1,2,28 November 2004
Batman Returns," The Beginnings of Bad Sequels
","Michelle Pfeiffer as Catwoman.  Cool.  Keaton reprising Batman.  Also cool. Danny DeVito...waitaminnit: why is Danny DeVito in this movie?  why is there an additional 'big bad,' thus taking away from the character development between Bruce Wayne and Selina Kyle?  This is the inevitable simple equation that every comic adaptation proves, but Hollywood either doesn't care or isn't smart enough to catch on: 1 superhero + 1 supervillain = great movie, while 1 superhero + X supervillain(s) = bad movie.  Superman and Batman prove the first half of this equation.  Superman 2 is an example of a rare exception (as there are to all rules); however, it had Superman 1 to help build up Zod as a nemesis.  X-Men barely survived it.  All subsequent Batfilms died as a result of it.  Too many characters to focus upon requires either 18 hours of footage or the elimination of characters.  You can't build characters without scenes of them.  You can't have scenes of them if you have to have scenes of the other 13 characters in the film.  Pfeiffer as Catwoman is the only saving grace of this film.",5,0,1,26 June 2003
Star Wars: Episode VI - Return of the Jedi," The Force Is With Mark Hammill
","Who cares how they got to this movie as long as they got to it?  The ewoks are dumb.  Harrison Ford seems to 'phone it in,' and the black- screen is horrible (especially for something from ILM).  So, why did I give this thing a 7?  Mark Hammill.  The only reason for watching this movie is the very reason I loathe the others:  STORY.  The resolution of the Father-Son conflict comes to a climactic head in this movie.  Maybe it's Freudian, but it's comforting to witness Luke's compassion and love for his father proving wiser than Yoda and Obi-Wan's 'kill him and let God glue back together the pieces of Darth Vader' mentalities.  In the end, Vader saves Luke's life. Which, really, brings us to a conundrum, doesn't it?  Wouldn't LUKE be the one the prophesies foretold of bringing balance to the force (opposed to Anakin, as believed in Episodes 1 and 2, and stated in interviews with Lucas)?  Think: Darth slaughtered the Jedi and oppressed people for years! Luke, however, followed a path of enlightenment, and saved his father (and, by extension, the universe) from himself and the Emperor's grip!  This one aspect of the story was so well-done, I feel it saved the entire Star Wars run.",7,0,1,15 June 2003
Star Wars: Episode II - Attack of the Clones," Is There Anything Good About This Movie?
","I don't know how to describe this movie.  I'm left with an empty feeling and a kind of anger at how stupid this crap gets!  If Anakin was so God-powerful, or at least predicted to be in Episdoe 1, then why is he so dadgum stupid and weak?  He can't use the force to track a bounty hunter in the 2Fast2Stupid race sequence, he can't use the force to outrun her, and he can't use the force to find her in a crowded pub.  Can he use the force to open a can of beans?  At least then, there'd be a use for it.  This movie achieves what few movies can... it both sucks AND blows.",2,0,1,15 June 2003
The Thing," John Carpenter's Best Film
","How often is it that a remake is vastly superior to the original?  Not often is the answer.  The Thing is the only one that comes to mind.  This movie, much more true to the short story ,'Who Goes There?' from whence it was based, is far more magical and encompassing than 'The Thing [From Another World]' from the 50's.This is one of those all-rare instances in Hollywood where the special effects SUPPORT the story instead of take its place.  They serve to enhance the movie experience, and suspend your disbelief entirely.  If John Carpenter never makes another good film (he hasn't since), he can go to his reward knowing he made this one.  Solid acting,editing, music, and top-notch special effects highlight this film: one of science fiction's greatest movies.",8,1,2,11 May 2003
Terminator 3: Rise of the Machines," Judgment Day for Arnold's Career
","This movie was simply awful.  The first 2 Terminator movies were pieces of scifi history.  This contrived piece of crap is nothing more than a standard action flick.  Arnold delivered comedic line after comedic line after comedic line.  That might not have been so offensive if this was Commando II.  However, for a Terminator film, it's insulting to its legacy.  The absence of Cameron and Hamilton is noticeable, and Stahl and Daines (who appears to be 35 now) are unconvincing, at best.  Arnold attempts to carry the movie with standard action stunts and one liners, but there's no meat to this sandwich, folks.  The story is lame, and the characters are worse. The ending isn't a surprise to anyone familiar with the scifi genre, wherein surprise 'unhappy endings' abound.  If you can, avoid it at all costs. Personally, I hope Arnold doesn't come back for any future cinematic outings.  Not until he's gotten a better agent.",1,2,3,5 July 2003
Spider-Man," A good adaptation, but not quite amazing
","Spider Man is hurt by two words; 'What if?'  What if...James Cameron hadn't backed out.  What if...Wes Bentley had gotten the role?  What if...they had found someone who could write?  What if the guy who directed Darkman hadn't gotten anywhere near it?  All that aside... Spider Man was HELPED by a few other factors: Post-911 psyche of American audiences.  We wanted a feel good movie, and they gave us one. Next, Toby Maguire surprised me at how well he performed.  I never would've guessed this one.  Like Christopher Reeve, he came into a role no one thought he'd succeed with, and made it his own.  Overall, Spidey's an entertaining flick with SPECTACULAR special effects (CGI/ blue-screening a person in the swinging shots ain't easy, folks), but lacks a dynamic script.  It's not on par with the legends of comic-to- movie translations, Superman and Batman (the first films of each), but it'll do.",5,3,6,15 June 2003
The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers," I Think I Broke My Jaw...
","...gaping at this movie!  Gollum is easily the greatest CGI character of all time, flipping his digitally-created finger at the upcoming 'Incredible [Shrek]!'  Based on Tolkien's legendary books, the story is superior to mere scifi/fantasy trite.  The directing (by the amazing Peter Jackson) is beyond the ability of the English language to praise!  It's only too bad Peter Jackson will be snubbed by the Academy's disdain for scifi/fantasy in lieu of socialist dogma. The acting was simply wonderful, with Wood, Astin, Mortensen, McKellan, etc. surpassing anything in the history of scifi/fantasy!  I can't wait for the third installment!",9,0,0,15 June 2003
Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone," Classic
","How can you not root for Harry Potter?  In one scene, we establish him as the 2nd saddest child in cinematic history (the saddest being Charlie from Willy Wonka and the Chocolate Factory): seeing a kid drawing his own birthday cake in dirt.  My God, I was practically traumatized watching this. The first 30 minutes of child abuse was crushing my poor heart, and then the cake scene.  I honestly wouldn't have objected to Harry becoming a hatchet murderer at that point--you couldn't have made me side against him. So, to witness him go on and discover his roots in magic, and actually find happiness in that world?  I was all for it....but I still wanted to beat the tar out of the Dursleys.",6,0,1,15 June 2003
The Lion King," I'm Supposed To Hate Disney Movies...
","...but not this one.  The Lion King is Disney at its family-oriented BEST! This is one of its few films in recent decades that belongs with its classics!  The animation is great, the voice-acting superb, and the characters...well, quite animated!  Don't just rent this one, it's a keeper.",7,0,2,15 June 2003
The Shawshank Redemption," Proof That The Internet Can Be Misleading
","The notion that this movie belongs in the top 100 of anybody's list is simply retarded.  This B-movie with an A-movie list is standard, run of the mill, TV-movie-of-the-week fare.  How did it get this high?  What's wrong with the vast number of IMDB users that they would vote so highly in favor of such a piece of trite?  My theory: Tim Robbins is sending each of you a check.  That's the only explanation.  This movie offers nothing special: nothing different, nothing unique.  No great performances (a phoned-in Morgan Freeman performance akin to his 'Deep Impact' presidential performance), no graphic portrayals or stark realism of life behind bars--nothing. This movie achieves what few in history have done: it both sucks AND blows.",1,49,170,21 June 2003
Star Wars: Episode IV - A New Hope," Overrated
","I've never understood the fascination with this film.  The special effects aren't that impressive (simple mat-shots done on black-screen with inanimate objects) even by 70s standards (Superman's were far superior as they required matting a moving person).  The story is practically plaguiarized from Kurosawa's 'The Hidden Fortress'.  The characters play like a cheesy soap opera, with bad dialogue to match.  The only person in the film with onscreen charisma is Harrison Ford (which explains the directions of careers after the SW films).  The fascination that 'Warmongers' have had with this series of movies (this one, in particular)is beyond my meager understanding: It's obvious to anyone who isn't a sick freak obsessed with these movies that Lucas & co. made it all up as they went along (no epic master plotline as many mongers wish to believe--Lucas was on a journey with no destination), which left them with each successive production to try and write their way out of the box they'd previously written themselves into (luke i am your father-but you killed my father-only in a manner of speaking--what nonsense is that?).Sorry, gang.  I'm not drinking Lucas's KoolAid anytime soon.",3,3,17,15 June 2003
Gladiator," Proof of Hollywood's value to society
","This is what movie-making is all about!  No pc soapbox, no one trying to convince you to follow some socialist utopian agenda, just pure, undilluted storytelling!  And, Ridley Scott (screwed at the oscars) delivers with this cinematic masterpiece!Crowe is phenomenal as Maximus, the hero of the story.  Maximus is driven by an insatiable thirst for revenge, yet beneath that burns the love for the dream of Rome, shared by the former emperor (Harris).  But, Joaquin Phoenix (also screwed at the oscars) turned in one of the most disturbing portrayals of evil in moviedom.  Commodus (played by Phoenix) can't be purely hated--look at his upbringing.  But, his actions can ONLY be hated.  And, the threat he poses to his own people cannot be settled through talk or appeasement.  One cannot reason with insanity.  They are, by nature, unequivocable, and Maximus/Commodus portray these elements beautifully.The characters are believable, played perfectly, and the story is impeccably blended with action, drama, and even romance.  This is easily the greatest movie produced in the modern era!",8,0,1,11 May 2003
Jurassic Park," The Special Effects Masterpiece
","Jurassic Park was highlighted by its spectacular special effects.  It recharged the interest in big-budget special effects flix, and proved a simple hollywood rule: it doesn't have to be good, as long as it's good enough.The special effects in this movie cannot be challenged.  The perfect use of animatronics and CGI (it revolutionized the CGI industry in hollywood) is unsurpassed these 10 years later.  It sparked a million knockoffs, whether in genre (dino-movies) or special effects (every God-awful pixel of CGI puked out by the hollywood braintrust)-- for further info on bad CGI, be sure to catch the upcoming HULK movie). They remain some of the greatest (if not THE greatest) special effects in cinematic history.  The story, however, is pitifully inferior to the book.  The characters are unimportant in the movie, taking backseat to Steven Speilberg's Dino-F/X.  Jeff Goldblum's character, who was pivotal to the book (as he spoke for us, the reader), served no greater purpose than comedic value in this movie.  Thus, it garners the low rating of 6 stars I gave it.",6,3,6,11 May 2003
