It," Scary? Not for a second.
","Well, I read IT in 1988 and I was 14 years old...I remember that I had to sleep with the light on for more than 15 days ( it took my ten to read the whole BIG book). Tonight I went to the cinema with the same feeling of 'oh God it will be so scary and I like it!!'. But, sorry to say it didn't happen at all; just some cheap-thrills but definitely not the deep emotion that you feel in Alien (just to name it), not the uncomfortable feeling of The Exorcist. It's just an horror movie particularly well done and with a certain style. If you love the vintage Stephen King book it will be a massive delusion but you can always take out the original one form the drawer and read it!",7,3,4,22 October 2017
