Whip It," Lots of Fun
","I didn't know anything about roller derby until I saw this film, and really enjoyed learning about it. The actors are terrific, especially Juliette Lewis.The plot is pretty standard, though. Teenage girl feels an itch to get out from under her parents' expectations (although her father seems supportive and has a good sense of humour, her mother is a little more difficult to deal with. But also sympathetic, and well-portrayed). So the girl joins a daring, forbidden group, and grows in confidence, finding out a lot about herself. A coming-of-age sort of tale.Cinematically speaking, I could nit-pick, but that would be setting too high a standard for what is essentially a fun film about sports. The world can always use more uplifting films about young girls...",5,1,4,22 January 2011
The 13th Warrior," underrated film with a Moslem(!) hero
","As far as the swords and barbarians genre of movies goes, this is one of the smartest ones I've ever seen. (Even though the bad guys are goddess-worshipping, vicious decapitators. This seems like an unnecessarily mean-spirited dig at those who would romantically imagine that all goddess-worshippers are peaceful and admirable vegetarian types. On the other hand, every stereotype needs a good, sharp poke to deflate it now and then.) The film came to my attention when a university professor (can't remember the name) was on the radio talking about his two decades-long quest to find a film, any film, that had a positive Moslem character in it. He viewed hundreds of English-language films with Moslem characters, and found a grand total of two. The Thirteenth Warrior was one of them.I was also very impressed that they got the horses right. Such films NEVER get the horses right - but in this film, they ride exactly the type of horse that would have been found there at the time, even though they might look a bit funny, with big guys on little horses.",8,1,2,22 January 2011
No Country for Old Men," So Bleak, So Good
","Not sure if I can add much to the avalanche of reviews here, but I will offer my impression anyway.The Coen brothers are consistently good film-makers and I am definitely a fan. This one wasn't among my favourites, as I was hoping for a little more of their humour and a little less nihilistic bloodshed. No heroes, no respite from evil. But for what it is, it's very good.Makes me wonder if I want to read Cormac McCarthy... he's been very recommended to me, and I'm sure I will some day, but I don't need this unrelentingly dark a view of humans right now. I'd rather find something to lift my spirits.Hey Coen Bros, do a funny one next time!",7,4,6,22 January 2011
