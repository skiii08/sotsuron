Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," A Good movie, but should have been excellent.
",I felt the pod race was too long.  I think the movie and its plot will be better received after the next two films are released. The plot was too small for a movie.  For a man who should be making Star Wars because of his love of the story he sure includes a lot of commercialism and some of it detracts from the story.  The alien races seemed more childish than believable when compared to the first three stories.,7,0,0,6 July 1999
