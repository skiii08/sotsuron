Alien 3," Horrible
","Horrible is the word I would use to summarize this film in one word. This is one of the worst movies that I have ever seen. The only reason anyone would see this movie is to keep up with the series. However, you are not missing anything by not watching it. The film is way too dark and, not to mention, it is not entertaining at all. Director David Fincher's style does not fit the Alien series at all.",Null,2,5,4 August 1998
As Good as It Gets," One of the worst films of 1997
",As Good As It Gets has on of the most unbelievable endings ever in film. The only funny moment in the film is the beginning. The rest of the film  is surprisingly dark. James L. Brooks proves once again that he is the most overrated film maker working today. He wastes yet another one of Jack Nicholson's excellent performances.,7,2,4,30 July 1998
Alien: Resurrection," Let's hope this is the last of the Alien series
","I would like to warn all of you with weak stomachs, don't even think about watching this movie. This is, perhaps, the most violent movie that I have ever seen. I found it even more violent than Saving Private Ryan. Alien Resurrection is not interested in telling a story, the film seems only interested in grossing you out with unneccesary violence. Resurrection seems to be saying,'You thought that last scene was gross, this next scene is even more violent and gross.' Hopefully this is the last Alien film.",Null,1,1,5 August 1998
Saving Private Ryan," An Excellent Film
","Saving Private Ryan is one of this year's best films. Tom Hanks delivers an Oscar-caliber performance as Captain Miller. What I like most about this film is that it shows what war and violence are actually like. For this reason alone this is a film that should be seen by all. While the story is not the films strongest point, it still is very good. I have heard many critics say that the rest of the characters were all cliche, however, I did not see that. Jeremy Davies gives a performance that should win him an Oscar as an interpreter who is going into combat for the first time and the rest of the cast are superb. My only problem with the picture were it's present day scenes, I found them unnecessary.",Null,0,0,4 August 1998
Good Will Hunting," The Best Movie of 1997
","The premise of Good Will Hunting is one that has been played out in hundreds of other movies. This movie, however, exceeds all of those other movies with it's brilliant screenplay and fantastic acting. Matt Damon delivers a masterful performance as Will Hunting. He, along with Ben Affleck deservedly won the Academy Award for Original Screenplay. Robin Williams and Minnie Driver shine in their supporting roles as Will's psychiatrist and girlfriend. Good Will Hunting may be just another formulaic movie from Hollywood, but, it is done so well that you just don't care. It is a movie that brings a welcomed smile to your face.",10,1,4,29 July 1998
Schindler's List," The Greatest Film Ever
","The words 'The Greatest Film Ever' hardly describes Steven Spielberg's masterpiece about the Holocaust during World War II. This by far is Spielberg's crowning achievement. Schindler's List is, also, the most beautifully photographed film ever. It's black-and-white cinematography adds to the film's unreal authenticity. Liam Neeson, Ralph Fiennes, and Ben Kingsley add three of the greatest film performances ever. This is a film that everyone should watch.",10,9,13,29 July 1998
Amadeus," Masterful acting makes Amadeus a classic study in jealousy
","F. Murray Abraham deservedly won an Oscar for Best Actor for his portrayal of Antonio Salieri. Salieri is driven mad by his jealousy of Amadeus. Abraham captures Salieri's anger and jealousy perfectly. Tom Hulce is excellent as the great Amadeus. Milos Forman does a very good job directing, however, he tends to let the story drag along very slowly a couple of times.",Null,3,6,6 August 1998
Annie Hall," Surprisingly Good
","This was the first Woody Allen film that I ever saw. I fully expected to hate Annie Hall, due to the fact my mother told me that his movies are overrated pieces of rubbish. To my surprise I really enjoyed Annie Hall. It is one of the funniest films that I have seen in a long time. The reason I found Annie Hall incredibly funny was because of it's honest portrayal of relationships. One scene I found hysterical was the scene in which Allen and Diane Keaton are having a discussion about photography, while in subtitles we see what they are both thinking. Annie Hall deserved all the awards it won. I look forward to seeing more of Allen's films.",Null,1,2,15 August 1998
There's Something About Mary," The funniest movie of the year
","There's Something About Mary is one of the funniest movies I have ever seen and, also, one of the grossest movie that I have ever seen. It is the first movie to come along in years that delights in being politically incorrect, and that is one reason this movie is so funny. Cameron Diaz shines in the role of Mary, a girl who is the object of desire for every guy she meets. The only problem is that they all turn out to be crazy, creepy, and weird. Mary finds humor in places that never have been explored. Ben Stiller along with Matt Dillon and the rest of the cast give great performances. If want to laugh like you have never done before, There's Something About Mary is a don't miss.",Null,0,0,30 July 1998
Titanic," An incredibly beautiful film
","In Titanic the story is secondary to the film's fantastic photography and incredible visual effects. Titanic is easily one the most beautifully photographed films ever. While the story is rather slow in the beginning, it more than makes up for it in the last half of the film with the sinking of Titanic. Leonardo DiCaprio delivers the best performance in the film, while Kate Winslet does a good job with the little bit her character is given.",9,6,12,29 July 1998
Heat," A Truly Great Film
","Heat is masterful crime drama starring Al Pacino and Robert De Niro. Pacino plays a cop obsessed with always getting his man. De Niro is a lifetime criminal who leads a top notch crew of bank robbers, that includes Val Kilmer, Tome Sizemore, and Danny Trejo. Added to this is an unforgettable scene in a coffee shop between De Niro and Pacino, marking the first time they have appeared on screen together. While it's 164 minute running time may seem long for a film of this genre, there is not one unnecessary scene in this film. To the contrary, Heat leaves you wanting more.",Null,1,1,29 July 1998
Aladdin," Robin Williams' performance saves Aladdin
","Robin Williams does a fantastic job as the voice of the Genie in Aladdin. My one problem with Aladdin is how insulting it is to the viewer in the way it plays on stereotypes, something Disney has been getting away with too long. I find it rather strange that the only Arabian characters with Arabian accents were the villains, while the good guys all have American accents. For the most part Aladdin is a very enjoyable movie, due in large part to Williams. Most of the songs are very good and fun to listen to. The animation is beautiful as always.",Null,1,3,4 August 1998
