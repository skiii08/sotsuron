Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," Must-see for Star Wars fans
","If you're able to avoid the critics and just sit back and watch the movie, I have no doubt you'll enjoy it.  Take it for what it is:  A sci-fi, fantasy film for kids 15 and under...just like the first three installments!  Its a good idea to watch the first three (if you don't already have them memorized) before seeing The Phantom Menace, because some background knowledge will add to your understanding and enjoyment of the picture.  Of course the special effects were beyond imagination, but I don't think it took anything away from the story.  I've only seen it once, and I can't wait to see it again.  In fact, I'm ready for II and III!",8,0,0,20 May 1999
