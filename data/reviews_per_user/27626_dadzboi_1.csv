The Avengers," Gets you on the edge of you seats!
","My view on this movie is very simple. This movie is kind of a sequel to other Marvel movies. Avengers is a movie that brings 4 Marvel heroes together and they combine their supernatural powers to defeat the enemy. To get full effect of this movie the viewer must have watched 2-3 of the characters movies separately to get a view of the character and what their powers are. I would recommend this movie to all age groups, its a movie the family will love on a Friday night out. I would also say this film is a 'feel good' film, this is because as the ending of the movie turns out so well, the stress of the dilemma in the movie calms down at the end and leaves a triumph' feeling at the end. This movie would not be recommended to people who don't enjoy a fantasy theme. But it would be recommended to people who understand the powers they have. My opinion of this movie is that it is one of the best films i have seen,(i've seen a lot of movies) it is also a movie that can be watched over and over again. I don't have complaints about this movie other than its a very fast pace movie. I would recommend you all to see it in 3D or if you've missed it at the movies to buy it and make the most out of it because movies like these, don't come around a lot!!!Hope I helped, My regards to all, Yash Ahmed",10,15,30,3 December 2012
