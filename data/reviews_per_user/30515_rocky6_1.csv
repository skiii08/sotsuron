Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," Not a surprise
","After sitting through three Star Wars movies already, I guess it shouldn't surprise me that this one also put me to sleep. It is unbelievable that so many people actually think that these movies are interesting. Anyone who studies film or even cares to try can tell that all 4 of these films are poorly acted, poorly written, and mainstream. Also, there is nothing special about the special effects. I've seen better at a fireworks show. I've never seen worse screenplay in my life. Unfortunetly, too many people have been sucked into ' the force' and therefore have forgotten that there are other movies. For all of you out there reading this that don't like Star Wars, I commend you for not getting sucked in. For all of you out there that do, please GET A LIFE.",1,3,6,5 August 1999
