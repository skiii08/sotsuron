Raiders of the Lost Ark," Questionable taste
","I enjoy Raiders fine, but I watched it last night for the first time in over a decade and I was struck at how it seemed completely comfortable with the notion that it was all right for good guys and bad guys to run the lives and property of Arabs into the ground, all for the entertainment of westerners. I found that a bit unusual.",Null,1,2,11 November 2003
"Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon"," People Need To Quite Being So Jaded
","Boy, people sure are obsessing about the flying.  What's the big deal?  Too many are reacting with indignation either because it wasn't realistic or it isn't as good as OTHER Chinese films or it didn't QUITE live up to the hype.  That's your fault for having no imagination, becoming a Chinese film pedant, or paying attention to hype when that's a worthless endeavor.  Just watched it five minutes ago.  Fun, exciting, engrossing, gorgeous, a great movie.  Who cares if it was or wasn't worthy of Oscar nominations? The Oscars are hardly a yardstick of quality anyway, so why pay attention to them?  Who cares if it's not The Greatest Film In The History Of Cinema.  It was fabulous, simply fabulous.",Null,0,0,1 July 2003
From Hell," Not what it could be
","I figured I would be seeing a watered down version of Alan Moore's graphic novel, but instead I was disappointed to see that they completely changed characters,relationships, and tacked on a happy ending. Even worse, it was essential in the novel to know who Jack the Ripper was from the beginning in order for the action to work as an examination of the criminal - here it is turned into a cheap whodunnit. Furthermore, psychic phenomenon is dispensed of in the graphic novel - here, it is a cheap plot device. It seems obvious to me that the screenwriters did not understand what they were adapting.",Null,1,2,31 October 2004
The Last King of Scotland," Falls short of its promise
","300,000 Ugandans dead and we have to see the story unfold through the eyes of a Scottish jerk? Unfortunately, my intense dislike for that character only put me at arm's length from the story and made me care not one bit when he is strung up by his nipples at the end. In fact, I was sorry that so many Africans had to die, but this selfish idiot gets away. I understand that was partially the point of the film - it's bluntly stated at the end for those of us who might have missed it the same statements of intent earlier 혰 but it didn't service the suspense very well, especially since if you know anything about history, you already know how it will end 혰 and also because it's no great insight any longer that white people in Africa are condescending, horrible elitists who have little respect for the people of the continent. There has to be some more insight than a few toss off lines and some oblivious guy looking for adventure. I also would have appreciated walking out of it with more insight to Amin - unfortunately, the story unfolds through the eyes of someone who is naive and selfish, so he doesn't actually notice the horror for most of the film and when he finally does, it's in the form of a very confusing stylized scene that doesn't really serve much more of a purpose than to shock you with brutality. Yes, we GET Amin is brutal, but I also know there's more to the whole damn thing. This could have been a fascinating political and psychological study 혰 especially given Whitaker's fantastic performance 혰 but instead I found it diversionary but very shallow.",Null,1,5,16 March 2008
