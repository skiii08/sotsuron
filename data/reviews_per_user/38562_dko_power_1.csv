The Benchwarmers," Great Work!!
","Finally Allen Covert and Nick Swardson wrote a excellent script ,and the 'old' SNL cast together again, David Spade,Rob Schneider and Jon Lovitz, and excellent acting by Jon Heder and Nick Swardson!! a must see movie!! and Thanx to Adam Sandler. and Dennis Dugans directing is also excellent, one of the funniest movies i'we seen in a long time no doubt. Just wished that Allen Covert would had a small part in the movie to, And Nick Swardson A Bigger role in the movie, cause he is very funny, but he co-wrote the script so i guess he didn't wanna have a big role in this movie. excellent work guys, this almost beats 'grandma's boy'. so keep up the good work.",10,1,3,29 August 2006
