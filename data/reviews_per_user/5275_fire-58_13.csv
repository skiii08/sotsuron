The Devil's Advocate," Great film and fun to watch, all around greatness
","The entire time i was watching this movie i was entertained.I saw this movie in the 90's in theater and thought it was good then forgot about it, 14 years later see it at again.I love Al Pacino and he is such a versatile actor. Keanu reeves was in freakin every thing in the 90's, the pair was perfect.Any way so the plot of this movie is timeless. A man verse good and evil.He has a job where morals are in question all the time, and has everything pulling at his from all angles.I don't want to ruin it for you so thats all im going to say. If you have not seen this i would because it will take you by complete surprise!",Null,1,1,18 November 2011
The Notebook," Romance is the best way. Man i loved this movie
","I consider myself a manly man, with beard and all. I hate touchy feelie movies about romance and such, most of them or corny and over the top and just make you want to kill yourself.This movie was truly great. The raw passionate love that they shared reminds me of my wife and I. I love the Time is was set in. In most romantic movies the guy is kind of a nancy. The guy in this movie was perfect, a real man. IT really shows the heart of REAL people. In the end i did not know what to do, but hug my wife and thank god for her. I don't normally feel that way from any thing but this movie really expressed emotions to me. You have to watch this!",Null,0,1,7 November 2011
The Others," WOW WOW WOW. What a great movie
","So im a little late on this movie. It took me 10 years to see this . But im glad that i bought it because this is one of the best suspense movies i have ever seen.The plot was great! The cast was perfect. The house and the grounds in the movie was so good. What a great house.The movie moves perfect, not to fast or too slow.From start to finish it is great. Once you think you know what going on the story takes a huge leap.Its a thriller, its suspense, it has creepy British Kids. Nicole Kidman was made for this movie. Such a beauty and a very good actor.",Null,0,1,3 November 2011
Orphan," So So So Good- done very well
","I really liked this move it had every thing you could hope for and more.The movie played out with great timeIt kept my interest through out the whole thing i feel that the acting was very good and could not have thought of better people to play the parts. This movies is creepy on so many levels, it plays all of your emotionsOver all this whole movie was done very good i could not find any thing a matter with it.On one funny note on the DVD, there is this thing in the preview before the movie starts, saying that 'this is just a movie and real orphans are not bad'I think its really funny because they must think that the over all watchers of this movie are stupid and can not see the difference between fact and fiction.Thanks for believing in us!",10,1,2,29 December 2011
Zodiac," Movies like this don't come along very much
","I get tired of movies trying to keep your interest with something that is borderline interesting. THIS MOVIE WAS FREAKIN GREAT Im sitting there on the edge of my seat just driving my self crazy wanting to know what is about to happen. The movie had it all, great acting, great story great plot.I don't like movies that do the whole '3 years later' bit, but i have excused it in this case because it was part of the real story and not just an excuse for bad writing. I had heard of the story a lot when i was a kid but never knew that it was what it was, The case is still open to that makes it even better. I was a little worried this movie might suck, i mean look at what they did with the last helter skelter, it was alright i guess but not as good as it should have been.This movie was a total home run out of the park flick! You have to see it.",10,1,2,29 December 2011
American Psycho," Watch this one, you'll like it
","Sometimes i have a hard time staying interested in movies 100% while watching. But this movie kept my interest the whole time. Bateman was a great character, the cast was perfect. The story speed was perfect, not to slow not to fast.I wish every movie was like this, a good start, good middle and good ending, It seems like movies are missing one of these most of the time.I would not watch this movie around kids, but i would watch it.I want to watch it again in a few days to see what i might have missed. The period the film was set in was interesting, nothing exceeds like excess.",Null,0,0,2 November 2011
Bad Teacher," Not funny, corny, a real waste of time. Hollywood has givin up trying
","I gave this movie a 2 JUST because Cameron diaz was smokin hot in this movie.1. Not Funny Me and my stupid friends could have made up better jokes then who ever wrote this movie, i mean t was really really bad i don't think i laughed one time at all. The only thing funny about this movie was how bad the plot it.2. Plot not thought out So where is the plot of this movie? She needs money? oh shes a bad teacher, thats right.They were trying to make this movie float on shock value but it did not work.I wish i did not even spend a dollar on it at the red box.",2,10,16,24 December 2011
Enchanted," Very Impressed
","This move is so great. I wasn't expecting much from this movie but it takes a whole new spin on a fairy tale. IT kept me laughing the whole time. Disney movies seem to be all the same these days but this movie as really good. Amy Adams and Patrick Dempsey worked very well together. Amy Adams does a really good job as the lost princess. I like that they did it in New York City. I haven't been impressed with a Disney in a long time and my wife and me really enjoyed this one. This is good for the whole family. I wish I could have seen this one in the Theater. There were a lot of different people in this movie that played very well together. I had never heard of this movie until I pick it up at the store, I am really happy I got to see it.",10,1,1,6 July 2009
The Number 23," there are 23 other movies you should watch
","I really did not like this movie, maybe because i grew up watching jim carry play goofy roles and i can not take him seriously.I thought about killing myself 23 times turning this movie, it was really bad. I did not find it the lest bit scary. the person the wrote this movie smoked 23 joints while writing.I will say the story is really original, i will give it that, but i found it kind of hard to follow and boring. I can see how some people might thing this is a master piece but its not really for me i guess2 times i wanted to turn it off 3 times i did = 231 time i watched it 22 times i will not recommend it =23 OMG!",3,0,2,29 December 2011
The Descent," original movie idea, really good. For the most part
","I gave this movie a 7 because it did have a very original story i liked a lot of things about this movie besides a good plot the location where the filmed it was really good in this day and age Hollywood is putting out some pretty crappy stuff where people just talk and move from room to room, but in this movie they go out in to the world and do something. i was super shocked when the filmed developed about half way through I expected the movie to be stupid and it turned out to be a great flick i have not seen the sequel to this movie but i really want to now super good movie, even with the British people in it lol I think that you should watch it for sure, i think that this is a thriller and a horror in one, it was great",7,0,1,3 February 2012
The Silence of the Lambs," Classic, Must see.
","This movie has been a classic since it came out. It is smart and clever and a little sexy at times. I think that this movie has had much influence on other movies after it. IT is very 80s, the fashion and such though it came out in 1991 there is still a very 80s feel to it. When this movie came out i was not old enough to go see it. They use to not let kids see movies that were not OK for them, even with a parent. When this movie came out it was HUGE. Every now and then i like to bust this movie and Alfred Hitchcock's 'psycho' The perfect pair! I would also recommend A movie Called 'American psycho' To watch With this movie",Null,1,1,5 July 2012
Identity," Very good story, cool ending
","When i started the movie i was no impressed at all.I only started to like the movie at the half way point. If you can make it to the have way point it gets a lot better. Maybe i judged the start to harshly but it just seemed hard to watch for a while.John cusack is a good actor. he can play so many different parts. He is one of the only actors that can do funny, serious and every thing. I am a fan of him.The ending will take you by surprise for sure. I watch a lot of movies and can most of the time guess the ending but i never saw this ending coming not by a long shot.Good Watch.",7,0,0,24 November 2011
Jackie Brown," Very Cool Movie. Well done. Watch it you Jive Turkey
","I like this movie. There are some funny moments and there are some really cool moments. De Niro has a very interesting character in this movie, most of his roles are very in your face.He has a very mild personality in the start then you see him shine at the end. I love the way this movie is ends. It shows what happens from different views.The blond girl that smokes all the dope is fun to watch ;) This is a very good movie and i would watch it. If you like mob and crime and such, this is right up your ally. Now go watch it you JIVE TURKEY!",Null,0,0,4 November 2011
