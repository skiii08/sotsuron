The Expendables 2," 'I'm Back'
","If you're looking for an exciting action movie, look elsewhere. If you are a fan of comic book movies and have fond memories of 80's action flicks, you will be entertained.I'm glad Norris got his camera time, but I wouldn't be disappointed if he was not in the next one. It would have been nice for Li's character to have more time as his fight scenes are always entertaining. Statham and Van-Damm showed off their skills. Stallone, Willis, and Schwarzenegger were entertaining yet showing their age. I think Couture is doing pretty good crossing over from fighting to acting.Some of the blood effects were a little over the top for my taste, but other than that I really liked the movie.",8,2,5,29 August 2012
Brave," An 'anti-princess'
","Fairy tales are traditional and nobody messes with tradition, right? Price Charming wins the hand of the fair princess and they live happily ever after. But Merida is a tomboy at heart with red unruly hair who loves riding horseback through the woods mastering an archery course. And the princes from the neighboring clans are far from charming. So of course Merida seeks out a spell to change tradition and of course the spell goes all wrong. In the end, the real question isn't will they live happily ever after but who will learn from the experience.I am so glad Disney has created another 'anti-princess' like Mulan. Not all girls have to love pink and fancy dresses. Some can wield swords or bows and fight for what's right.There are a couple intense scenes that some may be sensitive too.",10,7,15,2 October 2012
The Adjustment Bureau," I wouldn't classify it as sci-fi
","The Adjustment Bureau works behind the scenes arranging people's fate. But David Norriss wants to control his own fate. He manages to catch the Bureau in the act of 'adjusting' his fate and is threatened to never speak of it and to stay away from a woman he has just met. The Bureau attempts to enforce this separation but Norriss avoids them and foils their varied efforts.I was expecting a sci-fi thriller, but instead found romantic and religious mush. Was it a stab at the Greek gods, God, a debate personified, or the visual musings of the existence of any supreme being. It really wasn't worth my time or money.",1,3,4,19 September 2012
300," Lots of effects, but that's about it
","300 tells you a little about Spartans and how they are selected and trained as warriors. King Leonidas takes 300 of the best warriors to fight the Persians supposedly against the wishes of the Oracle.There is no character arc and little story at all. It's war with lots of visual and sound effects of slicing, dicing, and blood splatter. There were some scenes that I found disturbingly weird like the Persian king's harem tent.If you're into movies for special effects, you might like it. If you like movies for the characters and storyline, you probably won't. I personally would not recommend this to my friends.",1,5,10,14 December 2012
