Requiem for a Dream," If you want your kids never to do drugs, show them this movie.
","If you are a parents, and you're fighting or about to bring up the topic about drugs, show them this movie! This movie will show you the lengths and hardships people go through to get their quick fix. Your child just might be like Jared Leto's, Marlon Wayan's or Jennifer Colloney's character a junkie without even knowing it. This movie will shock you and is disturbing to watch. It's a sad story to watch unfold, there is no happy ending in Requiem For A Dream, and there shouldn't be because that just wouldn't make any sense. The fast cuts and the soundtrack mixed together take you for one wild ride in your seat as you watch this epic drug film. View at your own risk. If you can handle the rush.",8,0,1,6 December 2004
