Requiem for a Dream," Most painful movie I've ever seen
","Brutal, upsetting, wounding movie making. You will remember this movieÂ… Like you remember being punched in the face.  It gives no answers and unlike a classical tragedy there are no obvious weaknesses that these characters could have overcome to avert this tragedy.  If you or anyone you know is in danger of becoming addicted to Heroin this is the movie to show them. Watching this movie is to drugs what Scared Straight is to crime but with the VOLUME ALL THE WAY UP.  This movie is as intense as any that I have ever seen. It should come with a warning label. Some folks will need therapy just to deal with the trauma of having watched it.I can't bring myself to condemn this movie, if it de-glamorizes heroin use, its probably worthwhile, but think twice before you see it. It will probably ruin your mood for much more than a night.",6,1,2,7 August 2001
The 13th Warrior," Eminently watchable
","This is a cut above your typical adventure movie. This is a tale about 13 Warriors sent to defend a Viking village from an ominous and mythical threat that `cannot be named'. Antonio Banderas plays the 13th Warrior, a banished Arab poet cum ambassador who gets drafted into the expedition declaiming all the while... 'I am NOT a warrior'The movie is also interesting in that he's the lone Muslim amid this sea of Valhalla spouting Vikings. Add in the bear cult of their mysterious foes and this movie is an interesting from a comparative religions sense as well.",7,0,1,25 December 2001
A Walk to Remember," A mostly successful adaptation of a very romantic book
",Just read the book and decided it was time to re-watch the movie. It was better than I recalled.The original story was the recollections of a fifty-something man recalling his coming of age and the role that a dying girl played in that. I'll freely admit that the book required some updating to make it accessible to a wider audience and for the most part the updates were handled well.The addition of Jamie's numbered list of goals was great. As was most of the astronomy side-story. Even the beginning initiation sequence with Landon's crew jumping from the tower fit well in characterizing Landon.However the roaring 20's play was cringe-worthy at best. I can't understand why it was used. The original contained a religious play and I can see where that might not play with today's movie going audience but the student written musical that replaced it was just terrible.Overall the movie was well worth watching but I'll have to fast forward through the school play scenes if I watch it again.,8,0,0,7 March 2011
