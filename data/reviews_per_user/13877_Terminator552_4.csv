Borat: Cultural Learnings of America for Make Benefit Glorious Nation of Kazakhstan," It doesn't get much funnier than this!
","This movie is disgusting, vulgar, racist, graphic, and crude in every sense. And it couldn't be any funnier.Sacha Baron Cohen plays Borat, a reporter from Khazakhstan (sorry if I spelled that wrong) who travels to the U.S. to learn about American culture, and of course, marry Pamela Anderson. A ridiculous plot, I have to say, but somehow, it works.The interviews are the best part of the movie. Just listening to the questions he asks are so hilarious, and if you want to see more of these interviews, be sure to check out Da Ali G Show. But the scene that made me gasp for air was the nude scene halfway into the movie. It was disgusting in every sense, but you have to admit, fat naked people are funny.What I didn't like about the film was the near-constant racist remarks. I admit that they are funny, but it soon becomes to be too much. I think that if Cohen was not actually Jewish, he would not have gotten away with all of his jokes in the movie.Other than that, Borat is a must-see comedy. Unfortunately, I was not able to catch it in theaters, but it is just as good on DVD. If you have not seen Borat yet, walk, no, RUN now to your nearest video store before all the nerds take the last copies.A must-see, and strongly recommended to purchase.P.S. I read that a 'Borat 2' is in the works. 'High five!'",9,6,11,13 March 2007
Spider-Man 3," Good but not Great
","Spider-Man is the highest grossing comic-book-to-movie franchise in history, so we all knew it was inevitable that we were going to see sequel after sequel. After I saw the third installment, a friend of mine told me that a Spider-Man 4, 5, and 6 were being planned. And then I realized...this series is only getting dragged out for money. The story took a backseat.Spider-Man 3 is a fairly good movie, don't get me wrong, but there is nothing new or ridiculously exciting here. I feel like I've seen all of the dude's moves and I've seen the action sequences before. The cinematography is good but not any different than the other movies and none of the scenes really jumped out. It just didn't cut it for me.Anyways, Peter Parker is back as Spider-Man, and we see that his life is back on track. He's in school, he saves people, and he's dating that 'what's her name' chick. Life is good. But a movie would suck if nothing happens, so sh*t happens here. Now we have three bad guys going after him: Harry Osbourne as the Goblin dude, the Sandman, and Venom. You would think that all these villains makes the movie more interesting, but all it does is make it into a bigger mess. Too many plots are going on and the movie is just too long. It's funny because during the movie (about 2 hours in), I'm thinking 'God, wrap it up already!' When I went to Grindhouse and it finished (after about 3 hrs. 40 minutes), I'm thinking 'God, why wasn't it longer?' Spider-Man 3 just didn't hold my full interest.Plot aside, the action sequences are very good. Some of them look like graphics from a video game, and some look fantastic. They are exciting but like I said before, nothing really different when being compared to the other Spider-Man movies. One thing that I really hated about this movie was the cheesy dialogue. I mean, some scenes were very bad. You had to go to 'The School of Screenwriters and Cheese' to write some of these lines. But that's the thing with most superhero movies, so just enjoy it for what it is.In my opinion, I really think Spider-Man 2 was a better movie. It was more organized and more interesting. Nevertheless, this movie will not disappoint fans of the series and it definitely won't disappoint at the box office. I recommend this movie and I also recommend showing up early (it will be PACKED....GUARANTEED).7.5 out of 10 (I put 8 because I felt generous and rounded up).",8,0,0,6 May 2007
Grindhouse," Like Nothing You've Ever Seen
","I got the chance to see GRINDHOUSE last night (Sunday after its release) and I really enjoyed it. But before I get to the review, here are a few warnings you should consider before seeing this spectacle:1) The whole show (with trailers, movies, everything) is about 3 hours, 35 minutes (with no intermission). If you decide to see this, do your body a favour by NOT buying the 200 oz. cup of soda. 2) Don't come into this movie expecting something logical, smart, or intelligent. These movie are plain stupidity, but that's what makes them fun. If you think otherwise, you will be disappointed. 3) I have never seen a movie this gory and violent before (or in a really long time). If blood makes you squeamish, stay at home.Now, to the review.First the trailers start. Among the trailers for real movies that are coming out, a Grindhouse trailer is shown (there was a Grindhouse festival before, and I guess this trailer won). The movie was so intelligently named 'Hobo with a Shotgun'. It was the stupidest premise for a movie, but I laughed and it was pretty 'Grindhouse-authentic'. After the 30 million trailers (it felt like that anyways), the feature presentation starts...or does it? We now come across another trailer (a fake one) for a movie called 'Machete'. This one was also funny, and a nice start to GRINDHOUSE. Now the movies start.The first flick of the Rodriguez/Tarantino double bill is PLANET TERROR. It is basically a super-gory zombie movie with typical thrills and chills and the odd funny joke. Look for DEATH PROOF director Quentin Tarantino as 'Rapist #1' (near the end of P.T.). I found this movie to be enjoyable, but it isn't very logical and there are a lot of 'missing reels' in this one. And it was authentic like all typical grindhouse movies (the picture was scratched and the film sizzled from time to time). As well, the script was solid and the visuals were great, so it's definitely a fun ride.Next up are the fake trailers, which are kind of like a small intermission if you really had to go to the bathroom (few people did). The trailers were a nice touch to the show, and I really liked the trailer for 'Thanksgiving' (it's mentally messed up, but I have to say, it was so stupid and gross it was damn funny). Other trailers included 'Don't' and 'Werewolf Women of the SS'. And with that, the next feature begins.I was waiting for this one. I am a big Tarantino fan, and I have already read the scripts for the GRINDHOUSE features, so I had an idea of what to expect. From reading the script, I felt disappointed, but watching the movie got my faith back. Quentin Tarantino's DEATH PROOF is about a deranged killer named Stuntman Mike who finds women, stalks them, and then kills them with his car (sounds awful, but it really is fun to watch). Now this movie clearly has a lot less gore than PLANET TERROR, but it has a fantastic car chase that you can't afford to miss. Although I have to say, the car collisions in this movie are graphically epic (especially the first one, jeez!). Again, look for Tarantino to make a cameo as Warren, the bartender. Tarantino is a master of dialogue and he proves it here, but the dialogue scenes are too long and take a little bit away from the movie. But it builds up to the chase sequence and it makes it all worth while.In conclusion, GRINDHOUSE is a great show (if that's what you're into; if you're not, you're going to hate it). It's got guns, sex, drugs, and an abundance of nudity. It's violent and inappropriate in every way, and shows Tarantino and Rodriguez at the top of their game. The trailers are a nice touch, and if you're into the movies, it really doesn't feel excruciating sitting through this 3 hour 35 minute epic. If you have a taste for blood and hours upon hours to kill, GRINDHOUSE is definitely for you.",8,1,4,9 April 2007
300," 'Gladiator' + 'The Matrix' = Cool Combination
","I saw the movie '300' last night, and to me, it was the best movie of 2007 so far. If, perhaps you decide to see this movie, please ensure you see it at a theater with a massive screen and with great sound. Or perhaps, you want to take it another step further and see the IMAX experience. Either way, you'll want to see this one.The plot is simple: King Leonadas and his Spartan army of 300 are left no option but to defend Sparta from being taken over by the Persian army, consisting of a million soldiers. The Spartans decide that the only way to win (or kill as many as possible) is to wedge the Persians into a small gateway in the mountains so they can't get surrounded. There's more to the story than that, but that's all you really have to know.'300' is truly a guy movie. The beginning is somewhat slow, but halfway through until the very end, it's just non-stop, graphic, brutal violence. Not that I'm complaining, I liked it. What makes the violence bearable and not over the edge is the fact that none of it is real; all of the blood and gore is computer generated, making it look more comic-book than 'Saving Private Ryan' this-is-what-the-insides-of-a-human-actually-look-like graphic imagery. And it's more cool than disgusting. You become desensitized to the violence, and say 'Well, they already killed thousands...What's wrong if this half-naked guy kills another 1,500?'What puts asses in the seats for this movie really is the visual effects and cinematography. I remember two or three shots that really made the movie: they were 60 second, slow-motion, uncut shots during the battle sequences that reminded me of the bullet-time shot used in 'The Matrix'. Those shots alone made me want to watch the movie again; the choreography was just awesome. As I was saying before about seeing '300' in a good theater, the sound was very good and a huge screen would be appropriate for watching this major spectacle. Another plus is that the new trailers for 'Grindhouse' and 'Spider-Man 3' appear before the film. So in the end, everybody wins.My recommendation: if you love blood and guts and 'Gladiator' or 'The Matrix' are one of your favorites, you have to see this gore-fest. If you're in the mood for a passionate, provocative, intelligent thriller with a fantastically good script, stay home and rent Borat or something.",8,0,4,15 March 2007
