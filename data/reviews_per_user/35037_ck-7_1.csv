Antz," very entertaining!
","This is one of the best movies I have seen lately.  Antz is extremely entertaining, and the visual is just simply great.  Some say the movie is a little slow, but I think the pace is excellent. I didn't find one frame of boring film.  The story is simple, and I think simple is a good thing that many overlook.  Woddy Allen is great, the character Ant Z is just perfect for him.  Overall, the movie is fun and humorous,it potentially has something deeper to say but it didn't come out quite clearly.  You sense that this is something like Animal Farm by George Orwell, but the message is blurred and was paid little attention to. This is not exactly a movie for childern, but as for teens and adults, you will find seeing this movie as one of the most fun and relaxing experience.",10,0,0,24 October 1998
