The Blair Witch Project," Boring As Hell
",I watched this expecting a good movie since i'd read a lot of the reviews. I sat for 1 hour and 20 mins and it felt like forever. Nothing interesting at all happens just people with cameras whining. You see nothing and there is no actual proof of the witch so it could just be a human playing a prank. Do yourself a favour and miss this one.,1,5,13,8 September 2019
