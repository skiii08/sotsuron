Come and See," The most brilliantly disturbing and emotional movie i've ever seen
","I have to say that when I was watching this film I felt sick to my stomach and almost felt the urge to leave, but it was so well put together that I just couldn't take my eyes off of the screen. I have never been a fan of any kind of war violence movies but this one was so different. It made me feel as if I was really there experiencing the entire thing. Klimov's directing was just amazing. So brilliantly done that it has impacted the way I look at war in general. I love how Klimov made the beginning at an easy going pace showing bits of happiness and joy, but then the movie took a complete turn and became so disturbing and outrageous. I had my hand over my mouth and my eyes began to water at times and I just kept thinking about how horrible everything that was happening to this poor boy was. I kept thinking about how sad it is that humans are capable of doing such horrible things and after the movie I felt really distraught and sad. These feelings carried on until the next day and I even had nightmares from watching it. It is really hard to find a movie that can impact you so greatly in that way and Klimov nailed it!",9,1,1,10 December 2010
