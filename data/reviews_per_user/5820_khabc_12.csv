Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," A Complicated Story, but once u understand it, u realise the magic of Star Wars!!!!!!!!!
","Dear readersBeing the prequel to the Greatest ever Movie Series can be a very difficult task because people will have huge expectations & each and every scene of the movie will be observed under a microscope, i.e. any minor mistake will be caught.This will magnify even very minor mistakes.   I am neither going to say that the movie is great or bad .... nor i am going to give any description on its story. i am sure all of u have seen this movie.The movie has great characters (queen,anakin,darth maul,obi-wan etc.).The story has a meaning and u really need to see and understand the movie carefully. If u haven't, then following are the reasons why u should see this movie:1)it creates a sense of imagination in your mind.It takes u away from your everyday life and makes u realise that there is something else then just this planet. The movie makes you feel happy .2) The movie spreads the most important message in life : 'there is always a temptation to follow the easiest route in life ,but one must make sure that the route u follow should harm the life of anyone else. I mean lets be honest, every person has a dark side .But one must overcome his/her greed.Its true that are many people out there who don't have what they want the most, but it doesn't give u the right to blame others for it.Sometimes the luck isn't on our side.But remember that if u escape the dark side of life then u will die happily, without any regrets.3)Star Wars instills the faith that there is something supernatural in this world and the bad guys will always lose in the end.The movie encourages you to be on the good side of life.4)One of the good things about the 'star wars trilogy & Phantom Menace' is, that it gets you involved in the story and that makes it easier for u to understand the difference between the dark side and the good side.The movie is like a story that fires your imagination.5)It also says that unity is important for survival.Most modern movies are based on a super hero saving the world or rescuing a hijacked plane ,bus etc , BUT in Star Wars its Different. After u see the movie u will realise that although Luke Skywalker and Obi Wan Kanobi had the supernatural powers , they couldn't save the people single handedly.They needed the help of normal guys like Hansolo ,the rebel members,the water species etc.6) one of the best things of star wars is, that its background music relates to the story in a brilliant manner.The movie is well made and well acted.The characters are well portrayed.The locations and the creativity(like the Revolving Senate) are truly fantastic.In the end ,the answer to the question'how good the movie is?' depends on how well u understand it.Mean while , May the Force be with U , Always....khabc",10,11,15,1 May 2001
Raiders of the Lost Ark," as good as it gets

I am sure all youngsters have Indiana jones hidden in them somewhere in their heart. Its simply a joyful ride.It is the definition of a Classic Blockbuster Movie.",10,0,1,31 December 2007
Rang De Basanti," RDB : A True Masterpiece : In a class of its own
","Ladies & Gentlemen Aamir Khan's Lagaan may have narrowly missed the Oscar ( because of 'No Man's Land' Political storyline),, but The circle is complete. His 'Rang De Basanti' can & will sweep all the awards this year.A brilliant movie with a brilliant message. The movie is flawless. It has great background music , great acting (led by Aamir himself), realistic & original storyline ,great cinematography,direction...the list can be endless.It is soul-stirring movie. It is and will always be a CULT Classic.Take a bow: Indian Movies have come of age and in great style.",10,0,2,6 September 2006
The Fifth Element," Its a movie ,full of fun.
","hello again
i have seen the fifth element quite a few times ,but i never stop enjoying seeing it. The futuristic movie has the traditional storyline:'saving the planet' , but it is well made.Bruce Willis and Milla Jovovich are great together. The catchy thing about this movie is the concept of 'Supreme Being'.  The role is well portrayed by Milla.The movie is also good for sci-fi lovers (cars moving in air, food supplied in air by a small boat ,etc.).the picturisation of the movie is good.
Its a must see movie.Enjoy!!!!!khabc",10,0,1,16 December 2000
Blade," One of the best pure-action movies ever
","hi
Blade is an sensational action movie . the hero (Wesley Snipes) and the villain  have done justice to their roles.The movie's action sequences are better then Matrix! Wesley Snipes is one the best action heroes ever.If u like action/vampire movies , this is the ONE.the theme is pretty good considering the fact that so many vampire movies have been made before.But these is the best of them.Enjoy the Ride.",9,0,1,23 May 2001
Star Wars: Episode II - Attack of the Clones," great stuff
","hey guys
Now .. this is wht u call a good movie. It has a good story. Great dialogues with a very deep meaning(except for a few ordinary ones).The prequel trilogy is definitely getting to an extraordinary finish.The actors are good and the background music is excellent and the scenes are one of a kind.No wonder ...STAR WARS is the most popular movie franchise ever.",10,1,2,11 December 2003
The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring," a over-hyped film...one of those popcorn movies
","hey guysI have had enough of these lord of the rings. The movie is ok. But some how the media is hyping it up to the sky.  But honestly .,,its just another fantasy adventure.And please.....don't even think of comparing the LOTR trilogy with STAR WARS.  STAR WARS is an all time classic. It created an imaginary world for everyone who has seen it. Its just that the media were jealous of STAR WARS's success and so they try to give bad reviews about good movies like 'the phantom menace' & 'attack of the clones'. Actually episode I & II are movies with very exciting storyline. Its awesome.
Coming back to LOTR...... all i would say is that 'it is just one of those normal popcorn movies.'",1,6,14,11 December 2003
Resident Evil," kool!!!!!!!!!
","Heyy , this was good suprise. The movie is much better than i had expected.
The movie is about a virus which disrupts a company 's functioning and threatens the people working over there. Its an excellent film. It keeps you on the edge of the seat all the time. Milla Jovovich is amazing as usual.She is a very good actress.Its a must see for all those Sci-Fi fans.",9,0,0,5 May 2002
The Twilight Saga: Breaking Dawn - Part 2," Splendid effort!!!!!!!!!
","First of all, 'Breaking Dawn Part 2' is the best twilight movie. In fact, if you consider its photography, performances, effects, action, music etc. its a hugely entertaining movie even for the 'non-twilight' audience.Secondly, for all those romantics out there, its an awesome ending to the series.The lead pair have acted well. The supporting actors are also good. The new vampires are very interesting.I won't give out too many details. Its better that everybody watches this blockbuster in the cinema.Well worth every penny of the ticket price!!!",9,3,6,26 February 2013
3 Idiots," A Timeless Classic.....
","This is how a movie is supposed to be made.It is a story about three students and how their college experiences and friendship shape up their values of life. The movie has great storytelling, Good music, Perfect Humour, Very good Acting and a superb message.All in all a perfect blend of humour, emotions, philosophy, friendship, love and cinematography.Had this movie been released in multiple languages at the same time, it would have ended up being among the top 5 blockbusters of all time in the world.Take a bow!!!",10,1,1,8 October 2019

Braveheart," AWESOME MOVIE: ONE FOR AGES!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
","Braveheart is a story of a person who belongs to history. Its a true story  and it shows the importance of 'Freedom ' in our life.William Wallace and Joan of Arc are two people who should be the idol of every human being. The story shows how brutal the British used to be , but now things have changed . I am glad that England has changed .Mel Gibson has performed with authority and dignity.  He is certainly one of the best in the business,  and he deserves an oscar for this performance. The same can be said for Milla Jovovich in Joan of Arc.   Both are my favourite actor and actress respectively.Braveheart is a tribute to the Scots, who fought for their freedom .   The movie is directed in an intelligent manner. The background music is magical (it touches ur heart).Hats off to William wallace and his fellow countrymen.",10,1,2,29 September 2000
