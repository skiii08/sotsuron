Black Swan," Pretentiously stylistic director gets found out in 'lack of depth' bust.........
","Aronofsky couldn't direct depth and emotion if it fell from the sky and pirouetted in front of him All style, no substance (which suited Pi), and very much self indulgent (which suited The Fountain). Black Swan is as shallow as Requiem For a Dream (completely over rated). Aronofsky's continued pilfering of his beloved Tsukamoto continues, with BS helping itself largely, also, to Satoshi Kon's outstanding anime Perfect Blue.The sexual nature of BS was trite, at best. Vincent Cassel criminally misused. Portman was okay, but a million miles away from best performance of say Jennifer Lawrence in Winter's Bone. At least Clint Mansell provided again - but a good soundtrack does not maketh a good film.That was your last chance for a slow dance Aronofsky.you tourist.",Null,0,1,16 August 2011
Hostel," time to grow up.....
","okay ...enough is enough. feel let down by this pretentious and hollow film. Eli, i had so much hope as well. Even think Cabin Fever at least stayed true to its roots. I know people will love this film {gorehounds and/or teenagers} but come on... the film is truly sensationalist and very shallow. See Neil Marshalls attempts at horror. I'm sick of Americanised so-called horror movies. no originality, just rip-offs of {usually eastern} horror done before. Have you seen Suicide Circle then Eli ? Whats with the thriller ending as well, the American dodging/chasing around Slovakia... Jesus man. And the first half seemed to mock the American attitudes towards Europeans. Do you believe in your characters Eli? The portrayals of Amsterdam and, more so, Bratislava was disgustingly inaccurate - was this the point. Then if so, why such a conflicting ending. Come on people, lets wake up... there's better horror out there {Switchblade romance/calviere for the serious or dog soldiers/brain dead for the tongue in cheek etc etc}... Hostel is simply not good enough ... and i really did expect great things {10 seconds and 1 sentence from Miike as well}. At least the kids in the row ahead of me liked the separate gore scenes.... PS. Whats with the 'is slovakia a real country?'.... 'Its part of a country called Czechslovakia {correct spelling}'.... are people this stupid ? .... please let me know.
