The Avengers," booooooring
","some fun moments but...way too long way too much of everything! when nothing matters. when nobody is vulnerable. why the h-ll should we care.if it wasn't for the glimpses of comic relief this movie would be unwatchable i hope the kids disagreethis is meant to be a matin√©e, not Lawrence of Arabia epic - it just doesn't have that depth!if Hollywood was famous for one thing, it was keeping things lean and mean. this is neither.the opening sequence makes absolutely no sense. like David Mamet said, cut the first reel and we would still be fine. this is more than true in this film.",3,36,160,23 April 2012
Sucker Punch," style over content
","I feel almost ashamed having paid to see this movie. And I even brought my thirteen year old son and his friend. Needless to say, we were all bored beyond words.This is a catastrophe of a movie. A true example of a director with no sense of emotional storytelling and who instead relies completely on his talent and love for special effects and CGI.It's a disgrace to the audience.It's pointless.It's boring.During the screening my son leaned over and whispered 'Dad, they should make a video game of this movie.' The director may have brought us the original 300, but this shows us that he has a lot to learn of the masters. Could somebody please tell him to stop writing.And please have somebody tell him that shots in slow motion makes things slow.",1,15,32,18 April 2011
Gone Girl," Too smart for its own good
","The talented Fincher has done it again. A smart, well made and sterile tour de force example of filmmaking.Based on the best selling novel, the script is slick and thrilling - making unexpected twists and turns - up until it falls flat on its face.It's just too smart for its own good.There's a point towards the later part in the story where credibility flies straight out of the window. The smart becomes ridicules.Had it not been for the director's superb technical directing, this film would have ended up in the bargain bin.I don't care how smart you think you are, if the your characters suddenly don't respond realistically to the events it just doesn't matter.Strangely enough, I had a very good time watching it though.",6,11,43,30 September 2014
