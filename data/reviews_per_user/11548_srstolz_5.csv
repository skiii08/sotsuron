Borat: Cultural Learnings of America for Make Benefit Glorious Nation of Kazakhstan," not bad but needs an editor
","Cohen comes up with some superb scenes here-- the 'polite' Southern racists who live on Secession Drive (really!), the wrestling match, and of course the religious scene near the film's end-- but the film is unfocused and often playing for little more than body-humour laughs. Cohen's very thoughtful satire makes the familiar very foreign, but troubling questions remain: skewering people who don't speak English and who have no experience with the uber-irony of Western media (the film's unwitting Romanian village stand-ins for Kazakhstan) lowers the bar hugely, and there is the cardinal offense of attaching a moral to the ending of the film. Fun, but Cohen could certainly do better.",7,1,6,25 November 2006
The Hangover," A good early post-Bush film
","After the self-centered yee-haw ride of 2000-2008, America wakes up with a massive hangover, looming doubt about the future, and some confusion about what has just happened. Gambling debts? Whoring? Destroying stuff you can't pay for? Getting mixed up with the wrong people? Stealing? Yup, that's what happens when the American middle class mixes the right amount of tradition and cheap oil-- err, I mean, whiskey and chemicals, as do the characters in this film.Four guys-- a nerd, his brother (the groom), a teacher and a dentist-- go to Vegas for a bachelor party. Three wake up to find the groom missing. He has been replaced with a tiger and a chicken. Quest/hilarity ensue. The film's main theme might well be that when the social order-- here, marriage-- is followed out of mere obedience to tradition, it is sterile. The film's ending tries to give that order some kind of organic counterpart--the party, and the wedding music-- and largely succeeds.Fun that's smart, crude and frequently oddly touching. One of the better recent comedies and a fairly new entry in its genre. Take a boy/girl to this one. And, yes, ladies, this *is* what happens at bachelor parties. At least the ones we dream about.",9,3,6,15 June 2009
Inglourious Basterds," Inventive but unsatisfying
","Tarantino's technically in full form here-- the sly editing, quirky dialogue, subtle suspense, endless film references etc-- but the story is ultimately a hollow revenge fantasy that, like his Kill Bill series, doesn't really add up to much.Superficially, it's great-- funny, violent, unusual-- but as a revenge story and a commentary on war, it's empty. There are dangling endings, characters minus any kind of depth, an odd lack of any kind of emotional texture to the proceedings. Where Reservoir Dogs and Pulp Fiction perfectly balanced real characters with a witty, unpredictable and allusive story, Tarantino here simply comes off as playing games.",6,13,25,12 September 2009
No Country for Old Men," The Western is most certainly not dead
","Cormac McCarthy finally gets a movie worthy of him. Astonishing performances (esp. from Josh Brolin and Javier Bardem) and absolutely masterful cinematography mix with a deceptively simple narrative. Indeed, Bardem at times reaches the level of Hopkins as Hannibal Lecter in his character's creepiness. This film is like a much blacker Fargo. The Coens wonderfully use Texan slang ('It's a mess, ain't it?' asks one character, to which Tommy Lee Jones' replies 'If it ain't, it'll do till the real one gets here.') for various purposes--building tension, playing with ideas, relieving tension.McCarthy's recurring question, which was front and center in All The Pretty Horses-- is there such a thing as a meaningful code of honour?-- is tossed around, sometimes casually, sometimes horrifically. His deeper concern-- a mythic interest in what we might call karma, or the inescapable balancing act the Universe makes, or the relentless absurdist logic of obligation-- unfolds through various kinds of horror.The film's only weak point is its occasional moralising speeches. It is as if the Brothers worried-- as did Coleridge of his speaker's impact int he Rime of the Ancient Mariner, a poem with more than a few similarities to this film-- that the sheer power of their story would overwhelm its moral concerns. But ultimately this is the Coens at their best.",8,5,10,2 December 2007
Gran Torino," Old Men, New World, Timeless Values
","The film's theme revolves around the question of what it means to be a man in the modern world, and (it being American) its background question is of course 'where does authority ultimately come from?' Eastwood's Kowalski character, the perfect dutiful middle-class American, having put his house and his Gran Torino car into perfect shape (property + car + working for a car company + being vet = Fine Upstanding Citizen), takes on his next reno project-- his young Hmong neighbour Thao, who Kowlaski christens as 'Toad' and repeatedly calls 'stupid.' Which, to be fair, he often is. Kowalski needs to show young Thao what it means to be a man, and he does. From the value of hard work (and the pride that comes from doing it well), standing up for one's principles, having guts, knowing when to trash talk and when to be polite, what it really means to care about family, to of course how (and when) to ask a girl out and knowing who your friends really are, Kowalski teaches Thao that masculinity is principled, compassionate and not easy.Kowalski is a role model right until the film's final frame. ALthough the ending is a bit pat, the ride is great. From the staggeringly politically incorrect language (half the fun is waiting for what Walk can possibly say next to top his last anti-Asian outburst) to the political and moral questions, this is solid fare. The film avoids cultural stereotypes (no Hmong or immigrant demonisation here) and indeed shows us a vibrant, tough and decidedly non-stereotypical character in Thao's sister.As a high school teacher, I use this with gr11 and 12 students, many of whom face the same pressures as Thao-- to join gangs, be violent, disrespect women, to have money without working for it-- and the film, much to what I am sure would be Eastwood's delight, gets through to them loudly and clearly. Ultimately, it teaches us an old lesson: the only things in life (and death) worth having are those we honestly work for.",8,2,7,5 June 2009
