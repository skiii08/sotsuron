Whip It," Like a revised version of Juno-from the creative mind of Drew Barrymore.
","I just saw the film today, and I must say that I walked out pretty delighted. This is yet another excellent film that uses the talents of Ellen Page, and manages to maximize them. It is pretty funny at times, but the drama is terrific. It is not faux or fabricated, or formulaic, but seemingly real and recognizeable. All the roles were played out extremely well, with the excellent Ellen Page leading the way. Shockingly though, the one other person who really stood out to me was Kristen Wiig as Maggie Mayhem, playing her most refreshing role yet. Of course, all the credit in the world goes out to Drew Barrymore, whose directorial debut is a truly solid one. Throughout the film, it seemed as if it was her life story in an alternate universe, filled with, comedy, drama, adversity, adventure, and pure Bliss at the end.I have more to say, but cant piece it all together just yet. A solid film-kind of like a revised version of Juno, with themes such as different central issue, feminine growth, parent/child conflicts, friendship, self-confidence, and ultimate triumph, all from the creative mind of Drew Barrymore. 10/10",10,3,10,2 October 2009
The Expendables 2," The CONSUMMATE action movie-Great humor, epic homages, gritty style and high octane action with a dose of emotion.
","Seeing how there have been over 300 review of this film on here to date, I won't make this review a long one. This masterpiece is simply GREAT. The beginning and end are loaded with incredibly gratuitous action, with a notable amount mixed in. The humor is terrific. The best thing about this film, however, are the direct homages. Bruce Willis was just like Mcclaine, Arnold like the Terminator, and Van Damme like the pure badass he once was. They all get a rebirth in this KING of all action movies. None of those, however, match up with the pure glee all action fans got from the Chuck Norris moments. From his entrance scene, to the Norris joke references, and all the moments he got to unleash hell. This is what we were expecting from the 1st film(which was also terrific), but it's great that we get it now. I could add more, but this is good enough. While there will never be an action film that consists of as much epicness overall, I sure hope there's more coming, because these movies are better than any of the other rehashed superhero junk Hollywood is spewing out . I've seen it about 10 times, and for each viewing, I must give this gem a 10/10.",10,0,0,4 November 2012
Star Trek," A modern marvel-the epitome of summer blockbuster!!!
","Bottom line: Words cannot possibly explain the magnitude of perfection of this movie. Let me start off by saying that i am not a fan of the show, and have not seen an episode. When i first saw the previews, i was stopped dead in my tracks and decided to make it one of my top 5 or ten of movies to see over this summer. i expected a decent movie, and had fairly average expectations for it. When i went to see it yesterday, i was simply BLOWN AWAY!!! The movie has everything you could ask for in a single film-its has drama, it has emotion, the comedy is spectacular, and of course the action is top notch!!! Chris Pine obviously did more than a reasonable job as Captain James T. Kirk, and Zachary Quinto was superb as Spock-the one character that just about everyone who knows anything about star trek has at least heard of. John Cho, Zoe Saldana and Bruce Greenwood all did well also. There are, however, four people who really, really need to be praised for their roles in this spectacular film, starting with the always respectable Simon Pegg, who surprisingly has perhaps his greatest, funniest, and perhaps the most respectable role thus far in his young acting career, and was a perfect fit for providing much of the comic relief of the film. Secondly, Leonard Nimoy, who is often bowed down upon as the original Spock, does a fantastic job in a surprising role in this movie, and only garners more praise in doing so. Thirdly, is the most unexpected acting role in the film, and is that of Nero, the villain in the movie portrayed spectacularly by the hardly recognizable Eric Bana, who clearly showcased as much of a surprising and unexpected performance as that of Jeffery Dean Morgan in Watchmen, and obviously deserved more screen time. However, the one person who CLEARLY immortalized his name into Hollywood is none other than JJ Abrams himself, who co-wrote, directed, and produced this visual and mental spectacle. He did what no director has ever been able to do with a movie adapted from a TV series or a comic book before:not only did he rejuvenate the series, gather more fans for it, and make the majority of trekkies proud, but he did it with a rather unknown cast. He knew the risk he was taking, but ultimately he lived up to much, much more than anyone's expectations. This movie is so great that, it even got a 95% on rotten tomatoes, which is fairly close to unthinkable!!Some people have thought about possibly seeing it online off a torrent, but let me tell you, the SOUND AND VISUAL EFFECTS ARE SIMPLY BREATH-taking, and actually contribute more to the story than solely for just entertainment purposes, and should be mandated to be seen in theaters!!! It is worth any ticket price, and if you are a fan of comedy, action, sci-fi, drama, or all of these genres, then this is a movie for YOU!!! While there will be several expected blockbusters to be released in theaters this summer, such as the already released and enjoyable Wolverine, Angels and demons, Terminator Salvations, Land of the Lost, Up, Nam2, Pelham 123, Year one, Transformers 2, Ice Age 3,Public Enemies, Harry Potter 6, Funny People, GI Joe, Inglorious Bastards, Final Destination 3D and many more, this is clearly looking like one of the best of them all!!! A must see, and the EPITOME OF SUMMER BLOCKBUSTERS-past, present, and soon to come!!",10,2,11,9 May 2009
The Town," An exceptionally thrilling, well made crime drama that really works.
","I got a chance to see this film at a free screening earlier tonight, and all I could say was, nothing. My mind was sufficiently blown away, and mixed emotions coursed through my body. This film honestly lived up to its hype, a feat so few films have achieved recently besides Avatar and Inception. As we all know, the plot revolves around Doug MacRay(Affleck), the ringleader of a group of bank robbers. In the first scene of the film, he and his men rob a bank, and kidnap the bank manager Claire(Hall). They let her go free, but she remains traumatized from that moment on, with her only clue as to the identity of her kidnappers being a tattoo behind James Coughlin's(Renner) neck. She is visibly shaken when inquired by Special Agent Adam Frawley(Hamm), and ultimately breaks down in front of Macray at the laundromat, where he comforts her, while falling for her as time goes on. Ultimately, the plot thickens, as MacRay goes through his tumultuous relationships with Coughlin and his sister(Lively), his own father, and Claire, while continuing heists and evading agent Frawley. It is a rather well developed plot, albeit not completely original, but that is far from the movie's shining points. First off, the main characters are very well developed. Renner does a great job as Affleck's best friend and second in command. He reflects his role as flawlessly as any actor can. Rebecca Hall displays a fine performance, showing us yet again how great an actress she can be. Affleck, who has been trashed by many over the years, had been slowly regaining a good reputation amongst the masses, receiving good reviews for his performances as a supporting actor in Extract and State of play. As the main character in The Town, he has managed to show us that his acting and directing skills have not diminished much from the time he gifted us with Good Will Hunting. Even Blake Lively delivers a mature performance, proving that she has indeed fruited into a good actress since her days in Gossip Girl. The best performance, however, was from none other than Mr Don Draper himself, John Hamm. He proves to us that his acting is better than just television-worthy. His luring charisma and brutally honest dialogue is good enough to get him an Oscar nod for sure, and may likely do for him and Mad Men what 40-Year Old Virgin did for Steve Carrell and The Office: Get a great show the audience it truly deserves, and turn the actor into a Hollywood star. There are two non-graphic sex scenes(one involving Hall and Affleck, the with Lively and Affleck), and only three heist scenes(the opening bank scene, the hilarious and action packed heist involving the nun masks seen in trailers, and the concluding Fenway Park heist). The action scenes are few and limited, but are all great, especially the one at Fenway park. However, the heist scenes, as well as other violent scenes, regardless of their great impact and sheer brilliance, come remotely close to the brutality of the masterful dialogue of this gem of a film. Each main character gets their own fair share, but the two that stab our hearts with the most powerful thrusts are the ones from Peter Postlethwaite, who plays Affleck's boss, and Chris Cooper in his lone scene in jail as Affleck's father. Both have to do with the way his mother 'left' him. Though I have already spoiled many aspects of the film, I cannot spoil those two dialogue sequences. They are both equally cringe-inducing and tear jerking, and you'll easily be able to identify them, not only through your ears, but by the pain your heart goes through. The dialogue is like a SAW trap: It is a hammer that will pound you relentlessly until your are as close to keeling over as possible. The film may sound very grim, which it is, but there is loads of humor in it, too. Most of it is dark and unexpected, due to the irony of the situations, such as some of Hamm and Lively's confrontations, Affleck's conversation with Hall at the laundromat about her kidnappers, the scene where Affleck and Renner talk about Hall, and when they beat up her tormentors and their brief dialogue before that. The funniest moment was by far and away the moment where the robbers, dressed in nun masks, are seen changing and driving by a police officer after the robbery, when he stares at them and does nothing. It should be noted that this film isn't for minors, due to its heavy use of the f-word, amongst other things. It isn't the love story that most have rendered it to be. The romance is yet another subplot to the drama and thrills this movie induces amongst its viewers. This film can definitely clinch at least a few Oscar noms for screenplay, writing, supporting actor, director, film, and should win for screenplay, due to the sharp dialogue which wickedly cuts into you, seeps into you, and rips you to shreds. A perfect film. 10/10 For those of you who want to write your own review for the film, here are a few suggested summaries:Exceptional; Affleck's Redemption; the best film of the year.",10,29,50,13 September 2010
Avatar," Cameron's return to greatness; One of the best cinematic experiences in modern film history.
","In 1984, he gave us a groundbreaking futuristic thriller in The Terminator. Thirteen years later he gave us the high grossing romantic period piece Titanic. Prior to that, he had the vision for the sheer beauty and amazement of his newest masterpiece, Avatar.I'm sure everyone knew to expect great visuals throughout the movie, but not nearly as much as this. James Camerons new world of Pandora showcases a vast amount of how creatively the mind of this genius works, and why technology couldn't represent it properly until now. Every single detail is carved in such a way that you are left with an abundance of awe from just a quick glance upon the vividly lush screen. Though most films with an abundance of CGI and effects often overlook the acting in the film, Avatar even refuses to make that cliché. Sigourney Weaver is as great as she always is, and simply adds to her accomplishments. Sam Worthington has the perfectly roguish mentality that makes him the perfect choice for the primary role, and Zoe Saldana has made a career for herself this year alone, with her success in Star Trek over the summer and exemplifies her gifted talents with a powerful role here. Th most surprising role in my eyes, however, was that of Michelle Rodriguez as the pilot. For the first time, not only is she given a role that suits her, but she manages to showcase just how good an actress she can be with the right role. While this movie does have its haters, and will obviously continue to do so, one of the most repeated criticisms of Avatar is that it is simply a superfluous futuristic version of Dances with Wolves. I wouldn't necessarily disagree, but do consider this a better film. While the two do have several similarities, the raw emotion infused with grade A technology simply magnify the drama of the plot to an infinite degree. While it is clearly a depiction of the story of American Indians, their life, infiltration, and ultimate loss of home and identity, the obscure version of this tale makes it more impactful on ones mind. The wordplay involved within the film deserves its own applause. From the mineral being called 'unobtanium', to the name of the planet being 'Pandora', the foreshadowing of these words just continues to add to the depth of the movie. Despite the fact that I have seen several dramatic, historical, futuristic and action films, I simply cannot recall a better combination of each of these major genres, with humor and emotion in my lifetime. It has been a while, both since Cameron has released a new film an I have anticipated a movie for so long( 3+ years), and both waits were undoubtedly worth it. It also borrows from films such as Dances with Wolves and District 9. Ultimately, Cameron's lesson is perfectly taught, his vision is fully showcased, and this legendary film is undoubtedly a prime candidate for one of the best overall cinematic viewing experiences in modern film history, from visuals to storyline and its telling, along with fine acting and sheer brilliance. A great tale of epic proportions from a directorial mastermind that can match the levels of Scorcese and Welles. 10/10.",10,33,54,18 December 2009
Ice Age: Dawn of the Dinosaurs," An excellent and welcome addition to the Ice Age franchise
","I saw this film earlier today, since it was a sneak preview, and I must say, it was fabulous! When I first heard about the sneak preview, I actually had some doubts about whether to go or not. I recently went to a sneak preview of the proposal, which wasn't half bad, but the theater wasn't even half full!!! when i got into this one, all but the fist two rows were completely full! Still i got a great seat. As for the movie, it was great. All the characters had their fair share of laughs, and they all were equally great! The story revolves around change: Manny and Ellie are together, she is pregnant, Diego wants to move on, and Sid wants to belong and have a family. In order to attain his goal, he goes to look for some friends, but falls through a sheet of ice in the process. He then sees three eggs which turn out to be dinosaur eggs, and believes that they were abandoned. He takes them, and chaos ensues. I would reveal more of the plot, but that could take hours! It may seem like a thin plot if you haven't seen the movie or read the script, but once you do, you will realize just how dense the storyline really is. The cinematography is spectacular, the pop culture references(past and present) are very creative, and the addition of real d 3D just adds more to the film: it is perhaps the best 3D I've seen! Also, all the characters, as said earlier, are also great, but new additions, such as the dinosaurs, and of course Simon Pegg as Buck, are also very funny. There is also times where some of the jokes from Manny seem like the material that made Ray Romano a household name! However, the tie that binds the movie together is the emphasis on the main theme-family and friendship. There are some very dramatic scenarios that display them throughout the movie, and even allow you to feel like you can relate. Since most triquels like Shrek the Third and Spiderman 3 are considered to be clunkers, this will surely be a breath of fresh air to the sub-genre, and is definitely worthy of being an addition to the Ice Age trilogy. A must see in 3D!!! 9/10",9,33,49,21 June 2009
