Vertigo," Jimmy Stewart deserved an Oscar!
","Jimmy Stewart deserved an Oscar for his performance in Vertigo and it's inconceivable to me that he wasn't nominated for his brilliant and captivating performance.  I'm amazed each and every time I see this film at his ability to reveal the darkest sides of a character (than what the audience is use to seeing).  I'm also drawn to this film for its direction, artistry, cinematography, haunting theme & music and,  of course, Jimmy Stewart.  It is simply a visually stunning film.  The last scene where he verbally lashes out at Kim Novak is so unlike a Jimmy Stewart character that it just leaves you in total awe of his acting range.  A total master at this craft!It's one of Jimmy Stewart's finest performance, and the film leaves you 'on the edge' as only Alfred Hitchcock could...A 10 in my book!",Null,2,4,12 September 1999
