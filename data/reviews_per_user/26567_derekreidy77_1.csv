First Man," Soooo boring
","I love everything to do with space. I've watched pretty much every movie about space. I've watched countless documentaries about the moon. And none have left me as bored to tears as this film.I really didn't learn anything, other than perhaps Armstrong suffered a bit on the spectrum? 2+ hours just dragged on and on.Was it a bad movie? No... But it was nothing special. I was pretty sad to see that such an important event in human history was turned into a snooze fest.",4,2,4,2 December 2018
