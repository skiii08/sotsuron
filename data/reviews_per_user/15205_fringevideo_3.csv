The Blair Witch Project," from Fringe Video Fanzine Issue #002
","Not since Last House on the Left's (1972) 'Keep repeating, it's only a movie, it's only a movie' or the days of William Castle's The Tingler (1959) has a marketing campaign been so successful, and for that reason alone you should like this movie. The film opened with stark, white type on a black background: ...In October of 1994, three student filmmakers disappeared in the woods near Burkittsville, Maryland, while shooting a documentary... Despite dramatically mixed audience reaction, The Blair Witch Project became an overnight success. The directors 'supposedly' use the much hated, shaking hand held found footage shot by the victims before they died. Hundreds of people actually believed this hype, thanks to disinformation spread by the internet, and by the time the film got to the Sundance Film Festival, it was being promoted with missing person flyers picturing the actors. ...it's not like no-one ever thought of the idea before. Cannibal Holocaust (1979), Henry: Portrait of a Serial Killer (1989) and Man Bites Dog (1993) all have used the fake documentary footage. Some even say the directors completely stole their movie idea from an earlier low-budget film entitled The Last Broadcast (1997). However, none of those films made the kind of cash that this one did. Blair Witch has pulled in some $140 million on an initial investment of approximately $35,00 - Night of the Living Dead (1968) cost three times that. Love it or hate it, the film has made an impact.",Null,0,1,3 June 2001
Fight Club," from Fringe Video Fanzine Issue #001
","Directed by David Fincher, Fight Club is a very weird movie that people either loved or hated. It is a dark; very satiric, and incredibly funny movie. Our star played by Edward Norton [American History X (1998)], on one of his many business trips, meets Tyler Durden played Brad Pitt [Kalifornia (1993) / Seven (1995, also directed by David Fincher)], a sly soap-salesman and jack-of-all-trades. When Edward Norton's high rise apartment is mysteriously firebombed, he turns to Brad Pitt for help. After a few drinks, both learn that neither has ever been in a fight. Pitt asks Norton to punch him. The 'Fight Club' is born. Channeling primal male aggression into a shocking new form of therapy the concept catches on, with underground 'Fight Clubs' forming in every town. Becoming a weekly testosterone social event, the club soon begins to grow, then mutate into a terrorist organization known as 'Project Mayhem'. A nihilistic cult that subverts and disrupt society whenever possible, through pranks and anti-corporate aggression. Throughout the film director David Fincher uses stylized subliminal editing, exciting camerawork, and digital effects to make a his work come to life. The film ends with a surprise ending similar to The Sixth Sense (1999), when Norton realizes that he is having a 'mid-life crisis' ....... The DVD is full of so many extras that they needed a second disc fit them all on.",Null,0,1,13 May 2001
Pi," from Fringe Video Fanzine Issue #001
","An award winning low-budget, black and white cyberpunk assault on the senses, about an insane math genius and part time numerologist, Max Cohen who is desperately trying to crack the code behind the Stock Market. After accidentally discovering the hidden numbers in connection to Pi that will make him rich, a group of Orthodox Jews realize that these same random numbers also reveal the true name of God. After being chased and stalked by the Kaballah sect, and wall street thugs all searching for the complete 216-digit code, a disorienting wave of horror, hallucination and paranoia overwhelm Max. The only hard copy print out of the number is quickly memorized and destroyed. Director Darren Aronofsky (winner at the prestigious 1998 Sundance Film Festival appears on the commentary track, along with star Sean Gullette) has created an excellent pulse-pounding thriller. Who would have thought that a film about numbers would be so exciting.",Null,0,1,13 May 2001
