Scarface," Dynamic Performance by Pacino
","In 1983, Director Brian De Palma set out to make a film about the rise and fall of an American gangster, and that he did-- with the help of a terrific screenplay by Oliver Stone and some impeccable work by an outstanding cast. The result was `Scarface,' starring Al Pacino in one of his most memorable roles.  The story begins in May of 1980, when Castro opened the harbor at Mariel, Cuba, to allow Cuban nationals to join their families in the United States.  125,000 left Cuba at that time, for the greener pastures of freedom in America, and most were honest, hard-working people, thankful for the opportunity they had been granted.  But not all.  Among the `Marielitos' who streamed into Florida, approximately 25,000 had criminal records and were nothing less than the dregs of Cuba's jails-- criminals considered beyond redemption, who Castro had merely wanted to be rid of.  And they, too, saw America as a land of opportunity, even as Al Capone had considered Chicago some fifty years earlier.  And among the most ambitious was a man named Tony Montana (Pacino), known to his associates as `Caracortada.' Scarface.Now that he was free of the yoke of Communism under which he had grown up, Montana wanted what he felt was coming to him, and he wanted it now; and from the moment he stepped off the boat in Florida, he was determined to have it all.  Wealth and power-- that was Montana's dream, and he would get it by doing what he did best, beginning with a favor for a man living in Miami by the name of Frank Lopez (Robert Loggia).  Lopez, it seems, had a brother in Cuba who had met an untimely end at the hands of one of Castro's goons, a man who, having outlived his usefulness to Castro, had been summarily discarded and was currently being held in `Little Havana,' along with Montana and all of the Cubans just off the boats, where they awaited their papers from the government that would effect their transition into their new lives.  And in short order, Montana sees to it that Lopez's brother has been avenged, and it sets the stage for his own entrance into the underworld of America.Lopez, a wealthy businessman with the right connections, in return for the favor gets Montana and his friend, Manny (Steven Bauer), released from the holding camp, and puts them to work.  In his day, Capone may have had bootlegging as a means through which to line his coffers with illicit gain, but Lopez has the modern day equivalent, and it's even more lucrative: Cocaine.  Lopez takes Montana under his wing and indoctrinates him into the life, but once he has a taste of it, Montana isn't satisfied with whatever crumbs Lopez sees fit to throw his way, and he sets a course that will take him to where he wants to be:  At the `top.'  With a cold-blooded, iron will, Montana decides he'll do whatever it takes to get there, no matter what the cost.  but before it's over, he will realize the price for his dream, and he'll pay it; but for a brief moment, perhaps he will know what it's like to be The Man.  And he will also know whether or not it was worth it.In step with De Palma's vision, Pacino plays Montana larger-than-life, and he does it beautifully.  From the accent he affects (which he researched thoroughly to make sure he got it right-- and he did), to the body language and the attitude, he's got it all, and it makes Montana convincing and very real.  What he brings to the role is nuance and style, in a way that few actors (De Niro would be one) can.  This is definitely not a character that is sympathetic in any way, nor is there anything about Montana that you can readily relate to on a personal level; but Pacino's screen presence is so strong that it makes him a thoroughly engrossing character, even though it's hard to become emotionally involved with him.  It's quite simply a dynamic, memorable performance.Michelle Pfeiffer gives a solid performance, as well, in the role that put her on the path to stardom.  As Elvira, the woman who becomes an integral part of Montana's dream, Pfeiffer is subtle and understated, giving that sense of something going on underneath, while affecting a rather cold and distant exterior countenance.  She, like Pacino, definitely makes her presence felt as she fairly glides across the screen with a stoic, enigmatic and sultry demeanor.The supporting cast includes Mary Elizabeth Mastrantonio (Gina), Miriam Colon (Mama Montana), F. Murray Abraham (Omar), Paul Shenar (Sosa) and Harris Yulin (Bernstein).  An excellent precursor to the more recent and highly acclaimed `Traffic,' and `Blow,' and well as having a climactic scene reminiscent of Peckinpah's `The Wild Bunch,' De Palma's `Scarface,' originally panned by critics, has since been cited by many as being the definitive American gangster saga.  Much of the violence is implied rather than graphic, but this film still has an edge of realism to it that many may find somewhat disturbing.  But if you stay with it, there is a lesson to be learned in the end.  And like many lessons in life, the most valuable are often the hardest to take at the time.  But the reward is always worth it, and that's the way it is with this film.  I rate this one 8/10.",8,99,152,30 June 2001
Requiem for a Dream," Hard Look at Drug Addiction
","The devastating, downward spiral of four individuals addicted to drugs is examined in lurid detail in `Requiem for a Dream,' directed by Darren Aronofsky, who paints a vivid picture of the physical and psychological damage that can be incurred by unrestrained chemical abuse.  And it's not a pretty picture.  Harry Goldfarb (Jared Leto) and Marion Silver (Jennifer Connelly) are young and in love, but they have a problem; their recreational drug use has long since passed the point of `recreation,' and the sad part is, they don't seem to realize it, or if they do, they're into big time denial.  Harry's friend, Tyrone (Marlon Wayans), is in the same situation, and together they spend most of their time and resources trying to score their next fix.  Even the fact that Harry has to repeatedly hock his own mother's television set for drug money doesn't clue them in to how deep their addiction runs; which is a truly sad state of affairs.	Sara Goldfarb (Ellen Burstyn) is a widow who lives alone, and only wishes that her son, Harry, would come around to see her once in awhile, besides when he needs her beloved TV, which is her only real companion in life. Sara doesn't realize it, but there's troubled times ahead for her, too, which begin with a telephone call informing her she's been chosen to appear on a television show, which to her is like being given the Holy Grail. Immediately, she begins to prepare for the moment, but she is bothered by her weight-- her favorite dress doesn't fit anymore.  She's just too fat (she feels) to go on TV.  The solution she discovers, however, is easy. Prescription diet pills, provided by a doctor recommended to her by one of her friends in her apartment building.  Diet pills, nothing more.  It seems so harmless.	Director Aronofsky doesn't pull any punches with this film, and shows-- often in graphic detail-- just what drugs can do to a person.  Some of the images he presents are hard to take, and are not easily forgotten; like the effects of a needle on an arm when injected repeatedly into the same spot over a prolonged period of time, or the delusions caused by ingesting vast amounts of `speed.'  But the visuals he offers are not the only powerful images; the psychological implications are quite potent as well.  Each character at one time or another seems to comprehend, during one of their few-and-far-between lucid moments, what's happening to them.  But they either do not want to address their situation, or they can't.  Either way, it's harrowing to watch, let alone contemplate.  	Ellen Burstyn was nominated for a Best Actress Oscar for her work here, and rightfully so; her performance as Sara, a woman who gets taken unawares and must do battle with an unexpected demon, is astounding.  It's a challenging, decidedly unglamorous role, and Burstyn certainly gave it everything she had, and it paid off.  Sara is someone with whom you can sympathize on a number of levels, while at the same time, the way she comes into her situation is so disconcerting it makes you want to keep her at arms length, because it's something you don't really want to have to think about.  Out of sight, out of mind.  It's an emotionally taxing part-- for Burstyn, of course-- but for the audience, as well.	Jared Leto gives an extremely convincing, believable performance, also, but his character tends to evoke mixed feelings.  On one hand, you feel terrible for him, but on the other, you realize that-- unlike Sara-- Harry came to where he is because of his own unsound judgment and choices, which casts a rather subjective pall over his circumstances, and therefore the way you relate to him.  Still, there's no getting around the fact that it's a depressing situation (to say the least) for everyone involved.	The same can be said of Connelly's character, Marion, who seems to go deeper into her situation than the others with her eyes wide open, and it's disturbing to see someone so young, vital and seemingly intelligent allowing this to happen to herself.  Connelly, who admirably of late has forsaken mainstream cinema for roles of more substance in independent films (like `Pollock' and `Waking the Dead'), turns in a memorable performance here, capturing that dark side of human nature and expressing it so well in terms of her character and the path she chooses to take.  And of all of the characters in the film, it is through Marion that you really get a sense of the degradation and loss of self-esteem that comes with the territory to which these people have staked a claim.  And it's just almost too horrendous to consider.	The supporting cast includes Christopher McDonald (Tappy Tibbons), Louise Lasser (Ada), Marcia Jean Kurtz (Rae) and Peter Maloney (Dr. Pill).  A powerful anti-drug film, `Requiem for a Dream' is a stark and realistic look at a problem that affects everyone either directly or indirectly, and it's so effective because there's no attempt to candy-coat the issue.  Aronofsky tells it-- and shows it-- like it is, and like `Trainspotting' and `Traffic,' it gives you a real grasp of just how far into our lives the tentacles of this evil reaches, and how vulnerable we all really are to it. This film may be a sobering trip, but it's definitely one worth taking.  I rate this one 9/10.",9,1,2,8 July 2001
Minority Report," A 'Minor' Success for Spielberg
","Preventative maintenance can go a long way in getting a lot of extra miles out of that new car, and without question, applying the same principles to health care can add years to your life.  That's what `prevention' is all about; averting disaster and tragedy by taking measures to stop it before it happens.  It's certainly not a unique concept, by any means (at least when it comes to things like cars and health care), but what about in terms of crime?  Murder, for example; can there possibly be a way to anticipate and prevent even that?  It's a proposition that director Steven Spielberg addresses in `Minority Report,' a drama/thriller set in the near future, in which a kind of `HMO for Crime' has been established that does just that:  A system that unerringly predicts and prevents murder.  But just how accurate is it, really?  Can such an operation be infallible beyond any doubt? That-- as they say-- is the question.In Washington D.C., 2054, a `PreCrime' unit has been in operation for some six years now, under the leadership of Lamar Burgess (Max von Sydow).  Using a system whereby murder can be detected before it happens-- and thus averted-- the unit has successfully eliminated that particular crime in the D.C. area.  One of the driving forces behind it all is Detective John Anderton (Tom Cruise), who has something of a vested interest in making this system work:  Just before the inception of this revolutionary unit, Anderton suffered a tragedy in his own life; the kind of tragedy he hopes that no one else will ever have to endure again because of their efforts here.Anderton's unit has been something of a prototype, however, and with the success rate they have enjoyed, the U.S. government is interested in taking the project nationwide.  But they want to look a little deeper into the operation first, and so agent Danny Witwer (Colin Farrell) is dispatched to investigate and root out any potential flaws that may have been overlooked on the local level.  Burgess and Anderton maintain that the system is infallible, but then something happens-- Anderton himself is `seen' committing a murder in the near future.  And it's going to happen in about thirty-six hours...With films like `Schindler's List' and `Saving Private Ryan,' Steven Spielberg has long since established himself as one of the `Greats' among film directors.  Much of his success comes from the fact that he likes to tell stories about `people,' and he always manages to find the human element within the story that make his films so engaging.  Even the best filmmaker, however, is not going to produce a work of genius every time out; just as within every human being there is `good' cholesterol and `bad' cholesterol, so it must be with the films of an artist of Spielberg's magnitude-- it is natural that his resume will include both.  And this film-- which, without question is a good film-- is just not as compelling as some of his previous efforts.  One of the reasons, I think, is that it is an inherently dark tale, and Spielberg is by nature too positive to take it to the depths that would have really made it emotionally absorbing.  As good as Spielberg is at exploring the complexities of human nature, he tends to get distracted by the environment within he must work to tell certain stories (like this one).  He seems to have an innate aversion to things too dark, at which times he seems to turn to the gadgets, toys and myriad F/X at his disposal for diversion, and quite frankly, his vision of the future in this film fails to evoke that necessary sense of disquiet or foreboding in the way that Ridley Scott did so successfully in `Blade Runner,' for example.  The `look' of this film is more `amusement park ride' than the gritty realism of Scott's film.  Compare and consider the differences between this film and `A.I' (another film with a dark, decidedly `non-Spielbergian' theme), and `E.T' and `Close Encounters of the Third Kind.'  The latter, while falling within the Sci-fi genre, are basically upbeat, positive stories, with `E.T.,' especially, focusing on the characters rather than-- or at least equal to-- the events as they occur. And nobody does a film like that better than Steven Spielberg. 
This film was written by Scott Frank and Jon Cohen, based on the short story by Philip K. Dick, and If only Spielberg (and the screenwriters) had been more willing to embrace the dark side of this story, he may have been able to create the kind of suspense that made `Jaws' so on-the-edge-of-your-seat riveting.  But, again-- though this is a decent movie-- it simply is not the taut thriller it could have been, like Tony Scott's `Enemy of the State,' which in many ways is similar to this film.  There again, the sense of paranoia and suspense Tony Scott achieved with his film was due to the fact that he embraced the darkness and immersed himself (and his film) in it.
As Anderton, Tom Cruise gives a convincing performance and (as evidenced in `Vanilla Sky') he is continuing to mature as an actor.  His trademark smile is there, of course, but he is relying on it less and less, which is helping him to develop his characters with more depth and detail, as he does here with his portrayal of Anderton.Max von Sydow, as usual, turns in a believable performance as Burgess, but the character is intrinsically stereotypical, and he simply isn't afforded the time to develop his portrayal much beyond that.  The standout performances come from Colin Farrell, who lends some real nuance to his character and manages to make him truly three-dimensional; and from Samantha Morton, who creates the most emotionally involving character of the film with her portrayal of Agatha; and it's part of what makes `Minority Report' (like any Spielberg film-- even the `lesser' ones) worth the price of admission.  7/10.",7,3,4,8 August 2002
Training Day," Washington Makes It Worthwhile
","A brutal and disturbing film that attempts to connect you with the underbelly of the streets of downtown Los Angeles, while examining that fragile, thin line between those who enforce the law and those who break it, `Training Day,' directed by Antoine Fuqua, is a cautionary morality tale that decidedly points out that what you do and who you are is a matter of free will and personal choice.  Beyond the action, it's a study of human nature that explores the necessity of having a moral code by which to live, especially when confronted with that age-old seductress Evil, who can lure even the best of the best across that line from which there is no return. The most disconcerting aspect of the film, however, is in it's portrayal of those in high places who with facility betray those they are sworn to serve and protect, with their flagrant abuse of their position and power, and moreover, seemingly always manage to hold the high ground of advantage over those against whom their misdeeds are perpetrated.  Indeed, the burden of proof must always fall to the good guy, and more often than not it is those endowed with a more positive, benevolent nature-- the ones who want to do the right thing-- that find justice elusive and become victims themselves, if only because of their refusal to compromise their own principles.  And that is really what is at the heart of Fuqua's film, which very probably will take many viewers to a place they would rather not be.  But, as Steve McQueen said in `Bullitt,' when asked by his girlfriend how he can stand doing a job that keeps him so close to the gutter, `That's where half of it is--'  And in today's world, unfortunately, it may well be that the percentage is even higher; which somewhat elevates the significance of this film.	Jake Hoyt (Ethan Hawke), a nineteen month veteran of the L.A.P.D., is about to begin his first day on a new assignment, having landed a spot in the Narcotics Division, where he will be a member of a small squad under the direction of Alonzo Harris (Denzel Washington)-- if he measures up to Alonzo's stringent expectations.  It's a job he wants, because he sees it as an opportunity to really do some good in the community; it's a place from which he can help rid the streets of drug dealers and other felons.  But he quickly discovers that-- as most worthwhile things are in life-- it's just not that easy.  As Alonzo is quick to point out, `If you want to protect the sheep from the wolf, you have to become a wolf.  It's the wolf that catches the wolf--'  Jake also learns that on this day he's going to have to make a lot of decisions, and make them quickly, without the luxury of time to consider all of the possible ramifications.  And one of them is put to him directly by Alonzo, who tells him he's going to have to decide what he wants to be, a sheep-- or a wolf.  It's something he's going to have to know by the end of the day; and Jake doesn't know it going in, but this day, his `Training Day,' is going to be a day that will change his life forever.	Fuqua's film is presented honestly and in such a way that it successfully puts the viewer on the streets of L.A., and Jake and Alonzo are credible characters; but the motivation behind Alonzo's ruthlessness is fairly anemic and under-developed.  The weakness of the film, in fact, lies in the screenplay (by David Ayer), which though it captures a certain sense of `street-wise' reality, is otherwise rather formulaic and doesn't really have the depth it needs to make it emotionally involving.  And one of the biggest flaws, especially in light of the fact that this story is presented in `realistic' terms, is that a key element of the plot hinges on a coincidence that Vegas odds-makers would love to put some big money on.  Fuqua visits much of the same territory as Dennis Hopper's 1988 film, `Colors,' though the final message is quite different, inasmuch as the focus of this film is on the `bad cop' angle.  As stated previously, there is some significance to this one, but it takes some work and imagination on the part of the viewer to discern.	As Alonzo, Denzel Washington gives an excellent performance-- and, quite frankly, this film would be less than average without him-- but whether or not it is deserving of an Oscar is open to speculation.  Washington is one of the finest actors in the business, without question, and he's taken on some challenging roles (in which he's been very successful) that make this part pale by comparison.  Alonzo Harris is more along the lines of Mel Gibson's Riggs in `Lethal Weapon,' or Eastwood's Harry in `Dirty Harry,' the difference being that Alonzo is the bad guy.  It's a credit to Washington's ability that he was able to make this such a strong character, however, and his Alonzo is certainly believable and real.  And, in retrospect, perhaps it is an Oscar-worthy performance; it had to be to overcome the weakness of the script and what he was given to work with.  And, again, without Denzel Washington, this film plays for two weeks in the theater and is quickly forgotten when it hits the video store shelf.	Hawke gives a strong performance, as well, but that he received an Oscar nomination for it is the stuff of which debates are born.  Like Washington, however, Hawke does do a good job of bringing his character to life, and it is one of the strengths of the film.	The supporting cast includes Tom Berenger (Stan), Harris Yulin (Doug) and Scott Glenn (Roger).  In the final analysis, `Training Day' is elevated by the performances of it's stars; without them, this one has no legs.  6/10.",6,0,12,4 April 2002
Erin Brockovich," Prepare The Oscars For Roberts, Finney
","A tenacious file clerk for a small law firm, curious about some information included in the file of a pro bono case, purses it and ultimately becomes a major player in a huge lawsuit involving hundreds of people in `Erin Brockovich,' a movie based on actual events, directed by Steven Soderbergh. When Erin (Julia Roberts) questions why medical records are included in the file of a simple real estate transaction between a public utilities company and some homeowners in the town of Hinckley, California, she uncovers information that PG&E may have been responsible for water pollution that may have caused widespread illness and even death among the citizens of Hinckley.  But truth is one thing, and having the resources to fight a company worth billions of dollars is another.  And that's the problem that falls into the lap of lawyer Ed Masry (Albert Finney), owner of the law firm that employs Brockovich.  Millions of dollars, as well as justice for those who have been harmed is at stake, but it's a case of David versus Goliath, and Masry has reservations as to whether or not he is up to the task; the meager resources of his firm will only go so far, while the utility could tie them up in court for years and not feel a thing.  Masry, however, has something else to consider:  Erin Brockovich, who has latched on to this case harder than a pit bull on a mailman's trousers. 	Julia Roberts gives one of the best performances of her career in this film, as the sassy, brazen Brockovich, who tells it like it is and won't take `no' for an answer.  She captures ever grain of realism in bringing Erin's story to life; this woman who was down on her luck, but refused to give in to circumstances that overwhelmingly stacked the odds against her. She perfectly conveys the sense of frustration felt by this single mother of three who, unemployed, and with no help or prospects in sight, simply would not quit on her own life or let her children down.  It's a gritty, charismatic performance with a depth that aptly demonstrates what kind of person Brockovich really is; not a portrait of a superwoman or a story made up of overblown, feigned heroics, but of a self-assured, very real person with too much pride and integrity to turn away from the truth and people in need.  Albert Finney is also outstanding as Masry, the honest, hard working lawyer who finds his horizons somewhat expanded by Erin's zeal.  He's something of a decent, regular guy with a good marriage, small but successful practice and diabetes.  And Finney brings him to life with a performance that should get him an Oscar nomination at the very least.  It's tough taking the part of an average Joe and making him memorable, and it's a credit to Finney's ability as an actor that he succeeds so well in doing so. 	The solid supporting cast includes Aaron Eckhart, exemplary in his role of George, the man in Erin's life; Marg Helgenberger (Donna Jensen); Cherry Jones (Pamela Duncan); Peter Coyote (Kurt Potter); and Conchata Ferrell (Brenda).  One of the best movies of the year, `Erin Brockovich' is a well made, absorbing and entertaining drama, well directed and superbly acted, especially by Roberts and Finney; it's theme of the underdog fighting for justice has a universal appeal that will get the adrenaline pumping and engage you emotionally.  It's a great story, with Julia Roberts at her very best.  This is one you do not want to miss.  I rate this one 10/10.",10,11,17,10 September 2000
Meet the Parents," Could Be The Perfect Comedy
","How do you make a good first impression on and win over your prospective father-in-law on the very weekend you intend to ask for his first-born daughter's hand in marriage?  A tricky, touchy, very delicate and serious situation that must be faced and addressed by a young man in `Meet The Parents,' a hilarious comedy directed by Jay Roach and starring Robert De Niro and Ben Stiller.  Greg (Stiller) is in love; he knows Pam (Teri Polo) is the one he wants to spend the rest of his life with, and is ready to propose.  But certain circumstances clue him in to the fact that he should meet her parents first, approach her father, Jack (De Niro), and make the formal request, thereby extending him the respect he has come to understand Jack demands.  Plans are made, and the weekend begins with the flight from Chicago to New York.  And when a slight problem arises even before they board their plane, Greg should have seen it as an omen, because after that, absolutely nothing seems to go as planned. He finds Pam's mom, Dina (Blythe Danner), fairly accessible, but Jack turns out to be quite the formidable opponent, and from the minute they meet it becomes one long dance and spar of witticisms and revelations that make this one weekend Greg (and the audience) will never forget. 	What makes this movie so funny (and this IS one funny movie) is that the humor is character driven, situational and all very real; the laughs (and there are plenty) are all earned and are derived from inherently comical events and circumstances.  The ongoing banter between Greg and Jack is clever, the dialogue is superb and delivered with such sly and subtle shadings that it rings true at every turn.  And De Niro and Stiller play off of one another so perfectly and with such impeccable timing that it's like watching art come to life.  Stiller is a master at playing comedy dead-pan straight, and De Niro proves to be his equal here.  They never go after cheap laughs, and what little broad humor Roach employs evolves directly from the story and is never gratuitous or overdone; Roach and his cast let it all flow naturally and play it with a seriousness that makes it all the more hilarious.  You can literally feel Greg's pain and discomfort as he tries in vain to stand tall and impress this intimidating figure of a man he hopes will soon be his own father-in-law.  And De Niro makes Jack everything a suitor dreads in a prospective in-law; he doesn't merely scratch the surface of this character, but goes deep to make him a multi-layered personality, enigmatic and hard to read.  You know instinctively that there's more to this guy than meets the eye, and given the fact that nobody is good enough in his eyes for his little girl, he is a nightmare waiting for any and all `Gregs' that may come a-calling. 	Polo is charming as Pam; she's charismatic, has great screen presence and a winning personality that makes her character likable and totally believable. In a supporting role, Owen Wilson gives a stand-out performance as Pam's ex-boyfriend, Kevin; he so wryly underplays him, and what he does contrasts so well with what De Niro and Stiller are doing that it makes him one of the most memorable characters in the film.  Rounding out the excellent supporting cast are Nicole DeHuff (Debbie), Jon Abrahams (Denny), James Rebhorn (Larry) and Phyllis George (Linda).  With `Meet The Parents,' Roach leaves no doubt as to what he can do with a comedy; this film is filled with truly funny, memorable scenes and has an endless number of quotable lines, the best of which belongs to Jack (spoken to Greg ):  `If I find that you are trying to corrupt my first born child, I will bring you down, baby, I will bring you down to Chinatown'  In the final analysis, it's all a lot of fun, and there are many things here with which many viewers will readily identify.  This movie, in fact, may well be the perfect comedy; certainly it is nothing less than a modern-day classic that you do not want to miss.  I rate this one 10/10.",10,1,2,12 October 2000
Unbreakable," Shyamalan Delivers An Original
","Writer/director M. Night Shyamalan faced a formidable task in delivering a follow-up to his last outing, `The Sixth Sense,' which was a remarkable film; and his attempt at capturing that same quality and integrity in his latest effort has resulted in a film that, while it does not surpass `Sense,' is nothing less than it's equal.  Beginning with a screenplay that is brilliant in concept, content and structure, and realized with equal acuity,  `Unbreakable,' starring Bruce Willis, is a unique, challenging film that will test the limits of audience perception like never before.  From the cryptic opening scene to the denouement, this is enthralling drama that offers singular insight into the dark capabilities of human nature, and a perspective of evil never before suggested in any movie in the history of the cinema.  Conan Doyle said there's nothing new under the sun, and that may be true; other films may have dealt with similar themes, but the approach Shyamalan takes here is entirely original. 	Shyamalan approaches his material like a quiet, unobtrusive Hitchcock, resulting in a style that is quite his own.  His pace is deliberate, and information is doled out in subtle, measured proportions which affords the discerning viewer a chance to  place the myriad pieces of the puzzle into proper order as the story unfolds.  It's a mystery that refuses to let you off the hook, and demands that you think about what is actually going on without respite.  To say that this is thought provoking material would be an understatement; it's an intricate story, the plot of which is complemented by equally complex characters who are detailed and extremely well written and developed. 	As he did in `The Sixth Sense,' Bruce Willis proves once again that there is so more to him as an actor than being just an action hero.  His portrayal of David Dunn, a man facing a transitional period in his life, is played with a staid countenance that successfully reflects the inner turmoil of the character.  You know from the outset that there is something going on beneath the surface; something unsettling for which Dunn is seeking resolution.  When he becomes the only survivor of a train wreck, it adds to the irresolution in his life as he is suddenly confronted with new issues that take him into still deeper, uncharted waters.  Willis gives a performance that is understated with nuance and depth, and gives Dunn a sense of controlled distress with which the audience can readily identify; that unknown, intangible something that one can feel, yet which remains elusive and unnamed.  It's a powerful statement that illustrates the thin line between reality and the surreal.  Samuel L. Jackson gives a strong performance as well, as Elijah Price, victim of a congenital disease that renders his existence fragile in the extreme.  It's a sympathetic character that somehow refutes sympathy; and Jackson has a presence that makes Elijah real and believable, which is pivotal, as his infirmity is integral to the plot, as is the fact that he and Dunn represent opposite ends of the vast spectrum of life.  Effective in a lesser, yet still significant role, is Robin Wright Penn (Audrey Dunn), who fleshes out the disarray of a wife dealing with the emotional absence of her husband. 	The supporting cast includes Spencer Treat Clark (Joseph Dunn), Charlayne Woodard (Elijah's Mother) and, in a cameo, M. Night Shyamalan (Stadium Drug Dealer).  With `Unbreakable,' Shyamalan has taken up the gauntlet and emerged victorious, with an intelligent, entertaining film so profound that it will no doubt become one of the most under-appreciated films of all time. There is simply a depth to it that will soar beyond the grasp of the casual viewer; few films have such substance and vision.  Like a Monet, this is art that is both impressionistic and invaluable; a true original in every aspect, and a testimony to the talents of M. Night Shyamalan.

Memento," Talk About 'Living In the Moment'
","This is one unique motion picture; a film noir the likes of which you've never seen before nor are likely to see again any time soon.  Like `Jeopardy,' the TV game show, `Memento,' written and directed by Christopher Nolan, begins by giving you an answer (not to be confused with `the' answer), then lets you try to fill in the question.  The story, told backwards (beginning with the end, the scenes are presented in reverse chronological order) is about a man named Leonard Shelby (Guy Pearce), who after suffering a traumatic blow to the head during an incident involving his wife (Jorja Fox), can no longer create new memories.  Though he can remember everything up to the time of the incident, his short term memory lasts no longer than fifteen minutes, which renders him somewhat incapable (as you can imagine) of functioning normally.  Which makes his current preoccupation especially difficult-- tracking down the man who did this to him.	Ensconced in a cheap motel while he attempts to sort out his new life, Leonard must rely on Polaroid photographs and quickly scribbled notes to keep himself in the game.  The particularly pertinent information he uncovers he tattoos on himself (a man's initials, a license plate number, whole sentences that remind him what he's after), thereby insuring that no vital piece of the puzzle that is now his life will be lost.  But it's a tricky business, especially when it comes to remembering who he can trust. All he has to go on are his instincts and his notes; and constantly having to deal with people he's just met-- even if it is the same ones, over and over again-- puts him in a perpetually vulnerable position.  He knows there are those who would exploit him because of his condition, so along with everything else, he has to keep his guard up every minute.  How can he know who to trust when everyone he deals with is a stranger?  It's a sticky wicket, to be sure; but he's determined to play out the hand he's been dealt, one way or another.	Pearce gives a solid performance as Leonard, a guy to whom the phrase `living in the moment' takes on a whole new meaning.  He makes Leonard convincing by never overplaying him, and by maintaining a kind of subtly reserved resignation laced with tentative anxiety; traits you would expect of someone in his condition.  And that Pearce can make that critical connection with the audience, making Leonard someone to whom they can relate, is especially important, as this is a real `What would I do in that situation?' kind of film.  	Also very effective is Carrie-Anne Moss as Natalie, the woman whom Leonard may or may not be able to trust.  Natalie becomes something of a mystery within the mystery, as she comes across as rather enigmatic initially; one of those characters you can't quite figure out, which allows you to identify with Leonard even more, because you know he's trying to decipher her motives, as well.  The same can be said for Teddy, played by Joe Pantoliano, who becomes another constant enigma in Leonard's life.  It's another case of `Who is this guy, really?' and, again, along with Leonard, it keeps you guessing until the end-- which is really the beginning.  But it's that kind of movie; a first rate mystery, from end to beginning (and when you see it, you'll understand).  At any rate, by the time it's over you have a pretty good idea of what fits where.  Natalie, at least, tips her hand at one point; Teddy, though, is a bit tougher to figure out.  And if you don't believe me, just ask Leonard.	The supporting cast includes Mark Boone Junior (Burt), Stephen Tobolowsky (Sammy Jankis), Harriet Sansom Harris (Mrs. Jankis), Callum Keith Rennie (Dodd) and Larry Holden (Jimmy).  This is one of those movies that leaves you asking yourself, `Who could think up something like that?' while at the same time you're saying `Yeah! give me more!'  To say the least, `Memento' is emotionally involving and thoroughly engrossing, and Nolan wisely throws in some humor to give some respite to the constant, underlying tension (at one point Leonard says to Teddy, `Did I ever tell you about Jankis?'  To which Teddy replies, `Only every time I see you.').  Reminiscent of `Jacob's Ladder,' but taken to the `Nth' degree, this is one film that will keep you talking about it-- and debating-- for a long time.  And in another unusual twist, the real irony begins once the film is over, because at that point you're able to identify with Leonard even more-- there's just so much you have to remember to arrive at your final conclusion.  Your best bet?  Watch it again.  That's the magic of the movies.  I rate this one 9/10.",9,0,1,10 June 2001
The Fan," 'Baseball Is Better Than Life, Because It's Fair...'
","It may be true that everyone during their lifetime has fifteen minutes of fame, even if in most cases it only lasts about a minute and a half.  And if that minute and a half comes early in life, how far into adulthood can you carry it with you, and when does a healthy memory become an obsession that finally blurs the line between reality and fantasy?  `The Fan,' directed by Tony Scott and starring Robert De Niro and Wesley Snipes, is an intense and disturbing motion picture that examines that moment and the effects it can have on the lives of those either directly or indirectly involved.  Here, the focus is on one Gil Renard (De Niro), a knife salesman in San Francisco and a die-hard Giants fan who is pumped about the acquisition during the off-season of superstar centerfielder Bobby Rayburn (Snipes), whom he believes will bring a pennant to the team.  Once a player himself-- a pitcher-- Renard's life has since been on a downhill slide.  Divorced, he has a young, little league aged son, Richie (Andrew J. Ferchland), with whom he has an unsettling relationship, and at work, his sales have been so poor his job is on the line.  An angry, disturbed individual, Renard has reached a pivotal point in his life; for inspiration, he continually returns to the philosophies of the catcher from his playing days, Coop (Charles Hallahan), whom he considers one of the finest athletes he ever knew.  And as his life continues to deteriorate, his obsessions begin to add further to the imbalance of his perceptions of reality, which finally lead him past a point of no return.	Scott's film, of course, has less to do with baseball than it does with how the game itself actually relates to life and the things that really matter. As Rayburn says at one point, `We're not curing cancer here.'  But to those to whom life has been reduced to that minute and a half to which they still cling, the game can be everything.  And it is just that unhealthy obsession that Scott examines in this film, that comparatively insignificant moment that in the obsessive mind becomes an episode of monumental importance that finally distorts any semblance of reality the individual may have left. What's truly frightening is that upon close scrutiny, in Renard there is much with which many viewers will be able to relate in one way or another: The anger, the frustration and perhaps the inability to let go of that minute and a half, even when it threatens to become more than just a pleasant memory, but an unhealthy lifeline to another place and another time that, in reality, may never have existed in the first place.  It's like a search for self-esteem by the has-been-who-never-was, who can neither realize nor accept it's elusiveness.  As Renard says to Richie, `Baseball is better than life, because it's fair.  You hit a sacrifice fly and it doesn't count against your average.'  An ideal that has forever eluded Renard; in his life, he's never been able to `give himself up for the team' and get anything in return for it.	As Renard, De Niro gives an explosive performance that at first glance may seem to have a bit of Travis Bickle and Max Cady in it-- which in fact it does-- though upon closer inspection, Renard is a unique character.  Those with a disturbed mind may have traits in common, as these characters De Niro has portrayed certainly do; but De Niro has successfully given each of them an individual personality, and when viewed side by side, the differences are readily apparent.  Bickle may be a sociopath, Cady a cold blooded killer; but Renard is a man who was just never able to get a handle on his life and has allowed his obsessions to dictate the choices he has made along the way. De Niro is simply a master of his craft, with the ability to make his characters so real that a performance like this one is often overlooked; this is Oscar worthy work for which he never received the acclaim he was due.  His Renard is so like someone you would run into in your everyday life that in retrospect, it's scary.  But it's the kind of performance we've come to expect from De Niro, and as usual, he does not disappoint.	Wesley Snipes, as well, gives a solid performance as Rayburn that is one of his best ever, which is not surprising when you consider with whom he was working.  If you study De Niro's films, you may discover a common thread running through them with regard to his co-stars.  De Niro has the ability to make those with whom he is working better; and it's something that stays with them forever after.  Consider Christopher Walken and Meryl Streep before `The Deer Hunter,' or Ed Harris before `Jacknife.'  Certainly they were exceptional talents before, but they have arguably been better since. And Snipes is no exception.  Nor is Benicio Del Toro (Recipient of the Oscar for Best Supporting Actor for `Traffic'), who gives a memorable turn here as Rayburn's rival outfielder, Juan Primo.  	The supporting cast includes Patti D'Arbanville (Ellen),Ellen Barkin (Jewel), John Leguizamo (Manny), Chris Mulkey (Tim), Dan Butler (Garrity) and Brandon Hammond (Sean).  A thought provoking thriller that gives some real insight into the cause and effect of the psyche of human nature, `The Fan' is like an open wound that may hit too close to home for some.  And to dismiss this as just a `baseball' movie or another `action' flick would be a mistake, for there is much more here than meets the eye.  In the end, those who pay attention will ultimately reap the rewards it proffers.  I rate this one 9/10.",9,70,85,3 April 2001
12 Monkeys," A Touch of 'Gilliam Noir'
","In the world of the mind and in the realm of the imagination, anything is possible-- even the ability to transport someone through time.  So suspend your disbelief for awhile, check it at the door, and launch yourself into `12 Monkeys,' an adventure directed by Terry Gilliam that takes you into the past by way of the future.  It begins sometime in the near future, a time in which the inhabitants of the Earth are forced to live underground, having been driven there in 1996, when a deadly virus was intentionally released into the atmosphere rendering the air unbreathable and ultimately killing five billion people.  Now scientists believe they have attained the capability of developing a way to make the air breathable again, in which case mankind will be able to return to the surface of the planet and rebuild a new world.  But their plan is contingent upon first acquiring a sample of the virus in it's original, pure form, rather than the mutated strains currently available to them.  This means that someone must be sent back to 1996 to collect data and locate the source of the virus, which would then enable them to send a scientist back to procure the needed sample. 
	Thus far, though they have successfully implemented a system of time travel, their efforts have been for naught.  Using `volunteers' from the penal system, they have failed time and again for any number of reasons, not the least of which has to do with the lack of cooperation and effort put forth by their `chosen' few .  Now, however, they feel they have just the man for the job, a prisoner named James Cole (Bruce Willis), who has agreed to collect their necessary data in exchange for a full pardon.  The biggest problem seems to be that their `time targeting' isn't exactly precise.  They have information that will help Cole once he gets there-- a cryptic message they uncovered points to a high profile group known as the `Army of the 12 Monkeys' as being responsible for unleashing the virus-- and if they can just land Cole sometime before December of 96, he'll be able to track them down.  So, Cole suits up-- and the adventure begins.	As he did with his 1985 film, `Brazil,' Gilliam here has created a bizarre world that seems to have been dropped through the looking glass.  He presents a future that comes through as something of a subterranean version of the world in `Blade Runner;' a bit darker and with the definition of a reflection in a fun house mirror.  And it's all quite effective, especially in contrast to the `real' world of the past in which Cole finds himself. But what really makes it interesting and keeps the audience involved is the fact that you know everything that Cole knows, which allows you to share his frustration in dealing with an unimaginable situation, and it makes it a tense and exciting experience.  It works because Gilliam has created a very real fantasy world, as well as a believable `present' that for the purpose of the film is actually the `past.'  The plot becomes fairly complex at times, but after a couple of twists and turns, it all comes together and makes sense in the end.  	Bruce Willis does a good job in this one, creating a character that is actually quite unlike any other he's ever done.  Cole is certainly heroic, but not in the same straightforward manner as John McClane in the `Die Hard' series, or the more subtle, understated hero of `Unbreakable,' David Dunn. And the emotional character development you see in Cole is credibly realized, for which Willis and Gilliam both deserve a nod of recognition, as it's a good piece of acting by Willis and a demonstration of Gilliam's ability as a director.  It all comes about quite naturally through the narrative of the story, which makes it believable and very real.	Brad Pitt, meanwhile, practically steals the show in his supporting role as Jeffrey Goines, the well-to-do idealist with sensibilities that are just a notch off center.  It's a memorable character, created with nuance and detail, and he deservedly received an Oscar nomination for it.  Also giving a notable performance is Madeleine Stowe as Dr. Kathryn Railly, the psychiatrist who meets up with Cole and attempts to sort out his psyche while trying to find out just who he really is and where he came from.   
	The supporting cast includes Jon Seda (Jose), Christopher Plummer (Dr. Goines), David Morse (Dr. Peters), Frank Gorshin (Dr. Fletcher) and Michael Chance (Scarface).  With an ending worthy of M. Night Shyamalan, `12 Monkeys' is an engrossing action/suspense/drama that will keep you going until the very end.  And in retrospect, few movies fall just outside of a specific genre or category the way this one does, so for the sake of argument, I'll create one and call it `Gilliam Noir'-- a new genre especially for Gilliam's films (and others like them), including `Brazil' and `The Fisher King.'  Unique films that deserve their own unique place as paragons of cinematic achievement.  It's all about the artistry of film, and the magic of the movies.  I rate this one 8/10.",8,1,2,28 July 2001
Stripes," With These Guys on the Front Lines...
","In one of his funniest comedies, Bill Murray takes on the U.S. Army, and without question, with guys like this on the front lines, we can all sleep a little easier at night.  `Stripes,' directed by Ivan Reitman, is the story of John Winger (Murray), who in one day loses his girl, his job, his car and his apartment.  So what's a guy to do after that, but join the Army?  But he doesn't go alone, oh no-- he also talks his best friend, Russell Ziskey (Harold Ramis) into joining with him.  And just like that they find themselves at boot camp, face to face with one of the most formidable Drill Instructors every to grace the silver screen, Sergeant Hulka (Warren Oates), and surrounded by as motley a group of raw recruits as anyone could imagine. Among them, there's Dewey Oxburger (John Candy), known as `Ox,' who plans to emerge from boot camp a `lean, mean fighting machine'; and `Cruiser (John Diehl),' who joined up to beat the draft (Hulka:  `Son, there isn't a draft, anymore.'  Cruiser:  `There was one?'); and Francis Soyer (George Jenesky), known as `Psycho' (`Call me Francis, and I'll kill you.  Touch my stuff, and I'll kill you.  Touch me...and I'll kill you.'  Hulka:  `Lighten up, Francis...').	The pressure is on for Hulka and his men, when Colonel Glass (Lance LeGault) informs Captain Stillman (John Larroquette) that the `General' is looking for a squad of crack new recruits to man a special project, and Hulka's boys have been chosen.  The project involves a secret weapon, an `urban assault' vehicle, that is to be unveiled on their base in Germany shortly.  But first, Hulka has to get his troops through basic, which will be a minor miracle in itself, even though Winger goes `Out on a limb,' and offers to be their leader.  And things proceed just as badly as you would expect, not only on the obstacle course, but off, when Winger and Ziskey get mixed up with a couple of female M.Ps., Stella (P.J. Soles) and Louise (Sean Young), and Ox gets coerced (by Winger, of course) into taking part in a female mud-wrestling event at a local night spot.  	Along the way, Reitman sets up the situations for some serious laughs, and keeps it all on track with a good pace and excellent timing.  Murray is terrific as Winger, with a performance that puts a generous helping of `dry' in the expression `dry humor.'  He plays it all so straight, so serious, from his quips and one liners (watching a TV promo for the Army, `This looks pretty good--'), to his full blown inspirational speech to the troops on the night before their final test at basic training (`We're all very different people.  We're not Spartans, we're not Watusi, we're Americans, with a capital A.'  That means our forefathers were thrown out of every decent country in the world--'), that it makes it all the more hilarious.  He never tries to be `funny,' or fish for laughs, which is really what makes this movie work so well.  Murray is perhaps the best in the business at playing this kind of humor and putting it across (Ben Stiller would be a close second).  	Harold Ramis and John Candy also make invaluable contributions that make this one fly.  Watch Ramis, reacting to what Candy is saying as `Ox,' as explains why he joined the Army; it makes what Ox is saying twice as funny. And Ox, talking about what a `shy guy' he is, and how `You may have noticed, I have this weight problem--'  And Oates, as well, gives a singular performance that makes Hulka a real person, beyond the typical stereotype of the hard-nosed D.I.  His portrayal, taken out of context, is one that would stand up even in more serious fare, like Kubrick's `Full Metal Jacket.'	The supporting cast includes Judge Reinhold (Elmo), John Voldstad (Stillman's Aide), Roberta Leighton (Anita), Antone Pagan (Hector), Fran Ryan (Dowager in Cab), Dave Thomas (M.C.) and William Lucking (Recruiter). From beginning to end, `Stripes' is a fun-filled laugh riot that's filled with memorable scenes and a plethora of lines you'll be quoting forever. This is one you can watch over and over again, with a bunch of characters you're never going to forget.  Winger and Ziskey, Ox, Psycho, Cruiser. These are the guys who Demi Moore, as Galloway in `A Few Good Men,' could have been talking about when, in response to the question of why she likes these guys so much, replies, `Because they stand on a wall, and they say nothing is going to hurt you tonight, not on my watch...'  It kind of makes you think.  Or, as Cruiser might say, `Yeah...  About what?'  I rate this one 10/10.",10,21,40,11 June 2001
Beauty and the Beast," A Transporting Experience
","Indeed, it's a tale as old as time, with a complex message that is as ageless as it is universal; but beneath all the layers it can be summed up very simply:  love one another, and refrain from judging others who `seem' to be `different.'  And leave it to Disney to present it in such a way that it can be embraced and understood by young and old alike as they have here, in one of their best animated features ever, `Beauty and the Beast,' directed by Gary Trousdale.  When a young Prince fails the test of an enchantress disguised as an old hag, she transforms him into a hideous beast, as he is destined to remain until he opens his heart and learns how to love and be loved in return.  And so that he'll know where he stands as time goes by, she gives him an enchanted rose, which will bloom until his twenty-first birthday, and he has only until the last petal falls from the flower to effect the change within himself that will be his salvation. 
	The beast, however, seems doomed, as he shuts himself away, alone in his castle, taking up a reclusive existence far from everyone and everything. Until, one day, a beautiful young woman named Belle shows up at his doorstep.  Belle is searching for her inventor father, Maurice, who disappeared while taking one of his latest inventions to the fair; and his trail leads Belle to the castle of the Beast, where she discovers he is being held prisoner, having run afoul of the Beast by trespassing while lost during the night of his journey.  Repulsed by the appearance of the Beast, Belle nevertheless strikes a bargain with him:  If he will release her father, she will stay in his place.  The Beast agrees, with the stipulation that she must remain with him forever.  And as the Beast casts Belle's father from the castle and sends him on his way, Belle's fate seems sealed. The only hope now for either Belle or the Beast lies in the remote possibility that true love may somehow prevail before the last petal of the enchanted rose falls.	With the help of a richly textured screenplay (by Linda Woolverton) that invests the characters with a depth of humanity that is often lacking even in `non' animated films, and an Oscar winning score by Alan Menken, director Trousdale provides some real insights into human nature in this retelling of the familiar story of how true love can change even the darkest and coldest of hearts.  There's magic in this film, which holds an enchantment of it's own, and the message is presented ever so subtly and with a sensitivity that draws you in gradually until you are so caught up in the story that you become immersed and totally involved without being consciously aware of it. It's a film that enfolds you and takes you where it will, and you go willingly.  A beautifully rendered and realized film that successfully transcends it's genre, it is the first animated feature ever to be recognized and rewarded with an Oscar nomination for Best Movie (quite a feat in itself, as it received the nod over such films as `The Fisher King,' `Fried Green Tomatoes,' `Thelma and Louise' and John Singleton's `Boyz N the Hood' that year).  	The talented cast supplying the voices of the characters includes Paige O'Hara (Belle), Robby Benson (The Beast), Richard White (Gaston), Jerry Orbach (Lumiere), David Ogden Stiers (Cogsworth), Angela Lansbury (Mrs. Potts), Bradley Pierce (Chip), Rex Everhart (Maurice), Jesse Corti (LeFou), Hal Smith (Phillipe), Jo Ann Worley (Wardrobe), Brian Cummings (Stove), Alvin Epstein (Bookseller) and Kimmy Robertson (Featherduster).  There's a scene in this film that is so entrancing and so emotionally involving that it stands up against the best from any drama ever made:  As Angela Lansbury (as Mrs. Potts) sings the Oscar winning title song, Belle begins to perceive the true nature of the man within the Beast; and it's no longer the cold-hearted Prince upon whom the enchantress cast her spell, because he has changed.  And as they come together and the Beast takes Belle in his arms, sweeping her in dance across the elegant ballroom floor, it becomes one of those rare cinematic `moments' that are entirely transporting, and it does, indeed, take you away.  It's a memorable scene that exemplifies the quality and craftsmanship of this film, as does the scene in which the Beast is at last transformed; that such emotion can be captured and expressed in an animated film is an exemplary accomplishment, and it's all a part of why `Beauty and the Beast' is one of Disney's all time greatest films. 
	One final note:  Stay for the credits to hear Alan Menken and Howard Ashman's title song once again, this time performed by Celine Dion and Peabo Bryson.  Hypnotically beautiful, this version has a magic all it's own and makes the perfect ending to an enchanting experience.  It's all a part of the magic of the movies.

The English Patient," A Magnificent Motion Picture
","In a style reminiscent of the best of David Lean, this romantic love story sweeps across the screen with epic proportions equal to the vast desert regions against which it is set.  It's a film which purports that one does not choose love, but rather that it's love that does the choosing, regardless of who, where or when; and furthermore, that it's a matter of the heart often contingent upon prevailing conditions and circumstances.  And thus is the situation in `The English Patient,' directed by Anthony Minghella, the story of two people who discover passion and true love in the most inopportune of places and times, proving that when it is predestined, love will find a way.It's WWII; flying above the African desert, Hungarian Count Laszlo de Almasy (Ralph Fiennes) is shot down, his biplane mistaken for an enemy aircraft. And though he survives the crash, he is severely burned.  To his great good fortune, however, he is rescued by a tribe of nomads and winds up in a hospital.  But existing conditions are governed by circumstances of war, and Almasy soon becomes one of many patients being transported via convoy to a different facility.  Upon reaching Italy, he is too weak and ill to continue on, and a Canadian nurse, Hana (Juliette Binoche), volunteers to stay behind with him at an abandoned monastery.Hana soon discovers that her charge is something of a man of mystery, as Almasy remembers nothing of his past, and not even his own name.  Thought to be English, the only clues pointing to who he is are contained in a book found in his possession after the crash, but even they are as cryptic as Hana's patient.  Slowly, however, under prompting from Hana, Almasy begins to remember bits and pieces of his life, and his story begins to unfold. And his memory is helped along even more by the appearance of a mysterious stranger named Caravaggio (Willem Dafoe), who suspects that Almasy is the man he's been looking for-- a man with whom he wants to settle a score. But, burned beyond recognition, Almasy may or may not be that man. Meanwhile, Almasy's memories continue to surface; memories of a woman he loved, Katherine Clifton (Kristin Scott Thomas)-- as well as memories of Katherine's husband, Geoffrey (Colin Firth).  And, crippled in mind and body as he is, those memories become the only thing left to which he can cling with any hope at all, even as his life seems to be slipping farther away with each passing moment.In addition to directing, Anthony Minghella also wrote the screenplay for this film, which he adapted from the novel by Michael Ondaatje.  The result is an epic saga presented in the tradition of Lean's `Doctor Zhivago' and `Lawrence of Arabia'; a magnificent film that fills the screen and the senses with unprecedented grandeur and beauty.  Simply put, Minghella's film is genius realized; crafted and delivered with a poetic perfection, watching it is like watching a Monet come to life.  From the opening frames, Minghella casts a hypnotic spell over his audience that is binding and transporting, with a story that has an emotional beauty that equals the engagingly stunning and vibrant images brought to life by John Seale's remarkable cinematography; images that virtually fill the screen as well as the soul of the viewer.  In every sense, this is a film of rare eloquence, with a striking emotional capacity that facilitates an experience that is truly transcendental.  Nominated in twelve categories, it deservedly received a total of nine Oscars, including Best Picture, Director, Supporting Actress (Binoche) and Cinematography.If one had to choose a single word to describe the `essence' of this film, it would be `excellence.'  Even an extraordinary film, however, does not receive nine Oscars without performances that are extraordinary in kind; and the performances given by Ralph Fiennes and Kristin Scott Thomas here transcend the term `Oscar worthy.'  Nominated for Best Actor for his portrayal of Almasy (Geoffrey Rush was awarded the gold for `Shine'), Fiennes has never been better, achieving an emotional depth with his character that is nearly palpable.  Private and introspective, Almasy is not by his very nature an individual to whom the audience will be able to form an intimate connection; Fiennes, however, finds a way to open that emotional door just enough to let you in, enough so that you taste the honest passion welling up within him.  And it works.  Almasy does not seek your friendship; he will, however, gain your compassion.Kristen Scott Thomas, too, received an Oscar nomination for Best Actress (Frances McDormand received the award for `Fargo') for her portrayal of Katherine, a woman whose stoic countenance masks the emotional conflict raging within her, born of the forbidden passion that enslaves her and yet to which she gives herself willingly, casting off her shackles of repression to embrace a love so strong it threatens to consume her.  The reserve Katherine must maintain evokes the empathy of the audience, as Scott Thomas successfully mines the emotional depths of her character to the greatest possible effect.  It's the kind of performance that draws you in and holds you fast, taking you as it does beyond that curtain of hypocrisy that dictates what must be if only for the sake of appearances, and allows you to experience a true sense of unbridled passion.  Understated and shaded with subtlety, it's terrific work by Kristin Scott Thomas.Binoche gives a stunning, affecting performance, as well, as the kindhearted nurse, Hana; it is her humanity, in fact, which defines love in it's purest sense and offers a balanced perspective of it within the context of the film.  Her relationship with Kip (Naveen Andrews) affords us a glimpse of passion of another kind, which contrasts effectively with the intensity of that between Almasy and Katherine.  `The English Patient' is a film that will move you and fill you emotionally; one you will not want to see end. 10/10.",10,208,280,29 July 2002
That Thing You Do!," Meet The Oh-NEED-ers!
","Tom Hanks wrote and directed this paean to the glory days of rock n' roll, an era in which even the wildest music still reflected a certain innocence, long since gone if not forgotten, before the advent of Metal, Rap and Grunge.  It's 1964, and `That Thing You Do!' is about to become a hit record for a small band out of Erie, Pa., who call themselves the `Oneders (pronounced Wonders),' but who are destined to begin their musical odyssey know as the `Oh-NEED-ers.'  Drummer Guy Patterson (Tom Everett Scott) works in his father's appliance store, but when the band's drummer breaks his arm right before a gig, Guy is asked to sit in for him.  And it winds up being a case of being in the right place at the right time for Guy, like when Ringo joined The Beatles, and the rest-- as they say-- is history.	It's a lively, upbeat tale in which luck, talent and chance all play a part.  Hanks presents the upside of making it in the music business, including the adrenaline rush of hearing one's own song on the radio for the first time, as well as all the hoopla that surrounds those who happen to be in the spotlight at the moment.  But he also shows the downside:  The creative differences and in-fighting which plagues just about any band ever formed to some degree at one time or another, the personality conflicts and petty jealousies that are apt to surface at any time, and the reality of dealing with bloated egos, adoring fans and rude, insensitive record label executives who could care less about the talent that is putting the coins in their coffers, as long as they're selling records.	For the most part, Hanks keeps it lighthearted and cheerful, which-- along with the original songs (some of which he helped write)-- makes this an entertaining, fun and thoroughly enjoyable movie.  He sugar-coats the dark side of it all to a certain extent, which makes the bad things that happen a bit easier to swallow, though it compromises the impact of the events somewhat as they unfold.  Then again, he manages to maintain the credibility and integrity of his story, and after all, `this' is the film he wanted to make, and he presents it exactly as intended.  Hanks captures a sense of time and place with this film, and also that same sense of reality conveyed by The Beatles' film, `A Hard Day's Night,' intentionally avoiding the more stoic reality of the more recent `Almost Famous.'  All three films are fairly true to life, but with varying degrees of honesty.  It's a matter of whether to `imply,' as Hanks has done, or to be explicit, as Cameron Crowe chose to do with his film.	With this film Hanks proves that he is equally as adept behind the camera as he is in front of it; he knows exactly where he wants to take his audience and when, and he does it quite successfully.  He also extracts some nice performances from his actors, especially Scott, Johnathon Schaech (Jimmy, the lead singer), Steve Zahn (Lenny, on guitar) and Liv Tyler as Faye Dolan, Jimmy's girlfriend, who takes the brunt of the blunt edge of Jimmy's sudden notoriety.  Hanks also turns in a notable performance himself, as Mr. White, the representative of one of the labels interested in the Oneders.	The supporting cast includes Ethan Embry (The Bass Player), Charlize Theron (Tina), Obba Babatunde (Lamarr), Giovanni Ribisi (Chad), Chris Ellis (Phil), Alex Rocco (Sol), Bill Cobbs (Del Paxton), Peter Scolari (Tony), Rita Wilson (Marguerite), Chris Isaak (Uncle Bob) and Kevin Pollak (Boss Koss).  What `Happy Days' was to television, `That Thing You Do!' is to movies; a film that evokes that perceived sense of  innocence of a time when life at least seemed simpler.  For the more distance you put between the present and the `Good old days,' the better they get.  In reality, they may not have been better, but Hanks preserves that illusion by giving us a picture of the way we'd at least like to think things were.  And it's more than a pleasant diversion; this is a feel-good film you'll be able to enjoy time and again, because it takes you to a place you'd like to be-- a place you've been to before at one time or another, in one way or another, if only in your mind. And that Hanks can take you there so readily is not only a credit to his talent, but another fine example of the pure magic of the movies.  I rate this one 9/10.",9,66,71,22 April 2001
The Others," Amenabar Achieves the Impossible
","Films that deal with the supernatural, whether in direct or implied terms, are more often than not disappointing, in that they rarely manage to deliver on their promise.  Moreover, films of that same school touted as being `scary,' as well, are usually even more of a let down; so a film that can truly bring a supernatural theme to fruition and be frightening-- joltingly scary even-- in the balance, is one to be celebrated.  `The Others,' written and directed by Aleiandro Amenabar, is a film to be celebrated.  Unlike most films of the genre, this is a true sojourn into regions beyond the known that actually takes you to that final destination.  And when your mouth is so dry you can't swallow, and the palms of your hands have gone clammy cold with sweat, you'll know you've arrived; that Amenabar has succeeded in taking you to that place where few filmmakers dare to even attempt to go. By the end of the film, it's clear that when Amenabar makes a promise, he keeps it.The Channel Islands, 1945:  World War II has ended, and in a picturesque country mansion, the mistress of the manor, Grace Stewart (Nicole Kidman), is at the end of her tether; she has not heard from, nor about, her husband, Charles (Christopher Eccleston) since he went off to war, and all of her servants-- including her children's nanny-- have inexplicably disappeared without notice and without a trace.  Caring for her two children, Anne (Alakina Mann) and Nicholas (James Bentley), without help, is beginning to overwhelm her, as they suffer from a rare disease that makes them vulnerable to light any brighter than the essential amount of candlepower, a condition that demands the utmost vigilance on the part of their caretaker.  And at the moment, that means Grace, alone, in a house by necessity shrouded in darkness.Help arrives, however, in the form of Ms. Bertha Mills (Fionnula Flanagan) and her companions, Mr. Tuttle (Eric Sykes), and a young girl named Lydia (Elaine Cassidy), in response to an add placed by Grace in a local newspaper.  All experienced in service, they are the answer to Grace's immediate problems, and she puts them to work immediately.  But it soon becomes apparent to Ms. Mills and the others, that something is amiss in the household; something to do with Grace, who seems to be having trouble coping.  Still, there's more:  Anne insists that she has seen `others' in the house, including a young boy she calls `Victor.'  And, according to Anne, Victor claims that the house belongs to him and those with him.  The real problem, though, is the fact that no one else can see him.  Only Anne. And it's about to take Grace to the very edge of what's left of her sanity. If, indeed, there is any left at all by that time.More than a supernatural thriller, what Amenabar has created here is a gem that stands out from among the rest because of it's sheer purity and brilliance; a diamond with it's own unique cut that dazzles the mind and the eye with it's perfection.  From the opening frames, he sets a deliberate pace and begins to sow the seeds of doubt and question, opening that Pandora's Box of enticement that allows you to consider that otherworldly devices are actually at play here.  In the quietude of the atmosphere he's so deftly created, he winds the tension slowly and subtly until the wheel can turn no more, and just at the point at which others films would fail because they simply cannot deliver on the promise of what has preceded, he hits you with the reality of what is happening, and in a way that will jar your senses.  He does not manipulate and he does not play games; he quite simply and directly delivers one of the best endings ever filmed within this particular genre, especially, and moreover, one that will stand against any of the best from any category.  Because, regardless of genre, very few films have ever delivered so well on what has been promised as the story unfolds. 
Nicole Kidman was nominated for an Oscar for Best Actress for her performance in `Moulin Rouge' this year (and deservedly so), but her portrayal of Grace Stewart is the one that should have put her at center stage and clutching the gold on the big night.  Her presentation of Grace is introspective, subtle and reserved; understated and convincing, she fills the screen with a dark charm that is reminiscent, and yet something of the antithesis, of Grace Kelly.  And her screen presence has never been more dynamic.  She enables you to feel her fear, anger, confusion and frustration as the drama moves toward the denouement, and it is Grace through whom you most experience the impact of that final, breathtaking scene, when all is at last revealed.  A truly memorable performance from the gifted and beautiful Kidman, and one that is destined to be more appreciated with the passing of time.Flanagan turns in a memorable performance, as well, creating a character in Ms. Mills that transcends the stereotype of one `in service,' and successfully adds to the aura of mystery surrounding the events as they transpire.  It's a portrayal that demonstrates how important a good character actor is, and how much it can add to a film. 
The supporting cast includes Renee Asherson (Old Lady), Gordon Reid (Assistant), Keith Allen (Mr. Marlish), Michelle Fairley (Mrs. Marlish) and Alexander Vince as Victor.  Riveting entertainment that will slow your breathing and increase your heart rate, `The Others' is an inspired film that offers one of, if not `the' most satisfying endings ever produced in the realm of supernatural cinema.  Amenabar is a magician who has performed the impossible:  He's made the `Super' in supernatural viable and real, succeeding where almost all others who have tried failed.  It's an awe-inspiring accomplishment from an accomplished filmmaker; and it's the magic of the movies.  10/10.",10,2,4,3 June 2002
Home Alone," An Anomaly of the Genre
","Take a cheeky eight-year-old, put him in a situation he has to slapstick his way out of with the kind of antics most cartoon characters wouldn't survive, and what you have is one of the most wildly popular, commercially successful comedies of all time.  And when it's over, though most likely you'll have had a good time, you'll be tempted to ask the question:  Why? Because `Home Alone,' directed by Chris Columbus and written by John Hughes, is mediocre at best, though it does have it's moments.  It's a matter of the filmmakers being very astute, perhaps, and wisely mixing in a potpourri of elements with universal appeal and touching upon that common nerve they calculated would give just about anyone in the audience something to which they could relate.  And they were right.  Kids, Christmas, family, vacation, independence, a scary situation; it's all in here.  But, interestingly enough, it lacks the sentimental value that would seemingly have made this a movie one could truly embrace.  As it is, it's engaging fare, but somehow manages to keep the viewer at arm's length.  Then again, maybe that's even part of the appeal; it may be that audiences at this particular time and place were more comfortable just watching without having to invest anything of themselves in order to have a good time.	This was, after all, 1990, and this film played to a generation weaned on more than a decade of Saturday Night Live, whose keen sense of biting satire and parody definitely had an influence on the mind-set of audiences everywhere.  And is that a bad thing?  No, absolutely not.  It merely points up one possible reason why a film centered around an eight-year-old with a somewhat derisive attitude could be so wholeheartedly received.  Also, it may be that the second half of the film, with it's over-the-top slapstick, is what made the final impression on the audience.  And this IS funny stuff; and it's going to get to even those who usually prefer humor that doesn't involve slapstick, because it's so well done.  Again, credit the filmmakers with having their fingers on the pulse of our culture and standards at the time.  But you also have to give credit to Joe Pesci and Daniel Stern who bring the `Wet Bandits,' Harry and Marv,  to life, and know how to put across this kind of comedy, which is no easy task.	The story itself is simple:  The extended McCallister family sets off for a Christmas vacation in Paris, and inadvertently, Kevin (Macaulay Culkin) gets left behind.  Left alone.  At home.  Where, rising to the occasion beyond anything even the most prodigious teenager could manage, he discovers the thrill of being independent and thwarts a pair of bungling burglars in the balance.  Meanwhile, mom and dad (Catherine O'Hara as Kate, John Heard as Peter) go out of their minds when they get to Paris and discover what has happened.  If only they knew what an ingenious and imaginative son they had...	Culkin is certainly a cute kid, but can he act?  Well, the jury is still out on that one.  It's hard to say, since the dialogue he is given is so ridiculously above that of an eight-year-old, and the situations he encounters are so far-fetched, that there is no real frame of reference by which to consider it objectively.  His timing and rhythm are lacking, however, that much is clear.  His responses-- or, if you will, the punch lines he delivers-- are always a beat behind what they should be.  And it robs the humor of the spontaneity that would have made it funnier, even hilarious.  As it is, the only real laughs come from Kevin's assault on the Wet Bandits, and there are plenty to be had there.	Pesci and Stern become the real stars of the show as they play out their slapstick antics, which are truly deserving of the laughs they generate. Their expressions of incredulity in the face of the violence that is visited upon them is what makes this movie.  Everything else merely sets the stage for Harry and Marv's descent into the maelstrom.  And what Pesci and Stern do here should not be taken for granted, nor taken lightly artistically.  To put this kind of humor across takes some real talent on the part of consummate professionals, and Pesci and Stern certainly deliver it.  Their secret?  They play it straight, which keeps the silliness out of it.  Had they played it strictly as farce, it simply wouldn't have had the same impact; but by playing to the characters in the situation, rather than to a situation involving characters, it works.  And, once again, chalk up another one for Columbus and Hughes, who really know how to deliver this kind of material.	The only truly poignant moment in the film involves Kevin's encounter with a mysterious neighbor, `Old Man Marley,' played wonderfully by character actor/poet Roberts Blossom.  The revelation of his secret earlier in the film sets up the purest moment of the ending, and though it is brief, it's inspired and adds a much needed perspective to the story.	The supporting cast includes Devin Ratray (Buzz), Angela Goethals (Linnie), Gerry Bamman (Uncle Frank), Hillary Wolf (Aunt Leslie), Ralph Foody (Gangster Johnny), Billie Bird (Irene), Bill Erwin (Ed) and John Candy, memorable in the role of Gus Polinski, the Polka Band shuttle Chief. Considering the ratio between this movie's substance and the success it still enjoys today, `Home Alone' is something of an anomaly in the history of the genre.  it lacks insight, yet delivers some real belly laughs.  It lacks a single character the audience can truly embrace, yet is accepted overwhelmingly as is.  It lacks inspiration, yet is an inspired film in the way it is crafted and delivered.  It's one you're probably going to like and enjoy, but upon reflection may wonder, `Why.'  And the answer?  Who can say. Go figure.  It's the magic of the movies.  6/10.",6,5,9,18 December 2001
Insomnia," Outstanding Performance by Pacino
","The breathtaking beauty of a remote area of Alaska provides the setting for this film, and the natural splendor of the surroundings offers a thought provoking contrast between the serenity of the landscape and the ugliness visited upon it by one of it's inhabitants.  In the thriller `Insomnia,' director Christopher Nolan examines the myriad faces of evil and the far-reaching effects of wrongdoing, whether perpetrated straightforwardly as a heinous crime, or in the ill conceived notion of subverting the law in a quest for justice.  But he also looks beyond the objectivity of premeditation at how certain physical variables can subjectively affect the psychological aspects of the duplicity.  Specifically, what happens to the body-- and especially to the mind-- when deprived of sleep for an extended period of time.  And especially when it comes at a critical juncture; at a time when, above all else, the mind must be absolutely clear and sharp, when judgments must be passed and decisions made.  Can a web of deceit, woven amid a struggle between the mind and the body, stand fast?  And if so, for how long?  How long can one prevail against the proclivities of human nature, in a place where the sun never sets, and the mind cannot find rest.	L.A. detective Will Dormer (Al Pacino), and his partner, Hap Eckhart (Martin Donovan), have been given a special assignment:  The investigation of the murder of a seventeen-year-old girl in the small town of Nightmute, Alaska.  Their detail comes on the heels of a certain internal affairs investigation currently being conducted within the L.A.P.D., which may involve the high-profile Dormer, a good cop who has been putting away the bad guys for more years than he can remember.  And if the I.A. affair goes south, some criminals Dormer has been instrumental in convicting may see freedom.  So the change of venue for the detectives comes at an auspicious time; sometimes distance can be a good thing.	Dormer goes into the case with the confidence provided him by years on the job.  He is lucid, and on top of things immediately.  What he finds in Nightmute, however, is a killer who is not only meticulous, but who has a wild card up his sleeve and begins to play it not long after Dormer hits town.  It's the time of year when the sun never sets, and the killer realizes that it is going to affect Dormer's sleep, and subsequently, his perceptions and actions.  And he's determined to help the situation along with some untimely phone calls and some well chosen words.  Dormer's onto the game immediately, but after a couple of days of sleeplessness, his mental faculties begin to deteriorate, and it leads to a situation involving Eckhart that puts an entirely new spin on the matters at hand.  Things get sticky, and Dormer's judgment becomes questionable.  He struggles to keep himself together, because he knows one thing for certain:  The killer has crossed a line from which there is no return, and he's going to kill again. And it's up to Dormer to stop him before it happens.	As with his previous effort, `Memento,' Christopher Nolan has crafted and delivered a film that is emotionally stirring and initially, at least, devoid of any absolutes (or if there are any, they are soon lost in Dormer's sleeplessness induced mental haze), to which he adds a moral dilemma that makes it all entirely involving and which successfully draws the audience into the action as the story unfolds.  it becomes an incisive character study that affords you Dormer's perspective while allowing you to experience his situation seemingly first hand.  Nolan gradually takes you from the rational thought processes that to Dormer are the norm, to the murky regions of the ambiguous into which he descends as the sleeplessness overcomes and overwhelms him.  And the fact that Dormer's impaired mental state is so significant-- inasmuch as the direction it takes the story-- makes this a rather unique film; it's an interesting angle, and quite different from the usual considerations offered by the typical crime/thriller/drama.  Most importantly, Nolan knows how to present it effectively, and builds the tension in direct proportion to Dormer's descent, which maintains that necessary edge right up to the climax.	By the end of the film, Pacino/Dormer really looks as though he hasn't slept in days; it's a critical aspect of the story, upon which the credibility of the film depends, and which it achieves, without question. Some credit has to go to the make-up provided by Gitte Axen, but ultimately, what makes this film so convincing-- and such an unqualified success-- is Al Pacino's performance.  As he demonstrates here, he is arguably one of the top two leading actors in the business (the other being De Niro).  He has the ability to create a completely new character with every new film, and he's always convincing, whether taking it over-the-top (Tony Montana, `Scarface'; Vincent Hanna, `Heat'), using a more introspective approach (Michael Corleone, `The Godfather') or finding the necessary reserve that fits a particular character and makes him believable (as he does here with Will Dormer).  This is a studied portrayal, presented in subtle shadings and tone, and one that should easily earn him an Oscar nomination.	Turning in a solid performance, also, is Robin Williams, who seems to be taking a page out of Pacino's book by finding the kind of restraint he needed to make his character work.  Williams has played a variety of roles in his career, but never has he played so against type as his portrayal of Walter Finch in this film; and he does it well.  He's entirely convincing-- his Finch is very real and disquietingly believable, in that his outward appearance is so normal, while in reality he is capable of deeds most vile. His true nature is undetectable, and as such, he's your worst nightmare.  It makes Dormer's conundrum even more pronounced, and helps to make `Insomnia' a riveting and thoroughly engrossing film.  9/10.",9,0,1,28 May 2002
L.A. Confidential," Compelling Drama From Curtis Hanson
","A study of life in Los Angeles and corruption within the Police Force of the City of Angels in the early 1950's, `L.A. Confidential,' directed by Curtis Hanson, is an intense, compelling drama starring Kevin Spacey, Russell Crowe and Guy Pearce.  It's a time of growth in Southern California; freeways are on the drawing board, glitz and glamor abounds in Hollywood, and there's a lot of money to be made, especially for anyone with the right connections.  But there's a dark undercurrent running throughout the city as well.  The criminal element is thriving under the auspices of gangster Mickey Cohen, and it's a time when certain officers of the law tend to mete out their own, personal brand of justice, which doesn't necessarily land them on the right side of the fence, nor of the law.  There's graft within the L.A.P.D., and a prevalent misuse of authority and lack of ethics that begins at the top, filters down and permeates the entire force.  And when Cohen finally goes to jail, a number of his `associates' begin turning up dead, and strange and untoward things begin to happen in and around Hollywood.  Finally, a nocturnal massacre at a place called the `Nite Owl Cafe' kicks off an investigation that ultimately involves two young officers, Bud White (Crowe) and Ed Exley (Pearce), and a veteran of the narcotics squad, Jack Vincennes (Spacey).  And it isn't long before the proverbial can of worms is wrenched open and, needless to say, many lives are soon destined to be changed forever. 	Working from an intelligent and extremely well written script (co-written by Hanson and Brian Helgeland, adapted from the novel by James Ellroy), Hanson delivers this tightly woven, intricate story with a deft hand and an eye for detail that transports the audience to another time and place.  At the heart of the tale are White and Exley, both of whom are passionate about their work and the pursuit of justice, though they differ greatly in their respective methods and basic perceptions of how things should be and why. And it's this contrast in personalities that becomes the impetus for the drama; what makes these guys tick, and which buttons can be pushed (and by whom) to get them going.  It's an examination of the complexities of human nature, and Hanson handles it all with skill and precision. 	If you hadn't noticed Russell Crowe before this film, you will forever after.  His screen presence here is explosive, and he brings an intensity to his character that is almost unsettling.  You can see it in his eyes; the turmoil lying just beneath the surface, ready to erupt at any moment.  You can feel it just watching him.  It's a dynamic, multi-layered performance that is unforgettable.  Guy Pearce turns in a notable performance as well, entirely credible and believable, though he lacks Crowe's charisma and presence.  But, admittedly, the character of Exley doesn't command the sympathy that White's does; White, despite his propensity for violent action, exhibits a vulnerability that is absent in Exley, who comes off as rather cold and inaccessible.  But again, it's the differences between these two that gives the movie it's momentum.  Kevin Spacey also turns in another outstanding performance as the slick, self-assured `celeb' of the force, Jack Vincennes, the cop whose ethics have become self-serving and who's lost sight of why he joined the department in the first place.  Spacey readily conveys the fact that there is more to Vincennes than meets the eye, which we discover as the story unfolds.  And it's when we learn what's hidden beneath the surface that we realize what a terrific job Spacey has done in bringing this character to life.  And, not to be outdone by her co-stars, Kim Basinger (Lynn Bracken) turns in a performance as a Veronica Lake look-alike that won her an Oscar for Best Supporting Actress. 	With a supporting cast that includes Danny DeVito (Sid), David Strathairn (Pierce Patchett), Ron Rifkin (D.A. Ellis Loew) and Matt McCoy (Brett Chase), `L.A. Confidential' is an entertaining, absorbing drama that will linger in your memory for days after you've seen it.  Filmed on location in and around L.A. and Hollywood, this is a superlative piece of filmmaking that must be seen, especially by anyone who truly loves movies that are made the way movies `ought' to be made; this is one of them.

X-Men," Mutants ARE Among Us
","Rarely does a movie come along that works so well on so many levels, with the appeal to engage an audience of young and old alike.  `X-Men,' directed by Bryan Singer, is one of them.  Simply put, there is something here for everyone; there's the obvious story (which is excellent, by the way) which can be taken at face value and will be the attraction of the wider audience, and then there is the allegory to ponder for those who choose to go the distance (sorry, folks, no clues; you have to do it on your own, it's part of what makes this movie so good).  Just be advised, there is a whole lot more to this movie than meets the eye, and it's so well done and delivered, from the directing to the outstanding performances to the dazzling special effects.  Singer has done a superb job of bringing this all to the screen; his pace and timing couldn't be better, and he seems to have an innate sense of what makes this material work, and how to put it across.  This film could so easily have become just another sci-fi `B' rated throw away in the wrong hands, but with Singer at the helm, and with such a great cast, it doesn't come anywhere near sinking to that level.  There is also a restraint in the use of the special effects here that makes them all the more spectacular, and again, Singer must be given credit for that as well. 	As far as the performances, this movie should launch the relatively unknown Hugh Jackman (Wolverine) toward stardom.  He's charismatic and has a magnetic screen presence; he's given Wolverine real depth and credibility and emerges as the star of the show.  Anna Paquin (Rogue) also stands out, creating a truly empathic and sympathetic character that makes her accessible and allows her to connect with the audience.  Other notable performances are turned in by Patrick Stewart (Professor X) and Ian McKellen (Magneto).  The supporting cast includes Halle Berry (Storm), Famke Janssen (Dr. Jean Grey), James Marsden (Cyclops), Bruce Davison (Senator Kelly), Tyler Mane (Sabretooth), Rebecca Romijn-Stamos (Mystique) and Ray Park (Toad). 	There is a depth to this story of mutant's living among us that comes, quite frankly, as a pleasant surprise.  The dialogue is believable, and the characters are distinctly drawn and avoid stereotype.  Again, there is nothing about this movie that can be dismissed out-of-hand; even the mutant's names are cryptic, which adds yet another level to the story. Whether or not it was the conscious intent of the author and creator of the X-Men is open to speculation; what is important is that it works, and makes it all that much more engaging.  `X-Men' is destined to become a huge success, and will no doubt spawn welcomed and eagerly anticipated sequels. This movie is further evidence that since `The Matrix' came into being, the genre of Science Fiction has risen to an unprecedented height, the progression of which began with George Lucas and `Star Wars' in 1977.  Since then the cinematic Universe has never been the same, and `X-Men' is proof that it will only continue to expand in the future.  I rate this one 9/10.",9,0,0,12 September 2000
Sleepy Hollow," Gothic Horror From Tim Burton
","The tale of Ichabod Crane comes to life as never before, in this richly textured and detailed offering of the timeless legend, `Sleepy Hollow,' directed by Tim Burton.  In this dark and vividly imaginative, definitive version, Johnny Depp plays Crane, a New York City Police Constable at the end of the Eighteenth Century, who is dispatched northward by his superiors to the hamlet of Sleepy Hollow, to investigate the grisly murders of three of it's citizens.  Crane has been chosen, not because he is considered a man of vision for employing the latest scientific techniques in his investigations, but rather because his methods are looked upon askance by his colleagues, and they welcome the chance to be rid of him.  He is, they feel, something of an embarrassment to their community, and therefore better relegated to a small, out-of-the-way township of diminutive significance, whereupon his arrival he learns that the murders all share a common thread: In each case, the head has been severed from the body, and carried off.  And so, equipped with the latest and most sophisticated wherewithal science has to offer (many instruments of which are of his own design), Constable Crane begins his investigation. 	Working from a terrific screenplay by Kevin Yagher (adapted from the story by Washington Irving), Burton makes use of magnificent sets and the talents of an exemplary cast to bring his tale to life.  He creates an atmosphere of darkness and foreboding that permeates the drama and captures that same sense of menace and disquietude evoked by the classic horror films of the 혩30's and 혩40's, such as `Frankenstein,' `Dracula,' `The Wolf Man,' and the like, and infuses it with some rather graphic, yet stylishly presented and realistic decapitations and various other bloodlettings, all enhanced and delivered with cutting-edge special F/X.  All of which, for the fan of true gothic horror, becomes a bona fide cauldron of unspeakable delights.  It must be noted that none of this is presented in a fashion anywhere near to what could be considered a `gore-fest' by any stretch of the imagination; Burton maintains the gothic aspects of the story, visually and dramatically, and renders it all with a touch of real class.  Never does he sink to casting about for a gross visual, or attempt to manipulate a situation for the sake of some cheap thrills.  It's a matter of integrity-- artistic and otherwise-- and Burton has it; it also demonstrates that he has a respect for his audience, for which he is to be commended, as he works in an industry in which that attitude of consideration does not necessarily prevail. 	Depp gives an exceptional performance as Crane, affecting a style reminiscent of Colin Clive in the original `Frankenstein,' or Basil Rathbone in `Son Of Frankenstein,' which fits so nicely with all that Burton is attempting (successfully) to do with this film.  It signals that rare rapport between actor and director wherein a concurrent vision is realized, for all of these attributes of the classical actor that Depp brings to the character are exactly what Burton needed from his star to make the film work so well; the aspect it lends to the final product evinces the same difference as that between a fiddle and a Stradivarius.  In a similar vein, in a supporting role, Michael Gambon gives a performance as Baltus Van Tassel that is akin to that of Depp's in adding to the overall ambience of the film, as does Richard Griffiths as Magistrate Samuel Philipse. 	The leading ladies also answer Burton's exacting call, especially Christina Ricci as Katrina Anne Van Tassel, and Miranda Richardson, who casts a spell as Lady Van Tassel.  Rounding out the supporting cast are Lisa Marie (Lady Crane), Casper Van Dien (Brom Van Brunt), Jeffrey Jones (Reverend Steenwyck), Ian McDiarmid (Dr. Lancaster), Michael Gough (Notary Hardenbrook), Mark Pickering (Young Masbath) and, especially menacing in a pivotal role, Christopher Walken as the Hessian Horseman.  As he did before with such films as `Edward Scissorhands' and `The Nightmare Before Christmas,' Tim Burton, with `Sleepy Hollow,' has given us yet another entertaining and exciting film that veritably carves out a singular niche for itself in the genre of the unique.  It's a quality film that deserves a special place in every DVD or video collection.  Truly one to be appreciated and savored.  I rate this one 9/10.",9,0,1,5 January 2001
We Were Soldiers," A Sobering Meditation On War
","The title of the memoir that inspired this film, `We Were Soldiers Once...And Young,' written by Lt. General Harold G. Moore and Joseph L. Galloway, says much about what this film ultimately conveys, as in a few words it addresses the state of being of the individuals, as well as the country, which so soon would be embroiled in one of the most controversial wars in the history of America.  `We Were Soldiers,' adapted for the screen and directed by Randall Wallace, is an uncompromising look at war and the commitment of those who wage it.  It's a true story told realistically, and moreover, in terms that are humanistic rather than political, which succeeds in making it a riveting drama that is both absorbing and emotionally involving.	It's November, 1965; some 400 American troops-- the 7th Cavalry-- led by Colonel Hal Moore (Mel Gibson), take the field at LZ X-Ray in the Ia Drang Valley in Vietnam, where they are quickly surrounded by over 2000 North Vietnamese soldiers.    The ensuing battle will last for three days, and it marks the first major confrontation between America and North Vietnam, a battle from which many, on both sides, will not walk away; and on hand to record it as it happens, is reporter Joe Galloway (Barry Pepper).  Going in, Moore knows what they are up against, and he promises his men two things: That he will be the first to set foot on the field and the last to leave it; and he will bring every man back home with him, alive or dead-- no one will be left behind.  And it's a promise he keeps.  	With this film, Wallace succeeds where two other, recent depictions of historic battles, `Pearl Harbor' and `Black Hawk Down'-- both good films in their own right-- failed; and it's because he managed to achieve just the right balance between the rendering of the battle itself and the human element involved.  Of the two, `Pearl Harbor' is a close runner-up; the love story leading up to the battle was perhaps a bit extended, though ultimately engaging, whereas `Black Hawk Down' put the viewer in the battle, but was emotionally uninvolving.  Here, Wallace not only gives you a battle that is brilliantly staged and presented, but before he takes you there he makes sure you know those who are about to die, and the loved ones they are leaving behind.  War has many casualties, and they are not all on the battlefield; and beyond the realism of the fight, this is where Wallace makes his strongest statement, as during the three days of the battle he makes you privy to what the soldiers wives and families are going through at home, as well, waiting for the dreaded Western Union telegrams being delivered by cab drivers because the army wasn't prepared to deal with it. 
	The film is effective because Wallace keeps the human element at the heart of the story while he presents a perspective to which the audience can relate on very personal terms.  In short, he gives you the `whole story,' that enables you to know the horror of the firefight, as well as the throat clenching terror of seeing a yellow cab drive up to the front of your house, knowing full well what it means.  This is a prime example of filmmaking and storytelling at it's best; and it's a commendable achievement by Wallace.	Gibson is perfectly cast and does an excellent job of bringing Hal Moore to life with a convincing portrayal of a man dedicated to both his family and his life as a soldier.  Moore is focused and determined, and Gibson makes us realize that he knows the seriousness of what he is about to undertake, as well as the possible dire consequences thereof.  The real strength of the character, however, is in the fact that he is not some kind of superhero out to win the war single-handedly, but a man who lives and loves and feels like anyone else, who bleeds when he is cut and hurts when he loses one of his men.  A man who feels guilty that he is still living when his men die.  And it's all captured in Gibson's strong and credible performance.	Besides Gibson, there are a number of exceptional supporting performances in this film, most notably, Madeleine Stowe, as Julie Moore, Hal's wife; Sam Elliott, as the gruff and seasoned veteran, Sergeant Major Basil Plumley; Greg Kinnear, as Major Bruce Crandall, the helicopter pilot with a memorable nickname; Chris Klein, as Lieutenant Jack Geoghegan, a new father to whom Moore gives a perspective on the war that enables him to face the job he must do; Keri Russell, as Barbara Geoghegan, the young wife and new mother who must watch her husband go off to fulfill his destiny; and Pepper, turning in an extremely affecting performance as Joe Galloway.	The supporting cast includes Ryan Hurst (Sergeant Savage), Mark McCracken (Ed `Too Tall' Freeman), Edwin Morrow (Willie), Jsu Garcia (Captain Nadal), Matt Mangum (Private Soprano), Brian Tee (Nakayama), Joseph Hieu (NVA Major), Don Duong (Ahn), Alan Dale (Westmoreland) and Simbi Khali (Alma).  A film like this goes far in demonstrating the power and effectiveness of the medium that created it; it will never, however, enable us to understand war, because war-- in all it's myriad manifestations-- is beyond human comprehension.  But it has always been with us and always will be, and a film that is well made and presented, a film like `We Were Soldiers,' is important because it lends a needed perspective that allows us to take a step back and consider the magnitude of our endeavors in these regards, and the price we must pay for freedom.  It leaves one with a sense of pride and patriotism, but tempered with a sobering concern for seeking altruistic alternatives.  It may be only a dream; but hopefully, it's one that someday all the people of the world will share.  9/10.",9,1,2,12 March 2002
Blade II," Solid Horror Film
","Wesley Snipes is back in the role of the title character, in this offering that leans decidedly more toward the Wes Craven horror/action side of the genre than to Anne Rice gothic, and be advised that there is enough blood-letting and gore on hand to appease even the most insatiable viewer, in `Blade II,' directed by Guillermo del Toro.  	Half human, half vampire, Blade has all of the powers of the vampire, but none of the weaknesses; he is called `Daywalker' by his sworn enemies, the vampires he has vowed to destroy, because of his ability to move about unimpaired in the light of day.  And, knowing his mission, the vampires have formed and trained a special unit, the `Bloodpack,' whose sole purpose is to hunt Blade down and eliminate him, before he can get to them. 
	But the story begins with an unusual twist:  Instead of hunting Blade down to kill him, the vampire `Shadow Council' reaches out to him with the offer of an alliance; in fact, they want him to lead the Bloodpack against a new enemy, one who threatens to wipe out the living and the undead alike, if allowed to proliferate.  They are mutant vampires known as `Reapers,' a new breed with a thirst for blood that is unquenchable.  Initially, Blade demurs, until the vampires provide him with proof of what the Reapers can do.  	Before he will begin, however, Blade first secures the aid of an ally and weapons expert named Scud (Norman Reedus), then insists on tracking down his old friend Whistler (Kris Kristoffererson), whom he has not seen for some time, and fears has been `turned' by the vampires.  And when that is accomplished, and once the entire team is in place, Blade and the Bloodpack begin their nocturnal hunt for the Reapers.	Del Toro has crafted and delivered a movie that is pure action and entertainment, geared to those whose appetites run especially toward the blunt, hard-edged and graphic.  And once it begins, the blood flows freely (including a vat of the stuff); rest assured, all who enter here will have their thirsts quenched.  Del Toro presents the story itself in a fairly straightforward manner, offers a couple of twists and has enough threads going to successfully hold it all together within the framework of the action.  Most importantly, he provides the kind of thrills that get the blood pumping and the adrenaline flowing, and the F/X are first rate (get ready for a rush when one of the Reapers opens his mouth and zeros in on the throat of a victim).	For a film like this to work, it is dependent on the ability of the audience to suspend disbelief and be able to immerse themselves in the story, and to do that, the protagonist must at least be a credible character.  And that's what Wesley Snipes gives you as Blade.  He's got the moves and the look, and he makes it convincing to a degree that enables you to go with the flow without having to think too much about the whys and the wherefores of it all.  This is pure escapist fare, and Snipes provides exactly the kind of character it needs to be successful. 
	The supporting cast includes Ron Perlman (Rienhardt), Luke Goss (Nomak), Leonor Varela (Nyssa), Matt Schulze (Chupa), Danny John-Jules (Asad), Donnie Yen (Snowman), Daz Crawford (Lighthammer), Rey-Phillip Santos (Red Eye/Reaper), Thomas Kretschmann (Pox) Tony Curran (Priest), Pete Lee-Wilson (Blood Bank Doctor) and Marit Velle Kile (Verlaine).  In the end, what you see is what you get, and what you get is very likely to be exactly what you expected from `Blade II,' which is plenty of blood-drenched action wrapped around a story soaked with intrigue, betrayal and things that go bump (in a BIG way) in that long, eternal night of the undead.  It's the magic of the movies.  I rate this one 7/10.",7,0,1,5 April 2002
Full Metal Jacket," Kubrick Addresses The Complexities Of War
","The dual nature of man, wherein he is able to embrace both war and peace simultaneously, is addressed by director Stanley Kubrick in the decidedly anti-war film, `Full Metal Jacket,' starring Matthew Modine.  Divided essentially into two parts, the first half follows raw recruits through basic training at Parris Island, where the effects of what it takes to turn a man into a Marine / killing machine is explored, predominately through the characters of Private `Joker,' played by Matthew Modine, and Private Leonard Lawrence (Vincent D'Onofrio), dubbed `Gomer Pyle' by the D.I, Sergeant Hartman (Lee Ermey).  It's a hard, stoic study of techniques and motivation that inherently questions the system itself, and is deftly and succinctly illustrated by the results achieved, which are not entirely those desired. It's hard stuff to swallow at times, but engrossing, and Kubrick manages to gradually build the emotional intensity that gives such impact to the climax of this first part, which is without question the strength of the entire film. 	The second half switches suddenly to Vietnam, where Kubrick takes up his pallet and canvass, and while attempting to paint a realistic portrait of war, instead takes more of a turn away from reality, and the film takes on a sense of the surreal; the result is more reminiscent of the visual artistry of `The Thin Red Line' than of the truly gritty realism of `Saving Private Ryan,' and rather than make his statement  directly through the use of the story, he uses the movie to stage sequences of events to demonstrate the contradictory nature of war and it's consequences, and man's involvement therein.  And while he compares the moral and emotional conflicts with the physical, it is an acknowledgement of an inner struggle devoid of any proffered solution, though delivered quite subjectively.  The pace of the film is very deliberate and much of the dialogue has a `staged' sense about it that, rather than underscore the issues being addressed, has more of an alienating effect which serves to neutralize the emotional aspects of what is being presented. 	The story is told from the point of view of Modine's `Joker' , but though Modine does a passable job, his is a rather unsympathetic character whose purpose it would seem is merely to act as narrator and to serve as the `eyes' of the camera.  And, again, it only manages to distance the audience further, as Joker becomes a kind of buffer between the viewer and any sustained level of emotional involvement with the story or any of the characters.  Instead of a stirring fulmination against the lunacy of war and man's enablement of it, Kubrick's approach creates more of a sense of rather cold ambiguity.  Had Joker (as the lead) been a stronger character, and had the second half of the film been more like the first, instead of nothing more than a series of vignettes, this could have been a dynamic movie; as it is, because of Kubrick's choices, he made a good movie, but not a great one. 	There are two memorable performances here, one by Vincent D'Onofrio, who did an exemplary job of creating the hapless Leonard; the other by Lee Ermey, as the Gunnery Sergeant who could be the poster-boy for an anti-enlistment campaign.  Also worthy of note is the work of Arliss Howard, who brought `Cowboy' so credibly to life.  Rounding out the supporting cast are Adam Baldwin (Animal Mother); Dorian Harewood (Eightball); Kevyn Major Howard (Rafterman); Ed O'Ross (Lieutenant Tinoshky); and John Terry (Lieutenant Lockhart).  With `Full Metal Jacket,' Stanley Kubrick raises issues that are important, and makes some valid points about the causes and complexities of war, and the moral and ethical challenges of those presented with it.  Obviously, this was a passionate endeavor; if only he would have allowed more of that passion to make it's way onto the screen.  What a movie this could have been.

Glory," Powerful and Historically Accurate Film
","Even as the Civil War was being fought, it was history in the making, and one of it's many chapters involved a stretch of beach on a peninsula in Charleston Harbor, South Carolina, where in July of 1863, the Confederates had ensconced themselves in the strategically prominent Fort Wagner.  And the Federal command had determined that it must be taken at all costs.  But it would be a veritable suicide mission for the regiment that served as the vanguard of the assault; therefore, volunteers were called upon, rather than being chosen arbitrarily by the General in command.  At this point, a young Colonel from Boston, Robert Gould Shaw, stepped forward to offer his regiment, the 54th Massachusetts Infantry, the first unit comprised of black soldiers in the history of the U.S. Army, for the job.  `Glory,' directed by Edward Zwick, is their story.	Soon after President Lincoln issued the Emancipation Proclamation, the Army was opened up to blacks; and the first to respond were those who ultimately made up the 54th.  Shaw, an abolitionist, was approached about taking command, and he accepted, putting his beliefs on the line and determining to make real soldiers of these men.  And he did.  In the beginning, however, he had no idea of the formidable task awaiting them in the not too distant future, when they would face an enemy bastion that was heavily fortified, well manned and which maintained a decidedly advantageous position geographically.  But leading up to that, Shaw had his men trained properly and stood by them as they formed the bonds amongst themselves that ultimately saw them through the battles they had to fight, on the field and off.  It was rough going; but under Shaw's command, they were able to secure something they had never had in their lives-- dignity as human beings.	Going into this project, director Zwick was adamant about adhering to historical accuracy in all areas of the story, from the events themselves, to the smallest, seemingly insignificant details they would put on the screen.  And he succeeded.  When the soldiers of the 54th, for example, are informed that their pay would be ten dollars a month, minus three dollars for clothing expenses-- seven real dollars pay-- instead of the thirteen they had been promised (which was the pay the white soldiers received), Shaw and his officers, in a show of solidarity, tear up their own pay envelopes and refuse to accept their wages until their men get their full pay.  The battles, as well, from Antietam to Fort Wagner, are authentically represented.  The assault on Fort Wagner, especially, seems like an almost romantic notion of gallantry, but the fact that if happened just as depicted here makes it all the more involving.  Zwick painstakingly recreated every aspect of the battle, and sets it up geographically and in such a way that the viewer is able to anticipate, without getting lost as the action unfolds.  The outcome of the battle is, of course, a matter of historic record, and especially for those well versed in the history of the Civil War, this film should be an entirely satisfying experience.	Matthew Broderick gives an engaging, understated performance as Shaw that captures the essence of the man, whom we get to know initially through his own words, from the letters he wrote home during his time in the Army (which are now kept in the Houghton Library at Harvard University).  The film begins, in fact, with one of Shaw's letters being read over the action. Throughout the film, Zwick uses this method to move the story along, as well as to give some real insight into Shaw, and through his thoughts, the men of the 54th and the events in which they are engaged.  And Broderick seems to embody the man you picture as being the author of the words being read.  He portrays Shaw, not as a cinematic, John Wayne type superhero, but heroic in a very real sense; as he leads his men against Fort Wagner, you see a man obviously afraid, but determined to uphold his principles and ideals, for which he is willing to die.  It's not a flashy role, but Broderick, by creating a character to whom virtually everyone will be able to relate and sympathize, is clearly the strength and the star of the film. 
	There are a number of outstanding performances in supporting roles, also, particularly Denzel Washington, who received the Oscar for Best Supporting Actor for his portrayal of Trip, the embittered former slave who is at war, not only with the Confederates, but with life.  Trip is a complex character, and Washington gets to his soul, awakening the bitterness as well as the somewhat caustic humor with which he wages his daily battles.  From the first scene in which he appears, Washington dominates the screen, even in the scenes in which Trip is not the center of attention.  It's a powerful performance, without question deserving of the Award.  Morgan Freeman gives a memorable performance, as well, as Sergeant Major John Rawlins, the elder statesmen of the 54th, who in his way sets an example for the younger soldiers, and eventually even Trip.  Also worthy of mention are Andre Braugher, as Thomas, and Jihmi Kennedy as Jupiter Sharts.	The supporting cast includes Cary Elwes (Major Forbes), John Finn (Mulcahy), Donovan Leitch (Morse), Bob Gunton (Harker), Cliff De Young (Montgomery) and Jay O. Sanders (General Strong).  Beginning with an accurate and insightful screenplay (by Kevin Jarre), Zwick uses all the tools at his disposal, including great cinematography (by Freddie Francis, who received the Oscar) and some memorable performances, to deliver an unforgettable and historically significant film.  Zwick is to be commended for the honesty of this film, and for maintaining the integrity of the story, which he never embellished simply for dramatic effect, which simply wasn't necessary; the drama that the 54th Massachusetts played out in real life was enough.  And that is what Zwick presents, in `Glory.'  I rate this one 10/10.",10,0,0,15 June 2001
Star Wars: Episode II - Attack of the Clones," A Triumph for Lucas, As the Saga Continues
","Since May of 1977, when the original `Star Wars' premiered, George Lucas has been assembling the biggest cinematic jigsaw puzzle ever to hit the realm of fantasy and science fiction; a monumental undertaking that has forever altered the celluloid landscapes of the universe while propelling the art of filmmaking ahead at light speed.  His epic saga is the ultimate tale of Good against Evil-- pure in every sense--  and with the fifth installment, `Star Wars:  Episode II, Attack of the Clones,' Lucas carefully inserts more of the integral pieces into that puzzle, leading us ever closer to the full and complete picture that will be revealed in Episode III, the sixth and final chapter that will at last bring the story full circle.	It has been ten years since the events depicted in `Star Wars:  Episode I, The Phantom Menace' unfolded, and the ramifications of galactic politics has brought the galaxy to the brink of war; the life of Padme Amidala (Natalie Portman)-- now a member of the Senate-- has been threatened, and Jedi Knight Obi-Wan Kenobi (Ewan McGregor) and his young apprentice, Anakin Skywalker (Hayden Christensen), have been called upon to protect her.  Not an easy task, however, as the dark side of the force has grown in strength, clouding the future to such an extent that not even Jedi Master Yoda (Frank Oz) can discern what may be in the offing.  Jedi Council Leader Mace Windu (Samuel L. Jackson) is concerned with the threat of the impending war and the possible outcome, for he realizes that the Jedi, though strong, are too few; they are the peace keepers of the galaxy, but there is simply not enough of them to fight a war.  But the one who is perhaps the most troubled of all is Anakin Skywalker, who in his zeal to cling to his autonomy is beginning to feel the pull of the dark side, that part of the force that will eventually seduce him, and to which he will ultimately dedicate himself.  And when it happens, it will drastically affect not only Anakin, but Obi-Wan, as well; and most especially, the young woman with whom Anakin has been in love since the first day they met, Padme Amidala.	George Lucas is a visionary filmmaker; he is to film what Jules Verne, H.G. Wells and J.R.R. Tolkien are to literature, with a touch of Aesop and The Brothers Grimm thrown in as well.  If you take a step back, pause and reflect upon what Lucas has done, it's awe-inspiring.  Not only did `Star Wars' spring from his fertile imagination, but he managed to translate it all vividly to the screen, with all of the myriad plot twists and turns, characters and intricacies, in a cohesive, accessible way that makes it riveting entertainment that has been embraced by audiences around the world and from one generation to the next.  And with `Episode II,' he does not merely give you more of the same-- the forte of most sequels, especially beyond a second installment-- but develops the story and characters with meticulous detail that takes you one step closer to that moment when all is revealed and the final link is established, tying it all together. 
	Beginning with the original, and right on through the (now) five films, Lucas demonstrates what a master craftsman he is, delivering an engrossing story that is visually astounding, as well.  And throughout the series, he maintains a continuity and consistency in the presentation; in the storyline, the way it is acted and the overall `look' of the finished product, and with a pace that it always perfectly attuned to the moment-- accelerated for the heart-pounding action sequences, more deliberate when needed, to effect the personal drama that lies at the core of the story.  In the final analysis, George Lucas is one of the few artists to whom the title `filmmaker,' in the absolute purest and truest sense, can be attributed.  He is a brilliant storyteller; a genius who has perfected and advanced his chosen medium perhaps more than anyone else before or since.  And, inexplicably-- like Chaplin and Welles during their respective lifetimes-- Lucas has never been truly or properly recognized for his many accomplishments; recognition that is deserved and overdue.  It's time to stand up and acknowledge him as the gifted artist he is.	In his second outing as Obi-Wan, Ewan McGregor continues to amaze. Creating the younger version of the character already established so indelibly by Alec Guinness-- and making him convincing-- had to be a tremendous challenge; and McGregor comes through with banners raised high. He does not merely imitate, but truly captures the essence of the character established by Guinness, almost as if channeling Guinness' spirit through his performance.  He has the mannerisms, the speech patterns, expressions and body language, all of which leads to a seamless transition from McGregor to Guinness in Episode IV.  And it's all done in a subtle, unassuming and quite natural way by McGregor, which makes his Obi-Wan believable and real. It's a studied, discriminating portrayal, and a real accomplishment for this talented young actor.	Another of the strengths of the film is the performance by Hayden Christensen as Anakin Skywalker.  Knowing that the engaging young Anakin will one day become the evil Darth Vader, it is pivotal that the actor playing the role at this stage of the character's development is able to capture and convey what it is in his personality-- and deeper, in his heart-- that allows him to be turned to the dark side.  And that is exactly what Christensen accomplishes with his portrayal.  Perfectly cast, he is believably the older version of the character created by Jake Lloyd in Episode I, and most importantly, he displays the dark, inner rumblings and angst that will ultimately be his undoing.  Finally, the chemistry between Christensen and Portman makes the inevitable romance viable, and `Attack of the Clones,' another triumph for George Lucas.  I rate this one 10/10.",10,0,2,19 May 2002
"Monsters, Inc."," Entertaining Fare for the Whole Family
","At one time or another, every kid in the world goes through the dread Monster-in-the-Closet experience; it's like one of Life's Rules.  And for those who remember the chills of the dark bedroom, the stark terror of the moment the light goes out and you're left all alone with the Thing of your imagination, at long last there are some concrete answers to allay the fears of PCCSS (Post Childhood Closet Stress Syndrome), thanks to the good folks at Pixar.  `Monsters, Inc.,' directed by Peter Docter, and featuring the talents of Billy Crystal and John Goodman, takes you behind the scenes of those haunted hours of childhood and explains the whole business.  Which happens to be the whole point:  It's a business.  At Monsters, Inc., it's the job of all the scariest creatures around to supply the power for the city, which is generated by the screams of the children found on the other side of closet doors.  The bigger the scream, the more power.  From one floor of the factory that is Monsters, Inc., closet doors are affixed, assembly line style, so that the best of the best (or maybe that's the worst of the worst) can step through (it takes them into a child's bedroom) and do their thing.  The screams are then collected in canisters and the city has power.  	The monsters earn points for the most scream power collected, and at the top of the list is James P. `Sulley' Sullivan (Goodman) a big, hairy, hulking monster who is assisted by the one-eyed (and it's a big one) Mike Wazowski (Crystal), a monster in his own right, though not of the scaring kind.  But Sulley has some competition; the number two scarer is Randall Boggs (Steve Buscemi), more sinister than Sulley, and not beyond stooping to some underhanded schemes to get to the top spot on the roster.  It's a tough racket, and Sulley and Mike have no idea just how low Randall is willing to go to get what he wants.  It's a plot, however, that ultimately has a far-reaching effect on the whole city, and it falls to Sulley and Mike to try and put things aright with their world.	Beginning with the premise, the story is clever and funny, and it's all brought to the screen with exemplary execution.  The Pixar process is simply amazing; the depth and dimension of the animation is brilliant and gives new definition to this genre as an art form.  Consider, for example, how very real the expressions and emotions of the characters are conveyed.  That, combined with the fact that the story moves along with an excellent pace and perfect timing, makes for a satisfying and enjoyable time at the movies. 
	Docter also assembled a top notch cast for his project.  In addition to Crystal, Goodman and Buscemi (who are terrific), the cast includes James Coburn (Henry J. Waternoose), Jennifer Tilly (Celia), Bonnie Hunt (Flint), Mary Gibbs (Boo), Bob Peterson (Roz), John Ratzenberger (Yeti), Frank Oz (Fungus), Steve Susskind (Floor Manager), Jeff Pidgeon (Bile), Daniel R. Gerson (Needleman & Smitty) and Sam `Penguin' Black (George).  Entertaining fare the whole family can enjoy, `Monsters, Inc.,' is a real experience for the little ones, and certainly presents something with which the adults in the audience will be able to identify, whether it be a memory from childhood or helping one's own child face the unknown of the Closet-in-the-Dark.  It's a movie that actually offers a little bit more than meets the eye, and it's a demonstration of something I've always said, that it's a kind of magic. And that's the magic of the movies.

Bridget Jones's Diary," Endearing, Funny Movie
","Dissatisfied at age 32 with the direction her life is taking, a young woman vows to make some changes, and to keep herself on track she decides to start a daily journal, hoping it will make her toe the line, in `Bridget Jones's Diary,' directed by Sharon Maguire and starring Renee Zellweger.  Bridget (Zellweger) begins with some New Year's resolutions that include no more drinking or smoking, not being paranoid about her weight, and developing poise.  And-- last, but not least-- to avoid any romantic attachments to alcoholics, workaholics, peeping Toms or perverts.  Of course she promptly falls for the one man she knows who embodies all of those characteristics: Her boss, Daniel Cleaver (Hugh Grant).  In the meantime, her mother, Pam (Gemma Jones), continues to play matchmaker for her daughter.  At a holiday gathering of friends and family, Pam nudges her in the direction of an old childhood chum, Mark Darcy (Colin Firth), now a respectable attorney, and recently divorced.  Their initial meeting, however, proves to be a less than monumental event, further complicated by the fact that Cleaver was Darcy's Best Man at his wedding, and has some tales-out-of-school to tell about the subsequently ill fated marriage that puts Darcy in a rather bad light.  But Bridget could care less; she thinks Darcy is rude and a bore, and anyway, Daniel is her guy.  Work is good, her life is going well and-- as she is about to wake up and realize-- she hasn't kept a single one of her resolutions.  And, oh! she should have.	First time director Maguire proves with this auspicious debut that she certainly knows her territory and how to negotiate it.  She has the touch and the eye for detail of a seasoned professional, and her sense of timing is impeccable.  She successfully avoids a major pitfall that do in many rookie directors right out of the chute, by never fishing for the cheap, forced, disdainfully pretentious or concocted laugh.  Everything in this film, especially the humor, flows freely and naturally from the circumstances of the characters and the story, which makes it all real and believable and allows it to be readily embraced by the audience.  This is a funny, often hilarious movie, but it's also very warm and at times poignant, and for handling it so sensibly, and with such sensitivity, Maguire deserves to be granted even more kudos.  It's quite simply an exceptionally well made film, presented with a style and grace that reflects that of the director herself.	Of course, having a superlative leading lady was certainly not disadvantageous to Maguire's efforts, either, and Renee Zellweger has never been better than she is here as Bridget.  With her quirky good looks, personality and charisma, she is endearing, and she invades Meryl Streep territory by affecting a perfect British accent.  Whether she's lip-syncing to a Celine Dion song, doing karaoke at an office party after having a bit too much to drink, or battling with a blender, it's easy to believe that someone would like her just the way she is.  Even with her hair mussed, or in a somewhat disheveled state, she's alluring, and it all has to do with who she is deep down inside; Zellweger makes it clear that this is a woman of substance, and it's easy to like her.  There's a down-to-earth honesty and accessibility about her that makes her appealing, and she's someone to whom many in the audience are easily going to be able to relate.  For her portrayal of Betty in `Nurse Betty,' Zellweger received a Golden Globe; `Bridget' should land her smack in the middle of Oscar territory.	As Bridget's smarmy boss, Daniel, Hugh Grant turns in a noteworthy performance, putting a rather tarnished sheen on his natural charm that works so well for this character.  It's a nice departure from his usual bumbling, reserved Mr. Nice Guy routine he perfected in such films as `Notting Hill,' and `Four Weddings and A Funeral.'  With this role he challenges Greg Kinnear's part in `Someone Like You' for the top spot in the Boss-You-Should-Never-Date category.  And Firth does a memorable turn as Darcy, fairly reprising his role of the same name in the PBS miniseries, `Pride and Prejudice,' from which this story is loosely derived.  Initially appearing a bit sullen, he gets the chance to develop his character as the story unfolds, and he does it quite nicely, ultimately revealing Darcy's true nature.	In a supporting role, Gemma Jones gives a performance that deserves mention, doing a good job of fleshing out Bridget's mother in the brief time she is allotted.  Rounding out the supporting cast are Crispin Bonham-Carter (Greg), Jim Broadbent (Colin Jones), James Callis (Tom), Sally Phillips (Shazzer), Honor Blackman (Penny), Embeth Davidtz (Natasha), Shirley Henderson (Jude) and Celia Imrie (Una).  A warmly humorous, uplifting film, `Bridget Jones's Diary' is a delightful and satisfying experience with more than a touch of magic in it.  Not only is it an entertaining showcase for Zellweger's many talents, but heralds the arrival of a director from whom we can expect great things in the future, Sharon Maguire.  A well crafted, reality based comedy/drama that is enjoyable and refreshingly devoid of inane nonsense or gross jokes is a rare find these days, and this is one of the best to hit the screen in a long, long time.  It's a film to be heartily embraced, and one I guarantee you'll want to see more than once.  I rate this one 10/10.",10,1,1,19 April 2001
Cast Away," Powerful Drama Courtesy Of Hanks And Zemeckis
","We live in a world in which the latest technology is taken for granted on a daily basis, and the `Fast Food Generation' is in charge; everything has to be done yesterday, and there's literally not enough hours in a day to do what `must' be done.  In `Cast Away,' directed by Robert Zemeckis, a man who has bought into all of the above suddenly finds himself plucked from it-- seemingly at random-- and given something new to ponder:  Life.  Life, in it's most basic and primitive form; where all he has for survival are his two hands, his wits, and whatever nature, in all her glory, can provide. Tom Hanks is Chuck Noland, a supervisor for Fed-Ex who lives and dies by the clock; a world traveler whose time at home and with loved ones is calculated to the minute.  On Christmas, he exchanges gifts with his intended, Kelly Frears (Helen Hunt), in the car before boarding yet another flight that will spirit him away to oversee the job in yet another city, another country. But this time, somewhere over the ocean, elemental forces take charge, his plane is forced to ditch in the sea, and Noland's life-- in a few seconds-- is changed forever.  He survives, only to be washed ashore on a small, uninhabited island in the middle of nowhere, where he must confront Time-- and himself-- as never before. 	Though comparisons to `Robinson Crusoe' may spring to mind immediately, tuck them away in some back pocket of your memory, because what Zemeckis and Hanks give you here is anything but that.  You learn enough about Noland and Kelly during the time leading up to the ill-fated flight, that by the time Noland lands on the island you know who this man is, what makes him tick, and also about the life and the love he leaves behind and what it will mean to them both.  And knowing what you do, his time on the island becomes more than just a handbook for survival; it's an intimate portrait of a man coming to terms with himself and learning the hard way-- with the core of his existence, the clock, negated-- what it is that really matters in life. Among the invaluable lessons he learns is that, indeed, no man is an island; for he sorely lacks the one thing nature cannot provide:  Companionship. 	Hanks gives a tremendously subtle, yet powerful performance as Noland; if there is any doubt, consider the fact that he carries the film for more than an hour by himself without allowing the tension or the drama to lag. Zemeckis, of course, must be given credit for keeping it all on task, including what his star is doing, and together they make it riveting drama that keeps the viewer enthralled, not only by what is happening in the present, but by maintaining a sense of anticipation; that something is just around the corner, about to happen.  The real strength of the film is in the way it's presented, and the way Hanks so successfully connects with the audience to create the empathy that allows the viewer to know what it would feel like to be in his place; understanding that sudden regard for all the things that are taken for granted every day:  The simple creature comforts; a book of matches; water; having someone to share a laugh with.  And most importantly, knowing that alternating sense of hope and despair Noland must live with without respite.  A message so succinctly driven home and so well done that it leaves you with a real sense of awe.  The metaphor of a man at the crossroads of his life has been done many times before, but never like this; with a nod to Zemeckis and Hanks, there is a purity to their treatment of the aforementioned theme with this film that is unparalleled. 	The supporting cast includes Nick Searcy (Stan), Lari White (Bettina) and Geoffrey Blake (Maynard Graham), all of whom add so much to the success of this film.  But the performance that really ties it all together is given by the gifted Helen Hunt, who with a limited amount of screen time makes Kelly a heart-felt, memorable character.  It's an exceptional performance that is worthy of an Oscar nomination for Best Supporting Actress.  `Cast Away' is an engrossing film that-- make no mistake-- is about so much more than how a guy survives on a deserted island; it's about enlightenment, and taking stock of the things that matter before it's too late.  A wake-up call, one could say, for a generation mired in technology, and governed by Time.  I rate this one 9/10.",9,0,1,9 January 2001
Pitch Black," Nothing New, But Has It's Moments
","This film may not expand the Science Fiction Cinematic Universe as we know it, but there's a couple of twists and turns and enough atmosphere to make it a worthwhile addition to the genre.  `Pitch Black,' directed by David N. Twohy, involves a commercial space flight carrying forty passengers that crash lands on an unknown desert planet.  With three suns above them, there is plenty of daylight in which the survivors can negotiate their quest for survival, and finding water is their main concern.  As they begin to explore the wastelands for sustenance, they find evidence that others have been there, apparently some years before them:  A small ship and a couple of buildings; all of which appears to have been abruptly left behind.  Lead by pilot Carolyn Fry (Radha Mitchell), the small band of survivors have a couple of additional obstacles in their way, as well.  One is Riddick (Vin Diesel), a murderer who was being transported to a penal colony.  But he may not be their greatest danger; because there is someone-- or something-- else close by.  Very close.  An entity that in all probability is responsible for the disappearance of those who came before.  And, if that isn't enough, Fry ascertains that the three suns above them will be setting soon; their world is about to be plunged into absolute darkness.  Soon, they will have to deal with Riddick and the entity stalking them in the pitch black of an eternal night.	This concept is nothing new, and there's a sense of been there, done that, about it, but to Twohy's credit, what it lacks in originality he makes up for in presentation by building the suspense and maintaining the tension right up to the end.  The story was obviously influenced by a number of other films, predominately `Alien,' `Soldier' and even `Rocketship X-M' from 1950, but there is a unique characteristic about Riddick and a revelation at the end (that has to do with his true nature) that secures a separate entry in the annals of Sci-Fi lore for this film.  This one definitely has it's moments, enough to take it to a level that even such highly touted offerings as `Event Horizon' and `Alien 3' failed to achieve.  	The performances, too, are a cut above the usual for this kind of fare, and while no one in the cast is likely to win an award for their work here, they do a good job, individually and collectively.  Radha Mitchell has an affecting screen presence and creates a very real person in Fry, equal to, if not surpassing Sigourney Weaver's Ripley in `Alien.'  Diesel is effective, as well, especially in the menace he brings to Riddick, which is subtly honest and believable; the understated way he plays it gives added impact to the character and takes him beyond stereotype (though not quite up to Rutger Hauer's Roy in `Blade Runner').  With Riddick, what you see is basically what you get; there's not a lot of depth or complexity to him, but that's who this guy is, and Diesel plays it well.	Also turning in effective performances are Keith David as Imam, Lewis Fitz-Gerald as Paris Ogilvie, Rhiana Griffith as Jack and Claudia Black as Shazza.  As Johns, Cole Hauser is adequate, but he fails to give his character the definition his co-stars achieved with their respective roles.	Rounding out the cast are John Moore (Zeke), Simon Burke (Greg), Les Chantery (Suleiman), Sam Sari (Hassan) and Firass Dirani (Ali).  From the beginning, you know what you're in for with this one-- it's a survival story, and few of the characters, if any, are going to make it to the end. But as entertainment, `Pitch Black' does the job; it's thrilling enough that by the time it's over you feel like you got your five bucks worth.  You may not remember it next month, but while you're watching, it's a pretty good rush.  It's the magic of the movies.  I rate this one 7/10.",7,0,0,23 January 2002
North by Northwest," No Question, One of Hitchcock's Finest
","A case of mistaken identity leads to kidnapping and more, in the suspenseful `North by Northwest,' directed by Alfred Hitchcock and starring Cary Grant.  Advertising executive Roger Thornhill (Grant) has his lunch interrupted by two men who think he's someone else, a man named Kaplan, and as they escort him from the restaurant at gunpoint to a waiting car, it's only the beginning of an adventure that will take the hapless Thornhill from New York to Mount Rushmore, and introduce him to the kind of intrigue few people experience except in the movies.  And before he's through, Thornhill will have scaled the famous monument, played tag with a crop-dusting airplane and fallen in love with a beautiful woman.  It's a classic case of an ordinary person getting caught up in extraordinary events, and with Hitchcock behind it all, you know it's going to be a thrilling ride.  And it is.	With this film, Hitchcock proves once again that he is, indeed, the Master of Suspense.  With terrific foreshadowing, he has a way of tipping you off to what is about to happen, without letting you in on what's really behind the mystery.  It's part of that special touch he has that keeps it all exciting and moving along, while allowing the tension to build until the very end.  It's a precision balancing act-- keeping the story right on the wire while refusing to reveal any more than is necessary at any given point in time-- that few directors have managed to achieve so effectively. Hitchcock has an eye for detail, an innate sense of what works and knows just when to infuse some humor into his story; but a big part of his success is also that he knows how to exact the kind of performances he needs from his actors.	Grant, as expected, gives a first-rate performance as Thornhill, using his natural charm and style to great effect; It's understated, and entirely credible.  His reaction to being kidnapped is totally honest, as he affects an almost naive sense of well being even with a gun stuck in his ribs.  As you can imagine it would be in a real situation like that, he simply doesn't comprehend what's really happening.  And the transition from that point to when he fully realizes the danger he's in is extremely well handled and developed.  It's a good bit of acting by Grant, and directing by Hitchcock.	Also turning in notable performances are James Mason, suave and menacing as Phillip Vandamm, Thornhill's adversary, and Eva Marie Saint, as Eve Kendall, the woman Thornhill meets on a train and with whom he becomes quite taken, not only with her beauty, but by her candor, as well.	The great thing about Hitchcock is that he sets you up so beautifully and never fails to deliver.  He consistently gives you that sense that something is about to happen, and it always does.  When Thornhill is standing out in the middle of nowhere at a crossroads, surrounded by nothing but fields, and you see a crop-dusting plane making a pass in the distance, and then you see it again-- but Thornhill is paying it no attention whatsoever-- you know something is up.  And from that innocuous lead in, Hitchcock develops one of his most memorable scenes ever, brilliantly conceived and realized.  The same thing happens when Thornhill and Eve find themselves at the top of Mount Rushmore; you know they didn't wind up there by accident.	The supporting cast includes Jessie Royce Landis (Clara Thornhill), Leo G. Carroll (The Professor), Josephine Hutchinson (Mrs. Townsend), Philip Ober (Lester), Martin Landau (Leonard) and Edward Platt (Larrabee).  An exciting story, some engaging performances and the indelible images this film plants in your memory, all make `North by Northwest' one of Hitchcock's finest (and that's saying a lot).  Thoroughly entertaining, it's one to which you can return time and again and still be thrilled anew.  You can always rely on Hitchcock to give you a good show, and show you a good time; that's the magic of Hitchcock, and it's the magic of the movies.  I rate this one 10/10.",10,1,2,7 May 2001
Doctor Zhivago," Magnificent Film!
","Within the heart and mind of the true poet resides a grasp and perception of life and the human condition unequaled in it's purity by any other art form.  From Rimbaud to Frost to Jim Morrison, he will in a few words or lines create or recreate an experience, thereby enabling his audience to know that experience, as well, albeit vicariously.  The poet, of course, will choose the medium through which he will share his vision.  For director David Lean, that medium is the cinema; and with `Doctor Zhivago,' a film of sweeping and poetic grandeur, he reveals that within, he harbors the heart and soul of the poet.  Indisputably, this is the true nature of David Lean; and it is evident in every frame of this film from the beginning to end.	To borrow a line from the more recent `Moulin Rouge,' this is a story bout `love.'  A love story set against the backdrop of the Russian Revolution. Dr. Yuri Zhivago (Omar Sharif) is a general practitioner, but he is also a poet; through his vocation as a man of medicine, he tends to those in need in everyday real life.  But it is through his avocation as a poet that he expresses what he sees.  He marries Tonya (Geraldine Chaplin) and has children; but the War and revolution intervene, and it is during these tumultuous times that his life becomes inexorably intertwined with a government official, Komarovsky (Rod Steiger), a young revolutionary, Pasha (Tom Courtenay), his half-brother, Yevgraf (Alec Guinness), and finally, Lara (Julie Christie).  It's desperate times for Russians from all walks of life, and Zhivago does what he can to do what he can to keep the fragile threads of his life-- and of those around him-- intact.  But fate plays a hand, and in the end, even Zhivago must go where Destiny leads.	With `Zhivago,' David Lean has crafted and delivered a magnificent and monumental motion picture of epic proportions that at the same time is disarmingly intimate, rendered as a world within a world, with each a vital part of the other.  Lean blends actors, cinematography, story and music with his own compassionate perspective to create a true work of art; a work of true poetry.  In telling his story, he offers breathtaking visuals, like the awesome vistas of the snow-covered Urals, or a long shot of a wide open Russian plain with a solitary figure in the distance trudging through the snow, juxtaposed against the enormity of the landscape. 
	Often, however, what he doesn't show you, but suggests, is even more effective and emotionally stirring.  Consider the scene in which a complement of mounted dragoons, sabres drawn, ride down upon a crowd peacefully demonstrating in the city streets; Lean sets it up so that you understand what is about to happen, then trains his camera on Zhivago, watching from a balcony overlooking the street as the carnage unfolds below. And in Zhivago's eyes, in the expression on his face, in his reaction to what he is witnessing, there is more horror because of what Lean has established in your imagination-- and which significantly enhances the impact of it-- than anything the most graphic visual depiction could have produced.  Similarly, when the Czar and his whole family are shot, Lean does not take you there; instead, you learn of it and realize the impact of it through the reaction of Alexander Gromeko (Ralph Richardson), Tonya's father, and it places it into a context that makes it all the more effective.  This is filmmaking at it's best, and an example of what makes Lean's films so memorable.	Put a talented actor into the hands of a gifted director, and results of more than some distinction can be expected; and such is the case with Omar Sharif and David Lean.  In 1962, Sharif received a Best Supporting Actor nomination for his work in Lean's `Lawrence of Arabia,' and in `Zhivago,' Lean's next film, Sharif gives a sensitive, affecting performance for which he should have received a Best Actor nomination, but inexplicably, did not (It was Lee Marvin's year for `Cat Ballou').  Still, as Yuri Zhivago, he has never been better.  Sharif successfully manages to convey his deepest, internalized emotions, expressing them through the genuine compassion with which he imbues his character.  Lean allows his star the time he needs to share with his audience his appreciation of the beauty he perceives in the world around him, and it's in those pensive moments that we, in turn, perceive the inner beauty and poetic nature of the man.  You have but to look into Zhivago's eyes to know his sense of joy in all living things. It's a wonderful collaboration between actor and director that so vividly and poignantly brings this character to life.	1965 was a career year for Julie Christie; she received the Oscar for Best Actress for her work in `Darling,' yet in this film created an even more enduring and memorable character in Lara (aided in no small part by the hauntingly lovely `Lara's Theme,' by Maurice Jarre, which indelibly etched Christie/Lara in the consciousness of `Zhivago's vast, international audience).  Lara's beauty is obvious, yet of a kind that goes much deeper than what you see on the surface; her station in life has made her vulnerable to misuse, but at the same time has endowed her with a strength born of necessity.  And Zhivago sees in her a quality and a resourcefulness that fulfills his romantic notions of perfection, and with a beguiling screen presence and a performance to match, Christie makes those notions credible and believable.  	Guinness, Richardson and Courtenay are exceptional in their respective roles-- Lean without question knows how to get the best out of his actors-- and also turning in noteworthy performances are Siobhan McKenna (Anna), Rita Tushingham (The Girl) and Klaus Kinski, who is unforgettable as Kostoyed, manacled and designated for forced labor, yet the `Freest man on this train!'  One of Lean's greatest films.  10/10.",10,72,95,17 January 2002
American Beauty," Lays Waste To Hypocrisy
","Souls are bared and individual vulnerability is exposed in this film in which the dysfunctional family becomes the norm, and a man at last confronts the fact that his life is simply not as it should be, and determines to do something about it.  `American Beauty,' directed by Sam Mendes and starring Kevin Spacey and Annette Bening, rips the facade from a typical American family to reveal a not-so-typical family after all.  Or are they?  For who among us, living in this finely woven tapestry that is modern American life, can really define `typical?'  Or for that matter, `normal?'  In what is to be the final year of his life (though he doesn't know it), Lester Burnham (Spacey) finally acknowledges to himself that he is in a loveless marriage, has a dead end job, and has for some time (too long) been a mere observer, rather than a participant, in his own life.  His wife, Carolyn (Bening), a fledgling real estate broker, disdains him, and his teenaged daughter, Jane (Thora Birch), accords him nothing but disrespect.  He has a new neighbor, Colonel Frank Fitts (Chris Cooper), a U.S. Marine who is the virtual embodiment of the `Corps,' with a wife, Barbara (Allison Janney), he has disciplined into a trance-like state of existence, and a teenaged son, Ricky (Wes Bentley), who sees beauty in the least likely of places.	It's a stylized, thought provoking film in which Mendes lowers the mask and raises a mirror to reflect the true nature of a society too often willing to cast the first stone while refusing to first seek out the detritus in it's own eye.  Devoid of stereotypes, the characters herein represent a realistic and concise cross-section of individuals who form, not only the periphery, but the core of that very same society.  And though personal experience and frame of reference will go far in determining how accepting a viewer may be of this picture of urban misalignment Mendes presents, there is no denying the reality of the attitudes and situations represented here.  To deny this depiction as accurate would merely be a turning away from the truth.	Once again demonstrating that he is one of the finest actors around, Kevin Spacey deservedly won the Best Actor Oscar for his portrayal of Lester. It's a finely tuned expression of a middle-aged man, not just in crisis, but lost in soul wrenching turmoil.  Many may find it difficult to sympathize to any great extent with Spacey's Lester, but regardless, they (as well as those who are able to sympathize with him) will at least be able to identify with him.  For in Lester we find all of the variances and complexities that make up this journey we call life.  And Spacey captures it all, from Lester's apathy and ambiguity, to the emotional peaks and valleys of his epiphany, with a truly memorable performance.	Annette Bening, also, turns in one of her best performances, for which she was nominated for Best Actress.  She shines as Carolyn, a woman repressed and frustrated who hides her discontent with hyperactivity and denial, and puts on a mask of pretentiousness that is so animated at times that it's nerve-wracking to watch.  But it's a great piece of acting, through which she certainly brings her character to life.	Giving a performance that demands mention, as well, is Wes Bentley, who achieves an introspective depth with his character that establishes what a tremendous ability he has as an actor.  This is one young man from whom we can expect great things in the future.	The supporting cast includes Peter Gallagher (Buddy Kane), Mena Suvari (Angela), Scott Bakula (Jim), Sam Robards (`JB'), Barry Del Sherman (Brad) and Erin Cathryn Strubbe (Young Jane).  A cutting-edge character study, `American Beauty' is a probing and revealing contemporary fable that is uncompromisingly honest; probably too honest for some.  It's a film that refuses to allow the viewer to take an `ignorance is bliss' stance, and instead insists on a truth that lays waste to hypocrisy and self-righteousness.  For when you're forced to stare into a mirror, there is only one image you're going to see staring back; and whether or not you like what you see is going to be entirely up to you.  And therein lies the real impact of this film.  I rate this one 10/10.",10,0,0,9 April 2001
The Patriot," An Entertaining, Important Film
","A hero of the Fort Wilderness campaign, now a widower living in South Carolina, with seven children to raise on his own, is once again confronted with war, this time in 1776, in `The Patriot,' directed by Roland Emmerich, and starring Mel Gibson.  When his oldest son, Gabriel (Heath Ledger), joins the Continental Army and soon thereafter runs into trouble from which he cannot escape without his father's help, Benjamin Martin (Gibson) is drawn into a conflict he opposes and would rather stay out of.  Though patriotic, and while believing in the cause in principle, Benjamin is troubled by the prospect of leaving his children orphans if he goes off to war, and since Fort Wilderness he has had enough of war and killing.  Circumstances dictate otherwise, however, and Benjamin finds out that to save his family he has no other choice than to fight. Gibson gives a commanding, Oscar worthy performance here as Benjamin, deftly capturing the inner conflict of a man torn between principle and necessity.  He imbues him with the stoicism needed to shoulder responsibility, but also with the human touch required of fatherhood. Most importantly, Gibson makes it all credible; his Benjamin is real.  Jason Isaacs is also outstanding as Colonel Tavington; there's a depth to his performance that truly brings out the bitterness and evil that dwells at the core of the man.  Also notable is Leon Rippy, as John billings, a member of the militia.  There is nuance he brings to the character that makes him memorable.  The supporting cast includes Joely Richardson (Charlotte), Chris Cooper (Colonel Burwell), Tcheky Karyo (Jean) and Tom Wilkinson (Cornwallis). Emmerich has crafted an emotional, well-paced film that brings to life a time of which most of us know mainly through history lessons and books, and which has for too long been taken for granted by too many.  As with all wars that are behind us, they too soon become mere footnotes to our lives, as with each new generation the significance becomes that much more diluted, and therefore under appreciated.  So many of the people who lived through any particular war would just as soon forget about it as tell the tale. That's what makes such movies as `The Patriot,' `Saving Private Ryan,' `Schindler's List,' and `The Bridges At Toko-Ri' so important.  They keep alive infamous and heinous aggression that we, as a society, dare not forget, painful as it may be to many who actually fought in these conflicts. Historically, whether or not `The Patriot' is accurate in detail is not really important.  It is, after all, one man's story, a dramatization set against the backdrop of this particular conflict.  That it conveys a sense of time, place and importance is what matters, and that it does.  What is also important to remember, is that when a movie is as well made as this one, it not only entertains, but can educate as well; there is inspiration here that may well become the impetus that leads one to other sources for factual accounts of the Revolutionary War.  This is the importance of movies, and it's all a part of the magic of the cinema.  This is an emotionally charged, action packed, memorable film that is at once both intimate and of epic proportions.  It is artistically rendered, beautifully photographed, and well acted; I just don't think there's a whole lot more you can ask of a movie.  This is absolutely one that should not be missed.",9,1,3,3 July 2000
Being John Malkovich," Brilliant, Unique Film
","What does it feel like to be inside someone else's skin?  Some people find out in the highly imaginative `Being John Malkovich,' directed with style by Spike Jonze, and starring John Cusack, Cameron Diaz, Catherine Keener and John Malkovich.  When out of work puppeteer Craig Schwartz (Cusack) gets a job as a file clerk on the `7 1/2' floor of an office building, it's the beginning of a bizarre interlude that will ultimately take him, and a few others as well, into a realm beyond the known.  One day he discovers a small doorway hidden behind a filing cabinet; curious, he ventures into the dark beyond and is suddenly sucked into the mind of actor John Malkovich.  After fifteen minutes of seeing through Malkovich's eyes, and experiencing what the actor is experiencing, Craig is just as suddenly and inexplicably dropped into a ditch beside the New Jersey Turnpike.  Unable to contain himself, he confides what has happened to him to Maxine (Catherine Keener), a woman who also works on 7 1/2.  Immediately, she sees money in the prospect of having a portal into the mind of John Malkovich, and she convinces Craig that they should start a business:  `J.M. Inc.'  For two hundred dollars a pop, people can have the experience of a lifetime.Jonze has taken a unique screenplay that is clever, witty, humorous and totally engrossing, and turned it into one of the most ingenious films to come our way in a long, long time.  In fact, there's never been anything quite like it.  It is distinct and filled with nuance and subtle shades of humor, sometimes dark, sometimes hilarious, but riveting throughout.  And the performances are absolutely first rate all around.  Keener deservedly got the Oscar nod for Best Supporting Actress, but Cusack, Diaz and Bean are also exemplary here.  Cusack comes through with one of the best characters he's ever done; there's an edgy, quiet intelligence to Craig, a Bohemian at heart, with a wife, Lotte (Diaz), and an apartment full of pets (snakes, birds and a chimp).  He's reserved, generally takes things as they come, and exudes a certain boyish charm when he becomes smitten with Maxine.  Diaz, taking on a decidedly unglamorous role, is terrific as Lotte, the somewhat unremarkable pet shop clerk who comes alive after experiencing the `portal.' It's a great character part, and Diaz plays it for all it's worth, connecting with the audience while ably conveying Lotte's sense of confusion and repressed yearnings.  And Orson Bean nearly steals the show as Dr. Lester, Craig's boss, the hundred-and-five year old man with a secret that holds the key to the portal.  It's a memorable performance filled with nuance and subtle humor; the scene in which he interviews job-applicant Craig is classic.  Malkovich (as himself) is the icing on the cake; he plays it straight, with a finesse and distinction that makes the unbelievable somehow credible, while lending an easy, natural flow to the innate humor of the story.  The `Malkovich, Malkovich,' sequence, and his rendition of the puppet's dance are unforgettable scenes.The supporting cast includes Mary Kay Place (Floris), Charlie Sheen (Charlie), Carlos Jacott (Larry), Willie Garson (Guy in restaurant) and Byrne Piven (Captain Mertin).  Written by Charlie kaufman, `Being John Malkovich' is a movie that is an experience in itself.  And Jonze and his entire cast should be given a standing ovation for bringing this one to life, for making it breathe.  It's the kind of film you wait for to come along, but rarely does, and it demands to be seen more than once.  Like Lotte, once you've been through the portal, you have to do it again; once you've tasted the nectar, there's no turning back.   10/10.",10,84,127,4 July 2000
Spider-Man," Raimi Delivers the Goods
","It may be a story lifted from the pages of a comic book, but with some strong performances, a focused story and some great F/X, director Sam Raimi puts blood in the veins of one of the best superheroes ever to hit the big screen.  And let's face it, right now the world needs just such a character; someone who can right wrongs, stave off injustice, assuage fears and give people a sense of security in a world seemingly gone amuck at times, and thanks to the magic of the movies we have him now.  His name is `Spider-Man.'Peter Parker (Tobey Maguire) is a normal, if not typical teenager; mature beyond his years, he would rather attend a science fair than go to a rave, he lives with his aunt and uncle (Rosemary Harris, Cliff Robertson) and has been in love with Mary Jane Watson (Kirsten Dunst), the girl who lives next door, since about the first grade.  `MJ,' however, doesn't even know he exists; except for an occasional `hello,' they barely know one another. But though Peter doesn't know it, all of that-- Peter's life-- is about to undergo a radical change.On a field trip to a science lab, Peter is bitten by a spider-- not just any spider, but one that's been genetically altered.  And when he wakes up the next morning, he finds himself changed; it's not exactly Kafka's Metamorphosis, but he does have new life and new energy, and beginning with his vision (he suddenly can see clearly without his glasses), he gradually discovers that he has certain physical abilities that do not necessarily coincide with the kind of changes consistent with a young man of his age. Like being able to spin webs from his wrists and climb up the side of buildings.  And now all he has to do is learn how to control and use his newly found prowess, and decide what to do with it all.  Which he does very quickly, when circumstances provide him with a motive and a personal agenda that leads him to become, as Peter himself puts it, `Your friendly neighborhood Spider-Man.'With this film, Raimi takes a page out of the Tim Burton Book and gives us a character that is convincing and real, because he shows us the man first, and then the superhero.  Like Burton did in the original `Batman,' in which Michael Keaton played to the man, rather than to the `bat,' Raimi takes Maguire down the same path, having him play to Peter, rather than the `spider.'  And it makes all the difference in the world.  Instead of merely thrusting a full-blown superhero onto the screen, Raimi first develops a plausible storyline (screenplay by David Koepp) complete with a central character to whom the audience can relate, and once that is established it enables the audience to suspend disbelief and go with the flow when Peter emerges as Spider-Man.  The F/X are incredible, and Raimi uses the stunning visual aspect of the film to great effect, but it would all be for naught without the solid core of believable characters he puts into place and then uses as a foundation upon which to build the spectacular.  It's reality based, but imaginatively presented-- Raimi definitely knows what works and how to entertain and involve his audience, which he certainly does here. And this is arguably Raimi's best work yet.When it was announced that Tobey Maguire had landed the role of Spider-Man, you could almost hear the collective audible gasp of fans everywhere. Tobey Maguire?  Spider-Man?  !!!  But-- as it turns out-- it was inspired casting, as Maguire is perfect as everybody's favorite web-slinger.  In fact, hopefully he's been signed to a multi-picture deal, because now it is impossible to imagine anyone else in the role.  Without question, Maguire IS Spider-Man.  His appearance, the way he carries himself-- his entire countenance-- combined with his attitude and the subtle way he expresses himself, are all part and parcel of what brings Peter Parker and Spider-Man to life.  Maguire, as he has demonstrated previously in such films as `The Ice Storm' and `The Cider House Rules,' has a naturally pleasing and accessible personality that serves him so well in the characters he creates, and none more so than with his portrayal of Peter.  He has the talent and ability to aptly convey that `ordinary person under extraordinary circumstances' scenario and make it believable, which is exactly what was needed to make this film successful; and Maguire nails it with a performance that is introspective and affecting, and it makes the character-- as well as the film-- work.Willem Dafoe also contributes to the film's appeal with his portrayal of Norman Osborn, aka, the `Green Goblin.'  Not since the Joker sparred with Batman has the screen had such a memorable villain; and again, Dafoe first plays to the man-- to Osborn-- and then to the `Goblin,' which puts a real face on Evil and gives the character the depth that makes him more than just superficially `bad.'  Defoe goes that extra mile to make a Osborn real, and deserves credit for giving him real substance, rather than being satisfied with a one dimensional character that has nothing going on beneath the surface.  The Goblin is a complex character, and Dafoe plays him perfectly.Kirsten Dunst had something of a challenge with her role of Mary Jane, as the character is somewhat ambiguous; on one hand, she plays a pivotal role in motivating Spider-Man, while her own part in the grand scheme of things remains uncertain until the end.  And only then are we given a glimpse of the direction in which MJ may go, and it will be interesting to see how the character develops in the next installment, now that the groundwork has been ably laid by Dunst.  In the final analysis, `Spider-Man' is a winner that is going to attract a huge following; this is one film that definitely has legs.  10/10.",10,0,0,5 May 2002
Ocean's Eleven," Entertainment with A Capital 'E'
","Call it improbable, or even a highly imaginative flight of fancy; either/and/or, all of the above are correct.  But whatever you choose to call it, this is one of the sleekest and slickest caper movies you're ever likely to run across, and what you're really going to end up calling it is pure Entertainment (yes, with a capital `E').  Incomparable escapist fare, impeccably crafted and delivered by director Steven Soderbergh and a dynamite cast, `Ocean's Eleven' is a joy ride that gives you a chance to root for the bad guys and feel wickedly good while you're doing it. Because, after all, what's so bad about a bunch of regular guys ripping off a bazillionaire casino owner, who in the first place isn't such a great guy himself?  Remember, the key word here is `escapist'; don't worry about moralizing while you're watching this one, because a movie like this is made to let you to live vicariously for a couple of hours, so just sit back, relax and go with the flow.  Just remember:  These are professionals; don't try this at home.	When Danny Ocean (George Clooney) is released from prison, he doesn't waste any time.  Taking a rather indirect route after leaving the place he's called home for some time, he winds up in Las Vegas where he quite simply plans to rob three casinos owned by one Harry Benedict (Andy Garcia), an extremely meticulous businessman, who is also-- if his reputation serves correctly-- an extremely ruthless individual.  He's not a guy you want to mess with.  So why does Ocean want to pick on Benedict, who has the means and the muscle to crush him like a bug with a mere nod of his head?  Suffice to say it has something to do with a personal agenda, as well as the possibility of a paycheck worth around $160 million, which-- even after splitting with the ten other guys he's about to recruit for the job-- will land him a share that won't be too bad for a day's work.  And, of course, there's the challenge; Danny Ocean and his buddies are about to attempt the impossible.  What he is proposing is something that has never before been accomplished, a gamble with nearly insurmountable odds; but, hey, this is Vegas-- and that's what it's all about.	To be sure, Soderbergh had the deck stacked in his favor right out of the chute with the cast he assembled for this film; but like any self-respecting odds-makers in Vegas will tell you, nothing is a sure thing.  Soderbergh still had to mix all the ingredients just right-- cast, story, photography, music, action, humor-- to make it cook.  Well, he may not get the Oscar for Best Director for it, but if there's a Golden Chef's Hat Award, he's a shoo-in for preparing this feast.  This is a veritable smorgasbord for the senses; it's easy on the eyes, it'll give you some laughs and make you feel good, it's easy to digest and in the end is a totally satisfying experience. There may not be anything ground breaking about this movie, and certainly nothing especially new, but Soderbergh presents it with nuance and finesse, as well as that special artistic touch of his that is so definitive of his work.  Neither was a haystack anything new in Monet's day when he chose it as a subject for one of his paintings, and the rest is history.  It's how the artist renders the subject on canvas that's important, and it is in this that Soderbergh excels.  	As Danny Ocean, George Clooney demonstrates that he has the charm of Grant, the magnetism of a young Brando and the down-home agreeableness of Jimmy Stewart.  With his personality alone, he defines Ocean in no uncertain terms.  From the opening frame you know exactly who this guy is.  Still, there are a few surprises along the way that keeps him interesting.  Mostly though, he's just enjoyable to watch as he puts his plan into action, and it's easy to believe he's who he is and doing what he's doing.  And that's part of the charm of this movie and, moreover, goes to show you what a good performance Clooney actually gives here.  Unlikely as the story may be, he sells it in such a way that it works; and as the customer, you not only buy it, but walk away with the extended warranty and go home satisfied.  And that's a good bit of acting in anyone's book.	And though Clooney is clearly the star of the show, Brad Pitt checks in as Ocean's friend, Rusty Ryan, and emerges on fairly equal footing with his illustrious co-star.  Like Clooney, Pitt turns on the charm and serves up Rusty as a credible enough figure, with a performance that may not be much of a stretch for him, but one that is certainly engaging.  The character is lacking somewhat in depth and definition, but Pitt manages to give you a clear idea of who Rusty is without too much by way of development.  Call it a fast-food characterization; nevertheless, Pitt does a good job, and for all intents and purposes, he makes the character work. 
	The single question mark in the casting may be with Julia Roberts as Tess, Ocean's estranged wife.  She looks good and gives a solid, if not memorable performance, but she seems to miss the mark slightly in capturing the true essence of the character, which may have been better served by someone like Catherine Zeta-Jones or even Rene Russo.  But that's a purely subjective observation, and I'm sure there are those who will argue that Roberts was perfect for the role.  In either case, Tess is an integral part of the story, and Roberts neither enhances nor distracts from the overall proceedings; most importantly, she does make Tess believable.  And in the end, with a terrific supporting cast (too lengthy to mention here), `Ocean's Eleven' is one you don't want to miss.  9/10.",9,0,0,7 December 2001
Pearl Harbor," Michael Bay Revisits That Infamous Day
","Depicting history on the silver screen is no easy task; critics and historical purists wait in eager anticipation to pounce on a shading that's not quite right or a spent bullet casing that rolls left instead of right in the heat of a battle.  To even consider doing a dramatization of the infamous attack on Pearl Harbor, in this era of endless information and minutiae, is a bold act in itself, and the filmmakers deserve a nod of credit right out of the chute just for attempting it.  And, happily, they deserve still more credit, as `Pearl Harbor,' directed by Michael Bay, goes on to successfully capture the pain, pathos, angst, frustration and fear born of that day that `Will live in infamy.'	Told through the lives of two lifelong friends, Captain Rafe McCawley (Ben Affleck) and Captain Danny Walker (Josh Hartnett), this is a movie of epic proportions presented on a personal level, which enables the audience to connect with the story on an emotional level and not just as an observer of a reenacted historical event.  And when Nurse Lieutenant Evelyn Stewart (Kate Beckinsale) enters the story, it becomes even more involving, and as it builds in intimacy-- juxtaposed against these monumental events as they unfold-- it creates that empathy that really puts the viewer in the picture and gives that sense of total involvement.  This is nothing new to storytelling, of course; writers and movie makers have long understood that when dealing with events that are complex and larger than life, they have to be concentrated and presented from a personal perspective to effect a truly appreciable impact, and as James Cameron proved with `Titanic,' there's no better way to do it than with a love story.	Without that intimacy between the characters, which is what provides the audience with a frame of reference and a specific element with which the viewer can identify, the impact of all that eventually happens would be significantly diminished.  Like Cameron (and many others before him), Bay recognizes this, and the approach he takes is therefore very effective.  By the time the attack comes, you know and care about the people involved, and it gives the tragedy of that day a personal, rather than just a national or historic perspective.  And though all that follows is visually stunning, it's that personal focus-- that singular involvement that's been so carefully crafted-- that predominates the moment and makes all the difference as far as what you're feeling and experiencing as you watch these horrific and horrendous events play out.	Bay is also successful in evoking a true sense of time and place with this film, and he does it not only with authentic settings and visuals, but by giving the film itself a sense of cinematic sensibility that makes it more reminiscent of films like `Bombardier,' `Thirty Seconds Over Tokyo' and `The Bridges At Toko-Ri,' than the more recent `Saving Private Ryan' (though it does have `Ryan's' same level of realism).  It's easy, in fact, to envision this film had it been made fifty or so years ago, with a cast that would've included Dana Andrews, Van Johnson and Gene Tierney as the principals, with Randolph Scott, Pat O'Brien and Eddie Albert in supporting roles.	Heading up this cast, Affleck and Hartnett give strong, engaging performances, as does Kate Beckinsale, who successfully manages to take her character to a level beyond that of simply being the romantic interest of the story.  She makes Evelyn believable by responding honestly to the complexities of her character's situation, which in turn adds to the overall credibility of the fictionalized part of the story.  If there's an element in the story at all, in fact, that could be deemed questionable, it may be Rafe's reaction (some may argue, `over-reaction') to his personal situation; it is not, however, a reflection on Affleck's ability as an actor-- he gives a satisfying, credible performance-- but merely a subjective evaluation of his character's motivation.	Giving memorable performances in supporting roles are Ewen Bremner as Lieutenant Red Winkle, and James King as Nurse Betty.  Also Notable, are Alec Baldwin as Lieutenant colonel Jimmy Doolittle, Cuba Gooding Jr. as Petty Officer Dorie Miller, a Navy cook who rises to the occasion during the attack (though Gooding does bring a bit of melodrama to his portrayal), and especially Jon Voight, who is excellent in the role of President Franklin D. Roosevelt.  Tom Sizemore, however, as Sergeant Earl Sistern, falls into stereotype, and with the brim of his hat turned up comes across like an actor playing William Bendix playing a role in a war movie more than anything else.  In his defense, though, he does seem to do the best he can with the material he is given, and it is a fairly small part with little time for development.	The additional supporting cast includes William Lee Scott (Lieutenant Billy Thompson), Jennifer Garner (Nurse Sandra), Mako (Admiral Yamamoto), Colm Feore (Admiral Kimmel), Leland Orser (Major Jackson), Scott Wilson (General Marshall), Peter Firth (Bennion) and Sara Rue (Nurse Martha).  One more qualified than I will have to comment on the historical `accuracy' of the film, but without question, `Pearl Harbor' succeeds in conveying the magnitude, scope and significance of the attack, and does it in a way that is emotionally involving and memorable.  It depicts a moment in history that-- regardless of how dark and horrible-- must never be forgotten; and, even as Steven Spielberg's `Schindler's List' and `Saving Private Ryan' did much to preserve their respective moments in history, so will this film help to insure that December 7, 1941, will forever be remembered.

Die Hard 2," Willis Rides the Rocket
","There are days-- and everybody has them-- when no matter what you do things just don't go the way you planned, and by the end of the day you're thinking maybe you should've just kicked back and had that second cup of coffee.  And on a day like that, you can bet the odds are pretty good that even lightening can, in fact, strike the same person twice, which is exactly what happens in the action packed `Die Hard 2,' directed by Renny Harlin, and starring Bruce Willis as LAPD Detective John McClane.  It's Christmas time again, and McClane is at Dulles International Airport in Washington, D.C., awaiting the arrival of his wife, Holly (Bonnie Bedelia), whose plane is scheduled to land within a couple of hours.  It's snowing, the weather is chancy and the traffic in the air is heavy; still and all, things are good, and McClane is looking forward to spending the holidays with Holly and her parents.  What he doesn't know is that there are some people waiting in the wings to change all that-- and they are about to make life miserable for McClane and everyone within their proximity.	It just so happens that a deposed drug lord, General Ramon Esperanza (Franco Nero), is being extradited to the U.S. to stand trial for cocaine trafficking, and his plane is scheduled to touch down at Dulles shortly. but he doesn't intend to stay around long.  A small army of mercenaries-- all former U.S. Army commandos-- are in the process of being deployed in and around the airport, with the intention of doing what they do best:  Making war and creating havoc, and effecting the escape of the man to whom they have sworn allegiance, General Esperanza.  Under the command of the fanatic and psychotic Colonel Stuart (William Sadler), the mercenaries are ruthless, their tactics are brutal and they are determined to carry out their mission successfully at all costs.  Toward that end they've planned a precision military operation right down to the smallest detail.  But their plans failed to include the contingency of encountering a one-man wrecking crew, and they're about to meet him.  His name is John McClane.	With this sequel, director Harlin devised, crafted and delivered an action film that has exactly what an action film is supposed to have:  Action, and plenty of it.  And once it starts, it never lets up until the screen has gone dark, and it's one wild ride.  It has the added bonus, as well, of having a storyline to back it all up, all of which Harlin presents in a satisfying, cohesive package.  As with even the best offerings of the genre, however, this one requires a certain suspension of disbelief, but there's so much happening so quickly that it doesn't require much effort.  A couple of key scenes are built around things that could only be accomplished through the use of creative license, but it doesn't make any difference; it works for the story and Harlin integrates it so well into the action that it all seems real, and unless you're an expert in a certain field you wouldn't know the difference anyway.  The important thing is, it's exciting and entertaining.	One element that puts this film a cut above many action movies is the fact that the characters have at least been developed beyond being mere comic book caricatures; these are people with whom you are able to become emotionally involved because they have very real concerns, feelings and relationships.  They just happen to be confronted at this juncture of their lives by extraordinary circumstances.  The relationship between McClane and Holly, for example, adds that element of humanity that makes the film more than `just' a special effects extravaganza.  Willis does a good job of bringing McClane to life with a credible, believable performance, as does Bedelia as Holly.	The supporting cast includes a number of actors who were virtually unknown at the time, but who have gone on to have significant careers in their own right, like Dennis Franz (Lorenzo), Vondie Curtis-Hall (Miller), Robert Patrick (O'Reilly) and John Leguizamo (Burke).  Also in the cast are William Atherton (Thornburg), Reginald VelJohnson (Powell), John Amos (Grant), Tom Bower (Marvin) and Sheila McCarthy (Samantha Coleman).  The role of John McClane catapulted Bruce Willis to international stardom, and reprising the character in `Die Hard 2' virtually crowned him King of the action genre. Harlin did a terrific job with this one, Sadler created a memorable villain with Colonel Stuart, and like your favorite ride at your favorite amusement park, it's thrilling-- and as soon as it's over, chances are you're going to want to go again.  And that's the magic of the movies.  I rate this one 9/10.",9,0,2,15 July 2001
Legends of the Fall," Engaging and Emotionally Involving Epic from Edward Zwick
","According to the ancient lore of Native Americans, there is a story within each of us; the story of a life often guided by some inner voice, which some hear with great clearness.  Some live by what they hear-- and such people become crazy.  They become legend.  And so it was destined to be for a young man named Tristan Ludlow, who was born toward the end of the Nineteenth Century and grew up in the wide open spaces of Montana, where his father, Colonel William Ludlow, had taken his family to escape the imperfections of a society ruled by a government he could no longer respect.  `Legends of the Fall,' directed by Edward Zwick, is the story of Tristan (Brad Pitt) and his brothers, Alfred (Aidan Quinn) and Samuel (Henry Thomas); a tragic story of the life they shared and the wounds they suffered, many of which were never to heal.  And it's their father's story, as well, for it was he who raised his boys with only the help of his loyal friend, One Stab (Gordon Tootoosis), after his wife, Isabel (Christina Pickles), unable to withstand the harsh Montana winters, had left her family for the more civilized East Coast, never to return.	Colonel Ludlow (Anthony Hopkins) had served his country during the Indian Wars, after which, disheartened by the government's treatment of those they had suppressed, the proud people of the Indian Nations, he turned his back on the `civilized' ways of his own people and carved out a niche for himself and his family in Montana.  And it was there, on their ranch, that the boys learned the ways of the West and the ways of the Indian, under the tutelage of their father and One Stab.  But of the three, only Tristan eventually heard that inner voice with such clarity that he could neither deny nor ignore it, and it awakened a passion within him that he embraced, and which set him upon the path he was seemingly destined to follow; a path that would ultimately affect the lives of everyone he had ever loved.	By 1914, Europe was at war, and the very tenets of truth and justice that had driven Colonel Ludlow away from society now compelled his sons to take a stand according to their own beliefs.  Despite his recent engagement, Samuel decides to go to Canada and enlist in the army in order to fight for England.  Alfred and Tristan refuse to let him go alone, and enlist with him.  And in the desolate, muddy trenches of France, they soon learn the harsh truth and the reality of war-- just as their father had before them-- and by the time the war has ended for them, their lives have changed forever; Tristan's most especially.  Back home, Tristan tries to settle down to life on the ranch, but the restlessness of his soul speaks to him of things he must do and places he must go, and the voices are too strong to resist.  So despite the ties that bind him to the home and the people he loves, he sets out on a journey of self-discovery that eventually takes him, physically and emotionally, into places he never knew existed-- and away from the woman who loves him the most.	Director Edward Zwick delivers a sweeping saga of life and love with this film that is every bit as big and grand as the country in which it is set. He presents his story through the recollections of One Stab, the one who saw it all unfold, first hand.  And it gives the film a narrative quality that is storytelling at it's best.  Zwick had a vision of how to bring this tale to the screen, and he realized it magnificently, aided by John Toll's breathtakingly beautiful cinematography (for which he received an Oscar), Lilly Kilvert's superb set designs and James Horner's compelling, dramatic score.  And most importantly, through the tremendous performances of Hopkins, Pitt, Quinn, Thomas and the lovely Julia Ormond. 
	Hopkins anchors the film with a brilliantly understated performance, creating a three-dimensional character who personifies the very iconoclastic ideals and principles he espouses.  And Pitt gives one of the best performances of his career as Tristan; watching him, you feel that restlessness and conflict raging within his soul, and you can sense his passion as he seeks his direction in life.  Quinn is also extremely effective as Alfred, the older brother, delivering an emotional and convincing performance, as does Julia Ormond, as Susannah, a young woman conflicted inside as she tries to sort out her feelings for the Ludlow brothers.  Zwick knew exactly what he needed from his actors to tell the story he wanted to tell, and he managed to get it all, from the principals to the least of the supporting players; and it's all there on the screen-- the passion, the intensity, the love and the care.  It's quite simply a beautiful piece of filmmaking by all concerned.	The supporting cast includes Karina Lombard (Isabel Two), Paul Desmond (Decker), Tantoo Cardinal (Pet) and Robert Wisden (John T. O'Banion).  A visually stunning film that will touch you emotionally and stay with you long after the screen has gone dark, `Legends of the Fall,' perpetuates the tradition of classics like `The Big Country' and `Giant.'  Engaging and memorable, it's a transporting experience, courtesy of the magic of the movies.  I rate this one 10/10.",10,23,40,20 June 2001
"Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon"," Transporting, Poetic Film
","The legends and myths surrounding the martial arts are extended and brought dazzlingly to fruition in `Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon,' a sumptuous production directed by Ang Lee.  When legendary warrior Li Mu Bai's (Chow Yun-Fat) meditations take him to a place beyond anything he's ever experienced, a place of darkness and sorrow, he decides to give up the life that has sustained him for so long.  As a prelude to his new life he gives his sword, `Green Destiny,' to long-time friend and patron, Sir Te (Lung Sihung).  But when the sword is stolen and aspersions are cast upon the house of Governor Yu (Li Fazeng), who (with his family and entourage) is a guest of Sir Te's, Li Mu Bai goes into action to reclaim his sword and elicit justice for the House of Yu.  To effect his goal he allies himself with the woman for whom he has long carried unrequited love in his heart, Shu Lien (Michelle Yeoh), who-- like Bai-- is a warrior.  At the same time, he reaffirms his vow to avenge the death of his master, who was killed by a renegade named Jade Fox (Cheng Pei-Pei), who remains at large. 	Ang Lee has created a visually stunning, lyrical, poetic film that is engaging on a number of levels:  The brilliant choreography  (by Woo-Ping Yuen), especially in the sword fighting scenes, is absolutely mesmerizing, as is the ability of the characters to defy gravity and literally soar up the sides of walls, across rooftops and into the tops of trees; there are sequences in this film that will literally take your breath away.  And then there's the story itself, which is nothing less than a meditation on life and the quest for that often elusive butterfly of inner peace and the resolution and acceptance of one's own destiny.  Blended seamlessly together by Lee, it becomes an artistic triumph of the silver screen that is truly magical; the sheer poetic nature of the film is unforgettable, the images of which will remain in your mind's eye forever. 	The charismatic Chow Yun-Fat is perfectly cast as Li Mu Bai; there is a subtle, introspective quality he brings to the character that is sublime in it's sensitivity-- that of a  man of strength and integrity, worthy of the legendary status accorded him as a warrior, and the respect bestowed upon him as a man of principle.  It's an honest portrayal that rings of truth, which Yun-Fat conveys so succinctly and credibly.  Michelle Yeoh is outstanding as well, exhibiting adroit physical abilities in the action sequences, while also demonstrating her gift as a dramatic actress.  Most importantly, she makes Shu Lien real, and there is a definite chemistry between her and Chow Yun-Fat that brings the story even more vividly to life.  But the most exciting discovery of the film is the young Zhang Ziyi, who is absolutely magnificent in the role of Jen Yu, the Governor's daughter.  It's an extraordinary performance, energetic and charming, and Ziyi has a screen presence that is riveting and commanding of attention. She has a tremendous physical dexterity, and her martial arts engagements with Yeoh and Yun-Fat are melodious and utterly captivating, as is her skill with a sword. 	The supporting cast includes Chang Chen (Lo), Gao Xian (Bo), Hai Yan (Madame Yu), Wang Deming (Tsai) and Li Li (May).  Through the combined efforts of Lee's direction, the exemplary performances of his actors and the expertise of a number of technicians, `Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon' is a film of ethereal magnitude that transports the audience to another time and another place.  Rarely has the screen been graced with with a film of such grace and beauty, and seeing it is a truly memorable experience.  One of the best movies of the year, it is not to missed.

Coyote Ugly," So Much More Than Expected
","A talented young woman from New Jersey, filled with hope and desire, moves to New York to chase her dreams of becoming a songwriter in `Coyote Ugly,' directed by David McNally and starring Piper Perabo.  Against the wishes of her father, Bill (John Goodman), but with his acquiescent approval, Violet (Perabo) begins her quest and soon learns what every aspiring newcomer to show business discovers:  It's tough out there.  Soon, in order to pay the rent and keep the dream alive, on a tip she seeks employment in a bar called Coyote Ugly; the owner, Lil (Maria Bello) lets her `audition (work one night)' to see if she can handle their kind of action.  It's a tough gig, but Violet knows she's going to have to make certain sacrifices if she's to succeed.  And that is really what this movie is all about:  Personal character, having the tenacity to maintain ideals and dignity, and deciding what and how much one must be willing to sacrifice to achieve one's goals; and most importantly, having enough heart to see it all through. 	Perabo gives a winning performance as Violet; she's fresh, somewhat naive (but not entirely), and the way she presents her character makes it easy to connect with her right away.  She becomes someone you care about quickly, and there are moments early on, especially when she first arrives in New York, that allow you to emphasize with her immediately.  There's a fragility about her, but at the same time she exhibits a strength of character and sense of morality that is becoming; and being able to convey this level of complexity convincingly is a tribute to her ability as an actress.  John Goodman also does a good job as her father, a caring bear of a man who obviously has nothing but the best intentions for his daughter at heart. His performance, and the way the situation of his having to let Violet go is handled makes it believable, and helps create an emotional bond between them and the audience.  It's something with which many will be able to identify, and it becomes one of the underlying strengths of the film. 	One of the weaknesses of this project comes, not from the movie itself, but from the `promotion' of the movie; in this case the theatrical trailer, which is a gross misrepresentation of what `Coyote Ugly' really is. Certainly the `coyotes' and the bar are a significant part of the film, and it's all exceptionally well and tastefully done, and is a fun part of the movie and definitely gives it some life; but I think the presentation in the trailer will do more to alienate a cross-section of audience that ultimately would appreciate this movie, but initially at least will not even see it, and only because of a misconception caused by the preview.  It must be noted that this is a PG-13; there is nary a profane word, and no sex or nudity in it.  It is an upbeat, entertaining film that should be readily embraced by a much wider audience than one would expect simply from seeing the trailer. The excellent supporting cast includes Adam Garcia (Kevin), Izabella Miko (Cammie), Melanie Lynskey (Gloria), Bridget Moynahan (Rachel), Tyra Banks (Zoe) and LeAnn Rimes (In a cameo as herself).  Hopefully, if only by word-of-mouth, this movie will gain the audience it deserves.  Reminiscent of `Flashdance,' there is a universal theme here of having a dream and going for it.  In the final analysis, `Coyote Ugly' is a decent film that will appeal to anyone who's ever had or pursued a dream.  Do yourself a favor, put any preconceived notions aside and check this one out; I think you'll be glad you did.  I rate this one 7/10.",7,1,2,16 September 2000
Moulin Rouge!," Mostly, It's a Story About Love
","This is a story about life.  And about the artists who congregated in Paris in 1900, living a bohemian lifestyle and giving the world the fruits of their labor, of their art, for which they would gladly bleed and die.  But mostly this is a story about love.  Of a young man named Christian, a penniless writer, and a singer named Satine, who for a moment came together and tasted the nectar of the gods.  `Moulin Rouge,' written and directed by Baz Luhrmann, takes you into a world that is bright and brilliant, fast and flashy and filled with all of the things that make life worth living.  It's a fantasy world of song and color, of soaring hearts and aspirations-- but also of the reality upon which the illusion of it all is built.  And the effects of that reality on Christian and Satine, whose love has been forbidden by that same reality they seek to dispel by impaling it with the artistic endeavors that give them life.If Disney had commissioned a film to be written by Shakespeare, directed by Fellini and produced by Spielberg, this would be it.  It's a dizzying, whirling burst of lights, colors, music, drama and comedy that assails the senses and will hold you spellbound from beginning to end.  Like the bohemians he portrays, Luhrmann leaves convention behind and dips instead into his own inspired and highly imaginative formula to tell his story. The cinematography (by Donald McAlpine) and art direction (by Ann-Marie Beauchamp and Ian Gracie) are brilliant, as well as the production design (by Catherine Martin) and the sets (by Brigitte Broch).  One of the many inspired touches Luhrmann employs here, is the use of different film speeds throughout, which, when combined with the superlative, quick-cut editing (by Jill Bilcock), makes it all transporting and surreal.
Ewan McGregor turns is a terrific performance as Christian, the young man who arrives in Paris with nothing more than spirit and a head filled with ideas and ideals.  When artistic differences leaves Zidler (Jim Broadbent), proprietor of the Moulin Rouge, without a writer for a new show, `Spectacular, Spectacular,' Christian steps in.  And so does McGregor, who shines in the part.  And the boy can sing!  He may not have the greatest voice in the world, but it's a good `stage voice,' and most importantly, he can sell a song, as evidenced by the scene in which he puts across Elton John's `Your Song.'  McGregor has a charismatic screen presence, and in this role he really gets a chance to demonstrate his versatility as an actor.As Satine, Nicole Kidman is saucy and sensuous, bringing her character vividly to life, this woman who makes her living by being every man's fantasy as she sings and sashays her way through this world of the Moulin Rouge.  In her heart, she longs to be a serious actress, and if this new show is a success, she just may get her chance.  But first, the show needs someone to finance the lavish production.  They may have one-- the Duke of Worcester (Richard Roxburgh), has expressed interest, but he has one condition.  If he pays for the show he wants something in return (besides a profit on his investment).  He wants Satine.  But so does Christian, who has nothing to offer the show but his talent, and nothing for Satine but his love.  Zidler, meanwhile, aware of the Duke's demands, urges Satine to turn her back on Christian, to `save him.'  And beyond and besides all that is happening, there is something else going on with Satine, something more personal, that ultimately will have an effect on the outcome of the dilemma for all concerned.The supporting cast includes John Leguizamo (Toulouse Lautrec), Kylie Minogue (The Green Fairy), Garry McDonald (Doctor), Jacek Koman (The Narcoleptic Argentinean), Matthew Whittet (Satie), Kerry Walker (Marie) and Laszlo Lukas (Conductor).  With an eye for detail and his imagination thrust into overdrive, Luhrmann has put together and delivered one of the brightest films to come along in quite awhile.  `Moulin Rouge' is an explosion of sights and sounds, a film laced with humor and visual largess that holds a poignant and dramatic story at it's heart.  Entertaining and thoroughly enjoyable, this is a memorable film and a satisfying movie-going experience. It's a story about love; a story told through the magic of the movies.

Men in Black II," The Further Adventures Of
","Tommy Lee Jones and Will Smith are back as (respectively) Agents `K' and `J,' to once again save the world and keep the universe in order, in `Men In Black II,' directed by Barry Sonnenfeld, a Sci-Fi/comedy/action film that confirms something we've all suspected for a long time-- that most of the people who work at the Post Office are really aliens in human form (and doesn't that go for the DMV, as well?).  And rest assured, it all comes with plenty of alien activity and is served up with a healthy dose of wry humor and `new hotness.'  In short, if you've seen the original and/or the trailers for this one, you end up getting exactly what you expect-- and you'll sleep better at night knowing that the Men in Black are out there keeping us safe.Agent K has been `retired' for some time, but recent alien activity involving a particularly ruthless alien by the name of Serleena (Lara Flynn Boyle) necessitates bringing K back into service, as it appears that Serleena is seeking something called the `Light of Zartha,' and if she succeeds in her quest it will spell disaster for the world.      And buried in K's memory is information vital to the MIB effort to thwart Serleena. So J is dispatched to bring K back and deneuralize him, so together they can attempt to stave off the evil Serleena and save the world.  It won't be easy, however, because Serleena is already a step ahead of them, and right out of the chute they encounter a couple of obstacles:  A young woman named Laura Vasquez (Rosario Dawson) needs their help and protection because of something she's seen; and to get K back into action, J has to engage the help of Jack Jeebs (Tony Shalhoub), who demurs, afraid of `losing' his head again with K around.  And that hurts.  J prevails, however, and soon K is back in the last suit he'll ever own-- again.Sonnenfeld relies heavily on the visual aspects of this one, which is wise in light of the fact that there is more by way of F/X available to him than story this time around.  And he uses it all to great effect; the bottom line is, this movie is about one thing-- entertainment.  And that's what you get. There's enough story to keep the audience involved, but it's nothing that's going to strain the brain cells.  It may seem contradictory, but the originality and imagination Sonnenfeld employs here is nothing new-- it's there, but it's really just an extension of all that was generated in the original `Men In Black.'  Still, it's used well, and Sonnenfeld keeps it all moving along at a brisk pace that keeps it fun and engaging.  What really sells it, though, are the performances-- especially those of Smith and Jones.Will Smith steps right back into his character with facility, and he has a natural charm and a charismatic screen presence that make him fun to watch. Smith draws heavily upon his own winning personality in bringing J to life, and he has the timing and a way of delivering his lines that make his character extremely personable.  And that's exactly what a movie like this needs.  This isn't a project that calls for any in-depth character analysis; still, Smith develops J enough to make him well rounded and credible-- and that's enough.  It works.  Most importantly, Smith holds his own with the F/X, and the lack of pretense in his performance is refreshing.As K, Tommy Lee Jones gives Smith the perfect straight-man to play off of, and right from the beginning he so perfectly captures that lethargic Postal Worker countenance, giving new definition to the word `droll.'  And while J be-bops around (or is that hip-hops?), you get the feeling that as soon as K is back, he's the guy in charge.  And leading up to K's deneuralization, Jones does a good job of affecting a believable sense of hesitancy, of maintaining `observation' mode until he gets to the bottom of whatever it is that's going on with this `J' character.  You can always depend on Jones to deliver, no matter what role he's playing, and he certainly does here. And the casting is inspired:  Smith and Jones make a great team on screen.Rip Torn is also perfect as MIB director Zed, the guy responsible for keeping tabs on all of this alien business.  His character is inherently stereotypical, but Torn at least adds a personal touch and plays him quite well, putting some real life into his portrayal.  It's a good performance inasmuch as Torn lends some zest and personality to a character that could have served little purpose other than that of being a vehicle by which to move the plot along.  And it demonstrates how much a great character actor like Rip Torn can bring to any film.Lara Flynn Boyle does a good job in the less-than-challenging role of Serleena, a character which affords her little opportunity to do more than look good and generate a sense of evil, both of which she succeeds in doing effectively.  The main thing is, she manages to establish who Serleena is, which is pivotal to the success of the film.The supporting cast includes Johnny Knoxville (Scrad/Charlie), Patrick Warburton (Agent T), Jack Kehler (Ben), David Cross (Newton) and Jeremy Howard (Bird Guy Postal Sorting Alien).  Like the man said, `There's nothing new under the sun,' which is certainly the case with `Men In Black II,' which in essence is a continuation of the original, a kind of `Further Adventures Of' the MIB.  But it's well done, fun and entertaining-- it's a kick just being able to spend some more time with these guys.  And if you're a fan of the original and you go into this one expecting more of the same, rather than hoping to be dazzled by something entirely new, it'll be a satisfying, worthwhile experience.  7/10.",7,1,2,26 July 2002
Event Horizon," Not Much On The 'Horizon'
","**Possible Spoilers**		In an era that has given us such films as `The Matrix' and `The Phantom Menace,' audiences have come to expect a lot, especially visually, and special effects are definitely one of the elements that separates the memorable from the forgettable.  In the case of `Event Horizon,' there are four key elements that separate it from total `B' movie status:  Fishburne, Neill, Quinlan and Richardson; the bottom line is, the story, and the movie itself, just doesn't live up to the star power involved with it.  The Event Horizon is a spacecraft launched in 2040 to explore the `boundaries' of the universe.  Somewhere just past Neptune, it disappears without a trace.  Seven years later, it shows up again, and a search and rescue ship is sent to check it out.  Captain Miller (Laurence Fishburne) leads the crew, which includes Peters (Kathleen Quinlan), Lt. Starck (Joely Richardson) and Cooper (Richard T. Jones).  Also aboard is Dr. William Weir (Sam Neill), who originally programmed the Event Horizon.  When they finally make contact with the phantom Horizon, they find that the crew is dead or missing, and the only clues they have are from the ships visual logs.  And the news isn't pleasant.  The ship apparently ventured into some other dimension, and returned with a life all it's own, including the ability to discern the vulnerability of whomever happens to be aboard at the time; and when Miller and his crew show up, the Horizon wastes no time in exploiting the fears or remorse of the individuals who have blundered into it's territory.  Soon they find themselves, along with the Horizon's crew, trapped in a virtual `Hell' with nowhere to go; it's like the sci-fi version of `Hotel California,' where you can check in, but you can never leave. 	The concept of the story is interesting, but the transfer from the written page to the screen falls a bit short.  Neither the story nor the characters are developed anywhere near well enough; we get what amounts to a mere glimpse into what makes Miller and Peters tick, and a little more (but still not nearly enough) into the background of Weir.  Throughout the film there are flashes of the Horizon's crew, trapped in this Hell they've entered, with plenty of blood and gore thrown at you very quickly, just enough to give you the idea of what's going on.  But after awhile, these flashes seem redundant and lose any significance they may have had to begin with.  The same process is used to play out the susceptibilities of Miller (what happened to a former crew member of his), Peters (her son) and Weir (his wife).  There are some shocking moments, but not enough to sustain much interest, and the computer graphics are not up to standard by a long shot. Especially early in the film, much of it has an animated look, like what you would have expected maybe twenty years ago (what was great in a movie like `Tron,' for example, doesn't cut it today). 	The supporting cast includes Jack Noseworthy (Justin), Jason Isaacs (D.J.), Sean Pertwee (Smith), Peter Marinker (Kilpatrick), Holley Chant (Claire) and Barclay Wright (Denny).  The performances are credible enough, especially by Fishburne and Quinlan, but director Paul Anderson has wrung little out of what he had to work with, and it's all delivered fairly unimaginatively. The special effects are mediocre, and in the end, what you have with `Event Horizon,' is essentially a pretty decent `B' movie.  There's a few thrills and some suspense, but don't go into this one expecting too much of a return on your investment of time or money.  I rate this one 3/10.",3,2,4,15 September 2000
The Nightmare Before Christmas," Magic, Tim Burton Style
","With the advent of video/DVD, certain movies lend themselves to annual viewing during specific holiday seasons, especially Halloween (It's the Great Pumpkin, Charlie Brown'), Thanksgiving (`Home for the Holidays'), and of course, The Big One, Christmas (Insert your own favorites here); specific films that for whatever reason manifest the spirit of their respective times of the year, and they generally match up one season per film.  Filmmaker Tim Burton, however, has the distinction of having created a singular film to add to this category, unique in that it is suited equally to both Halloween AND Christmas.  And it tops the entire list of the titles of which that can be said; in fact, it IS the list-- there simply are no others.  Burton's brainchild, which had a gestation period of many years before at last being realized in 1993 is, indeed, in a category of it's own.  It is, of course, `The Nightmare Before Christmas,' directed by Henry Selick.	Jack Skellington (Chris Sarandon), the Pumpkin King of Halloween Town, can put the scare on like no one else.  But after years of doing what he does best-- scaring the wits out of children of all ages, everywhere, every Halloween-- he's bored; depressed, even.  There's just no `rush' in it for him anymore.  So, after a particularly unfulfilling Allhallow's Eve, Jack wanders off alone into the night to contemplate his circumstance and his future, whereupon he inadvertently stumbles into `Christmas Town,' and discovers something new (`What's this?  What's this!')-- a different holiday, as well as the celebration that accompanies it.  Most importantly, though, he also discovers his counterpart, the one who is to this holiday what he is to Halloween.  `And they call... him... San-Dee CLAWS!'  And Jack, his eyes and ears filled with the sights and sounds of Christmas, is more excited than he's been in a long, long while.  He doesn't know, yet, what all of this is about, but he's going to find out; and he's already made up his mind:  Whatever it is, it's going to be his!  Sandee Claws, step aside-- Jack Skellington is here!	Through the magic of stop-motion animation, Burton's vision-- his story and the characters who populate his `nightmare'-- comes vividly to life, the process of which is guided along nicely by director Selick.  And what a bunch of characters there are!  Besides Jack (who is, without question, the star of the show), there is the two-faced (literally) Mayor (Glenn Shadix); Dr. Finklestein (wonderfully voiced by William Hickey); Lock, Shock and Barrel (Paul Reubens, Catherine O'Hara, Danny Elfman), the unholy trio who work for the dreadful Mr. Oogie Boogie (Ken Page); and, last but not least, gentle and compassionate Sally (Catherine O'Hara), who cares for Jack and so badly wants to help him find whatever it is he's looking for.  Intriguing characters for a highly original story, imaginatively drawn and presented with care and an expertise that really makes this one work.	Another element that sells it is the engaging score and original songs by Danny Elfman (who also supplies Jack's singing voice).  And Selick uses the music wisely to create an appropriate atmosphere and mood conducive to the storyline.  The songs, especially, are haunting, hypnotic, upbeat and theatrical, and combined with the magic of the splendid visual content, helps set the tone for a rich and thoroughly entertaining experience.	The supporting cast includes (the voices of) Ed Ivory (Santa), Susan McBride (Big Witch), Debi Durst (Corpse Kid/Corpse Mother/Small Witch), Greg Proops (Harlequin Demon/Devil/Sax Player), Kerry Katz (Man Under Stairs/Vampire/Corpse Father), Randy Crenshaw (Mr. Hyde/Behemoth/Vampire), Sherwood Ball (Mummy/ Vampire), Carmen Twillie (Undersea Gal/Man Under the Stairs) and Glenn Waters (Wolfman).  There's a decidedly dark side to this film that may be disturbing to younger viewers, but for those to whom the monster-in-the-closet no longer appears, `The Nightmare Before Christmas' is good for TWO of your favorite holidays (or actually, for any time of the year, for that matter).  Unique, to say the least, this is a fun foray into fantasy that can be enjoyed time and again.  The story, the characters, the images, the songs; it's all magic.  It is, in fact, the magic of the movies. Tim Burton style.  I rate this one 10/10.",10,8,11,21 January 2002
Caddyshack," '--Oh, there won't be any money, but on your deathbed, you will receive...total consciousness--'
","`National Lampoon's Animal House' may have been one of the first comedies to evolve from the `Saturday Night Live' generation, but it could be argued that `Caddyshack,' directed by Harold Ramis-- and which features two SNL alumni, Chevy Chase and Bill Murray-- actually spawned the entire `SNL genre,' of films, because this is the one that seemed to lock in that formulaic irreverence toward all things, of which they are so indicative. The story here revolves around a young man named Danny Noonan (Michael O'Keefe), a caddy at the upscale Bushwood Country Club, who is bucking for a caddy scholarship to get him into college.  Danny figures that the best shot he has at it is to volunteer for the assignment none of the other caddies want-- to caddy for the up-tight Judge Smails (Ted Knight), one of the executive directors of Bushwood, and `kiss up' a bit.  Smails responds by letting Danny mow his lawn and attend a christening ceremony for his new yacht.  But Danny is not one to be deterred, even when the good Judge tells him `The world needs ditch diggers, too.'  He just goes on, keeping his eyes and his options open.And it isn't long before Danny gets involved with Ty Webb (Chase), an independently wealthy goof-ball with a Zen/Chaplin philosophy of life, whose father was one of Judge Smails' partners in Bushwood.  So Danny takes some advice from Ty while caddying for him; advice which just may ultimately have an effect on whether or not he gets his scholarship.  Or maybe not.  Words of wisdom like `Be the Ball,' and `A donut with no hole is a danish,' may not be what he needs to put him on the fast track to success.  But then again, you never know; it's that kind of movie.  And there's no getting around it, this is funny stuff.The humor in this movie runs the gamut from broad to subtle, with at least two sight gags thrown in that identify it as belonging to the genre it helped create.  At the time of it's theatrical release, in 1980, it was fairly on the cutting edge of comedy; by today's standards, though, it doesn't seem nearly as irreverent, especially given the digressive trend in the genre lately, which has spewed forth such fare as `Freddy Got Fingered,' and `Road Trip.'  Then again, this one had Harold Ramis behind the camera, and Ramis has an acute sense of comedic timing, he knows what works, and he made the most of the basic screenplay (by Ramis, Brian Doyle-Murray and Douglas Kenney) and the terrific cast of comedians with which he had to work, all of whom fit so well into the pattern and fabric of this particular picture.Rarely does a comedy (or any film for that matter) have so many actors who fit their characters so perfectly as in this film, beginning with Chevy Chase, who embodies the slightly skewed and off-center Ty Webb so well it's almost frightening.  Webb is a guy who veritably floats through life in a perpetual Zen-like state of distraction, and it makes you realize that there probably really are characters like this walking around in the real world. But if the existence of a Ty Webb type is only highly probable, there's no doubt whatsoever about the fact that there are guys like Al Czervik amongst us.Rodney Dangerfield plays Czervik, the obnoxious, fun-loving, high-rolling land developer with a specially made golf club and an eye on Bushwood.  In Czervik, Dangerfield creates a character who is outrageous, droll, lacks any taste whatsoever, and is entirely hilarious.  It is, without question, the best character and performance of Dangerfield's cinematic career, and -- like Chase-- it's almost scary the way he fits into the character so naturally and completely.The real heart of this movie, however, is Bill Murray, who turns in what just may be the definitive Murray performance with his character, Carl Spackler, the Assistant Greenskeeper at Bushwood.  Murray brings Carl, the socially and intellectually challenged man-with-a-plan, to life with subtle nuance and a flare of comedic genius.  A lot of what he did in this film was improvised, including much of his two most memorable and hilarious scenes, one in which he's describing his encounter with the Dalai Lama, and the other being his soliloquy of the `Cinderella Boy' on the course at Atlanta. This is truly inspired, funny stuff, and it proves what can be done without resorting to banal vulgarity or crudeness (not that this film is entirely devoid of it, but at least it's tempered here somewhat-- not so overt and in-your-face like you'll often find in some of the more recent offerings of the genre).  And there's a harmless shiftiness about Carl, who is about as deep as a pan pizza, and Murray plays it all beautifully.O'Keefe gives a solid performance, as well, but he's basically the straight man here, the set-up guy for one funny situation after another.  And he does it quite nicely.Also giving memorable performances are Ted Knight, as the rigid, conservative Judge, and Brian Doyle-Murray as Lou Loomis, who oversees the caddies at Bushwood.The supporting cast includes Sarah Holcomb (Maggie), Scott Colomby (Tony), Cindy Morgan (Lacey Underall), Dan Resin (Dr. Beeper), Henry Wilcoxon (The Bishop), Albert Salmi (Mr. Noonan), John F. Barmon Jr. (Spaulding Smails) and Lois Kibbee (Mrs. Smails).  With this film, Ramis and company honed the formula for comedy that incorporated pop culture and contemporary sensibilities into it like never before.  And `Caddyshack' is an example of it in it's purest form; you'll have to look long and hard to find anything out of this same mold today that can come close to the prototype.  It's one of those movies that gets even better with age-- and funnier, too.  It's the magic of the movies.  I rate this one 10/10.",10,61,84,7 July 2001
From Dusk Till Dawn," An Embarrassment
","A promising beginning quickly gives way to shameful exploitation and excesses that are unworthy of the participants involved, and even the most adept rationalization will not excuse them from taking part in a project that is so blatantly devoid of anything even remotely close to possessing any redeeming aspects or qualities whatsoever.  Screenwriter Quentin Tarantino and director Robert Rodriguez had apparently attained the kind of stature within the right kind of circles that gave them free reign going into the production of `From Dusk Till Dawn,' and the results are something akin to what happens when you turn a couple of undisciplined youngsters loose in a toy store and then refuse to hold them accountable for the mess they make.  The thing is, the people involved here are artists, who collectively and individually, have proven themselves capable of achievements beyond the norm; and as an audience-- collectively and individually-- that is what we have come to expect from them.  And that's not saying that every time out Tarantino has to give us a `Pulp Fiction,' or that Clooney or Keitel are expected to turn in an Academy Award worthy performance.  But given their credentials, it is not out of line to expect them to deliver a product that includes at least some semblance of dignity, integrity and quality.  And, unfortunately, none of the above are to be found anywhere in this `B-' schlock Rodriguez and Co. have fostered upon an unsuspecting public.The degradations begin when the morally bankrupt Gecko brothers, Seth (George Clooney) and Richie (Tarantino), go on a spree of murder and robbery on their way to Mexico, where they're to meet up with a colleague who will provide them with a safe haven-- for a price, of course.  Near the border, to facilitate their crossing, they kidnap a minister, Jacob Fuller (Harvey Keitel), and his children, Kate (Juliette Lewis) and Scott (Ernest Liu). Seth sees the motor home Jacob is driving as the perfect vehicle to get them to their destination, and the recently widowed Jacob-- who is currently struggling with his faith-- sees no choice but to go along with the demands of his captors.  What Jacob cannot know, however, is that he will be taking them to a rendezvous that will deposit them all veritably at the gates of Hell.In the opening scene, a Texas Ranger, Earl McGraw (Michael Parks), walks into a somewhat secluded liquor store where he has a conversation with the young clerk, during which they discuss the news of the Gecko brothers.  Of course, Seth and Richie are already at hand, and the ensuing violence sets the stage for all that follows.  And right up to the part at which the first shots are fired, courtesy of a riveting, if all too brief, performance by Parks (this is actually the film's best scene), it's actually a good beginning to a very bad movie.  At this point, the film has had it's moment, and it's all downhill from there.With this screenplay, Tarantino-- who made a name for himself (and rightly so) with `Pulp Fiction' and `Reservoir Dogs,'-- developed a blueprint for excessive (even for him) violence and moral abasement, then handed it over to Rodriguez, who took the ball and ran with it.  Straight down into the ground.  The characters and situations created in this film give a negative value to human life and propriety, even taken within the broadest cinematic terms of expression.  And the use of advanced technology and F/X by Rodriguez toward such an end as this is contemptible.  Totally without redeeming value, this film appeals to nothing more than the basest instincts of the infantile mind, and is an embarrassment to the craft of filmmaking.If you bother to sift through the detritus of this visual and psychological malady, you will actually find a decent performance by Clooney, though given the context in which it exists, it will take an extremely objective eye to discern it at all.  Seeking out a good performance here is like attempting to remedy the stench of a pig sty with a can of air freshener.  And it's tough watching someone you admire as an artist wallow (and willingly yet) in such claptrap as this.As far as the participation of Harvey Keitel in this, one can only wonder what could have prompted such a decision.  In fact, one can speculate that Jacob Fuller's loss of faith occurred after he read this script.The supporting cast includes Salma Hayek (Santanico Pandemonium), Cheech Marin (in three roles), Danny Trejo (Razor Charlie), Fred Williamson (Frost) and Kelly Preston (Newscaster Kelly Houge).  A disaster that should never have been allowed to see the light of day, `From Dusk Till Dawn' will no doubt find it's own niche in the `cult film' Hall of Fame, and unfortunately there are those who will embrace this nonsense out-of-hand.  If made by amateurs or an aspiring filmmaker who simply did not know better, the existence of this film would at least be understandable and acceptable within the context of those given terms and conditions.  But with the names and talents of the likes of Tarantino, Clooney, Rodriguez, Keitel and Lewis attached, there is no excuse for it; no excuse whatsoever.  In the final analysis, this is nothing more than a demonstration of the blatant misuse of the magic that is the movies.  I rate this one 1/10.",1,4,12,2 July 2002
Jerry Maguire," High-Energy Entertainment
","By definition, and depending upon who you're talking to, `Success' can be measured in a number of different ways.  It's winning the competition, celebrating a Golden Wedding Anniversary or, to many, just making the most money.  The first two are absolutes; you win and you make it to number 50. No gray areas.  If you're not dead, you're alive; you're either pregnant or you're not.  But in regards to that third item on the list, what are the parameters by which you measure that particular success?  Are there lines across which you will not step to make that extra buck?  Or do you do whatever it takes-- including selling your soul and sacrificing your very identity-- to make as much of the green as you can.  Is that success?  Or is that selling out.  Can there, in fact, be true success when ethics and integrity are absent?  It's the territory writer/director Cameron Crowe explores in `Jerry Maguire,' the hit 1996 film that landed him an Oscar nomination for Best Original Screenplay, a Best Actor nomination for star Tom Cruise, and captured the award for Best Supporting Actor for Cuba Gooding Jr.	Jerry Maguire (Cruise) is a high-powered sports agent for a huge agency, handling a portfolio filled with high profile sports figures.  And the name of Jerry's game is money; he gets the big bucks for those he represents, he keeps them in the limelight and in the end pulls down some mighty big bucks for himself and the firm.  But at what price?  Who is Jerry Maguire, really? Has he played the chameleon for so long as a means to an end that even he doesn't know who he is anymore?  Does he even consider it?  If he stopped to think about it, the answer would be a resounding `No.'  But then something happens.  One night, he wakes up and happens to look at himself in the mirror, and for whatever reason, it suddenly dawns on him what a selfish, soulless, empty life he is leading.  So in the wake of this epiphany, he seizes the moment, sits down at his keyboard and hammers out a `mission/morality statement,' in which he reorganizes his entire approach to his career, including reestablishing parameters and setting new priorities making conscience, ethics and integrity his paramount concerns.  And while still riding the high of his nocturnal enlightenment, he goes to his office, makes copies of his statement and distributes it to the mailboxes of everyone from his boss on down.  Then he goes home and goes to bed.
	In the cold light of morning, however, he realizes what he's done and races to his office to avert disaster.  Too late.  He enters the room to a hail of praise and appreciation from his peers, but his boss is less enthusiastic. It's no surprise to Jerry, then, when the big `M' his superiors are interested in turns out to be `Money' and not `Morality,' as in `Money talks, Jerry walks.'  And just like that he's out the door.  But before he leaves, he vows to make it on his own.  He's up, he's positive, he has his statement-- and he doesn't have a clue what to do next.  What he does know is that the adventure of a lifetime is awaiting.  And the world is about to meet the `real' Jerry Maguire. 	Cameron Crowe made his debut as a writer/director with `Say Anything' in 1989, in which he first exhibited that keen insight into the human condition that has been one of the trademarks of his success as a filmmaker.  In `Jerry Maguire' he demonstrates again that acute sense of knowing what makes people tick, and leaves no doubt that he knows how to convey it to his audience.  Crowe's story, as well as the presentation, is original and imaginative, and he fills it with real characters involved in very real situations.  And it's the characters that really sell it, because these are three-dimensional people, not just cardboard cut-outs, and moreover, Cameron knows how to get the best out of his actors to really bring them to life.	Tom Cruise was the perfect choice to play Jerry; he has the look, the energy and the talent to get inside this guy's skin and make him tick, and he successfully channels his natural exuberance into his character, tempering his performance just enough to make it really work.  An Oscar nomination does not come cheaply, and Cruise certainly deserved the one he received for his work here.	Cuba Gooding Jr.'s performance is deserving of the acclaim he received for it, as well.  As Rod Tidwell, the pro football player/client who sticks by Jerry and insists that he `Show me the money!' Gooding equals, if not surpasses Cruise's level of enthusiasm with a vibrant and rich portrayal that makes Rod one of his most memorable characters.  Like Cruise, Gooding is perfectly cast and points up, again, what an acute sense Cameron has for who and what will work to bring his story so convincingly to the screen.	Not to be outdone by her co-stars, Renee Zellweger gives an endearing performance as the vulnerable but steadfast, single mom, Dorothy Boyd. She's such a `giving' actor, and she endows Dorothy with a gentle, caring manner that expresses her deepest thoughts and feelings so well.  Her reaction, in the scene in which Jerry tells Dorothy-- with his back turned to her-- that he has broken up with his fiancee, Avery (Kelly Preston), is priceless, and alone makes this film worth watching (repeatedly).  Her work here is every bit as Oscar worthy as Cruise and Gooding's, and it's hard to understand why she was overlooked, as she is such a vital presence in this film.  9/10.	The supporting cast includes Jerry O'Connell (Frank), Jay Mohr (Bob Sugar), Bonnie Hunt (terrific in her role of Laurel Boyd, Dorothy's sister), Regina King (Marcee) and Jonathan Lipnicki, unforgettable as Dorothy's precocious son, Ray.  A triumph for Cameron Crowe, this movie is, indeed, magic.",9,103,138,14 January 2002
Mission: Impossible II," John Woo: The Name Is Action
","Tom Cruise and director John Woo team up for the high-voltage, heart-stopping, edge-of-your-seat action thriller `Mission Impossible 2,' a non-stop rush of excitement that grabs you before the credits even begin to roll with the pulsating vibes of Hans Zimmer's terrific score.  Once again, Cruise stars as Ethan Hunt of the IMF, called into action by his boss, Swanbeck (Anthony Hopkins), when a plot involving a deadly virus is hatched by former IMF agent Sean Ambrose (Dougray Scott).  Hunt first has to recruit a professional thief, Nyah Nordoff-Hall (Thandie Newton) to help him get the information he needs to avert a disaster that could ultimately put millions of lives at risk.  Once he has her, the IMF team goes to work; and when they do, they take you with them on a ride that doesn't end until the screen goes dark. 	Simply put, Cruise has never been better; he's matured since the first `Mission Impossible,' and turns in an outstanding performance here, imbuing Hunt with a believable invincibility that gives a luster and credibility to his heroics throughout the film.  Scott is exemplary, as well, and makes his villain and the evil he concocts real.  And Newton is charming as the intrepid Nyah, who first catches Hunt's eye, then proves what she's made of when she becomes an integral part of the intrigue.  Add this to the expertise that Woo brings to this project, and the result is one unforgettable movie.  Working with a superb screenplay by Robert Towne, he takes just enough time to set the plot in motion, and once it starts, it just doesn't stop.  His choreographed action sequences are extraordinary; the motorcycle chase is worthy of any Steve McQueen ever did, and the climactic fight between Hunt and Ambrose should set a new standard for the entire industry.  His use of slow motion interspersed throughout the action is highly effective, and so well done that it heightens the impact of the inherent drama, as does his attention to detail.  Woo more than covers all the bases, and with this work proves beyond the shadow of a doubt that he is one of the finest, if not the best, action directors in the industry, past or present. 	Ving Rhames returns as Luther, and adds that extra spark to the overall proceedings with another fine performance.  The excellent supporting cast also includes William R. Mapother, John Polson, Dominic Purcell and Richard Roxburgh.  `Mission Impossible 2' is a rare and special contribution to the action genre; it fairly rips through the screen and takes no prisoners. It's all here, from the trade mark true- identity-hidden-behind-the-mask to the familiar Lalo Schifrin theme (rendered this time around by metal-rappers Limp Bizkit).  Superior in all ways to the first `Mission Impossible,' this is nothing less than a triumph for Cruise; and John Woo, thy name is Action. For the future, their mission together, if they choose to accept it, is to deliver `Mission Impossible 3.'  In the meantime, don't miss this one; it is one wild trip.  I rate this one 9/10.",9,8,14,10 July 2000
Black Hawk Down," More Like A 'Tony' Than A 'Ridley' Scott Film
","That millions of people around the world suffer from hunger, tyranny, suppression, discrimination and worse is apparent to anyone who even only occasionally turns on the 6:00 news.  Heinous crimes and atrocities are committed daily in third world countries, and even in the most highly developed and civilized countries, as we all know only too well in the wake of September 11.  And the frustration, guilt and despair evoked by the accounts of such things can induce a sense of helplessness that is immeasurable.  Filmmakers here have chosen one especially significant incident from among the many on which to elaborate, and which puts the plight of those less fortunate into succinct perspective.  Probably because this was the largest land battle since Vietnam, the battle of Mogadishu on October 3, 1993 was selected to bring the turmoil in Somalia to light, and in so doing bring attention to the ongoing distress of our global community, as well.  A dramatization of the events of that day are depicted in `Black Hawk Down,' directed by Ridley Scott from a screenplay by Ken Nolan, adapted from the book by Mark Bowden.	Civil War in raging in Somalia, and thousands upon thousands are starving to death under the relentless rule of warlord Mohamed Farrah Aidid.  U.N. food drops have been ineffective in relieving the situation, as Aidid's troops confiscate the food in his name.  Hunger and fear are Aidid's weapons of choice.  When information comes their way that two of Aidid's most influential advisors will be in conference in the city, the commanders of the American troops stationed nearby determine to launch a raid to capture them, which they feel will greatly undermine Aidid's hold on Mogadishu.  As planned, the operation will take less than an hour; but as with all sure things, the mission quickly goes bad, American troops become trapped in the city and are summarily engaged in hostilities by the enemy.  During the melee, one of the aircraft, an American Black Hawk, is shot down.  From his command post, General William Garrison (Sam Shepard) assesses the situation, and determines that no matter what, `No man will be left behind.' Afterward, the whole affair briefly became a blip on the evening news and a headline in the papers; but to those who lived it, it became a day they would never forget.  And this is their story.	With his 1998 film, `Saving Private Ryan,' Steven Spielberg set the bench mark for depicting combat on the screen in decidedly realistic terms.  That film gave the viewer a sense of being in combat that was unprecedented, and with it, Spielberg raised the bar for all who followed.  Now, it's expected that any major motion picture dealing with such subject matter will deliver that same kind of realism.  And this film certainly does.  But Spielberg did something else, too, that was very effective:  He presented all of his major players on a very personal level, which gave `Ryan' a significant impact emotionally as well as viscerally.  Ridley Scott did not do that with this film, and it makes all the difference in the world.  Toward the end of the film, one of the characters, Hoot (Eric Bana), makes the comment that in battle, it's all about `The guy next to you.'  And that's very true; the problem here is, we don't really know who that guy is.  Beyond enabling the audience to feel the sting of combat, to be entirely effective and really make that necessary connection with the viewer, Scott should have made sure we knew enough about these men out there fighting for their lives to really feel something when one of them went down.  With few exceptions, it is difficult to put a name to a face during it all.  Quite frankly, for the most part you can't tell the players without a scorecard.  What he basically gives you is glimpses into a number of lives, and leaves it up to you to fill in the blanks.  And it's just not enough to make this the gut wrenching drama that it should have been.	As far as performances, only a couple actually stand out:  Sam Shepard as General Garrison, and Tom Sizemore as Lt. Colonel Danny McKnight.  Shepard is outstanding, turning in a fairly understated portrayal that is entirely believable, while Sizemore shows much more reserve than usual, and gives one of the more affecting performances of the film.  Also worth noting is the work of Ron Eldard as Mike Durant, one of the pilots of the Black Hawks. But Josh Hartnett, as Staff Sergeant Matt Eversmann, while creating a character that is believable, and definitely endowed with a 90s sensitivity, is less than a commanding presence, and for the most part is nothing more than just another face in the crowd.  The same fate befalls Ewan McGregor as John Grimes, a company clerk/typist who finally gets his chance for duty in the field on this ill-fated mission.	The supporting cast includes William Fichtner (Master Sergeant Howe), Ewen Bremner (Nelson), Jason Isaacs (Captain Steele), Jeremy Piven (Wolcott), Orlando Bloom (Blackburn) Danny Hoch (Pilla) and Gregory Sporleder (Galentine).  Without question, the highlight of this film is the patriotism it inspires; in that regard, it's through the roof.  But as a cinematic endeavor, `Black Hawk Down,' is average at best.  It could have-- and should have-- been a film as emotionally gripping as they come, but Scott and Nolan dropped the ball by concentrating too much on the technical aspects of the project and apparently assuming that the human element would emerge of it's own accord.  The result is an intensely patriotic action film-- albeit a darn good one-- which accurately (by all accounts) depicts an incident that, while extremely disconcerting, is presented in a less than satisfying manner.  Scott and his team put together a good package with this film, but they just didn't fill it up-- or deliver the goods as well as they could have.  I rate this one 7/10.",7,0,0,6 February 2002
The Insider," Compelling Drama From Michael Mann
","Many times, the resolution to a problematic situation is seemingly as easy as simply knowing right from wrong, and acting upon it.  The sub-text of the problem, however, is often more complex; especially when the onerous decision of personal sacrifice is involved.  Such is the situation explored in `The Insider,' a powerful drama directed by Michael Mann and starring Al Pacino and Russell Crowe.  Based on the true story of Dr. Jeffrey Wigand (Crowe), a former Corporate Vice President of one of the major tobacco companies, it examines his struggle to act in accordance with his own conscience after circumstances put him together with Lowell Bergman (Pacino), a producer for Mike Wallace (Christopher Plummer) and the highly respected television news program, `60 Minutes.'  On the surface, Wigand's conundrum seems easily dispelled; as a research scientist involved with matters of health, he has vital information concerning the addictive nature of nicotine and, moreover, the attempt by the company for which he worked to enhance the consumers propensity for it by manipulating the ingredients of their product.  Under oath (and televised on C-SPAN), the CEO's of the seven major tobacco corporations testified, to a man, that to their knowledge nicotine was not addictive; but Wigand knows otherwise.  And by claiming ignorance of the properties of nicotine, they subverted the truth even more by refuting what Wigand knew to be what they considered their real business: The delivery of nicotine to the consumer.  You put a cigarette in your mouth, you light it up, you get your fix.  Bottom line, not only do they know exactly what they're doing, they perjured themselves on national television when questioned about it.  Wigand's problem, however, is the confidentiality agreement he signed upon termination of his employment; if he talks, he loses the lucrative severance package that includes health benefits for his family.  And he has a young daughter with acute asthma.  So from his perspective, in knowing the truth about `Big Tobacco,' the question becomes one of morality:  How much does he owe, and to whom, considering the personal sacrifices he will make if he does the right thing. 	Beginning with an intelligent and well developed screenplay (by Mann and Eric Roth, adapted from the magazine article `The Man Who Knew Too Much,' by Marie Brenner), Mann meticulously presents this story of ordinary people under the stress of extraordinary circumstances in a manner that is creatively imaginative and totally engrossing; in short, a flawless delivery of a terrific script and story.  The tension begins from the moment we are introduced to Wigand and continues to build throughout the film.  There is inspired camera work (at times almost invasive, in a way that puts the viewer `in' the scene), impeccable transitions and pacing, and Mann exacts a number of brilliant performances from his actors, especially Crowe and Pacino. 	Crowe gives a detailed, Oscar worthy performance (he was nominated) as Wigand, deftly capturing the traits and attitude of this intelligent, complex individual; his volatile temperament and demanding attempt at self restraint, his forthright manner and love for his family, and the toll that coping with the demons that plague his conscience takes upon him.  Crowe has a compelling screen presence that commands the viewers attention; his expressive reactions alone convey intelligence, a sense that the `wheels are always turning,' that demands regard.  It is quite simply a remarkable character study delivered by an amazingly gifted actor whose approach to characterization is, in many ways, reminiscent of the style of Alec Guinness. 	Pacino gives a commanding performance as well; the kind of work we've come to expect from one of our greatest actors, who time and again never ceases to amaze with what he can do.  As with Crowe, his turn here is firmly planted in reality, and it's that ability to make it so real that gives such emotional impact to the drama.  And it should have garnered him a Best Actor nod as well. 	Other notable performances include Christopher Plummer, who absolutely `becomes' Mike Wallace, affecting a manner of speech and physical traits that are entirely convincing, and Diane Venora, as Wigand's wife, Liane. Also, in smaller-- but highly effective-- roles, are Michael Gambon (Thomas Sandefur) and especially Bruce McGill (Ron Motley), whose work here should have brought him a Best Supporting Actor nomination.  In the final analysis, `The Insider' is a film that will keep you enthralled from beginning to end; one that rings of truth beyond reproach and which aptly demonstrates how important it is to have men of principle and integrity among us.  This film is an example of cinema at it's best, and one that demands viewing by one and all.  I rate this one 10/10.",10,0,1,29 December 2000
"Girl, Interrupted"," One Life Interrupted
","Some outstanding performances (including one Oscar winner) highlight this story of a young woman who loses a year of her life incarcerated in a mental hospital, mainly due to society's penchant at the time for institutionalizing even the borderline mentally infirm.  `Girl, Interrupted,' directed by James Mangold, is the story (based on her autobiography) of Susanna Kaysen (Winona Ryder), a young aspiring writer suffering from depression.  After what may or may not have been a suicide attempt (she chases a bottle of aspirin with a bottle of vodka), she is spirited off to a private mental hospital, where she is diagnosed as having a `borderline personality defect.'  Simply put, it means she is young, intelligent and having trouble coping with an era (the 60s) and a world in a state of flux, as well as the pressure from her parents and peers to attend an upscale university.  Susanna, however, wants only to live life and write, and though she knows her own mind in this regard, the forces that surround her are too great, and she is torn between what she wants, and what the `world' expects.  All of which leads her into some gray areas in which time and space as she knows it suddenly does not necessarily coincide with the continuum of reality.	A powerful film that makes a statement about tolerance and the methods of treatment available for the mentally ill, it underscores the necessity for compassion and understanding of those unable to function on their own.  And it successfully illustrates that in dealing with people in need, there must be a humanistic approach, as  it is more involved than merely separating the wheat from the chaff.	As Susanna, Winona Ryder gives a performance that is both affecting and intense; she readily conveys the angst of a young woman confused, yet determined, who has yet to learn one of life's most valuable lessons:  Make the decision.  Susanna has been walking a fence that gets narrower with each step she takes, until finally, her fall to either one side or the other was inevitable.  What she had yet to learn at that point, was that it is better to stop before you reach the end of the fence, so as to be able to decide for yourself which way you're going to fall.  That way, for better or worse, at least you know that `you've' made the decision that's going to affect your life, which makes it easier to live with.  Susanna could have saved herself a lot of misery had she stated unequivocally to her parents, and most importantly to herself, that after High School graduation `this' is what I am going to do.  A hard concept to grasp, however, when one is eighteen and being pulled in opposite directions at the same time.	In her Oscar winning performance, Angelina Jolie proves beyond the shadow of a doubt that, indeed, there is substance beneath the beauty.  As Lisa, the sociopath with an ice cube for a heart, she brings an enigmatic, intimidating presence to the screen.  A soulless miscreant, she thrives within the confines of the institution by bullying her way through every day of her life.  On the `outside,' however, she finds repeatedly that the bravura that works for her in confinement attracts only the kind of attention that gets her sent back again.  It's a dynamic, over-the-top, in-your-face performance for which she deservedly received the award for Best Supporting Actress.  And, hopefully, after proving here what she is truly capable of, Jolie's career will successfully transcend her looks and that already famous pair of lips (though following this effort with the stagnating `Gone In 60 Seconds' does not bode well).  	The supporting cast includes Clea DuVall (Georgina), Brittany Murphy (Daisy), Elisabeth Moss (Polly), Jared Leto (Tobias), Jeffrey Tambor (Dr. Potts), Vanessa Redgrave (Dr. Wick), Whoopi Goldberg (Valerie), Mary Kay Place (Mrs. Gilcrest), Kurtwood Smith (Dr. Crumble) and Angela Bettis (Janet).  A somewhat disturbing film, `Girl, Interrupted' will affect you on any number of emotional levels and will command, not only your attention, but your involvement.  Simply put, this is riveting drama that refuses to let you off the hook for even a moment.  There's a message in here about the perspectives and significance of society as a whole, but more importantly, about the impact an individual can make on our world and the people around us, and of the importance of forging ahead and making a decision before it's too late.

Singin' in the Rain," 'Gotta Dance!'
","This is a movie that'll give you Happy Feet just thinking about it once you've seen it.  Quite possibly the purest movie musical ever made, `Singin' In the Rain,' directed by Gene Kelly and Stanley Donen, has everything you could want in a musical:  A good story, perfect cast, imaginative choreography, memorable music and songs, terrific performances, and a presentation that is nothing less than inspired.  It takes you behind the scenes of the movie business, set during the transitional period between the heyday of silent films and the advent of talkies.  Don Lockwood (Kelly) and Lina Lamont (Jean Hagen) are two of the biggest stars in Hollywood, the Tracy and Hepburn of Monumental Studios, which is about to release their latest movie-- a swashbuckling costume drama.  But a rival studio has just released `The Jazz Singer,' and overnight the industry is revolutionized, and silent films are just that quickly a thing of the past.  To keep up and stay afloat, the major studios need to produce pictures that talk.  And where does Monumental start?  By retooling their latest big star vehicle (with Lockwood and Lamont) into a MUSICAL swashbuckling costume drama.  If it's song and dance the public wants, then that's what they'll get-- right along with the drama of the costume and the swashbuckling thrown in to boot. There's one problem, though; the sound of Lina's voice has the effect of fingernails scraping a chalkboard, and her diction isn't going to land her the role of Juliet anytime soon.  The powers that be at Monumental fear they may soon have a `falling' star on their hands.  But there's always a solution, of course; and leave it to Don's partner, Cosmo (Donald O'Connor), to come up with it.  And it just happens to involve a young lady named Kathy (Debbie Reynolds), with whom Don has just recently become acquainted.  And that's where the story really begins.Kelly and Donen (who also teamed up for `On the Town' and `It's Always Fair Weather') certainly know how to put on a show.  The name of their game is Entertainment-- yes, with a capital `E'-- and that's exactly what you get. The dazzling production numbers are upbeat and electrifying:  Donald O'Connor's `Make 'Em Laugh;' `Good Mornin',' which features Debbie Reynolds (joined by Kelly and O'Connor); a diction lesson by Kelly and O'Connor that begins with `Moses,' who `Supposes his 'toeses' are roses;' and a transporting routine with Kelly and Cyd Charisse.  But the highlight is Kelly doing the title song while `Singin' and dancin' in the rain.'  And these are but a few of the magical marvels of this film.When Kelly sings `Gotta dance!' you'd better believe it, because he's the best of the best, and he's at the top of his game here.  He's a consummate entertainer and a perfectionist, and simply a joy to watch.  And with O'Connor next to him you really have something special, as they tend to bring out the best in one another (I submit their `Moses' number as evidence).  Also, they seem to genuinely enjoy working together; there appears to be an almost fun sense of spirited competition going on as they dance, and it's an invigorating experience (if this wasn't so, then they've pulled off a marvelous bit of acting).  But no one can out-dance Gene Kelly. Period.  And he may not be the world's greatest singer, but in this film his voice is in top form, as well.Also a consummate performer, Donald O'Connor more than holds his own with Kelly on the dance floor (and he's at the top of a very short list of those who can), and the sense of humor and personality he brings to the film are invaluable.  His energetic `Make 'Em Laugh' number does just that; and while it's funny, it also showcases O'Connor's versatility and gives him a chance to display some amazing moves (how many people-- even professional dancers-- can dance up the side of a wall and into a back flip?).  And he makes it look so easy.  As Cosmo, he's the quintessential second banana and jack-of-all-trades.  He dances, sings, plays piano, cracks jokes, pops up for tech work in the sound booth, and on top of everything else he's an idea man and a general facilitator of anything and everything that needs facilitating.  If Danny Kaye had a brother it would be O'Connor; and-- like Kelly-- he's just a pleasure to watch.Debbie Reynolds was twenty-years-old when she made this film, and she's a perfect fit with Kelly and O'Connor.  Beautiful and talented-- and mature beyond her years-- she has a kind of sparkle all her own and a terrific screen presence.  She can sing and she can dance, she looks good no matter what she's doing, and there's a wholesome, girl-next-door quality about her that makes her endearing.  It also makes Kathy a very real and believable character, and Reynolds plays her perfectly.As Lina Lamont, the girl with a voice that could make cats cry, Jean Hagen is an absolute riot.  Reminiscent of a character Mia Farrow would create years later in `Radio Days,' Sally White-- though perhaps a bit more dense-- Lina takes the `vain' out of `vanity,' and Hagen brings her to life with a vivid, memorable performance.  And it's just another of the many elements that make this such a great film.The supporting cast includes Millard Mitchell (Simpson), Rita Moreno (Zelda), Douglas Fowley (Roscoe) and Kathleen Freeman (Phoebe).  If pure entertainment is what you're after, you need look no further than `Singin' In the Rain,' which successfully dispels any doubts that there is, indeed, magic in the movies.  Because this movie is magic, a sheer delight from beginning to end no matter how many times you see it.  There's been a number of great musicals made over the years, but of them all, with Kelly and O'Connor at the top of their form, this one just may be the definitive offering.

This Is Spinal Tap," Reiner 'Taps' Into Something Special
","An aging, fading British rock group is touring America, and on hand to document the occasion is a filmmaker who has been blown away by their sound since the first time he heard them; and the result is offered up here for the perusal of all, in `This Is Spinal Tap,' without question the best feature length parody of a rock band ever made, directed by Rob Reiner. When the band returns to the U.S. to promote their latest album, `Smell The Glove,' director Marty DiBergi (Reiner)  accompanies them on tour, conducting interviews and taping performances, in an effort to get it all down for posterity.  And get it all he does; the highs and lows, the drama and pathos, the words, wisdom and witticisms of this legendary rock group. It's all here, and we owe it all to a man of incredible intuition, imagination and foresight, Marty DiBergi.  But, with all seriousness aside, folks... 	When this film was released in 1984, it was fresh and new, cutting edge satire that seemed almost outrageous and scathingly intemperate; and to some extent, it still does today.  The difference now, however, is that the times have caught up to and surpassed the parody of the movie.  By anyone's standards, much of this film now seems quite tame, though the subject of the satire remains every bit as relevant today as it did then.  The interviews, conducted and delivered with such dry humor and subtle wit, readily withstand the test of time and are as funny now as ever; but the songs, especially the lyrics, pale now somewhat in the wake of such acts as Marilyn Manson, Rob Zombie, Slipknot, Monster Magnet, System Of A Down, Coal Chamber, Pantera and Alice In Chains (just to mention a few), all of whom in reality have gone far beyond the parameters set by Spinal Tap.  And with today's accessibility to such a wide variety of groups and music via MTV, MTVX, VH-1 and all the other myriad cable connections, it's simply taken the `sting' out of the impact of the film.  Like science fiction that has become science fact, our culture and society has contextually changed it's frame of reference, which of course must change the way we perceive a film like `Spinal Tap.' 	What can never change is the quality of the overall movie, the precision of the satire, and the caliber of the performances and direction.  With genuine sincerity, Reiner/DiBergi delivers a truly believable `Rockumentary.'  His pace and timing are impeccable, and his eye for detail is thorough (though much of it will be lost on today's generation).  The performances are first rate all around:  Michael McKean, totally credible as David St. Hubbins (lead guitar, vocals), possibly the best character he's ever done; Christopher Guest as Nigel Tufnel (lead guitar, vocals); Harry Shearer as Derek Smalls (bass, vocals); and, of course Reiner, who'is' DeBergi.  Also turning in notable performances are Bruno Kirby (Tommy Pischedda), R.J. Parnell (Mick Shrimpton, drummer), David Kaff (Viv Savage, keyboards, vocals), Tony Hendra (Ian Faith), Fran Drescher (Bobbi Flekman), and Patrick Macnee (Sir Denis Eaton-Hogg).  Though it may have lost some of it's edge due to changing times, `This Is Spinal Tap' will forever remain a milestone in cinematic history.  The songs may be dated but the humor is timeless; this is top-notch satire, and the parody set the standard in the rock genre for those who followed, like Weird Al Yankovic.  The appeal of this film is going to vary from generation to generation, and it follows that the level of appreciation is going to vary; but the fact will always remain that this is a unique movie that succinctly captures the spirit and essence of an entire era.  And for that, Reiner and Co. get a tip of the hat.  I rate this one 9/10.",9,0,2,2 October 2000
The Mummy Returns," A Special Effects Extravaganza
","If you've seen the trailer for this movie, you're probably expecting fast paced adventure, non-stop action and a special effects extravaganza with just enough story to keep it all interesting.  And if that's what you're hoping for, you certainly won't be disappointed; because that's exactly what you get in `The Mummy Returns,' written and directed by Stephen Sommers. The story begins in Egypt, where Rick O'Connell (Brendan Fraser) and his wife, Evelyn (Rachel Weisz) discover an ancient bracelet that had once belonged to a warrior known as `The Scorpion King (The Rock),' who, back in the day, had sold his soul to the god, Anubis, for control of his armies and domination of the world.  Now, it seems, The Scorpion King's resurrection is imminent, and if he succeeds and once again raises the armies of Anubis, he could very well take over or destroy the world.  Followers of Im-Ho-Tep (Arnold Vosloo), however, who are privy to this information as well, decide to resurrect their dark leader so that he can face The Scorpion King, defeat him, take control of Anubis' armies and conquer the world himself, putting them in control.  But the key to the whole plan lies with who has control of the bracelet at the time of The Scorpion King's resurrection.  And the O'Connells have taken it back home with them to London. 
	So the adventure begins in earnest, moving from Egypt to London, then back again to Egypt.  Along the way, there's plenty of mummies, fighting, and bugs, but very few surprises, except for one scene near the end when something quite unexpected happens.  The story itself gets somewhat lost in the muddle, but it doesn't really matter; plot is fairly insignificant in a movie like this, as long as it maintains at least a thread of credibility and can give the action some context.  And that it does, so all is well and it allows you to get on with what this movie is really all about, which-- simply put-- is having a good time.	With shades of `Indiana Jones' and `Star Wars' abounding, the real success of this movie lies in the fact that it never pretends to be anything other than what it is or what it was meant to be, and that is an entertaining, fun movie.  It's visually explosive, from the sweeping, desert vistas of the converging, battling armies, to the mummies and assorted demons and creatures generously sprinkled throughout.  And the hand-to-hand combat scenes between Evelyn and Anck-Su-Namun (Patricia Velazquez) are especially thrilling.  The one element of the film that doesn't seem to work too well has to do with a particular mode of transportation to which the O'Connells must resort upon their return to Egypt, and which ultimately plays a significant part in the outcome of the whole adventure.  It's something that seemingly would have been more appropriate in `The Adventures of Baron Munchausen' or `Peter Pan.'	As far as the performances, suffice to say that the actors involved all do their jobs well; after all, in a movie like this you're not going to find anyone struggling with `The Method.'  Fraser strikes a handsome, heroic pose-- call him a poor man's Indiana Jones-- and Weisz is becoming as Evelyn.  Most importantly, they all walk the walk and talk the talk, and Sommers keeps them on track and wisely avoids allowing any lapses into `camp' or tongue-in-cheek character interpretations, which makes this a solid, fun-filled, action-adventure movie that is what it is.	The supporting cast includes John Hannah (providing some comic relief as Jonathan Carnahan), Adewale Akinnuoye-Agbaje (Lock Nah), Freddie Boath (Alex O'Connell) and Obed Fehr (Ardeth Bay).  As with most sequels, you'll get more out of `The Mummy Returns' if you've seen the original, which had more of a story and, of course, would give you the background of the characters. But even on it's own and taken at face value, this movie is a feast for the senses, and just a lot of good fun.  Just don't go in expecting anything more than what the trailer promises; if you can do that, chances are you're going to enjoy the movie and have a good time.

Home Alone 2: Lost in New York," Macaulay Who?
","Since the early 80s, writer/producer (and sometime director) John Hughes has had his finger on the pulse of contemporary America.  Responsible for such films as `The Breakfast Club,' the wildly successful National Lampoon `Vacation' series (including `Christmas Vacation,' which to many has become a holiday staple, right up there with `A Christmas Carol' and `It's A Wonderful Life') and another favorite around Thanksgiving time, `Planes, Trains and Automobiles,' he nevertheless achieved his greatest commercial success when he came up with the idea of having a little boy getting inadvertently left behind when his family goes off for a Christmas vacation to Paris.  That, of course, was `Home Alone.'  But he didn't stop there. Some two years later that same little boy boards the wrong plane and ends up in New York City while his parents and the rest of his family go to Florida, in `Home Alone 2-- Lost In New York,' directed by Chris Columbus.	Once again the extended McCallister family is off for the Christmas holidays, and this time Kevin (Macaulay Culkin) winds up alone in New York. Luckily for him, however, he somehow manages to end up with his father's carry-on, which just happens to contain a credit card.  And by using the kind of ingenuity that would escape most adults, he successfully checks himself into the Plaza Hotel under his dad's name, whereupon he soon discovers room service.  He also discovers Duncan's Toy Store (to which he is transported in style via the Plaza's limo, complete with cheese pizza just for him), a pigeon lady (Brenda Fricker) in Central Park, and some old acquaintances from back home, Marv (Daniel Stern) and Harry (Joe Pesci), the `Wet Bandits' themselves, though now known (since breaking out of prison) as the `Sticky Bandits.'  Meanwhile, mom and dad (Catherine O'Hara and John Heard) are frantic in Florida when they arrive and realize that Kevin is once again gone missing.  And with that, the search is on.  Meanwhile, back in New York--	Opting to ride the `Home Alone' series out as writer/producer, Hughes placed the project in capable hands with director Columbus (who also directed the original `Home Alone,' and more recently the hugely successful `Harry Potter).  This one may not have been a stretch for him artistically, especially since the characters had been previously established in the first one, but comedy of any kind can be touchy, as it is such a purely subjective arena, and Columbus does a good job of keeping the story on track (for the most part) and moving it right along.  Wisely, the filmmakers chose to proceed on the assumption that everyone had seen `Home Alone,' and therefore waste little time setting things up.  Instead, they contrive to get Kevin posthaste to New York -- where the story really begins-- and even if you haven't seen the first one this will work for you, because this, as they say, isn't brain surgery.	Even so, it's a fairly uneven film.  There's a few laughs in the rush and flurry of getting Kevin to the Big Apple, but at that point Culkin is expected to carry the film, and quite frankly, left alone (no pun intended) it's a task for which he is simply not qualified.  He was veritably propelled to stardom when he played Kevin the first time around, but now-- two years later and two years older-- whatever `cuteness' or magic he may have had then is already noticeably starting to fade.  All that aside, however, the truth of the matter is he's just not that capable as an actor, paling in comparison to Haley Joel Osment or `Potter's' Daniel Radcliffe. Culkin's timing is poor and his reactions lack the spontaneity that would have made Kevin a bit more believable.  His whole presentation of the character just seems too forced; and the attitude he conveys is more caustic than cute, which certainly detracts from his credibility, as well.	Oscar winner (for `My Left Foot') Brenda Fricker has a dismally thankless role as the `Pigeon Lady' who connects with Kevin in the park.  With her character, Hughes and Columbus are obviously attempting to recapture the poignancy of the Culkin/Roberts Blossom `church' scene in the original (which worked very well); but Fricker's heavy-handed dramatics, combined with Culkin's aloof response to her, is almost too embarrassing to watch. And the sight of Fricker standing statue-like in the park while pigeons come to roost on her head and shoulders is neither comical nor touching, but ridiculous.  In Fricker's defense, it wasn't entirely her fault; she was simply given material that didn't work and a part that was a no-win situation from the beginning.	The only thing that really saves this picture at all is, without question, the slapstick antics of Marv and Harry.  When they at last engage in battle with Kevin (and you know it's coming), it's more violent than the Road Runner cartoons it emulates, but manages to produce some out-and-out, over-the-top, bona fide belly laughs.  Because-- forget everything else-- these two guys are dumber than a sackful of hammers, and Columbus successfully milks it for all it's worth and then some.  A warning to kids, though:  These buffoons are professionals; do not try this stuff at home.	The supporting cast includes Tim Curry (Concierge), Dana Ivey (Mrs. Stone), Rob Schneider (Cedrick), Devin Ratray (Buzz), Ralph Foody (Gangster Johnny), Kieran Culkin (Fuller), Eddie Bracken (Mr. Duncan) and Gerry Bamman (Uncle Frank).  Culkin may be the `star' of this show, but without the talent they surround him with, `Home Alone 2-- Lost In New York' would've had to be retitled `Lost at the Video Store,' with a shelf life of about two minutes before disappearing altogether.  As it is, thanks to some cunning maneuvers by the filmmakers, this one at least provides some passable entertainment and a few good laughs.  For a satisfying evening at the movies you could certainly do worse than this; but you could do much better, too.  I rate this one 5/10.",5,0,2,9 December 2001
From Hell," A Satisfying Consideration of the 'Ripper' Case
","The case of Jack the Ripper has long been, and continues to be, one of the great unsolved mysteries of all time, and as such has been the subject of numerous treatments in film.  Of them all, however, none has advanced a more logical or plausible theory in explanation of the who, whys and wherefores of the infamous serial killer than `From Hell,' directed by Albert Hughes and Allen Hughes, which attempts to solve the mystery that has by consensus long been deemed `unsolvable.'  But-- cinematically speaking, at any rate-- the Hughes Brothers make a decidedly solid case of it.It's 1888, London; in the Whitechapel district prostitutes are being systematically slaughtered in a precise and grisly manner.  Scotland Yard is at a loss to solve or stop the murders, and Inspector Fred Abberline (Johnny Depp) is assigned to investigate.  Abberline is somewhat unique in his approach, as he is invested with certain prescient abilities, which he enhances through the use of opium, laudanum and absinthe; not the usual methods employed by the police, but it does effect the desired results. 
Abberline discovers a link between the victims, and along the way becomes involved with one of the `girls,' Mary Kelly (Heather Graham), who may be in danger because of something she knows.  But as Abberline gets closer to a solution, he very well may be in danger also; he knows too much, and there is one, especially, who would find ease if he were to just disappear.  And by any means necessary.The proper atmosphere is, of course, a requirement if one is to tell this story convincingly, and the Hughes Brothers succeed nicely in this regard. But it would be hard to find a movie about the Ripper that did NOT achieve a proper mood; it's kind of a common link that ties all of the previous offerings together, up to and including this one.  This film differs from the rest in one important respect, however, and it's a big one-- that being the story itself.  Whereas the others are good at leading you down the path and taking you nowhere, the Hughes Brothers go out on a limb and actually deliver a satisfying ending, and moreover, one that solves the mystery. It's all speculation, of course, but this film will leave you feeling closer to the truth than ever before.  It's well crafted and executed, and they manage to keep the air fairly heavy with menace and suspense, from the beginning right up to the very end, which ultimately defines it as something of a `fable-noir.'Johnny Depp gives a solid, convincing performance as Abberline, who is something of the antithesis of another of his creations, Constable Ichabod Crane, of Tim Burton's `Sleepy Hollow.'  It's a challenge for an actor to take on two roles somewhat similar in nature to begin with, and successfully manage to make them quite the opposite of one another in the end, which is what Depp has done with these respective portrayals.  The events surrounding Crane may have been dark, but Ichabod was not; here, however, Deep finds a dark side of his character, Abberline, that is as enigmatic as the case with which he is dealing, and it is that to which Depp plays, approaching from the depths and looking up, rather than observing from a position of light, as he did in `Hollow.'  And it demonstrates that Depp is endowed with that same kind of chameleon-like quality that serves such actors as De Niro and Billy Bob Thornton so well; it's a matter of being able to transform oneself from the inside out, which comparably few actors can do with any real success.Heather Graham does a good job with her role of Mary; she's convincing for the most part, but there are moments when it's something of a challenge for the viewer to totally believe that she is a `lady of the night.'  Her appearance seems almost a bit too polished, especially compared to the other girls.  It's a minor complaint, however, as overall, though her performance may not necessarily be one of the strengths of the film, it certainly does nothing to detract from the effectiveness of it.The performance turned in by Ian Holm, on the other hand, is definitely one of the film's strengths.  As Sir William Gull, he is quite believable, with a probing portrayal that does much for the credibility of the story. 
Also helping things along substantially, are Robbie Coltrane (who has since become known, and will forever after be, `Harry Potter's' Hagrid), as Abberline's colleague, Peter Godley, and Susan Lynch (who previously gave such a remarkable performance as Nora Barnacle in `Nora,' opposite Ewan McGregor), as Liz Stride.The supporting cast includes Ian Richardson (Sir Charles Warren), Jason Flemyng (Netley), Katrin Cartlidge (Dark Annie), Terence Harvey (Ben Kidney), Paul Rhys (Dr. Ferral) and Lesley Sharp (Kate).  Arguably the best and, without question the most satisfying of all the `Ripper' movies, `From Hell' is a well made, graphic and thought provoking consideration of the Whitechapel killings, which for quite some time held all of London in the grip of fear and terror.  The conclusions offered here may just be as close to the truth as anyone will ever get; in the event that it is pure fiction, however,it is decidedly good fiction that makes for a couple of hours of riveting entertainment and speculation.  Be forewarned, this one is not going to be for everyone, as many of the mental, as well as visual images it presents are extremely disconcerting.  Definitely not for the squeamish, but for those who are so disposed, this one will prove to be quite an experience.  It's the magic of the movies.  I rate this one 8/10.",8,1,2,18 July 2002
Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone," The Magic Comes To Life!
","Once upon a time (and not that long ago), in the vivid, fertile imagination of author J.K. Rowling, a character was born:  A boy.  A young boy named Harry, who was destined to become one of the most beloved characters to emerge from a work of fiction in a long, long time, and was quickly embraced by young and old alike in all corners of the world.  And now, thanks to the magic of the cinema, Harry and his companions fairly leap from the pages of the novel to the silver screen in the phenomenal motion picture, `Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone,' directed by Chris Columbus and written for the screen by Steve Kloves.  Indeed, Harry Potter is a boy, but not just any boy; because Harry (Daniel Radcliffe) just happens to be a wizard.  But, orphaned as a baby, Harry has been raised by his Aunt Petunia (Fiona Shaw) and Uncle Vernon Dursley (Richard Griffiths), who never let him in on the fact that he was, well-- what he was.  It seems that Petunia didn't approve of her own sister-- Harry's mother-- because she was a witch; nor of Harry's father because he, too, was a wizard.  When Harry turns eleven, however, the secret is out of the bag when-- after some strange goings-on-- a giant of a man named Rubeus Hagrid (Robbie Coltrane) shows up at the Dursley's door to collect Harry and take him off to `Hogwarts,' a school for wizards and witches and all who would perfect the gift with which they were born:  The gift of magic!  And from the moment Harry boards the train (from station platform nine-and-three-quarters) that will take him to his destiny, the magic is alive-- for Harry, and for the audience, as well; and it's a journey you will never forget.	What a monumental undertaking to even think of attempting-- translating and transferring this passionately beloved work from novel to the screen. Because to millions of people, Harry and his companions are so much more than merely characters in a book; these are characters for whom people have made a special place in their hearts, which puts a great burden of trust upon the man who would attempt to bring them to life.  And Chris Columbus, it turns out, was the right man for the job.  More than rising to the occasion and with some magic of his own-- and a lot of help from an extraordinarily talented cast and crew-- Columbus has delivered a film that is not only true to the story, but true to the very spirit that makes Harry Potter so special.  The special effects are absolutely beyond astounding, and Columbus, with a keen eye for detail and without missing a beat, keeps it all on track and moving right along at a pace and with a sense of timing that makes this an absorbing, thoroughly entertaining and enjoyable experience from beginning to end.  From the opening frame you get the feeling that you're about to have a singular experience; and you're right. Because you've just entered the world of Harry Potter.  And it's magic.	Even having the best special effects do not a great movie make, however, and this film is no exception; what catapults this one to the top are the performances, beginning with Radcliffe, whom you quickly forget is an actor playing a part.  And that about sums up what kind of a job this young man does here.  Without question, he IS Harry Potter, physically and emotionally, and when he waves his wand and does what he does, you believe it.  A wonderful performance by a gifted actor who has a great career ahead of him; without question the perfect choice for the role of Harry.	Also turning in excellent performances are Rupert Grint as Ron Weasley, and Emma Watson as Hermione.  As with Radcliffe, the casting here could not have been more perfect.  Grint is `Everyboy,' with that special glint in his eye and a manner that makes him especially endearing.  And the spunky Watson adds some real sparkle to the film as Hermione, the one with the sense of urgency and the wherewithal to get things done; a real role model for young girls everywhere.	It's obvious that a lot of care went into the casting of this film, and it's a big part of why it is so successful.  Richard Harris, as Headmaster Albus Dumbledore; Maggie Smith as Professor McGonagall; John Hurt as Mr. Ollivander; Ian Hart as Professor Quirrell.  Exceptional performances from one and all, with two that stand out as especially memorable:  Robbie Coltrane, who readily conveys the fact that Hagrid's heart is of a size that matches that of the man; and Alan Rickman, as Professor Severus Snape, deliciously droll while demonstrating menace through the fine art of articulation.  	The additional supporting cast includes John Cleese (Nearly Headless Nick), Warwick Davis (Professor Flitwick), Julie Walters (Mrs. Weasley), Zoe Wanamaker (Madame Hooch), Tom Felton (Draco Malfoy), Harry Melling (Dudley) and David Bradley (Filch).  From Rowling's imagination to the written page to real life (albeit via the movie screen), `Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone' is a triumph many times over; a unique film of truly universal appeal, the likes of which is as rare as, well-- a sorcerer's stone.  A film in which adults and children alike will rejoice, because it speaks to the heart in a universal language of life, love, experience and imagination; a film that states unequivocally that magic exists-- as long as there's a single child with a single dream somewhere in the world, and real wizards like J.K. Rowling, Chris Columbus, Steve Kloves and every member of this wonderful cast and crew around to bring it to life as they have here.  An instant classic in every sense of the word, this is truly a film for the ages.  A remarkable achievement, this IS the magic of the movies.  I rate this one 10/10.",10,77,87,21 November 2001
The Untouchables," It's the Chicago Way
","In 1919, over the veto of President Wilson, the Volstead Act was passed, which made provisions for the enforcement of the Eighteenth Amendment, and successfully ushered in the era of Prohibition; what it did not do, was keep people from drinking, or more significantly, keep certain `businessmen' from selling it, which opened the flood gates to a billion dollar industry of illegal alcohol.  And in the larger cities, the mob bosses jumped onto the bandwagon with both feet, the most notorious of which was Al Capone, who by 1930 had a thriving business and the city and the people of Chicago in his pocket.  From the cop on the beat to the judges sitting on the highest courts, everyone seemingly had a price and could be bought.  And that's the way it was until Treasury Agent Eliot Ness showed up for work and hand picked a squad of honest cops to help him get Capone and clean up the City of Chicago.  `The Untouchables,' directed by Brian De Palma, is the story of Ness and his men, dubbed `Untouchable' because they couldn't be bought, though from the beginning the odds were stacked against them.  They were a handful against an army of hoodlums who wielded grenades and tommy guns, and they could trust no one outside of their own circle, not even the cops with whom they shared the streets.  Many looked upon what Ness was trying to do as an exercise in futility, but he never gave up, and went after Capone with everything he had, which wasn't much beyond his own guts and determination to `do some good.'	Ness's initial efforts were a disaster-- Capone had informants everywhere and always knew ahead of time whenever a raid was going down-- so he quickly realized that the only way to do this thing right was to get men he could trust and keep everything quiet.  The bureau responded by sending Ness (Kevin Costner) an accountant, Oscar Wallace (Charles Martin Smith), who first had the idea of going after Capone for income tax evasion.  Ness then recruited Jim Malone (Sean Connery), a veteran cop who walked a beat and was well versed in doing things `The Chicago way,' and George Stone (Andy Garcia) a crack shot recruited right out of the Police Academy. 
	Connery gives an exemplary performance as Malone (for which he received the Oscar for Best Supporting Actor), the tough, Irish cop who becomes something of a tutor to Ness, letting him know from the start what he's getting himself into.  How do you deal with someone of Capone's ilk?  According to Malone, `If he pulls a knife, you pull a gun.  If he sends one of yours to the hospital, you send one of his to the morgue.  That's the Chicago way-- that's how you get Capone.'  It's a perfect part for Connery, whose rugged appearance and demeanor are entirely convincing; he's got that somewhat cynical, world-wise and weary manner of a man who has seen it all, but lets you know that underneath he still holds out hope that some day in some way, right will win out after all.  And Connery plays it with a hard, uncompromising edge that makes it so believable, and makes Malone a memorable character. 														De Palma brings it all vividly to life, building an underlying tension from the beginning that he maintains throughout the film, aided by the intense, sometimes haunting score by Ennio Morricone.  Costner gives a solid performance as Ness, but he is somewhat overshadowed by the actors and the characters who surround him, especially Connery as Malone, and Robert De Niro, who as Capone is absolutely menacing and larger-than-life.  De Niro captures the ruthlessness that indelibly marked Capone's infamy forever in the annals of criminal history, with a portrayal of him that is arguably the best in cinematic history.  De Niro plays it as it lays, presenting Capone as the brutal criminal he was, without attempting to airbrush away any of the attributes that made him so despicable.  It's a terrific performance, for which he should have received at least an Oscar nomination.	The supporting cast includes Richard Bradford (Mike), Jack Kehoe (Payne), Brad Sullivan (George), Billy Drago (Nitti) and Patricia Clarkson (Ness' wife).  Extremely well crafted and delivered by De Palma, who had a great screenplay (by David Mamet) and a terrific cast with which to work, `The Untouchables' is a powerful, intense film that successfully evokes this particular period in the history of America.  And it subtly underscores the true heroics of men like Ness and his crew, who through their fearless dedication possibly made it a little safer for someone to walk down the street, or for an honest man to simply go about the business of making a living-- things too often taken for granted in our busy world today; things that are important, and which makes a film like this so much more than merely entertainment (though it definitely is that).  And that's the real magic of the movies.  I rate this one 9/10.",9,78,113,21 June 2001
Enemy at the Gates," 'Enemy' Doesn't Quite Make It To The 'Gates'
","In war, during a prolonged battle-- the outcome of which will be pivotal to the efforts of both sides-- death becomes a fact of life and the decline of morale among the troops follows in it's wake.  What better way, then, to bolster the spirits of those who must fight and die than by giving them a hero?  For once established, even if he is killed, the hero will have served his purpose, for the martyr is just as potent in death as the hero is in life.  In `Enemy At the Gates,' directed by Jean-Jacques Annaud, the Russians and Germans, in September of 1942, have reached an impasse during the siege of Stalingrad.  Casualties continue to mount on both sides and the Russians especially are beginning to feel the weight of what seems to be a futile effort, though this is the city that must not fall to the enemy at any cost.  When Khrushchev (Bob Hoskins) arrives to take charge and solicits ideas from his officers as to how they may turn the tide of the battle, a young political officer in charge of propaganda, Danilov (Joseph Fiennes) steps forward and proffers a hero, a soldier from among the ranks he knows to be a marksman of exceptional ability.  His name is Vasily Zaitsev (Jude Law), and with Danilov's newspaper touting his exploits, Vasily soon becomes the hero of the Russian people who rallies them to the cause.  Quickly aware of the situation, however, the Germans waste no time in bringing in a sharpshooter of their own, Major Konig (Ed Harris), specifically for the purpose of hunting down and eliminating Zaitsev.  And so, in the pitch of battle, the duel between the two becomes the focus of attention, the outcome of which will seemingly be viewed as victory or defeat by and for the armies of both sides. 													Early in the film, Annaud creates a sense of urgency and tension that promises to sweep you along to the climax, and the anticipation of an involving emotional experience at that point is high.  Unfortunately, even as the siege reaches an impasse, so does the film.  About half way through it all begins to sputter, and you begin to get the feeling that the promises made at the beginning will never be fulfilled.  And you're right. Failing to elicit the necessary emotional involvement from the audience, it finally stalls altogether and by the time you get to the end it seems almost anticlimactic.  Overall, the film suffers from it's own ambition; it attempts to be of a much larger scale and more profound than it really is. Annaud apparently intended to make a sweeping epic and an intimate, character driven film at the same time, but the formula for any success in the endeavor eluded him.  By interjecting and concentrating on too many elements involving the relationships between the characters, he minimizes the importance of the duel itself, and thereby diminishes the impact of it--especially the outcome-- that greatly affects the success of the film. Distracting as well is the fact that all of the Russians have class-distinctive British accents, which makes their credibility a bit hard to swallow. 													The high point of the film would have to be Jude Law's performance as the sniper, Vasily Zaitsev.  He manages enough emotional depth and lends a bearing to the character that make him believable, though there is one lapse near the end when during a particularly emotional scene he briefly slips into a such a `Cockney' dialect that it takes you out of the moment.  That one exception aside, it's a solid performance.  Ed Harris delivers a notable performance, as well, though far removed from the best work he's ever done.  Though he affects a fairly stoic countenance, he never quite achieves the enigmatic quality that would've made a dramatic impact as a counterpoint to Zaitsev's more overt humanness.  Rachel Weisz comports herself well as Tania, the woman who impacts the lives of Danilov and Vasily, but the role is far from challenging.  There is some chemistry between her and Law, however, and their scenes together create what little emotional apex there is to the film. 													Surprisingly, the low point of the film is the performance given by Joseph Fiennes, a terrific actor who was so outstanding in `Shakespeare In Love.'  Any depth of character he achieves here, as Danilov, seems feigned, and his whole delivery is simply too melodramatic to be entirely effective.  As the director, of course, Annaud is the one who must ultimately be held accountable for it.  And it illustrates just how much impact the expertise (or lack thereof) of the director can have on a film, for even the best actors must rely on the instincts of their director, as well as their own, to keep them on task. 													The supporting cast includes Ron Perlman (Koulikov), Gabriel Thomson (Sasha) and Eva Mattes (Mother Filipov).  Though based on a true story, and dealing with a significant historical event-- that being the battle of Stalingrad itself-- `Enemy At the Gates,' simply does not deliver what could have been an engrossing cinematic experience.  It's not a bad movie, by any means, and it certainly has it's moments; but in the final analysis, it's just another movie, and not a very memorable one at that.

A Beautiful Mind," A Beautiful Film
","As we go about our daily rituals and routines of living, in our own individual way, whether we are conscious of it or not, we are conforming to what we know to be the reality of our existence; a tangible, substantive reality we recognize, understand and trust.  And our senses provide the proof of that reality.  If we can see it, we can believe it-- which we do, and with good reason.  It's real.  But then again, what is `real' to one person isn't necessarily real to another, because there are instances in which an individual's `reality' exists only within the boundaries of his own mind, in a shadowland not unlike what many would think of as the Twilight Zone.  Only this place is not the creation of Rod Serling, but a very real place which exists-- with parameters set according to the individual-- within the mind of a schizophrenic.  And it is to that place that director Ron Howard takes us in `A Beautiful Mind,' starring Russell Crowe.	Crowe plays John Nash, a mathematical genius, who since the late forties has left his mark on such prestigious bastions of knowledge as MIT and Princeton, and whose `Equilibrium n-tuple' is perhaps the most important idea in noncooperative game theory ever conceived; equilibrium strategies being the things we predict about people.  It's not been an easy road for Nash, however.  As he himself puts it, he doesn't like people much; nor do they, in general, like him.  And it's made constructive social interaction something of a problem for him throughout his life.  Beginning as early as his student days at Princeton, he was noticeably `different,' not only in his relationships with others, but in the way he conducted his academic pursuits.  Even within his small group of friends-- fellow students-- he is a challenge.  He seems able to open up only to a select few:  His roommate, Charles (Paul Bettany), being the first and foremost, and later the somewhat mysterious Government agent, William Parcher (Ed Harris), whom Nash first encounters while involved in a project at the Pentagon, and eventually one of his students, Alicia (Jennifer Connelly).  Nevertheless, his future is filled with promise, but in the early Â‘50s, while doing some covert work for Parcher, the mental illness which will devastate his life becomes apparent, and his life takes an unexpected turn into that shadowland that will test the loyalty of even those who love him the most.	One of the reasons for Ron Howard's success as a director is that he understands human nature and has the ability to convey his insights to his audience.  He knows how to express the inner-most feelings of his characters in a way in which the viewer will be able to identify and relate.  And this film is no exception.  In bringing John Nash's story to the screen, he concentrates on the man, rather than the illness, and it's that which makes this such riveting drama.  While we get a glimpse of the physical horrors of schizophrenia, it's in witnessing the devastating and debilitating effects of it on Nash and those close to him that makes the film so emotionally involving.  Howard seems to be saying, this is a man's `life' we're dealing with, not just an academic case study; it's the humanity of the story that's important-- and that's exactly what he delivers.  He tells the story in a way that allows the viewer to empathize with Nash, as well as those around him, and he makes Nash a sympathetic character without resorting to any mawkish sentimentality.  Howard gives you Nash as he is, an individual of extraordinary ability, with achievements and problems to match, and presented within a framework that is very real and entirely effective.	As Nash, Russell Crowe once again demonstrates that he is so much more than just a celebrity or a `movie star,' but an actor in the truest and purest sense of the word.  When you can watch an actor doing a part and completely forget that what you're watching is a performance, you know the work is exceptional, which is exactly what Crowe is here.  The story follows Nash through a span of close to fifty years, and the aging process is presented seamlessly by Crowe, who takes his character from youth to old age quite naturally and so subtly, that as you're watching you don't even give it a thought until, at the end, you suddenly realize that you've just experienced a man's entire life.  Howard and some outstanding makeup work must take some of the credit, of course, but beyond that it's Crowe who sells it, who makes it so real and brings Nash so credibly to life.  It's a performance that has Oscar written all over it, and deservedly so.  	After a string of outstanding performances in a number of films (like `Requiem For A Dream' and `Waking the Dead'), Jennifer Connelly should finally receive some of the acclaim she is due with her portrayal of Alicia. Early in the film she effectively plays to her natural, dark beauty, but this is decidedly not a glamorous role, and as the story progresses Connelly successfully manages a much deeper expression of who her character really is and what she is made of.  It's an emotionally challenging role, and she certainly rises to the occasion.  And, like Crowe, she develops her character quite naturally, not only physically, but through a maturity of manner and perspective, as well.  It's a good piece of work, and if justice prevails she will receive the notice she deserves for it, because it's definitely one of the many strengths of the film.	The supporting cast includes Christopher Plummer (Dr. Rosen), Adam Goldberg (Sol), Vivien Cardone (Marcee), Judd Hirsch (Helinger) and Josh Lucas (Hansen) .  Thought provoking and emotionally stirring, `A Beautiful Mind' is, in the final analysis, a beautiful film, rich in it's humanity, and a journey that should not be missed.

Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets," With a Flick of the Magic Wand...
","The magic is back!  Harry, Hermione, and Ron Weasley return to the screen with yet another adventure, bigger and better than ever, as they begin their second year at Hogwarts.  With a veritable flick of his magic wand, director Chris Columbus offers up `Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets,' the second chapter in the on-going saga of everybody's favorite young wizard, who is joined this time around by a new instructor (teaching Defense Against the Dark Arts), as well as some formidable new opponents.  There's also a couple of surprises along the way as Harry encounters a rather singular character in his bedroom, and another deep in the Forbidden Forest.  And, yes, there IS a Quidditch match. Harry's second year at Hogwarts begins inauspiciously with a warning to stay away; someone-- or some'thing'-- doesn't want him there.  Harry (Daniel Radcliffe) is undeterred, of course, and is soon back in Gryffindor House along with his friends and fellow students.  But the warnings persist, now written in blood on the walls, and they portend an ominous fate for Harry, as well as many of the other students of witchcraft and wizardry.  The messages indicate that the `Chamber of Secrets' has been opened, and that dire consequences (for some unknown reason) are about to befall many of those in attendance at the school.  And this is serious business; enough to make Professor McGonagall (Maggie Smith) fear that Hogwarts may have to be closed indefinitely.So it's up to Harry, Hermione (Emma Watson) and Ron Weasley (Rupert Grint) to get to the bottom of the mystery.  And they don't have much time; already one of the students has been found literally `petrified' in the hall, and the perpetrator is still unknown and at large.  Harry knows the answers can be found in the Chamber of Secrets, but the questions persist:  `What' is it, exactly, and `where' can it be found?As if channeling the spirit and imagination of author J.K. Rowling (in whose heart Harry Potter was born), director Columbus brings this film vividly to life in a swirl of excitement and colorful characters.  He sets a perfect pace that will keep even the youngest members of the audience enthralled, and his transitions are impeccable, always moving the story forward with nary a single lull or hesitation.  It's a film that will grab you in the opening frames and sweep! you along to the finish. Written for the screen by Steven Kloves (adapted from the novel by Rowling), the story is compelling, the dialogue is fresh and crisp and, as expected, the special F/X are the absolute best.  And Columbus uses it all to great effect, aided in no small part by the exemplary work of film editor Peter Honess, the original score by William Ross and John Williams, Roger Pratt's brilliant cinematography, and last, but certainly not least, the engaging performances turned in by his young stars and veteran performers alike.Young Daniel Radcliffe's portrayal of Harry is so complete and natural that, simply put, he IS, and will forever be, `Harry Potter.'  It's the kind of definitive performance that will always, without question, be a part of Radcliff's life, putting him in such dignified company as Sean Connery (James Bond), Leonard Nimoy (Spock) and Basil Rathbone (Sherlock Holmes). And, for better or worse, that's not such a bad place to be.  He has a gift, and if he uses it wisely, he has a long and successful career ahead of him.The characters of Hermione and Ron Weasley are definitive, as well, but not in the way that Radcliffe's Harry is, but inasmuch as it would be impossible hereafter to accept anyone else but Watson and Grint as, respectively, Hermione and Ron.  Their portrayals are solid, endearing and entirely convincing; who will ever forget Hermione's adamant stare, or Ron's bemused expression of befuddlement?  Though without a doubt they will always be associated with these characters, they have the kind of talent that should take them successfully beyond their `Potter' personas.  And hopefully they will make choices in the future conducive to their auspicious `star-making' turns in these films.Kenneth Branagh gives a delightful performance as Gilderoy Lockhart, the new instructor at Hogwarts, whose self-importance has made him a legend in his own mind.  He is pompous and self-serving, but in a fun kind of way that allows you to see immediately beneath the mask of his vanity and his puffed up ego; he's the Wizard of Oz revealed as the man behind the curtain.  And Branagh plays him perfectly.In this chapter we're also introduced to Draco Malfoy's father, Lucius Malfoy, played with deliciously restrained malevolence by Jason Isaacs. After meeting Lucius, it's easy to see that Draco (Tom Felton) is an apple that didn't fall far from the tree.  Also turning in a memorable performance is Shirley Henderson, as the empathetic, disenfranchised ghost, Moaning Myrtle, doomed to forever roam the lavatory in which she met her untimely and premature demise.  With very little screen time, she manages to make a decided connection with the audience, which makes her an effective and integral part of the story.Reprising the roles they established and made their own in `Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone,' are Richard Harris (Dumbledore); Robbie Coltrane (Hagrid); Alan Rickman (Professor Severus Snape); Bonnie Wright (in an expanded role this time, as Ginny Weasley); Julie Walters (Mrs. Weasley); John Cleese (Nearly Headless Nick); Richard Griffiths (Uncle Vernon); Fiona Shaw (Aunt Petunia); and Harry Melling (Dudley).The additional supporting cast includes Toby Jones (extremely effective as the voice of Dobby, the House Elf), Christian Coulson (Tom Marvolo Riddle), Miriam Margolyes (Professor Sprout) and Sally Mortemore (Madam Pince).  Be forewarned, there's a scene in the Forbidden Forest that will absolutely make your skin crawl; but it's all a part of the fun, and by the final scene of `Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets,' you WILL, without a doubt, believe in magic.",10,0,0,11 November 2002
Psycho," Nobody Does It Better Than Hitchcock
","Throughout his long and illustrious career, director Alfred Hitchcock thrilled and captivated audiences everywhere, but never before or since as well as he did with the psychological chiller, `Psycho,' which introduced the cinematic world to a guy named Norman Bates.  And now-- forty years later-- even in an age of jaded, desensitized sensibilities, graphic horror and the likes of Hannibal Lecter and `American Psycho,' Hitchcock's masterpiece remains, even after repeated viewings, truly frightening and intrinsically disturbing.  Just as Ingmar Bergman did with his character of Karin in his landmark film, `Through A Glass, Darkly,' Hitchcock presents a character (Bates) at the psychological crossroads of his life, a pivotal juncture wherein he is required to make a conscious decision that will determine the course of the rest of his life:  Whether to reach for the light (and healing), or succumb to the voices beckoning to him from the dark, a place from which there will be no return.  Norman, however--like karin-- is incapable of making that decision, and ultimately must adhere to the resolution of the subconscious, which takes him past the point of no return and subsequently beyond the reach of any help forevermore.  The rest of the characters in the story-- Marion Crane, Lila, Sam Loomis, Arbogast-- are all mere pawns who happen to be in the wrong place at the wrong time and are forced by fate to help play out the drama of Norman's twisted existence. 	Janet Leigh gives a memorable performance as Marion, creating a character that was not only destined to go down in cinematic history, but one that would make women everywhere afraid to shower at a motel.  Vera Miles is effective as Marion's sister, Lila, and John Gavin gives credibility to Marion's lover, Sam Loomis.  Martin Balsam gives a solid performance as well, as Arbogast, the ill-fated Private Eye whose encounter with Norman's mother on the stairs is a scene nearly as famous as that of Marion's `shower.'   But the real star of the film is, of course, Anthony Perkins, who gives an Oscar worthy performance as Norman Bates, a character even more chilling than Hannibal Lecter, in that his outward appearance is so deceiving, so contrary to the evil dwelling behind his unintended facade of normalcy.  His gentle countenance and boyish charm are so `real' that after being exposed to him it forever after makes anyone and everyone you encounter in your own life suspect.  And Perkins plays him to perfection, in arguably the best (and definitely the most memorable) performance of his career. 	The supporting cast includes John McIntire (Sheriff Chambers), Simon Oakland (Dr. Richmond), Vaughn Taylor (George Lowery), Frank Albertson (Tom Cassidy), Lurene Tuttle (Mrs. Chambers), Patricia Hitchcock (Caroline), John Anderson (Charlie) and Mort Mills (Highway Patrolman).  If there was any doubt by the time this film was made, `Psycho' once and for all proved that Hitchcock was, indeed, the Master of Suspense.  There have been many imitators before and since, but all of them, good and bad alike, only serve to point out that nobody does it better than Hitchcock.

Ice Age," Iceberg Ahead!
","From the realm of digital animation, this is a film that is geared to the younger set, but one that most adults will find pleasantly entertaining, as well.  Heavy on visual humor, with a few one-liners thrown in for good measure, `Ice Age,' directed by Carlos Saldanha and Chris Wedge, is a fairly pedestrian, family comedy that is viewer friendly and has a heart as big as it's main character, who just happens to be a mammoth named Manfred.	It's the Ice Age, and the migration is on; but as the mammals begin to move, three very distinct individuals are about to be thrown together by circumstances of fate:  Manfred the Mammoth (Ray Romano) insists on going against the tide of the migration movement (literally), and it brings him in touch with Sid the Sloth (John Leguizamo), who awakens from his slothful slumber to find that he's been left behind by the other sloths.  Meanwhile, a pack of Sabertooth Tigers, led by the ruthless Soto (Goran Visnjic), is about to exact revenge on the humans, the hunters he feels are responsible for the decimation of his pack.  An attack is planned, with Soto especially intent on claiming a human baby as his prize.  But during the attack, one of Soto's pack, Diego (Denis Leary), fails to prevent the baby's mother from escaping with her child.  Outraged that the baby has escaped his grasp, Soto charges Diego with the task of locating the baby and bringing him back, alive.  What Diego does not know, however, is that the baby has ended up in the care of one of the most unlikely duos imaginable, Manfred and Sid, who have joined forces in an attempt to locate the humans and return the baby to it's herd.  When Diego realizes what has happened, he decides that his best shot at getting ahold of the baby is to join Manfred and Sid in their quest, which he does by convincing them that they need him-- a tracker by nature-- if they are to succeed in finding the humans, who are also on the move.  And so they begin their journey, with Manfred and Sid unaware of the treachery at hand, lying hidden in their very midst.	Unlike other prominent films of this genre, such as `Shrek,' or even `Monster's Inc.,' `Ice Age' is not terrifically clever or witty; nor does it try to be.  The strength of this film, in fact, lies in the very straightforward manner in which it is presented, and the filmmakers obviously made some very deliberate choices as to what they wanted to do with their film, and what exactly they wanted it to be.  Rather than go for the hip and hilarious, they chose warm and funny-- and it works.  There is some subtle humor, but for the most part the jokes are what they are; Saldanha and Wedge do not employ the double entendre, for example, so you don't have to go looking for what they're trying to say.  It's a matter of what you see is what you get.  	What they do give you are some engaging characters (especially Manfred and Sid) and a number of things that visually stimulate the funny bone, beginning with the hapless squirrel who mugs his way through the opening frames with a nut in tow (and who pops up occasionally throughout the film), whose bug-eyed looks and frantic antics are enough to start you chuckling and take you right on into some full-blown gales of laughter.  And it's all tempered so that it never goes too far over the top into `Road Runner' type slapstick, relying instead on some imaginative touches (such as the stages of evolution of the sloth preserved frozen in ice, with Sid falling into frieze briefly at the end of the tableau) and a basic story that's involving enough to sustain interest.	Anyone familiar with the TV show `Everybody Loves Raymond' will know what to expect as far as the Manfred character, whom Ray Romano infuses with the same wry persona as his Raymond TV character.  But Romano does it well, his Manfred is quite likable, and he even manages to create a couple of truly poignant moments with him.  Simply put, he gives you a mammoth to whom you can actually relate.  And that's a pretty good piece of acting.	As Sid, John Leguizamo gives a distinct voice to the film, creating a personality that definitely fits the wall-eyed looks of the sloth.  Like Romano, Leguizamo has a unique comedic style, and the contrast between the two works beautifully for their respective characters and the way in which they play off of one another.  And when you add Denis Leary to the mix-- which offers yet another distinct style of comedy (a bit more on the caustic side)-- the result is quite an interesting and diverse combination that in the end works extremely well.  It should be noted, too, that Leary is comparatively subdued with his character, while Leguizamo gives a stream-of-consciousness type performance, though he manages to stay just this side of Robin Williams territory (which is a positive within the context of this film and this particular character).  Most importantly, all three create characters that succeed in effectively telling the story, and they do it in a way that is not only inoffensive, but which enables the audience to embrace them, as well.	The supporting cast includes Jack Black (Zeke), Tara Strong (Roshan), Stephen Root (Rhino), Diedrich Bader (Saber-tooth Tiger) and Jane Krakowski (Jennifer the Sloth).  Entertaining, feel-good family fare, `Ice Age' is guaranteed to put a smile on your face and provide you with a satisfying cinematic experience.  And I dare not neglect to mention the educational significance of this film, too; I mean, where else are you going to find out what really happened to the Dodo Bird?  It's the magic of the movies.

The Bridge on the River Kwai," The Definitive Guinness Performance
","Within the Conflict that was World War II, there were many more smaller, more personal conflicts which, when added up, made a significant impact on the outcome of the War; though trying to explain them, or war in general, is like attempting to decipher the indecipherable.  In `The Bridge On the River Kwai,' director David Lean takes you deep into the Burmese jungle to examine some of these deeper conflicts, and the effects of extraordinary circumstances on some ordinary men:  British Colonel Nicholson (Alec Guinness) is a man of rigid principles and ideals, to whom acquiescence in any quarter is not an option; Japanese Colonel Saito (Sessue Hayakawa) lives by an inflexible code of conduct and is adamant in his adherence to it, through which he maintains his dignity and honor; American Navy Commander Shears (William Holden) just wants to make it through the war alive and get back home.  	As an integral part of their war effort, the Japanese have ordered a strategic bridge to be built across the Kwai River to facilitate the transport of troops and equipment.  This monumental task has been given to Saito, the commandant of an allied prisoners-of-war camp; and not only must he build it, it must be completed by a specific date.  And time is short. Toward that end, Saito has pressed into service every prisoner, including officers, whom according to the Geneva Convention of 1864 (which established rules for the humane treatment of prisoners of war), are to be excluded from any manual labor.  When a fresh contingent of British prisoners arrives to bolster his complement of workers, Saito finds himself up against a formidable opponent, Nicholson, who immediately informs Saito that his officers will not work, in accordance with the rules of the Geneva Convention.  And it's the beginning of another war-- a war of wills-- between two men determined to win at any cost.  To Saito, this is more than just another assignment, it's an obligation, and failure is not an option. If he does not succeed in having the bridge built-- and on time-- he will be forced to take his own life, in accordance with his own moral code. Nicholson, on the other hand, is unyielding to the point of madness, and will die before he accedes to Saito's demands.	Meanwhile Shears has managed by some miracle to escape and has made his way back to Ceylon.  And he's home free-- after some recuperation time at Mount Lavinia Hospital, he'll be on his way back to the states.  Or so he thinks. But unbeknownst to him, the British are aware of the bridge being built on the Kwai, and are planning a commando raid to destroy it.  And Shears has something they need:  First hand knowledge of the precise location, and of the jungle through which he made his miraculous escape.  Subsequently, the Navy agrees to `loan' Shears to the British, to aid them with their mission. So instead of a ticket home, Shears is faced with another arduous trek through an uncompromising jungle, all for a mission of which the odds against success are nearly incalculable.  	From the beginning of the film to it's spectacular climax, Lean builds and maintains a subtle tension that underscores the drama, which makes this a compelling, unforgettable motion picture.  Lean is the Master of epic films such as this, filling them with sweeping visuals while integrating them with the emotional involvement of his characters perfectly.  Lean knows what he wants and how to get it, and he takes a terrific story (and this definitely is one) and tells it by using every bit of space--visually and audibly-- at this disposal.  And most importantly, he knows how to get the kind of performances from his actors to put it all across so convincingly and believably.	Alec Guinness deservedly received the Oscar for Best Actor for his role of Nicholson, whom he embodies from the inside out, disappearing so utterly into the character that the actor is forgotten, leaving nothing but the real man in his stead.  It's a superlative piece of acting from one of the truly great actors of all times.  Holden, as well, delivers an outstanding performance as Shears, capturing that somewhat embittered, off-handed sarcasm and resignation of a man trapped by circumstances beyond his control, who nevertheless does what he can to make the most of it, while awaiting the first opportunity for escape that affords itself.  Holden's work here is Award-worthy, as well, but was destined to forever remain in the shadows of what is probably the definitive Guinness performance.  And what a rare treat, having two performances of this caliber in a single film.	Other notable performances include Hayakawa, entirely convincing as the tormented Saito, and Jack Hawkins, as demolition expert Major Warden, the absolute personification of the undaunted British stiff-upper-lip.	The supporting cast includes James Donald (Clipton), Geoffrey Horne (Joyce), Percy Herbert (Grogan), Ann Sears (Nurse) and Andre Morell (Green). Beautifully filmed and expertly crafted and delivered, `The Bridge On the River Kwai' is one of David Lean's masterpieces.  It's an emotionally involving, dramatic action/adventure that offers some real insight into the determination and tenacity of the human spirit.  This film (especially the ending) is one you will never forget; a classic in every sense of the word, it exemplifies the magic of the movies.  I rate this one 10/10.",10,130,167,9 June 2001
Bram Stoker's Dracula," An Artistically Rendered Tale Of Darkness
","The most famous vampire in the history of literature and film is brought graphically to life in `Bram Stoker's Dracula,' directed by Francis Ford Coppola, and starring Gary Oldman as the Count from Transylvania.  Working from a screenplay (by James Victor Hart) that is a faithful adaptation of the novel, Coppola takes an artistic approach to the material and creates some startling and effective images-- some quite intense and erotic-- to tell the story of Count Dracula and his world of the undead.  Unsettling at times, and often shocking, the film is mesmerizing and thoroughly engrossing, delivered with a full palette of colors and shadows that form a backdrop against which the characters so vividly emerge to play out the drama.  It's a visual and emotional feast that is satisfying in every respect, beginning with a brief history of Dracula and the circumstances of his life that ultimately allied him with the forces of darkness and evil. 	Initially, the casting of Gary Oldman as Dracula seemed inauspicious and ill advised; in retrospect, the choice of Oldman was inspired.  Though many actors have done the role before and since (Schreck, Lugosi and Lee, just to name a few), Oldman manages to make the character uniquely his own, with a nuanced performance infused with depth and acuity.  Even when delivering famous, oft quoted lines from previously filmed versions of the story (Lugosi's `Children of the night, what music they make,' for instance), Oldman makes them spontaneous and fresh, with a conversational tone that makes you feel as if you're hearing them for the first time.  His presence is self-assured and menacing, which makes the character strong and intimidating, and you sense his longevity and the dark wisdom afforded him by his many years of existence.  There is a fastidiousness about Oldman's methods of inhabiting a character that makes you wonder if there is anything as an actor that is beyond his grasp.  At this point, I would think not. 	As Van Helsing, Anthony Hopkins puts his personal stamp on a well known character as well.  His portrayal of the famous professor is zealous and lively, and touched with an eccentricity that makes him an interesting and welcome presence in the film.  Winona Ryder, too, gives a believable performance as Mina, a somewhat emotionally challenging role she addresses with the restraint demanded of her by the character.  With her dark, winsome looks and natural intensity she is perfect for the part, and displays a femininity that contrasts well with the overt sexuality of Dracula's three `brides.'  And Tom Waits gives a memorable performance as the mad, insect-eater, Renfield, as does Sadie Frost, as Lucy, Mina's young and nubile best friend who unwittingly falls prey to Dracula's dark powers.  The single member of the cast who seems to struggle a bit with characterization is Keanu Reeves, as Jonathan Harker; he gives a passable performance, but fails to ever get a firm grasp of the character.  Still, he has an engaging presence and, though lacking depth, his portrayal is at least credible enough to maintain the continuity of the film. 	The supporting cast includes Richard E. Grant (Dr. Seward), Cary Elwes (Lord Holmwood) and Bill Campbell (Quincey).  Exacting in detail and imaginatively rendered, Coppola's `Bram Stoker's Dracula,' is an impressive, memorable film.  By boldly juxtaposing images and shadows, embracing the innate sensuality of the vampire, and blending it all together so seamlessly, Coppola has taken his film, not only to the zenith of the horror genre, but beyond.  It's a journey into the regions beyond the known, wherein the forces of darkness thrive and survive; a cinematic experience you'll not soon forget, courtesy of Coppola, a superlative cast, and the magic of the movies.

Blow," A Tale As Old As Time
","The effects of lacking the fortitude and conscience to make the right choices in life are examined in `Blow,' directed by Ted Demme and starring Johnny Depp as George Jung, a young New Englander who decides early on that living week to week and barely being able to make ends meet is not the kind of life he wants.  George grew up in the 50s, in a decent, middle-class family, but was deeply affected by the fact that his father, Fred (Ray Liotta), worked his fingers to the bone as a plumber, sometimes fourteen hours a day, seven days a week, and it was never enough, especially for his mother, Ermine (Rachel Griffiths), who complained endlessly about not having enough money.  More than once she abandoned her family, only to be taken back every time upon her return by Fred, who adored her.  Then, in the late 60s, George, along with his childhood friend, Tuna (Ethan Suplee), moved to Southern California and quickly discovered the freedom of the beaches and a lifestyle conducive to his idea of paradise.  That `paradise' being anchored in the realization of the big, easy money to be made at the time selling marijuana; and for George, it was only the beginning, the on-ramp to the freeway that would ultimately take him to the top of his `profession,' and which was destined to define his life.  	It's a tale as old as time, the lesson of which is destined forever-- unfortunately-- to be ignored by those who seek the quick and easy road to wealth and happiness.  Courage, it has been said, has many faces; one kind earns soldiers and citizens medals for rising above imminent danger. Another can be defined as being able to decline the carrot of ill-gotten gains when it is dangled before you.  George lacked that kind of courage, and instead grabbed the promise it proffered with both hands, only to discover-- too late-- that it was empty indeed, and laced with unhappiness. It's a classic rags-to-riches-to-oblivion story, with a moral that will be embraced by those with the wisdom to build their house of brick instead of sticks and straw.	As George, Depp turns in a convincing, believable performance, portraying him as a misguided, rather than `bad' person.  You sense that George's naivete enabled him to take chances and enter an arena to which common sense would otherwise have dictated avoidance, and because of that you are able to sympathize somewhat with him.  Depp lends an innocence to the character in which you can find the kid next door, the good kid you grew up with and knew throughout your school years, and in retrospect, it would seem that George, a reasonably intelligent young man, simply made some very stupid decisions. And, as they say, the prisons are full of those just like him.  But the most telling indication of who George really is and what he could/should have been, comes through his relationship with his father.  And it is that which becomes the very core of the story.	As Fred Jung, Ray Liotta gives a poignant performance, presenting a very real person in a very real setting.  completely avoiding any kind of stereotype into which this character could easily have fallen, Liotta plays him with a depth that averts  sentimentality and makes the unconditional love he shows for his son entirely believable.  It's a direct and understated performance that so clearly defines the true character of the man, and it is in the scenes between Liotta and Depp that the true nature of George is revealed as well, in which you begin to understand that he was just an ordinary guy who got caught up in extraordinary circumstances of his own design.	The supporting cast includes Penelope Cruz (Mirtha), Franka Potente (Barbara), Paul Reubens (Derek Foreal), Jordi Molla (Diego), Cliff Curtis (Escobar) and Max Perlich (Dulli).  A cautionary tale for those who allow themselves to stray from the straight and narrow, the real impact of `Blow' is ultimately contained in the final frame of the film.  It is a still picture of the real George Jung; and to fully realize what his life has been about, you need look no further than into the eyes of the man in that photograph.

Shrek," So What Do You Say To A Big, Green Ogre?
","A fractured fairy tale if there ever was one, `Shrek,' directed by Andrew Adamson and Vicky Jenson, is a highly imaginative, animated comedy that has something in it for everyone.  It's funny, witty, at times gross, while at other times, poignant.  And there's plenty of humor for children of all ages, while the adult humor (with which it's loaded) is for the most part implied, so parents can rest easy sitting next to their eight-or-ten-year-old sons or daughters; there's nothing in this film that's going to cause any embarrassing moments, and the only question you're likely to hear when it's over is, `Can we see it again?'	When the local Monarch, Lord Farquaad (John Lithgow) decrees that his kingdom must be rid of all fairy tale creatures, he has them rounded up and deposited across the line, as it were, into a swamp that just happens to belong to a big green Ogre named Shrek (Mike Myers).  Much to his chagrin, as he happens to value his privacy above all else, Shrek soon finds himself bedeviled by a talking donkey (Eddie Murphy), as well as having his sensibilities assaulted by the hordes of fairy tale squatters who don't have a clue as to what to do next.  Quickly Shrek sees no recourse but to go to Farquaad himself and settle the matter without further ado.  And when they meet, the diminutive Farquaad strikes a bargain with Shrek; it seems that in order to become a real King, Farquaad must marry a Princess.  But his chosen one, Princess Fiona (Cameron Diaz), is currently being held captive in the highest tower of a castle guarded by a fierce dragon who has slain all that have attempted to rescue her.  If Shrek can successfully effect her release, Farquaad promises to restore his swamp and rid Shrek of the pesky fairy tale creatures encamped there.  The fearless Shrek agrees, and with the donkey in tow, sets off on his quest.	Besides the humor, the wide appeal of this movie is due in part to the many clever references to other movies, stories and cultural icons it incorporates so well into the story.  There's the fairy tale's themselves, of course, like `Snow White,' `Pinocchio' and `Cinderella;' and movies like `The Matrix,' as well as the cultural phenomenon of `Riverdance.'  There's a scene that fans of professional wrestling will get a hoot out of, and the scene involving Princess Fiona and Robin Hood and his dancing band of Merry Men is beyond hilarious.  There is some bathroom humor, as well, but it's fairly brief and inoffensive-- miles away from anything remotely resembling what you'd expect to find in the latest Jim Carrey movie. 
	The actors supplying the voices do a great job, especially Mike Myers who brings Shrek so vividly to life, complete with a Scottish accent.  Murphy has some great lines as the donkey and makes the most of them, and Cameron Diaz as Princess Fiona is perfect, as is Lithgow as Lord Farquaad.  Other notable voices are supplied by Vincent Cassel (Monsieur Hood), Kathleen Freeman (The Old Woman) and Conrad Vernon (Gingerbread Man).  The use of music in this film is exceptional, also.  A number of familiar, popular songs are integrated into the story and the action to great effect throughout, and repeatedly, the filmmakers seemed to have an innate sense of knowing just the right song to plug into any particular moment or scene.  As with virtually everything else about this movie, it all came together beautifully.  In the final analysis, `Shrek' is an innovative, entertaining movie for the whole family that is guaranteed to keep you laughing and smiling for a lot longer than the 89 minutes it's on the screen.  This one's going to have you chuckling for the rest of the day-- and beyond.  And it all comes down to one thing.  It's the magic of the movies.  I rate this one 9/10.",9,0,0,3 June 2001
Vanilla Sky," One of the Best of 2001
","How strange the human mind is; this center of activity wherein perceptions of reality are formed and stored, and in which one's view of the world hinges on the finely tuned functioning of the brain, this most delicate and intricate processor of all things sensory.  And how much do we really know of it's inner-workings, of it's depth or capacity?  What is it in the mind that allows us to discern between reality and a dream?  Or can we? Perhaps our sense of reality is no more than an impression of what we actually see, like looking at a painting by Monet, in which the vanilla sky of his vision becomes our reality.  It's a concept visited by filmmaker Cameron Crowe in his highly imaginative and consciousness-altering film, `Vanilla Sky,' starring Tom Cruise and Penelope Cruz.  At the age of thirty-three, David Aames (Cruise) inherits a publishing empire left to him by his father. His fifty-one percent controlling interest, however, has made him something of a marked man, as there are seven members of his board of directors, and each deems himself more worthy than the young Mr. Aames of the lion's share of the company.  And fueling the fires of discontent is their perception that David lacks the focus the job requires.Admittedly, David likes to play; still, he's in control of the business and does what he sees fit, whether the board (he refers to them as the `Seven Dwarfs') likes it or not, and no one has ever had the courage to challenge him directly.  But during a lavish birthday party in his honor, one of the corporate lawyers, Thomas Tipp (Timothy Spall) warns David that the seven are up to something behind his back.  At the time, however, it's the last thing on David's mind; he's been having a casual affair with a friend, Julie Gianni (Cameron Diaz), but even that moves to the back burner when he meets a woman at his party that he can't get out of his mind.  Her name is Sofia (Penelope Cruz), and after knowing her for only one night, she becomes a pivotal part of his life-- which is about to be turned upside down, as on the morning after his party he makes a decision that will change his life forever.  And he is about to learn that sometimes, there is simply no going back.Director Cameron Crowe has crafted and delivered much more than just another film with this one; far more than a movie, `Vanilla Sky' is a vision realized.  Beginning with the first images that appear on screen, he presents a visually stunning experience that is both viscerally and cerebrally affecting.  It's a mind-twisting mystery that will swallow you up and sweep you away; emotionally, it's a rush-- and it may leave you exhausted, because it requires some effort to stay with it.  But it's worth it.  Think `Memento' with a driving rock n' roll soundtrack and a vibrant assault of colors proffered by the stroke of an impressionist's brush. There's darkness and light, and sounds that pound and drive until you can feel the blood rushing through your veins and throbbing in your brain. And all played out on a landscape of virtual reality swirling beneath that ever expanding vanilla sky.  Simply put, this one's a real trip; it's exciting-- and it's a mind bender.As to the performances here, those who can't get past the mind-set of Tom Cruise as Maverick in `Top Gun,' or his Ethan Hunt in `Mission Impossible,' or those who perceive him only as a `movie star' rather than an actor, are going to have to think again in light of his work here.  Because as David Aames, Cruise gives the best performance of his career, one that should check any doubts as to his ability as an actor at the door.  He's made some interesting career choices the past few years, with films like `Magnolia' and `Eyes Wide Shut' merely warm-ups for the very real and complex character he creates here.  And give him credit, too, for taking on a role that dispels any sense of vanity; this is Cruise as you've never seen him before. `Jerry Maguire' earned him an Oscar nomination, and this one should, also-- as well as the admiration and acclaim of his peers.  Cruise is not just good in this movie, he is remarkable.Penelope Cruz turns in an outstanding, if not exceptional performance, as well, as Sofia, the woman of David's dreams.  There's an alluring innocence she brings to this role that works well for her character and makes her forthcoming and accessible, yet she lacks any hint of mystery that may have added that special `something extra' to the part.  But Crowe knows how to get the best out of his actors, and he certainly did with Cruz.He also knew what he was doing with Cameron Diaz, who is absolutely vibrant in the role of Julie.  She's never looked better, and fairly sizzles on screen.  But make no mistake, this is no `window-dressing' part, and Diaz delivers a complete package with this character.  The quality of her performance can be measured, in fact, in the impact she makes with rather limited screen time.  And it's the persona she integrates so fully with her innate beauty that makes Julie so unforgettable.  Overall, a terrific job by Diaz.The supporting cast includes Kurt Russell (Dr. McCabe), Jason Lee (Brian), Johnny Galecki (Peter), Armand Schultz (Dr. Pomerantz), Noah Taylor (Ed), Mel Thompson (`L.E.' Man), Jean Carol (Woman in New York) and John Fedevich (Silent Ed).  About half-way through, this one may have you questioning your own sense of reality; but rest assured, by the end of `Vanilla Sky' all will be revealed.  It's a reality-bender, to be sure, and a wild one; but this is exciting entertainment that offers a satisfying-- and unique-- experience, one you have to see to believe.  It's the essential, and absolute, magic of the movies.  10/10.",10,227,336,19 December 2001
Any Given Sunday," Stone Lowers The Bar
","It's not if you win or lose, it's how you play the game.  Football as a metaphor for life; you have to fight for every inch, on the field, as in life.  Or perhaps on the `playing' field that `is' life.  Take your pick, you get the idea; whatever you choose you can bet it's a concept director Oliver Stone apparently seems to think he originated in his over-long, self-indulgent miasma `Any Given Sunday,' starring Al Pacino, Cameron Diaz and Dennis Quaid.  A decent movie?  Yes.  Original?  No.  Stone pulls out every cliche in the book, twists it all like so much play dough to put his own spin on it and serves it up like so many hot dogs you can buy at the stadium while you watch his fictitious Miami Sharks play.  The recipe for this particular potpourri includes the quarterback willing to play-through-the-pain-for-the-team; the third-stringer whose success goes to his head; discrimination; locker room scene after locker room scene that play like, well, locker room scenes; players with names like `Madman,' `Beastman,' `J-Man,' `Shark' and `Cap;' a ruthless, young General Manager/owner who inherited the position from her father; the unethical team physician whose diagnoses of injured players coincide with the needs of the team; the young, ethical assistant team physician; and the legendary coach who just wants to inspire his team and win one more.  The title of this film could have been `Any Given Sports Film.' All of which may seem contradictory after stating that this is a `decent' film.  Perhaps.  But understand that by decent I mean that this movie was, if nothing else, a professional endeavor that was packaged and delivered in a way you would expect from the star-studded cast Stone assembled here. The problem lies with Stone, whose work on this project fairly rings of arrogance and self aggrandizement.  All of the aforementioned `potpourri' ingredients, for instance, are actually legitimate aspects of this story; but in Stone's hands the legitimate comes across as cliche, while any attempt at profundity seems merely pretentious.  His endless use of slow motion photography during the game sequences ultimately has a nullifying effect on the drama it is, I assume, meant to enhance; and it's a perfect example of the excesses he allowed himself that give this movie the sense of pretending to be something it is not.  It's a case of the artist who is too close to his work being given too much freedom, or in this case, enough rope with which to hang himself. Pacino is a star, always larger than life, with an incomparable screen presence from whom we've come to expect a certain quality of performance. And here, as Coach Tony D'Amato, he certainly does not disappoint.  That his character lacks originality is not his fault; it's the part he was given and he makes the most of it.  To his credit he keeps him interesting, even though this is a guy you've seen a number of times in just as many movies. Cameron Diaz does not fare as well; she simply was not given the time necessary to develop her character, Christina Pagniacci (The time was available, but Stone chose to use it for yet nine or ten more slow-mo close-ups of a hand reaching, reaching, reaching for a football prominently featuring the `Wilson' brand), and Dennis Quaid fell victim as well with his portrayal of Cap Rooney.  Jamie Foxx fared as well as anyone involved as third-string quarterback Willie Beamen, and there are some notable supporting performances from Lawrence Taylor (Shark), LL Cool J (J-Man) James Woods (Dr. Mandrake), Matthew Modine (Dr. Powers) and Ann-Margret (Margaret Pagniacci).  Charlton Heston, however, is wasted in a cameo as the Commissioner of the League. Some would say you do not necessarily have to like football to like this movie; that may be true.  Subjectively, I would say that to like this movie at all, you must approach it with very low expectations (and it certainly wouldn't hurt if you did like football).  As I see it, with `Any Given Sunday' Oliver Stone lowered the bar and allowed himself to step over the line, which is especially disappointing in light of the fact that this is the director who gave us such excellent, thought-provoking films as `Platoon,' `JFK,' and `Born On The Fourth Of July.'  And in the future, I'm sure he'll add more titles to that list; unfortunately, this film will not be one of them.  I rate this one 4/10.",4,0,0,4 January 2001
Trainspotting," Tough Film To Watch
","The effect of heroin addiction on a young man and his closest friends is explored in the hard-hitting drama, `Trainspotting,' directed by Danny Boyle.  Set in Scotland, Ewan McGregor stars as Renton, a young man to whom drugs have become a way of life; in fact, more than a `way of' life, they have `become' his life.  And a more filthy, degrading lifestyle one would be hard put to imagine.  Renton has arrived at a point wherein absolutely nothing means anything to him:  Family, friends, job, nothing.  All that matters is the next fix.  And to get it, he will do whatever it takes, including robbing, stealing or even betraying his mates.  It's a hard life, but to `Rents' the high-- even with the total loss of self esteem-- makes it all worth it; and he'll get it any way he can:  Snorting, shooting up or using suppositories.  Eventually, however, Renton's bad life gets even worse, and as he emerges on morning from has drug-induced haze, he realizes things are going to have to change.  The question is, can he do it?  Or will he even want to. 	The film is a hard look at the depths to which an addict will descend and what one will do to get that fix.  To illustrate the point, there is one graphic scene (almost too hard to watch), in which Renton, losing a couple of suppositories (they had yet to melt) through a sudden act of nature, proceeds upon realizing it to turn around and fish for them in the `filthiest toilet in Scotland.'  The scene is almost unbearable, but what an example of what it means to be in thrall to drugs.  In another scene, not quite as graphic but powerful nonetheless, Renton's parents lock him in his room and he is forced to go `cold turkey.'  And although, after the aforementioned scene this is a bit easier to watch, it is still unpleasant, but delivers a succinct message about the nature of drug addiction.	 	McGregor is well cast as Renton, as he brings a clean-cut look to the part that seems so contradictory to the lifestyle embraced by the character.  The perfect choice of all the characters through which to tell the story, Renton has a look and an attitude that convey a life that holds such promise; here is a lad with a future.  And therein lies a message in itself:  When drugs are involved, never judge a book by it's cover, for addiction is never discerning.  Most importantly, McGregor's performance is believable and he has a charismatic screen presence that makes Renton someone with whom the audience will readily be able to identify, which is necessary for the film to work.  Without that connection, much of the message of this film would be lost, but thanks to McGregor, as well as some bold moments courtesy of director Boyle, it is not. 	The supporting cast includes Ewen Bremmer (Spud), Jonny Lee Miller (Sick Boy), Kevin McKidd (Tommy), Robert Carlyle (Begbie), Kelly Macdonald (Diane) and Peter Mullan (Swanney).  One of the best anti-drug films in memory, `Trainspotting' will affect even the most jaded abuser of controlled substances, for it puts the situation into perspective and gives it context, while keeping it at (still an uncomfortable) arm's length.  It may be tough to watch, but there are lessons to be learned from it that are invaluable. A great companion feature to the more recent `Traffic,' this is a film that will no doubt have a dramatic affect on those who see it, for the images it presents will not easily be forgotten. And if this film will save even one person from learning about drugs the hard way, then it will have made the endeavor entirely worthwhile.  Be advised, this film is more educational than entertaining, and definitely an experience.  I rate this one 8/10.",8,0,0,12 March 2001
Signs," Shyamalan Does It Again
","In his most pensive and thought-provoking film yet, writer/director M. Night Shyamalan examines personal faith and explores the possibilities of predestination, in `Signs,' a riveting drama/thriller that also makes a case for the existence of extraterrestrial life in the universe; a film that questions the validity of coincidence, and puts forth the proposition that there is more going on in the vast expanses that surround our world than meets the eye.  It's Shyamalan's way of saying `We are not alone,' and he does it by whispering it in your ear rather than shouting to get your attention.  And get your attention he does, without question-- in a way that is spellbinding and unforgettable.Graham Hess (Mel Gibson), of Bucks County, Pennsylvania, awakens one morning and discovers a design, beginning with a huge circle, that has been inexplicably imprinted in the cornfield that surrounds his farm.  And he soon finds out that this is not an isolated incident; indeed, overnight the same thing has happened in fields around the world.  The burning question, of course, is who did it?  And moreover, how-- and why?  It's a mystery to which there seems to be no logical answer.  Or is it that it's too obvious, in which case it is also unbelievable.  These are questions that, over the course of the next few days, will fill every waking moment of Graham's life, as well as that of his two children, Morgan and Bo (Rory Culkin, Abigail Breslin), and his brother, Merrill (Joaquin Phoenix); questions about things beyond contemplation.  Questions to which the answers can come none to soon.After his remarkable film, `The Sixth Sense,' in 1999, the question everyone was asking was how is Shyamalan going to top that?  He responded with `Unbreakable' in 2000, another remarkable film that presented a concept of evil unique in the history of the cinema.  And with this film, Shyamalan has done it again, with another unique film that is a study in subtlety and nuance.  There is a quiet intensity to this film that evokes the kind of silence in a crowed theater that is rarely encountered.  From the opening moments, Shyamalan casts a spell over his audience, then maintains it as he continues to build the suspense, right up to the very end.  He draws you in by getting up close and personal with his camera, which successfully puts you `in the room' as the drama unfolds.  It's a studied presentation, and Shyamalan sets a decidedly deliberate pace that makes it work most effectively.Shyamalan traverses territory that will be familiar to Ingmar Bergman aficionados, as he delves into one of Bergman's favorite themes, that being `God's silence,' which we find in Graham's ruminations of his own personal situation.  Add to that the best elements found in such films as `Independence Day' and `War of the Worlds,' with a dash of Rod Serling's `Twilight Zone,' and you have `Signs,' a true original, unique in it's own right and artistically and imaginatively rendered by Shyamalan, a one-of-a-kind writer/director who continues to amaze with film after film. Few directors can transfix an audience with such things as the sound of a cornfield rustling in the wind like Shyamalan can.  And he allows his scenes time to not only develop, but imply; and it's these moments of silence, in which he focuses on a doorway, or an empty swing in the yard viewed through an open window, or an intimate close-up of the expression on a character's face, that are so telling and entirely captivating.As Graham Hess, Mel Gibson certainly hits his stride with his portrayal of a man who has come to a crossroads in his life only to encounter yet another challenge that exacerbates his inner conflict even more.  Gibson has a commanding presence on screen that naturally draws the eye, and his performance here has a reserve that adds strength and depth to his character, who is dealing with some very complex issues that transcend his immediate considerations.  To make this character (and the film) work, Gibson must convey a very real sense of personal loss and a need for redemption-- and he succeeds.  Shyamalan obviously has a knack for tapping into and bringing out the best in his stars; he did it with Bruce Willis in `The Sixth Sense' and `Unbreakable,' and he does it with Gibson here.  It's an honest portrayal that is very real, and altogether convincing.Joaquin Phoenix, too, gives a grounded performance as Merrill, a young man who has seemingly come to terms with certain aspects of his past, as well as the circumstances that have brought him to where he is at present.  The success of his portrayal comes from the fact that Phoenix manages to find the core of his character and play upon it.  It's a matter of having the kind of focus that makes the character believable, which is what Phoenix achieves here.  He also has the kind of chemistry with Gibson that makes their relationship as brothers credible, which, in turn, is essential to the overall credibility of the film.Shyamalan has also worked his magic with his young stars, Culkin and Breslin, each of whom give affecting performances.  Culkin displays a maturity beyond his years that works well for his character, especially in light of Morgan's current fragile state of being.  And Breslin is absolutely endearing as Mo, a performance reminiscent of young Heather O'Rourke's Carol Anne, in `Poltergeist.'The supporting cast includes Cherry Jones (Officer Paski), Patricia Kalember (Colleen Hess), Jose L. Rodriguez (Radio Host) and M. Night Shyamalan (Ray). A film that is intrinsically enthralling, at times frightening and genuinely eerie, `Signs' marks the accomplishment of a cinematic hat trick for M. Night Shyamalan, who is quickly becoming the new Hitchcock/Rod Serling of film, yet with his own unique signature.  This makes three `originals' in a row for Shyamalan, a rare feat even among the greatest directors.  The question now is, how is he ever going to top it?  10/10.",10,0,2,4 August 2002
Sweet and Lowdown," Inspired Presentation, Performances
","Throughout history, especially when the world was a much bigger place, before the time that whenever a `celebrity' sneezed it was front page tabloid news, how many truly great artists-- those of genius, even-- went unknown, unheralded and unrecognized to the end?  Perhaps there was another Monet in our midst who, for whatever reason, was never noticed; who can say with any certainty there was not, or is not?  It's a consideration writer/director Woody Allen examines in his often humorous, and more often poignant, `Sweet and Lowdown,' starring Sean Penn and Samantha Morton.  In it, Allen chronicles the life of the fictitious Emmet Ray (Penn), who just may have been the second greatest guitar player in the world during the 30s.	Allen employs the effective (in his hands) storytelling device of `interviews' with those who knew Ray in one capacity or another, to fill in the gaps as he attempts to draw a picture of this talented genius, about whom very little is really known.  Only a handful of recordings-- made during the final years-- remain of who and what Ray is, or was.  The portrait that comes into focus is that of a man, who though gifted as a musician, had a bit more trouble when it came to living his day to day life. Self-centered, irresponsible and taken to drink, he was something of a lowdown character.  Then, one day in Atlantic City, Ray meets a sweet, young girl, Hattie (Morton), and they begin a relationship of sorts.  The problem is, Ray is a self professed free spirit, an artist, who goes where he wants and does what he wants.  Not exactly conducive to a sold relationship.  But inbetween, there's the music; and, as Ray himself will tell anyone who will listen, he's the best guitar player in the world, with the possible exception of this `gypsy in France, `-- Django Reinhardt.  And so, for your consideration, this is Emmet Ray-- the story of the man, and the woman who loved him.	Told in his inimitable, signature style, Allen presents his fiction in humanistic terms that bring Emmet Ray and his times to life in transporting fashion.  He successfully captures the essence and ambience of the era, just as he did with `Radio Days,' in 1987.  This time period-- circa 1930-- is something of Allen's forte, in fact.  Few contemporary directors in even fewer films have managed to depict it so vividly and believably as Allen has here.  Through Ray, he takes you into the life itself, behind the scenes, as it were, and gives you a real sense of what these times were all about. And, in conjunction with the interviews that lead to the flash-backs, it makes Ray seem as real as any figure in history you'd come to know through the respective media of film or print.  The story is engaging and devoid of pretense, and Allen tempers his own ego and presents it in a way that makes this one, arguably, one of his best films.	Penn, who should have won an Oscar for his work in `Dead Man Walking,' received a Best Actor nomination for his portrayal of Emmet Ray, and deservedly so, though he was edged out by Kevin Spacey, who received the award for `American Beauty' that year (Russell Crowe was also in the running for `The Insider'-- quite a year!).  There were no losers that year, however (as they say), as-- the award business aside-- Penn's performance is one of the most affecting of his career.  The Ray he presents is a total, well-rounded and three-dimensional character.  Watching him is like seeing the history of someone unfold before your eyes; not an actor, but a very real person, complete with every detail and flaw of his day to day existence.  It's terrific work that, with Allen's guidance, immerses you totally in the story and in Ray's life.	As Hattie, Samantha Morton is like the second coming of Giulietta Masina; like Fellini's wife and star, she is wonderfully expressive and able to convey so much with a movement of her eyes or just a glance, so reminiscent of Masina's Gelsomina in `La Strada.'  And though outwardly Hattie is fairly reserved, Morton leaves no doubt that within her there is need and desire, but with little expectation.  This is a young woman who is vulnerable and has known pain; someone with whom you readily empathize. When she hooks up with Ray, it quickly becomes a matter of concern, because you care for Hattie, and from the outset you realize that this relationship is going to be fragile, at best.  It's an inspired performance that landed Morton a nomination for Best Supporting Actress-- and she certainly deserved it (ultimately, it went to Angelina Jolie for `Girl, Interrupted').	Uma Thurman turns in a memorable performance, as well, as Blanche, a writer who crosses paths with Ray and has a significant impact on his life. Thurman makes Blanche credible, and she looks amazing, too.  The `'30s' look suits her extremely well, and cinematographer Zhao Fei (who did a magnificent job with this entire film) captures her best angles and achieves what just may be the best presentation of Thurman in any film yet.  It's a supporting, but pivotal role, and Thurman does it quite well.	The supporting cast includes Anthony LaPaglia (Al Torrio), Dan Moran (Boss), Brian Markinson (Bill Shields), Tony Darrow (Ben), Gretchen Mol (Ellie), John Waters (Mr. Haynes), Brad Garrett (Joe Bedloe), Carolyn Saxon (Phyliss) and Molly Price (Ann).  When Woody Allen is `on,' his films are insightful and entertaining, and while subtle, are vibrantly alive.  All of which is the case with `Sweet and Lowdown,' in which he demonstrates-- his own personal neuroses notwithstanding-- his grasp and understanding of human nature-- what it is that underneath it all really makes people tick.  He's no Ingmar Bergman, but at his best, he's at least a reasonable facsimile. And this IS on of his best.  It's the magic of the movies.  9/10.",9,0,0,22 January 2002
The Producers," Laugh-Out-Loud Funny Stuff
","How can a Broadway producer who has seen his day really make a lot of money? Leave it to writer/director Mel Brooks to answer that, and answer it he does in the uproarious comedy `The Producers.'  Zero Mostel stars as the producer in question, one Max Bialystock, with Gene Wilder co-starring as Leo Bloom, the meek accountant who steers Max onto the path to instant riches with a scheme that (in Max's hands) simply can't fail.  With Leo on board as his new partner, Max embarks upon a search for the perfect script, the first step of the plan that will lead them to the pot of gold at the end of the Great White Way.  And with Brooks at the helm, it's the beginning of a laugh-filled movie that gets funnier every time you see it. 	Mostel is perfect as the unflappable Max, the charlatan who woos a string of old ladies into becoming investors in his show; his personality and countenance match the broad approach Brooks takes with his comedy, and it's a fit made in comedic heaven.  Wilder, however, nearly steals the show with his terrific, definitive `long' takes and sideward glances that have served him so well during his career.  Here, in one of his first screen appearances, he works it perfectly, creating just the right counter-balance to Mostel's boldness, and it makes Leo a truly memorable character. Visually, there is enough in this film to generate plenty of laughs, but that it's delivered with wonderfully witty and clever dialogue as well (the screenplay earned Brooks an Oscar), makes it a true classic in anybody's book. 	Also unforgettable here are Kenneth Mars, as Franz Liebkind, author of the play that Max and Leo undertake to produce; Christopher Hewett, as Roger De Bris; and especially Dick Shawn, as Lorenzo Saint DuBois (`L.S.D.' to his friends), who becomes the star of Max and Leo's production.  Rounding out the great supporting cast are Estelle Winwood (`Hold me, touch me' old lady), Lee Meredith (Ulla), Renee Taylor (Eva Braun), Andreas Voutsinas (Carmen Giya), and William Hickey (Good Natured Inebriate). 	`The Producers' is every bit as funny now as when it debuted in 1968, maybe even funnier; it proves that good comedy is timeless, and this is comedy at it's best.  This is a must-see, not only for Mel Brooks' fans, but for anyone who just likes lots of good laughs.  Believe me, this is one funny movie you're going to want to see again and again.

The Matrix," Transcends Genre Or Category
","(What is the Matrix).  In 1977, George Lucas changed the landscape of cinematic Science Fiction forever with `Star Wars,' taking the genre light years ahead of all that preceded it.  Such a momentous advancement would not be seen again for over twenty years, when, in 1999, the Wachowski Brothers raised the bar again, taking the genre at warp speed  to an unprecedented level with their astoundingly innovative film, `The Matrix.'  Co-directed, written and produced by Larry and Andy Wachowski, it is an allegory of salvation and redemption filled with symbolism and metaphor (the Biblical references alone should keep theology students debating this one for years to come); a thinking man's action film, accentuated with moments that are no less than profound.  In a world of the future, things are literally not what they seem, where it's Man versus Machine, Reality versus Fantasy, and few who know the truth; among those who do, is Morpheus (Laurence Fishburne), who has long awaited the arrival of `The One,' who it has been prophesied will be the salvation of the world.  Enter Neo (Keanu Reeves), a computer programmer with an innate sense of discrepancy as to the state of things around him; he has questions, most of which are still in the process of being formulated in his own mind.  (What is the Matrix).  Morpheus has answers.  And when they meet, it's Alice down the rabbit hole, and Neo's life is changed forever. 	Reeves is perfectly cast as Neo, the enigmatic young man who may or may not be `The One,' and it's one of the best roles of his career.  He conveys a sense of removed, distracted urgency that defines his character, infusing him with both a strength and vulnerability that coalesces as the story progresses into determination and confidence.  The underplayed, subtle character development (largely unacknowledged and under appreciated) is a nice piece of work by Reeves.  As Morpheus, Fishburne is dynamic; he endows him with a quiet intensity that fairly roils beneath the surface, effectively restrained while leaving no doubt as to the character's power and purpose.  You understand his resolution completely by his countenance alone; by the way he speaks and carries himself.  It's a memorable performance by one of the truly gifted actors of our times.  (What is the Matrix).  Other notable performances include those by Hugo Weaving (Agent Smith), who brings a formidable, white-collar sinisterness to his character that is chilling; Carrie-Anne Moss (Trinity), a strong, vital presence throughout the film; and Joe Pantoliano (Cypher), who is entirely convincing in his role of a Cyber-age Judas. 	Rounding out the terrific supporting cast are Gloria Foster (Oracle), Marcus Chong (Tank), Julian Arahanga (Apoc), Matt Doran (Mouse), Belinda McClory (Switch) and Ray Anthony Parker (Dozer).  A visually stunning, thought provoking, captivating film, `The matrix' is a triumph of movie-making that assures the Wachowski's a permanent place in cinematic history.  The special effects are cutting-edge, state-of-the-art; the choreography of the action sequences is top rate and delivered with a style and effectiveness worthy of comparison to John Woo's best; and, most importantly, the story itself is complex, intelligent, and deftly takes you into regions beyond the known.  This is Science Fiction at it's best, but beyond that, it's a great movie that transcends genre or category; a landmark film that must be experienced more than once, for new meaning is gleaned with every viewing.  Enhanced by a driving soundtrack that completes the package, highlighted by incredible action,outstanding performances and memorable scenes to numerous to mention, this is a movie that absolutely must not be missed.

Heat," Mann Delivers Real 'Heat'
","Two men, each a consummate professional in his respective field-- but on opposite sides of the law-- become adversaries in a high-stakes cat and mouse game from which only one can emerge victorious, in the action/drama `Heat,' directed by Michael Mann and starring Robert De Niro and Al Pacino. Neil McCauley (De Niro) is a professional criminal who makes his living by `Taking down scores;' it's all he knows, and what he does best.  Vincent Hanna (Pacino) is a Detective with the L.A.P.D. whose main reason for `being' is to stop guys like McCauley from doing what they do best.  It's what `he' does best.  And when circumstances put them together on the same playing field, it becomes a battle of wits and tenacity, a matter of who will outwit whom and when; for each man is adamant in intent, and it becomes clear early on that neither will ever acquiesce, withdraw or concede the game to his opponent.  McCauley lives by a code that allows him to walk away if he knows the heat is around the corner, but only to another space on the same board; and Hanna owns the board.  What follows is an intense study in the dynamics of uncompromising conviction; and the tension begins with the opening sequence and continues to build throughout the film, right up to the very end. 	In McCauley, De Niro has created a character that is more than just a bit disconcerting; a hardened criminal, ready to kill-- indiscriminately-- at the drop of a hat, anyone who gets in his way, but with an outward appearance that belies his true nature.  This guy is anybody's next door neighbor; the software salesman or the manager of the local A&P who would blend in with the crowd anywhere because he is so nondescript.  A man whose life is a ruse, hiding his psychotic, sociopathic instincts behind a facade of normalcy.  And De Niro plays him with such integrity that it makes him one of the more terrifying characters he's ever brought to the screen, not because of what he seems to be, but because of what you know he is capable of.  His portrayal of Max Cady in `Cape Fear' was, by comparison, the outward expression of what McCauley is underneath, and which he conceals so well; With Cady at least you could discern the evil of the man just by looking at him-- a man the likes of which you would cross the street to avoid if you saw him coming.  McCauley is the one you would invite in, never suspecting the truth.  And that is what makes him such a powerful character. 		Pacino's Hanna, on the other hand, is the exact opposite.  He's boisterous, loud, and in all ways larger than life; he swaggers and intimidates.  And why?  Because it gets results. The manner he affects gives him the presence he needs to ferret out the criminal element and to keep them in line; if someone chooses to play in his court, they're going to know he's there, and he's not going to let them forget it.  It's his turf, his rules, end of story.  It's a purposefully over-the-top performance, because that's who Hanna is, or at least that's the face he puts on for the job. Underneath he's just a man looking for a little peace in his life, a part of his own personal puzzle that has so far eluded him, in no small part due to the dedication he brings to his work.  The necessity of dealing with reality at the level he must day in and day out is simply not conducive with the ability to leave the job at the door when the shift is over.  For a man like Hanna, the shift is never over.  And the fact that McCauley-- at the other end of the spectrum-- is made of the same cloth, is what gives this film such explosive intensity. 	The exemplary supporting cast includes Val Kilmer (Chris), Jon Voight (Nate), Tom Sizemore (Michael), Diane Venora (Justine Hanna), Amy Brenneman (Eady), Ashley Judd (Charlene), Natalie Portman (Lauren), Hank Azaria (Alan) and Kevin Gage (Waingro).  `Heat' is a hard-hitting, memorable film, impeccably directed and delivered by Mann; an entertaining and action-packed character study with an adrenaline rush that never lets you off the hook for a moment.  And how great to see De Niro and Pacino together; that alone is worth the price of admission.  If you're ready for some excitement, check this one out; it'll take you to the edge and keep you there, and by the time it's over you'll be ready for more of the same-- and that is what movies are all about.  That is the magic.  I rate this one 10/10.",10,1,2,31 December 2000
The Replacements," Keanu Scores Big Time
","When professional football players go on strike, the owners decide to continue on with the season by putting together teams made up of the best players they can find.  The owner of the Seattle franchise, O'Neil (Jack Warden), hires former coach McGinty (Gene Hackman) to take charge and field a team that can take them to the playoffs which, with four games left, is within their grasp.  `The Replacements,' directed by Howard Deutch, are guys whose careers had been cut short or sidelined for one reason or another, and now because of the strike are given a rare opportunity in the life of an athlete:  A second chance.  But it's more than just a shot at the brass ring; it's a chance to heal, to shed the stigma of loss, failure and disappointment they've all carried with them, in one way or another, since their playing days abruptly and prematurely ended.  For quarterback Shane Falco (Keanu Reeves), it's being able to shake the memory of a grueling forty-five point defeat in the Sugar Bowl, which has seemingly defined him since, plaguing him even during his very brief pro career.	Reeves does a great job with Falco, convincingly conveying the discontent lying buried beneath the surface of this man who has had to move on with his life, though unable to tie up the loose ends with which he obviously has yet to come to terms.  And it's that lack of closure, that intangible feeling clinging on to his soul that makes Falco such a strong character; there's something in his situation that most people have experienced, to one degree or another, whether it's a sense of failure or alienation one may have suffered, that makes him someone with whom you can readily identify.  It's what lies at the core of the story, and through Reeves' performance and Deutch's direction it becomes easily accessible, and it's one of the strengths of the film.  This movie, after all, is about so much more than football; it's about character and spirit and, as McGinty says at one point, heart.  And that's what makes these guys play like there is no tomorrow. Because for them there is no tomorrow; once the strike is over, who knows what will happen?  For now they have today, and for many of them just being shuck of `yesterday' is enough to give them new life. 	Especially memorable in supporting roles are Jon Favreau (Bateman), Rhys Ifans (Gruff), Orlando Jones (Franklin) and Brooke Langton (Annabelle). Rounding out the cast are Brett Cullen (Martel), Faizon Love (J. Jackson), Michael Taliferro (A. Jackson) and Ace Yonamine (Fumiko).  While the movie fails to avoid stereotypes altogether (O'Neil), Hackman, as McGinty, is the absolute epitome of the `coach,' and `The Replacements' is entertaining and uplifting while putting the game into perspective and making a statement about greed and human nature.  There are moments in this film that are not so much predictable as inevitable, but the climactic game will have you on the edge of your seat; it ain't over till it's over.  In the end, you realize that it doesn't really matter who wins or loses, because you'll come away feeling maybe a little bit better about yourself and life in general; and call it what you will, that seems like a pretty good deal to me.

Thirteen Days," Takes You To the Brink
","Throughout the Twentieth Century, misjudgment-- the failure of one side to extrapolate the position of the other side-- has resulted in every major war from WWI to the Korean conflict.  And no one was more aware of this than President John F. Kennedy, when in October of 1962, photographs taken by an American U-2 spy plane uncovered the existence of Russian surface-to-surface missiles being deployed in Cuba; missiles with a range that encompassed every major city in the U.S., with the exception of Seattle.  `Thirteen Days,' directed by Roger Donaldson, is a chronicle of two of the most intense, significant weeks in the history of America, as well as U.S./Soviet relations.  Thirteen days that came down to a twelve to twenty-four hour period that could have changed the world as we know it today.	Working from an intelligent, well-researched and accurate screenplay by David Self, Donaldson takes you behind the closed doors of the White House and conference rooms in which the fate of the nation was ultimately decided. The outcome is, of course, a matter of history, but the process which led to the final conclusion is intense, riveting drama that in the end illuminates just how close the world was brought to the brink of nuclear war by the Cuban Missile Crisis.  	Much of the tension in the film is derived and enhanced by the fact that it only gives the perspective of the Americans; but rather than making it a stilted, biased account, however, it becomes an objective, thoroughly engrossing presentation, and the fact that the viewer knows only what Kennedy knew puts you in the room with him, so to speak, and allows you to experience the process of assimilating the information, of extrapolating with Kennedy and ultimately making one of the most monumental decisions in history.	The story unfolds through the eyes of Kenny O'Donnell (Kevin Costner), special advisor to the President, long time friend of the family and a trusted member of the Kennedy inner-circle.  The film accurately establishes O'Donnell's position without embellishing his role simply for dramatic effect; he serves as something of a `tour guide,' through whom you gain access to the drama playing out behind the curtain.  That he is a close friend of the Kennedys is reflected in many scenes in which O'Donnell, Jack and Bobby are alone together.  And since the story is told from O'Donnell's point-of-view, naturally his is a significant role; the film very subtly goes to great lengths, however, to establish the fact that within the conference rooms or during the meetings in the Oval Office, O'Donnell is kept at arm's length and, though present, is not a direct participant.	Costner gives what is arguably one of the best performances of his career in this film, successfully capturing the essence of O'Donnell in an understated, subtle way that works extremely well and serves the story effectively.  He's clearly the star of the picture, though much of what he does is on the sidelines, which keeps the focus on Kennedy and the magnitude of the situation at hand.  Costner has drawn criticism in some quarters with regards to the distinctive New England accent he affects in the film, but the criticism is unwarranted; you have only to hear a tape of the real O'Donnell to realize how accurate Costner's portrayal is, up to and including the accent.	Donaldson and the producers of this film realized that for it to really have an impact, the roles of JFK and RFK, especially, had to be cast with great care; for the film to be believable and to maintain that focus on the story, the Kennedys had to be believable, otherwise the effect would be significant to the point of distraction.  And their meticulous efforts and hard work paid off.  Bruce Greenwood gives an excellent performance as John Kennedy, from the accent to the body language and mannerisms he affects that so defined him.  And Steven Culp is perfect as Bobby, imbuing his performance with nuance and an eye for detail that convincingly brings him to life.  	The outstanding supporting cast includes Dylan Baker (McNamara), Henry Strozier (Rusk), Frank Wood (Bundy), Len Cariou (Acheson), Bill Smitrovich (General Taylor), Kevin Conway (General LeMay) and Kelly Connell (Salinger). During the strife of the Civil War, the nation was preserved because the right man, Abraham Lincoln, was in the right place at the right time; and in retrospect, the same can be said of John F. Kennedy and the Cuban Missile Crisis.  As Kennedy said, if we fail to comprehend the Soviets, and they don't understand us, the result will be tragic; and though the controversy of politics is inescapable, and there will always be two sides with opposing views, this film succinctly demonstrates that in this instance, it all came down to the decision of one man who proved he had the vision and the determination to do the right thing.  And anyone who disputes it need only be reminded that, in fact, that is the Sun you see shining through your own window every morning.  I rate this one 10/10.",10,0,0,15 July 2001
Windtalkers," A Triumph for John Woo
","There is great beauty to be found in life, as well as great ugliness; and often it is where you look and how deeply you feel that will, in the end, determine your perception and either open your eyes to it or cause you to miss it completely.  In this film, director John Woo manages to find beauty amid the ugliness and brutality of war, and it is that vision of the beauty of a greater good, inherent in the indomitable spirit of mankind, that he seeks to offer for the consideration and contemplation of his audience with `Windtalkers,' a film that transcends the violence it depicts to discern that omnipresent aspect of the human condition that is defined by the gentleness and compassion of which it's very core has been forged.  More than a film, this is a journey, the intent of which is to open the eyes and the mind; and to those with the courage to assent to it, the heart, as well. It's a brutal film.  And it's a beautiful film.  And in the end, it will be whichever you deem it to be; it all depends on how deep you want to look. Or how deeply you want to feel.Saipan, 1944; the U.S. military has implemented a code based on the Navaho language that is virtually unbreakable, and it is imperative that it remain so during their drive to secure this island, which is an important stepping stone on the way to the final objective:  Japan.  The Japanese, meanwhile, would like nothing better than to capture one of the `codetalkers,' from whom they could extract the information vital to their efforts against the American forces.  It is therefore vitally important that none of the codetalkers, all of whom are Navaho-- and all Marines-- falls into enemy hands.  Toward that end, a personal `bodyguard' has been assigned to each individual codetalker; the charge given to Sergeant Joe Enders (Nicolas Cage) is Private Ben Yahzee (Adam Beach), a personable young Navaho with a wife and young son back home.  Yahzee has volunteered because he wants to help his country.  But that information, as well as anything about Yahzee, Enders does not want to hear about or know.  And the reason is very simple: his mission is to protect the code, not the man; and under no circumstances is Enders to allow Yahzee to be taken alive by the enemy.  So if the moment of truth ever arrives, the less Enders knows about his charge, the easier his job will be.  He's a good Marine, and he has demonstrated in an earlier conflict that he will do his duty, no matter what.  It's the reason he was chosen for this assignment.  So as they venture forth into the fray, the objective is clear in Enders' mind:  At any cost, protect the code.John Woo is the absolute Master of the action genre, and with this film he once again demonstrates what sets him apart from others who may aspire to that which Woo has achieved in film after film.  Quite simply, he refuses to sacrifice story for pure action.  Instead, Woo goes to great lengths, as he has here, to deliver a solid, emotionally involving story, presented through some of the greatest action sequences ever filmed.  The battle scenes he stages are, without question, the predominate force in this film, and they are graphic, but not gory; and just as Spielberg did with `Saving Private Ryan,' Woo very straightforwardly addresses the very real brutality of war without resorting to sensationalism or manipulation to engender shock value. Even in the heat of battle, Woo's focus is not on blood and guts, but on the drama being played out in the lives of Enders and Yahzee, as well as the others we have come to know and care about, like `Ox' Henderson (Christian Slater), and his charge, Private Charlie Whitehorse (Roger Willie). 
Wonderfully staged and beautifully filmed by cinematographer Jeffrey L. Kimball, Woo's film is visually stunning and emotionally engrossing, and succeeds where others of the genre have failed:  `The Thin Red Line' had the visual poetry, but lacked the human element; `Black Hawk Down' was brutally honest but did not engage emotionally.  Woo succeeds on both fronts with this film, which is not so much an historical depiction of the `code' and how it was used, as it is an examination of the moral challenges posed by war and the courage it takes to confront them, presented by Woo primarily through the characters of Enders and Yahzee, and with a sensitivity and some insights into the human condition that is generally lacking in most `action' films.As Enders, Nicolas Cage turns in a solid, honest performance in a role which, some years ago, would have seemed custom-made for Steve McQueen.  In Enders, in fact, there is more than a touch of McQueen's Jake Holman from `The Sand Pebbles.'  With an introspective approach, Cage very quickly and convincingly conveys so much about who Enders is and what makes him tick. And allowing Cage those `moments' in which he so capably develops his character, and putting the drama of the story on an even keel with the action, is a big part of Woo's formula for success.  Cage, as well, refuses to allow the action to take precedent over his character and the story, and he deserves to be commended for it, as the film is better because of it. Cage and Woo are a good team, in fact; they complement one another artistically, and their collaborative efforts here definitely take this film to a higher level (which was also the case with Woo and Tom Cruise with `Mission Impossible 2').  The supporting cast includes Mark Ruffalo (Pappas), Peter Stormare (Gunny), Noah Emmerich (Chick) and Frances O'Connor (Rita).  From the ethereal opening frames to the end, supported throughout by a hauntingly wistful score by James Horner, `Windtalkers' is another triumph for John Woo, and his best `American' film yet.  9/10.",9,1,2,18 June 2002
Braveheart," Gibson Demonstrates His Mettle
","Throughout the ages, oppression has taken many forms, rearing it's ugly head to deny the liberty and the rights of people everywhere, and the cry of `Freedom' and the inherent longing to be free of tyranny in any of it's many incarnations is universal and older than recorded history.  Man has fought on one battlefield or another and in one arena after another in an effort to rid himself of the shackles that bind him, and he has always paid a dear price for that freedom.  `Braveheart,' directed by and starring Mel Gibson, is the story of one man who would not abide the despotic rule of an unworthy sovereign, and took a stand against it.  A 13th Century commoner and a patriot who loved his country, Scotland, William Wallace (Gibson) burned with an unquenchable desire to be free of the British, who had murdered his father when William was just a boy.  Raised by kin, Wallace nevertheless grew up wanting only to marry, work his farm and raise a family.  But circumstances dictated otherwise, and without knowing what they had unleashed, the British rekindled that fire that burned within the boy, and Wallace soon left his mark on the Monarchy of King Edward I of England.	Wallace was a man of singular determination, and managed to do what no one else had ever been able to do before him:  He united the clans of Scotland. Before Wallace, the clans stubbornly clung to their autonomy, changed loyalties whenever the mood struck them or the price was right, and endured the domination of the British because of it.  Wallace changed all that, by convincing them that by standing together as one, they could win.  And he proved it.  He amassed an army and made a stand at York, and again on the battlefields of Stirling and Falkirk.  With savage tenacity and courage, he never gave in nor gave up his relentless and heroic quest to make Scotland free.  	Gibson brings Wallace to life with a performance worthy of the man he portrays.  To achieve what he did, Wallace had to be larger than life, and that's exactly what Gibson brings to the screen.  But he plays him as a man, not a hero; Gibson's Wallace is very real, and someone you can believe would be able to stand before an army and lead them into battle.  In one memorable scene Wallace, mounted on a spirited horse, addresses his men-- many of whom had just joined him-- as they are about to engage the enemy at Stirling. Someone from amongst the crowd calls out, `We heard Wallace is seven feet tall!'  To which Wallace replies, `I AM William Wallace!'  And by the time he finishes his powerful speech (which screenwriter Randall Wallace openly confesses was liberally borrowed from Shakespeare's `Henry V'), spurring them on and preparing them for the impending battle, you believe he IS seven feet tall.  It's an inspired performance through which Gibson shows you the man behind the legend, while at the same time he makes you understand just how and why the legend was born.  	And, as impressive as Gibson is in front of the camera, what he does behind the camera with this film is even more impressive.  The magnitude of this film is awe inspiring, and that Gibson could carry it as an actor, while directing it as well, is quite a feat, indeed.  He used the bleak weather of Scotland and Ireland to great advantage in scene after scene, creating the perfect atmosphere in which to tell his story; he experimented with different camera speeds, especially when filming Catherine McCormack (Murron), which gave her a more graceful, sensuous look; he staged some of the most compelling battle sequences ever made; and he captured the intricacies of the characters-- all with an eye for detail and the ability to integrate it all into a film that took home the Oscar for Best Picture, while deservedly landing him the Award for Best Director.  It was obviously a labor of love for Gibson, but the hard work paid off handsomely in the end, especially for the audience, for it is they who realize the real fruits of this endeavor-- a truly stirring and memorable motion picture.	The supporting cast includes Patrick McGoohan (Longshanks), Sophie Marceau (Isabelle), Angus MacFadyen (Robert the Bruce), Brendan Gleeson (Hamish) and Peter Hanly (Prince Edward).  A film of epic proportions, `Braveheart' is emotionally involving and inspiring, with a message about the irrepressible capacity of the human spirit.  Gibson put everything he had into this one, and it shows; this is his `Citizen Kane,' a pinnacle of achievement that few actor/directors every attain.  With brilliant cinematography (by John Toll), some of the finest editing you'll ever see (by Steven Rosenblum), terrific performances and Gibson's special touch, this is an unforgettable film that demonstrates what the magic of the movies is really all about.  If you love movies, this is one you simply do not want to miss.  I rate this one 10/10.",10,2,3,8 June 2001
Contact," Foster Makes 'Contact'
","All of the greatest work by the greatest scientists has been done while they were very young, when they were stupid enough to believe that two-plus-two-equals-five, and pursued it instead of listening to all of those who were much older and wiser who said Don't Waste Your Time. Einstein, it has been said, asked all of his important questions before the age of twenty-five, then spent the rest of his life working on them. `Contact,' directed by Robert Zemeckis, is the story of a young scientist, Ellie Arroway (Jodie Foster), who like Einstein and all the greats before her, has been asking questions and seeking answers since she was very young. And now, as a member of the SETI (Search for Extraterrestrial Intelligence) team, she is able to pursue her obsession with the mysteries of the galaxies and the infinite universe that surrounds us.  Her job is to sweep the skies, using the most sophisticated equipment available, for a signal from deepest space.  It may be her job, but for Ellie it's a labor of love, for she is convinced that there is something, or someone, out there somewhere, because otherwise, she reasons, what a terrible waste of space it would be.  Ellie may be a dreamer, but she knows in her heart that it is the dreamers who over the years have been responsible for making us evolve, making us learn and grow because they are the ones who take insane, foolish ideas and pursue them.  And to her, two-plus-two will always be five.	Ellie loves her job and believes in what she is doing, but it's been a struggle over the years, as she and others have had to constantly fight for the funding necessary to keep the project alive, begging for dollars from short-sighted, unimaginative people with vision that goes only as far as the bottom line of their budget book.  It's been a tough row to hoe, and she's had to swallow a lot of pride over the years, but then one day it all pays off, when in one magic moment she hears what she's been waiting for all her life:  A signal from a distant end of the galaxy-- someone attempting to communicate, to make contact, with the people of the Earth. 
	Ellie and her team soon realize that, whomever it is, they are using the universal language of prime numbers in their attempts at making contact; and when Ellie deciphers the code, she discovers something monumental in the bargain.  But it's a message of global importance, something much bigger than she and her team alone, and she soon find herself fighting to remain a part of the drama that is only beginning to unfold-- the first interaction between human beings and an alien life form.  And it's only the beginning of the adventure and the wondrous places this film is about to take you.	Jodie Foster gives a performance here that demonstrates what a gifted, talented actor she is.  Her Ellie is convincing and believable, and someone to whom you can genuinely relate, no matter who you are or where you're from, because there is something universal in Ellie's passion and longing to discover the truth and to see beyond the veil of our limited mortal capacities.  There's a strength to Ellie, born of a combination of intelligence and innocence, as well as tenacity and faith, and Foster manifests all of these complexities of her character beautifully, with a performance that should've landed her an Oscar nomination.  In this role, she is simply as good as it gets.	As the young Ellie, Jenna Malone gives a terrific performance, also, which certainly captures the same spirit that we find in the adult Ellie.  And there's a maturity she brings to the character that far exceeds her years. She was a perfect choice for the part, and if this is any indication of what she is capable of, Malone has a successful career ahead of her.	The supporting cast includes David Morse (Ted Arroway), Matthew McConaughey (Palmer), Geoffrey Blake (Fisher), William Fichtner (Kent), Tom Skerritt (David), James Woods (Kitz) and Angela Bassett (Rachel).  Zemeckis did a brilliant job of bringing this film to fruition, especially in the way he allowed Foster the time to really develop her character, by giving her that extra moment at just the right time that ultimately meant so much in the final analysis.  Too often it's those few minutes that wind up on the cutting room floor that make the difference between  a good film and an exceptional one; and between Zemeckis and Foster, they took it to the edge by taking some chances to realize that combined vision, which in the end made this a great film.  Thoroughly engrossing and entertaining, `Contact' will transport you to places you can only imagine, and it's all done with style and in a way that makes this a truly memorable cinematic journey. It's what the magic of the movies is all about.  I rate this one 10/10.",10,148,199,25 June 2001
Jurassic Park," The Genius And Vision Of Spielberg
","It's indeed rare when a movie comes along that is so special, and has such a tremendous impact on audiences of all ages, that when it happens, it's an occasion for celebration; which is exactly what Steven Spielberg gave the world with `Jurassic Park,' a film that made the impossible possible:  It enabled dinosaurs to walk among us.  He put these monsters from a bygone era on the screen for all to see, and the unique thing about it was that they were real; so real you could reach out and touch them it seemed.  And in doing so he touched the imaginations of every child who sat there in the dark of a theater and watched his creations come to life, and he touched the child that still resides within every adult who came to see his show as well.  Jaded moviegoers and those who affect cynicism as a mission statement of life may scoff, especially now, after some time has passed and the magic has worn off somewhat, but it doesn't alter the fact that with this movie, Spielberg surpassed any and all standards of the cinematic world and set the precedent for all that would follow.  To borrow a line from one of his own characters, he `Spared no expense,' and simply made one of the most exciting and memorable films in the history of the Silver Screen. 	Spielberg pulled out all the stops to make this remarkable film, and it goes without saying that the special F/X are incredible; what's easy to overlook amid all the spectacle of it, however, are the performances turned in by one and all, and most notably by Jeff Goldblum, who brings such nuance and style to the role of Dr. Ian Malcolm.  It's a supporting role into which he immersed himself to create one of the more memorable characters in the film, and his performance-- with the countenance and attitude he lends to Malcolm, even the commanding, mesmerizing way he speaks-- has never received the attention it so richly deserved.  Nor has the performance of Richard Attenborough, as John Hammond, the entrepreneur who makes Jurassic Park a reality.  He's such a gifted performer that he makes you forget he's acting; Hammond becomes real, which makes what he's doing real, and it's just another example of the many things that add up to make this such an incredible movie.  Spielberg and his cast and crew have given such care to detail that it, in effect, releases the viewer from the baggage of even having to suspend disbelief because they're given a world that is `real' from the ground up.  The result of using all of the magic available, and using it wisely. 	Also turning in outstanding-- and entirely believable performances-- are Sam Neill, as Dr. Alan Grant, and Laura Dern, as Dr. Ellie Sattler, each creating figures central to the plot and around whom much of the action revolves.  And there are a number of performances in supporting roles that are just too good to go unmentioned as well,  including Bob Peck, as Muldoon, the park's head gamekeeper; Martin Ferrero, as the `blood-sucking' lawyer, Donald Gennaro; Wayne Knight, as computer hacker Dennis Nedry; Samuel L. Jackson, as computer programmer Ray Arnold; and last, but not least, Joseph Mazzello and Ariana Richards as Hammond's grandchildren, Tim and Lex, through whose eyes the child in all of us vicariously experiences the wonders of Jurassic Park. 	The wonderful thing about a movie like `Jurassic Park' is that, not only will it forever remain as a testimonial to a filmmaker of genius and vision, but that it will be there for all the generations that follow to discover anew.  The world may change drastically around us, even from one day to the next, but as long as even a single spark of imagination survives, one thing will always remain constant:  The fascination by children of all ages for these legendary beasts that once ruled the earth.  And that is why, when all is said and done and the skeptics have become no more than shadows and dust, this film-- as well as Steven Spielberg-- will remain a cause for celebration.  This is the legacy, and the true magic of the movies.  I rate this one 10/10.",10,3,4,2 January 2001
High Fidelity," 'Okay, name the top five movies about music that--'
","A man suddenly closer to middle age than to the carefree frivolous years of youth begins to understand the consequences of non-commitment in terms of his relationships with women, in `High Fidelity,' directed by Stephen Frears and starring John Cusack.  When his girlfriend, Laura (Iben Hjejle), leaves him for the guy upstairs in their apartment building, Rob Gordon (Cusack) begins to take stock of his life by reflecting upon the `top five break-ups' he's suffered over the years, seeking answers to the seeming pattern of rejection that has plagued him since Junior High School.  As he does so, it establishes a thread that runs throughout the film through which some insight into Rob's (as well as some of the others) character is gleaned: `Top five' lists that reference music (Rob owns a specialty record store, specializing in `vinyl') based on category and sub-category, with his `break-ups' and finally `top five jobs,' framing the story. 	Set in Chicago, with Rob's store in a neighborhood not especially conducive to `walk-in' trade, Frears sets a mood and atmosphere that conveys the freedom of a rock n' roll lifestyle and evokes the yearnings of youth on the threshold of discovering reality.  Though Rob personifies an entire generation that has `been to the mountain,' only to be faced with coming back down again, Frears takes something of a lighthearted approach to Rob's angst, with a brisk pace and by infusing enough subtle humor (though somewhat dark at times) into the proceedings to keep it lively and entertaining.  There's a gritty, down-to-earth feel to the film, along with a sense of time and place with which anyone in the audience will be able to relate on a personal level, for this is the kind of territory, in one way or another, that most people have traversed; a vicarious route to self-discovery, if you will. 	John Cusack is perfectly cast as Rob, carrying his cloud of burden with wry, almost self-deprecating amusement.  His naturally outgoing persona is just right for illuminating Rob's introspective thoughts, which he shares with the viewer by speaking directly into the camera, and it works exceptionally well, for it conveys a sense of being privy to a most intimate confidence.  And Cusack lends something of a Nicolas Cage `hang-dog' look to Rob, which gives him a quirky, likable appeal.  Hjejle gives a notable performance as well, as the woman in Rob's life who at last precipitates his life altering musings. 	The supporting cast includes Jack Black, who turns in an exuberant, memorable performance as Barry, one of Rob's employees with aspirations of becoming a rock star; and Todd Louiso, as Dick, Rob's other employee, whose stark contrast in personality to Barry makes him equally as memorable. Rounding out the supporting players are Lisa Bonet (Marie DeSalle), Catherine Zeta-Jones (Charlie), Joan Cusack (Liz), Tim Robbins (Ian), Lili Taylor (Sarah) and Natasha Gregson Wagner (Caroline).  Cleverly written (screenplay by D.V. DeVincentis from the book by Nick Hornby) and well presented, `High Fidelity' succinctly captures a specific culture and a lifestyle of ambivalence invested with obsessions and eccentricities (Rob, for example, sorts his personal record collection `autobiographically'). It's an entertaining, funny and sometimes insightful look at life as we know it; a good story with plenty of music, some laughs, and engaging performances, which make this film more than worth seeing, especially for fans of John Cusack, and for anyone who wants some insight into the influence popular music has indeed made upon the world in which we live.

The Island," Science Fiction At It's Best
","This movie, because it's a 'Summer, Sci-Fi/Action' flick, will probably do extremely well at the box office, if for no other reason than the fact that Ewan McGregor and Scarlett Johansson are in the cast. Regrettably, however, even after it's been out for awhile it will probably never reach as wide and diverse an audience as it deserves until it's release on DVD, when-- hopefully-- positive word of mouth recommendations will lead those who usually avoid this particular genre to it. Because 'The Island,' directed by Michael Bay, is a cautionary, thought-provoking tale set in the not-so-distant future that holds a mirror up to our current society and poses some serious questions about moral judgement and how unmitigated secrecy on the part of institutions and those we 'should' be able to trust affects us all on a daily basis that is especially relevant in today's world.The story concerns the survivors of a 'contamination' who must dwell within a seemingly sterile, self-contained city where their happiness is paramount to those in charge, while at the same time their only hope for the future is to be the next lottery winner, which would afford them a one-way ticket to the last uncontaminated place on earth, The Island. And to tell it, director Bay, no stranger to action films with such offerings as 'The Rock,' 'Armageddon' and 'Bad Boys I&II' under his belt, has drawn upon myriad other classics of the genre and used the collective threads to successfully weave his own story and imprint it with the kind of metaphor that elevates it beyond the next action sequence or explosion. A comparison to 'Logan's Run' goes without question, along with an obvious nod to 'Blade Runner,' a smattering of 'The Matrix' and even a pinch of 'Star Wars.' Which is not to say this is a 'copy' of any of those; it definitely is not. Bay has merely-- and wisely-- drawn upon some of the more successful elements of those films, and in most instances expanded upon them, to deliver a memorable film that far surpasses the genre's usual board of fare.Arguably, this is Michael Bay's best overall film to date. Though he has demonstrated in the past that he knows how to do action, he has outdone even himself with this one. There is one heart-stopping scene, for example, involving a number of vehicles and helicopters that eclipses even the highly touted freeway sequence of the second 'Matrix' film. The F/X are top notch, and once the action begins in earnest, he sets a pace that builds the excitement without allowing it to lay or lapse even for a second, right up to the very end. Add to that the fact that this film really has something to say, and it will make you appreciate what Bay and his company of actors and technicians have accomplished here even more.Ewan McGregor is perfectly cast as Lincoln Six Echo, using his boyish charm, good looks and manner to lend the necessary credibility of innocence to his character. The charismatic Scarlett Johansson finds just the right note, as well, to bring her character, Jordan Two Delta, to life. Bay gives each of his actors, in turn, a moment in which to define their respective characters and underscore the plausibility of the film, and when that time comes they each succeed in a way that sustains the interest in the story beyond the action and the F/X. Excellent performances by both McGregor and Johansson.In a supporting role, Steve Buscemi adds color to the proceedings as McCord, the man with the answers to a number of questions Lincoln Six has been asking about their environment and way of life; questions to which others in positions of authority respond with guarded circumspection, among them Merrick, one of the apparent caretakers of the city. Played by Sean Bean, Merrick is one of the pivotal characters of the film, and while Bean's performance is decent, it lacks the nuance that could have taken it to a much higher level. As it is, while effective to an extent, it is a fairly lackluster and generic portrayal.The excellent supporting cast includes Michael Clarke Duncan (Starkweather); Ethan Phillips (Jones Three Echo); Brian Stepanek (Gandu Three Echo); Noa Tishby (Community Announcer); and Siobhan Flynn (Lima One Alpha). For most, 'The Island' will be an exciting summertime diversion; but for those who pay attention to the underlying social and political significance of the story, the rewards will most likely exceed any and all expectations. And that's the magic of the movies.",9,12,27,23 July 2005
"O Brother, Where Art Thou?"," The One 'Sullivan' Wanted To Make
","Producers/writers/directors Joel and Ethan Coen evoke the essence of such classic films as `Sullivan's Travels' and `I Am A Fugitive From A Chain Gang,' with their Depression Era comedy, `O Brother Where Art Thou?' directed by Joel Coen and starring George Clooney.  Borrowing the title of the `meaningful' film that successful comedy filmmaker Sullivan wanted to make in the 1941 Preston Sturges film `Sullivan's Travels,' and finally-- in reality-- making it, is only the beginning of this clever, funny tale based on Homer's `The Odyssey.'  The hero here is one Ulysses Everett McGill (Clooney), who along with two others, Pete (John Turturro) and Delmar (Tim Blake Nelson), escapes from a chain gang, commencing an `odyssey' for the trio wherein they ultimately traverse many of the railroads, back roads and tank-water towns scattered throughout the good State of Mississippi.  It becomes an adventure of the first magnitude as the three cohorts encounter situations and characters that are humorous and sometimes poignant, and-- for the audience-- always fun.  It's a richly woven tapestry of Americana (including plenty of traditional music) that is bound to leave an indelible impression in the mind of the viewer. 	Leading man Clooney has one of his best character roles yet-- it's a Clooney we've never quite seen before-- and he is more than up to the task. Invested with the mustache and rugged good looks of Clark Gable, and with his natural charisma working overtime, he creates a likable, articulate character that stands out in marked contrast to just about every other character in the film.  And he's a joy to watch; his Ulysses is a real kick from start to finish, and it's a performance that is worthy of an Oscar. Turturro, as well, creates one of his most memorable screen characters, drawing heavily upon the naturally quirky side of his own personality and accentuating his own unique physical traits which lend themselves so well to the embodiment of Pete.  And Nelson does the same with his Delmar; like Turturro, he successfully captures the soul of the character, both physically and emotionally, and-- it must be mentioned-- both actors (with Coen's help, of course) manage to avoid the trap of making their characters mere stereotypes, and it's one of the reasons they are so engaging:  These guys are the genuine article. 	The extraordinary supporting cast, all of whom individually create truly original characters in their own right, includes Holly Hunter (Penny), John Goodman (Big Dan), Chris Thomas King (Tommy), Charles Durning (Pappy O'Daniel), Del Pentecost (Junior O'Daniel) and Michael Badalucco in a memorable turn as George `Babyface' Nelson.  Not content to sit on their laurels, the Coen Brothers constantly seek to expand the boundaries of their personal cinematic universe, and they succeed splendidly with `O Brother Where Art Thou?'  It's a rousingly warm and witty and-- most importantly-- highly entertaining and creative film that takes the viewer on an unforgettable journey.  The Coen's distinct imprint, like the cinematic equivalent of The Good Housekeeping Seal of Approval, is stamped on every frame of the film, and it's like an assurance of quality and a good time to be had by all.  There's magic in the movies the Coen Brothers make, and this one goes far toward proving what anyone who has followed their movies over the years knows already:  Nobody does it quite like Joel and Ethan.  This one is not to be missed.  I rate this one 10/10.",10,0,0,12 February 2001
