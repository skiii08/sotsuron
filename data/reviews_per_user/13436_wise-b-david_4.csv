The Expendables 2," Hands down the stupidest movie I have ever watched
","I went to the cinemas to watch this knowing that I would not enjoy this movie at all. I was persuaded by the offer of lunch beforehand with my friends. In hindsight I would rather have starved then watch this movie.The story was absolutely terrible. I know it was an action movie and the story line is always going to be unrealistic but this was easily the stupidest thing I've ever watched and I have watched the Youtube video 'Krispy Kreme - The Baddest' several times. Sylvester Stallone was way too involved in this movie, he is a terrible actor. Nan Yu who played Maggie was also terrible. In that sense they made the perfect on screen couple. I see Stallone also had a part in writing this movie which explains a lot, the man can barely speak so it doesn't surprise me that he can't write either.I sincerely hope that this is the last ever Expendables movie ever. If you would like to watch a bunch of old actors who were never really good at acting before shoot guns and blow things up. Throw in lots of lame one liners that will make you cringe rather then laugh. Then go ahead watch Expendables 2 but I strongly recommend not to. It ranks as one of the worst movies I have ever seen.",1,2,4,21 November 2012
Skyfall," 6 means its good, why is everyone giving films 10/10?? That means that you think the movie was perfect
","This film was pretty enjoyable, Its a Bond film so I wasn't expecting the greatest film ever and it wasn't but it was enjoyable.It was a typical Bond film, action, a hot girl who gets romantically involved with Bond and is then killed as a result, the destruction of towns in third world countries. Bond doesn't care but, he causes accidents, destroys buildings and trains and would probably have killed hundreds of innocent people in the process of catching a bad guy who has a list.When will governments learn, never put all the top secret identities of your secret agents on the one USB drive.Another thing during the casino scene in Macau where Bond is talking on his bluetooth earpiece to the other girl telling her to not look at him so that they wont draw attention. Firstly you are the only non Asian people in the casino. Secondly everyone is looking at you thinking 'Why the hell is that crazy white guy in a suit talking to himself' That is not undercover.Also when I see Ralph Fiennes on screen all I can picture and hear is Voldermort saying 'Harry Potter' waving a wand around screaming for horcruxes and that.All this aside, its pretty good hence my 6/10 rating. So go watch it if you want.",6,0,4,28 November 2012
Don Jon," A massive disappointment
","There is only a few things I really care about in life... my body, my pad, my ride, my family, my church, my boys, my girls, my porn...... my body my pad my ride my family my church my boys my girls my porn. Body pad ride family church boys girls ....... The trailer does not lie.This was such a massive disappointment. It felt poorly paced and whilst the actors were all pretty good I just found the storyline really boring. The whole film felt just a little stupid.My advice is don't watch it, just watch an actual porno instead at least at the end of that you will leave feeling satisfied.",2,4,12,30 December 2013
Hugo," Wouldn't call it a kids movie
","So I watched this movie in ordinary 2D the other day. The only reason I can imagine this film being labeled a kids movie is because it was shot in 3D.If I was a kid I probably would have hated this movie, it would've bored me to death. But alas I am no longer a child and I really, really enjoyed it.Chloe Grace Moertz, Sacha Baron Cohen and Ben Kingsley were superb. The story line was at times slow but clever and helped along by the performances of all the actors. In summary, if you at all enjoyed the movie The Expendables then do not watch this movie, if you are a child under the age of 10 also do not watch this movie. However if you are over the age of 10 and did not enjoy The Expendables or the sequel then there is hope for you. Watch it!!",7,1,2,21 November 2012
