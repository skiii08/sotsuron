Pirates of the Caribbean: On Stranger Tides," Goes a long way to redeem At Worlds End but still needs polishing
","I hardly saw any previews and so went in expecting nothing and I was left surprised which is good, as I was really let down by the last part. At Worlds End was a bloated, convoluted special effect driven mess that had me hoping that there would be no more Pirates movies. Gore Verbinski pulled a Wachoswski brothers in destroying the goodwill they created with the first Matrix with two very poor sequels. While Verbinski had a better second movie the third is very comparable to Matrix 3.The Positives: The humour is mostly back and it was funny, unlike the lame jokes from AWE.Penelope Cruz looked really amazing, till I realized later that she was 7 months pregnant at the time of shooting- what a glow! She also held up very well in her role and her comic timing was excellent. I hope she makes it into the next movie.Less special effects and more real action. This is a huge step up from AWE whose ending was terrible.No Orlando Bloom or Keira Knightley! Yahoo! This deserves a 7 rating just for just positive alone! Slightly more focus on the story, even if it is still weak compared to the first movie The negatives: The story is still weak and not totally focused which let down the movie overall The opening action sequence was unnecessary, dull and overly expectant. It was a copy of the action from the first movie so it was just a matter of going through the routine. Not very funny either.Sparrow being the focal point of the story was not handled well. In fact the more the story focused on Sparrow the less interesting he became.Blackbeard's story was very dull and for a fearsome pirate...he was not. Ian Mcshane didn't do the character any justice and he could have well been left out.The movie suffers from too many plot angles still...There's Sparrow vs Barbossa, Sparrow Vs Blackbeard, Sparrow and Barbossa Vs Blackbeard, Sparrow vs Blackbeard AND the Spaniards...The plot still suffers from the parts 2 and 3 problems. This needs to be toned down to one or two rivalries, not the whole world vs Jack Sparrow Barbossa was not interesting and it's time that this character is cut from the plot entirely.Gibbs's role was really reduced which is a shame because he provided plenty of good humour in the first movie and he and Sparrow shared a really good camaraderie. He needs to have a bigger role in the next movie.All in all it's still worth watching at the cinema. Ignore the opening and ending sequence. It's a good start to repair the damage done by AWE but it still needs improvement. If there are still 2 more sequels to come then they have time to get it right. So far the first movie still ranks as the best, even if orlando bloom and keira knightley are in it.",7,0,2,6 July 2011
Tinker Tailor Soldier Spy," A good solid old fashioned spy story
","I'd been waiting forever for the movie to be released and for the most part it was worth the wait. Tinker Tailor Soldier Spy has been handled very well- for one thing it's so much easier to follow than John Le Carre's novel (but Le Carre fans might disagree).The first plus point is the plot, which focuses solely on locating a traitor at the top of British secret intelligence, which is known as the Circus. It's very hard to pinpoint, from the viewer's point of view, who the traitor is as we never see any of the main characters engaging in suspicious activity right until the very end and for that it's worth the wait. The acting is another plus, with Marc Strong, Toby Jones and Gary Oldman putting in some strong performances.The downsides are few but worth noting. It's very important not to lose focus of the story because there are times when the plot deviates and it can be distracting and confusing. Also, if you've read the book it makes following the story easier and also the characters because the familiarity will allow you to over come the slowness of the pacing, which in itself is bit of a negative point. For me, colin firth spoiled the casting as I didn't think he offered much to the movie or towards his character. But then again I dislike firth intensely so that's just a bit of biased opinion. I've also seen the original series that starred Sir Alec Guinness as George Smiley and I preferred Guinness's Smiley to Oldman's. Gary Oldman felt too stiff, too reserved for me to truly enjoy his performance.However, all that aside, this is a good movie to watch which sets itself apart from the latest Bond action fueled rubbish. Not all cloak and dagger movies need a requisite car chase or an exploding building to be considered quality. This is a definite recommend to all espionage fans.",7,2,4,4 January 2012
Shutter Island," As a twist turner this is one of the best
","I have to admit that when I first saw the trailers for Shutter Island I wasn't very impressed. It just looked like an outdated run of the mill mystery that didn't look all that interesting. It wasn't until a friend recommended it that I decided to watch it. I'm really glad I listened.The pace of the movie is excellent and there's enough intrigue that it kept me going till the end and when the twist was revealed I sat back and thought 'Whoa!' It's even better the second time through because then you know what's happening and the outcome and this time you just try to understand how it all works.The whole cast, with the exception of Mark Ruffalo (whom I don't really much care for as an actor) are perfect for their roles and Leonardo Dicaprio really takes to the role of Teddy Daniels. Credit also goes to the writers for the movie, and the author, Dennis Lehane, who's book is the source of the movie and has also had a couple of other movie translations, most notably Mystic River and Gone Baby Gone.So, in essence, this is one of 2010 best movies of the year, after Inception, and it is a must watch. To better understand and enjoy the clever and interesting story a second viewing is highly recommended!",9,0,2,6 July 2011
Captain America: The First Avenger," The best superhero movie of the year without any gimmicks
","I've never followed Captain America in comics though I do know a little bit of the origin. So I'm one of the people who could sit back and enjoy the movie for what it was rather than nitpick on gaps in the CA lore.The best thing about the movie is what's not in it- and that's cheap advertising gimmicks, such as a character opening a laptop to show an Apple or Sony logo, or car symbols or Coke, Pepsi or any fast food restaurant. It, however, would have been interesting to see if they could tie CA into their food products by having Marvel burgers or the American Superburger...I dislike cheap advertising tricks and thankfully this was completely avoided. Gone also was any chance of using high tech gadgets much like what was shown in Iron Man 2.I found the plot interesting- the buildup to Steve Rogers becoming Captain American was done well and very interesting. The downside would be the action sequences which I thought would be more realistic or appropriate to the time setting. Instead several sequences were more reminiscent of what Iron Man 2 felt like.As I'm not a CA follower some of the historical nods to certain symbols or the side characters themselves were lost to me but I did enjoy that Howard Stark's character was in the movie as it introduced the origin of Stark Industries and it's technologies of the future.Actingwise Chris Evans did a surprisingly good job. In Fantastic Four he was OTT and hammed a lot and was generally quite annoying. Here he's more serious, focused and determined. There were a lot less quips, something I really detest in American made super hero movies. The cheesy quips might work in graphic novels or comics but in movies it comes off as plain lame. Hugo Weaving was quite good though too- he's becoming quite popular in characters taken from literature, comics or cartoons.This is a movie for pretty much every age gap. There are no swear words (I don't even think the word damn makes it into the movie!) and no sex scenes so kids are perfectly fine to watch it. It's definitely the best superhero movie of the year and one of the better ones made entirely. I doubt that any sequel will be as good in terms of plot and story setting but in the meantime enjoy this summer gem.",Null,11,22,26 July 2011
Silver Linings Playbook," An interesting and a fun experience at the cinema
","SLP is one of the few movies that's worth watching on the big screen, not just because you know there won't be any loud and obnoxious people in the cinema with you, but for a seemingly good time that seems to fly so quickly that you feel slightly dazed when the end credits roll.The story is interesting, if a little bit clich√©d in one part, but that doesn't take away from the overall experience. It was fun trying to watch Pat try to sort out his life after being let out of the mental institution and once out he has a host of obstacles to overcome, the least of which happens to be Tiffany, a young unemployed widower.Bradley Cooper is excellent as the disturbed Pat, so scarily so that you think that Cooper in real life exhibits these problems. He's well supported by Robert DeNiro as his Dad, with one or two loose screws of his own. Jennifer Lawrence is good but for some reason, for me anyway, she didn't quite pull off the role of a crazed or mental person. At least not when you compare her to Cooper.The pace of the movie moves along quite nicely, the editors doing a good job of moving from scene to scene seamlessly. There's never a drop or a part that doesn't fit in. The humour is funny and helps break the serious flow at the right moments.All in all it's a good movie, an even better date movie, but one that you'll enjoy at the cinema.",7,2,7,27 November 2012
Wreck-It Ralph," Absolutely brilliant, absolutely must see and must own!
","Every once in a while a movie will come out of the blue and hit you right between the eyes, in a good way. Wreck-It-Ralph (WIR) is just one of those movies. It is perhaps one of the best movies I've seen this year, and can confidently put in in the top 5 that for the entire year, despite it being a 2012 release.Normally, I like to be as objective as possible, but I must confess a certain degree of bias for WIR for it has good visuals, good characterization, and most of all an excellent story.I state the visuals as being good because that's the best word I can use. They're not stunning compared to other animated movies both old and new but it has been aptly rendered to fit with the video game like feel of the characters.The main strength of the movie is the story, a clever weaving of different video game characters and giving them a more fleshed out and 'human' quality. The behind the scenes story was refreshing and highly entertaining. I enjoyed how the story created a link between an arcade player and the character he/she chose. There was also a nice blend of various genres of game styles, appealing a wider viewing audience. The clever part was that pretty much anyone could associate with the characters, across genders and age groups, as we've pretty much encountered similar games over the year. Some of the characters were instantly identifiable, such as the Street Fighter characters or Qbert, but others were play on characters so you did have to stretch your imagination and association.The story is very well told and moves at a good pace, never stagnating. It's hard to put my finger on it but WIR had an original vibe to it, even without it being a completely new idea. Think of it as a re-imagining of a fairy tale story, only there isn't a dragon, or a chivalrous knight, or a damsel in distress. Again, it's very cleverly done. The range of emotions that movie displays is also staggering. It has everything for everyone- action, humour, romance, drama.If there is a slight drawback to the movie it would be in the voice over department. I have nothing against John C. Reilly but I felt that his presence took away from Ralph. Every time Ralph spoke I didn't see or hear Ralph. I saw and heard John C. Reilly when I really wanted to see and hear Ralph. A no name but a good voice actor would have been preferable, at least to me. After all in animation movies the characters are promoted, not the actors voicing them. Did mothers and their daughters flock to the cinemas to see Brave because Kelly Macdonald and Emma Thompson were doing the voice overs? I didn't think so either.All in all this is a movie that everyone should see. The endearing quality of the movie will have you smiling, laughing, tense, frowning and maybe even in tears. I have been recommending this movie to everyone I talk to about movies, and if you read this review and watch the movie I hope you do to. This movie deserves a rating closer to 9.5 than that overall 7.9 that is stated.",9,0,0,17 March 2013
Despicable Me," An average animation that was low on humour
",I didn't expect much from Despicable Me and I was left slightly disappointed as I was hoping to be proved wrong. I'm not a Steve Carell fan and this movie hasn't improved my opinion of him.I found that the plot in some ways was similar to Megamind- a villain wants to be the most hated super villain in the world and concocts a wicked plan to achieve his target. But along the way circumstances change and he finds himself becoming more of a hero than a villain.Megamind was better because Will Ferrel was funnier and the humour in that movie was far better. Here I didn't find myself laughing too much nor did I think too much of Gru. Steve Carell didn't do a good job with the voice acting- his accent kept slipping and his American twang was becoming more evident. Even the supporting cast was less than average.where the movie did jump up a notch was due to the Minions who were cute and hilarious. It was great that they couldn't speak English or that would probably have spoiled the fun.Is it worth watching? It's not a definite recommend. Megamind is much better. But it's worth watching just for the Minions alone. Hopefully if the next one comes out Gru's voice is recast with someone better.,Null,0,1,21 July 2011
Taken 2," Good Action, poor story makes this an unnecessary sequel
","There are certain movies that do not require sequels: Cars 2, Wrath of the Titans, Shrek 2. Taken 2 should safely be added to that list.It's not a terrible movie- had it been a standalone story it would have done very well. But there are so many repetitions that makes it seem as though you're watching a different version of Taken 1, from the chirpy intro, to being abducted and the subsequent actions scenes. Close your eyes as you watch Taken you, visualize Taken 1 in your mind, and you can virtually map the entire movie without opening your eyes.The action deserves the plaudits as it's choreographed very well. Luc Besson is a veteran of car action stunts and there are some thrilling moments. But it's ruined by the repetitive and predictive story.Liam Neeson looked bored as he lumbers his way through the movie. He should as he's done the same thing in Taken 1. This time he and his ex-wife, Leonora, are taken and he has to get loose, and beat up all the goons standing between him and freedom. Along the way he has to save his daughter, again! Seems as though she didn't suffer enough in the first movie. The main villain has a poor excuse for attacking Neesom, which looks even more pathetic when Neeson counters with a very valid reason for causing the villain so much anguish.Maggie Grace has more of presence in this movie and while it's great for girl power that she has a more action oriented role, it really requires a superhuman effort to accept that her character, who can't even pass a road test in USA in an automatic car to boot, somehow becomes an ace stick shift driving hotshot in the crowded streets of Istanbul. More than Neesom kicking everyone's ass I found this quite absurd.I really hope that this is the end of Taken. As Neeson's character states in the movie 'I'm tired of this.' I echo that sentiment loudly.The bottom line is that it is disappointing so much money was spent to essentially make the same film again. If you're looking to satisfy your action thirst before Skyfall comes out this won't be the worst thing to go watch. Just don't pay full price for it.",6,0,1,9 October 2012
Flight," Interesting but a little long in the tooth
","First off, whoever made the trailer for Flight should be slapped in the face, and then fired... It certainly would have been nice to have experienced first hand how Denzel Washington's character averts a mega disaster. Even though the trailer ruined the surprise it doesn't reduce the heart thumping moments of the airplane scenes.Flight is mostly interesting but it is also quite long and if you're one to fidget the time is going to go by slowly. It tells the story of a flight captain averting a major air disaster and concentrates on the consequences afterward.This movie relies on two things: Denzel Washington and the special effect. Both deliver but it's the effects that get the nod because you can barely tell, if at all, when it's all blue screen. My heart was thumping wildly in the beginning of the movie, as if I was in the plane. Amazing stuff.Denzel succeeds too, that is if you want to loathe his character, who's essentially a selfish scumbag, and a drug induced alcoholic to boot. It's interesting that Robert Zemeckis went down the path of having a lead in such a negative role. Washington is in great form, as a charmer and as someone in denial.It's a decent movie to watch, especially if you're in the mood for drama. Action hunters should avoid it, unless you're a Denzel fan. Just beware that it does drag at times.",6,2,4,7 November 2012
Looper," An excellent Sci-fi mind bender
","It's best if you go into the cinema without knowing what the story is about because you'll have a pleasant experience.The story is interesting and while you need to pay attention in the beginning there's not much in the sense of brow furrowing twists. It's not foolproof, not utterly brilliant, by any means but it serves its purpose in keeping you focused till the end.The acting is very well done by JGL. Willis is pretty much the same in movies these days so I can't rate his acting. Just chalk it up to Bruce Willis being...Bruce Willis. I'm not a fan of Emily Blunt but she was good here and her accent was flawless. Jeff Daniels was so-so. I felt he had an important role to play in the story but he was just relegated to being a goon, and a pointless goon at that.While there are questions about the plot and the time travel and the idea of a looper in general it's not enough to deter your experience. It's one of the better movies in an awful and disappointing year in terms of cinematic experience.",7,1,12,2 October 2012
Transformers: Dark of the Moon," Bay tried to deliver on his promise of a more developed story but failed miserably...but at least he gave us a good action movie
","Transformers 1 still remains the best of the lot in terms of story and the joy of watching the robots transform. By the third part it becomes quite ordinary and mundane.The positives: The action sequences are done quite well. With the way technology is advancing it's quite amazing at how quickly sequences can become bigger, better and longer. If the humans portion was cut out of the movie entirely it would be an even better movie to watch.It is a million times better than the abominable ROTF.John Malkovich in his short role is quite funny, as is John Turturro, even if he is still OTT in his diminished and toned down role.The transformers, both good and bad, are quite excellent. Sad to say but they're better actors than the humans.The slightly sub par: The new girl: I have to admit that she wasn't as bad as I thought she would be acting wise but she was still nothing special. In fact her role was completely pointless and there was a point where she's interacting with the transformers as she's been in the previous 2 movies and took herself way too seriously at times. Even a muppet on a stick could have done the same job, for less money, and with the same result. But she is still a lot better than Megan Fox...The negatives: The lack of consistent humour, which was quite funny and welcome in the first movie. Instead there are some sexual gags and jokes which are quite lame.The slow motion of the new girl's body: I like it when a camera focuses on a hot girl but the way Bay did it made me feel sleazy and cheap. It was there in the first movie but done quickly and more tastefully. Here, it's so blatant that it's annoying, as if it had to be part of the script or else the movie would fail.The plot: there is none, or more to the sense there is nothing original to the plot of the movie. It follows the basic principle of just about every trilogy ender: have a giant war/battle that lasts more than an hour. It seems that the plot was written after the action scenes were mapped out because it's a jumbled mess with a lot of stop and go.The cheesy ending: a typical Michael Bay ender. NO spoilers required. Who said this guy could direct movies? Too many human actors: just about everyone from the first two movies are in it and there are new people added. There's no time to draw out anyone's back story and you just don't care for Sam and the rest of the humans this time round.Not enough time spent on the robots: This movie, as well as the others, starts of as Transformers, not Humans. There are new transformers but they are either not identified or done too quickly for us to register before the start of a action sequence so it becomes confusing whether they are autobots or decepticons.All in all, it's a teenager's action movie wetdream and they'll love it. But for the cynical it's a wasted effort on ending the transformers saga on a high note in terms of a good story. If there is another movie in the works I really hope that Michael Bay is not there to ruin it. George Lucas destroyed the first three Star Wars movies with his 'vision.' Let's hope that Michael Bay is not round to repeat the same mistake...",7,6,13,29 June 2011
