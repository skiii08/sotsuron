Borat: Cultural Learnings of America for Make Benefit Glorious Nation of Kazakhstan," Borat is the funniest movie I have ever seen
","Borat's comedy is in a high level, because is freaking funny. In every moment of the movie I said 'what the f**k', but I laughed really loud at every moment. This movie is masterful, almost amazing, but It doesn't really show the spectacular level.The story, in this movie, isn't meant to be interesting, is meant to be dumb, because of It's 'laugh out loud' moments. It's crazy, and really shows how to make a comedy film. And, what really amaze me, is the fact that the whole movie is a true story. Borat really kidnapped Pamela Anderson, he really did all these embarrassing things in front of the people, that they thought he was crazy. Voice acting is really the Kazakhstan accent of English. It really captures it, and they really did a great job to it.Well, I recommend this movie for the people that likes dirty laughs, but for them that take the movie for serious, than that's probably not recommendable.8.5/10",8,0,1,31 August 2012
The Hangover," The Hangover will make you laugh out loud.
","The Hangover is incredibly funny, and enjoyable, especially for adults, because it haves a lot of mature themes. Maybe the plot isn't terribly good, still you will laugh out loud, while watching the movie. The characters are funny, and friendly.I'm not going to give any spoilers, but I can say that the plot is good. It seems a bit predictable, for some moments, but It's really enjoyable. The story is full of comedy, while it shows mature themes. So, I don't recommend this to children, but to the old teens or adults, It's enjoyable.Voice acting is professional for my opinion. And the actors are pretty good. They really captures the perfect personalities to the different actors.If you are a teen or an adult, buy this movie. While It doesn't shows something spectacular, you will enjoy it, and you will laugh even if you think for it. 7.5/10",7,0,0,31 August 2012
Shrek," Shrek's funny plot, and top notch animations makes this movie great.
","Shrek is fantastically animated, with a stylish and unique story. Even the voice acting is terrific, but I don't recommend this movie to everyone, even if It's great and worth.Shrek is hilarious. The plot is interesting and brings you laughs. It shows the fantastic story of Shrek, a monster that every human hates. I will only say that, nothing else. While the story is great, and funny, I don't recommend this to everyone, because rarely, but critically the story might be not worth for some people, and they might think It is dumb. But, Shrek is brought mostly to laugh, and I'm really glad that I liked the story, and I didn't thought It was bad.Great voice acting and fantastic animation makes this movie a great movie. I was enjoyed seeing the animations, and laughing by the hilarious plot, and characters. The voice acting, especially, makes the movie funny.It's worth, and great, buy it, ENJOY IT!8/10",8,1,3,31 August 2012
