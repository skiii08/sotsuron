Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," George does it again...
","I got to be in the 12 o clock screening of the movie and it was electric in the audience.  We cheered, laughed, and applauded throught the whole thing. I want to post a few negative things people I go to school with talk about and my answers.1)'it's a kid movie' Of course, neither the fans or Lucas would have it any other way.  It is suited for every age, it just depends on how much you read into the movie. 2)'Jar Jar was annoying'  I think to the contrary.  He was ridiculous at times but not overpoweringly so.  He provided MUCH needed comic relief. 3)'Darth Maul was barely on screen'  I liked that.  I gave a sense of looming evil over the movie.  If he would have talked much the auora of evil may have dissapated.  The 'caged tiger' force field scene with him was expertly done.hey that's all I have to say.  I though it was in the great Star Wars tradition and if you haven't seen it I suggest you do.",10,0,0,20 May 1999
