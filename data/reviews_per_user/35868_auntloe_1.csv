National Treasure: Book of Secrets," Excellent Movie
","I thought this movie was excellent. I thought the cast was brilliant. Of course, Nicholas Cage is one of my favorite actors, but I thought the supporting actors were excellent, as well. Well worth seeing. I was especially impressed that the movie had no swearing. To actually go to a movie these days and not have to hear swearing was totally awesome. I hate it when movies add swearing to a perfectly good movie just for no reason at all. It was refreshing not to hear it for once, to watch a good history/action/adventure story and enjoy it in its entirety. It was great entertainment. I'm thinking of seeing it again. How refreshing.",10,2,7,7 January 2008
