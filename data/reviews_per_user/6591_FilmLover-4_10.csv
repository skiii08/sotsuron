The Ring," Ingenious use of videotape and DVD adds to intensity
","The ingenious use of a videotape, an object the moviegoer is very familiar with and may even be using when first experiencing the film, draws the viewer into the film in a unique manner.  If the viewer see the film for the first time on DVD, going to the 'Don't Watch This' section of the special features may absolutely freak them out.  This is a monumental combination of screenwriting, packaging, media use, and marketing.  This was well done. And, has Naomi Watts ever looked this good?",9,1,1,9 March 2003
Finding Neverland," Superber - excellence without need to edit for the family
","In this story based on true events, Johnny Depp is outstanding in the lead role. His skills are quite amazing. Though I was not a fan of his earlier work, it obviously serves him well as he matures in his craft and combines his offbeat ways with the subtly and skill that comes with experience and age. Depp is a master. I don't say that lightly.The movie is heartwarming. The actor who played real-life Peter did a marvelous job with his character. Child actors rarely have that sort of skill express itself so early.Kate Winslet is well cast.Bottom line: a winner through and through.My wife did not want to see this movie thinking it would be a fantasy, etc. She loved the movie and was moved to tears with the poignant ending.",10,4,5,22 January 2005
Unbreakable," Respectable but not on the same level as The Sixth Sense
","The Sixth Sense was a masterpiece for many reasons, not the least of which was the fact that all movie goers, from the young and uninitiated to the action flick fan to the sophisticated fan of art films, could enjoy the movie.  It crossed all boundaries.  Unbrakable is nowhere near that type of film, and was actually quite slow to develop, almost excruciatingly slow. The last half hour except for the abrupt and unfulfilling ending was much better.  Lots of skill but it didn't come together the was The Sixth Sense did.  Of course, a director/writer could go an entire career and not even have one The Sixth Sense.  It is probably too much to expect a repeat.",6,0,0,24 December 2000
The Notebook," Great movie
","This film is a strong romance and love story.Superb filmmaking, and the acting, especially Rachel McAdams, who was captivating, is of a high caliber.It would have been nice if the mild nudity had been left out, and if the intense love-making scenes were more left to the imagination, though I admit that the scenes showed the intensity of their attraction.Everyone has a story to tell, and this was a great story of a lifelong romance started the summer after high school.*** Not for anyone under 16 or maybe even 18.Parents should be wary of having children see this film, especially without talking about it afterwards.  While the love story was powerful and it turned out well for the main characters, intense teen love can also lead to tragic mistakes that impact a lifetime.  There is a certain lack of morality in the main characters (though they may have never been taught the morality), especially considering the time period of the story.I return to the delight in the movie -- Rachel McAdams performance.  Truly an inspiring job.  She was perfectly cast.  I am not sure about the casting of Ryan Gosling.",9,0,0,1 July 2004
The Others," Complete rip-off (plagiarism) of The Sixth Sense
","Possible plot revelations ... warning.This movie is an anemic rip-off of 'The Sixth Sense.'  While 'The Sixth Sense' was original in its mood, plot, and shocking twist at the end, this movie robs that same device with a plodding, slow development and too quick wrap up at the end.  It is incredible that someone would even try to make this and open themselves up to such criticism.  'The Sixth Sense' also explained the 'doctrine' behind the parallel spirit world while 'The Others' fails to explain the 'why' at all.  For instance, we know why the main character in 'The Sixth Sense' could not tell he was the dead person, because 'dead people only see what they want to see.'  There is no such explanations for anything in 'The Others' -- and then to top it all off the movie attempts to create sympathy for a paranoid schizophrenic child murderer.  Huh?!  Disappointing on many levels.  One positive note: the acting was above average by all players, which was appreciated.",4,7,18,17 August 2001
"I, Robot"," This is better than critics and some are saying!
","This is a movie, not literary art.  For a blockbuster popcorn movie, it's astonishing.  Great technical achievement in having computer generated characters mix with human actors.  Years ago an essayist predicted that Hollywood would abandon multi-million-dollar actors and use computer-generated actors instead ... getting close.  The script seemed strong to me, adding to Asimov's original idea and premise, turning it into both a thought-provoking and watchable movie.  I thought Will Smith was stronger than usual, an increase maturity without losing his sarcastic ways. I think that all-in-all, the Robot 'Sonny' really does need to get an agent and increase his movie salary next time.  ;)",9,0,0,16 July 2004
Meet the Fockers," Disappointingly poor
","This movie was a real letdown. Completely inappropriate for family, kids -- anyone. Weak writing, depending on lewd jokes, cheap jokes. A horrible movie. That is my main complaint -- just bad writing, cheap tricks, dumb plot. A high school screen writing class could do better in one afternoon. No joke.With a cast like that, it could have been so much more, so funny, but in every way this was a letdown.There was not even one laugh-out-loud thing, and only a few that even brought out a snicker. Really, really bad.I should have walked out and asked for my money back. Mad at myself for not doing so.",2,12,24,23 December 2004
Million Dollar Baby," Elements of movie-making shine in this film
","This is an almost flawless movie (other than needless profanity from a Catholic priest). Extremely poignant for a movie centered on the boxing world, this movie is a female Rocky for the 2000s.Of course, it is more multi-dimensional as it takes a hard look from not only the boxer's vantage point, but also that of the trainer-manager, too. The intricacies of the protoypical father-daughter relationship -- and the inferred protectionist attitudes therein -- are juxtaposed with the hard-knock, gritty world of female boxing.The twist at the end is surprising. The movie may end a bit too abruptly, but it makes one think. It has a strong moral play that goes beyond the bounds of boxing, and raises questions of utility for those possibly discard by the rest of society. I can't say any more or this will be a spoiler.Almost all of the elements of movie-making shine in this film. None more so than direction and acting. Truly artistry at every turn.",10,2,4,6 February 2005
Click," Surprisingly touching
","This movie surprised us. We cried. Yes, we cried. The trailer barely tells you what the movie is about. There were some unfunny dumb things having to do with dogs, etc. (no one in the theater laughed much) and some cheeseball stuff, but the emotional core of the movie delivers a wallop that is unexpected. Along the lines of a sort of combination of 'Family Man' and 'It's a Wonderful Life' -- more 'Family Man' -- this movie didn't just bring tears to eyes, it makes you cry. Because of that, I liked it and give it a thumbs up. The annoying stuff is a relatively small price to pay for the lessons the core stuff teaches. Lastly, Kate Beckinsdale (the epitome of domestic beauty in this movie) is absolutely a dream and the actress that played her grown daughter had eyes that matched -- well done. Enough said.",8,236,344,23 June 2006
Coach Carter," Not formulaic -- outstanding sports movie
","Some have criticized this movie as one being too formulaic, following the pattern of other 'disadvantaged community sports stories.' I disagree. The movie actually breaks the tradition in a way I can't specify (no spoilers here). The success in overcoming the formulaic accusations, and perhaps the basis for those accusations, probably lies in th fact this is based on a true story. An outstanding movie in almost every way.The only drawback for me is its persistent profanity. Of course, it is probably toned down and about 25% of what the actual personalities, upon which the story is based, would have shown in their everyday speech. The edited version of this movie should be almost flawless.",9,1,4,17 January 2005
