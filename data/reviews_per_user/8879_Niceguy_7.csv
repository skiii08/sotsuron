Catch Me If You Can," WORTH CATCHING
","Crime doesn't pay... or does it?  Either way, Leonardo DiCaprio looks like he's having quite a bit of fun in the new Steven Spielberg film CATCH ME IF YOU CAN.  Based on the true events of con-artist extraordinaire Frank Abagnale Jr., CATCH tells the story of a boy from a broken home who dealt with his problems by pretending to be someone else, and cashing in by doing so.  The movie opens with FBI agent Carl Hanratty (Tom Hanks) transferring a sickly and slightly older version of Frank Jr. from a French prison to America.  We then flashback to six years prior.  Frank Jr. is living with with his seemingly happy parents, and all feels right with the world. Things quickly change.  His father (Christopher Walken) is having serious IRS problems, resulting in a major downgrade in the family lifestyle.  Frank Jr. goes to a new high school, where he finds enjoyment fooling his classmates into thinking he's a substitute teacher.  Thus begins his obsession with trickery.  Back at home, his mom appears to be cheating with Frank Sr.'s wealthy friend, played quietly by a somewhat pudgy James Brolin. Divorce soon follows, and Frank Jr. can't handle it.  He runs away, immediately bouncing checks in an effort to live on his own.  After seeing the unusual amount of high respect received by airline pilots, he concocts a plan to pose as one.  His new look allows him to cash 'payroll' checks easily, and he begins raking in the dough.  Taking things one step further, Frank Jr. even uses his persona to fly all over the world for free.  It isn't long before the FBI gets wind of what's going on, and agent Hanratty becomes determined to stop the thief behind it all.  And so the chase begins.  Frank Jr. manages to stay one step ahead of his pursuer, eventually posing as a doctor and even a lawyer, all the while never realizing what he really needs to be content.  Women find him charming, and the newspapers practically glorify his actions.  He finds time to communicate with his father, who surprisingly never disagrees with Frank Jr.'s methods, though it's obvious he feels his son is going to lose control.  Meanwhile Hanratty is risking his own career by repeatedly letting the thief slip through his fingers.CATCH is an engaging film to say the least.  One can only wonder how a person was cunning enough to pull all these acts off. Spielberg directs with fairly minimalist style.  There's not many fancy shots here, but rather several moments of subtle humor.  One James Bond-related gag helps make the movie shine, and generates some great laughs.  DiCaprio and Hanks handle their roles well.  Leo can still make us believe he's young, and it's hard to not like him in this role.  Hanks is fun to watch, and his rather thick accent makes up for his otherwise nerdy character traits. We know he's the good guy, but almost view him as that strict librarian type who just doesn't know how to have fun.  He's by the book, and Leo isn't, which creates a terrific character contrast.  Walken turns in a fairly good performance as well, playing the tortured father figure who only wants the best for his son.  Jennifer Garner fans can look for her to pop in and out as a former model turned prostitute.  Unfortunately it's a 'blink and you'll miss her' role.  Other actors appearing here include Martin Sheen as the wealthy father of an innocent girl Frank Jr. proposes to, and Amy Adams as the girl in question.  Also take time to appreciate the smooth score composed by the one and only John Williams.If there's any negative points here, one could easily say that the film runs rather long at 140 minutes.  The opening of the picture also gives away the fact that Frank gets caught, which might have been better left until the end.  There is a very unusual solution to all the problems he causes, making the film particularly unique.  Spielberg has crafted an enjoyable flick that brings back the feeling of the late sixties, and appropriately tells the story of a truly interesting man... er... kid..On a scale of ONE to TEN, 10 being the best, I give CATCH  ME IF YOU CAN a 8.",Null,0,1,21 January 2003
Unbreakable," If you haven't seen this movie, drop everything, go rent or buy it, DO NOT let anyone tell you ANYTHING about it, just sit down and watch it straight through.
","UNBREAKABLE is without a doubt one of the best comic book movies ever made, which is interesting since it's not based on an existing comic.  Bruce Willis plays David Dunn, a man who literally walks away from a horrific train wreck only to find he's the sole survivor.  Samuel Jackson plays Elijah Price, a tortured man whose permanent condition causes him great pain, and forces him to question his role in life.  Elijah approaches David promising answers, and inadvertently causes our hero to realize some very miraculous things about himself.  David Dunn has his own share of problems already dealing with a troubled household.  Can these two very different people form very different live find a way to help each other?  Director M. Night Shyamalan (THE SIXTH SENSE) has constructed yet another mind-blowing film, filled with shocks and surprises while mercilessly holding our attention.  This is a movie you must appreciate, for the simple fact that it works so well.",Null,0,0,14 July 2001
Memento," You better pay attention!
","Imagine what life would be like if you had no short-term memory.  You meet someone, introduce yourself, and have a conversation.  Ten minutes into that conversation you realize you don't remember meeting this person, or any of what you just talked about.  This is the life of Leonard Shelby in MEMENTO. He's a tortured man living in a life without a set direction.  Only through a system of writing himself notes on photos, and tattooing special information on his body, can he make it day by day.  He knows that his wife was raped and murdered.  He remembers everything up until that day... or does he?  Now he wants only to find the man responsible, and exact the harshest form of justice.  Along the way he's made a couple of friends. Teddy, played by the always engaging Joe Pantoliano, is a confident but shady pal who seems to know a lot more than he lets on.  Then there's Natalie, played mysteriously by Carrie-Anne Moss.  She seems trustworthy, but may have her own secret agenda.  Between these two, Leonard doesn't quite know who to trust, or more importantly how much he's already trusted them.  His one saving grace comes in the form of a tattoo on his hand that reads 'Sammy Jankis', which is in reference to a man Leonard met some time ago who suffered the same condition.  You'll snicker at the way certain people take advantage of Leonard's problem, only to find those actions become more disturbing and very extreme as the story rewinds.  The worst part is that he can do nothing about it.  MEMENTO is a twisting tale told literally backwards.  The first scene in the film is the last thing to happen.  Our job as the audience is to slowly step back in time to uncover just how exactly all of this came about.  There has been quite a bit of buzz about this movie from numerous film festivals around the world.  It's interesting to see how a movie can take such a dramatic step against the norm, and still find new ways to keep you guessing.  Guy Pearce, who many of you may remember from L.A. CONFIDENTIAL a couple years back, plays the confused yet highly motivated role of Leonard very well.  We feel for him, but wonder just how sane he could be with his condition.  The film gets a tad longwinded in some scenes.  Overall it's a cinematic experience that has to be seen to be fully understood.  The best part about MEMENTO is the fact that what you take away from it will most likely be unique to you.  This is not a film for everyone.  It seemed that most of the 'older' people didn't care for it.  I distinctly heard one gentleman tell the poll-taker that he thought it was a 'Poor' movie.  Others seemed almost giddy with a sense of awe.  Some films are more cerebral than others.  If you decide to see this, be prepared to think hard about it, both during and after.On a scale of ONE to TEN, TEN being the best, I give MEMENTO a SEVEN",Null,0,1,28 March 2001
X-Men," Whole lotta Wolverine!
","I must admit, I was unsure whether or not I'd enjoy the X-Men movie when I first heard about it.  I went into the advance screening of X-Men expecting the worst.  I'm happy to say I wasn't disappointed.  In fact I was pretty pleased, along with the rest of the audience.  Singer's film is not without faults, but it is a highly enjoyable interpretation of one of the biggest comic properties around. The film opens in the 1940's as we see a young Magneto being separated from his parents in the middle of a Nazi concentration camp.  We quickly see the awesome power this young man possesses.  Jump to the not too distant future, where we meet a confused girl named Rogue, who learns of her power in a frightening way.  The film doesn't waste too much time on story, but rather jumps forward with numerous character introductions.  We learn that Mutants are the subject of fear within the American public.  One man in particular, Senator Kelley, has determined that Mutants must not be tolerated due to their unpredictable nature.  Meanwhile, Rogue leaves home only to find another Mutant in the form of the rough and rugged Wolverine.  They are attacked in the snow filled woods of Canada by another vicious Mutant named Sabretooth.  Just when things start to look really bad, two more mutants show up to save the day.  Jump to the Xavier School, where Wolverine and Rogue find safety among others like them.  We learn that Professor X, played casually by Patrick Stewart, has assembled a bevy of Mutant youngsters in an attempt to teach them and help them understand their powers.  We also find out that Magneto, all grown up and immensely powerful, has devised a lethal plan to get back at his human persecutors.  The first thirty to forty minutes of the film simply introduce and explain all of the key characters and plot points to us.  We then become aware that Magneto's plan is contingent on acquiring the power of one of our heroes.  Then the major action starts, and pretty much doesn't stop for the rest of the film. The movie is paced fairly well.  We never really get much of a chance to be bored, and there are plenty of nice effects to gaze at.  Singer tries to spend a fair amount of time on each character, but it's obvious he wants to focus on Wolverine.  Hugh Jackman does a fantastic job of portraying the popular hero, but I can't help feeling that some of the other characters get neglected.  Cyclops, who has always been one of my favorite characters, doesn't really have much to do here.  Oh sure, he stands around and looks tough, but I wanted to see more depth from him.  He and Storm, played quietly by Halle Berry, are for the most part just set dressing.  I really got the sense that we were missing some development scenes here and there. I hate to say this, but I really got the feeling that Wolverine was doing too much.  During the film's finale, our rugged hero fights THREE battles, one after the other.  Why couldn't Cyclops jump in there?  Perhaps if the franchise continues, the sequels will spend more time with the other heroes. All in all the film is pretty well done.  We get most of what we want, which is fast-paced action and lots of groovy effects.  The film is not without surprises either.  Look for cameos by other X-Men, or shall I say soon to be X-Men.  Judging by the audience reaction, this film is really going to do well.  In my opinion the best thing about the film is the fact that it will open some doors in Hollywood for others like it.  Singer has provided a nice template to work from, let's just see which artist uses it next.",Null,0,0,12 July 2000
Snatch," Funny follow-up to Ritchie's impressive debut, full of fun and nifty camerawork.
","SNATCH is a film, not unlike PULP FICTION, that blends together the lives of several colorful characters in unusual and entertaining ways.  The film focuses mainly on a rather large diamond, which is stolen by Franky Four Fingers (Del Toro).  This diamond passes from hand to hand in a dramatic series of events.  A fight promoter named Turkish (Statham) finds himself forced in league with a sneaky gypsy fighter named Mickey (Pitt).  If Turkish and his partner can't convince Mickey to take a dive in a fixed fight, they'll all face certain death at the hands of the sadistic Brick Top played by Alan Ford.  When Franky Four Fingers shows up missing, Cousin Avi (Farina) flys to London to bust some heads, along with the help of local tough guy Bullet Tooth Tony (Jones).  Two small time jewelry store owners and their portly pal find themselves unwittingly involved after kidnapping Franky, as ordered by a scary Russian arms dealer named Boris the Blade (Sherbedgia).  Everyone connects as the story unfolds, and despite how confusing everything gets, the film makes sense of it all within the last 30 minutes.  I liked SNATCH, if for no other reason because it plays against typical Hollywood formula.  The characters, while exotic and mostly with fancy names, seemed more real than the average movie fella.  The film feels a bit long, although it's average in running time.  There are great moments, and then there are moments that seem to slow everything down.  All in all every scene works together to build toward a collective ending, in which we get to see not necessarily a solution but rather a new beginning for the remaining players.  This is truly an ensemble piece.  I was surprised at how little Benicio had to do here.  He opens the picture, but his character soon fades making way for the numerous others.  Perhaps this was appropriate so that he wouldn't seem lost among the events.  Brad Pitt is hilarious, yet still finds time to convey emotion in a few select scenes.  Dennis Farina is Dennis Farina, and always does a good job.  Vinnie Jones plays the tough guy role again, although a bit subdued.  He gets a couple great scenes though, and still manages to look scary, even when he's smiling.  The performance that truly got me came from Alan Ford as Brick Top.  This guy is one mean dude!  It's amazing how a man who's older than all of the other cast members can exude so much power and feel so threatening.  Every time he showed up I was in fear for the characters around him.  SNATCH has it's share of violence, which is only outdone by it's swear count.  Fortunately it's all in good fun, and Guy Ritchie's creative directing throws us right in the middle of the action, which turns out to be a rather good time.",Null,0,0,14 July 2001
Star Wars: Episode II - Attack of the Clones," Sensory Overload
","I used to believe that you couldn't have too much of a good thing. Now I'm not so sure. In the latest installment of the STAR WARS saga, creator George Lucas does his best to raise the bar yet again in the area of special effects. While his technical accomplishments here are undeniably impressive, the film falls short of being perfect. I've seen this film twice now, and given a considerable amount of thought to what sort of opinions I'd express about it. I'm not looking to upset anyone with my statements, so please consider this as nothing more than one person's perspective. That said, our story opens with Senator Padme Amidala (Natalie Portman), formerly Queen Amidala, arriving on the giant city-planet of Coruscant. After an attempt is made on her life, it is deemed necessary by the powers that be to have Jedi protection assigned to her. The Senator's old friend Jedi Master Obi-Wan Kenobi (Ewan McGregor) is called upon, escorted by his student Anakin (Hayden Christensen), who is all grown up and eager to see Padme after so many years apart. Their arrival to assist the Senator is met with pleasure, but Anakin quickly realizes his feelings for Padme are stronger than expected. After a second attempt on her life, members of the Jedi council decide to begin an investigation to find those responsible. Anakin is told to protect Padme, while Obi-Wan searches for some answers elsewhere. Thus begins two journeys, and two continuing storylines that will carry us through the rest of the film. Anakin must deal with his love for Padme, which is forbidden by his beliefs, and unacceptable for a woman in her position. During his quest for the Senator's assassin, Obi-Wan discovers a plot much more complicated than anyone imagined. A clone army is being created under the supposed authorization of the Jedi council. As the events unfold, we find out there are more key players involved than originally expected.     Attack of the Clones attempts to tie together some of the subplots established in STAR WARS EPISODE I: The Phantom Menace, and hopefully provide some lead-in elements for STAR WARS EPISODE IV: A New Hope. While is succeeds on many levels, the film unfortunately drops the ball with plot and pacing. The story feels very disjointed. For a majority of the time our lead characters are simply planet-hopping, and find themselves in totally random situations for no reason other than to keep us awake. Many people are comparing this film to The Empire Strikes Back. Personally I don't see that, and would push the point that it doesn't really feel like a STAR WARS film at all. Oh sure, there's lightsabers and starships, but the mood and depiction of characters here seems foreign to the expected formula. While Lucas pushes the forbidden love story between Anakin and Padme, he lacks the tension necessary to make it work. Hayden Chistensen, who I must admit surprised me with his acting ability, is actually best when portraying elements of self-conflict. Those scenes are far more effective than the romance we're supposed to be fascinated with. This movie suffers from many of the same problems exhibited in other STAR WARS films, particularly with poor pacing and wooden dialogue. Many of the characters are nothing more than set dressing, and several are downplayed, some to the point of being annoying. For those of you wanting to see action, you'll definitely get it. The sad part is you'll have to sit through 90 minutes of jumbled story before it happens. There are sporadically placed action scenes throughout, but they usually seem more obligatory than important. The final series of battles are phenomenal, but also very lengthy. One would think these moments would seem more acceptable if spread out. Therein lies the main problem with EPISODE II. We wait patiently for a payoff, and it finally comes only to be experienced in excess. I never thought I'd complain about too much going on in a battle scene during a STAR WARS film, but the sheer amount of action overload during the final moments almost becomes disorienting. It was as if George was sitting there saying 'Look what all I can do!', and REALLY rubbing it in. I'm almost scared to see where it goes from here.     On the positive end, this is a visually stunning film. Lucas has crafted a work of art, albeit somewhat faulted, that we simply can't look away from. We can see a progression, not only with the lead character's personalities, but also with their environments. This is all heading somewhere, and George is making that clear. If he can calm down on the effects just a tad, and concentrate more on the story and pacing of events, then the next installment should be a terrific end to a great idea. Jedi Master Yoda, now fully computer generated, is given a considerable amount of screen time. The mysterious bounty hunter Jango Fett, not unlike Darth Maul in EPISODE I, is used a bit too sparingly for my taste. While EPISODE II is flawed, it's fairly more entertaining than it's predecessor, and will leave many fans feeling quite satisfied. But is that enough? I for one want to be more than satisfied. When it comes to a George Lucas product, I expect to be overwhelmed. That statement refers to the overall product, not just a select portion. Maybe the problem is I'm not a kid anymore. Back when the original trilogy came out, I didn't find myself complaining about things like script errors and pacing of scenes. I guess I just grew up, much like Anakin in the new film, and now I want more for my money. In conclusion, I must admit that I'll always be a sucker for a good lightsaber fight, and that's one thing that thankfully we get plenty of here.",Null,0,0,21 January 2003
American Pie," A shocking, but entertaining comedy.
","American Pie starts right off with shock value, and while the film relies heavily on it, there's plenty of story and exceptional performances to hold your interest.  I attended a sneak preview of what I was told was a rough cut of the film, although there was only one scene that looked unfinished. The underlying story here is that of four high school senior buddies who have made a pact with each other to get laid before they graduate, specifically at the prom.  The problem is, only one of them has a serious girlfriend, and she can't decide if she's ready for sex.  But where the film really makes an impact is in it's numerous masturbation related scenes. There is one scene particularly early in the film that should test your stomach for the rest of the film's humor.  Now while the film may not sound like it has good morals, there is one repeated underlying message, and that is to do what you like and not what you feel pressured to do. Unfortunately, this is NOT the kind of film its target audience should be seeing.  At times it makes getting laid seem like the most important part of high school.  The strength of the film lies in the fact that everyone who went to a public high school can relate to some aspect portayed here, and in the strong and well-timed performances of the talented cast.  If you're mature enough to appreciate the film for its sheer comical performances, then you should really enjoy it.  But if you don't like 'toilet humor', then you might not find anything appealing with this one.  Definitely not a date movie.",Null,39,65,11 June 1999
