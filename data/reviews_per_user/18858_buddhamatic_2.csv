Ali," Disappointing...
","Michael Mann, a director that is capable of making such good movies like Heat, The Insider, and Manhunter fell flat this time around.  Will Smith gives out an excellent performance as Ali but the story felt very slow, this film could have used some more edits as I saw some scenes in the film that were unnecessary for the audience to check out.  I cannot believe this film cost over $100 million to film, I couldn't see where the budget went here, probably to the actor's high salaries I suppose.  A rental at best.

The Thing," One word: SCARY!
","I've rented John Carpenter's The Thing today, I am a fan of John Carpenter's and I have never seen this film but heard many great things about.  Many of the user comments for this film are positive and I for one will be positive as well.  This movie from the beginning to the end was scary as hell, the makeup effects by Rob Bottin were totally awesome, best I have ever seen in a horror film since Evil Dead 2.  John Carpenter is an old school director but he knows how to deliver the goods to the audiences, I definitely recommend this film to all horror or sci-fi buffs as it is more entertaining than the original.Rating: 4",Null,0,1,21 October 2001
