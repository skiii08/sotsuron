The Ring," Damn, that's some scary stuff!
","The Ring scared the crap out of me.  I don't think a movie has ever had the effect on me that it did.  I got to watch it the other night on DVD (advantage of working at Blockbuster).  Three in the morning was a bad time. The movie does have a great story to it, though.  And the visuals are scary, the sound is scary, the story is scary...I don't spook easily, but damn!  So one would think that, after being so damn scared, I'd swear it off.  Of course not!  I want to buy it so I can see the special features (I was too scared to watch them), it had DTS sound, which I think would give me a heart attack, and I want to watch the original Japan version, Ringu.  I didn't rent it because I didn't realize what it was, but as soon as I can, I'm watching it.  And I want to track down the sequel/prequel to Ringu, thoughtfully titled Ringu 2 and Ringu 0, respectivly.Watch this movie.  Just not alone.",10,1,1,3 March 2003
