Walk the Line," Johnny Cash More Like Johnny Bash Your Head on a Wall
","I never listened to Johnny Cash, but he is very idolized even 16 years after his passing. This movie has some very good scenes, from the beginning where Johnny was a child, to the apparent parallels between him and his father. The filmmaker is telling the life story of Cash. I am unsure of how accurate it is, but it is entertaining. There was not enough history in this movie for me to enjoy that aspect, the only thing near it is the fact that the music industry always sucked people's souls and sold them for drugs and fame. I have seen the woman who plays June Carter in other movies, but as I am not a movie person I don't remember where. I liked how well the Cash actor played his role, he truly made me hate him which means he's a good actor. However, it is seriously unfair that he got a happy ending. I did like the drama in this movie, but it was half assed because June married him anyway 5 minutes after saying he is not allowed to talk to her outside of the stage. Overall, decent movie, needs more explosions.",6,0,1,24 January 2019
Miracle," It's a miracle I got through this
","Sports movies are so boring and predictable, how did this even become a genre that people pay to see? It's always the same, and this movie is no different; hard-ass coach, team having issues, there's a setback, the protagonist team wins, they rejoice, the coach actually has a soft spot and gives some speech that sounds profound but really he's just saying cliches and pausing in between to create some excuse of an effect. Also, the coach is ugly, get Chris Hemsworth next time, maybe that'll make it more bearable.",1,2,6,25 April 2019
Captain Phillips," Exciting movie
","Tom Hanks is such a good actor, its stunning that he has so much versatility in how he plays his various roles. The build up was good, not too fast and not too slow, we can really see how traumatic this would be for the Captain, even though he did a great job of keeping his composure. I recommend this movie to anyone whose interested in piracy and high sea crimes.",7,0,0,9 May 2019
42," Amazing acting, very inspirational and heartfelt
","Jackie Robinson was the first black baseball player in the Dodgers, and in taking on that role he faced tremendous challenges with racist America. Segregation was the norm, in EVERYTHING, and only the white baseball players got to be accredited. Robinson is portrayed (rightfully so) as a very emotionally strong character who fought racism by controlling his anger (although he had a right to be angry). He did not fight anyone or give them a chance to accuse him of anything, he simply out-played them.I love almost everything about this movie, but the thing that stands out is the quality of the acting. It must be very awkward to yell out racial slurs, and even more awkward to take it, but the execution was flawless and lifelike.The one criticism I have is specific to me and my knowledge of baseball (or lack thereof). I do not usually enjoy sports movies because I do not know much, and this movie did a good job of balancing the sports and social commentary, but I got tremendously bored during the first half of the movie because it was primarily sports-talk.Overall, really good movie. I would recommend this to a friend who enjoyed sports movies. 0 explosions, but still good.",7,1,2,5 February 2019
Remember the Titans," Good movie!
","This was a pretty great movie. The coach was very inspirational, and for a sports- themed movie (not my preference, generally) it was nice. It's a very feel-good movie.Because I'm not very into sports movies, I wish they would have focused more on the civil rights aspect rather than the real sport, but that's just personal opinion. The music and characters are lovable, the friendships feel genuine, the ending pulls at the heartstrings. Cool movie, would recommend.",7,0,1,11 April 2019
Hidden Figures," Amazing and Beautiful Movie
","This movie is about the space race, segregation, and civil rights. It shows the life of three African-American women who became the firsts in their fields of expertise.
This movie was truly magical to watch. It portrayed the struggles these women experienced and left off on a happy ending, telling the audience the continued achievements of them. Although the realism is a bit off (NASA did not have flat-panel screens, and communication between ground and astronaut was probably not as clear) it was still a really good movie. I don't have any criticisms, the cinematography was beautiful (like Katherine's teacher handing her a chalk to do math, then the director doing the same years later). Awesome movie, that's all there is to say.",8,0,4,7 March 2019
Selma," Excellent Movie
","This movie is about the Civil Rights movement led by Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. It perfectly illustrates the philosophy held by the civil rights leader advancing racial equality and promoting the enfranchisement of his people. This movie raised my awareness of the heavy racism experienced by these activists and their philosophy in contrast to Malcolm X's. Dr. King wanted to turn the other cheek, get the white people involved, and X wanted to fight back.
My favorite thing about this movie is the quality of the directing. Very good, would recommend this movie.",9,0,3,12 March 2019
Thirteen Days," Bad Rendition of Exciting Events
","The Cuban Missile Crisis was a very tense and paranoid time in United States history. People were on the brink of falling apart due to the fear they were experiencing fueled by various sources. In a way this crisis, like any other crisis, gave way to intensive political theater which further made people totally freak out. This movie properly illustrates the tension of these days and the affects on the officials' families as well as the surrounding citizenry.With all that said, I do wish this movie had paid more attention to the general ambiance of the nation rather than the struggles and actions of government officials.The movie has a taut, flat style, which may be appropriate for the events narrated, but it was still a bit boring in my opinion.Overall, decent movie, sufficient explosions.",6,0,3,18 February 2019
Apollo 13," Pretty boring but not 'American Graffiti' boring
","It's kind of a visually interesting movie at some parts, but its extremely slow which is a dealbreaker for me.The build up is excruciatingly slow. Movies need to be a certain level of unrealistic in order for them to be exciting to watch in my opinion, and this movie just isn't exciting. Overall, not a good movie, would recommend to a space nerd or someone who wouldn't mind the slow build-up. There are definitely worse movies.",5,1,6,18 April 2019
Back to the Future," The only valid time travel movie
","This is a really great movie and I enjoyed watching it. The ideas are inventive and original. There are great suspenseful scenes, and the overall quality of the acting and sound/special effects (considering the time of production) are really amazing. I don't see much history in it, as it is not the main focus of the movie in the first place. Marty starts out in the 1980's and ends up in the 1950's.The only criticism I have is the fact that the 'scientific' aspect of this movie is too ignored. It would have been nice to see a discussion about space-time continuum and the dangerous effects of altering the smallest things.One of my favorite things about this movie is the fact that there are a lot of references to Marty's time when he goes to the 1950's. It's very entertaining. However, I do wish the social differences of the 1950's were a bigger point.Overall, a really great movie and I would absolutely recommend it to anyone. It's iconic, and with good reasons.",10,0,0,30 January 2019
