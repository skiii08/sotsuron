The Blair Witch Project," Hands down the scariest film ever made
","Many may find the shower scene in Psycho, the shark attacks in Jaws, the breakdown of Jack Nicholson in The Shining, or Hannibal Lector in Silence of the Lambs more creepy than this indie film, but I disagree.  Never before have I felt so uncomfortable, so shocked, so disturbed, and so intense after seeing this film.  And for some reason, after feeling all that even now (4 days later), I'm dying to see it again.The Blair Witch Project is best left unknown for those who haven't seen it. The less you know about the film the better, because some of the best parts would feel rather lame if you knew it was coming.  The last 45 minutes of the film I sat there with my hand over my mouth wandering what would happen next and truly caring for the students.  There wasn't a script written for this film nor was there a storyboard to decide the events, it is all incredibly realistic with no hocus pocus or special effects.  It costs the price of a car to make this film and it shows how brilliant the directors are when someone like Wes Craven or John Carpenter can't come close to frieghtening us as much as this film does, despite the millions they can put into their films.Not everyone will like this film, however those who don't like it can't criticize it.  For those that think they can, they minus well shut the hell up and look at the originality and differences this film has to every other horror film out there.  This is definatly a film to see in theaters because not only is the sound an important aspect of the film but it's so amazing to sit there and notice how quiet a sold out audience will be while watching this film, you could hear a pin drop.  Truly remarkable, quite easily one of the best films of the year if not the best horror film ever made.",Null,1,1,3 August 1999
Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," Saw it on the first day of the first hour of the first minute and all I can say is DAMN!!!!!
","This film just simply owned.  No more, no less.  I refuse to give anything important away and won't reveal the story because it left many in the theaters breathless and cheering.  Great pod race and outstanding finale. I won't say anything else other than I hope you have as much fun as I did and see it with a great audience.  Don't wait, go now!",10,1,1,19 May 1999
Fight Club," A Clockwork Orange and Taxi Driver of the 90s
","My theory has already been proven.  A film so original, with solid directing and outstanding acting will be judged poorly by the critics.  Some moviegoers will complain about it's excessive violence and how it seems to have no point.  They will also complain that the ones that like or love it must be very sick minded people who you should stay far away from.  This happened when A Clockwork Orange and Taxi Driver were originally released in theaters.  Look where they are now?Some already are considering this a classic, and as the years go by it will be recommended every time you want to find a good old release at a video store.  And why shouldn't it?  Everything about it is original.  The story deals with a lot more than fight club and has one of the smartest screenplays written since Pulp Fiction.  Edward Nortan and Brad Pitt both give the performances of their careers.  There are also so many memeorable scenes in the film such as the scene in which Edward Nortan literally beats the living hell out of himself in front his boss and when Pitt meets the owner of the bar they are holding their fight club meetings under every night.  Some of the most original filming you will have seen in a long time also give the film an adrenaline rush while you watch it.Some will walk out of the film getting ready to throw punches.  Some will want to puke from all the disturbing images and violence throughout.  But, like Pulp Fiction, whether you like it or dislike it, there's not much you can say that's wrong with it.  The film is obviously not for everyone, a lot more for guys then anything else since they feel more hatred to the subjects brought up in the film.  But a film so original and so amazing on every level you can't go wrong on the caliber of how great this film really is. So watch for the weeks to come as the film will be blamed for violence that goes on around our country, seems that a lot of the best films released have gone through the same routine.  10/10",10,0,1,16 October 1999
Alien: Resurrection," a step in the wrong direction for the series
","What got me excited about this one in the series is that it (like Aliens) had more than one alien running around.  And in a few scenes they were a lot of fun to watch, especially the one underwater even though I have no idea how they were suppose to stay under that long.  It totally ruined itself at the end with an alien that couldn't look any dumber.  I left the theaters thinking it was so so and had some good scenes and was a little bit better than the third.  But a week or so later I popped the second one in my VCR again since it was my favorite in the series and released how much better it is than this one.  You may be amazed by the computer generated effects in the new one but if you look back at the second one you REALLY will think the special effects look better and are more appealing.  If they make another one, which if they do they better get it right this time, give us the feel, the action, and the suspense the first 2 gave us and make us really enjoy it.  I think putting James Cameron or Ripley Scott back in the directors chair would easily be enough to make another one that we will look back on as being one of the best in the series, from a series that is one of the best sci-fi series of all time.",Null,0,0,30 September 1998
Dead Poets Society," Inspiring would be the best used word to describe this film
","Dead Poets Society is like The Shawshank Redemption, it's so many different things at once.  It's uplifting, inspiring, dramatic, inspiring, emotional, inspiring, humorous, and did I mention inspiring?  It's probably one of the best dramas that have came out over the past 10 years, and I must say those who actually gave this film a 1 are probably the most idiotic down-right morons to ever review a film.  Robin Williams performance is alone worth a 7 not to mention the younger cast that's so good you just can't find in films today.  Peter Wier is an outstanding director, known well for launching Mel Gibson's career in Gallipoli and also Jim Carrey's first dramatic performance in The Truman Show.  The film moves at a rather slow pace and you don't realize how powerful it is until you reach the last 45 minutes of the film where the climax takes place.  There is so much to say about this film but one must see it for themselves.  It seems all schools show this film now as it is a prime example of an inspirational movie.  A must see.",Null,0,0,7 December 1999
Ed Wood," Just downright hilarious
","After you see this film, you'll want to run to your local video store and rent just about any Ed Wood film you can find.  Not to look at them and say how bad they are, but to look at them and just fall on the ground rolling how incredibly hilarious they are.  They really are that horrible!This is Johnny Deep at his finest.  He plays the role with so much charm and you just have a blast watching him.  Martin Landau is outstanding too, but overall this is Tim Burton's masterpiece.  There are so many moments in this film that should go down as the funniest moments in film history, like the scene with the fake octopus without the motor.  It's just hysterical.For those who are looking for a great comedy, look no futher.  Although some of the people today may be turned off by the black and white transfer, it only adds to the brilliance.  I just can't even begin to say enough about how big of a smile this movie puts on my face.  For those who haven't yet seen it, I envy your first viewing of it.",Null,0,0,19 March 2000
Armageddon," Armageddon delivers what is expected.
","Here is 1998's summer blockbuster which delivers exactly what you would expect it to.  The special effects are outstanding as we all hoped they would and as for the story, well you saw the previews so you knew what the plot was about.  Seeing the asteroid on the poster of the movie you knew it was going to be about an asteroid so the critics going off about the plot line is kinda pointless since it was well advertised as an asteroid in danger of destroying our world.  The one thing I wasn't expecting to see was emotional performances by Ben Affleck and Liv Tyler which brought me back to see this film for a second time and then a third for free.  Despite the long length and some dumb stunts you may laugh at, this is another Jerry Bruckhiemer film that deserves a glance.  Fans of his films should not be disappointed.",Null,1,1,17 September 1998
Saving Private Ryan," One of the most important films you will ever see
","Over the many years of films being released many have been named outstanding and have been given 4 stars.  The Godfather, Star Wars, The Usual Suspects, Pulp Fiction, and The Godfather Part II all stand a big place in film history.  However I was never expecting a film to be as important as Schindler's List until now and by the same director.  Steven Spielberg has once again made easily one of the best and most important films of all time. Many past war films have tried to be important but nothing has came as close to reality as Saving Private Ryan.  From the scenes of graphically violent war where gun shots are the only noise you can hear to the different aspects each character has it is definitely the most realistic war film ever made.  After seeing this film you will be reminded of the many people who have died for our freedom today and what it is really like to be on a battlefield.  Some people may find it to graphic to watch but must know that this is a true story and this is how graphic a war is.  Definitely one of the best films I have ever seen and if there are movies in the future that are even better than this one, not many will forget this film and many of the scenes you see in it will be kept in your head for many years to come.",10,0,0,17 September 1998
Mission: Impossible II," A truly awesome actioner, possibly the best since The Matrix
","To put it bluntly, this films kicks serious ass.  John Woo outdoes himself this time in possibly his best film ever, Hard Boiled being the only one to even come close.  The amount of intensity that develops throughout this film makes it a very high voltage thriller.  Tom Cruise is really cool in this, as you can really believe that he is an action star.  They said they wanted to make this film different than the previous, I did see quite a bit of simularities throughout.  In the end though, the last 25 minutes of this movie does so much that not even The Matrix can top.  The Wachoski Brothers and Robert Rodreguiz have all said they learned a lot from John Woo, who they claim to be the God of action directors.  Apparently Woo has also learned from them over the past few years and M:I 2 shows it.  This will be one of the highest, if not thee highest, grossing films of the year.Note to Paramount: make sure this is one outstanding DVD as it deserves.",Null,0,0,25 May 2000
Life Is Beautiful," One of the most beautiful films of all time
","This is truly one of the most amazing films I have ever seen.  It leaves you with tears coming down your eyes, very beautiful throughout.  Roberto is genius in this, I have to admit in the Academy Awards night I didn't understand why this film was winning the awards it did, especially Best Actor over Edward Nortan for American History X.  But after seeing it, in it's original (subtitled) version I must say it was even better than Saving Private Ryan as by far one of the best films of the year, and of past memories.  It's often hilarious, often sweet, sometimes tragic, but always beautiful.  This is a must see for just about anyone.  This is a film that you can call an 'instant classic.'",Null,1,2,25 October 1999
Eyes Wide Shut," An excellent final masterpiece by the best director of our time
","I have sat through this film twice in it's opening day and words themselves can't describe how brilliant Stanley Kubrick really is.  This is his 13th film, being known as the longest shoot in film history, and might just be as remembered by his fans right up there with A Clockwork Orange and 2001: A Space Odyssey.From those who have seen the previews or trailers and feel very interested in seeing the film, don't read the reviews that give away anything.  The less you know about the film the better it is and that is why nothing has been given away about the film until now as the critics release their reviews all over the nation.  For the full experience of Eyes Wide Shut, go in there with your interested mind only, and see where Kubrick brings you in this 'thriller about jealousy and sexual obsession.'  Those should be the only words that should sum up the plot for you, anything else would reveal too much.This is a film the Academy won't overlook.  Being the last film of Stanley's it's always to be remembered and I can see nominations already for Best Picture, Best Director (Kubrick), Best Actor (Cruise), Best Actress (Kidman), Best Supporting Actor (Pollack), Best Costume Design, Best Art Direction, Best Cinematography, and Best Editing all being announced as the next awards show comes early next year.Unfortunately we won't see the film Kubrick has intended us to see until it comes out on video.  It would have received an NC-17 which Warner Bros. was to afraid to accept so we must sit through a digitally-altered 65 second scene.  I don't think this film was intended for younger audiences in the first place, and defiantly not intended for film-goers who only want to see the sex between the two main leads.  This is an intelligent thriller, not an erotic pornography, so be prepared to see how far the film can take you. 10/10",10,0,0,16 July 1999
Titanic," 'blah blah blah fake characters... waste of 200 million... Leo sucks... all special effects' SHUDDUP
","Would you people give it up already?  Half of you haven't even seen the movie but you just like to criticize for no reason just like some of you probably did to Saving Private Ryan. 'Fake characters'  Ok lets think about this... how do you know they are fake?  Kate Winslet's Rose could have been like any rich person on the ship and Leo's character you don't have any record of just like you didn't have records of some of the real people that got on the ship by mugging passengers before they got on it.  So who cares if they are fake?  How dumb of an excuse is that to criticize this movie? 'Waste of 200 million'  yeah yeah right sure, not one of you could have come even close to making this the film it is.  'Leo sucks'  now you are just full of jealousy and since Leo is an overrated actor (I admit that he is) that since he's in the movie you have to say it's horrible.  Well for those of you who actually think that he is like the same character he is in The Man in the Iron Mask why don't you actually watch this movie because those of you that have said why it sucks is because of Leo have obviously not seen it.  His acting and many others are great in the film, ok maybe not outstanding but nor were the ones in Gone With The Wind, you just make them out to be.  'All special effects' yeah ok here are another group of people that didn't see the movie because the special effects don't really kick in into the last half hour of the film is with all those effects that you would actually notice to criticize.  They are throughout the film but they are so clear you don't realize it.  So why don't most of you just give it a rest because none of you have any idea what you are talking about you just figure since Titanic is the biggest film around you should criticize it.  You aren't Siskel and Ebert so no one really cares about your closed-minded opinions.  Some of you may feel it was overrated but just because of that dosen't make it suck.  I don't know one person or have seen one of your reviews that have gave such a real reason to criticize it.  It's only problem was the script and it wasn't a real problem.  So what if it had a few bad lines?  Not every film is written by Quentin Tarantino so you can't expect a Pulp Fiction in every script written.  So just do us all a favor.... either actually go and really watch the movie or SHUDDUP!!!!!",10,1,3,18 October 1998
The Green Mile," Very good film
","The Green Mile was an awesome film to say the least.  If you liked The Shawshank Redemption than you'll also love this.  It is however, far to long.  I realize that it was taking places over 6 very small novels by Stephen King but it still was far to long.  I didn't feel this way until I felt it was time for it to start wrapping up things and I kept on checking my watch for the next hour it dragged on for.There are some parts of this film that may stick in my head forever.  The mouse, the healings, and most of all the extremely disturbing death chair sequence towards the middle of the film.  The cast is all well done and it was also superbly directed.  The audience was in tears by the end of the film and I felt it too.  This is something that should be seen to be believed and by all means should not be ruined for anybody.Like I said, my only major problem with the film is the length of it.  The way it wrapped up took forever and a few parts just seemed to drag on for quite some time.  That would be one of the only reasons why I highly recommend seeing the flawless American Beauty over this, which is an hour shorter and is a visual masterpiece by all means.  Do not get me wrong though, this film is easily an 8 out of 10.",Null,0,0,27 December 1999
The Sixth Sense," A fair movie made into a damn good movie by it's ending, But come on, it ain't all that!
","I was brought back to see this film for a second time due to it's ending.  I saw it again and thought it was rather descent the second time around.  And I think when more people do that the hype is really gonna calm down.  After you aren't caught way off guard from the ending it's not THAT amazing.The best thing about this film was the kid, Harley Joel Osment.  He stole every scene in the film and was so perfectly casted.  If only they had him play Anakin Skywalker, we'd be talking masterpiece for George Lucas.  Bruce Willis did a fine job himself for a much calmer roll then he's used to.  The directing and writing are both put together nicely and it holds your attention throughout and gets you tense when it wants you to.The plot is so-so, nothing really new here other than being put together real well.  So what's my complain.  Well when Titanic came out and everyone was truly amazed by it and kept seeing it again some Leo guy haters had to ruin the movie and take it from #5 on the top 250 and sending it off the chart making it seem way overhyped.  So now a movie that really did deserve to be on the top 250 is knocked off even if it really did deserve Best Picture (come'on, if The Full Monty won would that make you happy?).  But if that was considered overhyped I can't wait to see this the same time next year.Yes, it had an amazing ending, maybe one of the best since The Usual Suspects.  But is it as good as The Usual Suspects?  Very far from it.  Is it better than Braveheart, Close Encounters, 2001, Fargo, or Reservoir Dogs to name a few?  Hell no!  It wasn't the best film of the year either.  The Blair Witch Project was creepier, The Matrix was more jawdropping, and Go was more enjoyable.  But yet all three of those don't seem to get nearly the amount attention as this, and it confuses the hell out of me.Next time please don't overhype a movie so much.  If you think it's good or it's great leave it at that.  The more hopes you get up for this film the more disappointed they'll be, especially when you think it's the best film you've ever seen.  7/10",Null,0,0,2 September 1999
Gladiator," Most enjoyable - Ridley Scott has made a great comeback
","After some dissapointments (G.I. Jane wasn't to great, and White Squall was lacking at the end) I'm glad to say Ridley Scott is back in his game.  I was looking forward to this film for awhile, it looked to be an impressive piece of cinema and plus, it had Russel Crowe in it.  After a few months of waiting for it to come to theaters, I was it opening day with a sold out crowd.  Everyone in the theater seemed to have really enjoyed it.  Some thought it was to long (drags a lil at the beginning), some thought it was to violent (guess they haven't seen Braveheart), but most of us thought it was excellent.I'm not gonna give anything away in this review like many have already done. I must say Ridley Scott hasn't had beautiful shots like this since Legend. The cinemtography really pulls you into the story - Rome has never looked this stunning.  The acting was oustanding on all counts, everyone was very well casted.  Above all, what hit me most about this movie wasn't the cinematography, nor the directing, nor the storyline.  It was Russel Crowe. This guy proves himself that he is the Marlon Brando of the new generation. He's wonderful as Maximus, some of the weakest lines in the film he makes them sound amazing.  I can only hope him and Edward Nortan, another actor who's amazing, will make a movie sometime together.As for my dislikes of the movie - the editing.  It's nice to see that a lot of people agree about how similar this is to Braveheart.  Mel Gibson and Ridley Scott are very different directors and Scott approached this as an in your face kind of thing.  For many scenes it dosen't bother you, but the opening battle and the first gladiator battle are very hard to follow because of this.  I wish some of the action scenes lasted longer than they did, although the battles in Rome are oustanding.  I wish I could have been able to tell what was going on a lot easier in the opening battle (the start of it as thousands of arrows fly through the air is magnificent) since everything happens very fast.Overall though I expect this to be one of the biggest hits of the summer. Maybe not in profit, but it has already made it on the top 250 so it seems most people love it.  This movie will make Russel Crowe standout soon enough as another 20 million dollar actor, and he deserves it more than anyone. If you have the time, and the taste for a good action/drama, see Gladiator. 9/10",Null,0,0,9 May 2000
High Fidelity," Early in this year there are still many great films on the way, but this one will stay my favorite throughout
","John Cusack is back on the turf where he was best at.  High Fidelity almost plays like a sequel to Say Anything, one of Cusack's first and best films. Throughout the years he's done some great stuff such as Grosse Pointe Blank, but it's great to see him take a role like his Lloyd character in Say Anything.  This film works on so many levels that it's hard not to like it. The best element that it offers is the same as Say Anything did, no matter how old you are, you can relate to what he's going through.  Some great supporting characters are seen here, his employees especially.  Tim Robbins and Catherine Zeta Jones do a great job with their cameos.  I've always liked John Cusack throughout his career, and High Fidelity only makes me like him more.  He really is one of the coolest actors out there and I hope we see more of this in the future.  It seems every time John and Joan are in a movie together the film automatically becomes great.  Screenwriters, Directors, and Actors take note, this is a comedy/drama you can learn a lot from.",Null,0,1,4 April 2000
The Godfather," The Great American Film
","Most say this is the best film in the history of film.  That statement is just about as true as they come.  Some say it's not the best film in the history of film.  That statement is also true, The Godfather II is equally as good and can be considered the best.  Then some say it doesn't even make their top 10.  That statement tells you that that person hasn't seen enough films. Finally there are some that say this film sucks.  Those people are an absolute disgrace to the history of film entirely and shouldn't comment on another film as long as they live. This film is as flawless as they come.  There is not one thing that can be considered wrong with it.  The directing, superb.  The acting, brilliant. The screenplay, outstanding.  The cinematography, far above it's time.  The film in general, one of the most stunning films ever made.This isn't a film you can rate on the 10 scale, because it's far above it. For those who haven't seen it, it's a must.  For those who say it's a poor film, like I said previously, they have no taste whatsoever in good films or they just try and get a rise out of just about every other person that hold their copies of the film with pride.  This is The Great American Film in all of it's glory.******************************",Null,0,1,29 February 2000
