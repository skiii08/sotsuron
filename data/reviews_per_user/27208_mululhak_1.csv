Iron Man 3," Worst Iron Man...so disappointed
",His suit didn't even work half the movie...he was looking for a way to charge it half the movie...he wasn't even in the suit half the movie...he makes iron man suit in a cave and has to improvise loss of his suit by going to a hardware store?? (Tony stark not only got shrapnel in his chest but some of it must of made its way to his brain...I mean lets just say Data from the Goonies was more innovative) My kids were bored more than half of this movie...don't pay full price to watch this movie. Wait till it comes out on regular television...better yet don't even waste your time unless of course you are use to disappointment.,2,4,8,4 May 2013
