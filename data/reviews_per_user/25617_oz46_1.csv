The King's Speech," A near perfect cinema experience
","Totally immersive and compelling cinema.....Who needs 3D glasses and CGI when you can watch this ??? I was transported instantly into the bizarre world of royalty in the 1930's and spent two hours in the company of characters who were wonderfully drawn and realised. There is not an ounce of flabbiness or a single wasted line in the script.... acting, even down to the corgis, is without fault and the cinematography is superbly atmospheric.This is a tragic, funny, heart-warming story, told without the usual Hollywood saccharin and great attention to detail. British Cinema at it's very, very best.Firth, Rush and Pearce are superb, and Bonham-Carter deserves at the very least an Oscar nomination..... rarely has so much been depicted by the twitch of a lip or raised eyebrow.If there was any justice it would grab a fistful of Oscars.",10,0,3,9 January 2011
