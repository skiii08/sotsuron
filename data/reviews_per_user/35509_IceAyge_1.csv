The Blair Witch Project," Creepy, Creepy!!
","It's been a good while since I seen a good Horror movie that delievers. Blair Witch did for me....I was hooked from the beginning.  I've heard mixed reactions from friends and others about how much this movie scared them. Well, it didnt scare me as much as I thought it would, but it is scary.  I think the most important thing to do when seeing this movie is USE YOUR IMAGINATION, don't shut out any possibility, and this movie will get you....it's creepy, it has good suspense and incredieble improvision. Although many people arn't probably going to figure this movie out because alot is left unsaid",Null,0,0,10 August 1999
