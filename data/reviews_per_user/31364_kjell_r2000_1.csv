Hereditary," Does anyone think this is scary?
","Had heard so much about how scary this movie was, and so it was with great expectations my girlfriend and I sat down to watch this.
And I must admit, this was about as scary as scary movie was. It is probably one of the biggest waste of someone's time ever. The thought that this movie can scare anyone above the age of five is extremely far fetched at best.",2,1,4,25 August 2018
