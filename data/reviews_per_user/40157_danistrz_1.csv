Requiem for a Dream," Emotional
","I just got done watching this film less than 10 min. ago. As a recommendation from my brother's friend, I sat down and watched a drama unfold to people unlike some of my friends. After the movie was completely over with did I realize that I was totally and utterly drained of emotion, energy, and anything one can possess at 2:30 in the morning. Still shaking as a type this, 'Requiem for a Dream' is all to true to what life is like... never will I look at any type of drug in the same way, never will I look at my friends who shoot up and not think of this movie. An amazing accomplishment by all who took part in this film. Haunting and horrific at the same time. I'll recommend it to anyone...",10,1,2,28 July 2004
