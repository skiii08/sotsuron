The Ring," Incredible Scary
","This movie is the scariest movie I have ever seen--EVER! My spine really started to tingle and it had shaking from fear after I finished watching. I went into The Ring thinking I would have my usual laugh fest but 5 minutes into the movie I realized I was in for a treat. Never before have I screamed in a 'scary' movie, but the Ring had me screaming like a girl! But, it was all in good fun and I could easily be scared multiple times watching the Ring over again. Watch this movie it WILL scare you!
P.S. The faces of the dead bodies creeped me out to DEATH! And also when I came home from the movie and turned on my TV, it was the same static screen as in the movie and I FREAKED OUT!",8,1,1,5 April 2003
12 Angry Men," Excellent, Classic and Powerful
","From the first time I read the play my sophomore year in high school, I was blown away by the power of this play. I felt in love and inspired from the play and went on to read it 5 more times. And when I watched the movie I was even more impressed. The makers and actors of 12 Angry Men did an excellent job in bringing the drama, emotion, and power of 12 Angry Men to life. This film is a undeniable classic packed with Hollywood legends. Everyone should at least see the movie and if they desire, read the play. 9/10",9,0,1,5 April 2003
Spirited Away," Awesome Film
","Spirited Away, I thought, was an incredible film for people of all ages and not just anime fans. The plot, animation, music, dialogue were all very impressive for an animated film. The film is full of humor, drama, love, and lots of heart. Personally, I'm not a big expert on anime films or cartoons, but I've seen a few and Spirited Away blows them all out of the water. Watching this film is an awesome experience and I recommend everyone to see it. 9/10!",9,0,1,5 April 2003
