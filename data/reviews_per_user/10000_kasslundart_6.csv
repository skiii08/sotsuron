",I liked this movie a lot. Before watching this movie i didn't really know who Johnny Cash was. It is a good representation of him and also it helps you realize that people turned to music in this war time period. I will admit i didn't like the middle because it turned the way i didn't want it to turn but it kept you on the edge of your seat. I noticed they smoked a lot which helps us watchers realize what time period this is. Even with the switch in the middle it was great and ended great and i learned more about a famous singer who i didn't really know anything about.,8,1,1,29 January 2019

","I loved this movie. I have this this movie before and have just decided to watch it and it is fantastic. It is in of the better colored movies i have. The emotion in it was great. I loved how it captured the reality of the colored. Today people are treated as equal, well sometimes. Its unfortunate for those who do not get treated as an equal. I loved how Jackie overcame all the name calling and played a thing he loved. He did get put down yes but i think it was the key point of it all because if it wasn't for him things might not have changed and the perspective of colored would not have changed.",10,1,2,12 February 2019

",I loved this movie. I donÂ´t know much about NASA or what goes on. This was a cool representation of how NASA dealt with the color separation. They didn't much care for what color you were only to make sure that the person that was getting sent into space was safe and they wouldn't care who did it but they needed someone to calculate the math and they just needed it done no matter the skin color. Also the fact that they were ladies put a bigger problem but NASA just wanted their calculations correct no matter the cost. And even though their was problems with the colored section people accepted the ladies because they could do things no other person could and their math and calculations and brains were better then any white male or white women. It was also really cool how you saw what the difference was in a situation where its an enclosed space compared to the world.,10,1,5,4 March 2019

","Overall i really liked this movie. I think it was a great representation of what went on when communism was a big deal. You got the black and white covered along with how people didn't know the dangers of smoking so everyone had a cigarette in hand. If you look at the entire film there is a lot of information i think you covered really well. One of the things i think you betrayed really well was what false accusations did to some people. The part where a reporter committed suicide was a great representation of how far some people pushed with accusing. You also did a good job at representing the checks and balances. When McCarthy accused pretty much anybody of communism, checks and balances stepped in and silenced him because he never had evidence to back himself up. There was some background that i think you needed to know for the movie to understand it but over all it was really good.",8,0,0,23 January 2019

",I love Star wars and i love the music and the characters and everything. Its crazy to see how times have definitely changed with how technology has come. This is definitely an old movie but it is a great start to a bunch of movies to come after this one. The next ones are great but this first one is great.There isn't much to say other then i love it and it brings back a lot of memories.,10,0,0,26 April 2019
Back to the Future," Love this
",This was a really good movie. I loved how you separated the two different time periods. The differences you put in there like their clothes and inventions that were created. I loved the excitement in the film with what he is going to do with his mom in high school and how he supposed to get his mom and dad together again. I also love how things changed with the littlest changes in the past. This was an exciting film all together.,10,0,0,4 February 2019
