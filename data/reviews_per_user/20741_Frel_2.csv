50 First Dates," Actually quite funny
","Adam Sandler is a hero to me after starring in Punch Drunk Love. Of course, this film is quite different, but altogether pretty funny.Apart from Rob Schneider, of course. I don't know if it made a lot of sense in a psycho-medical way (there are some discussions about that on this site, I noticed) but I liked watching it, although it did not strike me as a very convincing story. The happy ending (is this even a spoiler?) made me smile contently. Too bad they had to use another movie's song to make this scene extra smooth, although it is a very nice song ('Somewhere over the Rainbow', performed by Israel Kamakawiwo'ole).This film pretty much lived op to my (none-too-high) expectations.",7,0,0,10 August 2005
The Pianist," Language
","Movies like this one always remind me of the self-centeredness of most Americans (and American movie makers). Apart from this film being a beautiful epic movie (bla bla), isn't it a highly disturbing and even ruining experience to watch a Polish family speak English with an totally non-Polish accent! What is that?! How come the Americans put up with that crap? I'm sure I would scream with laughter when in a Dutch movie about WW2 the Americans would all speak Dutch! That would be totally ridiculous. Then again, The Netherlands is one of the few European countries who do not dub movies (whereas in France and Germany all original voices are replaced by voices in the mother tongue). I just can't accept a French speaking Arnold Schwarzenegger, nor can I accept an American speaking Polish family. Those things pretty much ruin movies for me. I'll eat my hat when the American self-centredness would disappear. My experience is that they just don't care. Poland, Holland, Germany, Hungary, Bosnia: what the hell, it's all the same, innit? Like the word for the Dutch language: 'Dutch'. That means 'Deutsch', which means German. Who cares, we can't understand neither one of 'em, right?Just keep on letting Polish people speak English with each other, that makes the world much easier to understand.",Null,0,1,10 November 2003
