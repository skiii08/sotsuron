Hereditary," huge disappointment!!
","Before watching this movie , i was getting my hopes up to see a real interesting horror movie with some enjoyable story , unfortunately, this movie was boring , at the fist 30 min i thought that the events weren't that interesting because they were just setting up the story for the later but as the movies carries on nothing change until this very stupid twist at the end !! first of all there are some things i need to point out , like how the hell the mom let her daughter go to a party with her brother and surely she knows there will be alcohol and everyone will be smoking there and how his brother just approved and not even tried to argue with his mom , this looked stupid to be honest ! the boy after the accident in which he caused his sister to die , he never got any medical assistance or anything , just resumed his life like nothing happened !! the movies is extremely boring and lifeless , despite the good acting but you feel there is no connection between characters , it was like repeating the same similar scenes over and over ,' the wife and her husband in bedroom and probably she can't sleep , the boy either in his bed or just shwoing him at school always distracted and not paying attention to the professor , the father has no importance in this movie and so on repeating the same thing for 2 hours !! i just fel disappointed and not what i expected",4,3,4,24 November 2019
Us," too many plot holes but still worth watching
","I have seen too many people have rated 1 or 2 for this movie here and i can say i fully understand their reasons , at some point while i was wactching i though too that when i am done watching i will give it 3 , but the unexpected ending and the moral of the story which made sense made me change my mind , there is too many plot holes to be honest like how the clones got those clothes and scissors !!or how on earth can the government created a clone for every single person , that's impossible !!! i think the movie highlight very important issues in our lives , i believe that the real world above is a representation of our conscious self and what we like to display to the world and the underground society represents the daker side of ourselves and how our deep nature and how it is witout make up , i think the switch that happened means that when we are able to deal with our deepest fears and accept it as it it is ,we can live a blessed and calm life and that manifested in the mother who was a clone and was able to live in the upper society as a normal person and live in harmony with others",7,0,0,27 October 2019
Oldboy," Overrated !!!
","I have no idea why people rated 9 and 10 for this movie, did i watch some other movie or something!! The script is written badly, the acting is crap , violence in this movie is unnecessary ! I was actually laughing in that fighting scene in the hall ! They were like 50 one and they were afraid to come close to him even though they were armed with sticks and eventually he beats them all , this was the stupidest thing i have ever seen in any movie, the only reason i decided to watch this is because of its hight rating and promising story , reading that the story is about a man kidnapped and imprisoned for 15 years without knowing who did this and why will definitely draw anyone's attention and that's what happened, my hopes were up for this movie but i felt disappointed, the characters were so cold , you feel that they are amateurs!! & Poor dialogues it's just silly conversations between these characters , the twist at the end is just ridiculous , i can't believe he dedicated 15 years of his life to torture him just because he spread a rumor about him and his sister and that he saw them having sex , is that the best idea this director has for the story ??? Just don't waste your two valuable hours to watch this movie that's my advice for you",5,5,17,1 December 2019
Mission: Impossible - Rogue Nation," Just like previous movies!
","Lot of suspense and enjoyable to watch, just like other missions, predictable but still fun to watch , however, i do want to point something out since some scenes are filmed in Morocco (my country) , i do not know why they always try to show Morocco as just a desert!! In all hollywood movies, they try to show that Morocco is just a desert! The funny thing was that in this movie a desert was shown and then beneath it they wrote 'casablanca' ! Is that a joke !! This is not casablanca!! The desert they showed is like 500 kilometers from casablanca!!",7,0,1,22 November 2019
The Machinist," Interesting!
","I have seen this movie many years ago and i decided to watch it again today to appreciate it , i did like it very much , the protagonist is just brilliant, he lost his weight for the sake of the movie and his acting is just amazing, the atmosphere of the movie is just brilliant, too dark and disturbing giving the audience a clue to how the main character sees the world according to his perspective as he hasn't slept for a year , i know that some people wouldn't like it because it was predictable cause from the moment he was told that someone named ivan doesn't exist i knew from that moment that he is disturbed because of the deprivation of sleep for too long but still fun and enjoyable to watch",8,1,2,25 November 2019
The Game," Logic is insulted!!!
","I am pretty sure that those who rated this movie 9 and 10 are the ones who watch the movies just to spend time and enjoy it not caring if it makes sense or not !! But i am not one of those , my mind always tries to analyze things , this movie started very well , the script is good , the acting is perfect but the end doesn't make sense , so this whole thing is just one big prank his brother has made just to say happy Birthday to his brother ? Seriously!! First of all , how you not take into consideration that if you took all his money and made all this that he won't have a breakdown and just kill himself ?? Second how on earth they know exactly what he is going to do next every time ? This is impossible!! Third do you think if someone does all this pranks and then he tells you that and you will just hug him like nothing happened? I bet no one can do that , the least anyone can do is that he would be so angry and maybe end his relationship with him even if it is a brother or father or anyone cause that was too much !! Finally the final scene when he jumped! Omg !! Who told them that he will jump to this exact spot ???? Who even told them that he is going to jump anyway!!! Please have some respect to logic and to the audience's brains , this was ridiculous!!",5,2,8,6 December 2019
The Curious Case of Benjamin Button," Just Magnificent !!!
","This movie has changed my thinking for time and made look at it from a different perspective, getting older or younger as the time pass by has the same conclusion, i just loved the idea and brad in this movies did really good job , definitely one of the best i have ever seen , just love it",9,0,0,14 November 2019
1917," Cinematography is excellent! Something else ? Mmm i am not sure
","I believe that this movie is just good , not too bad and not great at the same time , to be fair the cinematography in this movie is possibly the only thing that was amazing, rather than that i didn't feel i enjoyed it , the cinematography itself has flaws , some scenes are soo long , you see those two soldiers walk for 5 minutes and they just talk and tell some random boring stories and almost i fell asleep in some scenes, plus some plot holes , i don't know about explosives but with that explosion in that narrow room i think it would cause more damage to the two soldiers than what we saw in the movie , this movie in my opinion deserves no more than 7,5",7,3,5,21 March 2020
Joker," Brilliant acting but the story could have been more better
","Since this movie released and with all the hypes and compliments of too many reviews, i was getting my hopes up and i waited until now to watch the movie with a high quality but maybe i should never get my hopes up and always expect the least, don't get me wrong , the movie is very interesting really i liked it very much but doesn't deserve all this hypes , first the acting was truly amazing , Joaquin did very good job , one of his best performances ever , the cinematography and music made the scenes look tense and real and i loved that, the path the story took is logical and made sense yes but i guess that was not enough cause after all , there wasn't something interesting happened in the movie , it's just a story of a guy who is already unstable and the society has made worse for him and he become a murderer ! I didn't see anything special about the character rather than his great acting ! The movie is great but if you want to enjoy it i suggest you don't get your hopes up and expect the least , the movie deserves 8,5 in my opinion",8,1,5,21 December 2019
Parasite," just watch it
","This is one of the best movies of this year , what i like about it is that from the very beggining until the end you never blink an eye , the events getting more exciting as you watch , and the idea of the movie is brilliant , classism in this movie is perfectly displayed and the idea is different , i really enjoyed it and highly recommand it",8,0,2,4 November 2019
Green Book," Amazing !
","I have already seen Ali in 'true detective ' , he is a great actor and this role he was given in this movie is perfect, i don't know why people say this movie was predictable ! This is a biography , it's a based on true story !! So obviously the director shouldn't change much of it , i enjoyed the movie the connection between the two characters is great , the movie deals with a very sensitive issue back in the sixties in the United state and also present the importance of family ,the sparsity between the wealth and the poor and many other things , it was worth watching truly",9,1,2,15 December 2019
