Miracle," Awesome film, plain and simple. Kurt Russell really outdoes himself in this one.
","What a well-done film, all the way through!  Kurt Russell is amazing as Herb Brooks and everyone in the film was great!  Me, being a rookie hockey fan loved to see one of the greatest moments in sports be portrayed so well! Go see it!!",9,0,0,6 February 2004
