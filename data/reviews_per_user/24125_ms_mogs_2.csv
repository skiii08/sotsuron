Walk the Line," Dancing on the line
","It's tough for a movie to appeal beyond its target audience, but this one does. It all starts with Joaquin Phoenix, completely immersed in his role as Johnny Cash. So when an irresistible force (Reese Witherspoon) meets that immovable object, it must have been a lot like the chemistry really created between Johnny and June Carter. And they can sing too. But that's not where the movie's charms end, legendary performers (Elvis, Jerry Lee Lewis, Roy Orbison, Waylon Jennings and the Carters) -- who haven't come to life in biopics about those legends -- flesh out and add to the story. Last year, I was bemoaning that despite Jamie Foxx's tremendous portrayal of Ray Charles, the film itself was lacking. Not so here. Impossibly, unbelievably, ecstatically not so here.",9,0,1,29 December 2005
Munich," Spielberg breaks new ground
","This film has stirred up a wide variety of reactions, from the typical unjustified criticism provided by people who won't even see the film to the fluffier question of whether or not Steven Spielberg regains his status as film's top director from Peter Jackson. All of those miss the point. What Munich REALLY accomplishes is the deglorification of violence in entertainment through its story of a vengeance squad put together to hunt down and kill those involved in the murder of Israeli athletes at the 1972 Olymkpics. And he doesn't do it by force-feeding the audience, just with Hitchcockian style behind the camera, a questioning script and an unassuming -- but brilliant -- cast led by Eric Bana.",9,0,3,30 December 2005
