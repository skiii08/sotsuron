Requiem for a Dream," Pretentious Overrated Plop
","I wasted valuable time in my life watching this load of plop, all because of the high rating and accolades this film has received. This was a totally pointless movie...we already know that drugs are bad and that it destroys lives! You see events occur in the film but NOTHING actually HAPPENS -- how can this be? There is no development, nothing. I'm offended that I wasted valuable time watching this garbage, which I won't get back in my life.",1,2,4,26 November 2018
