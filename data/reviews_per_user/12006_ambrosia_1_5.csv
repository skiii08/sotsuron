Stop-Loss," Decent movie, but tried too hard not to put off those with differing views.
","(I rated the movie 6, not because it is bad, but because it is better than average. Not an instant classic, not action-packed, but not overly preachy.) If you are with other people of differing political views, no one is going to leave this movie feeling their position was disparaged. But neither will anyone leave feeling 'vindicated' by their views. As such, the movie fails to be deeply satisfying for either audience and thus, hasn't done better at the box office.'Stop-Loss' takes a cue from another politically-themed movie, 'Shooter', pairing the lead character with his best friends' finance' as he seeks to fight the 'injustice' done to him by his 'Stop-Loss'.As I've said, while decent, 'Stop-Loss' tries too hard not to offend those with differing political views. Problem is, the very theme of the movie is to criticize a current and highly questionable military practice, so trying not to offend Conservative viewers is a complete waste since they are not the ones coming to see such a movie, and you fail to give the other 80% of movie goers that would have no problem listening to criticism of the government, what they expect.All of the soldiers in Shadow-3, including the main character, are all dedicated soldiers that believe in the job they are doing, though maybe not the way they are being told to do it. Criticism of 'policy' is rare and criticism of the government in the movie is nonexistent, thus coming off as less than truthful trying so hard not to offend movie goers of either persuasion.A good movie, decently acted, even with the over-the-top and clich√©d' portrayal of life in Texas. It will hold your attention and you will be interested in seeing how the story plays out, so in that regard, a movie worth seeing no matter your political persuasion, and good for mixed groups with varying views.",6,6,14,4 April 2008
Knowing," Plot holes, intuitive leaps and religious innuendo?
","If, like me, you expect to see a movie about Cage running around trying to prevent incredible heart-stopping disasters from occurring before they happen (as any logical plot would of taken), you're going to be sorely disappointed.I've seen a number of films where I expected one thing and got something else entirely. While that's not always a bad thing, sometimes the alternate path turns out to be ruinous. Such is the case with 'Know1ng'.First off, the way in which Cage's character first comes to realize the list is more than just a list of random numbers requires an ENORMOUS amount of forgiveness on the part of the viewer (Cage *just happens* to pick THAT particular sequence of numbers and JUST HAPPENS to break them up in a way that looks like dates without ACTUALLY breaking the numbers up into dates (clue: there is no '91st' minute, hour, day or month, so why did he separate it that way??? No logic behind it.) He's an MIT professor, so I guess we're not supposed to be smart enough to understand his thought pattern? Then Cage's character makes some intuitive leaps based upon mere coincidence. One or the other would already require a suspension of disbelief, but PLEASE don't compound them. Believing one coincidence is bad enough.The final disastrous straw is when the movie moves headlong... and entirely unnecessarily... into Religious innuendo. I won't spoil it for you if that's the kind of thing that might attract you to this movie, but 'Know1ng' turns out to be a vehicle simply for pushing 'Chri-Fi' (religious science fiction).All-in-all, an enormous disappointment. The movie could of been a great action flick but instead tries SO hard to be something it's not, that it eventually becomes something else entirely. If you're still curious, wait for the video.",3,6,14,29 March 2009
Salt," If you read only one review...
","Let's keep this simple (because the writers sure didn't)...Anyone that rates this movie a 1 or 2 just can't be pleased. If they rate it a 9 or 10, they are WAY too easy to please.Salt is a John LeCarre style spy thriller, with a fairly implausible premise, and a couple of plot twists that you eventually have to relax and just 'go with', or else allow them to spoil an otherwise decent picture.Without giving anything away, Salt is an American CIA agent. One of the best. A Russian agent wishing to defect to America is brought into the CIA where he is debriefed by Salt (an expert on Russian spies), where he reveals that someone at the CIA named 'Evelin Salt' is actually a Russian spy. This is a big deal for Salt for reasons that are made clear in the movies' opening sequence. Soon Salt finds herself on the run from the CIA while the audience (at least those not paying attention) are left to wonder, 'Is she a spy or isn't she?' If you pay attention, you'll know the answer right away, and the movie becomes purely an action flick. If you are easily fooled or otherwise aren't paying attention, you may find yourself guessing almost up until the end (but if you haven't figured it out halfway thru the film, you're probably too dumb to have found the theater in the first place.) It's not Shakespeare, but it's not Plan 9 either. The film feels like one long action sequence that holds your attention till the end (which comes quickly, trimming the film to barely more than 90 minutes because of its frantic pace).Jolie has the dramatic thing down pat in her career, but has been searching for a good action franchise for years (most notably the disappointing Tomb Raider series) without much success. Salt has the potential of turning into a decent female James Bond-esq franchise for Jolie, if they can just move past the sloppy plot formulation.Bottom-line, if you see it, you won't come away feeling you wasted $9. If you can handle a decent action movie containing a number of weak plot-twists without groaning, you'll come away pleased. In all, a 6.5 is about right ratings-wise. Good, not great. Better than average despite weak writing.",7,4,13,25 July 2010
Dunkirk," Powerful story poorly told. Know your history.
","There are NO spoilers in this review, but some helpful information to understand it if you see it.This movie is based on the true story about the rescue of over 300,000 (out of 400K) British solders during WWII. I went into this movie believing the soldiers were POW's in a camp and most of the story would be about *them*. THEY ARE NOT. The troops are 'stranded' on the beaches of France, cut off from England a mere 22 miles across the English Channel. Cut off by land by Nazi troops (whom we never see) and by sea in the heavily patrolled waters by German planes & 'U-boats' ('Underwater boats', aka: submarines.) The movie is told in three parts (actually 4): Land, Sea (2 sea stories) & Air... but the movie expects you to figure that out for yourself, making things quite confusing. Part one is 'The Mole' and takes place over the course of a week, but here, a 'mole' isn't a 'spy', it's a French word for extended shoreline/pier. It would have helped immensely if the screen told you this was '*STORY* 1: The Beach' instead of '1. The Mole'. I spent the first hour trying to figure out who the Spy was (and the paranoia of some of the soldiers didn't help.) The movie is well acted (and LOUD), a lesson in one of Britain's proudest moments, but the telling of that story is too disjointed... a prime example of why writers should not direct their own movies (and vice versa.) Christopher Nolan (Director of the Batman films) both wrote & directed Dunkirk. He's a great director, but should have outsourced the writing to someone with more experience.I rated this a 5. Deserves at least a 7.5 for the story & production quality, but is just so damn disjointed, everyone who sees it says they would need to see it again 'now that they understand what was going on.' But no one wants to see a movie twice just because they feel they HAVE to to enjoy it *once*. :(",5,6,10,5 August 2017
Super 8," Another JJ Abrams 'stone soup' hack flick.
","Short review: One part 'Wargames' sans the kid genius and super computer, two parts 'Close Encounters' down to the late 70's setting but sans the friendly humanoids, and one part E.T., again, sans the friendly alien. THERE. I just saved you $8 bucks ($50 if it's a family affair with popcorn).Long review. Abrams has a stock formula he uses again and again. Rip off an established film or films, tweak it just enough to turn it into something that 'appears' original, throw in a bit of action scenes, only to discover by the end he has no way to end his story, wrapping everything up in an unsatisfying 5 minute conclusion that is full of plot holes.He did this with his TV series' 'Alias', and most recently with 'Lost'. 'Alias' was just a female James Bond; 'Lost' was 'Gilligan's Island' meets 'Indiana Jones'. Neither of which ended well. And such is the case here with 'Super 8'. If you expect more from your movies but are still intrigued, wait for the DVD.",2,0,1,23 July 2011
