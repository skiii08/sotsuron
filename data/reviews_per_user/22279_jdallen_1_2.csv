Changeling," Whiny, veiny, and loud- Angelina at her worst
","I cannot fathom how many commentors have given this movie such a good rating. I'm so annoyed by this, that I am inspired to write my first ever review.The only reason I didn't give it a 1 out of 10 is that the old cars were sweet.Above all the other pathetic elements of this movie was Angelina's blatant overacting. She was screechy, veiny, fakely teary, and loud. I guess the paltry dialogue isn't strictly her fault, but if I had to hear her bleat the words 'MY SON' one more time, my eardrums would hopefully have imploded. Couldn't Clint have switched it up with the kid's name, or 'MY KID,' or 'MY CHILD?' Just to keep things fresh, you know? The plot- Law and Order: 1920's. That simple. Psycho kills kids. Cops evilly bungle around (except for one heroic one, who eventually solves the case). One kid (coincidentally Jolie's SON, HER SON!!!) acts heroically, because he's just that cool. Seriously, just watch Law and Order- better plot, none of the MY SON, MY SON.One last thing- are we really to believe that Angelina is so whimperingly timid and passive at the beginning of the movie that she can't say 'uh, this ain't my kid' when presented by the wrong twerp, but by the end she's a female gladiator/crusader for justice? Gimme a break.I hope she never found the stupid kid. No sympathy for the woman, more like hatred.",2,10,23,27 February 2009
In Bruges," Great movie- very funny.
","Entirely enjoyable and unusual. Great acting, writing, and execution. Not perfect, but nearly so.Colin Ferrell gives a particularly convincing performance.My favorite part is the scene near the end when Harry agrees to allow Ferrell's character to try to escape in the canal in order to avoid shooting around the pregnant hotelier. The innkeeper says- 'you guys are weird.' Ha ha.Only reason I don't give it a ten is that it wasn't longer.Oddly, the trailer gave no indication of what a good movie it is. Just goes to show, you never know until you actually watch it.",9,1,3,7 March 2009
