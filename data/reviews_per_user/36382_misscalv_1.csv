The Equalizer," Way too much action
","The movie starts kinda slow, with Robert McCall (Denzel Washington) doing his daily routine. It is sort of essential for the movie to show how he lives now appose to how he lived before (and will live later), so I get it, but I still think they should have cut some of it but okay. And then the action starts when the store he works in gets robbed and Teri (ChloÃ« Grace Moretz) gets beaten up by the Russians. And the first fight sequence happens, and it's epic when he kills all the Russians and in that moment the movie is awesome.But then it just goes downhill from there. You kinda get to know more about who he was before but not really, and you don't get to see Teri before the end of the movie again. So basically the rest of the movie is just him killing people to get revenge and stay alive, and it gets old, really fast. This movie just has too much action and are lacking a solid story, and that's why it really bored me and the only reason I give it a 4 and not a 2, is because I think the movie had some great actors. If the sequel does happen I really hope there is less action but i doubt it because of how this one ended, so I'll probably wont go see it.",4,2,5,1 November 2014
