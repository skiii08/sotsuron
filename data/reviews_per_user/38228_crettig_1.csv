The Blair Witch Project," ZZZZZZZzzzzzz....
","I've read some reviews stating this movie is 'the scariest movie since The Exorcist.'  Hardly.  What we've got are three individuals who needed culled from the genepool anyway go into a woods, do everything wrong, and then get conked on the head.  Yippee!  That was worth six bucks!  Take your money and buy a Lovecraft novel if you want real horror.  This was just crud, pure and simple.",1,1,2,10 August 1999
