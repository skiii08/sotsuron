Resident Evil: Afterlife," Fourth 'Resident Evil' is certainly the best of the sequels.
","Alice (Milla Jovovich) and her clones tries to kill Albert Webster (Shawn Roberts) from the Umbrella Coporation in his base at Japan. But Alice and her clones failed the mission. Now Alice is trying to find the survivors safe haven known as 'Arcadia' in Alaska. Which her friends went there for help but once she arrives, she finds no one there but Claire (Ali Larter), who lost her memory and she seemed to be control by a device on her chest made from Umbrella Coporation. Now Alice goes to Los Angeles to find any survivors along with Claire. They find some survivors (Wentworth Miller, Boris Kodjoe, Kim Coates, Kacey Barnfield, Norman Yeung, Sergio Peris-Mencheta and Fulvio Cecere) living in a Maximum Security Prison. Alice finds out from the the survivors that 'Arcadia' is actually a cargo tanker travelling along the coast. Which Alice, Claire and the survivors are very close to 'Arcadia' but having trouble how to get there. While new mutations from Umbrella Coporation are trying to kill the remaining survivors by somehow getting into the prison. Which the group of survivors have to find an new way to get to 'Arcadia' and helping each other to survive.Written and Directed by Paul W.S. Anderson (Alien Vs. Predator, Death Race, Event Horizon) made an entertaining, action, sci-fi/horror third sequel to the profitable 'Resident Evil' series, which (obviously) is based on a popular video game. Jovovich is game as always in the movie. While Larter, Miller and Kodjoe are fine in their roles. While Roberts certainly having fun with his role. This time, Writer and Director:Anderson certainly takes his premise more seriously this time around. Although it doesn't stop Anderson increasing his visual style by giving tribute to 'The Matrix' and two John Carpenter films like 'Escape from New York' (Which for some reason an few of the prison sequences reminded me a lot of that movie) and 'The Thing'.There is no doubt that Anderson is planning 'Resident Evil 5' and probably 'Resident Evil 6'. Hopefully, if Anderson has an few more tricks up his sleeve. For sure, the future sequels of 'Resident Evil' should be good. I seen this movie only on the regular 2-D version. The movie looked good, despite some very obvious 3-D moments. 'Resident Evil:Afterlife' is certainly an improvement over the semi-lame/mess 'Resident Evil:Apocalyspe' and reasonably entertaining 'Resident Evil:Extinction'. Perphas not much Zombie action for some tastes. If you enjoy the games or better yet, the 'RE' series, you will be entertained. Good music score by tomandandy (The Hills Have Eyes '2006', The Rules of Attraction, The Strangers). Super 35. (****/*****).",8,3,8,15 October 2010

This movie has some fascinating ideas. Washington as usual gives an excellent performance in this. Caviezel offers an change of pace role in this and it is also the first time, he plays a bad guy. The film has good roles for the supporting cast like Bruce Greenwood, Adam Goldberg, Elden Henson and Erika Alexander. But the film went on to be an box office disappointing in the U.S. (It did quite well in Overseas) and it is Scott's first PG-13 since 'Days of Thunder'.DVD has an sharp anamorphic Widescreen (2.35:1) transfer and an strong Dolby Digital 5.1 Surround Sound.

Which there's no commentary track from the movie for some reason. There's rumours that Scott might release an Unrated Version of the picture in the near future. This thriller is well made, it's entertaining but it's goes on longer than it should. Some viewers might find this confusing or predictable but It's pretty good solid entertainment. Don't miss it.

This is based upon the short story by the late Philip K. Dick (Blade Runner, A Scanner Darkly, Total Recall). Cruise is very effective as the elite D.C. cop, who is haunting by the troubled memories of his past. Two-Time Oscar Winner Janusz Kaminski's cinematography is visually arresting with Alex McDowell's (The Crow, Dark City, The Lawnmover Man) great production designs. Also the Oscar-winning visual effects company Industrial, Light and Magic (ILM) are superb.The two disc set of 'Minority Report' offers some fine special features (Which are mostly featurettes).

Samantha Morton is memorable as the strongest of the three PreCogs Agatha. 'Minority Report' is no doubt entertaining but it's a bit too long. Since it's Spielberg's first film noir set in the future is quite harsh. One of the highlights is Five-Time Oscar Winner John Williams' (Star Wars Series, Empire of the Sun, War of the Worlds '2005') excellent music score. Look out for small surprise cameos and Jessica Harper (Best known from 'Phantom of the Paradise' and 'Suspiria'), Peter Stormare & Arye Gross in strong bit-parts. Don't miss it. Super 35.

Although Ray is battling with depression after his first hit.Written and Directed by Martin McDonagh made an fresh, intriguing, darkly funny comedy that has hints of drama and sadness as well. McDonagh's premise could have been really cliché, there's plenty of movies about Hit-Mans. Also his movie doesn't try to be cool as well, which it's quite unique. Farrell is excellent in the picture, i haven't seen him this good in a movie (Although his dialogue are hard to understand at times, since he has a thick Irish accent). Gleeson is terrific as well. Poséy is certainly a great talent to watch for, since she's very beautiful as well. Fiennes is a hoot as the vulgar boss, which his dialogue are hilarious. Jordan Prentice is also good as the racist drug-user dwarf actor.DVD has an sharp anamorphic Widescreen (2.35:1) transfer and an good Dolby Digital 5.1 Surround Sound. I would have love to get an running commentary track by the filmmaker or even from the cast members but sadly we didn't get it.

But his idol isn't what he seems to be and Renard kidnaps Rayburn's son. Which Rayburn has to promise a couple of home runs to his son alive. Which Renard might do something unpleasant to his son.Directed by Tony Scott (Crimson Tide, Man on Fire '2004', Revenge) made an stylish, entertaining thriller with some dark humour and suspense. This film is certainly familiar, because it's not the first time where De Niro plays the psychopath. But De Niro is so good in the lead, he always do sometimes different. When he plays the psychopath each time. Snipes is good in the movie as well. The film has John Leguizamo and Ellen Barkin in fine supporting roles.The original DVD has an sharp anamorphic Widescreen (2.35:1) transfer (also in Pan & Scan) and an strong:Dolby Digital 5.1 Surround Sound. The DVD only feature is a collector's booklet. This thriller was an box office disappointment, probably due of a bad release date and bad marketing as well. Mixed reviews didn't helped the picture as well. De Niro's creepy, menacing, darkly funny performance makes this forgotten film worth watchable. This movie makes good use of songs from bands like 'The Rolling Stones' and 'Nine Inch Nails'. Watch closely for Jack Black in some scenes as a Broadcast Technician. Based on a novel by Peter Abrahams. Screenplay by Pheof Sutton. Panavision. (****/*****).",8,3,5,12 August 2007
Dawn of the Dead," Finally One of the Few Horror Remakes is Done Right.
","Gruesome... But this surprisingly entertaining remake of the original 1979 classic from George A. Romero (Which Romero will have his fourth Zombie film 'Land of the Dead' will be released this summer). Which it has the same basic idea from the original but different in tone and a new set of characters for this updated remake. When a group of survivors (Sarah Polley, Ving Rhames, Jake Weber, Mekhi Phifer, Ty Burrell, Micheal Kelly, Kevin Zegers, Micheal Berry, Inna Korobkina, Lindy Booth, Kim Poirier, Boyd Banks, R.D. Reid, Jayne Eastwood and Matt Frewer) decide to take refuge on an abandon Shopping Mall hiding from mindless, flesh-eating zombies. Trying to Survive, while the human race is becoming erased and only becoming a bed-time story for campfire tales. Those handful of survivors are trying fight a desperate battle between the survivors and these zombies but only to stay alive.This remake is directed by first time filmmaker-Zack Snyder (Snyder's next film is Rainbow Six and 300). Snyder brings a lot of energy and style to this now-familiar story but equally impressive film. This remake is exciting, violent, funny and even touching. The film also has as well of some disturbing scenes. Original Dawn-Romero's message on commercialism is lost (Since the shopping malls is outmoded anyway). Synder brings some terrific action sequences towards the third act of the film. Synder is certainly new talented director with good movies for him to come. He's one of the few movie directors that Hollywood should watch for. One of the producers of this remake is Richard P. Rubinstein (Who produced the original Romero's classic). Rubinstein is one of few people, who stayed to be involved with the remake. Tom Savini (Who was the make-up effects artist and also had a bit part as Blades), Scott H. Reiniger (Who played one of the heroes:Roger) and Ken Foree (Who played the lead hero:Peter) do excellent cameos for this remake. The Unrated Director's Cut of the Remake is certainly much better than the original theatrical release not because of the extra gore or a bit more of characters development. The Unrated Director's Cut actually corrected some of the continuity story errors from the R-Rated Version and it also make a bit more sense. Sure, the remake has a few plot holes and maybe a bit too much characters are not enough focus in this remake (Since Jake Weber is the most focus character in the remake). But this new Dawn is well cast with good performances.DVD has an sharp anamorphic widescreen (2.35:1) transfer and an superb-Dolby Digital 5.1 Surround Sound. DVD has an engaging Commentary track by Director:Zack Synder and Producer:Eric Newman. DVD also has Deleted Scenes with/without commentary by Synder and Newman. DVD has two amusing mini-movies that inspired for this Remake but the best of all is three featurettes on the make-up effects artist by Two-Time Oscar Winner:David LeRoy Anderson. Anderson won Two Oscars on Make-Up Effects for The Nutty Professor (1996) and Men in Black (1997). DVD Features could have used more like the Original Theatrical Trailer, Interview with the Actors and why Rubinstein wanted to do a Remake of Dawn. Which Rubinstein did a commentary track for the Extended Cut of the Original-Dawn on the Dead in the Ultimate 4-Disc Edition. The Remake of Dawn is almost perfect as the Original but the only real shortcoming of this remake is the surprise end-credits, which it does push things a little too far and it seems to come from a different movie. Was it really worth the trouble ? Since the surprise end-credits wasn't part of Screenwriter:James Gunn (Best Known for writing-Scooby Doo films) original screenplay. Top Screenwriters:Micheal Tolkin (The Player) and Scott Frank (Minority Report) did some re-writes for this remake, which they are uncredited. Super 35.

Which Walter isn't always the man, what he seems to be.Directed by D.J. Caruso (Disturbia, The Salton Sea, Taking Lives) made an interesting, modestly entertaining drama. Which is based on a true story on Brandon's fascinating life. The first half of the film works best, when it's funny and kept things moving. But then the second half takes a dark turn and slow going at times. This film is also about redemption towards these characters. McConaughey plays his role, quite well in this movie. Al Pacino's character, love him or hate him. His performance is always quite interesting, despite the many bad turns his character does in the film. Rene Russo gives her best performance here as Brandon's only sympathetic friend.DVD has an sharp anamorphic Widescreen (2.35:1) transfer and an good-Dolby Digital 5.1 Surround Sound.

DVD also has Deleted Scenes with optional commentaries by the director and screenwriter, making of featurette, interview with the real Brandon (Which his real name is Brandon Link) and Trailer & T.V. Spots. Since his film was an box office disappointment. This is the kind of movie that plays better on DVD. Despite the solid premise of the film. This is worth watching, thanks to the performances of McConaughey, Pacino and Russo. Russo is one of the executive producers of the picture. Don't miss this true-life story. Super 35.

Alien: Resurrection," This silly but interesting odd-ball sequel to the Alien Series is quite entertaining.
","200 years later... Ellen Ripley (Sigourney Weaver) has been brought back though the magic of DNA, because Ripley killed herself by destroying the Alien Queen inside of her. The Military Scientists (J.E. Freeman and Brad Dourif) decides to keep her alive and wanting the Alien for their weapons/science division.

Once again, Ripley has to deal with the Aliens again but now she has to face also a complete different Alien is waiting to be born.Directed by Jean-Pierre Jeunet (Amélie, The City of the Lost Children, A Very Long Engagement) made a complete different sequel to the Alien Series. Jeunet's strange visual style and his sometimes humorous black comedy, certainly makes this one, the oddest of the four films. Which is somewhat uneven with the director's french sensibilities crossed with American mainstream film-making cinema. Weaver gives an complete, different and interesting performance as the clone Ripley. Which as Usual, she's very good in the film. One of the serious flaws in this sequel is the third act, especially the newborn Alien is a bit of a letdown. Although the newborn Alien does have some odd human facials. Which does look like the lead actress in several brief moments.The original DVD has an strong anamorphic Widescreen (2.35:1) transfer and an excellent Dolby Digital 5.1 Surround Sound. DVD's only extra is the three minute featurette, trailers and a collector's booklet.The latest Two Disc Set is a Collector's Edition. Which this new edition, includes the original theatrical cut and a special alternate cut with the original opening sequence and a slightly different conclusion than runs 8 minutes longer. The DVD has the same Widescreen transfer and Sound (Also included DTS 5.1 Surround Sound). DVD has an entertaining commentary track by the director, cast and crew members. Disc Two has over three hours of featurettes, which they are intriguing. Disc Two also has all the production photos and artwork of the movie.Filmmaker:Jeunet admits that, he's still very proud of the original theatrical cut but with this alternate cut, he got to finish his original opening sequence that sets up the blackish humour of the picture. Some might enjoy this but the real die hard fans of the series will certainly enjoy it. Written by Joss Whedon (Who's best known for creating T.V.

DVD Features are two running commentary tracks by the filmmakers and cast. DVD also has Deleted Scenes, Outtakes, Featurettes and more. This is a Critically Acclamed Horror Comedy that is a sure fire hit. One of the most original Horror Comedy since Sam Raimi's Evil Dead Trilogy and Dan O'Bannon's Return of the Living Dead.

Hostel," This wild, ambitious, horror film premise is not for all tastes.
","Two life long American buddies (Jay Hernandez & Derek Richardson) and their new found foreign friend (Eythor Gudjonsson) are traveling through Europe by backpacking. Later they find themselves seduced by attractive ladies at a Hostel and then lured by becoming victims in a cruel game. Which is a Murder for Profit business by killing travelers from any nationality at any price.Directed by Eli Roth (Cabin Fever) made an entertaining, sick, twisted horror movie with clever touches of dark humour. Roth's scenes of torture are surprisingly effective and the film is gratuitous violent. Which Roth is never seems to be ashame of. The director handle himself better as a filmmaker than he did on his previous first picture (Which is of course 'Cabin Fever'). The film actually takes its time by getting to know the characters before getting into the story of this movie. Which is a good for a horror film, especially these days.DVD has an fine anamorphic Widescreen (2.35:1) transfer and an good-Dolby Digital 5.1 Surround Sound. Like Roth's previous movie on DVD, the director appears in all four commentary tracks! Which one of them is a solo commentary track by the director. Commentary two is the director and the executive producers:Boaz Yakin (Remember the Titans), Scott Spiegel (Co-Writer of 'Evil Dead 2:Dead by Dawn') & Quentin Tarantino (Kill Bill Vol.1 & Vol.2, Pulp Fiction, Reservoir Dogs). Commentary three is by the director, Producer:Chris Briggs and documentary filmmaker:Gabriel Roth. Commentary four is also by the director, film editor:George Folsey Jr. (National Lampoon's Animal House, The Blues Brothers), Harry Knowles of AintItCoolNews.com, actor:Eython Gudjonsson and actress:Barbara Nedeljakova. Which the all four commentary are all entertaining and worth checking out.DVD also has three part excellent featurette titled 'Hostel:Dissected' by director's brother:Gabriel. Which is entertaining and gives you the behind the scenes tour of this film. Also the DVD has an multi-angle interactive feature of the infamous 'Kill the Car!' sequence. Which is basically long takes from different camera set-ups. Seeing the street kids destroying the car is amusing, depending from which angle to choose from. The two things are missing from this DVD is the original theatrical trailer and deleted scenes. The original darker ending was mention in the commentaries and also briefly seen in the three part featurette. This low budget film has good production values with great locations, terrific score by Nathan Barr (Club Dread, Dukes of Hazzard, Super Troopers) and gory make-up effects by Gregory Nicotero & Oscar-Winner:Howard Berger. Roth is actually working on a sequel. I think it will be difficult to imagine a sequel to this flawed but unique movie. But who knows, maybe writer/director Roth could surprised us. Super 35.

DVD has two featurettes, deleted scenes and alternative ending. The director co-wrote the script along cast member:Lennon.

Most of the performances are over the top here, especially by Oldmen and Chris Tucker as Rudy Rhod. Jonovich is certainly in top shape in this film and her character is fascinating as well, especially during the first act. This is probably one of the most expansive movies to be produced outside of the U.S. The picture's unusual sense of humour is the strongest strength of entire film, if not always on target. Besson's unique premise is quite sloppy at times, the movie works well during the first and third act of the movie. This is certainly worth watching, it is a must see in Widescreen.

This is a much more fascinating film than Burton's original Batman. This has an great moody score by Danny Elfman (The Frighteners, Nightbreed, The Nightmare Before Christmas).

This film has several plot holes that starts to show in the third act and for some, it's never as satisfying as you'd like to be. Still, it's entertaining enough for this thrill ride of a film.

But there's pressure of these two friends, since they might lose their friendship before they go to separate ways in different college.Directed by Greg Mottola (The Daytrippers) made an amusing comedy of age comedy that has some big laughs and this actually plays this film is more real to life than the typical teen comedies, that you would normally see. Hill and Cera have good chemistry together, they also have good performances as well. Which their performances gives the movie it's heart. Newcomer Mintz-Plesse steals the show, he brings some of the picture's best laughs. He is extremely likable out-through the film. This comedy was one of the biggest hits in the summer of 2007 and the reviews were surprisingly good for this kind of film. 'Superbad' could have been a really bad movie if they didn't have the right director for the coming of age comedy. But Mottola's does an fine job with his second film, which he cares enough for the characters in the movie by making them as real as possible with memorable roles.The Single Disc DVD Version of the 'Unrated' Cut is actually four minutes longer than the R-Rated Theatrical Cut.

DVD has an amusing commentary track by the cast & crew members of the picture, Deleted/Extended Scenes, Outtakes and more. This is probably one of the best teens movies in a long time and it is the kind of film that adults will enjoy as well. 'Superbad' has its flaws here and there, especially during the middle half. Where it's drags a bit and there's some cheap laughs along the way. But it's doesn't hurt, it was certainly very different than what i have expected to be. But it's certainly a very good movie, it is the kind of film. When teenagers will have a special place in their hearts for this movie like 'The Breakfest Club' for those who really loved it. Which i still watch, even though i am much older now and still loving it. 'Superbad' will be contemporary classic for the teenagers and young adults. Don't miss it.

Both police officers are trying to uncover an bizarre conspiracy between the town's villagers are not what they seemed to be.Directed by Edgar Wright (Shaun of the Dead) made an entertaining dark satirical comedy with terrific moments of humour and action sequences. Director Wright is certainly paying tribute to filmmakers like Michael Bay, John Woo and especially Tony Scott in the well staged action scenes.

Pirates of the Caribbean: At World's End," Long but entertaining second sequel to the extremely popular 'Pirates of the Caribbean' movies. It is also probably the best of the series.

Now they must faced their enemies, Davey Jones (Bill Nighy), Lord Culter Beckett (Tom Hollander) and Norrington (Jack Davenport).

Deep is amusing as ever in the lead role. Oscar-Winner:Rush is a nice return as Captain Barbossa also. Chow-Yun Fat is good in a small supporting role. This has excellent production designs, spectacular visual effects and an enchaining cast. This film is an improvement over the complicated second film and Probably even better than the first film. The movie is long to be sure but entertaining just the same with an eye-popping climax. Keith Richards from 'The Rolling Stones' appears in a fun cameo as Jack Sparrow's father.

Spider-Man 3," Entertaining but the least impressive in terms of storytelling in the series so far.
","Peter Parker (Tobey Maguire) has everything going well in his life. He has wonderful if struggling actress/singer/girlfriend Mary Jane Waston (Kristen Dunst), loving great-mother (Rosemary Harris), doing extremely well at college, still working at the newspaper job posing pictures of himself as Spider-Man but he has problems with Harry Osborn (James Franco)... his former best friend. Which Harry still believes that Peter/Spider-Man killed him. But now Peter faces new problems, when an escape convict (Thomas Haden Chruch) is molecularly transformed into The Sandman, an ambitious photographer named Eddie Brock (Topher Grace)... who's after Peter's job and Peter finds himself addicted to an alien fungus that turns Peter/Spider-Man to the dark side.Directed by Sam Raimi (Evil Dead Trilogy, The Gift, A Simple Plan) made an entertaining if plot-heavy sequel to the ever popular 'Spider-Man Series'. The cast are good here... especially Dunst, Chruch, Grace and Bryce Dallas Howard (Who appears in a memorable small supporting role). Director Raimi has fun making Peter Parker an insensitive jerk half of the time... especially when Peter turns into a sleazy (Probably Emo) stud muffin. The main problem with 'Spider-Man 3' is the screenplay by the director, his brother Ivan Raimi (Army of Darkness) and Two Time Oscar-Winner:Alvin Sergent (Nuts, Ordinary People, What About Bob ?). There's too many storyline, some are never truly satisfying (Like the Eddie Brock or Venom character), the film could have been better written or fleshing out the new supporting characters even more... so the movie could be longer.DVD has an sharp anamorphic Widescreen (2.35:1) transfer and an strong Dolby Digital 5.1 Surround Sound. DVD has two enjoyable commentary tracks. Commentary one is by the director and cast members:Maguire, Dunst, Franco, Chruch, Grace & Howard. Commentary two is by the filmmakers as in producers, editor and special effects supervisor. DVD also includes an music video, bloopers (some are extremely funny) and an photo gallery. 'Super-Man 3' is the least entertaining of the three movies so far but i have to admit, it does improve after repeated viewings. It was the highest grossing film of 2007... especially considering the $259 million budget! 'Spider-Man 3' is still worthwhile. But i think 'Army of Darkness' also known as 'Evil Dead 3' is better than 'Spider-Man 3'. B-Movie Cult Star:Bruce Campbell has an terrific small bit in his cameo as the Maitre 'D. Super 35.

Resident Evil: Extinction," Surprisingly good sequel than improves greatly over 'Resident Evil:Apocalyspe'.
","Several years has passed... When the virus spread in Raccoon City, which the city was overrun with Zombies and all sorts of Monsters. It was an huge disaster in the city. But the virus went all over the world and the world changed into one big desert. Which several city in the world like Las Vegas, Nevada is nearly cover in sand. Like Food, Gas and Water is very limited. Alice (Milla Jovovich) is still hiding from the evil Umbrella Corporation and she travels alone to find an safe place. She tries to stay away from her contacts to not endanger her friends or herself. But the last time that Alice was with Umbrella Corporation, they did some experimenting on her.

But Dr. Issacs has other plans for Alice, The Umbrella Corporation and himself.Directed by Russell Mulcahy (Highlander, Resurrection, The Shadow) made an enjoyable Action/Horror/Sci-Fi/Adventure that improves over 'Resident Evil:Apocalyspe'. Which the 2004 sequel was an watchable movie but in the end results... it was an mess, despite an good cast. Now the third film is closer to Paul W.S. Anderson's original picture but Mulcahy does have his own visual style as well. Anderson's screenplay certainly gives visual homages to George Miller's Mad Max Trilogy, Alfred Hitchcock's The Birds, George A. Romero's Day of the Dead, the original Resident Evil movie and more. Although his screenplay is quite flawed but it is clever and exciting at times. DVD has an clean anamorphic Widescreen (2.35:1) transfer and an good Dolby Digital 5.1 Surround Sound. DVD has an enjoyable commentary track by the director and the producers, four featurettes and deleted scenes. The last and third feature was an major international success. Critics did certainly hated this film but it is fun to watch. But the best thing in the picture is Jovovich, which she's in great shape in the film and there's a few genuine surprises in store for the fans of the 'Resident Evil' movies. Despite some plot holes in the story, overall 'Resident Evil:Extinction' is entertaining and it should keep the fans happy. Super 35. (*** Â½/*****).",8,2,5,2 October 2007

","When an mysterious serial killer, it's been murdering people in the Bay Area of San Francisco, California. When this killer sends a letter to the San Francisco Chronicle newspaper. He wants his riddles to be published in the paper, which it could discover his true identity. A couple of letters later from this serial killer. This murderer calls himself in the letter 'The Zodiac' and he promised more murders to come. This becomes an obsession for Catroonist Robert Graysmith (Jake Gyllenhaal), colonist for the paper Paul Avery (Robert Downey Jr.), and an dedicated San Franciso police detective (Mark Ruffalo) will stop at nothing to find this killer.

Which is based on a novel by Robert Graysmith (Auto Focus a.k.a 'The Murder of Bob Crane'). Which the novel is Graysmith's true-life experience. The film has an top cast like Anthony Edwards, Elias Koteas, Dermot Mulroney, Donal Logue, John Carroll Lynch, Chloe Sevigny, Philip Baker Hall, Brian Cox and more. This well-received crime thriller was an box office disappointment and this movie should do well on DVD. Since Fincher's is working on a Director's Cut.

This film is vividly told and well-acted by a talented cast.DVD has an sharp anamorphic Widesceen (2.35:1) transfer and an good-Dolby Digital 5.1 Surround Sound. DVD has no extras but previews.

This film has an effective music score by David Shire (2010:The Year We Make Contact, Monkey Shines, Short Circuit) and an excellent screenplay by James Vanderbilt (Basic, Darkness Falls, The Rundown) are also one of the highlights of this picture. Which Vanderbilt is also one of the producers. I won't be surprised if this film will received Oscar Nomniations for 2008. This is one of the strongest films of 2007, which i seen so far. I can't wait to see what Fincher will add scenes for his Director's Cut. Don't miss it. Ione Skye appears uncredited. Super 35. (**** ½/*****).",9,0,0,27 July 2007

Dan will do anything to ruin Harvey's choices.Directed by Gus Van Sant (Drugstone Cowboy, Psycho '1998', To Die For) made an intriguing fact based drama on a true story. Penn is extraordinary good in his second Oscar-Winning performance as a charismatic gay rights leader. The cast are really strong here... especially Emile Hirsch, Brolin in a Oscar nominated role, Franco, Diego Luna as Harvey's second unstable lover and Alison Pill as Harvey's loyal assistant. It was one of the most critically acclaimed movies of 2008. Van Sant keeps things movies and it feels like a documentary at times but perhaps the film never really achieved greatness as some viewers would expected. Excellent performances are the high point here.The DVD has an sharp anamorphic Widescreen (1.85:1) transfer and an good Dolby Digital 5.1 Surround Sound. The DVD includes deleted scenes and three featurettes. 'Milk' is certainly a good film, it's memorable for Penn's lead role and a subject matter that is still important today. Dustin Lance Black won an Oscar for his work for Best Original Screenplay. It was also nominated for Best Picture, Best Director, Costume Design, Film Editing and Best Original Score by Danny Elfman (Batman, Dolores Claiborne, Red Dragon). Which is music score is good and different from most of his work. Despite some flaws, 'Milk' is a fine movie that certainly worth a look. (****/*****).",8,1,3,30 March 2009

Gans' first assembly cut was over 3 and a half hours. Some of the behind the scenes footage from the DVD are not seen in the final cut. One of the highlights of this picture are the amazing visual effects that truly served the story well from this flawed but certainly unique movie.

But his best scenes, when the movie works... when he shares scenes with the character who plays his son Michael. Which the Michael character is a bit hard to like at first but he certainly improves later on. Loggia's character keeps on reminding us a bit too much... how bad the character of Lincoln's thinks he is.While 'Over the Top' is often funny, when it's intentional or not, the characters situation is not always believable but Golan makes sure to keep it entertaining and not getting bored by it. The movie's main theme song 'Meet Me Half Way' is not bad but it does gets its shares of silly tunes that works well enough of the feature. 'Over the Top' certainly went on to be an Camp Classic and it is one of the most recognizably films of Stallone. After over 20 years, it still reminds watchable. It is one of the better if not best Cannon Films of the 1980's. Terry Funk appears in a bit role as one of Culter's men. Screenplay by Stirling Silliphant (The Poseidon Adventure, The Towering Inferno, Village of the Damned) and Sylvester Stallone (Rocky Series, Rambo Series, Cliffhanger).

The Hills Have Eyes," One of the strongest horror film since Alexandre Aja's own film 'High Tension'.
","In New Mexico, at a deserted highway. A mysterious, seemingly normal Gas Station attendant (Tom Bower) leads a middle class family (Aaron Stanford, Emilie de Ravin, Daniel Byrd, Kathleen Quinlan, Vinessa Shaw, Ted Levine and Maisie Camilleri Preziosi) to take a shirt cut by driving through the desert. Since the family are on their way to California. This family gets stranded in the middle of nowhere and not thinking, they are near an old nuclear test site. An strange group of Bloodthirshy monsters are watching them from the hills and these monsters are planning their attack on this wholesome family.Directed by Alexandre Aja made an effective, strong brutal horror movie. Which is based on a 1977 film, written and directed by Wes Craven (The Last House on the Left, A Nightmare on Elm Street, Scream Trilogy). Co-Screenwriter/Director:Aja and Art Director/Co-Screenwriter:Gregory Lavasseur (Who also co-wrote 'High Tension') made this remake with more irony, emotional and violent than Craven's take on his original movie. In this new remakes focuses on a nuclear waste subplot, a different third act and making the villains more mysterious, creeper & open minded. The only thing i felt missing watching this remake is Craven's (sometimes outrageous) dark sense of humour in the original. Oddly enough Aja and Lavasseur made this villains a bit more sympathetic. Because this remake, they made these monsters victims themselves by the nuclear test site. Which of course, the big differences between the original and the remake. In the original, these attackers were inbred cannibals living near an old nuclear test site. In the remake, they become monsters by being deformed by the test site turning into cannibals themselves and living at a old test site.This remake is actually (only sightly) better than Craven's movie. This remake has top production values by having excellent cinematography work by Maxime Alexandre, a surprisingly good cast (including:Robert Joy as Lizard, Micheal Bailey Smith as Pluto, Laura Ortiz as Ruby and Billy Drago as Papa Jupiter), great production designs by Joseph Nemic the Third (Terminator 2:Judgment Day), convincing make-up effects work by Gregory Nicotero and Oscar-Winner:Howard Berger (The Chronicles of Nadia:the Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe, Hostel, Land of the Dead) and sometimes brilliant music score by tomandandy (The Rules of Attraction). Like Craven's original, this remake is also flawed in parts. Especially in some of its dramatic moments and towards the conclusion.The Unrated DVD has an sharp anamorphic Widescreen (2.35:1) transfer and an strong-Dolby Digital 5.1 Surround Sound. The DVD has two informative commentary tracks. Commentary One is the Co-Screenwriter/Director:Aja, Art Director/Co-Screenwriter:Lavasseur and One of the film's producers:Marianne Maddalena (Cursed, Music of the Heart, Red Eye). The Second Commentary is by the producers:Craven and Peter Locke (The original producer of the 1977 picture) is actually a bit more entertaining and fun than the first commentary track. DVD also has a terrific 50 minute documentary, production diaries and a music video. Only two things missing are the excellent theatrical trailer and deleted scenes (Which it was briefly seen in the documentary).The new 'Hills' is one of the best horror remakes in a while. Like Craven's original film, this remake will also have an cult following. Since this remake was a sleeper hit at the box office and did well on DVD. There's no doubt the producers:Craven, Maddalena and Locke are working on the upcoming sequel. Let's hope the sequel will not be a remake of the absurd second 'Hills' 1983 movie. Which Craven and Locke were also involved in. Super 35. (****/*****).",8,3,7,14 August 2006

This is one of those movies that people keep watching and it will find an new audiences time to time. When Olive finally gets to show her 'talents', it's one of the funniest scenes in the picture and it's certainly the highlight. Do not miss this extremely likable film. Super 35.

This film turned an major box office disappointment in the summer of 1998. Which it was badly marketed by the studio and not many people knew Parker and Stone. Which these two actors/filmmakers are much more known now than they were back in 1998. This film has an fine comedic supporting cast like Dian Bachar, Yasmine Bleeth, Jenny McCarthy, Bob Costas as himself and Al Michaels as himself.DVD has an sharp anamorphic Widescreen (1.85:1) transfer and an good-Dolby Digital 5.1 Surround Sound.

This film has some solid laughs, a few memorable gross-out gags but it's Bachar as the tortured BASEketball player Kenny has the better laughs in the movie. The film turns somewhat flat in the third act. Many real-life Game Players in different sports appears in amusing cameos. This film will appeal to die-hard fans of Zucker's work and as well for fans creators of 'South Park'. This would have been an better movie if Parker & Stone had they hands on the screenplay but sadly they didn't. It is still an good if under-appreciated comedy. Written by Zucker, Robert LoCash (Naked Gun 33 1/3:The Final Insult, High School High), Lewis Friedman and Jeff Wright. (*** Â½/*****).",8,1,3,17 September 2007
Wanted," Surprising well-made action/adventure/thriller that is extremely entertaining.
","Wesley Gibson (James McAvoy) is a bored Account Manager, who doesn't care anymore that his girlfriend (Kristen Hager) is cheating with his best friend (Chris Pratt) at work. He also can't stand his annoying overweight female boss as well. One night... when he was at the pharmacy, he meets an mysterious attractive woman named Fox (Oscar-Winner:Angelina Jolie). She tells Wesely, she knew her father and he was one of the best assassins in the world until he was murder. At first, Wesley doesn't believe nothing she said until an mysterious assassin named Cross (Thomas Kretschmann) tries to kill him and Fox. Now Wesley finds himself running for his life along with the help of Fox. When Wesley meets the boss of Fox named Sloan (Oscar-Winner:Morgan Freeman), who tells Wesely he has the choice to life the life of a highly trained assassins or he could goes back to his ordinary boring life.

Wesley finds out that his training is no laughing matter, since it's extremely harsh and he is using his time as well to find out how was his father like and to find his father's killer with the help of Fox.Directed by Timur Bekmambetov (Night Watch, Day Watch) made an highly entertaining action-thrill ride that plenty of creative action sequences, great visual moments and plenty of dark humour as well. McAvoy is excellent as the geeky young man, who finally takes control on his life to be a trained killer. Freeman and Jolie gives good supporting performances as well. 'Wanted' is based on a Comic Book Series by Mark Millar and J.G. Jones. Which i heard it is somewhat completely different from the Comic Books. Director Bekmambetov gives some of the finest action sequences since 'The Matrix'. Which i was glad since i was getting tired of action movies these days were using too much CGI effects but this one, director Bekmambetov goes a step further by making the action looking visually impressive. 'Wanted' is one of those movies, you can't wait to see in theaters again or once it's comes out on DVD/Blu-ray. I was completely blown-away with the action, visual style, humour and of course, the story. I enjoyed the premise very much but i think it was McAvoy's role made 'Wanted' to be one of the most unique things to be enjoyed. Danny Elfman (Batman, The Frighteners, Men in Black) offers an completely different music that his usual dark Gothic style score. Don't miss it. Screenplay by Michael Brandt, Derek Haas and Chris Morgan (The Fast & The Furious:Tokyo Drift, Cellular). Which Brandt and Haas wrote movie scripts together like (3:10 to Yuma '2007', 2 Fast 2 Furious). Super 35. (**** ½/*****).",9,3,7,15 July 2008

Which leads this crew to a bizarre, troubled journey into the unknown during the late 60's at the Vietnam war.Directed by Francis Ford Coppola (The Godfather Trilogy, Gardens of Stone, The Outsiders) made an absolutely, thrilling horrific drama set at the Vietnam war. This film is also loaded with dark humour. This has knockout performances by the cast, including Oscar-Winner:Robert Duvall in a brilliant comical dark Oscar-Nominated role as the Sergeant and Dennis Hopper. This was most troubled pictured to be filmed during 1970's. This film went over-schedule, over budget and taken three years to filmed this movie. But it went out to be one of the biggest hits of 1979 and it become an instant classic.The original DVD has an sharp anamorphic Widesceen (2.00:1) transfer and an strong-digitally remastered:Dolby Digital 5.1 Surround Sound.

Van Helsing," An goofy, adventure, horror/thriller with an nice sense of humour.
","Van Helsing (Hugh Jackman) is an infamous monster hunter, Who works for the Vatican. Helsing and his sidekick Karl (David Wenham) are sent to Transylvania on a mission to destroy Count Dracula (Richard Roxburgh) and his three brides (Elena Anaya, Silvia Colloca and Josie Maran). But Count Dracula isn't working alone, since he has the Wolf Man (Will Kemp) on his side and his loyal assistant Igor (Kevin J. O'Connor) are planning something of unspeakable evil, which could help Dracula be the ruler of the world. But Dracula's needs the Frankenstein's monster (Shuler Hensley) to make his evil plan work. Because the Frankenstein's monster has plenty of energy, power and life on his body. Helsing isn't alone, since he also finds help from an tough female warrior Anna Valerious (Kate Beckinsale). Which Anna tries to save her brother, which her brother has become an Wolf Man. Van Helsing and his sidekick finds themselves in the most difficult mission of their career. Especially they are the only ones, who could destroy Count Dracula and his three evil brides with the help of Anna.Written and Directed by Stephen Sommers (The Mummy, The Mummy Returns, Deep Rising) made an enjoyable if especially dumb action-packed ride. Jackson is solid as usual as the title lead character in the film. This movie has good supporting performances and some fine visual effects. Although Sommers' script is some ways could have been much more and less jokey in tone. Which it worked much better in his previous pictures. The movie's best moments are in the first half of the movie. It does offers something different in some key sequences. It will also probably disappointed some of the die-hard fans of the Universal's monster films. But this movie is aimed more at kids and fans of Sommers' movies than the general audiences.DVD has an sharp Pan & Scan (1.33:1) transfer and an strong-Dolby Digital 5.1 Surround Sound. DVD has two enjoyable commentaries tracks. One is by the writer/producer/director:Sommers and editor/producer:Bob Ducsay. Second commentary is by the actors:Roxburgh, Kemp and Hensley. DVD also has featurettes, Outtakes and more. But the best thing about 'Van Helsing' is the funny, campy performance of Roxburgh is certainly an Hoot as Count Dracula. The actresses, who plays his three brides have their moments as well. Beckinsale is somewhat in familiar territory after seeing her in the 'Underworld' movies. Sommers' movies is always been style over substance with heavy CGI effects, good looking cinematography and strong music score are always important in his films. Probably the most memorable thing in the movie as well is in the Black & White opening sequence is terrific as well. I thought 'Van Helsing' would have looked great if the whole movie stayed in Black & White. Since this film was even an bigger hit on DVD than it was in theaters. Fred Dekker's 'The Monster Squad' was done much better and it was ahead of it's time as well. Overall 'Van Helsing' is entertaining, Sommers' best film is still 'The Mummy' and he should lay off the monsters movies for a while. (*** ½/*****).",8,0,1,8 September 2007

Then things are well enough for Andy to fall into his first relationship but Andy is too frighten to tell Trish that Andy is still a virgin.Directed by Judd Apatow made an original comedy with fresh gags about porn, speed dating and the gross-out perils of hooking up with drunk girls. The film is clever enough to never takes leave of humanity. Carell gives an excellent comic performance in this movie. Keener is well match as Carell's first love. Making Carell and Keener a believable screen couple. Rudd, Malco and Rogan are fun as Carell's buddy. This is actually the most satisfying sex comedy in years. It is also probably the best comedies of 2005. The movie is buoyantly clever and always entertaining. Written by the director and actor:Carell. (**** ½/*****).",9,3,6,2 October 2005

Now Sean has to face his wife by telling the truth and posing as Caster to meet his dangerous criminal buddies for help.Directed by John Woo (Broken Arrow, Hard Target, The Killer) made an One of a Kind action film with an preposterous premise that actually works. Which it was originally written as a Sci-Fi/Action/Thriller. But director Woo and screenwriters changed the premise sightly to be in modern today instead. Travolta and Cage are extremely good in their roles by giving heart and soul to this excellent action movie. These two actors are also having an great time playing these characters Over the Top as well. Woo is an expert for creating memorable dynamic action sequences and as well making these characters human as well. There's one stand-out sequence, when the point of view of a little boy (David McCurley) is listening to 'Over the Raindow' while watching People getting killed all over him is unexpectedly touching and beautiful in a dark way.The DVD is a 10th anniversary edition, which this DVD is a 2-Disc Set.

Disc 1 also has an other commentary track by the screenwriters and as well Deleted Scenes with optional commentary by the filmmakers. Disc 2 includes an fascinating one-hour documentary of the film with many new interviews with the cast & crew (expect for Travolta and Cage, sadly 'although vintage interviews was used in the DVD'), 25 minute documentary of the films of John Woo and the original theatrical trailer. This film certainly made an impact, once it was release in the summer of 1997 and it went on to have an huge following. Once it released on Video and DVD. This film is still John Woo's best American film to date. I think it's one of those films that Woo will have an hard time to top this one. Because this is an extraordinary picture. Don't miss it. Plenty of familiar faces appears in bit parts, including an young Thomas Jane as a prisoner, John Bloom (Better known as Joe Bob Briggs) and Danny Masterson as a Would-Be Rapist.

But Rumpelstiltskin has other plans for Shrek.Directed by Mike Mitchell (Deuce Bigelow:Male Gigolo, Sky High, Surviving Christmas) made an enjoy fourth 'Shrek' film in the series. It is certainly better than 'Shrek the Third' and probably even better than 'Shrek 2' as well. Voice talents in the movie are terrific, especially new comer Hohrn as Rumpelstiltskin but it is Antonio Banderas as the voice of Puss in Boots steals the show. It is nice to see the new 'Shrek' movie in Widescreen format as well. This is also an darker movie than the previous 'Shrek' films. Since this is the final chapter, the series certainly ends well.

Director Bousman and Screenwriter:Leigh Whannell (Saw) go on a darker route on this one by fleshing out character development, having unique death traps and some sadistic dark humour. This is the darkest of the three films. Although isn't quite suspenseful as the first one or wicked as the second one. But it is different, despite some slow spots here and there.This is the Unrated DVD by having some minutes of additional footage.

Commentary three is by the director:Bousman, Editor:Kevin Greutert and Director of Photographer:David A. Armstrong. DVD also includes featurettes and trailers.The best achievement of 'Saw 3' is actually the good production designs by David Hackl. Even though 'Saw 3' has a story, it feels more like Style over Subtances wins this one over. Dina Meyer returns in this one in a small part and as well Donnie Walhberg from 'Saw 2'. Whannell appears as Adam in a cameo from the first film. 'Saw 3' has some strong moments, some unexpected twists and a few surprise cameos. 'Saw 3' seems to be the perfect way to end the series but since it was an box office success. Studio:Lions Gate and Director:Bousman are already working on 'Saw 4'. I always felt that 'Saw 3' runs of steam towards the end. By 'Saw 4', hopefully they should come up with new stories and characters if they want to make this franchise fresher. It's daring but director:Bousman did a good job with the second and third of the series. Probably still has the right elements to surprise the audiences with the future movies.

","Three spoiled Hollywood actors, one is a action star Tugg Speedman (Ben Stiller), the second is a comedian Jeff Portnoy (Jack Black) and the third is a five-time Oscar-Winning over-talented actor Kirk Lazarus (Robert Downey, Jr.). These three actors are making an Vietnam film, based on a true story. Which it is written by a Vietnam veteran Four Leaf Tayback (Nick Notle). But the director (Steve Coogan) has problems with these over-demanding actors that the film's producer (Tom Cruise) wants these problems solved as soon as possible. Since it's already over-budgeted, just shooting for four days! The novelist tells the director, he wants to sent these actors in the jungle with the real enemies close by. Along with the novelist, the director, prop man (Danny Mc Bride), the three lead actors and the two supporting players (Brandon T. Jackson & Jay Bunichel) to be sent in the darkest heart of the jungle of Vietnam. But they find themselves way over their heads too soon and having trouble with the notorious Vietnamese drug-lord (Brandon Soo Hoo).Directed by Ben Stiller (The Cable Guy, Reality Bites, Zoolander) made an very enjoyable satire about the way of film-making in Hollywood by making Big Budget movies seem always overblown in the process. Director Stiller also makes this fun for the audiences by adding action and some truly funny memorable moments. For me, this is the most enjoyable Stiller performance since 'There's Something about Mary'. But Stiller does have an great cast surrounding him. Downey, Jr. and Cruise have all the best comedic moments. Matthew McConaughey appears in a supporting role as Tugg's dedicated agent/friend. The original theatrical cut DVD has an sharp anamorphic Widescreen (2.35:1) transfer and an good Dolby Digital 5.1 Surround Sound. DVD has an hilarious commentary by Stiller, Black and Downey Jr. (Still in his character from the movie). DVD also has featurettes with interviews with the cast & crew. Perphas the biggest surprise is how shockingly well written it is by the actor/producer/director Stiller, actor:Justin Theroux and Etan Cohen. They certainly got the premise right on and they wrote an first-rate script. This is my third favorite film of 2008, along with 'Wanted' and 'Hellboy 2:The Golden Army'. 'Tropic Thunder' is the funniest comedy of the year so far, while 'Step Brothers' comes in as the second funniest this year. Don't miss 'Tropic Thunder', see it now on the big screen. Panavision. Also available in a two-disc Director's Cut DVD and Blu-ray.(**** 1/2 out of *****).",9,2,6,24 September 2008
Die Hard 2," This terrific action movie is different but just as good as the original.
","John McClane (Bruce Willis) is waiting for his wife (Bonnie Bedelia) on the Dallas Internation Airport in Washington D.C. to land on Christmas Eve. When he spotted some strange people on the airport, then sooner than expected. John finds out that they are terrorist, lead by Colonel Stuart (William Sadler). Which they are trying to Hi-Jack to the airport. Which they want the Criminal General Roman Esperanza (Franco Nero) to land on the airport. Which these terrorists has shut off all the lights of the landing area to have control of the area. Which makes other planes difficult to them to land. Now John is racing against time to find these terrorist before it's too late. Which it will kill hundreds of people on the other different planes before they run out of fuel.Directed by Renny Harlin (Cleaner, Cliffhanger, The Convenant) made an entertaining action sequel of the successful original. This was Harlin's first Big Budget film after his hugely successful independent film. Which it's 'A Nightmare on Elm Street 4:The Dream Master', it's also the highest grossing 'Nightmare' movie of the series. Harlin handles this picture like a pro with it's dynamic action sequences, a fast paced, a excellent cast of pros and amusing sense of humour. The special effects are certainly impressive. This was probably the most expansive movie of 1990. The supporting characters are less dumb than they were on the first 'Die Hard' picture and it is extremely silly at times. But on the usual Summer Blockbusters, that's soon to be expected. It's the kind of movie, you will certainly enjoy if you don't expect logic too much. Based on the novel '58 Minutes' by the late Walter Wager. Screenplay by Steven E. de Souza (Commando, 48 Hrs, The Running Man) and Doug Richardson (Bad Boys, Hostage, Money Train). Panavision.

Anderson (AVP Alien Vs Predator, Event Horizon, Mortal Kombat) made an enjoyable horror film that mixes science-fiction and action quite well. Anderson gets an decent cast here, some of the performances from the actors are good. Although Anderson's writing script is quiet heavy at times and it doesn't always work (Especially the monster 'Licker' could have used more work in the CGI department) but Anderson knows how to set up action sequences and moments of visual style are always been his best at film-making. This survival horror flick is based on a hugely popular game from Capcom and 'Resident Evil' is one the best video game adaptations so far.In the Resurrected Edition on the DVD, 'Resident Evil' is placed double feature with the sequel 'Resident Evil:Apocalyspe' on a two disc set.

'Resident Evil' wasn't an huge success at the box office but it did well in Overseas and especially with DVD Sales was enough to produced the sequels 'Apocalyspe' and 'Extinction'. Die Hard fans of the video game and especially those who loved Zombie movies will get an kick out of this movie. Don't miss it.

Alien vs. Predator," Fans of the Comic Book Series may be disappointed but it is entertaining enough to overcome certain silliness of this toned down adaptation.
","It may be our planet but it's their war! The deadliest creatures from the most successful sci-fi/horror movies ever made face off the first time on film. Based on a Dark Horse Comic Book.A Team of Scientist and Adventurers are sent to Antractica, after the scientists have discover an ancient pyramid buried under the ice. When they get close to the frozen continent. The team makes an eerie discovery:Two Alien Races engaged in a ultimate battle. Whoever Wins... the human race will lost.Directed by Paul W.S. Anderson (Event Horizon, Resident Evil, Soldier) made an silly but enjoyable take off to the Alien and Predator series. The best way to enjoy the film, if you don't the story seriously. Fans of the Alien Series will enjoy Lance Henriksen's role in the film, since he's best known as Bishop from Aliens and Alien 3. Henriksen gets to play the real Charles Bishop Weyland, who is in the film a billionaire industrialist. Sanaa Lathan in the lead role will remind you of Sigourney Weaver from the Alien films.DVD has an sharp anamorphic Widescreen (2.35:1) transfer and an terrific-Dolby Digital 5.1 Surround Sound (Also in DTS). DVD has two enjoyable commentaries by the director, actors:Lathan & Henriksen, visual effects supervisor:John Bruno and creature effects designers/creators Alec Gillis and Tom Woodruff, Jr. DVD also has Deleted Scenes, Making of a Featurette, Dark Horse Comics AVP Cover Gallery and more. The DVD also has an alternative version of AVP with an alternate beginning. The latest DVD is the 2 disc set, which it features the original theatrical cut and extended cut. DVD has the same picture quality and sound from the previous transfer. But the extended cut is disappointing, The director added eight minutes of additional footage but DVD cover promises more battles and more violence. That's simply not true, The filmmaker added character development instead and there's more CGI blood than the PG-13 version. But second disc has plenty of featurettes from Pre-Preduction to Post-Production and more. Anderson's film is simple but it has some exciting visual moments, which their are sensational. The film is fun enough to overcome the illogically plotting of Anderson's screenplay. Screen Story by Anderson, Dan O'Bannon (Alien) and Ronald Shusett (Dead & Buried). Although O'Bannon and Shusett had nothing to do with Anderson's original screen story. But Anderson used elements from O'Bannon and Shusett's story from Alien, that they were never filmed from the original 1979 film. Shane Salerno actually co-wrote the screenplay with the director:Anderson. Which is Salerno is uncredited. Super 35. (****/*****).",8,2,4,29 August 2005
No Country for Old Men," Excellent suspense-thriller with some clever touches of black comedy makes 'No Country for Old Men', a must see.
","'No Country for Old Men' isn't a hard movie to enjoy. Not the the acclaimed Oscar-Winning filmmakers Joel and Ethan Coen (Fargo, O Brother Where Art Thou ?, Raising Arizona) certainly rise to the occasion with this intriguing film that won Four Academy Awards... including Best Picture, Best Director(s), and Best Supporting Actor (Javier Bardem).An Ordinary Man by the name of Llewelyn Moss (Josh Brolin) finds his way into a bloody crime scene. He sees a couple of dead bodies, a dead dog and a pickup full of heroin. But Llewelyn also discover two million dollars that he couldn't resist. But a cold blooded killer named Anton Chirugh (Bardem) follows the trail of West Texas to find the money. Now it's a game of Cat and Mouse, which Llewelyn tries to outsmart Chriugh to no success. A decided sheriff named Ed Tom Bell (Oscar-Winner Tommy Lee Jones) finds himself caught in the middle.Directed Joel and Ethan Coen, who also wrote the Oscar-Winning adaptation from the Pulitzer Prize Author Cormac McCarthy (All the Pretty Horses, The Road). The Coen Brothers made an highly watchable film, it has atmospheric Texas landscapes, realistic settings, incredible suspense, clever touches of black comedy, tightly edited (Which the Coen Brothers won another Oscar but they used a pseudonym for editing the movie) and Bardem's scene-stealing performance as a psychopath murderer makes this movie... a must see.The Production Values are used strongly here, especially Roger Deakins' widescreen cinematography (He received an Oscar nomination for his work) and the rate use of no music score in the movie (expect only in the credits) makes this picture extremely tense by using only sound effects by giving the feature more credit. Anyone who enjoys thrillers will be not disappointed.The actors are top notch here... Jones' gives an quiet good performance as a West Texas Sheriff, who doesn't like the way civilization is crumbling (Which the film's title would make sense to his character). Brolin is very good as the man will do anything to keep his irresistible two million dollars. Bardem is outstanding here, he gives one of the most coldest killers in film history (Not to mention his character name Anton Chigurh is certainly memorable). Kelly MacDonald is fine as Moss' worried wife, Carla Jean. Woody Harrelson has a few scenes as a hired hit-men to kill Chigurh and find the money. Stephen Root (Best known for doing the voice of Bill in the animated series 'King of the Hill') plays a mysterious rich drug runner, who tries to rip-off Chigurh. Garret Dillahunt (Just recently played Krug in the remake of 'The Last House on the Left') gives the movie some comic relief as a inexperienced sheriff.Although i never read the novel. This is a solid motion picture with hair-raising suspense, it has a sense of humor and a strong cast. I wasn't surprise, when this movie won the top categories at the Academy Awards. This was one of the most critically acclaimed features of 2007. It is a movie, i would watch every year. But i think, it was close being a masterpiece (Which are truly rare in today's cinema). I felt the only fault in the movie is in the end, when Bell recently retired from being the sheriff. He sits quietly in the kitchen table with his wife (Tess Harper). He tells two stories about him as a boy, he found lost money that was given by his late father. The other story that his father rode past him on a snowy mountain pass, going ahead to make a fire in the surrounding cold darkness. Whenever Bell got there, he knew his father would be waiting... then he woke up. I felt the conclusion ended abruptly. I remember seeing that movie with an audience, they were certainly confused. But i wasn't and i thought that wasn't really the right way to end a terrific movie like this, that's the only flaw in it.The DVD has an sharp anamorphic Widescreen (2.35:1) transfer and an strong Dolby Digital 5.1 Surround Sound. The DVD also includes three featurettes. Overall 'No Country for Old Men' is a excellent movie. I haven't seen this much suspense handed so genuinely like this before. It is certainly the most straightforward film coming from the Coen Brothers. Which they are known for their bizarre original comedies. It's a certainly an modern near classic that should not be missed. Super 35. (**** 1/2 out of *****).",9,5,8,27 March 2009

The DVD has same extras but adding also an new half-hour featurette, ten minute featurette on 'Transporter 2' and 'Transporter 2' trailer as well.

The novel comes with an warning before he starts reading it. Once he does read it, he finds things very similar to his life. The book titled 'The Number 23', the number has a very eerie meaning to Walter. Pratically every where he goes or things that happen in his life, he sees that number. When he finally finished reading the book, the novel ends very ambiguous with no ending. It seems there's an chapter missing. Walter decides to find the person, who wrote the book and trying to find out how this novel truly ends.Directed by Joel Schumacher (Batman Forever, Flatliners, Phone Booth) made an interesting, flawed but an intriguing movie. This film is filled with arresting visuals and some good moments of suspense as well. Although the audiences might guess the plot twist in the first half of the movie but you will still find yourself interested in some of the unexpected story turns in the film. This film was an box office disappointed but it will surely find an audiences on DVD.DVD has an sharp anamorphic Widescreen (2.35:1) transfer and an good:Dolby Digital 5.1 Surround Sound.

Which David lives in Maine with his wife Stephanie (Kelly Collins Lintz) and their son Billy (Nathan Gamble) in the country. After surviving an major storm during the night having with no power and finding some of their property destroyed in their house & as well for their boat house. David, Billy and their neighbor Brent (Andre Braugher) decides to get food in town to the grocery store until the power gets back on. Then an mysterious big mist starts covering the whole town and one of the locals named Dan (Jeffery DeMunn) claims there's something in the mist. While the locals and a few out of towners are frighten to leave the store, if the man is right there's something in the mist waiting for them. Slowly David and his son find themselves an extraordinary odds between the locals, especially people are slowly taking side with an deeply disturbed over-religious woman named Mrs. Carmody (Oscar-Winner:Marcia Gay Harden) starts taking over the store by believing her wild claims. While the creatures in the mist are waiting for them to come out. Now David, his son and other group of people (Laurie Holden, Toby Jones and Frances Sternhagen) will do anything to get out of the store for survival.Directed by Frank Darabont (The Green Mile, The Majestic, The Shawshank Redemption) made an fascinating, eerie, sometimes old-fashioned Horror film with strong moments of scares, excitement and dark comedy. Darabont is extremely faithful to the novella by Stephen King (1408, Silver Bullet, Stand by Me), which Darabont makes small changes to the novella and the ending as well. Jane offers his best performance in this feature, which Jane appeared in a previous King misguided adaptation 'Dreamcatcher'. The performance in the picture are extremely good here, especially the scene-stealing performances by Harden and Jones. The creatures effects created by Oscar-Winner:Howard Berger (Hostel Part 1 & 2, The Chronciles of Narnia:The Lion-the Witch and the Wardrobe, John Carpenter's Vampires) and Gregory Nicotero (The Hills Have Eyes Part 1 & 2, Stephen King's Desperation, George A. Romero's Land of the Dead) are giving terrific F/X creature work. Which it's one of the highlights of this movie.The two-disc set of 'The Mist' is great. First DVD is the original theatrical version, which DVD has an sharp anamorphic Widescreen (1.85:1) transfer and an strong Dolby Digital 5.1 Surround Sound. Disc one includes an running commentary track by the filmmaker, deleted scenes with optional commentary, an featurette about the art of movie posters and webisodes. Second disc has the terrific looking Black & White feature of the movie with introduction by the filmmaker. I think 'The Mist' looks ever better and creepier in Black & White. Disc two also includes an documentary and three featurettes. 'The Mist' did so-so business at the box office, when it was first released in the winter of 2007. Some of the top film critics felt 'The Mist' was something special while others didn't. But die-hard fans of Stephen King's books or films truly loved this movie best. But the feature certainly does have an second life on DVD. Since Darabont previously directed an Stephen King adaptation named 'The Shawshank Redemption' became an instead classic once it hit Video and Television back in 1995. There was a few strong horror movies that came out in 2007 but 'The Mist' was certainly one of the best horror film of 2007 with an heartbreaking bleak conclusion. There's an great use of 'The Host of Seraphin' song by Dead Can Dance. Don't miss it. Darabont also wrote the screenplay and he's one of the producers as well. (****/*****).",8,1,4,27 July 2008
I Am Legend," Somewhat truer adaptation of the two previous adaptations of 'I Am Legend'.
","Now in the year 2012, three years after the horrifying plague that was unintentional release by a Scientist (Uncredited Cameo by Oscar-Winner:Emma Thompson), who was trying to find a cure for cancer. Now in the empty streets of New York City, U.S. Army virologist Lieutenant Colonel Robert Neville (Will Smith) is living all alone in the city with his dog Samantha. Who is still trying to find a cure for the virus, there's 9 percent of the whole world that infected humans turned into violent, strong blood-thirsty creatures. Which they are also sensitive to the daylight that could kill them. Since 90 percent of the world, the population is finish. But these creatures also have an mind of their own, since they want to kill Neville as well.Directed by Francis Lawrence (Constantine) made an entertaining science-fiction drama with moments of suspense and horror. This version takes the premise (Based on a novel by Richard Matheson) more seriously comparing to the previous adaptations like 'The Last Man on Earth' or 'The Omega Man'. Smith is truly good in his role, which makes this movie worth watching. Even the dog is great. Director Lawrence makes effective use of making New York City isolated by adding clever used of CGI effects. It's also much better than the director's first feature. Perphas the worst CGI effects in the film are the looks of the creatures are not very effective (They look phony at times sadly). But it's a good thing, it is not a total turn-off in my opinion.The single disc edition, DVD has an sharp anamorphic Widescreen (2.35:1) transfer and an strong Dolby Digital 5.1 Surround Sound. DVD only special features are the four short animated features. The feature clever use of Widescreen will be lost on DVD, especially the wide NYC shots. Lawrence's second feature is a terrific 2/3 of a movie but sadly when two human characters shows up to help Neville. It becomes an different picture in someway. This movie might be too religious for some taste as well. There's also two-disc set of 'I Am Legend'. Which the second disc includes an extended version with a few additional scenes but the biggest change is the different ending. Which it fleshing out the characters of the creatures but also changes the faith of the lead character. I prefer the original theatrical version instead.'I Am Legend' is not the great film i was hoping to be but overall it is still pretty good as entertainment. Smith's role certainly helps the movie a lot. It certainly looked terrific at the big screen. Screenplay by Mark Protosevich (The Cell, Poseidon) and Oscar-Winner:Akiva Goldsman (Batman Forever, A Beautiful Mind, I Robot). Goldsman is also one of the producers as well. Super 35.

Amazingly enough, this is based on a true story.Directed by Sidney Lumet (Before the Devil Knows You're Dead, Network, Serpico) made an highly entertaining, dark crime comedy with some drama and amusing sense of humour. Pacino is terrific is his Oscar nominated performance, he brings life to this movie. The late Cazale is also very good as the simple-minded criminal. In fact, this feature has an strong cast including Charles Durning, James Broderick, Carol Kane, Chris Sarandon (Who is nominated for his wonderful supporting performance) and Lance Henriksen.

Ghostbusters," Great 1980's comedy that still holds up well today.

This film was one of the most memorable Big Budget movies of the 1980's. The characters are so likable, often very funny and it has timeless feel to the story. Which it was created by Dan Arkroyd (The Blues Brothers, Coneheads, Dragnet), who had originally written different script and the premise took place in a future instead of present day. Which Arkroyd re-written the script with Harold Ramis (Analyze This, Caddyshack, Groundhog Day) to fleshing out the characters more. Ernie Hudson also co-stars as the new 'Ghostbuster' in the group named Winston Zeddmore and Annie Potts as the 'Ghostbusters' secretary.DVD has an good anamorphic Widescreen (2.35:1) transfer and an fine Dolby Digital 5.1 Surround Sound.

One of the reasons why 'Ghostbusters' worked so well over the years, because the humour is so good, the cast are first-rate, there's memorable Special Effects moments and the premise is certainly most amusing. Which all those things made 'Ghostbusters' a modern classic with film critics and people of all ages still loved this movie. Ray Parker Jr. memorable theme song might have overshadow Oscar-Winner:Elmer Bernstein (Airplane!, An American Werewolf in London, Heavy Metal) wonderful music score of the picture. This is one of those movies that will always find an new generation of audiences to enjoy. If you haven't seen it, don't miss it. Panavision. (****/*****).",8,0,0,28 June 2008
Gran Torino," Excellent 'Eastwood' film, one of his best works as a filmmaker and actor.
","Walt Kowalski (Four-Time Oscar Winner:Clint Eastwood) is a Korean war veteran lives in a tough neighborhood of Detroit. His wife recently passed away, he's not very close with his two sons (Brian Haley and Brian Howe) and his grand-kids have no respect for him.

When their push Thao and his family too far, it seems there's nothing... they could do about it until Walt doesn't show fear to this gang of thugs. For the first time in years... Walt does have something to live for.Produced and Directed by Clint Eastwood (Changeling, Million Dollar Baby, Mystic River) made an moving drama that is actually very funny at times but also tough and emotional as well. Eastwood offers one of his best works as a filmmaker and as well for giving one of his best performances since 'Unforgiven'). Vang and Her offer credible performances in their roles. Newcomer Christopher Carley offers an fine performance as a 27 year-old virgin (As the character of Walt would call him) Father Janovich. Which the Father Janovich character is watching over Walt after he made an promise to Walt's late wife. Eastwood plays an flawed but tough, funny and very human person... what makes this movie so memorable. So far, it is my favorite film from 2008. I know there's some critics and audiences didn't think much of this film, maybe it is a matter of personal taste. But it would be nice if 'Gran Torino' would received some major Oscar Nominations. Don't miss it. Eastwood's sons Scott appears in a cameo and Kyle co-wrote the music score. Panavision. (**** ½/*****).",9,2,5,11 January 2009

But the story is surprisingly weak and it is somewhat short on laughs. But it is saved by good characterization by the talented vocal cast. Fiona, Queen Lillian, Cinderella, Doris, Sleeping Beauty and Snow White has some amusing funny bits but it is Donkey and Puss in Boots steals the show. This is certainly going to be one of the biggest hits of 2007. This is the least satisfying of the three movies but it is still fun, nonetheless. (*** ½/*****).",8,17,34,18 May 2007

Witt shows some flair with action sequences, some decent visual camera work, he manages to have an good cast here but although Witt isn't quite as strong a filmmaker as Paul W.S. Anderson (Which he wrote the script) did on the original. Witt uses too much of slow motion at times, especially when the Zombies shows-up. It seems very unnecessary, it has an very bad jarring feel to it and the sequel is clumsy at times. At least, the actors kept it entertaining for the right or wrong reasons. Since it has its shares of unintentional moments.I have to admit, i hated this sequel. When i first viewed it on DVD back in 2004. I was expecting to be creepy as the original did but i didn't expect to be goofier in this one. I do like the idea in the sequel that the zombies and monsters are running around attacking the city. After just watching it again recently, i do enjoy a bit more than i first seen it. But the sequel is still an mess with an truly flawed third act and it has at least two endings in the feature. But although 'Resident Evil:Apocalyspe' was an improvement over the second one, despite the characters of Jill and Angie are not in third film.On the Resurrected Edition DVD, this film is a double feature with the original. DVD has an sharp anamorphic Widescreen (2.35:1) and an strong Dolby Digital 5.1 Surround Sound. Which the surrounds on the sequel are quite impressive at times, especially the Church sequence. On the second disc, there's an additional special features were not on the original 2-Disc DVD Set back in 2004. It would be nice, if the DVD included three running commentaries tracks but they didn't.

Saw II," This strong sequel is suspenseful, clever and almost just as good as the first one.
","It's been over a year that an sadistic man, who is known as Jigsaw (Tobin Bell) is been punishing his victims by designing bizarre traps by forcing his victims to play a game by letting his victims a chance to get out of the various traps but he is also teaching them the value of life. Since Jigsaw is dying from Cancer. An stubborn detective (Donnie Wahlberg) is trying to built a relationship with his troubled son (Erik Knudsen). The detective find out that his son is been kidnapped by Jigsaw and placing his son trapped with seven other people (Shawnee Smith, Franky G, Emmanuelle Vaugier, Glenn Plummer, Beverly Mitchell, Timothy Burd and Tony Nappo) in an apartment building somewhere in the city. But this detective has less than two hours to save his son and others before they get killed by Poison, which is already inserted in their bodies. Which these eight people have to find an anti-dote to save themselves.Directed by first-time filmmaker:Darren Lynn Bousman made an entertaining sequel to 'Saw'. Which the sequel has some of the same intensity of the first film. Which this sequel is more of a horror movie than a thriller like the first picture. But this sequel contains some terrific suspenseful surprises that is different but just as clever as the original. The film has good performances and it is also fast-paced. This sequel has more to do for the actors:Bell, Smith and Dina Meyer. Which Meyer plays an forensic officer, which these three actors were briefly seen in the original film. DVD has an sharp anamorphic widescreen (1.85:1) transfer and an strong-Dolby Digital 5.1 Expanded Surround Sound. DVD has an amusing commentary track by co-writer/director:Lynn Bousman & actors:Wahlberg and Mitchell. DVD also has featurettes, theatrical trailer, storyboards and more. Some of the violence is genuinely grisly and unappealing but that's the point of this horror movie. Watch for film horror/fantasy critic:John Fallon (from 'arrowinthehead.com') in a cameo as a S.W.A.T. Video Technician. This script was originally written by the director, which it had nothing to do with 'Saw'. Leigh Whannell, who played 'Adam' in the original. Which Whannell re-wrote the script with the director. This is a satisfying sequel for horror fans and for those who liked the original. Whannell and James Wan (The Director of 'Saw' and upcoming 'Silence') are among the executive producers.

From Dusk Till Dawn," Entertaining action extravaganza with plenty of humor and gore.
","Seth Gecko (Oscar-Winner:George Clooney) and Richard Gecko (Oscar-Winner:Quentin Tarantino) are vicious low-lifes criminals on the run. Seth is a professional bank thief, who kills if he has to but his brother Richard is much more worse... he also rapes woman for pleasure. The Gecko Brothers are hoping to cross the Mexican boarder somehow but they decided to kidnapped three middle-class people by the name of the Fuller Family (Harvey Keitel, Juliette Lewis and Ernest Liu) on their RV. The Gecko Brothers are supposed to meet their contact at a seedy bar in Mexico in the middle of nowhere titled 'From Dusk Till Dawn'. The Gecko Brothers and The Fuller Family, they kidnapped... they are amazed what kind of bar it is. But those dancers, the bartender (Danny Trejo), the band or the sexy owner of the bar by the name of Santanico Pandemonium (Salma Hayek) are not what they seemed to be... they are actually Vampires. They prey on Truckers and Bikers to feed or to turn others into Vampires. While Seth lost his brothers, while nearly everyone in the bar turned into vampires. Now Seth, The Fuller Family and two other survivors (Fred Williamson & Tom Savini) stay together to fight these creatures till dawn for survival.Directed by Robert Rodriguez (The El Mariachi Trilogy, Spy Kids Trilogy, The Faculty) made an entertaining cheesy Horror/Action film with plenty of amusing moments and over the top gore. Director Rodriguez and Screenwriter:Tarantino (Kill Bill Vol.1 & Vol.2, Pulp Fiction, Reservoir Dogs) certainly have fun with their casting choices. 'From Dusk Till Dawn' is one of those movies, where the cast & crew truly seems to be having one hell of a time making this drive-in style movie. Tarantino certainly has an ear for terrific dialogue, especially during the first half of the movie. Which it is totally different from the second half. Although a minor box office disappointment and the critics give this mixed reviews... 'From Dusk Till Dawn' went on to be a Cult Classic on Video.DVD has an sharp non-anamorphic Widescreen (1.85:1) transfer and an strong Dolby Digital 5.1 Surround Sound. Disc one has an enjoyable commentary track by Rodriguez and Tarantino, two featurettes (One of them has Commentary with Rodriguez and Make-Up Effects Artists:Greg Nictero) and more. Disc two has an very entertaining documentary titled 'Full Till Boogie', an fun behind the scenes look with the cast & crew.The Alliance Blu-ray has an sharp anamorphic (1.78:1) transfer and an terrific DTS 5.1 HD Sound. But sadly, the disc has no special features. 'From Dusk Till Dawn' went on to produced two prequels with Rodriguez, Tarantino and Lawrence Bender involved as Executive Producers. But nothing tops the original... it is certainly one of the most remembered Cult Classic films of the 1990's. Don't miss it. Some familiar faces like Cheech Marin, John Saxon, Kelly Preston and more appears in bit parts. Although Marin plays three different characters in the movie. (****/*****).",8,0,0,9 January 2009
The Big Blue," Beautiful cinematography with some terrific performances from the cast makes up most of the flaws.
","From the mid 1960's in Greece, a young boy named Jacques (Bruce Guerre-Berthelot) lost his father, when he died from a serious unexpected accident from losing pressure being under the sea. Which it traumatized him over the years until he becomes an man. Over twenty years has passed, Jacques (Jean Marc-Barr) is a professional diver, who longs under the sea without air for several minutes. When an assurance investigator from New York named Johana (Rosanna Arquette) falls in love with Jacques meeting him at first sight. She becomes very fascinated with this interesting if very shy man. Jacques' best friend Enzo (Jean Reno) wants him to be his rival at the diving competition. Which Enzo is the current diving champion. Johana becomes close friends with Jacques and Enzo, which she's enjoying their company. But Jacques is often quite unusual, since he feels more connected with the sea and the dolphin than any human begins. While Johana and Jacques fall in love, they try very hard to make their relationship work.Directed by Luc Besson (The Fifth Element, The Messenger:The Story of Joan of Arc, Subway) made an intriguing if flawed film about the sea, diving, love and friendships. Carlo Varini's widescreen cinematography is one of the true highlights of this movie. Which it looks great on land and especially in the sea. The picture comes alive... when they focus on the sea, especially the deep diving sequences and Jacques's connections to the dolphins are the film's best moments. Barr's performance is especially good but Reno steals the show with his often good hearted performance as the man, who compete's endlessly with his best friend. Arquette's role is annoying at first but her character improves during the second half.I never seen the original U.S. version, which it was shorter and it had Bill Conti's score. I am sure the characterization of the American Cut didn't make much sense as the french version did and it had Eric Serra's original score. This is the review for the Director's Cut, which he added 50 minutes more in this new version. Besson added more character development to make them more satisfying than they were in the U.S. and French versions. Sometimes the feature switches mood from being a Drama, Comedy and Fantasy. Which it is not entirely successful.DVD has an sharp if occasionally grainy anamorphic Widescreen (2.35:1) transfer and an good Dolby Digital 5.1 Surround Sound. DVD includes an isolated music score, a brief photo gallery, cast & crew information and the U.S. theatrical trailer (The American trailer makes it looked like it was a big Science-Fiction adventure, which it's not). 'The Big Blue' must have been something at the big screen for sure. Of course, it doesn't reach the same impact on video. Overall i liked this movie but i didn't loved it. At times, i felt 'The Big Blue' was empty experience at times. I just think Besson did better movies as a director, screenwriter or producer. I think he had different opinions from the screenwriters, since he wrote it with four other writers. But for sure, it was a personal project for Besson and i respect that. 'The Big Blue' is a good one but if they were playing it at the film festival and i finally get to see it in a movie theater. I would see it again... only at the Big Screen. Technovision.

Charlie and the Chocolate Factory," This remake of the original 1971 film has updated special effects and terrific production designs but still isn't as magical or entertaining as the original film.
","Charlie Bucket (Freddie Highmore) comes from an poor family. He lives with his hard working father (Noah Taylor), his homemaker mother (Helena Bonham Carter), his loving Grandpa Joe (David Kelly) and three other grandparents (Liz Smith, Eileen Essell and David Morris). They struggle with everyday life and their home is falling apart, bit by bit. Charlie hopes for a better life for him and his family. But one day, Charlie hears that there's upcoming contest about very successful Chocolate Factory. Who's owned by Willy Wonka (Johnny Deep), who's giving five golden tickets inside Chocolate Bars that he hidden inside all through the world. Since it's been found by four other kids by Veruca Salt (Julia Winter), who's a spoiled brat. Augustas Gloop (Philip Wiegratz), an overweight kid... who truly loves Chocolate. Violet Beuragrade (AnnaSophia Robb), an ambitious champion gum chewer. Mike Teevee (Jordan Fry), who's loves watching TV too much and playing Videogames. After Charlie buys a few chocolate bars before with no luck but when he finds 10 dollars outside. He decides to try one last time at a store and he has find the last chocolate bar with the golden ticket. Charlie can't go alone in the Chocolate Factory and he has to bring an adult with him. He brings his Grandpa Joe, who's used to work for Wonka in the past. Once Charlie and his Grandpa Joe enter the Chocolate Factory with the other winners. They finally get to meet the mysterious and bizarre Willa Wonka. Once they enter the chocolate factory, they see strange things and they encounter working & singing Oompa Loompas. But Willy isn't what he seems to be and he's having flashbacks to the his troubled childhood with his stricter father (Christopher Lee). Willy holds an special surprise for the winner, for those who don't get distract by the factory.Directed by Tim Burton (Batman, Ed Wood, Planet of the Apes '2001') made an entertaining updated version of the classic 1971 film, which the original film was titled 'Willy Wonka and the Chocolate Factory' for some reason. Which is Based on a novel by Roald Dahl (James and the Giant Peach, Matilda, The Witches). Highmore's performance in the film is the heart of this picture, Deep's role seems to do an creepy imitation of Controvesial Pop-Star:Michael Jackson at times but it's Deep Roy's role (Who plays all the Oompa Loompas) steals the show with amazing music score by Danny Elfman (Men in Black, Nacho Libre, Sleepy Hallow). Beautiful production designs by Alex McDowell (The Crow, Fight Club, Minority Report) are also the highlights of this movie as well.DVD has an sharp Pan & Scan (1.33:1) transfer and an strong Dolby Digital 5.1 Surround Sound. DVD has an featurette about Roy's role and creating Oompa Loompas for the film, an Oompa Loompas dance machine featurette and the original theatrical trailer. The first act of the film works great until we enter 'The Chocolate Factory'. The film turns mean-spirited, odd, bizarre and dumb all at once. Highmore keeps the film together, however and it is certainly Burton's strangest Mainstream film since 'Batman Returns'. It is also the least successful Burton film (to me anyway) so far. Deep's role isn't as memorable as we expect and he doesn't come close to surpass Gene Wilder's role in the film. But Kids will love it, so do fans of Burton's work and Deep's roles as well. Screenplay by Johm August (Charlie's Angels, Go, Titan A.E.). (*** ½/*****).",8,0,2,28 August 2007
Major League," Likable baseball comedy with an good comedic cast.
","The Cleveland Indians have been losing for decades. An former showgirl turned owner of the team, Rachel Phelps (Margaret Whitton) is hoping to move the team to Miami, if the team enters dead last in the season. She decides to hires has beens, ex-cons and even players with no talent behind the game. Veteran catcher Jake Taylor (Tom Berenger), who has bad knees is given one last chance to play with the leagues. An incarcerated but talented if trouble pitcher Rick Vaughn (Charlie Sheen) has an chance to play with the big leagues as well. The brash but speedy Willie 'Mays' Hayes (Wesley Snipes), veteran pitcher (Chelcie Ross) who lacks an strong arm, an voodoo practices baseball player (Dennis Haysbert) has trouble hitting curve balls, an spoiled third baseman (Corbin Bernsen) who is already under contract and Lou Brown (James Gammon) is hired by Phelps since he knows how to manage an baseball team. Since Phelps expects nothing for this team. The Cleveland Indians will do their best to prove her wrong.Written and Directed by David S. Ward (Major League 2, Down Periscope, King Ralph) made an likable baseball comedy with an amusing comedic cast. It's an pleasant comedy if unremarkable movie at times. But it is played straight with some funny satire as well. Berenger and Sheen are certainly good in the movie. Berenger has an nice subplot romance with Rene Russo, who plays his ex-wife in the movie. But it is Gammon, Haysbert and even Bob Uecker as the baseball announcer have the better moments in the movie. An surprise box office hit during the spring of 1989. Which it's spawned an so-so sequel and an decent third movie. 'Major League' did went on to have an loyal cult following. The movie certainly tries hard to be the next 'Slap Shot', although not totally successful. Still, it is an good movie. Charles Cyphers, who is best known for John Carpenter movies like 'Halloween' and 'The Fog' has an nice supporting role as the general manager of the team. (****/*****).",8,0,1,23 September 2010
The Dark Knight," Darker Sequel to 'Batman Begins' has strong performances and an great visual look.
","Bruce Wayne/Batman (Christian Bale) is still fighting crime in Gotham City, while he finally captured Scarecrow (Cillian Murphy is a rather amusing cameo from the first film). Now Batman faces his greatest challenge when an brilliant mastermind but totally insane criminal named The Joker (Heath Ledger) is trying the convinced some of the most dangerous gangster in Gotham City to kill Batman and while The Joker has plans of his own. While in the city, an top district attorney named Harvey Dent (Aaron Eckhart) tries to do good in the city with the help of his girlfriend named Rachel Dawes (Maggie Gyllenhaal). While Bruce/Batman still has feelings for Rachel, since she knows his other life as a crime fighter. Dent's plan is stop the notorious gangsters in the city like Salvatore 'Sal' Moroni (Eric Roberts) but Dent needs prove, since the Chinese business man named Lau (Chin Han). Which Lau is also an account for this gangsters in Gotham City but he escape from the city before Lieutenant/Commissioner James Gordon (Gary Oldman) and the other police offices to stop him. But Batman faces out that The Joker is a actually a bigger threat in the city than the gangsters, while The Joker is planning something very sinister in Gotham City that no one will never forget.Directed by Christopher Nolan (Insomnia '2002', Memento, The Prestige) made an strong darker sequel to 'Batman Begins'. Which it was also made by the same filmmaker. Nolan has an great eye for visual style in this one, the production designs are excellent, the cast are wonderful (Especially the late Ledger and Eckhart) but the story does have some problems early on in the feature and it is occasionally confusing at times. But screenwriters David S. Goyer (Blade Series, The Crow:City of Angels, The Puppet Masters) and by the filmmaker's brother Johathan Nolan) came up with impressive character moments and it has some of the most unexpected plot twists in recent features. 'The Dark Knight' is notable for Ledger's last leading performance, which he is outstanding although he does has one final performance in Terry Gilliam's upcoming feature named 'The Imaginarium of Doctor Parnassus'. Originally Ledger's role was a leading performance but since Ledger unexpectedly passed away early this year, which the picture has filmed half-way through. Now Gilliam's stopped the production and he quickly re-written his script to have Ledger's character also played by three other actors in the picture! I also enjoyed a lot Eckhart's good-hearted performance as Harvey Dent, i felt in the third act when Dent becomes Two-Face. I think his Two-Face character was much more creepier than The Joker in my opinion. Gyllenhaal was an major improvement over the role, which it was originally played by Katie Holmes in the first feature. Which i felt that Holmes was one of the few weakest things in 'Batman Begins'. Two Time Oscar-Winner:Michael Caine as Bruce's loyal butler/friend/father figure Alfred gives the movie's lighter moments. It was nice to see Oscar-Winner:Morgan Freeman back in the role as Lucius Fox. It was a hoot seeing Michael Jai White as a gangster (Since he's best known for playing the hero from hell in 'Spawn') in a bit, especially in the scene when he calls The Joker a clown. Which i nearly had flashbacks of 'Spawn'. Which only a few of the movie audiences got the in-joke. Also Anthony Micheal Hall, William Fichtner and uncredited Nicky Katt appeared in small memorable roles as well.There's only a few minor things i was disappointed with 'The Dark Knight', especially early on and the way they handle the Scarecrow character. Which it was played so brilliantly by Murphy in the original, i felt it was reduced to a second-rate villain in this one. I felt most of the audiences were extremely confused by Nolan's well-staged action sequences at times. It is also very dark looking at times as well but that was necessary to the story. I am still not sure, if i thought 'The Dark Knight' is better than 'Batman Begins'. But i think 'The Dark Knight' is the most enjoyable of the Batman Movies since the highly under-appreciated 'Batman Returns' 16 years ago. 'The Dark Knight' is also one of those rare sequels where Evil could overcome Good, which usually Hollywood shy away from these days. But if you are curious to see it, see it on the big screen and especially on IMAX. Which it should look superior than the regular screen movie screen for the 2.35:1 aspect ratio. Don't miss it. Panavision. (****/*****).",8,3,7,20 July 2008

Former Soccer British Player John Colby (Two-Time Oscar Winner:Michael Caine) passes his time in prison by playing soccer with the inmates. When a major Nazi officer (Max Von Sydow) also loves the game of soccer, he asked Colby if he could form a team to play against all-star German players. The major wants the game to be played in Paris, France to attract people from all over Europe. An ambitious American Soldier Robert Hatch (Sylvester Stallone) wants to be in the team but he wants to escape as well by one of the inmates making him an good looking fake passport. But Hatch's plan becomes more complicated, when the other prisoners asked him for his help to contact the resistance as well. Now Hatch and the others have to plan to escape during the high profile game in Paris.Directed by John Huston (The African Queen, The Maltese Falcon, Moby Dick) made an entertaining, old-fashioned adventure that is loosely based on a true story. Caine and Von Sydow certainly add class to this movie. Stallone does his best with his role but some viewers might find it unintentionally hilarious to see Stallone being a soccer goaler is certainly one of the film's least realistic moments. Although an box office disappointment, 'Victory' has become an cult favorite for years.DVD has an good anamorphic Widescreen (2.35:1) transfer (also in Pan & Scan) and an decent Dolby 2.0 Mono Sound. The DVD's only extra is the original theatrical trailer. 'Victory' does has some good moments, especially when Pelé shows up on screen and there's some good camera work by Cinematographer:Gerry Fisher (The Exorcist 3, The Ninth Configuration, Wolfen). 'Victory' is basically good simple entertainment but it is occasionally silly as well. Worth a look. Panavision. (*** ½/*****).",8,1,1,31 December 2008
Grindhouse," Excellent Double Features by two maverick filmmakers.
","In this double feature of One of the Top Filmmakers in Hollywood:Robert Rodriguez and Quentin Tarantino. These two directors presents their films in the tradition of the 1970's and 1980's. Their films in presented with intentionally missing reels in both features and hilarious fake trailers in between their movies.The First Feature is 'Planet Terror'. When a go-go dancer (Rose McGowan) is searching for a better life. While of a group of soldiers (Lead by Bruce Willis) are infected with a virus. Which turns them into vicious, hungry, violent maniacs. While they searching for a cure. While they affect another people in a small Texas Town. This dancer finds help from her ex-boyfriend (Freddy Rodriguez) and a group of survivors. Which they are trying to get out of the small town before the virus spread upon the whole world.The Second Feature is 'Death Proof'. A seemingly charming stunt man, which ironically his name goes by Stuntman Mike (Kurt Russell). Actually Stuntman Mike is a psychotic sexual predator that goes after attractive ladies. Which he's stalking them from afar and he also used his stunt car as a weapon. But he meets his match, when he meets a pair of Stunt Woman (Tracie Thoms and Zoe Bell) and an actress (Rosario Dawson). Which Stuntman Mike and The Ladies find themselves in a dangerous car race between life and death.'Planet Terror' is Written and Directed by Robert Rodriguez (Spy Kids Trilogy, El Mariachi, The Faculty). Rodriguez's film is a tongue-in-cheek action feature with an fun blend of science-fiction and horror. McGowan offers an terrific, fresh, funny performance as the unwillingly heroine. But she finds herself with a strong cast including:Josh Brolin, Michael Biehn, Marley Shelton, Jeff Fahey, Naveen Andrews, Michael Parks, Fergie Ferguson and Tom Savini. Filmmaker:Quentin Tarantino appears in a hilarious bit part. This is also Rodgriguez's most entertaining schlock movie since 'From Dusk Till Dawn'. Which Tarantino wrote that film as well and appearing in a supporting role. In 'Planet Terror', Rodriguez also produced, co-edited, co-compose the music score, photographed and his own chef as well. Panavision.Before 'Planet Terror' starts... a fake action-packed trailer appears, written and directed by Rodriguez titled 'Machete'. Starring Danny Trejo, Jeff Fahey and Cheech Marin.'Death Proof' is Written and Directed by Quentin Tarantino (Jackie Brown, Reservoir Dogs, Pulp Fiction). Tarantino's film is loving tribute to movies likes 'Dirty Mary Crazy Larry', 'Duel' and 'Vanishing Point'. Kurt Russell is perfectly cast in the lead. Russell offers one of his best roles in years. The female cast are terrific, including:Vanessa Ferlito, Jordon Ladd, Sydney Poitier, Mary Elizabeth Winstead and Rose McGowan. Filmmakers:Quentin Tarantino and Eli Roth (Cabin Fever, Hostel part 1 and 2) appears in small roles. Tarantino's movie offers strong dialogue and one of the most, wildest car chase in a while. Tarantino's picture is also old-fashioned as well. Michael Parks, James Parks and Marley Shelton appears in cameos. Tarantino also produced and he nicely photographed the film as well. Panavision.Before 'Death Proof' starts, three fake trailers are featured. 'Werewolf Woman of the SS'-A parody of the infamous 1970's S&M films, written and directed by Rob Zombie. 'Don't'-a haunted house styled, written and directed by Edgar Wright. 'Thanksgiving'-a hilarious slasher spoof, co-written and directed by Eli Roth.These two features are clever, funny, gory and exciting but sadly these movie didn't played well at the box office, despite strong reviews by the critics. Most countries are going to release these films separately due of poor box office run in the United States­. These movies are instant cult classics and they will be extremely popular, once they are released on DVD. Rodriguez and Tarantino will expand their feature films on DVD. No doubt, they will put the missing reels back in their pictures. Definitely it was a nice try to put new movies as double-feature but ultimately failed sadly... But Don't miss your chance to see it in the Big Screen before it is too late. Both films (**** 1/2 out of *****).",9,0,1,29 April 2007

But for those who have the original Saw DVD is still a keeper, because of director:Wan and co-writer/actor:Whannell amusing commentary on the original first disc.The film also stars:Danny Glover (Glover appears in a sadly under-written as a obsessed police detective), Monica Potter, Micheal Emerson, Ken Leung, Tobin Bell, Shawnee Smith and Dina Meyer. Despite the film's budget problems, some unexplained logic moments and a poor but brief car chase scene. Saw manages enough to be an unpleasant but well directed and effective film. Hollywood should watch the talents for director:Wan and Actor/Writer:Whannell. This is one of the most profitable horror film since 'The Blair Witch Project'. Written by actor:Whannell. From a story by director:Wan and actor:Whannell. Followed by a sequel. (****/*****).",8,0,1,24 August 2005

Marshall's premise is certainly familiar (especially last year's good looking but extremely flawed picture 'The Cave') but somehow Marshall manages to make it fresh with strong horror sequences and vivid charaterzations from the cast makes this more than a memorable film. Like many movies these days, there's some flaws and also the ending was changed for the U.S. release (Since the original U.K. release had a more darker satisfying conclusion). 'The Descent' is certainly the most impressive fantasy/horror/thriller in a while. Super 35. (****/*****).",8,3,7,5 September 2006

Thinking that they will be safe in the country but it turns much more worst, because of the unexplained phenomenon has something to do with mother nature.Written and Directed by M. Night Shaylaman (The Sixth Sense, Unbreakable, The Village) made an intriguing horror film, which the director nearly pulls off making a hard R-Rated flick. There's some memorable violent sequences but maybe not enough of it. Walhberg is good in the role and the supporting cast are fine. The movie starts out great and it's impressive for awhile. Effective first half soon loses its edge and never quite recover but at least, it's an improvement over the director's previous feature ¨Lady in the Water¨.DVD has an sharp anamorphic Widescreen (1.85:1) transfer and an good Dolby Digital 5.1 Surround Sound. DVD includes Deleted Scenes with introduction by the director, featurettes and an gag reel. ¨The Happening¨ isn't quite the feature, i was expecting but it's somewhat close.

But they meet all sorts of troubles, they witness an wave of mass destruction and death. Now the human race must have new ways to destroy this aliens before taking over.Directed by four-time Oscar Winner:Steven Spielberg (Jaws, Schindler's List, Murich) made an vivid, science-fiction thriller with elements of drama and horror. Cruise gives an good performance here. Which Cruise rarely plays a father in the movies. Fanning is terrific in the picture and newcomer Chatwin is also fine. Oscar-Winner:Tim Robbins has an small but credible role as a crazed man. Spielberg does gives you a real feeling of hopelessness and it is also quite haunting in this picture.DVD has an sharp anamorphic Widescreen (1.85:1) transfer and an terrific:DTS 5.1 Surround Sound (Also in Dolby Digital 5.1). This Single Disc Edition has only one featurette as an extra. This might be far from Spielberg's best works but he makes this film feels real with a certain doom that makes this remake worth seeing.

30 Days of Night," Visually impressive horror film is somewhat flawed in the script but it's certainly an well made film.
","In the small isolated town in Alaska each month in a year. The town goes to total darkness for 30 days. Which most villagers decides to stay somewhere else for the month. When a mysterious stranger (Ben Foster) is been killing dogs and causing trouble in a small diner. The local sheriff Eben Oleson (Josh Hartnett) is trying to find out, where's this stranger came from. The sheriff's soon to be ex-wife Stella (Melissa George) finds herself stuck in this village as well. Now very strange things are starting to happen, when the villagers are getting attacked from the unknown. This stranger brings this eerie group of people. Which they are strong, violent and they are hungry for blood. Which they are vampires are attacking and feeding on these villagers for the whole month. They will not stop attacking until the whole villagers are dead. Now Eben, Stella and a small group of survivors try to hold on from hiding and fighting these unstoppable vampires until the sunlight comes back.Directed by David Slade (Hard Candy) made an extremely well-acted, well directed Horror movie with a few genuine moments of suspense and terror. Slade's visual style is the highlight of this film, which it's based on a graphic comic novel by Steve Niles and Ben Templesmith. Slade certainly echoes some of the style of the earlier films of John Carpenter. Even Mark Boone Junior, who had a small role as Vampire Slayer in the underrated Carpenter film 'Vampires'. The Vampires certainly has a presence in this, especially Danny Huston as 'Marlow'. Perphas the problems with '30 Days of Night' is probably not what some audiences or critics were expecting to be. I felt the script, could have been much better in places. But there's enough character development from the human characters and the vampires are kept mysterious enough in the film.Sadly, this horror movie was an box office disappointment. The reviews were certainly mixed, although '30 Days of Well' is possibly one of the most well received horror movie of this year by certain critics. The conclusion is certainly familiar to 'Blade 2'. There's also a few (unintentionally ?) laughs as well but there's strong moments of violence, gory and a few jolts as well. The production designs by Paul D. Austerberry (Resident Evil:Apocalyspe, Assault on Precient 13 '2005', Highwaymen) and the widescreen cinematography by Jo Williems are first-rate. I think, it's one of those films will be a cult favorite once it's release on DVD. It's one of the strongest 'Vampire' movies in a while but certainly not one of the best in the genre. It's one of those movies that certainly looks good in the Big Screen. It's worth viewing. Screenplay by Niles, Staurt Beattie (Collateral, Derailed) and Brian Nelson. Super 35.

He goes to Daniel to tell him, there's Oil in his father's farm. He tells him, he could make millions on his father's land. Daniel, H.W. and his assistant Fletcher (Ciaran Hinds) goes to Sunday's farm to find Oil. Which they do sooner enough but Daniel meets his match, when Paul's twin brother named Eli (Also played by Dano). Who's just as ambitious as Daniel but for different reasons. Eli wants to build an Church and he thinks, he's great preacher. But Daniel's life slowly changed... when his adapted son turns deaf, Eli becomes greedy by asking Daniel money and Daniel's mysterious half-brother Henry (Kevin J. O'Connor) shows up. Daniel's life turns darker and darker and oh yes, there will be blood.Written and Directed by Paul Thomas Anderson (Boogie Nights, Hard Eight, Magnolia) made an absorbing drama that manages to have an dark sense of comedy at times. Day-Lewis is excellent as the smart Oil dealer tycoon, who may be way over his head at times but he's an deeply flawed man. Which Day-Lewis own an Oscar for his memorable performance. The supporting cast are first-rate, especially young Freasier and Dano. But some viewers might be turned-off by Dano's tole as a young, slightly crazed preacher. Cinematographer Robert Elswit (Return of the Living Dead Part 2, Tomorrow Never Dies, Punch-Drunk Love) won an Oscar for his beautiful cinematography.The two-disc Collector's Set of 'There Will Be Blood' is somewhat disappointing. No audio commentary by the writer/director:P.T. Anderson (Although there's rumour, he stopped doing audio commentaries after his enjoyable infamous comments on 'Boogie Nights' or no behind the scenes footage. But the bonus disc on the special features are decent enough. DVD has an featurette made sometime in the 1920's titled 'The Story of Petroleum' with music by the film's composer Jonny Greenwood (Member of the band 'Radiohead'). DVD also includes moments that inspires the film by using old photographs of the 1920's with photos of Anderson's movie, deleted scene titled 'Fishing', dailies outtakes and trailers. Deleted Scene 'Fishing' is a good scene but it is easy why Director Anderson deleted it, because there's no place in the picture. Disc one has an sharp anamorphic Widescreen (2.35:1) transfer and an strong Dolby Digital 5.1 Surround Sound.'There Will Be Blood' is certainly one of the best movies of 2007. It may be not for everyone, some viewers might find it too slow. But i think, Anderson's film is fast-paced and fascinating. I wasn't sure what to make out of it at first but i did liked it. But after watching it in the second viewing, i loved it even more. At times, it seems that writer/director Anderson was paying tribute to the late Stanley Kubrick and the late Robert Altman & especially the music that sounds eerily enough to Kubrick's picture 'The Shining'. If you haven't seen this, don't miss it. Panavision. (**** 1/2 out of *****).",9,3,6,25 September 2008

Now Sidney (Neve Campbell), Randy (Jamie Kennedy), Dewey (David Arquette), Gale and Cotton Weary (Liev Schreiber) find themselves in danger. This killer certainly wants something from Sidney, so she's also putting her boyfriend (Jerry O'Connell) and her two friends (Timothy Olyphant & Elise Neal) in deep trouble as well.Directed by Wes Craven (The Hills Have Eyes, The Last House on the Left, Shocker) made an truly enjoyable sequel to 'Scream' that is even more entertaining and funnier than the original. The script by Kevin Williamson (Cursed, Teaching Miss Tingle) certainly made some truly fun writing about the rules of a sequel. This was just as a blockbusters as the original was. Some film critics (For example the late Gene Siskel) felt the sequel was much better.

The Blu-ray includes three featurettes, 28 minutes of deleted scenes (Some of the deleted moments are good), original theatrical trailer and an teaser trailer.'Bram Stoker's Dracula' is certainly an very good movie, it's does have some flawed moments. Sometimes, i felt, it was style over substance wins this movie over. It was certainly the last big hit that Coppola had in his career 18 years ago. 'Bram Stoker's Dracula' does get better over repeated viewings. The old fashioned special effects does help this movie. Winner of Three Oscars for Best Costume Design, for Best Sound Editing and Best Make-Up Effects. The movie also received an Oscar nominated for Best Art Direction-Set Decoration. Also Michael Ballhaus' (Air Force One, Goodfells, Outbreak) cinematography is excellent. 'Bram Stoker's Dracula' is a visually perfect film but for story-wise and Reeves' somewhat weak performance put it down a bit. Otherwise, if you are an fan of Vampire movies or Bram Stoker's novel, don't miss it. Written by James V. Hart (Contact, Mary Shelley's Frankenstein, Muppets Treasure Island).

Willis, who's always good as the unwilling hero at the wrong place at the wrong time. But this time Irons as the entertaining villain and Jackson, who gets the best lines. Both actors steals the show in the third of the series. McTiernan tries to make the third film different from the previous two films by shooting the movie with hand-held action sequences and making as gritty also. Although the script by Jonathan Hensleigh (Armaggeddon, Jumanji, The Punisher) is quite weak at times, the second half slows down too. But it's never boring and the ending seems rushed. The theatrical ending of the movie is actually an new ending of the movie. Still, it's enjoyable picture and fans of the 'Die Hard' series will love it. Panavision.

Now Ron becomes Furious and it becomes battle of the sexes.Directed by Adam McKay (Step Brothers, Talladega Nights:The Ballard of Ricky Bobby) made an amusing tongue in cheek take of the 1970's. Farrell is certainly hilarious in his role as a arrogant Anchorman. The actors are playing his fellow field reports are certainly having an great time, especially Carell playing the dumbest in the bunch. It is one of those movies, where the cast & crew seems to be having an great time. Fred Willard appears in a supporting as the News Director. Although the original version of the movie tested so badly, McKay had to re-shoot the movie for a second time. Basically removing the original sub-plot involving bank thieves. That version could be seen in 'Wake Up, Ron Burgundy' on the two-disc set of 'Anchorman'. Plenty of familiar faces appears in bit-parts or cameos, which most of them are uncredited. 'Anchorman' certainly went on to have an huge cult following on DVD and TV, if you haven't seen this. Don't miss, one of the most craziest and surprisingly original comedy of the decade.

Hancock," Despite poor reviews by film critics, 'Hancock' does have some solid surprises.
","John Hancock (Will Smith) is a alcoholic sarcastic superhero (The only of his kind) is living in a very modern world in Los Angeles. Hancock just doesn't care what the public thinks of him anymore and he does more damage than good by helping the police or trying to save civilians. Hancock saves the life of a corporate Public Relation by the name of Ray Embrey (Jason Bateman), who wants to resurrected Hancock's career for the public's eye. Hancock refuses at first, especially since he ignores Court Subpoenas and the damages that Hancock did in the city costs him millions of dollars. Hancock agrees to go in Prison for awhile to help the law enforcements and the public's eye change their minds about Hancock. Hancock gets to be friends with Ray and including his wife Mary (Oscar-Winner:Charlize Theron) and their young son Aaron (Jae Head). At first, Mary can't stand Hancock. Because he drinks heavily and he gives an bad impression to their son. When Hancock becomes an public hero again by saving hostages at the bank. Hancock slowly falls in love with Ray's wife but Mary doesn't appears as she seems to be to her family and Hancock.Directed by Peter Berg (Friday Night Lights, The Kingdom, The Rundown) made an entertaining action/fantasy/drama that has plenty of often dark comedy as well. The premise of 'Hancock' is somewhat original and it is completely different than what Marvel or DC Comics have to offer. Smith gives one of his best roles as 'Hancock', which he makes his character very flawed superman, who is also human. Theron and especially Bateman offers terrific supporting performances. Director Berg offers plenty of story for a movie that runs a little over 90 minutes but it feels tight in some areas of the sub-plots in the movie and the villain played by Eddie Marsan is seriously underwritten. 'Hancock' is one of those movies that film critics seems to hate badly (Only a few top named film critics like Roger Ebert or Peter Travers thought 'Hancock' was unique enough). I also heard that director Berg cut a few things out of the film to not get an R-Rating. Sometimes i think that 'Hancock' had a darker edge somewhere in the story but i am sure, it was cut for the cutting room floor and also reaching an bigger audiences for the PG-13 rating. I would love to see a Director's Cut of 'Hancock' if Berg is planning one. I really liked the picture and most of the audiences were enjoying it, when i saw it a big screen theater. I think this is Berg's best movie since the underrated first feature 'Very Bad Things'.The Unrated DVD of 'Hancock' adds 10 minutes of additional footage. It's includes scenes of the character of Hancock having an one night stand with an beautiful woman and longer kissing scene with Smith and Theron. DVD has an sharp anamorphic Widescreen (2.35:1) transfer and an strong Dolby Digital 5.1 Surround Sound. DVD includes five entertaining featurettes. If you haven't seen 'Hancock', see it at the big screen or the drive-in. I think, you won't regret it. Daeg Faerch, who's best known for playing the young Michael Myers in the infamous remake of Rob Zombie's Halloween appears in a funny sequence with Smith. Mike Epps appears uncredited in a hilarious cameo as the Hostage Taker. Smith and filmmaker Michael Mann (Ali, Heat, Manhunter) are among the film's producers. Super 35. (****/*****).

Star Wars: Episode III - Revenge of the Sith," This latest Star Wars film is Better than Some of the Sequels and Prequels.
","The Galaxy, it is at War! When General Grievous (Voiced by Matthew Wood) is planning to destroy the capital planet of Coruscant and Kill the Supereme Chancelor Palpatine (Ian McDiarmid). Obi Wan Kenboi (Ewan McGregor) and Anakin Skywlaker (Hayden Christensen) are sent to stop General Grievous and find the mysterious Darth Sith, the dark side of the force.

When the Other Jedis are curious about the Chancelor Palpatine new plans, they send Anakin as a Spy to look what is Chancelor Palpatine up to. But Anakin discovers a dark secret about Chancelor Palpatine, who he really is.Written and Directed by George Lucas made an entertaining and dark sequel to Star Wars. This Third Episode is actually darker than the Fifth Episode-The Empire Strikes Back. But not as memorable as Episode Five. Hayden Christensen is in most of the film. He is actually the lead actor in this film. Natalie Portman is barely in it, Her role is about 20 minutes in the film.The real highlight is the strong performances by Christensen, McGregor and McDiarmid. CGI Performance of Yoda (Voiced by Frank Oz) is also strong. Samuel L. Jackson has some good moments as Mace Windu. Peter Mayhew appears in a bit role as Chewbacca, where we meet him in the Original Star Wars. The film has terrific Visual Effects by Lucas' F/X Studio-Industrial, Light and Magic. The film features wonderful music by John Williams.This is a fast paced, dark sequel. This film is a improvement over Episode 2:Attack of the Clones and maybe Episode 1:The Phantom Menace. Episode 3 is certainly better than Episode 6:Return of the Jedi. Only flaw, it is just not memorable as the Original Star Wars or especially-The Empire Strikes Back. This is the first PG-13 film for Star Wars film for its intense violence situations and dark subject matter. This is an uneven sequel but this is some of Lucas' best work as a filmmaker since American Graffiti! Kenny Baker steals the show in the first act as R2-D2 and Anthony Daniels is back briefly as C-3PO. Christopher Lee reprise his role very briefly as Count Dooku. HD 24P Widescreen.

Ray," Highly stylized, entertaining Bio-Pic drama.
","Ray Charles Robinson (Jamie Foxx) is a extremely talented pianist and singer as well. Ray is an smart man as well. Ray started his career in the late 1940's before he finds his distinctive style. Ray is certainly popular at the night clubs with his music. Things changes, when he meets an ambitious music producer (Curtis Armstrong). Who knows Ray got what it takes to be an strong performer and he also meets an woman (Kerry Washington), he loves as well & marries along the way. Ray's album becomes an hit, when he mixes soul music and gospel together. Which makes Ray an Controversial man during in the 1950's to the 1960's. Ray has love for all kind of music, including Country. But Ray isn't always the perfect man as he seems to be. Since he had plenty of failed relationship with other woman, while he's married. But he also had to battle with racism, people who double-crossed him, his music ideals and of course, his drug addiction. Which it made Ray's life extremely difficult for him and as well for battling the tragedy of his childhood. Which Ray always blamed himself for.Directed by Oscar-Winner:Taylor Hackford (Against All Odds, Devil's Advocate, Dolores Claiborne) made an fascinating true-life story of the always interesting of the late 'Ray Charles'. Foxx won an Oscar for his touching performance of the late entertainer. Foxx brings heart and soul in the film and humour as well. But this film has plenty of rich performances by an top cast including:Regina King, Clifton Powell, Bokeem Woodbine, Aunjaune Ellis, Warwick Davis, Terrence Howard and Sharon Warren as Ray's mother. This is probably THE best film of Hackford's career to date. The film has plenty of song of Charles's best music as well.DVD has an sharp Pan & Scan (1.33:1) transfer and an excellent Dolby Digital 5.1 Surround Sound. Disc 1 has an informative commentary by the director and the DVD also has the original theatrical cut and extended version as well. But u are better watching the theatrical version instead, because the bonus footage is in bad shape at times and u have to click on a logo if you want to see these Deleted Scenes. Disc 2 has deleted scenes with optional commentary by the director (Which is seen in the Extended Version), featurettes and more. But the featurettes are disappointingly short for this DVD. Since the movie is extraordinary good. This film was nominated four Oscars including Best Costume Designs, Best Director, Best Editing and Best Picture. This is an amazing true-life story well told but of course, Charles' life was even more controversial and outrageous than the final film. Still, it's pretty damn close. Screenplay by James L. White.

In New York City, Wall-E (Voiced by Ben Burtt) stands for 'Waste Allocation Load Litfer Earth-Class'. Wall-E is the only robot left working in New York City. This robot stays alive by taking robotic parts. Which Wall-E is been living for over 700 years. Which Wall-E cleans up New York City everyday by taking the trash. He has made his own place by finding junk, making things out of junk. He also watches old musicals and others things he enjoys doing. But he's lonely robot searching for a friend. He's not alone anymore, when an new robot called EVE (Voiced by Elissa Knight) is dropped in the Big Apple to search for any life. Wall-E tries to be friend with EVE but it doesn't quite work at first. Because their logic is different. When EVE found what she is looking for. Her ship picks her up but Wall-E unexpectedly goes for the ride. Wall-E finds himself in a new ship with different sizes of robotics and humans as well living in the deep outer space in a top class Space Ship.Written and Directed by Oscar-Winner:Andrew Stanton (A Bug's Life, Finding Nemo) made an entertaining, although sometimes quite strange Science Fiction adventure that is aimed at kids and adults. The young will certainly love the Wall-E character, because he's simply good hearted and simple. At times, he certainly reminded me of the Johnny Five character in 'Short Circuit'. What i find odd about 'Wall-E' is mixing live-action characters (Including old musicals classics and made up News Footage with the Fred Willard character) with CGI ones are certainly weird. That's the only aspect in 'Wall-E' doesn't quite work. Why having real human characters in the film but then later placing it with human CGI characters in the movie ? That's the only thing, i truly hated in the 'Wall-E' movie.Overall, 'Wall-E' is a good movie, it has many funny scenes and as well for visual moments. There's an enjoyable vocal performance by Jeff Garlin as the Ship's Captain. I meet some people, who seen 'Wall-E' an mixed experience or they find it... an truly dreadful experience. Fans of Science Fiction movies will enjoy this Ambitious film at best. Sigourney Weaver's voice appears throughout the second half of the feature as the Ship's Computer. Don't miss it.

Some critics are calling this 'The Godfather' of CIA Movies and they are probably right as well.DVD has an sharp anamorphic Widescreen (2.35:1) transfer and an good Dolby Digital 5.1 Surround Sound. DVD's only feature is the Deleted Scenes of the film, which they are just as interesting as the final cut of the movie. I would have loved to listen to a filmmaker's commentary or watching behind the scenes footage. But that's probably for a future DVD release. Since this picture is a fictional story but it is actually heavily based on fact. This is about a man, who's believes in the safety of his country, he's willing to scarified everything including his family and his own life to keep it safe.

Which Craven certainly knows his way with horror movies without making it too jokey. Then first-time screenwriter Kevin Williamson (Scream 2, The Faculty, I Know What You Did Last Summer) wrote an first-rate script. His characters are well-written, he writes some creative plot turns and there's humour throughout his script.

Harold 'Harry' Temple (Jeff Daniels) thought they will see the last of a mysterious mad bomber (Dennis Hopper). Who seemingly killed himself after being caught by Jack and Harry, when this mad bomber tried to kill full of people in a elevator shaft for ransom. Now Jack finds himself on the clock, when this terrorist calls him to tell him to try to catch the next transporting bus in the city of Los Angeles. Which he wants a big sum of money by only in a couple of hours. If this Bus goes down 50 MPH, the Bus will exploded. Now Jack finally caught on the bus by telling the passengers that their lives is also in danger. When one of the passengers accidentally shots the bus driver from panicking, one of the passengers named Annie (Sandra Bullock) takes over the bus. Which Jack has to do his best to keep the passengers claim until the SWAT Team tries to find out, who is this crazed terrorist before it's too late. Which this bad guy is actually quite clever. Now it is a race against time to find this bomber before they run out of gas on this bus before they get blown away.Directed by Jan de Bont (Lara Croft's Tomb Raider:The Cradle of Life, The Haunting '1999', Twister) made an enjoyable action-thriller with plenty of thrills, laughs, suspense and genuinely good character developments. Reeves plays his action hero extremely well. Bullock is charming in her supporting role that made her an movie star. Of course, Hopper has a great time playing this terrific bad-guy. This film was one of the biggest surprises in the summer of 1994 and it also got great reviews by the critics as well. Like any other action-pictures it has its share of flaws (Especially if you could see some the obvious continuity errors or revealing mistakes on the technical side of the movie). But this film is so much entertaining and fast-paced, that you might not think of it as first. After the success of 'Speed', then three years later 'Speed 2:Cruise Control' was produced. The sequel was one of the biggest box office disappointments in the U.S. and Reeves was wise enough to not reprise his role in that silly sequel. Which some fans of the original pretend that the sequel never existed. But still, 'Speed' is a very good action movie and it is still better than some of the recent action-films out there. Alan Ruck is a hoot as the dull-witted passenger and Glenn Plummer is amusing as the Juguar Owner. Look close for Richard Schiff (From 'The West Wing' fame) as the Train Driver. Written by Graham Yost (Broken Arrow, Hard Rain, Mission to Mars). Joss Whedon (Alien Resurrection, Serenity, Toy Story), who re-wrote much of the script is uncredited.

Which it's supports the regulation of the United States and the whole entire world. McClane decides to stop these criminals with the help of Farrell.Directed by Len Wiseman (Underworld, Underworld:Evolution) made an extremely entertaining action/thriller of the popular 'Die Hard' series. It's been twelve years since the last 'Die Hard' film. Willis is in top-form as the middle aged hero. Long is also good as the unwilling victim, who helps McClane along the way. Fans of the the 'Die Hard' movies might be disappointed with the lack of blood or language in this new film. Since it was originally R Rated until they re-edited for PG-13 for commercial reasons. Timothy Olyphant and Maggie Q plays terrific villains in this one. Mary Elizabeth Winstead plays McClane's daughter's reasonably well. Actor/Filmmaker/Screenwriter:Kevin Smith appears in a memorable bit part as 'The Warlock'.This fourth film has plenty of action but it's the creative stunt work that highlights this picture. This is certainly one of the biggest hits of 2007. This is the first film since Bruce Willis broke the $100 Million Dollar Mark since 'The Sixth Sense'. Willis is simply fun to watch as the original Old-School action hero's of the 1980's. Don't miss it. Screenplay by Mark Bomback (Godsent, The Tourist).

He wants to help his fellow survivors but it's a tough thing to make them believe a crazy story like this.Directed by James Wong (Final Destination 3, The One) made an intriguing horror/fantasy/thriller that has an amusing dark sense of humour and a game cast. Wong certainly has plenty of moments of style and suspense. Wong and Co-Screenwriter of the film:Glen Morgan (Black Christmas '2006' and Willard '2003') certainly learned a lot from their days of writing television episodes like 'Space:Above and Beyond', '21 Jump Street' and 'The X-Files'. Originally this film started as a TV script from Jeffery Reddick (Day of the Dead '2008', Final Destination 2 and Tarama). Which Reddick wrote it for a 'The X-Files' episode at first. But the producers felt this could have been a terrific film.DVD has an sharp anamorphic Widescreen (1.85:1) transfer and an good Dolby Digital 5.1 Surround Sound.

Commentary three is by the late talented music composer:Shirley Walker (Batman:Mask of the Phantasm, Escape from L.A., Memoirs of an Invisible Man). DVD also includes Deleted Scenes, Alternate Ending, Two great featurettes and more. Two/Thirds of the movie is certainly an very good movie. But then towards the last act of the movie turns extremely heavy-handed. I also felt towards the end, it starts making fun of their own rules as well. To be honest, i liked the 'Final Destination' sequels better than the original. It also takes Reddick's clever premise much less seriously as it should and the sequels are slightly more entertaining. But what's i think. Still 'Final Destination' is one of the better horror movies of the early 2000's. It's certainly worth seeing. (*** ½/*****).",8,0,2,11 November 2007

Since Woo knows how to create memorable action sequences in his movies. The performances are good, especially Beach makes this flawed picture worth seeing. The supporting cast are also great in their roles. Cage's character is difficult to enjoy at first but he becomes more human as the picture moves. This is the review for the Director's Cut, which Woo added about 18 minutes of additional footage.

DVD also includes trailers as well.'Windtalkers' was one of the biggest flops of 2002. Film critics and audiences were very mixed with the results. Most critics and viewers were expecting an Masterpiece. The biggest problem with the movie is the script by Joe Rice and Joe Batleer. Which both screenwriters wrote 'Blown Away' and 'Chasers' together. Their script is often corny at times and sometimes questionable during the characters' motivations. But their written characters are human enough and there's an few touching moments in the movie. This was John Woo's first director's cut. It was probably a good thing to add scenes in this new version. Which he explains why in the commentary track was it was necessary to be added in the Director's Cut. I liked this new version better than the original theatrical cut. It seems more completed as well. It's still not the masterpiece, we were hoping for but overall 'Windtalkers' is a movie i liked very much.

He discovers that the virus outside and 'The Island' are only a myth. He finds out that the residents are used for body parts or otherwise and they are going to get killed. He takes Jordan Two Delta (Scarlett Johansson) with him to escape to the compound. He and Jordan Two Delta discovers, there is life outside the compound. Dr. Merrick (Sean Bean) hires an mercenary Albert Laurent (Djimon Hounsou) to kill or capture the two escapees. But Lincoln Six Echo and Jordan Two Delta finds out that they are worth millions and they are not supposed to exist as human begins.Directed by Michael Bay (Bad Boys 1 & 2, Armageddon, Pearl Harbor) made an entertaining, action-packed thriller with science-fiction elements and an sense of humour set in the not too distant future. McGregor is solid as the lead action hero. Johansson does well in the well, although she doesn't quite to be believable as a action hero. Bean and Hounsou are strong in their supporting roles. 'The Island' was an major box office disappointment in the U.S. but did well on overseas box office. This was Bay's first box office flop, although 'The Island' was an major success on DVD.The Canadian DVD has an sharp anamorphic Widescreen (2.35:1) transfer and an strong Dolby Surround 2.0 Sound. Although Dolby Surround is great but I would have loved it to be in Dolby Digital 5.1 Surround Sound or in DTS 5.1 Surround Sound. Oddly enough, the Canadian DVD has an Dolby Digital 5.1 track in French! DVD also includes an decent running commentary track by the director and an behind the scenes featurette. For me, This is Bay's second best movie. My favorite for his work is 'The Rock', i felt he never topped his second movie as a filmmaker. The only flaw, i see in 'The Island', some of the highly imaginative action-sequences are way too over the top. But the look of the look is great with strong production designs and terrific special effects. But it is McGregor's strong performance keeps the movie together. Ethan Phillips is a hoot as one Lincoln Six Echo's friends. It is nice to see Steve Buscemi in a fun supporting role. Despite some flaws, 'The Island' as entertaining, it is very good. Panavision.

Talladega Nights: The Ballad of Ricky Bobby," An Sharp, Dumb Comedy about one man's ambitions about life in the fast lane and need for speed at the NASCAR races.
","Ricky Bobby (Will Farrell) is one of the best new drivers in NASCAR history. Ricky is a big, hairy American winning machine will do anything to win on the race track with the help of his best friend Cal Naughton, Jr. (John C. Reilly). Ricky has everything he needs, an sexy wife (Leslie Bibb), an dedicated assistant (Amy Adams), an large mansion, an great team and two bratty kids (Houston Tumlin & Grayson Russell). But everything is going to change, when an new ambitious flamboyant Euro formula one driver Jean Girard (Sacha Baron Cohen) joins the NASCAR racers to beat Ricky Bobby. While Girard is probably too good for Bobby. While Bobby loses one of the races, while trying to beat Girard. Bobby has an big accident on the race and now Bobby is too frighten to go back on the NASCAR races. While his wife turned her back on Bobby and plans to marry Cal instead. Now Bobby is stuck raising his two sons and he moves back to his mother's (Jane Lynch) place to start all over. Now Bobby is having an lifeless career as a pizza deliver man and having trouble to face his demons. But Bobby's long estranged father (Gary Cole) tries to help his son get back on his feet and trying to beat Girard once & for all at the next NASCAR race.Directed by Adam McKay (Anchorman:The Legend of Roy Burgundy, Step Brothers) made an extremely dumb comedy with plenty of laughs with some heart as well. Farrell and Cohen have some great laughs, when they are on-screen together. This movie has an solid supporting cast as well with only an few underwritten roles, especially the role of Adams. Which her character could have been much bigger as well. This was one of the biggest comedies hits of 2006. Farrell, who also co-wrote the script with the director has some genuine laughs with this outrageous comedy.DVD has an sharp anamorphic Widescreen (2.35:1) transfer and an strong-Dolby Digital 5.1 Surround Sound. The DVD is the Unrated Edition with 13 minutes of additional footage. Although there's some footage mission from the theatrical version, which it created some controversial for the DVD release. The director re-edited this movie for the Unrated Cut. DVD also includes an mockumentary-styled commentary from the director and guests, deleted/extended scenes, outtakes and more. This film turned out to be success with the film critics as well. But personally, i prefer the previous teaming of Farrell and McKay's 'Anchorman'. I thought that film was an funnier and crazier movie than this one. But still 'Talladega Nights' is a good comedy with some laugh-out moments. It has some special surprise cameos as well. McKay's next film with Farrell and Reilly in 'Step Brothers' should be promisingly. Meanwhile enjoy this goofy comedy. Super 35. (*** ½/*****).",8,0,1,8 September 2007
Semi-Pro," Entertaining but not the instead Classic Comedy... we would expect from Farrell.
","Jackie Moon (Will Farrell) is the owner of a basketball team in Flint, Michigan. His team are called ' The Flint Tropics'. He brought the team after his one hit disco song 'Love Me Sexy'. But his team aren't that good, in fact... they are awful. Expect for one player (Andre Benjamin), who has raw talent for the game. Jackie is also the coach as well, which he isn't very good at it as well. Although Jackie is great as a Promoter. Jackie has a chance for his team to play for the real NBA. He decides to trade the team's washing machine to get a seasoned but fading player (Woody Harrelson). Since this pro basketball player knows the game better than Jackie. He decides to help them get into shape and have their chance in the big time.Directed by Kent Alterman made an amusing, jokey, retro-70's comedy. Some of the cast members seems to be having an great time. This movie does really tries to be profane as 'Slap Shot' but not as memorable or hilarious from that 1970's classic. Also it is nowhere near as good like 'Anchorman' or 'Step Brothers', which are two of Farrell's best films for example. All the cast members have their moments, especially Andrew Daly and Will Arnett as Sports Commentors. Die Hard fans of Farrell will find a lot to enjoy this silly comedy. Also available in a two-disc unrated edition. Super 35. (*** 1/2 out of *****).",8,0,0,11 February 2009
