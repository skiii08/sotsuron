Ford v Ferrari," Damon and Bale really make the movie.
","Not every time you put two actors together and they'll click. But Matt Damon and Christian Bale surprisingly clicked on camera, to the point you'll forget there actors.Takes place in the 1960's, in the world of racing, a former race car driving(Matt Damon) and a british race car driver(Christian Bale) join forces to make history in the world of racing, by making a fast car for Ford auto. Hoping to keep big business from getting in the way.
An enjoyable racing film, also has a great 1960's setting. Racing scenes are also well shot, makes you feel you are in car. But it's Matt Damon and Christian Bales performances that really makes the movie, having Butch and Sundance like chemistry. Josh Lucas is also good.",10,3,5,19 December 2019
Moneyball," Pitt and Hill really make this film.
","Billy Beane(Brad Pitt), manager of the baseball team the Oakland A's, is growing very frustrated, that he get a winning season, his team is the lowest of the low. He tries to figure out what is he doing wrong. Then he meets Peter(Jonah Hill), a college graduate, with a high I.Q., who tells him his approach to the game is all wrong, so Billy hires Peter, decides to takes Peters advice, and go with the new approach, but will it work? Brad Pitt give an Oscar worthy performance, you really feel his frustration. Jonah Hill is good too, nice to see him do something different. He and Pitt have good scenes together. Philip Seymour Hoffman is also good as the coach. The guys playing the baseball players are too. I hope this movie won't be missed by the Oscars.",10,1,3,30 September 2011
The Avengers," Ultimate SuperHero Film
","It took Iron Man, Iron Man 2, The Incredible Hulk, Thor, and Captain America to build up to this, and was it worth the wait, Yes in deed.Nick Fury(Samual L. Jackson) brings together Captain America(Chris Evans), Iron Man(Robert Doney Jr), Thor(Chris Hemsworth), Bruce Banner/The Incredible Hulk(Mark Rufalo), Black Widow(Scarlett Johansson) and Hawkeye(Jeremy Renner) in hopes of stopping Loki(Tom Hiddleston) from world domination.It was worth it all the way through. Samual L. Jackson this time is front and center, and really shines in the role of Nick Fury. So does everybody else, Mark Rufalo really brings his own to Bruce Banner, although I do miss Edward Norton in the role, Rufalo does quite well. And Tom Hiddleston is quite menacing as Loki, more so then he was in Thor(2011), he was the best villain, almost tops The Joker. The rest of the cast are pretty good also. The Effects are great, the battle scenes are epic. This is a Marvel film that should not be missed.",10,7,15,7 May 2012
Blade Runner 2049," Everything you would want in a Blade Runner sequel.
","Blade Runner(1982) was a groundbreaking masterpiece, I have no doubt it inspired such films like Ghost in the Shell(1995), and I Robot(2004), to name a few, but was a sequel really needed here, the way the film ended it never felt left open for a sequel, and being Harrison Fords least favorite film, so this sequel hold up? I believe it does, never tries to be a rekindle of the original, there are a few throws back but this stands on it's own. Ryan Gosling plays his has Blade Runner named K, a very emotion less performance, but when he does explodes with anger he'll make you jump, you see he's a tormented character, and Gosling plays it too perfection. Jared Leto is also good has the creator of the new replicants, not in it much, but when he is, he just grabs you in the audience. I also liked Harrison Fords return has Decker, and yes there is a twist involving his character. The film is quite a dark vision of the future, just like the first film, but shown more here. If you like the original, then you'll give this film a look.",10,3,15,8 October 2017
Million Dollar Arm," My favorite Jon Hamm movie so far.
","Sports agent J.B. Bernstein(Jon Hamm) is on the end of failure, when a deal with a client goes sour. But finds a way to save face, while the Indian sport Cricket. Discovers he can get a couple of good Cricket players with good throwing arms to America to play baseball, when he finds two Indian young men with the talent, he takes them to America, but will they succeed is the question? A great sports movie, that pulls out all the stops, it has heart, humor, everything. The baseball scenes are awesome, the India and America setting where great. And everybody gives a good performance including the two Indian young men as the ball players. But it's Jon Hamm performance that makes this watchable.",10,2,4,23 May 2014
First Man," Giant step for mankind
","After The Right Stuff(1983) and Apollo 13(1995), now there is a movie about Neil Armstrong the first man to set foot on the moon, and it does not feel like a movie, I mean the way it's filmed feels less like a movie and more like it's in real time, and during the training scenes, the filmmakers make the audience feel your in it tooRyan Gosling gives a very Oscar worthy performance as Neil Armstrong, really displaying the stress of it all getting too him, becoming very determined to succeed, but becoming distant from his family and friends. Claire Foy is also great has Neil's wife, showing strength and how her patience starts to run low a bit. Jason Clarke is also good.",10,9,18,29 October 2018
The Hunger Games: Mockingjay - Part 1," Keeps getting better has it goes on.
","Takes place after the last one, Katniss(Jennifer Lawrence) awakes in District 13 an underground where the rebels live. Katniss is troubled that Peeta(Josh Hutcherson) is captured and is being brainwashed by the evil President Snow(Donald Sutherland). Katniss is chosen to lead the rebellion by President Alma Coin(Julianne Moore). But will Katniss be the hero they need? Great performances by everybody, I mean nobody stands when it comes to acting, also the futuristic scenery that looks realistic. It ends with you wanting more, cause there will be a part 2 next year. The series gets better has it goes through each movie. Jennifer Lawrence is such a great actress, and really embodies the role of Katniss. Makes me excited for Mockingjay part 2.",10,23,61,28 November 2014
Pirates of the Caribbean: On Stranger Tides," There is no Pirate movie without Captain Jack Sparrow.
","Captain Jack Sparrow(Johnny Depp) escapes from the law, and finds that someone has been impersonating him, turns out it was a lady from his past(Penelope Cruz), she is trying to put a crew together, and she is also the daughter of Blackbeard(Ian McShane), and Jack Sparrow comes along unwittingly to help them find the fountain of youth. With Barbossa(Geoffrey Rush) and his crew on there trail, Will they ever find the fountain of youth? I liked this one, Johnny Depp is always quite the scene stealer as Jack Sparrow, without him this would have been a nothing of a movie. Penelope Cruz is pretty good also, like a female version of Jack. Ian Mcshane is memorable as BlackBeard, Geoffrey Rush is also good too. The special effects are pretty good. It's not as good has the first one, but it nearly comes close.",8,1,2,30 May 2011
Men in Black 3," 3rd time was fun.
","An old enemy that Agent K(Tommy Lee Jones), put away years ago, is an alien named Boris the Animal(Jemaine Clement) escapes. The next day Agent J(Will Smith) goes to work at the Men In Black office, But K is not there, and when he asks, nobody knows who K is. Only to find out, that K was killed in 1969, that old enemy has traveled back in time to killed K. So J must travel back in time and save K, and put things back to the way they where, but will he? I had fun, like I did with all the Men In Black films,regardless what some critics say. They never take themselves seriously, and that is alway what I like about these movies. Will Smith is back and still got it, after three year vacation. Tommy Lee Jones is still good. So is Josh Brolin has young K, he was good, I started to think he was Tommy Lee Jones, and the camera De-aged him. And the effects don't disappoint either. And the look of the 60's are also good.",8,1,4,27 May 2012
Sherlock Holmes: A Game of Shadows," Never cease to entertain.
","Sherlock Holmes(Robert Downey Jr), and Dr. Watson(Jude Law) are trying uncover a plot by Professor Moriarty(Jared Harris). But Moriarty is just as smart as Holmes. They both really try to out think each other, which becomes a mind game of cat and mouse, where one proves to be about has clever as the other. Will Holmes and Watson be able too outwit Moriarty before it's too late? Guy Ritchie does it again, with it's adventure, humor, and intriguingness. It became a fun ride for everybody. Robert Downey Jr is good as Holmes, I think he had him down little better this time then he did in the first, he seems more relaxed. Jude Law is also good as Watson, he and Downey play off each other perfectly.",9,1,2,30 December 2011
The Incredible Hulk," Quite enjoyable and INCREDIBLE
","I always have been an Incredible Hulk fan as long as I could remember. I love the T.V. show with Bill Bixby and Lou Ferrigno, which ran for 5 and a half years. But I was disappointed with Ang Lee's The Hulk(2003), that failed to do the character any justice, and not mention Eric Bana, don't get me wrong is a good actor, But his performance as Bruce Banner was over the top and unwatchable, and it made me miss Bill Bixby in the role. The Special effects where the only thing good about it. Now it's 5 years later, a new hulk film is here, and Edward Nortan has taken over the role as Bruce Banner. Still on the run from General Ross(William Hurt), Bruce keeps trying to find a cure for his violent transformation , While Ross's military unit is on his trail, He finds refuge with his long lost love Betty Ross(Liv Tyler). And that is all I'm gonna tell you. But this film was Incredible, the action where great, not to mention the effects where awesome. And everybody gave great performances, Including Edward Norton who was more memorable then Eric Bana was, He played it very real, like Bill Bixby did in the T.V. Show. The Incredible Hulk makes up for The Hulk(2003).",10,5,8,15 June 2008
The Monuments Men," Could have been better
","Nearing the end of World War 2, a group of soldiers are on a mission to go in enemy territory and retrieve stolen art that the Nazis have stolen.The 1940's setting is not bad, and the look of World War 2 also looks very real. But George Clooney has director with everything else pretty much falls short. Although George Clooney and Cate Blanchett are pretty good. But Matt Damon performance does not do much here. And Bill Murray half the film looks like he's recovering from a hangover, John Goodman is alright, but that's it. There is no real exciting building up to anything. For the most part it feels less a film and more like a friendly get together. Trying to be The Guns of Navarone(1961) or The Dirty Dozen(1967) but it just does not quite get there, even though it is based on a true story.",5,3,6,12 February 2014
Captain Phillips," Tom Hanks will nearly bring to tears
","Based on the true story, in March 2009, Captain Philips(Tom Hanks) who is running an oil tanker. Which starts out as a simply run, soon becomes a nightmare when African pirates with machine guns take over the ship. Philips has the crew hide, while he tries to talk to the pirates. How will it all end for Captain Philips?Paul Greengrass direction was brilliant, the movie is very suspenseful, it has you on the edge of your seat, on how it's going to end. Now it does slow down in spots, but it does keep your interest. Tom Hanks performance is Oscar worthy, he makes you such an emotional depth. The setting is perfect, you'll feel like you are being taken hostage with him.",9,24,40,14 October 2013
Sucker Punch," Just a guilty pleasure, nothing more.
","Sucker Punch is One Flew Over The Cukoos Nest, Inception, and lots of video game like elements all rolled up in one. This movie is getting a lot of negative reviews. In my opinion Sucker Punch is no way near the masterpieces that Watchmen and Inception were. But still not a bad movie.The story starts with Babydoll(Emily Browning) is sent to a Mental hospital cause of a tragic event that happened in her life, during that time she befriends Sweet Pea(Abbie Cornish), Rocket(Jena Malone), Amber(Jamie Chung),Blondie(Vanessa Hudgens). And Babydoll comes up with a plan to escape, and gets the others in on this. BabyDoll creates a fantasy world, where she is a super warrior, in hopes that it will help her and the others escape. But the question is will it? Zach Snyder is quite a visionary director, not as good has Watchmen and 300, but still an entertaining film. Browning, Cornish, Malone give descent performances, but Chung, and Hudgens are not that interesting, except when they are in the fantasy scenes when they are a female A-Team. Carla Gugino, and Oscar Issac are good in there roles too. I say don't be influenced by the negative reviews, see this movie and form your own opinion.",8,6,16,28 March 2011
10 Cloverfield Lane," Things are never what they seem
","Michelle(Mary Elizabeth Winstead) is in a car wreck, and awakes to find herself in an underground shelter with a hurt leg, she then meets Howard(John Goodman) who claims to have saved her life, and is keeping her down there to protect her from what is up there, she meets Emmett(John Gallagher Jr), but has she tries to cope, she begins to discovers noting is what it seems.Is this a sequel to Cloverfield(2008), well yes and no. It's a film that really makes you feel unhinged, you feel trapped in the underground bunker with the characters. John Goodman gives quite a suspenseful performance, you don't know what you are gonna get from him, he really keeps you on the edge of your seat. I gained a great deal of respect for Mary Elizabeth Winstead has an actress, don't get me wrong I did like her before, but here she really gives her all as an actress. If you did not like Cloverfield, but I hope you'll give this film a look.",10,1,4,19 March 2016
The Finest Hours," If you liked The Perfect Storm, then give The Finest Hours a look.
","Takes place in the early 1950's where a giant storm dominates the seas by breaking a tanker truck in half, with only a few hours left to survive, the crew id does what they can survive. A rescue ship is sent to try and get to them, but the question is will they ? I love the early 50's look, it captures it so perfectly. Everybody gives a good performance, almost nobody stands out. The storms scenes are also well shot, you'll feel caught up in the storm also. It keeps you on the edge of your seat. It's easy to compare this to The Perfect storm(2000), it has the same feel to it. I hope you won't be disappointed by this.",10,64,104,31 January 2016
The Equalizer," If you liked The Book of Eli, then give The Equalizer a look.
","This film is based on a TV show from the 80's,from the same name, which I never saw. This was an entertaining action thriller, don't get me wrong it was a little flawed, but I still enjoyed. It feels like a cross between Man on Fire(2004), Taken(2008), and Jack Reacher(2012).Robert McCall(Denzel Washington) someone with a dark past, tries to live a simply life in Boston, he has a job managing Home Mart. He befriends a troubled teenager(Chole Grace Moretz) and discovers she is mixed in with some bad people, he uses his deadly set of skills to help her out. But only brings more bad people that will stop at nothing to bring him down. Will Robert get them before they get him? Denzel was awesome here, he was bad ass and ruthless, but I also like the way he does not play the character has one noted. Chole Grace Moretz is also good, the amount of minutes she's in it. The actors playing the bad guys are great, there cunning and menacing. The movie has you on the edge of your seat, believe me you won't be disappointed.",9,2,8,28 September 2014
The Expendables 2," Ready for a 2nd round.
","Sylvester Stallone and his band of mercenaries are back, for another entertainment take no prisoners action film this Stallone is not the director, just the co writer, Simon West(Con Air 1997) is directing.Barney(Sylvester Stallone) and his team are thwarted on there mission by Jean(Jean-Claude Vann Damme) a terrorist who has his own evil plan on world domination. Will Barney and his team stop him before it's too late? IIt was nice to Chuck Norris, Arnold Scwartzeneggar return to the big screen, and Bruce Willis joining in on the action also, they all have become parodies of themselves, they all play on that here. It had some great shootouts, and some great fight scenes. And some great humor from the cast, when they all really shine.",8,6,16,17 August 2012
War Dogs," I couldn't take much in.
","Is this film boring, well no. Although based on a true story, I've come to realize that most of what I saw here is half creative license, in movies based on true stories I've come expect that. I've felt the trailer was very misleading, making it appear to be an action buddy misadventure, when in fact it was none of that. I believe it was only loosely based on a real events.Jonah Hill and Miles Teller are both wonderful actors, and they both put in effort here. But neither one really click, I think the filmmakers where trying to give them a Newman and Redford like feel, but Hill and Teller don't have the right chemistry do give us that, It just didn't sell to me that they where best friends. The actress who plays Tellers girlfriend is okay, but just goes nowhere, and never really convinces me that Teller is truly in love with her. And when the film throws in humor, It gives off that it was trying too hard. Bradley Cooper is in it too, and does alright with his small role he plays. The film is not all bad, the scenery is pretty good, and the country scenes are effective.In the end the film did not do much for me.",5,1,2,14 September 2016
Source Code," Quantum Leap, Groundhog Day, Deja Vu, Inception, all rolled into one.
","Air Force helicopter pilot Colter Stevens(Jake Gyllenhaal) wakes up on a train, not knowing how he got there, he sees a beautiful woman named Christina(Michelle Monaghan), who talks too him like she knows him, but Colter doesn't remember meeting her. And she calls him a different name. In this sudden state of confusing, Colter goes to the bathroom, and looks in the mirror, sees a face that is not his. Within 8 minutes the train blows up. Colter wakes in a special pod, in a bigger state of confusing, a small screen in the pod comes on, an army lady named Colleen Goodwin(Vera Farmiga) tells Colter that he has to go back and find the bomber, before another attack happens, will Colter save the day? Almost as good has Duncan Jones last film Moon(2009). Such an entertaining sci-fi thriller, that holds your interest from beginning to end. Jake Gyllenhaal is good in his role, showing such emotion, not playing just another action hero type. Michelle Monaghan is good also, she and Gyllenhaal have great chemistry. Vera Farmiga and Jeffrey Wright are in there supporting roles too.",9,0,2,5 April 2011
Skyfall," James Bond does return
","Daniel Craigs third time playing James Bond OO7, In this straight laced action spy thriller, that never tries to be cartooning has some of the other ones. The action scenes are pretty memorable, nothing too over the top, but in a realistic way, it also has some great suspenseful scenes too. Judi Dench a M, has more too play on, then just being an angry boss.It's been fifty years since James Bonds first film appearance in Dr.No(1962), so this film does pay homage to other Bond films of the past, but a little more suttle than Die Another Day(2002) did. Ben Whishaw is memorable as Q. I will long to see who could be as good has Daniel Craig?",9,2,12,12 November 2012
The Hangover," One entertaining misadventure.
","The makers of this film copied the style of the Farrelly brothers, you know the guys that brought you Dumb and Dumber(1994),Kingpin(1996),and There's something about Mary(1998). And came up to being as good and entertaining.It begins with four friends Phil(Bradley Cooper), Alan(Zach Galifianakis), Stu(Ed Helms), and Doug(Justin Bartha). Decide to go to Las Vegas for a bachelor party, there friend Doug is getting married, so they wild night of celebrating, and swore this would be a night they would never forget. Well next day they realize that it really was a night that they did forget. Everything is messed up, they feel out of it. To make matters worse the groom to be Doug has gone missing. Murphys law ensues as they try to find there friend. Will they find him in time before the wedding? This was one funny raunchy,slapstick comedy. Everything was timed perfectly, I mean every joke and every gag. And there are no scene steelers, every character shines in a comedic way. A perfect adult comedy, it never once gets boring or stupid for a second.",8,5,10,7 June 2009

He throws himself in his work, putting strain on his relationship with Pepper Potts(Gwyenth Paltrow), then a new threat named The Manderin(Sir Ben Kingsley) a terrorist who is bent on domination.Okay there is a lot to this movie then what you saw in the trailer, you probably will be surprised or be very mad, that is up to you. But I enjoyed this, Robert Downey JR is still pretty good has the charming but flawed hero Tony Stark/Iron Man. So was Gwyenth Paltrow and Don Cheadle. Sir Ben Kingsley, Guy Pearce, and Rebecca Hall also shine in there roles. It also had great effects and great action. In this we learn it's not the suit that makes Tony a hero, but it's Tony himself that is a hero.",9,25,40,4 May 2013
Deepwater Horizon," Great film about the worst disaster
","The film recounts about the oil rig known has the Deepwater Horizon that exploded and caused quite a big disaster, and in hopes for the workers to make it out alive? I gotta say has far as a disaster in a film goes, this one looked very real, no Hollywood feel to it. You feel the disaster as it goes along, although it builds up to the disaster quite well. Mark Wahlberg, Kurt Russell and Gina Rodriguez all give solid performances, even Kate Hudson on what she was giving, so does John Malkovich. Kurt Russell is Kate Hudsons step dad, and they share only one scene together. I was on the edge of my seat and wondering on how it was gonna end. It's the best thing this year next to Sully.",10,0,4,13 October 2016
Resident Evil: Afterlife," a standard uninteresting film
","I've never played the video games, and the films I was a little entertained, except part 2 Mila Jovavich is amusing as Alice, so was Ali Larter as Claire. But the rest of the characters are just so uninteresting, we have seen these types of people before in other types of horror flicks. It does have one or two scares, and the effects and action are what keep this film above ground. But there are characters who are never explained too well, they throw them in, they figure that fans of the game don't need an explanation, but what about people who never played the game.Only good for the effects and action, other than that it's a standard uninteresting zombie film.",5,10,24,13 September 2010
Stop-Loss," A well thought out, powerful, and moving film.
","This film I hope will sweep away the Oscars in 2009, because it was a great believable film, and it had great believable performances by Ryan Phillippe, Abbie Cornish, Channing Tatum, and Joseph Gordon Levitt. It begins with soldiers from Iraq who are coming home, But for three good friends, Brandon(Ryan Phillippe), Steve(Channing Tatum), and Tommy(Joesph Gordon Levitt) all in there own way, are emotionally destroyed from the war. Brandon discovers that he is reported to return back to Irag because of the Stop Loss policy. But Brandon refuses, cause he does not want to do anymore killing, or get anymore soldiers killed. He soon goes on the run with Steve's girlfriend Michelle(Abbie Cornish), but is this a fight Brandon can win, will he go back to Iraq, or go to jail? It was well directed by Kimberly Pierce who also directed the masterpiece Boy's Don't Cry(1999). This movie shows us a frightening reality of a never ending war, and the men and women who suffer for it. Abbie Cornish who was last seen in A Good Year(2006), and Elizabeth:The Golden Years(2007), really does well here, I hope she will have a long career ahead her. This film is a true masterpiece.",10,3,8,6 April 2008
Deja Vu," This movie is a trip worth remembering
","Tony Scott really knows how to deliver a good thriller, this movie really pin you to your seat, Filmed in New Orleans post Katrina days, that gives the film a gritty realness to it. It starts with sailors and people getting on a boat, that soon explodes. Millions of people are killed. ATF Agent Doug Carlin(Well acted by Denzel Washington) begins to investigate, he soon comes a womens body, the womens name is Clare(The beautiful Paula Patton), at first he thinks she is a victim of the explosion, but has he digs deep, he discovers that she was killed two hours before the explosion, but he knows it is all connected. When he searches her apartment, he has the feeling of Deja Vu. Soon after an agent(Val Kilmer) brings on an experiment that he and his crew have equipment that can look four days in th past. That is all I'm gonna tell you, I'd rather not give nothing away. But I'll tell you this movie had great tension and great excitement. It's perfectly well directed by Tony Scott, and wonderfully acted by Denzel Washington.",10,1,3,30 November 2006
It," Bill Skarsgard is Pennywise
","Nothing against Tim Curry who played Pennywise in the 1990 mini series, who gave a silly/creepy performance, but Bill Skarsgards performance has Pennywise the evil entity clown is really beyond terrifying, when he's in make up and wardrobe, Bill Skarsgard is gone and Pennywise is here.Set in the late 1980's has a bunch of 13 year old kids known has the The Loser Club discover that an evil entity known has Pennywise is haunting and trying to kill them, and gets into there heads, using there fears against them. The kids must band together in order to defeat him, but will they? Not only Bill Skarsgard scary performance is what makes the film, but the performance of the young cast, all really click you buy there friendship, things they deal with, is what most kids have to deal with. I can tell the Netflix series Stranger Things was somewhat inspired off the novel. But it's very scary, will make you jump a lot. Makes me excited for next film. If you get easily disturbed then you should avoid this.",10,7,17,10 September 2017

","John Wick(Keanu Reeves) a former hit man, who was considered the best. Is attacked in his home by thieves, they injure him, kill his dog, but there biggest mistake is that they did not kill, now John Wick will stop at nothing until they all are hunted down.I liked Keanu Reeves here, he was quite the bad ass, like Payback(1998) you'll be rooting for the bad guy, but unlike Payback, John Wick had some layers to him. There are some great fight and shoot out scenes. Also great supporting cast like Willem Dafoe. Also I felt it just wasn't just a simply revenge film, it also shows the darkness within a man's soul.",9,31,67,26 October 2014

This movie was quite an experience, it makes you feel like you're in space with Clooney and Bullock, at times it is intriguing at time disorientating. Performances are top notch, Clooney keeps the humorous moments at bay for the most part, and Bullock gives a very realistic performance that is Oscar worthy. If you think you've seen it all, then you have not seen Gravity.",10,2,4,16 October 2013
Star Trek," Going back to it's roots.

This film had great effects and great performances as well, each actor does not try to do a cheap imitation of the original characters, they all bring there own to it. I was really amazed how much Zachary Quinto really looked liked Leonard Nimoy in Vulcan makeup. Eric Bana is also in a great performance as Nero. This movie is just you'd like in a Star Trek movie.",9,3,12,11 May 2009

The characters never come off as two likable at times, but it says what war can do to some people. Brad Pitt is great, he has the look in his eyes like he could snap any minute. The performances of Shia LaBeouf, Logan Lerman, and Michael Pena also don't disappoint either. It also has a great setting.",10,3,13,5 November 2014
The Maze Runner," Well made sci-fi mystery
","I have not read the books, but I saw the movie, and it had me glued. It is trying to live to The Hunger Games. It is meant for the teens, but I'm not a teen, but I still liked it. If anybody likes an sci-fi like journey of wonder, then The Maze Runner is that movie for you.The set is awesome looking, looks mostly like a recycled set from the old Planet of the Apes films, but still awesome looking. The young actors really perform there roles really well, and not just playing there roles has annoyingly one noted. There are some action scenes, and good suspenseful moments. I also like the way the story slowly unfolds before your very eyes. The twists you just won't see coming. Also the effects are also good.",9,5,10,29 September 2014

But another story comes into play with Shosanna(Melanie Laurent) a Jew disguised as a french, who escaped the Nazis years earlier, in which her family was slaughtered by the Nazis. Who now runs a movie theater, and is ploting her own revenge.Now Pulp Fiction(1994), and Kill Bill vol 1 and 2(2003-2004) are what I considered to be masterpieces. But Inglourious Basterds is not in that category, it wasn't bad, but it wasn't great either. Most of the character don't really grab any interest, Tarantino does not across with interesting dialog with any of the characters, except in the beginning, but it goes away after that. And Eli Roth is clearly no actor, he just doesn't do much. And Brad Pitt wears himself out fast. Now it did have some good shoot out scenes. And it also had a great setting. But after it got to be boring, where one scene, i nearly dosed off. But I did like Melanie Laurent, who becomes the only interest through out the whole film. Not Tarantinos best work, but not his worst, but it could have been better.",7,3,7,28 August 2009
Rogue One: A Star Wars Story," Please don't hate me,but I liked it more then The Force Awakens
","Don't get me wrong I was very entertained by The Force Awakens and all the rest of the Star Wars films, yeah including The Phantom Menace, which I did not think was terrible has others has said, despite the flaws it was still entertaining. A bunch of young rebels discover that the planet killer known has The Death Star has a weakness, and the rebels must get the information back to the alliance before it's too late.I was really entertained by Rogue One, It does take place in the star wars universe, but at the same time it does stands on it's own, and avoids being clichéd, like most star wars movies would be. Felicity Jones is awesome, I mean she is quite the bad ass here. Donnie Yen is also very memorable, has a blind fighter who fancies himself as a Jedi Knight. And Alan Tudyk has voice of the robot K-2SO, who is quite the scene steal er. All the other characters are also good. Some CGI effects are pretty descent. Darth Vader is in this, not much, but you feel his presence when he is. I hope Star Wars fans will find this quite amusing.",10,5,11,19 December 2016
Captain Marvel," R.I.P Stan Lee
","Marvel logo at the begin, shows all of Stan Lee cameos, a great way to pay a loving tribute to the man who made Marvel comics popular to this day. You are forever legend Stan Lee 1922-2018.
Brie Larson is incredible has the main character, she really comes alive, never appears to bored once. I love the mid 90's setting, considering it is set before any of the marvel movies. Samuel L. Jackson really steals some of the movie has a young Nick Fury. I like the idea it's different from other Marvel movies, really stands alone, the film has twists some critics won't see coming. Effects that would make Star Wars fan proud.
I'm really looking forward to what is in store for Marvel movies in the future.",10,16,34,11 March 2019
This Is the End," Actors playing crazy versions of themselves, what more can you ask for.
","While during a crazy night at a Hollywood party, a disaster is happening. And some random people are vanishing at random. A bunch of actor are held up inside a house, hoping not to get hurt or get on each others nerve, and the question is, will they make it through? I'm gonna say this if you are easily offended, you should not see this, but if you are gonna go into this film expecting to laugh, then you should see this. Acttors playing themselves seem to be having fun. It feels more like a friendly get together. Unlike That's My Boy(2012), and Movie 43(2013), this is raunchy humor done right. So don't expect anything more or less.",8,3,12,18 June 2013
Iron Man 2," Almost as good has the first one.
","Iron Man 2 was entertaining, but didn't feel as driven like the first one. Robert Downey Jr is good has Tony Stark/Iron Man, it just reminds me, he is playing himself.It takes place 6 months after the events from the first Iron Man, and now Tony Stark/Iron Man(Robert Downey Jr) is a superhero living the rock star life. But soon Tony starts having complications with the suit. To make matters worse an evil inventor from Russia named Ivan(Mickey Rourke) manages to copy Tonys technology, and become Whiplash, and he teams up with Tonys rival Justin Hammer(Sam Rockwell) in hopes to beat Iron Man at his own game, will Tony defeat before it's too late? I like Robert Downey Jr, and the effects where incredible. I liked Gwenyth Paltrow, Scarlett Johannson, Mickey Rourke, Sam Rockwell and Samual L. Jackson. But Don Cheadle seemed out of place, who is replacing Terrance Howard. Nothing against Don Cheadle he was alright, but Terrance Howard made that role from the first one. Like I said it was entertaining, but not as driven.",8,0,1,21 May 2010
The Hunger Games," let the games begin.
","In the near future, where kids from each district are chosen for The Hunger, a televised event where they fight to the deaths. Kantiss(Jennifer Lawerence) steps in for her kid sister. And Peete(Josh Hutchinson) is also picked. They travel to the place where it's gonna take place, they train and get prepared, but the question is will they survive? A well made film, the futuristic look to the film is perfect. Jennifer Lawerence is perfectly well cast as Kantiss, she brings the character to life, it's hard to picture anybody else in the role after seeing her. Josh Hutchinson is good, so is Elizabeth Banks, Woody Harrleson, Alexander Ludwig, and Isabelle Furman. Although it slows down in spots, but still a good film.",9,2,7,9 April 2012
42," Well told story of a baseball legend
","Jackie Robinson(Chadwick Bosman)is recruited by Branch Rickey(Harrison Ford)to play Major League Baseball, this will make him the African American to do so. But Jackie is gonna have to play it cool when some bigots are looking to start something with him, let's remember this is the 1940's.A well told story of not just being a sports film, but a film about fighting impossible odds. We have a deep understanding of what Jackie Robinson went through to make it big, it's a prime example that getting to the top is not always an easy ride. I liked the way the filmmakers captured the 1940's. Chadwick Boseman was excellent has Jackie Robinson, showing all the emotions of him, I'm sure he spent a lot of time with his family. Harrison Ford is alright as Branch Rickey, some scenes he's great and other parts he's over the top. And the other supporting cast don't disappoint. A great film you don't want to miss.",10,0,1,16 April 2013
Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Man's Chest," Johnny Depp does it again
","He once again steals the show, and outshines everybody that is in a scene with him, in this movie. He portrayal as the humorous, sword fighting pirate known as captain Jack Sparrow, seems to make this movie always fun to watch. Orlando Bloom and Keira Knightingly are fine in their roles as Will Turner and Elizabeth Swann, but they keep getting out shined by Johnny Depps captain Jack Sparrow. The Effects are incredibly awesome. The story starts out Will and Elizabeth meet up with Captain Jack Sparrow again, on an adventure when Jack makes a deal with the phantom pirate known as Davey Jones(Bill Nighy from Underworld) to find his chest. Quite a fun movie to watch, like the first one was. I can't wait for part 3.",10,2,5,13 July 2006

While Iraninan soldiers are still hunting them, not knowing who they are,only knowing that they are six Americans. Back in the U.S. C.I.A. specialist Tony Mendez(Ben Affleck) comes with a solution to get them home safely, pretend to be a film crew, for a Star Wars ripp off titled Argo. But will this plan work?Ben Affleck acting and directing are both brilliant, he really works well with actors and it shows in there performances. Bryan Cranston, so was John Goodman and Alan Arkin. So where the actors playing the six Americans. It's a nerve racking suspenseful film, when the people on screen are nervous and scared, you feel it with them.",10,1,4,14 October 2012
Star Trek Into Darkness," Better than the first one
","Kirk(Chris Pine) and crew go after a mysterious terrorist named John Harrison(Benedict Cumberbatch) after he attacks Starfleet. They trail him to a forbidden place. But what gonna be discovered is what gonna surprise you the most.This was better than the first, in terms of effects, action, and effects. Chris Pine and Zachery Quinto give amazing performances, so does Zoe Saldana. But Benedict Cumberbatch steals the show. And it never misses the chance at the humorous scenes, which are pretty funny when they do come. Any sci fi adventure film will have some competition, because this one will be very hard to top.",10,4,14,22 May 2013
"Crazy, Stupid, Love"," A good blend of comedy and drama
","Cal(Steve Carell), a man in his mid 40's, who has the life most men would envy, he has a good marriage, and great relationship with his kids. But Cals good life quickly comes crashing down, when his wife Emily(Julianne Moore), asks for a divorce, cause she slept with a co-worker(Kevin Bacon). Emily is not proud of it, and feels it is like a mid life crisis, Cal quickly gives up and moves out, while at a bar, and drowning in his sorrows, he gets the attention of Jacob(Ryan Gosling) a real ladies man, who wants to help Cal, and help him get back in the dating game, but that quickly gets tested, when Jacob falls for Hannah(Emma Stone).The trailer was so misleading, it made you feel like you where gonna route for just Steve Carell, but when you finally watch you're unsure who to route for, Steve Carell or Juliane Moore. I think they worked beautifully well together, you really believe the feelings the have for one another. And Ryan Gosling is quite a scene stealer, he has funny chemistry with Carell, and Stone. This was an enjoyable comedy/drama.",9,5,9,3 August 2011
Public Enemies," Johnny Depp and Marion Cottilard pretty much make the film
","The story of John Dillinger, the infamous bank robber and his gang, trying to stay a step ahead of the law. And Melvin Purvis the FBI agent trying to stay ahead of him, in hopes of catching him. But how is this gonna play out, in this game of cat and mouse.Johnny Depp once again steals the movie, his cool style of acting seems to upstage the other actors, except for Marion Cottilard who plays Billie the woman Dillinger falls in love with, she gave quite a strong performance, and held her own with Depp. But Christian Bale as FBI agent Melvin Purvis, was annoyingly stiff in his role, and brings no interest. But the rest of the cast is alright, and there some action scenes also. And it was brilliantly directed by Michael Mann. If you loved The Untouchables(1987), then you'll love Public Enemies.",9,4,6,16 July 2009
The Other Boleyn Girl," Scarlett Johanson and Natalie Portman are Incredible.
","There both two of the greatest young actress's out there. And there performances in this period piece is Oscar worthy, if they don't get nominated next year at the Oscars for there performances, we'll shame on the Oscars then. The Story begins with the Boleyn sisters, Mary(Scarlett Johanson), and Anne(Natalie Portman) who are in the company of King Henry(Eric Bana also in a great performance). And then Anne begins to scheme, to get King Henry affections, no matter what it costs, or who it hurts, and the chain of events that will follow. This was a great film, well acted, and well crafted. Not to mention well directed by Justin Chadwick. The Best period piece so far this year.",9,4,11,14 March 2008
Us," If you love a good thriller, Us will really deliver.
","Jordan Peele who brought the entertaining Get Out(2017), now brings Us. The story of a family going on vacation, but things don't go has planned when some weird people dressed in red begin terrorize them, only to discover the people in red look amazingly like them.I really enjoyed this, every bit has good as Get Out(2017). Jordan Peele proves to be a good horror director, really delivers the thrills. The cast work very well together. I liked the way the film brings you to think you know where the movie is going, and then it totally throws you off guard. Although I would not want to sit through this again, one time was enough.",10,9,20,30 March 2019
Prince of Persia: The Sands of Time," pretty descent summer adventure flick.
","Most movies based off of video games, don't always do so well, the only two films based off of video games that were surprised hits, are Mortal Kombat(1995), and Resisdent Evil(2002).The movie is about Dastan(Jake Gyllenhaal) the adopted son of the king, and a cunning young warrior, who him and his crew successfully take down a whole army of Queen Tamina(Gemma Arterton) and overthrow her kingdom. But Dastan soon gets his hands on a dagger, but soon comes to discover it's no ordinary dagger, but trouble soon ensues when Dastan is framed for killing the king, and soon goes on the run with Tamina, not knowing who to trust, or trust each other.It was not great, but not bad either. The action scenes are incredibly good, really keeping you on the edge of your seat at times. Jake Gyllenhaal was alright as Dastan, one part he really seemed to be into his role, the other part it seemed to be winking at the camera. And he and Gemma Arterton have very little chemistry. Ben Kingsly and Alfred Molina are good in there supporting roles. It brings elements of what we loved about the game.",7,1,3,7 June 2010
Ted," Toy Story meets Family Guy
","The creator of Family Guy, Seth Macfarlane makes his first live action film debut, and boy it's was funny, makes us forget about that cinematic abomination that is That's My Boy.in 1985 an 8 year old boy named John, has no friends, on one Christmas, is giving a toy bear as a gift, then makes a wish, that he wishes that the toy bear would come alive, and they could be best friends, and his comes true, the toy bear comes alive, John names him Ted. 27 years later John(Mark Wahlberg) and Ted(motion capture voiced by Seth Macfarlane) are still together, and are pretty much slackers. John starts having a relationship with Lori(Milla Kunis), after four years, she tells John that Ted has to move out, so there relationship can improve. How will this end? This was funny, it spoofs everything from heartfelt too narrative moments. Mark Wahlberg was funny, so was the motion capture Ted, well voiced by Seth Macfarlane, and Milla Kunis was good too. So was everybody else in the movie, It's Toy Story with bite.",8,1,8,2 July 2012
Knives Out," A mystery that just keeps you glued.
","A billionaire author(Christopher Plummer) suddenly dies from an apparent suicide, and all his relatives come in hopes to hearing a reading of the will. But soon a brilliant detective(Daniel Craig) starts to see there is more to his death then what meets the eye.Writer/Director Rian Johnson really delivers an Agatha Christie like mystery, that keeps an interest with it's all star cast, Don Johnson, Jamie Lee Curtis, Toni Collette, Michael Shannon, and Chris Evans to name a few. My only real complaint is Daniel Craig, some scenes he's good, and other scenes he's annoyingly over the top, to the point I feel he was giving a parody like performance. But all in all still a good mystery, just when you think you know where it's headed and then it will really surprise you.",9,1,6,5 December 2019
The Irishman," Martin Scorsese delivers a masterpiece.
","The movie was a little long then it had to be, but still very well paced. The story takes place through certain decades. Almost makes you feel like your there. Performances are beyond greatness, I like the way it shows the gangsters are quite vulnerable.
Robert De Niro and Joe Pesci are great and Oscar worthy, but it's Al Pacino that really chews up the scenes has Jimmy Hoffa, I feel he becomes Hoffa when ever he's on screen. I don't how much did or didn't happen, but still a good gangster film, a little longer then it needed to be.",10,2,5,28 December 2019
Pirate Radio," A nice nostalgic look at the 60's.
","This is coming of age story mixed with DJ comedy, that is like Good Morning Vietnam(1987).It begins in 1966,where 18 year old Carl(Tom Sturrige), is sent to live with his uncle(Bill Nighy), who runs a radio station on a boat, called Pirate Radio. Where he learns to know what it's like to be famous, and infamous at the same time. With such coolness from the DJs (Phillip Seymour Hoffmann),(Nick Frost, Shaun of the Dead, Hott Fuzz). But soon Pirate Radio has to deal with a member of the British government(Kenneth Braghn) who is determined to shut them down at any costs, will Pirate Radio stay ahead of them? This movie had great music, and great performances by all the actors. It was also funny although some jokes did not like. But still an entertaining film.",9,2,5,23 November 2009
"I Love You, Man"," No beating around the bush, this was a great comedy.
","The makers of the film tried to follow in the style of director Judd Apatow, you know add in some raunchiness, but not too much of it, but at the same time make it heartwarming and relatable. Like The 40-Year Old Virgin(2005), and Knocked Up(2007) where.The story starts with Peter(Paul Rudd) who purposes to his longtime girlfriend Zooey(Rashida Jones), and she says yes. And should be smooth sailing from there right, well not so much. Peter quickly discovers that he has no best man for his wedding, the painful fact is that Peter has never really had a male friend, most of his best friends are females. So Peter goes out on a search by going on a couple of man dates, in hopes to find the perfect B.F.F.. But comes close to giving up, until he meets Sydney(Jason Segel), a wild fun loving guy. Peter and Sydney soon become the best of friends, has Sydney shows Peter on how to be wild and crazy. But will it put a strain on his relationship with Zooey? One funny comedy, that hits it's mark perfectly. And a great bunch of characters, that don't over do it either. Paul Rudd is great, always, he had better chemistry with Rashida Jones and Jason Segel, then he had with Elizabeth Banks and Seann William Scott. Rashida Jones is also great in her role, although she doesn't quite get the big laughs, she endearing and believable in her role. Jason Segel was perfectly cast also, he managed to get some good laughs. And rest of the supporting cast are memorable. Including Lou Ferrigno as himself.",10,50,86,25 March 2009
Creed," The legacy that lives on
","Adonis Johnson(Michael B. Jordan) who is the son of famed boxer Apollo Creed from a secret affair. Longs to be boxer like his dad, although he has never met his dad, but the fighters blood is inside him too. So Adonis tracks down Rocky Balboa(Sylvester Stallone) is hopes he will train him, Rocky is reluctant, but eventually agrees to. How will they both come of this? I like the way that the film is it's own thing, but there are parts it does homage to Rocky movies. Michael B. Jordan is great has Adonis, I believe his best performance since Fruitvale Station. Stallone is also great has Balboa, he plays the character now who is now past his prime, and at odds with his mortality, and he and Jordan play off each other perfectly. The boxing scenes are intense, feel has real. If you're a Rocky fan, then I'll bet you'll love Creed.",10,2,6,29 November 2015
X-Men Origins: Wolverine," Not as good as X2 and X3, but at least better then X1.
","I didn't like the first X-Men(2000), because when I look at it, it appears to be on such a low budget, the only reason it worked because of Hugh Jackman as Wolverine, his portrayal as the charming rebel pretty much made the picture. In 2003, X-Men 2 came out, and it suppressed more then what part 1 ever could, and in 2006 X-Men 3:The last Stand came out, it did alright but not quite as good has part 2 did. In all those it was Wolverine that pretty much made each film. Those films would have been nothing without him. I had a feeling it would be a matter of time, he would get his own movie.This is another prequel, it shows Wolverine life before he joined the X-Men. This movie had incredible action, and a great performances by Hugh Jackman and Liev Schreiber as Victor Creed. But this movie suffers from one serious flaw. It was too fast paced, like on speed dial. I felt we didn't get enough time to get know most of the characters, some just come and go pretty fast, some talents in this film are just so unused. But the awesome action makes up for it.Will there be a sequel? Only time will tell. But I'll tell you this much it kind of leaves it open for one.",7,2,7,2 May 2009
Hot Fuzz," The Best Spoof Film So Far
","From the guys that brought you Shaun Of The Dead(2004), comes a cop comedy that takes goofy stabs at Lethal Weapon(1986), Point Break(1991), and Bad Boys(1995). But I like the way this movie didn't try to be an overly goofy spoof like Date Movie(2005), and Epic Movie(2006). It tries to make a certain story out of it, then the spoof parts are added in. It begins with Londons top cop named Nicholas Angel(Simon Pegg), who is transferred because he is to good at his job,(O'h boy what a reason that is). He is transferred to a small town were not much happens, Although Nick does not like it, he tries to make the best out of the situation. He is paired with Blissfully ignorant cop named Danny Butterman(Nick Frost). Then a few deaths start happening, Nick thinks there murders, but everybody else says there accidents. Will Nick ever prove it. An enjoyable comedy, believe me you'll laugh your head off.",10,0,0,26 April 2007
Constantine," It was as breathtaking as THE MATRIX.
","This movie had awesome effects, and an terrific performance by Keanu Reeves and Rachel Weiz. The comic book genre are more popular then ever, with the upcoming BATMAN BEGINS and FANTASTIC FOUR are on the way. I found this enjoyable, the story starts with John Constaine(Keanu Reeves) who is a demon slayer, dresses almost like a film noir detective. John can't seem to get his way into heaven, because of his suicide years ago, that he had a near death experience. But a detective(Rachel Weiz) comes to him for help, to find out why her sister killed herself. But John soon learns that demons are after her for reasons unknown.

Will they stop him before it's too late? The animation was not quite has great as Wreck it Ralph, but still good. Everybody voices there characters perfectly, they just fit them too well. Hugh Jackman has the easter bunny brings a comic touch to it. Although I couldn't tell if this was meant to a Christmas. But none the less an entertaining animated film, this is for parents to take there kids too, if they think if The Avengers and The Dark Knight Rises was too intense.",9,2,4,28 November 2012

Until while at a party, he meets a beautiful school teacher named Palmer(Brooklyn Decker), and they both seem to hit it off, until she finds his wedding ring. So he quickly asks his beautiful assistant Katherine(Jennifer Aniston) to pretend to be his soon to be ex wife, although Katherine does not like this idea, she goes along with it cause Danny is her friend. After an awkward meeting that goes well, but things get more awkward, Katherine picks up her cell phone, and it is something about her kids. And Palmer over hears it, now Danny has to pretend that Katherine's kids are his kids too, but will he pull it off? An entertaining comedy, Adam Sandler and Jennifer Aniston are funny together, and they seem to enjoy working together, hope they will again in the future? Brooklyn Decker is alright, and so are the kids, and Nick Swardson as Sandlers cousin. It was a very funny film, so where the appearances of Nicole Kidman and Dave Matthews.",8,3,9,14 February 2011
Terminator Salvation," Better than part 3.
","Part 3 was not all bad,but not great either, it could have been more than what it was. But Terminator Salvation makes up for T3 mistakes.Now set in the year 2018, humans are at war with Skynet, the company that makes the terminators. The leader of the resistance John Conner(Christian Bale) is trying to get Kyle Reese(Star Treks Anton Yelchin) before the terminators get him, and Conner knows that is his father, if does not get to him first, he might never exist. A stranger named Marcus(Sam Worthington) with a mysterious past, comes to help. But is unsure to trust him. Will they get to Kyle before it's too late?Although it is not quite as good as 1 and 2, Terminator Salvation does come into it's own. Christian Bale, Bryce Dallas Howard, Moon Bloodgood, Anton Yelchin are all good and do alright. But it's Sam Worthington that pretty much takes the picture as Marcus. Because it seems at times he is the star of the movie, because he gets more scenes then anybody. But still an entertaining film, with incredible action. So don't miss Terminator Salvation.",8,4,7,6 June 2009

500 Days of Summer," A real story of love
","I like the way ,this story does not try a typical romantic comedy, but instead it shows the reality of love. Of how you feel when your in love and how you feel after it's over. And that is what I liked about it, that there was no Hollywood's to it. It felt like reality of life.The centers around Tom(Joesph Gordon Levitt) who believes in true love, and there is Summer(Zoey Deschanel) who doesn't. But these get two get together, they begin quite a romance. But the question that comes to mind is that will it survive? The two leads Levitt and Deschanel have great chemistry and are believable in there roles. I also liked the way it was shot, quite beautiful I must say. 500 days of Summer is a winner.",10,1,3,20 August 2009
Juno," A dark funny look at everyday life.
","You would think that teen pregnancy is no laughing matter. Some films would tell you that like For Keeps(1988), and Fifteen and Pregnant(1998). But this film I was completely blown away how funny it was, it's funny without getting completely silly, and at the same time it manages to keep from being overly dramatic. This film is very light on it's feet. Ellen Page(X-Men 3) gives quite a memorable performance as the pregnant teen Juno, You just really like her, on moments when she is being nice or cynical, you just so drawn to her, she really makes you care about her. J.K.Simmons(OZ) is memorable as Junos loving dad. Jennifer Garner and Jason Bateman are also great, so is Michael Cera(Superbad).",10,1,4,23 February 2008
Don Jon," It's not a movie, it's an experience.
","Joseph Gordon Levitt first has writer and director, has tries to be a relaxing filmmaker where the cast are at ease in there scenes.The story of Jon(Joseph Gordon Levitt) who lives life in the fast lane, loves watching porn, working out at the gym, and picking up on woman at the night club. But then his thing on woman change, when a young woman(Scarlett Johansson) has different response to him. Then Jons thing on woman and begins to take an interesting turn, but how will it all play out? I will not say this is a great movie, because Joseph Gordon Levitt is quite a visionary director, but I felt he had trouble writing jokes that are funny, they basically being thrown down are throats, and come across like it's trying way too hard. And the porn thing felt like a one joke that just playing itself out. But the cast do alright, Levitt performance was pretty good, so was Johansson and Tony Danza has Levitts dad.",7,1,5,9 October 2013

With an all star team behind him, Deadpool will do what it takes to save the boy, but the question is will he?This sequel tops the original, and it knows it. Ryan Reynolds once again kills it as Deadpool, but Josh Brolin really steals it has Cable, did the same as Thanos in Avengers Infinity War. The way he and Ryan Reynolds just play off each other, makes them a perfect duo, and as Cable he comes into his own. Action scenes are well shot. The jokes really deliver on q perfectly. The film never loses sight on what it is. Looking forward to see more Josh Brolin has Cable.",10,8,18,28 May 2018
Spider-Man 3," They say the third time is the charm, sadly not in the case of Spider Man 3.
","I was hoping for it to be as good has 1 and 2. I mean the black suit story of Spider Man is the most popular one of all. I mean they had Sandman(Thomas Haden Church), Venom(Topher Grace), and the new Goblin(James Franco). But 1 and 2 are considered masterpieces, compared on how bad this film was. The acting brought nothing to the table, I mean Toby Maguire and Kirsten Dunst gave great performances in the first two. It's like there acting was just wearing thin. I had a feeling they were growing weary it there roles as Peter Parker and Mary Jane Watson, you just kind of see it in there performances. The effects were great, but that just kind of wore thin also. Thomas Haden Church as the Sandman, was not badly acted, but badly written. Topher Grace seems to bring some light in this. Will there be a Spider Man 4? After seeing this film I certainly hope not.",1,1,2,23 February 2008
Thor: Ragnarok," The Thor movie we have been wanting.
","Questions are answered like what happened to Odin(Anthony Hopkins) after Thor : The Dark World(2013), and were where Thor and The Hulk during Captain America : Civil War(2016).Thor(Chris Hemsworth) discovers he has a sister named Hela(Cate Blanchett) who is evil and has power beyond any control. And when Thor tries to fight her, Hela destroys his hammer, and Thor is transported to another planet, while Hela tries to rule Asgard. Will Thor stop her before it's too late? This is the best Thor all around, even knocks down the second Thor movie, got great humor and great action, Chris Hemsworth is always great has Thor, and has a cool fight with The Hulk, Mark Ruffalo brings some memorable moments here, so does Tom Hiddleston has Loki, and other cast members shine has well.

Woody Allens best film to date, what I heard on how he gets such a large cast of actors, he never puts demands on them, he lets them do there characters has they see fit. Owen Wilson was good here, making up for the forgetful Hall Pass. Rachel McAdams, Kathy Bates, Marion Cottilard, and Alison Pill. Woody Allen gives a great view of Paris, he tries to make audience feel like your really there, please check this humorous, magical out.",10,1,4,20 June 2011
The Last Song," Miley Cyrus has got a long way to go.
","Miley Cyrus is trying to prove she is more than just a good singer, but she can be a good actress as well, but her acting needs some work, not that it was all bad, but it just was'nt real in spots. Trying to get away from Hannah Montana is gonna be a long road.Now Liam Hensworth is alright his role, not just being a typical pretty boy. Liam and Miley have good chemistry, but not enough to make the movie interesting. Now Greg Kinnear is quite good as the dad, and so was Bobby Coleman as the little brother, and both of them give quite good performances. And it does have nice scenery. But the rest of the film just does'nt do much, some of the characters are not very interesting. But it was'nt all bad, but was'nt as good as Dear John.I think in time Miley Cyrus acting skills will improve.",5,4,10,12 April 2010
Zodiac," A thriller that really makes you think.
","The late 60's really were turbulent times, first with Charles Mansion, and a killer that calls himself Zodiac. He would kill people and make announcements to the police about it, and he would also write letters of mystery. But the story itself is not just a suspenseful thriller, it is also a story about the people investigating, and how it begins to take it's toll on all of them has the years pass by. Newspaper cartoonist Robert Graysmith(Jake Gyllenhaal) and reporter Paul Avery(Robert Downey Jr) try to uncover the clues of the killer, has two homicide detectives(Mark Ruffalo and Anthony Edwards). But do they ever find the Zodiac killer, I'm not gonna tell you,you'll half to see the movie to find out.

","In the year 2045 where there is not of anything except THE OASIS, a gaming system world, where anybody can go into the avatars they create, the creator of THE OASIS has died, but before that he left clues in the system, and when that someone finds the clues and makes it to the end, will own THE OASIS. And for five years nothing has been uncovered, until Wade( Tye Sheridan ) begins to stumble upon a clue, and starts to go further, but a big cooperation will stop at nothing to make he doesn't.
Steven Spielberg really shows he's still got, I'd sit through this more times then A Wrinkle In Time. The effects are enjoyable, so where the pop culture references, and yeah there are plenty of them. Although through the first part when in the real world it was pretty dull, but that got better has it went. Scenes in THE OASIS are also fun. The actors play there roles perfectly, everybody just really shines. Sometimes it's not about the ending, but more about the journey, and Ready Player One is a prime example of that.",10,1,4,2 April 2018
The Hateful Eight," Quentin Tarantino at his best
","I never saw Django Unchained, but I didn't want to miss The Hateful Eight. The title is a play on the western The Magnificent Seven. It was a western and also a murder mystery. Has the story slowly evolves, and the twist and turns. I don't want to tell you anymore, it's one off those movies you half to see to believe.Quentin Tarantino really shines here, with such clever dialog, and beautiful western setting. The actors really come alive, Kurt Russell and Samuel L. Jackson shine incredibly, so do Bruce Dern, Michael Madsen, Jennifer Jason Leigh, and Tim Roth are also good. If you don't like violence, then you should probably stay away. But I was entertained by this. Tarantino pays homage to his film Reservoir Dogs in spots.",9,20,62,31 December 2015
Dear John," A beautiful well told story about love and war.
","John(Channing Tatum) is in the armed forces, for now is now temporary leave, lives with his withdrawn father(Richard Jenkins). John is kind of loner, until he meets Savannah(Amanda Seyfried), they instantly become smitten with each other, for two weeks they are both inseparable, But then John has to go for a whole year in the service, but they both instantly write letters too each other, but will there love survive? Channing Tatum proves he can act, His performance was great, and not annoyingly stiff like it was in G.I. The Rise of Cobra. Amanda Seyfried gives quite an Oscar worthy performance. And she and Tatum have such beautiful chemistry. Supporting players don't disappoint Richard Jenkins and Henry Thomas are quite memorable. If you love The Notebook, then give Dear John a look.",10,7,14,8 February 2010
The Adventures of Tintin," Enough to make Indiana Jones blush.
","A well made animated film, there going in the same style as The Polar Express(2004). Although the characters don't seem animated at all, the animation was painted over the actors, there movements seemed real. I loved Steven Spielbergs direction, some incredible action sequences where incredible, the guy who did the Indiana Jones films, who better to direct The Adventures of tintin.Jamie Bell is awesome as Tintin, you just see his likeness in the character. So was Andy Serkis, Daniel Craig, Simon Pegg, and Nick Frost. It was the incredible adventure film since Indiana Jones. This is fun for kids and adults to enjoy. Not kids under 10.",8,4,7,28 December 2011
BlacKkKlansman," John David Washington comes into his own
","I hope this film make people see him as a good actor and not just the son of a good actor, and we all know who his father is.Based on the amazing true story, in 1979 African American police detective Ron Stallworth(John David Washington) calls the KKK pretending to be a racist white guy, suspecting there up to something sinister, but his partner and friend(Adam Driver) has to go in his place.Spike Lee really comes through has director, really showing both sides of hate, the ending shows how racism is never ending. John David Washington delivers an effective performance has Ron Stallworth, Adam Driver is also good. I also like the late 70's look to the film. Topher Grace delivers a likable and haunting performance has David Duke. Also has great tension and suspense. A well made undercover story, I know they where made up moments, I come to expect that in a lot movies based on true stories, but still a great film.",10,6,11,21 August 2018
Spider-Man: Homecoming," Liked it, but didn't love it.
","Not saying this was bad, I gotta say I was never really bored. It's a very flawed film, and it's very noticeable. Tom Holland does make a very believable Peter Parker AKA Spider Man, playing a teenager with super powers, and shows how a teenager would react to them.Takes place after the events of Civil War, So that right not another origin movie. Michael Keaton plays a good Spider Man villain, named The Vulture, you don't like what he does, but you have an understanding why he does it. Marisa Tomei does Aunt May has a loving mother figure very well, but I wish they could have written more for her. Effects are pretty descent, action scenes are okay but nothing like the original films. Robert Downey Jr has Tony Stark AKA Iron Man, plays a mentor to Peter, although he does care for Peter, but in one scene does show he becomes the mentor that Peter needs.The big problems here is the love interest, who I feel never becomes a character, but just fills the void of someone for Peter to be attractive too, unlike Mary Jane Watson and Gwen Stacey there is not a believable connection. And Peters best friend the typical funny sidekick, but comes across like he's trying way to hard, that never leads to any funny.Although not great, but not terrible, like I said I was never bored, and looking forward where the story goes after this.",8,11,19,12 July 2017
Fast & Furious 6," Has good as Fast Five
","Agent Hobbs(Dwayne Johnson) is hot on the trail of a gang of ruthless hijackers led by Shaw(Luke Evans) in London, and this gang is too clever, they always manage to stay two steps ahead of the law. So Hobbs figures you need criminals to catch criminals. So Hobbs ask for Toretto(Vin Diesel) and gang for help, and promises them full pardons if they succeed.The action is incredible, so where the characters, everybody plays off themselves perfectly. Luke Evans is calm, cool, villain. Dwayne Johnson really owns things up in all most every scene he's in. Vin Diesel is entertaining has Toretto. But it's Tyrese Gibson who steals the show has the nitwit of the group. It does have good fight scenes, and the car chase scenes are pretty intense.",8,1,3,27 May 2013
The Expendables," kick butt, take no prisoners, action flick.
","And if that is the type of film you want in an action film, Then The Expendables delivers. It has quite a cast, Sylvester Stallone, Dolph Lungren, Steve Austin, Jason Statham, Jet Li, Randy Couture, Charisma Carpenter, Eric Roberts, Terry Crews, and Mickey Rourke.I don't want to get into the plot too much, but you will get your moneys worth, Stallone has improved his skills has a director. and he doesn't try to hog the spotlight, he let's the cast really shine in there own way. Action scenes don't disappoint, you will the rush. It is an action to check out. It is right up there with The Losers and The A- Team. This movie is a good time nothing more, for people who love action.",8,2,8,17 August 2010
Megamind," What Shrek was too fairy tales, Megamind is too superheros
","A entertaining send up of Superman, but this really takes through the super villains point of view.An alien with a big blue head named Megamind(Will Ferrell) is a super villain because he feels it was his destiny. As with nemesis Metro Man(Brad Pitt), a superman like hero with a Bruce Campbell like grin. One day captures news reporter Roxanne(Tina Fey),in hopes of luring Metro Man in a trap to destroy him, when his plan does work, Megamind quickly feels he is lost without someone to battle with. so he quickly gets a sample of Metro Mans DNA, and puts it into cameraman Hank(Jonah Hill), but Megaminds plan quickly goes down hill, cause instead of creating a hero, he ends up creating a villain, worse than him. How will Megamind put this too an end? Not quite as good as The Incredibles(2004), but still good, Ferrell, Pitt, Fey, and Hill are all good in there voices. It was a funny superhero like send up. It also had great animation also. So if you had enough of Shrek, then give Meghamind a look.",8,0,3,10 November 2010
Blades of Glory," The Odd Couple On Ice.
","Two rival figure skaters, the clean cut, almost girlie man looking Jimmy MacElroy(Jon Heder) and the slobbery, heavy drinking, womanizing Chaz Michaels(Will Ferrell) are banned from skating, after a fight the two had, caused some damages. Only years later to discover the only way to get back on the ice if they skate in pairs. There coach(Craig T. Nelson) gets them both in on it, to become the first male team skaters. Has laughable has it sounds, the two go along with it. But will they pull it off? Will Ferrell once again delivers an over the top performance like he did in Anchorman(2004), unlike his performance in Stranger Then Fiction(2006). But the funny part as he plays off Jon Heder, who delivers an awkward comedic performance like he did in Napolean Dynamite(2004). And the gross out gags are kept to a bare minimum, it is more Three Stooges like slapstick. It was pretty funny and enjoyable, but I would not consider it a classic.",7,1,4,1 April 2007
Horrible Bosses," Puts The Hangover to shame.
","I never thought any film could funnier than Bridesmaids or The Hangover and part 2. But Horrible Bosses puts one up on both of them.The story evolves around three friends(Jason Bateman, Jason Sudeikis,and Charlie Day) each all have one thing in common, they all have a boss that make there lives a miserable place to live in. Sudeikis boss is played by Collin Farrell, who is a crazy drug addled fool, and likes to fire people because of certain things about them, Days boss is played by Jennifer Aniston, a sexy temptress, who sexually harasses him, a good part of the day, and Batemans boss is played by Kevin Spacey, is a guy you don't even love to hate, you just hate period. All three come up with a plan kill each others bosses, they get advise from a former Criminal played by Jamie Fox, but the question is will they go through with it? Horrible Bosses I think is the funniest movie of 2011, Bateman, Day, and Sudeikis are all very funny, they play off each other perfectly, and there funny reactions during all the hilarity. The bosses are pretty funny, and unlikable in there own way. And Aniston is good too, a little departure from what she usually plays. Like I said it puts The Hangover to shame.",10,3,5,10 July 2011
Black Mass," Goodfellas ain't got nothing on Black Mass
","The film chronicles the rise and fall of notorious gangster James Whitey Bulger(Johnny Depp) and his Winter Hill Gang. Who in the mid 1970's became an FBI informant by agent John Connolly(Joel Edgerton) who is a childhood friend. Not to mention his politician brother Billy Bulger(Benedict Cumberbatch) who loves his brother, but chooses not to get involved in his activities.This was a very suspenseful film, it really pulls out all the stops of a true gangster film. Everybody delivers in there performances, Joel Edgerton, Kevin Bacon, and Benedict Cumberbatch. But it's Johnny Depp has Whitey Bulger that really takes the film, I mean he really knocks it out the park. Depp is so frightening, you'll be grabbing your seat in terror every time he's on the screen, cause you'll feel like somethings going down. I liked the 70's and 80's look also. I hope Depp will be nominated for a Oscar.",10,1,8,23 September 2015
The Town," Ben Afflecks brilliant directing
","His performance in this was alright, but nothing Oscar worthy. But his directing was astonishing, he is like the next Clint Eastwood in directing. I never thought a crime drama and a love story can be well mixed together, and performances don't disappoint, from Jeremy Renner, Jon Hamm, Chris Cooper, Blake Lively and Rebecca Hall.In Charlestown, a gang of thieves led by MacRay(Ben Affleck) who prepare for a bank heist, they rob the bank wearing Halloween like masks, but take a bank teller(Rebecca Hall) hostage, in hopes to ward off the cops, they let her go. And she can't identify any of them. But MacRay is concerned about her, and he pursues her, and they quickly develop a realiontship. But will this complicate his next heist, and with his gang. And an FBI agent(Jon Hamm) who is slowly closing in on them.A well made crime drama/love story, it is quite a tension grabber. You really get in to the characters. If loved Heat(1995), and The Departed(2006) then you'll love The Town.",9,4,8,22 September 2010
Underworld Awakening," Amusing, but does not match up to the first two.
","I liked Underworld(2003), and Underworld Evolution(2006), but Underworld : Rise of the Lycans(2009) not so much. I don't know why they want to continue this, maybe there competing with Twilight. Sometimes you just drive it in the ground, when you keep it going too long.Vampires separated warrior Selene(Kate Beckinsale) is separated from Michael after an explosion, crogenical frozen, when she comes out of it, she finds that 12 years have passed.I don't give anything away. This film is not bad, it just has too many plot holes, that never get explained, or either they do, but go pretty quickly. Some action scenes don't disappoint, and effects too are awesome, better than Red Riding Hood(2011). But it rips off a little Matrix Reloaded and Resident Evil, but this is a movie you can enjoy on a Friday night.",7,6,12,22 January 2012
Suicide Squad," The Anti Avengers
","Taken place after the events of Batman V Superman, Amanda Waller(Viola Davis) puts together a team of criminals with unique abilities in hopes to stop a big enemy, and they are Deadshot(Will Smith), Harley Quinn(Margot Robbie),El Diablo(Jay Hernandez), and Captain Boomerang(Jai Courtney) to name a few. But will they pull it off? I found this very entertaining, and I don't care what critics say. Suicide Squad was fun and never takes itself too seriously to a point. The cast really work well together, although the two who get more focused on are Deadshot and Harley Quinn, although EL Diablo does get some to do, but everybody else is just kind of there. Will Smith is just being Will Smith as Deadshot, Margot Robbie does give a fun insane sexy performance as Harley Quinn. Jared Leto does give quite a nightmarish performance has The Joker, he's good but does not top Heath Ledger, but that is a tough act to follow. Jay Hernandez is quite descent has El Diablo. Now Viola Davis is awesome has Amanda Waller, tough and ruthless, nobody you want to mess with. Jai Courtney is alright has Captain Boomerang. Action scenes are incredible, and effects are awesome.This is not a masterpiece, but it never tries to be, but a fun entertaining film, go in expecting nothing more or less.",8,0,3,6 August 2016

While there investigating, they discover things are not what they seem, has every twist and turn keeps coming into play, and knowing who to trust and who not to trust, but the main twist of the whole story, is the one that will shock you the most.Martin Scorsese brings the suspense of Alfred Hitchcock, and weird artiness of Stanley Kubrick, and does it quite brilliantly. Leonardo Dicaprio is quite brilliant here, he really throws himself out there. And the supporting cast are also good, Ben Kingsley, Mark Ruffalo, Max Von Sydow, Emily Mortimer, Jackie Earle Haley, and Patricia Clarkson. This is a thriller you should check out.",9,2,6,24 February 2010
Captain America: The Winter Soldier," Knocks Iron Man 3 and Thor:The Dark World down.
","It's gonna be hard for any Marvel movie this new Captain America movie, this film has great action, and good acting, and mixes a little of a on the run type thrillers like Three days of the Condor(1975).Steve Rodgers/Captain America(Chris Evans) is S.H.I.E.D.S top agent, while still trying to adjust to life in the new millennium. But then is double crossed by someone inside, and he and Black Widow(Scarlett Johansson) quickly go on the run, while trying to uncover of who is behind this, they are tailed by someone who is called The Winter Soldier, who's super human abilities are a match for Captain America.This marvel film is gonna be hard to top. Chris Evans is great, so was Scarlett Johansson and Samuel L. Jackson we really get to see them grow has characters here. Anthony Mackie was awesome The Falcon, hope to see him in more marvel movies in the future. Robert Redford is good also, never thought i'd see him in a superhero film, but he was great. It had great action, and great fight scenes. This marvel film is gonna be hard to top.",10,1,2,6 April 2014

","An Indian Teenager named Pi is lost at sea, on a life boat, with a man hungry tiger named Richard Parker. Pi does what it takes to survive, while trying not to be eaten. Will Pi keep his faith, and make it through this ordeal? Ang Lees direction is brilliant, so was the teenager playing Pi. The movie makes you feel that your lost at sea with the character. And the tiger is also good, I'm wondering what parts CGI. Although it does drag in spots, too the point where I was dozing a little, but it then it picks up. I think this is the best film of 2012, I hope it won't be missed by the Oscars. If they do miss it, well it's there loss.",10,6,12,25 November 2012

She strikes a bargain with Flynn, Rapunzel has hidden his stolen goods, and tells him that if he takes her to see a mysterious lights in the sky, Flynn agrees to it, but the question is will they get there?The most fun animation since Shrek and Toy Story. I mean the animation just jumps out at you. And Perfect voice casting, Zachery Levi and Mandy Moore where just too perfect. So was Donna Murphy and Brad Garratt in there roles.

After so many operations with no success, travels to Nepal, when hearing about a miracle worker, only to discover that miracle worker is a sorceress, Strange soon becomes intrigued by the mystic arts.Marvel never ceases to amaze me, the effects are beyond amazing, not since The Matrix and Inception. Cumberbatch really brings his own to this role, I hope to see more of him has Doctor Strange in future movies. All the rest of the cast are also good, Tilda Swinton, Chiwetel Ejiofor, Mads Mikkelsen and Rachel McAdams are great to watch also. Now I'm eagerly awaiting to see more of Dr. Strange.",9,3,8,9 November 2016
Interstellar," Interstellar succeeds where Transcendence failed.
","It manages to be a science fiction tale, and at the same time stay grounded in realism, Is what Transcendence tried to do, but didn't quite get there. The performances where very Oscar worthy, and none the characters never for once seemed annoyingly one noted, when anybody was happy or sad in the film you where feeling it with them.Cooper(Matthew McConaughey) a widowed farmer, and former air force pilot, raising two kids, is chosen by NASA to help another place to live for human race, cause the earth is slowly dying. With the heartbreak of having to leave his family. Will Cooper and his launch team succeed before it's too late? I'm sure the filmmakers did there homework on space travel, cause I don't think there just trying to make another sci-fi adventure, they wanted this to feel grounded in reality has possible. Christopher Nolan never ceases to amaze me as a director, with all his films so far, I'm hoping he never slips up. There are some nods to 2001 a Space Odyssey, but this really stands on its own. This effects are beyond incredible. And great performances by Matthew McConaughey, Anne Hathaway, Michael Caine, and Jessica Chastain.",10,7,13,13 November 2014

Ben Solo( Kylo Ren) still becomes obsessed with turning Rey to the dark side.There is more to the movie that I don't want to spoil. Finally the questions that fans have been wanting to be answered, and it does finally here. Daisy Ridgley and Adam Driver both give memorable performances. So does John Boyega and Oscar Isaac as Finn and Poe. The effects are pretty good, and so is the action. R.I.P. Carrie Fisher(1956-2016) you will forever be our favorite Princess. This movie is not perfect, it has some flaws. But It's proof that Star Wars will live on forever.",10,5,18,26 December 2019

","Giant aliens from the sea, have wrecked havoc, destroying half the cities of the world, so the military puts up a funding for an experiment to build giant sized robots called Jaegers, in hopes of being our last line defense, but the question is will it? director Guillermo del Toro really shows how much he is a big fan of those old giant monster movies from Japan. Pacific Rim is a tribute to those old films. The effects are incredible, they don't look fake or phony CGI like your always seeing. But it does not only depend on the action and the effects, but the cast really bring a presence to this. It's over two hours but does not feel like it is, unlike The Lone Ranger. Pacific Rim is very well paced, never gets boring for a second.",10,4,12,14 July 2013
Ant-Man," little giant man
","I wasn't sure that I would like this, cause after the whole Edgar Wright thing. But I gave this movie the benefit, and did I like it?Scott Lang(Paul Rudd) a former thief who is trying to make ends meat, but finds himself in a situation by millionaire Hank Pym(Michael Douglas) who is an inventor of a suit that shrink to the size of an ant, Pym himself was a former superhero known has Ant Man, he is looking at Lang to be the new Ant Man.I really liked this, it was nothing real big like The Avengers but it was a real fun time. The shrinking effects are terrific, just really keeps you glued. A lot of people where not sure about casting of Paul Rudd as the hero, but Paul Rudd has such a likable presence about him, proved to be the best choice. Michael Douglas was also great. Michael Pena really steals a lot of the movie for any scene he is in, cause he just delivers the laughs. My only problem with this is the villain, he never comes across to frightening to the point you'll feel shaken in your seats. But I really was entertained, I hope to see more Ant Man films in the future.",9,1,10,20 July 2015

Are assigned to go undercover as teenagers by there loud mouth captain(Ice Cube), to find a drug supplier, who is giving teenagers a dangerous new drug. Will these cops come through in the end or will they blow there cover? Tatum and Hill are like the funniest unlikely comedy team in years, they just really played off each other. Ice Cube and Rob Riggle are funny also. This is like watching a Police Academy movie, It's stupid and it knows how stupid it's being, but I'd be lying if I said it wasn't funny, which it was. But if your easily offended, you should not see this. But it was funny.",8,1,5,19 March 2012
Captain America: The First Avenger," They finally got it right.
","There where many attempts to bring the comic book superhero known has Captain America in to live action, including the abomination one from 1990. Now I had my doubts about Chris Evans playing the title role, I felt he would have been miscast like Ryan Reynolds was in Green Lantern.The story begins during the time of World War 2, and Steve Rodgers(Chris Evans) wants to a soldier, and fight for his country, but he is short and skinny, and considered to weak to be a soldier. But Steve catches the attention of a German scientist(Stanley Tucci) who admires Steves determination, and asks would he be apart of an experiment, that would make him into super soldier. Steve agrees and becomes Captain America. And discovers he has an enemy to stop known has The Red Skull(Hugo Weaving).The version was done right, forgot those other versions of Captain America, this one did everything correctly. Chris Evans surprised me, his performance was decent, showed a lot of strength and vulnerability. The action scenes where beyond incredible. Hugo Weaving a great Red Skull. Tommy Lee Jones, Stanley Tucci, and Hayley Atwell where also good. Please don't miss this one.",10,2,16,25 July 2011

The two have a love and hate kind of thing going, that keeps there competitive going.Excellent film, that captures the look of the 70's perfectly. Director Ron Howard does it again, his direction is brilliant. Chris Hemsworth gives a good performance has James Hunt, and Daniel Bruhl as Nicki Lauda, showing there desire to race, and at times egos getting in the way. But both having the strong desire for greatness, I think that it was well captured on film.",10,2,3,30 October 2013

But has Jack mines the earth he is soon gonna discover not everything is what it appears to be.The best sci-fi odyssey since 2001(1968), and Moon(2009), the effects are incredible, beyond I've seen in any sci-fi film thus far. Tom Cruise is good has our hero, so was Morgan Freeman, Andrea Risenborough, and Olga Kurylenkogga(Hit Man, Max Payne, and Quantum of Solace).",9,1,3,22 April 2013
Bohemian Rhapsody," Rami Malek rocked it as Freddie Mercury.
","The story is about the beginnings of the rock group known has Queen, and there ups and downs with success.Rami Malek became Freddie Mercury, you see he really did his homework on the man to the point he makes you forget that it's an actor and believe it really is Freddie. So Gwilym Lee as Guitarist Brian May, he looks and sounds like him to the point I thought it really was Brian May playing himself. And everybody else does is pretty good. So is the music, this film I believe will make new fans of Queen. The movie shows how success changes you a little. Now I know there moments from real life changed for the movie, but it didn't bother me, I still thought it was a good movie.",10,4,6,8 November 2018
Bird Box," If you loved A Quiet Place then give Bird Box a look.

A woman(Sandra Bullock) and two kids take a journey blindfolded through the woods trying to cross the river, the reason they are blindfolded, if they see this dangerous force, will become crazy murders. But the question is will they make it?I like the way the movie jumps from the past to the present, and does it very well. Sandra Bullock gives a very real performance, doing what she can to protect the kids from danger. John Malkovich is also good in his supporting role. Good tension scenes, the suspence got grabs you like crazy.",9,1,4,28 December 2018
Burn After Reading," An entertaining comedy-thriller
","In the best way that the Coen brothers can deliver so well. This movie had it all,comedy,drama and suspense, and it brings it all together so well. An all star cast that keep you laughing, and holding on your seat with excitement, on what happens next.It begins with former C.I.A. annalist named Osbourne(John Malkovich) secret disk gets copied, and ends up in the hands of two dumb gym instructors(Frances Mcdormand and Brad Pitt) who want to use it for there own wealth. Meanwhile Osbourne wife(Tilda Swinton), is having an affair with Harry(George Clooney) who has his own secrets.It's a perfectly well done film, each actor are good and perfectly well cast. It shows how imperfect the world is, and how the stupid mess's we get ourselves into.",9,6,13,23 September 2008
Watchmen," I watched the WATCHMEN and was entertained.
","This is the best movie of 2009. It is right up there with Sin City(2005), and 300(2007). It really captures almost everything we enjoyed about the graphic novel. There where some changes, I'm not gonna say what they are. But the changes are not to big, other then that it stays true to the story.Now the roles of Nite Owl 2(Patrick Wilson), Silk Spectre 2(Malin Ackerman), The Comedian(Jeffrey Dean Morgan), and Dr. Manhattan(Billy Crudup), I believe where pretty easy to cast, not to mention Dr. Manhattan who is pretty much a CGI effect, and Nite Owl 2 looks like Batmans fraternal twin, and Silk Spectra 2 looks like the lovechild of Batman and Electra. But when I saw Jeffrey Dean Morgan in The Comedians outfit, it was like the character just walk off the page.Now the role of Rorschach, the film noir dressed vigilante, wearing a white mask, that has black spots that keep changing shape, was probably the most difficult role to cast, they had to find an actor, who could embody the most popular character of the them all. They needed to find the right actor. And Jackie Earle Haley did it perfectly, when cameras started rolling he wasn't acting like Rorschach, he became Rorschach. Really bringing Rorschach alive on the big screen. Like the way Heath Ledger embodied The Joker in The Dark Knight(2008), Jackie Earle Haley did the same with Rorschach.Watchmen changed the way we view superheros, very well done by Alan Moore and Dave Gibbons. And the film is perfectly directed by Zack Snyer(300). It also has great acting, and great action. But be warned this is not a movie for kids, in case they have not read the graphic novel. A great movie, you won't be disappointed.",10,5,9,9 March 2009
Baby Driver," If you think you've seen some awesome drivers, then you don't know Baby.
","A young getaway driver who goes by the name Baby(Ansel Elgort), who works for a crime boss(Kevin Spacey), Baby uses music to keep his sanity at bay, and helps him the getaways, is why he is best driver ever. Baby meets a beautiful waitress named Debora(Lilly James) who is full of personality, and she and Baby begin to start a relationship, but Baby is not quite out as he thought, has he gets pulled in again into another heist. Will Baby get out the heist business, or is he forever in there hands? Edgar Wright really shines here as a director, lightens up the moments with the music. Ansel Elgort comes into his own has Baby, never gets out shined by the rest of the cast, he plays Baby has clever but not quite sophisticated. Kevin Spacey is good has the crime boss, who really sells the fear with a cold eye stare. Jon Hamm is great as thief who befriends Baby. Jamie Foxx steals some scenes has Bats, a devil may care sociopath thief, who is so good at being hated to the point where the audience would probably cheer when Bats finally gets his. Chase scenes are well filmed. My only problem with this is Lilly James, she starts out with personality, then later reduced too the typical girlfriend, I thought she deserved better then that. But Baby Diver is an effective film, makes me wonder what's next for Edgar Wright.",9,19,35,28 June 2017
Justice League," The League has arrived
","After Marvels The Avengers(2012), I'm sure comic book fans where wondering when there will be a live action version of DCs Justice League, It has been in animated, now it's finally here. But unlike The Avengers this film feels more rushed and quickly put together. But it was still enjoyable.Batman(Ben Affleck), Wonder Woman(Gal Gadot), AquaMan(Jason Momoa), Cyborg(Ray Fisher), and The Flash(Ezra Miller) discover that a big threat is coming, and must team up to stop it.Not quite has epic has The Avengers, but still an entertaining film, a little bit over the top with CGI. The actors has the iconic characters really do well, all have a great chemistry. Although I felt that Ezra Miller was overdoing the nerd bit with his character. This has been getting mixed reviews by critics, pretty much all DCU films have been getting, except for Wonder Woman. I hope to see more Justice League films in the future.",9,1,4,20 November 2017
Man of Steel," A good Superman movie finally flies in, yeah it even tops Christopher Reeve.
","I liked Superman 1(1978) and Superman 2(1980) despite there flaws, they where great movies, with the exception of Superman 3(1983), which was alright but not great, and then came Superman 4:The Quest for Peace(1987), and the audience went dead silent. Then came Superman Returns(2006) which was in the league as Superman 3, alright but not great, yeah I did like it at first, but then I looked at it again, I saw too many plot holes then I could count, but still not a bad film.Now it's 2013, and here comes Man of Steel. Clark Kent(Henry Cavill) struggling to live a normal life, even though he has incredible super human powers, remembering what his adopted parents(Kevin Costner and Diane Lane) did to protect him from the world that won't understand. General Zod(Michael Shannon) an old enemy from Clarks family from Krypton, comes to invade earth with his crew, looking for Clark. How will this turn out? It tops the Christopher Reeve movie, that is really hard to say cause I have such love for that movie, but Man of Steel explores things that Superman(1978) just didn't, the feeling of being different, his relationship with his adopted parents, and the character Jorel played by Russell Crowe has more to do, so does Lois Lane played by Amy Adams. Henry Cavill is good as Clark Kent\Superman, although in some parts he comes across as too dry, but he is good in the rest of it. The effects are beyond good. The film manges to humanize Superman, it even takes it up a notch then the Christopher Reeve film. Zach Snyder is brilliant as director. I can't wait to see more Man of Steel films in the future. So ignore those critics who are bashing this movie.",10,4,8,26 June 2013
21," If you loved Good Will Hunting and Ocean's 11, then give 21 a try.
","Take a brilliant mind and mix it with Las Vegas, and you get is an incredible story, that had a good mix of some drama, humor, and suspense. Jim Sturgess who was last seen in Across The Universe(2007), and The Other Boleyn Girl(2008), really comes alive here, he looks a cross between Jude Law and Jake Gyllenhaal. Not to mention Kevin Spacey and Laurence Fishburne are also great. Lets not forget the ever so lovely Kate Bosworth who really shines in her role. The story starts with Ben Campbell(well acted by Jim Sturgess) who is a MIT student, who has a brilliant intelligent mind when it comes to numbers. But Ben discovers that there are problems that his brilliant mind can't solve. When he has trouble paying for school. But his luck quickly changes, when he is asked by college professor Mickey Rosa(Kevin Spacey), and some other MIT students including the beautiful Jill Taylor(Kate Bosworth) to help them count cards in Las Vegas. Although unsure about it, he goes along with. They think that he can help them win, cause of his brilliant mind. But what happens when the stakes get to high? It was a great casino thriller. Please don't miss it.",9,15,29,4 April 2008
Trouble with the Curve," Eastwood and Adams are wonderful, but it's bad pacing that brings the film down.
","I know the this film was not meant to be fast paced, but the times when the pacing was so slow, the scenery became more of a character then the people. Clint Eastwood and Amy Adams are great and believable has father and daughter. So was John Goodman and Matthew Lillard are also good in there supporting roles.But the baseball parts are kind of dull. Justin Timberlakes character was just written has a love interest for Adams, although they give some background about his character, but he is just there for Adams nothing more, there chemistry felt forced. The movie is not terrible, but seriously dull, it's because of Eastwood and Adams that i'm not giving it a lower rating. Last years Moneyball was not dull like this.",6,3,9,27 September 2012
Bridge of Spies," Spielberg and Hanks do it again
","Has a director Steven Spielberg never ceases to amaze me, so does Tom Hanks as an actor. It's 2 hours and 20 minutes, but because it's so well paced it never feels likes it is that long. The film really shows how politics where in the late 50's, a somewhat crazy era.James Donovan(Tom Hanks) a lawyer who is defending an immigrant named Adel(Mark Rylance) who is suspected of being a spy, even though Donovan encounters a lot of hatred by a lot of people for taking the case.There is a lot more to the movie in which I don't want to spoil. It feels like a two parter of a movie. Hanks really delivers in his performance, I like the way he never backs down, in the face of all the hatred he endures. His determination is what keeps the movie going. Spielberg also shows the greatness of the director that he is. Really capturing the era of that time. I feel the film goes beyond just being a cold war thriller.",10,3,8,23 October 2015
Split," Split really delivers
","On a perfect sunny day three teenage girls are kidnapped by a man(James McAvoy) for reasons unknown. The girls try to figure away to escape, soon the guy has a personality disorder, and are scared if they are gonna get out alive.M. Night Shyamalan once again proves he's still got it after The Visit(2015), and now Split, James McAvoys performance really keeps you on edge, as an actor he really believes he is all these personalities, that is how an actor sometimes works cause if he doesn't believe it, then the audience won't either. Anya Taylor Joy is also great here, I believe one day we'll see an Oscar in her future. Betty Buckley(Carrie, Eight is Enough) is great has the doctor trying to help McAvoy. You may think it's a movie about a man with a personality disorder, but it becomes so much more than that. If you like a movie that will keep you on edge, then check Split out.If you are a fan of Shyamalans earlier work, then stay around towards the end, cause he puts one of his earlier films in the same universe with this film, which makes me excited for a sequel.",9,4,14,23 January 2017
Hugo," A film for kids and adults to enjoy.
","Going into this felt weird, I mean Martin Scorsese directing a film for the whole family, a film he is not used to doing. He is best known directing intense dramas like Taxi Driver(1976), Raging Bull(1980), The Departed(2006), and Shutter Island(2010) to name a few. But I would be lying, if I was saying I was not entertained, I most certainly was.The setting is in the 1930's , where a 12 year old named Hugo(Asa Butterfield) lives, and operates the clock there on a regular basis, takes food, And hopes to not be discovered by The Inspector(Sasha Baron Cohen). But is found out by a owner of a toy shop(Ben Kingsley), makes Hugo empty his pockets, but when he finds a certain note book of Hugos, and starts to read it, he becomes emotional, but why? Hugo and the owners niece(Chole Moretz, Kick Ass) both try to uncover the secret together?I'll give you a hint without giving anything away, for movie lovers out there,this movie is a reminder why we love movies. Asa Butterfield was good, so was Chole Moretz, and Ben Kingsley, and Sasha Baron Cohen. It was such a beautiful magical tale, and also Martin Scorseses best work in years.",10,4,9,7 December 2011
Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse," I liked it more than Spider Man : Homecoming
","The film is like a comic book come to life, I mean that's the look the filmmakers where looking for. Attempts to be two things at once, a Spider Man film and a sort of parody of a Spider Man film. It does have heart, and never goes to far into silliness. The animation is really amazing, takes the audience into this world. And I was wondering when we where gonna see the other Spider characters, and here we finally do and it was worth it.
I hope we more movies with the characters of Spider Gwen, Miles Morales, and Spider Man Noir to name a few. It has a great story, telling us about things in case we get stuck in sub plot. Now I it differs a little from the comic. But I expect a lot of times in comic book movies. Hope to see more Spider Verse movies in the future.",9,10,18,21 December 2018
Wanted," If you enjoyed The Matrix, Sin City, and Shoot 'Em Up, then you will enjoy WANTED.
","Wanted is really right down that ally of The Matrix, Sin City, and Shoot'Em Up. It has all the elements of sly humor, intense action, and also violent like Fight Club was. The story begins with Wesley Gibson(James McAvoy) a young filling clerk, who feels he leads quite a miserable existence, his boss belittles him every chance she gets. His girlfriend is quite bitchy, and she is fooling around with his best friend. And he takes pills to keep him from having anxiety attacks. That all changes one day, while at the grocery store, he meets up with Fox(Anjelina Jolie) a woman who tells him that she knew his father, and that his father who was an assassin. After they got from a hit attempt on there lives. He is brought to a building, and only to find out that the people around are killers led by Sloan(Morgan Freeman). Killers who kill bad people. They want Wesley to join them, but what destiny will Wesley choose? Quite an enjoyable action flick I must say. James Mcavoy is so good in an American accent, you start to forget he is really Scottish. The rest of the cast do well also. This is a film you would hate to miss.",9,3,8,29 June 2008
Warrior," Almost as good has The Fighter
","The story is about two brothers, Brendan(Joel Edgerton) who is a high school teacher, and his happily married with two children, but is going bankrupt, and he might lose his house, he used to be a UFC fighter, in hopes of making a lot of money for his family. Tommy(Tom Hardy) a former marine, with a big chip on his shoulder, returns to confront his father(Nick Nolte), who used to be a drunk, While training at the gym, Tommy spars with an upcoming UFC fighter, and puts him in his place. Tommy gets an offer to become a UFC fighter,and asks his father to be his trainer. But how will it come between the two brothers? I lot of training was put in this movie and the effort really shows, it had a lot of intense fighting. Tom Hardy was amazing, his performance was almost Oscar worthy, and he does a great Brooklyn accent, you'll forget he's actually British. Now Joel Edgerton was alright, but his performance was quite boring compared to Hardys. Nick Nolte was mesmerizing has there former drunk father, who is trying to connect with his two sons, I hope he will not be missed by the Oscars. A great film, almost as good has The Fighter.",8,0,5,14 September 2011
Salt," This Salt needs no pepper.
","The story evolves around Evelyn Salt(Angelina Jolie), a C.I.A. operative, who is happily married, her life seems to be almost perfect. But that all seems to change, when a Russian defector, is arrested and brought in head quarters, is questioned by Evelyn, and tells her about a plan to assassinate the Russian president, and he also points out that Evelyn is a Russian spy, when results come up true, she quickly goes on the run, but the question comes to mind, who's side is she on? A solid action thriller, that is memorable at times, but the action scenes strecth a little far beyond belief, and I liked the idea that wasn't at all to predicable. I say this is a flick worth checking out.",8,4,12,24 July 2010
Ender's Game," Great sci-fi drama
","In the distant future where an alien invasion is coming towards earth, a colonel(Harrison Ford) puts his faith in Ender Wiggins(Asa Butterfield) a shy, but very smart teenage boy, believing he has the ability to stop the invasion. Putting him through training, testing his physical ability and his mind. Will Ender will triumph in the end? A great sci-fi action drama, it just never gets boring for a second regardless of what some critics say. Asa Butterfield is like the best young actor of his generation, I can see an Oscar in his future, he holds his own with Harrison Ford and Ben Kingsley, and that is not always easy, but he does with no problem. Harrison Ford and Ben Kingsley are good in there roles, so was Hallie Steinfield. But I didn't feel there was much character with Abigail Breslin who plays Enders sister.",10,3,11,6 November 2013
Monsters vs. Aliens," A fun sci-fi flick for all ages.
","What do you get, when you put Attack of the 50 Foot Woman, Indapendence Day,and Men In Black all in a blender, you get the entertaining animated flick known has Monsters vs Aliens.It starts with Susan(voiced by Reese Witherspoon) on the day she's getting married, looks up at the sky, and is suddenly hit by a meteor. When she get up to alter, she begins to grow about 50 feet tall. Is knocked out and is brought to a secret place where monsters are being held by the general(voiced by Kiefer Sutherland). While still feeling like a freak, she befriends some monsters a blob named B.O.B.(Seth Rogen), a talking Cockroach(Hugh Laurie), and the missing link(Will Arnett). But then aliens start to invade earth, and the monsters are chosen to be the earths saviors, but will they succeed? The most fun animated flick since The Incredibles. The other guest voices where good also, like Rainn Wilson, Stephen Colbert, and Paul Rudd. It had incredible effects also. A fun animated sci-fi flick for the whole family.",10,1,4,22 April 2009
Step Up 2: The Streets," It's as charming, has the original.
","I thought this was not gonna be has good as the first Step Up(2006), cause some sequels try to a carbon copy of the original. But Step Up 2 was not quite copy. This sequel makes a little note to the first one, reprising his role in a guest shot by Channing Tatum as Tyler Kage from the first one, but other then that this movie stands on it's own. It starts with Andie(Briana Evigan) is a member of a dance group called the 411, and can't seem to stay out of trouble, but is giving one more chance when she gets an audition, and ends up passing a school for the performing arts, during that time she meets up with Chase Collins(Robert Hoffman) an another aspiring dancer, in which they start out rocky, but gets better has it goes on. But school takes up too much of Andies time, and her crew dumps her. But Andie and Chase try to put there own crew together. But taking the schools most talented outcasts, and making them into a team. But will they make it? You'll half to see the movie to find out. This movie had great dancing, and great performances by Briana Evigan and Robert Hoffman, and not to mention great dancing. If you loved Step Up(2006), then you'll love Step up 2:The Streets.",8,1,4,9 March 2008
The 40-Year-Old Virgin," Steve Carell is a sheer perfection for comic timing.
","He manages not to get real silly like Will Ferrell probably would if he was playing role. He manages to be funny at just the right moment. The story evolves around Andy(Steve Carell), and you knowing the title, is a 40 year old virgin, because after years of unsuccessfully attempts on ever trying to get laid, he just kind of quit altogether. These days he spends his time reading comic books, collecting classic action figures, and working at an electronics store. But then his co-workers(who Carell plays off of in a very funny way) discover he has not had sex, they soon try to help him. But then he meets Trish(Katherine Keener) and begins a relationship with her, but soon becomes worried were to go with it. This movie was great allover, it is a comedy classic.",10,3,5,22 June 2006
The Men Who Stare at Goats," The Critics Who Stare at a Bland Film.
","You think a movie starring such talented actors like Jeff Bridges, Kevin Spacey, George Clooney, and Ewan McGregor, that it would be an entertaining film. But not the case here, these actors are just slumming it out. The story simply goes nowhere with it self, and it really falls apart towards the end, just when you feel the movie is gonna go to an interesting place, it simply doesn't. I don't think this movie is based on true story, I feel it was inspired off true events.I'll give this a little credit, Jeff Bridges, George Clooney, and Ewan Mcgregor do shine a little bit, they seem to have wonderful chemistry. And make this film a little bit interesting. But Kevin Spacey I was really surprised, who is also good and memorable in anything he does, but in this film i felt he didn't shine at all, he was there in the moments and that was it. And at times when it tried to be funny, it really wasn't. This fails at comedy and drama.",4,12,24,13 November 2009
Shrek Forever After," All good things have to come to an end.
","I like Shrek 1 and 2, but part 3 was so annoyingly bland. But Shrek Forever After makes up for that, it had great animation, and a great story also.Shrek and Fiona are settling in family life with there three kids. But the stress of everyday family life begins to catch up with Shrek. And he begins to miss the old days. Ends up running into Rumplestillsken and makes a deal to have a day to himself, but Shrek quickly discovers that he signed his whole life away, and that Donkey, Puss N' Boots, and Fiona don't know him. And Shrek has a whole day to get his life back or he will be erased out existence.Mike Myers is always good, as the voice of the lovable but cantankerous ogre Shrek, Eddie Murphy Cameron Diaz and Antonio Banderas are good in there returning voices as Donkey, Fiona, and Puss N' Boots. And not mention Walt Dornm, Jon Hamm, Craig Robinson, and Jane Lynch, are memorable also. It's a shame that this is the final chapter, but I like I said all good things have to come to an end.",8,4,10,25 May 2010
Dunkirk," Christopher Nolan delivers another masterpiece.
","It's not a film about war, it's an experience, you just not watching the film about war, but you feel your in the war with the characters. At times it feels like three different movies about Dunkirk all spliced together, cause three story lines are very well depicted here. Characters are not to developed, but the film pulls no punches and gets right to the war, so it was meant to be more on experience and less on development. I like the idea it's less focused on gore, and more on action.Christopher Nolan once again proves what an awesome director he is, he wants the audience to really get a feel of the movie, basically what he does with all his movies. Actors are all really good here. War scenes show such realism and nothing glamorized about it all. I hope this film will nominated for an Oscar.",10,2,13,26 July 2017
The Machinist," Seeing isn't always believing
","A wonderful masterpiece of a movie, it just keeps you glued to your seat, has it just pulls you in. The movie takes a Alfred Hitchcock like turn to it. In the world of Trevor Reznik(Christian Bale) fear and paranoia take an interesting turn, has his life becomes a mixed up puzzle, he has not slept for a year, his health is fading(I mean he has a real skinny frame, he makes it frighting to look at him). But things begin to get scary when he keeps finding little notes on his fridge, and feels blamed for a co workers accident(Michael Ironside). And meets Ivan(John Sharian) a co worker everybody says is not real. Is Trevor losing his sanity, or is somebody playing bad tricks on him. Christian Bales best performance ever. He really tried to make himself in the role, by getting really I mean really skinny. The movie has great suspense. It was worth it.",9,1,3,12 June 2005
Bad Teacher," BAD is the only thing right in the title.
","I'm not against this type of story, but it throws everything at you, and comes across like it was trying too hard, makes the jokes feel very forced, and when it does that, the humor just dies down. Bridesmaids was a lot funnier, at least the jokes in that didn't come across like it was trying too hard.Liz(Cameron Diaz) a junior high school teacher, who does not want to be a teacher, but is because she has nothing else to go too. She shows her class movies, so she does not want to deal with them. Then a nerdy substitute teacher(Justin Timberlake) comes in the picture, who appears to have a lot of money, and Liz will do anything to land him, and does not care who she has to hurt.Cameron Diaz comes across like she trying to do Seth Rogen, but was not memorable, Cameron Diaz I think is a very talented versatile actress, but this was not her best work. I also hated the lack of creativity with the rest of the characters, Justin Timberlake is so null and void. I thought Diaz and Timberlake would have good chemistry,cause they used to date, but there scenes seemed awkward. Jason Segal, who I thought was gonna be the funniest one, but he was just as dull as Timberlake, probably all the comedy was sucked out of him, after coming off the set of How I Met Your Mother, if Bridesmaids is still out, go see that one instead.",2,16,30,6 July 2011
The Amazing Spider-Man," Truly Amazing
","I don't want to say that this was better than the 2002 Spider Man, I think they are both good in there own right, this film does things a little bit better than the first film, but both films where good in there way.Peter Parker(Andrew Garfield) a smart 19 year old, with a huge chip on his shoulder, who has a secret crush on Gwen Stacey(Emma Stone), lives with his Uncle Ben and Aunt May(Martin Sheen and Sally Field), still trying to figure out what happened to his parents, only to discover that his dad worked with Curt Conners(Rhys Ifans), while visiting his lab, is bitten by radioactive spider, and gains the powers of a spider. Okay there is so much more that I do not want to give away.Andrew Garfield was great as Peter Parker, I liked the way he does not try to be carbon copy of Tobey Mcguires Spider Man, but playing the part in his own way. Emma Stone was super charming as Gwen Stacey, she really brought a lot to the film, and she and Garfield have incredible chemistry. Martin Sheen and Sally Field are also great here. Not to mention Denis Leary and Rhys Ifans. And the effects don't disappoint either.",9,25,35,7 July 2012
The Lego Movie," For kids and adults
","A fun animated film with a simple title The Lego Movie. Makes you feel like you playing Lego's also, for adults who loved Lego's, it will make them feel like a kid again. The actors voices are perfect, I had a feel that they all had a blast working on this. The plot for the most part is like a parody of those Matrix films, but they use a lot of famous characters from other stuff also. It's not a total parody, there are moments that are pretty tender.So don't go in this movie expecting a lot, just go in and relax and have a wonderful time, at this awesome animated film. That will probably win an award for best animation or not. But still just have fun.",10,2,6,23 February 2014
Now You See Me," Ocean's 11 meets The Illusionist
","A group of magi cans(Jesse Eisenberg, Isla Fischer, Woody Harrelson, and Dave Franco) are pulled together to pull off a bunch different heists, not knowing who brought them all together to do this. Two FBI agents(Mark Ruffalo and Melanie Laurent) who are hot on there trail, will they be able stay two steps ahead of them? In the world of magic, nothing is what it seems.Everybody is pretty watchable, nobody really stands out. This movie has a lot of twists and turns, you just won't see coming, just when you think you know, it will throw you off completely. The magic scenes are pretty effective, it was quite dazzling. If you want to forget about The Incredible Burt Wordersone, then I believe Now You See Me will do that for you.",9,5,10,9 June 2013
X-Men: Days of Future Past," The X still marks the spot
","In 2023, giant robots called Sentinals rule the earth and when powerful mutant to battle with them, these giant robots prove to quite powerful, and the mutants are powerless, so Charles Xavier(Patrick Stewart) and the remaining X Men are last ones are the that remains, in hopes of saving the earth, they send Wolverine(Hugh Jackman) back to the year 1973, so he can prevent the disaster from happening, but will he? It's nice Bryan Singer return has director, and the ensemble cast don't disappoint either. It's proof the effects with X-Men films just keep getting better, and the effects here are no exception. The 70's look and future look are pretty awesome, and some action scenes are pretty good. It comes in close second to Captain America: Winter Soldier.",9,0,0,27 May 2014
Captain America: Civil War," Comes in close second to Winter Soldier
","It's a little better than Age of Ultron, But I liked it a little more than Batman V Superman. It seems to be the year of heroes vs heroes. I'm surprised it's not called Avengers: Civil War, instead of Captain America, cause like the Avengers it's pretty much a superhero ensemble.Performances by Robert Downey Jr and Chris Evans bring a sense of realism, what makes you understand both sides. Action scenes are special effects are incredibly good, seems to be topping themselves with each marvel film. Everybody else does well too. The battle scenes are quite epic, I mean this really delivers. Although Spider Man who is played by Tom Holland, don't get wrong he is good in the role, but he is brought in not for the sake of the story, but to introduce him in the marvel universe. I'm looking forward to seeing a new Spider Man movie.",10,5,12,7 May 2016
Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them," Alright but not Fantastic
","I'm gonna say I've never been a fan of Harry Potter, now don't get me wrong, I've watch the films and found them entertaining. I don't hate it, but don't love either. Now I was into this after seeing the trailer.Magic scenes are effective, reminds us why we loved Harry Potter, even though this is a prequel. Eddie Redmayne does have quite a boyish charm has the wizard Newt. Dan Fogler brings some memorable moments here, has a human who gets pulled in the magic world. He and Redmayne have such a Butch and Sundance like chemistry. Alison Sudol is also quite the scene stealer, has a happy go lucky wizard. Colin Farrell really gives his all here, I really don't want to spoil anything about his character. But everybody else seems so lifeless in there roles, Katherine Waterson always looks like she's gonna cry in every scene.At least in the Harry Potter movies I've seen, all the characters had some degree of life in there performances. I think I would have liked it more if the movie was more focused on Newt and the Beasts. The Beasts in this film where more watchable also, even though they where CGI. All in all not terrible, but not Fantastic. Hard core Harry Potter fans will probably wanna see this. But I could sit through Doctor Strange a million times more then Fantastic Beasts. Does not make me eager for the sequel.",7,4,8,21 November 2016
Saw III," the lowest of the low
","First of all I liked Saw and Saw 2, they both were intriguing, not just gory, it had a lot of mystery and twists and turns. Tobin Bell is always good as Jigsaw. But has the film went on, it just simply failed to capture the magic of the first two. It seemed to have a somewhat of a mystery, but it became seriously unwatchable. I was all hyped for this movie, even after last years Saw 2, I was expecting it to be even better.O'h boy was I wrong, this one was simply destined just gross people out. And deaths of people in this movie, that are not only disturbing but pointless. I won't say who, you'll half to see the movie and find out.

Emma is a doctor, and Adam is a script assistant for Glee like series. The pair decide to just have sex, and still remain friends, no romance. But will they hold up?Ashton Kutcher and Natalie Portman have good chemistry, but there performances are pretty weak in the first half, but they get better a little has it goes on. And when it comes to sex talk, it was not clever has it tried to be, it came off sounding more annoyingly awkward. Kevin Kline shines as Kutchers movie star, pot smoking father. But the film really does not quite take off has it should. Watch She's Out Of My League(2010) instead.",4,5,9,28 January 2011
Tropic Thunder," If you are in the mood for a fun action comedy, then Tropic Thunder will deliver for you.
","Tropic Thunder at times appears to go over the top, but it never gets boring or stupid. And it never becomes a one bad joke movie, it keeps coming up with something new each time. The actors appear to be having a fun making the film, I think director and star Ben Stiller lets his co stars addlibb. And Robert Downey Jr and Jack Black seem to roll with it so well. And begins with washed action star named Tugg Speedman, over the top Aussie actor Kirk Lazarus(Robert Downey Jr), and drug addled comic Jeff Portnoy(Jack Black) are on location filming a war called Tropic Thunder, but nothing is going right, the actors are not getting there scenes right, and the director(Steve Coogan) is growing frustrated, and the film is way behind. Until the films consultant(Nick Nolte) that in order to make it work, he'll half to put them in the real jungles with no set, make it has real as possible. And he soon does that, and rapper Alpa Chino(Brandon T. Jackson), and co star Kevin Sandusky(Jay Baruchel) are also along. But then a Vietnamese drug cartel discovers there they are there, and tries to kill them, but they think it's fake, will they ever find out it's not movie? An enjoyable comedy, everybody is great, but it's Robert Downey Jr in black makeup that pretty much steals the movie, watching him pretend is so hilarious, and Tom Cruise as a movie mogul, is also a scene stealer, with his funny lines that would make turn red with laughter. This movie was not meant to be offensive, has some may find it. It was meant to mock Hollywood, nothing more.",10,2,7,18 August 2008
Scott Pilgrim vs. the World," One entertaining ride
","Scott Pilgrim(Michael Cera) is a 22 year old slacker, who is in a band and lives with his gay roommate (Kieran Culkin),and life seems to be pretty predicable. Until he meets Ramona Flowers( Mary Elizabet Winstead from Sky High, Final Destination 3, and Live Free or Die Hard). Scott feels they could have something, but Ramona is unsure, but gives in and starts going out with Scott. But remember the saying your past comes back to haunt you, in Ramonas case comes in the form of seven evil exes with superhuman powers. In order to win Ramonas love Scott must defeat them, but the question is will he? Entertaining to say the least, Michael Cera is good, so is Mary Elizabeth Winstead. Co stars don't disappoint either, Chris Evans, Brandon Routh, Mae Whitman(Hope Floats), Alison Pill, Anna Kendrick(Up in the Air), and Kieran Culkin. The video game effects are also awesome. Scott Pilgrim vs the World is one entertaining ride.",8,38,80,18 August 2010
Inside Out," Herman's Head meets Wreck-It Ralph
","I think the screenwriter of this got inspired off of the 90's sitcom Herman's Head(1991-1994), I mean the similarities are there, but this movie is more kid friendly, where Herman's Head was more for adults.I gotta say the animation is beyond terrific, I don't know but I'll bet it took a while, but it was worth it. And the voice acting is great also, I mean if you don't find the right voices, it's not gonna work, but they did find the right voices of these characters, the actors really bring them to life. This movie makes us think about the different emotions that go inside our heads. And the character traits of the voices, and what goes in the deepest part of our minds. It's an enjoyable film for the whole family.",10,25,66,22 June 2015
Yesterday," An entertaining What If
","Jack(Himesh Patel) is trying to make it has a musician, one night the world has a quick black out, and he is hit by a bus, when he comes out of it, he discovers things are not what it seems, when he sings a Beatles song to his friends, he is shocked to find that they don't know who The Beatles are, but when Jack looks up The Beatles on the computer, is totally surprised to find they never happened. Now Jack uses there songs to gain success, but will it be worth it?
I liked the way the movie never explains itself, but instead tries to let the audience to figure it out, like a Twilight Zone episode. Himesh Patel is charming and you feel for his character, and has a pretty good singing voice. The music is pretty good also. Lily James is great in her supporting role as Jacks devoted friend and supposed love interest. Kate McKinnon is good, not playing it has funny, but playing with a crazy cold eye stare has Jacks manager.",9,1,1,31 December 2019

The best of all marvel movies, everybody gives a great performance, in my opinion nobody really stands out. It's a three hour film, but sure doesn't feel like it, so well paced. Effects are excellent, also don't disappoint. For all Marvel fans, please don't miss this.",10,121,228,29 April 2019
Quantum of Solace," This James Bond really works.
","Casino Royale was alright, but it's nothing compared to Quantum of Solace. This movie for me, made up for Casino Royale mistakes.It starts up where Casino Royale left off. Where Bond is bent on revenge for the death of his loved one. He is tracking down and spying on evil business man named Dominic Greene(Mathieu Amarlric),but then the stakes quickly get too high when Greene discovers his existence, and puts a bounty out on Bond's head. But Bond ends saving Camille(Olga Kurylenko, Hit Man, Max Payne) a former employee of Greenes. But will she help him or betray him? This was the best Bond since whenever. The action was great, almost like The Bourne Identity. And unlike the other Bond flicks, there was no element of fantasy to it. The action was real, the villains are real, everything. I like Daniel Craig portrayal as Bond, not always suave, but clumsy and vulnerable at times. The most believable performance as James Bond in a while. Keep it up Daniel.",10,6,13,19 November 2008
The Hobbit: The Desolation of Smaug," Has awesome as the first
","The journey of the dwarfs and Bilbo continues, as they survive attacks and being captured and escaping, has they almost make it there destiny, but the question is will they make it, or will they fail? I liked it more than the first one, it never gets boring, even though it's 3 hours long, but it manages not to feel it, cause it is very well paced. The characters are also memorable, nobody really stands out. The effects are beyond terrific, it never looks phony for a second. If you liked the other Lord of the Rings movies, then I have a feeling you'll love this film, but if not you'll probably stay away. I thought it was great.",10,1,6,27 December 2013
Toy Story 4," The gangs all here
","I was surprised by this 4th installment, the way Toy Story 3 ended I felt it was a great conclussion. But somebody felt there where more stories to tell. But I'm glad they did, cause I really enjoyed this one, has good has the first three. A great story to tell, and the animation is even greater.
Tom Hanks and Tim Allen really get back has the voices of Buzz and Woody perfectly, has well the other gang. Keanu Reeves steals most of the movie has the voice of the daredevil toy Duke Caboom. I also like the way it never really ends the way you think it will. Just a fun adventure for the whole family. The way it ended it didn't leave much open for another Toy Story film, but if they do I might check it out.",10,87,164,26 June 2019
Batman Begins," The best Batman movie so far.
","I liked the first Michael Keaton one, and Batman Forever with Val Kilmer. I'm really wish to forget Batman Returns and Batman and Robin with George Clooney. But this Batman is different. It shows Bruce Wayne is trying to cope with the murder of his parents. It is just not a superhero film, but a film about a man trying to fight his fears and his demons. The beginning of how Bruce Wayne became Batman. It is very well directed by Christopher Nolan(Memento,Insomnia), he really knew how shape every moment of the story. Christian Bale was perfectly cast as Bruce Wayne/Batman, He got back in shape after The Machnist, thank goodness. Katie Holmes was also good, she is making up for last years First Daughter. Now I can't wait for the sequel.",10,0,1,3 July 2005

One day Bellas fate changes when she almost dies in a automobile accident, but is saved by Edward. But the questions begin to come like, how did Edward get to her so fast, it's like he is as fast as a cheetah. And how did he stop the truck with one hand, it's like he has the strength of ten men. When she tries to talk to Edward, he tries his best to dance around those questions. After doing a lot of investigating, like why he is so pale, and why he needs his skin need to be cool, the conclusion is he is a vampire. But she is still not afraid of him, and the two start falling in love. But will Bellas love for Edward be dangerous for her? A great film, Kristen Stewart has grown into her own since playing Jodie Fosters daughter in Panic Room(2002), and she and Robert Pattinson have such beautiful chemistry, you really believe that there in love. not to mention it also had dazzling effects. I wouldn't compare it Ann Rice novels, Twlight comes in its own. It was very well directed by Catherine Hardwicke, the direction was not sloppy for a second. I really enjoyed it, so go see it, you won't be disappointed.",8,3,15,22 November 2008

Ralph has grown quite weary from being the bad guy,tired of being the outcast, he wants to be admired, and liked by others, so Ralph leaves his game, and ventures into other game world, but how will Ralph come out in the end? John C. Reilly, Jane Lynch, Jack McBrayer, and Sarah Silverman, are some of the best voice acting I've heard in years, the really made these characters come too life. This also had some of the best animation I've seen in years. I think Wreck-It Ralph tops all the pixar animated films that came before it. You will not be disappointed.",10,3,3,5 November 2012

Tells the story of people living in Rome, and there day to day funny adventure and misadventure.Like in Midnight In Paris, Woody Allen makes the audience feel like there in Rome, it's like he is giving us a tour. And the cast don't disappoint either, each one with there own story line. Alec Baldwin, Penelope Cruz, Greta Gerwig, Ellen Page, Jesse Eisenberg to name a few. And Woody Allen himself as writer, director and actor is awesome. If your looking for a movie to help you forget about your problems, then give the very funny To Rome With Love a look.",9,5,11,21 July 2012

Bilbo is reluctant at first, but goes along anyway. Although some of the dwarfs don't want him along. Will Bilbo win them over? Martin Freeman is too perfect has Bilbo Baggins, he just really gets into the role. Ian Mckellan is always great as Gandalf, I'm so glad he returned. The guys playing the dwarfs are also good. Peter Jacksons direction is quite brilliant. The effects are terrific and never a distraction. I was entertained by The Lord Of The Rings films, but I never was big fan, and the same is said about The Hobbit.",10,6,18,26 December 2012

Bill struggles to find out who it is before it's too late, while the passengers don't if Bill is the good guy or the bad guy?Pretty good thriller, which becomes a who dun it, and it will keep you guessing till the end. Liam Neeson is great, really giving a good performance, and not just playing it has a typical action hero. Julianne Moore is also good, making a miner character watchable. The actors playing the passengers are also great, they bring a sense of reality to it. Made me forget about Taken 2.",9,2,5,21 March 2014
Mission: Impossible - Ghost Protocol," This one takes the cake
","I Llked mission Impossible 1 and 2, but 3 not as much has 1 and 2. But this one I think out does them all. The action has never more intense, the characters all shine, and it has a great sense of humor.Ethan Hunt and IMF team(Paula Patton and Simon Pegg) are framed for blowing up the Kremlin. They all go on the run, with Analyst Brett(Jeremy Renner) coming along for the ride. They all must go undercover, and prove there innocents, and hopes of preventing another disaster. Before it all comes crashing down on them all.Brad Bird who is known for directing such animated films like The Iron Giant(1999), and The Incredibles(2004), really does well, when it comes to directing the action. Tom Cruise is good here too, but I like the way it never becomes like a Tom Cruise vehicle, cause everybody gets there chance to shine, Cruise never hogs the spotlight too much. Paula Patton and Smon Pegg shine quite perfectly in there roles, so does Jeremy Renner. And the action is far more intense than ever. you'll get your moneys worth.",9,3,9,30 December 2011
Rise of the Planet of the Apes," Going Ape.
","I'm glad that the apes are CGI, and not actors in ape makeup. A nice reboot to the franchise, it makes for the lazy Planet of The Apes(2001), don't get me wrong the makeup was awesome, but the characters and effects where so null and void.The story of a scientist(James Franco), who is trying to make a serum for his terminally ill father(John Lithgow), and anybody else who is sick. He tries it on apes, and one of his subjects goes awry, and his killed. But quickly discover a baby monkey after wards. He takes it home and raises it, and they name it Ceaser. When he grows up(Andy Serkis), his intelligent goes higher to the max. And when Ceaser is captured and put with other apes, will his intelligent become there savior?Andy Serkis is good has Ceaser, he brings that motion capture ape to life. The effects where incredible. You really feel for the apes for the most part. James Franco and John Lithgow where also good. This makes for the 2001 version.",10,1,2,8 August 2011

This film is what Marvel fans have been waiting for, most all the characters from the marvel universe in one film is a big treat, and the Thanos character is very menacing, and there toughest opponent, but I like the way he was portrayed has not just a one noted character, and CGI did not look fake. Everybody who has a little story of there own here, and they all play there parts well, you really invested in there plots. Action scenes are quite well shot. Keeps me with excitement for what new Marvel project coming next.",10,3,8,30 April 2018
Once Upon a Time... in Hollywood," An awesome look at Hollywood in 1969
","Set in Hollywood in 1969, once great star Rick Dalton(Leonardo DiCaprio) feels he is now has been, cause good roles are not coming his way, stuck doing minor roles in TV shows, his comfort is his stunt double and good friend Cliff Booth(Brad Pitt), who sticks by him through out, but in Hollywood not everything is all glamour.
Quentin Tarantino has done it again, with his incredible directing and storytelling, and the way he makes the scenery of 1969 become a character itself. Leonardo DiCaprio and Robert Redford really have a good Paul Newman and Robert Redford like chemistry to there characters, you instantly buy there history and friendship. Margot Robbie does shine as Sharon Tate, even though she has little bit to do, she comes through when she comes on screen. If you are expecting this film to be accurate of how certain events took place in that decade, you gotta to know that Tarantino likes to play fast and loose with that, and I'm glad cause it kept me on the edge of my seat. Nicohlas Hammond(The Sound of Music, Spider-Man) does chew up the scenery in a cameo has director Sam Wannamaker. R.I.P. Luke Perry who also makes a cameo. My only complaint is there a sub plot about Brad Pitts character, that never really gets answered, maybe that was the point, but that is minor. I still liked it, it's a great homage to Hollywood in 1969.",10,49,76,30 July 2019

So what is really happening, and how will it all unravel? A solid movie, that really keeps you glued, it throws you off completely, every time, you think you know how it's going to end. Ben Affleck and Rosamund Pike give descent performances, so does the rest of the cast like Tyler Perry and Neil Patrick Harris. A great film that I would not sit through again, Gone Girl is one of those movies for me to sit through one time.",10,1,8,24 October 2014
Get Out," Guess Who's Coming to Dinner meets The Twilight Zone
","Jordan Peele proves he's more than just a comedian, that he is an exceptional writer and director. And Get Out is proof of that, it really pulls out all the stops of a great thriller, keeps you shaking through out. After Get Out I believe Jordan Peele will become a sought after writer/director.Chris(Daniel Kaluuya) a young African American goes with his white girlfriend named Rose(Allison Williams) to meet her parents(Bradley Whitford and Catherine Keener) in there hometown, and once they finally get there things start taking a turn for the weird, believe me that is far has I should go.You'll feel like the main character, that where you are, feeling like things are not what they seem. The Creepiness just creeps up on you. Daniel Kaluuya is great, so is Allison Williams. Catherine Keener is awesome, so is Bradley Whitford, looking like Michael Gross from Family Ties. We'll done directional debut for Jordan Peele.",10,7,17,4 March 2017
Drive," It's no Transporter rip-off.
","You may s think by the title Drive, that this be another Transporter, but once you start to watch it comparsions with it, will go out the window.The story begins with a character called The Driver(Ryan Gosling), who by day is a professional movie stunt driver, but by night, he works as a getaway driver for criminals. But then things an interesting turn when he gets involved with a woman(Carey Mulligan) and her son. But then his mechanic friend(Bryan Cranston) gets mixed up with some shady people, played by Ron Perlman and Albert Brooks.If you go expecting another Transporter, trust me don't be expecting that, instead go expecting a kind of Taxi Driver(1976) meets Man On Fire(2004). A very well down suspenseful thriller,, each moment really keeps you on edge. Ryan Gosling was great, not playing his part as one noted, unlike George Clooney in The American. Bryan Cranson was good, so was Albert Brooks and Ron Perlman.",8,1,4,25 September 2011
Aladdin," Will Smith steals it, once he comes in the picture.
","I can't really comment on the original animated Disney film Aladdin(1992), in which the genie was voiced by the late great Robin Williams. Now Will Smith is no Robin Williams, but does bring his own comedic charm to the role.
Will Smith does steal the film every time he's on camera, not that Mena Massoud who plays Aladdin, and Naomi Scott who plays The Princess do get there moments also, and have very good chemistry when they are on film together. A fun magical ride for the whole family to enjoy.",10,4,11,27 May 2019

So her younger tries to find her, and hopes to help her make it summer again? Perfectly well animated, although for some parts the musical part of the film fell short at times. But I liked the characters nobody really stands, but the funny snowman named Olaf steals a good portion of the scenes he is in. The snow effects are pretty dazzling. It's a fun film to enjoy for the holidays.",9,1,3,9 December 2013
2012," Midly Entertaining Disaster Flick
","You used to think, if you seen one disaster flick, you've seen them all, but you'll discover you really haven't.The movie is about a global cataclysm in 2012, where the earth is slowly destroying itself. Jackson(John Cusack) struggles to save his ex-wife (Amanda Peet), there two kids and her new boyfriend, and get them to safety. While the people in the White House(Danny Glover, Thandie Newton, Oliver Platt, and Chiwetel Ejiofor, from Talk To Me) are having there own struggle dealing with it.From director Roland Emmerich, who brought you such epic classics like Stargate(1994), Indepence Day(1996), and The Day After Tommorow(2004). He also did such cinematic travesties known as Godzilla(1998), and 10.000 B.C.(2008). John Cusack and Amanda Peet gave really weak performances, they just did not come off as people believing that this is really happening. Now Glover,Newton,Platt, and Ejiofor gave real Oscar worthy performances. Now the effects where cool for one part,but for the other they looked too cartooned and over the top.This movie is a reminder that this could happen, and teaches us to have faith in GOD",7,0,1,23 November 2009

So for fans enjoy the ride.",10,4,10,20 February 2007
X-Men: The Last Stand," Truly eXcellent
","The X-Men films keep surpassing themselves each time, I did not like the first one to much, cause I felt it was to cheaply done, the only thing that made that movie a hit was Hugh Jackman as Wolverine. But X2 was incredible awesome it had more effects, and action that made evan put the first one in its place. Now it's X-men 3. The story takes place about a month or two after part 2 left off. Wolverine(Hugh Jackman) and Storm(Halle Berry) train young mutants for there chance to become X-Men. But then the president has announced that there is a cure for mutants. The source behind the cure is a young boy.

","I'll be honest, never really saw the animated film which came out in 1994. But decided to give this one a look, and boy am I glad I did. Really enjoyed the scenes with Simba and Mufasa, great bonding between father and son.
Scenes with the animals are great, so was the voice acting, namely James Earl and Seth Rogen to name a few. And also very well directed by Jon Favreau, who also directed The Jungle Book. If you loved the original 1994 film, then give this film a look, you might like it.",10,4,18,22 July 2019
The Incredibles," Take THE SIMPONS and X-MEN , put them both in a blender, and five minutes later you get THE INCREDIBLES.

","A husband(John Krasinski) and his wife(Emily Blunt) and there children end up living in isolation, when the world is invaded by aliens who only attack by the loud sounds people make, so the family have to live day by day not talking but signing, but will they make it through?This feels like everything that the movie Signs(2002) tried to be, which is a good suspenseful sci-fi thriller, I mean Signs was okay, but A Quiet Place knocks it down by a long shot. Krasinski and Blunt really play off each other very well. cause they are married in real life makes there chemistry work. The kids playing there children are also good. The scenes with the aliens is quite filled with edge of your seat scares. You the audience feel that you are in isolation with the family, and also able to give a good performance by saying very little and with facial expressions.",10,2,7,12 April 2018
The Bourne Legacy," Feels like a Matt Damon film, but without Matt Damon.
","I guess it does make sense, Jason Bourne could not have been the only one, there where many. With Matt Damon gone from the role, the studio decided to write a new character, who was part of the same program has Jason Bourne, and put him in a similar predicament.Now action scenes do not disappoint, and Jeremy Renner is a perfect choice to replace Matt Damon, Renner has proved to be good actor, has well as a awesome action star, and is solid in the role, so is Rachel Weisz has the doctor he is helping. And Edward Norton and Stacy Keach are also solid in there roles has head of the agency that is hunting them.The problem here is, that it focus's more on the agency and the people hunting them, then on it's main star, like Jeremy Renner is co starring in his own movie. It makes to many reference to Jason Bourne, to the point I was wondering when he was gonna pop up. Although not terrible but not has memorable has the other Bourne films.",7,8,13,15 August 2012

Ice Cube really shines with his funny moments. It does have some good action scenes, It is a spoof of the 1987 show, but becomes a reminder that they don't make has many action comedies like this anymore. Like the first one just go in expecting to be entertained, nothing more, nothing less.",8,2,6,21 June 2014

So is Martin going nuts, or is there a conspiracy going on here? A very solid thriller, that is intense has it goes on, keeps building to an awesome climax. Performances by Liam Neeson, Diane Kruger, January Jones and Aiden Quinn don't disappoint. If you are looking for a thriller that tops Taken(2008) a little, then give Unknown a look.",10,8,18,21 February 2011
X-Men: Apocalypse," Nowhere near as good has First Class and Days of Future Past, but still entertaining.
","Apocalypse who was the first mutant ever, is from the Egyptian days. Awakens in 1983, he is more powerful than ever, and puts together his own band of mutants in hopes of world domination. It's up too Charles Xavier(James McAvoy) and his band of young mutants in hopes of stopping him.The well known characters like Cyclops and Havok and not to mention Beast don't really stand out as much they should. McAvoy is okay as Professor X, but it's Michael Fassbender as Magneto, that really takes the film, showing more Lars to the character, I was really liking his story arch. Jennifer Lawrence is alright here as Mystique. But Oscar Isaac has Apocalypse is creepy but no so much menacing, the animated Apocalypse was way more menacing. The effects are pretty descent, battle scenes enjoyable. I wonder there gonna be any more X-Men films, for me it ends with me not wanting anymore.",8,16,25,7 June 2016
The Amazing Spider-Man 2," Amusing, but not as good has the first one.
","Two years later, Peter Parker(Andrew Garfield) is enjoying life as the web slinging wall crawling crime fighter Spider Man, and is dating the love of his love Gwen Stacy(Emma Stone), but then Peter starts to remember the promise he to Captain Stacy before he died, to stay away from Gwen so he would not put her in danger, mean while some new villains are looking to destroy Spider Man.The villains I did not feel where used to there potential, I mean they are just there nothing more, Dane Dehaan and Jamie Fox are okay in there roles. And action scenes are alright not great, so where the effects. But the scenes with Andrew Garfield and Emma Stone are enjoyable, there scenes together really work, cause they have such great chemistry. Like I said Amusing.",7,0,4,7 May 2014
Fantastic 4: Rise of the Silver Surfer," More enjoyable then Spider Man 3
","The Fabe four(Jessica Alba, Ioan Grufford, Michael Chiklis, and Chris Evans) return in this entertaining sequel. The up coming wedding to Sue Storm and Reed Richards is interrupted by an alien being known as the Silver Surfer. But when Johnny flies up to it, he is soon grabbed by the surfer. and when the rest of the team members touch him he switches powers with them. But when they learn the every time the Silver surfer passes through a planet after next, eight days later the planet gets destroyed. It is up The Fantastic Four to get to bottom of this before it is too late. This was a good live action comic book movie. The performances and the effects never seem to wear themselves thin. If they do a third one, I hope it will be the charm .",8,1,3,23 February 2008
Hidden Figures," Well made historical film.
","Based on true events, the film takes place in 1961 and three African American woman, Katherine(Taraji P. Henson) Dorothy(Octavia Spencer) and Mary(Janelle Monae) who all go to work for NASA in the beginning of the space program, when they are trying to get a man in space. The woman are all very smart, but struggle to deal with racism and sexism.A very well made true story, now I'm sure that some things where creative for the film. I liked the 60's setting, Henson, Devine, and Monae all give great Oscar worthy performances. Kevin Costner really shows his strong commanding presence in the film, he is so good you feel he is your boss. Jim Parsons(The Big Bang Theory) is alright, does not get much to do. Kirsten Dunst is also quite impressive. I also liked to watch the beginning of the space program.",10,19,44,13 January 2017
Lincoln," Daniel Day Lewis becomes Lincoln
","I thought going into this movie, that it was going to be bio about Lincoln, but it was not quite that at all, Lincoln was a big part of it, but it's more his team, and all the supportive characters seem to have there chance to shine. But it was still a great film regardless.President Lincoln(Daniel Day Lewis) struggles to end slavery, during the Civil War, with the help of his main crew, he hopes too win in the end, but will he? And his Marriage to Mary Todd(Sally Field) is on the rocks a little, and his son Robert(Joesph Gordon Levitt) wants to fight in the war.My biggest problem with this film is that Joesph Gordon Levitt was not giving much too do here. Maybe he had a bigger part, but I think his part was toned down, in order to make the film not has long. But still a good film, brilliantly directed by Steven Spielberg, well acted by Daniel Day Lewis, he really gets in the role to the point, you'll forget he's British. Tommy Lee Jones is also good, a scene stealer in spots. Sally Field is also good as Lincolns suffering wife, a possibly Oscar nomination. This film has a great 1865 setting. Although i thought the film was great, it should have been titled something else.",9,2,10,23 November 2012
Big Hero 6," The best animation since Wreck It Ralph
","Story is about a bunch of young college students who are really smart in building things in advancement, decide to become superheroes to stop a super-powered madman from doing serious damage, but the problem is what they have in smarts, they lack in being heroes, will they pull it together and save the day before it's too late? Great animation, a Japan Marvel comic comes alive, It felt like I was a bunch of Iron Man wannabes, all the actors voice there characters well, and the effects are awesome, It's right up there with Wreck It Ralph, each character has there own personality. The best superhero team since The Avengers, I'm really hoping for a sequel, it ends with you wanting more.",10,10,30,11 November 2014
Star Wars: Episode VIII - The Last Jedi," Luke Skywalker returns
","I liked The Force Awakens although I felt it was made for the Star Wars fan only, but after I was eagerly awaiting for came next, this is the first time where a Star Wars takes place shortly after the last story, like The Force Awakens and The Last Jedi where filmed back to back.. Also eagerly waiting to see Mark Hamill return has the Iconic character Luke Skywalker, and does not disappoint.And another iconic Star Wars character makes an appearance, I won't say who. Mark Hamill gives an incredible performance has Luke Skywalker, has an older and broken down Jedi. The late Great Carrie Fisher really shines has Leia, in one scene has a force moment that will make go WOW. Daisy Ridley is great as Rey, so was John Boyega as Finn. But Adam Driver really takes the cake a Kylo Renn/Ben Solo, playing it has very torn conflicted. Writer and Director Rian Johnson shows his love for Star Wars here, but does not try to make it to fan based, it's not predicable or clichÃ©d like you expect a Star Wars film to be, it will surprise you. Battle scenes are more epic than ever.",10,2,22,20 December 2017
Brave," Pixar delivers another classic.
","Medira(Kelly MacDonald) loves adventure, and is awesome at archery. But because of her controlling mother the queen(Emma Thompson), she arranged to be somebodies queen, but Medira wants to break that tradition, with little help from her bumbling father the king(Billy Connelly), will Medira ever find her independence? There is a lot more of the plot that I do not want to giveaway, because I want you to see it. The animation is spot on in details, like the setting, and the characters. Awesome voice acting, by Kelly Macdonald, Emma Thompsan, and Billy Connelly, who mostly provides the laughs, along with the animated three triplet boys. It's for kids over 12 years old.",10,2,6,25 June 2012
Guardians of the Galaxy," It does not quite top Captain America:The Winter Soldier, but still an entertaining film.

Everybody seems comfortable in there roles, and it seems to be having a good time. The chemistry between the actors is a joy, so was the action, the effects, and everything else that came with it. If you are in the mood for a fun space adventure, then give Guardians of the Galaxy a look.",8,1,3,11 August 2014
Here Comes the Boom," Makes Welcome Back, Kotter look like Rocky
","Eric Voss(Kevin James) an overly laid back high school teacher, who is trying to win the heart of the school nurse(Salma Hayek), but his friend the music teacher(Henry Winkler) is about to lose his job, due to the schools budget. But Eric does not want to sit back and do nothing, comes up with an idea, while watching a UFC fight, discovers the loser of the fight got a lot of money, so he decides to do it, in hopes that it will save his friends job, he gets the help of a trainer. But will Eric make it through in the end? A well made film, it is funny as well as heartwarming. Kevin James is charming as always, he really trained hard for this movie, and it really shows. The UFC fight scene are perfectly well filmed. Salma Hayek and Henry Winkler are also memorable also. So if your in for a movie that will make you want to cheer, then Here Comes The Broom is that movie for you.",9,6,12,14 October 2012
Clash of the Titans," Although the special effects where incredible , it just didn't measure up the original.
","Now I loved the original Clash of the Titans(1981), that starred Harry Hamlin, Burgess Meredith, Laurence Olivier, Maggie Smith and Judi Bowker. I didn't think this timeless classic needed to be remade, but some producers did not share my way of thinking.Sam Worthington who seems to be in a lot of films with effects like Terminator Salvation and Avatar, plays Perseus, unlike Harry Hamlin, never really sticks out as a character, he's so bland and never really makes an impression, And so goes with the other characters, like Andromeda(Alexa Davalos) who had a big part in the original, which was played Judi Bowker, but in this version, she was downsized. I loved some characters like Io(Gemma Arterton, who you may remember from Quantum of Solice(2008) is quite memorable in her role.But I loved the effects, they where incredible. But the original was better paced, it never seemed to rush itself. Which this version seems to do. Although I was mildly amused by this one, I prefer the original.",5,1,4,2 April 2010
Jurassic World," Holds a candle to the first one.
","I loved the first Jurassic Park(1993), and didn't think the second film was bad, but can't really comment on the third film, cause I didn't see it. Now it's 22 years later, and Jurassic Park has become Jurassic World, a Disney world like theme park.Jurassic World is quite the success, until they combined the DNA of two dinosaurs, and make a new one. What will come from this creation? Chris Pratt is pretty enjoyable, almost liked what he played in Guardians of the Galaxy(2014) except he never goes to over the top, he and Bryce Dallas Howard surprisingly good in there scenes together. I think Bryce Dallas Howard is a talented actress, regardless what some critics say. The dinosaur scenes are pretty effective, really keep you on the edge of your seat. It does pay homage to the first Jurassic Park, but at the same time it stands on it's own. If you are a dinosaur lover, then Jurassic World is that film for you.",9,27,66,15 June 2015

But some mysterious figures capture David, they tell him, that they are controllers of fate, and say he can't see Elise again. But will David obey or defy them? Matt Damon and Emily Blunt are perfectly put together, as the forbidden lovers, they are so convincing, you instantly buy it. The rest of the cast are also good, so is Terrance Stamp. A well put together suspenseful supernatural love story. It's right up there with Inception.",10,4,6,11 March 2011
Black Snake Moan," A little disturbing, but a great film none the less.
","A film like this can really open your eyes, at times it makes you want to leave, but you don't cause you want to see what happens next. The movie begins with Rae(Christina Ricci), a sex addicted young women, Who is trying to resist that lifestyle, but when her boyfriend Ronnie(Justin Timerlake) has to leave for a tour of duty, temptation is not far from her. Then one night she is high on drugs, beaten and left for dead. She is found the next morning by Lazarus(Samuel L. Jackson) a preacher and blues-man, who has is own troubles. Has Lazarus tries to nurse her back to health, but then he sees her troubles. He decides to chain her up in his house, in hopes to cure her of addictions. Samuel L. Jackson and Christina Ricci have amazing chemistry, and give great performances. But my hats off to Christina Ricci for playing a character with such vulnerability. It took a lot of guts. I wouldn't think Kirsten Dunst would even be believably, if she were in the role. Justin Timberlake was surprisingly good in his role has Riccis troubled boyfriend. Kim Richards(Tuff Turf) is great in her brief appearance.",9,3,7,11 March 2007
The Hangover Part II," Feels less like a sequel, and more like a remake.
","Stu(Ed Helms) is getting married, and travels to Thailand for his big day. And Phil(Bradley Cooper), Doug(Justin Barta), and the man child named Alan(Zach Galifianakis), are his grooms man. Two days they decide to have a male bonding night, and they take Teddy(Mason Lee) along, who is the brides younger brother. But it then becomes a repeat of happened in Vegas, cause Phil, Alan, and Stu wake up in Bangkok, and not knowing how they got there, to make matters worse, they lost Teddy. They try to trace there steps, and find Teddy, but misadventure quickly ensue. Will they ever find Teddy, before it's late? It never tries to be different, despite some little differences, it's pretty much a rehash of the original. But it was still funny as ever. Bradley Cooper, Zach Galifianakis, and Ed Helms just keep you rolling in your seat, so does Ken Jeong as Mr. Chow. This film really raises the bar of raunchy humor, but unlike Your Highness, The Hangover part 2 gives you time to breath between it all. But if you are easily offended, you should not see this movie.",8,0,4,28 May 2011
Logan," Time to hang up the claws.
","If you thought last years Deadpool was violent, then you'll know what to expect going into Logan. This films holds nothing back, It's brutal. Hugh Jackman will be hanging the claws up after this, it's a shame cause he made the character of Wolverine/Logan his own, playing a brash hero with a heart of gold. And the last Patrick Stewart will be playing Professor Charles Xavier, nothing against James McAvoy who plays young Xavier in the prequels, but I'd prefer Stewart.I really like the way Jackman plays Logan here, looking like he's 60 years old, and his advanced healing isn't working to well. Jackmans performance here is what makes Logan very human. And Patrick Stewart showing Charles Xavier age catching up on him. There probably gonna continue the X-Men story but without Stewart and Jackman probably. I don't it was has good has X2, First Class, and Days of Future Pasts, but still pretty good in it's own right.",9,0,3,5 March 2017

It's almost has good as the first film, action scenes are awesome, I mean epic. All the characters have more to give here instead of being superheroes, you see a bit of humanity here. James Spader is great has Ultron, he gives the character such a joyful creepy charm. Elizabeth Olsen and Aaron Taylor Johnson always bring some awesomeness as Scarlet Witch and Quicksilver. It just keeps me hyped for the next Marvel Chapter.",9,0,3,3 May 2015

Then a human named Jonathan(Andy Samburg) a go with the flow kind of guy, finds the hotel, and walks in. But Dracula finds him, and passes him off as monster. But what happens when Mavis and Jonathan start having feelings for each other? Quite an enjoyable film, a good monster comedy for Halloween time. Also a great voice cast like Kevin James, Steve Buschemi, David Spade, and Molly Shannon to name some others. I have not quite forgiving Adam Sandler and Andy Samburg for the cinematic travesty that was That's My Boy, but Hotel Transylvania is a step. And the animation is good too.",8,3,6,8 October 2012
The Dark Knight," It's Heath Ledger as The Joker, that really makes this movie a masterpiece.
","I know the joker is a comic book villain, but Heath Ledger played with it with same amount of creepiness that Anthony Hopkins did with Hannibal Lecter in The Silence Of The Lambs. Ledger really stole this movie from everybody, he even tops Jack Nicholson from the 1989 movie. His performance is enough to gave kids under 10 nightmares. Christian Bale give quite a humanity performance as Bruce Wayne/Batman, so does Gary Oldman as Lt. Gordon. Aaron Eckhart is also quite appealing as Harvey Dent, so is Maggie Gyllenhaal as Rachel Dawes(replacing Katie Holmes), And Michael Caine and Morgan Freeman are also great. The action scenes will have you on the edge of your seat, and it surpasses Batman Begins(2005). My hats off too director Christopher Nolan, cause he took a comic book story, and made it very gritty and real, and it proves to be more then just a superhero movie. But Heath Ledger as The Joker, is really what kept this movie on it's toes, He was really great, I hope he get's nominated. It's a real shame that Heath Ledger is not here to enjoy the success of it. He died in January at the 28, it is a real tragic loss, he was such a great actor, it's sad that his life was short, but he made quite an impact on the Hollywood scene, this film is the best way we can remember Heath Ledgers talent. We'll always remember you Heath Ledger 1979-2008.",10,1,4,23 July 2008
War Machine," Entertaining part drama, part satire..
","Brad Pitt really gives a good performance as Gen, Glen McMahon, someone who wants to make a difference in Afghanistan, with some troops. But is suddenly gets heckled by the press cause they just don't what his actions are for.Brad Pitt gives a satirical performance in parts, does a lot of face acting, although he never goes too over the top. And the setting also plays a character too. Parts when it's funny, it's quite funny. But when it's dramatic, it's quite dramatic. Blends satire, and sad realism quite perfectly. The rest of the cast are also good. The movie does deliver the message of war quite beautifully, you can see Brad Pitt felt very strongly about this, and it really shows.",9,3,8,31 May 2017

His only hope if he can be cured if he can get to Elysium, and has an exoskeleton suit put on him that makes him a little stronger. But will make it before it's too late?The futuristic scenery is well done, Neil Blomkamp who directed District 9(2009), really goes all out here. Matt Damon is effective as Max, you're not sure what to feel for him at times. Jodie Foster is really unlikable has the evil counsel woman who runs Elysium, and Shartlo Copely really steals the movie as Kruger, Fosters crazy right hand man. It has great drama and great action. It basically makes us want to take a look at ourselves as a society.",9,0,3,16 August 2013
Alice in Wonderland," From the mind of Tim Burton.

Now 13 years later, and Alice(Mia Wasikowska) a beautiful mature young woman, falls again in that same hole, and meets up The Mad Hatter(Johnny Depp), some talking animals, the evil Red Queen(Helen Bonham Carter), and The White Queen(Anne Hathaway).Tim Burton brings an old tale, and gives it a retelling, mixed with a sequel. And it was quite visionary stunning, the way Tim Burton knows how to direct it. The special effects are just incredibly good. And the performances of Depp, Wasikowska, and Hathaway are amusing. But Carters character I felt could have used more work. But still an entertaining film.",8,2,4,8 March 2010

Sam Worthington who stole last years Terminator Salvation from a cranky Christian Bale, really does well here. So does Zoe Saldana and Sigourney Weaver. A great comeback for James Cameron.",10,8,11,29 December 2009
Grindhouse," Quentin Tarantino and Robert Rodriguez bring back the 1970's
","The Grindhouse has everything, even phony trailers. Both directors bring back the movies of yesterday, those movies were so bad, they were good in the 70's. Robert Rodriguguez tale named Planet Terror is a mixture of films like Invasion Of The Body Snacters and Night Of The Living Dead, and it also has a little of director John Carpenter style of movie making. Rose McGowan was great as Cherry Darling, so was Marley Shelton(Bubble Boy, Valentine) as Dakota. Josh Brolin must have channeling Nick Nolte while playing this role as a doctor, but he was good none the less. And it is very violent like a 70's movie is.Then there is Quentin Taratinos tale named Death Proof, a film that makes us remember those suspenseful car chase thrillers such as Duel(1971) and Mad Max(1979), Kurt Russell is great as stuntman Mike, who drives a death proof car, and gets his thrills running people off the road. Quentin Taratino has been know to dish out incredible dialog, and create amusing characters. He never seems to out do due himself, and neither does Robert Rodriguez. These films have action, humor, and violence. But these two directors delivered it quite well. I hope for a Grindhouse 2 in the future.",10,1,6,8 April 2007

One night while filming at a train station, they discover a train wreck, and they manage to escape without any injuries. But soon find something on the train has escaped, and that something is not human.A pretty mixture of coming of age and sci-fi thriller. It pulls out the laughs and thrills, and blends it all together perfectly. The kids here are joyful to watch, especially Elle Fanning who really comes into her own, not just to be thought of has Dakotas younger sister. Kyle Chandler(Early Edition, Friday Night Lights) was good as the sheriff and the father of one of the kids. So was Ron Eldard(Black Hawk Down, Ghost Ship) is also good has Fannings disgruntled father. Let not forget the effects are also good too.",8,5,11,15 June 2011

But coach Vermeil becomes amazed by Papales athletic skills, and offers him to come train with the team at training camp. But then Vince wonders if he can pull it off. A truly great film, Mark Wahlberg and Greg Kinnear are incredible in there roles. So is Elizabeth Banks as Janet, a long way from 40 Year Old Virgin role, she really proved she is a descent actress.

He soon gets more, and things start looking up, he makes a lot of money, and gets back with his girlfriend. But will it all come crashing down on him?This movie is a wild ride, you will just get pulled in. Bradley Cooper was good, he's never really surprised me as an actor, but really gave it his all here. Abbie Cornish was good, but I think she could have done more than what was giving to her. Robert De Niro was good in his supporting role, you really feel the presence of him, the amount he is on film.

Which starts out has a perfect score will soon turns into a nightmare cause this 60 something year old blind guy is nobodies fool.A really good tension grabber, keeps you on the edge of your seat. The movie is quite a surprise, just when you think the ending is predictable, then it completely pulls it around. Stephan Lang is quite menacing, puts a chill down your spine, does not have much dialog, but more his actions speak louder. I didn't think I was gonna root for the three young crooks, but the more I got to know two of them, I was really starting to feel for them, and the young actors played there parts very well. The scenes in the house are pretty effective, giving a good haunted house like feel to it.If you are in the mood for a good tension grabber, then give Don't Breathe a look.",10,11,26,29 August 2016
Beauty and the Beast," Memorable Disney remake
","No sense of me telling the plot, because it has been told so many times through the years, this film is basically a remake of the 1991 animated Disney film, although I never really watched it. This film is for kids and adults, they through in some adult jokes that would probably go over the kids head. It not always light, it also shows it's dark in spots.The effects are pretty good here to the point where it becomes the whole movie in spots. Emma Watson is great has the tough minded Bella, Dan Stevens really brings it has the beast. Luke Evans is so good at being hateful, and I was bit disappointed on his characters demise, he was so unlikable, I felt his character should have gotten a bigger justice then what I saw. And why is Josh Gad even in this, he is so out of place here, now I often find Josh Gad funny and entertaining, but his character seems to belong in another movie. But other then that it was a pretty entertaining film, enjoyable for the whole family. Lets not forget a memorable supporting role by Kevin Kline.",8,1,5,26 March 2017

Tom Cruise really carries the film, a lot of people thought he was miscast before seeing the film. But after seeing this, you might change your mind on that. Rosamund Pike is also good, she manages to be strong and hold her own with Cruise. I hope to see more of Jack Reacher.",9,4,15,23 December 2012
Les Misérables," Beyond Brilliant
","In most musicals, they often try to glorify the settings, but I really liked in Les Miserables that they wanted it to look the actually setting of how it was in the decade that the movie is set. I believe that the t.v. show The Fugitive(1963-1967) was a little inspired off this.The actors are fantastic here, Hugh Jackman really shines here, so was Russell Crowe, but Anne Hathaway really blew me away, she really felt bad for her, she gave a good acting job through singing, I hope she won't be missed by the Oscars, If she is I'll be very angry. Amanda Seyfried is alright, and Sacha Baron Cohen lightens up the movie, the moments when he comes in the film. The setting is perfect, so is the actors in there roles, this is the best film of 2012.",10,2,4,30 December 2012
Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2," The team of hero misfits return
","I think of Guardian of the Galaxy has the red haired step brother to The Avengers. Funny space adventure, with some dramatic moment. All the actors have good chemistry, and really feel comfortable in there roles. CGI Rocket Racoon voiced by Bradley Cooper, and Groot voiced by Vin Diesel really stole a lot of scenes. I was eagerly waiting for the sequel.The funny moments are always the best parts, but are some dramatic moments also, but never over shadow the funny parts. Our favorite hero team of misfits get into more trouble and find more adventures. Chris Pratt and Zoe Saldana really shine again as Star Lord and Gamora. So does Rocket and Groot once again voiced by Bradley Cooper and Vin Diesel. Michael Rooker is quite the scene steal er as Yondu. And Karen Gillan is memorable as Nebula. Kurt Russell really comes alive as Star Lords dad. The effects are pretty good for a space adventure, one scene I felt paid homage to The Empire Strikes Back(1980). I'm really excited to see more, the after credits scenes makes excited.",9,14,25,10 May 2017
In Time," Out Of Time
","In the not to distant future, where on your is measured on how long you have to live, you don't age past 25, that is when your time is up, unless you can buy more time. Now the rich have all the time in the world, there almost immortal. A young man named Will(Justin Timberlake), who's time is just about up, rescues a man who has a century on his arm, from gangsters, who are called Minute Men. When takes the man to a safe place, but the man does not like the life of immortality, and switches times with Will, while he was asleep, the next day the guy dies, and Will has a century on his arm. Will decides to use it his advantage, but happens when a cop(Cilliam Murphy) known has a timekeeper stumbles upon him? Justin Timberlake does alright, but does not quite have the acting chops, to pull it off, Joesph Gordon Levitt probably would have been a better choice. Amanda Seyfried who I'm amazed still has a career after Red Riding Hood, is only in it for sex appeal nothing more. Cillian Murphy is pretty good in his role, so is Vincent Kartheisher(Angel, Mad Men). I was hoping for something like Gattica(1998), It just annoyingly kept changing it's tone.",5,1,6,31 October 2011
Thor," The Mighty Thor comes to the big screen.
","Thor(Chris Hemsworth) is the god of thunder, son of Oden(Anthony Hopkins) and brother to Loki(Tom Hiddleston), is destined to be king of Asgard. But his arrogant behavior causes the threat of war, Oden is upset by Thors actions, for punishment he banishes Thor to earth, meaning he has no power, just a mere mortal. Is found by three scientists(Natalie Portman, Stellan Skarsgard, and Kat Dennings), while his magical hammer is miles away. Will Thor get to it, and his jealous brother Loki is piloting revenge on him, will he succeed? Not a bad comic book adaptation, Kenneth Branagh direction is well done, surprised me this not a film he used to doing. Chris Hemsworth plays Thor to a perfection. He really got into role in every sense. Anothony Hopkins is strong as Oden, so is Tom Hiddleston as Loki. Natalie Pprtman, Stellan Skarsgard, and Kat Dennings are memorable in there supporting roles. The special effects are pretty good also.",9,0,1,11 May 2011
The Disaster Artist," A interesting look at an entertaining disaster
","A few people knew about the so bad it's good film known has The Room(2003), I found out about it after watching The Nostalgia Critics review. And also inspired friend and costar Greg Sestero to write a novel about the experience. They say truth is stranger than fiction and this movie is a prime example of that.
James Franco is quite spot on has Tommy Wiseau,, his performance makes you think he is Tommy Wiseau, he does it without going into silliness. Dave Franco is also great has Greg Sestero, who sees something special in Tommy, but during the making of The Room, starts to question is there a method to his madness or it's just madness. Seth Rogen is also good in his supporting role. Also well directed by James Franco.",10,0,1,13 December 2017
Zombieland," A funny entertaining horror send up.
","I went in expecting a horror comedy film, but it is more comedy than horror. The horror part happens around the comedy. This film never takes itself too seriously. It was what Shaun of The Dead almost was in opinion. It never gets boring or stupid for a second. All the lead actors work well together. They seem to be having a fun time.Jesse Eisenberg goes from Adventureland to Zombieland, what are the odds. The funny pairing of Jesse Eisenberg and Woody Harrelson is done with comedic perfection. I had my doubts about Eisenberg doing comedy. Because he oftener plays serious one and the comedy happens around him, like in Adventureland. But he was pretty funny here, and he and Harrelson are like a perfect team. Now Emma Stone(last seen in Ghosts of Girlfriends Past) in not all funny, but she holds her own. Abigail Breslin I feel was not giving much to act on.But none the less an entertaining film. If you are in the mood for a fun time go see Zombieland.",8,2,5,5 October 2009
The Departed," The Streets Just Got Meanier
","This was a great crime drama, it was amazingly well directed by Martin Scororsese, it was well acted by the all star cast. They play off each other so well with drama and a little humor. The movie begins with Billy(Leonardo DiCaprio) is a cop who is in deep cover to infiltrate sadistic mobster Frank Costello(Jack Nicholsen at his best), as of Colin Sullivan(Matt Damon), a cop on the take, is trying to find out the undercover guy on Costellos team. It is only of matter of time on how both men are in over there heads, and will it come crashing down on both of them. A great way to spend 2 hours and 30 minutes, but it is so amazingly well paced, you'll forget how long it is.",10,1,2,19 October 2006
Glory Road," Enjoyable, but I wouldn't want to take this road again.
","It was not the best sports movie around, I'd say Miracle(2004) was way better then this. Maybe it's me, but I didn't feel that coach Don Haskins really had his plan for the game to well thought out, the way coach Herb Brooks from Miracle did. At times this movie is not to easy to sit through, This story was in 1966, and racism was high, and thank goodness I was not born in that time. It may not be the sports movie around, but it was not the worst. The Basketball scenes were good, and exciting. Josh Lucas gave quite a good performance has Don Haskins, but he soon gets overshadowed by Derek Luke(Friday Night Lights) as Bobby Joe Hill, the team leader, his performance was very Oscar worthy.",7,0,2,13 July 2006
American Made," Tom Cruise is back after the disaster known has The Mummy.
","The story of Barry Seal, who worked for the C.I.A. and became a drug runner, and was way in over his head and I'm sure you know the rest.Tom Cruise is really good here, well for the most part he is good, but in some scenes he looks like he's struggling to stay awake, not that he was sleepwalking through it, just that some scenes he looks so tired, like he didn't sleep much, but he was still good none the less. Sarah Wright is also good has Lucy, Barry's wife a tough but very loving. The late 70's and 80's look like the time period that it was set in. You'll feel the tension during the scenes it's presented. I know there was another film about Barry Seal called Double Crossed that came out in 1991, and was a T.V. movie that starred Dennis Hopper has Seal, I will see that some day. But American Made is a good film.",9,1,3,5 October 2017
Transformers: Revenge of the Fallen," Not all great the second time around.
","I was looking forward to this, I've been a fan since I was a kid. And when I found they where making a live action film out of the transformers, I thought they are out of there mind. But when I saw the first film in 2007, I was not disappointed. And I just saw the second one. And was it good or bad? Well a little of both actually.It's two years later, and Optimisprime and some new Autobots are working for the government, to help defeat new diseptacons from invading earth. Meanwhile Sam(Shia LaBeouf) is getting ready to go off to college. And tells Bumble bee that he can't come with him. And he has to leave his girlfriend Mikaela(Megan Fox). Has Sam begins to settle in college life. An enemy called the fallen wants Sam for some reasons. Will Prime and Bots stop the Fallen before it's too late?The good thing about this movie is the action and the effects, thy are just jaw dropping with excitement. You'll feel like it's in high definition if you sit close enough. Now what was bad, the overdone humor. I mean the first one had humor, but it knew not to overdo it. The writers must have forgot that kids at the age of 12 are gonna want to see this, cause they have more adult humor this time. And they also went to great lengths to make Megan Fox the eye candy through out the whole movie, I mean come on it is clear that she is a beautiful sexy woman, you didn't half to keep reminding us of that.This movie is not for any kids under 13. See it for the action and effects, but expect nothing else.",6,1,5,29 June 2009
Jersey Boys," Critics are haters, cause this was a great movie.
","I really enjoyed this film, and I am really surprised by the bad reviews it was getting, I'm starting to think critics don't really know good movies anymore. Clint Eastwood has director really shows that he was a big admirer of the Broadway play of the same name, I did see the play while I was on vacation with my family in Chicago, and I enjoyed the movie just as much has the play.It does kind of start out slow, but it really picks as it goes on. Shows the beginnings of Frankie Valli and his group The Four Seasons, there rise and fall, shown quite perfectly. The actors all play there parts with greatness, to the point I thought they where the real people and not just actors. The music is also awesome listen too. I say ignore those critics and see this and form your own opinion.",9,9,16,27 June 2014
The Holiday," You'll fall in love with The Holiday
","A perfect Christmas romantic comedy, It seems to pull out all the stops of a great love story, and comedy. Everyone was perfectly cast in there roles, you couldn't ask for a better cast. The film begins in England with editor named Iris(Kate Winslet), for her this holiday is not to jolly, when she is the last to know that the man she has been in love with for years named Jasper(Rufus Sewell) is engaged to be married. In L.A. a promo expert named Amanda(Cameron Diaz) is having it just has bad when her live in boyfriend named Ethan(Edward Burns) has been cheating on her. She is feeling upset and needs get away, she looks at a home exchange on the computer. She picks Iris cottage in England, and Iris agrees to her house in L.A.. When the switch is done, Amanda finds love with Iris brother Graham(Jude Law), and Iris finds love with the witty film composer named Miles(Jack Black). This is perfect date movie. Please don't miss it.",10,2,4,10 December 2006
Nick and Norah's Infinite Playlist," More entertaining than My Best Friend's Girl.
","Because it's actually funny, the jokes aren't tasteless, there where about two jokes I found tacky. But still a fun movie. And the two characters in the movie where likable and real in a funny way. And it was quite enjoyable. Everything My Best Friend's Girl wasn't It begins with Nick(Michael Cera from Juno and Superbad) is still trying to mend from a broken heart, after his tramp girlfriend Tris(Alexis Dziena) dumps him. One night decides to go out with his band to night club, when they had a gig. They also want to find a secret concert. Nick runs into Norah(Kat Dennings from The 40 year old virgin, Raise Your Voice, and The House Bunny) who asks him to pretend to be her boyfriend for a few minutes. But decides to help with her drunken friend Caroline(Ari Graynor). But Nicks band friends try to push him and Norah together. So they take a drunken Caroline, in hopes Nick and Norah will hook up. But the plan goes awry, when the band loses Caroline, and soon adventure and misadventure will follow.It felt like a John Hughes movie from the 1980's. Michael Cera and Kat Dennings are very appealing and have wonderful chemistry. And the rest of the cast do well also. Not an all great film, but an entertaining and funny film.",8,9,20,4 October 2008
Sausage Party," It's like a Disney film on acid
","I knew what to expect going in to this, coming from the insane minds of Seth Rogen and Evan Goldberg. I saw the trailer, and thought to myself this is gonna be one insane ride. When I came out of The Secret Life of Pets with my mom and my nephew, saw the poster to Sausage Party, I told my mom 'Don't be fooled by the poster, that is not a kids movie'.The story speaks the insanity for itself, about food in a grocery store, and that is all I'm gonna tell ya. The animation is top notch, spoofing those Pixar films. The actors really do voice there characters well. Seth Rogen really brings his humor well to his role has a hot dog. If your not a fan of vulgar humor, and gross out gags, then you should probably avoid this like the plague, cause this pulls no punches, it goes straight for the throat. It was very funny, there is perfect timing to all of the gags. It's not a masterpiece, but just a fun time for fans of this type of humor. Expect nothing or less.",8,23,48,20 August 2016
Joker," Very hard to top Heath Ledger, but Joaquin Phoenix is close behind.
","Set in the early 1980's, working clown Arthur Fleck(Joaquin Phoenix) a man who is heavily medicated, cause he is suffereing from mental illness, dreams of being a famous stand up comic, but his world begins crumble, will his sanity be lost, and his identity is only seen through his joker make up?
I get this is a totally different Joker movie, very different from the DC universe movies we have seen already. Phoenix is quite chilling to watch, as you watch him lose his mind. The movie borrows heavily from such films like Taxi Driver(1976) and The King of Comedy(1983). Robert De Niro is pretty memorable has Murray Hamilton, a Johnny Carson like talk show host. Phoenix really delivers a great performance, you can tell he became the character when the camera was rolling. One problem I had they showed the death of Bruce Wayne's parents, which I felt was not needed, better to be hinted at it instead, and the end keeps dragging itself out, to the point you'll be telling yourself end already. But other than that a good film.",10,4,9,10 October 2019
Edge of Tomorrow," Groundhog Day meets Starship Troopers
","In the future, where an alien invasion is taking place, William Cage(Tom Cruise) is killed in battle with the aliens, but some of the alien gets on him, he then finds himself in a time loop, where the day keeps repeating itself every time he is killed. Can Cage figure out how too defeat the aliens in time? Tom Cruise plays it pretty well, not totally playing it has a straight laced action hero, but at times has a goof ball. Emily Blunt is also great, as a tough female soldier who teams up with Cruise, I hope she plays more action roles in the future, not to mention she and Cruise have great chemistry. The rest of the supporting cast are pretty memorable also. The effects are great also, I know since Groundhog Day(1993) this premise of the day repeating itself has been done to many times, but Edge of Tomorrow does it quite clever.",10,0,2,13 June 2014
It Chapter Two," Not quite has memorable has the first one, but still entertaining.
","After the first one, I was eagerly waiting for this. The longest book Stephen King has written to the point where it had to be spilt into two movies. The actor playing the adult versions of the kid characters are well done, not quite who I would I thought about casting but still good.
Bill Skarsgard is still great has Pennywise, I mean he was so good, makes me wonder why was he not cast has The Joker. On some levels the 1990 mini series did some things better, then this film did. But there are other things that this film did better then the 1990 mini series. Some times the humor overshadows the horror parts. I found the kids more interesting then adults, I mean they where okay. Effects are pretty good, they will just out at you.",8,2,2,11 September 2019
"Hail, Caesar!"," Fun satirical look at Hollywood in the 50's
","Has well as the Cohen brothers as directors can do it, they both have a unique style of filmmaking, that works and sometimes doesn't.I like the way the film half the time never takes itself too seriously, the film had great ensemble cast, each one do shine in there own way, but the one who really holds it together is Josh Brolin, who plays the studio head. This film also showed the enjoyment of making movies of yesterday, and that the films of that decade made some people. Actors like Scarlett Johansson and Ralph Fiennes are not in it for very long, but do shine when there both are on camera, every moment of the cast milk it for all it's worth.",9,1,9,6 February 2016
Stranger Than Fiction," It felt like I was watching a Twlight Zone episode.
","The only thing missing was a Rod Serling look a like at the beginning. Will Ferrell gives a worthy performance, a good change of pace from his overly silly roles he is best known for playing. He plays Harold Crick, an IRS auditor, who brushes his teeth a certain way, goes to work, eats lunch and dinner, like it was a daily routine. His existences in life seems to bring out the worst in some people, like baker Ana Pascal(Maggie Gyllenhaal). Until one morning everything changes when Harold starts hearing a woman's voice, the voice seems to be narrating his every movement. Harold knows he is not crazy, so he turns too professor of literary theory named Jules Hilbert(Dustin Hoffman) who comes to the conclusion that he is a character in a book, but then Harold discovers that woman's voice is author Karen Eiffel(Emma Thompson). Will these two ever meet? You'll half too see the movie to find. Everybody gives a good performance. To the people who have not seen this yet, please it is worth it.",10,0,2,12 November 2006
Dark Shadows," Tim Burtons Entertaining Horror Comedy
","It seems like Johnny Depp can't say no to Tim Burton, they had some good collaboration, except for Charlie and The Chocolate Factory(2005). Now the re imaging of the 60's show named Dark Shadows.Johnny Depp is pretty memorable as Collins, the vampire who was buried for 220 years. And makes it clear that he is a character you don't always want to route for, and his pretty funny with his dialog. Eva Green(Casino Royale) is also a scene stealer has the witch who cursed Collins, she really plays evil to the max, and has such awesome chemistry with Depp. Michelle Pfeiffer is memorable, also Chole Gace Moritz. It's not all comedy, and not all horror. It balances the both. But if you are not into this, you should skip it. But it's awesome direction by Tim Burton.",8,2,9,14 May 2012
Hancock," I'd consider My Super Ex-Girlfriend a masterpiece compared to Hancock.
","My Super Ex-Girlfriend was funny and entertaining, but not Oscar worthy, It didn't try to be something that it wasn't. But comparing it to Hancock, and My Super Ex-Girlfriend is considered a masterpiece. I mean Hancock tries to hard to be too much of everything, and it fails to hit the high note. I saw the trailer, I thought I was expecting a fun superhero comedy with some dramatic moments. Would have liked it better, if it was just about a flawed superhero, and it did start out that way at first. But has it went on it became a seriously unwatchable melodrama of trying to explain why Hancock is so special, and it didn't explain itself enough to the point where you don't even care anymore. Now I know it was not meant to be a superhero film, Like My Super Ex-Girlfriend wasn't meant to be. But it could have been better if it just stayed a simply comedy. Why are Will Smith, Charlize Theron, and Jason Bateman wasting there talent on junk like this, I seriously don't think they need the money, or there desperate. Now the special effects are the only good in this movie. To some parents out there, who's kids love Will Smith, this is not a movie for kids. Take them home and watch Men In Black 1 and 2 instead.",1,18,38,4 July 2008
12 Strong," Great war movie
","True story about about a group of soldiers known has the horse soldiers, after 911 in 2001, go on a mission in hopes to prevent anymore terrorist attacks. Has they go deep in the country, and get closer to the danger, the question comes to mind, will they succeed and make it back?Chris Hemsworth, Michael Shannon, and Michael Pena all give great Oscar worthy performances, you start to forget that they are actors and feel that they are the real people.. Action scenes feel very real, not glorified one bit. All the actors play off each other very well. Great storytelling of a few good men who wanted to make a difference. Battle scenes are pretty intense also. I believe this a film that needs to be seen.",10,28,53,30 January 2018
Kong: Skull Island," Don't mess with Kong
","I did like 2005 film directed by Peter Jackson, although this film is not connected to that film. I read up that this film is connected to Godzilla(2014), but I fail to see any connection, it felt like pretty much it's own movie.takes place in 1973,a scientist and military crew go the mysterious Skull Island, in proof that it actually exist. But get more than they bargained for when they have to deal with the giant gorilla named Kong, and a bigger unknown threat.Not a bad adventure film, everybody here comes alive very well, the actors never get overshadowed by the effects. Tom Hiddleston was good, so was John Goodman and Samuel L. Jackson. But Brie Larson performance feels like she is in a different movie. Kong was awesome too. And yes stay after the credits.",9,2,5,18 March 2017
The Hobbit: The Battle of the Five Armies," Epic
","This third and final installment to The Hobbit series is the most epic in acting, effects, and action. I'd say this one takes the cake, It takes place where the last one left off, but a battle will quickly ensue unless Bilbo and Gandalf can something to help the situation.I felt watching this that the action scenes took week to films, cause they where so epic, and very well filmed, not to mention fight scenes are awesome. The actors all do incredible job, it proves to be more than just a fantasy adventure film, it's also about sinking into greed, and almost losing yourself, and what friends will go through for you. It really presents all that perfectly. I also loved the fight scenes, they are incredibly epic.",10,7,15,31 December 2014
Ray," You'll have Ray Charles on your mind.
","A truly excellent film, Very well directed by Taylor Hackford. Jamie Foxx gives a mesmerizing performance has the great musics-an Ray Charles. He didn't just act like Ray Charles, he was Ray Charles, when those camera started rolling Jamie Foxx was gone, and he turned himself into Ray Charles. He had everything about the man down pat. The way he moves and laughs. The movie examines his life, his going blind when he was very young, becoming a successful singer, and his wild times. It is sad that Ray Charles died before the films big release, but I'm glad to hear he did see(in his own way) the finished version. And I heard he was proud of it. Everybody else in the picture did very well, and gave excellent performances. But It was Jamie Foxx that pretty much took the whole picture. I can't imagine anybody else playing the role with such truth and honesty has Jamie Foxx did",10,0,1,18 March 2005
Shooter," It's Sniper, The Fugitive, and The Bourne Identity all in a blender.
","This movie was just meant for pure enjoyment, it was not supposed to be an Oscar winner. Just an enjoyable action flick. Although a little predicable for the most part, but still not a bad movie. It starts with Military marksman Bob Lee Swagger(Mark Wahlberg) retires after his last mission goes awry, and for three years he lives a simple life in the woods. And thinks he is pretty done with being a soldier, that is until he is approached by Colonel Isaac Johnson(Danny Glover) and asks him to help prevent an assassination attempt on the President, by showing them how an assassination would be done. Much to his dismay Swagger goes along with it. When that day comes to, An attempt is made on the Presidents life, and Swagger is framed, and goes on the run for his life, and that the same time try to find out why he was framed. Mark Wahlberg, Danny Glover, and Ned Beatty were all good in there roles. And the action was great.",9,3,10,29 March 2007
Inception," Mission Impossible meets The Matrix
","Christopher Nolan never ceases to amaze us, with such hit films like Memento(2000), Insomnia(2002), Batman Begins(2005), and lets not forget The Dark Knight(2008). And with Inception he proves that he never seems to outdo himself.The story begins a group of special agents led by Cobb(Leonardo Dicaprio), who have a device that helps them enter a persons mind, and get information, while not trying to get lost in the dream state. But Cobb is growing weary, and wants to retire, and go home to his kids. But his boss(Ken Watanabe) wants him and his team for another assignment, and promises him it will be the last. But will they make it through? A wonderful tale mixed with science fiction,adventure, and quite a good human drama. Christopher Nolan blends them together perfectly. Also great performances by Leonardo Dicaprio, Joesph Gordon Levitt, Ellen Page, Cillian Murphy, and Tom Hardy. It also had amazing effects. If you're in the mood for a sci-fi drama, then go check out Inception.",10,2,6,17 July 2010
Murder on the Orient Express," Great retelling of a classic
","The Story evolves around Hercule Poirot(Kenneth Branagh) a detective while riding a train, is suddenly pulled off of his vacation when a passenger(Johnny Depp) is murdered, has he investigates the murdered, and questions the passengers, he discovers there is more to the passenger then his murder.I really liked this, Branagh really shines as Poirot, puts on a perfect Belgium accent to the point I forgot he was British, and also has director. Johnny Depp is also good, I mean the amount of time he's on camera, you really get a feeling he's up to no good. The rest of the cast are also good, everybody works well together. Perfect music is played well when tensions builds.",9,7,20,14 November 2017
Sherlock Holmes," A well made entertaining mystery.
","Robert Downey Jr seems to keep surprising himself, first with Iron man(2008), and now with Sherlock Holmes. But I liked the idea that he brings his own to the character, without trying to come off like a silly version of the character. But when the humorous parts come in, he comes across like Cary Grant trying to do Sherlock Holmes.Jude Law and Rachel McAdams are also good in there supporting roles. It's perfectly well directed by Guy Ritchie. A perfect mystery movie that neither drags at any time. The wonderful dialog that Downey and Law as Watson, are entertaining, as they play off each other perfectly, and also with McAdams. So if you are trying to find an entertaining, please give Sherlock Holmes a look.",9,0,5,31 December 2009
The Secret Life of Pets," Will do for pets, what Toy Story did for toys
","Well known Pets are friends in the neighborhood, until one incident separates two dogs from there owner, there friends who are also pets must band together to find them.The movie makes you realize the joy of having a pet, made me remember my dog who passed away years ago. The voice actors really do well with there characters. It's a fun adventure and misadventure also. The animation is amazing, not Toy Story amazing, but amazing. Awesome to see all kinds of animals working together. Kids and adults I believe will enjoy this. Will make really enjoy owning a pet, and what a pet means to you.",10,26,48,5 August 2016
The Good Shepherd," What The Godfather was to the Mafia, The Good Shepard is to the C.I.A.
","This showcases the birth of the C.I.A., and how one man named Edward Wilson(well acted by Matt Damon) makes the ultimate sacrifice for this country he loved, and how he becomes distant from his wife(Anjelina Jolie in a fine performance) and there son. It takes place from the late 30's, 40's, 50's, and 60's. Each decade he becomes more and more quiet, and keeps to himself, as he realizes in the world of the C.I.A., you trust no one, every turn can be your enemy, forget the world of James Bond, which is just for fun, this movie is the reality of spy life. Although it is well directed by Robert Deniro, well acted by Matt Damon and Anjjelina Jolie. But this movie for the most part is badly paced, it is long it dragged itself, and you keep wondering where is this story with it self, unlike The Departed. Other then that it was a great movie.",8,2,4,31 December 2006
Arrival," Great Sci-Fi drama since 2001: A Space Odyssey
","An alien film, that really makes us think. It's played very real if this thing would happen. The effects do not feel faked, it's like we the audience are seeing the spaceship has it was actually here. It's feels like a two part about aliens and who we are as a society. The phrase we fear what we don't understand does come into play.This film is an odyssey, really pulls you in. A puzzle you slowly put together. It has a twist that even a movie critic didn't see coming. Amy Adams was really good, so Forest Whitaker, although Jeremy Renner felt under used for the most part. It starts out slow, but picks up has it goes on. This film reminds us that things are not what they seem, just when you think it's gonna fall in the category of those typical aliens invasion films, it quickly turns it around.",10,5,14,28 November 2016
The Blind Side," A blind man can tell that this is a great film.
","Nice to see Sandra Bullock come back after the cinematic travesty, called All About Steve(2009). This was a well made film, perfectly filmed,and great performances by everybody.Leigh Ann Tuohy(Sandra Bullock), seems to have the life most women would envy, a wonderful supporting husband(Tim Mcgraw), and two great kids(Lily Collins and Jae Head). But one day while driving home, she sees, a larger then life teenager which everybody calls Big Mike(Quinton Aaron), when she tries to talk to him, he comes across as a little withdrawn, and is nearly homeless, she decides to take him in, with her supporting family behind her. Leigh finds out his name is Michael Oher, and tries to dig up things about his past, in hopes of helping him, but the question is will she? I really liked this film, it manages to balance humor and drama perfectly. Sandra Bullock gave quite a strong performance, so Quinton Aaron, Lyn Collin, but Jae Head is quite the scene stealer. It also has a good football scene as well. And Kathy Bates is good in her supporting role also. I say see The Blind Side.",10,108,184,29 November 2009
Music and Lyrics," Totally Awesome
","It makes you think about old groups from the 80's, some are still going strong, and some have moved on to better things. Hugh Grant seems to be at his best when he does comedy, he can say the stupidest things and make them sound charming. He plays Alex Fletcher, a singer who used to be part of a WHAM like group called POP. But when they broke in the early 90's, his career has not been much of anything, these days he performs at conventions, until he is giving the opportunity to write a song for a singing sensation named Cora(Haley Bennett). But soon suffers from writers block, until he comes across Sophie Fisher(Drew Barrymore), a women who has a way with words. They both soon start writing the song together, but will they get it done in time? A great date movie. Hugh Grants comeback After last years American Dreamz. He and Drew have such perfect chemistry, I hope they will team up together again. This movie is funny and has great music, please go see it with a date.",10,5,8,20 February 2007
Birdman or (The Unexpected Virtue of Ignorance)," It's not a movie, it's an odyssey
","Riggan Thompson(Michael Keaton) an actor in his early 60's, who 20 years ago played an iconic superhero titled Birdman and in two sequels, and after leaving the franchise he has fallen on hard times, and now is trying to put his life together, trying a build a relationship with his daughter(Emma Stone) who is a former attic. And also putting together a Raymond Carver play, but quickly starts to lose it with an actor named Mike(Edward Norton) who's trying to steal the spotlight for himself in his play. Will Riggan keep his sanity together, and rebuild his acting career? I really like this film, it feels less like a movie and more like a journey. Michael Keaton really delivers a tour de force performance, I really don't understand why he is so underrated as an actor, he deserves so much better then what he is giving most of the time. And the other actors are also good like Emma Stone and Edward Norton. Birdman is the best movie of 2014.",10,3,13,2 November 2014
Never Back Down," An awesome hybrid of The Karate Kid and Bloodsport.
","Some filmmaker thought one day, since we are running out of ideas lets combine some 80's fighting films like The Karate Kid(1984), and Bloodsport(1988), and what you get is Never Back Down, The story of a teenager named Jake Tyler(Sean Faris, Best known from Yours, Mine, and Ours(2005) has just moved into a new town with mom(Leslie Hope) and younger brother(Wyatt Smith). Jake has a very big chip on his shoulder, and is estanged with his mother. One day after school, Jake is invited to a party, what he thinks is a way to make new friends, ends up turning into a UFC challenge, when Jake is lured into a fight by an antagonist named Ryan McCarthy(Cam Gigandet), although Jake puts up a pretty good fight, he is beaten down badly. In hopes to recover from this humilation, a new friend suggest a karate veteran named Jean Roqua(Djimon Hounsou). Althouh has doubts, he goes anyway. In hopes Jake will learn to exercise his mind and body. And thats all I'm gonna tell you. This film was not all bad, at times predicable, but still good. And the fight scenes were awesome, some were corny, but the rest were good. And everybody gives great performances also.",7,9,18,23 March 2008
Prometheus," See Prometheus, and put bad memories of Battleship behind.
","Ridley Scott returns to his sci fi roots, but I don't want to spoil if this is or is not a prequel to Alien, mainly because I want you to see this.A crew of explorers trying to discover the creation of life, travel to this uncertain planet in hoping to make an incredible discover, despite there differences, they should put aside. But will they make the discovery or will it be something else entirely? The characters have such an awesome interplay, most of them are very well developed. Like Michael Fassbender has David the Android, who really steals most of the movie. But everybody else is pretty enjoyable too. The effect are awesome, and it goes beyond just being a typical sci fi horror film, but an incredible vision of the future.",9,2,15,13 June 2012
Wonder Woman," Gal Gadot was born to play Wonder Woman
","Gal Gadot has a lot in common with actors Christopher Reeve and Chris Hemsworth she has been in some stuff and but gained recognition when she played a comic book character, like Reeve(Superman) and Hemsworth(THOR). After her appearance in Batman v Superman, you had a feeling she would get her own solo movie, and now here it is.The story takes during the time of World War 1, where Diane(Gal Gadot) was raised on the hidden Island Themyscira, to Amazon race. One day her life is turned upside down when a pilot named Steve Trevor(Chris Pine) comes crashing down on the Island. Diane saves his life, and decides to help him. and goes to America with him.This was way better then Batman v Superman and Suicide Squad which I think where modest hits, Wonder Woman has a film really delivers, everything you would want in an origin story. Much has I liked Man of Steel, the more I watched it the flaws keep showing. Gal Gadot plays Wonder Woman the character very well and not annoyingly one noted, when she comes into a new world, her situations are never played in a sitcom like way like it was in THOR. Chris Pine was good has Steve, she had Gadot have good chemistry, surprisingly . Action scenes are very well filmed, in a 300 like way. The World War 1 setting looks very realistic, and not just a set. At times he feels like those old war mission movies from the 60's. Everybody here shines as well. Makes me now looking forward to Justice League.",10,8,18,12 June 2017
Despicable Me," An entertaining animated film
","Gru(Steve Carell) is the most popular super villain out there, he looks like a cross between Lex Luther and Dr. Evil. He is at the top of his game, is planing is biggest heist to date, to steel a shrink ray, and get funding to build a rocket, fly into space, and shrink the moon, and steel it. With the help of his little yellow minions. But his plans quickly go awry, when another super villain wanna be named Vector(Jason Segel) steels the shrink ray from him, and just as Gru is smart, but Vector proves to be one step ahead of him. But he soon finds out that Vector has a weakness for cookies, when he sees three orphan girls sell him cookies. Gru decides to adopt the three girls, in hopes the will help him steel the shrink ray back, but will the plan go through? The animation is almost up there with the shreks and the toy story's. This film was funny, Steve Carell is memorable as the voice of Gru, not just the voice, but the animators try to mimic Steve Carells style of comedy. Jason Segel is also good. Despicable Me is for the whole family.",8,6,10,11 July 2010
Taken 2," Does not live up too TAKEN
","I was hyped after the travesty that was Battleship, in which Liam Neeson was wasted in, I was looking forward for this. Liam Neeson was awesome, has a retired CIA agent who was stopped at nothing to rescue his daughter. I enjoyed the unstoppable force that was Liam Neeson.Bryan(Liam Nesson) is in Turkey on business, but Kim(Maggie Grace) and Lenore(Famke Janssen) surprise him when they arrive there. And now it's a vacation. But the father to one of the men that Bryan killed in the first film wants revenge, brings his own set of goons. They end up kidnapping Bryan and Lenore, but they have not got Kim yet. Will Bryan stop them before it's too late? Liam Neeson was the only thing good here, although they went over a little on his character. But the action and fight scenes where poorly put together. Maggie Grace is really starting to look her age, in which I couldn't buy her playing 18-19 year old. And the bad guys here are pretty dumb, to the point that where more funny than frightening. Taken was good, but Taken 2 not so much.",4,2,5,7 October 2012
Step Up," This year's Dirty Dancing
","You'll feel great and full of energy after you walk out after seeing this movie, Probably the same way you felt after seeing Dirty Dancing(1987). The movie begins with Tyler(Channing Tatum), a rough and tumble kind of guy, who is a great dancer, but seems to be having it rough. One night he and his friends break in a performing school, and pretty much wreak some of it. But Tyler gets caught, and his friends get away. His community service is that he has be a janitor to the school he wreaked. Tyler soon notices the beautiful dancer named Nora Clark(Jenna Dewan) who's partner gets injured. But Nora sees what an incredible dancer Tyler is, decides to give him a try. Lets hope they do well together. This was a great movie all over, great acting, great dancing, and great music. Channing Tatum and Jenna Dewan have such beautiful chemistry together, I hope they will work together again someday.",10,1,4,7 September 2006
X-Men: First Class," Puts the X in excellent.
","Like Star Wars and Star Trek, now it's the X-Men turn to get a back story.The story takes in place in 1962, a young college student named Charles Xavier(James McAvoy), before he was known has Professor Xavier, is asked by Morina MacTaggert(Rose Byrne) to help figure out an evil mutant named Sebastian Shaw(Kevin Bacon) and his crews plan. Charles befriends a troubled mutant named Erik Lennsher(Michael Fassbender), before he became known has Magneto, He and Charles recruits other mutants, but will they all be able to be a step ahead of Shaw? An improvement over X-Men:Origins Wolverine. The effects are incredible, so are two surprised cameos, by whom I won't say. McAvoy and Fassbender give descent performances. So does Kevin Bacon as the villain, he just really gets under your skin. I liked the back story, and the 60's setting. A true delight for X-Men fans.",9,3,5,3 June 2011
The Wolverine," Marvel Comics favorite rebel returns
","Logan(Hugh Jackman) is now living in the wilderness, years after the events from X-Men:The Last Stand(2006), he is still haunted by the death of Jean Grey(Famke Janssen), is sought out by a servant by someone Logan saved in World War 2. Logan travels to Japan, but something happens, that Logan gets caught up in the mix.A little better than the last Wolverine movie, it has an effected story, and Hugh Jackman is always good as Logan/Wolverine. Action scenes are pretty good and quite intense. But the film does slow down, but then it got to the point where it was boring, but when it picks up, it really picks up. Japan setting was beautifully well shot. A flawed, but entertaining Wolverine film.",8,1,5,31 July 2013
The Dark Knight Rises," A Hero Rises
","It's been eight years since Bruce Wayne(Christian Bale) has retired being Batman, and Gotham City has been crime free. Bruce has not talked to many people since then. Until he comes across a cat burglar named Selena Kyle(Anne Hathaway), and Commisoner Gordan(Gary Oldman) wants to tell the events of what happened eight years ago, but chooses not to, in hopes of keeping the city safe. Until a massive mercenary named Bane(Tom Hardy) comes to wreck havoc on Gotham. Will Bruce don the bat suit again, and stop Bane before it's too late? It's not quite as good has The Dark Knight(2008), and Tom Hardy as Bane, is good but not memorable as Heath Ledgers Joker, but that is a tough act to follow. Christopher Nolan direction is still has brilliant has ever. Christian Bale is always great, so where Gary Oldman, Joseph Gordan Levitt, Marion Cottilrad, Michael Caine, and Morgan Freeman, everybody shines and nobody stands out. Action scenes are pretty cool, although the movie slows down in spots, but still a good film.Not to mention Anne Hathaways character can give Black Widow from The Avengers a run for her money.",9,2,6,26 July 2012
The Croods," Funniest prehistoric family since The Flinstones
","A family of caveman who are led by Grug(Nicolas Cage) who never venture far there rock home, they go out by day to get food, by night they go inside the cave to stay safe. But the eldest daughter Emp(Emma Stone) wants to see more that is out there, so one night she ventures further more, she quickly comes across an adventurer named Guy(Ryan Reynolds), then her families perfect little home comes crashing down with rocks, so The Croods have to team with Guy in hopes to find a new home.A fun film for the whole family. It never gets to silly or to serious, it balances that out pretty well. Emma Stone was good, I believe they made animated Emp in her likeness. Nicolas Cage was great also, doing it more straight instead of just crazy. And everybody else was good, the animation was almost as awesome has Wreck it Ralph was.",9,3,5,25 March 2013
Black Panther," Black Panther has arrived
","The Marvel universe just keeps expanding here, in every good way. After Chadwick Boseman first appeared has the Black Panther in Captain America Civil War, you knew like Wonder Woman it would not be long before he would get his own movie. I heard back in the 90's they where trying to get a Black Panther movie in hopes it would starring Wesley Snipes in the title role, but it did not happen and Wesley Snipes went on to play another Marvel character known has Blade.
So how does this film hold up, I gotta say pretty well. Action scenes are pretty well done, like in any other superhero movie. Fight scenes are awesome to watch. And the effects are mind blowing. Chadwick Boseman gives a likable performance has the main character, I mean you really route for him all the way. Let's not forget Michael B. Jordan has the villain Killmonger, and the rest cast do well also. I'm looking forward for more Black Panther films in the future.",10,22,70,18 February 2018
Iron Man," Feel the Iron pumping excitement with IRON MAN
","At long last the classic Marvel comic superhero knows as Iron Man comes to the big screen. I first thought Robert Downey Jr would be all wrong for the role of Billonaire inventor Tony Stark. Because Tony Stark was supposed to be a suave James Bond type of character, and Robert Downey Jr doesn't seem to fit in that category. But man I'm glad I was proved wrong. Because he brought a lot of comedy to the role, such humorous lines the great way Robert Downey Jr can deliver them so well. It also has incredible effects, and amazing flying scenes that almost come close to be has good as Superman(1978). The rest of the cast do well also. I hope we will see more of Iron Man on the big screen, in the years to come.",10,1,4,4 May 2008
Creed II," Creed 2 really delivers
","Adonis (Michael B. Jordan) seems to be settling into life has a boxer pretty well, and with Bianca(Tessa Thompson). Until Russian boxer Viktor Drago(Florian Munteanu) son of Ivan Drago(Dolph Lundgren), the man who killed Apollo Creed in a boxing match in 1985, the father Adonis never knew. Will Adonis beat Viktor or will it become a repeat of what happened to his father.
Creed 2 stands on it's own has a great sequel, in spots pays homage to the Rocky franchise. Michael B. Jordan is terrific here, giving it his all, so does Sylvester Stallone as Rocky Balboa, Tessa Thompson is also great. Dolph Lundgren is good returning as Ivan Drago, Florian Muntreanu is quite menacing as Viktor Drago. Boxing scenes are quite intense. It really lives up to the hype.",10,13,25,25 November 2018
Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice," Way better than Man of Steel(2013)
","This movie is getting mixed reviews by critic, the movie is flawed, and the flaws do show a little in the film. But other than that this movie was entertaining, I liked it a little better than Man of Steel(2013), cause it dives more into characters more.Now there is more to the story then just Batman and Superman battling it out, it's not just a Superman movie, but also a Batman movie, I liked Ben Affleck has Batman, playing a man struggling with his sanity, and when he is in the batman suit, he looks so menacing where does not even half to talk, you'll feel like he could kill you. Henry Cavil has Superman started out kind of bland, but his acting got better has the movie went on. Jesse Eisenberg really does well has Lex Luthor, putting his own spin on the character, I really don't agree with the critics on this one. Amy Adams is also great has Lois Lane.You see that director Zach Snyder is quite the visionary, you see it in a lot of his films. Action scenes are pretty enjoyable, really keeping on the edge of your seat. Fight scenes are quite the guilty pleasure also. And this also sets up a the Justice League movie. Jeremy Irons is quite the scene stealer has Alfred.I say ignore those harsh critics, see this movie and form your own opinion.",10,6,11,26 March 2016
Casino Royale," Not as good as Die Another Day(2002), but alright in it's own way.
","Daniel Craig seems to bring the same roughness to the role of James Bond, the way Sean Connery in the 60's. It does'nt play like your typical James Bond flick, like your used to seeing. This is a more back to basic type of story, how agent James Bond has to earn his OO7 statue. I'm kind of glad this was Bonds beginnings cause every legend has start somewhere, they pick the right actor, Daniel Craig fit the role to a tease, but the one of a few flaws is that they did not give him enough charming dialog that made the character so popular. And the action was alright, but Die Another Day was better with it's action. But hay it's only the beginning.",8,0,4,17 December 2006
Toy Story 3," Toy Story 3: The best one of all
","It's hard to believe it's been 15 years since Toy Story came out in theaters, you look at it now it feels like today. Toy Story was the first pixar animated film. Characters we grow to love, Woody(Tom Hanks), Buzz Lightyear(Tim Allen), Mr and Mrs Potato Head(Don Rickeles and Estelle Harris), Rexx(Wallace Shawn), Hamm(John Ratzenberger), and Slinky Dogg(Jim Varney). And a sequel followed four years later, and it proved to be a bigger hit than part 1, and we were introduced to Jessi(Joan Cusack). The ending of part 2 left you wondering,will there be a Toy Story 3, well 11 years later you finally got that answer.Andy is 18 years old, and is going off to college, and wants to take Woody with him, but he puts the other toys in a box, and attempts to put them in the basement, But Buzz and the gang are mistaken for trash, Woody tries to come to there rescue, they find themselves at a children's nursery called Sunnydale, they meet Ken doll(Michael Keaton), and others, the leader Lotto(Ned Beatty) a purple bear. Will this be good for them or not? I liked this one, it puts one up on part 2, it's more adventurous. Sadly Jim Varney(Slinky Dog) passed away in 2000, so actor Blake Clarke takes over for him and they sound almost alike. Michael Keaton steals a few scenes as the voice of Ken. The animation is a thousand times better than ever. Please don't miss it.",10,2,3,21 June 2010
Saving Mr. Banks," A Disney film like no other.
","It takes place in 1961, P.L. Travers(Emma Thompson) travels to California, in hopes to talk to Walt Disney(Tom Hanks) at Disney studios, to convince him not to bring her book Mary Poppins to the big screen, cause of her disliking for Hollywood adaptations, but Walt convinces her that she will have say so in all the productions. But also during this time, we go in flashbacks to Travers childhood on what inspired Mary Poppins.A very well made film, as we get in the heads of Travers and Disney, and trying to understand both there points of view. Hanks and Thompson both give terrific performances, really bringing these true to life people to life. The other supporting players don't disappoint either. The sixties setting was well done, and not to mention the flashbacks scenes also. Not to mention an Oscar worthy performance by Colin Farrell as Travers father.",10,1,4,22 December 2013
Thor: The Dark World," The Mighty Thor Returns
","It's been a year since the events in New York, and Loki(Tom Hiddleston) has been sentenced t the dungeons of Asgard by Odin(Anthony Hopkins). Jane(Natalie Portman) while staying in London, stumbles onto a secret realm, in which she ends up in for a couple hours, and when she comes back, something has come back with her, and it's in her system, Thor(Chris Hemsworth) reunites with Jane in order to help her. But an old enemy from Odin's past wants what is in Jane's system, and he will stop at nothing to get it.A pretty good Marvel film, although I do miss some of the Shakespearing elements from the first one, but the effects and scenery are incredible, I feel where inspired off of Lord Of The Rings and Star Wars. Chris Hemsworth is still great as Thor, Natalie Portman and Idris Elba are giving more to do the second time around. This makes me excited for the second Avengers film.",9,5,10,10 November 2013
Lucy," La Femme Nikita meets Limitless
","Lucy(Scarlett Johansson) a partying 25 year old, while vacationing in Taiwan becomes entangled with gangsters, and has a certain drug surgical put in her body to transfer, but after she is roughed up by a henchmen, the drug quickly transfers in her system, and then becomes an intelligent super powered warrior. And becomes hunted by the bad guys, but her new found powers helps her stay ahead of them. How will this all end? This movie was a wild ride, Luc Besson knows how to direct intense action. Scarlett Johansson gives an enjoyable performance, I mean you just like seeing her in this type of action role, and also how her character changes personalities. Morgan Freeman is also good has a scientist who becomes intrigued by Lucy. I liked the idea it also very though provoking on the human brain, and how length can it go. But it is a fun ride.",9,11,31,28 July 2014
Midway," We'll done
","The movie shows you what World War 2 is like, I know you have seen it through Saving Private Ryan, and Dunkirk, and Midway is no different. Showing both sides of World War 2 of the americans and the Japanese, and makes us understanding both sides very well.
Action scenes are pretty intense, and give you quite the experience of making you feel like the pilots in the plane. And the effects are pretty good also. The all star cast perform well too, from Woody Harrelson to Patrick Wilson, even Mandy Moore, and Dennis Quaid. The movie does slow down a bit, and may get a little boring. But when it picks up it really picks up.",9,2,3,15 November 2019
Star Wars: Episode VII - The Force Awakens," Star Wars: A New Beginning
","After months of waiting, The Force Awakens is finally here. It was beyond good, everything you'll love about a Star Wars film is here. It does not go overboard with CGI effects like prequels did. The effects here are practical like they in the originals. It does have an awesome light-saber duel, would not be a Star Wars film if they did not.The new cast are pretty enjoyable, John Boyega as Finn and Daisy Ridley as Rey have great chemistry, they have a Han and Leia like thing going. Harrison Ford returning as Han Solo is like he never left after 32 years. Carrie Fisher as Leia is also great, so are Chewie, R2d2, and C3PO, and new robot BB8. It ends with you wanting more, like Empire Strikes Back did. At times there homages to the first Star Wars film, but it's pretty much it's own film.",10,5,35,20 December 2015
RED," I don't agree with the critics on this one.
","Red manages to balance the line between action thriller, and light comedy, and does it quite well.Frank Moses(Bruce Willis) a former C.I.A. agent is now retired, and living a simply, and at times boring life. His only joy of the day when he calls Sarah(Mary Louise Parker) a customer service agent, who he likes, Frank pretends not to get a monthly check, just an excuse to talk to her. But Franks simply life is interrupted, when he learns that somebody has put hit on his life, he goes on the run, after escaping an attempt on his life. He takes Sarah along too, much to her dismay. And gets his old team back together(Helen Mirren, Morgan Freeman, John Malkovich) in hopes to uncover who is behind the hits, but will they before it's too late? I really don't agree with the critics on this one. Red was entertaining. It's funny without trying to get overly silly. Action scenes where good. Bruce Willis, Mary Louise Parker, Helen Mirren, Karl Urban, Richard Dreyfuss, Brian Cox, and Morgan Freeman. But it's John Malkovich who steals the show, with his funny one liners. And also a great co starring role by veteran actor Ernest Borgnine.",8,90,122,20 October 2010
Flight," Denzel never seems to disappoint
","Airline pilot Whip Whitaker(Denzel Washington) saves a bunch of passengers after a plane nearly crashes, while in the hospital recovering he meets Nicole(Kelly Reilly) a recovering addict who he befriends. At first being regarded as a hero, but soon an investigation starts to begin, cause Whip might have been drunk while flying, and was Whip the cause of the plane malfunction?Brilliantly directed by Robert Zemeckis, is first film in a while that is just people not animation. Denzel Washington gives an Oscar worthy performance. Playing a character we don't know weather to love or hate. The plane scene is very intense you feel like your in there with them. Supporting players don't disappoint either, Don Cheadle, Bruce Greenwood, John Goodman, and Kelly Reilly.",10,2,6,19 November 2012
The Hunger Games: Catching Fire," I liked it more than the first.
","It has been a year since Katniss(Jennifer Lawrence) and Petta(Josh Hutcherson) both won The Hunger Games, now they go on tour as celebrities pretending to be a couple, making speeches. But the president(Donald Sutherland) want to break Katniss, emotional as well has physical.I thought everything that was first done well in the first Hunger Games film, was done much better here. The setting was well done, also the tension was greatly approved upon. Jennifer Lawrence is great as Katniss, so was Josh Hutcherson as Petta, I they grew more since the first one, Woody Harrelson steals some scenes he's in, Donald Sutherland is also as the evil president, after seeing this, I'm excited for the next one.",9,2,21,29 November 2013
Godzilla," Makes up for the 1998 film
","This Godzilla is in a way a sort of remake of the old monster movie Godzilla, it was way better then the 1998 film, the characters here are not over the top with there humor, they are very well written, to the point they give you the scense that this is really happening. Bryan Cranston performance is great, Aaron Taylor Johnson was good, so Elizabeth Olsen, and Ken Watanbe.The effects are terrific, Godzilla is awesome, not over done like in the 1998 film, those scenes are will have you on the edge of your seat. Pacific Rim brought back the giant monster movie, and that is why Godzilla gets a reboot. It's not as good has Pacific Rim, but Godzilla comes in a close second.",9,3,7,20 May 2014
Looper," Blade Runner meets The Terminator
","In the year 2044, hit men known has Loopers, kill people sent 30 years from the future, to be easily erased.

Then one day when a hit appears to him, Joe gets a look at the hit, turns out it's him(Bruce Willis) 30 years from now, Joe hesitates, and then his older self gets away. Joe soon becomes hunted by the mob, for letting his target get away. How will Joe make it through in the end? This was a pretty good sci-fi thriller, the trailers made it look like a simple premise, but there is more to it. Joesph Gordon Levitt and Bruce Willis are pretty good in there roles has the same person, despite the heavy makeup put on Levitt, he really had you believing that he was a young Bruce Willis. Jeff Daniels is great has a crime boss. Emily Blunt is also good.",10,3,16,1 October 2012
Footloose," Alright, but not as memorable has the original.
","I really believe that if not for High School Musical and Glee fame, Footloose would not have been touched. I remember seeing the original when I was a kid. Such 80's classics like The Karate Kid and Arthur are getting remade, now it's Footlooes turn.The dancing is good, but going after in the musical style of dancing, rather than just going after kids having fun. It's not bad, but the overly rehearsal in the dancing begins to show. Now the filmmakers wanna bet that we saw the original, they through out things that remind us of the original Footloose.Kenny Wormald as Ren, was alright, he plays the part to the best to his advantage, and he is a good dancer, but he just does not have Kevin Bacons rebellious charm, he's just so subtle in the role.Julianne Hough didn't have me convinced that she is a wild child, the way Lori Singer did in the original, although she does have one good dramatic scene. But other than that she did not convince me she was a wild child.Dennis Quaid has the preacher, Quiad is a good actor. But just does,nt have John Lithgow commanding presence. But like Wormald does give it his all. So I'll give them all credit for trying.Although amusing, this remake failed to be as memorable as the original. But You'll probably see it for the dancing and the music.",7,3,9,19 October 2011
Deadpool," Everything you would want in a Deadpool movie
","Remember X-Men Origins:Wolverine(2009), well this movie tells you totally forget that and watch this instead, cause it tells the origins of Deadpool has it meant to be told. The Merck with a mouth named Wade Wilson(Ryan Reynolds) discovers he has terminal cancer, but is offered by someone to be apart of an experiment, is told that it would cure is cancer and give him superhuman abilities, but after it horribly disfigures him. Wade soon embarks on revenge with his newfound skills has Deadpool.I believe that fans of the character, will not be disappointed. Deadpool is supposed to be an incredible over the top cocky character. And if you have seen Blade: Trinity(2004), you know Ryan Reynolds can play that to a tease. Not only a marvel movie but a satire of a marvel movie, pokes fun at all those superhero cliques. Ryan Reynolds is clearly having fun here, so is the rest of the cast, it's not hard to imagine that was a lot of laughing during the filming, you clearly see it in the acting. The effects are incredible, and the action is over the top, but this is a Deadpool movie, expect nothing more or less. It has hard R violence, just by saying this is not a kid friendly marvel film. I was very entertained by this.But if you are easily offended, you should probably stay away from this.",9,4,13,14 February 2016
Get Him to the Greek," Not quite has funny as it tried to be.
","Aaron(Jonah Hill) works for a big record company, in hopes to get a big break, but one day finally gets it, when a music mogul(Sean Piddy Combs) asks him to go to London to get fading rock star Aldous Snow(Russell Brand, reprising his Forgetting Sarah Marshall role), and get him to the Greek theater in 72 hrs, but Aaron is gonna discover that getting him there is not gonna be simply.The first half was pretty funny, but when it got to the second half, the films humor seems to get lost, even the hart of the matter seems to lose it's purpose. Jonah Hill is watchable, so was Sean Piddy Combs spoofing himself. Russell Brand was funny in the first part, but he got really annoying has the movie went on. I think it was trying to be like this years The Hangover, but it just does not quite get there.",6,1,4,15 June 2010
Cloud Atlas," Cloudy with a chance of greatness.
","So many story lines are rolled together, It's a mixture of everything, love,humor,intrigue, and science fiction. The time line jump around a lot, it never stays on one storyline for the longest. It's a 3 hour film, but it is so well paced you'll forget how long it is. The creators of The Matrix Trillogy can bring such an intriguing epic to the big screen.Tom Hanks, Halle Berry, Hugo Weaving and Jim Strugess all play several different characters through out the movie, and they all do it quite well, but in some parts the make up does not look that convincing, but the performances make up for that. I hope the acting won't be missed by the Oscars. The settings also become a character, as it takes from past,present, and future. One great film, not just the best film of 2012, but the best film all around.",10,7,15,30 October 2012
300," Spartans RULE
","This movie manages to create a world that is mesmerizing and visually stunning as Sin City and A Scanner Darkly. Like Sin City, this story is also the creation of graphic artist novelist Frank Miller. It is set in 480 B.C. And the King(Gerard Butler) and 300 men prepare to go to battle. This film manages to create the most intense battle scenes since Gladiator and The Matrix, it holds you on the seat of excitement. Gerard Butlers performance was great and not over the top. And not to mention he did workout for 4 months, 6 days a week, and 4 hours a day. The result paid off nicely, he looks like something Michaelangelo carved out of stone.",10,3,13,15 March 2007
Kingsman: The Secret Service," Men in Black without aliens
","Harry Hart(Colin Firth) a special agent working for the agency titled Kingsman, recruits a smart but troubled young named Eggsy(Taron Egerton) to become a Kingsman, feeling he has what it takes, meanwhile a billionaire madman named Valentine(Samuel L. Jackson) is bent on world domination.If you like the violence in Kick Ass, then you'll probably like this one, cause it pulls no punches when it comes to that. Action scenes are pretty intense. everybody looks like that they are having a fun time making this, cause all the actors look at ease in there roles. Colin Firth seems to be having a joyous time, so does Samuel L. Jackson has the main bad guy. If you loved Kick Ass, Men in Black, or Wanted, then you'll probably want to see Kingsman.",9,3,11,21 February 2015
The Hangover Part III," I lost 100 minutes of my life.
","I liked The Hangover(2009) it was funny, edgy, and entertaining. The Hangover part 2(2011) was a rehash of the first one, but it was funny so that makes it passable. But The Hangover part 3(2013), was none of the above. Don't get me wrong, I'll give them credit for trying to go in a different direction, but why call it The Hangover, when there is no hangover, why not just call it The Wolfpack, and people would still believe it was hangover sequel.The comedy was not even hit and miss, it was just a big miss completely. It's less on laughs, and more on being a crime thriller, and it fails miserably. The cast this time just can't make it work, it does not look like they are having any fun. Ken Jeong as Chow was funny in the first two, but here he is nothing more than a one big headache. I just couldn't wait to get out of there. For a good time, not this one.",3,1,2,27 May 2013
Easy A," Emma Stone is an A+
","You would think a story about a teen lying about having sex would not seem like a winner, but it's the comic performance of Emma Stone that really keeps your interest. In her first starring role, and she does not disappoint. Emma Stone is the new comedic actress of this generation.Olive(Emma Stone) is a clean cut teenager, who lacks a social life. But that all changes when she tells a little lie about her having sex with a guy to her friend(Alyson Michalka, Phil of the Future and Hellcats), Olive doesn't think much of it, till it gets around school, people starting rumors about her. Olive does not like it at first, but quickly embraces it, then a lot of outcasts ask her help, to pretend to have sex with them, so they won't be nerds anymore. But what happens when this gets to be too much for Olive to handle? The writers of this where trying to channel those teen movies of the 80's, and did it very well. Emma Stone is such a joy to watch. But she does not hog the spotlight from her co-stars, Patricia Clarkson and Stanley Tucci has her ditsy parents, they are quite the scene stealer's. Not to mention Alyson Michalka, Amanda Bynes, Penn Bagley, Lisa Kudrow, and Thomas Haden Church are also great. A+ for Easy A",9,0,3,24 September 2010
Fast Five," You'll get what you paid for.
","this is best one of the franchise, the action is just in your face. I only saw the first two Fast and the Furious sequels. I didn't see the 3rd or the 4th. But when I saw trailer to this, I knew it was a film not to be missed, and I was right.Dominic(Vin Diesel), Brian(Paul Walker), and Mia(Jordana Brewster) hatch a plan for the perfect heist, they put together a team, and map out the plan, but it gets short sided when a enforcement agent(Dwayne The Rock Johnson) is hot on there trail, and he and his team will stop at nothing till they bring down Dominic and his team down. but will they? In all these movies the shiny cars become a character themselves. The action is ten times intense then ever, it has awesome chase scenes. Not to mention an awesome confrontation between Vin Diesel and Dwayne The Rock Johnson, watching those two muscle bound action stars slug it out on film, is like a dream come true. like I said you'll get what you paid for.",8,0,1,2 May 2011
Fantastic Four," 4 times the excitement, 4 times the effects, 4 times the fun.
","It was not as good has Batman Begins, but it was good in its own right. Taking from the Marvel comic book pages. There was a 1993 film version, which I heard was so bad it was nowhere to be found. This film was quite enjoyable, not cheap at all, and I believe it will be everywhere on DVD, unlike the 1993 version. The film starts out when Reed Richards(Ioan Grufford) and his nice but quick tempered friend Ben Grimm(Michael Chiklis) make a plan to go up in space, with his billionaire old friend Victor Von Doom(Juilan McMahon), and scientist, and Reeds ex-girlfriend Sue Richards(Jessica Alba) and her hotheaded younger brother Johnny(Chris Evans) come along for the ride. But they soon have an accident in space when they all get hit with cosmic rays. And they come back to earth with different super-powers. Reed: can flex farther then normal. Sue: can turn invisible and make force fields. Ben: turns into a rock like creature with incredible strength, and can not be hurt. Johnny: can turn into flames, and fly. And that is all I'm gonna tell you about the movie. To all readers, you will not be disappointed.",9,32,60,10 July 2005
Click," It's A Wonderful Life Meets Back To The Future
","Imagine if you had remote that not only worked on your television, but worked on everything else around you, if you were able to pause time, fast forward, rewind it even. That is what Adam Sandlers character has to answer, he plays Michael Newman, an overworked architect who seems to have very little time to spend with family, he seems to become distant from his kids and his loving but frustrated wife Donna(Kate Beckinsale), one day Michael decides to go buy a universal remote at Bed, Bath And, Beyond, and comes across an inventor named Morty(Christopher Walkin), And Morty gives him a universal remote. But Michael soon discovers that this remote doesn't just work on the T.V. , but on everything else around, the remote has power to forward and rewind time, and even pause it, and much much more. Michael begins to have fun with. But what happens when Michael gets a little carried away with it? Although I would not call this movie a crowning achievement, It was quite enjoyable for the most part. I do admire Adam Sandler for trying to give a descent performance, and playing Michael not just as a great big silly head. It had incredible effects also. Christopher Walkin And Kate Beckinsale were also good in there roles also.",7,1,4,25 June 2006
Pineapple Express," One enjoyable stoner comedy for 2008.
","Drugs are never funny in real life, but in films like this there a laugh riot. This movie will remind you of the old Cheech and Chong movies. Seth Rogen and James Franco are quite a funny pair, they gave them the right jokes and both of them just wing'd it. It's about two moron potheads named Dale(Seth Rogen) and Saul(James Franco) go on the run, after Dale wittiness's a mob slaying, and a weed named Pineapple Express is found at the scene. But will these too potheads get out of the dangerous situation alive? You will half too see this movie to find out. It was one funny ride, that is all this movie was meant to be, a movie you could sit down with your friends, have a big laugh, and forget about your problems. The jokes will you turning red with laughter. It was enjoyable action comedy. But for some people, don't see this movie if you are easily offended.",8,0,2,13 August 2008
John Wick: Chapter 2," Just when he thought he was out, they pull him back in.
","John Wick wants to live in peace, and leave the life of a hit-man behind him, but because he is such a legend in the business, and not many professional killers can top him, Wick finds himself pulled back in. I don't want to give anything away, but let me tell you'll get your moneys worth.John Wick 2 does everything that a sequel should do, it ups the intensity from the first film, and puts Wicks situation into a non survival thing. Keanu Reeves really owns the role of John Wick, it clearly shows he loves the playing the role. And also Common and Ruby Rose are also good has other killers here. And not to mention an awesome cameo by Laurence Fishburne, yeah it's a matrix reunion here. Although the main villain does not really give off much here, unlike in the first film. But I'm really hoping for a third film, it ends with you wanting more.",9,11,22,13 February 2017
Incredibles 2," 14 years worth the wait
","I loved the first Incredibles film that came out in 2004, I wondered for years if there would ever be a sequel, the first one was a superhero film and at the same time a sort of satire of a superhero film. Craig T. Nelson and Holly Hunter get back in there roles pretty easily, so does Samuel L. Jackson has Fro Zone. Also some other new super characters in which I hope they get there own spin off movie. The animation is even better then the last film. Action scenes are also great. All the characters shine here, even baby Jack Jack who steals most of the movie. Will there a 3rd film, I don't know, we will probably have to wait another 14 years. But this was an Incredible sequel.",10,1,6,18 June 2018
Sin City," Come to Sin City, where every corner has a story.
","Director Robert Rodriguez is a wildly inventive,I mean watching this film that would made you feel that you were reading a graphic novel, in which this movie is based on. The town is so cartooned it's mesmerizing. It is story of three different tales in a town called SIN CITY, an ex-con named Marve(Mickey Rourke) is framed for murder of his Hooker girlfriend(Jamie King), sets out to avenge her death, teams up with her twin sister(Also Jamie King). An another tale is tough guy named Dwight(Clive Owen) teams up with Hookers/Asassins led by Gall(The ever so beautiful Rosario Dawson) to take down the cities corrupt system. And honest cop named Hartigan(Bruce Willis) tries to protect a beautiful dancer named Nancy(Jessica Alba) from a child molester(Canivales, Nick Stahl) who escaped him years earlier. It also has amazing guest spots from well known faces, whom I won't say. Frank Miller did an amazing job put this graphic novel together, I'm so glad he said yes to the movie.",10,1,2,3 April 2005
The Ugly Truth," It was more entertaining then I expected it to be.
","I was expecting another stupid unfunny comedy like My Best Friend's Girl and Observe and Report. But surprisingly I didn't get that here, I got enjoyable funny adult comedy. Where the two main leads play off each other perfectly. The vulgar jokes are said not to be gross, but instead said in a lighthearted way.Abby(Katherine Heigl) is an uptight workaholic, who can't seem to the man of her dreams who lives next door, and he is a foot doctor named Colin(Eric Winter). Abby is a producer for cable morning show. But the ratings are slipping, and in hopes to get the ratings a boost, her boss(Nick Searcy) decides to bring in Mike(Gerard Butler) a host of an adult show called The Ugly Truth, about the complications between men and women. And his show gets put on there network, much to Abbys dismay. She does not like Mikes outspokenness. And much to Abbys surprise, the ratings skyrocket. But Mike soon realizes Abbys trouble getting a man, and decides to help her. Abby surprisingly excepts his help.I thought Katherine Heigl was gonna be bad, but she wasn't, she was very funny enduring,so was Gerard Butler. They both have incredible chemistry. The supporting cast do alright. A pretty entertaining adult comedy. It was almost has good has The Hangover.",8,2,11,3 August 2009
Spectre," You know his name.
","James Bond(Daniel Craig) infiltrates a criminal organization known as Spectre, but soon discovers he might have a bigger connection to it then he thinks.Daniel Craig once again knocks it out of the park has James Bond, but in this one he is a little more loose, then he was in the last ones. Characters M, Q, and Money Penny are giving more to do this time, then just being side characters. But Christoph Waltz really is who grabs you has the main bad guy, when he's on camera, you'll feel the chills going down your spine, he just has a menacing presence. David Bautista is also good in his role, has the main henchman. Action scenes are alright, nothing too spectacular. Bond girls are alright, just kind of there.There are moments that it does pay homage to other bond films, but it stands on it own.",9,28,54,13 November 2015
Moon," an Oscar worthy sci-fi drama.
","In the not to distant future, Astronaut Sam Bell(Sam Rockwell) works for Lunar Industries, he has to live on a space station on the moon for 3 years, mining it's resources and sending it back to earth. His only company is a talking computer named Gerty(well voiced by Kevin Spacey). When his third year is almost up, Sam is eager to get back to his wife and daughter. One day while working Sam has an accident, and almost dies, but somehow is saved. But things begin to take a turn for the weird, when Sam sees the person that saved him,that person looks amazingly like him, and he asks him who he is, he says he's him 3 years earlier. So is Sam in some sort alternate time line, or has been cloned, or is he just going crazy? A well made film. Some might compare it 2001(1968), and it does not beat around the bush, that it was inspired off it, but when you see it, you'll come to find it's pretty much it's own movie. Sam Rockwell gave quite a performance, you really got in the moment with him every time, he really gave it his all, I hope he won't be missed by the Oscars. And Kevin Spacey has the voice of Gerty was also great, the best computer character next Hal 9000 and K.I.T.. Duncan Jones is such a brilliant director, he is such a visionary. All in all, Moon is a great film, the best film of 2009 so far.",10,8,13,21 July 2009
The Nice Guys," An excellent homage to 70's violent cinema that was surprisingly not directed by Quentin Tarantino.
","It's set in the 1970's, and it feels like it was made in the 70's, and at the same time satirizes the 70's. Director Shane Black really brings the action comedy and crime thriller qualities and puts them together perfectly.Two private investigators(Russell Crowe and Ryan Gosling) who are both mismatched, become unlikely partners to solve the sudden death of a porn star, and to find a young woman who may be connected, but quickly discover there is more than meets the eye.It's easy to imagine that Ryan Gosling and Russell Crowe where having a blast making this. The two play off each other perfectly during the 70's setting. Angourie Rice(who looks like a young Reese Witherspoon) steals the show as Goslings daughter, she really becomes the heart of the movie, I hope to see more from her in the future. It has great laughs and suspense also. It really keeps you glued, I want to see more films like this in the future.",10,8,16,5 June 2016
Mad Max: Fury Road," One Trippe insane fun movie.
","After 30 years, Mad Max returns to big screen, this time played by Tom Hardy, who does do not do Mel Gibson, but plays it on the same level that Gibson played it on. The film is so intense with it's acting and action, I mean it almost never let's up.Max(Tom Hardy) finds himself helping a tough female named Furiosa(Charlize Theron) who is trying to get some females who are the wives of cult leader Immortan Joe(Hugh Keays-Byrne), trying to get them to safety, with Joe not to farm from there trail, the question is will they make it? Although it is titled Mad Max: Fury Road, but Max is not the main focus, it's like he is a side character in his own movie. Charlize Theron is basically the star. And I liked her tough female character. And Hugh Keays-Byrne is pretty great has Immortan Joe, playing another Mad Max villain. Also Nicholas Hoult who I did not know it was him at first. Action scenes are the best you'll see around. George Miller direction was incredible, he knows the character better then any of us.",10,3,10,20 May 2015
Warcraft," This film was for fan service only.
","I never really played the game, but I bet the ones who did play the game are gonna find this good, probably gonna give this ten stars. The problem with this is that it never makes an attempt to be interesting, most of the human characters are so bland, like Travis Fimmel who looks like Paul Rudd, he is just one facial experience through out, looks like he just recovered from a hangover. Ben Foster does okay, he looks like a young Gandalf from Lord of The Rings.The two actors I really got infested into was Toby Kebbell who plays a good CGI Orc, and Paula Patton who plays a half human/half Orc, I really wanted to see more to her character. The CGI where pretty descent, but the fight scenes could have been better, they end before they ever really start. Dominic Cooper is alright has the king. If there is gonna a sequel, I must say I ain't really looking forward to it.",5,4,13,12 June 2016
Me Before You," Claflin and Clarke where to perfect
","This film is getting mixed reviews, but I really enjoyed it. A very bittersweet film that will leave you feeling happy and sad at the same time. I never read the book that which this film is based on. But sometimes movies are never has detailed has the books they are based on.A beautifully well made story, it about Louisa(Emilia Clarke) a 26 year old who finds a job taking care of Will(Sam Claflin) a young billionaire who is permanently confined to wheel chair after an accident two years earlier, the use of his arms and legs are gone. At first Will does not want Louisia there, and she does her best to put up with him. But soon the form quite a friendship, she teaches him to enjoy life again, and he shows her to be adventurous in life. But the question is will this last? I like the chemistry between Claflin and Clarke, at no point it feels forced. I really bought the affection they feel for one another. At times Clarkes performance feels overly cartoonish, but still good in most of it. Claflin is believable, and the question is how would you feel if you where in his shoes. I don't care what the critics say, this was a perfectly well made bittersweet film.",10,166,219,10 June 2016
Transformers: Dark of the Moon," It's makes up for Revenge of the Fallen
","The first Transformers film was silly but enjoyable story, with 2 likable leads, Shia LeBeouf and Megan Fox. Some great effects. Revenge of the Fallen had a story that was silly and contrived, it was hard to take seriously. It made you not gunning for part 3.But Dark of the Moon surprised me, Michael Bay did a lot things right, the movie managed to use humor at the right time, and not all over the place like in Revenge of the Fallen. The effects are amazing, battle scenes are beyond epic. The acting was pretty good, except Shia LeBeuof overacted in a few scenes. Patrick Dempsey is good in his role. Rosie Huntington-Whitely is new to the cast, but after a few minutes of her being on screen, ya'll be like'MEGAN WHO'. Leonard Nimoy is good has the voice of Sentinal Prime. Dark of the Moon is what the first two should have been.",8,2,6,10 July 2011
The Social Network," Excellent story of the origins of FACEBOOK.
","Based on a true story, although after watching this, I'm not sure how much of this movie is true or creative license. But who cares I consider this movie to be a masterpiece.The story about Mark Zucerberg(Jesse Eisenberg) an undergrad at Harverd, in 2003 he collided with friend Eduardo Saverin(Andrew Garfield) to create a website called Facebook. What starts out as a college thing, soon becomes a bigger popular internet thing. It's not long before they become billionaires. And some scandal moments that will follow.David Fincher direction is brilliant since Benjamin Button. Jesse Eisenbergs performance is an Oscar gold, so was Andrew Garfield. The film manages to never to get boring, with it's witty dialog. Justtin Timberlake is terrific, so was Brenda Song who manages to breakaway from Disney. Like I said this movie is a masterpiece.",10,0,0,11 October 2010

","Set in the 1920's, Nick(Tobey MaGuire) befriends J. Gatsby(Leonardo DiCaprio), a lonely billionaire, and quickly discovers that he once romanced his cousin Daisy(Carey Mulligan), but she is now married Tom(Joel Edgerton) another billionaire. How will this end for everybody? Baz Luhrmans direction is beyond brilliant, he makes us feel like we are in that period. Tobey MaGuire is good here too, you'll forget he was once Spider Man, you are put in his shoes, you are going through everything with him. Joel Edgerton is great has Tom, he is so unlikable, that every time he's on screen you just want to smack him. Carey Mulligan is Oscar worthy has the tortured Daisy. But Leonardo DiCaprio is beyond terrific as Gatsby, You feel his loneliness, and his love for Daisy, I'm not gonna say any more but this a great movie, I hope it won't be missed by the Oscars.",10,7,12,14 May 2013

One day R and his zombie mates are attempting to eat some humans that are there get medical supplies, but the R sees a young woman named Julie(Teresa Palmer), a change starts happen to R, when he saves Julie from being eaten, but how will this end? This movie is a mixture of horror, comedy, drama, and romance, it blends all these elements well together. Nicholas Hoult is pretty memorable as R, and so was Teresa Palmer, they do have great chemistry. Rob Corddry is also as M, R's Zombie friend. If you are looking to get away from hard edge realism of The Walking Dead, then Warm Bodies is the way to go.",8,6,11,4 February 2013
Sully," Almost nothing is impossible
","in 2009 pilot Chesley Sullenberger(Tom Hanks) saved 155 passengers, by landing a damaged airplane in the Hudson River, so it would not crash. While the media is making Sully out to be a hero, but an investigation is done on Sully, on whether he made the right decision, now Sully feels if being called a hero comes to a big ?.Clint Eastwood's direction is brilliant has we the audience really get into Sully's head, and also we also feel like we are there during the plane crash scene. Plays it like we are there and it's happening for the first time. Tom Hanks really gives a great Oscar worthy performance as Sully. You'll forget he is just an actor, and believe he is Sully for real. Aaron Eckhardt is also good too. A truly great film, that I hope will not be missed by the Oscars.",10,5,8,20 September 2016

A great sports film, showing that the action does not always happen on the field. Kevin Costner is great, so was Denis Leary has the coach, who kind of has a love/hate thing with Costner. Jennifer Garner is alright, she kind of at times feels like she is in another film altogether. But still a great film non the less, and the supporting cast are great also.",10,5,11,17 April 2014
The Soloist," If you want a gritty real uplifting story, then goes see The Sololist.
","Now a lot of people are gonna say it's The Fisher King meets August Rush. But this is a true story, so the comparsions should go out the window. I half to disagree with the critics from At The Movies about this one, I was very moved by this story. The two leads Robert Downey Jr and Jamie Foxx both gave very Oscar worthy performance. They where very believable in there roles.Steve Lopez(Robert Downey Jr) a down on his luck reporter, who can't seem to get life all in order anymore, that all changes when he meets Nathaniel Ayers(Jamie Foxx) a homeless man who is a great musician. Steve becomes intrigued by Nathaniel, and does a back ground check on him. But the more Steve hangs with Nathaniel, it becomes clear that he is not all there. Steve tries to help him the best he can, will he save him, or be his down fall? A deeply moving film, that had no Hollywood's to it, it was very real, no fantasy to it. I shore this movie won't be missed by the Oscars. It had great acting and great music too.",10,2,3,29 April 2009

So Watney does his best to make the best of the rough situation he is in, while trying to find a way to make contact to earth, in hopes of a rescue, but will Watney's hope ever happen? Damon really gives quite a realistic performance, he uses every bit of emotion, and trying to keep his sanity. And all the other cast also shine too. And seeing them struggle trying to bring him home. Jeff Daniels and Jessica Chastain among the others who really great here. So was Kristen Wiig in a non funny role who didn't that bad, for what she was giving. The effects are pretty good also.",10,8,27,6 October 2015
V for Vendetta," A for Amazing, T for Terrific, E for Excellent.
","The most awesomely well done graphic novel that was brought to the big screen since Sin City. Natalie Portman and Hugo Weaving give great performances, O'h lets not forget Stephen Rea. In a future that would ask if Adolph Hitler had won the war, this is what our future would look like, a controlled world were no one is free or safe. A man wearing a Guy Fawkes mask and dressed in black calling himself V(Hugo Weaving) who has incredible speed and agility, hopes to change all that. Fighting against the evil chancellor(John Hurt) who has a Hitler like persona. One night V rescues a young Woman named Evey(Natalie Portman) from a gang rapists. But she becomes fascinated of who or whats behind the mask. V is no Batman or Superman he pretty much stands on his feet. This was quite an enjoyable film.",10,2,4,4 August 2006

","Deckard Shaw(Jason Statham) older to Owen(the villain from the last film) wants revenge on Toretto(Vin Diesel) and his gang for happened in London, and Deckard is a trained military killer and he will stop at nothing. Will Dominic and crew be able to uncover this conspiracy before it's too late? It's a sad note, that Paul Walker died during filming, although his scenes where nearly finished, there where other scenes left to film, they had a body double to stand in, and CGI Paul Walkers face. Although those scenes are pretty obvious. Paul Walker will be surely missed.Paul Walker 1973-2013Action scenes are pretty intense, in films like this you have to suspend a serious of disbelieve. Fight scenes are also great, with each film it gets amped up for the better. Vin Diesel and Jason Statham are great, and there awesome showdown is beyond epic. The other cast members get there chance to shine, nobody really stands out this time. A fight scene between Michelle Rodriguez and Ronda Rousey is quite the guilty pleasure. Like I said an action movie for people who like action movies.",9,7,15,5 April 2015
