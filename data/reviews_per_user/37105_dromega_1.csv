The Ring," The Ring: A recycled story with a let-down twist.
","The movie starts off with a highly predictable bang. It seem like this will be just another stupid 'cheap-scare' movie, with the main character acting in an idiotic fashion, wile the body-count rises (*cough* Scream *cough*).Thankfully, the viewer is spared this doom. Instead, we see the main characters rushing around in search of information in an attempt to save their lives. Meanwhile, we have yet another kid with 'supernatural vision.' Anybody seen 6th Sense, Stir of Echos, The Shining?OK, recycled plot aside it was still interesting to see how it all played out. However, they abandon the (all-be-it predictable) satisfying ending, in place of the gratuitous death and 'things-leaping-out-at-you' tactics that they started out with.Give me a break. It seems like there was a much deeper plot, but they abandoned it for a hollywoodized ending. And one that leaves you hanging, at that.I'd give it a 2/10",2,0,1,12 October 2003
