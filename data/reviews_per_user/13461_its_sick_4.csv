50 First Dates," Its the first romantic movie I gave more then a 6, and its a 10
","I love movies that make me think, so usually its science fiction movies that I enjoy the most. I never watched a romantic movie that had even the slightest chance of getting me interested. Until this one. Memento is without a doubt one of the best movies ever made, partly because the amount of ideas that the 'no new memories' problem can produce is enormous. 50 first dates takes a look at this problem from the romantic side. This intellectual spin keeps the movie interesting all the way. This love flick actually makes you put yourself in the characters shoes and think about what would you do. So although its ab love movie, I had fun almost every second of it- all I had to do is filter out the Schneider jokes (that didn't work at all, unlike his other movies). 50 first dates wasn't just a intellectual pleasure, It also moved me quite a bit. The fear of loving someone that doesn't remember loving you shook me up emotionally. So it was smart, funny and sad all at the same time. what else can you ask from a movie? for me the answer is - nothing.",10,0,0,29 May 2004
Fight Club," The best movie of all times, it is the perfect movie
","when a movie has everything- when it is smart and mysterious, funny and serious, dramatic and moving, when it also has alot to say about the life of each viewer, when it is deep, and when it burns itself in the memory forever- only then can it be called perfect. This was the first time I have seen a movie so complete, that all I thought on the way out was 'I want to see it again and again'. But no matter how many time I'll see it, I will always rememebr the first time. This is the best movie I have ever seen, without any competition.",10,0,1,23 May 2000
Sleepy Hollow," The only movie I walked out of in the middle for the last 12 years
","When I go to a movie, I expect to get at least one thing out of it. There was not one thing I could find in this one.The story was stupid and made no sense at all. If you want disgusting shots of cutting off heads, that is all you can find in this movie. Well, I don't seek such 'pleasures'.Last time I left a movie theater in the middle was 1988. I hoped it will not happen again. Well, now it did.",1,4,14,25 May 2000
Ocean's Eleven," one of the most boring movies ever
","Right from the start you know everything there is to know about the movie. I will not say much so to not give a spoiler , except that there is no spoilers to give even if I wanted to.... boring boring boring. I think I know why the ER doctor took the part- its a leading role. As to all the other stars, its really strange. Maybe they were offered other parts elsewhere if they agree, we will never know. None of them had any acting to do, and we will not even remember their parts, maybe not even that they were there. You can watch it, just dont expect anything but to pass some time. better wait for it to be on endless reruns on TV. It can surely wait.",4,0,1,13 May 2002
