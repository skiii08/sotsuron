It," Whoa...So good
","This movie is great! I was really surprised. I watched the 1990 version of the movie a long time ago, and I really enjoyed the story! When you see this movie, you are expecting something absolutely terrifying. But no, it was a thrilling, funny, good time! The movie has so many exciting moments that just has you on the end of your seat! I love the whole cast, and not one part of the movie is boring. So, if you feel like a really good time, Go see IT!",10,5,10,12 September 2017

If you're a Spiderman fan, go see this movie!",10,95,177,8 July 2017
Avengers: Infinity War," Best Superhero Movie Of All Time
","Ever since July 2017, I've been anticipating this movie. Today, April 27th, I saw it. Every second of this movie had me completely shocked!
Marvel is brilliant with every idea they come up with. Joe and Anthony Russo are so smart and they did everything the way it was supposed to be. This movie will leave you with many questions, but it will leave you wanting more. Not to mention, Thanos is the strongest villain the MCU has ever had. He's actually...Charismatic. Every single part of this movie made a Marvel fan gasp. It's THAT good. With every character that's been introduced in the MCU has a huge part in it. That's what I love about it.Go see this movie, you won't disappointed about anything. It is the best superhero movie of all time.",10,1,3,28 April 2018
A Quiet Place," Finally! A good horror movie!
","This movie was really impressive. Usually in the horror genre, it's same old demons and ghosts. But this was different. It had very good writing, casting, suspense, and acting! A good duration of the film is completely silent, (they have to use sign language to communicate) but it gives a great story still. All in all, if you love horror, go see this film and support it!",10,6,12,9 April 2018
