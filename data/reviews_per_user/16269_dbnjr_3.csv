Walk the Line," Great Acting, So-So movie
","I saw this movie last night with my girlfriend. I am a Johnny Cash fan so this was a natural choice.The movie does not develop very quickly. The movie as whole did not grab me and hold me until the end. To be honest, I was pretty much bored by the movie.I applaud Joaquin Phoenix for an outstanding portrayal of Mr. Cash. He honestly sounded quite similar to the real thing.The movie was just boring.I gave it such a high rating because of Joaquin Phoenix and Reese Witherspoon. If I was rating purely on the entertainment level of the movie, I would probably give it a 3.",5,3,12,21 November 2005
Disturbia," Pretty Strong Film
","This movie was overall very good. The only issue I have is the fact that it takes 45 minutes to build the characters Kale and Ashley, and to a lesser extent, Ronnie. I came in expecting to be jump right into the thriller it was being advertised as fairly soon into the movie. It did not do that. I also feel that it is ridiculous that so many largely quality films have to have a romantic conflict/interest in them. This movie would have lost nothing if it had removed the Kale-Ashley soap opera. However, the last 45 minutes or so was very good. Not so much scary, but definitely keeps you on the edge of your seat and your heart pounding.",7,1,5,9 August 2007
V for Vendetta," Absolutely Amazing
","I saw V a few nights ago. It has instantly moved to my Top 5 list. I do not have a single bad thing to say about this movie. I found every aspect fascinating. I have been drowned by the litany of over done premises, predictable plot, and boring acting. This movie is truly one of a kind. I will definitely buy it.The idea of a locked down city ruled with an iron fist is truly 1984-esque. I found myself wondering if that was a significant influence on the writers. Also the idea of giving out all of the masks was genius. I also loved the idea of a slighted citizen wreaking havoc in a strict society. Also, I found myself with a dumb smile after each awesome knife fighting scene. Natalie Portman was simply fantastic. Hugo Weaving pulled off another dominating behind-the-mask performance. Simply put, I LOVED IT!",10,3,6,8 August 2006
