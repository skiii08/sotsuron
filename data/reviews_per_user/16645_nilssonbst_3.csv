Blade Runner 2049," Blade sleeper
","I'm a huge fan of Blade Runner and have loved it since I saw it on VHS-tape back in the late 90s with my dad.The 2007 Final Cut on Blu Ray is a masterpiece, and the movie had a 25 year mystery that finally came to rest. It's what makes movies magical.Blade Runner 2049 is not that....I think there is a huge category of people who love Blade Runner 2049. It is the same people who love movies like 2001 A Space Odyssey or Arrival. People who 'wonder' over extremely slow movies with a heavy focus on visuals, and no real focus on story, characters or philosophy.The original Blade Runner is more similar to movies like Moon, Donnie Darko, Fifth Element and the likes, but Blade Runner is more like Stanley Kubrick's 2001. The tone is completely different, and this is a snooze fest with extremely stale characters.Ryan Gosling is boring, Harisson Ford is boring, Robin Wright is OK, Jared Leto is terrible. The movie is not about them, it's about soundless visuals. If you are deaf you will definitely enjoy the movie.The movie is dull, and like many others have said - I looked at my watch wondering when the heck this 2h 45 minute mess of a storyless, characterless movie would end?I hoped so much for the movie, but I'm sad to say that this is really, really bad.Don't bother with this one, rewatch the original instead.",1,10,20,12 October 2017
Ender's Game," Great graphics, poor and loose storytelling
","This movie... is so dumb.The first part of the movie tells a copy cat story of the ending of Independence Day and then the movie is basically the plot for Independece Day 2 '50 years later'...Enter our main character. If it wasn't for that his name is in the title I would forget his name. A couple of great actors are in this movie and all their talent is wasted - even Harisson Ford and Abigail Beslin.The main character is such a wet blanket on par with Bella in Twilight. He is supposed to be a cool commander, but he is a skinny dork. Then they spend half the movie playing Space Quidditch, and then they go on to training for battle. This 'Space Quidditch' has NOTHING to do with the actual job at hand - it is just DUMB.The Aliens they are supposed to fight we know nothing about, and we really never see them or understand what their intentions are. The Aliens in Independence Day are underdeveloped, but still classical. These are just dumber versions of the Arachnids in Starship Troopers.And then there is THE HORRIBLE ENDING!!!!!My God, the ending is SO BAD! All of a sudden the kid has a connection to the poor little aliens that he ends up completely murdering and he wants to make amends. This story relates nothing to anything.This movie is just a bunch of loose ends. It is like watching 6 different stories in the same universe with different main characters. After the movie I still don't know what it really is about.THE END?",1,1,3,6 March 2016
Life," The alien must be Superman.
","This movie is so stupid.Our well trained astronauts stand absolutely no chance against this 1 day old organism that somehow grows superhuman strength and intelligence (in spaaaace) and can survive absolutely everywhere without problems.Why not rename it to 'Astronauts vs. 1 day old (evil) Superman?' That would make a lot more sense. Everything goes wrong, and I mean everything, all until even the surprise (?) ending. The movie is truly, very bad.The casting is really what makes the movie so sad. I loved Ryan Reynolds for the 20 minutes he was in the movie - by far the best character of them all. But Gyllenhaal... this was not his best movie, what happened?The movie deserves a B-rated cast at best.Summary: can Evil baby Superman beat a couple of humans? The answer is yes.
