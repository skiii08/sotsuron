Kill Bill: Vol. 2," Pretentious
","Before I write this comment on Kill Bill 2, I must point out that I have always been a QT-fan and I looked forward to this film for many months. I wanted it to be good. I really did. For the first 20 minutes I figured to myself 'yeah, it's pretty good'. But sometimes after she escapes from the coffin and fights the other girl, I just completely lost interest. I never thought that could happen, cause KB 1 had me sitting on the edge of my seat, and I agree with whoever said that as long as QT signs his name on something everyone will praise it. But until now that has been true. Everything he has done has been great, I even liked his acting in PF and FR. I spent all of 10th grade discussing and watching pulp fictions with some friends. He made me love movies, and when he made this, it just felt like the old all of a sudden got old. The dialogue was disgustingly pretentious, the character Bill was a weak actor and I guess he is unknown because of just that. Uma did NOT prefrom well in this movie. She could give courses in overacting. I mean, the same as with QT, she has made nothing but great movies, but even in the trailer when she is driving the car, her acting is very sub-par. Facts: I looked at my watch after 20 minutes. I thought it was a joke. Like QT made a practical joke and in the end said: 'Here is the REAL movie' The use of blue color in the movie did NOT work at all. I started blinking a lot at the end, not cause when she killed Bill it was sad or her daughter made me sad, just cause I had trouble staying awake. Kill Bill 1 is one of the best movies I've seen. Kill Bill 2 is one of the worst. It's so weird when I talk to people who liked it (and there are a lot of them). I still feel like I watched another movie than them. I haven't written one of these for many years, that's how much I did not like it.",Null,0,1,17 May 2004
Lucky Number Slevin," Isn't a five on a ten-scale the worst?
","You are a 24 year old man and it's your birthday. You read about this movie called Lucky Number Slevin. People on IMDb either rave it or hate it. They call it the worst movie ever with inane writing and brilliant acting. They hate the director and love the director. They might be 12-year olds that enjoy violence or 40-year olds who love the idea of their own ideas. IMDb is the best place to go for insight into movies, the ten-scale rating gives you a hint to what a movie will be, the worst are the 6ers, but the 9ers are never good, due to the fanatics. The best can also be the 3s, but a 7.9 is almost always great.That brings us to Lucky Number Slevin. I watched after reading about it, a first for me. It was actually on my birthday. It still is my birthday. It was not a bad movie. It was not a good movie. It's, for lack of a better word, 'eeeaah' *palms moved in a clockwise and counterclockwise motion outwards at the time it is uttered*. The movie is clever, the actors are as big as they come. This could have been oceans eleven. It wasn't. The script is probably good enough and so is the directing. The problem is simply one thing.It is not long enough for me to care. If the movie added 30 minutes to explain why I should care if this boss or that boss is a boss and why the other one is. Why do main bad guys have 5 minute screen time? It actually made me tune out in the end. I knew that a twist would inevitably come, and I don't care if it's predictable, it's always a nice little surprise with a twist. Always nice if they can truly surprise you, but you have to care first. I cared about Tyler Durden, the guy from seven, the same guy from Usual Suspects, etc. Please make me care.That's all I ask of you. Other than that, good work. I love Bruce Willis. I love Josh Hartnett. Good job.",5,5,16,14 April 2006
Full Metal Jacket," The best Vietnam-film ever!!
","I think of Kubrick as the number one motion-picture-guru! In full metal jacket he showed us how one can portray the Vietnam-war in such a realistic way! He uses the extremely humorous dialogue, and blends in gruesome physical torture, as well as psychological abuse. This creates brilliant contrasts, and reinforcing the message, which is the bestiallity of the Vietnam-War. To quote Siskle&Ebert: Six thumbs up!!",10,0,0,19 February 1999
"Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels"," Best movie ever, beyond Tarantino, aside with Kubrick!!
","This is a must-see-non-American-superfunny-with-the-most-intelligent-angles-I've-ever-seen-kind-of-movie. First of all, you can't stop laughing from the genius dialouge, but the angles, the slowmotions, the performances from the cast, it has to be a sure movie of the year in 1999. You have to see this movie, even though it's a low budget British 'stew', it has to be one of the best ever!!",10,0,0,4 March 1999
War of the Worlds," Shock and awe
","Dakota is as charming as ET ever was. However, her humanism does not settle the major hangups I had watching this, the most expensive movie ever made. I haven't written many of these, but I feel that instead of telling people I didn't like the movie, I will write here why and lie and tell everyone I loved it. Cause I know everyone else will.It's Dakotas movie. I truly hope she can retire on royalties from this one. Being that this is the most expensive movie ever made, it's strange that the most price worthy asset is a little kid with a strange name. I absolutely can not avoid smiling when she does and this lifts the movie from a 2 to a 3. This brings me to my problem with the movie: It's playing on my feelings, or lack thereof, of fear of war and the chaos around it. However, as a movie, it just draws lines to the real world (as I understand both the book, the radio'show' and the previous movie all did, 1st, 2nd and cold war... at least I have been told), but it does not do anything else than terrify. Much like a cheap Koraen horror movie, where it horrifies just to horrify, I sit there, with my War Of The World popcorn and feel nothing. If anything I look slightly disconcerted up at the sky and wonder what the point of the latter two hours was. Was it so that you could impress me with special effects, was it to let us watch Tom jog with tight pants, was it to make some kind of weak political protest (casting Tim Robbins as a depraved redneck/lonely man certainly did the trick of that) or was it just to entertain? Well, for me, and who else can I speak for, it did neither of the above. It was the porn of the alien movies, the soapopera of the big budget movies. It had no purpose or answer, just some cop-outs to justify the idea of having big, bad aliens and let everyone leave with a sigh of relief. Give me the open ending of Cube or Dawn of the Dead. Give me the humanity of Randy... er..Dennis Quaid from The Day After Tomorrow. Give me a breather. Don't try to R-Kelly impress me with your blingbling-special effects. Don't be a war benefactor. Just make something that makes me feel something. You have to work for my 6 euros.And the only one who did that, was Dakota.And from now on, I will tell anyone who wants to know; 'I liked it. It was cool'",3,1,1,8 July 2005
