Hereditary," Awful story
","Satanic! This was gross and evil. If you liked the movie saw, gore like that, you may find this appealing, except added exhibits the hell of a child with a satanic mother. Just aweful. I've never screamed in a horror movie, I screamed but out of shock! I want would want more then money back is to send the message that this is not for you. I loved horror movies, this movie somehow makes them innocent in comparison as this is about hell and beheading.",1,2,6,23 December 2018
