10 Cloverfield Lane," Danger is up and down
",This is the first movie I am watching in 2016 and I wish others makes me satisfied like it . first the movie combines two major lines in the story . it is not only about a group of people that go to shelter underground and suffer there from what happens outside but there is also another trouble within keeps you in doubt all over the movie . the casting did a great job in representing their characters especially John Goodman who played the role of very mysterious man who have a history that we want to know and the director gives you small information in every scene about him which counted as a good advantage of the script of the movie . the movie deals with the characters inside and we saw the main character Mary Elizabeth who cant face her problems and that makes her feel bad about herself . this experience learns her to go beyond this and encourage her a lot which take the movie to another level and free her so I was watching a solid written characters with a lot to say without even talking . the music is OK and suitable for anxiety that covers the mode . dialogue is one the best elements of the movie . it delivers what it want simply in a few words . direction also is good and I liked the details made in the shelter and the director concentrate on the particular subject of the movie which sounds comfortable for me . the only thing that bothers me in 10 cloverfield lane was that the last 15 minutes was pretty good and it should continue a little bet to be more convincing and to give an obvious evidence for the danger attacking the country .10 cloverfield lane is interesting movie from the beginning to the end and you will not regret watching it .,8,4,7,12 May 2016
