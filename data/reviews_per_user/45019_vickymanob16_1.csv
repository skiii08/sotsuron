","Great movie to watch. I never expected the story line. I appreciate the way directer presented the movie and the way he choose the characters. When the movie started and first 8 minutes gone, i thought that this will be some terrorist related bomb finder movie. yes it is, but in a different way. though the same 8 minutes is repeated throughout the movie, the directer and actors managed us to travel throughout the movie interestingly. All the actors acted really good. Music is too good. Creation of whole new world with only time difference is a new concept i never ever come across in Hollywood movies. I lost my sleep at the night i saw the movie, thinking about the story. As a whole great movie for Sci-Fri lovers....",9,0,1,9 February 2013
