Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," I did like it but.......
","Don't get me wrong I did enjoy this film but I have one major problem with it.  I personally felt that this movie was too futuristic compared to the original trilogy.  This complaint may seem strange to some but c'mon this movie is supposed to be a prequel, not to mention that it happened 'A long time ago.......'  I just couldn't help but feel I was watching a movie taking place in the year 2520!  Granted it was visually stunning but it just didn't feel like a Star Wars movie.Personally I feel that Lucas should have concentrated on the more low tech wizardry approach displayed in the originals.  It would of lent more continuity between the films.",Null,0,0,25 May 1999
Saving Private Ryan," Try seeing it a second time.
","I went to see this film when it was first released in the US.  Like many others I was shocked and sickened at what was presented on the screen during the invasion sequence.  For the rest of the film I sat in a trance-like state, unable to comprehend what I was seeing.  I left the theartre empty and cold.  However, for the next few days, I couldn't stop thinking about it.  The movie invaded every conscience moment, and I couldn't shake the feeling that I had missed something profound.The following weekend I decided to see it again.  I'm glad I did because it was a totally different experience for me.  Symbolism plays a huge part in 'Saving Private Ryan' and most of it, along with character development, is extremely subtle.  Pay close attention to the soldiers expressions and actions and you will learn more about them then by anything that they say. Sure there were slow, boring stretches in the movie.  Spielberg intentions was for the viewer to 'experience the war', as well as can be done in a film,  from a soldiers standpoint.  How many boring moments do you think a soldier had to endure keeping watch for the enemy or snaking across the countryside?  Quite a few I suppose.  And just how chatty do you think war was?  I doubt soldiers spouted their life stories off to their fellow comrades.  And talking with WW2 vets, including my grandfather, the Germans, right or wrong, were nameless, faceless enemies.  I feel that these instances were portrayed fairly accurately in SPR.I feel this movie requires a second viewing.  It will give you a chance to remove  yourself from the violence and pay closer attention to other details.  Then compare your reactions.   I doubt that Spielberg's point of this movie was that 'war is hell'.  That analogy is too simplistic, an easy synopsis to come up with when we are presented with material that actually requires some thought.",Null,0,0,9 October 1998
Saving Private Ryan," Missing the point!
","This is in response to Tim's complaint about only seeing Americans and Germans depicted in SPR.The whole premise of this film is to depict the horrors that Captain Miller and his men had to endure before, during and after  they located  Private Ryan, leading to the fundamental question at the end of the film, something about 'earn this'.  You remember don't you?The D-Day scene opens with a caption June 6, 1944.  Omaha Beach Dog Green Sector.  Although an Allied invasion site,  according to my history books Omaha was an AMERICAN objective that resulted in over 2500 casualties.Secondly, the mission was to locate an AMERICAN Private.  I doubt that England, Canada, Austrailia or ( fill in the blanks with country of your choice ) would commit troops to locate a lost American.  As far as Russia is concerned, most of them were busy on the Eastern Front.  While the Americans were traipsing through the countryside, they were heading toward areas where they knew Americans may be, i.e.  101st Airborne rallying points, while at the same time trying to avoid armed conflict with the enemy.I'm sorry if you were insulted by the lack of representation of other Allied troops, but again this film was based on a real  American soldier, ( who was actually  tracked down by an Army Chaplain) not a British, Canadian or Australian.",Null,1,2,14 October 1998
