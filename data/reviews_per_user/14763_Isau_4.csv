"The Adventures of Priscilla, Queen of the Desert"," An okay film
","You'll either love this or you'll hate it.  There isn't really much depth to it overall, but the movie does do a fairly decent job of constructing a surreal feeling.  There are definitely scenes that drag, though, and I don't know many people who'd want to sit through this twice.",8,0,3,11 February 1999
Fargo," Over rated
","This could have been a great movie but the completely irrelevant sub plots and a ton of scenes that should have been edited out because they did nothing but slow the film down make it almost unwatchable.  While the acting is above par, the movie is so slow that many viewers may stop caring about them altogether.  Ultimately this movie is like a piece of modern art, artistically savvy but boring and generally unappealing.",6,0,1,14 June 1999
Dreamgirls," Half of a Great Musical
","Dreamgirls is half of a great musical. The first 50 minutes are wonderfully choreographed, sung, and acted. Everything moves along at a breathtaking pace.But then something strange happens. Screen time that had previously been shared between the 3 'Dreams' begins to force the best of the performers, Tony award winner Anika Noni Rose, into the background. More and more attention becomes focused on the very bland Beyonce/Deena character. Beyonce has the voice and is great in the dance numbers, but falls flat during her dramatic scenes. It doesn't help that the ballad she is forced to share with Jamie Fox/Curtis is one of the weakest songs from the stageplay.Jennifer Hudson is slightly more tolerable in the role of Effie. Her singing is fantastic, but (despite the Oscar win) she doesn't have the acting chops to pull off the dramatic scenes that come late in the film. This is unfortunate, because she's great in the opening numbers.Working hard to save the film are Rose and an outstanding Eddie Murphy. But, sadly, Rose/Lorrell's Ain't No Party number does not appear in the film at all, apparently to prevent her from outshining the other girls. It's unfortunate, because leaving that number in, and cutting back on some of the slow, poorly acted drama we're forced to view would make the film dramatically more watchable.My final score: 6/10",6,1,1,22 February 2008
Cube," Good for those who can swallow it
",This is a good movie for those people who can see past the obvious storyline and into the possibilities the movie sets up through its intentional vagueness.  It is however a very very bad movie for people who expect an omniscient POV of the goings-ons in a film.  This is definitely a movie without a guard rail; you are constantly expecting someone to get killed and wincing every time the characters enter a new room.  The irony at the end of the film is notable too..,9,0,0,8 June 1999
