The Twilight Saga: Breaking Dawn - Part 1," A Well-Done Movie
","Breaking Dawn Part 1 is an enjoyable adaptation of the first part of the book. Screenwriter Melissa Rosenberg did a good job overall.The photography and CGI were excellent, and they were better than the previous Twilight movies. There are a lot of beautiful pictures, and the wolves are more realistic than ever.The performances were better than ever. Kristen Stewart was wonderful. Taylor Lautner and the others were also very good.The weakest part of the movie was the struggle within the wolf pack. It would have been better to rely on narration, to just tell us what happened, rather than try to show it.The music was also very good.",Null,2,9,24 November 2011
