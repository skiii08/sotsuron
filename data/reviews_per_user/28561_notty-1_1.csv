Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," Great adventure...
","This movie isn't nearly as bad as people say it is.  Yes, - Jar Jar is annoying- but so what.  The good elements of the film out-weigh out the bad. The heavy emphasis on the Jedi/Sith is really interesting.  Breathtaking lightsaber duels.  Looking forward to Attack of the Clones.",Null,0,0,14 March 2002
