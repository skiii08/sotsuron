10 Cloverfield Lane," Enjoyed it
","Howard, played well by John Goodman, rescues Michelle, played perfectly by current scream queen Mary Elizabeth Winstead, from a car crash. He brings her to his underground doomsday bunker where he tells her everyone else is dead due to some unknown nuclear or bio-chemical attack. The only other inhabitant in the bunker is Emmett, played by John Gallagher Jr. from 'The Newsroom', who helped build the bunker and was lucky enough to make it there just before Howard locked it for good. The rest of the movie unfolds while you, Michelle and Emmett try to figure out if Howard is bats*&t crazy or has really saved the day with his bunker. This leads to some well formulated but somewhat predictable encounters and twists with Howard.It was a fun movie and had some truly creepy and edge of your seat moments. I preferred the psychological thrills as opposed to the straight up scares but both aspects were delivered well if a little by the numbers. Like most horror/thrillers, it's probably best viewed with a large audience and it almost certainly won't be as good on the home screen. I didn't see the original Cloverfield but the word of mouth from my friends at the time of its release was something like 'sucked', and 'the hand-held cameras made me sick.' There's no hand-held footage in this movie so don't let that deter you and it was definitely worth the price of admission. Special shout out to Bear McCreary for the score. For those who don't know, he does the music for 'The Walking Dead', 'Black Sails' and several other recent projects. He's become sort of the new Danny Elfman.If there's a sequel ... I'm in.",7,1,3,18 March 2016
Spider-Man: Homecoming," Fun, worth more than the ticket price, but still waiting for the Homerun
","Great casting with Holland and Keaton, but I honestly wanted more scenes with Keaton. Awesome to see him as a super villain. The villain gets plenty of screen time but a lot of it is the vulture character and Keaton was at his best out of costume. Passable story line. With 12 credited writers, this felt a bit like a patchwork of ideas, some that worked for me and some that didn't. Some of the best scenes were the comedy. Some of the CGI action looked a little jerky to me, in that way that all the other Marvel action looks. Loved that they took the character back to high school. Didn't 'feel' the chemistry between him and the girl so some of that drama fell flat. They could have toned down Parkers 'spaz' moments just a little.See it.",7,2,8,7 July 2017
X-Men: Apocalypse," Passable but not as good as First Class and Days of Future Past
","Younger versions of the Xmen come together to battle the most powerful mutant in the world, who has been trapped and sleeping since 3500 BC. For me, going to the movies is always a fun night out, but this wasn't necessarily a fun movie. There are some great sequences and some yawn inspiring dialogue... 'Use your Powers!' Some really good acting gets lost in poor camera angles and cinematography.The editing and direction seem to weigh down what was probably a decent script. There was probably a better movie there, but the editor didn't find it. This movie suffers from the same meandering that plagued Last Stand. The over-use of CGI, especially in the final battle sequence didn't help either. Characters that are wasted: Magneto, Angel, Jubilee, Havoc and definitely Jean Grey. Characters that shine, Apocalypse, Cyclops, Quicksilver(when he's not spouting awkward dialogue). Worst chemistry between James Mcavoy and Rose Byrne, surprising given how well they worked in First Class. It's worth seeing just for a few standout sequences though, especially another great quicksilver rescue and a psychic battle of the minds. Miscellaneous thought, the opening night 3D viewing I attended at 730pm was almost empty.",6,2,8,28 May 2016
Midsommar," Genre defying or just lost and unclassiffiable?
","In spoiler free short summary, a woman grieving for the loss of her entire family accompanies her boyfriend and his anthropology studies group to Sweden, invited by a member of the group, to partake in his village's solstice ritual. They first witness, then become unwilling participants in, some DEEPLY disturbing rituals. Oh...and there's a bear. Sadly there's not much more to it than that. People will try to explain the film as metaphors of grief, relationships and entitlement etc. but if that was what the story intended, the metaphors were too deeply buried in the subtext for me to process them during my viewing. I will spend some time trying to figure out how a film so well acted, so beautifully filmed and so atmospheric failed to deliver a fulfilling experience.Being a fan of Hereditary, I was looking forward to this for some time. I saw it in a packed theater on a Tuesday night opening, and I assume it was packed on the strength of Hereditary, which I consider the best horror film of the last 10 years. Midsommar is daring and ambitious but unfortunately this film did not deliver the same satisfaction and I could spend hours/days trying to analyze why.This is definitely not a film for the masses, although the grotesque scenes alone may garner enough word of mouth to draw in the curious. It may even become obligatory viewing for anyone who enjoys cult movies. Some scenes were so hard to process that the audience I was with often laughed innapropriatly to clear the air. There were other times that scenes of horror were presented so comically I could not help but chuckle under my breath. I find it hard to believe that is what the director intended. Despite my disappointment, Ari Astor has such complete control of his films, I cannot wait for the next one. The studio,A24, was bold to back this film and I hope they continue to put their faith in Mr. Astor.I would definitely not allow anyone under 16 to see it.

Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice," The adaptation you've been waiting for... Spoiler Free
","I enjoyed Man of Steel even though I critiqued it for lacking the 'heart' of the original Superman movies. It felt more like good science fiction than a hero movie. I loved the plot and the visual style but there was no sense of emotion from Superman, probably due to his noticeably reduced role in the story. Although its a darker movie than Man of Steel, Dawn of Justice fixes those minor but glaring flaws and its a much better story for it. Ben Affleck and Henry Cavil bring the passion that was lacking from the last movie. Jessie Eisenberg's Lex Luther is a more interesting foil for the duo than Zod was and the supporting cast does a great job... Supporting.This movie also fixes a complaint I heard often about Man of Steel... The long sometimes frantic fight sequences. The sequences in this movie seem to be, dare I say it, an adequate length. They also have a sense of scope and realism that the frantic camera-work in Man of Steel had trouble conveying. I enjoyed having Wonder Woman in the story and Gal Gadot is definitely up to task but if I have any complaint about this movie it's that she feels a little shoe-horned in to the plot, but it's an adequate intro to the DC movies coming soon.Overall, I think its the best adaptation fans could have hoped for given the source material. DC and Zack Snyder have definitely created a tone that sets their brand apart from Marvel and thats a good thing, although it may be a little dark for the children that love the Marvel movies so much.",8,2,7,25 March 2016
