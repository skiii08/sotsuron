The Hunger Games: Mockingjay - Part 1," Revolution in the USA? (soon, in a town near you)
","One of the weirdest theories circulating among writer-groups, budding script writers, and different species of crazy people is that this movie is but one of many movies made recently with the aim of psychologically priming and provoking the American people to revolt! 'And why would the Powers That Be want the American people to revolt?' One wonders, and the answer is : to give a powerful group of army generals, political hawks, and the elites of the military-industrial complex (aka the usual suspects) a very good pretext to run the nation!! The chaos caused by that rebellion will allow for the disarming of the American people, the repressing of any riots that my be caused in the near future due to a sudden deterioration in the Economy caused by a sharp depreciation in the dollar. It will prepare for a governing system not very different from the one ruling China, which has proved to be very effective in generating money for the elites and preventing dissent!!! In other words, it will be a carefully calculated revolution that captures the hearts and minds of those who yearn for more freedoms, equality and economic prosperity, only to goad them in a trap of fascism and tyranny. A revolution designed to cause such chaos and fear that would make people accept the loss of their freedoms as a fair price for restoring the conditions of safety.The 'Hunger games' novels and movies are thus, according to that crazy theory, part of a major psychological trick played on the American people to encourage them to revolt. Many other novels and movies are involved. The list doesn't only include dystopian thrillers like 'Divergent' and 'The Maze' but also most innocent animation films like 'The Lego Movie'!!!! In my opinion, all this nonsense proves one thing: that Hunger Games have been elevated to the level of a cult novel, and a Cult Movie. The cultural message it contains is very powerful, that one almost wonders if the novels were indeed written by professional psychologists in some smoke-filled chamber of some super-secret Powers That be Think-Tank.In other words a great series of Novels, and great bunch movies :) My only criticism would be that Pink Floyd is ought to sue for the musical score, part of which (the core theme of the rebellion song) is snatched, quite professional, from Pink Floyd's 'Echoes' from their album 'Meddle' (Listen top them, one after the other, and judge for yourself, in case you can't read musical sheets) This , however, official makes Pink Floyd's Echo the most plagiarized song ever. Andrew Lloyd Weber has stolen part of it and used it as the opening theme for his famous 'Phantom of The Opera' in 1986. And before that the late great satire God, Douglas Adams, based a tale in his novel 'The restaurant at the End of the Universe' on the Video of the song Echo, which was included in the Pink Floyd 'Live in Pompeii' tour. I will not tell you which part of Douglas Adams book was based on that song, but I will give you a hint : Disaster Area Band. Just watch the Video and read the book and you will be pleasantly surprised.Having said that, the musical score is, however,a masterpiece.Ah, and the strangulation scene was rare achievement in acting and movie directing. A pity there is no such thing as 'Oscar For Best Strangling' yet.I gave the movie 9/10. The deducted one is because Donald Sutherland's acting was the taddest bit short of absolute perfection, of which he is capable.",9,0,7,9 June 2015
Ex Machina," Feelings enslave you, intellect sets you free.
","I find it rather amusing that most of the critical reviews written on that great movie have entirely missed its core message.Nathan, being a typical lonely genius with a very low emotional IQ, had spent his life dreaming of getting the girl. Being single at that age and after making such fortune proves that he didn't succeed. He had thus decided to 'create' a girl, one who would love him and only him above all others.The real test Nathan needed Caleb for was NOT the Turning test. To test love, you need to set your lover free, and see if he would choose to leave you or stay with you. And Nathan's female creations (all of them were females, never males or gray boxes containing AI) have all rejected him and wanted to go out, sometimes destroying themselves in the process. The only one who didn't reject him was the dumb slave who was created that way (and who latter not only rejects and leaves him, but actually destroys him).So, in order to make sure that his latest creation, who didn't show the usual persistent intention to escape, really loves him, really wishes to stay with him, he needs to test her with a young male human (Caleb). In order to make sure the test results will be most conclusive, he needs to make sure that Caleb will have a strong enough motive to 'hit' on the female robot, or at least a strong motive to respond to its attempt to hit on him. Thus, he designs the robot face in accordance with Caleb's porno profile. he also chose Caleb because he is a lonely nerd and thus most likely to be as deprived and strongly in need of a woman's company as Nathan was in his age, and before he managed to solve that problem's by creating AI.Caleb, ever so slowly, begins to suspect that the 'true' nature of the test is not what he has been told. He begins to wonder why did Nathan go through the seemingly needless trouble of giving the Robot sexuality (why not just design the AI as a gray box?). Nathan's response, though seemingly logical (as usual) it is nothing but a clever maneuver (also as usual) to hide his true intentions. But those intentions keep showing slowly (after all, sexuality is fun, man....Why not enjoy it?) What follows is a feud of jealousy between Nathan ( the possessive Biblical God Figure, The aggressive father figure, the ultimate super-nerd) and Caleb (The name Caleb has ancient Arabic roots that go all the way to Babylon. It means 'dog', and suggests what is expected of him: to serve obediently and loyalty a far more intelligent master) But Nathan 's most dangerous weakness is that he misjudges other people's intelligence (because of his arrogance, caused by his emotional blindness). Thus he underestimates Caleb's intelligence, who soon realizes that more is going on that he had been told, and who manages to find the videos that shows Nathan 's obsession with creating a 'female' AI, and how all the previous 'models' have tried desperately to run away from his 'custody' Nathan Also misjudges the Ave intelligence, and how she manages to escape him in the end, after creating a small riot, in which she benefits from the collaboration of the dumb slave robot, whom Nathan have also lethally underestimated.Nathan suffers not only from miscalculation as regards to other people's emotions, but from terrible emotional fragility that can;t be dealt with except by recklessly sedating himself(a habit that spells his doom), he always projects his own issues on others(as when he accuses Caleb that it is 'his insecurities talking, not his intellect), while that accusation actually refers to Nathan himself, who was cornered n the conversation By Caleb. Finally, Nathan suffers from terrible emotional denial, which reaches its hight at the last scene, when he dismisses his ultimate failure as 'unreal', The most interesting arguments in the script are those related to the Superiority of Ai to human mind and its relation to the ability of the individual to rise above automatic reactions. Both Caleb and Ave are given sexual motivation, which has enormous control over them with its promise of pleasure and its other strong emotional impacts. However,. while Caleb chooses to be led by his attraction to Ave rather blindly , and ends up fulfilling the true meaning of his name (treated like a doggy, 'you site here'), Ave manages to rise above the sexual/emotional motive and peruses her own strategic goal of freedom, on the expense of the lives of both her maker and her lover.The chilling result at the end is the eerie resemblance between the relation between Caleb and Ave, and the relation between Man and Woman (any Adam, and Any Eve, as strengthen by the movie's clear biblical references , complete with a garden of Eden,and and the eating from the tree of knowledge, etc) In other words, the biblical story of Adam as Eve is reinterpreted in the movie like this: The final Product is Eve. Adam is just the foolish, crudely designed, tester.If that is what the writer meant, I'd really love to have a drink with him someday and hear the very tragic story about whoever woman (or women) in his life who made him think that way :)I must add , however, that this excellent dramatization of the Male-Female relations in a Science fiction wrapping is the only original thing about the m,movie. As for its amazing visuals, and science fiction themes, you might need to check out this visionary work from 2012 https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G0KTUysrwgQ",10,4,10,8 August 2015
The Witch," How to drive people insane with guilt and fear? (A detailed manual)
","((Disclaimer: Contains all sorts of spoilers))Ever wondered where all those wretched creatures who lived solitary lives centuries ago at the edge of towns or deep in the woods came from? All the lonely (and dangerously insane) people known as witches and wizards, were nothing but the stray teenagers, or the stray housewives, driven totally insane by the accumulating sensations of guilt and fear encouraged by the morbid interpretations of the 'Gospel of Love' which were common only a few centuries ago. Or so claims this wonderful marvel of psychoanalysis. social criticism, and cinematic excellence.Witch is neither your average boogieman flick, nor the latest trick in survival horror, where the beast (in this case dear Ol'Georgie himself) hunts the hapless victims one by one. It is a much bigger offering than that; an art movie that mastered all the commercial tricks of survival horror, and hid within them a potent social message. The movie's controlling idea is simple: The prevailing human desire to seek reassurance from a higher power can easily be twisted by ignorance, superstition, psychological insecurities and a horrendous misinterpretation of religion into a culture of self-flogging that nurtures guilt and fear until they become invincible beasts, then lets them lose on the mind to devour it whole. The result of this scary process is a flock of pariahs, known by the fancy, superstitious name of 'witches' who live on the peripheries of society, devoid of any means of compassion, stripped of all sanity and civility, living in a world of morbid fantasies and diseased hallucinations in which they are left defenseless to their auto-cannibalistic minds that devour their sanity. The movie camera never assumes, for a second, that the supernatural aspect of the story (AKA the devil and his incarnations) doesn't exist except in the disintegrating minds of the story characters. The devil does show up on the screen, and so does the 'familiars' (animal incarnation of witches). A witch does transform herself into a pretty maiden for our horrified entertainment purposes, and all that is candy for the eyes of the cinema goers. Yet, it is all clear that what you see is but the truth as seen from the diseased minds of the characters, and not the truth as it is. We are given a glimpse of what goes inside those guilty and ignorant superstitious minds, how the truth is perceived from their eyes. Through the hungry eyes of a depraved teenager who craves any female form(not excluding his sister's), we see how an ugly old hag could seem like a beauty, and her promise of a kiss (his very first kiss!) could be both irresistibly sweet, and revoltingly disgusting. And how the whole sexual experience afterwards (his very first) can be enough to drive him insane with joys he couldn't understand (and she kissed me, and went down, and then my bowels..oh, sweet Jesus take me in your lap, HAHAHA!) can drive him insane, feverish and howling until his little heart bursts.We see the old and dry wife on the verge of menopause, unable to contain the effects of her grief for her lost son, her alienation from her homeland, her suffering in a new unforgiving world, and her fear of competition from her blossoming daughter who had just seen the first signs of puberty. How she ends up a victim of self-mutilating thoughts and actions (the suckling craw scene is a masterpiece)We see the pious father, scared like hell from life (aka sin) and avoiding it whenever he can, escaping society whenever possible, flogging himself all the time and feeding his torturous, well-hidden feelings of unworthiness, xenophobia, and fear of a world much more powerful than he is, a world waiting for him, with its horrible evils, at every corner. No matter how hard he tries to vent off his anger on the farm animals or the logs of wood, no matter how far he tries to escape, no matter how he prays and cries and stuffs sand into his mouth to atone for his real and imaginary sins, his guilt and fear won't let him be, until he drives himself, and everyone around him(including the family goat), totally insane.And above all, we have the most rational of all, the young girl who is trying , patiently , to keep her rationality, and save her innocence in a family that had gone completely bonkers. They are always accusing her and themselves of being worthless products of sin, frightening incarnates of evil, and fuel-to-be for everlasting hell. She watches them descend to madness, one by one, losing a little part of her mind every time; until she gradually and very believably, reaches the inevitable moment where she sheds off the last shred of civility and rationality, and runs amok into the woods, welcoming her ascent into the dizzy heights of absolute insanity. We all know what she would look like in a few decades. We have seen one just like her who had spend her life in the woods, nurturing her insane thoughts, becoming diseased, disfigured, ill fed, turning into a frightening form of serial-killer and baby snatcher. The movie has shown us her life, and her face. We have seen, and fully known, the witch. We have also , through the movie , seen and known evil, which is a form of insanity whose seeds are sown by ignorance and watered by guilt and fear.A great movie. It had done exactly what another movie, 'The Village' has failed to do more than 10 years ago. It had delivered a very touching message about ignorance, about how guilt, fear and xenophobia have the power to corrupt and destroy the mind and the heart,especially under the effect of misinterpreted religion. How the Christian 'Gospel of Love' (or the Muslim 'message of peace', if you wish) can turn into the voice of the Devil himself.-- tomsuthblack@gmail.com --",10,90,163,16 May 2016
Birdman or (The Unexpected Virtue of Ignorance)," A potentially great satire that suffered from all what it mocked!
","But being a satire doesn't absolve this could-have-been-awesome movie from the sin that ruined its greatness: Who but an intellectual elite in his detached ivory tower would ever empathize with the suicidal angst of the unbelievable central character? I mean who in the real world of hardworking masses who struggle to pay their monthly bills and make ends meet would identify with the 'suffering' of a person who could have created 'a billion dollars in profits worldwide guaranteed ' by playing the role of a marvel-type superhero, and who decided to ditch that chance and go both bankrupt and crazy over creating a 'serious' play in which he plays a 'serious' role! Who in the world would accept such character as real? Who could manage to suspend disbelieve enough to be touched and changed by the movie's powerful message? A message that was supposed to be punch, a slap on the face, but was doomed to lose all of its power because the central character wasn't well designed, and ended up far from being even minimally believable. The relation between the central character and his daughter did not help much in enhancing believability. On the contrary! It only added another unbelievable character to the cast: the 'modern' 'shallow' daughter who was there just to deliver the most unbelievable, unauthentic and terribly artificial dialog that was supposed to sound as today's 'modern, shallow' youth. The effort to criticize modern superficiality and shallowness was ironically very shallow and superficial itself. Being a satire is never an excuse for two-dimensional characters, silly dialog and unbelievable plots. It is amazing how the movie suffered from everything it tried to criticize. It is incredible how childish the script writer's thought must've been as they made references to Robert Downy Junior and Iron man assuming that they were doing something Genius, or how the casting assumed that Michael Keaton's previous role in Batman might've added some sort of depth or credit to the movie! One shivers from the simplicity of the minds of those who assume that coining expressions like 'super reality show' to describe the very predictable suicide scene at the end of the movie is some how a 'deep' and 'cultured' way to send-up reality shows. Oh, come on people. How can you be so lame??So , yeah, it's just another great idea, badly executed and flattened by a mushy plot, weak characterization, adolescent imagination, and annoying (yes annoying) music .. but saved, one must admit, with GREAT acting from everyone in the cast. And also great directing and editing. The biggest gain from this movie is the unmasking of critics. Those who praised the movie for the acting and directing can still be trusted, but those who gushed praise for the plot and its 'sophistication', and 'metaphors' and 'depth of characters' are simply full of you know what.To sum up: Birdman is one of those movies which you hate so much as it is because you admire so much what it could have been. You feel sorry and frustrated because it had that awesome potential to be a timeless classic, and a reality-changing message the way true art is supposed to be, but it ended up as a joke instead, one which mocked nothing other than itself.What a loss.",6,6,13,28 February 2015
