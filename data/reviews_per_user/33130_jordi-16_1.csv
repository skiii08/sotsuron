The Blair Witch Project," Nothing but Hype
","I honestly can't believe this movie impressed anybody. I tried on three separate occasions to finish watching it, but I was so annoyed by the stupidity of the 'characters' that couldn't. As far as I can tell, the only reason anybody would like it is because of all the hype, and I can't tell where that's coming from. A bunch of adolescents go out in the woods, get lost because they don't know what they're doing, and scream at each other. That's not entertainment, that's the worst of American culture broadcast at full volume. If your IQ hovers around that of a 12 year old, you might find something interesting. Just out of curiosity, I wonder if the same people who liked this movie also enjoyed Pearl Harbor--another movie I put in the same category of junk.",1,1,3,24 October 2003
