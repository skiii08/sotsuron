Iron Man 3," Amazing movie but not perfect...
","Iron Man 3 was a movie I was EXTREMELY looking forward to. The trailers were amazing and The Avengers was really awesome! This movie lived up to my expectations but was it perfect? Well short answer no, but it is very close to perfect. The acting was amazing from all of the cast. Robert Downey Jr will always be the best Iron Man! Don Cheatle, Ben Kingsley, Guy Pearce and Gwyneth Paltrow were also amazing. The special effects were great and the action was really awesome. There was a certain twist that ruined the movie for some people but not for me :) The only problem I had with the movie was that I thought the whole Extremis plot could have been scrapped. It served not much to the story. Another small issue was that I wish Ben Kingsley would be in it more :( But overall it is very amazing and I think older children will LOVE it!",7,0,2,3 June 2013
