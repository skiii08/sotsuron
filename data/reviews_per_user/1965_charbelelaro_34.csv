Blade Runner 2049," This film ticks every single box
","Blade Runner 2049 directed by the master Denis Villeneuve is the sequel to the 1982 Blade Runner by Ridley Scott. This film ticks every single box. The cinematography by Roger Deakins is astounding. Every single shot in this movie is magnificent. This is the best looking movie I have ever seen. The screenplay is smart, creative and so unexpected, I was very impressed by the writing. Also the performances, mainly by Ryan gosling and Harrison Ford, were flawless. For a film set within a dystopian concrete city, it contains such strong emotion and deep social commentary at its core. Unfortunately I felt the runtime should have been shorter, so on rewatch, having seen the amazing visuals already, it may drag at times. Therefore I give Blade Runner 2049 a 9.",9,0,15,2 April 2019
Vertigo," Simply incredible
","Vertigo directed by Alfred Hitchcock is a crime drama which surrounds one retired detective who is asked to take on one last task. The task is to follow his college friend's wife due to her recent bizarre behaviour. And from that point the audience is taken on such a captivating and unexpected journey. Vertigo is simply incredible. Everything in the film is still outstanding. The cinematography, music, acting and script are some of the best ever. What I love particularly is how unpredictable it is. The movie takes such incredible turns, which really compels the audience even further. The sinister tone of the movie is so magnetic, as the feelings and emotions remain with you beyond the credits. The film ends with such a high, confirming why it is one of the most memorable movie experiences in history. My only issue is the first act, which at times can feel quite slow due to that fact that audience doesn't have that emotional attachment to the characters and story yet. Although the film progresses and builds brilliantly. Vertigo will forever be timeless so therefore I give it a 9.",9,2,3,4 April 2018
It," I can't help but commend how well made the film is
","IT directed by Andres Muschetti is a film adaptation based off the Steven King novel. First and foremost, this movie is directed beautifully. The cinematography and editing is prefect. Also the film sets in the film look incredible, particularly the abandoned house. The performances by these early teenage actors were so entertaining and very real. As for issues, I felt the first 2 acts were a little slow in setting up the characters and their personal fears. The film sort of goes into a repetitive pattern showing each character's fear one by one after each other. Although by the third act the film really picks up, with Pennywise the clown giving a spectacular and horrifying performance. Many critics dislike the film, as they believe it's basically not scary enough. Although as for me I can't help but commend how well made the film is so therefore I give IT an 8.",8,1,1,2 April 2019
Rogue One: A Star Wars Story," Some of the best action sequences in the Star Wars series
","Rogue One: A Star Wars Story, is directed by Gareth Edwards and takes place between episodes 3 and 4 of the Star Wars series. This film is highly entertaining, as it contains some of the best action sequences in the Star Wars series. At moments the CGI is jaw dropping. Visually this movie is great. Also the storyline is quite interesting, as explains unknown information which leads to what occurs in episode 4. The characters were likeable and well acted, although they were not given enough depth. The audience knows little to nothing about most characters and it really makes it hard to connect and feel for them at times. Also the score by Michael Giacchino sounds a little rushed at times as he was only given 4 weeks to write the music. I feel that there could have been more creative sounds based around the themes by John Williams. Overall I really enjoyed Rogue One. It's a film that really entertained me, particularly in the 3rd act. It's no where near the best Star Wars film, so therefore I give it a 7.",7,6,7,2 April 2019
Zootopia," Somehow it really works
","Zootopia directed by Byron Howard and Rich Howard, is a Disney animation which explores serious societal issues through the fun adventure of a rabbit and a fox... And yes, somehow it really works. This movie is so smart and creative as it addresses issues such as diversity and gender stereotypes in such an engaging way. So many animations these days are purely just dumb moments that will keep a child quiet for 90 minutes. Although Zootopia is equally engaging for both adults and children due to how well written it is. Something that is over looked is just how incredibly hard it is to write a great screenplay for an animation. And zootopia absolutely nailed it, including everything from a smart story to moments which are hilarious for everybody. This movie would have surprised a lot of people, myself included, so therefore I give it a 9.",9,3,3,2 April 2019
Home Alone," Home Alone will forever be a Christmas classic
","Home Alone directed by Chris Columbus is easily the best Christmas comedy ever made. Growing up with this film means there's definitely a sentimental love for it. But upon recent viewing I can really see why this movie has been loved for decades. The writing, casting and direction is prefect. Home Alone is such a well made film. The performances are some of the best in the genre. The script is so compelling with its successful humour and authentic line delivery. One thing that makes this movie so memorable is the outstanding score by John Williams. He captures everything from the Christmas spirit to moments of serious tension. This movie also contains such a deep message around family with necessary character arcs, which are able to relate to both adults and children. Home Alone will forever be a Christmas classic so therefore I give it a 9.",9,3,4,2 April 2019
Thor: Ragnarok," This film is straight out awesome
","Thor Ragnarok directed by Taika Waititi, is the third instalment based on this Marvel character. The prior films have taken a more serious approach in relation to the fictional world based in Asgard. Although this film is a totally fresh, comedic and vibrant take on this significant character. Taika Waititi's style definitely comes through, as this is easily the most hilarious Marvel movie ever made. This film contains a perfect balance of light hearted moments as well as strong intensity which really compels the audience to feel genuine care for the characters. Creating that balance is incredibly difficult, although Thor Ragnarok does it perfectly. This film is straight out awesome. There are action sequences which genuinely blew my mind from awesomeness. Waititi utilises music in such a brave way. Most films don't integrate existing songs into pivotal moments, although it turly pays off with Thor. Everything in this film is so memorable, as it subverts the heavy seriousness of superhero films, creating the most enjoyable cinematic experience of 2017. Thor Ragnarok is now one of my all time favourites in the genre so therefore I give in a",9,2,4,4 April 2018
Star Wars: Episode VI - Return of the Jedi," It doesn't hold up as well as the previous two
","Star Wars Episode VI: The Return Of The Jedi, is directed by Richard Marquand, and is the last of the original trilogy. This film isn't perfect, and it doesn't hold up as well as the previous two. This is mainly due to the overuse of CGI in certain scenes, which really removes the viewer today. Also the direction doesn't compare to The Empire Strikes Back, which is shown purely by the difference visually between the films. Also certain plot points are quite silly and pointless particularly the Ewoks which seem to be added as a selling point for children. On the other hand there are great moments in The Return Of The Jedi. Some of which include the space action sequences, and also the powerful character foil between Darth Vader and Luke. The climatic moment in the movie builds to be very intense, although it is resolved way too easily. Character decisions and epiphanies happen so abruptly, that it does not feel realistic. All in all as a trilogy, it is one of the best in history. Star Wars: The Return Of The Jedi is not a terrible film, but it is the weakest in the trilogy so therefore I give it a 7.",7,0,0,2 April 2019
Suicide Squad," Completely bland and did not entertain me in the slightest
","Suicide Squad supposedly directed by David Ayer, is a film that experienced a large amount of issues with its production. From studios getting involved to the director almost leaving, I'm surprised this movie had slight coherence. To say the least after watching this movie I was angry. This movie is the definition of false advertising as multiple scenes in the trailer did not appear in the film. Mainly the joker who had little to no screen time. Everything from the action sequences to the characters were completely bland and did not entertain me in the slightest. And Cara Delevingne as the villain... why. There were two decent things about this film being Margot Robbie and Will Smith who gave convincing performances, so therefore I give DC's Suicide Squad a 2. This film was incredibly hyped for such a long period of time with so much marketing. Focus on the actual film next time DC.",2,1,1,2 April 2019
"Three Billboards Outside Ebbing, Missouri"," brilliant performances, but unfortunately mechanical characters
","Three Billboards Outside Ebbing Missouri is directed by Martin McDonagh and is nominated for a shocking 7 Academy Awards. Let's start with the positives. The lead actress is beyond oscar worthy. Woody Harrelson has a strong performance. Lucas Hedges was great also. This made it a pretty entertaining film overall. Now for the negatives. People see strong political ideology surrounding current social controversy in a film and immediately need to praise the life out of it. To me I don't consider this a film. It's merely social commentary with great performances. Although I'm going to put that aside and attempt to focus on the film making. Looking at the screenplay and aspects of the story, I found countless issues. There are plot holes, ridiculous character arcs, and minimal growth from our lead character. To prove as to how, I will need to describe the plot, so spoilers ahead. There is a scene where a drunk cop beats a guy, and literally throws him out the window. The cop is then fired, and then just sits at home all day afterwards. Why wasn't he arrested? He beat him up in front of a crowd of people. Anyways this same cop returns to the police station after hours one night. However he's unaware that somebody is throwing glass bottles, setting the police station on fire because he's listening to opera music with head phones in. WHAT! Can someone please buy me these head phones, that can literally block out the sound of fire blazing explosions. This cop then goes to hospital due to his burns, and happens to be next to the guy he threw out the window. They then reconcile with the window guy pouring him a cup of orange juice. I'm sorry but I'm either insensitive or that guy should become a saint. But on top of all these unrealistic plot choices, there's constant attempts of some sort of humour. It actually kills me inside. The humour is honestly like what you would get out of a really bad kids animation, but put in a movie about murder. For example, the scene where the cop gets fired he's asked to hand in his badge. This scene is built up quite seriously, although then like some hilarious punchline the cop is like, 'oh I can't find it', and spends 5 minutes emptying out all his pockets with awkward silence. Oh but what was even worse was the ex husband's 19 year old girlfriend. She just tanks every scene she interrupts. I'm confused as to why this won best screenplay at Golden Globes. Okay some of the dialogue is great, but there are so many careless issues in the story. The tone in this film is messy and inconsistent, resulting in a movie experience with character's I didn't care about. The in-cohesive story writing is buried beneath great performances and a whole lot of social commentary. That is why people love the film. Critics are neglecting the importance of film making. It's a shame that this will probably win best picture. Movies like Dunkirk don't stand a chance, even though the film making is some of the best ever. But because it doesn't make any bold political statements relating to current controversial issues, it won't get the major awards. Three Billboards lacks emotional weight due to how disconnected it is from relatable human nature. Films like Good Will Hunting are incredible because of how they realistically zone in on the individual. Three Billboards forgets to take its time on smaller moments of pain and heartbreak, which humanise the characters. Making us feel emotionally attached to them. Movies like Good Will Hunting, which do that end up saying a whole lot more about humanity. This movie was a colossal disappointment. The character arc for the racist, drunk cop is so weak. He gains such easy redemption for all his wrong doings, without repairing any of his damage. For a movie with a strong message surrounding female empowerment and civil rights, it ends up showing sympathy towards a racist white supremacist cop as well as contributes to religious intolerance. If you want to see the ramifications of holding onto hate, watch American History X. The entire message of that film is that hate is hopeless baggage. Three Billboards attempts to show this with brilliant performances, but unfortunately mechanical characters. So therefore I give Three Billboards Outside Ebbing Missouri a 5. It's so important to see characters authentically grow in film, otherwise it feels like nothing moves forward. And if that was the whole point of this movie, what's its purpose?",5,2,4,4 April 2018
Incendies," This movie is amazing
","Incendies Directed by Denis Villeneuve is a foreign film with one of the most intriguing stories I've ever come across. So the film begins with two twins mourning the death of their mother, trying to sort out aspects of her will. They become incredibly distraught after finding out their mother wishes not to be buried traditionally until a letter is sent to their brother and father. The twins were unaware that they had a brother and a living father, therefore leading to an investigation in order to complete the task. Everything in this film is phenomenal. Every single performance is outstanding. The realism depicted by these actors blew me away. Denis' direction, as usual is perfect. He captures moments of horror so well, utilising close ups and big wide shots when necessary. There are so many moments in the film which look incredible. Incendies has one of the most insane ending revelations I've ever experienced in film. Although it isn't pretentious or cheap due to the phenomenal writing. I was so compelled by this movie for the entire runtime. The story rarely has a dull moment, due to the uneasy and suspenseful plot. Incendies should be seen by all. Don't let the English subtitles discourage you. This movie is amazing, so therefore I give it a 9.",9,0,0,2 April 2019
Nightcrawler," It contains such a unique and well written screenplay
","Nightcrawler written and directed by Dan Gilroy, contains such a unique and well written screenplay. This film is based around Jake Gyllenhaal's character who takes it upon himself to film public tragedies in order to sell it to news channels. This then becomes an intense obsession for him, leading to acts of crime, just to get the perfect shot. This film really allows the audience to think twice while viewing news stories. It represents the emotional manipulation as well as exaggeration enforced behind the scenes, in order to gain a reaction from the public. The performance by Jake Gyllenhaal in this film is beyond Oscar worthy, and is widely considered to be his best acting performance ever...Although he didn't receive a golden globe or an Oscar nomination... Anyways this film contains highly suspenseful and exciting moments which at times can be truly horrifying. This movie is extremely memorable, with such insane and uneasy moments. It's a film which blurs the lines of morality and makes you question aspects of humanity. My one flaw surrounds the cinematography during car chases. I've seen it been done a lot better in films like Drive and The Place Beyond The Pines. I feel like if the camera work and direction was more exciting in those moments, it could've really elevated the intensity of the action scenes. All in all, everything else in this film is flawless. Jake Gyllenhaal along with excellent writing means a spectacular film. So therefore I give Nightcrawler a 9.",9,1,1,2 April 2019
Baby Driver," Enjoyable with so much more potential
","Before seeing 'Baby driver' I was very excited due to the fact that the director, Edgar Wright is known to make unique movies which really work. For me this movie was bitter sweet. This is because it contained some of the best action scenes, and car chases I've ever scene. The editing, cinematography and integration with music was extraordinary. Kevin Spacey and John Hamm, were perfect in their roles, and for the most part I felt that Ansel Elgort was best suited for his role also. Although this film has major problems. I feel as though other movie reviewers are addressing the main issue with the film, and are really overlooking the importance of it, as they are distracted by the elaborate and breathtaking action sequences. This film does not delve deep into its characters enough to make you really care about them, and their relationships. Ansel Elgort's character 'Baby', is rushed into a two dimensional relationship with Lily James' character 'Debora'. The genuine love between these characters is not apparent due to the lack of substance as a couple. There are situations where this relationship is threatened to create suspense and I couldn't help but think about how much more intense and gripping it would be if the audience really felt for these two characters. I have seen it been done in other films, where the viewer is emotionally attached to characters and their relationships. When it is done right, it truly takes you other places in terms of tension and genuine worry. I was deeply disappointed by this, as all the stunning action scenes would have enhanced even further if the audience had felt a real care for these characters. It reached a point where the limits of their relationships were unrealistic. Debora would make life threatening decisions, which could either kill her or make her a criminal, for a boy she had only gone on a single date with. The occurrence of this really took me out of the scenes, as her motivations were insanely unrealistic for an average human. Furthermore, my other main issue with 'Baby Driver' was Jamie Fox. Countless movie critics are praising his performance, and to a certain extent he was great. His personality as a character was done well. It was his unclear line delivery which really interrupted intense scenes that were intended to really build in tension. On countless occasions I felt that the ruthless and terrifying persona of his character was lost due to my inability to understand him. Also the acting by Eiza González as 'Darling' was quite terrible, especially in a certain scene where she was attempting to be threatening, which only left me cringing. Overall, 'Baby Driver' is a really enjoyable movie, which was lots of fun to watch. The reason as to why I am grading it a 7/10, is due to all the potential I see in it. It was so close to being a masterpiece, and I can't wait to see the film which can tackle this style perfectly. I know that when that happens, that film will be a modern day classic.",6,9,20,11 August 2017
Spider-Man," 16 years later and I still feel completely satisfied
","Spider-Man is directed by Sam Raimi and is the origin story to the character of Peter Parker. Tobey Maguire who was casted for the lead role delivers such an authentic performance. Peter is everything from intelligent to painfully awkward, and at times can be the most relatable marvel hero. The great cast portray characters who are perfectly established due to the impressive script. Particularly Willem Dafoe who is phenomenal. He truly embodies the Green Goblin, delivering such a complex and horrifying villain, who contains personal ties to Peter Parker. Sam Raimi's creative voice comes through beautifully, as he focuses on vibrant visuals as well as a real emphasis on the human nature behind Spider-Man. At times this film can be incredibly emotional, where you find yourself caring so deeply for these comic book characters. But above all that Spider-Man contains such exciting action sequences and climatic finale which greatly impacts our hero on both sides of his identity. 16 years later and I still feel completely satisfied by Raimi's portrayal of this iconic Marval hero. Spider-Man set the benchmark for all superhero origin stories, delivering an experience of high quality and undeniable enjoyment. Its a strong start to the trilogy so therefore I give it a 9.",9,0,0,2 April 2019
Dunkirk," I loved every minute of Dunkirk
","Being the last day of the year, I thought I should review my absolute favourite film of 2017. Dunkirk directed by Christopher Nolan, was a movie which blew me away. I had to see it more than once in cinemas, due to how stunning it was visually. The beach, the ocean and the sky all looked incredible, with the help of little to no CGI, but just purely amazing cinematography. The reason as to why I love this film so much is because of how different and unconventional it is. Dunkirk represents war in the most realistic way. It shows you that in moments of horror, you don't always get to know the soldiers around you and their back story. This film deliberately throws the audience into the climax from the beginning. I loved how Christopher Nolan was able to tell such a simple story in a really complex way. This is shown with his play on time, which made the film all the more riveting. The score by Hans Zimmer added so much, and worked really well with the sounds of war. At times I was unable to seperate the two. Everything from the vulnerable performances to the runtime was perfect. I loved every minute of Dunkirk. The ending left me with goosebumps. So therefore I give it a 10. I've noticed I've mostly been reviewing movies I love, so in between my Star Wars series I will be sharing my thoughts on some films I hate with a passion... Look forward to that.",10,2,4,2 April 2019
American History X," 'American History X' is the true purpose of film
","Let me begin by saying, this was not an easy film to watch. It was highly confronting surrounding aspects of racism in American society, as well as the unspeakable reality of prison. Although this is exactly what made this film great. I have not seen a film be this courageous in tackling issues that occur in society. Issues that people would rather be oblivious to, are completely exposed in this film. A large number of people steer away from films like this, and prefer to watch meaningless, poorly made films, as its an easy watch. And to a certain extent, light hearted movies are perfectly enjoyable. But 'American History X' is the true purpose of film. As to why it is, can be described through various elements which make up and form this masterpiece.The first element is the cast. 'Edward Norton', as Derek was incredible, to say the least. His character possessed so much depth, which was slowly revealed to the audience as the film went on. He progressed and behaved so realistically, I no longer saw an actor playing a character. Furthermore, the casting of his entire family was perfect, in particular his younger brother Daniel played by 'Edward Furlong'. He portrayed a troubled teenage kid in the most realistic way. At times I was trying to pick flaws with aspects of his character that weren't as refined or polished, only to realise that these imperfections are true characteristics of any average kid. The history teacher, Dr. Bob Sweeney, played by 'Avery Brooks, also did a spectacular job, in trying to solve the complicated situation. The second element is the screenplay. This is how a screenplay should be written. Take a simple story-line, and execute it in the most complex way possible. This screenplay takes you on a journey, by firstly showing the situation at hand as a uninformed outsider, but then slowly gives you context and background as the film progresses. This was done so coherently with brilliant flashbacks, which by the end of the film, made you look at each character in an entirely new light. This was what made the film so engaging. The fact that I was curious to see what events shaped these characters, made the flashbacks feel very much anticipated. Also the dialogue between characters was sharp and gripping, especially in scenes where opposing ideas and opinions were battling against each other. It really built the intensity and tension in the film. The final element is the cinematography. The camera movement, and editing was exceptional. The way in which flashbacks were presented in black and white, gave past events much more power and intensity. I particularly liked the way in which there was a constant focus on water. The slow motion shots of dripping water in the shower, made you really feel the exhaustion and fatigue felt by the characters.Overall, the general reason as to why 'American History X' is the purpose of film, is due to the fact that it exposes its audience to confronting aspects of our world. It is able to inform people who may live sheltered lives, much like myself, about the racism and violence, which is a constant reality for many till this day. This film provides its audience with a wider view of the world, contributing to our worldly knowledge and awareness. This is all achieved due to the perfect execution of the elements in the film, discussed above, which all assist in making this film a true masterpiece.",10,3,4,5 September 2017
Get Out," I think all the positive reviews made my expectations skyrocket
","Get Out Directed by Jordan Peele is a horror film which begins with quite a unique story, surrounding an African American man meeting his girlfriend's Caucasian family. The first two acts of the film contain scenes which build so much tension. The start of this movie had me so invested due to how much was unknown. I really built strong curiosity surrounding why things seemed very off. All the performances were great, particularly the main character who was incredibly convincing with all his emotion. Also the cinematography was very nice, containing scenes which are one long take with no cuts. As for negatives there are quite a few. The tone of this film is very messy. I wished the horror really got under my skin. Although it was as if there were constant intermissions with cliche comedic relief. To me this broke all the tension, and really made me question the type of film I was watching. There are also quite a few plot holes, and scenes which really don't have any purpose besides trying to freak out the audience. Once the film reaches the third act, I was really let down by the direction they took. I was expecting a smart and unique revelation. But all I got was a standard messed up horror movie 'twist'. I think all the positive reviews made my expectations skyrocket. I really thought this movie would be insanely smart, but honestly it's really not that special. It didn't impact me the way other great horror and thriller films have. It's a solid and enjoyable film. But it's far from groundbreaking, so therefore I give Get Out a 6. I feel like many will disagree with my rating. If you think you can convince me as to why it is great go ahead. One thing I still don't see is why African Americans were targeted in the film. When it was asked the question was just brushed off...",6,5,7,2 April 2019
Good Will Hunting," The realism and authenticity is unbelievable
","Today I am ending my birthday on a high by reviewing my all time favourite movie. Good Will Hunting Directed by Gus Van Sant, contains such an incredible screenplay written by Matt Damon and Ben Affleck. The plot is simply based on a genius who isn't living to his potential due to the traumatic impact of his past. For a topic which has been attempted countless times in film history, Good Will Hunting still holds the benchmark. Each and every word of the script is perfection. Moments of outrage as well as moments of therapy contain some of the most well written lines in cinema. Robin Williams' performance was truly inspiring. His line delivery has a way of transcending the screen and connecting with the audience on a deep, emotional level. I say this is my favourite film due to the fact that it is talented film making in its barest form. All that is required is a great script and talented performances, in order to create such a timeless film. This movie holds up incredibly well. Age hasn't made it less powerful or emotionally outdated. This is one of the very few films which actually impacted my personal life and changed my mindset. The bleak visuals together with Elliot Smith's melancholy music, establishes such a beautiful, sorrowful tone throughout the entire runtime. Not once do I ever believe I am watching a film whilst sitting through Good Will Hunting. The realism and authenticity is unbelievable. If you haven't seen Good Will Hunting, you're currently deprived from one of the greatest films in history. This film repeatedly leaves me in awe each and every time I experience it. Good Will Hunting is undoubtably a 10. I recommended reading through screenplay after watching the film. It's an absolute masterpiece.",10,2,4,2 April 2019
Prisoners," Such a captivating movie experience
","Prisoners directed by Denis Villeneuve is a crime thriller surrounding two families' search for their abducted daughters. First and foremost the cinematography by Roger Deakins is flawless. It perfectly sets the tone for the film. Particularly the shots which utilise the weather to create stunning effects with lighting and shadows. This is a a long film. The runtime is around 2hrs and 30mins. Although the pacing is perfect. As soon as the film begins, each scene builds and builds with more intensity. Prisoners kept me 100% hooked with intense suspense throughout the entire investigation. Furthermore, the performances are all incredible. Hugh Jackman's character contains such powerful emotion, and he delivers it perfectly. Paul Dano also does such a great job with a highly difficult performance. Each actor disappeared in their roles. Particularly Jake Gyllenhaal. The way in which he progressed and grew emotionally, made him so compelling. The score by Johann Johannsson creates feelings of melancholy, sorrow and intensity, during times of horror. Denis' direction accompanied by the incredible screenplay has created such a captivating movie experience. I highly recommend seeing this film. It is one of my favourites of all time, so therefore I give Prisoners a 10.",10,1,1,2 April 2019
La La Land," I was blown away by this film
","La La Land written and directed by Damien Chazelle was released exactly one year ago today in Australia. To say the least, I was blown away by this film. The cinematography is exciting. The editing is timed perfectly. The production design is simple, vibrant and beautiful. This movie is put together like a masterpiece. The performances are so real and grounded. Particularly Emma Stone, who never for a moment makes it known that she is an actor playing a character. The depth of her emotion forms such a realistic and complex human being. The music written by Justin Hurwitz is simply perfection. This is one of my favourite movie scores of all time. His music creates such complex emotions, with his mixture of happiness and melancholy. This is easily my favourite musical ever made. This is because the characters and drama are not neglected at the expense of the musical numbers. They a both intertwined beautifully. Each element is placed together with so much thought, that it successfully transports the audience into such a deep emotional experience. This film contains so much talent and creativity, that it would be impossible not to give it a 10. I know a fair few people who really dislike La La Land. This movie is not for your average audience. It's really for those who love and appreciate the craft of film.",10,2,2,2 April 2019
Sicario," Such an overwhelming film experience
","Sicario Directed by Denis Villeneuve contains such a compelling story along side incredible performances. This film takes you on a journey from the perspective of Emily Blunt's character. You think and feel as she would during some of the most uneasy situations I've experienced in a film. For the entire runtime, I felt consistently torn between characters I could trust and those who where manipulators. This is a film which plays with your emotions, and leaves you feeling on edge consistently. When the credits rolled I honestly felt dirty, due to the gritty visuals and blurring of morals. This tone was all successfully achieved from Denis' amazing direction combined with Roger Deakins' stunning cinematography. The beautiful natural shots with no artificial lighting, captures the most realistic darkness I've seen in film. Also Emily Blunt's performance was phenomenal. Her exhaustion, confusion, frustration and intense trauma was portrayed with such realism, that I genuinely forgot she was acting. Sicario was such an overwhelming film experience, containing such incredible filmmaking. So therefore I give It a 9.",9,1,2,2 April 2019
Psycho," Groundbreaking
","Psycho directed by Alfred Hitchcock is a crime thriller which follows a woman who unexpectedly steals money from her boss with the intentions of running away with her boyfriend, so they can start a new life together. Although her plan takes drastic turns as she is faced with many unforeseen complications and danger. This film is a clear example as to why Hitchcock is praised as being the master of suspense. Psycho keeps you captivated for the entire runtime. The script manipulates the audience with sharp obscure dialogue. The incredible screenplay is accompanied by oscar worthy performances, particularly by Janet Leigh and Anthony Perkins. His character of Norman Bates is easily one of the most compelling aspects of the film. His peculiar nature makes him such a complex and well established character. The music, cinematography and editing work together beautifully, creating such an uneasy and eerie tone. For its time, Psycho was groundbreaking. It subverted the formulaic structures of the crime genre, as well as pushed boundaries surrounding what was tolerated during its social context. Psycho is still insanely nail biting and truly horrifying. It holds up incredibly well, in terms of entertainment value. But beneath all that it is one of the most well made movies of all time. Psycho is outstanding and that is why I give it a 10.",10,1,1,4 April 2018
Whiplash," It turns orchestra performances into action scenes
","Whiplash written and directed by Damien Chazelle is a simple story told in such a captivating way. The amazing script keeps you engaged from start to finish. The dialogue is so sharp, that I couldn't wait to hear the next words to come out of the characters . Whiplash is one of the most exciting, nonstop dramas I've ever seen. The performances are incredible, with J.k Simmons winning the Oscar for best supporting actor. This film also received an Oscar for its editing, by Tom Cross. The editing in this movie is some of the best ever. At times it is so fast paced and exciting that it almost turns orchestra performances into action scenes. Seriously this movie is all about music and jazz, but the intensity, thrill and unpredictable nature, keeps you on edge the entire runtime. The music by Justin Hurwitz as well as a few other composers, really creates a fast paced jazz feel, as well as elevates moments of sadness and depression experienced by the main character. This movie shows that big budgets don't always mean great films. This movie relies on pure talent and great writing to keep the audience engaged, as opposed to explosions and CGI. Whiplash is one of my favourite movies of all time so there for I give it a 10.",10,0,0,2 April 2019
Arrival," It's a film which plays with your mind
","Arrival directed by Denis Villeneuve is one of the best Science Fiction movies In recent years. Every single shot in this film is absolutely stunning. The large establishing shots of natural landscapes presented in quite muted colours, covered in blankets of mist is dripping with jaw dropping beauty. The story is a clear reflection of our current context, giving caution and direction for our future. The screenplay is intelligent, and so unique. Amy Adams in this film gives one of her best performances in my opinion, playing a linguist who is insanely overworked. The audience is made to feel everything she does, as if we are inside her mind. Also the score by Johan Johansson is eerie, chilling and almost ghostly. It works extremely well in the very quiet and mysterious tone of the film. The twist which comes to fruition towards the end, is simply genius. No spoilers of course, but it worked so well due to the talented film makers. It's a twist which makes you look at the entire film differently after attaining the new knowledge... literally it was as if my mind was on a rollercoaster when I figured it out. Unfortunately Arrival isn't completely flawless. One of my issues being being the role of Jeremy Renner. He kinda has a significant role, but in terms of the issue at hand, he literally does nothing. There's also another scene where a character breaks certain protocol and everyone is after them. But then what they are doing is completed, so they obey and everyone forgets about it. I feel like it was just there to build tension and make the scene more exciting. All in all I love this film. It benefits from multiple viewings. It's a film which plays with your mind and I love that. Arrival is incredibly well made and contains a great story so therefore I give it an 8.",8,0,1,2 April 2019
Wonder Woman," This is definitely DC best film since The Dark Knight.
","This is definitely DC best film since The Dark Knight. I was very hesitant to see this film due to the fact that DC movies have been extremely disappointing in the past few years. Some of the positives include; The character development or our hero. Gal Gadot delivers the best performance possible for this character. From her appearance to her personality, she was perfect. I also liked how the film dealt with the supporting character played by Chris Pine. A film directed and dominated by women, did not feel like feminist overload. The male and female characters were given substantial depth. Some other positives include the action scenes, the look of the film and the score. Overall it was a very well directed, solid film, although a major problem was the depth of the villains. Every villain was extremely shallow, two dimensional and were not engaging. Another issue was the over use of CGI especially in the last scene. I also felt that some of the dialogue was quite weak, but on the other hand some of the dialogue was very funny and engaging. All in all I would really recommend this film. Its highly entertaining, and made extremely well. Patty Jenkins should direct more DC films. Zack Snyder could never make a super hero movie of this quality and coherence. 8/10",8,7,16,8 August 2017
Black Panther," So predictable that the adrenaline never kicked in
","Black Panther directed by Ryan Coogler is Marvel's latest film, and is marketed as being a unique take on the cinematic universe. And to a certain extent it is, in terms of setting and characters. But ultimately the action set pieces and story structure is basically exactly what we would expect. Black Panther sadly has many issues in my opinion. Firstly the pacing is slow and ultimately boring. The endless expository dialogue cannot be justified as something that is necessary for character development. In fact the characters were my second major issue. Killmonger's revenge story doesn't even pick up until halfway through the film. Yes they gave him a back story, but it's so basic I could describe it all in a sentence. His lack of development made it really hard to care in crucial moments, such as the climatic battle which didn't feel climatic due to the lack of emotional attachment I had to the characters. I never felt an authentic connection to the story because all we are given for our villain were forced emotional flashbacks. Furthermore, for a film with a $200 million budget the level of CGI was pretty unacceptable. It wasn't unbearable, but for the most part every CGI aspect was noticeably CGI. The animated scenery of Wakanda didn't blow me away in the slightest. The comedy in the film was so weak. Every joke was completely out of place. The film seemed scared to let scenes build in intensity. We didn't need a dumb joke about vegetarians to mess up the tone. Another issue was the lack of suspense and anticipation I felt throughout the entire runtime. Any life threatening scene for T'Challa became incredibly dull with zero emotional impact simply because I had just seen him in the Avenger's trailer literally right before the movie started. All in all, Black Panther is a perfectly enjoyable action film and I'm glad so many people felt satisfied by it. The movie presents such important ideas surrounding social justice and racial equality, although putting that aside and looking at the film I was very disappointed. By the end it was so predictable that the adrenaline never kicked in. So therefore I give Black Panther a",6,0,3,4 April 2018
Blade Runner," This classic has, and will continue to stand the test of time
","Blade Runner directed by Ridley Scott, is a film which has grown to be rightfully appreciated with age. When this film was first released in 1982 it performed terribly in the box office, as audiences genuinely disliked this bleak and depressing futuristic world. Although when Ridley Scott came out with a director's cut years later, this masterpiece was seen in an entirely new light. It's defiantly not a film for everybody, simply due to the fact that it doesn't contain much that will please the audience. The film noir, confronting plot and dystopian setting creates uneasy emotions while viewing. Although this is the underlying purpose of the film. I love how this movie challenges humanity. It really makes you question society and where it's headed. This uncomfortable movie experience is crucial in providing caution and warning for our future. I truly believe that Blade Runner is more than a film. Substantial research can take place after your viewing. There are so many metaphors, symbols and deep messages which are thoughtfully arranged by the film makers. Blade Runner is insanely complex. Not to mention, the visuals, and incredible score have influenced generations of science fiction. This film was a milestone in cinema, particularly in the sci-fi genre. This classic has, and will continue to stand the test of time, so therefore I give Blade Runner a 9.",9,1,2,2 April 2019
Moonrise Kingdom," I cannot fault this quirky masterpiece
","Moonrise Kingdom is directed by Wes Anderson and follows the journey of two children in 1965 on an island off the coast of New England. Anderson's unique style works incredibly well in this film, and that's thanks to perfect casting. The two leads being Jared Gilman and Kara Hayward give such captivating performances through their impressive line delivery. It would be very easy for this story to feel slow and disinteresting, but each cast member truly brings the script to life in the most entertaining way. As usual, this Wes Anderson film contains stunning cinematography and striking visuals through his use of pastel colours and artistic sets. The film also utilises music in such a great way, specifically in one iconic scene which contains a fantastic French song. For a risky style which is very prone to the notion of hit or miss, I truly believe Moonrise Kingdom hits the mark in every area. From plot to film making I cannot fault this quirky masterpiece. Moonrise Kingdom ticks every box for me so therefore I give it a 10.",10,2,3,4 April 2018
Star Wars: Episode VII - The Force Awakens," It definitely delivered
","Star Wars Episode VII: The Force Awakens is directed by J.J. Abrams. This film takes place over 20 years after The Return Of The Jedi. It was long awaited, but it definitely delivered. This film is everything you want a Star Wars film to be. It further deepens and gives purpose to the original characters, as well as introduces very likeable new additions. The action sequences are all incredible. This film really makes the most of modern CGI, but also does many things practically, which is essential for a Star Wars film. It is important that I speak about the new villain, Kylo Ren. This guy is awesome! He's such a deep and complex character. There is so much conflict within him, and when learning more about his back story, it makes you really view him as more than just an evil antagonist. The main criticism of the film surrounds the fact that it seems to follow and share similarities to the original trilogy, particularly A New Hope. I can see how perhaps they played it safe. But in my opinion all they did was improve on it and explore everything on a much deeper level. Star Wars: The Force Awakens contains such great writing and film making so therefore I give it a 9.",9,7,28,2 April 2019
Star Wars: Episode IV - A New Hope," The enormity of this universe can still be felt today
","Star Wars Episode lV: A New Hope, directed by George Lucas is the first film made in the Star Wars series. What makes this film so timeless is that the enormity of this universe can still be felt today. All the visuals hold up so well, making the audience feel exactly what was intended in 1977. The introduction of these now iconic characters, makes the film so compelling and exciting. For it's time Star Wars: A New Hope pulled off the impossible, with excellent cinematography, editing and visuals. As for issues this film needed to set up much of the story and characters for the entire trilogy, so for me the first two acts felt quite slow. Although the movie has a way of slowly building in each scene, eventually leading to such an exciting finale. This movie will be loved for generations so therefore I give Star Wars: A New Hope an 8.",8,0,0,2 April 2019
Star Wars: Episode V - The Empire Strikes Back," The Empire Strikes Back is my favourite Star Wars Film
","Star Wars Episode V: The Empire Strikes Back, directed by Irvin Kershner follows the incredibly successful Star Wars: A New Hope. This movie is directed perfectly, and is accompanied by such an excellent screenplay. The film starts on a high and progressively builds with even more excitement in every scene. The fact that the characters and storyline had already been established in the first film, it allowed for much more entertaining character relationships and action sequences. The visuals in The Empire Strikes Back are even more impressive, and till this day certain sets are jaw dropping. Also the music by John Williams is outstanding, introducing the iconic Imperial March added a new level of darkness to Darth Vader and The Empire. This film fleshes out its main characters, giving them so much more depth. Luke's training with the incredible Yoda, allowed him to learn important lessons and wisdom. Also learning more about Darth Vader and who he is controlled by makes him so much more complex and compelling. The Empire Strikes Back is my favourite Star Wars Film. Every person working on this movie was at their creative peak, so therefore I must give it a 10.",10,0,0,2 April 2019
Mad Max: Fury Road," It's a visual masterpiece
","Mad Max: Fury Road directed by George Miller is a visual masterpiece. This film contains some of the best action sequences in recent years. The fast paced editing, stunning cinematography and limited dialogue transports the viewer to this dystopian wasteland. Winning 6 Academy Awards, I give this film a 10.",10,0,2,2 April 2019
Donnie Darko," Donnie Darko is wonderfully strange
","Donnie Darko directed by Richard Kelly is a drama/fantasy/teen flick/thriller/science fiction film... and some how, its actually works. It follows Jake Gyllenhaal's character, Donnie Darko, who is tormented by hallucinations of a man dressed in a bunny suit. These visions manipulate Donnie to commit a series of crimes, as repayment for being saved from a life threatening accident. The peculiar nature of this film, truly sets it apart within the world of cinema, making it one of the most memorable movie experiences I've ever had. This film is so incredibly entertaining, mainly due to the perfect line delivery and performance by Jake Gyllenhaal. The entire cast has a level of peculiarity which just makes them so compelling to watch. I particularly love the unconventional cinematography which further emphasises the bizarre tone of the film, as well as the integration of an iconic soundtrack which sets the context and tone of the fictional world. Donnie Darko is wonderfully strange. But beneath all its weirdness, its actually really emotional. Every character is completely human and at times can be very relatable. The film has an underlying tone of sadness throughout, making it such a complex story with a lot of depth. Yes you might not get all the answers by the end of the film, but I love the fact that I can invent my own theories and explanations which allows the movie to make sense to me. Donnie Darko had me fixated on the screen for the entire runtime, and had me pondering about it for a week, so therefore I give it a 10.",10,2,2,2 April 2019
The Martian," Insanely entertaining
","The Martian directed by Ridley Scott is a Sci-Fi film following a rescue mission to Mars after one man is stranded on the planet... and this movie is GREAT. Within cinema one thing is for sure, when Ridley makes a great film it's monumental. The Martian is one of my all time favourites. The shots and cinematography on Mars are truly out of this world... The editing, score and integration of CGI is outstanding. This film is put together beautifully. Although The Martian isn't just exceptional on the technical side, it's also insanely entertaining. And that is thanks to the excellent script and line delivery by Matt Damon. This is his best performance in years. He's everything from witty to emotionally fragile, which forms such a complex and compelling character. The Martian has a perfect balance of distress and great humour. I love the integration of music by David Bowie and ABBA. It really helps lift up the spirit. The large cast doesn't weigh down the film at all, as they all add something more to the story. I can honestly watch The Martian countless times and never get bored. This is an outstanding film so therefore I give it a 10.",10,1,2,2 April 2019
