Hereditary," Don't waste your time
","Was looking forward to seeing this film as I highly rate Toni Collette and Gabriel Byrne. Without spoilers, it was rubbish. It had so much potential and used none of it. With spoilers. The whole film was a waste of time I will never get back. If you only like a slightly scary kind of film, watch Muriel's Wedding instead.",1,0,6,29 August 2018
