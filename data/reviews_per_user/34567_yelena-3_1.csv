The Blair Witch Project," scary as hell.........
","scary as hell........... thats basically what it is. Yes......it is overhyped and yes.......it wasnt the best movie ever...but it was scary as hellvery few movies has left an impact on me like this one has, i left the theater feeling numb, because this movie movie is different, no cheesy CGI effects, no happy ending, and most importantly of all, not one thing to remind you this it only a movie (except the credits). this is the first movie that has made me think, it didnt unfold totally, it left a big piece missing, and left it up to you to fill it in. the ending was perfect, and for those who said it ''sucked'' probibly didnt get it. the scary part of the movie was never seen,(something very different from other movies released recently). so please ignor all the hype and what other people are saying about it , and see it.........and even if you end up hating it or loving it or scared the **** because of it, at the very least youll know what everyone else is talking about.and though people ratethis movie that same way they rate a movie w/a 100million+ budget, it still deserves credit.so in the end i give this movie a perfect 10 because w/a $60,000 budget, it did a very good job of making you believe it and be scared of hell.........",Null,1,2,6 August 1999
