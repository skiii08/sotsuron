Insidious: Chapter 2," Great idea, poorly executed.
","Me and a couple pals were excited to go see a midnight showing of insidious chapter 2. The movie started out slow, and ended slow. The storyline was great, perfectly continuing were the first one left off and with a different theme all together. Now the devil is back in the real world, and wants too kill. It was rather boring, not very scary. Me and my friends walked out of the theater very disappointed. I had a friend tag along who hadn't seen the first one, and it made absolutely no sense to him. that isn't necessarily a huge deal but it would have been nice if they kind of explained everything again somehow. like a journal of the boys mother or father explaining everything that happened. The acting was nothing special.then we get to the worst part, the end. The lady who is trying to kill them dies and they all think they are safe. Elise is in the spirit world and everything starts melting away, shes going to a better place. but then she looks to her left, screams, then it cuts to credits. It was stupid in all honesty, so now we will have to wait another two years to see the third one just to be angered once again.",4,1,3,29 September 2013
