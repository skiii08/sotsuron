Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," The Longest, Most Boring Plastic Toys Advertising Campaign.
","Almost impossible to watch this garbage. No acting, annoying characters, poor dialogs, incomprehensible and blatantly stupid story that destroys minute by minute what George Lucas achieved in original trilogy. Almost feels as the story was written by an imbecile. And for imbeciles.
The entire enterprise shows perfectly what happens, when the only goal of production is to maximize profit. And sell of overpriced toys.
For me, it is mind blowing, how people can fall for this plastic toys advertising campaign. This isn't even a B-movie. It would be seriously unfair to B-movies - put this rubbish in the same category.
On the positive side?
Well...
Lucas no longer directs or writes - saving us from similar experiences.",1,2,6,6 June 2018
