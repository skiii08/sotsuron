Casablanca," The best movie ever made...
","Casablanca is debatably THE best movie ever made.  I have watched it a countless number of times and can find no fault with it.  What is also fabulous is the background material which come on the laser/dvd versions, with accoompanying audio commentaries, still photos and an accompanying documentary hosted by Laren Bacall (Mrs. Bogart).  The worst thing that has ever happened to this movie was the issue of a colorized version several years ago, which is actually difficult to find.  There was a piece about Casablanca on CBS '60 Minutes' done by Harry Reasoner many years ago.  Too bad that segment does not circulate with the DVD.",10,0,0,9 February 2001
To Kill a Mockingbird," A classic in fabulous black and white film.
","A classic movie.  Excellent movie which catches the spirit of the book, a feat difficult for most films adapted from books.  Great performances by entire cast.  The novel itself is a staple among many high-schools, so the film is a good accompaniment.",10,2,4,7 January 2001
