Borat: Cultural Learnings of America for Make Benefit Glorious Nation of Kazakhstan," Borat's fumbling's in the south and mid America
","Having just seen the film (if it can called that), I thought back to my travels to the 'U.S. and A'. Americans, especially outside major urban areas, are polite, pleasant, a bit boorish but overwhelmingly friendly. It is these folks he targets, having clearly worked out NYers, Bostonites, SFans etc. weren't going to fall for it.So he works on these silly Southerners or nice mildly moronic Mid-westerners as he does.I would be keen to know how many were setup in advance? I feel genuinely sorry for the well meaning old Jewish couple. I hope they were well paid at the end of the day! I have stayed in B and Bs in the 'US and A', and the proprietors were often 'sweet and hokey' by any non-American English-speaking definition. It is not an exclusive thing that Americans often appear ill-informed and even dim about the outside (USA) world. But Borat's send-up of these poor folks is excruciating!! I hope they all sue his arse and get him! Kazakhstan is irrelevant to the film - it is just an imaginary country with a real name as it happens, his non-English languages are Hebrew mixed with some Polish.What is relevant is how ridiculous the sample of Americans appear in the film. Since America has such good anti-home invasion gun laws I would like to ask why someone didn't shoot him dead for abusing their good-natured though naive hospitality.Here in Australia he wouldn't have been shot but with his previous persona Ali G being comparitively well known and well as people having some knowledge of Borat (from Ali G shows), he would have got a good smack in the head and then had it kicked in ...... instead of being treated so politely. This was put to him on recent (November) visit to Australia as Sacha Cohen - his real self, apparently much of his planned move to go into character here was realistically abandoned and his trip to Australia curtailed. He did apparently go to Bondi Beach to rub suncream on some topless chicks but this segment was thankfully yanked (no pun intended). I understand he only appears now in character to do controlled promotional blips. Please Americans don't stand for this either as humour or even think it could be. It was a mockumentary in the poorest taste.",1,5,11,15 December 2006
