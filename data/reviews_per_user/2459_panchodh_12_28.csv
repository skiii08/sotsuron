Vertigo," Unforgettable
","This movie is amazing. I wouldn't dare to blatantly say it is Hitchcock's masterpiece only because Psycho is pretty good to, but it definitely competes for the prize. There's very few movies that made me shout and stay on the edge of my chair for so much time as this one, the whole atmosphere, starting from the opening credits, is creepy as f*ck. And it just keeps building up until the suicide which, you think, it is the climax of the movie. Then, surprisingly, the movie doesn't seem to finish. At first I was quite bothered, why would the movie not finish yet? Yes, the scene in which Scottie has that weird, LSD-like dream is pretty awesome, but it just seemed to me that Hitchcock was stretching the movie too much. Until you realize that you didn't see it all, and that the woman who fell from the tower is not the woman Scottie fell in love with (is it not? who did he feel in love with exactly?). Then it just gets way to f*cked up. And Scottie begins to be a creep with Judy, and you just wish that nothing happens to her. And tension begins to build up again, and you just can't stand it anymore, up until the last scene, which oh god I will never forget. The shadow in the end shall haunt me in my dreams for many nights to come. It definitely ranks among the best final scenes I've ever seen (Psycho's climax is also pretty high up there, too, though it's not exactly the last scene). So yeah, this is among the best thrillers I've seen in my life.",9,2,3,22 May 2015
The Prestige," A lecture on narrative
","The movie begins by letting the public know that in a magic trick there are three acts: -The premise, where we are shown an ordinary object, like a canary. -The change, where something extraordinary happens to this object. The canary disappears. But you don't clap yet, because you know that something else must happen, you are waiting for it.-Finally, in the prestige, the magician brings the ordinary object back. And that's when you clap. You think you are trying to figure out how he did it, but actually, you don't really want it. Because deep down you know that the old canary is smashed under the table.This is a narrative masterpiece, and we are being told what is going to happen straight from the beginning. Nolan takes an ordinary story of two magicians' rivalry; gives it an extraordinary plot twist, and while you are trying to figure out what is the trick behind it, he brings back the ordinary to the movie.But, just like in a magician's show, he needs to build up the tension. In a normal show, a magician begins with the simple stuff, something rather interesting yet nothing unique. Throughout the show, things get more amazing, until you get to the second to last trick, which you think it tops it all. But then it comes the last trick, the truly jaw dropping one; and you realize that the previous trick was simply the second best. A highly recommendable movie to pretty much anyone.",9,0,1,3 February 2016
Dr. Strangelove or: How I Learned to Stop Worrying and Love the Bomb," A Cold War gem
","This movie hilariously depicts how absurd the Cold War was. Especially in the early 60s, when this movie was made and the world was so close to Nuclear War, it was almost as if people actually wanted it. Some just for the sake of the show, or curiosity of how it would actually look like, and some because they had actually suffered all the brainwashing that came with the Cold War. I think that what's best achieved in this movie is how hilarious yet realistic the whole situation is. I mean, had someone actually sent those poor boys in nuclear planes to drop a nuclear bomb in real life, I bet their reaction wouldn't have looked much different. And it's funny because we've all consumed the imagery of war full of heroes ready to die for their Motherland or an Idea, while in reality it's just made of flesh and bones people, more similar to the ones in this movie. That's what makes this movie so great: it deconstructs all the social meaning charged into the ideas of Superpowers, Nation, War. In the end, it's just people. Mention apart deserves the great acting in that good ol' American accent of the 50s and 60s, which makes the script even funnier. Sellers, Scott and Hayden pull of amazing performances the three of them, specially Dr. Strangelove's amazing role. I only realized that Mandrake, the President and Strangelove where the same actor when reading the cast, and it makes Peter Seller's performance even more praiseworthy.",9,1,2,20 January 2015
Taxi Driver," Disturbingly amazing
","No wonder why this movie is such a classic. The performances of De Niro, Cybill Shepherd, Harvey Keitel and Jodie Foster are all stunning. But definitely most of the merit goes to Scorsese. The way the movie is shot, its cinematography, its colours, its music, its aura, they all drag the viewer deep into the Travis' world, to the point you fully understand his disturbing actions. The way the movie slowly builds up to the climax is perfect. The plot line is never too slow as to bore the audience, yet the way the anti-hero's psyche evolves at a glaciar pace, from the point he gets the job as a taxi driver to the final climax, is truly remarkable. And it's disturbing how current the theme is, with so many mass shooting happening in the US. It really points to a side of modern civilization we need to look at much more, how so many people are completely alone with their minds in the huge metropolis, not really understanding why their world is so messed up.",9,0,2,24 August 2015
Léon: The Professional," It's like Amelie, Lolita and The Usual Suspects clumped together
","It's like Amelie because of the 90s aura, because of the beautiful camera shots filmed in an old New York apartment that could also perfectly be in Paris, because of the colour palette used by the director, because of the amazing, memorable quotes worth keeping, because of Natalie Portman's haircut, because of the way each character is immensely unique, irreplaceable.It's like Lolita because, well, that's kinda obvious. In a way, this movie is all about Natalie Portman's beautiful youth, is all about the perturbing situation in which Mathilda and León are in, the stark contrast between Natlie Portman looking like a child but acting like a woman and Jean Reno looking like a grown-up, professional killer but acting like a child. Antagonisms are all around Mathilda and Leóns relationship: she's a child, he's a grown up; he's the teacher when it comes to killing, but then he needs her to fill the check-in forms of the hotel because he doesn't know how to read. She can convincingly imitate Marilyn Monroe, but he doesn't even know who that is. In a way, it can be summed up when they say:Léon: You need some time to grow up a little. Mathilda: I finished growing up, Léon. I just get older. Léon: For me it's the opposite. I'm old enough. I need time to grow up. Then it's also like The Usual Suspect, because of how in the surface it just looks like another 90s gang movie, with drug dealing, corrupt cops and impressive scenes of blowing up buildings. But as soon as you step into it, you find an immensely rich plot, with unique characters and incredibly good acting: Jean Reno achieves an impressive amount of expression given his character's few lines. Natlie Portman is just perturbingly beautiful, and it's just amazing how she could pull out that acting with only 11. Though the one who really steals the show is Gary Oldman, my God what a memorable character. Every word he pulls out of his mouth is a memorable quote, and it even makes you forget that in reality he's a Brit.But in what this movie stands out in particular is the soundtrack. Bloddy hell, what an amazing score! The way the instrumental music is used is just sublime: all the guitars, pianos, violins and even bandoneons fit perfectly with the scenes, even if, in principle, they shouldn't. Why would a bandoneon playing a tango should fit in the scene in which an 11-year-old girl learns to use a gun from a 40-year-old professional killer, in the rooftop of some New York building? Yet it does, and it's beautiful.",9,3,5,19 October 2014
The Matrix Revolutions," Way too much action and too little explanation
","I've watched the entire trilogy in three days, and now I clearly see why is only the first movie in the Top 250. When I watched it, I was amazed by it, and I desperately needed to watch the other two tosee how the story ended. But after doing it, I'm really disappointed. The plot behind the Matrix is so rich that it should have allowed the Wachowskis to come up with a better denouement. Not even that, if we consider The Matrix to be the exposition of the story (the Matrix is explained, we discover that Neo is the One), I think this exposition deserves a better rising action, climax, falling action, and denouement altogether (Yeah, I just looked up 'Dramatic structure'). And by better I don't mean more stopping bullets and millionaire visual effects, but an enrichment of the original story. J.K. Rowling, after the Sorcerer's Stone success, didn't limit herself to write six other books full of spell-casting and mythological creatures, but she rather developed a way more complex Wizards' world than the one illustrated in the first book. I honestly think that the Wachowsis should and could have done the same with The Matrix.So this movie, together with the second one, is frankly disappointing. Take for example Zion's defense, which accounts for the biggest portion of this movie, even when the public knows from the beginning of Matrix Reloaded that humans have no chance against the machines. More or less the same happens with the climatic battle of Neo against Smith: whose idea was it that the dispute between the One, humans' only hope, and his nemesis, a rebellious and viral program that tries to conquer the entire world, could be resolved in a kung-fu battle? I mean, how on Earth can Neo defeat a guy that has billions of clones purely out of fists and kicks? Nevertheless, I must say that it is after all the useless fighting between Neo and Smith that we find what I think is the most interesting dialog in the movie. After Smith beats the s*it out of Neo (which we know from the beginning it would happen), Smith asks Neo why does he keep persisting, and Neo answers: 'Becaus I choose to'. This, together with the dialog between Neo and the Oracle earlier in the movie, suggest a nice conciliation for the recurrent problem between personal freedom (the essence of human existence) and fate, which is represented in the movie with the Oracle's ability to foresee the future, the Prophecy, and the fact that the Matrix is a logarithms-based world that tends towards perception. This theme appears across the entire trilogy, from the red and blue pills scene to the Architect's scene in Reloaded. In my review of Reloaded I mention how this theme is more clearly embodied in Morpheus' character, who insists on people's choices ('I'm trying to free your mind, Neo. But I can only show you the door. You're the one that has to walk through it.') and at the same time is the firmest believer in the Prohpecy and fate ('What happened, happened and couldn't have happened any other way').Now in this movie is where the Wachowkis solution to this problem is more clearly expressed: Destiny does exist, and Smith inevitably beats Neo ('inevitabilty' is one of Smith's favorite words). But because Neo chose to be beaten up by Smith, the meaning of the act of Smith-beating-Neo changes and it now means Neo's sacrifice for Peace and Smith's defeat (there is also a lot of Ying-Yang in this, in how Smith is created out of Neo and how he's defeated out of co-opting Neo). Also the way in which the Oracle cannot see beyond people's choices, reminds me of the concept of restrained subjects, which refers to a Marx's quote in the 18th Brumaire:'Men make their own history but they do not make it just as they please; they do not make it under circumstances chosen by themselves, but under circumstances directly encountered, given and transmitted from the past.' Neo didn't choose to be the One, but he can choose what to do with it, the way he chose to sacrifice himself in the end. That's what makes him human (as the Merovingian reminds to his thugs after he bleeds in a fight scene in Reloaded).Of course I'm just over-thinking the tiny bits of this movie that are worth analyzing, and for the most part this is just explosions, fists and visual effects. And coming back to the beginning, The Matrix deserved a better epilogue than the empty scene with the Oracle and the Architect, full of vague phrases about not knowing how long the peace will last.",6,0,2,11 August 2014
The Revenant," Not your average Oscars movie
","The Revenant is, for the most of it, DiCaprio crawling and moaning. Of course, that gets tiring at some point. The movie could, easily, be half an hour shorter, and that would perhaps make it more enjoyable. But also The Revenant is a very ambitious movie. On the technical side, it is flawless, and it uses the natural scenarios, the lights and the sound perfectly. It is even more impressive when you know that it was only shot with natural light! At some points it seems like the plot (which isn't precisely noteworthy) is just an excuse for Iñárritu to shoot a wildlife documentary, because the landscapes are truly breathtaking, and they take a considerable amount of screen time.What is most memorable from this film is, I think, the camera techniques. From extensively long shots depicting intense battle scenes, to clever, smooth transitions between scenes, the use of the camera has become something of Iñárritu's trademark. What I found most interesting was the ways in which he breaks the fourth wall at different points of the movie; from DiCaprio's final closeup to the staining of the camera with the actor's breath/blood. Acting-wise, Hardy's performance is definitely Oscar-worthy, unlike, in my opinion, DiCaprio's (not that he is a bad actor; I just wouldn't give an Oscar to a performance that is mostly, as I said before, moaning and crawling).With its length, lack of dialogue, and somewhat experimental directing, this is not the most usual Hollywood's awards season blockbuster. One would expect the Academy to prefer more discreet dramas in the lines of The King's Speech or Million Dollar Baby, but, who knows, maybe I'm mistaken.",7,1,3,26 January 2016
Little Miss Sunshine," Life is a beauty pageant
","I watched this movie on a plane. I don't know what the person next to me might have thought of me, because I was laughing, then crying, then hysterically laugh again, then cry like a baby, to finally laugh to tears till the credits.There are some movies that just get you. I don't know if it was the pseudo-indie cinematography, the light colours, the very earthly and relatable characters, the Sufjan Stevens soundtrack, the funny dialogues or everything put together; but I really felt the story close to my heart. Narrativvely speaking, it is a spring story: it goes from the utterly depressing life of an American family, to the immense happiness that can only come from having grown up as a character after a road trip. And it really manages to depict in a fair number of characters a distinct change into someone better, which gives us all hope that nothing is lost, and that in the end it will be alright.Oh, and the actress of Olivia, the little girl, completely steals the show.",9,0,1,3 February 2016
Apocalypse Now," Never seen anything like this before.
","This movie is a complete mindf*ck. From the opening scene, with the takes of helicopters and Vietnamese jungle and Captain Willard in a hotel room, all with some background, intense, progressive rock music, you know you are not going to watch an ordinary movie. This is something special, this plays with your mind.Scene after scene, the movie keeps getting weirder, but it's such a slippery slope up until the end that you don't even realize that what you are watching is completely bizarre. From the beginning, Coppola sets the rules of the game and makes the public abide to them. And once you're deep down in the movie, there's no way out. This is not an ordinary Vietnam War movie, yet in its insanity and surrealism there's no other movie that depicts the cruelty and madness of war so well. Coppola makes no effort in trying to show a realistic Vietnam War, but because of that is that no other director has fully apprehended the meaning of war so well. To understand the traumas that war veterans go through, it is not enough with just showing a lot of cruel scenes, blood and friends and foes dying, you need to go beyond reality, you need to grasp the subconscious part of it. And Coppola does it terrificly.Music deserves a special mention. A big part of the state in mind in which Coppola puts you in is because of the amazing soundtrack. I had never seen another movie with such a good use of sound effects and music in order to convey the desired message.I didn't really know what to expect of this movie before seeing it. I only knew is about Vietnam. I really did not expect this movie to have the effect it had on me. Needless to say, this movie is a must- see.",9,0,2,5 April 2015
In the Name of the Father," A good social critique, but not much more
","Don't get me wrong, I really liked this movie. But it's a good movie, not a great one. And I don't even think it has intentions of being it, but rather making a statement on the Northern Ireland conflict, about the UK, and about democratic legal system's as a whole. And above all, it wants to make Gerry Conlon's story reach a wider audience. I seriously cannot believe what happened to him, it's completely outrageous and it really makes you think about the whole idea of Justice, judges, juries, laws, police and so on. Besides the story, which is good (and even better when you keep in the back of your mind that it really happened), the best of this movie is Daniel Day-Lewis' acting. He is probably the best living actor, I'd dare to say. Since it's the earliest movie I've seen of him, I seriously thought that he's actually Irish and that only later he learned to do other accents. Man, he really sounds Irish!",7,1,1,18 August 2014
Dallas Buyers Club," An archetypal Oscar movie
","After you've seen enough of them, you begin to identify their characteristics. There's this particular type of music that are tailored for the awards season, and more specifically, for the Oscars. They are released on a certain date, and they have a certain cinematography and editing. The plot usually revolves around a certain character that faces a big challenge, usually due to a systemic injustice (eg: slavery, or the way pharmaceutical companies make business with AIDS medicine), and in the process of overcoming this challenge, the character goes through a deep transformation and comes out as a hero. If it's based on a real story, even better. And this is somehow bothering: it's a cold reminder that after all, Hollywood is an industry, and within this industry there's a particular niche for movies that are nominated in the Oscars, who aim at a specific target market and make money out of priding themselves as 'quality movie', as certified by the Academy. It's almost a joke the way in which the first ten months of the year Hollywood releases cr*ppy movies with weak plot lines and millions spent in visual effects, and then towards the awards season cinemas are flooded with allegedly 'better quality' movies. Dallas Buyers Club is one of these.But at the end of the day, the Oscars do award better than average Hollywood movies, and they Oscar movies are indeed of 'better quality' than the rest of what Hollywood makes. In this case, a special effort was made for the casting. Matthew McConaughey and Jared Leto are simply superb, and they definitely deserve their Oscar for Best Performance. Both of them are unrecognizable in their roles, and they pull out an amazing acting when interpreting their characters. Of course, the role of a terminally-ill AIDS patient is specifically designed for giving the actor enough cues to pull out an Oscar-worthy performance, but it works. Jennifer Garner is not bad, but she is completely overshadowed by the other two actors. The story is pretty good, quite predictable (after all, the character is told at the beginning of the movie that is going to die) but enjoyable, and definitely emotional. So while you have to be psychologically prepared for watching a tough movie about AIDS, you will definitely not regret having watched this movie.",8,1,4,8 March 2015
American History X," An intense critique of where can intrasocietal tension take us
","This is a very shocking movie. The story is very good and the actors perform it greatly. But what really shocks you is the idea that it is an entirely feasible situation; that the ideas the characters express in the movies is also expressed by real people in real life situations. Although this movie revolves around Neo-Nazis, it does reflect upon tensions within society as a whole. It's not only about skinheads and their crazy WW2 ideologies, it's in general about the misconception of delimiting 'us' and 'them', about failing to see how human all of us are, and instead turning to the humanness of 'my' group, and the lack of humanity of everyone else. It is about the very human attitude of putting the blame into other people, and it is also about that other very human attitude of guiding our behaviors according to our feelings as opposed to common sense. It is about the importance of the teenage years for the future adult, and it is about how traumatic can it be to realize one was wrong. It is a movie that definitely makes you think.",8,0,2,20 October 2014
Spirited Away," You won't get your eyes off the screen
","Not even 5 minutes after the movie started, the main character finds herself already among creepy spirits and scary parents-turned-into-pigs. From that on, you can't stop watching. You can't help but feel amazed at the characters' look, the witch with the gigantic head and even bigger nose, the creepy No-Face that can only moan and IS ALWAYS SO DISTURBING, the disgusting river spirit that is so well portrayed as if it smelled really bad that it is almost as if you could actually smell it.The more you are into the movie, the more hooked up you are. The plot is not the easiest to follow, and some scenes are more for the sake of exposing amazing visual effects than for the development of the plot, which sometimes seems like a thin layer of ice that can break at any moment. Even taking this into account, this movie deserves an almost perfect score: it is so beautiful it gives you goosebumps, for real.",9,0,1,13 November 2014
Saving Private Ryan," The Ultimate WWII Blockbuster
","This is such a Spielberg movie, such a Hollywood blockbuster, such a WWII drama, I can't even. All the cheesy dialogues, the sentimental scenes, the horror of the war, the pathetic American nationalism with the movie beginning and finishing with a take of the American flag, the old war Veteran speaking to the grave, all the possible war tropes (the nice guy who is afraid of killing, the highly moral doctor, the macho Vin Diesel, the Jew fighting against Germans, the rebel who doesn't follow the Captain's orders, and of course the heroic, brave Captain)... I've seen these a million times, though probably never as well put-together as in Saving Private Ryan. So I guess you could say that it is, among its kind, the best; even if I'm not a fan of that kind.The opening scene is a whole different story, though. The Normandy landing is quite masterly filmed, and it probably ranks among the best opening scenes ever (can't really think of any other opening scene as memorable). It's cruel, bloody, and impressive.The ending, on the other hand, really put me down. Everything was so cliché, and what's up with the Allied troops ending thanks to the last-minute, never-mentioned help of the Air force? Script writers, take note: NEVER let the plot be solved by an element that you never mentioned to the public. Nothing creaks the illusion of reality as much.",7,1,2,22 May 2015
The Pianist," Never again
","Soundtrack for this review: El pianista del gueto de Varsovia by Jorge DrexlerIt is hard to review this movie. It is not easy to evaluate this movie in terms of its acting, its quality, its directing, with an armchair attitude that ignores the crudeness and harshness of real life. It is hard to say phrases like 'Roman Polanski, perhaps due to its own experience, captures perfectly the feeling of everyday life of Polish Jews during the Second World War, its sadness and despair but also the tiny moments of hope', however true that might be.It is very hard to rate this just as a movie, and not as a reminder for the human race of what are we capable of. I'm often reluctant to watch Holocaust movies because I know beforehand that they will have very hard to digest moments, and they are almost an act of masochism, two hours of intense suffering. But they are necessary, they are real stories that urge to be told, and need to be heard so that they don't happen again.In a world where islamophobic parties are winning votes in Europe, where Americans proudly wave a flag that is the symbol of slavery in front of their president, these movies are indispensable. We cannot allow ourselves to fall into the collective madness that Germany fell into between 1933 and 1945. We should have learnt by now that technology has allowed the State to mobilize way too many resources, and the extermination of an entire group of people is only a button away. Not to mention the fact that these things still happen in more remote corners of the world, where they don't destabilize global geopolitics. So it would be too frivolous from my side to evaluate Polanski's direction or Brody's acting, as if this was fiction. The feeling I have after having watched The Pianist is not the one of a film critic that passively observes reality from behind his desk, but an active one, the imperative of making sure that nothing like this ever happens again.",8,1,1,20 July 2015
The Grand Budapest Hotel," Colours, fetishism and many many famous actors
","Above all, what makes this movie exceptional is how beautifully shot it is. Every scenes is a pleasure to the eye, be it because of the arrangement of the objects on screen, because of all the fetishist display of vintage early XX century objects (such as a key, or a camera, or a pair of glasses), because of the actors' expressions and gestures, or because of the colours. Lord, how beautiful the colours of this movie are! All the scenes are so colorful yet carefully arranged, I want to live in this world! I think, that's pretty much what this movie is about. Making you wanting to live in that world that got lost in the WW1 trenches. The story is constantly surrounded by an aura of nostalgia, of a lost world (though it is impossible not to think of the other part of the world that this movie does not show: all the contradictions and inequalities of early XX century Europe, the main cause of all the 'isms' that fought at the World Wars). I imagine that someone spent a lot of time in flea markets trying to look for props for this movie, and I would have loved to be that person.Regarding the story in itself, it is not necessarily unforgettable. It almost seems as if the plot was just an excuse to depict the world in which it takes place. But it does keep you entertained, with many bizarre scenes and many hilarious moments. But hey, it does have one hell of an amazing cast, and it is impossible not to keep noticing 'Hey! Look who that is!' every now and then. Some of the amazing actors that acted in this movie, like Harvey Keitel, were impossible to recognize; I would only think to myself 'That guy seems familiar...', but I would have never been able to tell it was him until reading the cast list. Something similar happened with Tilda Swinton. Overall, I can fully recommend this movie. It's not deep, hard to digest, or moving, but it will give you some good time.",8,1,3,13 September 2014
Django Unchained," Mainstream Tarantino
","Tarantino is a great director, no doubt about that. Every movie he makes its a truly pleasure to watch, in every detail, from the music, to the camera shots, the dialogs, the acting, everything. Django Unchained is no exception. It is fun, enjoyable, and though long, it never gets boring.What I did miss, however, was some of the more intricate plot lines of other Tarantino movies such as Pulp Fiction, Reservoir Dogs, or Inglorious Bastards. Tarantino does seem to enjoy making Westerns, judging by the fact he is now doing another one. And the genre definitely allows for the spectacular bloodshed he so enjoys filming. But the story of Django misses the dramatic unraveling of events that is so enjoyable about Tarantino, it is quite straightforward and the good and bad guys are very easy to identify, and sometimes the plot line gets very predictable (even though Tarantino has the talent to make even a predictable storyline to be enjoyable to watch; the devil is in the details)When the movie had just come out, there was a lot of fuss about the use of the n-word. Even for me, that I am not American, it gets pretty disturbing and uncomfortable. I don't have anything to say about the race issues with this movie that has not been said before, but I can totally understand how people got mad about it. Race and slavery are such sensitive issues, that a white person must be very careful to not make it a racist movie, even if the intentions are completely the opposite, as it is clear here. There is virtually no white American who is a white guy in this movie, and it is clear that Tarantino himself is not a racist. But once again, the devil is in the details.All of this criticism should not make it seem like it is a bad movie. At all. It is definitely something you don't see everyday in Cinemas. Tarantino is definitely one of the best American directors alive, and chances are that whatever other movie you find on cable one night, will probably be worse than Django Unchained.",8,0,2,25 July 2015
The Elephant Man," We the Victorians
","This movie touches upon many issues discussed in Academia by Michel Foucault, and I highly doubt it was coincidental. The Elephant Man is a character that could only come from the Victorian era and the rich duality that comes with it. The double personality of John Merrich, who goes from a gentle and refined man in the day to a poor beast that can only scream in the night, reflects the tension and evolutions of the power relations of that time. The oppressed goes from being a silent subject suffering from a brutal circus to being part of a much more subtle, scientific and bourgeois circus. Power structures are sharpened, but this comes together with an improvement of the objective welfare of the subject, who is now eternally grateful for this new form of control.David Lynch is a very clever guy, and he manages to really convey the feeling of the time, with the use of sounds, black and white, and dialogs. You feel the sadness of the Elephant Man, you share it. What does it say of us that we are so interested in these Victorian characters, that we can relate so much to somebody like the Elephant Man?",7,0,0,3 February 2016
Mulholland Drive," A movie to be re-watched
","This is a mesmerizing movie, and a narrative masterpiece. But also, let's face it, it is a failed TV-pilot. This duality is central to Mulholland Drive, and it is present throughout the movie. It is hard to tell where the genius begins and the failure ends, which is probably what makes it so fascinating. Why does a certain subplot seem so lame? Why is a certain character behaving in such a clichÃ© way? Are they symbolizing a super-stylized version of reality constructed by a failed actress' subconscious or are we just watching the takes of a failed, bad TV project? Of course, then came the interpretations. And some of them make a lot of sense. I think the whole 'It is all Diane's dream' does make sense to a certain extent, yet at the same time it is, at least, very fascinating that the most surreal, irrational scenes (the last half an hour) are the ones which are supposed to be taking place in the 'real' word.Though, at the end of the day, the take-home message of this film is, what is the real world? Mulholland Drive tackles the issue that has pervaded art since antiquity, of how to mimic the real world so to convince the audience, how to play God with a bunch of props and actors. The words spoken at the Club Silencio resonate in the viewer after the closing credits: there is no orchestra, it's just a recording. Our senses think they are in front of something real, but it is no more than an artifact.This is indeed, a classic of our time. And as such, it is a must-watch. But don't expect to understand it at the first time. Because, in the end, there's not much to be understood. As a public, we demand rationality, clarity and coherent plot lines from film-makers; and Lynch's answer to that demand is a surrealistic reminder that movies, just like real life, are not always what we want them to be.",9,2,4,20 May 2016
The Imitation Game," Never let truth spoil you a good story
","What is truly amazing for this film is that it is based on a real story. Really this Cambridge professor helped Britain win the war by cracking a code? He really saved millions of people? And nobody knew about it for 50 years, and he ended up killing himself after having been forced to chemical castration because of homosexuality? And we're talking of the founding father of Computer science? If I hadn't heard of Turing before, I would have a hard time believing this is a real story.So this movie is brilliant because the story of Alan Turing is unbelievable. There's something intriguing about secret services, all these Top Secret files that few people in the world know about. Because we don't know what they say, we can expand our imagination limitlessly when wondering what do they actually say. As far as we are concerned, they might entirely change the way we conceive history. And this fact, the idea that Turing died without ever being recognized on his contribution in WWII because it was Top Secret, it's what makes you sit on the edge of the chair when watching this movie.The problem is that, when you do a little research, you find out that the movie takes HUGE creative freedoms when it comes to truthfully depicting the story. It creates struggles where they never existed, completely alters the nature of Turing's work at Blechley Work, and makes Turing meet people who in the movie blackmail him but that he actually never met (to just name a few...). All of this to give more drama to the story. And they succeed on it.Then yes, of course, Benedict Cumberbatch pulls out an amazing performance. The role of a compulsive genius allows him to show all his potential. The portrayal of Turing as a complete asocial allows the script to have a couple of very funny dialogues, that actually make you laugh. And Keira Knightley is not bad, but I bet the real life woman was not as beautiful.What makes this movie not perfect? It's actually full of common places. The one cheesy tagline that is repeated two or three times across the movie. The sudden realization that owes itself to a completely unrelated comment but requires the hero to run back to his workplace. The cliché dramatic pauses before an important line. Tywin Lannister acting as Tywin Lannister, but with WWII uniform. Little things that, overall, don't spoil the movie that much. It's still very much worth watching.",8,5,11,22 February 2015
Annie Hall," The best of Allen
","It's beyond discussion that this is Woody Allen's masterpiece. It's so identical to aaaall of his movies, yet it takes all the distinctive marks to a higher level. The classical Woody Allen playing as himself, the lovely Diane Keaton being a mess, New York, intellectual parties with pretentious conversations, hilarious dialogues that mix Jew jokes with literary references; not to mention the beautiful cinematography, the sudden scene changes and the kind of intemporality in which the movie takes us into. There's no cohesive plot line, it's a bunch of scenes put together without before or after, exactly the way memory works. Exactly the way one thinks of a relationship during a break up: just individual pieces that somehow tie together, beautiful, lovely, unreal memories. So unreal that in Singer's memory it makes perfect sense that he starts talking about Annie to passers-by, or that he breaks the fourth wall and starts talking to us the public, or that Annie's family can have a conversation with Singer's family at different moments and places. Annie Hall is the ultimate break up movie. Forget 500 Days of summer, The Notebook, or anything that came after 1977. They stand as ridiculously fake, Hollywoodesque, cheesy. This movie does not have any pretensions of rightfully portraying reality, but in its crazy and surreal way it is far more loyal to the mood of somebody who is going through a break-up.",10,0,0,24 April 2015
2001: A Space Odyssey," What the hell did I just watch?
","I'm very confused right now. I definitely did not get what this movie is about. It certainly isn't just another space adventure movie. I'm not sure it would classify as sci-fi either. I see it more as a trip inside Kubrick's mind, perhaps? In any case, it is not necessarily the plot what matters more in this movie.This movie is definitely a visual masterpiece. It is truly amazing that Kubrick managed to pull out so many visual effects and tricks in 1968, and the spaceship scenes have nothing to envy to those of the latest space blockbuster. Many, many times they seemed a bit too slooow, but I'm guessing Kubrick did it on purpose to give a sense of the immensity of the cosmos. In any case, it is beautiful to see spaceships dancing a waltz, but shortening some scenes wouldn't have hurt. And then there's the prologue with the monkeys, which is a whole different story. Not only it takes twenty minutes to tell something it could have been told in much less, but it is also immensely puzzling. It definitely is there for a reason, I'm sure about it, but right now I can't seem to grasp its meaning. After finishing this review, I'll see what Internet has to say about it.And then there's the ending. Oh wow. I give this movie 8 stars, but the 8th star goes entirely to the final part: just before it I was thinking this movie deserved 7 stars. The landing on Jupiter is a wonderful example of the psychedelia of the 60s taken to a big screen. That sequence alone probably takes around ten minutes, but it is so enjoyable you don't even notice them. Then the very final scene is the most intriguing piece of cinema I remember right now. What does it mean? In what way is it related to the rest of the movie? I'm guessing Kubrick wanted the public to live the theatre with this questions unanswered. Thankfully, post-2001 viewers have the blessing of Internet, which I now turn to in the hope it clears up my doubts.",8,1,5,27 November 2015
The Matrix Reloaded," Not worth of its prequel
","Obviously the Wachowskis had set their own bar quite high with that amazing movie The Matrix is. And obviously its sequel would not have such a mind-blowing plot like the first movie did, but it would just limit itself to narrate Neo's path to try to disable the Matrix after realizing he is the One. I watched the 1999 movie yesterday, and today I woke up thinking about it, which I think it proves what a good movie it was. And I couldn't wait to watch this movie, because I was obsessed with knowing how on Earth could the Matrix be disabled.But this movie is not about it. It's just another action movie. Perhaps it was quite pioneer in that sub-genre that super hero movies are (which are now much more widespread than when this trilogy was released), but, honestly, I'm not into that kind of stuff. What I'd loved from the first movies were all the philosophical themes it dealt with, but these are hardly seen in Matrix Revolutions. You've got instead lots of kung fu fighting, cars being blown up with a katana (!?) and visual effects that might have been impressive for the time but that they now seem taken from a PlayStation.What saved it from giving it a lower score was the scene with the Architect, which is by far the best scene of the movie. The Architect is quite a fascinating character that reminded me of the Masonic Great Architect of the Universe, and I like how his lines, very well written, bring about some nietzchean Doctrine of the Eternal Recurrence to that contemporary Plato's Cave that the Matrix is. If I had seen this movie in the cinema, this scene would have been worth the ticket. You've also got some good ideas about causality and the dilemma freedom-fate, specially in Morpheus' character, who insists on people's free choices but blindly believes in a prophecy that would obviously bind people's actions to an a priori determined course of action. But who cares about it, people just want to to watch Neo stop bullets and fight thousands of Agent Smiths at the same time.",6,1,4,10 August 2014
It's a Wonderful Life," I cried. A lot.
","I don't think I would be able of ever cast an objective statement regarding the quality of this movie. It's not one of this movies I can objectively say which rating does it deserve in a 1 to 10 scale, because it reached something in me way beyond objectifiable maths and numbers. Yes, it may sound super cheesy, but it did reach my heart. I don't even know how it happened, but it was definitely a slow, progressive proccess. The more you get to know George's life, the more difficult it is to wish the best for that man even if he doesn't exist beyond the flat screen. Art is very much about creating an illusion of reality, and some say that if an art piece doesn't cast a spell on you that makes you believe you're appreciating the real world, then it is bad art. When you're reading a novel and you're able to abstract from it and make sense of the fact that all the characters are just plane words on a blank page, is because the spell was not correctly cast and the book you're reading is a bad one. Well, at some point during the movie I stopped to think why on earth was I so touched by just a bunch of pixels in my computer's screen, because I couldn't understand how could I care so much for a person that doesn't even exist. I guess that the answer to that is that people like George do exist, and we're surrounded everywhere by those people who make our lives better, and that sometimes life doesn't give back to them what they deserve. I guess that's the reason why, in the last scene, I just started to cry like a baby, not just a timid tear, but lots of them, up until the movie finished. I don't remember having cried this way for a movie before. I still need to digest this movie, it'll take me a while.",10,6,11,8 September 2014
The Silence of the Lambs," Now I don't wanna leave my room anymore
","Man, that was scary. I hadn't been so scared with a movie in quite a long time, maybe since Shutter Island. This movie has everything a good thriller needs, from the long, slow shots that hide more than what they show, to the creepy music and creepy scenarios. The mysterious dialogues in which the actors are watching at the camera are particularly good, and that sense that Hannibal Lecter is actually talking to you is difficult to forget. And Anthony Hopkins' character didn't get a well-deserved place in popular culture and Haloween costumes for nothing: it is by far the best of this movie. From his amazing way of speaking, to his lines, going through all the security paraphernalia around him (which undoubtedly help to create the feeling his quite a dangerous man), everything shouts 'You're gonna have nightmares with this'. Not to forget the quite memorable scene of his escape, one of the highest peaks of the movie.Buffalo Bill's character is also pretty damn good, and every time a scene involves him you just want the scene to end before anything bad happens (which, given the character's unstable personality, might happen at any time). The final persecution scene is heart-stopping, and is way too long for any viewer's sanity (specially the last tiny bit with night Vision glasses).And Jodie Foster? Yes, she is not bad. I specially like her West Virginia accent. And the fact that she is a young woman talking to an old, crazy, creepy serial killer contributes something to the movie that could never be present in Red Dragon, for example.",8,0,0,12 August 2014
The Truman Show," Life is a Creation
","From the moment we are old enough to grab a marker with our small fingers, we toy with the idea of creating our own world within this one. Artists are simply the lucky ones who manage to grow up while retaining the possibility of making a living out of the creative act. But the idea of playing God is inherent to all of us, so much that the idea that we are simply part of a bigger creation is deeply ingrained within our cultural genoma.The Truman Show takes this to the ultimate end: the possibility of creating an entire world from scratch, the possibility of playing with someone's life and control it in every single extent. It is noteworthy how such an experiments ends up looking an awful lot like George Orwell's 1984. In the end, God might not be much more than just a (benevolent?) totalitarian dictator.The resemblance to Plato's allegory of the Cave is quite clear. And as such, it is not hard to figure out what will happen once Truman begins to notice that his everyday life is simply shadows cast on the wall of the cave. No matter how much the Creator tries to distract him, the idea is already incepted in his brain: he will try to leave the cave.But the notion that the outer world, outside the cave, is our own world, is somewhat disturbing. One tends to think of Plato's allegory of the cave as a quest for the Utopian, but if the world outside the cave is our own, dirty and imperfect world, wouldn't it make more sense to remain in the cave? Confronting ourselves with the real world will render all quest for the Ideal futile. No wonder the existentialist had such a hard time once they denied the existence of God. The only thing left to do, then, is to turn the allegory of the cave upside down: if the outer world is so imperfect, we might look for perfection within our own, personal caves (which is what Creators do).The Truman Show is a very engaging movie, that tricks us with its looks of yet another Jim Carrey blockbuster, only to have us trapped into a thought-provoking experience that will keep us awake at night. It is a turning point in Carrey's career, in which he proves that laughs is not the only thing he can provoke in the viewers. It is a movie full of hope, that encourages all of us to leave our own, personal caves.",8,0,0,20 May 2016
The Matrix," First XXI century movie
","1999 was an excellent year movie-wise. American Beauty, Fight club, The Green Mile, Being John Malkovich... all excellent movies. Now this is something different. This is not just a great movie, it also marks the end of the 20th century and the beginning of the 2000s decade. I mean, just how more 2000s does it get than Keanu Reeves in a black robe avoiding bullets? The Matrix is a classic. It has already become a classic. From the red-and-blue pills scene to the 'I know kung fu' quote (the decade's 'We'll always have Paris' or 'I am your father', if you allow me the exaggeration), going through Neo's awakening schene, this movie is already deeply embedded in popular culture. And it deserves to: it is beautifully shot, the story is very well-paced, it is entertaining and it does include enough elements potentially iconic (Morpheus' sunglasses, Agent Smith's accent...). But what makes this movie a classic, beyond anything else, is the issues it deals with. What makes a classic is its 'timeless quality', as Wikipedia says. And for something to be timeless, it must relate to Humanity's core, those things that can be reach both me and someone who was born in 2 A.D. Now something that every human can relate to is feelings. Love, pain, fear of death. Which is why most classics are love stories (just think of Romeo and Juliet). But this is not what The Matrix mainly brings about. What makes The Matrix a classic is that it deals with those big questions that have troubled philosophers (and people in general) since Socrates' times. I'm not gonna list all the philosophical issues in here because somebody has probably already done it, but let me quickly enumerate a few from the top of my mind: duality mind-body, evil genius dilemma, freedom as moral self-direction (I cannot set free somebody else but myself), man-machine relationship, Utopia, the issue of fate, the 'what makes a human being' question (our own impulses according to Mouse), my freedom's interaction and interdependence with the subjectivities around me... If I was a philosophy teacher, I would totally screen this movie on the first day of classes. Needless to say this is a must-see, specially that hour between the red pill and the plot's main complication, just before all the action starts. That part of the movie is worth watching three, four times, because it's not something you see everyday.",9,1,2,10 August 2014
Back to the Future," Authentically entertaining
","You should not watch Back to the Future looking for serious, intriguing thought experiments regarding time travel. You should watch it for what it is: a Hollywood blockbuster that seeks to make money through people's entertainment. And the profit-seeking motive is quite clear from the beginning: you see brand placement EVERYWHERE. Back to the Future, then, has all the ingredients for a Hollywood blockbuster: funny characters, unlikely plot denouements that you see coming way before it happens, very cliché characters such as the town bully, the timid nerd that becomes a hero, the damsel in distress. Also, as a 1985 blockbuster, it includes racism and sexism that would probably not be tolerated nowadays, such as the main actor shouting 'the Libyans!' as a synonym of 'the bad guys!', or the main character literally planning to abuse of a girl, which happens to be his mother.That being said, the movie does achieve it main goal: it is truly entertaining. I'm not the kind of person who laughs out loud when watching comedies, but in this case I couldn't avoid it. There are truly remarkable situations, especially with Marty's mother. The doctor's character is also particularly well-made, and the actor's performance is notable. In general, the creators did a good job in showing all the different funny situations that would arise from bringing an 80s kid to 1955, such as him playing rock'n roll in front of an awed audience, or Marty saying that a TV program that is just being aired is a classic that he watched in a rerun.So once you understand you shouldn't have high hopes for this movie, and that you should only look for having a good time, this movie will be very satisfactory. There are more artistic movies, better written plots, better directed ones, even funnier ones. But very often, these movies don't remain in the collective imaginary in the way this did it. The way this movie is part of today's pop culture should not be understated.",7,2,4,20 July 2015
