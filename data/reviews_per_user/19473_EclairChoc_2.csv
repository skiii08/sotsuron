Requiem for a Dream," As bad as 'Reefers madness'
","Yes, completely exaggerated vision of drugs taking, exactly as if you wanted to speak about alcohol and started to describe the winos at the corner shop begging for some change to buy cheap booze. Trainspotting was right on, but if people believe that this film is a true and real normal reflection of drug addiction then they are completely intoxicated not by drugs but by the medias, father Christmas is for you as well... How sad it is that this film is so stereotyped;:drugs equal hell. But it never asks the question why do people take drugs, may be it it because they want a good time and forget about their boring lives and do you know what, may be they often get a good time out of it Remember the difference between enjoying a bottle of wine from time to time and being an alcoholic, the same is true with drugs. A lot of people know that but it is never reflected in films, certainly not in this one.",1,5,11,22 November 2008
V for Vendetta," Yes, Yes, bring back Guy Fawkes from the dead
","Yes,Yes, let's bring back Guy Fawkes, am I repeating myself ? Lets bonfire the Parliament,Guy we need you more than ever. Am I going to be arrested for that ? Yes, they are knocking at the door. Whatever the story line, it tries to wake up the English people to what is happening to them. It is a comedy, but along the lines of George Orwell, so just enjoy and think that beyond the cheap storyline it is quite right on. Thanks, Stephen Fry, always at the right time and the right place. I saw a critic saying that he doesn't like a film with a 'message' well, may be sometimes it is not that bad that film makers try to express themselves rather than to sell soft cheddar.",10,0,7,13 July 2009
