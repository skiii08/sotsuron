Antz," Political 1900's animated look alike.
","A very interesting film if you've ever learned about the political machines and unions of the early 20th century.  I actually saw it for extra credit in my American History class, and it was very enjoyable.  An amazing casting job, and you're in for a laugh when you see how much Sly's character resembles him!  HA!Anyway... I really was shocked to find how 'adultish' this movie is.  I mean, it's not rated R or anything, but parents should watch out for a little bit of bad language.  I'm just saying that kids might not enjoy it as much as older people, like myself, did.",Null,0,0,2 January 1999
The Big Lebowski," Plot seemed ok.....
","What a product of modern lack of morals.  I heard this movie was funny, and it had an interesting plot.  Boy was I disappointed.  I'm not one to wince at a bit of vulgar language, but this movie had nothing but sexual references, horrible vituperation (you'd think movie writers could build up their vocabulary a bit), and on top of that progressed so slowly I think watching paint dry could have been more exciting.  I feel sorry for anyone who was entertained by this Hollywood slop.  I didn't even make it to the end of the movie, what a waste of $4.50.",1,15,50,2 January 1999
