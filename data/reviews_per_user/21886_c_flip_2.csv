Requiem for a Dream," The most impressive piece of cinema I have ever seen.
","While reading another user commentary I stumbled across a line that said that this movie was one of the most important movies ever made, and I firmly agree with that statement.  Everything about this movie is ingenious. From its heart wrenching original score to the brilliant acting jobs by the entire ensemble this move is a spellbinding work of art.  The subject matter is handled far better than any movie before it.  Jared Leto and Marlon Wayans emerged from their homes in the shallow end of the talent pool. Both gave amazing performances as junkies who will do anything for a fix. While I wasn't shocked by the display of talent by both Jennifer Connely and Ellen Burstyn (because I was already aware of the immense talent that each of these two women have),  I was equally pleased with their performances. The fact that this movie was not nominated for Best Picture, Best Director, Best Cinematography, and Best Original Score is an outrage, but it is far too late to do anything about that.  It is also an outrage that someone as bland as Julia Roberts won the Oscar for best actress over the amazing performance of Burstyn in this film.This film is one of the most disturbing and depressing movies I have ever seen.  I don't suggest that you see this film alone, but I do suggest (almost demand) that you see this film.  It is a lesson in film-making, and one of the most amazing ones ever.",10,1,2,30 August 2001
The Fast and the Furious," The cars are fast, but the acting made me furious.....
","What do you get when you take Days of Thunder, add in two younger actors, and two equally attractive young actresses, and then put it all on the streets?  A good idea.  However, the additions of such clueless individuals as Ja Rule, and many other small players made my head hurt.  The stunts were great, the cars were 'Pretty' fast, and the women....nice.  The script, ohhhhh my god, it made me wish I was watching Prison of the Dead. Now....another question...What do you get when you have two bad actors staring in a movie with a horrible script?  Several things.  One, an unemotional reading of the lines on the screen which came across as totally bland and seemed like it was a cold reading.  Two, moments that were supposed to be funny, but just couldn't pull it off.  Third, same as the latter, but with emotional moments.  Fourth......one really bad and shameless plug....'You can have any brew you want, as long as it's a Corona.'  Ow! My aching head! Ow!This movie does not deserve praise, it does not deserve to be making the money it has been, and I want my two hours of living back that I wasted giving this film a chance.What have we learned from this? Well we learned that: 'I was in The Skulls.' and 'I was in Pitch Black.' ....are not impressive listings on one's resume.Don't waste your time....",1,4,9,11 July 2001
