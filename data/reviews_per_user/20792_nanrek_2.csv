The Blair Witch Project," The less you know the more you will enjoy this movie.
",I think this is a very cleaver and creative movie for a thirty-five thousand dollar budget. I would have enjoyed it more if I hadn't read so much about it before seeing it. It didn't live up to the expectations generated by the reviews. 'Night of the Living Dead' is still my all time favorite low budget movie.,10,1,2,7 August 1999

","The only thing I got out of this movie was a pain in the butt after watching it for 3 hours. I've liked most of Brad Pitt's movies, but this one was a real dud. Brad is suppose to be Death, but he seems more like an idiot savant - a cross between the characters in movies such as 'Being There', 'The Rainman' and 'Charley', etc. Maybe  the reason people in real life are able to cheat death frequently is because death is semi-retarded! I cannot recommend this movie to anyone unless, of course, they are already dead and don't get bored easily.",1,3,6,16 November 1998
