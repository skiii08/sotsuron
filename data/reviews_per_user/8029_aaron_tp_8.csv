Catch Me If You Can," You can't catch Tom's acting
","Tom Hanks stole the acting in this movie.  Although Leonardo was impressive I feel he still lacks any real convincing character with any of his movies. He just seems to act the same whereas Tom Hanks will slide into his role and tune in perfectly. Thus said the film itself has it's moments.  Has a few flaws (rare for most movies not to though) but casting that aside and releasing it's a movie (based on a true story) it's enjoyable.  I am not one for spilling out the plot on movies but are we, the public, really think that Leonardo can pull off being a young 16 year old at the beginning of the movie?? Maybe when he was in 'The Beach' movie he looked alot younger but he is past that age now so that was very unconvincing!  It did tend to drag on a bit in places but then we are amused with the way Leonardo's character is always misleading/tricking Tom Hanks and escaping.  Makes a bit of a mockery of the FBI so let's hope they don't have any more 'Tom Hanks' guys working at the bureau anymore.  I think it's a 'one viewing movie' title but would perhaps watch it on TV but wouldn't go out of my way to record or buy it!",Null,0,1,24 January 2003
Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl," Once again, pro performance from Depp
","Some pirate movies can be swashbuckling poor so it is a joy to see such a stunner blast it's way on to the big screen.  The visual effects are extremely clever specially with the fighting scenes in different lighting at the end. The cast was superb, especially Jack Davenport who started his career in the BBC 'This Life' series.  The storyline is not the strongest around but it doesn't matter with this film as your swept up with the fighting scenes and the performance of Johnny Depp.  You may have notice that Mr Depp isn't on the big screen much and this is due to him carefully selecting the right movie to star in and he is, most of the time, never wrong with his selection.  On this occasion his accent and slightly camp/drunkenness style Jack Sparrow character was down to a tee.  Orlando Bloom's acting was not the best par from his Lord Of The Rings 'legolas' performance.  All in all a joy to watch and when it's on general release in the UK from next Friday I would expect it to be a the top of the box office for a while.",Null,0,0,2 August 2003
The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring," One of the best films you will see
","History in the making. Has taken such a long time to produce such an epic. If you have not seen this film then it's time to buy it, no don't rent it, just go out there and by the special extended version on DVD.  True collectors item. Superb. Watch it again and again........................... Sit back and forget about life's troubles and enjoy.  I would say this is not for young kids specially when ole Kate scares the life outta you when Frodo offers her the ring. Yikes....",Null,0,0,10 January 2003
The Matrix Revolutions," The Trilogy Letdown!
","I have written several reviews of various films on the imdb database. Some long, some short.  On this occasion, moderately short.  Why? Well there isn't much to talk about because this is the worst episode out of all three. The first Matrix movie made ground breaking history, the action was great and the storyline kept the film moving. Reloaded was a nice middle sequence with superb effects when introduced to Zion and the freeway action scenes was second to none.  Revolutions - Well I though there would be a revolution in the cinema at the end as most people walked out saying how disappointing it was.  Why? Well no storyline, hardly any matrix style slowdown fighting scenes compared to 1 & 2 and it left so many questions unanswered and the ending was so open to any fourth edition.  Some characters were just thrown into the confusion possible due to the Brothers having some extra cash to throw away, come on who the hell was the woman firing the futuristic missile launchers at the diggers??? What is the point of her?  The plus point of the whole movie was seeing those blown up ED209's (sorry I have forgotten the correct name for them) blow the c**p outta the sentinels.  Those fighting machines rock big time.  Out of all 3 movies - the first matrix is still the best by far.  I did feel this was going to be a big film, and yes it will make alot of money but I reckon majority of us will say it's the worst out of all three!  Maybe people will talk about it for a few weeks but when the final Lord Of The Rings is out in December Matrix Revolutions will be quietly swept under the carpet!!  4/10",Null,0,0,7 November 2003
Terminator 3: Rise of the Machines," It is time for more action
","I had heard rumours that this movie wasn't that good so I was getting nervous when I sat down to watch it.  I came out extremely satisfied that the movie was VERY good.  I won't spoil the storyline but it is so open for a Terminator 4 at the end that I wouldn't be surprised if we see another addition to the series soon.  Only problem with that is if they don't shoot the movie soon then Arnie would be too old. Back to the film.  Although not as dark as the first Terminator movie, this brings alot of realism to the fact that we are in a nuclear age and the graphic reality of a possible nuclear war.  I left the movie feeling happy with the special effects (but Arnie still can't act) but a bit depressed with the ever possible threat of, apart from Terminators running around, the severe threat of our own real life nuclear war.  Let's face it the amount of computers that do control our defence systems in this country could always malfunction and any backup system to prevent this from happening could also go wrong as well.  Depressed you yet?????  Think about it........(Slight spoiler) The budget of this movie was amazing (I have forgotten the actual figure but I think it's around 170 million US dollars) and one can see where they blew alot of their cash, like the first chase scene with a fire truck and a large crane truck through the streets pursing John Connor. Wow that was good. I was expecting more T800's running around in an extended futuristic scene at the beginning and one can only hope that in T4 there will be.  I had heard that there was about 10 minutes of T800's shooting at the beginning but T2 had more of that than this one so I was disappointed.  I also feel that the UK cinema rating (BBFC) organization must of had a back hand deal from the movie studios to reduce the certification as it's 'R' in the states and over here it's 12a. For non UK citizens this means that children under the age of 12 can attend to view but must be accompanied by an adult. (Spoiler) Well for those who have watched it, would you really want a 7 year old to see the scene in the cop car where the TX is controlling the steering wheel through the cops stomach that it just punched through??? Gross!!! This movie should have been a 15 in the UK and shame on the BBFC for not doing so. Watch this movie for serious Hollywood big budget special effect action and see just how depressing they leave the ending - T4 must be round the corner, hopefully Arnie won't be drawing his pension when they get around to shooting it. Make sure the cinema you view this film in has a great sound system as you will love all the explosions and bullets flying around you.",Null,0,0,2 August 2003
The Transporter," As bad as 'The One' (Spoiler Alert)
","Jason Statham seems to have a problem with acting. He was very good in 'Snatch' but then was terrible in 'The One' with a VERY bad attempt of an American accent and 'Mr Hard' image was complete toilet.The best thing about this film was the BMW and exaggerated fighting scenes.1st. The BMW. It blew up.  Excellent. That's what should have happened before the film was made and put a decent FAST car in this movie not a naff 5 series BMW.  Pants.2nd. If anyone fights like this guy in the UK armed services (He is ex special UK army) then we could take on the world.  Spinning a gun in the air and catching it behind him and shooting someone is amazing.  Re-diverting a missile with a tray is also amazing (can this actually be done? aren't missiles supposed to explode on contact?), and he never seems to be in pain when he is hit.  Well done to the UK armed services for turning out one of the toughest soldier in history.  He could knock out Bruce Lee with his hardness.People who like rubbish pointless movies are in for a treat as here is another one for you to treasure. Don't forget to buy it to prop up the also rubbish 'The One' movie in your DVD collection.  Should have been straight to video or even better straight to the bin.Jason Statham should stick to films like 'Snatch' as he was superior, even above Brad Pitt, in that movie.  I do hope he doesn't make anymore trash like this.  If there are plans for 'Transporter 2' then I am steering in the opposite direction.",Null,0,0,24 January 2003
The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers," Have you seen the first one yet?
","As I said from the first Lord of the Rings. History in the making. Same with this one. I won't spoil the plot of wizards, elves, hobbits etc. Just watch this movie. Great value for money with three hours of dark entertainment. I thought Pipin had a rubbish part in this movie but never mind. The Tree Shepards are very cute and the SFX are great. Best last 40 minutes action in any film I have seen. Go to your local cinema NOW..............  Bunk school, pull a sickie at work, just go and see it.",Null,0,0,10 January 2003
Gangs of New York," The point of this movie is???? (SPOILER)
","What a long film.  Could have done with alot more editing I think!  The movie was severly stretched and the acting performance from Leonardo was wooden! I don't see anything in this guy.  He is boring and acts the same in every movie he does.  He looks like a drip and acts like one.  Blanking this sore point from one's mind, the film has some excellent costumes (love those hats! NOT!), superb scenary, and the sets were stunning.  Must have taken a long time with the set designs, shame that some of them were blasted to bits or burnt down! (well they aren't real though are they....)  I did feel that the complete point of this movie was wasted on the Irish having a mass slapping with the natives (Amercians) and there was a bit of a love affair in the middle.  (Spoiler alert)  It all boils down to Leonardo wanting revenge on his father's death at the beginning of the film.  Didn't really see what it had to do with all the fighting and it felt that Leo had just a personal vendeta with Daniel Day Lewis and after he kills him isn't really bothered about what the Irish do! But wasn't that the point to these 'Gangs In New York?'  The fight scenes are savage but well put together. Innocent beatings/killings of the black people was a bit too graphic, but yes it was making a point of what it was like back then, but I couldn't feel a bit sorry for some of the black people in the audience.  Saying that the American's were racist against the Africans Irish and the Chinese in this movie which some people may take offence.  Watch it if you like Mr Scorceses style of movie but don't watch it if your expecting a fine storyline.",Null,0,0,24 January 2003
