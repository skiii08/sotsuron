First Man," Progress is not Linear
","Progress is not linear - this simple idea is represented in the movie First Man skillfully directed by Damien Chazelle. Everyone can find evidence of this thesis 'Progress is not linear' in his/her own life - losing weight, growing children, stock value changes on the market, learning, extending the rights and other examples. The plot of this movie refers to several outstanding historical events in the 20th century, which were brought great hope for discoveries in space and traveling throughout the Galaxies. Unfortunately, this hope didn't become a regular practice in the beginning of the 21st century. Also, among the 12 US citizens who landed on the Moon, no women were there. Meanwhile, three things make this movie outstanding and create its own chapter in cinematic history. First, the movie articulates the exceptional achievements of the American nation. Second, it emphases the drama of astronauts' wives who struggled with their grief, fears and worries of their husbands' professional risks. Third, 'First man' inspires a new generation around the world to keep learning Science, Technology, Engineering and Math (STEM) and believe in their own accomplishments. Technically, the movie doesn't have typical Sci-Fi or Marvel's Adventure visual effects or any elements making the characters courageous and heroic, although Hollywood stories are full of this when they shoot space stories. The film looks like a feature documentary with relatively simple camera shooting of main sets and scenes. In 'First Man' the idea of 'simplicity is genius' becomes apparent. Additionally, the musical score lifts the emotions more powerfully, than any visual effects. This movie is a personal success for those people who were involved in its creation.",10,2,6,17 October 2018
Rocketman," A Life-Long Music Therapy
","Elements of cognitive behavioral therapy are presented in this movie. The main character is described in elaborate detail. Visual, sound and costume departments added an outstanding contribution to the film. Several of the cast are nomination-worthy. Rocketman is a truly deep, emotional musical biopic.",9,9,19,31 May 2019
A Star Is Born," Screaming is/as Singing
","'Scream,' as an explosively loud voice, is a part of the modern music industry. Just try listen to Lorde, Adele, Gaga. TV Talent Shows also admire the artists whose primary vocal attribute is a powerful vocal range (Kelly Clarkson, David Cook, Tessanne Chin). 'Scream' was a typical feature of metal culture, but 'A Star is Born' shows us how new artists can gain fame by 'screaming' in pop music. The movie plugs in to this idea in several ways. One way is the brilliant casting choice of an artist and her lyrics with a strong voice and the ability to be vocally explosive. Another way is a dramatic line ending metaphorically with 'scream' as feedback on the tragic events (substance abuse & suicide). From a directorial point, the movie had some dramatic ellipses which are never resolved. Throughout the movie, the sound department perfectly complements the mood and drama of the story. Lady Gaga (Stefani Germanotta) in the role of Ally never transcends her own established persona. She never creates a sovereign, unique character. However, for Bradley Cooper his character portrayal is a real breakout in his career as an actor. He has transformed himself visually on the screen, as well as vocally and psychologically. Cooper expresses this transformation amazingly. It is a great achievement for him. His character, Jack, fantastically portrays the dilemma which comes with fame and the easy access to illegal substances. The way the picture is presented it is difficult to tell whether Jack downfall is the result of his wife's enormous success or of his inability to control his alcoholic and drug excesses. Probably, Cooper's character would rather express a typical infirmity which some talented artist struggled with (Janis Joplin, Amy Winehouse and others).",6,4,7,25 October 2018
Citizen Kane," Childhood Makes Everyone Equal
","Money makes some people crazy, cynical, hypocritical and it so hard to resist all the temptations which come with it. Kane couldn't resist these temptations and became a classic representation of a fake news media magnate. Flashbacks of Kane's life reveal the history of his journey to the wealthy life. As we search deeply into his childhood, we see how he was like everyman, and also, we find the events that shaped his adult life.",9,0,0,18 September 2018
Aquaman," In Varietate Concordia
","Nicole Kidman is incredible. Storyline is well-crafted. The movie is full of significant meanings and lessons. And yes, there are Russians, too, and Aquaman speaks in Russian. The movie promotes the idea: 'In varietate concordia.'",10,7,15,21 December 2018
BlacKkKlansman," Much too Politicized for Comedy
","Nice acting, good cast, curious plot. However, the current news narrative at the end of the movie negated all the advantages of the movie. Authors of BlacKkKlansman tried to connect the current racial polarization of the US society which happened last decade (2007-2017) with a true funny story that happened several decades ago. It looks so unnatural and perverted.",1,68,150,19 September 2018
Bohemian Rhapsody," A Queen Resurrection
","'Bohemian Rhapsody' is a potential masterpiece. Most people will agree that the leading actors, director, writers, cinematographer, light, makeup artists, costumes, sound, music, set designers, - all of them should get special recognition during the award season. Authors of the film present an aesthetically and visually brilliant music biopic. Nobody has ever done anything like this before. They made Freddie alive again. This movie is a Queen resurrection.Freddie's love, Mary Austin, represents his creative soul. Still, he was almost always seeking new experiences and adventures. His promiscuity, how he contacted the virus, was only a small part of his health history depicted in the film. It's great that authors mostly focus on Freddie's genius in fashion, singing, business, and other facets of the fine arts. The movie is energized by his charisma and his incredible artistic gifts. 'Bohemian Rhapsody' is shot without any nudity, violence or vulgarity, and this can be considered as an advantage among all music biopics.It's fantastic how a story about one person can radiate a panorama of public transformations, industry trends, shifts in fashion and more. As an historical figure, Freddie opened the door to the enormous problems of the HIV crisis of his time. The film director, Bryan Singer, dramatically chronicles Freddie's success, his unstoppable desire to create and his passionate love of music. Rami Malik shared and contributed his own artistic soul in the portrayal of Freddie's character. This is priceless.Friedrich Nietzsche's popular quote: 'what doesn't kill you makes you stronger' is wrong. In the bio of Freddie Mercury we see, some things can kill people, but memory and representation in cinema bring the person back to life sometimes with a stronger, more vital persona. This movie is breathtaking from the beginning to end and offers a terrific example how people with HIV and AIDS can lead prolific and productive lives.",10,4,5,4 November 2018
Jackie," A Long Burial Process
","Natalie Portman is a great actress, but this character does not represent her strongest performance. If the goal of the picture was to focus on conflicts between the US establishment and the Kennedy family, then it succeeds. However, the film does not express Jackie in her various roles as mother, sister, benefactor, stylist, designer, and editor. The movie 'Jackie' mainly explores the tragic moments of JFK's assassination. The movie shows only one side of her behavior in this stressful and shocking situation. The movie was edited in a non-sequential order. The makeup department seemed to do a disservice to Natalie Portman if their purpose was to achieve some semblance to Jackie. Casting was highlighted by the choice of Caspar Phillipson as JFK. The music frames the movie in one long burial process. Granted, much material of the assignation of JFK and the events surrounding the tragedy are sill sealed, but the filmmakers could have used more of the available details to show more aspects of Jackie's character. Example, mentioning Ann Lowe and other underrepresented a key figures related to the Kennedy family in the cinema.",3,3,4,18 October 2018
The Favourite," A Kaleidoscope of Bed Intrigues
","The Favourite contains a humorous kaleidoscope of bed intrigues. The movie dramatizes small, humorous stories about regal concerning who can be welcomed to the bed room of Queen Anne. The Bed is a central metaphor (passion, sickness, death, sleep and etc.) of this tragicomedy. Bravely told, in the bright shadow of satire, we see how the abuse of power and, at the same time, the power of love, affects political decisions. The historical framework of the film allows the viewers to enjoy the stiffness and hypocritical attitudes of Puritanism.",10,20,42,16 December 2018
Get Out," AMERICAN TRAUMA TURNED INTO THE HORROR
","American Society has undergone certain traumas, racial discrimination being one of them. US racial discrimination has a long history in society and along with its articulation in the law, politics, education and the arts. The movie 'Get Out' engages and represents the common racial innuendoes which can be experienced in US society even nowadays. The 'Get Out' looks like a science fiction-drama in the cerebral sorting of people. Several similar points, like a mass brainwashing and ethnic bias, make this movie closer to the public masses that were indoctrinated to hatred in, using similar methods (Holocaust movies, 1984, or The Human Centipede or closed society conspiracy movies.)In the movie 'Get Out' the closed society of medical professionals develops the racial theory, in which they exercise white supremacy over black people. African Americans are subject to medical experiments, sexual slavery, and domestic duties. The movie underlines the typical stereotype of African Americans (unable or incapable of mental or intellectual enterprises) and shows how racial microaggression can be multi-faceted. For example, when Dean Armitage, the Caucasian head of this closed club, meets with Chris, the African American boyfriend of Dean's daughter, he (father) denies his own racism by avowing that he supported Obama as the First African American President. It is a typical hook for people who try to refute the racist accusations by declaring that voting for Obama gives immunization from racial discrimination allegations.Another example of emphasizing the racial stereotypes in the movie is how the guests of 'the symposium' (in fact - auction) looked at Chris. They looked at him as an object, like goods for sale, not as a person. Guests paid attention only to Chris's physical appearance, not to his personality, his talents as a photographer and etc.In the ending of movie, the brain of African Americans are just simply removed and trashed in a bin. Metaphorically, the scene of throwing Georgina's scalp in the thrash can symbolizes Dean Armitage's racism theory. They are interested only in the bodies, not in the brain (soul). The racist neuroscientists pay attention to the physical body, not mental capabilities of the brain of African Americans. Moreover, the final scenes reveal that 'crazy brain scholars' believe the use of the body of an African American can increase their own lifespan.Thus, the movie allows viewers to extract a number of racial innuendoes. However, all of them can be qualified as verbal and non-verbal. Verbal elements of the movie constitute the bias of white characters against the black people which can be detected directly as racism of the main characters. Non-verbal scenes open the metaphorical level of the expression of racial attitudes of people who exercise their racial prejudice and bias. The movie does not give solutions, but it switches the American problems into the horror genre and focuses viewers to rethink the problem in the thriller framework.",7,0,1,22 April 2020
Midsommar," Once upon a time from Sweden
","This movie synthesizes <a href='/name/nm0000233/'>Quentin Tarantino</a> and <a href='/name/nm0001789/'>Andrei Tarkovsky</a>'s cinematic styles, incorporating, as well, certain flashback elements of Kubrick's <a href='/title/tt0120663/'>Eyes Wide Shut (1999)</a>. Despite some references to existing movie traditions and acknowledging well-known artists, Ari Aster succeeds in creating a new approach to scaring and terrifying the audience with excessive light and psychedelic visions.As with the last Tarantino movie <a href='/title/tt7131622/'>Once Upon a Time... in Hollywood (2019)</a>, the movie, 'Midsommar', refers to the subject of religious totalitarian cults. The attempt to tell a scary story with healthy sarcasm has <a href='/name/nm4170048/'>Ari Aster</a> emulating Tarantino's style, as well as in his use of bloody realistic scenes of murder. Visual elements are applause-worthy. However, in contrast to Tarantino's meaningless killing scenes, Aster justifies murder for spiritual purposes in the cult's creepy community. And using a bright light during the movie adds a metaphysical and divine aura to all the murders and situations (even scenes of intimacy are acted out in daylight, losing any sense of traditional privacy). Bright light is absent in only 2 scenes - death of parents and the assassination in the barn. The absence of light might possibly underscore these events as the result of unexpected actions. Meanwhile, this movie satirizes elements of spiritual manipulation in closed societies, some religious organizations and certain historical societies, using censorship, speech suppression, total submission, ban on disputing anyone in power, while at the same time relying on the triad of food, reproduction and domination.Following the Tarkosvky tradition, Aster's movie represents the recurring ebb and flow of pain and hope. The persistent anxiety and worries of the main character, brilliantly performed by <a href='/name/nm6073955/'>Florence Pugh</a>, make the story look pictorially like it is told by <a href='/name/nm0001789/'>Andrei Tarkovsky</a>, except that <a href='/name/nm4170048/'>Ari Aster</a> utilizes more light and color. Moreover, the dancing competition and the moving of people around the village (especially, camera motion), also bind this film with Tarkovsky's artistry, focusing on the existential experience of his characters through the specific angle of camera shooting. <a href='/name/nm4170048/'>Ari Aster</a>skillfully submerges the mind of the viewer in a spiritual quest to explore the deep meanings and exaltation of indigenous religions.Looking at the Midsommars' occult rituals, some of them can be mysterious or profane. However, the hints and allusions contextually explain future events from beginning to the end in the bulk of images: photos, paintings, runes, cloth ornaments and wall decorations. These images predict the developing plot and everything happening in that mysterious forest. The forest is a significant element in enhancing the mystification that surroundings the Bacchanalia in the movie. Aster shoots in the forest and represents 'forest' as an alternative metaphor to the Biblical paradise ('garden'). This work with forest as a location and the metaphoric use of forest as some unexplained and unexplored space (by the way, think about 'holly wood' in the scenes with ancestry trees) brings together Aster with Tarkovsky (<a href='/title/tt0072443/'>Zerkalo (1975)</a>, <a href='/title/tt0060107/'>Andrey Rublev (1966)</a>), <a href='/name/nm0327944/'>Alejandro G. IÃ±Ã¡rritu</a> (<a href='/title/tt1663202/'>The Revenant (2015)</a>), <a href='/title/tt0081505/'>The Shining (1980)</a> (<a href='/name/nm0000040/'>Stanley Kubrick</a>). Nevertheless, a significant portion of the storytelling style in 'Midsommar' looks a lot like Kubrick's <a href='/title/tt0120663/'>Eyes Wide Shut (1999)</a> focusing on the couple's break up. If Kubrick used dark scenes with original set illumination (reexamine the small lamps and light position in certain scenes), then Aster utilized fully lit sets and colorful pattern. In Aster's filming, light plays a tool of blinding the conciseness of his characters.Thus, 'Midsommar' reconstructs the fears and worries of indigenous traditions and can prevent others from spiritual dangers. <a href='/name/nm4170048/'>Ari Aster</a> is continuing in the tradition of great cinema directors and establishing his own star on the roof of cinematic heaven. After the 'Midsommar' his star will never stop shining. And <a href='/name/nm6073955/'>Florence Pugh</a>, with her outstanding contribution in the portrayal of spiritual existence, will be a part of Aster's asterism for the years.",10,3,14,6 September 2019
La La Land," Sing Your Emotions
","Seemingly frivolous details can destroy one's most cherished dreams. Feelings of excitement and disappointment are reflected in the music and lyrics. In 'La la land' the lyrics are enjoyable and life-affirming. The film teaches people to sing their emotions. For the average person to express her/his feelings of love is quite difficult. But, for example, if someone tried to form into a song his/her feelings of anger, hate, sadness, that might possibly help in saving the beloved and prevent tragic consequences. And finally, song is a beautiful way to share emotions among people.",10,2,3,19 September 2018
Joker," Disease as Superficial Power
","This movie dramatizes the sad story of Arthur's mental anguish in which he asks people to call him Joker. He was the victim of abuse in his family, in his employment, and his intimate relationships. He was aware of personal health issues, but he was persistently trying to use his mental problems to his advantage. He was desperately trying to be funny in all kinds and circumstances which resulted in a terrible major realization in a subway accident. Joker was bound by his dreams (or delusions - depending on the viewer's perspective) and his vision of justice. The movie allows the audience to feel the hurt of Joker and horrible consequences of his actions. All artistic tools and contributions involved in this movie make this story full of anxiety and depression. This movie is a perfect companion for autumn melancholy and bad Halloween memories.",10,1,1,8 October 2019
Marriage Story," Making Money on Unhappiness
","The Marriage Story does not attempt to teach, does not explore new issues, especially for people who have experienced divorce and the division of financial assets and child custody. The movie scratches the souls of viewers by dramatizing the tenacious claws of the legal professionals that make money on human disappointment and conflicts.The Marriage Story starts from at the breaking point of a marital relationship. Love has expired, but careers have advanced. For the main characters to get through this chaotic stressful process, therapist and legal advisors are called upon to ameliorate the situation. The beginning of the movie starts with the introduction of each character through the use of the opposing spouse's description. It creates a bridge of understanding for viewers, regarding the marital relationship. However, the break up, without legal action is unavoidable. That's why a significant part of the movie concerns legal intervention at the final point of the marriage.The movie dialogue, especially that of Laura Dern's character, is particularly brilliant. Her monologue that most people deprived from fatherhood (God is father, father is on the heaven, accordingly children do not need to see their fathers - is a pretty persuasive rhetorical hook) sounds so argumentative, despite certain critics of the Christianity could be found (negligence in faith-based issues, presumption of inequality and etc.). Much of the lead characters exposition is reeled through the legal proceedings. Certain scenes look like the remake of Revolutionary Road (2008) with Leonardo DiCaprio and Kate Winslet). The sad part of the movie that it never shows situations where a win-win deal is possible.",7,4,5,9 February 2020
Green Book," Changing Hearts
","'Green book' reveals an amazing example of human transformation via the power of love and the power of art. In this story we see how art changes the heart. This movie brilliantly represents how personal responsibility affects business and family relationships. Writing, filming and acting are inspirational masterpieces.",10,3,6,8 December 2018
Annihilation," Curious Topology
","The PoincarÃ© conjecture proof - the great contribution of a Russian-born mathematician Grigori Perelman to topology, a mathematical discipline, lights up a bit the mystery of this World where people live. Perelman's proof explains the features of the Universe wherein we live and narrows the way for searching the final answer: we live in an unlimited 3D space or on the surface of a 3D sphere, circumscribed by 4D square (hypercube). The movie 'Annihilation' presents the idea of people living in different realities and between several dimensions. In the movie all objects, humans, and space are under cryptic transformation. As a form of art, this movies produces new horizons for thinking and extending the visualization of human imagination up to a higher level. This movie is perfect for those who are interested in topology with its numerous surgery, twisting, crumpling and other methods.",8,1,2,30 October 2018
