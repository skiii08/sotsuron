Changeling," Manipulative and implausible, I walked out
","Tense and dramatic, but its on the same level as a cheap horror story where a woman alone in a thunder storm goes into the basement to find out what that strange sound is... I cant even begin to count the number of times this grossly heavy handed script is blatantly manipulative of what is plausible in life... so it is really just a horror story, but instead of blood and guts, its a woman's emotions, slowly being torn apart.Poor show Clint! I prefer it when you make movies I can take seriously, or other movies which don't take themselves so seriously. Unfortunately this move takes itself very seriously but cannot BE taken seriously, so it ends up a rather bad joke. I walked out after about 90 mins.",3,11,25,26 January 2009
