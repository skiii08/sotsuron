Vertigo," Bizzare
","Thats the first word that comes to mind after seeing this film.  It is a ghost story, a character study, and a thriller all in one.  This is one of Hitchcock's films that requires more than one viewing.  You miss so much the first time, that you need to see it a second.  This is one of Hitchcock's best, and his best colour film. Bernard Hermann has received a lot of justified praise for his score.  It is mesmerizing and beautiful.  It stands alone, yet works stunningly in the film.  The cinematography is also great. The zoom-in, dolly out shots are particularily well done. This was James Stewart's most unusual role, yet he gives an admirable performance.",10,4,4,2 August 1999
Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," ??
","Let me preface this by saying a)- I did not like Star Wars & b) I haven't seen the other two.Having said that, I didn't have that high of expectations for this movie. It didn't reach those expectations. Jar Jar is annoying ( I don't care if he's supposed to be).  The acting is abysmal (not the actor's faults.  They were given horrible dialogue)I expect this film to recieve Oscar nominations for best Visual Effects, Sound, Sound effects, film editing, and maybe costumes.Final warning:  This is not a thinking person's movie!! ( no offense, but it's supposed to be mindless entertainment but doesn't even rise to that)",Null,1,2,15 June 1999
Ghost," Okay
","Whoopi Goldburg's oscar winning performance gives this film what life it has.  Otherwise, it's just a routine romance with a spot of comedy.It did not deserve a Best Picture nomination over Reversal of Fortune, The Grifters, The Rapture, Postcards from the Edge, Journey of Hope, etc.  It didn't make my top ten of the year.See it once, for Goldburg's performance.  You won't really want to see it again.",Null,0,2,19 August 1999
E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial," Moving
","It's interesting to note that several people have called this film manipulative, and even calculated.  I have to disagree, because the movie itself is so natural and the places it goes seem like the only places to go.  Henry Thomas is a wonderful Elliot, charming and winsome.  The entire is cast is great, but it is ET who carries the movies.  The film where he/she (?) is drunk is funny.  This movie is one of the  great science fiction films, and is a classic.",Null,0,0,23 August 1999
Casablanca," The classic
","This movie defines classic cinema.  It has romance, intrigue, comedy, everything.  It has become so entrenched in today's society, that it's surprising to think that this film was just considered another film when first released.  Humphrey Bogart truly gives his best performance ever.  Ingird Bergman is stunning and gorgeous, and Paul Henried is very suave and sophisticated (I wonder if he worked with Hitchcock.)  Claude Rains is at his best.  He was probably the greatest character actor ever.  While not technically brilliant, is it rock solid (with the exception of the train scene.  The rain is everywhere, and when they-Rick and Sam, walk on the train, everything is all of the sudden dry.)  It's interesting the sides taken for or against this film.  If I like it, than I am accused of jumping on the 'Classic bandwagon'.  If I don't like it, than I'm the backlash.  Oh well.  I love everything about this film, this film which defines classic and is everything a movie should be.",10,0,0,30 September 1999

Citizen Kane," A masterpiece, but simply not the best
","I think this film deserves to be called a masterpiece, however, I do not think it is the greatest film ever made.  It does rank in my top ten of all time, but not number 1.  What really detracts from this movie is Orson Welles, the actor.  Look on any list of a hundred best performances and his name is never on it.  For a reason.  His directing is magnificent, as is his writing, but his acting does not deserves accolades.  Joseph Cotten, however, is nothing short of remarkable.",10,0,3,24 May 1999
Shakespeare in Love," Contrived
","This is a clever movie, no doubting that.  However, it is not the best film of the year (1998).  It makes number 10 of my top ten list of 1998. Here's why.1)Gwyneth Paltrow.  She is completely unconvincing when she is the guy. How did she get all that hair into that small wig? ( I know I am nit-picking.)2)John Madden's direction.  He simply did not deserve the nomination over directors like Sam Raimi, Todd Solondz, and Bill Condon.3)The predictability.  We know how this movie is going to end, because we know how Romeo and Juliet ends.  It puts such a strain on such a long (not too long) movie.I am not saying that there is no  merit in this movie.  It had a very witty script ( which still didn't deserve the Oscar over Life is Beautiful and The Truman Show)  A great score, and magnificent performances by the rest of the cast.7/10.  Final word:  See it once, though you won't be missing much if you don't.",6,6,11,17 June 1999
12 Angry Men," Great, A Classic every sense of the word
","12 Angry Men is about a jury arguing over the innocence/guilt of a young man who did/didn't murder his father.    Sidney Lumet's directorial debut is nothing short of remarkable.  One of the best debut films, second only Citizen Kane.  He uses the claustrophobic one-set and uses no special effects (unless you count the rain in one scene) to great effect.  This as an ensemble cast to die for, including future oscar winners as Martin Balsam, Ed Begley and Henry Fonda.    Simply a stunning achievement.  How the AFI didn't put it on the top hundred, I'll never understand",10,0,1,3 August 1999
12 Angry Men," Brilliant and intense
","This film is shot entirely in a small room ( with the exception of approx. 3 mins, in the beginning and end) and is the perfect example of characterization. One of the three best films of 1957 ( the other two being Paths of Glory and Bridge on the River Kwai) this is a brilliant movie.  One of the few films where one set is an asset, this shows both sides of a coin when juries deliberate. The acting, especially by Henry Fonda, is stunning.  IF there was an Oscar for best ensemble cast, this movie would have won it. Why it wasn't on the AFi 100 is beyond me ( and I agree with most of the choices). In the end, what makes this film so great is its humanity, and it shows us that we all need humanity.",10,0,1,23 May 1999
The English Patient," Powerful
","I had my doubts before I saw this movie.  Having read the book, the title 'unfilmable' came to my mind.  It's plot was too labyrinth for a two hour film, even much longer, stuff would have been left out.  Having just seen the film, I can say it is a stunning achievement all around.  The acting, especially by the three leads, is magnificent.  The cinematography and score are incredible.  I can now see why this won nine oscars, though why it lost the screenplay awards is still surprising (I haven't seen Slingblade, the winner).  The romance between Binoche and Andrews is not dwelled upon as in the book, however that is a small price to pay for such a film.

Elizabeth," Cate Blanchett
","I thought Blanchett's performance out did the film.  The actors were all truly amazing, but it is Cate Blanchett is the one who takes your breath away.With that said, I am glad it did not get nominated for best director and best original screenplay, simply because they weren't exceptionally strong.  This film makes my top ten of 98, but not my top five, and I probably wouldn't have nominated it for best picture.Blanchett should have won best actress, and it's a shame she didn't.",Null,0,0,23 May 1999
Elizabeth," Why I don't like Shakespeare in Love
","When I saw this movie, I realized why I didn't like Shakespeare in Love as much as most people do.  First of all, the entire cast here is much more brilliant than anything in Shakespeare in Love.  Yes, Fiennes and Rush were in both movies, but in Elizabeth, they come to life (though Fiennes' role is one dimensional).  And when comparing Cate Blanchett's stunning transformation from the lusty princess to the Virgin queen to Gwenyth Paltrow's romantic theatre lover, there really is no comparison.  Cate Blanchett's role was much more difficult to pull off, and her performance was much more daring. Christopher Eccleston gave what I believe to be a brilliant, yet surprisingly underrated performance.  Many of my friends who don't like costume dramas/historical epics liked this film because it's not structured like a typical costume drama, but as a thriller.  One watches as the conspiracy unfolds, in wicked appreciation of Shekar Kapur's direction as the story unfolds (he deserved a nomination over John Madden).  Michael Hirst's screenplay does play around with history, but I don't understand why that bothers people.  Mind you, I'm not an expert on Elizabeth, so I don't know what exactly Hirst removed/added/changed, but the final product is so juicy and thrilling, that I don't think I would mind much.  After seeing this, Shakespeare in Love seemed predictable, mundane, and well... rather boring.  My number three if 1998 (behind Saving Private Ryan and A Simple Plan)",Null,0,1,2 June 2000
L.A. Confidential," Truly Brilliant (spoilers inside)
","I haven't seen Chinatown, so I can't compare the two, but LA Confidential is a twisty crime drama, filled with amazing performances and a great plot.  The acting is great.  The male leads are filled with relish and are convincing.  Kim Basinger is great, though I would not have given her the oscar over Julianne Moore.  The script is amazing.  Interesting trivia: In 1995, James Cromwell and Kevin Spacey were competing against each other for best supporting actor.  In this movie, Cromwell gets to shoot Spacey.  Talk about revenge.  Number 4 on my top ten of 1997, after The Sweet Hereafter, Gattaca, and Contact.",8,0,0,6 September 1999
X-Men," Not half bad
","This was an entertaining film, but one that could have been better.  While it didn't seem short, if they added some character development for some of the characters who just take up screen time.  And either develop the perfunctory love triangle, or get rid of it.  The story itself is rather simple as well.  People hate mutants, and want to pass a bill forcing them to register themselves.  The mutants are divided into two camps.  The first group believe in peaceful coexistence, while the second believe that people must be destroyed.  The performances range, but that is as a result of their parts.  Berry, Marsden, Jansen, and Romain-Stamos are limited by their roles, but still give a solid go of it.  Anna Paquin as Rogue, while doesn't disappoint, isn't incredible.  Rogue is not a teenager, so her character isn't completely 'true'.  It also limits the flirtatious relationship between her and Wolverine, played by Hugh Jackman.  The film belongs to him.  He's great to watch.  Fun, while not incredible (though it should have been nominated for an oscar in the Sound and make-up categories).",Null,0,0,2 July 2001
Dr. Strangelove or: How I Learned to Stop Worrying and Love the Bomb," Madly hilarious
","Easily the funniest movie I have seen, on par with Some Like it Hot.  It takes a situation that would be perfect for a drama, nuclear disaster, then Kubrick turns it into a satire.  He decided that what he wanted to tell the audience was crazier than the book it was depicted on, so he made the movie a comedy.  What performances?  Peter Sellers was amazing in his triple role, as the British military officer, the president of the USA, and as a wierd Scientist, Dr. Strangelove.  The scene where he is talking to the Russian premier (?) is devastatingly funny.  A true classic, and Kubrick's best (along with 2001: A Space Odyssey)",10,1,1,12 August 1999
The Grapes of Wrath," A powerful and moving film
","Grapes of Wrath has everything that a movie should have:breathtaking cinematography, great acting, writing and directing.The cinematography, by Gregg Toland, is absolutely incredible.  There is not a false note in the script.  Tom Joad's final speech is done, not with flamboyance but determination, and Henry Fonda doesn't overact at all. Henry Fonda gives the performance of a lifetime.  He was robbed at the oscars, as was the film.One of the greatest films of all time, and John Ford's best directing job.",Null,3,6,30 September 1999
Forrest Gump," It was okay
","A movie where I can see why people liked it, but I simply wasn't one of them.  First of all, Tom Hanks performance deserves praise.  His performance was dead on and wonderful.  The supporting actors deserve praise as well ( especially Gary Sinise).  The film editing was great as well.The movie itself did not move me like the Shawshank Redemption did ( both released in 1994).  The writing in Shawshank was much better ( one award of the six Gump won).The story of a simpleton floating through life doesn't appeal to me. There seemed to be no forward drive, and Robert Zemeckis seemed to want to create a surreal world ( where people are hurt, but not too badly) and ground it solidly in realism, which just doesn't work.I thought it deserved Best Actor, Supporting Actor, and Film Editing. The other three should have gone to other films",Null,2,4,25 May 1999
American Beauty," An absolutely incredible experience
","American Beauty was recently re-released in my town after having a shamefully short run.  I had seen it the first time, without hearing any of the hype, and thought it was a stunning achievement.  After seeing it again, I still think it's a stunning achievement.  Is it the best film of 1999? Yes, there is no doubt in my mind.  Magnolia is the only one that comes close (in my mind) to it's power.    A lot of people have been comparing to Happiness and The Ice Storm.  I liked Happiness, but not The Ice Storm.  However, American Beauty tries to be neither.  Though it is similar to The Ice Storm, the characters in American Beauty were human, unlike the ice figurines found in The Ice Storm. Happiness was far more ambitious than American Beauty, but focused on the mordant characters.  This film tries to find real beauty, and that is it's strength.  The performances from the actors are truly magnificent.  Kevin Spacey deserved his Oscar, and gave edge to some brilliant lines.  The power he gave to this line 'You don't get to tell me what to do.  Ever.  Again' could have taken oil off a potato chip.  This is his finest role (and performance) to date.  Annette Benning is also great, but the supporting actors deserved more mention than they received.  Wes Bentley gave a powerful performance as Ricky Fitts, and I would have loved to see him get an Oscar nomination. Thora Birch and Mena Suvari were also excellent.  They each had scenes that they handled incredibly well (Suvari's final scene with Spacey, Birch's fight with her father).  Alan Balls' screenplay was written exceptionally well.  The emotion and power he gives his characters brings them to life on the screen.  Conrad L. Hall's photography was majestic and awe inspiring.  Thomas Newman's score was perfect, as was the editing.    I can't believe this is Sam Mendes first film.  He directs with skill and talent (though you can tell he was a theater director) and brings together the performances, script, and technical details to make one the finest film of 1999, weaving tragedy, satire, and irony to make a truly touching movie. 
  To compare this film to the Oscar pageantry of The Cider House Rules would be ridiculous. A lot of people will say that American Beauty was overhyped, and maybe it was.  But consider this: American Beauty is not an Oscar film (Spacey pleasuring himself in the shower, vs cute little orphans), but it has the audacity, originality, and brilliance to shine a light at American suburbia in late 90's.",10,0,0,1 April 2000
Dark City," Visually stunning
","I didn't know what to expect when I first saw this film.  I had even heard of Rufus Seawell, and can't claim have seen the Crow.  Yet, it sounded intriguing enough to rent.  IT is one of the most bizarre films I have ever seen.  The combination of film noir and sci-fi is well done.  Visually stylish, with incredible visuals, make this a must see.  The performances were fine, without any one standing out.  The music was slightly overbearing. While I don't think it was the best movie of 1998, it is definitely one to see.",Null,0,1,19 September 1999
The Usual Suspects," A Stylish Crime Drama
","This film has everything a crime film should have: a great cast, an incredible story with lots of twists and turns.  I have heard all sorts of things about the final twist, but, if one thinks about it, it does not make sense according to some parts of the story. However, it does to make sense in most of the story, so it is no bother.  The acting is uniformly great, with Kevin Spacey given a standout performance that deserved the oscar it won.  The script, however, is not so lucky.  Originally, it was too long, and didn't leave the reader with much to figure out.  Editing did a good job of getting rid of the useless scenes. The script on film was good, but not as joyously original as Toy Story or Carrington.  Comparisons abound between this film and LA Confidential.  While they both feature Kevin Spacey, and both have incredible gun-battle climaxes.  But these are two completely different films, and both deserve to be seen",8,0,1,25 November 1999
Independence Day," Annoying, and so much more (spoilers inside)
","I am glad I didn't see this movie in the theatre.  Not a being a huge Will Smith fan, I wasn't looking forward to seeing it.  This is a candidate for the worst movie of the decade.   The plot: nonexistent.  The world is attacked by aliens (again), with their superb technology, and brilliant strategies, they should win, right? Wrong.  We, the dumb humans of the earth (sorry), who are centuries behind them, find a way to beat them.  Roger Corman films look remarkable in comparison.  The acting is incredibly awful, but when you're given nothing to work with but one-liners...  Oh, and this movie is propaganda in the area of Triumph of the Will (just kidding, but the nationalist speech Bill Pullman gives near the end was the final straw)  I will never see this film again.",1,36,74,14 August 1999
Saving Private Ryan," Harrowing and very powerful
","As the opening sequence begins, you cannot help but have a feeling of dread as the date appears on the screen, 'June 6, 1944'   The opening sequence has got to be one of the best put on film.  The jarring camera movements, the bullets shooting through the water, the absolute chaos of D-day is masterfully captured.  Some people called it uselessly gory, comparing it to 'Glory' with its battle scenes.  Glory was a great movie, but comparing the Civil War to D-Day isn't the brightest thing to do.  Once we realize the mission, we hear the men complaining, 'Why is one life worth risking eight of ours'.  I wondered that as well, but you soon understand that it isn't the point.   The backlash says that the characters are paper thin, and that the story is s--t.  I disagree with both points.  All these characters have depth (with the possible exception of Private Ryan).  The story, while I agree that the screenplay is not oscar-worthy, is actually not told as a plot story, but as a series of events that take place (D-day, the battle at the hill with the machine gunners, the final battle).  The acting does range, and is not always great.  Hanks does give a good performance, in a role that is not his type (aka. not Forrest Gump).  Edward Burns does give a good performance, but the two best belong to Tom Sizemore and Jeremy Davies.  Davies' meltdown sequence on the staircase left me reeling.  I saw it in theatres over a year ago, and on video yesterday, and was stunned about how much detail I remember.  In my opinion, this film is the best of the year (beating A Simple Plan and Elizabeth).",10,0,1,28 November 1999
Lawrence of Arabia," AFI list
","To clarify on a comment made earlier, The AFI list wasn't for just American films.  It was for English Language films.   Otherwise a number of films wouldn't be on it ( The three David Lean films, the Stanley Kubrick films etc).I loved Lawrence of Arabia.  I have to mention that I saw this on TV, not the big screen, so I can't really comment on the cinematography.  I thought the writing was great, even if it was historically inaccurate ( I don't know if it is).  Peter O'Toole is great.",9,0,2,25 May 1999
JFK," Provocative and Brilliant
","This is an amazing movie.  It keeps your complete attention for three hours.    Comparisons to Triumph of the Will and I am Cuba are unfounded, I believe. The film never says 'this is what happened to JFK', but it is one man's belief of what happened on the day JFK died.  Triumph was made for propaganda purposes solely and absolutely.  The performances in this film are unanimously magnificent.  Kevin Costner is great, if unremarkable in his role.  My favourite performance belongs to Gary Oldman, for his stunning turn as Lee Harvey Oswald.  There are no easy answers in this film.  Whether you believe inn Oliver Stone is up to you, but this film stands alone as a powerful movie, and I placed it #2 for 1991.    The score, direction, writing, and editing work seamlessly together to make a fascinating film.",Null,0,10,4 August 1999
Good Will Hunting," My second comment, but
","I had originally reviewed this movie a year after I saw it, and in my review, I gave it restrained praise.  'Does it have it's flaws. Yes. It does go on a bit too long, and Minnie Driver's character borders on caricature'. After rewatching, I have to take those two comments back.  It didn't seem too long during the second viewing, and Minnie Driver's character had real depth, something I had missed on my original viewing.   However, one thing that I have to comment on is the script.  It felt much better the second time around.  Damon and Affleck have a natural ability to create dialogue that flows, almost like lyrics to a song.  None of it seems forced, and it becomes quite moving in several scenes.  The scenes between Williams and Damon are so well written, and are acted very precisely, they become quite powerful.  The music also works quite well, something else that I overlooked in my first viewing.  I'm glad I watched it again, and it's status had certainly risen in my mind.",Null,6,14,17 March 2001
Good Will Hunting," Good film, but no classic
","I have to admit that I enjoyed this film when it came out, much more than the heralded Titanic.  Its formulaic elements (the story is a meeting between Ordinary People and Little Man Tate) were appealing.  Does it have it's flaws.  Yes.  It does go on a bit too long, and Minnie Driver's character borders on caricature.  But the rest of the film is amazing.  Matt Damon sparks life into his already great role.  In a year where young actors did their best to impress, Matt Damon rode out on top (along with Edward Norton).  His performance is full of charm.  Robin Williams won a long-deserved oscar for a great performance, though it doesn't top his best (Mrs. Doubtfire).  The directing by Gus Van Sant is good, but doesn't top his best either (Drugstore Cowboy).  All in all, a very good film, one that I will see again, but it isn't a classic.",Null,2,6,4 December 1999
The Piano," Haunting
","This haunting film, directed by Jane Campion, is a showcase for several things.  First of all, the performances by the four leads are magnificent.  This is Holly Hunter's show.  Her performance remains one of the best of the decade. Her facial impressions, and voice-overs really give this film it's punch. Harvey Keitel and Anna Paquin are also great.  Sam Neil surprises me the most.  His character is not really a villain (not until he chops her finger off).    The script it amazing, and the cinematography astounding.  The drained greys of the beach scenes are especially well done.  The only fault is overlength, but that is a small fault for this movie.",8,0,2,15 August 1999
2001: A Space Odyssey," Fascinating
","Before I begin, this film isn't for everybody.  It is filmed at a deliberate pace ( slow for some people), there is no dialogue for twenty-five minutes, and it isn't loud.   If you want a loud film, watch Independence Day.  The opening sequence, in the savannah, in the past, is done with restraint and beauty.  The transition of the bone throwing in the air with the spinning of the space machine is incredible.  The ending is one of the most open ended in cinematic history.  It doesn't answer all the questions for you, and that will also disappoint lazy audiences.  But the film is a marvelous journey, that still amazes me.  This film is the working definition of eloquence, and I think everybody should see it.  Arthur C. Clarke said, ' If someone completely understood this film, than we have failed' (or something to that effect).  There are so many interpretations, that it would be interesting to know what Kubrick thought when making it.",Null,1,2,12 August 1999
Singin' in the Rain," Better than Kiss me Kate
","This is easily the finest musical Hollywood has ever made.  I don't understand all this about Kiss Me Kate. Singin' in the Rain is not dated at all.  It is an amazing mixture of dance, SOng, and story.  Donald O'Connor's 'Make em' Laugh' along with Kelly's title number rank as among the best songs ever caught on film.Deserving of the #10 spot on the AFI list.",10,2,5,18 June 1999
Chariots of Fire," Beautiful
","I am surprised at all the negative comments this film has received.  Many people have been saying that without the music, it would have been nothing. Complete nonsense.  Yes, it was a small film.  So!  Since when do films have to be three-hour epics (Reds)?  This film is not about competition, but about repression with exhilaration (Thank-you Leonard Maltin).  The characters are three-dimensional, the script is truly wonderful.  The score is obviously one of the best of all time.  The timelessness of it, the memories of the runners as the main title skims across your mind.  Vangelis started a synthesizer revolution with this film, and we can't forget it.  In the end, while I don't think this is necessarily the best film of all time, it is certainly the best of 1981.",Null,0,2,9 December 1999
The Hurricane," It needed to be three hours long
","Before I go into detail of the one fault this film has, let me say that this movie is a powerful experience, one the everyone should undertake.  The acting by the entire cast is incredible.  Denzel Washington gives his second best performance (after his stirring turn in Malcolm X).  He commands the screen throughout the film.  Rod Steiger also has a memorable cameo at the end as the judge.  The film's flaw is it's length.  Because the studio wouldn't release a film over two and a half hours, the first hour tries to pack in so much information that it lacks cohesion.  However, once the second hour starts, its a roller coaster ride of emotions until the very powerful finish.",8,0,2,27 February 2000
A Clockwork Orange," Brilliant and disturbing; suprisingly relevant
","A Clockwork Orange has got to be one of the most disturbing films ever produced.  The story is simple enough, but it's presentation is clever.  We are manipulated to understand Alex's (Malcom McDowall, in the year's best performance) point of view (and indeed Kubrick's).  It is stylized to a very high degree, with the William Tell overture to the sex scene a very nice touch.   The violence is harsh, but it is also stylized, like a choreographed dance.  The 'Singin in the Rain' rape scene was one of the most memorable images in film history.  The juxtaposition of joy and brutality remains absolutely unforgettable.  I don't think this is Kubrick's best, and it ranks fourth for me, but it is an amazing movie of surprising depth.",Null,0,0,15 August 1999
The Red Violin," Exquisite
","That's the word to describe this film.    Incredibly ambitious, this movie follows a violin through the centuries, up to modern day Montreal, where its going to be sold at an auction.  This movie could easily have fallen apart.  IT might have been too ambitious, or badly structured.  Instead, we're given an elegant film, that moves backward and forward through time seamlessly.  At the auction, there are five people who want the violin, and each have their reasons.  Set in Montreal, Oxford, Vienna, Shanghai, and Italy, this story is universal in it's appeal.  At the core of this film, other than the violin, is it's performances. Jason Flemyng and Greta Scacchi make a very sensual pair.  Yet my favourite performance comes from Christoph Koncz, as Kaspar Weiss.  The music solos, by Joshua Bell, are nothing less than remarkable, and this film ranks as one of the best of the year.",Null,0,0,18 August 1999
Eyes Wide Shut," Utterly absorbing and fascinating
","A depiction of sexual obsession that will not be for the casual movie go-er, who enjoys such Hollywood movies as Godzilla or Armageddon.  This reminds me in many ways to A Clockwork Orange and Lolita.  It is slow moving, and yet one is never bored.  Nicole Kidman gives a tremendous performance that could capture her an oscar nomination.  Her monologues are heartbreaking.  Tom Cruise is also effective, though out-performed by Kidman, Sydney Pollak, and Marie Richardson.  Symbolism is used throughout this films, as the colours show the mood. The cinematography and score (though rather eclectic) are both magnificent. A must for film buffs.   That all said, it is not for everybody.  But can you name one Kubrick film that is?",Null,0,0,28 July 1999
Some Like It Hot," Great
","I was surprised to read comments that didn't like this movie.   I personally loved it.  The acting, which several have disliked, is great. Tony Curtis and Jack Lemmon are each dead on in their roles, and Lemmon should have won the Oscar.  Marilyn Monroe gives a comically sexy performance.  Billy Wilder has shown his versatility, making a mark in film noir, serious drama, satire, comedy (of every sort), romance, and war.  This movie is one of his best.  The script is absolutely hilarious, with some of the best lines on film.   This film has one of the greatest final lines in film, rivaled only by Casablanca and Sunset Blvd.",Null,1,2,24 September 1999
Titanic," Average
","I admit I enjoyed this film.  The grandeur of it all was impressive.  The fact that James Cameron let this film get to a 200 million dollar budget is also very impressive.  However, once the grandeur is taken away there really isn't much left.  The plot is a simple romance.  And since the story is so predictable, it puts some heavy pressure on a three hour film.  The direction is superb.  My distaste for this film doesn't extend to James Cameron's technical direction.  His technical direction is on par with Spielberg's.  However, his human/emotional part of that mix doesn't rate very well.  The acting also is not consistent.  I didn't find DiCaprio's performance bad, but his character seemed to be very easy to play and wasn't that complicated.  Winslet, who's performance in Heavenly Creatures stunned me, is mainly okay here.  The best performances belonged to Gloria Stuart and Kathy Bates.  The score also rates with the best, and the soundtrack is one I highly recommend.  In the end, I think this film is more comparable to 'Cleopatra' than to 'Gone With Wind'.  The budget and the problems making the film end up being more interesting and more entertaining than the film itself.  Did this film deserve best picture? No.  But it's nomination was also like 'Cleopatra's' nomination.  The big budget and the absolute vastness of the film was enough.",Null,4,5,29 November 1999
Titanic," Over-rated
","Titanic is not the greatest movie of all time ( except box office).  It is not the greatest movie of 1997.  The flaws are many: 1) We know the end to Titanic.  That makes the last hour and a half amazingly boring. 2) James Cameron trivialized it by using two fictional characters. 3) Not many of the performances were that great ( I liked Paxton, Bates, and Stewart) 4) Overlong",Null,2,3,5 April 1999
All Quiet on the Western Front," Harrowing
",One of the best anti war films I have ever seen.  It is still brutal the severed hand clutching the barbed wire still shocks) with world class directing and cinematography.  And who could forget that ending?,9,1,4,14 April 1999
To Kill a Mockingbird," Powerful
","A classic.  This film was a delight from start to finish.  There were several things worth a mention from this film.1. Gregory Peck:  He slips into the role of Atticus Finch with ease.  It was made for him, and he slips into it like a fine suit.2. Mary Badham: A great performance from a child actress.  She is Scout, and no one else could play her.3. The score: Ranked by Movietunes as one of the fifty most definitive scores, it works with this film.4. The direction:  Very subtle and understated, Robert Mulligan did himself proud.  I could go on and on about the strengths of this movie, but won't.  If it has one weakness, it is that it seems to go on a bit too long.  But that doesn't make it any less moving.",9,0,1,5 August 1999
The Green Mile," A beautiful, poetic film (spoilers)
","The final scene will have you in tears, if you aren't in tears already.  Tom Hanks plays a death-row prison guard, along with Barry Pepper, David Morse, and newcomer Doug Hutchison.  They are all stunned by the entrance of Michael Clark Duncan, a massive prisoner with a child-like mentality.  He begins to do things, unexpected, that change the way these people look on life.  The performances are equally brilliant, with the supporting characters supporting Hanks with ease.  Hutchison plays a character so mean and reptilian, that if I saw him on the street, I'd have the biggest urge to knock some sense into him.  Barry Pepper plays another young prison guard, who is in awe of the things he sees.  Pepper is subtle in his scenes, projecting hints of sadness.  Duncan, however, steals the show.  Whenever he speaks, or moves, your eyes and ears are on him.    Frank Darabont has scripted a moving film, that should get the best picture nomination.  If there is one flaw, it is in the casting of James Cromwell.  Though he looks perfect for the part, his accent peeks through at times.  But that flaw is minor compared to the rest of the film.",6,1,2,22 December 1999
The Lion King," One of the greatest animated movies of all time
","When I first saw this film in the theatre, I expected another kids movie. Boy was I wrong.  The story is relatively old,(ironically, this is Disney's first original animated film)  The opening sequence is no less than stunning.  The song (Circle of Life) starts playing in the background.  The grass moves, and all these animals are going to see Mufasa's son (the next Lion King).  It is beautiful in all it's glory  The songs range from incredible ('Circle of Life', 'Can You Feel the Love tonight') to the horrible ('I just can't wait to be king').  The score is thrilling, and the animation is truly remarkable.  I feel that this is the second best animated film of all time (after Fantasia).  Beauty and the Beast runs a close third.",Null,0,0,6 December 1999
The Shawshank Redemption," Powerful and compassionate
","I don't think this film is the number one of all time.  But than, it might be.  I placed Casblanca and The Godfather higher because they haven't dated. Let's see how well the Shawshank Redemption does in twenty years.  That said, this movie is a staggering experience.  While I didn't experience it in theatres, I was impressed by the cinematography.  The performances are uniformly flawless.  I can't believe that Hawthorne beat out Robbins to a nomination.  The direction and story also make this magnificent.  But what makes it moving, is it's theme.  In the end, it's about hope.  Not an 'action' quality, but an important one.  It doesn't preach, but teaches.  The music score still haunts me.  I rank it as number one of 1994, and one of the best of the decade.",9,0,0,29 August 1999
The Silence of the Lambs," Brilliant and fascinating
","I have to say that The Silence of the Lambs ranks as one of the best thrillers of the decade.  Anthony Hopkins portrayal of Hannibal Lecter is nothing short of remarkable.  The first scene where we see him is beautifully done.  His voice is utterly chilling and he seduces you into liking him, a difficult task. Jodie Foster also gives a great performance as Clarice Starling, sent to interview Lecter in the hopes that it will lead to the capture of Buffalo Bill. Their four scenes together are nothing short of magnificent.  The tension that appears is real, and we feel it.     Jonathan Demme is a director whom I have never really admired.  Now, I can say that I do, and this movie is a masterpiece of direction.  Especially the climax.  He also directs the final confrontation scene between Hopkins and Foster very well.  It plays out a perverse parody of a love scene, and there is a lot of sexual tension (especially when he strokes her finger at the end of it).  Simply stated, a great movie experience, and worthy of it's place on the AFI list.",10,1,1,1 August 1999
The Silence of the Lambs," Powerful
","Amazingly frightening.  I won't go on about the plot, but there is everything necessary here to make a good movie.  The Climax is thrilling. The perverse relationship between Clarice Starling (Foster) and Hannibal Lector (Hopkins) borders on romantic.  The sexual tension was unbelievable in some of those scenes ( when he strokes her hands through the bars).See this movie.",10,1,1,12 April 1999
Before Sunrise," Unpretentious, and romantic
","The idea: Two people meet on a train, spend about 24 hours in Vienna together, and fall in love.    This idea is somewhat daring because it is not a 'big' movie, and it isn't plot driven, which could be horrible.  But instead, this movie is a thoughtful, moving romance.   Dialogue driven, the conversations Ethan Hawke and Julie Delpy have aren't necessarily brilliant, but they're real.  They discuss things anyone would discuss (family, friends, etc).  The conversations are intriguing, however, and this draws us deeper into the film.  Julie Delpy and Ethan Hawke are completely natural in there roles.  There is no acting her.  They present these fictional characters honestly and openly.  The thing I enjoyed most about this movie was how real it seemed.  The idea may be slightly fantastic (although I don't think it is), but the execution is grounded solely in reality. A great film, one of the ten best of 1995.",8,1,3,13 August 1999
Speed," Pulse pounding (spoilers)
","This is one hell of an exciting movie.  It starts off with a scene that sets up the suspense level of the movie, with the elevator accident.  It is an incredible sequence, staged so magnificently (my kudos to the editing team.  They did an brilliant job throughout the entire film).  It was a hard act to follow, but director Jan de Bont does it admirably.  The basic plot: a really bad guy (it's Dennis Hopper, everyone's favourite in a performance that's of no stretch) has a score to settle after his simple demands of 3 million dollars aren't met (in the elevator fiasco).  So he puts a bomb on the bus, and wires it to go off if the bus goes below 50 miles.  Some people thought that 50 miles wasn't that fast, but there's absolutely no point in getting hung up on that.  The bus sequence is an intense piece of filmmaking by all involved.  The tautness of the situation is continually raised, and Jan De Bont and writer Graham Yost manage to crank up the suspense factor.  Yes, the bus jumping the fifty foot overpass is ludicrous, but it is gloriously so.  Keanu Reeves actually gives a good performance.  He is attacked for trying to expand is repetoire (Much Ado About Nothing, Dracula), so Speed is a refreshingly simple film for him.  He is a great action hero (which was again proven with The Matrix).  Sandra Bullock has great charisma, and she and Reeves have palatable chemistry.  An action film that cranks up the suspense factor like no other.  Sure, its incongruous sometimes, but why carp?",Null,0,0,8 July 2000
The Sixth Sense," Affecting, though it didn't deserve the best picture nomination
","First of all, forgive me.  I read about the ending before actually seeing the movie.  Now, some of you may think that it ruined the film, but it one way, it enhanced it.  Now, I tried to figure out the clues to the end, and I was stumped.  I just couldn't figure it out.    Anyway, now to the film.  This is a supremely effective chiller that is one of the quietest horror films ever (it whispers the scares).  This is the first film I've seen with Toni Collette in, and she did impress me (though she didn't deserve her nomination).  Her scenes with Haley Joel Osment are minor marvels.  Osment deserved all the praise he received for his performance.  The subtle shifts in emotion were alone worthy of the nomination.  I would have given him the Oscar over Caine (but not over Cruise, Law, or the unnominated Bentley).  Bruce Willis is in his 'strong, silent type' mode, but that didn't bother me.  The reason the film didn't deserve it's oscar nomination was because the film wasn't among the five best of the year.  There were many far more challenging and powerful films in 1999 (however, had it been another year, I probably would have embraced the nomination).  M. Night Shyamalan deserved the praise for his script, but didn't deserve the nomination over Three Kings or The Straight Story.  I was surprised that this film didn't get the win for film editing (it was the best of the five, yes-- better than Matrix or Beauty).  This is a film that was a haunting beauty, and I will see it again (and I'll probably buy it too.)",Null,0,0,18 April 2000
The Truman Show," Great
","I was amazed by this film, and incredibly surprised when it wasn't nominated for best picture.  First, there's Jim Carrey's performance.  It is a departure for him, yet it seems tailor made.  In my opinion, it deserved an oscar nomination.  Ed Harris and Laura Linney were also great.  Peter Wier's direction is remarkable.  He deserved every award he won, and Andrew Niccol's screenplay was certainly better than Shakespeare in Love's, which won (and that annoyed me to no end).  A film that entertains you completely, while asking how completely you should be entertained.  It is a plausible idea, executed brilliantly.  A film I plan to watch again.  Rated #4 on my top ten of 1998.",9,0,0,19 August 1999
The Matrix," A kinetic and visually stunning movie
","The best word to describe this movie is 'cool'.  While not especially descriptive, it is hard to come up with another word to describe the thrill ride you've just been on.  The plot has something to do with the Matrix, a computer-something-or-other. This film is really not about plot.  It is about visual techniques.  And boy, does it fascinate.  The bullet photography and the fight scenes are done incredibly well, the settings very stylish.  I will see this film again, and with try to understand more about the 'plot', but the visuals make this film worth watching more than once.",Null,0,0,9 November 1999
Apollo 13," Amazing
","I did know the story, but I still found myself wondering is they were going to survive or not.  Titanic had other problems, none which I will go into here. Apollo 13 was my favourite film of 1995 ( a close race with Il Postino). I thought it was realistic and well acted.",10,1,2,5 April 1999
Gladiator," Hmmm....(spoilers below, though not major)
","This film is probably the best blockbuster of the summer.  It has grisly and rousing action, wonderful technical direction from Ridley Scott, and masterful performances from Crowe and Pheonix.  Flaws always first.  The opening battle sequence is confusing, and tries to be chaotic, when it is just incoherent.  However, the rest of the film justifies Scott's technical brilliance (more on that later).  The screenplay isn't as much a story told with action sequences but a string of action sequences with some connecting thread.  However, it allows for some great acting.  The script introduces a startling relationship between Commodus (Joaquin Pheonix) and his sister Lucilla (Connie Nelson), giving Pheonix and added dimension to chew through.  And does he ever.  One of his three films this year, Pheonix proves that he can act in several diverse roles.  This will probably garner him on Oscar nomination.  His snivelling, ambitious emperor provides a fine foil for Crowe's Maximus.  Crowe finally cements his star status with this film, after amazing turns in The Insider and L.A. Confidential.  His performance is brutal and intense.  In fact, the screenplay spares nothing on his character, giving Crowe several powerful scenes (the climax, his prison conversation with Lucilla, and his earlier conversation with Marcus Aurelius).  He'll probably get an oscar nod as well.  Now, the direction of Ridley Scott.  I am not a huge fan of his, so I was pleased to see him handle both the technical and narrative direction with equal aptitude.  His technical direction is superb, ranking with Blade Runner and Alien.  For the first (arguably second) time, however, he has paid attention to the story (the first being Thelma and Louise).  And it has paid off handsomely.  Look for Gladiator to have the most nominations at the academy awards this year  (I'm guessing 11).",Null,0,0,26 December 2000
Contact," Amazing
","This is an intelligent, compassionate film.  In 1997, it was one of two intelligent science fiction movies (the other was Gattaca).  This is a brilliant film, from the awe-inspiring opening sequence to the ending, it rings with true emotions.  Jodie Foster gives a performance I would have nominated for the oscar, and Basset is no less than stunning. The directing, while good, lets this film wander for two and a half hours.  I rated this film number 3 of 1997, behind The Sweet Hereafter and Gattaca.",Null,0,1,30 November 1999
Contact," Beautiful
","This film is what science fiction is all about.  Hollywood released two sci-fi films in one year that I thought to be great ( Gattaca was the other).  Jodie Foster is simply sensational, and James Woods gives another scene stealing performance. For those who didn't like the ending didn't understand it.  It was giving you a choice, to agree with Ellie or to disagree with her.  You can argue the static was proof, but so many things could have happened. I am not a big fan of Robert Zemeckis, especially after Forrest Gump. This movie redeemed him in my eyes. I went to this film with high expectations, and Contact was better than I thought it would be.  A thinking person's sci-fi.",Null,0,1,24 May 1999

","This movie still packs a punch, after all these years and the toning down of the book.The book runs over 800 pages, and is a masterpiece.  The film is a brilliant masterpiece.The actors are all brilliant.  Montgomery Clift, in a role which spawned all the James Dean roles, is absolutely riveting.  Someone said he has the face of an agonized angel, and I agree.  He should have won the oscar.  Burt Lancaster and Deborah Kerr are also amazing, but Frank Sinatra and Donna Reed won deserved Oscars for their performances.The direction from Fred Zinneman is flawless.  The brilliant script is great.The homosexual subtext of the movie is there, but it's also toned down for the censors at the time.",10,0,0,4 September 1999
The Godfather," A true masterpiece (spoilers)
","From the wedding scene, the 'I Believe in America' speech, and the horses' head in the bed, there has not been a better film.  While you may think this designation is undeserved, you would be wrong.  Few movies have slipped into society like this one has. The opening wedding scene ranks as one of the most effective introductions in film history.  We get to know all the characters, from Don Vito Coreleone (Marlon Brando, in a masterful performance) to his sons, Michael (Al Pacion), Sonny (James Caan), and Fredo (John Cazale). 
  Several scenes from this movie will remain in your mind for quite a while. Marlon Brando's wheezing death, The baptism sequence cut in with several murders.  The beginning wedding sequence, and the ending.  The dialogue is perfect, thanks to an incredible script by Mario Puzo and CoppolaEverything about this film is on target.  Nino Rota's beautiful score is one of the best, with the 'Love Theme' ranking as one of the most famous pieces of film music ever.  The performances are all first rate.  Though Marlon Brando won the award, it is really Al Pacino who is the lead actor, and deserved the best actor Oscar.  James Caan also finds the right note as the aggressive, impulsive Sonny.  The cinematography and art direction are perfect.  And all this comes down to Francis Ford Coppola's masterful direction.  There is no way Bob Fosse deserved the Oscar over Coppola.
  Is this film better than Citizen Kane?  Tough to say. Both were ground-breaking classics that utilized new technical and narrative techniques.  I would have to say yes, because the story here, about loyalty, family and honor, had more impact on me than the rise and fall of Charles Foster Kane.",10,1,3,31 December 1999
