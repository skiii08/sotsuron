The New World," The New World - A MUST SEE!
","The New World was fantastic! The reviews did not give it it's due credit. The genuineness of the scenes, characters and gestures from the Algonquin language, sign language to Pocahontas herself exceeded expectations. It's an epic that should be put in the same prestigious categories as Titanic and Troy. All the speculation that Q'rianka Kilcher's performance was exploitation since she was still a teenager at the time of her performance, without such an actress the movie would not have had the same haunting effect. None of the scenes exhibited exploitation, or anything of that sort. It is a love story, true and simple. The eight months it took to find her were definitely worth it. Colin Farrell also deserves credit for his successful and romantic portrayal of John Smith.A MUST SEE!",10,2,5,22 May 2006
