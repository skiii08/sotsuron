It," Really well made !
","The current trend of horror movies usually involve sudden 'in-your-face' movements which are pretty scary. Having seen many such movies, it is hard to shock the audience. This movie is based on Stephen King's book which was written back in 1986. As such, it follows the trend of those times - good storyline, interesting characters, good chemistry between them, good acting & slow psychological buildup of scary scenes rather than sudden movements. Its a refreshing change to see such a movie. Bill Skarsg√•rd has done a splendid job as Pennywise the shapeshifting demon. His wicked smile remains with you even after the movie. There are plenty of hidden scary parts in the scenes which remain in the background (eg : the library scene). Highly recommend watching it on the big screen.",8,8,15,17 September 2017
