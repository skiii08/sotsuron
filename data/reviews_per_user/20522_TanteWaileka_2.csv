Requiem for a Dream," Spoiler: Worst piece of cr@p ever
","The only thing good about this film was the cinematography. It reminded me of writings by Jerzy Kozinski who committed suicide at 57, understandably, because he clearly hated life as witnessed by the cr@p that HE wrote. (Hey, this is MY opinion, you can have a different opinion, that's fine with me.) Why Ellen Burstyn acted in this movie is beyond me, she must have needed the money. The portrayals of the drug addicts was a tad too 'black and white' and life is NEVER b/w. As for the portrayals of the medical staff and the police, I don't buy it. I notice they did the 'usual thang' and make the SOUTHERNER doctors/jailers/police the 'bad' ones. Typical. Are there bad doctors, medical staff, jailers and police? Sure, but not as often as 'movie/tv makers' would have you believe. Also, the drug addicts were portrayed more as 'victims' then as 'self annihilators'. The only character I felt sorry for was Ellen Burstyn's. I am thankful I was working on my website when this cr@p was on Amazon Instant Video or I wouldn't have watched it past the first five minutes. UGH is the 'key word' to describe this. The only response I have for this garbage getting an 'award nomination' is DISDAIN.",1,4,7,2 October 2013
Crazy Heart," another sloppy movie about a drunk with a sloppy actor
","I don't get why Jeff Bridges keeps doing these movies about sloppy people. I thought it stunk. He could do movies about people who CARE about their lives, how short life is, the meaning of life, the innate goodness of people, but no, he keeps doing sloppy movies about sloppy people who sloppily meander through life. Pretending that there is some redeeming quality to this movie is just that -- a pretense. The music was third-rate, heck, I can sing better than that in the shower. Even the guitar playing was 'average high schooler'. What was the point of this movie? It was depressing. I think that Mr. Bridges probably has a pretty good life so he doesn't realize that the goal of Hollywood should be to ENTERTAIN not to depress. He makes hopeless movies just like Steven King writes hopeless books.",1,3,8,3 October 2011
