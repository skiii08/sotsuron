Catch Me If You Can," a lot of fun
","this is just a thoroughly enjoyable movie. it doesn't have any spectacular traits that make it outstanding, but its just fun all the way through. it has great characters, delightful performances that one would expect from the actors in these movies, and an enjoyable plot that never gets too fast or too slow. its the perfect pace, and has very few errors. the flaws of this movie are very slight and unnoticeable. the music ties into the movie very well and helps keep the pace and the mood. and don't get me started on the main character. leo depicts frank abagnale jr so flawlessly, and he is just full of charisma. its hard not to like him. christopher walken is as good as ever, which is shown by his Oscar nomination. tom hanks isn't his best, but that certainly doesn't mean he was bad. he was still very good, which, of course, is sub par for tom hanks. all in all, it was a thoroughly enjoyable movie for someone who is looking to have fun rather than critique.",8,1,3,22 December 2015
Se7en," really good
","se7en was a very unsettling and well made movie. though most of the movie was conversation and could probably put many people to sleep, it quickly picked up pace towards the end and surprised everybody. i already knew the ending going in, yet i was still in shock. i think the main goal of the movie was not to be super intriguing or well written, and David fincher probably wasn't shooting to make a movie that would be rewatched thousands of times by countless people, but a movie that made a lasting impression on the thoughts of viewers. the goal seemed to be to make people think about the world we live in, and how diverted it is from God's original perspective. i will say that the acting was very good, and even though brad pitt had some questionable moments, he delivered a great performance where it was most needed. so did morgan freeman, and kevin spacey in the few minutes he had. the only reasons this got a 9 was 1) because it's a 2 hour movie, and while it was made this way to ensure that people got the whole story and no plot holes came up, it would've been a little less boring if it was shorter and 2) because mills is somewhat of a typical, single minded character most of the time, kind of a typical hotheaded cop.",8,2,3,7 July 2015
Home Alone," more of a must see than great movie
","it's not without it's flaws, that's for sure. the acting isn't amazing, some plot points aren't great, and it doesn't have a dialogue that's anything special. but this is an American treasure. i would never call it one of the top 10 movies i've ever seen, but it is definitely one of my top 10 favorite movies. it's a movie that if you haven't watched, you haven't lived. it's one of the most defining Christmas movies with values and life lessons entrenched in the plot. it's just such a fun movie that everyone will love even if they don't think its a great movie in and of itself. it's kind of hard to explain, but you just have to watch this movie if you've never seen it. you definitely won't regret it.",9,3,5,28 November 2016
The Prestige," amazing
","in the beginning, i was thinking: this movie is totally overrated. its not even that interesting. but it captures the true nature of what movies were supposed to be in the first place. most movies today have an intense, climactic ending, while this movie just keeps picking up speed, becoming more interesting as the plot delves deeper and darker and even though one can't seem to grapple which character they support, you'll love this movie and its mind blowing ending. some people say its hard to understand. its really not. if you just pay attention, then you will completely understand it, even though the various jumping around between the years will be confusing. the plot of this requires geniuses at the same level as those of the dark knight. i only have one grievance: if they made this movie today it would've been slightly better because i feel that both hugh jackman and scarlett johansson's acting has developed and become a lot better over the last nine years. also, its not the type of movie you can watch again soon. if you wait a couple years then you'll feel the hype again.",10,0,1,3 April 2015
Suicide Squad," more than a missed opportunity
","I'm astounded by how much wasted money was poured into this movie. if the studio and the producers saw the script, why did they fund this movie? there are an incredible number of flaws, so much so that I'd call the movie a flaw in and of itself and it'd be quicker to name what's good about the movie. but there's no fun in that, so let's run through what makes this flick horrible.the base plot. you can't have the suicide squad going on a mission to fight a supernatural and/or magical entity. in almost every iteration of the suicide squad, at least half of the team has no superhuman ability, or at least a power that's not very, well, powerful. this adaptation is one of those, with the entire squad being basically powerless except for diablo. so most of the squad is essentially useless during the most important parts of the movie, seeing that the main villain is a magical witch and her brother. a lot of the plot details.
-what was the point of keeping the full details of the mission secret for so long? the squad can't do anything anyway. they have bombs in their necks.-the beef between flag and deadshot that headed off most of the first half of the movie just didn't make sense. it was inorganic, and we all knew how it would end.-thrusting bits and pieces of the harley quinn/joker backstory into the movie here and there was both annoying and confusing-the camaraderie between the group felt very fake and shoehorned by the end. -and others i can't remember off of the top of my head.the script. deadshots lines were absolutely horrible most of the time. diablo's were a little clichÃ© as well. flag's weren't great. harley quinn's were fine, but i'll expand on her below. but i have to say, killer croc had the worst dialogue of any superhero movie this century, hands down. it's hard to put it into a review without going through the movie scene by scene, but if you watch you'll probably know what i mean when i say that the script could've been better written by an average liberal arts sophomore.the acting i guess was alright. i would attack will smith, but i know that he was given awful lines to work with, and when he had decent dialogue, he delivered pretty well. jai courtney's horrible acting was at least slightly hidden. joel kinnaman, though, had some very rough moments, even though for about 65% of the movie he was somewhere between passable and good. viola davis disappointed me, not because she was bad, but because she was only okay. jared leto, though, was a disgrace. his joker voice sounded like his mouth was full of spit, his laugh was just plain bad, and the way his scenes were shot and edited didn't do him any favors. margot robbie is a special case. i think she did well, but the problem was that everything around her was so bad, it just made her lines, acting, and character be judged sort of unfairly. i think that if the other aspects of the movie were good, then she'd shine a little more, but the overall low quality of the rest of the movie clouds our judgement of her performance and the character of harley quinn.the pacing of a lot of the scenes is also disjointed. i wouldn't say the movie is too fast paced, but it rushes through a lot of things it could slow down on.don't watch this movie. i thought i would, saying to myself that it couldn't be that bad. well, it really can. i don't understand people who say this is better that BvS. that movie is more boring and dreary with a few bright spots rather than just wholly a failure like this one is.",4,0,0,10 March 2018
Interstellar," amazing
","i want to give this a 10/10. i really do. the emotional spectrum of this mind blowing journey with so many moments that just made you feel how much hope means to people, and through the futile journey of loss and longing you can either cling on to that last, flickering hope, or you can just let it go. i loved the main character, coop was such a privilege to watch, and mcconaughey has yet to let me me down. most of the other performances were good, with anne hathaway being as mediocre as ever except in a select few moments, like at the end. i normally don't like space movies, or any movie like gravity, for that matter. they just make me have that feeling of loneliness and despair, because i could not imagine a world in which id want to go into space. but this movie takes that and taps into it so well, especially with the character of dr. mann, who i really couldn't blame for trying to abandon the other astronauts to get home. there are only a couple of reasons i didn't give this a 10/10. it was very confusing, and i consider myself to be a fairly well educated person, and i usually understand complex things. but i had to go to wikipedia towards the end of the movie because i really did not get what was happening. yes, the way they wrote the script was so that they'd explain everything after the whole confusing morse and binary code scene was over, but still. also, it took me a while to try to figure out exactly what dr. mann was trying to do when he attacked coop, because they really didn't mention that they had low fuel until after he died. and i don't think he knew they had low fuel, so why didn't he just tell them that the planet was inhabitable and they could all go home TOGETHER. and lastly, i heard a good amount of this movie's appeal was the visual effects, and i didn't watch interstellar in theaters, rather, i watched it on my laptop so i kind of got to see some of the flaws of the movie without my judgement being partially blinded by the amazing visuals, which were still pretty good on my mac.",9,0,2,27 August 2015
American Hustle," good not great
","more of a critic pleasing movie than a moviegoers'. the acting was mainly the highlight of the movie, which is expected of the all star cast, but the characters are never really likable or people that anyone wants to root for. sure, they are relatively strong characters, and they show good development, but i don't really care when something bad happens to any of them. Christian bale is my favorite actor and i tend to support each of his roles in movies, yet i didn't really like irving that much. i did think that the foundation that was built for richie in the beginning of the movie was good, showing him as a loser that just wanted to make a name for himself and feel success for once in his life, as he was living with his mother and a fiancée that he did not care about at all. but then they made him more of a jerk as the movie went on. i guess they made him a jerk so that no one would feel bad when he lost at the end of the movie, but they didn't do it well enough because i definitely felt kind of bad for him. also, the movie was well written and had a good plot, but not enough intrigue. American hustle seemed more on the side of winning over the academy than being a people pleaser. also, i think exploring the friendship that irving and carmine built a little more would've been good.",7,0,2,6 July 2015
Beasts of No Nation," I couldn't finish it
","It started off great. Few war movies are so inspiring. Idris Elba was amazing, and I think Abraham Attah could give Haley Joel Osmont a run for his money in the 'Best Child Actor Performance of All Time' category. The cinematography was great, the landscape in which it was shot was a beautiful jungle, the murder of Agu's dad and brother and the first couple of battle scenes were touching, and the Commandant and Agu were both inspiring and very admirable characters. But then it took a sick, twisted turn for the worse.I read the synopsis. I think it's safe to say that 90% of people who watched this movie would've hoped it went a different way. Everything about the film was great, except for the plot itself. The Commandant became a rapist, and Agu became a druggie.Why? Why couldn't this have been a movie about an army of African child soldiers led by an inspiring revolutionary who overcame odds and defeated the government? But no, this has to be a messed up story about a revolutionary leader who gives a whole speech to Agu about how he sees leadership in him, and then proceeds to rape him. His speeches talked about the rape prevalent in their country that was a result of the government, yet he is a perpetrator of it himself!I know this was based on a book, and people would've been outraged if it was a bad adaption and left things out, so I guess I'm targeting the author here, but why couldn't it have been at least half of a happy story? Lots of movies end with the antagonists winning, but usually we are secretly rooting for them in some way, or at least something decently good happens. Nothing positive takes place in this movie. Nothing at all.If there were no drug problems, no rape, and the Commandant faithfully led his battalion without any worries about pay or twisted fantasies, and then they failed, then I would've been okay with it. But this movie just doesn't please the viewer at all.I know that there are many stories like this in Africa, and screwed up events like this take place, probably more often than anyone would expect, but this movie fails to present a point it is trying to make or a theme they are trying to bring out that most movies in which the opposite of what the viewers want to happen usually have. It's just disappointing.",5,2,11,8 February 2016
Kick-Ass," good not great
","the best part about this movie are the action scenes, mainly the ones involving big daddy and hit girl. but what this movie lacked most was an intriguing plot. it also wasn't as funny as I expected, and while it wasn't expected to be good, the acting was sub par. i know mark strong could've done better, especially early on in the movie, which, with good acting, would've established frank damico as a more sinister villain. the love story that developed between dave and kate was relatively good, though, and I was disappointed to learn that they break up in the second movie. I really liked the occasional comic book storytelling or transition, though, and again, the action was great, but his best friends are only occasionally there for comic relief and are pretty much useless. but in my opinion, the worst part is his ease with the concept of killing. he doesn't kill for the entire movie, yet he does it with the gatling gun on the jetpack without contemplating what he was doing. and he never questions why an 11 year old would be killing in the first place. one of the central themes of superhero movies is the justification to kill and this movie completely glazes over it.",6,0,0,7 July 2015
Inception," nolan almost at his finest
","this is nolan's 2nd best movie of all time, and i think you can infer what i think is nolan's best. the originality of the script and the concept that this brilliant movie was conceived from is absolutely stunning. the cinematography, again with the nolan and wally pfister pair that stunned us in the dark knight trilogy. this has the aspect of nolan movies that i always like: there's a lot of information that is relatively essential to the movie that is easy to forget as more and more information is piled on. then the second time you watch it, you're still able to absorb all of the amazing elements of this incredible journey, but know everything is coming together and you can actually understand it a lot better. the scene switching as the story is narrated from every level of the dream is magnificent, as we cut from yusuf trying to escape from the projections in the first dream, to arthur's dilemma with protecting the sleeping team in the second dream, to trying to actually plant the idea in the third dream, to everything that happens in limbo. while this may not count as one scene, because its literally half of the movie, its still indescribably outstanding.even though the movie wasn't as confusing as i was told it would be, with this complex of a plot, there are bound to be plot holes. i only detected a couple, but they were minor, and nowhere near as obvious as the ones in the dark knight rises. but even if there were more, they probably wouldn't make this film that much worse, just separate a crowd of fans who will immediately dub the movie as terrible, as the same crowd did with the dark knight rises.the only thing that had potential for bringing the movie down was the performances. they weren't bad, more just mediocre. none of the supporting roles really called for major performances, except for marion cotillard in a few instances, and while she didn't do what i thought her best was, she was fine. but this probably isn't even in leonardo dicaprios top 10 performances, as he was maybe even a little less than mediocre for most of the movie.some people thought the ending was ambiguous, or left things a little unclear. was the top wobbling, and about to fall, or was it going to stay up forever? i think this was more to be left to the viewers imagination, and i think it was definitely about to fall.",10,0,2,29 August 2015
Star Wars: Episode VII - The Force Awakens," i feel like i should give it an 8 but i don't want to
","not flawless, but still very, very good.what many negative reviews say is that its a 'remake' rather than a sequel. it certainly seems that way, but it was definitely done that way for a reason: to appease star wars fanboys. you can see so much of a new hope in this movie that its crazy. but that isn't a bad thing. its just something that will cleanly divide viewers of this movie. some people love it, some people criticize it for being this way. personally, i think they went just a little overboard with the nostalgia, but they did what they originally planned to do: revitalize the series, try to remedy the damages done by the prequels, and start off what looks to be a great trilogy. this movie does a lot of setting up, with plot, characters, and even themes. rage is something i had never seen in a sith but it was always said throughout all of the star wars movies that it was a path to the dark side, and this movie really showed that. it also answered a lot of questions that people had coming into this movie.one thing i especially liked are the new characters. finn is very charismatic and rey is a strong independent woman, and they can be correlated with han and leia, but finn its as if they took some of hans qualities out of finn and plugged in some of Luke's original qualities in a new hope, and then did the same with some of the leia qualities in rey. overall, I'm really excited for these characters, and new ones to come (benicio del toro). also, I'm now a fan of Oscar isaac, and while his acting was questionable at times, he did a great job as a character who wasn't really based off of anybody.while we are on the topic of acting, i want to mention that abrams did a great job of taking these D-list actors and turning them into stars.the main reason i couldn't hate all of the correlations with a new hope is because, well, its star wars, and they copied great concepts from a great movie.",7,10,21,18 December 2015
Mad Max: Fury Road," alright
","i came into theaters to see this movie hoping that it would be absolutely amazing, as thats what all of the critics and the freaking 8.7 rating on IMDb said. but honestly, i don't see what all of the hype is about. sure, all of the effects were pretty cool and the action scenes were entertaining, but at the end of the day, what is it? its a movie about a post apocalyptic car chase that has a couple battles while they are driving. the characters weren't that in- depth, and they had little development. and i have not enough knowledge about the little civilization that immortan joe has that they overthrow at the end to actually be rooting for them. the acting was relatively good, and the three main characters, portrayed by charlize theron, tom hardy, and nicholas hoult were well played, but i wasn't that enthralled in the movie. and i was expecting more action that i got. and it wasn't as gruesome as i expected. probably shouldn't have been rated r. it really wasn't that gory or sexual, and i don't remember any swears. some scenes were very well done, though. but if all the scenes were done as well as those, i'd definitely like this movie a lot more. maybe its because i didn't watch it in 3D?",4,0,2,16 June 2015
