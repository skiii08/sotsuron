Miracle," Great Movie
","This is one of the best movies I've seen in a very long time. The fact that they used real hockey players makes a world of difference. I also like the fact that this is a true story and the directors did a good job of keeping it true with the help of Herb Brooks and members of the real 1980 Olympic team. Even Al Michaels said that he when he watched the movie, he would forget that this was not the real game (and he was the one calling the game at the Olympics in 1980). What I don't understand is people making comments about this movie who clearly state that they are not sports fans. Of course they wouldn't get it. It's about believing in the power of teamwork and working hard to accomplish a mutual dream. You don't have to be a 'hockey' fan to appreciate this movie. It's a movie that leaves you feeling good, and we need that right now... just like we needed it back then.I understand why the director wanted to show Herb's family life, but I thought those scenes with his wife just slowed things down. Guess I was just more interested in the dynamics of the hockey team. See this movie... you won't be sorry.",10,1,1,21 June 2004
