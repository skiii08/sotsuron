Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," A well-paced, engrossing sci-fi spectacular.
","I saw the new Star Wars film at the first midnight screening and had mixed feelings about it. I have since seen it 2 more times and realize that this is an extremely involved storyline and that it sets the groundwork for the next 2 films. There are many eyebrow raising revelations and hints of things to come. I cannot wait to see what's next. Oh yeah, the special effects are, of course, eye-popping. I was 12 years old when the first film was released. Kudos to George Lucas for re-kindling my Star Wars fire. The critics be damned !! I feel like a kid again !!",9,0,0,23 May 1999
