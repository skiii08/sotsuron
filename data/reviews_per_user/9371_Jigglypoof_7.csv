The Blair Witch Project," Unique but disappointing.
","My advice - Be glad it's not true, but don't try to find out details about HOW it was made until you see it, or you could ruin it for yourself.My initial reaction when I first started hearing about this film was, oh my God, that is some scary sh... stuff!  I was genuinely scared to even entertain the possibility that this could have been real.  So I went and did some research, as I do with films I am frightened to see, yet pique my interest.  Obviously the official site mentions nowhere that the film is neither fiction nor authentic... so that didn't help... but I happened to come across an urban legends site which put my mind at ease.  As a general rule I am not a fan of horror films, but every once in a while a plot line grabs my attention.  Once I found out that there was minimal gore, I decided to take a chance on it.  Not knowing it was fiction, and had there been showers of blood and guts, it would have sent me into a sheer anxiety and fear... as horror films tend to do with me, and I would still have avoided it like the plague. (Such is the case with Scream 3 - the story intrigued me but I went to others to spoil it because of the hype, and the gore.  I only half watched Scream.)  I would only watch Blair Witch during the day on a small screen with friends.  Obviously, being in a theater, you are thrust into it and the experience would have to feel 'more real'.  I knew that the story was fiction and so I could reassure myself that it was 'only a movie'. 
  However, knowing details of how the film was made also comforted me, yet made me skeptical.    With that in mind, I must say that, while the concept of the film is unique, as you get to see from the victim's point of view, I was disappointed.  Perhaps ONLY knowing that the film was false and that there wasn't any gratuitous violence (or aftermath thereof) would be enough for me to almost enjoy this film.  I understand that it was even reported here that the actors were deceased, for a time.  It is amazing, and almost sickening, that a story can be so believable that you can forget to mention that it is merely fiction and people will be terrified into near insanity.  Credit must be given to the filmmakers on this genius for believability.  But, of course, carrying on with that would be sick.  Just hearing how scared people were makes my stomach turn.  Why would a filmmaker decide not to clearly state that it was a work of fiction?  Even to put someone through the anguish is enough to haunt me.  But I'm not here to place blame on the filmmakers.  With other horror films... even though I KNOW they're not true... they terrorize me with the depiction of graphic violence.  So, while this is a great idea... the admission that it was fiction is both a blessing to those who believed it, and, in a sense, a disappointment to those who thought it would be like The Exorcist, which, though possibly quite embelleshed, very well could, and does, happen.  But maybe you should wait until you see the film before you go and find out exactly how it was made.  Although I guess I wasn't paying a whole lot of attention to the beginning because the ending left me puzzled and asking alot of questions.  It just left me empty.  But that's all I'll say about the ending.",Null,0,1,19 February 2000
The Big Lebowski," I usually don't have anything bad to say but WTF?
",You have to be on weed to understand this movie.  Seriously.  And that Walter character reminds me of Homer Simpson... you just want to wring his neck!  I usually don't have anything bad to say about movies but what the hell!?  This must be a guy thing.  I am completely lost.  I could think of much better ways to spend an evening.  Sorry.,Null,1,2,10 November 2000
X-Men," Nothing could compare with the comment on the database page but anyway...
","I was not generally a fan of comic book heroes and I'd never really watched X Men to any great extent.  Even so, I enjoyed this film.  Many young people today know at least some of the X Men story line, and that helped me enjoy the film more than I would have if I went in completely ignorant.    I have to say... gosh that Hugh Jackman looks like Clint Eastwood.  I'm glad I'm not the only one who thought this.  And Anna Paquin... she is so pretty... and she does such a good job with this... she makes you feel her anguish.    I don't think they could have picked anyone better than Patrick Stewart to play Dr. X.  As far as Beast being missing... I saw an episode of the animated show and remembered that he was one of the characters... yes... he is missing... but they will likely get to him in the sequels (you know there are going to be sequels... hopefully they won't follow the sequel curse).  This movie is great for fans (it's just the beginning) and those who are open minded to explore ideas that they never had much interest in before. It's not enough to make me into a die hard X Men fan... but I've always been open to the story and never put it down... so it's just cool to me. 
  Not to mention I'm a female.  Bet you didn't see that one coming.",Null,0,0,29 August 2000
Man on the Moon," What are you people talking about?
","'The announcement came as Carrey's latest film, Man on the Moon (1999), seemed certain to become the comic actor's biggest failure.' - January 17th, 2000 IMDB NEWS BRIEF.  I fail to understand what that news story meant... Jim Carrey gave an Oscar worthy performance as Andy Kaufman...  I know the film is not at #1 right now, I don't know if it ever got to that point, but I don't see it as a failure.    Originally I wasn't going to make a comment on this film because the comment on the main page sums it up well.  I just don't understand the statement.",Null,0,0,17 January 2000
Ghostbusters," What can I say?
","When this film was released, I was only about five... so even if I did see it then, I wouldn't have understood it that well, though I did love the song.  I was about nine or ten before I fully got into it, just before the sequel was released.  I tend to develop crushes on men in movies when I really enjoy a film.  I won't say which one it was, but in retrospect I have an attitude now of, 'what the hell was I thinking?  The man had to be at least 20 years my senior... old enough to be my father!'  I was teased quite a lot for it.  So after the fixation on Ghostbusters went to the wayside, I only recently watched some of this film during the holiday season (I own the sequel).  The mixture of storyline, humor, intensity and a touch of horror makes this one of the cinematic gems of the past decade... quite possibly the past century.    And it can be enjoyed by people of pretty much any age.  When you're young, you wouldn't understand some of the humor that when you get older you would understand.    Lots of fun... and the special effects were amazing for the time.  I recommend it for anyone.",Null,0,0,5 March 2000
The Matrix," Special effects are top notch. Good movie for those into this kind of thing.
","Again, like with the Blair Witch Project, I ventured to watch this film as I was told there wasn't any gory violence.  I won't deny that the special effects are outstanding.  However, I am not generally a fan of these, 'the world isn't real' movies, e.g The Truman Show, etc. as I am quite impressionable, so this film may be good for some people and not others.    Yes, I know that it's a fictional story.  I'm just not a fan of films that mess with your head for a while after you watch the film.  This one wasn't too bad but it makes you think.  So, I would recommend it for people who can check their reality at the door.  I prefer something a little lighter, but it is an excellent film for those who aren't impressionable like me.",Null,0,0,5 March 2000
Princess Mononoke," Don't tell me I'm the only one who wrote a review for this...
","Very smooth, detailed animation.  I've never seen Japanese anime like it. Those little tree ghosts are too cute.  Good balance of dark and bright themes.  Gory in places... not quite for younger children... but a good movie.  Not much I can say... I'm not exactly an expressive genius like some reviewers I've seen.  Must be seen to be appreciated.  Enough said :o)",Null,0,1,18 September 2000
