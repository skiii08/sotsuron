Catch Me If You Can," Catch it if you can
","Catch Me if You Can is a fun ride based on the true life adventures of Frank Abagnale Jr. who, starting at the ripe old age of 16, posed as a pilot, a doctor and a lawyer (actually passing the bar) and wrote over 4 million in phony checks by the time he was 19 years old. I have read Mr. Abagnale's book and it is truly an amazing story. The screenwriter did a very good job of turning what could have been just one escapade after another into a thoughtful story of a young, smart, highly sensitive boy who was traumatized by his parent's divorce. He ran away when forced to choose between his two parents, and got caught up in a web of deception which took on a life of its own. Spielberg had to leave a lot of the details of the story out of the movie in order to more fully explore the motivations of the characters. I think this made the movie more interesting and added a serious dimension to what otherwise might have been fluff. After Schlinder's List, I believe this is Spielberg's best film. Great acting by all, especially Christopher Walken. Wonderful cinematography. The set design & costumes envelop you in the '60's. Perhaps the real star of this film, however, is the original score by John Williams.....very sophisticated! In every way a real treat of a movie!",9,1,3,16 June 2006
The Bridge on the River Kwai," The absurdity of war
","I think I am speaking for most women when I say that war movies are not my favorite genre. However, this is not your typical war movie. It is a fascinating character study of the madness of the men who have chosen, and are devoted to military life. It shows the impact of their decisions on the lives of the men and women who get swept up into their dustbin of insanity. Sir David Lean, the director, grew up in a Quaker family, which I believe helps to explain his perspective in this film and others of his. As so many others have mentioned, the performances are wonderful. Even though I am not a big fan of Alec Guinness because I feel that he has a tendency to overact, I do agree that this is perhaps his best performance. I think this is largely due to David Lean's direction. He understood that an epic should be character driven. I believe Lean to be the master of the epic, not merely because of his cinematographic genius, and his wonderful use of music, but because he realized the importance of closely focusing on his main characters. A good epic has to be about more than beautiful vistas and haunting music. We have to care about and be interested in the people involved. He knew how to pull all of these elements together. The movie is best seen on a large screen in order to do justice to the cinematography and sheer scope of this film. A film treasure!",10,1,4,16 June 2006
