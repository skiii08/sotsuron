The King's Speech," I can't believe these guys won me over so easily
","First hurdle, this is about royalty. I've spent way too much time fighting boneheads who think they're America's new aristocracy to feel predisposed toward this institution. Second hurdle, this is an English period piece. I'm not fond of having to strain to listen to people who seem all too enamored of themselves in order to make out what they're saying through their oh so British accents. Third hurdle, there's little or no action or intrigue in the storyline, just a man, his therapist and his struggle to overcome one of the most pitiful ailments there are. It promised to be something like an updated Miracle Worker but without Patty Duke.I've been so completely reversed it's awe inspiring. I can't think of one aspect of this film that isn't superb in a way that I haven't seen done in years. The sets and staging of scenes alone is worth the price of admission. But all the leads are so good it's unbelievable. My favorite is Geoffrey Rush, but Firth is easily his equal. To my mind this picture can't lose the Oscar race. It's one of a kind.",9,1,3,27 February 2011
Whip It," Surprisingly entertaining -- even for a guy
","Brought the chick flick DVD home for my ailing wife and was happily surprised it was good enough to sit through and enjoy. I thought I'd prefer to miss an Ellen Page movie, she's a been a bit unnerving in the past, but in this case she was quite central to the movie's success. The whole movie's mostly a presentation of Ellen's performance, which would be no problem at all except that I would have enjoyed seeing more of Drew Barrymore and Juliette Lewis; their nicely turned performances seem oddly curtailed. But Ellen has a very low key presence and I'm not sure she could have managed to retain the film's focus without everyone else toning down theirs. We thankfully do get a bigger slice of Kristen Wiig's performance and also both Jimmy Fallon and Andrew Wilson add substantial substance to the film and are memorable. All in all hardly a waste of time and I can't help thinking the IMDb rating is unreasonably harsh. This movie has a lot of heart and I'm guessing Drew has a future as a director far beyond what the rating here indicates.",8,0,3,30 January 2010
Kill Bill: Vol. 2," Anyone placing this film out of the all-time top 10 doesn't love film
","I just watched this film again after having seen it when it first came out and I am awe-struck: I have never seen a film equal itself in spell-binding impact as thoroughly the second time around as 'Kill Bill'. Spielberg and Ridley Scott are two other formidable filmmakers capable of that, to mention a few, but for sheer entertainment value, I think Tarantino clearly outdoes them both. Earlier today at the gym I was watching the death of Go Go in 'Kill Bill: Volume I' and all the way home I was smiling ear to ear. There's no way I was going to miss 'Kill Bill: Volume II'.The thing about Tarantino's masterpiece is that he is dead on in the emotional aspects of the story. The current of feeling is so strong that my wife has to turn away in certain spots. What I can't understand is how is it every actor in this movie was aware of its quality while it was being shot? Somehow every performance is so unbelievably compelling it's quite difficult to judge who did the best job.It's impossible to praise one without wanting to praise them all, but I will say that I thought Uma was a bad choice when I first heard she had the lead. She just seemed too lightweight physically. But rather than spoil the movie, in many ways, she is its best part, which is saying a great deal in this case. Like all great actresses, she essentially makes you fall in love with her. Quite a trick considering she does this by overcoming a substantial barrier of space and time. Could there be a sequel? I wouldn't think it possible except this is Quentin Tarantino.",10,3,7,6 January 2007
Pirates of the Caribbean: On Stranger Tides," Whoever's handling Ms Cruz ought to be shot for her hat
","I found this movie overlong and only occasionally entertaining. Depp, Rush and McShane do excellent jobs but can't quite lift this final Pirate excursion above the tedium. There are memorable moments, but in a film longer than two hours that's not much of a recommendation. What I absolutely hated is something I don't think would bother most people: Penelope's hat.Now I'm no fashionista but for some reason, I found her hat distracting, if not downright annoying. Not sure why but think a simple scarf around her head would have been a vast improvement. She just looked too modern when the film called for a rough and tumble sort. I cannot imagine anyone seriously suggesting the hat was right for the job, but if they did they should be fired immediately.",7,0,0,8 June 2011
Borat: Cultural Learnings of America for Make Benefit Glorious Nation of Kazakhstan," A fairly juvenile exercise to no real purpose
","I almost walked out several times. Borat is not that funny. It's more an almost desperate exercise in bad taste and ridicule. That it miraculously fills up its time was a major surprise after the first ten minutes. Why the extended hotel scene with the fat guy except that Cohen apparently thought things were getting a little too lame? And when not busily trying to extricate itself from its sometimes fascinating but more often just embarrassing vignettes it's indulging itself in bad taste to the point that you too will want to walk out. Somehow, Cohen as Borat comes across as a likable and memorable guy, though he's clearly a maniac. Nothing he does with one exception will make you think he's not a personable maniac. The one scene that made me feel as if I couldn't respect the man was one having to do with Eastern European attitudes toward Jews; it's way overdone. That scene seemed quite unnecessary though you will wonder why I didn't mention others as well. Cohen has a painful sense of humor but I can't help thinking he's not going to be able to do anything but Borat from now on. Any further adventures will have to be reviewed by people who don't like this one before I pay to see another of these films. I found the reviews I read were all quite misleading. This movie is closer to guerrilla theater than comedy and is better left to a very select and jaded audience.",5,2,7,11 November 2006
Mission: Impossible III," J.J. Abrams pulls out all the stops, propelling Ethan into high orbit
","Tom Cruise has got something almost no one else in Hollywood has, a searing focus and intensity that comes through like some military laser. Despite all the recent hoopla, no one else could possibly seem as dedicated to the mission as Tom. And for some reason that helps us join in on his adventures from our cozy seats in a way others can't deliver as consistently. But without a story and a director to go with it, it's all for naught. Well, fear not! Like Roeper of Ebert & Roeper, I think this is easily the best of the Mission Impossible movies. J.J. Abrams delivers an adrenaline rush that only falters a little near the end, when we're near exhaustion anyway. This is a guy's movie and it kicked off my weekend in fine form. True, it starts out with a somewhat 'feminine' premise, namely that Ethan wants to settle down with the comely Julia, played by Michelle Monaghan. But it only uses that simple motivation to kick off the full-tilt festivities that are captured beautifully by '24's director, J.J. Abrams. Having just recently gotten into '24', I was not expecting the movie I got. Abrams was able to reach a level not really hinted at in the TV series.Kudos to Philip Seymour Hoffman, too. And I have to agree with Roeper on Hoffman's performance as Davian: I wanted more. In fact, if there's a real flaw in this film it's that it didn't take full advantage of Hoffman's coolly riveting interpretation of a oh-so-connected and arrogant arms dealer.",8,2,3,8 May 2006
3:10 to Yuma," Reminds me of some of the better westerns except with more guts
","There's a scene near the end where Christian Bale is clearing the air, so to speak, between himself and Russel Crowe's character, that suddenly made clear to me what the entire film was about. It also dawned on me that Bale is a bit like this generation's Gregory Peck, only better. He seems able to explore other ways of being on screen without losing sight of reality. That's quite a trick, and key in this film, as it's really all about his character, Dan Evans, a struggling ex-soldier with a family and a marginal farm to take care of.Courage is the central preoccupation of this film, so it's more than welcome to see it in the film's production as well. There's a sensibility for weapons, dirt, wagons, injuries, even clothing of the period, on display here that's more than just admirable. It makes you wonder why old westerns didn't explore these elements more thoroughly, though I suppose it had to do with expense. But in having spared that expense these older flicks also failed to pull off the kind of true to life drama that this movie manages to delve into.I also enjoyed the interaction between Crowe, Bale, and his teenage son, William. Though the focus is constantly moving, including generous episodes with a wonderfully nuanced badman played by Ben Foster and some quality time with Peter Fonda and Gretchen Mol, most of the story is in what happens between the ex-soldier, his son, and Crowe's gang leader, Ben Wade. Talk about art imitating life, Crowe is pretty much flawless as the intelligent but amoral Wade.Don't expect a conventional ending. Think about it after you've exited the theater. Aren't we all a mix of good and bad?",9,160,243,9 September 2007
The Hangover," Probably the biggest disappointment this year
","I must have read a half-dozen reviews of this movie before seeing it. My wife and I were in need of a few good laughs but instead we struggled for every one. I frankly can't imagine a more damning criticism. My expectations had been wildly off the mark. The players were pleasant enough but not particularly engaging or worth as much time as given to them here. Allen, though over-the-top, was my favorite as the bearded somewhat sappy goof-ball. He was fun to listen to and watch, for a while. But the storyline was not very impressive and seemed to have been written by someone in high school. It just tries way too hard to be cute. Probably one of its better points is it didn't denigrate or belittle any particular ethnic group. To the contrary, one of its obvious intentions is a strangely low-key and stealth attempt to put in a good word for Jews as, I guess, fairly ordinary, fun-loving people. It did take a shot at gays, however, and Mike Tyson, probably without realizing it, is made to mimic a fairly recent European commercial where an ape plays the drums to a familiar song whose title I can't remember. If I were the producers I'd pray Mike doesn't find out about that!",6,5,15,8 June 2009
Marie Antoinette," This is the first female directed movie I truly admire
","I'd heard that there had been complaints about the music! What a travesty! The music is INGENIOUSLY chosen, and it more than just enhances the drama, it elevates and energizes it. It's up there with the cinematography, and the costumes, and the screenplay, for that matter, as sure signs of Sofia Coppola's undeniable skill and artistry. And both the leads, Kirsten Dunst and Jason Schwartzman respond superbly to her direction. Kirsten has made Marie a sympathetic figure in a way only she could have. There can be no doubt, she stimulates attention and understanding more effectively than any other actress of her caliber, I think. She displays physical weakness while wielding an almost inexplicable but irresistible power. And Jason, in what I would think was an undesirable role, gives a memorable and affecting performance, despite the king's historic limitations.As a guy who likes Quentin Tarantino's movies, I still find women directors interesting. But ever since Jane Campion's 'The Piano' and 'Sweetie', I had to conclude that women were just not as skillful as the great male directors. This movie is not a visualization and exploration of the historical facts, but it is a truly excellent example of art that took a level of character and maturity to produce that I was beginning to think I'd never see in a woman director. You should see this movie not for its history, but for its seductive vision and cinematic power. Good for you, Sofia! I look forward to your next project.",9,1,8,10 April 2007
Gravity," What an utterly worthwhile experience this is
","Like me you've probably pondered whether the planet might be better off without us humans. And maybe it would, but Sandra Bullock and director Alfonso Cuaron make a pretty good case for our having some redeeming qualities despite our usually reckless behavior. Early on in this movie I began to realize that there's no one I'd rather spacewalk with than Ms. Bullock, if only in 3-D IMAX. We're meant to care what happens to the lead, engineer Ryan Stone, and the movie focuses on and depends on that performance; I personally am convinced no other actress could have pulled this off like the endearing Ms. Bullock and I'd be very surprised if she wasn't nominated for an Academy Award.This movie is a wonderful, old-style science fiction movie where ordinary dreamers like you and I get a chance to muse about the reality of being in space. I remember as a kid thinking up pretty much the same sort of not-so-simple adventure as here though not nearly in such detail. That our guides are Ms. Bullock and Mr. Clooney is just icing on the cake.The earth looms below us throughout and it's made very clear how fragile life becomes away from it. Everything is about oxygen, electronics, and the ship, its fuel and its structural integrity. And one thing more, the daunting dynamics of moving in space play a very large and effective role here. Don't expect everything to be rock solid logical, there's at least one liberty taken, just enjoy the trip and you'll be very well rewarded. Any flaws amount to nothing compared to the soaring achievement of the movie itself as an unforgettable entertainment. For once it's unlikely you'll feel cheated being charged extra for either the IMAX or the 3-D, though I suspect those who see this movie without them will still feel quite well satisfied.",9,5,8,4 October 2013
Star Trek," Just saw this on a huge screen with near perfect sound and seating
","My wife enjoyed the film, and don't get me wrong, so did I, but it just wasn't what I was hoping for. The digitized graphics were OK but nothing particularly awesome, and, in fact, the constant motion was fairly annoying. You aren't going to get a chance to marvel at someone's design tour de force, but I'm not sure there were many. The sets were quite derivative of the originals which is to say they may be pretty much 'Star Trek' true, but they're oddly dated today. In fact, now that I think of it, the main leads were also fairly dated as to range of reaction and general attitudes, though probably at near twice normal speed. Still, this is a fun-filled send off of a new crew with a slightly off tone Spock and Kirk. With a stronger storyline this could get engrossing. I generally enjoy the next generation's reworking of any of the old icons. Often they actually step things up a level. This isn't a bad movie. It's just hyped a little too much. I suspect the director is not really a sci-fi fan, and that would have made a real difference.FLASHFORWARDI've now seen the DVD and am a little disturbed to find myself revising the marks I had originally given this movie, revising them higher. The thing is, this movie violates some of my favorite movie tenets like 'don't invent scenes just to get cute about something you can do'. But, you know what? I was wrong. It was worth risking the wrath of people like me. In fact the more I think about this, J J Abrams might be becoming my favorite entertainer, which is what he is. And, especially telling, I completely admire how Pine and Quinto have made this their own franchise. There's a grasp of risk taking laced with quick but thorough thinking that I've never seen before in a sci-fi movie. All the jumps in probability are all for a good cause, a rousing good time",9,1,8,9 May 2009
Fury," Next war watch this movie before signing up
","Having been around awhile I've seen my share of war movies. Back in the last century most were about triumphant, courageous types who were luckier than lottery winners. Bullets always seemed to just miss them while their shots almost always hit the mark. It was a simpler, more simple-minded, time. I think 'Fury' would have appalled 'the greatest generation' having been weaned on John Wayne and Audie Murphy.There's no way to explain it. Brad Pitt and Shia LaBeouf have a better grasp of warfare than your average recruiting sergeant. Their performances here evoke a better sense of battle and war than any I've seen. And I felt as if they were bringing to life exactly what needed to be seen: those scenes between brothers in arms that 99% of soldiers know, no one will ever know or understand.It's a terrifying movie to watch and I'm glad I didn't catch it until the DVD came out. I was able to stop it when it got too intense which was a couple of times. Every performance is beautifully delivered and that's a miracle too. How did the director get these young men to understand what most men never will? It's beyond me.This story is a moving experience but probably not destined to be everyone's favorite, especially women. The only scenes not hip deep in war are shocking and disturbing because they involve men with women under the worst of circumstances. The battle scenes make sense and yet there's no hint they're somehow contrived. That in itself is a unique achievement.I haven't seen 'American Sniper' yet but if it's even half as good as this I'll be quite happy.",9,4,8,29 January 2015
Iron Man 2," One of the most enjoyable films I've ever seen
","You need very little persuasion to fall into this movie's utterly entertaining world. I really can't imagine anyone not liking it. Robert Downey Jr., Scarlett Johansson, Gwyneth Paltrow, and Sam Rockwell in particular all put in near perfect, memorable performances. But it's the very well written story that carried the day, for me. It's not real deep but it's not mere window dressing either. What would Ironman do if requested to give his technology to the military? And how would he handle toe to toe competition? And there's more, but it's better you see it rather than hear about it.John Favreau is clearly gaining in skill and ambition as director while still being willing to feed our male fantasies. Scarlett is a great example as the lithesome Natasha Romanoff. No graphic novel could ever match her role for visual female sumptuousness and sheer beauty. You'll wish there was more of her though wisely Favreau leaves you slightly frustrated. All in all a fun movie way beyond my expectations. But I'm glad I'm not Favreau. What could he do to top these two movies?",9,12,23,21 May 2010
Passengers," A true sci-fi story of the kind I used to read as a kid, done beautifully and convincingly
","The whole idea of traveling between stars has been contemplated for a long time. There are huge obstacles that would have scared off most scriptwriters, but not Jon Spaihts, or the director, Morten Tyldum. Not sure who had the most guts, perhaps both, but the result is spectacular and engrossing. Truth be told there are a couple of plot gimmicks employed to liven up the drama, but I was so wrapped up in the story I hardly noticed.What if you woke up before everyone else on a ship not due to make landfall for 90 years? What might you do out of desperation?Imagining what might happen in a plausible way is either going to fall short or seem magical. This treatment is definitely the latter. The look and feel of the starship is fresh and impressive. And both Lawrence and Pratt do more than what is required by the story, they not only make it all believable, they make it poignant and emotional too. I could see Jennifer's part going to some stunning starlet, a younger Megan Fox, perhaps, but the movie would have lacked the emotional impact it gets from a pro like Jennifer, who gets more alluring with every picture.Rogue One seems pretty childish in comparison.",9,10,18,31 December 2016
The Hunger Games," Well that was surprisingly effective and a pleasure to sit through
","I'd read a couple of professional reviews, thought I knew what to expect. I was wrong. One reviewer thought the motion camera was overdone. In the beginning it did seem as if it might go that way, but quickly it calms down and you forget about it. Another reviewer thought a couple of the characters needed some of their back story told as in the book, but I didn't read the book and didn't miss it at all.What I noticed first was how gripping it all quickly became. I think the director and his screenwriters did a wonderful job. It felt as if the essence of some very compelling book was being conveyed. And that actually was what I thought about second, that I am now extremely curious to know more about the book's author, Suzanne Collins. This film gives no indication it was written by some wishy washy woman without a clue about real combat. There's been some real thought given to what might have happened in real life though her real gift to her readers is her keen understanding of the way leaders manipulate.But the real driving force behind this movie is divided between the writing and the lead, the mega-impressive Jennifer Lawrence. I remember seeing her in 'Winter's Bone' another film set in hill country and thinking I'd like to see more of her. Boy, was I right. Spending the time of this movie with her is a true joy. But her real trick is, I still want more! Something about watching her is very rewarding. I'm at a complete loss as to what exactly except that I kept thinking I know exactly what she's thinking and feeling. That's very rare, especially for such a young actress, I think, to be able to reach an old guy like me so clearly and effortlessly.Of the rest I'd give special attention to Woody Harrelson who is spot on and Donald Sutherland who seems to know about leadership for real. I've no idea where this trilogy is going but I do know I want to see it as it seems millions of others do. I saw this at a matinée in a smallish town and it was packed. I don't doubt this series will be in the Potter range.Finally I'd mention one small quibble I have, but what for? You'll probably notice it yourself and then quickly forgive the director for it. So why mention it at all? Go enjoy!",9,5,16,24 March 2012
The Impossible," Expertly crafted, phenomenally acted
","Not a lot of story here: tsunami hits, family is divided, members are hurt but try to find each other in the utter chaos. Still it's able to put you right there in the horror with two easy to empathize leads and a handful of bafflingly wonderful child actors.You expect this kind of extra-impressive acting from the two old pros, Naomi Watts and Ewan McGregor, but these new kids, especially Tom Holland plying their son Lucas, are at least as effective. Never caught the slightest false move on any of them. Now how is that possible? They've certainly never had to live through anything quite as horrific and yet you would swear they have.Somehow the tsunami itself looks real as does the landscape in its aftermath. We've just spent some time on a beach on vacation and this movie brought it all back. Even the family's dirty and disheveled state looked right in every way.Quibbles might include some unnecessary near misses as they searched for each other and what might have been an overblown rendition of one lead's physical state, but I could just as easily believe this was the way they remembered or lived it.",8,2,4,31 December 2012
The Secret in Their Eyes," 'The Secret in Their Eyes' shows why the Left fears people like me
","The theater manager where I just saw this movie addressed the audience to admit he had hoped The White Ribbon had won the Oscar for best picture this year, but that he understood why this movie won instead. For me there is no question as to this movie having the more current relevance. Bravo to the Academy voters for voting bravely and well.By its end you will have seen an act of seeming inhumanity that I could ascribe to, but I am sure most of my fellow Lefties would find unthinkable. I think my 'comrades' sense me capable of such acts and it scares them. But when the mere joy of decent, ethical behavior isn't enough to entice some to live within acceptable limits, then negative reinforcement is justifiably employed, in my opinion. The problem is, of course, being sure of having the ethical high ground and admittedly, that's no small thing.In this movie there's little doubt the protagonist is a decent man. Benjamín Esposito is unable to let an old murder be forgot. And for good reason: the case's outcome was politically tampered with. In one of the most brilliant scenes I've ever seen, the antagonist's motivation is made crystal clear, so succinctly and efficiently, that I was taken aback for a moment. But the director and I are totally in accord in his opinion of what happened. What I worry about is that most of the audience won't get it.In the theater I saw it, slides preceded the movie explaining that the murder took place before the government's going far to the Right in Argentina. If you don't have a clear understanding of what happened in the '70s in Argentina, you need to do some preparation. That's not going to be necessary for most Lefties who are quite aware of the Dirty War in which the US, never mentioned here, aided the government in committing atrocities.This is a wonderful film carried elegantly along by its main leads, Soledad Villamil as Irene and Ricardo Darín as Benjamin, with the truly brilliant support of its many supporting actors. But in the end its a triumph of film-making for the director, Juan José Campanella, especially, who brings the story to life with consummate skill. He's created a truly pleasurable and memorable experience for people like me.",10,4,7,31 May 2010
Troy," Looks like we've got to go to 1250 BC to avoid Christianity
","I admire Wolfgang's convincing vision and Brad Pitt's interpretation of the spirit of the warrior. All in all a great time at the movies.Brad's wonderfully aggressive as Achilles and you can see why his opponents would fear him and his men would want to fight along side him. I don't think the departures from Homer noted in other comments are important as there's every reason to believe the myth could have arisen from events as depicted here. And all the women were captivating. I especially liked Helen and Hector's wife. Peter O'Toole almost stole the show though his part is relatively brief. But, really, EVERYONE does a great job. There's a very good grasp of courage here that's missing in most of the movies set in similar time periods.Wolfgang Petersen's far more insightful about the reality of that time, and of that kind of warfare, than his predecessors, with the possible exception of Gladiator. I found the computer generated armies only slightly disturbing. The important thing was the vision.And, by the way, though brought up a Catholic: What a relief not to have to endure a lot of Biblical bunk!",9,9,17,17 May 2004
Juno," This is one flick that doesn't live up to its overheated hype
","I had been thinking of going to the Toronto International Film Festival one of these days, but after reading the following quote: 'I don't know when I've heard a standing ovation so long, loud and warm as the one at the Toronto International Film Festival after Jason Reitman's 'Juno,' which I predict will become quickly beloved when it opens at Christmas time, and wins a best actress nomination for its 20-year-old star, Ellen Page.'-Roger Ebert, and after watching the film myself, all I can think is TIFF must be some sort of barely tolerable metrosexual self-adoration festival.Ellen Page is endearing, and capable of holding your attention, for a time, but she's also annoying, in this role, at least. What you are convinced of is, this young woman shouldn't be experimenting with motherhood. She's way too naive and inexperienced. That's not exactly a hard sell, though. So why should we take an evening to delve into this cliché? I guess the answer is so that we can marvel at this young woman's apparent inner resources and irrepressible good humor. The wallowing is a little too unrewarding for me.I admit, thinking about it afterward, it is nice to see some of the characters found in this film displayed totally unadorned and unromanticized, but that's not exactly 'entertaining' without some insight or revelation to go with it. Here we get a somewhat plodding tale of a teenager in trouble surrounded by fairly good-natured but fairly boring types. Even Jennifer Garner manages to be somewhat lackluster here, as they no doubt wanted her to be.",7,1,8,17 January 2008
Match Point," Couldn't get my wife through the DVD, unfortunately
","I thought on Ebert's recommendation that this might be a good choice for my wife's entertainment. She likes romantic intrigue and I was willing to suffer through it since its her birthday weekend. But we both were completely unmoved after 30 minutes of narcissistic posturing and prattling. My eyes wrap around Scarlett Johansson every chance I get but this tiresome wade through English upper class society is too much. I suppose it works best as an anthropological survey but I wasn't in the mood for that. Maybe if I ever get invited into those circles, I'll remember this movie and check it out again. But until then, in my opinion, Woody Allen has delivered a movie of very limited interest.",5,2,3,20 May 2006
Hellboy II: The Golden Army," I should never have listened to the mainstream critics!!
","This was sheer entertainment where the cast and crew create an improbable world that works as well as anything George Lucas has created. Though primed to dislike this movie by the critics, I admired every second of it. Somehow there's something real about the regular world vs other world theme. This is truly an achievement that many would give their eye tooth to match. This is no familiar drama, it's a wildly imagined and beautifully executed tour de force. These artists so thoroughly overwhelm any vision you might have from the comic book that there's no contest.Perlman, not exactly the most likable of actors, is perfect down to every move he makes. You will leave wanting more, much more. And Selma Blair, always engaging, doesn't let the magic falter for a moment. Some of the fight scenes are as good, if not better, than anything I've ever seen in a regular Kung Fu extravaganza, and my only regret is that I didn't see this in the theaters, but on DVD. I blame the critics! A pox on their house!This ensemble reached for something different. I've seen it attempted dozens of times but I've never seen it achieved so convincingly. I'm putting Guillermo del Toro up there with Ridley Scott and James Cameron, but, frankly, I loved everyone's performance. What a delight!",9,3,5,13 November 2008
Cloverfield," A fun film - the shaking camera thing is NOT a problem
","I'm beginning to think some critics are completely out to lunch. Take a completely improbable premise like -- New York City is being attacked by some strange monster -- and run with it. I'd say the chances of coming up with anything even half as entertaining as 'Cloverfield' is about nil. What amazed me most, besides the wonderful way these filmmakers found to visualize this crazy event, is the almost perfect pitch of the young actors in it. They've done a completely convincing job of putting themselves in this fantasy, and that can't have been easy. I'd say several of them have a long career in front of them, though you will probably be annoyed by the comments of the character, Hud, who's holding the camera. That was clearly overdone, but no matter, it doesn't really spoil the party.I see some are comparing this to the 'Blair Witch' movie because of the digital camera thing. To me it's more reminiscent of the classic 'The Blob', one of Steve McQueen's earliest films, only about 100 times more impressive. I'm looking forward to Bad Robot's next offering.",9,0,2,5 July 2008
Once," 'Once' does 'Across the Universe' one better
","It's almost as if some muse has made it her business to prove to me that musicals can be good. First 'Across the Universe' had me with my mouth open, and now 'Once' comes along, and I'm questioning my upbringing. The moments it captures seem so delicate, but they can't be or John Carney would never be able to make this film. And it's not really a musical as much as a movie deeply entwined in music. In a way music is its real topic. Music weaves a bond between first two people, and then a small group. And it's as if the music is completely guileless and unpretentious, like the people who are attracted to it, who like the people in 'Across the Universe' are really children of the Sixties though they're far too young to have been directly influenced by them. This is probably the most pleasurable movie I've ever seen, and I don't mind that I won't forget it anytime soon. It was good to have the captions on as the accents can be thick at times, but why aren't I surprised this film wasn't made in America?",9,2,4,20 December 2007
Crash," Too bad Spike Lee didn't make this film; it's the script he needed
","'Crash' is the movie Spike Lee should have made, but didn't. But Spike shouldn't feel defeated. Haggis is unusually gifted. He's up there with the best of them, and this is only his first directorial stint. What false notes there are in this movie make very little difference. The expression is eloquent and sharp as a scapel. But beware, this movie's points about racism and human nature are as powerful as any religious, political or academic ones you've ever heard. And since most people 'can't take the truth' to borrow a famous tag line, that's a problem. But if you can take in this particularly incisive version of the truth, there's no question you'd be better off if you did.A terrific movie and I can't wait to see his next.",9,1,10,8 May 2005
Pan's Labyrinth," Without a doubt the most potent foreign film I've seen in years
","If there's anything to complain about, it might be that the art direction is a little too dark, although this movie IS about the trials of a princess of the underworld. Otherwise, I can't help thinking that the little girl in 'Little Miss Sunshine' and the ubiquitous Dakota Fanning must both want to hide under a rock after watching Ivana Baquero as Ofelia. Between her and Sergi Lopez as the Capitan, this movie is a sheer performance delight.It's almost incomprehensible how much more than that the director managed to effortlessly pack into two hours. We learn all we need to know about Fascism and the Spanish Civil War with such story telling power that it's a little disconcerting. Add fully developed themes about the rigors of child birth and the demands of motherhood, how true nobility is related to moral and physical courage, and infuse it all with a wonderful sense of justice and you've got an unforgettable film of monumental beauty.I don't doubt some people will be put off by this film's moral sensibilities, but I also don't doubt there's no group more in need of this film than those people. And I sincerely hope teenagers get to see it. It might have the most impact on them. I don't agree at all with those who think it's too graphic in places.Bravo Guillermo del Toro! Scorcese may be long overdue, but this is a brilliant and almost unbelievable accomplishment!",10,4,8,5 February 2007
Sweeney Todd: The Demon Barber of Fleet Street," Wow! This movie's unbelievably good - and it's a musical!
","I hate musicals but this is the second I've been more than impressed by. There's one small flaw having to do with a minor surprise, but this is an unqualified masterpiece. Depp, Carter, Spall and Rickman are dead on and in full control. Even Cohen and the kid (not sure who that was) are great. This must have been something on Broadway but there's no way it was this good, not without this stellar cast. I couldn't believe the sets either. There's a great attempt to be authentic, and as far as I can tell, it all is, or at least it's quite convincing and appropriately evocative. I saw this on DVD last night and I'm quite sure it's going to prove unforgettable.",9,1,2,23 October 2008
Suicide Squad," Margot Robbie for President
","The last time a woman wowed me with her bravado was Daryl Hannah as Elle Driver in Kill Bill. Since then no one's even come close until Robbie who is spectacular as the crazed Harley Quinn. Though she's hardly a heroine here, I'd love to see her star in a spin off. Somehow her role gives me inexplicable joy and I was smiling thinking about her a long time after the film was over. What a pleasure! Restores my faith in women! Robbie is wild, gutsy, playful and unforgettable. And pretty much both quirky and gorgeous.Of the rest of the crew I enjoyed the Australian, played by James McGowan, and Joel Kinnaman as Rick Flag the most. The story is about their origin as a team. And considering how difficult it must be to bring a comic book to life, I can't help admiring this mostly successful effort.",9,4,8,9 August 2016
Life of Pi," I haven't been astounded since grade school, until now
","I bought the book when it was first being touted as a literary gem but then decided not to read it, so I have nothing to gauge how well Ang Lee did in interpreting the book. That said, this is one of the most endearing movies I've ever seen.My first thought having just seen it was, thank God some studio didn't get a hold of it first to do an American take on the book. This movie so deserves and demands its setting and foreign lead actors. I admit I probably would have enjoyed one of our better young leads in the role of Pi, but I'm much better off having grappled with the Indian chosen by Lee who, for some reason, populates this movie with everything from Mexicans, Indians, Japanese and Anglos to tigers, hyenas, orangutans and zebras, but not one Chinese person. I thought that a little odd but perhaps the books that way too.I saw the 2D version mainly because I was expecting some exploration of the god issue, but I was mostly disappointed in that. The talk of religion is very brief and not very interesting. What was interesting is the survival story and the boy's relationships with wild animals.I had no idea whether for the most part I was watching a real tiger or not. Let's just say that if Lee had to wait for the tiger to do everything he does in this movie, he by rights should still be out there filming. Someone with a real love for animals and an eye for their behavior clearly had a hand in making these scenes look real. And then there are the shots at sea. The sea rises in great swells and you would think Pi is actually in a lifeboat in the middle of the Pacific being carelessly tossed around by a violent storm; it's truly masterful, unprecedented filmmaking.Even my wife who is no friend to animals thought the movie went by quickly and was happy to have seen it.",9,4,8,2 December 2012
Doctor Strange," Occasionally exhilarating is much more than I expected
","I remember reading Dr Strange comic books when I was a kid. They seemed unusually daring back then, and this entertaining movie brings up vivid memories of the experience. You would think after all these years it would have been exceeded many times, but it hasn't. The idea of the metaphysical is still one we don't deal with convincingly; it continues to be scary and unreachable. And that makes the creation of the Dr Strange character even more impressive as it imagines us actually working at the nexus of our world and the other with nothing more than sheer imagination to guide us.Normally I'd bet no one had the imagination to do that well, but I'd be wrong. Apparently Steve Ditko, with the help of Stan Lee, did have the imagination in spades. The comic book and now this movie is a fun exploration of magical themes where a reluctant Dr Strange finds himself drafted into the fight. It takes him repeated efforts to learn how to excel in the dark arts but he proves a worthy student and it's an enjoyable journey.Benedict Cumberbatch is an excellent choice for the lead. And the supporting cast does their jobs well. With the possible exception of the recurring circle of sparks (a little underwhelming) all the special effects are top notch. Tilda Swinton who I've seen in person, is notable as the impossibly good-looking Ancient One who just happens to be as bald as a cue ball. I really can't imagine any other woman looking as natural and attractive as her without a wisp of hair on her head.All in all a good time at the movies. Oh and stay until the credits run out, there are a couple of last gasps you should see.",9,3,7,4 November 2016
Pacific Rim," Good, very well executed homage to Godzilla like monster films
","As much as I enjoy action, I have to say that the 5 most important roles here were perfectly cast; every one of them couldn't have been improved on. There's the fighter who lost his brother, the female Japanese orphan who wants revenge, the highly focused task force commander directing all operations and two high strung researchers running shotgun on the whole thing. These last two almost steal the show several times and that's amazing considering all that's going on.Charlie Hunman as Raleigh and Rinko Kikuchi as Mako had to make their mental and physical pairing look real (and plausible) to make it all work and they do. Probably for me the weakest part of the movie was the CGI which is state of the art and impressive, but still a little too artificial; it sometimes feels as if you're watching an animated comic book. But the ideas are big, different and fun to follow. What if we were attacked by giant creatures from another dimension? Could we cope? This really fanciful story must have seemed impossible to film at first blush and it's really very impressive that Guillermo Del Toro pulled it off with such apparent success.Definitely worth seeing for every young boy out there, especially, though my wife and I enjoyed it as well.",9,4,12,13 July 2013
American Sniper," Best to give cinematic credit when due
","This is a well crafted movie with strong performances by its leads, Bradley Cooper and Sienna Miller. But after having read some of the comments on it I have to wonder how accurate it is in terms of depicting Navy SEAL Chris Kyle himself. The trouble is if it isn't accurate it starts smelling like propaganda and a pointless whitewash. For example, as in Stalingrad, there is a kind of competition and duel between Kyle and an enemy sniper but supposedly that's not what really happened.Cooper is so deeply invested in the role you think it must be because he's honoring someone he admires. You never get the feel he was just doing it to get an award. I've heard the sniper was not that troubled about killing women and children who posed a threat to the troops he was watching over so I'm left wondering. I have to admit in the end I find the cold killer version of Chris Kyle more plausible than the driven but understanding guy shown in the movie. But I'll have to read much more than I have to feel certain about it.Still it's a very well made film. I particularly liked how beautifully put together the battle scenes were. The sound of the rounds hitting all around was just right, I think. I've heard nothing is as chaotic and ugly as real war so it's a gift to have it sorted out for you by an intelligent director with a camera. You do get the feeling a lot of surviving is pure luck.As between 'Fury' and 'American Sniper' both make you feel the tension of having to perform in a deadly situation though I'd give a small edge to 'Fury' though that's more directly a heroic tale. It's a little telling that director Eastwood found more paydirt in the battle scenes than in the sniper scenes. But being a sniper must not be that satisfying a job, I think, no matter how many lives you might save. And Miller and Cooper do a good job of depicting the strains on their marriage. I'm guessing it was those scenes that kept my wife happy as she usually hates war movies.",8,8,19,30 January 2015
Captain America: The First Avenger," One of the most miraculous movies I've ever seen
","I admire the look and feel of this movie almost as much as I marvel at its incomprehensible luck. The transformation of Steve Rogers from skinny Army reject to American champion is the best I've ever seen anywhere and could not have been made so successfully without these particular actors and today's technology. Someone up there clearly LOVES the people who made this film. If I were a filmmaker I'd despair at trying to play in this film's league, too much must have been sheer serendipity, or so I'd try to convince myself.This film's art direction is nearly perfect. But that's in addition to its other superb components from acting to story to photography to music. As most of the paid critics have mentioned, Chris Evans is particularly both enjoyable and indispensable. Even more than being an instant classic in every sense, I'm not sure I could ever trust anyone who didn't like this film.",Null,5,18,23 July 2011
Watchmen," Not my favorite movie - but way up there
","The opening credits are pure gold and probably the best ever, in my opinion. But it's a shame to have to say this as it means the rest of the movie isn't quite as spectacular. But it's still a level higher than anything else out there though light and breezy it's not. In fact in some ways it may be the darkest movie I've ever seen. Even darker than Sin City mostly because of the way Sin City was realized in black and white. This on the other hand is a real action movie for the most part. Only Billy Crudup's somewhat distracting but still quite well done Dr. Manhatten is always CGI though the action itself is often digitally enhanced. My favorite superheroes were The Comedian, Rorschach, and Ozymandias though Nite Owl II and Silver Spectre II were more endearing than I expected. In some ways these last two are the heart of the movie. They set the tone which is off beat and create the focal point. By its end I could see why this somewhat odd movie's underlying novel was so revered. It makes some points that few other films have made and for that I have to give it high marks.",9,2,6,9 March 2009
Baby Driver," Entertaining and even brilliant until the last 10 minutes or so
","Still, not to be missed. The director's hand is so assured and compelling that at times the movie seems head and shoulders above its many competitors. Some of the simplest scenes, where Baby and Debora are just flirting with each other are so well done, they seem miraculous. You will wonder, What kind of strange luck or ability would allow someone to get those scenes on screen? I can't think of anyone able to catch such fresh and candid banter before. And that's not even the main course.The main course is the hostility that Baby exposes himself to in the underworld he is forced to be part of. Jamie Foxx comes across as pure street as does Jon Hamm, both actors I don't associate with seasoned physical menace, but who deliver in spades. And then there's the driving which is fast and furious and made as entertaining as any other I've seen.Baby is a kind of Man With No Name figure but much younger and not prone to violence. Instead of being a dead shot he's an unflappable driver and there's nothing he'd rather do than get out of the life. My only complaint is that the storyline paints our hero into a corner and sort of fumbles a bit in its resolution, but that's after having kept us at full attention, very stylishly, for more than 90 minutes straight. No mean feat.",9,13,24,4 July 2017
Knowing," Even from the point of view of its craftsmanship, this is excellent work
","It's been hyped as a philosophical joyride, but I didn't find it much more than a wonderfully filmed and acted drama about the mounting dread caused by increasing fear for the world's survival. It builds so convincingly that you will be on the edge of your seat for its second half as if it were happening to you. And on top of this there are at least two over-the-top CGI sequences that are completely awe inspiring. In the trailer there's a train wreck being used to entice audiences, but that is not one of the two I refer to. The two I refer to are a complete joy to watch and if I were a filmmaker I would immediately find out who was in charge of them and I would try to hire that person away before he's put to work non-stop for the next ten years. Probably the second thing I'd like to do is contract the director for my next film. Long sequences are done with such care and skill that I was completely mesmerized. That's saying a lot as I've watched good films for about fifty years. Excellent work by all the stars as well. I really don't think Cage has ever worked with anyone as talented as Proyas. I'll bet he's anxious to join up with him again.",9,3,10,21 March 2009
Hugo," It's hard to fault this perfectly executed adventure fantasy
","The fact that Ben Kingsley doesn't overact here you would think is blessing enough, but even more impressive is the discovery of someone like Asa Butterfield who is a director's dream and undoubtedly a once in a lifetime find. If that wasn't enough, Sacha Baron Cohen gives a wonderful performance which, surprisingly, makes up for all the crude and gross shenanigans he's engaged in up til now. I'd feel good about recommending it on the strength of his performance alone. Still, this is pretty much a kid's movie with themes a kid should be able to understand and feel an affinity to. That it can charm adults as well is a real tribute to Scorsese's unassailable mastery of the medium. Scorsese probably thought that the story's eventual involvement with the birth of film gave him an excuse to pursue this children's story, but I was left wondering why he hasn't done even more in the same vein. I for one enjoyed this movie more than any of his previous films despite the subject matter or that it's a fantasy. Also it seemed odd to me given Scorsese's love of Italian themes that this movie is set in Paris, but it's a virtual love letter to a not too long ago Paris of steam engines and minimal conveniences.I even saw it in 3-D which I was resolved not to see unless absolutely necessary. Happily it was not the impediment it usually is.",9,3,5,4 January 2012
The Orphanage," Belén Rueda is the incomparable centerpiece of this elegant film
","I'm not familiar with this actress. I know more about the director who is first rate. But I found myself happily swimming in this woman's screen presence. She's older than most film heroines, but she must have moved mountains when she was younger. Now she's merely irresistible. Here she has to deal with an adopted child who suddenly takes off during a birthday party. Laura has moved back to the orphanage of her youth but it's not quite the idyllic retreat she thought it would be. She's married with child and more vulnerable than she realizes.The house and its environs are worth noting in their own right. They make your stay worthwhile for their style and classiness. But by far the best part of this movie is the lead actress who effortlessly runs through one harrowing incident after another, winning our affection throughout.",8,1,3,21 April 2010
Wanted," Can't say it didn't take me out of my humdrum existence for 2 hrs
","This is not a slapped together movie. It's carefully laid out and quite effective. Some of the scenes are spectacular and convincing, others a little less so, but, in general, it's easily worth the price of admission. James McAvoy doesn't seem the type to be dodging bullets but by the end of the movie, you're convinced. There's a little gratuitous sex in places, hardly the theme of the movie, but it spoils it for the younger crowd for no good reason, really. The detailed violence is not so gratuitous. But I liked the integrity of the movie, particularly in the training sequences. There's a nice sense of hard standards displayed that you don't often see anymore. Ms Jolie is not quite the show stopper she's been before, but she's still an enormously interesting woman who seems to have a taste for wickedness and vengeance, and who you don't want to take your eyes off of. Really, who else could you ask to do her part? Morgan Freeman always adds a little something real as does Terrence Stamp and both execute rather effortlessly. All in all entertaining but almost entirely on the male side of the spectrum.",8,0,3,30 June 2008
Salt," Nice performances all around but especially Angelina
","The first half of this film is particularly well shot and conceived, almost in the extreme. This director does what I enjoy the most and what some of the very best directors do, i.e. give you a visceral perspective on the very physical action. What's surprising is that Ms Jolie is up to delivering her part of the bargain because this is no Lara Croft excursion. It's far more suggestive of reality. Time and again women, and that goes double for beautiful women, have no real feel for violence. But Angelina definitely understands the role as conceived by Kurt Wimmer.Unfortunately, the film sags a bit in the second half and is more run of the mill there, though still very entertaining. Actually it's a good time to get a refill on that popcorn. But kudos to Angelina and the director especially, who do the genre proud. It's a fun time at the movies and Angelina is probably the first woman to successfully grab an action role from someone like Tom Cruise.",8,4,14,23 July 2010
Divergent," The New York Times review forced me to defend this film
","I did not read the book. But this movie makes me wish I had despite my not being in its target audience.First of all, Divergent is a far better film than I expected. If you must compare it to the Hunger Games franchise, I think it holds up quite well for the simple reason it is clearly the more intelligent of the two. The idea of splitting society into five factions is brilliant and more than a little suggestive of reality. The key idea, that those who don't conform are dangerous, is practically sacred scripture in our society and with our security people in particular.Second, the two leads are impeccable choices, Shailene Woodley and Theo James do a great job. Ms Woodley captures your interest and evokes more feeling than most actresses do in their entire careers. And Mr James moves as convincingly as a trained martial arts star and is easy to imagine as a leader.That said the first half is much better than the second where the movie devolves a bit into a much more run of the mill story. I can understand why it would given the demands of the market, but I was so pumped by the first half I was more than willing to forgive. It made me wonder what the novel was like especially when I read beforehand that the novel was written by a woman. I have never read anything written by a woman as unexpected as this movie's setup. The specific territory I'm referring to, paramilitary training, is almost never gotten even half right by women. There's a better understanding of it here than most men have especially because most men haven't seen military service. For once the female lead is not treated as some superwoman. Tris, the heroine, is knocked down and bloodied as a real woman would be and the focus on courage is something else I was glad to see properly addressed.For a teenage girl this is going to be a special event. I highly recommend it for them all, even if they haven't yet read the novel. As for everyone else, all I can say is I enjoyed it. And I know for me the name Veronica Roth, its author, is now one I'm not likely to ignore.",8,2,17,26 March 2014
The Lego Movie," Heart's in the right place but too frenetic
","What I found was that my mouth was dropping open fairly regularly as I marveled at the ingenuity on display here. If I were saddled with trying to use Legos to make a movie, I think I'd cry uncle in the first minute. The creators of this little exercise in excess not only met the challenge, they knocked it out of the park.Still, this movie was a little too quick and frenzied for my taste. I would have wallowed in the wacky world created a little more, simplified the plot a bit, even if it meant going with a shorter run time. My first thought getting out of the theater was, I'm glad there isn't another hour of it. And that's a shame because this movie was truly inspired.I particularly liked its anti-fascist politics. It was doubly enjoyable knowing some conservatives consider this film an attempt to indoctrinate their children. To me that's just icing on the cake, I couldn't agree more with its cause, but I don't really believe this movie is likely to influence many kids at all. Its position on freeing people's creativity isn't very radical, and the opposite position of making everyone follow rigid rules was not that well developed. But, then, how could it be without inducing a giant buzz kill?I would not advise skipping this movie but don't expect too much and you'll be better prepared. Just about everything in it is awesome!",7,5,10,11 March 2014
Enchanted," You'd have to be crazy to try, and yet, this film is a triumph
","Just got home from seeing this on a rainy night when the electricity went out 3 times during the showing, and yet, the movie still hit its mark! Unbelievable! Who in their right mind would try to make this movie? Actually, even more daunting, who would try to cast this thing? I remember being impressed by Amy Adams in the movie Junebug, but this is different, almost as if she's being asked to go higher and farther with the cheerful goodhearted woman thing than anyone has ever even tried to go. I've heard some say Amy's the new Julie Andrews, but really I think she quite surpasses Julie for the simple reason that her character here is so unreal, you can't help thinking the actors are running on sheer guts and imagination. I can't imagine this movie having been possible even a couple of years ago, they had to have been waiting for the appearance of Amy Adams especially.But the important thing is everyone in this movie does a magnificent job. From the director, to the animators, to the supporting cast members and song writers and choreographers. This is a genuine tour de force and a real triumph over the incredible unlikelihood of putting the pieces of this movie together. There were many children in the audience when I saw this this afternoon and, surprisingly, it seems to have worked quite well for them. I would have thought the storyline a little too pleasing to adults to be able to reach kids as well but they squirmed for about 2 minutes out of the entire flick.",9,2,2,2 December 2007
Inside Out," OK movie, but can't believe preteens will get it
","Some of the ideas in this movie smack of pop psychology which, though probably right, is stuff that you have to accumulate over years, but will kids get it? I doubt it. So a lot of this is really meant for adults, and it's mostly entertaining and even a bit intellectually provocative, but it isn't a game changer or even anything that can't wait for DVD with the one exception of those moving to a new home with a kid having to change their school. For them it might be very useful for all involved to ponder the points made in this clever movie but for most people it'll just be mildly entertaining.Despite all that the movie is getting rave reviews. I can only think people are unfamiliar with its ideas and appreciative of getting a new point of view. So if you've never heard of long term memory this might be the movie for you.",7,3,22,3 July 2015
Quantum of Solace," These carping critics need to do their goose steps elsewhere
","Can't believe how people are dumping on this reframing of the Bond legend. You'd think arrogant exceptionalism had seen its day, like the adolescent preoccupation with gadgets which I wouldn't have wanted to sit through again even for a night with the beautiful Olga Kurylenko.So what have we got here instead? Some thinly veiled jabs at the way foreign policy has been mishandled over the last 8 years, at least. Surely you boneheads realize the US has been pretty happy to see the takeover of water utilities in South America with the result that prices have skyrocketed for people who can barely afford food? And the idea that we're quite willing to see foreign (usually non-white) populations suffer under a dictator as long as we're better off, has hardly been a state secret over the years.Though the script tends to fudge a bit by throwing in the revenge factor, at least, for once, Bond is clearly on the side of the downtrodden. In fact he's in direct conflict with a group of well connected financial manipulators, quite intent on squeezing all the profit they can out of the less developed world. To see Bond take on these poseurs was worth the price of admission.Do I miss Bond the connoisseur? No. In fact, I much prefer someone who gets it on regardless, and who couldn't care less whether his martinis are shaken or stirred. The fight scenes are quite good and when someone gets killed, he looks dead, for a change. No, this isn't a Bond for those who've never ventured far without their parent's help. This is a Bond for those who've taken a risk now and then as a fiercely independent man, far too proud to have been compromised already.No, Daniel Craig may yet become my favorite Bond. He's taking the franchise away from fantasy, and I don't doubt that means he'll lose some fans, but he's going to gain a lot of respect instead, from men especially. It's funny how all the previous Bonds never had the guts to do the same.",9,2,8,17 November 2008
No Country for Old Men," What an accurate vision of the current West and some of its people!
","In terms of screen time, its probably Brolin, Bardem and then Jones, and they all deliver as if they never doubted their artistic choices for as much as a minute. Bardem probably comes away with the most mind-boggling performance. His 'psychopath' makes you wonder if he actually knew one. It's a little unnerving watching him intimidate people he encounters, but there's also something about him that convinces you, this man would survive. Josh Brolin and Tommy Lee Jones somehow share the true center of the film, giving it the heart and familiarity we need to get entangled with Bardem. Every minute each one spends on screen is like a gift. Both have such a feeling and understanding for the characters they play that it quickly becomes apparent that there will never be a remake of this film, as rich as it is in story and drama.I probably spent a couple years living out West, and, in my opinion, this wonderful film has pretty much distilled some of the more dicey parts of that experience to its essence. Brolin I especially recognize, and it was good fun to tag along beside his character as he makes choices few of us would have the guts to make. But the West is full of desperate people and there's no denying it.",9,2,6,23 November 2007
District 9," I bet some people wanted their money back
","But I pretty much loved it. It helps if you've caught some South African sci-fi previous, though it isn't absolutely necessary. I was impressed with 2 things in particular: That the aliens were as believable as they were and that the movie celebrates ordinary, stupid humans. On the negative side there's an awful lot of sordid filth (not sex, more like garbage) in this film. After a while you get used to it. And, incredibly, you get to feel for the aliens! Now THAT'S a trick! There's suspense and a love story and action. And the quality of the CGI is wonderful. Some of the machines are near perfect. But this isn't going to be everyone's idea of a great time at the movies. But if your people aren't either squeamish or closed minded, this is one of the best new takes on the whole alien thing you're going to find anywhere.",8,4,8,16 August 2009
The Favourite," Probably the most vividly affecting movie I've seen all year
","I'm not sure what I was expecting but it wasn't what I got which was better. I imagined a story about two women battling for a Queen's attention, and it is that, but it's also a portrait of women vying for power in a very unbridled way while the Queen is barely able to cope. Lesbianism is involved though not really graphically.The story is quite good though dark in the end. I'd hate to have to sort out who should be singled out for their acting. I'd have to proclaim cowardice and give it to the three female leads equally. Clearly Olivia Colman had the worst of it, her Queen Anne is not a very admirable woman, but Olivia gives her depth and breadth that is very impressive. Emma Stone has the most conventional role in that her character is engaged in a struggle against misfortune. But Ms. Stone has an unusual ability to make her roles seem somehow pure human nature and I was always a little happier whenever the camera focused on her.Rachel Weisz does her best work that I'm aware of. Her strength of character comes through very clearly and is really the center piece of the movie. There's no way it would have reached the heights it does without her and Nicholas Hoult who somehow make the 18th century come alive in a very engaging way.Not a movie for everyone, because of its hard imaginings, but a wonderful piece of work that is sure to garner an avalanche of awards despite its director's daring spirit. The skill in display is a very rare treat.",9,2,7,29 December 2018
Avengers: Infinity War," A lot better than I expected; I'd have to say it's the best of the genre
","I'd say about 7/8ths of this movie is topnotch and worth watching. It misses the mark a little near the middle of the second half, but not catastrophically. Altogether it's a uniquely imaginative and ambitious ride. The action is pretty much non-stop and each actor's contribution takes the whole production a little bit higher. I would not have thought this kind of group effort possible, but it's almost as if everyone in the production felt the need to give it their all. Kudos to the directors, Anthony and Joe Russo, who have never tackled such a large project before. They definitely have the sensibilities and eye to make a movie rock.If I had to rank the performances, I'd have to say Chris Hemsworth, Zoe Saldana, Benedict Cumberbatch, Josh Brolin and Chris Pratt were my personal favorites though I'd hate to do without any of the rest.",9,3,7,1 May 2018
Django Unchained," I sincerely hope Blacks understand how impressive this movie is
","The first two thirds of this movie, anyone should consider sheer movie magic. I was so amused and entertained by it that I kept fantasizing all of Hollywood being turned over to Quentin Tarantino, maybe the Hollywood sign replaced with Quentinville, or something. As an indication of its beauty, even now, I'm not sure who I would say was the best actor here. There's Don Johnson as Big Daddy in far too short of a scene, followed by Leonardo DiCaprio pulling out all the stops as Calvin Candie, followed by Samuel L. Jackson creating one of the most unforgettable characters I've ever seen, Stephen. And all the while Christoph Waltz and Jamie Foxx are the film's always interesting center.The first two thirds or so are brilliant beyond words, all to the credit of Quentin and his peerless taste and savvy. Yes, there is constant use of the N word, and the blacks in the audience when I saw this movie seemed a bit conflicted about what they were seeing, laughing nervously and a bit hesitantly. I think they should be unequivocally proud of how far blacks have come to be able to portray themselves as helpless and hopeless as they are for most of the movie.But then Django Unchained goes more in the direction of one of Tarantino's action movies and the moment is lost but hardly forgotten. Though I enjoy action and understand why Tarantino felt the need to not follow the first part of this movie to its logical conclusion, I was still a bit disappointed. Not enough to feel cheated, however, the first few acts are just too strong. I've never seen a better depiction of what plantation life must have been like.My only complaint is that I think Tarantino is not self-aware enough of his prodigious talent which is probably the most engaging of anyone making movies today, and that is saying a lot with so many great directors out there (Spielberg, Scott, Cameron, just to name a few). It just seemed he was mocking his vision a bit in a couple of places when he shouldn't have been. What's to mock when you've hit it out of the park?",9,0,4,5 January 2013
Drive," I didn't know what they meant when they said Gosling hit it out of the park
","But it doesn't take long to agree completely. I hadn't really enjoyed his roles until now. This one features a very low key guy most male viewers will admire as coming from the cool guy side of the movies. What's surprising is that Gosling gave no inkling, to me anyway, that he could handle or seem appropriate for this kind of role. And that makes the fact that someone did see it in him, almost as impressive as his performance. But enough of that. You'll form your own opinion, I'm sure. Let's just say you'll have fun doing so especially since this is not a role that tries for something that couldn't actually be.Another surprise for me was the direction in this film. I haven't seen this kind of treatment in a long time. It's reminiscent of spaghetti westerns but really it's its own style. I especially liked the sense of being in the main character's car and this director's sense of timing. All, like a spaghetti western, enhanced by well selected music.There's violence, more than I expected, but nothing that I can't believe could actually happen given the story. However, this might turn off female viewers in particular, as it did my wife's friend. And it's why the film is rated R.There are a couple of small points I could quibble about but I thoroughly enjoyed myself, so enough said.",9,2,5,1 October 2011
2012," There's nothing too wrong with this movie
","The question is, what's important if your world's coming to an end? Family comes to mind and the movie doesn't disagree. But this movie isn't really about answering that question; it's about having fun with the sheer spectacle of it. If it were really serious I'd immediately stage a protest for some of its politically correct answers. As it is it's easy to imagine yourself thinking some of these scenes through. It had to have been fun to do as many are wonderfully detailed and thought through. And that's where most of this movie's good times are. It's in the wildly lurid and imaginative scenes of mass destruction. All the leads and the supporting actors do quite well in selling the scenes and their reactions. But this is dessert and not a main meal.In our case, my wife and I decided to travel 45 minutes to get to the area's largest screen and best sound system. We made a day of it yesterday afternoon and were not disappointed. It's a bit goofy but mostly fun. Go see and buy some popcorn.",8,0,6,15 November 2009
X-Men: The Last Stand," To be entertaining, but not satisfying, is not a good thing
","This movie was a clear disappointment. I have this feeling that the Fantastic Four films are going to be more satisfying in the end. And speaking of 'The End' that's largely the problem here. After building up some suspense the payoff fizzles out, and if you're not particularly into action films it may give you a headache like it gave my wife. Were the original comic books that lame too? I don't know, but I have a sneaking suspicion that they were.I can't help carping on one point that REALLY irritates me. Famke Janssen is not showcased well in this flick. I'd much rather watch her as the center of attention in a positive and adoring way than her treatment here: she's almost abused in this one. I can't think of any other actress who seems to have all the lights on upstairs as clearly as Famke. I've never seen her in any film where I didn't want to see more of her than the film makers were willing to give me. Here she's on screen a lot, but not in a particularly positive way. I felt cheated and I wish someone would put her in the spotlight far more than she has been. As to the other players, Hugh Jackman does a great job. This guy has a feel for this part that is quite unusual, I think. There's no condescension in his interpretation. And that's true of the rest of the case as well. So the talent's there. What they need is a proper script.They've touted the philosophical question at the core of this film in the trailers. I was looking forward to a popular treatment of an important question with real implications, but I found the exploration of that question pretty superficial and unsatisfying. Clearly there will be great science fiction made around this question eventually, but this isn't it.",7,0,1,31 May 2006
The Lives of Others," Probably the most exquisite movie I've seen this year, at least
","At one point I thought I wouldn't be able to watch this movie to the end. What was depicted seemed to be inching into unbearable territory. If you react in the same way, continue on, the director does not slip into sadism, and, if you leave, you will have missed one of the best films I've ever seen. It's not that it inspires, or amazes, or dazzles with new ideas or incredible vistas, but, rather, it's because it makes East Germany and the Stasi (their secret police) accessible to us Western xenophobes in a way that even we will understand. And that's important, because there's no doubt in my mind, that is probably the direction this country is moving.The story is about surveillance before the fall of the Berlin Wall of a talented and charismatic playwright and author, and his beautiful actress, girlfriend. Every scene is believable, and all the actors are superb. And the subject matter though dark is engrossing and quite relevant given our infatuation with Homeland Security. I loved the economy of the film. I can't think of a single scene I'd want to cut though the film is more than 2 hours long. It's a very, very rewarding 2 hours.This movie was made with loving care and an abundance of talent, and I wouldn't hesitate to recommend it to the most critical of moviegoers. It would be a tragedy if it played to only a small audience. It's sad that that's probably its destiny. It deserves much better. I'd love to see more depictions of what communism was really like from this director, and maybe even one showing it in a relatively positive light, if it could get past our censors.",9,1,2,15 September 2007
Across the Universe," For someone who hates musicals - I'm completely agape
","If I had anything to do with the musical Hair, I would now shoot myself. There's no comparison. Unlike Hair this is the real deal. Sure there are a couple of rough spots, but, in general, no one, not even the Beatles themselves, have put together such a loving tribute to their music. And I really, really hate musicals. I only went on the strength of Roger Ebert's review. He said he saw it at the Toronto Film Festival, and that, despite his heavy schedule, he had to see it twice! He was right.I was a young man in the 60s and 70s and this film very deftly brings out the core spirit of the times amongst those who were enjoying the alternative lifestyle. Nevertheless, I would have made a couple of changes in this film. For example, I would have made the cops more cruel, and I would have had Vietnam veterans be far more ruined and lost by their experiences. But as far as the most lyrical and emotional aspects of the times, this movie has it down perfectly. High praise to Jim Sturgess and Joe Anderson especially. Evan Rachel Wood is also very good, but somehow, not really of the period for me though you often don't mind. For me, the picture hangs on the two male leads, Sturgess and Anderson, with Sturgess carrying most of the burden. Others are quite good too, and it's clear that the director, Taymor (who I will now follow no matter what her next project might be) got high quality performances from all.Probably the best part of the movie is the way they managed to make the Beatles' songs relevant to their storyline. The interpretations are brilliant, and I only wish they had done more along that line. That's no doubt the work of those who wrote the screenplay. But whoever is to be blamed, it's completely mesmerizing. I have never seen a musical I really like, except this one, and I am at a total loss to know whether I will ever like another one, but my guess is no. It's just too unlikely a combination of charismatic people, great music, and captivating ideas. There are some serious short-comings, like an almost complete lack of Hispanics, but I was somewhat quelled by the movie's credits which had a more representative smattering of them listed. I just can't let that ruin the experience of this film which is probably the most memorable and delightful 2 hours plus I've ever had in a theater. The only people I could believe wouldn't love this film is -- Dick Cheney and his ilk.",9,3,8,1 October 2007
Kick-Ass," Can't fault this flick - it's heart is more than admirable
","This is a crowd pleaser set in New England where the sometimes over-the- top action is populated with the kind of characters any great story needs. Haven't we all wanted to don a cape and mask and even the score? This amounts to a pleasant dream exploring the notion.I'd heard a lot of grumbling about Hit Girl especially, but focusing on that part of this little tour de force is truly a mistake. This movie is a rousing ode to the sheer pleasure to be gained from stamping out bad people. Apparently most people don't understand Hit Girl's fairly obvious function here, she allows the whole exercise to seem lighter than air by putting a smile on our face and reassuring us they're not serious about wanting us to take matters in our own hands. It's way too dangerous and we've been made nearly useless from our sedentary lives.Hit Girl's a delightful masterstroke and if Chloe Moretz were my kid I wouldn't have the least problem letting her take the role. After all, how many kids could have pulled it off as well.But Aaron Johnson, the Kick Ass, is no afterthought either. He's completely believable and likable as the overly optimistic teenager. We ache to see him get in a few licks.",9,2,11,6 May 2010
Unknown," Not a bad action/drama - a good time at the movies
","It's one thing to be told not to think too hard about what you're about to see, it's another to be helped enormously in that task by a skilled director employing equally skilled actors. All the principals here are in top notch form and, though I enjoy trying to measure how much license was taken by a screenplay, this film never once made me feel cheated or resentful.Is it a brilliant film? Probably not, but it's devilishly entertaining. The action scenes here are matched by the quiet drama scenes and that's unusual. I don't really think either sex can really claim it entirely.The director's done a very good job of creating the right mood and telling the story in such a way that the actors can do their work, unimpeded by unrealistic run ups to their scenes. This movie made me feel as if I've just visited Berlin much more effectively than any other European based movie I can think of and that alone is worth the price of admission.",9,133,201,18 February 2011
Gran Torino," Couldn't wait (after being hospitalized) to see Clint back in action
","There's really no one on Clint Eastwood's level in Hollywood. As I watched this film gently unfold I was reminded just how much authority this actor has with my generation. And he uses it both sparingly and well. Here he is the crusty old ex-soldier, seeing his neighborhood change ethnicity, feeling himself getting increasingly isolated amongst the 'gooks' and 'fishheads'. His own sons are no solace in his old age. They're only interest seems to be in divvying up his belongings when he's gone. Otherwise they're strangers to him though he realizes that's not entirely their fault. He never really knew how to do the father thing. He's got an excuse of sorts, he's still haunted by faces he saw in their death throes back in Korea. But then his distaste for injustice and gangs kicks in as one of his neighbors is put in danger. And things start to move toward what should have seemed an inevitable end, if we had been paying close attention.Eastwood is masterfully effective in this little film. You really wouldn't want anyone but him either directing or starring in it. Everyone else involved more than pulls their weight, almost as if they realized they would probably never have another chance to join in creating a little masterpiece with one of the most indelibly brilliant stars of any era.",9,1,5,2 March 2009
The Curious Case of Benjamin Button," After watcing the Golden Globes I'm compelled to object!
","Fincher and Pitt and should have been accorded a great deal more acclaim than they were. This is an impossible, illogical premise and story, and yet they made it into something poignant and entertaining. Its extra length zipped by effortlessly. My only quibble is that the reverse aging was sometimes somewhat distracting and therefore not quite successful. And then there's Ms Blanchett's performance. Somehow after successfully traversing most of the script, she manages to overdo her part in some inexplicable way. It broke up the flow of the piece and I found myself annoyed with someone I usually love to watch and wonder about. Pitt, however, did a magnificent job, I thought. He was this little man as convincingly as any character actor has ever inhabited someone as far removed from themselves as Benjamin is from the real Pitt.",9,1,4,11 January 2009
Lincoln," Never had a convincing image of the living Lincoln in my head until now
","I moved to central Illinois, where Lincoln road the judicial circuit, almost 30 years ago. I've been to most of the historical sites and read a fair amount of what Lincoln wrote over the years, much of it impressive and intriguing. What could the real man have been like? Few of those currently in prominence here have even faintly suggest his greatness, so living here is really of little help. The climate is pleasant though we still occasionally experience some mighty winter storms. Crops grow very well but the land is too flat for most. Could any of that have contributed to his unique character?I've always had trouble imagining Lincoln making his rounds, taking my neighbor's ancestors as clients. I was sure I would die never knowing anything like the truth; for some reason we would forever be denied knowing the man.I was wrong. Daniel Day-Lewis has somehow managed to bring the man to life, even for me, an admirer with a demanding attitude about any such portrayal. To be sure, he doesn't do it alone. Spielberg has recreated the period with economy and true artistry. The script is unflinchingly intelligent and many of the supporting actors give some of their best performances, ever. It's not perfect, however. I could quibble about two of Spielberg's (I presume) choices in particular, but those perceived errors pale in comparison to the whole of his achievement. It's magnificent and deserving of far more patronage than indicated by its gross receipts.At its end I was amazed at how quickly it all went by; this is not that easy a movie to absorb. And yet I never once felt it getting tedious or overbearing. In short, I would have to concede, there's no question this is the year's best movie.",9,3,9,18 November 2012
Children of Men," 2027 is realized in a way no one could call implausible
","And that is truly impressive. My sole reason for avoiding this film until it came out in DVD was that I assumed it would all be burnt out buildings and unrealistic gun play. The burnt out buildings are there, but shot in an almost lyrical way that makes them seem as though they could be home. And that's not the only cinematic magic conjured up. Alfonso Cuaron and friends are flexing their artistic skills like confident masters. Clive Owen is perfect, and so is Michael Caine. It's amazing how powerfully they can bring you into the story. The gun play, and particularly the sound of bullets thudding into walls, is very much like the real thing. And the emotions and reactions of those around the protagonists are impossibly evocative of being there in a world despairing of its lack of children. Their reaction to the first pregnancy in 18 years seems so much more insightful than what I visualized. And throughout Cuaron is careful to notice those little things that evoke the sensual familiarity of the scene like being in a rowboat on the ocean, or walking around in flip flops. I'm betting everyone involved in this movie's production is quite rightly proud of it. Well done!",9,3,6,30 March 2007
Million Dollar Baby," Nothing But Raw Emotions Could Have Painted This Story
","You will go away thinking these particular lead actors could have hit your reset button, and there would have been nothing you could do about it. Eastwood and Freeman give no quarter. Swank is unspeakably in the moment. In smaller parts, Jay Baruchel as 'Danger Barch' and Lucia Rijker as 'Billie 'The Blue Bear'' are both heroic in total synch with this equally go-for-broke work.When I first heard of this movie I was ready to complain that Eastwood hadn't cast a Latino as lead. What an obvious opportunity missed! A few seconds later I realized: I can't grumble about Eastwood, he's way too high on my, and so many other people's, list. I would see the movie and not say a word. Now, after seeing this movie, I realize I would have never lived my rash remarks down.One day, hopefully many years from now, Eastwood will die, and I am quite sure his funeral procession will be the biggest thing to ever hit Hollywood. This guy has done more for the movie industry than any dozen movie moguls. We're really very lucky. Go see his latest effort and tell me I'm wrong.",Null,1,2,6 February 2005
The Imitation Game," The Imitation Game is a lesson in back-of-the-line warfare
","First, I'd have to say this is probably the only picture I've seen recently that was more than worth the price of admission. Second, there were two aspects of it that demand positive comment and one final one that though negative and not so important, is best mentioned briefly.The first impressive thing about this movie is its beautiful construction and execution. Just as an exercise in movie-making it's a wonderful example of people with skill taking their craft seriously. The second impressive thing was the acting by Benedict Cumberbatch which if contrasted with his Sherlock Holmes on TV and his turn as Kahn in the last Star Trek movie is absolutely an unparalleled achievement in his art. What really got me was that several times I looked in his eyes on screen and could have sworn I must be seeing the real Alan Turing. This guy is the closest thing to a shoo in for the Oscar as any I've ever seen.One quibble, which I do not advocate anyone let keep them from this beautiful movie is, I'm pretty sure they've played fast and loose with the true story. But there's no denying they've done it for a good cause.",9,4,10,10 January 2015
Logan," Masterful and emotionally impressive tour de force
","What a beautifully crafted movie! There's no ignoring this James Mangold, the director and the man with the story idea. I appreciate the way each scene made meticulous sense. It makes watching so much more engaging and rewarding when you can follow each event and never doubt, given the premise, that it could have happened that way.Hugh Jackman and Patrick Stewart are both in fine form. Each in his own way make the story work at a refined level for which they deserve A list pay. Supporting their work are several others, including a newcomer in the role of Wolverine's 'daughter', all of whom manage to not only break the spell, but actually add to the story's impact.By far the most critical casting was of Laura, Wolverine's genetically enhanced offspring, of sorts. They had to find someone who could pull off the physically demanding role, and if I were Mangold, it would have been job one. It's miraculous that they found Dafne Keen who has no trouble getting what the movie is about. She does a wonderful job and I'd love to see her again.",9,1,4,3 March 2017
The Dark Knight," Mr Bale is being short-changed though Mr Ledger is UNFORGETTABLE
","As far as I'm concerned Heath Ledger's performance is probably the best performance by any screen actor in the last decade. I've no idea where he drew the inspiration from but it's almost beyond belief. But Christian Bale is being shortchanged. His work cannot be denied. There have been several to attempt to make Batman seem real or awe-inspiring but only Christian really succeeds. He's taken a comic book concept and breathed real depth and character into it far more successfully than any other live action lead ever has. He really deserves a huge amount of the credit and I can imagine his role in Dark Knight was cut back after Heath's death. That was an error if I'm right. I'm quite sure someone as phenomenal as Heath would have wanted Christian to shine as much as possible.This is hardly a perfect film but it's satisfying on several levels. Some of the more spectacular parts are the lead actors performances, but also some of the effects like those with Aaron Eckhart and some of the crash scenes are sheer magic. I would have liked a few changes but I'm just quibbling. If I were a filmmaker I'd be lucky to achieve a tenth of what's on the screen here. There's so much skill in evidence here you can't help wondering what these people could do with REAL problems.",9,3,8,23 July 2008
Blood Diamond," Leonardo shows how to lose oneself in a role
","I've always seemed to only tolerate Leonardo DiCaprio, but not this time. I've been taught a lesson. He is superb in this movie. Though Djimon Honsou is probably as good, it's Leonardo who carries the film with a portrayal that should forever dispel any notions that he is merely a 'star'. I didn't see Forest Whitaker in 'The Last King of Scotland' but of those performances I did see, I can't believe Leonardo didn't win Best Actor for this picture, though the picture itself is somewhat hard to swallow in places. Still the subject matter is so foreign to us that it has to be given high marks for making it all so much more accessible.Jennifer Connelly once again somehow satisfies my male eyes and ears almost as if I were defenseless against her. I'm beginning to think I am. And the film moves along at a good clip with little or no pauses to wallow in. These movie makers have a good understanding of what war is like and they full advantage of their opportunities.",8,0,0,20 March 2007
Elysium," Loved this film and I'll be following Blomkamp from now on
","Can't tell you how great it is to see someone capable of filling Ridley Scott's and James Cameron's shoes! Blomkamp has made the best movie yet this year. I was intrigued by District 9. It made me think, but this self-assured and skillfully crafted effort is taking his game to a much higher level.It's been a long time since I was in awe of both the script and the direction. To see they both came from one guy, Neill Blomkamp, is wonderful if a little unnerving. Do we really have to rely on foreigners for biting social commentary?This film is much more clever than most reviewers are letting on. One reviewer said it's a bit melodramatic, but, frankly, I don't see a subtle treatment getting to first base with most Americans. This puts a lot of troubling issues in sharp relief in an artful, very watchable format whereas most of the arguments about immigration, healthcare and the rich versus the poor are in dense, boring prose.I was warned that Jodie Foster's performance was marred by odd accents, but I barely noticed. I thought she depicted a kind of sharp edged conservative that should be readily recognizable. Sharlto Copley is great as a vicious soldier and Matt Damon is the likable center of the film, as called for. The supporting actors including Braga, Luna and Fichtner, to name a few, all add much to the whole enterprise.This is definitely a go see and I wouldn't hesitate recommending it to anyone, including pre-teens and up.",10,149,297,10 August 2013
Alice in Wonderland," I would agree with two of the negative reviews I've read
","Ebert says the ending is hollow and far below the level of its preceding scenes. He's right, but I wasn't as upset about it as he was. It's a convention to end a movie that way and though it was definitely an opportunity to do much better, it's familiar and a fairly good way to back out of a pleasant experience.And then there's Disenchanted's barb stating that Burton may be a better set designer than director. He may be right as the sets are very, very good while the movie has rather obvious flaws. Still I was more often caught up in this Burton film than I have in any of his others. I think he's reached a new level as a director, achieving something quite difficult to capture, a dream-like quality as a child would have experienced it. That's not bad.I enjoyed Depp's and Bonham-Carter's performances the most though I was quite happy with Mia Wasikowska's as well. She has a wonderfully light touch that I found easy to accept as lead, even as an young English maiden. There's something about her that makes her an ideal guide and though Burton shows much more intense vision in this film than in his others, she's especially integral to it and the movie would have suffered greatly without her.All in all a good movie, with many brilliant parts.",8,1,6,7 March 2010
The World's Fastest Indian," Anthony Hopkins finally earns his reputation, IMO
","Anthony Hopkins has always been bestowed with an air of super respectability that I always found a little hard to swallow. I understand that men who can portray men of character, responsibility and integrity are important to the cinema, but why choose yet another Britisheer to carry the banner? Isn't it about time we chose someone out of the UK? There are such men though I don't doubt they'll be kept as far away from the limelight as they can.I'd always thought there was something slightly wrong with Hopkins in the Zorro movies. He just doesn't seem athletic enough though otherwise he seems a clever choice. But in this movie, I was so taken with Mr. Hopkins' ability to breathe a unique life into the role of Burt Munro that I immediately wondered why I hadn't seen this level of dazzling brilliance before. Could it be that Mr. Hopkins is only recently in his prime? I don't really know but I do know I wouldn't hesitate recommending this wonderful movie to anyone -- man, woman and child. I know the type in real life. Someone capable of tinkering away in his garage making something beautiful out of an old heap. Such people exist and deserve to be immortalized in their own right. But this is also a movie about a man with an indomitably sunny disposition who somehow manages to have his way in a world usually obsessed with exclusion and propriety. We can only hope that the real Burt Munro was as winning a fellow as Mr. Hopkins portrays because I'd hate to think he didn't deserve this very effecting homage.",9,0,1,10 July 2006
Avatar," So you think you're hot stuff? Watch this movie and be humbled
","My first thought was, the 3-D isn't as good as I was led to believe, but then something straightened out. I'm not sure whether it was my brain or the screen, but either way the problem cleared up fairly quickly. (Though pretty entertaining I don't think the movie is going to suffer much from begin watched in 2-D.) My second thought was, everyone who fancies himself a little above average or more in intelligence should be forced to watch this film. If you're right, you will come away convinced you've been touched by the work of someone far more intelligent than you. If you don't feel that way, you're initial assumption was clearly wrong.This film is not miraculous in an off-putting sort of way. It is geared to reach the average American mind. The thing is, I remember having similar sentiments as this film, years ago, and I would have bet anything that getting ordinary Joes to sympathize with its point of view was an exercise in sheer futility. That to me is the real mark of genius in this film, that James Cameron was able to make it so that no one is likely to escape being confronted with its message, though whether they believe it or not, I can't say. The whole of my own belief about this country's foreign policy to date is stated fairly simply in a very few words. It begins with: 'We want something someone else has...' There's no doubt in my mind many won't care, but this film will stir the optimism of the rest of us about there being sufficient numbers of those who do care to make a difference.Everyone in this film does an exemplary job. There's a slight skip of a beat in the middle but, if it hadn't been there, I might very well have stumbled out of the theater totally disoriented, unable to snap back into my humdrum life.What a stunning accomplishment!",9,10,17,20 December 2009
Grindhouse," Rose McGowan was the only bright spot, for me
","This was a huge disappointment. I like Freddy Rodriguez but he seemed miscast and that caused the whole first segment to sputter in the wrong places. I did enjoy Marley Shelton's and Josh Brolin's performances as a married couple of doctors. And Kurt Russell was appropriately seedy and demented and a good foil for Sydney Tamiia Poitier's Jungle Julia. But the best part, for me, was Rose McGowan's Cherry Darling. What an impossibly gorgeous creature this woman is! And that she was willing to take this part makes me wonder what she's like in person. No way she's dull, as I just assumed she had to be to be in that 'Charmed' TV series.There are good and original and evocative parts of this movie, I particularly liked the well understood Texas flavor of 'Planet Terror', but they're not enough to justify sitting there for 3 hours, in my opinion. There's a nice quality to 'Death Proof' but it's mostly in the girl talk which has limited appeal for guys. And who would dare promise a lap dance from Jungle Julia and then renege on the deal?",6,2,5,17 April 2007
La La Land," OK, I hate all musicals,,, except this one, dammit!
","Never been moved much by musicals though I've always admired those of Fred Astaire. But this movie is not some glitzy re-humanization of being rich during The Depression. It's actually almost the opposite, a musical centered on the little people striving to succeed while enduring the ups and downs of relationships and two branches of the entertainment business, one an actress, the other a jazz pianist.Thing is the two leads here, Emma Stone and Ryan Gosling, are not easy to picture in a romantic musical. But, without a doubt, they're an inspired choice who will make you wonder, just how much talent is there in Hollywood? It's mind-boggling to contemplate. What's more, these two fine actors are so evenly matched here that it's impossible to tell which came first, the pairing or the script. Clearly they had an uncanny grasp of the form though it's been years since there's been such a successful one.This movie so deftly navigates all sorts of truth about so many elusive things that it's not worth picking a few. Just go see it, even if you don't like musicals. It will win you over.",10,8,16,8 January 2017
Up," I was surprised 'Up' wasn't better though it's great anyway
","The problem is the storyline. Love parts of it, like the review of the old man's past life, and the tie-in to what he finds in South America. But some of the contrivances are as annoying as they are helpful, for example, the device that lets dogs talk. And then there's the way the floating house seems to drag the action down in places. Still, the many little quirks of an old man embodied in Mr Fredricksen's figure are pretty much breathtaking as is those of a young boy embodied in Russell. Ellie is fleshed out as a character so quickly and assuredly that I was flummoxed trying to imagine what kind of a team could have produced her. But then most of the art work is completely awe-inspiring and entrancing. (I found the bird Kevin to be disappointing, though.) I guess I would have made the story a little less wild, these films deserve to be instant classics, and I can't help feeling some of the more wild parts are going to hold it back. By the way the opening cartoon about storks delivering babies was a complete pleasant surprise and a clear indication of the level of genius at Pixar. I'm guessing they wanted us to practice dropping our mouths open.",8,0,1,15 June 2009
Snowden," Obama should have pardoned Snowden on our behalf
","I'm so sorry I didn't make the time to see it while it was playing in theaters. I suppose I shied away from being any more jacked up about our intelligence communities than I already was. But now with the election behind us and with the possibility of Snowden being pardoned having just passed, I could summon up the courage to see a work of political art that might send me into a deep depression.I'm not depressed having seen it now, but I am incensed. Perhaps there's been some poetic license taken but I've no doubt it's minor and beside the point. The argument is well made that Washington has gone too far and that Snowden's acts were more than warranted. The best analogy I can think of for the core issue is a father wanting to keep his daughter safe by locking her in her room. Does it work? Yes. But should any red- blooded American girl allow it? No. It's tantamount to a denial of her fundamental right to a life of her own making. Oliver Stone has given expression to the millions of progressives who have applauded the supposedly treasonous acts of Edward Snowden and in a lot of ways this is his greatest career accomplishment yet.As a movie, the first half is fairly miraculous given the technical nature of the action. Nevertheless, what is going on is made elegantly and unmistakably clear by a score of brilliantly constructed scenes. And every established actor, and there are quite a few, seems further elevated by their inclusion in this politically risky, but near heroic, work. The second half is less impressive, but that's mostly because of the real-life, mindless acts of our elected and appointed officials.If there's a bad side to all this, it does shed an unfavorable, but accurate, light on Obama's administration, and there's little appetite for that given our recent election.",9,6,11,22 January 2017
Sicario," One of the most artfully realized movies I've ever seen
","About an hour into this film, I smiled to myself thinking these three excellent actors, Josh Brolin, Emily Blunt and Benicio Del Toro, must have realized as they were shooting what a beautiful collaboration they were in. Seldom are actors allowed to contribute so evenly to the success of a project as here. Emily leads the audience on with a simplified, legalistic approach to drug enforcement, Josh Brolin has a more violent and almost clinical solution in mind, while Benicio's very Mexican attitude toward the murderous cartels plaguing his country tends to supersede the others. Essentially the story is that of letting Emily's character be shaken to the core by its head on confrontation with Benicio's idea of dealing with drug kingpins.Since there's virtually no heed given to political correctness, there's a difficult case to make. Very probably most of the audience will be on Emily's side, but the film is very emotional and pointedly directed, and I doubt if many of those aren't at least moved by it.Benicio gives his best performance ever, in my opinion, as the sort of person he is depicting is very real but rarely seen in the states. I was personally amazed at how well his portrayal captured people I'd forgotten I'd ever known. He really deserves some recognition for it though I doubt he will get it, only because the Academy will probably not realize he is portraying someone who can actually exist in Mexico.Emily Blunt's character was a little more problematic. Much of her attitude toward the task force she joins is difficult to understand. It still works but I couldn't follow her complaints very well. No doubt someone along the line decided it didn't matter, and they were right. She is still the center of attention and she holds it very well.Josh Brolin had the more stereotypical role here, but he still managed to imbue it with detail and attitude that seem to show his familiarity with task forces, but is almost certainly completely craft and talent.The two most important names behind this film were definitely the director and writer. At this point I will watch anything Denis Villeneuve does. I'm also going to have to watch what this Taylor Sheridan writes from now on. They're a very impressive pair.",9,0,4,22 October 2015
The Descent," The first movie to convince me that women can go full-tilt into action
","The six women in this film are so believable in their roles that I was completely drawn into the story. For me, that's the most impressive thing about this cautionary tale. Very few actresses seem to have any affinity to real adventure. Starbuck in 'Battlestar Galactica' is one of those exceptions. But somehow this movie's producers managed to get together a terrific group of very watchable, and completely genuine, women friends so that an action junkie like me actually felt that the movie was better off being all female. I'm not sure why, but I'm very surprised.Next in impressiveness would be the direction which somehow conveyed the experience of being in a cave so well that I was reminded of long ago experiences I hadn't thought of in a long time. If you've ever been alone in a cave, you'll find this movie dead on and extremely skilled in taking you back. There's a very refined sense of horror that I appreciated a great deal. This is no-holds-barred film making at its best and for my money deserved far more recognition all the way around than it got. I'm looking forward to Neil Marshall's next directorial outing 'Doomsday'.",9,1,3,6 February 2007
Inside Man," This is a far better film than the critics led me to believe
","I saw this film last week and except for a minor quibble that I'll describe later, I've been thinking about what a travesty it was it wasn't highly praised during its theatrical release. Bank robbery is an old topic in the movies and the stories have been told from almost every perspective, but Spike Lee's treatment here seems new and fresh. There's a little bit of disappointment in store for you near the end but by then, for me at least, Mr. Lee had earned the benefit of the doubt. I particularly loved his capture of every element of the crime. There are no leaps ahead in the narrative that require you to puzzle what was left out. Foster, Plummer, Owen and Washington all show why they're paid the big bucks. They all bring depth of character and easy believability to their roles without making their characters worn out reruns.I don't doubt Russell Gewirtz deserves a lot of the credit for his screenplay, but Lee was right there with the goods to make it shine. For my money this is Lee's most entertaining film and though there was an annoying repetitive reference to an Hispanic police officer who mostly was a disembodied voice through much of the movie, I probably wouldn't have noticed it if I hadn't had the subtitles for the hearing impaired on. (I don't appreciate missing clues.) This is a wonderful film and I hope Spike is willing to explore another highly commercial movie in the future. It's easy to see why he managed to assemble such a stellar cast.",9,1,2,26 August 2006
Jack Reacher," You can see the book is a great read in this very enjoyable movie
","I've heard the grousing from those who had read the book first, and all I can say is, I'm glad I didn't. Unfortunately for them, that doesn't reduce my enjoyment of this film. I experienced it as a very enjoyable film gently advocating a certain philosophy of justice. No, really, to my mind this is a gentle argument despite the violence in it. The idea that Jack Reacher is not one to let the bad guys play the system is not immediately apparent. What you first see is an extraordinarily observant and highly skilled investigator. It's only after a series of perilous events that his intolerance for poor organizational outcomes is revealed. While we're contemplating outcomes, check out the villain's management techniques when Werner Herzog, as Zec, has to discipline one of his henchmen. It's truly one of the most memorable cameos I've ever seen. My wife who is hardly the violent sort enjoyed every minute of this movie which makes me think there are no real gender issues here.I very much appreciate getting the best ideas of a good novel without having to trudge through the wordy details. (I don't enjoy reading fiction much. I'd much rather see it on the screen, interpreted in a fulsome and honest way as here.) Cruise plays Reacher to the hilt though I understand that physically he doesn't really make you think of the book's Jack. That doesn't really matter as Cruise is fully in tune with the book's message and delivers it passionately. I can only hope this movie leads to a franchise for him as I'll certainly see it on the big screen next time ahead of its DVD release.",9,4,9,7 May 2013
Zero Dark Thirty," Despite all the bad publicity and the grousing, I thought this was brilliant filmmaking
","I resisted seeing this film for several political reasons. In particular I thought it would be a smear campaign and the worst kind of one-sided propaganda. But despite all the 'mistakes' pointed out in the IMDb, most of which I am not capable of picking up on not being from the Middle East, I was very impressed. As filmmaking, it's hard to fault on almost any level.Surprisingly, Chastain is not glamorized or even unduly prettified in this film. I didn't expect that at all. Instead she comes across as the hard-working girl next door. And the Pakistanis and Taliban, or Al Qaeda, are not unduly demonized either. Instead they seem more like real people you can actually believe exist, though I imagine the real parties would be far more exacting in their verbal assaults.Though I didn't particularly like The Hurt Locker, I do like this film and have to admit that Bigelow shows enormous talent in putting this story on the screen. You would not think she would have as savvy an understanding of this subject matter as she does, being a woman. I might have desired a few small changes, having been in the military, but have no problem recommending her take.",8,3,6,30 March 2013
Crazy Heart," How an old-fashioned has-been story made me absolutely flip
","If you don't see why Jeff Bridges won the Best Actor award within the first 5 minutes, you obviously don't know great acting when you see it. I really can't see anyone being more convincing; it's mind-boggling, especially when you consider he sings his own songs! And then there's Maggie Gyllenhaal playing the single mom. I'm not sure anyone else could have done her part either. These two are transported into the story as if they wanted to live it on screen.I really don't remember seeing a better realized script. The direction and writing by Scott Cooper is superlative. It appears he's mostly acted before this. But this is so unlikely a resounding triumph, I can't imagine anyone denying this guy more work as a director.I resisted seeing this because I thought it would be a drag. Now I'm sorry I didn't see it when it was playing the theaters.",9,0,0,14 August 2010
Nick and Norah's Infinite Playlist," Fun until there's a tremendous buzzkill
","The heroine played by Kat Dennings is worth spending time with. She's gorgeous and likable. And Michael Cera's got a nice presence, but considering these are high schoolers running around night clubs, I kept thinking about the Polanski debacle. The buzzkill was in the gratuitous mention of a religion in a movie that didn't need it. The movie is about how high school relationships change overnight in an urban environment devoid of adult supervision and cops. This takes place in a sort of idealized playland where the only real troubles are of the love connection kind. There's a funny recurring bit about an almost all gay band and some more gay scenes later on, but it's mostly the Nick meets Norah saga. Everybody will be familiar with many of the characters some done very well, like the evil heart-breaker, Dev.",6,0,0,4 November 2009
Edge of Tomorrow," I came, I saw, I got my money's worth. What else is there?
","This is a tricky premise. How to shoot a movie where a lot of the action is repetition? First, get two excellent actors as leads. Second, don't scrimp on the CGI or the artistic vision. And, lastly, get good writers involved.I'd have to say that each of these, in order, was progressively less successful but still far better than most. The movie was especially memorable for its acting. Both Cruise and Blunt are in fine form. Blunt who I hadn't really noticed that much in other movies, definitely got my attention and admiration this time. The woman clearly understood all of the plot's ramifications and was every bit the committed soldier the story required. It was oddly moving to see. Most women don't really seem to understand what combat would mean. Cruise actually dialed it back a bit to start, but was skillfully in full action mode by its end.A bit less enticing was the CGI and the alien antagonists though not enough to hurt or spoil the movie. The aliens are wonderfully aggressive though they seem to have been designed to do no more than wreak mayhem. I think if it were me I'd work on them a bit more, make them a little less frantic though what they've already filmed must have cost a fortune. The rest of the CGI was excellent and no complaints.The last ingredient, the plot, could also use a little more work, but here I feel I'm being a bit of a perfectionist. The story's main idea is hard to miss and, in total, is well executed here considering what they're trying to describe. Few will be unmoved despite the bizarre premise and even though some of the details may have been lost.The fact is I smiled to myself several times during this movie and afterward didn't feel in the least disappointed. I'd been thoroughly entertained and even intellectually challenged.A great time at the movies!",9,1,3,7 June 2014
"Hail, Caesar!"," This movie was sheer joy for me
","The last time I was as unexpectedly elated was years ago with the first Alien film, a much different film. This film is a light-hearted homage to the old studio system which was far less innocent than depicted here. But there are no sordid casting couches at this studio and no one is hoping for a part, they're already the stars.And that allows the Coen brothers to have some good clean fun with the period and the kind of characters that inhabited the era. Josh Brolin, Alden Ehrenreich and Scarlett Johansson all do a great job channeling the wise-cracking Hollywood sorts common to the 40's and 50's. Tilda Swinton and George Clooney do much the same; I particularly enjoyed Tilda's take on a gossip columnist. Clooney's part seemed a little overdrawn but appropriate.The Coens reproduce several of the kinds of scenes typical of the period and it's a delight to see them done by actors like Channing Tatum. His dance number is impeccable and as someone who really disliked that sort of thing back when I was a kid, I was amazed at how I felt seeing it now. It was as if these people were showing that era that we could do it too and I could have stood up and clapped it was so good.",9,3,7,12 February 2016
Stranger Than Fiction," Easily the biggest positive surprise of the year
","This is a very clever and enjoyable movie where apparently everyone involved knew they were into something special and gave it their all, and it worked. Will Ferrell could not have done better. Nor could Maggie Gyllenhaal or Emma Thompson or Queen Latifah. It's a refreshing new take on the 'What makes life worth living?' issue. No really new answers to that question, but you won't mind. I'm a number person myself, and though I would never count things like the number of steps I took to the bus stop, I know the type. The Gyllenhaal character, Ana Pascal, is also familiar, and someone I like spending time with. Even the tax aspects of this story, hardly a focus, make sense.No, if this doesn't become an instant classic, it won't be for lack of quality on almost every dimension. And I'll be taking notice anytime I see that the director is Marc Forster or the writer is Zach Helm.",9,1,2,26 August 2007
The Reader," I resisted watching this film, but I was wrong
","I'm not a fan of holocaust films and I suspected this was one. But in fact this is more en exploration of the reality of having to make your way through a war. And though the young male lead (David Kross)is especially flawless, Kate Winslet is even more luminous and unforgettable. For me, Ms. Winslet epitomizes what an actress should be far more boldly than, say, Meryl Streep. She seems to crave exploring other persona to the point she can authentically speak for them. What's more, there's something oddly disarming about the way she so easily goes nude in many of her movies. She might as well be chiding the rest of us for our utter lack of courage.I would fault this film with being a little long on its intimate scenes for my taste though I'm not sure it would work otherwise. But this film for me is head and shoulders above others I've seen covering the same subject matter. It makes you think more clearly about what it must have meant to be a Nazi, working for the camps, and though I can imagine there will be people who think this is some kind of apologia for those who worked in the death camps, I would argue this merely highlights their own lack of compassion.Ralph Fiennes role is a difficult one and I'm not sure he fully conquers it, but he certainly isn't very far from making it real. Try to imagine what could have been done to make his performance better. I can't think of a single thing.",9,1,1,10 January 2010
Inception," I'm sorry to say this is not as 'great' a film as they think
","But it's got its heart in the right place. First it's too long by at least a half-hour. Second it relies too much on frenetic activity to cover up its more grievous shortfalls. And third it's not really sci-fi, it's more a psychological thriller. But despite all that it is what it is portraying, an attempt to implant a notion, and that's highly commendable on several levels. Also a few of the scenes are both memorable and essentially flawless.The acting's all there too despite what some critics claim. DiCaprio is capable and fully invested. Joseph Gordon-Levitt's performance is especially engaging, but the casting of Ellen Page was a near fatal mistake if you ask me. I can see why she made sense to the director and producers, but she's a drag on the movie as is Ken Watanabe who I could barely understand half the time. Still I like his acting and I can tolerate his pronunciation here. Page I don't like for some reason. Perhaps it's just too distracting and/or annoying to see her exude an almost pre-adolescent lack of experience again. If they needed an 'innocent', and I don't really agree, I would have preferred Dakota Fanning. Marion Cotillard does the exact opposite, she's worldly and knowing, but her I'd like to protect and get to know personally.I would have liked to see a slower more moody treatment of this topic. Though at least one of the chase scenes is masterful and hair-raising, the real pay dirt would have been imagining trying to enter another person's mind. In fact the separation between our minds is the bedrock on which most of our problems lay. A 'shared dream' as portrayed here would have been several notches more paradigm breaking than depicted here, I think, and that's no small flaw in this film.",8,9,18,17 July 2010
Lord of War," Lord of War may be my new All-Time Favorite
","I saw Lord of War yesterday and I was overwhelmed. It's clearly for adults only but with that in mind I can't think of one moment I would change. I would say this is easily one of the most completely satisfying films I've seen in many a year. I'm in awe of its beauty and I left the theater completely inspired. In my mind everyone connected to this film has just risen a couple of notches up in my book. This movie has a point of view, and it is strongly anti-violence, but it is also able to give a realistic sense of the gun-trade that must have taken years to acquire. I would think this is mostly inside information that no one would have wanted known generally.Still glowing from my viewing I went to today's Chicago Sun-Times Weekend insert to see what Ebert had written about it. I was completely surprised to find that there's not one word about it! What could possibly be the reason for this obvious spurn? Well, I always thought Ebert was Jewish and there is one scene, quite a short scene, which is not very complementary to the Israeli Defense Forces that may have offended him though to anyone who has followed the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, by almost any non-mainstream media, it's not only justified, it's long overdue. Could that be why he's ignoring it? Or could it be that he takes offense to its portrayal of Africans? I've read Ebert's reviews in the Friday Chicago Sun-Times Weekend insert for years now. You have to amend his stars awarded by these rules: If it's predominantly got Blacks as actors he automatically will give the movie at least an extra star. On the other hand, if it's likely to be a blockbuster regardless of what he and the other critics have to say, he will frequently give the movie at least one less star than it really deserves. The man has a knack for descriptive phrases but his rebuff of this magnificent film will not be forgotten by this movie lover for a very long time.Politically savvy males in particular should run to catch this movie in theaters before it's gone. But those who like to see masterful direction should go to see it as well. It's a rare triumph of a movie and if I were making movies this is one I'd love to have been involved with.",10,2,7,23 September 2005
WALL·E," Brilliant beginning somewhat spoiled by the reality it alludes to
","I was ready to be wowed by this film and the first 20 minutes or so were ecstatic for me. Sometimes I think there's no comparison between Japanese anime and the stuff Hollywood puts out, but this was clearly inspired and ingenious film making that can hold its own against Japan's best. But then the film has trouble dealing with the problems it poses, not unlike how we're failing to deal with the REAL problems of over consumption and the mindless accumulation of waste that it alludes to. The setting changes and the story takes a rather depressing turn into frenetic activity that made me anxious to see it over. It's not that the film's point is misguided or even over sold. It's just that it's a different issue and not necessarily a consequence of the first more successfully contrived part. That second issue is our becoming overly serviced by robots in a blind pursuit of entertainment and sensation. Still, the creation of a robot with a completely engaging personality is so brilliant and indelible that no one should miss this somewhat mixed film. Clearly the people who made this have their head's on straight and have a better vision of what could result from our culture than some of our most highly respected leaders.",8,12,21,10 July 2008
Arrival," Underwhelming, but thought provoking and well acted
","This movie attempts to depict what a real first contact might look like. For SciFi fans, that's practically the Holy Grail. Unfortunately, it's also extremely difficult to pull off, especially for those of us who love the genre. (I've been trying to outdo Hollywood with my own musings for years and seldom manage to do better.)There are several new ideas incorporated in this latest visionary story, and though I found them a bit adolescent, I am happy that regular people are realizing that our being contacted by an intelligent and necessarily more advanced species is going to be far more impactful for us than, say, the cure for cancer or the creation of machine super-intelligence.The long and the short of it is, this movie asks you to overlook a simple point about the whole predicament as it's presented. And I can't say that stopped me from enjoying the ride, but it did disappoint a bit. The people I was with thought the movie well above average and they enjoyed it more than I did, but they weren't SciFi aficionados, like me, so the bar was a lot lower for them.",8,2,8,11 November 2016
Prometheus," Ridley has made a personal plea for our species here
","Mr Scott is the only filmmaker I'd ever want to sit down with and enjoy a long conversation, I think. The vision displayed in Blade Runner and Aliens is as sharp and deep as it gets. I wish I could conjure up such landscapes but I'm glad someone can. Prometheus is not in the same category as those other films. It's more an addendum to both.I enjoyed watching it, Ridley is too good at what he does to not make an enjoyable film, but it's rather clumsy in its basic thrust. That's mostly to do with the screenplay which doesn't seem to direct the action in an optimal way given what the movie is really about. There should have been far more made of Weyland's quest to know his maker, for example. (He's the dead billionaire who finances the deep space expedition.) And there are problems with motives for some of the other major characters as well.Unlike many of the other reviewers, I think Fassbender, who I think is pretty much single-handedly rewriting acting standards, is not the natural focus of the film. Instead it falls on Noomi Rapace who as Dr Shaw makes me a bit uncomfortable. She's a little too odd to play the hero, or even take the lion's share of the screen time, in my opinion. I also didn't think Theron's role was well-advised. It's a little too inexplicable and cold for my taste though I generally eat up everything Charlize does.In the end I was left a little dissatisfied though I had plenty to think about. And that's worth quite a bit more than the price of a ticket.",8,5,10,10 June 2012
Wonder Woman," If I were an actress hoping to outdo Gal Gadot as WW, I'd forget it
","In a lot of ways, this is not that special a movie. For my money the best scene comes early and it's a battle scene where the Amazons take on WW1 Germans. Thing is that scene includes some of the most beautiful imaginations of women in battle I've ever seen. That took actors able to place their bodies in some very athletic positions. The last time I saw something comparable was with Brad Pitt in Troy when he takes on some Trojan champion.Gal Gadot doesn't really share in that wonderful first battle scene, but she's so captivating and right for the part, it's a pleasure to see her carry on in the rest of it. Women aren't easy to portray as warriors but this movie manages to pull it off. And that's doubly impressive since the director's a woman.The movie does lose a little of its magic near the end, but is well worth your time.",9,11,27,2 June 2017
Win Win," Easily my favorite Giamatti film - pure fun entertainment
","I'd heard this was a good effort but I was a little skeptical, Giamatti makes odd little movies that you have to be in the mood for, I think. But this one anyone would be proud to be behind. And Giamatti is excellent.Giamatti is on screen almost continuously and it's a blessing but he's hardly alone. There's his wife, played by Amy Ryan, who is so dead on I laughed my head off at her portrayal. Then there's Bobby Cannavale who plays Giamatti's best friend who also supplies comic relief when needed. And Kyle's mother played by Melanie Lynskey is another well crafted performance where an actor is handed the ball and no one's let down. And there's even more noteworthy in terms of acting. Another thing I repeatedly shook my head over was the writing which I found more than impressive, I found it near miraculous with the kind of dialog and story I'm sure most actors would murder to get their hands on. There's no doubt in my mind this is easily the best writing I've encountered all year.But for me the key to the whole thing is Kyle played by Alex Shaffer. A skilled actor could, on a good day, perhaps match Giamatti for pure humanity and pathos, but Kyle's role is a little too unique to easily recast. This Kyle is the engine that moves most of the movie, in my opinion. I'm thinking that his role works as a kind of psychological pivot which allows the rest of the cast to do its job. But that's not to take anything away from Mr Shaffer who gives one of the most memorable performances I've ever seen by someone his age. For me this kid deserves high praise and I can only hope I'm not alone.",Null,0,0,5 September 2011
Iron Man," Rob't Downey hits one out of the park - with a lob from Jon Favreau
","The bad news? The movie lurched to an unsatisfying ending, I thought. But, don't worry, by then it's all anti-climax anyway. 7/8ths of this film is pure joy, straight out of the best comic book experience you ever had. Somehow (director) Favreau's captured it all on film with Downey's and Paltrow's and Bridges' help, all of whom are dead on. I especially liked Downey's portrayal though Paltrow is pure million-dollar assistant. And Bridges makes a wonderful Obadiah Stane, genius Tony Stark's greedy chief executive. Out of the leads, it's only Terrence Howard who seems a little out of step, but not enough to get in the way. The middle eastern bad guys, on the other hand, are wonderful without the slightest condescension.The special effects are beautifully done with only a couple of minor exceptions. But it's the story's unfurling in its own time that made the movie especially delicious in my opinion, and that must have been the scriptwriter's and director's doing. Best of all, as the whole smartly executed mess starts to come in for a landing, you know as surely as you know the sun will rise tomorrow that there will be a sequel and, for once, you can't wait. Is this a guy's movie? I really don't know. I saw it at a matinÃ©e with about 6 guys and one woman and she was inscrutable. I suspect she was a bit out of her element. There is a lot of shooting and flying and tech stuff, not the usual female bill of fare.",9,1,3,5 May 2008
Casino Royale," There's much enjoy about Craig's Bond
","Unlike some reviewers, I found Bond's antagonist, Le Chiffre, played by Mads Mikkelsen, quite good, and the beautiful Eva Green not quite as entertaining as Bond's love interest, Vesper Lynd. But, of course, the key is Bond himself and Craig is quite good as the most athletic and sardonic Bond ever. Any guy should enjoy this film. But while watching I kept thinking, why does this film start in Africa? Are we finding it more and more difficult to find 'bad guys' with a bit of real life in them? Truth is, the English speaking world is no more immune to greed and violence than any other. Bond is best fighting true villains for a good cause and not merely for power and resources, as in real life. With the recent death and suspected murder of anti-Putin ex-KGB agent Litvinenko I kept thinking how ironic that as that man lay dying, he was complaining about how 'ruthless' the KGB is, while I and millions of others were reveling in Bond's make-believe ruthlessness. I guess in real life it's only fun when we're not the victim.If the scripts can at least match this one, the Bond franchise is going to make a strong comeback. What amazing luck, finding Craig.",8,3,7,27 November 2006
Vicky Cristina Barcelona," Didn't think I'd see this Woody Allen take on Latin loveplay
","Didn't think he was capable of portraying it honestly or with any insight. Surely Barcelona is a long ways from angst-ridden Manhatten. And though I like Bardem's work, and think Scarlett Johansson is always a great choice for female lead, I was leery about spending much time watching Penelope Cruz acting wild and over-the-top at Allen's direction. To my surprise, Cruz was the most impressive of all. In just a few minutes, and she's on only a short time, she manages to nail a certain Latin type that anyone acquainted with the genuine article will recognize immediately. My only complaint is I wish Allen had gotten his camera in a little closer to Cruz as her performance is truly memorable and I would have enjoyed seeing more of her. Otherwise, this is a fun sex comedy which I still have trouble attributing to Woody Allen.",9,4,8,9 February 2009
Elizabeth: The Golden Age," Didn't expect to like this movie about the ultimate Pirate Queen
","I'm mostly Spanish. To me Queen Elizabeth was not some well-meaning, noble monarch, but a desperate, royal cut-throat willing to send her countrymen out on numerous provocative raids. Every time I hear of a new treatment of the period, I'm always interested to see what the spin is. (In case you don't know, public relations got its real start back in Elizabethan times with the English trashing Spain's Inquisition.) There's no attempt to escape the pirate angle in this movie. What is toyed with is the idea that Elizabeth authorized the raids. And it may be the case that she couldn't control people like Sir Walter Raleigh, but nevertheless she did little to discourage their activity, or to turn away their profits. In this movie the question is made to appear one of the poor English holding off the much more powerful Spanish. Raleigh believes that when he takes from the Spanish, he weakens them and, therefore, protects Protestant England. That's probably an acceptable interpretation of events. You can't go praising theft otherwise.All that aside, I'm a fan of both Cate Blanchett and Clive Owen. And Geoffrey Rush is near perfect here. And now I can add the director to my list, Shekhar Kapur. I found the pacing, style and script wonderful and unusually entertaining and you'd have to ascribe a great deal of that to Kapur. Among the actors, Cate is especially excellent as she makes Elizabeth someone even I can admire. She really deserved some high praise for her portrayal, easily the best I've ever seen, and there have been quite a few over the years. About the only thing I'd quibble about would be the sets which seemed a little too opulent, having visited the Tower of London. I imagine the real Elizabeth wasn't quite so surrounded in splendor. Still, the art direction is quite effective. This is definitely a fine movie and well worth renting.",9,1,2,30 September 2008
Beowulf," Easily one of the most male centered movies I've ever seen
","And I loved it. The creators of this little gem have far more potent imaginations than I and I envy them that. What a rousing movie! I picked it up in DVD to fill up an evening while my wife was away and what a pleasure it was to get engrossed in this brilliantly told tale of courage and adventure. It took me about 30 seconds to get used to the animation. It will take you longer to get used to the idea that this movie actually does a better job evoking a bygone time than the literature on which it's based. That's amazing to me. Another surprise was that Ms Jolie's much ballyhooed nude scenes were more disappointing than I had expected. I found myself more entranced with Robin Wright Penn's Wealthow who is undeservedly undervalued as an indispensable part of this film's magical weave. Ray Winstone rings more true in the lead than anyone had any right to hope for, in my opinion. And then there's Anthony Hopkins and John Malkovich, both adding bits of irrepressible humanity to the mix. This is in sum a thoroughly enjoyable film and I don't hesitate to recommend it, but especially to guys who will have a richer appreciation of it all than I would expect the usual woman will.",9,43,70,1 March 2008
Live Free or Die Hard," Bruce Willis is one irreplaceable guy
","Sometimes when I wonder who's really having the most fun, I think of people like Antonio Banderas or Clint Eastwood or maybe Gary Oldman. Why I seldom think of Bruce Willis is hard to explain, but I'm beginning to think he's got an edge on them all. I remember admiring the guy's easy way back in his Moonlighting days. Somehow he made a seamless transition to serious action from light-hearted adventure-comedy, and, at this rather more advanced age, shows no real signs of slowing down, despite the references to his aching body in this film. Like Clint Eastwood and Paul Newman, I can't imagine anyone wishing this guy ill, male or female, rich or poor, American or Al Qaida. He's almost impossible to dislike. When I consider that he was also in one of my favorite films of all time, The Fifth Element, I kinda wonder if the Die Hard films aren't just an elaborate way of glorifying this unusual actor.",8,0,1,14 July 2007
Amélie," Often find myself disagreeing with IMDb ratings, but not this time
","This film really has to be explained rather than reviewed. It's just too good to have come from skilled film makers, never mind how unworthy we moviegoers are. But I do have an hypothesis as to how it came to be. It's fresh on my mind because I just saw it again over my satellite system.My hypothesis is that this film essentially coalesced like the dew on a daisy around its brilliant star, Audrey Tautou. If some giant voice came out of the sky demanding proof why this world should be spared celestial retribution, I would argue we point to Ms Tautou. I see this tour de force as an homage to her peerless perfection. I can believe everyone involved intended it as such, their best efforts probably came forth effortlessly, inspired by her performance. And I've no doubt Audrey didn't have a clue.Some countries are endlessly proud of their various accomplishments, but if I were French, I'd be content to have produced someone like this shining example of a woman capable of lighting up a million faces as if she were born capable of it.",10,1,4,14 April 2011
Munich," A Strong, if Flawed, Endorsement of Revenge
","What a surprise this was! I expected a maudlin, cloying tale of ethnic woe, but instead, this is an almost perfect close-in thriller where your mind is likely to be racing as quickly as Eric Bana's. As far as I'm concerned, despite all his technically wonderful achievements in Sci-Fi, this is Spielberg's best film. True, he's probably unsurpassed for his ability to scare you even as you marvel at sights you can barely take in. But this film seems so much more difficult.I am hardly a friendly audience given the subject matter, but I was more than glad I rented the DVD. Here he is telling the story of people who are not interested in telling their story, and somehow it's believable, engrossing and almost defensible. Of course it's something of a let down that all his main characters are rather admirable, but to Spielberg's credit, that humanity is not entirely the domain of the protagonists.And the action sequences are probably the most realistic I've seen anywhere. Where else can you sit and safely watch what seems like a real gun fight? I have two objections but they're important. In one of the scenes, a Palestinian child is deliberately protected from the mayhem. To my mind this is an attempt to rehabilitate a people known for killing Palestinian children almost without hesitation. It was a huge mistake, in my opinion, for Spielberg to pretend otherwise. THe other distortion is the argument unanswered in the film that the Palestinians have no home when Palestine was their home for more than 2,000 years, far longer than the Israelis ever had it.Does no one remember the footage of that little boy killed by head-shot by Israelis while huddling beside a wall with his father? Or how about the countless children killed almost as target practice for doing no more than throwing stones? But the chances are no one will question Spielberg's accuracy. Only someone who uses alternative sources on the Middle East is likely to see the Big Lie so innocuously inserted into this enthralling film. Most will succumb to the deluge of counter-spin generated by the well connected Israeli PR people. Spielberg knew that this film contained these poison pills when he edited this otherwise excellent film and I, for one, lament his lapse of courage.",8,1,3,30 May 2006
Deadpool," A fun ride especially for guys
","There's a lot of rough wisecracking in this fast moving film. I saw this movie with my wife who liked it to my surprise though not as much as the young crowd we saw it with. They apparently knew a lot more about the story than we did.I'm not familiar with the comic but I recognize the style and it's pretty raucous and bawdy, the kind of thing I would have especially liked when I was younger. Ryan Reynolds is a great choice for the lead as he handles the fast talk as if he might have come up with the dialog himself. More of a surprise is Morena Baccarin who plays Deadpool's love interest, Vanessa. I've seen her elsewhere but didn't recognize she could be so lively a sex partner and love object. I thought she was miscast but I was wrong.Speaking of casting, like all good heroic tales, there has to be a good villain and Ed Skrein, someone I don't recognize, fits the bill nicely as Ajax a mad scientist of sorts.But for me the best part of all were the action scenes where Deadpool's moves are a thing of beauty. Assuming a real person executed them, that guy deserves to be recognized and honored.All in all a fun, entertaining time at the movies.",8,4,14,14 February 2016
Cloud Atlas," The main thing is this movie IS entertaining
","I believe art is an emotional argument about what is important. This time the Wachowskis set out to make my point with a wonderfully inventive mix of stories that basically have little but the emotions they elicit in common, that and the actors in them. You won't be bored, but there isn't much enlightenment here either though I can't disagree with their main two points as I saw them, that there is more to life than living and we are all interconnected such that we make our own future with every misstep or triumph.It's as if the Wachowskis were attempting to make those points with story. I'm not sure that they did but then I pretty much believed something very similar before seeing the movie. So I was left a bit disappointed. Also I'm not sure I was as comfortable with their choice of lead actors as they were, or with their choice of characters, in particular the devil-like character didn't work very well, I thought. But this is such a sprawling vehicle, nothing was all that much of a put off and I can't remember the last time I sat this long without squirming.The art work in the futuristic scenes was effective, I thought, though often somewhat derivative of sci-fi classics like Tron, Blade Runner and Soylent Green. On the other hand the scenes of tribal life seemed oddly unconvincing. But I can't really complain. In general all of the parallel stories seemed interesting and were fun to watch. But this is not a normal movie so be open-minded.",9,5,17,27 October 2012
300," The only real flaw in this movie is that it follows Frank Miller's story TOO closely
","It would have been better to have made different, grander, artistic choices in several places in this very impressive movie. As it is, it's as if someone had challenged the director to animate Frank Miller's graphic novel, and the director decided to make his overwhelming skill and ability indisputable by doing just that, almost as if by sheer magic. For example, Gerard Butler, who in my opinion turns in a perfect performance as King Leonidas, in several places is indistinguishable with the comic's image, an image which, though arresting, I would have bet my next child was pure fantasy and impossible to find in the flesh. I was so wrong, I'm a little rattled. But why deny the fear that must have been his last emotion before setting out for the Hot Gates? Forget the comic book, his real courage would have been his overcoming that fear for the greater good.And Lena Headey as Queen Gorgo positively exudes passion and loyalty, and sensuality too. It's hard to believe anyone other than a King would try to be her match. But what woman truly thinks her husband's glorious death is preferable to his presence, no matter what the stakes?No, someone should have challenged Zack Snyder to base his movie on the novel, but to improve it anyway he thought fit. This movie could have been so much more, and I feel the loss. Still, as it is, it's going to be impossible for any male, at least, to forget. I knew the story before, and it's more complicated than shown here, but where the ancient narratives are sketchy, Miller and Snyder have filled in beautiful scenarios that evoke what the reality must have been. That took real love for the event and the people who lived it in real life.",9,3,6,11 March 2007
Kingsman: The Secret Service," What I was expecting, I didn't get. And that's a good thing!
","My wife and I watched the trailer for this film two weeks ago and she wanted to see it and I didn't. Seemed a silly sendup of the spy genre badly miscast with Colin Firth in a lead role and shot in a frenetic style. Surprise, surprise. This is the most fun we've had at the movies in a long while now.Colin Firth is exactly right for his part. He deftly wavers between dead serious and quiet amusement. Not once did I think even for a moment that anyone better known for action movies could have done half as well. He's very entertaining and in a lot of ways the film revolves around him to its benefit.I found Samuel L. Jackson's lisp a bit distracting and a little off-putting, but no deal breaker. The character I was most intrigued by was Gazelle the villain's henchwoman played by an extremely comely Sofia Boutella who would make an impressive Bond girl. Throughout she's a delight to watch doing evil despite her having no feet.There's humor here and a good sense of fun. But I can't say I'm that enthused about a sequel though the main character here, Eggsy, played by Taron Egerton, is quite good. His transformation here is pretty impressive, but he's awfully young.Of course, I started out thinking the movie was going to be boring, and I was quite wrong about that. I could be completely wrong about Eggsy in a sequel. I do know they've racked up enough goodwill with me that I won't be able to resist taking a look.",8,4,11,13 February 2015
John Wick: Chapter 2," A great movie for those of us frustrated with the political scene
","This movie has pretty much perfected the cinematic kill shot. Keanu goes on a killing spree and every shot seems like it was worked out in detail. You look closely and you would swear he was aiming his weapon exactly as needed to produce the blood and brain splatter so skillfully and repeatedly displayed. It's almost a solo dance he does and he has to be given credit for doing it with the grace and precision of a Fred Astaire.In contrast the first Wick movie seemed a bit tentative though you could see what was intended and feel it was worth attempting. This movie is more complete and fun, and there's no hesitation in execution at all. There's a dreamy sensibility in full bloom aided by Keanu's peculiarly emotionless approach.There's no confusing all this with real violence though it's believable enough. I think those decrying its violence are way off base. All men have at some point wished they could make some certain people be permanently gone. But what would that even look like? Here's the answer produced skillfully and rather uniquely in a style others will have trouble trying to duplicate. But as a prelude to real violence it's about as useful Animal House was to going to college.If, on the other hand, you just want to vent your frustrations, this movie can work better than a punching bag.",9,12,24,13 February 2017
Spectre," Not to worry, you will get your money's worth
","This is not Casino Royale which happens to be on TV as I write this. Craig was noticeably younger then, 9 years ago, but he still looks up for the role. And he is put through his paces in this one.The movie is a little bit of a mishmash with some portions almost surreal and others a little stodgy, but given how ambitious the movie is, at one point it sort of recaps the whole series, it's all ultimately very satisfying. I really admire the director, Sam Mendes', eye. Some of what he puts together and highlights here is near miraculous. For example, I've no idea how some of the opening sequence was put together, but it's wonderfully entertaining. Other parts will give you a smile of remembrance as you recall where you saw it first.All in all, if this is Craig saying goodbye to the role, it's done with style and grace.",9,6,15,7 November 2015
Moon," Great matinée movie for us ponderers
","Nicely pulled off by all concerned though I kind of missed a more mindful treatment of our moon's low gravity.I once asked an official from NASA why we hadn't set up a listening station on the far side of the moon. He mentioned in his answer that psychologically it would be extremely difficult. This movie seems to explore that notion though it's unclear to me whether it's actually supposed to take place on the far side or not.I would have rented the movie if I'd heard it was some long unrelenting saga of psychological deterioration (which I need like a hole in the head). And, though it definitely spends some time on that, it also delves into much more entertaining stuff: Things like questions of identity and what is permissible in our mindless pursuit of profit.I'd have to admit, however, that my wife was bored. Space sagas aren't really her thing and she nodded off a couple of times. I on the other hand enjoyed every minute of it, and I know there are a great many other sci-fi fans out there who would too.",8,2,3,19 July 2009
Slumdog Millionaire," A skillful rendition of a frayed ideology
","It doesn't help that this film has been over-hyped. You'd think there was something more to it than its novel setting, the slums of Mumbai. But if there is something noteworthy about it, it's not the ideas expressed in it, but rather the direction which is pretty impressive. I'm still not sure how Boyle pulled it off. The whole first half-hour or so I was really distracted trying to figure out just what had been done to capture the action in the way it was. It was as if it was captured as it happens where a lot of what you see has already started by the time you focus on it. It's very effective and in no way reminiscent of a documentary but rather real life experience. Aside from that, however, the story is fairly lame. It's well acted and filmed, and I wouldn't call it a waste of time in any way, but it left me with little more knowledge than I had had before I'd seen it. Possibly for people who haven't experienced third world slums, it might be enlightening, but I've been there and it didn't shine a bright light into any dark corners for me.",8,0,4,12 April 2009
Me Before You," Guys can trade this with their girl for an action flick
","This is not a guy friendly movie but it's not so sappy that it can't be tolerated. Emilia Clarke is in fine form but miles from her role as Mother of Dragons in Game of Thrones. You can barely recognize her. But she's effective as the always cheerful companion to a rich but paralyzed young man played by Sam Claflin.It was actually Claflin's performance that I found the most interesting. This guy starts out briefly as a young stud, enjoying his lively life. But then he is paralyzed very convincingly; he even seems slightly thinner as if he hasn't gotten out of bed for months. As a guy I tended to sympathize more with him while my wife was more taken with Emilia's role.Anyway, it's all fairly entertaining. And next time it's my choice what we see.",8,2,5,11 June 2016
The Proposal," As a guy expected to cringe more than I did -- thankfully
","I find Sandra Bullock funny and easy to watch. Without her, I wouldn't have accompanied my wife to this movie. But it turns out, Ryan Reynolds more than holds up his end of the bargain, and that was a huge relief because I was certain they were going to put in some female heartthrob making it almost impossible for a guy to enjoy watching Ms Bullock get out of her predicament. (She needs to fend off Immigration so she isn't deported to Canada. I can't believe this happens much in real life, btw.) But Ryan matches her all down the line comedy-wise and there's something extraordinary about that. This guy's quite good. In fact all the secondary players are quite good as well. This is a message film and the message is, family matters even more than a high-powered job in New York. It's not a perfect film, there are a few rough spots and some laughter dry spots, but in general, it's a pleasant time at the movies with some very capable actors and a workable script.",8,0,3,29 June 2009
The Martian," Probably the best film I've seen this year
","If you're a sci-fi fan who's heavy on the science, there may be a few challenges in store for you here, but I grew up dreaming about space exploration, know more than most about the reality, and I was more than satisfied with this ambitious film.I can believe there will be a whole new generation growing up with notions of being an astronaut between this film and the earlier 'Gravity'. It's interesting how both 'The Martian' and 'Gravity' manage to create an engaging story from the whole of what we know about space travel so far. There's something very seductive about that.Matt Damon is the focus here. He plays an astronaut inadvertently stranded on Mars and thinking about this role, I imagine good actors could have very different interpretations. All I know is Damon's low key performance would be hard to top. You will be rooting for him throughout his unprecedented ordeal.The other thing is the way Ridley Scott decided to treat Mars. His approach is not that complicated or cerebral. It's almost as if everyone knows Mars and doesn't have to be introduced to it. Instead he focuses on the people and the way they work together to help one of their own. The result is a strong movie where you care about everyone involved.My wife, hardly a science buff, loved it. And I can't imagine anyone not being moved by it.",9,6,66,2 October 2015
V for Vendetta," Only Hollywood could have dismissed the Wachowski brothers
","Well, I put off going to this film after reading a couple of reviews. It sounded a little lame, and the last time I saw Natalie Portman she was less than rewarding. This time, however, she captured my attention and held it like you would expect a beautiful young woman to do, though with her own twist, namely that her persona manages to speak of her humanity more strongly than her physicality. It seems Natalie has deepened her skills since The Professional. Still, the movie relies on her performance to the extent that it would have failed if she had faltered. She doesn't. No, I walked away from the movie tonight totally amazed that this 2 hour plus movie had managed to keep me riveted to my seat like some old Bingo player needing only one mroe square to win the night's big jackpot. And my wife, no fan of either action movies or political thrillers, was miraculously just as mesmerized. This movie is a towering achievement, and there's no doubt in my mind that it will be the standard in its genre for a long time to come. And if you thought Hugo Weaving a slightly odd choice for Agent Smith in his last big role, watch him win you over in this film. He does it with insight and intuition despite extreme limitations (a Guy Fawkes mask). And John Hurt is every bit as righteous and outraged as some of our real politicians, making him all too easily recognizable.I love this film! V may introduce himself with about 1,000 more words than necessary, but quickly, this film makes its points like some master litigator building an ironclad case. Oh I looked at my watch alright, but not to see how much more I had to endure, but how much of this cinematic miracle was left before I'd be unceremoniously thrown out into the cold, cold night. To say this screenplay is brilliant is a colossal understatement. It's almost impossible to believe any writing team could have dreamed it up, much less one where one of the team is seeking a sex-change operation in a real-life. And considering that the Wachowski brothers were responsible for The Matrix as well, I thank my lucky stars that I didn't grow up to be in competition with these guys! Quite unlike the Matrix sequels, this movie is very much the worthy of successor of The Matrix.A couple of after thoughts: If you've heard about the Holocaust allusions, don't worry. You're not pummeled into submission with yet another account of that tragedy. And two, I fervently hope this operation they're talking about doesn't diminish their ability to create mind boggling cinema. That would truly be a tragedy, all around.",9,9,18,25 March 2006
The Island," This movie brings theory to life with the flair of a magician
","Ever wonder what it would be like to be a clone? Not an easy get. There's really nothing similar in everyday life. The possibility is explored in such a skillful way in this wonderful movie that Michael Bay, the director, is now up there with Ridley Scott and James Cameron in my book, though that sketch is just one of many achievements here. True, there are a few misses, but you will forgive them unless you're even tighter with your praise than you are with your money. There are just too many chances taken successfully to not be thoroughly impressed. The overwhelming effect is one of real mastery and vision.All the leads are in top form. As a guy you're almost swept away by Scarlett Johansson who can command our attention at will it seems. And though the plot is a little over the top, it's expressed with such flair and energy that it doesn't really matter. No, I'm really sorry I didn't see this movie the minute it came out, and it's clearly a good move to see it on the big screen. (It puzzles me why women liked it better than men in the rating demographics. There's a lot of extremely well done action in this movie.)",9,2,5,1 August 2005
