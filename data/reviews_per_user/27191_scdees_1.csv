Marie Antoinette," Marie Antoinette-a disappointment with flair
","Sofia Coppola's rendition of Marie Antoinette was disappointing in that it really lacked substance. There were redeeming facets in the staging of the sets and the elaborate costumes, however, even though it is understood what Ms Coppola was trying to do, the movie fell short of the goal. We saw girlish rendition of an allegedly misunderstood young woman who was propelled into the role of Queen at a very early age. While one could sympathize with the plight of a young woman in today's world, during those years youth was not as immature as it is today and royalty was schooled in the manners expected of them. This young woman literally ignored her adviser, took no interest whatsoever in the political world of which she was a part through her status as the wife of King Louis XVI. She made no effort to learn of the French protocol, to determine the issues and quality of life of the people,and in her deliberate ignorance created a hostile environment for herself and her husband. Ms Coppola's attempt to show the Queen as a poor misunderstood child failed in part because she deliberately omitted a plot to the movie that would substantiate her perspective. Kirsten Dunst has talent, but she has not yet found a suitable character to display her talent. In her role here as in previous roles she is portrayed as an ing√©nue with blond curls and a Gidget mind.",4,0,0,17 February 2007
