Blade Runner 2049," A welcomed expansion to Scott's universe
","Back when I first saw the original sci-fi classic 'Blade Runner', I never thought I'd get to see a sequel to it. Slowly times were changing and sequels, remakes and reboots were at the front-end of Hollywood's production line and by looking the quality of said sequels, I feared that a continuation of 'Blade Runner' would be a bad idea. Well, I am glad to be wrong! Not only 'Blade Runner 2049' is a masterpiece of film making, it's also one of the best additions to the science-fiction genre in the past decade.Denis Villeneuve's class is remarkable, after his first stab at a sci-fi with 'Arrival', the French-Canadian director manages to push himself even further and re-imagine the dystopian universe created decades ago by Ridley Scott. Partnering up once again with famed cinematographer Roger Deakins, the two expanded Scott's neo-noir classic to greater distances, sweeping up an abundance of awards just for cinematography alone, include an academy award.The story takes place 30 years after the events of the first movie, where a young Blade Runner, played by Ryan Gosling seeks out the truth about himself, leading to the search of Rick Deckard, played by the same tireless Harrison Ford. Having Ford on board was crucial to the development on the script, proving that his grouchiness was essential to the character's current beaten down state of mind.
Another solid point is Dave Bautista's knack for playing supporting characters who won't steal the show, but will add plenty to the scenes they're in.'Blade Runner 2049' has a long running time, almost reaching 3 hours and yes the pace was slow at times, but that should not make you leave the theater or fast-forward the movie at home. It's not surprising that it didn't perform beyond expectations at the box-office, slow paced gritty neo-noir aren't for everyone and certainly not for the 'Transformers' era of cinema.While it does top it's predecessor, 'Blade Runner 2049' is an example of a sequel done right, just like 'Terminator 2' and 'Aliens'.",10,4,10,28 March 2018
Moana," A breath of fresh air in Disney's animated library
","Disney goes back to their roots with a heartwarming story about a 'princess' named Moana of Motunui, as she expressed it several times throughout the film. It's a tale of mysticism and heroism that made me truly feel connected to my inner childhood. 
In the movie, Moana is chosen by the power of the ocean to search for the demigod Maui, voice by Dwayne Johnson, and reunite the heart-relic of a fallen goddess in order restore life in the island.The cast did an amazing job voicing each character and singing all the songs that accompanied the movie in such perfect ways. One of the most astonishing scenes of the film was with the giant treasure-hoarding crab, voiced impeccably by Jemaine Clement. The imagery of the underwater world owned by the crab was simply stunning, at times reminding me of the sub-aquatic terrors of 'Finding Nemo'.'Moana' is filled with clever bits and pieces, like Maiu's tattoos or the shapeshift end-results of his ability or Heihei the clumsy rooster.The songs written by 'Hamilton' alumni Lin-Manuel Miranda are the best things I have heard in recent years, with the song 'You're Welcome' at the very top.'Moana' established itself as one of the best Disney animated feature films of all time.",9,1,3,29 March 2018
Spider-Man: Homecoming," Spider-man joins the MCU
","Once Marvel acquired the rights from Sony for Spider-man, it was only a matter of time before Peter Park would join in the ranks of the MCU.Spider-man's origin story has been portrayed in so many different way by so many different actors and directors, thankfully Spider-man's earlier entry in 'Captain American: Civil War' made the writers skip the steps of Parker's radioactive spider biting journey and move on to the present times.'Spider-Man: Homecoming' follows the events after 'Civil War' portraying Peter Parker as an ordinary high school student training to one day become part of the Avengers while trying to survive the homecoming ball. The main villain is Adrian Toomes, known as The Vulture, who is entirely different than his portrayal in the animated series, as a bio-mechanical engineer and arms trafficker. Michael Keaton plays his third winged character in his career and does a terrific job as the Vulture! Robert Downey Jr. also makes an appearence as Peter's mentor, Tony Stark as well as Jon Favreau's Happy Hogan to the extension of a comic relief.Modern day society and social issues are heavily infused in the development of the characters, but ultimately it was about Peter Parker and his growth into a superhero by learning and feeling how it is to be respected and how it is to be despised.'Spider-Man: Homecoming' is a fun movie that follows the great Marvel superhero formula and is a great addition to the Marvel Cinematic Universe.",8,1,3,28 March 2018
Final Destination 2," Formulaic horror sequel
","Seeing the original movie that started this franchise, 'Final Destination' left me wanting more, but it spawned so many sequels it lost its touch and just became feed to the box-office machine. The sequel to it came quickly after the success of the first one, but I, myself, have not seen it until now and that is a lot of years apart from when I first watched the original.'Final Destination 2' continues the supernatural premonition nightmares through the eyes of A. J. Cook, who witnesses a massive accident on a highway, for which the consequences will lead to a series of unfortunate events.Unlike the first movie, the script for its sequel seemed flawed and did not give the same thrill and exhilaration, this time feeling more like an X-Files episode as its predecessor was meant to be in terms of quality and production values.All in all, for a horror sequel in the 00's, 'Final Destination 2' is a decent popcorn film.",5,0,0,28 March 2018
Justice League," DC needs to rethink its strategy
","DC's response to 'The Avengers', 'Justice League' should have been the film that would wash every unsuccessful attempt the gigantic comic book publisher ever displayed on-screen as a live-action superhero movie. Sadly, it just falls into the deep pit of every other work from the DC Cinematic Universe. 
I strongly believed in this movie before it came out, especially after the rave reviews of 'Wonder Woman', this should have set a new ground in terms of quality for DC.'Justice League' centers around a team of superheroes formed by Batman, played by Ben Affleck, in order to stop the menacing force crowned as Steppenwolf. Batman enlists the help of other people with special abilities, such as Wonder Woman, The Flash, Aquaman or Cyborg. Despite shaping up Earth's first line of defense, Steppenwolf withstands the mighty team. Now Batman is forced to find a new way to stop the menace and only one person could face up to the task at hand, Superman.The plot is a classic comic-book story that feels to have entered a little late in the superhero genre. If the movie was developed and released in the early stages, pre-Iron Man era, then I would have given it a pass, but in this age of ever-pouring comic-book movies year by year, it just doesn't stand up to the standards.
Aside from the main story, the script has been revised by Joss Whedon who's hand was seen throughout the movie, giving it a lighter more comical touch. This was a slight improvement to the DC Universe, but not enough to save the movie.Steppenwolf was really just a bland villain bringing absolutely nothing new to the table. The villain is an important part of the superhero movie process and they misfired once again after 'Suicide Squad'.Instead of following the Marvel formula by having each individual superhero origin story told first and only then connecting the storyline unto one epic stage like the 'The Avengers', DC rushed production by postponing several key characters' own films. There may have been slight hints in 'Batman vs Superman' of The Flash, Cyborg and Aquaman but not enough to make they're involvement aware to the audience. There is no true indication that Marvel's way is the only path to success and even so, DC still did not take the right approach.The casting and acting was great, Ben Affleck does an amazing job as Bruce Wayne, probably the second best live-action Batman portrayal after Michael Keaton. Ezra Miller, Gal Gadot and Jason Momoa also fit well within their character's personalities.'Justice League' had serious development troubles with two months of re-shoots and script rewriting, not to mention Henry Cavill's digitally removed mustache.Famed composer Hans Zimmer did not return to score the soundtrack after 'Batman Vs Superman' and was replaced by Danny Elfman, who in one way or another brought back the enjoyable theme song from 89's 'Batman'. Elfman's work matched the pace of earlier parts of the movie very well, but in the latter half, just like the script, it started to not amount to anything.I know that an 8/10 is a high rating, but even with all the above being said, I actually enjoyed the movie and I truly hope DC is going to learn from its mistakes and turn it all around with 'Justice League 2'. Marvel needs a big competitor and DC needs to step up its game.",8,0,0,2 April 2018
The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring," Epic high-fantasy tale for everyone!
","I, myself, spent my early childhood years watching Star Wars, thus I have and will always have a fondness for science-fiction. Then, throughout my formative years came the age of personal computers, internet and video games. This is were I first came across the fantasy world of the middle ages folklore. By that time I was already hooked, then came the epic high-fantasy trilogy, which is 'The Lord of the Rings' that completely shook me off my feet. Thought still at an young age, I was drawn by the beautiful backgrounds, long shots, the Sam-Frodo close-ups and of course, the unforgettable original score. A score which I hold as one of the best, if not the greatest, pieces of music ever made to suit such an extraordinaire trilogy. Then I started watching it year by year as I grew up, never once skipping a scene or speeding it up. Nowadays, every time I hear the theme song, my arm hair immediately rises up and I get goosebumps all over, together with the desire to watch it again as soon as possible. I have seen many movies in my life time, I embrace most of them and never regret seeing any of the others, but when it comes to 'The Lord of the Rings' series, I will always talk about it superlatively, with the first entry 'The Fellowship of the Ring' at it's helm. Kids and adults alike, do not stray away from this one!",10,0,0,18 August 2017
Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them," Welcome back to the wizardy wonders of Rowling's universe
","They couldn't just leave the Harry Potter universe and shelve it after 8 movies when it proved to be such a success amongst both children and adults alike, thus the 'Fantastic Beasts' prequels began developing with J.K. Rowling serving as a producer and a writer for the screenplay, putting pen to paper on how exactly she wants to mold the narrative and characters herself.'Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them' takes place in J.K. Rowling's Wizardly World and follows the adventures of Newt Scamander, a wizard and magizoologist, played brilliantly by Eddie Redmayne, who has a British fairy-tale charm to him that suits the main character to the tee. The movie has a well-bonded cast with the main highlights being Katherine Waterston as a down-to-earth witch and Dan Fogler as a mild-mannered No-Maj.
Unlike the other films of the Harry Potter franchise, this one is set in New York during the 20's and has a very different vibe then your commonly known Hogwarts grounds.While the spells aren't as complex or fun as the ones in Harry Potter, 'Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them' counters with various magical creatures to its lore, making it the perfect film for children.'Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them' continues on the magical stories of the overall franchise and it laid ground for new series of installments without the eponymous young wizard.",9,0,0,28 March 2018
It Follows," A curse that slowly and relentlessly gets to you
","David Robert Mitchell had a brilliant idea outlined for a horror film, one that has been commended for its originality leaving other modern films of the genre two steps behind.'It Follows' revolves around a young girl, Jamie, who spends her time with her boyfriend, Hugh. One night after a date, they get intimate in the car, when suddenly Hugh knocks her out unconscious by using chloroform. She wakes up tied to a chair in an abandoned building where Hugh explains to her that she is now cursed and that no matter when or where, a supernatural entity will slowly follow here until it reaches her and consumes her. It is revealed that the curse can be lifted if she has sexual relations with someone else, therefore passing the curse to the other person. From here on, with the help or her friends, Jamie tries to figure out what to do next.
Maika Monroe gave a great performance as Jamie, having the puzzled appearance of a teenager trapped with her own demons.The idea of an entity following you restlessly until it gets to you is great. The fact that it can appear as anyone at any time, family member or random person on the street, makes it even more scarier. My only concern is that the way it was transmitted, by sexual encounter, and the plot involving teenagers adds up to what's typically a horror movie cliche. Naturally, you will be expected to see a lot of dumb decisions of that nature throughout the film.The film's pace is slow accompanied by eery music and it loses its focus here and there giving the movie a prolonged and jarring feeling. It definitely has some good moments, like the fact that the audience doesn't know if the person that walks towards the cursed one is a normal human being or the supernatural entity. That right there brings out more scares and excitement than the overused jump scares.'It Follows' does not shape up in to a scary film, in a true 'cover your eyes' way, instead it gives a feeling of petrifying terror about to hit at any moment. Mitchell's subject is not for everyone's liking, but it can be a surprise for some.",6,0,0,6 April 2018
Star Wars: Episode VIII - The Last Jedi," A disappointing film that divided the fans
","I grew up with 'Star Wars', I venerated the original trilogy, I lamented at the sequel trilogy and I was given false hope for the prequel trilogy. 'The Force Awakens' led the new series with expectations of greater things, knowing that Mark Hamill would reprise his legendary role in the 8th episode. I came in with high amounts of optimism after reading the reviews for 'The Last Jedi', where critics praised it as one of the best of the franchise, being compared as an equal to the original films.This has been one of the hardest movies to watch as it completely shattered what Star Wars stands for and what Lucas has envisioned the universe to be. Kathleen Kennedy and Ryan Johnson, to put it simply, butchered the future of the franchise with this nonsensical film that's called an episode in the beloved series.
The lack and disregard of what has been done in the previous movies is beyond imagination. If they wanted to start fresh, they should have made a separate film in the extended universe, which ultimately is going to be done in Johnson's hands once more.I saw the ending of 'The Force Awakens', I saw the posters and trailers for 'The Last Jedi' and I could not wait to see Mark Hamill portray again the most powerful Jedi and my favorite fictional character, Luke Skywalker. To be clear, he did a fantastic job and in a perfect universe he might have been given an Oscar nod for his performance, but the way Luke is presented to us after 30 years of absence is just substandard. I am so disappointed in how he turned out from the beginning of the movie till end, a thing that Mark Hamill himself would later call out during interviews.There are many aspects of the script that made me raise my eyebrow more than a few times, like the casino heist subplot, General Leia's outer space triumph, the mystery of Rey's parents, the depiction of Snoke, just to name a few without handing out spoilers.There are good points about the movie, in the terms of special effects, that is where I actually saw Rian Johnson's touch from his past 'Looper' experience, but also assortment of amazing creatures and aliens which where interesting, even the Porgs, which were more or less a marketing gimmick.'Star Wars: Episode VIII - The Last Jedi' is one of the worst Christmas gifts I ever received and it's a stain on the franchise. The film's appraisal by the critics is only matched by the anger and criticism of the fans, splitting up the fan base in two. 
If you are a fan of Star Wars then I recommend seeing it, as you probably are familiar by now with misfortunes, starting with the prequels.",7,2,7,29 March 2018
American Made," A Tom Cruise jet fueled engine
","'American Made', a non-stop action film from the same pair of director-actor that delivered on 'Edge of Tomorrow', Doug Liman and Tom Cruise have proven once again that if they are put on the same set it will only turn out fantastic.The story of this biographic picture talks about real life pilot Barry Seal who gets hired by the CIA to collect intelligence in South America but ends up smuggling drugs for the cartel, and for non other than Pablo Escobar himself.
Tom Cruise plays the titular character and gives out of his best performances of his later career. The energy and fuel of Cruise's persona makes the movie a thrill ride for the viewer.
The fact paced editing and subject matter feel a bit like 'Catch Me If You Can' or 'The Wolf of Wall Street', but somehow you end up rooting for character this time.The script has wit, humor and its two hour running time will fly by without you even noticing.",8,0,2,28 March 2018
Wonder Woman," A decent origin story that brings DC on the right track
","'Wonder Woman' was received with high praises from critics, complementing the presence of a female-centric superhero movie. While there certainly is ambition into making this film, the story that it evolves around is just another generic 'superhero fights a forgettable villain'. The film was also surrounded by social movements and my recommendation is to watch the movie from your own perspective and make your own judgement.The film centers on Diana Prince, known as Wonder Woman, and her initial training in becoming a fierce Amazon warrior. The daughter of Hippolyta lives on the island Themyscira, a secluded paradise inhabited by women. Their whole idyllic way of life is disrupted when American pilot Steve Trevor crashes on the island. We later find out from him that outside of the island, there is an ongoing war, The Great War, that is consuming mankind. The golden heart princess sets off into London together with the pilot to stop the threat and fulfill her true destiny. The film tries to hide the story's plainness with a villainous twist, but ultimately is turns out like any other film of the genre.Gal Gadot is the perfect representation of Wonder Woman and does terrific in the action sequences. Chris Pine performs great as pilot Steve Trevor adding a lot of comical effect to the movie. The scenes with Gadot and Pine are especially great, as they are lighthearted and delightful.The script has a lighter tone than regular movies from the DC universe and it can be seen that DC is trying to change their style to better accommodate the general audience.The film's score was very good, in particular the main theme song, it really made you believe you were in the midst of the Amazonian people. This is something that's been missing from recent superhero movies, not having a suitable theme, a theme that could be recognized anywhere. Rupert Gregson-Williams did an excellent job and I hope he will continue on this path moving forward.'Wonder Woman' is one of DC's finest works soaring at the box-office, but in my opinion it doesn't stand up to the high praises its been given. In the end, it still felt like it missed the excitement of a well constructed superhero movie.",7,0,1,3 April 2018
Mother!," Spellbinding and highly creative piece of art
","Darren Aronofsky always turns heads whenever he releases a feature film. I can't believe that a completely original movie can still be made in today's Hollywood, it gives hope for the future generations of directors and producers. Aronofsky came after the contentious epic biblical film 'Noah', which took heavy hits from critics, to regroup his efforts and give another stab at his creative nature, only to yet again be questioned by critics.'Mother!' stars Jennifer Lawrence and Javier Bardem as a couple living in a battered, run down house in the middle of nowhere. Bardem's character is a poet who is struggling with writer's block and is hoping to recover by moving to this old crummy house secluded from society. His wife decided to support him and starts renovating the house room by room, piece by piece. One day, a couple of strangers, Ed Harris and Michelle Pfeiffer, knock on the door and they are let in without any second thoughts. From here on chaos slowly starts to ensure in ways that no one would suspect will carry on. 
The film starts slow, building up the tension of the main character's relationship, but after a third of the movie, things start to pick up and it is just spellbinding. There is about half an hour of non-stop madness that will leave you speechless, incapable of taking your eyes off the screen.All of the characters are unnamed, given just their position in the family, such a mother, man or son, leading to the impression of an eerie Garden of Eden setting, where later Lawrence would go on saying that her character is an allegory of Mother Earth and the film depicts the destruction of nature.The distinct sound editing makes 'Mother!' an interesting piece of film. Aronofsky decided to scrap the original soundtrack after seeing a rough-cut without music and instead focused on set-sounds from the landscape.The filming also offered us a different camerawork approach from the norm involving heavily of close-ups that may leave you dizzy when watching it on a big screen. 'Mother!' is controversial though-provoking film with deep philosophical and biblical undertones that should not be missed. It really is one of those movies where at the end of it you will either love it or hate it.",8,1,2,2 April 2018
Pocahontas," Disney's attempt at a historical event
","Inspired by the actual events from the life of Native American Pocahontas, the Disney writers wish to tell her story to all children around the world, but sadly filling the screenplay with historical inaccuracies, while keeping it's formulaic Disney princess approach and furry companions.'Pocahontas' fictionalizes the eponymous character's encounter with Englishman John Smith and the Jamestown settlers. While not having such immense impact as the two previous Disney animations, 'The Lion King' and 'Aladdin', 'Pocahontas' still provokes the mind and questions how and why the Natives where mistreated by the settlers. A quick answer would be the times when those events occurred, but that will never excuse the actions themselves.As with any Disney animated feature film, the songs are what everyone should be looking for, and 'Pocahontas' delivers with a beautiful original soundtrack, winning two Academy awards, one for the everlasting song 'Colors of the Wind'.'Pocahontas' is a good Disney movie, but it will not make the top ten list.",7,0,3,29 March 2018
Alien: Covenant," Less xenomorphs more androids
","With all the plot holes that 'Prometheus' had, I still hold it at a high place in the 'Alien' franchise and I have hoped that the sequel to it would be a better thought-out film. However, the latest installment does not bring anything new to the series, feeling like an episode of a science-fiction TV series at times.Ridley Scott comes back to direct what he created 40 years ago joined by acclaimed screenwriter John Logan, of 'Gladiator' and 'Hugo' and cinematographer and frequent collaborator Dariusz Wolski. Despite Scott's age, the veteran proves that he is still able to recreate the universe the once brilliantly displayed, with fast actions sequences and glorious special effects.'Alien: Covenant' is set eleven years after the Prometheus expedition centering on the colonization ship Covenant's course to build a new world on a remote, earth-like planet. Nothing is as it seems on this apparently inhabitable planet, as alien lifeforms viciously attack the crew of the Covenant.
Michael Fassbender takes on the dual role of synthetic androids David, the former crew member of Prometheus and Walter, a newer model. Fassbender's dead-pan robotic performance makes him once again the ideal candidate for this type of role.The set-pieces and production design were great, relying on props, traditional make-up and costumes rather than straight up special effects. This gave the film a proper serious science-fiction experience.The film's main story isn't one of the most imaginative narrative lines ever written down. It's really just another movie where a spaceship lands on a planet that turns out to be dangerous. The most troublesome part of it is that it doesn't include a lot of xenomorphs and it doesn't really connect to the 'Prometheus' idea of engineers being humanity's predecessors. It's more of a spiritual sequel because of the timeline and the 'accidental' appearance of David when it should have explained more the philosophical themes of creation.'Alien: Covenant' is a decent addition to the 'Alien' franchise, but does to enough justice to the series or to the lore.",7,0,1,3 April 2018
