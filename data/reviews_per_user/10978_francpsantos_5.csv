Vertigo," People say beauty is in the inside. In Vertigo, it's everywhere
","Apparently there's a reason why, in a medium where everything is extremely subjective, this film is always on the top for so many people. If I'm allowed to say, it is truly objectively a masterpiece. Usually when I watch a movie there is always that one scene that sticks with me afterwards. A few minutes in, the scene at Ernie's kicks in and I think to myself: This is it. But then there's the whole pursuit scene, the museum, the nightmare sequence, the final transformation of Judy in Madeleine, and so on, and so on. Everything is so beautifully engineered to elevate the tantalization of Madeleine that one can't help to participate in Scottie's obsession. James Stewart is stellar, as usual, but Kim Novak can just merge an uneasy eerie feel with that strong magnetism, while still keeping it convincingly real. And of course it had to come to that end. After all, life goes in cycles, right? All of this the fruit of an extremely well designed plot by the one and only Master of Suspense. Let him take the credit he deserves, but don't forget that the man surrounded himself with the right people. The cinematography by Robert Burks is, to this day, the closest I have seen to the meaning of 'every frame a painting'. I mean, I had never realized I wanted so badly to visit San Francisco (which almost feels like character in itself). And don't get me started one the score. Many say that, since Herrmann couldn't conduct the orchestra in this movie, it doesn't have the same feel. But honestly, it doesn't really matter to me. It is so well embedded into the plot, the characters, the scenery, that, just like the city of San Francisco, feels like a conscious character. Most of the times, this may go unnoticed to a great deal of people, but I dare anyone to try to watch this movie with no soundtrack and I assure you it won't be nearly as striking.'Only one is a wanderer; two together are always going somewhere'",10,4,4,8 November 2018
Battleship Potemkin," A lesson in editing a lot of film makers should learn nowadays
","The fact that I watched this laying in bed in a Sunday night, without loosing my attention or even falling into the embrace of Morpheus, already says a lot. For starters, the soundtrack is interesting a good way to engage you in the movie. Plotwise, it is an interesting story to contextualize the spirit of the Russian revolution. Albeit heavily propagandized, which sometimes may throw you off if you're not particularly crazy about the ideology, the plot still provides for some entertaining 75 minutes, while complementing what, to me, is the focal point of the film. The way ahead of its time editing and cinematography. It may not come to one's mind while watching the movie, but in a time when editing consisted in cutting and glueing film rolls together, it takes a tremendous amount of work to create a movie where some shots last less than a second. It is some common today, with digital film making, that it is easy to forget how big an accomplishment Battleship Potemkin is. This would, of course, be rendered forgettable if not used ingeniously by Eisenstein to immerse the viewer so deeply in the atmosphere of the story. After reading about his 5 methods of montage, it is clear how he uses every single one in the movie, and how much it serves to enhance the plot. If just watching the Massacre at Odessa scene, without over-analyzing, is already quite an experience, watching it again after knowing what's behind is an even further enriching experience. The cinematography is good as well, particularly in scenery of the port of Odessa, with great examples of high contrast and lighting. And again, this was 1925, and visually it is still miles ahead of a great deal of movies I see today. I am truly never tired of watching movies from this period, where the movie industry was not dominated by one single market, and I advise anyone to watch this movie to show that not all the great things in cinema were made in Hollywood.'Killed for a plate of soup'",9,3,4,12 November 2018
Léon: The Professional," Would say it's one of the best. But it is still damn good
","I fell like there is really not much to say about this movie. It has its ups and downs and I am not sure if it deserves all the praise that has been going around, but it is still a consistent good movie. It poses an interesting story and a different take at an action movie, in a decade when bad, over the top action movies were the thing. The performances are overall good, especially Jean Reno, as the ruthless assassin fatherly loving figure, and Natalie Portman, the character that we sometimes forget is a child. Gary Oldman gives all his heart, but his performance can only be as good as the one-dimensional villain he is portraying.
The story is, on one hand, well designed and different, specially the constant efforts of Léon to adapt to his new role of caretaker. Mathilda's constant uncomfortable approaches make it even better and are the clear result of a way too brief and dysfunctional childhood. On the other hand, it still falls sometimes into the predictability of the typical 'redemption arc' formula.
Overall a refreshing approach to the genre, with smart use of action and an engaging plot.",8,1,1,7 December 2018
The Assassination of Jesse James by the Coward Robert Ford," A gut wrenching essay on the vanity of greatness
","What struck me the most in this movie was the crude realization of how little control one has over their own fame. Along the story you learn to love and respect Jesse James, through the elegance and clouded mystery of the character, to the point of forgetting his true nature. You can't help but feel, like the rest of the crowd, resentment at Robert Ford (masterfully played by Affleck), just a man who, albeit not for the right motives, went through a conflicting journey to bring down a dangerous criminal. Maybe Jesse James never had the intention of turning into such a beloved legend and Ford surely wasn't expecting the label of coward. Celebrity culture is a dangerous playground and your will can only do so much. After some point, you're in the hands of a crowd who projects their own insecurities and deepest desires on others, loving the free and brave Jesse James and loathing Robert Ford, who killed an unarmed man. That's why I think that, above anything else, this move is a critique on the vanity and transience of the celebrity culture. I mean, that ending is nothing short of perfect.
The not so good aspects: it could generally be a bit shortened and the transition of Ford from admiration to resentment felt quite rushed, but that may require a second view because of the subtlety of Affleck's portrayal.
Of course this could not go without mentioning the tremendous work of Roger Deakins. The train scene alone is only one of the finest exemples of the use of lighting I have seen and the dreamlike blurred edges and chromatic aberration in some scenes are just sublime.
Props to Nick Cave and Warren Ellis as well for the haunting but not overwhelming soundtrack.'You know what I expected? Applause'",9,3,5,6 November 2018
Moonrise Kingdom," The movie form of that lovely old lady who always has the best childhood stories
","This is one of those nice little movies that people watch to feel immediately happy. In a typical 'Ã  la Wes Anderson' manner, the dreamy atmosphere and 'childlike' storytelling exude an almost campfire tale feeling. The style is on point, as expected, with great use of color and composition. In this aspect, there's nothing much to point out, given the well known creativity of Anderson and his unique style. May not be everyone's cup of tea, but the man certainly deserves the credit. The plot is not one of the strongest aspects of the movie. While being relatable to a good amount of people (as those 'odd one out' stories usually are), it feels somehow predictable, which, in turn, makes it a bit disengaging sometimes. Let us look, for example, at the scene on the church roof. Shortly, it fails to truly portray the sense of danger, because we already know Sam is probably going to be adopted by Captain Sharp, who, indeed, shows up to save the day. Nonetheless, the scenes in the beach camp are sublime and the narration by the cartographer is a subtle quirky way to deal with the oh so dreaded problem of exposition. The cast, of course, is stellar, but the performances are not mind-blowing, except, maybe for the two leads and Frances McDormand.Overall, it is a heart-warming movie that doesn't disappoint, if you know what to expect. Definitely worth a watch.''I love you, but you don't know what you're talking about'",8,0,0,12 November 2018
