Walk the Line," Top Notch! Can hardly wait for the DVD!!
","I have been a 'Man in Black' fan from day one (First heard I Walk the Line' in a country bar in Country Idaho in 1956). I have always thought he was the best! This movie is truly 'Johnny Cash'. It tells his story, from start to finish, and does very well at getting the intended information across. Some things that occurred in his life were left out in the interests of time, but that did not detract from the story line. One of the things that was left out was the information about who wrote some of the songs he sang (prisoners), and what his impact had on prisoners that he had dealings with. This movie is an excellent job. I can hardly wait for the DVD to come out!!!!",10,0,1,5 January 2006
