Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," Lucas lost it.
","Having seen the TPM three times now my opinion is that it was a disaster of a Star Wars film. Shockingly bad in parts, I believe the TPM has now seriously damaged the story of the prequels and infuriated many of the fans of the original films who expected to see a far superior film.The pacing of TPM was erratic. The film started far too fast - this was Episode One - where it all began- we needed an opening scene to remember - one that said 'this movie is going to be one of the greats.' (**Spoiler Alert**) But before we could settle into our seats Qui Gon/Obi Wan were already on our screens battling with their lightsabers while green aliens (The Viceroy- see later) engaged in confusing banter. A few minutes later having survived the forest scene and met that idiotic fool Jar Jar they're swimming towards an underwater city. Lucas wanted to cram so much into the 2 hours that it backfired and most likely left many viewers disoriented and lost. Silly music unnecessarily accompanied some of the scenes - an attempt to create a sense of emotion. Many directors these days appear to favour this strategy- sometimes silence is by far the most effective option.The Characters: Qui-Gon/Obi Wan: Lucas didn't develop them enough and they seemed cold and wooden (probably due to Lucas' direction rather than the actors themselves - who did well.) Anakin: Huge mistake committed here - basically the kid was far too cocky and self-assured such that it was difficult to like him. If Lucas had made him more vulnerable/insecure and introverted - it would have worked a lot better. One never feels that this is the future Darth Vader. At no point do you feel he is in danger (e.g. pod-race scene) and later on when he takes off in the fighter and destroys the ship (btw: this makes a mockery of all the missions of the previous films - I mean a 10 year-old kid taking it out by himself - ridiculous.)Jar Jar: This ridiculous character almost ruined the entire movie! Whenever he opened his mouth I cringed in embarrassment. I thought 'George, what have you done?' This gungan idiot with his incomprehensible dialogue and childish slapstick was a disgrace.The Viceroy: These guys were important characters as they were central to the plot - but they too were pathetic. They could have been much more sinister if they were human. Instead they were green cowardly weirdos with 'Charlie Chan' accents.The only 'alien characters' who were any good were Watto and Sebulba. Previous characters from the original movies (Jabba/Sand People/Jawas) were thrown in for the sake of it. Also Darth Maul needed to be in this a lot more - we learned nothing about the Sith.Great moments: Lightsaber duels - brilliant and any scene Darth Maul was in. Terrible moments (and there were many): Two-headed pod-race commentator/ kids talking/ Sand people behaving like a bunch of mischievous adolescents/seeing Mrs Jabba the Hut (with breasts)/ any scene Jar Jar was in.I hope Lucas can get his act together for Episode II - with serious plot, more character development, less computer animation and oh yes- more Star Wars theme music.",1,0,1,16 April 2000
Memento," Don't believe the hype
","This is nothing special and I find it hard to accept the high voting for this film. The ending is so unspectacular and a huge anti-climax. With the excessive amount of time-shifting with scenes not shown in chronological order - it just overly confuses and irritates. Pulp Fiction for example did a much better job of this, but here scenes were all over the place and made the film difficult to follow. I stuck with it thinking that the ending will make sense of it all and will be worth the wait- but that turned out be very disappointing. Yes it has some clever moments in it but one viewing was enough for me-the film just doesn't interest to justify watching it again.",4,6,10,13 August 2007
Alien: Resurrection," A truly awful Alien movie
",This film makes Alien 3 look good. One word for Alien Resurrection  - GARBAGE. The Alien series stopped at Aliens - forget 3 and especially this last feeble effort. Full of wise-cracks/unnecessary gore and very little suspense - then how could you generate suspense about an Alien species that by then we knew so much about. This film should never have been made. My advice is to buy the original on DVD.,3,1,1,5 January 2001
Rocky V," Disastrous end to the series
",This was such an awful Rocky movie. Rocky returning to where he began and wearing the same old clothes as in the original - oh dear. A tacky promoter who was a blatant Don King rip-off raving on about his fighter 'Union Kane.' That name made me laugh at this garbage of a film - one of many laughs I should add. Rocky V should never have been made in the first place and that sound-byte 'Go For It' - ultra cheesy.,4,1,4,16 April 2000
Ocean's Twelve," A truly awful sequel
","This was a shambles, a terrible follow on from the first film which is far superior. Most of the team members do nothing in this and are just twiddling their thumbs throughout the whole movie! Danny Ocean plays second fiddle to Brad Pitt's character, Andy Garcia is there to make up the numbers along with Julia Roberts, who turns up at the end in a disgraceful and ridiculous ego-massaging scene with Bruce Willis!!! Catherine Zeta Jones? - get out! I hated the fact her character was made out to be cleverer than everybody else. I started losing interest in the difficult-to-follow bizarre plot after about 40 minutes. The original film had a simple idea - rob the casino vault, with everyone doing their part in the outrageous heist... this however, is just a mess. My advice is to avoid this completely.",2,0,2,13 August 2007
Rocky IV," Ridiculous, entertaining.... but not true to the originals.
","As a kid, Rocky IV was the film I most wanted to see in the cinema - ever!! The hype was huge - I dreamt about the movie before even seeing it! I remember the aura surrounding the huge mysterious new bad guy in Drago and the rumours that Apollo gets killed.Watching it as an adult though is obviously an entirely different experience. The film has dated mainly due to the anti-USSR overtones - but then this was made in the mid 80's cold-war era. It is laughable at times, what with Paulie's talking robot - the ridiculous press conference before Rocky v Drago, the sports scientists and their massive 80's computers and all the stereotypical portrayals of Russians and KGB agents - hey even ex-president Gorbachev(complete with stained forehead) is in it!! Then there are the silly pop-video type scenes, the poor acting from the boxers' wives, and that cheesy final scene with Rocky's kid and friends watching the fight on TV (btw: poor casting of Rocky's son - both his parents are Italian-Americans yet the boy here wasn't -an indication of the lack of attention to detail and slipping standards in the Rocky series.)The best thing about Rocky IV are the 2 fights, although totally unbelievable and the training scenes. Hats off to Dolph Lundgren, Stallone and Carl Weathers for getting into such fantastic physical shape for this film - it will probably inspire you to hit the gym and has that feel-good factor like Rocky III did.",6,0,0,3 June 2005
Spider-Man," Entertaining flick that hits and misses
","Overall, this was an above-average effort at transforming Spider-Man the comic superhero into his movie counterpart. Given all the hype of the film though, I was a touch disappointed with this first part of a probable 3 episode series. It was entertaining stuff but at times the film seemed to fall between a romance/drama flick (emphasised by the nature of the ending) and a superhero action flick. Throughout Peter Parker was portrayed way too nerdy and besotted with the girl. Another actor -less geeky would have been a better choice than Tobey Maguire. There were too many sentimental scenes for this genre of movie- Spiderman's famous sense of humour was completely discarded-hopefully this side of his character will be developed in the sequel. I'd prefer this any day to the 'blubbing' Parker that was seen here. The character played by Kirsten Dunst was iffy- portrayed as a materialistic, boyfriend-changing, Broadway wannabe who by the end is deeply 'in love' with the nerdy Parker. This didn't really work and seemed contrived. The pacing was erratic at times - a measured build-up to develop the characters and introduce Spiderman...good, but then within seconds of film-time he's 'well known' by everybody in New York City (this worked well in Ghostbusters '84 -but not here!) Also the Green Goblin character was a bit of a mystery-and what was with the ridiculous mask?! The best moments were when Spidey was in action- kicking ass,swinging through the avenues of Manhattan, posturing athletically- basically being a superhero. The special effects were good and Spiderman's acrobatics-enthralling, along with a mix of some really humourous moments and some great action scenes. The best characters in the movie were the ones who 'had character' -Parker's uncle, Willem Dafoe's Dr Osborne and the newspaper editor Jamison. Look forward to Spiderman II. Overall rating 7/10.",7,0,0,23 May 2002
Transformers," Ruined by inexplicably bad directing and full of horrible and tedious pop culture moments
","Having never watched the Transformers cartoons in the 80's I'm no fanboy, but I remember as a boy the Transformer toys and the cool autobot/decepticon logos. With very little info about the film but aware of the relatively high votes this had received from IMDb users, I went to the cinema expecting to see, for once a quality 'summer blockbuster'.Just before walking in I saw a flyer about the film and it mentioned the director being Michael Bay who directed 'Armageddon' and 'Pearl Harbour'.....and I thought 'Oh-oh, this could be a terrible omen for the movie I was about to see'After about 15-20 minutes, my respect for the movie was already in danger of dissipating and had already lost 2 points out of 10 vote-wise. Why? Teenagers.... nauseating adolescents with raging hormones and big mouths on screen trying to look cool, meanwhile soldiers on the other side of the world...annoying grunts are trying to be macho and blurting out banal lines, one of them talks to himself in Spanish, another blurts out 'Speak in English'- 'its my heritage, man' he responds, another mentions the wife and baby 'waiting for him back home' -cliché -whom they cut to in one of many completely unnecessary scenes that punctuate this flick. Pentagon officials and other 'hangers-on' walking around being extremely important, 'Mr President' blah blah-how many times do we see this in Hollywood movies! And the film takes the audience from one scene to the next- no story, no introduction, no relevance. Later the film relies on Optimus Prime narrating the backdrop to the story when Megatron first landed on Earth in the last century....why couldn't they have started with this instead?The casting for the main characters and their initial interactions on screen were terrible! We have this so annoying highly-strung teenage boy who's obsessed with a girl (she's just there for eye candy) and the audience have to endure SO MANY sexualised gratuitous camera shots of him checking her out, shots of her cleavage and derriere and close-up shots of her face taking up the whole screen- Michael Bay seemed to have a personal fixation with her! I was thinking 'I've come to see Transformers, if I want to watch a bunch of teenagers talking garbage, ogling over each other and planning how they are going to get laid, I'll just rent 'American Pie' on DVD.-Be warned, I am not joking- there are some excruciatingly bad and out-of-place scenes for this genre of film. The long farcical scene at the boy's house that has got to be one of the worst I have seen for a long time in a big-budget movie, where all the Transformers are outside 'hiding' with a silly conversation taking place between the boy and his parents in his bedroom and where a reference to 'Masturbation' is made not once, but about 3 times!!! Can you believe it? Everyone in the cinema cringed in embarrassment thanks to this piece of crass and gratuitous directing. I felt for the parents who went with their kids (this was a 12 certificate) and who probably came out with that one line ringing in their ears with little Johnny asking them what masturbate means. Then you get the secret services turning up at the house, with John Turturro doing almost a parody of an FBI agent- he is later stripped to his underwear and handcuffed to a street lamp post in another ridiculous scene (I kid you not!) Why the pathetic attempt to inject moments of humour and the rubbish one-liners? Just cut it out- as most of it fell flat on it's face. Check the scene, when the autobot comes out of the back-garden swimming pool with the little girl standing there...the camera closes in on her for the inevitable one-liner.... I thought- 'no don't do it'....as she says 'Are you the tooth fairy?' - Christ...knock another point off. Btw- no-one laughed in the theatre.The teenagers were so irritating that killing them off would have been a highlight, and what was with the totally irrelevant sub-plot about the girl having a criminal record? Who cares?!!Two other wastes of space are the Pentagon code analyser (who comes across as just some young Australian model who's there as eye-candy number two) and her 'In Da Hood hysterical fat Hacker friend' (of course such natural sidekicks). An old Jon Voight is pasted in here as a Defense Secretary in attempt to add some credibility to it all, but he comes across as worn and tired. Other cringe-making moments: Optimus Prime refers to the 'WWW and E-bay', violin music playing during a silly emotional-meant scene between the boy-hero and autobot Bumblebee who's been partially destroyed, fat hacker from 'da hood' freaks out in the FBI interrogation room, rock music inexplicably accompanying some of the action sequences, a soldier trying to phone in air support is connected to some nerdy type call centre worker in India! Absolutely disgraceful and I would have laughed if I hadn't forked out money to watch this.On the only positive note the action sequences are spectacular and the special effects are top class, especially the way the autobots/decepticons transform during their battles. I give all 3 points for this alone. I wasn't too sure about the way Megatron was portrayed though, as he didn't appear to be true to the version I remember from the 80's- his design looked too insect-like and he talked like that tree character from Lord of the Rings. The only redeeming parts of the film are when the Transformers are on screen and it's a shame the film doesn't focus on them more as they far outshine the human characters in this extremely disappointing and tatty film.",3,12,23,23 August 2007
Star Wars: Episode III - Revenge of the Sith," End of the prequel disaster...
","*Spoilers ahead* For me this film was confirmation that the prequels should never have been made (well...not by George Lucas) I entered the cinema with low expectations after Lucas' first two disastrous efforts and really just watched it for completion's sake.The obscene use of CGI effects was as expected and although impressive to begin with, soon became gratuitous and repetitive as the screen was just a constant flurry of activity. The only let-ups happened when there were cuts to (yet again!)boring conversations between Jedi, Palpatine-Anakin, Anakin-Padme, which badly interrupted the flow and pace of the film. Lucas - you just don't learn...unbelievable. Lucas doesn't let the viewer use their imagination at all and had to show everything possible including a childbirth scene and Anakin being mutilated and burnt alive (a disturbing scene for a Starwars film). Yes, this film is darker then the others, but takes itself way too seriously for this genre of movie.The dialogue between Palpatine and Anakin was excruciatingly pedestrian and just awful. Wookies were thrown in just for the hell of it - they did very little and Chewbacca's big moment was saying goodbye to Yoda as he made his way into 'exile' - (with the music from 'Yoda's Theme' playing in the background) pathetic George, really pathetic. The word 'youngling' was used by Obi-Wan to refer to young Jedi - embarrassing and a disgrace that this didn't end up on the cutting floor.Midiclorians cropped up again, just like aliens talking cartoonish English, the Viceroy (who were finally butchered - a rare highlight of the film), oh and the droids(R2 and 3po) were to have their memory's wiped -how convenient George -to tie up that gaping plot hole from the originals ...when the droids shouldn't have been in these prequels to begin with. And why was Palpatine made to look like a vampire from the 1987 film- The Lost Boys? General Grevious was the new bad guy in town, although quite entertaining (apart from that silly coughing?!)- I don't think he belonged in a StarWars film. Now imagine if Darth Maul hadn't been killed off in the first, this would have been the chance for a long awaited climactic duel-to-the-death rematch with Obi-Wan. This lack of focus and development of a principal villain throughout has hurt these prequels. Obi-Wan v Maul, OW v Jango, OW v Dooku and now OW v Grevious -result: no one really cared because we didn't get to know any of the bad guys. Lucas should have stuck with Maul and fleshed out his character, then Obi-Wan finally killing him off in EpIII would have a brought cheers in the cinema and some positive feeling about something!! Yoda by now had become an irritating know-it-all, blurting out the usual confusing one-liners. Anakin turns to the dark side far too easily and when we finally see him as Vader his first utterance is something like 'Where's Padme?' - hilarious- comical rubbish and sacrilege -George. Thankfully its all over - pretend they don't exist next time you watch the originals -although that will be very hard now.",4,37,71,31 May 2005
Gladiator," Entertaining...but not a great 'Roman Epic.'
","Russell Crowe - very good performance. Great fight/battle scenes/tiger shots etc and even the special effects worked well - cool shots of the Colosseum. The film however lacks the quality of other Roman epics such as 'Spartacus.' Apart from Russell Crowe and Richard Harris, the other members of the cast weren't too impressive.(perhaps due to poor dialogue and lack of character development).Contrast this to Spartacus - Kirk Douglas, Jean Simmons, Laurence Olivier, Tony Curtis, Charles Laughton and of course the fantastic Peter Ustinov (best supporting actor Oscar) - what a cast! Yet again like so many other films - music was unnecessarily included in scenes where silence would have been far better. Especially that early scene in the film (*spoiler alert) where Marcus Aurelius tells his son (the irritating Commodus) that he will not become Emperor. What follows is is a way-over-the-top emotionally charged sobbing scene with highly dramatic music involving two characters we hardly know. Its as if Ridley Scott is shouting at us 'You must feel emotion here!' - ridiculous - the viewer doesn't care about Commodus at this stage of the film! - it made me cringe instead. Btw: What was with all those 'flashbacks'?The choice of music was iffy at times and the 'incest' overtones - how did that help the film? The character of Commodus was poor - extremely annoying at times (like a brat) and cowardly. Apart from all that it was an entertaining film - it was an epic in terms of duration but not in quality. 7/10.",8,0,0,20 May 2000
