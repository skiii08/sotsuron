Scarface," 80s Classic
",From the voice over at the beginning to the iconic ending this movie keeps you glued to your screen during its almost 3 hours (which is quite a feat) watching how Tony's ambition drives him to tragedy. Great performances from all the cast especially Pacino who does one of the best jobs of his career. Everything in the movie makes you feel like you are living in the 80s in the fast paced Miami (although the majority of the film was filmed at LA) and particularly thanks to the amazing soundtrack by the legendary Giorgio Moroder. With all the right pieces its no wonder this movie has become a genre classic and Tony Montana a pop culture icon.,10,2,4,2 April 2016
