Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," As the Austin Powers trailer said 'If you only see one movie this year, see Star Wars. . . .'
","George Lucus does it again.  Expectations were high given the film making technology which has become available since the original 3 movies -  and I wasn't disappointed.  This is equally as good as the first 3.Acting was good, and the fight scenes were very well coreographed and executed.  Just a pity there weren't a few more of them.The only annoyance was Ewan McGreggor's awful English accent.As the Austin Powers trailer said 'If you only see one movie this year, see Star Wars. . . .'",10,0,0,14 August 1999
Blade," Buffy with Attitude
","Good action film with Wesley Snipes playing a 'good' guy vampire who is out to kill as many other vampires as he can.But things get a bit complicated when he saves a (female) doctor from one of the bad guys after she's been bitten.  Things progress, and it looks like the end of the world is coming, with Blade being both the key, and the saviour.DVD has alternate ending which fortunately wasn't used, and it's a good job too otherwise the ending sequence would have been terrible.",9,0,1,16 January 2000
Blade," Good film, good storyline, plenty of action.
","Very good film.  Plenty of action, with lots of blood (but not over the top), but then that was expected being as the film has  vampires as a main theme.I though it had a predictable story line but with some good touches too, which was unexpected, and as always the 'good' 'guy' won.  Although for a change some of the bad guys actually had brains as well.Plus there weren't lots of 'special super weapons' which seem to take over in a lot of sci-fi type films these days.  I liked that his primary weapon was a 'simple' sword, with a few other bits and pieces thrown in for good measure.",9,0,1,14 June 1999
