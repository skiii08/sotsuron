Raiders of the Lost Ark," The Return Of The Great Adventure...
","'Either of you guys ever go to Sunday School?' - Indiana Jones brings Eaton & Musgrove's church attendance records into question in 'Raiders of the Lost Ark'. From the director of 'Jaws' and the creator of 'Star Wars' comes the adventure film that all others in its genre are held up to, 'Raiders of the Lost Ark'. After twenty-three years and counting, I can honestly say that the film has yet to be outmatched (sure there have been good action/adventure films since 'Raiders', including its own sequels, but I haven't seen a film that has had an indeliable, definitive impact that 'Raiders' has left in a long time, possibly since the original 'Star Wars') Hired by the U.S. Government, archaeologist/adventurer, Indiana Jones is on a race against evil to retrieve the lost Ark of The Covenent, the chest that contains the original stone tablets of the Ten Commandments. The ones that Moses brought down from Mount Harab and smashed. When was the last time YOU went to Sunday School!? Along the way Indiana meets up with an ex-girlfriend of his, Marion Ravenwood, outraces and dukes it out with legions of Nazis, and has plenty of close calls including a truck chase, The Well of Souls and its snakes (& Indiana's deathly phobia of them), a slugfest with a mechanic and his flying wing, and the opening of the Ark itself (lets just say GOD isn't to happy when mortals decide to open the Ark & sift through its contents). An absolute modern-day classic. Why? 'Raiders'' opening, from the Paramount logo to the natives chasing Dr. Jones, the bar fight, the basket chase, The Well of Souls, the truck chase (that alone gets 5 stars), the opening of The Ark in all its glory, John Williams' Oscar nominated score, I could go on all day long, but, you get the drift. What gives the film its drive (and where the sequels fail) is the urgency & danger of retrieving the Ark and the competitiveness between Indiana Jones and the Frenchman, Renee Belloq (the film imposes, early on, that these two have been competitors since there college days). I got this on cassette for Xmas 1984 and I burnt the tape out. Thank God for DVD. Nominated for 8 Oscars including Best Picture, Director (Steven Spielberg), Original Score and winning 4 of those awards including Best Sound & Visual Effects. The American Film Institute ranks 'Raiders' as one of the top 100 films of all-time and Indiana Jones as one of the top cinematic heroes second only to Atticus Finch from 'To Kill A Mockingbird'. The truck chase wasn't directed by Spielberg (he did the close-ups afterwards), but was helned by second unit director, Norman Reynolds. Tom Selleck was originally cast to play Jones but had to back out due to contractual agreements with Universal and CBS for 'Magnum P.I.' (I think it would have been a different film. I saw a 'Raiders' screen test with him and Sean Young and he came off very obnoxious). Danny DeVito was offered the role for Sallah but declined due to scheduling conflicts with 'Taxi'. The scene where the Nazi officer was supposed to shoot Sallah was filmed but couldn't be used, because of black smoke from burning tires in one take, and in another actor John-Rhyes Davies getting sick and filling his jallaba (and he didn't care one bit). 'Raiders of the Lost Ark' is one truly great adventure worth taking over & over again. No matter what George Lucas calls it.",9,0,1,18 September 2008
American Beauty," I want to look good naked
","-Lester Burnham is a great example of how sex or the promise of sex can change a man's life. When we meet him, his life is PAINFULLY ordinary. He works a poop job that he hates, he leads a sexless marriage with his wife that he has no love for anymore, whacking off in the shower is his high point and his daughter hates him. His life seems to be going downhill fast till he goes to his daughter's school function and falls for her cheerleader friend Angela. He has fantasies about her, which all somehow include rose petals. He decides that in order to have a chance with Angela he must start working out so he can look good naked. This begins to trigger a change in his life as he begins to do all the things he's always wanted do. He quits his job and gets a new one flipping burgers, buys himself a pretty sweet car and he begins to take charge of his life. All seems to be going well for good ol' Lester till his homophobic neighbor gets the wrong idea and does something horrible to our hero. -Who knew that an average looking town filled with seemingly average people could make such an interesting story. Alan Ball did and thank goodness he had such a sick and twisted mind to write this great story. Fans of the great and badly missed 'Six Feet Under' will no doubt recognize all the weird Alan Ball signature in this movie that he translated into the TV show. From the weird fantasies to regular people, doing weird things is all Alan Ball at his best. I'm guessing if I were to peek into his mind I wouldn't find a happy man leading an ordinary life like the characters he comes up with seem to be. Considering the tone of the movie and just how f***king creepy the opening is one would think this would be a serious movie but it has more laughs than the crap that get passed as comedies nowadays. -The best filmmakers always somehow seem to be a smidge overweight and the brilliant Sam Mendes continues that unhealthy trend. i guess i have to gain a couple if i ever want that golden statue. Mendes has this great obsession with simplicity that goes hand in hand with Ball's quirky script. Most filmmakers would probably go ever board with the story and turn the dark humor into slapstick but Mendes keeps his cool and in the process makes the movie better for it. I've only seen three of his movies and this is best yet. I just love how he took things that looked simple in Ball's script like the paper bag caught in the wind and made it into something beautiful like the way it is in the movie now. Can't wait for his next potential masterpiece. the late great Conrad L. Hall will always be remembered as one of the great DP's of our time and this movie as one of his best looking. Much like Mendes the cinematography is very simple and has many hidden messages if you looked closely or watched the movie 1000 times. -One thing I love about this movie is the nail biting suspense in the last act. I just love the scene when Chris Cooper goes up to Spacey and you just don't know what this crazy man is going to do. Is he going to kill him, punch him or kiss him? I've never had a movie do that to me before and I really loved it. Really gets you into the movie. Giving his best performance yet is Keyer Soze as Lester Burnham. he's a man that want more in life and his transformation from boring normal everyday life to happy and content is captured wonderfully by Spacey. If memory serves me right then I believe the hicks at the academy gave him an award for this. It caused some controversy as many people thought that crown should have gone to Denzel. -Thora Birch dose a brilliant job of playing the Goth like Jane who despite her short screen time manages to capture you and really makes you feel for her character although she does get whiny like a lot of us around that age. this and 'Ghost World' are the best acting jobs she's done and I hope she gets more jobs that showcase her talents. Mena Suvari does the job of the insecure seductress really well. I love how her character isn't all one dimensional as we learn more about why she puts on such a shallow exterior. Chris Cooper plays the homophobic army man nicely so does his wife whose played by an unrecognizable Allison Janney. With a dad that's so uptight and a mother that's virtually dead you'd expect their offspring to be a stiff but instead of that we get a dope dealing DV obsessed boy played by Wes Bentley who looks WAY too old to be in high school. What high schooler has a 5 o'clock shadow? -it won a lot of Oscars and got a lot of buzz and it deserved every bit of it.",9,0,1,5 September 2009
The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers," Orcs, Uruks, and bombs, oh my!
","This film starts at a running speed and never stops. From watching Gandalf battle the demonic balrog to the collapse of Isengarde and everything else in between, there is hardly room to catch your breath - and it is wonderful. Add to the surviving fellowship a new and wonderful group of people, the Riders of Rohan, who I have always been fond of - and of course the gnarly old Ents: tree people who are shepherds of the trees, keeping them in order, in their places in the forest. The climax of the film is the huge double battle of Helm's Deep and the battle of Isengarde. I have found it most interesting that in sopite of talk of wizards and Elves, Tolkien's world is not one of magic. Elves seem to possess great longevity, but also an advanced technology implied rather than discussed. And while there is a certain power among wizards, an example of Saurman's 'magic' is no more mysterious than the ability to utilize gunpowder, no doubt high tech to Middle Earthers, and mysterious enough to seem magical. (In the books, the Elves explained to Sam that some of their skills could have been learned by even a humble hobbit had they the time to study them) For me, the battle of helm's Deep was always one of the slower moving parts oif the original books; but here, it is fast-moving and chock full of nail-biting action. As usual, certain compromises between text and film are made, and the one part that does not sit well with me is the character of Faramir. This was not the Faramir of Tolkien, and the character is never quite well realized. But also as usual, the settings are wonderfulthe acting superb, and the music breathtaking. The principle characters who are new, or may as well be new, include the sad princess Eowyn, her Uncle King Theoden, her brother Eomer, and the slithery traitor, 'Wormtongue'. And, of course, the ruined Hobbit known by all as 'Gollum'. Gollum threatens to steal the show, all the more so because he is a CGI character, brilliantly 'portrayed' by Andy Serkis. Once you've watched the extended version, you will never watch the theatrical release again. This extended version is much more Tolkienseque, more complete, and more fun.",6,0,6,18 September 2008
Toy Story," You can never go wrong with Woody and Buzz Lightyear!
","10 years. 20 years. It will be 50 years and this movie won't get old. It doesn't matter that animation is 100 times more detailed and cooler today than it was in 1995, when the movie first came out. The strength of this movie is in the story. There is so much territory to explore on this flic, and you have so much fun while you watch it, that you will never grow tired of it. And, with a 2.5-year old who loves to see Woody once and again, I can tell you it really doesn't get old, no matter how many times you watch it! The second disc does a superb job of accompanying the Pixar classic, going into the legendary details that have made Pixar's DVDs famous. There is plenty to sink your teeth into, for the die-hard fans and those who are simply a bit curious alike. The entire package is a movie for all ages, for the ages. Get it and enjoy it once and again. The truth is you can never go wrong with Woody and Buzz Lightyear!",9,0,0,1 October 2008
There's Something About Mary," Just Wild About Mary
","This is the Farrelly brothers' masterwork following their other great comedies, 'Dumb and Dumber' and 'Kingpin'. At this film's heart it's just a sweet love story, leavened with scenes of low humor. The Farrellys navigate successfully the fine line between being laugh-out-loud funny and just plain gross superbly. They are abetted by a superb cast. Ben Stiller's nebbishy character get's tiresome in a lot of his films but he is somewhat endearing here. Cameron Diaz is effervescent here as the object of everybody's affection. Matt Dillon has never been better as the sleazy private detective(where's he been lately?). This film may have been a case of the Farrellys being too successful because their subsequent efforts have fallen short of the mark(though I'm one of the few champions of 'Me, Myself, and Irene'. It's not as bad as some would say). On a final note if anybody's interested in who the minstrel is who provides running commentary throughout the film his name is Jonathan Richman. Richman and his band the Modern Lovers made a classic self-titled rock album in 1972. Richman was something of an eccentric. After the cult success of their initial album, Richman eschewed rock music and went on to make children's records. If anybody's interested though, the Modern Lovers' first album is well worth checking out.",6,2,4,2 October 2008
Die Hard with a Vengeance," This Modern Day Cowboy is Getting Old.
","DIE HARD: WITH A VENGEANCE is the third installment in the Die Hard series and finds our beloved cop hero, John McClane, at home in New York City. The brother of the lead terrorist that McClane got rid of in the first film, seems to have a personal vendetta to settle with McClane. Simon (Jeremy Irons) has McClane perform all sorts of life-endangering stunts for his amusement. One stunt involves McClane wearing a very racist sign stark naked in Harlem. He is saved there by a local store owner, Zeus (Samuel L. Jackson) who because of his Good Samaritan deed, inadvertedly becomes a part of the plot. Actually, Simon is just using his hatred of McClane as a cover for his real plot, to steal the Federal Reserve in NYC. Whereas the original DIE HARD was a guy's romance (lots of action all to save the girl), DIE HARD: WITH A VENGEANCE is a buddy movie. The pairing of Willis and Jackson is genius and the comraderie and verbal wit between the duo is pure delight. The movie has a great deal of action but doesn't have as tight script as the original DIE HARD. It tries to make up for that with bigger explosions and action scenes. Of course sometimes bigger isn't always better. Some of the early scenes were so realistic that this movie was postponed for a few months because of the Oklahoma City bombing. After 9-11, some may find some of the scenes to be uncomforting, unsettling, and hitting too close to home. But keep in mind, this movie was made when Hollywood kept feeding us the myth--that we all wanted to believe-- that terrorism could never happen to us. Other than the scenes that some may find unsettling and a loose script, the other drawback of the film is that McClane is separated from his beloved wife Holly, which just doesn't fit the DIE HARD formula. The first two films were guy romances which made them enduring. This picture has taken that romantic element out and attempted to replace it with the buddy angle. It works, but it isn't as enduring. Whereas in the first two movies, McClane was saving the world to save his wife, in this movie he's saving the world to save his life.",8,1,2,10 September 2009
