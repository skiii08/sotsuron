10 Cloverfield Lane," Turned Sour
","The whole movie was an awesome experience... almost. What ended up slightly ruining it was the ending. Without watching any of the Cloverfield movies, it definitely takes you by surprise. The idea of the 'chemical attack' being perpetrated by foreign military in of itself was already a super cool concept. Instead... it was aliens, and that left a bad taste in my mouth. It made it almost tacky. Besides the ending, the rest of the film is amazing and would totally watch again.",9,1,2,23 July 2018
