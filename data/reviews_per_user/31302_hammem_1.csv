Alien 3," Great movie not understood??
","I just don't get it...not the movie - the reviews. So this is rather an attempt to do some justice to the movie. Maybe here in SVK we could experience a different cut (*SPOILER*...the one where Ripley gives 'birth' to a baby alien when falling down *SPOILER END*) but even the other one is not really that bad. I loved the different atmosphere in every single movie in the series. The first one was a great sci-fi horror movie, the second one was a great action movie and the third one (exactly the point where the series should have ended) was more psychological horror. The atmosphere in the movie is just heavy (tehre's no better word for that), very sad and frightening. I love that it is very different from the previous movies, I love the ending, I love the plot which is very similar yet still different. And I still don't get how someone could rate it with 1/10...",9,3,3,6 May 2011
