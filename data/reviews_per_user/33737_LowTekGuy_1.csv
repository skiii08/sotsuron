10 Cloverfield Lane," Put 3 Actors in a Room and Make a Movie!
","I don't know about the extended Cloverfield mythos and so forth, but sticking three actors in a room and expecting a gripping theatrical movie to result--well, that's ambitious. So this film deserves massive respect for doing a lot with very little in the way of space, budget, etc. It's a 'stage play on film,' and as with any narrow-band sci-fi story, you wonder if there will be contrived situations, melodramatic character quirks, and outlandishly convenient coincidences. But if you're willing to be just a tiny bit generous to the filmmakers you will marvel at how adroit it is, and love how much confidence it has in its own believability. Kudos to John Goodman, who goes enthusiastically over-the-top, making his character a 900-pound gorilla trapped in a phone booth with two squirrels. Good for him. We're going to be staring at this guy for 90 minutes, so don't be boring. He's crazy, but is he CRA- zy? Either way, he nails it. This movie is never obvious, and stays more than air-tight enough through its series of underground twists and turns. Gotta respect a tense locked-room thriller that has the guts to be a sci-fi movie too!",7,1,3,18 April 2016
