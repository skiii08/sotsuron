The Twilight Saga: Breaking Dawn - Part 1," It's not as bad as everyone thinks it to be.
","you know..for what it's worth.i think although the movie is cliché, it was better than the other three movies and i think you guys should watch it with an open mind .it wasn't that bad. imagine watching a chick flick like Material Girls and honestly you guys think that Breaking Dawn part 1 is bad? seriously? many people are judging it way too harsh man...partly i think because the first three was bad and yeah i'm not a twilight fan.i just think breaking dawn part 1 deserves a better rating than 3.8, don't you think? And let's be honest, the movie is boring for some people but then if you realized, Stephanie Meyer didn't exactly put in much action in the book either so yeah. i thought it was pretty good for a clichéd movie and i was entertained. a good movie to watch on a lazy day.. so what if it's cliché? many other movies are clichéd as well.that didn't stop people for rating other clichéd movies better than it is.Don't be prejudiced against this movie.",Null,20,39,18 November 2011
