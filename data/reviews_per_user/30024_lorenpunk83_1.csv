Iron Man 3," Home Depot man vs. a crippled human torch
","I had huge expectations from seeing Ironman fight Thor, Loki, And the Chitauri in the last installment. Then I see this movie where Tony's suit break apart every five minutes, and I'm thinking, 'What the French, TOAST!' I did not see one good fight scene. I'll say it one more time a little more clearly, I DID NOT SEE ONE GOOD FIGHT SCENE IN IRONMAN 3. I mean Tony spent the whole movie with nothing, then he stormed the main bad guy's house in a Home Depot suit. When he should've just deployed all his suits in the beginning of the movie on the helicopters! I just hope this Ironman never has to fight the actual Mandarin seeing how ironman got his butt whipped by a guy like the Human Torch (who couldn't fly). In my head I'm saying, 'Isn't ironman the one who captured Loki, saved S.H.E.I.L.D's helicarrier, held his own against Thor, beat the crap out of those flying Chitauri giant beast, and saved the world?! Why is this scumbag beating him?!?!' Last words Weaksauce!",6,4,8,4 May 2013
