Walk the Line," 'Love is a burning thing'
","I liked the movie very much. I honestly can say that I loved everything about it: the actors, the music, the plot line, the directing and filming and, of course, that it is biographical movie devoted to famous rock and roll performer Johnny Cash. This love story between June and Johnny Cash is incredible and the way it was shown in the film took my breath. Two people struggling for happiness and the man fighting for love are incredible. The music is also great, you listen you want to dance and sing along.
 Especial thanks to the actors. Joaquin Phoenix and Reese Witherspoon are just incredible in the film. They so wonderfully played their roles, I was excited by that. Joaquin Phoenix received a Golden Globe Award for the best man role (but I wonder Why not Oscar?!) in the film and I absolutely support this award. He managed to combine a line of a performer, a drug-alcohol addicted person and a deeply loving man. And Reese Witherspoon, I like her so much. She is a very beautiful light kind of a person and she was perfect for this role. The very interesting thing is that Johnny Cash and June Carter Cash chose the actors who will represent them in the film by themselves and that was not the choice of the director of the film (who is James Mangold). 
 The film itself is very full of events that coincide with the tour the musicians have, there are a lot of settings, and the colours are interesting. The directing is also perfect. It is full of action, of light and of people. It is like the real life was filmed and shown to the audience. 
 Most of all I was impressed how the love was played and shown: the eyes of Johnny Cash in the movie, his words, his obstinacy. Every time he was rejected he tried more and more. That can be a great inspiration for a loving person and that actually influenced me very much. 
 In the end, I will repeat my words, I loved this film very much. If you are a fan of Johnny Cash or you are a fan of rock and roll this is the film to watch and enjoy. I definitely give this film 10 out of 10.",10,0,0,4 March 2018
