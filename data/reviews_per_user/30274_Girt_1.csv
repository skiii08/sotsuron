The Blair Witch Project," Not your average horror flick, but chilling nonetheless
","I was really hyped up about this film from hearing all of the reviews and other things about it, and of course I decided that I had to see it as soon as it came out in the local theater.  So I caught it opening night amidst a packed theater and I came away from the experience with almost a sense of awe at the film.  It was obviously not what I had expected, I had read reviews and comments, both negative and positive, but they had still not prepared me for the type of movie that this was.  Do not go and expect this movie to be a normal slasher flick that is so common now, this film tries to draw on the terror of three young people lost, starving, and hunted.  Of course this may not be the kind of terror that people are accustomed to seeing when they go to see a scary movie, and some people will leave the theater simply shaking their heads and saying 'Well what was so scary about that??'  The truth is that it may not be the kind of scary movie where you jump out of your seat at a shock scene, but the horror is much deeper than that.  If you follow the movie completely and actually identify with the characters, then by the end of the movie you will understand why people have been calling this the scariest movie ever.  The actors play their parts very realisticly, and their actions are completely believable for their situation.  The final sixty seconds of the movie is easily the scariest part of the movie, and the last image of the movie will haunt some people well after the movie is over.  So my opinion on the film is that it is a total must-see movie, but be warned... if you're looking for shock value go elsewhere.  If you want a movie that deals with real terror then go and see this movie.",Null,0,0,7 August 1999
