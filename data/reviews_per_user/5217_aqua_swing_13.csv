Kill Bill: Vol. 2," One long interesting story
","After reading some of the strange reviews on this movie that've already come down, I'd have to discredit some of them, namely the person who called it a 'Violent Mess' without knowing half the story. I wonder what they'd think of the first half. When seeing this in the theater, you've got to remember this was originally slated, and is very much one full movie. If you put it into this context, you'll be able to follow everything much easier, as well as understand why the first was so violence driven, and the second half so much more over-the-top story driven. These are two very different halves, and in that sense, it makes for one great four to five hour film, but two very strange parts. Though the first half hour seemed a little as if it was dragging, the dialogue and word play is definitive Tarantino. Uma Thurman and David Carradine are fantastic, as well as most of the supporting cast. I just wish they'd have done more with Michael Madsen, as he is probably the largest let down in the film.",Null,0,1,19 April 2004
Walk the Line," Plot line issues slow the film
","When my mother and father came home from this movie, I asked 'How was it?', expecting the real deal from people who remember some of the events portrayed in this movie. Besides my dad's opinion of how great Joaquin Phoenix was, they basically didn't tell me too much besides that. On their word, I was thinking that it's probably going to be a great movie.And so when I sat down with a friend to watch this movie, I was entranced by it. The performances of the main actors (Phoenix, Witherspoon), and a great supporting role with Robert Patrick were far and away the highlights of this movie, and merit going to see the film on just this.But the problems with the movie are the timing. There's a whole slew of things that just didn't make sense, was put together in a fast-forward fashion, and some scenes completely pointless. In this, it reminded me of the Doors movie, which also had great acting by the leads and some of the cast, along with a very important childhood event, but overall, the plot was what killed it.Don't get me wrong, Phoenix and Witherspoon save the plot enough because you're so entranced with their performances that most of it doesn't matter, but the fact that some of the other people are looked over (the Tennessee Two - and then Tennessee Three by far here, have no explanation), and some people are added to the movie for no specific reason (Waylon Jennings. Played by his grandson).Basically you're getting the cream (and the dirt) of a five to eight year period in Cash's life (I'm not even discussing the children part) with no real conception of time, and no thorough glance at any specific song.When you leave the theater and actually think about the film, you realize that they're basically just throwing things at you hoping they're going to stick, plot wise. And though a whole lot of it does, the overall feeling of it is not as good as I'd hoped.",7,3,5,6 December 2005
Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Man's Chest," Avast! Craploads of characters, but Jack keeps some of it in check.
","Ah, Pirates. The movie of the summer, I'd imagine. Regardless of whether this thing is going to get good or bad reviews, people are going to go in droves to this thing, and they should.The best parts of the movie were self explanatory, really. For me, and for most people it was Depp again, but I saw that coming. This seemed to be another one of those 'The movie is alright but his performance makes it grand' thing, only not so much as say Secret Window or the Ninth Gate where he was 'making' those movies completely good. This one had a strong cast, but at the same time had a whole huge load of a supporting cast, and could make anyone paying half attention to the story easily confused (like the person sitting beside me).It had some great CGI things with the evil pirates from Davy Jones' ship, and the little story involved with Will Turner and Bootstrap Bill was introduced quite well, because it gave both the viewer, and the people involved that 'out of nowhere' feeling, so it was easily identifiable. They do tend to pack a whole crapload into the first hour or so, just to have that 'wrapping up' feeling to make sure that you're following along from the previous film, which seemed to be the same as the first hour of Superman Returns (which was only 4 minutes longer. Howabout that!). But like Superman Returns, the rest of the movie following that hour is smooth sailing until it's hang-ending that you can see coming from a mile away if you're paying full attention to the film and not just staring at Captain Jack and waiting for him to do something funny. Oh, and Keira Knightley's in this movie too. I forgot that. She's cute, and mostly lost in the shuffle behind all of the other massive amounts of characters that are there as a seemingly effortless (but actually not quite) plan of wrapping everything up in the third film.The one thing I do like above everything else about number two is how much darker it was. It wasn't the happy, almost always sunny movie the first movie was, this was something a bit darker, a bit scarier, and a bit uglier. That's how it should be, and they pulled that off beautifully, savvy?",8,1,3,7 July 2006
Lost in Translation," translated well
","I picked this movie not for Bill Murray, or from what I'd read/seen, but for Sophia Coppola. Her wonderful designs of scenery and soft but dirty colors all along Virgin Suicides kept me entranced. This movie does the same.
Throughout, are details on Bob, a down and out Hollywood actor doing overseas ads for alcohol, and Charlotte, a down and out wife, bored with the hotel waiting around for her husband. Soft story lines and wonderful shots of Japan, and just a fun, neatness about it makes it viewable by everyone. There's no overt comic weirdness by Bill Murray, it's all kept reserved. He's found a different niche than what I'd imagined him previously, and it works perfectly with Scarlett Johansson's portrayal of a lost little girl.I have faith in this movie.",Null,0,0,31 October 2003
The Matrix Revolutions," completely useless
","under the impression that i wasn't going to be amazed because the last movie did the same thing for me, i saw the final(?) installment of the matrix last evening and was quite unimpressed. most of the dialogue was as robotic as the new star wars films, and scenes were extended where they most definately should not have been. it's difficult to find something good other than hugo weaving's agent smith, and kind of funny to think that the most robotic person is also the most down to earth. 
see it, just to see it like i did. but don't be surprised to come out of there more dissapointed for it's boredom than anything else.",4,0,0,13 November 2003
North by Northwest," Grant + Hitchcock = Fun
","Cary Grant never ceases to amaze me. Though I haven't seen a whole list of his movies (Only two: This and Charade), his wit and cool demeanor makes me realize that if I was a movie go-er in his time I'd pick him as the person I'd want to be like when I grew up. The movie's only downfall was that it seemed kind of on the long side, and once or twice I caught myself closing my eyes about 15 minutes from the end, but Grant's ability to keep me interested in this movie surpasses the idea that this was even a Hitchcock film. By the middle I'd completely forgotten, because the style seemed so different from all of Hitchcock's previous films I've seen (Psycho, Rope, Vertigo, et-al), and I was happy with the end result. A must see for fans of Bond movies, because this is the completely implausible way of telling the same kind of story.",9,2,3,26 March 2005
The 40-Year-Old Virgin," Everybody likes Andy.
","After years of writing some of the funniest things on the Daily Show, Steve Carell takes to his own, this beast that he and director Judd Apatow penned together, The 40 Year Old Virgin.We've had a lot of gross-out humor movies come and go in the past few years that have had decent parts to them, but very few (Old School, Something about Mary) have ever been complete films. So many just dig directly for the jugular and try to just make you completely forget about an actual storyline that people can look at and identify with, in the least. But Virgin achieves this. It's character development in Andy, the main character is good, along with all secondary characters trying to help this guy get out and let it all hang out, to find that one who's going to get the years of frustration out of him.Catherine Keener is a steady love interest in this movie, too. Whenever it seems to slow down or the movie comes to a point of eye rolling, the chemistry between Keener and Carell save it, and bring you back around again for another round (of well placed) silly jokes, including that scene that everyone's seen on the commercial, the done-in-one take chest waxing. Why would Carell do that? Because, he wants Andy to be real, he wants the audience to cheer on his dorky forty year old through all of his action figure collecting quirkiness, and by the film's conclusion, there isn't a person in the house who doesn't like him.",8,3,6,29 August 2005
Batman Begins," Erase the past by creating a new future
","Everyone knows about the previous incarnations of Batman, and if you don't, you're lucky. The Batman series of films has been sitting on the shelf since the terribly icy (ha-ha) 'Batman & Robin' starring George Clooney and Arnold Schwarzenegger, which was pretty much a kick in the face to any fan of comic superheroes, although just a teeny, tiny bit better than the Captain America movie.But the new series of Batman (I say that because it's planned to have a three part series) has something the earlier versions (save the first film) did not. They were made for grown up audiences, with a good script, a fantastic director, and a landscape for Gotham that had never been introduced before. Many things about this movie are comparable to previous incarnations, and yet more than anything differ. Present are the always corny lines that pop up in every single comic book to movie ever made, but they work here, because there's not as much emphasis on trying to make them stand out jokes. Here they're placed gracefully and said with conviction.And what I mean by that is that this is the best casting of any Batman film. You might not like Bale's Batman, or Katie Holmes' Rachel (rumors are rampant she won't be in the next one because of all the Cruise etcetera), but with the rest of the stellar cast, they make it easy to forget (even Liam Neeson's terrible mustache!). Extra credit to Michael Caine's Alfred, whose character, as always played like a sidekick/father to Bruce.The film follows Bruce Wayne dealing with the death of his parents (as always), and how he came to be Batman, kind of like a 'Year one' nod from the comics, only done well enough so as not to throw off the non dorky comic people like myself. It's a fetchingly dark movie that does not let up and has a strong plot as well, which isn't surprising from the director of Memento and The Following. The graphic shots of flying, and the fantastic effects that have to do with the Scarecrow are awesome, showing the viewer that you don't need too much CGI, just bits and pieces enough to make it look better, and I'm not even going to talk about the gawking Batmobile Scenes. Whoa.The one faith I have in these new Batman movies is that they (please, can you?) restore the sanity in Batman and it's character where the two of four had previously stripped (yes, I'm talking to you Val and George), as well as the Bane character that was ruined in Batman & Robin. A character from the comics who was so strong and smart that he'd broken Batman's back and pretty much reigned Gotham for a short time was lowered to shitty sidekick for Poison Ivy and it makes me more angry about that than any other terribly made comic - movie I've ever seen.Batman Begins is a movie that could be considered a normal movie with a strong lead character to some, in the same way with Spiderman. It takes a super-hero and brings a struggle to get a sense of normalcy back into a person who is so far down at one point that it makes Bruce Wayne easy to identify with. It's the ups and downs in the life of a regular person who's just trying to do the right thing that makes this movie such a winner.",9,0,0,21 June 2005
X-Men: The Last Stand," The most disappointing.
","When comic books turn into movies, there's always an element lost in translation, a storyline that gets touched upon, parts that get torn out or missed, or even completely ignored. It's part of the whole formula that makes it cater to broad audiences that don't read comic books, that always have fans of whatever series is coming to the screen upset that specific parts are left out.And that's where X3 leaves me. When I'd heard that they were visiting the Phoenix story in this film, I wondered how exactly they would be able to fill a whole movie with the story, and not let most people down.The basics of the story are covered, sure, but the character issue is there, that half of the things that would be important had they been signed on for more than three movies are completely and utterly tossed aside.Now, I can live through that. But what I can't live through are the lines given to Halle Berry. She said she wouldn't sign on unless she had more lines, they say. It's funny, because the lines they've given her are almost exactly the kind of terrible one-liner clichés that she'd had throughout Catwoman, and I found myself shaking my fist every time she came to the screen.So terrible, so very terrible.On the other hand, there were some really great parts. Beast (Kelsey Grammar) was fantastic, Logan was great, Shadowcat (now that she has LINES!) was great, and Magneto was also fantastic. The rest of the characters were boring, silly, stupid, and not very much fun to watch.This my friends, is the worst of the three movies. Plot flies by with nary too much weight, story lines don't develop very well, and some of the fight scenes are boring.Sad to think that when I'd told people I'd seen this movie that I was more excited seeing the trailer for Snakes on a Plane, than actually talking about the movie.",6,2,4,27 May 2006
Kill Bill: Vol. 1," funny gore
","Kill Bill is probably the most outlandishly silly tribute to good old time kung fu movies. full of insane amounts of blood (no, not gory blood, silly blood), and not too much dialogue, it's so over the top you'll either laugh yourself silly, or leave early. I stayed, and am glad i did, though wondering, since the Japanese version has even more blood throughout, where would they put it? The only part i wasnt' as impressed with, was when the direction of the movie got down to the hard plot. it seemed to lag in some parts, or decide on taking too much of the story in detail. but maybe that's just me. the silly action sequences and sarcastic wit, pop culture references in the background (her heartbeat at 69!) more than made up for what was lacking.
 i think alot of people were going into this expecting another Resevoir Dogs, or Pulp Fiction. These movies are similar, but this is borderline comedy, where the other two are overtly sarcastic.I would have been ready to sit through the other half, by the time the movie ended..",Null,0,1,24 October 2003
Charlie and the Chocolate Factory," Consistently weird, Consistently Good
","Who doesn't get excited about Depp/Burton projects? If you don't, there's something wrong. From the beginning of their combined efforts until the next (Corpse Bride), there's always something in the air at theaters that makes you giggly, because even if parts of the movie are terrible, Burton's fantastic vision of scenery, and Depp's.. Depp-isms will save it somehow.And that's exactly where we place the Chocolate Factory movie.Much has been said (by Gene Wilder and reviewers) about the need for this movie, but in Hollywood's lack of ideas, well, it was probably going to get done again soon enough, and at least they have something working for them: the writer of the script had never seen the first film until after he went back to the original books and wrote this movie. That means ladies and gentlemen, that you're not getting a movie based upon a movie as so many people are trying to tell you, but you're getting something that goes back to the source material (kind of like the three War of the World films that came out this year), and a new view on everything. It's not knocking Wilder or the insane midgets that scared me as a child, it's creating a new vision.On we go pretending that you haven't heard this before: The story revolves around a young Charlie Bucket and his escapade through a tour in the museum that has just been re-opened by Willy Wonka. And right from the start of the tour, every little episode that looks awry also is silly, and perfect. From the fire set by the puppets, to the trained squirrels, everything looks so elaborately pretty. It's eye catching, it's the kind of thing that brings the kid out in you. You want to walk through that screen and dive into the chocolate waterfall, or eat the grass, so they say.And amid few problems, the acting is decent in that 'light comedy' way. It's never too boring for the older crowd with it's sometimes silly jokes that kids won't necessarily understand (beatniks and cannibalism!), or even it's Three Stooges comedy that caters to everyone. And no, Johnny Depp does not remind me of Michael Jackson. His Wonka is far from it really, but just because he's extra pale, talks with a high voice and is hanging around with kids, well that's enough for everyone else.The best thing this had going for it to me besides the continued on screen awkwardness of Depp's strange man Wonka, and a fantastic performance (again) by Freddie Highmore, is that contrary to the commercials, I was not completely annoyed by the film as television has me believe. There's lots more to it than you're getting. They've saved all the good parts for the film (what trailers don't normally do), and it's fun. I left with a smile on my face afterwards, like many other kids will, and isn't that really what matters?",7,1,3,21 July 2005
Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind," Carrey's best role, bar none.
","This is the kind of movie that everyone should partake in, at least once. The charismatic Jim Carrey performs a new side of himself that the likes of no one has seen before, and we see a new side of Kate Winslet, as well. She plays the Carrey role (outlandish, silly, fun), and he plays the Winslet role (reserved, sweet). Definitely not the kind of movie to bring a date out on, this is reserved for times of remembrance to things that were, happiness in old memories, a smile and a tear for something that once was. Eternal Sunshine has completely flip flopped the way I think about films, and I'm still surprised that Carrey had not received a best actor nod in the year it'd come out.Complete perfection, every step of the way.",10,0,1,22 March 2004
Star Wars: Episode III - Revenge of the Sith," The best of the new bunch
","As with the previous two Star Wars, Episode III isn't as different as Lucas says it is. Sure, it's dark, but you know, it still has the same problem that Episode II does, and that's Hayden Christensen. If you didn't think that much of his mediocre acting in II, you won't mind that much here. But for those of us who see Star Wars in a different (non hardcore) way, and also enjoy movies that don't have Tie Fighters, the dry mouthed twenty something's whine will make you sad, and yet when he's got a shut mouth and staring into the camera with dark eyes, I was happy, especially by the time the suit was involved. Less lines for him would have been great, but understandably impossible. It kind of all depended on what his lines were and who he was on the screen with. Sometimes he was alright, when being talked to like a young child that he was acting like, not the next chosen one guy. For him, less would have been more, but that's just me. Thank god for Ewan McGregor's Obi Wan, which for the longest time has been shutting him up with the right words to make me feel just a bit better.I've read somewhere that Lucas' ability to work with actors was not.. very good, and you know I think that's false, which is purely based on this: Actors with a history are good in this film. Samuel Jackson, Ian McDiarmid, Ewan McGregor (Especially. His Obi-Wan is the best part about all three films. He doesn't make his corny lines terrible, and composes himself fantastically while holding everyone else on the screen with him in a different light. He resonates, while the others try to shine.), and even a CGI Yoda shows better form than some of the lines that are more dry and boring than previous films.I will say this though: After making it through the first hour and a half of too much story to pack into one movie (there are so many things that have to do with the Republic and how things... Go - I don't want to spoil anything- that just kind of get easy answers, that it seems as if all of this happened in one really long, fast day. There was never the sense that this whole thing could go in the amount of time it takes to deliver healthy children), the setup for the ending and the last hour of the film is vintage, good Lucas, and almost perfect setup for a final ending. I still feel kind of odd about the fact that I was actually sad to see the fight scene. 'It's all led up to this', I could hear myself saying. And really, it has. It took more than twenty years to finish this being for one man, that's taken most of us in our heads to another place, and though there was a real bumpy road to get there, it's END was impressive enough for me to give it at least one thumb up.",6,2,4,30 May 2005
