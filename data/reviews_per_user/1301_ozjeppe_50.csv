Borat: Cultural Learnings of America for Make Benefit Glorious Nation of Kazakhstan," The laugh's on Borat, the shudder's on the Americans... but isn't this just Candid Camera, basically?!
","Scattershot satire/documentary of Baron Coen's cult character Borat the Kazsakhi reporter doing the American odyssey and dodging every prejudice possible along the way, including his own. Probably as many rigged as authentic set-pieces, and plenty of big, as well as failed laughs. Coen (who can't stop reminding me of a young John Cleese) is immensely talented in his very raucous, low-brow and puerile humor style, although I haven't seen any Ali G skits- or the movie. But to me eventually, this is basically Candid Camera, a made-for-TV skit collection. The laugh's certainly on Borat... and the shudder's on the Americans. But it also makes me wonder: how many try-outs to prove the alleged idiocy of the whole American society without scoring ANY points did they actually make? A howler is the posh dinner party! 5 out of 10 from Ozjeppe.",5,3,7,18 January 2007
Marie Antoinette," Some different teenage angst! Touching and original.
","Original, touching and surprisingly humorous account of the famed and ill-fated young Queen of France; definitely with some new touches, such as a rock-pop soundtrack... Out of place? Wrong way to do it? Well, if director Sofia Coppola hadn't made it this way, she probably would've been accused of yet another stale period & costume- piece with nothing new added. Well, this IS new! And needless to say, it's visually gorgeous and nicely acted. I must admit that at first, I was annoyed by the limited narrative perspective of her life. I felt trapped. Then it hit me: the claustrophobic feel is due to the fact that it has to be. This is Antoinettes POV all along- Versailles is a prison, set as a farce of etiquette codes, and her marriage is a lifetime sentence, that says: get pregnant or be gone! Some different teenage angst...6 out of 10 from Ozjeppe",6,1,2,27 November 2006
Casablanca," Losing my 'Casablanca- virginity', I was quite pleased!
","As with many classics, I waited years to watch this for the first time in a theater in January 2005. Hailed as maybe the best movie of all time... So, how was it? Of course - romance to a hilt, but it's utterly charming, finely produced, with amusing dialog and a clear political (unavoidable in a historical context) and moral human message. And of course, Bogart is massive in his screen presence. So, I was quite pleased to lose my 'Casablanca virginity', to put it fittingly!But I found it to have problems shaking the fact that it's a filmed stage play, which makes it move a tad too slow for its own good, therefore the dramatic elements feel very controlled, contained and lose vital impact. Best scene I found apart from the classical ones: The old couple rehearsing their newly learned English lines! Does anyone else feel the need to review older movies both from a cinematically historical perspective of importance... and then neutrally and separately - for what it's actually worth on it's own? I do- that's why this one can't get more than...:6 out of 10 from Ozjeppe.",6,4,10,11 January 2005
Dawn of the Dead," If a remake HAD to be made- this is how to!
","Furiously paced and grittily filmed, this remake of 1978 genre classic is strikingly effective, with characters needfully restrained. The apocalyptic atmosphere is immediate and riveting. And thank you for technical film-making improvement- no tomato soup- blood, here. Still, the 1978 original haunts me differently, with its slow-moving zombies and pastel images. There the message of human wallowing in the shopping mall materialist excess also lingers longer: Once knowing you could die the next hour, wouldn't YOU be tempted to do the same thing? But hey, why compete? They're two completely different films, and equally enjoyable. But the kinetic breakout scene here is simply stunning, and the episode with Andy the rooftop gunman provides the most memorable human element. 6 out of 10 from Ozjeppe.",6,0,0,5 July 2004
Oldboy," Daring, hard-to-digest... but will no doubt gain from multiple viewings.
","Daring, hard-to-digest urban revenge story that keeps one guessing right to the end. Loaded with obvious gangster theme touches, lots of impressive visuals, a roller-coaster pace and many characters to keep track of. Indeed, this saga will leave no audience untouched, as the off-turning scenes add up. It does carry questionable credibility, but unfamiliar with Korean cinema in general as I am, it could just be common practice of style? I found it at its strongest in the tragic story twisting and multi-layered characters. Will no doubt gain from multiple viewings... But when I'm ready; though- it's a rough ride to unbuckle the seat belt from!6 out of 10 from Ozjeppe",6,1,48,27 November 2006
Zodiac," The case- and nothing but the case- is this movie's pulsating, feverish heart.
","Director Fincher and a fantastic cast takes on the epic retelling one of the most famous serial killer cases in US history. And in their arsenal to hit home this long, low-key but overwhelmingly satisfying crime-solving puzzle/drama thriller, are these weapons: The meticulous storytelling focus on the case- and nothing but the case- which wisely becomes this movie's pulsating, feverish heart. And the stellar characterizations (Gyllenhall, Ruffalo & Downey JR sparkle!), who do take up space, but their private lives are expertly spun around the case focus as to not distract from it. Very traditional visuals for being Fincher, production design and time era atmosphere are also so good, you can almost swear that this was made simultaneously as both 'In the heat of the night', 'Serpico', & 'All the president's men'... To which this does owe a relatively big chunk of influence- and in bits equals and even surpasses, indeed! And what a cold sweat-scene in that projectionist's house!!8 out of 10 from Ozjeppe",8,1,2,9 July 2007
The Prestige," The real trick here... is having us entertained and intrigued nonstop!
","It's a treat to take part of this combo of adventure, thriller and character study of two rivaling magicians in London ca 1900. I find it so refreshing with a historical story and setting, that's carried out with such modern wit, cleverness and technique. And it goes deep into the dark sides of its characters, Nolan style, expectedly- it's certainly no more Mr. Nice (or good) Guy here! What's more, it throws eye-filling images, production design, two charismatic lead stars, and mind games galore at the audience. And the real trick here... is having us entertained and intrigued nonstop! But of course, it wouldn't be a magician movie without a punchline that outsmarts us and makes us lift our hats, like any great magic act. Juuust a tad long.7 out of 10 from Ozjeppe",7,0,1,5 January 2007
Pan's Labyrinth," A steamrolling powerhouse of human suffering and survival... and those images!
","It's Spain at the end of WW2: a pre-teen girl and her mother are forced to stay at a rebel-surrounded estate, run by a crazed, sadistic army captain that also happens to be her new stepfather... To escape the horrors of war and fascism, she enters an imaginary fairy-tale world of almost equally trying missions- or is it really imaginary?A slow beginning, but this grows into a startling showcase of surrealistically creative movie-making, that melts into drama of extreme cruelty, brutality and tragedy. An important, steamrolling powerhouse of human suffering and survival, featuring stellar acting and unforgettable images, enhanced by excellent special effects! This grim 'Alice in wonderland' had me in tears, and will most guaranteed move and shake you up for a long time to come.9 out of 10 from Ozjeppe",9,3,6,14 March 2007
Closer," Slick and clinical exercise
","Impressive gathering of actors in this four-character relationship drama of infidelity, manipulation and jealousy in contemporary London. I know it's an adapted play, loaded with flashy, nasty dialogue, and probably not attempting big credibility... But the slick and clinical exercise leaves me distanced. And even at 104 min's, the relationship merry-go-round spins too long and gets repetitive. Especially since none of the characters can really be cared for or favoured. Not all dramas of this kind need a heart, but I sorely miss one here. Main query: Why did the female roles need to be American? It's completely irrelevant. 5 out of 10 from Ozjeppe.",5,0,1,21 March 2005
Lost in Translation," United in alienation... beautiful star quality, but over-hailed suaveness
","Suave drama of two Americans (declining actor Murray and ignored young wife of celebrity photographer, Johansson ) meeting at star hotel in Tokyo, uniting in alienation of their soulless lives... and quite possibly falling in love. Writer-director Sofia Coppola may or may not tell her own adolescent, not-so-average upbringing, but this tale is executed with a rare simplicity by Hollywood standards and paradoxically, therein lies both its strength and weakness. Culture clash is just one theme here, providing most of the laughs (I saw this with Swedish subtitles and the Japanese dialog was thankfully NOT translated, enabling character identification even more). However, I lack a certain punch somewhere in the overall emotional content - a need for significant, not necessarily melodramatic, events to avoid that the story is running on empty a bit much, which it does. So I cannot agree to the ubiquitous much-hailed 'granditude' of this picture; it's just too esoteric.But the final scene is overwhelmingly beautiful. We don't NEED to hear what Murray is saying to Johansson, and we're not meant to, either. It doesn't feel like a love story, nor a father & daughter drama, either - the characters are just united in alienation, not only by the setting, but also in their separate private lives. And still, nobody makes a suffering deadpan like Murray - and Johansson is arrestingly gorgeous!So, 6 out of 10 from Ozjeppe",6,1,2,1 June 2004
The Godfather: Part II," Good, but no match for part one... and certainly no masterpiece!
","NO, one shouldn't compare movies. But here, it's validated, since both part one and two are based on one book, so I WILL. And on its own, this one is just no match for part one. It's good; we have flawless production values and cinematography. Jumping between past and present works and mix of locations (wintry family residence and tropical Cuba) helps. But the major drawbacks are: 1. Its length. 2. Its stretched-out storytelling and protraction of many scenes, which made my attention and interest drop considerably. It is simply too draggy and meandering. I just FEEL so much more watching part one, because it cuts more to the chase - tighter, darker and deeper. This one seems made to sprawl - but stalls a bit too often.However, some of the characters develop nicely (more depth from both Keaton, Cazale and Shire) , and the family heritage is cemented every time we move to Vito Corleone's younger days. Make no mistake, it's fine, solid and an indispensable part of the whole saga, but sorry folks - it's no masterpiece to me. 6 out of 10 from Ozjeppe.",6,14,32,3 December 2006
The Aviator," Impressive and engrossing Hollywood biopic
","An impressively carefully balanced Hollywood biopic view on Howard Hughes the millionaire, as well as the movie-maker, the lover, the aviator... and, most engrossing- the man battling his mental illness throughout his life. What I've only briefly read in book paragraphs about Hughes is compellingly elaborated by director Scorsese and scriptwriter John Logan. It's also solid, grand entertainment, not only for an aviationophile, which I feared at first. Lavish production of visuals (that crash scene is just stunning!) and time era feel, plus a great cast with Di Caprio in fine form, Blanchett a memorably cartoonish Hepburn, and finally a perfect Alda as senator Brewster. What I do miss is more background story of Hughes' fortune. 7 out of 10 from Ozjeppe.",7,0,0,25 April 2005
Burn After Reading," Goofy, swingingly entertaining crime comedy with a field day-cast.
","Disgruntled CIA man (Malkovich) quits the force and decides to write his memoirs. After forgetting them at the local gym, the odd pair of staff members (Pitt, McDormand) who find them, decide to stop at nothing in blackmailing him to get them back...Goofy, swingingly entertaining crime comedy with top-shape big name cast having a field day. Almost lightweight movie-making for being the Coen brothers, with minimal visual treatment, but many big - and dark - laughs with the car scene between Pitt & Malkovich a highlight! And as with the Coens, you know you're in for quite a nutcase gallery of characters (and habitually almost none to root for), but the unfolding plot, full of twists and turns, is thankfully an equal part of the enjoyment. 6 out of 10 from Ozjeppe.",6,0,2,13 December 2009
The Village," Again, Shyamalan shows his gift...
","Again, Shyamalan shows his rare gift as a visually vocational (striking use of colours!)and extraordinary creator of melancholy moods and atmospheres. The story here is a deeply felt idea about the desire to create a new society at any cost- and the incident that is about to break the whole community, is action caused by nothing but pure love and jealousy. But the overall vague depiction of the village people (many characters ring too hollow) isn't enough to hit this as a full home-run. But it certainly gave me and my fellow movie goer a lot to discuss... And the climax sequences with the luminous Howard are unforgettable and very moving. 6 out of 10",6,0,0,30 September 2004
Cold Mountain," Quite likable, if somewhat hokey 'Gone with the wind'- wannabe
","I really wasn't expecting a correct American history lesson here, so I found myself quite enjoying this long, romantic and sweeping civil war-backdrop southern tale. A very likable 'Gone with the wind'- wannabe, albeit somewhat hokey, as many strong, potently violent scenes clash with the old-fashioned western-dreamy clichés. And although crammed with big Hollywood stars who are all a guilty pleasure to watch... I can't help but feel that this would work ideally (again, as with a LOT of films) as a mini-series, as many of the characters just seem to cartoonishly jump in and out- Hoffman, Portman and so on... they just don't stick around long enough! 6 out of 10 from Ozjeppe",6,0,2,4 February 2007
Ratatouille," Shimmering movie magic to melt hearts, minds and souls.
","Pixar & Disney animation studios bring us absolutely shimmering movie magic to melt both hearts, minds and souls: Remy the Rat, who just happens to be a genius cook, stumbles into hapless kitchen-hand youngster Linguinis' life in Paris and turns him into a master chef himself, with more surprises in store...SO clearly made with love for the world of cooking & cuisine, and if one is into that (like myself), it provides that extra dimension to elevate this into that masterpiece-status as this one is! Besides a good and as complex story as this kind of fares can handle, providing to its brilliance are all the carefully picked details such as setting (Ah, Parri'! Aristocats surely knew how to set an atmosphere for success!) and great side characters that don't necessarily steal the show. As an adult, I would be more curious about the relationship of Linguini & Colette, but this IS a family fare, so my grunts are as good as none. Timelessly funny and endearing, the classic scenes add up- but the climactic serving to Anton Ego, the food critic, is THE one to never forget! Oh, did I forget the jaw-dropping animation technique and perfect voiceing? There. Now go watch! 9 out of 10 from Ozjeppe",9,1,2,30 November 2007
No Country for Old Men," Elegiac, spellbinding and breathlessly suspenseful... but the change of storytelling frame bothers me.
","Sweeping, spellbinding thriller from the Coen Brothers of a double manhunt in 1980 Texas after a drug deal gone wrong - Involving a Vietnam vet (Brolin) discovering and deciding to run off with the drug money, a retiring sheriff (Jones) sadly and philosophically beholding the increase of violence in society, plus a psychopathic assassin (Bardem) in the most evil and enigmatic of villain shapes...Deceptively simple set-up becomes an elegiac piece of film-making (with obvious nods to old-time westerns) in its soul, that injects breathless, unpredictable suspense even in it's quietest moments (in complete absence of a music score) and brutal, chair-jumping violence.In typical Coen fashion, it's cast to perfection, stunningly shot with stylish, yet showy dialog, keeping their dark, dry humor intact. But it bothers me when such a successfully straight storytelling frame, unnecessarily changes direction 3/4 through, and so carelessly dispatches one of its main protagonists (and equally ditto with Harrelson's character) which leaves the last 20 minutes or so, needlessly protracted and losing crucial impact... I guess it must be the original story of the book it's based on, but I keep thinking: why, oh why couldn't they have stuck to follow a straight, shorter line to the finish, as in 'Blood simple', for instance? For me, that would have truly hit the bulls-eye - we GET the contemplative message from Lee Jones' character, anyway...Still packs one hell of a punch, with scenes never to be forgotten!7 out of 10 from Ozjeppe",7,2,4,8 November 2008
The Assassination of Jesse James by the Coward Robert Ford," Modern fandom complexities & character studies, set in the Old West... have seldom looked so poetic!
","The title says it all. This is the more unheard of 'legends' of the man who both idolized and shot the infamous outlaw Jesse James. I'd be reluctant to call it a Western, because foremost, we get a male character study flexing many muscles and nuances, that seems to just happen to be set in the old west. Yes, there is gun-play but that's not what made the filmmakers get this ambitious drama off the ground, for sure. The modern complexity of idol fandom and fame coveting, (which is unnervingly reminiscent of such famous cases as the John Lennon & Ronald Reagan shootings) plus the film's psychological character interplay very much discloses this fact.Told most elaborately and poetically, writer/director Australian Dominik has made sure it almost never gets too boring, though, as every scene is as artistically shot as a wall painting. The West has seldom looked both so rugged, flamboyant and beautiful as here, as those snow scenes will stay long on my retina! And if that doesn't do the trick, pitch-perfect performances are plenty to enjoy, with Affleck delivering a haunting and unforgettable portrait of Ford.A note to the ones watching this who are having trouble with languid pace and atmosphere: stick with it, because those final 20 minutes is a masterful showcase of more trimmed, riveting storytelling underlining the story's double tragedy. Biggest flaw which holds back my higher rating: It IS overlong by at least half an hour and an already fine movie would have been great, if cut down.7 out of 10 from Ozjeppe",7,0,1,29 August 2010
28 Days Later...," A promisingly eerie surge of doom... but falls apart in second half.
","'Dawn of the dead' sort of meets '12 monkeys' in this intense, impressively produced cult mash of zombie horror flick and dystopian sci-fi: England is ravaged by a rabid-like virus outbreak, and survivors team up to cope in deserted London... and to fight infected people-turned-monsters. A top first half, with a really promising, eerie surge of doom... but then it falls apart in the second. As the survivors reach the military camp front, it goes from functioning violent unpleasantness to non- functioning such, as it clumsily lashes out in all directions, tossing needful credibility in the garbage can. Oh well, it still remains a noteworthy memorable grabber in the genre...Best scene: when Cillian Murphy finds his dead parents- extremely moving! 5 out of 10 from Ozjeppe",5,7,10,18 February 2007
The Mist," A visceral, nerve-rattling apocalypse.
","I read the Stephen King novella some 25 years ago and it was already gripping back then in its effective, 'Dawn of the dead'-like simplicity (a large group of people gets trapped inside a supermarket as a mysterious mist surrounds them with unspeakable terrors lurking inside it). But to actually expand, extend and IMPROVE it, was beyond my wildest expectations, as Darabont turns this horror-fantasy tale into a visceral, nerve-rattling apocalypse. The supernatural monsters are quite impressively scary (if a bit too CGI-graphic...), but they almost pale in comparison to its human counterparts as the panic mounts with a religious loony in the crowd. There is a truly terrifying human sacrifice scene which will haunt me for a long time... Knowing it was written in the 80's also answers some modern obvious plot questions (umm - anyone got a cell phone?). A bit long, but thumbs up for really going for the throat and daring to be merciless with its characters to the very end! Another tool is what I've advocated for a long time: a very limited music score; it's ghastly enough as it is - and parents: be sure to keep your kids away from this! 7 out of 10 from Ozjeppe",7,0,2,18 August 2009
The Elephant Man," Mesmerizingly beautiful!
","Can't believe I waited 26 years to watch this, and realize how director Lynch's career took off at such a peak. What a mesmerizingly beautiful and hard-to-fathom tragic account of deformed man John Merrick's fate in 1800s London. It wrenches out as much emotional sadness as a viewer can bear, but is very simple (sometimes too simple) in its storytelling structure. Its surreal dream elements are a good, welcome break in that matter. John Hurt gives an immortal portrait, and the images burn in effective, almost pencil-sketchy black & white. The similarities to Fellini's 'La Strada' just adds to its likability. Man, that scene when John Merrick comes back to the London train station and is chased by a mob... as classic, haunting and heartbreaking as it gets!! 8 out of 10 from Ozjeppe.",8,1,1,24 November 2006
The Curious Case of Benjamin Button," Charming and pretty as a postcard when Fincher goes Disney... but awfully conventional and bland!
","Director Fincher almost goes Disney in this crowd-pleasing fairy tale, pretty as a postcard, of the life of the title character (Pitt), a man born in 1918 New Orleans with a most curious condition - he ages in reverse... Charming, aiming-to-be-epic-(and for the Oscars), but awfully conventional picture considering its main idea (and yes, its 'Forrest Gump'- comparisons are sometimes quite validated) whose flame burns most intensely in Button's tug-boat period and its moving final minutes, which leaves its main bulk - the love story with Blanchett - mostly bland, sentimental and protracted, which certainly can't be the purpose... and there's no reason for it to be as long as it is. And albeit a fantasy - with a hero that never changes a facial expression, and characters who never ever question his condition - it never goes to the complex emotional depths it could have. If this is team Fincher/Pitt to come, I prefer them so much more when going hardcore a' la 'Se7en' and 'Fight club'! Very impressive special/make-up effects in Button's early years, though. 6 out of 10 from Ozjeppe",6,0,1,31 January 2009
Million Dollar Baby," No boxing film per se, but an old-fashioned drama & tear-jerker
","Aging boxing trainer Eastwood reluctantly takes on his biggest challenge yet: a 30-year old woman (Swank) who's determined to make it big, despite the 'man's world's game'. Not a boxing film per se, as it is really a good-old-fashioned variation of the father & daughter drama-theme; and not to mention the inevitable 'I could'a been a contender' - content. So, be beware of lots of tear-jerking, although of the better kind, mostly thanks to the charisma of Eastwood & Swank. And being Hollywood as it is, you have to put up with scenes like the one where Freeman's character gets his last 'match' defending the ultimate underdog 'Danger', and the title fight where Swank's opponent is nothing but a clichéd dirty-fighting brute from Germany! It's a simple, good and emotionally involving movie - with a welcome, bold pro-euthanasia statement - not aiming for cinematic re-invention or greatness. But an Oscar for best picture...? Naah.'She's younger, faster and better than you. So what are you gonna do about it?' 6 out of 10 from Ozjeppe",6,1,4,13 October 2006
Garden State," Minimalism brimming with quirkiness and warmth.
","Braff more than aptly brings us and stars in this minimalistic, winning comedy-drama about small-town homecoming, family skeletons, and love saving the day (and your life!). Proves that a good script is all a movie needs, as it's brimming with quirkiness and warmth. Great set of whimsical characters! The feel of 'Scrubs' is unmistakably in the air... But that rub-off is no disturbance. It can't sustain the same touch all the way to the finish line, as I find it ending a bit too conventional and cute. But any movie that brings on Coldplay AND such an underrated Simon & Garfunkel end song on its soundtrack is nothing but classy taste! So, comfortably 7 out of 10 from Ozjeppe.",7,0,1,28 February 2005
Mulholland Drive," All style and two-thirds substance... in some self-interpretation ride, indeed!
","Young aspiring actress Watts (in a knockout performance) arrives in Hollywood and gets caught up in one nightmarish, enigmatic situation after another... and then the movie just nose-dives off a cliff and leaves the viewer in a total self-interpretation limbo!I mean, how do you rate a movie that is a movie buff's wet dream two-thirds of the way only getting better and better as it builds up, and then just quits? Is a movie really good if it requires 3 viewings to reach a satisfactory solution? Is a film better if the wrap-up is 100% all up to the individual wiever? Is Naomi Watt's character a complete loony or just dreaming all the way through? Does a movie mystery need a solution at all to be good? Boy, this gives every wiever quite a head itch!Well, when the ride along is such a delight as it is here, I'm prepared to give in. Because as pure movie-making goes, it's fantastic. It balances an almost unbearable fever pitch of a noir thriller, with delicious film clichés and hilarious moments, great performances and truly stunning visuals. It's all style and two-thirds substance - regardless if Lynch had this dream, jotted down the script as soon as he woke up, and changed nothing - or knowing by movie gossip-hearsay that it's a series pilot episode that didn't expand into more, which actually would explain everything in terms of plot logic! But if you know Lynch's repertoire, logic is never required! 7 out of 10 from Ozjeppe",7,0,2,26 June 2005
Big Fish," The importance of a good tale... makes a medium splash.
","It's all about the importance of a good tale in people's life. We know this from Robert Guillaume's line near the end as he would pick the not-so-truthful, but better-sounding version of the drama surrounding Crudup's birth. Also being the tale about an estranged father and son relationship, the borderline between truth and fiction to both its own characters and moviegoers, provides the movie magic as well as the emotional vulnerability here.With echoes of 'Forrest Gump', the ambition here is bigger than the final achievement, and I can sense the urge of the film-makers for a longer epic out of this story. Many bits and characters are presented to hold great importance, but are left dangling, annoyingly unfinished, as prodigal director Burton and writer John August shifts tone, narration emphasis and focus too often to hit a bulls-eye. But as pure entertainment it's thoroughly enjoyable and eye-filling as a day at the fun-fair. And the robust performance of Albert Finney as the old Ed Bloom clearly outshines anybody else here, with a much more believable accent than McGregor, too! 6 out of 10 from me.",6,0,1,24 June 2004
The Dark Knight," Bombastic and explosive outing... but its corkscrew plot additions work against its complete success...
","Gotham City gets a new, bold D.A. (Eckhart) who is ready to stand up and stop its mob & criminal spread, plus a formidable, loose cannon of a villain (you know who!) for the caped hero to tackle. Bombastic, explosive outing in the new Batman-franchise, steered by Nolan's head-on serious approach and cutting-edge production values. Look-wise, this is what the comic book creation wanted all along! But its relentless pace and corkscrew plot additions (it's either just me getting old... or isn't it REALLY hard to grasp all its threads?) work against its complete success. In 'Batman begins' - which I hold better - at least we got a chance to get a little more emotionally involved and contemplative before getting yanked right-left-right and blown away!Rousing ending and crackling dialog though, plus the appropriate mean streak, personified by the flamboyant, Oscar-winning performance by Ledger as the most disturbed Joker we're most likely to see on screen! 6 out of 10 from Ozjeppe.",6,7,13,10 June 2009
Into the Wild," An Americana and a celebration of freedom like no other - simply stunning!
","Simply stunning real-life account of college graduate who simply disowns and ditches the American society, lifestyle - and his parents - to make a life in the midwestern/Alaskan wilderness. Along his path he also encounters and affects a handful of diverse people in both profound and truthful ways... A clearly victorious labor of love for director Penn, as it uses voice-over, appropriately themed songs and nature philosophy quotes (if a few too many) just as effectively as the beauty of nature's scenery itself to tell an Americana (and the fate of quite a man) like no other. An honest, heartfelt celebration of following a dream of freedom and simplicity - gaspingly well made - that resonates even deeper, of course, if you agree on its values and statements (like me). Rousseau smiles in his grave! Also astonishingly, effortlessly acted down the line with a fantastic Hirsch (who to me is an uncanny cross between Johnny Depp & River Phoenix!) in the lead; it wouldn't work without his performance.

Blood Diamond," Urgent, magnificently crafted Movie on a Mission to both shake, move and thrill.
","War-torn Sierra Leone, 1999: A former mercenary-turned bitter diamond smuggler (DiCaprio) gets obsessed retrieving a fortune diamond hidden by country family man (Hounsou, who's also had his family torn apart) plus an American journalist (Connelly) hungry for a good story - the truth! Movie on a Mission to both shake, move and thrill (not to mention think)- and boy, does it ever... even if the ostensibly one-track chase form occasionally narrows it. Riveting, muscular and magnificently crafted, with top locations and fiery performances by Hounsou and DiCaprio. A lesson in contemporary history and a moral message harshly hammered home about how western consumerism - here, the dirty gemstone trading business - between 1st & 3rd world countries can flame civil wars. Those battle scenes (especially with the kid soldiers) are as scarring and indelible as any you'll witness.An urgent, more than apt companion piece to 'Constant Gardener' and 'Salvador' and almost just as good, albeit slightly rough and stumbly around the edges. This is Hollywood on one of its best and important paths! 8 out of 10 from Ozjeppe.",8,0,0,20 June 2009
Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind," A sparkling intellectual feast, embraced in a warm bear hug.
","One of the best films of the 00's has a set-up story that might ring alarmingly non-original: Carrey agrees to have his mind and memory medically entered to forget the painful break-up from the love of his life Winslet... But the way scriptwriter Kaufman outlines it, is ingenious and nothing short of fantastic in this complete delight of a movie that just gets better and better as it goes along, wrapped in swirling, dazzling visuals by director Gondry! Carrey has thrown off his cute clown mask for good (I wasn't totally convinced after 'The Truman show') and is fully matched by the rest of its spirited cast ('Frodo' in a crew-cut... right on!).A sparkling intellectual feast that races and challenges, keeps its audience guessing and puzzled, yet never outruns or outsmarts you, while embracing you in a warm bear hug. A unique, smart, funny yet deeply moving tribute to love and devotion and by now a genuine, modern classic.

We're thrown into the action as quickly as possible and as a result, characters and their development play both second and third fiddle (and honestly suffer as a result), because here it's the world of the planet Pandora itself in the lead role. And some lead: the visual explosion, redefining the line between CGI and real objects, is nothing short of amazing, and means everything to draw us in, accept and surrender to its terms. It's a far cry from the plastic sceneries of 'The phantom menace' or 'Attack of the clones', e.g. with Cameron's unsurpassed sophisticated touches, including perfected technical machinery and weaponry. Naturally, this is not for cynics with no sense of fantasy and wonder, as fairy tale cuteness (I honestly had to choke a giggle or two at the first looks and sights of the Na'vi) meets rough, thunderous action. Again, I feel the itch to make a TV-series out of this, to do the whole Na'vi/Pandora mythos justice!Theme-wise, overly obvious (if commendable) paraphrases and parallels of the white man's burden of the slow holocaust of the American Indians and subsequent colonial heritage are there. So are equally obvious old-time adventure hero clichés. But in all fairness, who else but the above-mentioned cynics would care when we have such a completely fresh and unique ballpark/fairground to play in? I haven't seen many complaints about 'Star wars episode IV' totally ripping off the plot of 'Seven Samurai', but still managing to be just as good a movie anyhow!But this whole vessel wouldn't carry its load if there wasn't a heart that works, which I find in Cameron's huge plea for nature and environmental preservation, with a touch of the need for spiritual rebirth thrown in, just as he did in 'The abyss'. And any movie accomplishing that message to such a degree of bringing a tear to my eye, is easy to embrace. In all, a breathtaking adventure with action scenes all set and ready to move up on any such a best-ever list! 7 out of 10 from Ozjeppe",7,2,4,11 January 2010
Drag Me to Hell," Raimi empties his whole bag of horror tricks... but the ghost train rides way over the top!
","Career-hungry bank loan officer Lohman refuses a loan to a creepy old gypsy woman. Very soon, she is tormented by a demonic curse that refuses to be meddled with. Entertaining, colorful and genre-simply set up, as writer-director Raimi empties his whole bag of clichéd and CGI-enhanced horror tricks (demon séances, mudwater-filled graves, crawling insects - sometimes with a twist, and sometimes not) for the sake of a good ghost train ride.But with the high quota of not exactly subtle character byplay and equally over-the-top, almost slapstick shock material, it's hard to judge when to laugh or gasp (especially the scenes with the gypsy woman's teeth...). What worked for 'Poltergeist' and 'An American werewolf in London', doesn't quite work here due to lack of that deftness. I do personally prefer horror flicks that are meant to scare straight first and foremost, rather than tickle your funny-bone for better impact, ever since 'Scream' crossed that boundary once too often for my liking. And for any experienced moviegoer who has seen just a couple of shockers up the same alley, can't that final outcome be seen coming a mile away, really? 5 out of 10 from Ozjeppe",5,0,0,21 July 2010
Where Eagles Dare," 'Castle Wolfenstein' for real - top class, nail-biting WW2 actioner still truly delivers!
","Classic adaption of Alistair Maclean's novel of allied group sent off on seemingly hopeless mission to rescue an American general taken prisoner by the Nazis - in a castle on the top of an alp mountain! I saw this for the first time in 1981 and the re-watch now was happily (and surprisingly) on par with my memory value, proving this still has what it takes! For the video game audience, one could for fun label this 'Castle Wolfenstein' for real: Top-class, explosive WW2 actioner that truly delivers simply by nothing more than no-brakes-hold-entertainment in full gear. Maclean's trademark spy/treason herrings are strewn all over the place and no character development can be seen, but why complain? Snowy, great authentic locations add immeasurably to its success of putting it above so many other formula war actioners. That final half hour (with the cable car fight and the plow-bus chase) is legendary nail-biting stuff! 8 out of 10 from Ozjeppe",8,2,4,7 January 2010
National Treasure," Great one-liners in enjoyable matinée yarn, that really can't fail.
","Highly enjoyable treasure-hunt yarn with splendid production values and a twistful story of Cage as a sort of urban, modern-day Indiana Jones. With a handful of my favorite actors thrown in, it can't really fail! The script does hold a bit of a patriotic American History lesson, but I'm gonna start to grunt. All mixed in with the adventure matinée spirit, it never slows down for a minute, for the pure sake of entertaining! Not to mention the comedy values... It has a bunch of great lines that would highlight any sitcom:('Can I marry your brain?') (-'Reilly, are you crying?' -'Look, stairs..')Enjoy! 6 out of 10 from Ozjeppe",6,1,1,7 January 2006
The Happening," The answer to Shyamalan's roller coaster career... keeps blowing in the wind!
","Auteur M. Night Shyamalan's latest fantasy thriller borrows a great deal from 'Invasion of the body snatchers' and 'The stand' as mysterious, spectacular mass suicides spread across the American East coast. An increasingly smaller group of protagonists in Philadelphia flee into the countryside as the enigma points to biological reasons...The opening hook is really something - and the first 45 minutes are equally tense, with unpredictability and moody visuals its biggest assets. But increasingly dopier (and ditto dialog) situations and character actions slowly drag this down, as the script digs itself into a big hole. The emotional content isn't entirely successful, either - it comes in moments where we don't know the characters yet to care enough (like Leguizamo's goodbye) or later on, when it has already crossed into the turkey farm one too many times.Shyamalan's career is truly a roller-coaster, as this is one step up from 'The lady in the water' but yet one steep step down from all his previous works. I do like the thematic matter, though, that the planet Earth has finally had enough of humans and finding a perfect, sinuous way to dispatch us all. That final message is also ambiguous; is it pro-natalist, or a scenario that spells an ultimatum from nature if we do procreate? The apocalypse answer, my friend, is blowing in the wind... and so does the Shyamalan enigma saga! 5 out of 10 from Ozjeppe",5,0,1,19 November 2011
The Departed," Sizzling acting ensemble overkills in the bone-crunching-hard department of cop movies.
","Now, this looked a sumptuous feast on the menu indeed, considering the people involved! And it's certainly a sizzling acting ensemble piece in the bone-crunching-hard department of cop & mob movies. No cinematic delight, though, as director Scorsese focuses entirely on the characters: plenty of dialog, the huge cast seems to crowd every frame, and the dead bodies keep adding up... watch out, sensitive folks, violent it is! The cat & mouse- game crime story itself, of undercover moles on both sides of the law, is kept on edgy, high-octane energy in spite of lengthy running time, but eventually exhausts me in its turns, swirls AND gunshots in the head! There's just no time to breathe, and that gives the film a lack of personality and the threat of overkill- especially the finale... but I could easily see this work great as a mini-series! Overall, definitely worth your time, and Di Caprio and Nicholson are phenomenal. And, no- I haven't seen the original 'Infernal affairs'. I just might, after this! 6 out of 10 from Ozjeppe",6,0,1,17 January 2007
There Will Be Blood," Or: 'There Will Be Greed'. Dark, demanding male character study with a towering, but suffocating Day-Lewis.
","Or: 'There Will Be Greed'! Arresting, magnetic (but needlessly long and slow, with odd, seemingly unresolved passages) drama of ruthless American oil baron (Day-Lewis) through the 1890s - 1930s who, for the sake of his obsession of exploiting a small California township rich with oil, sends off his deafened son, kills a man claiming to be his brother and fakes a Christian baptism... among other things! No history piece or Americana, but a dark, demanding and unusually complex male character study, with Day-Lewis' Oscar-winning performance a towering, multi-faceted centerpiece. Present in as good as every scene, he virtually eclipses and suffocates all the other characters, which becomes as much a benefit as a burden to Paul Thomas Anderson's script on the destructive forces of greed. Also, that concentration displays the frustrating Hollywood habit of the lack of female characters - not only here...6 out of 10 from Ozjeppe",6,2,5,27 November 2009
Stranger Than Fiction," Quite wonderful fantasy-comedy holds great melancholy and philosophical depths!
","Big city IRS investigator leads a dry, predictably dull existence... until he hears a voice-over narrating his very moves - is his life real or being fictionally written?! Quite wonderful, snappy fantasy-comedy holds unexpected melancholy and philosophical depths about fate and living life to the fullest, that almost puts this into the drama section! Echoes of 'Adaptation', 'Groundhog day' and 'The Truman show' - but the script feels original and air-tight, by thankfully evolving and improving as it progresses, dodging the potentially one-joke premise. With a feast-cast and sympathetic characters it's almost a tear-jerker, but smarter, with a big heart!It also asks the great question - with all novels being written everywhere in the world - mustn't it be someone somewhere telling exactly MY real-life story as fiction? 7 out of 10 from Ozjeppe",7,0,0,4 December 2008
The Green Mile," Exceptionally well-made fantasy-drama but turgidly overbaked and overlong.
","Director Frank Darabont adapts Stephen King's tale of death row prison guard (Tom Hanks) recalling his days in the 1930s and his life-changing encounter with simple-minded giant prisoner (Michael Clarke-Duncan) accused of child murder... but who also seems to possess a certain supernatural gift of resurrection.Exceptionally well-made fantasy-drama that tries to tread a fine line between the grimly harrowing - and cute and well-meaning... but is the complete opposite of subtle. Darabont has a penchant for the overbaked and overblown - which this has in spades in its turgid spiritual symbolism and over-the-top bad guys. He also plays out the scenes in what feels like slow motion that cannot by any means warrant 3 hours of running time. Still, most enjoyable with a flamboyant atmosphere and a fine, heartfelt performance from the enormous Clarke-Duncan.6 out of 10 from me.",6,1,2,31 July 2013
The Wrestler," Extraordinary portrait of low-life America punches life into an old 'Rocky'-like formula
","After 20 years in the business, aging pro-wrestler Rourke is inevitably at the end of his rope, facing his failing health as well as the long-lost contact with his estranged daughter (Wood), and his blossoming crush interest in a local bar stripper (Tomei).Extraordinary portrait of low-life America that makes all the right moves to punch life and power into an old 'Rocky' -like formula with shades of the somewhat similar 1972 drama 'Fat city'. Evades sentimentality by its candid, semi-documentary style, subtle symbolism and full-fleshed characters. The dive behind the scenes of the seemingly ridiculous, clownish world of the WCW phenomenon is equally fascinating (with its inside camaraderie and steroid pushing) and moving. Commendably short running time helps, too. That final supermarket deli scene should be a classic, just as the monumental performance by Rourke of a man unable to change his fate - the parallels to his own acting career is the icing on the cake!7 out of 10 from Ozjeppe",7,1,1,3 April 2010
The Queen," Almost a two-character counter-play in surprisingly light-footed account...
","Surprisingly entertaining and light-footed account from within the British royal family (and prime minister Tony Blair) during the tumultuous weeks following princess Diana's death in 1997. Plays almost like a two-character drama as Sheen and Mirren excellently counter-play on which moves the royal court should and shouldn't make in the extremely crucial situation. With dialog and scenes that obviously take large liberties with the truth but remains quite non-judgmental in tone.Scores intriguing looks behind the scenes of power & celebrity worshiping, that underlines my own opinion that monarchy, as such, is seriously to be questioned in a modern, democratic world. It's quite sickening to see the opulent privileges (and superior attitudes of human values) a family inherits, that people have to pay for in taxes...Politics aside, it's 6 out of 10 from Ozjeppe.",6,2,3,15 September 2008
Mary and Max," Transports you into a universe of its own where the surprises never stop coming - a small masterpiece!
","I've been watching too many mediocre/sub-par flicks lately. Which makes me so happy that once in a blue moon, there's still a movie that is able to just sweep in from nowhere and trigger that soaring feeling inside your chest, making you grateful for being alive to have experienced it. This amazingly detailed clay-animated (á la Wallace & Gromit with a grayish twist!), but QUITE adult fairy tale is one of those: Unhappy 8-year-old Mary in a small Australian town, writes a chance letter in the 1970's to middle-aged obese man, Max in NYC, USA - and so an unlikely pen-pal-correspondence begins... that is nothing but a marvel to share!The biggest miracle this movie pulls off is to literally transport you into another universe of its own, where the surprises never stop coming. Through the lives and fates of two simply unforgettable characters, it takes a firm, heartfelt stand for The Outsider and dives head-first into dark places where, say Pixar rarely would dare to go (mental afflictions, alcoholism, bullying, family deaths etc). Almost guaranteed to move you to tears, (even a few more might be shed knowing that recently diseased Philip Seymour Hoffman provides the fantastic voice of Max) it also serves up top-notch black humor and is hysterically funny at times. Yes, I am seriously in love with this wonderful film and can't wait until I get to watch it again. A small masterpiece that collects an equal once-in-a-blue-moon 10/10 score from me!",10,3,6,28 December 2013
Blade Runner," Cold, but still hauntingly poetic and violent sci-fi classic, with unforgettable climax
","Note that this is a combination review; I saw the original once in 1982 and the Dir's Cut now in 2009 - which changes the ending/final voice-over - but that doesn't really diminish the overall effect of my lasting liking of this sci-fi action classic: Very straight, cold focus on story (of Ford as future hunter of runaway androids in L.A, the year 2019) instead of character development, (as many critics point out) but I don't really care... since production design and special effects techniques are still justifiably fantastic and beautiful. And what's more, I now notice how hauntingly poetic (ah, Vangelis' ethereal music score!), darkly enigmatic and contemplative it is, among its bursts of thrilling, unforgettably violent action. And what about that mesmerizing, Gothic climax with Rutger Hauer's menacing presence?! Wowser.7 out of 10 from Ozjeppe.",7,1,3,5 January 2009
Casino Royale," Reinventing Bond beyond Bond! 007 is no longer a laughable figure...
","A huge sigh of relief and a satisfied smile on my face... This was probably the only way to re-invent the Bond franchise, which I have followed the past 30 years: Tight, fresh and modern-day-explosive & technical in as realistic a manner as the series can handle. And with a surprisingly vulnerable villain and a close, credible bond (haha) to the heroine. It's Bond beyond Bond, so to speak. And Craig himself? Hard and cool as a rock, although equally hard to get personal with... But that's a needful purpose in order to lay the pathway for another string of films to work, I guess.Dalton touched it a bit in 'License to kill', and to some extent, Brosnan in 'Die another day'. But to me, Bond has never been so personally dramatic and involving as here, as the haunting end scenes truly underline: 007 is no longer a laughable, ridiculed figure! It's just slightly overlong and overplodding, but contains opening and closing action pieces of unreal proportions! And the casino theme and its poker game itself doesn't dominate- it blends in nicely.As with the transformation of 'Batman begins', I can with pleasure really look forward to a new and reborn series with hopefully unique qualities.7 out of 10 from Ozjeppe.",7,0,1,31 December 2006
The Matrix," Hail to the savior of the industry!
","OK, I probably can't add anything more to everything already noted about this milestone of a movie. So, this is more of a teary-eyed Thank You-speech long overdue! The genre of this adult kind of sci-fi-action has three indisputable kings at its top, in my book: Aliens, Terminator 2 ... and The Matrix. Thank heaven and earth for the people making this kind of movies, just for an audience like me! Without them, the movie world would be a poorer, drier and drearier place to be. That feeling of overwhelming rush and awe that overpowered me in the movie theater in Sydney 1999, still hasn't worn off. Seven years later, I feel safe to say that it saved the industry of inventive movie making at this level, all on its own, with its epic mix of genres: Sci-fi. Action. Martial arts. Urban mythology. Immortal characters and quotes. It's all here, unsurpassed both in mind-bending style and original content, leaving the biggest of cult followings. As for its sequels... it just didn't need them!10 out of 10 from Ozjeppe",10,1,2,14 October 2006
Interview with the Vampire: The Vampire Chronicles," Probably as good a screen adaptation as one can expect from the book!
","Juicy and flamboyant in every respect of the words. Neil Jordan's lush direction showed us what he's capable of in combining the importance of good narrative with a visual banquet in 'The crying game'. And 'Interview'... is no step-down in that matter. The setting design and make-up is delicious and Anne Rice's script (from her landmark novel in the genre... yes, I AM a die-hard fan!) is as tight as a movie adaptation can manage and do justice, unless elaborated into a 3-hour version, that is (which I think could work, too). The voice-over technique flows fine and handles the occasional awkward tongue-in-cheek elements quite well. Some genuine scares grab you firmly by the throat, not to forget.The cast is surprisingly fitting. Pitt is quite an ideal choice as Louis, evoking not too much sympathy in his frustration. However, upon knowing Cruise was to do Lestat, I remember moaning in despair - he was SO physically wrong! But he IS very good, witty and carrying just that right sarcasm for the part. But it's a final highlight (also titillating, years later, knowing her work as an adult) to see a brilliant Dunst as young Claudia. She's just luminous in her devilishness!The only thing here that I miss from the novel is the sequence from Eastern Europe where Louis encounters the sad, beastly branch developed out of the vampire species; which I found an interesting comparison and analogy to disabled humans.8/10 from Ozjeppe.",8,1,2,16 April 2004
Slumdog Millionaire," Most of the way an exhilarating, visually blinding rags-to-riches tale!
","In contemporary Mumbai, teenage telemarketing company clerk Jamal gets a shot at winning the jackpot on the famous TV quiz show 'Who wants to be a millionaire'... and after suspicions of how a poor, uneducated slumdog like him can get so far, he is arrested, accused of cheating.Oscar-winning, widely praised urban rags-to-riches story gets a tremendous boost from the ingenious, dream-like (yet not too unrealistic) idea of connecting Jamal's ability to know the answers with crucial details of his hard childhood as an orphan, beggar and petty thief. Most of the time an exhilarating movie, filled with both harrowing and joyful scenes of impoverished street children's conditions.Told like a blindingly visual tornado, swirlingly paced, edited and photographed, in the similar style - and in bits, theme - of 'City of God'. It could have used more of that latter film's jagged edge, though, as the overall impact is marred by slightly sugary and conventional finale and the one-dimensionality of surrounding characters: The bad guys are extremely bad, and the role of Latika is unfortunately diminished into a flat love interest without a personality of her own. Still extremely sympathetic and an interesting comparison to 'Salaam Bombay'.7 out of 10 from Ozjeppe",7,2,5,28 July 2010
The Social Network," High-profile, but overly hyped entertainment that might date quickly over time (maybe like Facebook itself?).
","Internet site Facebook founder Mark Zuckerberg in Jessie Eisenberg's lanky shape is not a very sympathetic figure: a fast-babbling and socially awkward misfit who was dumped by his girlfriend, and whose embryo of FB started out as a good looking girls-ranking site as a pure act of revenge the same night as the break-up. Progressively, his character traits extend to a reckless million dollar entrepreneur of an unparalleled success concept of social media. Director David Finchers & scriptwriter Aaron Sorkins interpretation jumps between the legal process in the present (where his former college friends intend to sue the crap out of him, mainly for stealing the idea) and the skyrocketing rise of the Internet phenomenon in the past.A solid, high-profile piece of entertainment, with ear-bouncing dialog and fine performances... but it never takes off, dramatically nor emotionally to the heights that a first class movie must do. That visionary director Fincher is behind the helm is a bit hard to understand since the story is – albeit highly paced – unremarkably carried out and ultimately feels surprisingly flat and inadequate at this level of aim and talent involved (one visual 'wow' moment, though, is a rowing contest montage).Maybe this is the catch: it's most likely mainly made with the focus on the Facebook phenomenon being THE Zeitgeist No. 1 thing right now, and for that reason, opportunity must be seized before it fades. Zuckerberg's story might be interesting enough to film - in the long run - but his tale isn't over yet by far, and this chapter might just have been made too soon? Because to me, this movie is good but does definitely not have the whiz or character fate interest to warrant all the hype and high praise surrounding it. It wouldn't surprise me if it will date quickly over time (as FB itself might be?). Trent Reznors cool soundtrack is an asset, though! 6 out of 10 from Ozjeppe",6,4,7,1 October 2011
V for Vendetta," Majestic and rousing... sci-fi escapism at its grandest!
","Majestic, rousing saga set in England in the near future where a feisty young woman (Portman) is pulled into a rebellion against a fascist/totalitarian government, headed by mysterious leader Weaving. Long and absorbing; it manages to blend old-time matinée panache with frightening futuristic elements of the likes of '1984' and 'Twelve monkeys'. No serious strive for realism; (being based on the Alan Moore graphic novel as it is) it goes head-on for major and quite audacious escapism, with great results. Fine script is matched by equally impressive visual flair, so it's no surprise that the Wachowski brothers were behind this one. 'Remember, remember the 5th of November!' We sure will.8 out of 10 from Ozjeppe",8,1,2,15 October 2006
The Island," Swings playfully between tongue-in-cheek sci-fi and big, blistering action!
","Do not bother with this unless you're hopelessly hooked on good futuristic action, like myself! This hip, fly-tech, yet slightly longish hybrid rises impressively up from the cheesy 'Aeon Flux'-lookalike it initially threatens to turn out as. The set-up & story might not be totally original, but it really works and engages. It then swings non-stop between playful tongue-in-cheek (nice Scottish image gimmick by McGregor!) sci-fi and big, blistering chase scenes. It's like 'Capricorn One' mixed with 'THX 1138', 'The 6th day' and 'Minority report'... Too much? Corny? Not credible enough? Only if you want it to be! Good-looking stars, by the way and Buscemi is a hoot. 7 out of 10 from Ozjeppe",7,0,2,12 January 2007
