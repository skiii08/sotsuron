The Incredible Hulk," A fun summer flick!
","I always had concerns about how good this movie was gonna be. One thing for sure, it's more entertaining than the first. But it is not a great superhero movie (Iron Man was more rounded). But it's not really fair to compare it with Batman or Iron Man. Hulk is a far less complex character, so it was always going be hard to make a great movie on him. There are some cheesy & unexplained scenes, but not enough to hurt the film too much.However, there is enough in this movie to make it a good 'popcorn' flick. I liked how they did not rveal the Hulk fully till later; showing him through shadows was cool I felt. Norton was convincing as always, & there is some subtle humor here & there. The CGI is really good for the most part of the film, and the final fight was awesome (beats Iron Man's hands down). Abomination was a really cool adversary, & I hope to see more of him (yup a spoiler!).Overall, an entertaining summer flick.",6,3,4,21 June 2008
Sucker Punch," Delivers what it promised!
","Sucker Punch delivers exactly what it promised for those who enjoyed the trailer; awesome CGI and tons of entertaining action.It is short on story and there is hardly any character development. However, as always, Snyder delivers such a visual treat that I didn't care too much about the shortcomings and just sat back and enjoyed the action in the dream-world created by Browning's character. The movie moves at a great pace and features some fantastic action choreography, none more spectacular than the girls fighting robots on a train.Overall, I thoroughly enjoyed Sucker Punch and think all Zack Snyder fans will too.",9,8,18,27 March 2011
3:10 to Yuma," A fantastic Western!
","Absolutely brilliant!!...the best western I've seen since Proposition. Although the movie is a remake, the director does a wonderful job handling Hollywood's great Russel Crowe and the enormously talented Bale.The story is simple, but the characters just take control. Crowe plays his negative character with grace, gaining the viewer's respect as a famous outlaw. Bale is convincing as always, using his expressions to add depth to his struggling yet brave character. Ben Foster also delivers a fine performance as a menacing and loyal partner to Wade. All his scenes were top notch...he is a star in the making!A great movie for all western fans, worth traveling to Yuma for!",9,3,7,11 January 2008
In Bruges," A great crime dark-comedy
","This was a really good dark comedy. The story is unique and takes place in a beautiful setting, a nice contrast considering the ensuing bloodshed. The acting is good from everyone, and both Gleeson and Farrell make a great pair of hit men. It was also very nice to see Fiennes posing as a highly charged and funny crime-boss, despite his rather brief appearance.The humor, though subtle, is also good and consistent throughout the movie (clearly taking aim at America/Americans in a few instances). The director mixes all these elements well, delivering a beautiful (kudos to the cinematographer), engaging & entertaining dark crime comedy.Overall, I rate this as the best Colin Farrell movie, and my favorite movie of 2008 so far.",9,0,3,15 June 2008
Kung Fu Panda," An entertaining summer flick!
","Another highly entertaining flick from Dreamworks. Jack Black played a clumsy fat Panda to great effect, and was nicely complimented by the other animal characters. The story was very predictable, but the animation, pacing and great action made up for it. I loved the action sequences, particularly those involving the villain. Out of them all, the 'escape' was probably my favorite sequence.Though I wouldn't call it a classic, as it lacked the emotional touch of 'Nemo' & Lion King etc, it is entertaining for adults and kids alike, though it kinda seemed a little violent for kids (but then who really cares these days!).",8,3,4,19 June 2008
12 Angry Men," Fantastic jury drama!
","Out of all the famous and over-rated oldies I've seen, this one takes the cake! It has a brilliant script and even better screenplay. Considering that 95% of the movie takes place in one room, it is superbly executed by Lumet. Both Fonda and the angr...(read more) y character Cobb plays are excellent.I was thoroughly entertained during the running time, the cast and characters were all fantastic, and the situation they were all placed in made this a great movie-watching experience in film-making. But this is a thinking person's film, if you love court dramas, let me tell you this is one of the best of all time!",9,0,0,2 November 2008
The Other Boleyn Girl," Could have been better, but still worth it for those interested in the story
","Quite a good period-drama about a famous story of loyalty & betrayal. Though there were questions raised as to why American actresses were chosen to play such important 'english' roles, they did a good job. Potman proves again that she is a versatile...(read more) actress, & Johanson was OK. Bana's portrayal of a lustful king was quite bland and could have been given more substance. The settings & costumes gave the film an authentic feel, however some parts did feel rushed. I felt that the conflicting emotions depicted should have been explored further. For instance Catherine the great's role was lacking in substance, considering how loved she was as a queen.Overall, this was a good period-drama for those who enjoy the genre.",7,1,3,16 April 2008
Hellboy II: The Golden Army," More action & entertainment than the first!
","More entertaining & action-packed than the first. It's evident Del Toro has been let loose with a bigger budget; he delivers with beautiful visuals & very creative creatures. The film has it's cheesy moments, but a fan of the first one can simply no...(read more) t be disappointed with the sequel.In terms of characters, I liked that they gave Abe a larger role in this one, and the new team leader, Krauss, was also surprisingly good. I also loved the fighting style of the main villain Nuada.Overall, a visually rich & entertaining movie; another very good comic/superhero adaption this summer.",10,3,5,26 August 2008
Once," Simple & beautiful
","As simple as this movie is, it leaves a rather strong impact given its strong music & 'real' performances given by the actors involved. The movie is simply about two individuals who love music, and are brought together as a result. The performances a...(read more)re so genuine that it feels as if we're watching a live show rather than a film, The 'camcorder' direction also enhances its believability, and does not take away from both the hidden & real emotions that this film resonates. I really felt for the two leads, especially after seeing the ending.There are three fantastic songs in the film, including the Oscar winning 'Falling Slowly' which is simply superb! Overall, I wouldn't recommend this movie to many people as most won't be engaged by it, unless they like the style of music in the film and shots of numerous rehearsals and recordings. As for me, I thought it was a simple and sweet love story, topped off with some great music.",8,1,1,5 May 2008
Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid," The most entertaining Western I've seen!

The movie is about two likable, clumsy, and naive outlaws that seem to have met their match as they are track...(read more) ed down by 'unseen' experts. I believe this unseen element actually adds to the movie's strengths.Both Newman and Redford deliver smooth performances, and one can't help but root for their friendship and escape. I couldn't help notice how similar Brad Pitt looks to and acts like the young Redford! Overall, though a one scene could've been shortened, I felt this movie was well-acted, had good cinematography, and was well-directed. One of my favorite westerns!",10,0,2,2 November 2008
Sweeney Todd: The Demon Barber of Fleet Street," The best musical ever!
","Too many songs? yes! and I hoped Sacha Baron would have a larger role (his big break will have to wait)...however it's hard overlook the quality of the movie.This is an extremely good and well executed revenge story, with great singing and acting...(read more)g by Depp (truly Oscar worthy). The supporting cast was also really good. Though the songs were too many, some were good & essential to express what was going on in the characters' mind and the overall story. Burton was truly in his element with this dark themed drama, and used a terrific score to add to the movie's quality. He is a true artist, never failing to provide stunning imagery to add to the movie's mood.Overall this is one of the finest movies of 2007. Despite having 95% singing the film is quite engaging; leading us through the darkness towards the unpredictable finale.",9,0,2,25 January 2008
Shutter Island," A profound & captivating suspense drama.
","Scorsese's venture of making a noir thriller is an absolute treat; he has proved to me that his range is not limited to gangster dramas.This intense and captivating story has some really strong performances and a fantastic story. Moreover, the ending is one of the best I've seen in recent years. The audience can guess all they want, but Scorsese's balancing act between what is real and what is not is superb. It is not a simple twist, but a surprise with profound layers. You may have guessed it somewhat, but you will not soon forget it.Leonardo's acting is again as intense as only he can deliver, and he was phenomenal in a certain flashback towards the end. The supporting cast is bursting with talent and each and every individual delivers the goods.Overall, this movie is a real gem and people who enjoy well-crafted twists, wait till you see the ending of this one. It may be early, but this will surely be one of the best movies of 2010.",10,1,6,21 February 2010
Gone Baby Gone," The best detective movie of 2007, after Zodiac.
","An engaging detective story which is surprisingly well directed by Affleck. The story is well told, never getting slow, and carried smoothly by the improving Casey Affleck who gets to play a really good and challenging character. The film raises some...(read more) intriguing morality issues/dilemmas, making it last in memory even after the end credits. I also thought Harris did a really good job in his supporting but intense role. It has been a while since I have seen him in such a meaningful supporting role.Overall, this is one of the great detective movies I have seen, and certainly the best in 2007 after Zodiac.",9,1,2,7 January 2008
The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring," The perfect beginning...
","I must admit, I had never heard of the books when I first saw the trailer of this movie. The trailer just captured me, and i made a note to see this movie! I actually ended up walking in freezing temperatures to catch this flick when it was released on the big screen. I left the theater in awe of what I had witnessed, I was inspired! This was a fantastic beginning to the trilogy. The characters were given enough screen time to understand and support them through the rest of the trilogy. The visuals and effects were really nice, and the score was just perfect. The Mines of Moria was perhaps the best part of the film. Its environment was well captured, as it effectively created an eerie feeling.The movie passed like a breeze, despite its long running time, which was essential to capture the aura of the movie. The ending made everyone want more and set things up nicely for the other two sequels.",10,2,2,11 January 2008
No Country for Old Men," A brilliant dark thriller!
","A great movie which works despite having a simplistic script. The acting is top notch all round, particularly Bardem's, who pulls off the best villain I've seen since Hannibal Lector. His expressions are chilling and dialogue delivery is fantastic (best actor award coming up?). The film is gripping and has good dialogs. One of my favorite scenes in the movie is the motel one when Brolin discovers how he is being followed. It was intense and showed the quality of the directors. However, I wanted more from the ending of this film, but then again the director was merely following the book I suppose. But I feel it was not conclusive and satisfying enough, especially compared to the rest of the movie. All in all this is the best Coen brothers' movie, one that could take the cake come Oscar time.",8,1,3,5 January 2008
The Hobbit: The Desolation of Smaug," A fast-paced fantasy action blockbuster!
","Desolation of Smaug is a marked improvement from the first installment of The Hobbit. From the onset, I was quite surprised at how much of an action-movie this actually was; it barely tries to settle down to breathe. Despite being impressive, I noticed via the editing that many scenes with Beorn and in Mirkwood forest were left on the cutting floor for Jackson's inevitable extended editions. The adventure develops a new sense of urgency as we are now exposed to lands & characters previously unseen in Middle Earth and the escapade gets darker harking back memories of the greatness of LOTR. I have little doubt that once all 3 movies are released and seen as one, these will be worthy, but slightly lesser, companions to the LOTR trilogy.Once again, Jackson nails the epic adventure feel and the material is immediately transportive and captivating. We are introduced to some compelling supporting characters with varying screen-time. Beorn (Mikael Persbrandt) is visually rendered quite differently compared to the book and thankfully is not generic as described therein. He is given 'manimal' features & an alluring mystery that will surely make him a memorable character by the time we get to the final movie's climax & extended edition. Thranduil gives of this ethereal vibe and is superbly played by Lee Pace; giving us a different side & hence more weight to the Elves.Smaug, an iconic beast of Middle-Earth, is as magnificent as the book describes him to be. Cumberbatch's heavy vocals (with the help of some digital alterations) and movements (yes this is our first motion- captured dragon) make the villain more intimidating than merely size. Peter Jackson also nails his interactions with Bilbo as he did with Gollum in the last movie. The attention to detail on to the dragon is sublime and watching it talk and move is a truly mesmerizing & unforgettable experience. Avid fans were hoping Smaug would be the greatest dragon in cinematic history and that is the case as the character delivers in terms of both menace & personality. Smaug on screen encapsulates greed & bloated ego just as Tolkien inscribed.Even the characters not in the book, Legolas & Tauriel, added substance to the subplot. It's not a far stretch to imagine that Legolas would be present at the time the Dwarf-company passed through his father's realm. Also, I found Tauriel very likable indeed (nothing to do with her looks I assure you); her character brought both warmth & fierceness whereas the source had completely overlooked the gender.Other than character moments, the choreography of some of the action sequences was impressive. The spider attack and the barrel escape were tremendous; but the Bilbo's banter with Smaug & his resulting rage leads to an unexpected battle & fantastic cliffhanger that sets us up for another 12 painfully long months of waiting.Overall, while Desolation of Smaug deviates significantly from the book's lighter tone, it marvelously captures the grandiosity of the LOTR films & is technically masterful.",9,4,9,14 December 2013
The Assassination of Jesse James by the Coward Robert Ford," A beautiful western
","Another good Western to come out in 2007, along with 'Yuma', though this one is slower paced and more of a drama. In any case, the movie has great acting, beautiful direction, and a superb score. Affleck truly deserves the supporting actor nomination...(read more). The year 2007 will always be remembered on his resume' as a career defining one, after performing well in 'Gone Baby Gone'.There are two things that hurt this movie; the length could have been easily reduced and it is probably what hurt it when it came to awards considerations and attracting crowds. Yes a lot of time was taken with expressions and landscape shots, however there was still room to shorten it up considerably. The second drawback of the movie was its long and spoiler of a title. It obviously gives the story away, not just by saying what will happen, but also by who. Had the title been more subtle, simply 'Jesse James' perhaps, the movie would have been unpredictable and more suspenseful.However, this is a solid movie, worth watching for Western fans. This movie probably rates as my 3rd favorite Western after 'The Proposition' and '3:10 to Yuma'.",9,0,1,30 January 2008
The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey," A Nostalgic Return.
","From the great list of directors the world has seen, none are more deserving to be called the king of fantasy than Peter Jackson. His ability to adapt material & transport an audience is incredible. He now gives us an evocative & welcome return to Middle Earth with a lighter story but with some of the same & plenty of new characters. The world of film was never quite the same since Lord of the Rings wrapped up. The stakes here are not as high as the previous trilogy, but the level of epicness is apparent & the story promises to get darker over the next two installments.The movie as plenty of great cinematic moments; the prologue and final escape/battle but what stands out (my favorite chapter in the book) is Riddles in the Dark with Gollum and Bilbo; it is pure cinematic magic. Jackson creates drama & intrigue from an outcome many of the viewers are familiar with. It was the movie's best part & it proves that Freeman was the perfect casting choice for Bilbo.The newer aspects of the adventure story; dwarven culture, goblins/orcs with a slight narrative arc, and a new wizard makes the film feel richer. Richard Armitage gives a commanding performance as Thorin & will likely be one of the new trilogy's most endearing characters. We're one movie in and you can already tell his character has been fleshed out nicely. His 'far over the misty mountains' song with the dwarfs was chilling. It may be Bilbo's story, but the changes Thorin undergoes during the 3 films will be just as significant. Jackson made a bold decision to include all of the books 13 dwarfs and gives them distinct personalities and design (something the book clearly failed to do). Though not accomplished yet, by the end of the trilogy I am sure most will be easily identified; that's saying something for a large group of secondary characters. The goblins are given character; an underground monarchy as well as a intimidating chief antagonist with a bone to pick with the dwarf leader. I also loved the new nature-centric wizard, Radagast, and look forward to how his story plays out. All these elements greatly enhance Tolkein's version of the book in my opinion and makes the narrative more interesting.Jackson's trademark epic sweeping shots & battle sequences are evident again and add to the film's grandeur. Howard Shore's musical genius also marks a return mixing some familiar notes with new themes.Overall, Jackson was born to bring Tolkeins work on the big screen (and his own little additions and subtractions here & there). He captures the book's lighter tone (even the songs!) while setting up a greater & darker epic for the later installments. So sit back, relax, & enjoy the adventure.",9,4,13,14 December 2012
Gone Girl," Fincher sticks close to his idiom and creates something exquisite & memorable.
","Gone Girl marks a kind of evolution in David Fincher's filmography. It's possibly his most provocative film along with Fight Club; one that will lead to the most conversation and filled with the most humor (the darker kind of course). It explores relationships and the media circus as well. Other than that you see what Fincher has delivered for most of his career; an engrossing, uneasy, and at times horrifying storyall making for an exceptional drama.It starts off as a conventional missing-person story but midway the 'mystery' is uncovered; the story has way more up its sleeve. What follows is a deliciously twisted cat-and-mouse game between characters that are going to be amongst cinema's most memorable. There is an addictive brand of insanity which unravels in Gone Girl that's previously unseen in Fincher films.An expectedly sinister mood hangs over the story which is substantially heightened by Trent Reznor's music which is largely understated but piercing in the right moments. Apart from that, the film is an exhibition of Fincher's expertise; adding layers of drama & texture leading to a climax that fulfills and even exceeds expectations.Ben Affleck gets an excellent role and displays how effective he can be given the right character. But it is Rosamund Pike who steals the show. Her performance is a revelation of sorts; playing a character that is a mere presence initially but then takes command of the story and lures us in. The supporting cast is also notable and plays to the film's advantage in many stages; Carrie Coon, Kim Dickens, and Tyler Perry excel in their parts.Overall, Gone Girl is an outstanding exercise in characters taking charge despite the concept of mystery at its core. Fincher sticks close to his idiom and creates something exquisite & memorable.",9,2,13,6 October 2014
Django Unchained," Tarantino's western gem.
","There must be something in Tarantino's diet that makes him consistently produce these twisted and ingenious movies. Django tells a blood-soaked tale involving slavery, ruthless characters & encounters, and humorthe usual Tarantino recipe. The man is booked for the hall of fame but that his material continues to impress & stand-out from the crowd is remarkable.If there was one thing I have wanted to see on film it is Leo in a Tarantino movie (now I want Tom Cruise in one, being spoiled often leads to this). Leo passed on the villainous role in Inglorious Basterds, but this time he has embraced it and is having a blast with it. He plays a diabolical man with an equally conniving right hand man played by Samuel L. Jackson. The man Tarantino discovered, Christoph Waltz (who got Leo's role in Basterds in the end) is on the 'good' side this time, but is equally electric. It's funny that the title character actually takes a back-seat as the bigger supporting names take over the film. But Jamie Fox does well with what he is given, and Will Smith must be kicking himself for passing up on a Tarantino movie.This is Tarantino's longest movie, but for those of you who are familiar with his skill-set, that length should not be a concern. The long talking sequences, inspired music choice & timing, bursts of violence, and great characters make it a great package and one the best movies of the year. So long as Tarantino (his imagination at least) is in the movie business, there is always something to look forward to.",8,2,7,29 December 2012
The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers," The perfect sequel!
","Another brilliant display by P.J.Carrying on the adventure, we are introduced to one of film history's 'classic' characters, Gollum. His character is one of the most endearing in the trilogy, hats of to the CGI and the great work of Andy Serkis.Moreover, The Battle of Helm's Deep was truly spectacular. The mood, the settings, the calm, the tension, and the music was all top notch. I don't see how we can ever see a better battle on screen! Overall, this was another masterpiece from P.J, who once again sets up the following part, the finale, well.",10,0,3,11 January 2008
The Amazing Spider-Man 2," Pretty close to Amazing...
","The Amazing Spiderman 2 is comes pretty close on the promise of that second word in its title. From fantastic visuals that include easily the best Spidey swinging sequences to the potent chemistry between Andrew Garfield and Emma Stone, the film possesses plenty of absorbing elements.The character of Spider-Man is in his element in this version; more confident, in tune with his abilities, and constantly reaching for that comic banter. As Peter Parker however, he is more conflicted as he constantly battles between abandonment issues of the past and progressing forward with Gwen Stacy. The latter relationship is in fact the heart of the film; there is some cheesiness but both Garfield and Stone are so adorable & genuine together that it's easy to let them carry on falling over each other. Garfield is probably the best actor I have seen along with Robert Downey Jr. & Christian Bale to play a superhero, showing a tremendous range of emotions & earnestness.The villains of the film are a bit too comical for my liking, especially in their motivations. But hey, at this point I'm not sure what I want to see from them as long as their powers allow them to put up a decent fight. Jamie Foxx is given an excellent sequence at Times Square when he first comes head-on against our titular character. Marc Webb's direction in that scene is excellent as he creates an epic showcase using slow motion and wide-shots. He also manages to form a dramatic finale and one 'big' moment in particular that many superhero movies fall short on in terms of impact and resonance.Overall, The Amazing Spiderman 2 never felt over bearing to me despite all the characters involved. It got me excited for the grander Spider- Man universe with the help of gripping story-telling, exhilarating action sequences, and emotion.",9,3,10,4 May 2014
The Curious Case of Benjamin Button," The best movie of 2008!
","You can always count on Hollywood to turn even a silly sounding concept into a masterpiece of a movie. For me, Button is the movie to beat in 2008. It succeeds on many fronts and is a pure best picture contender.The movie is filled with good performances, most notably Brad Pitt. His was not a performance of explosive dialog but one that required expressions that told us what he was experiencing; and he did an excellent job. The characters brought alive the various emotions in the story, which built its way to become a poignant tragedy.David Fincher took the movie to another level using a fantastic storytelling technique, and he can be thankful to the spectacular cinematography which made the movie look so rich and alive. The movie had an excellent blend of humor as well, which was a perfect aid for its long running time.The style of the movie reminded me of Forrest Gump in some ways i.e. it was a story about life with a unique perspective; and just like Gump it is a masterpiece.",10,1,3,27 December 2008
Prisoners," Brilliant!
","Prisoners is nothing short of a scary movie; for a parent the horror will likely be tenfold. It is an engrossing& harrowing story of a father & detective taking different roads to find two abducted children. A seemingly generic plot on the surface is infused with such bone-chilling tension, dread, and artistic strokes that it eventually becomes a different beast altogether.The father is Hugh Jackman, who delivers a scorcher of a performance! Take away Wolverine's claws & replace it with raw emotional weight and you have Jackman's character Keller Dover. Jake Gyllenhaal is also incredibly impressive playing a character struggling between his procedural job & natural instincts. Terrance Howard, Viola Davis, & Paul Dano also put in excellent performances in their respective supporting roles.The movie, a long procedural hearkens back to Fincher's murder mysteries. In fact, given the pace, narrative quality, & sharp editing one could be excused for mistaking it as such. That is a well-earned compliment for the director Denis Villeneuve. Although in a different context when compared to Seven, the film possesses a layer of religious insinuation that adds interest to the story-structure.The film proudly shows off Roger Deakins cinematography in what may be his best work considering that this is not a spectacle movie or one shot in some iconic location. His skills elevate the production with gorgeous lighting & camera-angles. It is a technical aspect many will overlook in the dreary setting of the story, but is major strength of the film. Nowhere is it punctuated better than in a brief night-time driving sequence towards the end of the film.Overall, Prisoners is a dramatic & nerve-grinding thriller of the highest order. It is a slow-burn drama that is a fitting companion-piece to films like Seven & Zodiac.",9,1,4,27 September 2013
The Dark Knight," Brilliant Film-making!
","There comes a movie once in many years that shakes up a genre with such intensity that it ends up becoming an icon. The Lord of the Rings trilogy did it for Fantasy/epics, and now The Dark Knight has done it for superhero movies. Yes its the best one ever! C. Nolan is one of my favorite directors, and he truly comes of age with this effort. Forget the fact that its a great superhero movie, its a fantastic crime drama. The direction is superb, and Nolan has churned out a fantastic screenplay along with his brother. I am glad he also pulled up his socks on the action department (which was lacking in Batman Begins). The chase sequences and the Hong Kong venture were terrific. Nolan remains true to the dark nature of Batmans character & surroundings (aided perfectly by the fantastic score). However his two Batman films have reached such a level of excellence that I would never want to re-visit any old Batman film. I cant imagine any cast replacing Nolans. One person that certainly deserves mention is the cinematographer. Considering how dark the film is (literally) its remarkably vivid (reminiscent of the under-rated Collateral).Christian Bale is the ultimate Batman. He once again smoothly plays his tormented character & his Interrogation scene with Ledger will go down as a classic. Speaking of Ledger, he truly overshadows everyone in this film, and his screen time is satisfying. The Joker commands attention in every scene he is in, and delivers lines that will go down in cinema folklore. Heath has made joker my favorite villain along with Hopkins Hannibal. Ledger literally made Jack Nicholsons version look like a joke (that is no small feat). His voice, walk, & expressions are just perfect. The most interesting & crazy thing about him was that he had no real agenda. He wanted nothing other than chaos. Hollywood truly lost a star in the making (and is a serious blow to the potential third installment); this was going to be his launching pad to greater things. His loss will hurt the Batman franchise since the jokers story is never concluded. I will not get carried away & say that they should hand the supporting Oscar to Ledger (we have not seen the contenders). However Heath certainly deserves a nomination.Despite the dominance of the Joker, the Dark Knight is really about a white knight, Harvey Dent, played smoothly by Eckhart; could be a career-changer. His is a sad story, going from a man who prefers conventional ways to deal with crime, to becoming the maniacal Two-Face. Though his evil side gets little screen-time his character got enough time for me to empathize with his transformation (it was not as bad as how Venom was handled in Spiderman 3). Moreover, I thought the look of Two-Face was a realistic departure from the comic realm (and also nothing like Tommy Lee Jones silly version).Overall, this is a masterpiece of a movie (the best of 2008 thus far). I do not see how even Batman 3 can improve on it. I hope TDK gets some healthy Oscar nominations (at least); Ledger for best supporting actor, best director, best screenplay, best score, and best cinematography. A must-watch & must buy for all movie fans!",10,6,13,5 October 2008

I also liked how the story was presented, going back & ...(read more)forth to show how Hirsch's character fulfills his dreams, and people he encounters on his journey. It's interesting to see the impact of the people he meets, the full realization of it revealed in the tragic end.

Moreover, the music is also superb, it was great to hear Eddie Vedder back at what he does best.Overall, a fascinating adventure story.",9,2,6,9 February 2008
Avatar," Entertaining movie with great visuals but one that falls short on good characters and a solid story.
","Cameron's 15 year in-the-making vision comes to life in all its visual glory. He envisioned a spectacular world and Peter Jackson's Weta studios does an amazing job to bring it to life. The attention to detail and the creatures is really impressive. My favorite scenes of the movie were the flying ones (jaw-dropping) and the final battle.However, if Cameron had put the same sort of effort towards the story this would have been a movie for the ages. Too often the movie reminded me of a combination of Dances with Wolves, Jurassic Park, and Pocahontas; leading it to be quite predictable. The villains were one-dimensional, and some scenes were quite unnecessary (tribal mumbo-jumbo), and the whole political and environmental viewpoints. As for the 3d aspect of it, yes it does give the viewer an immersive experience, but it doesn't make or break the movie in my opinion (I'm yet to buy into this whole 3d riff raff) Overall, this is a movie that should be seen by everyone for its stunning visuals and for its purely entertaining adventure story .",7,1,5,22 December 2009
Pulp Fiction," A highly entertaining dialog-oriented flick!
","A fantastic dialog- oriented movie. This is easily Tarantino's best effort. Though I did not appreciate this movie the first time I saw it, I now know why it is a cult classic. The characters are good and the dialogs are intriguing. S.Jackson was...(read more) easily the best actor for me, delivering the best lines, while the rest of of the cast was also good. The duo of Jackson and Travolta goes down as one of my favorites ever; they both complemented each other really well. The chemistry between Thurman & Travolta was also quite effective.This dark comedy also has some great funny moments which never lets the movie drag despite its lengthy running time.Overall, a highly entertaining dark comedy packed with great lines & acting. A Tarantino classic.",8,0,1,3 June 2008
The Wrestler," Fantastic Movie!!
","Wow, Talk about a comeback role for Rourke. He was born to play this one it seemed. I gotta give credit to Aronofsky for making this documentary style drama. He follows Rourke in multiple scenes with the camera to highlight who the movie is all about. The movie was not simply about wrestling, but about the life of a struggling individual wanting more from life.The music was perfectly used, held back even, to make the emotions stand out. Also, I loved how in the last fight of the movie Randy's entry was to my favorite Guns N Roses song. It made for a real cool entry I thought.Mickey Rourke has given us an Oscar worthy performance. Sean Penn stands in his way, and though Penn's performance may have been better, my emotional preference is Rourke. His expressions were excellent, and his character felt so real, everything from the tears, stunts, and injuries. Tomei also gave a really good supporting performance, and could be rewarded with a nomination.I just wish this movie was getting more buzz for best picture. As of now it's one of the dark horses for the last spot. It could easily replace, and should replace, Slumdog Millionaire or Frost/Nixon. But no matter what occurs, this is a great film.",10,0,1,6 January 2009
The Hobbit: The Battle of the Five Armies," Beautifully punctuates its association to the greater saga...
","The fifteen year middle-earth adventure helmed by Peter Jackson comes to a close in The Battle of the Five Armies. As an amalgamation of emotion and spectacle, this ranks high in the saga for me. The action highlight in the movie, as made evident from the title, is an immense climactic battle. But there is also a clash of a more mystical nature involving the older guardians of Middle-Earth, in Dol Guldor, that is short but spectacular. On a more human level, this final chapter features the profound tragedy missing in the LOTR trilogy. For the first time in a Middle-Earth movie there is no prologue as we straightaway witness Smaug the dragon's incredibly visualized assault on Laketown; an airborne dragon attack has never looked so magnificent. It is a brief but satiating appetizer for the adrenaline to get going. From there the movie changes gears to set-up a few things & allows the characters to take over. Bilbo (Freeman) and Thorin (Armitage) deliver some great moments. Looking back at all 6 films there is no doubt Bilbo will be remembered as the definitive Hobbit; he brings the character to life through copious expressions & mannerisms which add warmth to the role. In the previous films he shared great moments with Gollum and Smaug while here his notable scenes are in the presence of or in context to Thorin. The said dwarf king, consumed by greed, is also a memorable personification of an anti-hero. It's interesting to witness the trajectory his character goes through during the trilogy; from a single-minded steely determination to total disintegration. He manages to generate substantial empathy through this process. Most of the other important supporting characters get to shine in individual moments. Ryan Gage's role, as the cowardly Alfrid, was the bleak film's only comedic relief and he was unexpectedly excellent. Gandalf (Ian Mckellon) is incredible as usual and reinforces himself as my favorite character in all the 6 pieces of this wondrous adventure. Jackson also wonderfully weaves in smaller details & subplots in the film to connect the story to the world & time of LOTR. Gandalf's side-expedition, which was essentially nondescript in the book, gained traction in the middle film and now comes full circle with a brief but rousing finish. Some editing and missing through-lines suggest that fans will again need to rely on an inevitable extended edition for the definitive version of the film.Aesthetically and in terms of scale, Peter Jackson forms a smaller but distinct looking final conflict from the two major battles of the LOTR films (Helm's Deep & Pelennor Fields). It is more logistical in nature and he captures it nicely using a floating virtual camera giving us appealing wide-angle shots. The chaotic clash takes place against the backdrop of the Lonely Mountain and on its snowy/frozen fringes making the battlefield an actual character. The amount of detail and individual heroic-character moments is abundant; for every over-the-top Legolas moment there are others that left me in admiration of the landscapes and battle-choreography on display. Also, the fact that there are tragic incidents in this conclusive chapter makes it leave an arguably greater emotional impact than any LOTR film. Looking back at the Hobbit trilogy it's hard for me not to look at these films through a haze of nostalgia. They are less complex and lesser as a result compared to LOTR trilogy. But they still feel transcendent & cinematic and the final delivers in terms of scale & emotional involvement.Overall, Battle of the Five Armies beautifully punctuates its association to the greater Middle-Earth saga that follows. It also affectionately conveys a sense of completion to Bilbo's grand adventure. Jackson's ambition deserves to be lauded as he ends his Middle-Earth journey and for me, cinema will not be the same... well, at least December won't. *I look forward to re-reviewing/re-grading the entire Hobbit trilogy after watching their definitive extended editions.",9,2,5,22 December 2014
Iron Man," R. Downey Jr. made this movie & gives rise to possibly a fantastic franchise!
","Robert Downey Jr. owns this movie and deserves full credit for its success. He is at his witty best, and delivers the best super-hero performance in cinema history as far as I'm concerned. I don't think any other actor could have pulled off the mix o...(read more)f humor and seriousness that made Iron Man's character so likable. Moreover, It was great to see Bridges in a negative role, and he pulled it off effortlessly.As far as the story goes, it is well crafted and since it's an origin story it takes its time in a few parts ,and in the end sets up a sequel quite nicely. The effects and action are quite good, though people may have wanted more. I left the theater satisfied! Overall, a highly entertaining superhero movie thanks to the great performance by R.D. Jr. This is my second favorite superhero movie of all time after Batman Begins (Though I think Dark Knight will soon take the top spot). However as far as Marvel movies go, this one is by far the best (sorry spider-man, you promised more!). All comic movie fans will enjoy this one!",9,1,3,5 May 2008
Fantastic Mr. Fox," One of the best movies of 2009!
","This film had one of the most unappealing trailers I've seen, due to the 'old-school' animation, but I had to see this because of Anderson's reputation and the positive response from the critics. I'm glad I did because this is a movie I thoroughly enjoyed. Once you pass the initial few minutes the animation style actually grows on you as a fantastic story unveils. The soundtrack is crisp and the movie has some great characters. This is one of the best roles Clooney has played. His voice was perfect for the lead character.I have always appreciated Anderson's movies for their originality, but they have always missed the mark of greatness. This one however did excel due to its great plot, pacing, music, and characters.Despite having plenty of clever laughs Fox is not really for children. There is a certain complexity in the mix which makes it more fun for adults than kids I would think (much like Coroline and Where the Wild Things are).Overall, this is one of my favorite films of the year and the best movie Anderson has made.",10,4,8,8 December 2009
The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King," The icing on the cake:)
","A fantastic close to this epic masterpiece! There were so many great scenes before the chaos of the final mammoth battle begins: The beginning of the film was really good as it showed the development of Gollum into the monster he became; the 'lighting of the beacons' was very well executed; the scene where Faramir is riding to his death, while Pippin sings to his evil father was truly haunting; Shelob's lair was another great part of the story...more great effects; the undead soldiers' cave sequence was very nice, and a nice addition...as it seemed impossible for good to have overcome evil without their assistance.Finally the epic battle of Minas Tirith! All hell brakes loose in this one...there are fantastic fights in this one: The Nazguls in flight, the mythic elephants trampling everything, Eowyn's fight with the Nazgul, Gandalph's face-off with the Nazgul etc etc!! There were some complaints to the long ending of the movie. I disagree, as a friend of mine put it...a movie and story that has given the movie world so much deserves a celebration of 20 minutes! Overall, this trilogy is my favorite movie of all time. Hats off to P.J and the entire team for bringing this remarkable and complex adventure to life! Deserves every praise possible! For the true fans out there I recommend they buy the extended version of the trilogy to enjoy more depth and visual treats!Bring on 'The Hobbit'!",10,1,6,11 January 2008
Moon," Best Sci-fi movie of the year (and in years)
","One of the best sci-fi (drama) movies I've seen in a long time. A small-scale movie with a brilliant concept is presented really well by Jones. It is a dialogue movie which just gets better and better as the full scale of the intriguing plot emerges.Sam Rockwell gives his career best performance, and I sincerely hope, come awards season, his efforts are recognized (he could well be a dark horse for the best actor Oscar as well). Other than the great story and acting, the music supports the movie really well also.Overall, this may not be a movie for everyone (especially non Sci-fi fans) but it is definitely worth giving a shot. The story will get you thinking about the movie after you view it, and Rockwell fans (those who felt he deserved a break-out movie) are in for a treat.",10,1,2,22 December 2009
Slumdog Millionaire," Good, but not Great as everyone makes it out to be
","So did the movie live up to all the Oscar buzz going around? well, in part yes.I gotta say thoroughly enjoyed the first half of the film. It was wonderfully shot; I loved the sequence where the slum boys were being chased with A.R. Rehman's fantastic score in the background. Moreover, the acting of the youngest versions of Salim and Jamal were fantastic.However, the second half kinda let me down a bit. I was not impressed with the older versions of the the lead actors, especially Saleem. He was such a good character at the start but his older version was a poor actor and it just turned into a weak role. Also, the ending could've been better thought out I felt. It was too predictable for me.Overall, this still is a really solid movie, and is definitely one of the year's good ones.",1,33,66,30 December 2008
Atonement," Beautiful storytelling
","This is one solid movie, and will no doubt win some awards, mostly the technical ones i feel.It is beautifully directed, has a great score, acting, and cinematography. One continuous/tracking shot on the beach is worth a mention; it was a very nice scene(one Spielberg would've been proud of). The movie can be a bit slow for some, but it seems that's how these war-romance dramas are, just like Cold Mountain. Both the lead actors were good, but I do not see them winning any awards for this one.Overall, a great movie making spectacle...I wont be surprised if this one gets the nomination for best picture!",9,1,4,5 January 2008
