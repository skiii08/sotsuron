Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," GREAT movie. We NEED such modern-day myths.
","I thought this was a GREAT movie.It had EVERYTHING that a great myth needs: -good versus evil storyline -heroes and villains -danger and rescuesWhy do people try to tear it down as such a bad movie?Detractors must not know that Lucas wrote this movie for 13 year old boys. (His own words.)  It was SUPPOSED to have a simple storyline, with clearly delineated ideas of good and evil, and be supported by fantastic visual effects.  That is why the first film has stood the test of time.  We NEED such modern-day myths.  Rarely in modern culture is there such promotion of honor, courage, and a sense of right and wrong.100 years from now people will watch it and understand the struggle between good and evil and that the courage and heroism of the few can overcome certain defeat.By the way, I'm tired of all the b*tching about the implied ethnicity of the character's voices.  Lucas could have: A) created gibberish (like Huttese) with captioning.  I HATE this!  It makes it hard for people with limited eyesight and/or reading skills (i.e. little kids) to follow the storyline AND it makes you read dialogue rather than enjoy the stunning visual effects.  B) have all the characters speak in the queen's English like all the 'serious' films do.  There's already TOO much of that with Qui-Gon, Obi-Wan, Queen Amidala, Palpatine... Do I need to go on? C) make up some 'new' accent - maybe like the squid guy in Fox TV's 'Futurama'.  That would have been cool and would have taken some creativity but then the same people would be b*tching about how hard they were to understand.In my opinion these people decided BEFORE they saw the movie that they were going to find something wrong with it and supposed 'racism' is very easy and safe to get outraged about.  I'm Hispanic and don't get offended when movie Hispanics speak with a thick accent.  SOME OF US SPEAK THAT WAY!!!!  I only get offended when it is specifically SAID or IMPLIED that 'Hispanics do this...' or 'Hispanics are like that...'  So, to all the offended parties (which I have a hunch are NOT Jamaican, Asian, or Middle Eastern) GET OFF YOUR HIGH HORSE!!",10,0,0,6 July 1999
