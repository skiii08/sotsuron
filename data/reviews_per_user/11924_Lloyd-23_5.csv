The Blair Witch Project," Tense, unsettling, original, intelligent, short, cheap.
","This film is not a feature film.  For a start, it is not feature length, also, it is not shot on film.  More importantly, it does not have what feature films have these days: star actors, special effects, exotic locations, explosions.  Instead, seeing B.W.P. is seeing something else that a cinema can be: a place where people can share an intimate experience created by a few people on a tight budget.  I would be glad of its success if only for that reason.The first section of the film appears at first to be amateurish and slow. In fact, it is very deft, and very efficient at what it does.  It tells the audience everything it needs to know about the characters and situation, and nothing more.  Also, it gets the audience into the habit of viewing the film's format: alternating between black and white (very grainy and poorly focussed) film, and the washed out colours of shaky pixilated video.  The film makers managed to set up a rationale for why the film is so cheaply made.  Three people hike into the woods for a few days to shoot a documentary, with borrowed equipment, and are in the habit of videoing everything for the hell of it.   They cannot carry tripods, steadicams, dollies, large lighting rigs, or the like, so everything we see is lit either by raw daylight, or by a single light fixed to the camera, which illuminates just what is within a few feet of the lens.  The film creates its own excuse to be cheap.  This is intelligent.The acting and script are both excellent.  The well-cast actors are presumably playing pretty-much themselves, and are convincingly naturalistic, and neither too likeable or too dislikeable.  The slow route into hysteria is well documented.  Rather than simply having a character say 'We're lost!', we see many scenes which show the trio getting more and more hopelessly lost, and more annoyed with each other for this.  By the time they are thoroughly lost, the audience shares the despair.My friend and I, after seeing it, both felt a little sick.  I put this down to my having been tense for a hour, he put it down more to motion sickness. The jerky, badly-framed camerawork is hard on the eye and stomach, but I applaud the director for its uncompromising use.  Similarly, no compromise is made with the dialogue.  Some of it is very quiet and must be listened for, some is technical jargon, which is left realisticly unexplained.One of the great strengths and weaknesses of the film is the editing.  It is good in that it does much to heighten the tension, with many key moments lasting just a little too long for comfort.  Each time the characters find something nasty, the viewer is made to want the editor to cut soon to the next scene, and the fact that he doesn't adds to the sense of being trapped, as the characters are.  The problem with this, though, is that one is left wondering about the motives of the fictional editor.  In truth, of course, the film is edited to create these effects, and to entertain, but the film's rationale is that these are the rushes of a documentary put together posthumously by someone other than the film's original creator.  Why, then, would an editor piecing together such footage, edit for dramatic effect rather than for clarity?  Why would he keep cutting back and forth from the video footage to the film footage, when neither shows any more information than the other?The film is stark.  After one simple caption at the start, all that follows is the 'rushes'.  I wonder if the film might not have been improved with an introductory section which documented how the rushes were found and edited. A programme was made for television which did this.  Perhaps a portion of this might have been added to the film, making it more complete, and more believable (and proper feature length).While I applaud the fact that young original film-makers have managed to create a mainstream hit out of a simple idea, well-handled.  I dread the possible avalanche of inferior copies which may come.Most horror films these days are created not for the audience, but for the makers.  The departments of special effects, make-up, model-making, animation and so forth all try hard to show potential future employers what they can do.  The result is that nothing is left for the audience to do, since everything can be seen and heard, and the viewer's imagination can be switched off.  Today, it is possible to see pigs fly on the screen, and so film-makers show off and show us a formation of Tamworths, which is something which will look impressive in the trailer.  To show us less is to make our minds fill in the gaps.  This way, we create our own terrors, perfectly fitted to ourselves.  The ghastly face I see in my head, is the ghastly head which I find scary.  The ghastly face I am shown may be one I can cope with quite easily.  If I see a believable character screaming in hysterical fear at something I cannot see, my own brain creates demons for my night's dreams, demons far more mighty than anything CGI graphics or a latex mask could portray.This film will stay in your thoughts for some while.",Null,321,454,3 November 1999
Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," I look forward to Episode Two.
","Star Wars is one of the all-time classic movies which people love.  The Empire Strikes Back is a lot weaker, has no pace, no form, and no satisfactory ending (but great music), and Jedi pushed Mark Hamill's acting ability beyond breaking point, and involved Ewoks (my friends all like the bit when the walker trod on a few of them).  Phantom Menace had a lot to follow.First, a comment of the SFX.  They are good.  Though computer animation still usually looks like computer animation, it has to be admitted that this is about the best to be done so far.  The character of Jar Jar Binx (a few shots excepted) is better animated than the human cast.  Alas, though, many of the special effects are gratuitous, the most obvious example of this being the underwater journey through the core of the planet - a wholly silly sequence.This film contains several revelations which I did not like about THE FORCE. Whereas Obi Wan in Star Wars told us that The Force surrounds all living creatures, in this film we find a creature immune, for plot reasons, to The Force.  Also, a few times the 'Will of The Force' is mentioned.  This suggests that THE FORCE is an intelligence, like a monotheist god, and that this intelligence has desires and plans.  Surely it is better to have TF as something which people can use to good or evil, an energy source which a few talented people can make use of.  If TF is all-powerful and has a will, then surely the events we are seeing are all pre-destined and the characters merely puppets.Anakin Skywalker, played by a child with a wildly over-cute face, is introduced to us as a mechanical genius.  For some reason, it was thought a good idea to have him as the creator of C3-PO (so why didn't Darth Vader recognise him in the later episodes?), and as the builder of a tremendously fast racing machine.  Surely it would have been far better to have him with a strange social influence.  I'd have had him as the leader of a huge gang of children, many older than he, who all look out for his welfare, as their benign dictator.  Surely The Force has more effect on hearts and minds than on circuitry.The pod race is just an inferior Ben Hur, with a silly two-headed commentator.  Nothing very clever happens.Some say that the film is too obviously talking about the current real-world situation.  The Evil Trade Federation represent the Japanese, Corruscant and the Senate represent the USA, and Naboo represents Europe.  This is a fair point, and perhaps the film would have been better if such interpretations did not fit so well.On the plus side, it is EPIC, with impressive locations and a cast of thousands.  The sheer amount of design involved is staggering.  Huge numbers of creatures, buildings, costumes, and objects needed to be designed for this film.  Much of the design is good, and all the design is impressive because there is simply so much of it.  I for one liked the political plot in the  senate, which is not what I or many others were expecting.  This side of it was quite mature and interesting, although I doubt that the kiddiwinks would appreciate it much, but they have plenty to like, as there are lots of explosions.A definite low point is that the baddies are not very menacing.  The robots who die in droves do not look frightening (I love the design of the Star Wars storm-trooper uniforms), and move with daft slowness (and why didn't they have rubber soles to their feet for grip and quietness?), and so are just not at all scary.  They are even worse at shooting than the storm-troopers from the earlier films.  Whereas Darth Vader was an excellent villain, who appeared early on in Star Wars, who had lots of good powerful and evil dialogue, and who did much to shape events, instead we have Darth Maul, who has nothing to say, and is nothing more than a fighting machine.The Jedi are central to this film, and are alas one of its weaker points. Obi Wan and his master are very dull characters, and all suspense and mystery about them is thrown away.  After seeing Obi Wan use super-human agility, we are required to fear for him when he is hanging off a walkway. The Jedi in council (all male, so far as I can tell) are shown as vague and indecisive, and Yoda's eyes still don't seem to focus on anything, as though they were made of lumps of glass.Overall, I'd say that any Star Wars fan should see it, and it does set up the next film pretty well.  I want to see what happens next.  There are many niggling little flaws in it, some bits don't make sense, others are very predictable, but one would be missing out of a piece of world culture to miss it.",Null,0,0,30 September 1999
Monty Python's Life of Brian," An unusual double: profound and hilarious.
","The Python team succeeds in doing something which very few people can do. What's more, it makes it look easy.  One moment they are making a very clever joke, which takes a lot of understanding, which makes many references to culture and history, and which makes a very good point, and the next joke in the script is 'Shut up, Big Nose!'  All the way through, this pattern is repeated, and all the way through, both kinds of joke are very funny.The pace never lets up, and it moves from one excellent sequence to another, each one advancing the plot (with the probable exception of the bit with the space ship).  Along the way, one sees several classic moments which have since been much copied.  Where were they first?  In this film.  'What have the Romans ever given us?', 'Splitter!', 'Alms for an ex-leper!' - if you don't see this film, then you will be missing out on some important popular culture.The cast is excellent, and each of the Python team plays several roles, sometimes even having to do reaction shots to shots of themselves playing other parts.  This sort of ensemble casting is sadly rare in films, being a sort of theatrical ploy, and yet in this film it feels entirely natural.The film looks very good.  In fact, it is probably the most visually convincing depiction of life in a biblical city I have seen.  The Python team is made up of educated men, and these went to some effort to see that the costumes and sets, and atmosphere were up to scratch.  This re-enforces the comedy, and greatly re-enforces the profound elements of the film.There is a central message to this film, summed up in Brian's hilarious and desperate speech to the multitude which has gathered (''Popped by'? Swarmed by, more like!') outside his window.  It is that people should not follow religions like blind sheep, but should think for themselves.  Few more worthwhile and sound messages could be preached by anyone.  Don't take my word for it, though, decide for yourself.Along the way, many other points are made, each highlighting the petty-mindedness of humans.  This film comes highly recommended for viewing by the young.  It could be a good influence on them, I hope, and can make them only more reasonable and tolerant adults, assuming that they don't die young of an excess of laughing.There are only two films which always leave me wanting to see them again immediately: Gregory's Girl, and Life of Brian.  As soon as the end credits roll, I have the strong urge to rewind the tape and see it all again.'And there shall be a Man... and he shall lose his hammer, and think that's very odd, because he could remember exactly where he put it only the night before... about eight o'clock.'  That's the sort of prophet I like.",10,2,5,11 October 1999
Coriolanus," See it on the small screen. Great play, good script, decent acting, dreadful camera-work.
","Coriolanus is arguably Shakespeare's greatest play. I recall seeing it for the first time and being blown away by it. I thought that perhaps the Royal Shakespeare Company had altered it to make it seem more modern, but the words were the original bard's. This film sets the action in the modern world, and it does so successfully. Many of the words explaining events come in the form of televised newscasts, soldiers ride around on tanks and wear camouflage clothing, characters talk to each other on telephones, politicians wear suits, and public debates happen in television studios. All this is fine because the play's themes are so very modern.Naturally, the film script shortens the wordiness of the play, and naturally this has the effect of heightening the importance of some aspects, while diminishing others. The screenplay puts emphasis on the character of Coriolanus' mother, and the direction and acting suggests that Tullus Aufidius is to some degree attracted sexually to the eponymous hero. One theme oddly neglected, especially given the use of television in the film, is the fickleness of the common people. The later stages of the film never involve the common crowds of Rome again.The cast is good. The accents are a strange and unexplained mixture (Scottish, Northern Irish, English, as well as some Mediterranean ones) but this is of little consequence given that ancient Rome was probably also a mix, and the disjuncture of modern artefacts and archaic English is far greater.Now I come to the camera-work. The picture quality is very poor. My eyes tell me that it was not shot on film. There are many scenes deliberately low-quality, made to resemble television broadcasts, but even the scenes with the highest picture quality are a vague haze of visible pixels. When I pay to go to the cinema, I expect decent picture quality, and a large screen shows up every failing. The style of camera-work is that trendy 'reality television'/documentary style which involves wobbling the camera around a lot in supposed simulation of improvisation. This is almost always overdone, and in this case in some scenes the cameraman seems to be having an epileptic fit, and the picture will probably give you less of a headache on a smaller screen (which will also not show you the pixels so clearly).Another very annoying thing about the camera-work is that someone seems to have made the decision that a shallow depth of field is a good thing. Many of the shots are slightly out of focus, which is annoying (but will show less on the small screen). Worse, in the intense shots of actors faces in close-up, delivering key lines of dialogue, the camera should focus the mind of the audience on the expression of the actor's face and the meaning of the words he speaks. Actors move as they perform, and when the depth of field is this shallow, it becomes a great distraction that one notices that the tips of the actor's eyelashes are sharp, while the roots of them and his pupil are a blur.I recommend this film, mainly because it showcases a terrific play which deserves to be far better known. I also recommend seeing it on DVD. Given how bad the picture quality is, I suspect that the makers thought that they were shooting for a television release of the film, and that the demands of the big cinema screen were not considered important.",7,6,14,28 January 2012
Eyes Wide Shut," A very unusually bad film.
","By writing this, I am hoping that I will save people a lot of time and money.  Last night I went with a friend to see Eyes Wide Shut, Stanley Kubrick's final masterpiece.  Supposedly, he had wanted to make this film for twenty-seven years, and spent sixty-seven weeks shooting it, an incredible amount of time for a commercial film.  Being the sort of mug film buff that I am, I thought that I should go to see a film made by an acknowledged master, who had  spent so much time getting it just right.When the film finally ground to a halt, the audience in the cinema stood up and as one started muttering things like 'Is that it?',  'Thank goodness that's over' 'Well, you can see why there are only two showings per day', 'What a pile of ****'.  I have never heard a cinema audience respond so negatively to a film before.  We talked about it, and we had not a single kind word to say about it.  I have thought about it since, and find it void of redeeming features.It is badly photographed. The sets are often unconvincing. The acting is mediocre. The continuity is poor. The lighting is awful. The picture quality is poor.  It looks as though it was shot on 16mm, and the prints were made at Boots. Hardly anything happens which is believable. There are gaping holes in the plot. Worse than all the above, it is  incredibly  slow.  At no point does the pace quicken.  It is wildly too long. Every single conversation happens at a snail's pace.  Almost every conversation is punctuated by very long awkward pauses.  It seems as though Stanley thought about every scene so much in isolation, that each scene took on great significance, and to get the importance of what was happening across, he dwelt on every word and action.  Every scene could be halved in length and lose nothing and gain much.I was expecting a film in which Nicole Kidman and Tom Cruise play roughly equally large parts.  The film is almost entirely about the Tom Cruise character.  I was expecting an intelligent exploration of jealousy and relationships and the like.  Instead we get half way to a thriller, but not all the way, not enough to make it interesting, and there is no intelligent comment on human nature, nor, so far as I can tell, on anything.This film takes itself so amazingly seriously, and yet is transparently ludicrous from start to finish.  Human beings don't behave like that. Nothing made sense.  Characters kept acting on information which they didn't have.  The various parts of the world were not using the same clock.  The sun kept rising and falling at odd times, and characters would go back to somewhere they'd been the day before, to find that no one there had moved, changed clothes, or even finished what they were saying.Yes, there is a bit of nudity in it, but this is presented in scenes of such unnecessary length, and such little incident, that you just wish they'd get on with the next scene.Having more recently spoken to several other people who saw it, I have encountered near-uniform condemnation of this shamefully bad film.  One person fell asleep during it several times.  One had to apologise to the five people who went with her to see it, who all hated it (it had been her idea to go to see it).  Only two people reportedly enjoyed it, but they enjoyed it solely because they thought that it was so bad that it was funny. I say that it is too dull and slow to be found entertaining that way.I would thoroughly recommend this film to people I intensely dislike.",1,103,206,30 September 1999
