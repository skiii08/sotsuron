Kill Bill: Vol. 2," Masterful film, the perfect conclusion to a perfect story.
","Kill Bill: Vol 1 is my favorite film of 2003.  I was blown away by the film, it was a brilliant film made by the excellent Quentin Tarantino.  So obviously, I had high expectations for Volume 2.  Well, I was not disappointed at all.  And hey, if I don't see 10 better films this year, this will be the top of my 2004 list.Kill Bill: Vol 2 concludes the tale of The Bride, and it does it with wonderful style.  Though it seems a little different than the first film, without all the blood soaked action and multiple killings, it answers all the questions the first film raises.  Now that the viewer can see both films as a whole, it is a perfect revenge story.There are so many excellent scenes in this film.  I never expected to cry at a Quentin Tarantino film, but this one did it, and it's at the most unexpected moment that I cried (during the chapter of Paula Schultz). 
Quentin is a masterful director, and in this film he further proves it.  He even manages to make montages acceptable and beautiful.  The editing is once again extraordinary, so many great cuts.Tarantino has made a beautiful film, and it is perhaps my favorite of his career.",10,1,2,17 April 2004
Knocked Up," A simple story is made into a very entertaining comedy
","Ben Stone (Seth Rogen) meets Alison Scott (Katherine Heigl) at a bar, they get drunk and have a little fun afterward, then they part ways. That is, until a few weeks later, Alison discovers she's pregnant and Ben is the father. This simple story makes up the hilarious film Knocked Up. I really enjoyed this, it has a lot of great laughs and it also has a lot of heart spread throughout.Seth Rogen does an excellent job, I'm glad he's been given the chance to be the lead in such a big film. And Katherine Heigl is equally entertaining. The two of them are so great together, they're just so much fun to watch on screen. The supporting actors are also wonderful. Leslie Mann and Paul Rudd are perfect together. And I think Kristen Wiig steals the show with her small yet hysterical role as one of the workers at E!.When people go to see this they'll want to compare it with 40 Year Old Virgin. Though I'm not a big fan of comparing movies to other movies, I guess I'll have to go through with it. For me, 40 Year Old Virgin is a funnier movie, but Knocked Up is a better written film and it has more heart to it. Both films based their story on a simple premise (a nerdy 40 year old hasn't had sex, a guy has a one night stand and gets the woman pregnant), but it seems like 40 Year Old Virgin used its idea to just get laughs. Knocked Up, on the other hand, uses its set up and continues the story throughout the film, developing its characters.So, Knocked Up is a very enjoyable film, it has some big laughs (I particularly love the side story with the bearded roommate) but its also very sweet at times. I'm sure people will love it. See the movie and you'll get more than just laughs.",9,239,391,15 April 2007
The Descent," Awesome horror / thriller with a lot of suspense
","This movie was awesome. I saw this at the Waterfront Film Festival in Saugatuck, Michigan, and it was one of the best of the festival. The entire film puts you on the edge of your seat (or curled up in a ball, depending on who you are). A group of young women go on a yearly adventure. This year they decide to go caving in North Carolina. The problem is, they chose a cave that hasn't been explored before. So of course, they aren't alone in this cave.The movie is very freaky, so many creepy moments, I was hooked the whole way through. Everyone in the theater was jumping and screaming, there was even a girl a few rows back that was crying the whole time.Filled with blood, filled with scares, this is THE movie for horror fans. Watch out for this one, it's sure to be a hit.",10,2,6,15 June 2006
