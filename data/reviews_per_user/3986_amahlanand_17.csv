Sherlock Holmes: A Game of Shadows," 'He played the game for the game's own sake'
","'He played the game for the game's own sake' would be a perfect description of Robert Downey Jr's take on Sherlock Holmes. He's matter of factly slick, inadvertently cool and cheekily eccentric not to mention a king of one liners. He returns to deliver superbly in this sequel to Guy Ritchie's 'Sherlock Holmes' in an enthralling cat and mouse game between prodigies involving a clash between him and Sherlock Holmes' classical, scheming nemesis, Professor James Moriarty played by Jared Harris. Ritchie has directed a complementary film where everything and everyone seems to complement everything and everyone else whether the acting, dialogue, score or the sets. The plot is well crafted if not masterful but undoubtedly vastly entertaining. The usage of flashback storytelling, as seen in the prequel to this film, gives many enigmas in the movie a sense of finality; you can't help but be in awe of the manner of storytelling presented to you not to mention the filming style through which the narrative is presented. Don't be put off by the slow, almost uneventful start, it is certainly made worth your while very quickly. Occasionally, it can be hard to keep up, such is the pace with which events transpire, it does lose you at junctures but fear not, only temporarily. This light hearted iteration of a mystery thriller is absorbing and compelling, much like its predecessor and we have to attribute it to the director and the acting talent in the film that the light hearted tone hasn't become slapstick as much as a new spin on the mystery and intrigue associated with Arthur Conan Doyle's classic Sherlock Holmes. Robert Downey Jr. may yet again have been the star of the show but it's the chemistry between his Sherlock and Jude Law's Watson that really shines. Their dialogue interchanged is so fluid and natural not to mention damned entertaining. Everyone's holding out for the climax though and it probably wasn't as fantastically revealing and ingenious as the first movie, but was well built up nonetheless. It's perhaps not how you envisaged it and in all likeliness, not how you wanted it to be either, or maybe it was",9,0,1,9 May 2012
The Hunger Games," This is definitely out there
","A 'Hunger Games' virgin would be bewildered at the concept of the story. Importantly however, the film is given context and grounding for those who have not read the novels making it comprehensible as a story, even if you don't warm to it as a premise. Reading a novel, specifically one full of minute details which can make a large difference to perceptions, will almost always supersede the film if every detail is not treated appropriately and as a 'virgin', you get the impression that there remain some grey areas and potential plot holes, but nothing leaves you utterly perplexed. Ultimately though, you come to realise that the 'Hunger Games' is not as much about cruel commerciality than about hope and inspiration in a dystopian, empire type world. The plot becomes more sophisticated and grows on you with time. The realm itself is depicted magnificently in a futuristic, fantastical and fashionable way, the latter part being most peculiar yet still visually appealing. The usage of CGI was brilliant in highlighting the stark contrast between the dictatorial, advanced 'Capitol' and the backward, subordinated 'Districts'. Such young adult novel film adaptations are often fraught with castings of young 'hunks' or 'princesses' who are on the screen more for looks than acting but this film sets itself apart through some particularly good characterisation from Jennifer Lawrence ('Katniss Everdeen') as well as old timers such as Elizabeth Banks ('Effie Trinkett') and Woody Harrelson ('Haymitch Abernathy'), both of whom portrayed oddball, quirky sort characters which needed some thinking out of the box.Certainly, fanatics of the novels would be more than pleasantly receptive towards the cinematic adaptation but expect non-fanatics to be walking out of the film thinking 'what was that all about?' It's definitely unique and beats 'Twilight' on screen hands down, but the content still remains a touch overwhelming and outlandish for 'virgins'.",7,1,4,9 May 2012
"I Love You, Man"," 'Bromantic' Hilarity
","A feel- good, buoyant 'bromance', 'I Love You, Man' typifies the elements that can make a regular, orthodox comedy successful. First and foremost, it does make you laugh owing to great characters and it does add a slightly new spin on things. Sometimes, it does feel like the box office is flooded with comedies not too different to this, but it's the minority that realise characters are the key to giving the audience gratification. 'I Love You, Man' certainly belongs to that minority. All the same, it follows a simple path which is far from frenetic and completely impromptu a la 'The Hangover' for instance. It's centered around a relatively boring guy and his very contrasting friend and these opposites attract with results that are amusing, good fun and fresh. These two men drive each other toward some juvenile behaviour, Jason Segel being the perpetrator, an adolescent in a grown man's body in many ways. But the humour itself isn't overly immature, neither is it excessively crude or imbecilic but 'bromantically' innocent. There was more focus on this facet than on the romantic aspect of the film, which took a back seat making this far more male friendly. The free-spirited Sydney Fife as played by Jason Segel, certainly fascinates you. His name makes him sound awful important, but he never seems to work and is perpetually biding his time in his 'man cave' with quite expensive ornaments adorning the walls. At first glance, he occurs to be a jobless grunge but he's fun, pleasure seeking and supposedly, a smart investor, after all, it isn't possible to facilitate such living without some brains. Segel's characters may read like total numbskulls, but he acts them out in a friendly and affable manner. The protagonist, Peter Klaven, is another of those socially awkward characters that Paul Rudd plays in a manner in which he looks like quite the loser but is associative in a strange kind of way, associative to the point that he becomes humorous. Another refreshing change was seeing an impactful and useful supporting cast who left no stone unturned and infused their own sense of comedy through their characters making this more than just a show run by Rudd and Segel. Jon Favreau and J.K. Simmons in particular used stronger personalities to juxtapose with Rudd's reluctant character to great effect. The movie shows that congregating with a bunch of dudes doesn't mean pulling out 'man classics' like 'Die Hard' or 'Happy Gilmore' for the 77th time. 'I Love You, Man' could be a worthy addition to that exclusive list.",9,0,0,24 June 2012
The Prestige," Dazzles in its Enigmatic Mystique
","Picture this: you're at a magic show and see an impossible but brilliant magic trick. A mix of awe and bewilderment consumes you as you lust after the answer you will not likely get. But here is an unrelenting quest for that answer, a determination to find out how for a cause which is dark, twisted and mystifying. Such is the way 'The Prestige' engrosses you. A period drama depiction of a unique post-renaissance art, 'The Prestige' shows the lengths to keep, attain and steal secrets, a story about power, pride and mind games with the viewers, the on-camera audience and the characters. We see what was the foundation of modern day magic but the darker, more cutthroat side of it which is both morally and ethically questionable. The film is based around a piece de resistance and the way in which the illusionary employed translates to treachery. The vicious circle of deceit and obsession for power and respect is mind- boggingly riveting. Christopher Nolan leads you on a path where everybody looks antagonistic and spiteful, he gradually changes your perceptions of people in ways which can be sudden and in others where you watch the morphing process as it unfolds, much like a stage tragedy sans the melodrama. The title works in such a contrasting manner to the film, the two protagonists aim for prestige but in doing so, seek to destroy one another's. The great shroud of mystique involved in this process is complicated and takes time to grip your mind from believing 'The Prestige' to be just another period drama. It was not a film that captures your imagination from square one even if it may with time. It ambles along in a manner befitting a magician revelling in his trickery but the pace can be frustrating, if only for the sin of curiosity. Christian Bale presents Alfred Borden as this arrogant, cocky lad but beneath that presumptuousness and pride lies a crafty and wily conniver but comfortably the more intelligent of the two illusionists. Bale shows this so subtly yet with panache through the character's actions which are brief but have wide ramifications. He also brings a sense of irony to the character, one in which he apparently disguises truth from himself making for a strangely compelling personality. This wild ambition meets Robert Angier's emotion, which drives him to sink to Borden's depths despite being a more astute character. Hugh Jackman's performance is an emotional roller-coaster, the character that Nolan uses to toy with our minds in this wonderfully curious manner, whose descent is portrayed with fervour. The female lead, Scarlett Johansson, is superbly enigmatic. She is the advertisement of the film representing the mystery and unpredictability embodying the story. The quintessential illusion is described at the beginning and the film plays out like these three acts building to 'the prestige', the big divulgence. Simple but sensational was how it struck me, but each to their own experiences, it depends what questions you desire to be answered. Nonetheless, whether it robs you of your dream reveal or gives it to you, you cannot deny the ingenuity surrounding the mystery ride you've been put on.",8,1,2,25 June 2012
The Adventures of Tintin," A Complicated Take on Simplicity
","It was a pity that the unbelievably realistic animation couldn't salvage a plot so rapid that it was barely digestible. That can be difficult to tolerate at the best of times let alone during a big screen version of an old school comic renowned for its simplicity. With the likes of Spielberg and Jackson at the helm, I expected something a bit more compelling. The whole production felt pretentious, shoving so much in terms of its convoluted story and advanced animation style down the throat in order to seemingly detract from the fact that the plot line was ultimately quite ordinary with a plethora of plot holes. I do feel sorry for younger viewers who wouldn't have a clue what the heck is going on for the majority of the film. Admittedly, I didn't. All the same, the plus point was unquestionably the animation which was a descendant of other decadal animated film landmarks such as Toy Story and Shrek. You would have been forgiven for thinking that this was a live action movie at times such was how realistic the animation was. Certainly kudos to technology, but we do need to draw a line between animation and live action. After all, the pull of a cartoon comes from the animation itself. You always try to derive good, tame fun out of these animated flicks, even if the story didn't quite stack up and the voice acting certainly did that for me. Although there were times I could scarcely understand what Andy Serkis as Captain Haddock was blabbering on about in that strong Scottish burr, that was really the charm of his performance. I would also campaign for a spin-off Thompson and Thompson film with Simon Pegg and Nick Frost doing the honours. They vastly entertained as a comic duo (not for the first time) and did so in a kid's setting on this occasion rather than the more mature set up we are used to seeing them. I bet that sort of movie, which would barely need half a decent story, would fare much better than this with all audiences. I definitely wonder, is this the Tintin that Hergé envisaged, even if a 21st century iteration? In all honestly, it does not seem to be. There were so many aspects to be admired, but admired for what reason?",4,1,2,9 May 2012
21 Jump Street," Buddy-Teen Comedy Brilliance
","I think we've seen the pioneering of a new sub-genre: a merger between a buddy cop and teen comedy film. Who isn't constantly on the hunt for something different? The filmmakers made it clear that they were keen to establish a gulf between the television series and the feature film; indeed, the film takes no more but the fundamental concept and premise from the series and laces it with almost slapstick, though mature hilarity which makes for one of the comedy spectacles of 2012. The story is definitely stupid but it's made to be that way. That was the storywriters' intentions, one of which was Jonah Hill himself. It's supposed to be exaggerated and have a silly, immature teen, high school wrongdoing element to it. It was like an 'American Pie' meets crime drama. For those raising their eyebrows, I did mention it was unique. Strange the way I describe it but take my word for it, it works superbly. The sense of humour is very juvenile and far from sophisticated. Any comedy associated with Jonah Hill means that you would be fooling yourself if you expected more refined laughs. I wouldn't say that this would have broad appeal, not least of all for loyal fanatics of the television show who may get the inch that all Tatum and Hill do is slander the '21 Jump Street' name. Hopefully, Johnny Depp and Peter DeLuise's involvement will prevent that. All the same, it's raunchy, occasionally crude but brilliantly thought out with acting that works. On the note of acting, we do see some typecasting to some extent: Tatum in his stereotypical dimwitted, jock role and Hill in his overdone 'nerd punching above his weight' type role. They form an unlikely, almost unnatural duo representing the yin to each other's yang. Yet, they really surprise you with their fantastic, humorous chemistry; I wouldn't hesitate in saying that I would eagerly anticipate a follow-up with this pair in the hot seat. It's a credit to Channing Tatum that he really took the initiative and showed greater acting prowess in this clichéd role than we have seen from him. Jonah Hill is his usual self although sporting a new, streamlined look. That doesn't change the fact that he is becoming a comedian I would assume is beginning to attract a loyal fanbase. A special mention also needs to be shouted out to Ice Cube who returns to his element with an array of 'Ice Cube moments' which could only be criticised for brevity. This film is really a hoot, you'll derive some great hilarity from it. Don't however make the mistake of thinking you are seeing the next 'Lethal Weapon' or 'Rush Hour' as much as a derivative of 'The Other Guys' or 'Starsky and Hutch'. And don't watch it for any sort of intricate crime solving or spectacular action. Do however watch it for some juvenile pleasure.",9,1,3,2 June 2012
American Psycho," 'Do you feel fulfilled... in your life?'
","This was the sort of film that I doubt will garner universal approval, I wasn't sure myself of whether it registered with me or not. It was a unique take on mental psyche which can delve deep but seem on the surface like a straightforward slasher film. Though, I admired its blend of thriller and satire where it doesn't take itself too seriously yet doesn't descend to a comically inept level by maintaining a certain level of tension. 'American Psycho' gives no importance to anything else but for one man who would be satisfied with the attention: Patrick Bateman, a narcissistic, patronising yuppie who is presented in a most enigmatic fashion, a man who has a high flying life yet idealises something more out of the ordinary. His character paints a picture of blatant and oftentimes comical irony. He shows how self obsession can drive you off an edge, how your mind can be the instigator of absolute insanity and emotions ranging from depression to prime aggression without the need for external influence which Christian Bale portrays starkly well. Simultaneously, he acts as quite the paradox as he acknowledges his plunge into insanity and does little to help himself. The greatest irony though is how, after all his attempts, the story comes full circle where his life is just normal, regardless of what he does. For him, his nocturnal, sociopathic tendencies are all just a game, a simple transgressive indulgence he feels he is entitled to. His motives however are a prime example of the black comedy in the film, they can probably be likened to a young kid throwing a tantrum because other kids have more than him and possessions better than his own. Except Bateman's obsessions with superiority are never too little to kill for.I've never seen a more confused and directionless character, one conflicted by so many emotions and so intricately complex. I can't imagine an author expecting more out of such an absorbingly curious character than Christian Bale brought out in this pinching satire on personal fulfilment and domination. 'There is an idea of a Patrick Bateman' his self monologue claims and it's left up to you to examine what you see and decide what it is all about, real or imaginative. Don't expect him to give you a determinate answer though. If provoking thought isn't a show of acting mastery on Bale's part and deserved of honours, I'm not sure what is. Yet, even provoking thought needs to have some sense. Yes indeed, this is deep and elaborate. But good cinema.",8,0,0,13 May 2012
American Beauty," The Results of Profound Linearity
","'American Beauty' is weird on more levels than one, filled with peculiar people who deeply intrigue you in their strange ways. The filmmakers do the same in their premise for a film so difficult to categorise in its distinctness. The film is an odd, upbeat satire on conventional suburban life, an allegory for breaking away from the 'trap' of normality. However, the intense analytic view the film begs and the ironic tone that encompasses it should not conceal a lack of something genuinely compelling for the average viewer, there's nothing and nobody to admire or sympathise with and little to remember but convoluted messages. There's an abundance of wit in certain elements, but no action, drama which takes a linear route and subtle humour which owes more to situations and circumstances rather than characters.The film portrays this thematic focus of 'moving away from the status quo' through its protagonist, the trivial and lonely Lester Burnham who begins the film with the monologue, 'This is my neighbourhood, this is my street, this is my life' which couldn't be more reflective of the word 'average'. An average family life, average 9-5 lifestyle, a spiteful teenager and a garden loving spouse. Suddenly though, the normality takes a different direction with Lester's uncomfortable infatuation with and fantasies of his daughter's friend, Angela. But, is this really the glorified 'escape' from the routineness of his life? He embraces any chance to break away, juvenile pursuits, these unfeasible obsessions, anything as long as he can envisage himself in a more invigorating realm doing something 'exciting'. He then ensues to have a most untypical mid-life crisis which can be humorous in his deluded, misplaced hopes and desires. He ends up being the catalyst for everyone to break away from the norm and pursue some 'excitement' but it is all just a frivolous exercise. The aim of the film is to show people acting upon the desire to morph themselves from ordinary to extraordinary but they become abnormal and senseless. The characters are detached from each other and after their initial novelties, become tiresome. The acting was impressive, Kevin Spacey in particular brought his 'rebel' to life extremely diligently, but Lester's life doesn't show him moving away from his unremarkable life in a calculated, sane manner and it just wasn't convincing. The enduring image from the film is one of a plastic bag floating around, deemed by one of the characters as 'the most beautiful thing I've ever seen'. It means nothing but demonstrates the pretensions of the film to try and mean something truly profound. But people see things uniquely and that is why I neither recommend it nor dissuade you from seeing this. The supposed moral is that normality is a façade. Possibly true, but it won't drive you towards insanity and inanity as it does here.",5,2,5,17 June 2012
The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo," Stark, Disturbing Brilliance
","What strikes one about this film, particularly if you have not been introduced to the franchise through the novels, is the extreme lengths it goes to in order to convey the full effect of its impact through both the story and its characters. Sex scenes for instance are far from uncommon, more intense scenes of the same nature are by no means rare either, but not often do they genuinely disturb and unsettle you. If a work of cinema can have that kind of influence upon your emotions, through avenues which are not uncommon in film, it has undoubtedly been brilliantly crafted and deserved of unanimous praise. The plot is full of intrigue, a great mystery story with many angles, no distracting sideplots and without a conventional 'whodunit'. Initially, the idea of two almost distinct story lines and characters is puzzling, one being full of disturbing and sensitive extremities, the other being mysteriously sedate. However, it allows the viewer to set up an idea of Rooney Mara's character Lisabeth Salander, the linchpin and master focus. There are junctures you find yourself more fascinated with her than the murder mystery being deciphered. She is strange but resourceful, peculiar at face value yet you are inclined to wonder about who she really is, what she really is. It is as if circumstance has consumed her in some way but she finds a way to counter circumstance through passion and intellect. Mara's is such a vast, demanding role but her performance casts the net even wider in terms of the character's vastness. She harnesses so many aspects of an individual which makes her performance truly revolutionary and compelling. Despite being a stellar actor who absorbs himself into a character that throws himself into everything, Daniel Craig was outshone majorly by Mara. Was the film far-fetched, inordinately lengthy and perhaps too graphic? Perhaps something to ponder. The film doesn't need you to assume anything. It is stark and will show you implications rather than simply implying them. Those who will enjoy this are those who can withstand such blatancy and appreciate its artistic worth compared to others who may find the foundations of the story too unsettling to even think about appreciating.",9,2,7,9 May 2012
Rocky IV," This film goes the distance
","This represents the culmination of Rocky's efforts, his final frontier and ultimate challenge which stays true to everything the character stands for, grit, determination, perseverance and heart. This could have made for an epic ending to a franchise which has won the hearts and admiration of many. It is impressed upon you that this was the film Sylvester Stallone has been building towards, where Rocky Balboa seemingly 'achieves the impossible'. His opponent, Dolph Lundgren's Ivan Drago is his most fearsome yet, made of steel like Mr T's Clubber Lang but a towering beast of a man, whose actions do much of the talking. Lundgren came across as authentic and true to the persona, Rocky's most formidable opponent and definitely his most notable after Apollo Creed. He made you believe that his brute force could kill.Tragedy and hardship is very much a recurring theme through the series and it returns to possess Rocky who Stallone portrays with a consistent progression but retaining the traits that made him the warm human being from the original 'Rocky'. This time through, tragedy and hardship drives Rocky even further. His 'training scenes' are a hallmark of Rocky movies but rather than watching him run up steps followed by hundreds of admirers, or working up a sweat in the gym, we see him alone, trudging through snow, climbing steep mountains and chopping wood in vicious conditions whilst his opponent trains with superior technology, comfort and assistance. What makes it so unforgettable is how true it is to Rocky's spirit and drive to 'go the distance', even more than running up 1000 steps or doing 1000 push ups, as well as depictive of the inspirational take away from the films. Much has been made of the political propaganda within the movie but it fails to sway Rocky. Ultimately, it doesn't take over the film as much as provide a fitting backdrop and concludes in a manner true to Rocky.Stallone is, as always, supported by the stellar talents of Talia Shire, Burt Young and Carl Weathers whilst even the Russian contingent led by Brigitte Nielson and Michael Pataki are extremely believable. The question on everyone's lips is, does it beat the original? I would say that they are two different films at two different junctures, the first created a revered character whilst this one fulfilled him.",10,0,1,9 May 2012
The Amazing Spider-Man," Spider Man for Teens
","While Tobey Maguire was your 'friendly, neighbourhood Spider-Man', Andrew Garfield is more like your 'hip, juvenile, generation Y' Spider-Man. The kind of superhero unafraid of calling on his mobile phone in a busy New York street corner and the kind of superhero who lies on a self-made web playing video games whilst waiting for his foes to appear. Despite this slightly novel approach, 'The Amazing Spider Man' is just a rehash of Sam Raimi's original 'Spider Man', much of the plot is either similar, identical or along the same lines with a tweak here and there making more than half the film somewhat of an unnecessary recap of sorts. It was certainly pleasing to have a script addressing the reasoning behind a burning question, why does Peter Parker live with his aunt and uncle? But even this combined with Peter Parker/Spider Man's other traumas in the film don't give us a good enough definition of Spider-Man as a symbol, the motivation behind Peter Parker's graduation from angry vengeance to selfless nobility. One noteworthy change was the magnificent camera work which puts you up close and personal with Spider-Man through the first-person shots and dynamic angles employed. At times, it felt like a virtual rollarcoaster ride but it was definitely the closest most people will get to knowing what it's like to be the famous web-slinger. Garfield knew his deal portraying Peter Parker as more of a typical 21st century confused, directionless adolescent but one who seems to be more noticed than what you would expect. He may not have been the less appealing, geeky Peter Parker as earlier personified by Tobey Maguire but where Maguire trumps Garfield was in turning a genuine nobody into somebody whilst maintaining that anonymity. Garfield's Parker was already garnering the affections of a pretty girl and was operating far from what you would call incognito, a guy quite willing to divulge his secret to a perfect stranger. The contrast between the person and his alter ego defines a superhero and Garfield couldn't really highlight that contrast as effectively. You could connect with him, but unlike his 'The Social Network' performance, he lacked even a slight bit of maturity. The script further failed to deal with social implications transforming him into a public icon. Ultimately, a superhero is naught without public opinion and interest. Emma Stone fortunately wasn't the constant damsel in distress like Kirsten Dunst's Mary Jane but Gwen Stacy's relationship with Peter Parker furthered the sentiment that the film seemed to become too teen conducive. Not that the teen appeal is a completely bad thing, but the lack of maturity in the characters can occasionally be weak in conviction. I must express my disappointment in the villainous Lizard however as a character which could not invoke as much terror on screen as its terrific design could to viewers. Rhys Ifans was curiously very similar in his character progression as Willem Dafoe's Green Goblin in Raimi's 'Spider Man'. Although Curt Connors was well played, he made you feel as if you'd seen it all before. Although I still enjoyed it, I think the enjoyment stemmed more from my unwavering appreciation of the comic book character. Nonetheless, with this relatively immature yet respectably enjoyable origin story done and dusted, I anticipate a more complete sequel which can surpass this. More originality may well be a dominant reason.",6,5,10,6 July 2012
Goon," Not for the easily offended
","I can't claim to be an ice hockey fanatic as much as plead ignorance toward anything ice hockey related but I discovered that very little knowledge of the sport is needed to understand and enjoy something as fundamentally albeit stupidly entertaining as this. The film picked up the worst, most notorious aspect of ice hockey, the fights and the role of the aptly named 'enforcer' (basically, the guy responsible for knocking the opposition out) and centers an entire story around it. And that's the method through which the best comedy is born. By finding something within a broader subject to wittily exaggerate and create some idiotic humour out of. Surprisingly, all this lunacy is based on a true story. Who would have picked that? All the same, regardless of its origins, I found the script original, enlightening for a hockey 'noob' like myself but smartly written and employed to create an R-rated comedy. The plot does eventually evolve from arbitrary madness involving bloody but relatively less cringeworthy violence to something a little more civil and mellow but remained amiable all the same, certainly a story worth following. I really believed and liked the diverse cast and characters. These kinds of movies can really fail miserably if this isn't the case. Jay Baruchel, also one of the co-writers, is the 'Stifler' here, or, to put it into context for non American Pie fans, the foul mouthed, lewd, attention seeker who in all his excessiveness, can be quite funny. The usual 'Stifler' and protagonist, Seann William Scott is pretty boneheaded by contrast, a thug albeit one with surprising sensitivity. Though, as he does with most of his wide-spanning roles, he still makes himself reasonably humorous. Undoubtedly though, this is the most likable character I have seen him play. We've seen the two aforementioned actors in numerous R-rated comedies but Liev Schrieber hasn't been a regular feature in the genre. Yet, he made his niche superbly and it didn't necessarily involve carrying on like a jerk. He just simply fit the profile set out for his character and played the role with conviction. Isn't that the key to good acting in any genre? Most of this is fairly dim witted and quite indecent. Crudely entertaining though for sure. Although, refrain from bringing ice hockey aspiring youngsters.",8,0,0,16 May 2012
Batman Begins," Batman: Year One
","Albeit not containing some of Batman's more notorious foes, 'Batman Begins' really is the most complete Batman interpretation to date. A marked improvement over Joel Schumacher's toyetic, bland take or the campy 1966 'Batman' and an elaboration of the Gothic, dark undertones of Burton's films, Christopher Nolan has created a more contemporary Batman which leaves a far more believable impression.If not a comic buff, have you ever asked yourself, just as Alfred asks Bruce in the film, 'Why Bats?' We've finally been given that ever so desired backstory. Burton's 'Batman' in 1989 introduced a charged superhero without giving us the reason for his drive. Here, we see the events as they transpire, how Bruce Wayne abridges into the Batman persona and it helps us to better understand the motivations behind Nolan's rebooted Caped Crusader. Jonathan Nolan deserves much praise for an extremely well penned story which incorporates elements of a corrupt, degrading society and those few trying to rebel against it. The sets are extremely reflective of this notion. The depiction of Arkham Asylum and the shanty town with the more affluent city revolving around it, separated by a small body of water illustrates the fact that the heart of Gotham's problems lies in the heart of the city, a part of the two-tier society but also not a part of it. Tackling issues such as those makes this superhero flick so relevant to today's world that even those who aren't regular superhero fans can enjoy it. Both villains were embodied with mindsets so true to their comic book namesakes but Ra's Al Ghul doesn't have his traditional superpowers whilst the Scarecrow doesn't utilise anything but simple chemistry. Constructing that DC Comic fantasy world wasn't Nolan's intentions. Unlike Joel Schumacher for instance, his aim was to create a universe wherein Batman and his villains are all human beings set in a real, plausible world. I really believe this portrayal strikes an excellent balance between Bruce Wayne and Batman and connects the two well. We see both a formidable, complete, physical Batman and a convincing façade as Bruce Wayne. The fact that Christian Bale wasn't a huge, well renowned actor gave him more room to make his mark. He brings out the most admirable and most believable iteration of Batman to be seen in the last couple of decades. The film also saw the re-introduction and re-characterisation of people such as Lieutenant Gordon, Lucius Fox and Alfred who either had a subordinated role in the earlier films or were not present at all. Nolan makes it seem a travesty that they weren't explored properly previously after how well their roles are thought out and how superbly they are personified by these actors. Katie Holmes' performance however was a bit tiresome and absent of strength in her personality. Rachel Dawes' connection with Bruce Wayne was less than good. But in the end, that's just a Hollywood cliché and necessity. Batman has never really needed a love interest like Superman or Spider Man. Some of the best Batman stories have dealt with darker, more impactful material and 'Batman Begins' strives for that angle where it succeeds magnificently. I would like to let you in on a post review secret disclaimer in case it hasn't been that obvious: I am a massive Batman fanatic. This spellbinding take on the Dark Knight earns more than just my stamp of approval.",10,1,2,11 June 2012
Mission: Impossible - Ghost Protocol," Impossibly Unlikeable
","What was there not to like? There was the action, the gadgets, the cars, the stunts not to mention sarcastic amusement from Simon Pegg. Sure, we've seen it all before, whether it be in the Mission Impossible series itself, James Bond or the Bourne series, but this particular take had a real slickness and refined edge towards it. Cruise's consistency as Ethan Hunt doesn't detract from the character's relative lack of development though, although, there was more screen time and attention given to the rest of the crew this time, a welcome change from the film's predecessors. Plausability: Definitely Deniable. Entertainment Value: Impossibly unlikeable",9,1,2,9 May 2012
Puss in Boots," Innocent Fun with Zorro-Puss
","Who can deny it, the Latin-inspired Puss in Boots definitely adds more interest than the traditional version. He's just far cooler in the way he personifies an animated photocopy of Antonio Banderas' Zorro. The slyness, the brash overconfidence and of course, the ability to create havoc; the ingredients are there. He has the savoir-faire of Charles Perrault's character as well as the morals. Though, overall, he distinguishes himself from any other take on the classic character and ends up as being just good, fairly rollicking fun. As for the production itself, it was just a good little adventure and what was particularly nice was the lack of complication which many animated features, including the later Shrek films which brought this specific 'Puss' into the limelight, had to their detriment. By no means do I imply however that it was an overly simplified, mundane script either, that wouldn't go together with Puss' vibrancy. Although, it probably deteriorated a touch in even animated film persuasion as it went along, culminating in a slightly underwhelming way. It promised better and in that regard, lets itself down.Once again, similar to 'Shrek', I thoroughly enjoyed the humorous, light-hearted parody of fairytale characters. That characterisation makes the whole thing even more fun. Banderas is unquestionably the right man to voice a 'Latino Puss' despite overdoing it a bit at times and being slightly overbearing. I'm not complaining though, that sort of exaggeration was the essence of his character. The characters of 'Humpty Alexander Dumpty' and 'Jack and Jill' were well thought out and depicted by their respective voice actors and actresses. My only qualms lay with Kitty Softpaws who didn't initiate sizzling enough chemistry with Puss, they seemed slightly detached from one another although engaged in themselves. Her character didn't leave as much of a mark as the others.'Puss in Boots' is undoubtedly childishly funny but even adults won't be able to resist a few smiles throughout. Ultimately, it may not deserve the superior label of 'swashbuckling' but it was plain, straightforward fun that you cannot go too wrong with.",7,0,2,22 May 2012
The Woman in Black," Calling those who like Haunted Houses
","Having not read the book, I had no idea that I was walking into a supernatural horror movie that evoked shades of Tim Burton but went further in its implications. There was an evil vibe about this story, something cruel and cursed that you get almost immediately after Arthur Kipps (Daniel Radcliffe) arrives into the village. Being eerie and dark, the hazy and bleak cinematography is what causes this vibe, making for a chilling movie, one that keeps you peering around the corner for the next major fright. The sets were perfect in giving their impression of 'Ye Olde England', but they are kept barren for a purpose which has your attention diverted toward the characters (and ghosts). There are junctures you get the feeling that the film is veering towards a gore driven slasher flick but it restrains itself suitably to deliver supernatural themed horror which is definitely frightening. Moving from fantasy to something far more adult themed, Radcliffe made the transition seamlessly and appeared to be more absorbed in his character than he ever did in 'Harry Potter'. Severe twists and turns are not to be seen in a film quite faithful to its source material but don't think you will be yawning in boredom. The intensity of the events give you no space to do so.",7,0,0,9 May 2012
The Dark Knight Rises," Nolan's Immortalisation of Batman
","If there was an award for the most anticipated film of all time, 'The Dark Knight Rises' would be a clear victor. And what would validate that accolade is the fact that it is another Nolan brainchild which lives up to the hype even if it has to walk in the illustrious footsteps of its now legendary predecessor. The only 'fault', If you can call it that, of 'Rises' was the absence of a performance of the magnitude of Heath Ledger's 'Joker'. That helped 'The Dark Knight' transcend itself. But topping that would be wishful. It begins gradually, curiously taking its time (barring another exhilarating opening though) before substantiating more and more leading towards what is a spectacular finale, a finale which does what no other Batman film has ever done, immortalises the Dark Knight. Once more, Jonathan Nolan shows an intricate prowess towards his story writing, one which expands the spectrum beyond Batman to a multitude of thematic focuses and people. He utilises Batman oddly sparingly but to the point where every minute of his screen time was compelling. The key difference between 'The Dark Knight' and 'Rises' was the focus, the former being more character oriented, the latter more plot driven. Nolan finds ways to surprise, thrill and keep you on the edge of your seat with the elements of his narrative. Moreover, he writes keeping in mind that this is to be the end of a saga. Make no mistake, this is a mammoth production. Nolan's conceptualisation of the Batman world is an evolution beyond any superhero realm to graduate to the big screen. His methods and vision for the presentation of this film eclipse contemporary action cinema and the production design, stunts and camera work truly leave you incredulous. Most importantly, he makes Batman's neo-apocalyptic world so realistic. Tom Hardy described his character aptly with the word 'brutal'. Bane is an intimidating opponent who serves to challenge Batman physically rather than torturing him with his derangement like the Joker. Albeit more analogous to his comic book self, Bane's calculated, scheming approach to creating anarchy did not have the exciting unpredictability and mania of the Joker which constantly leaves you guessing. Whilst the Joker held a city to ransom with manipulation, threat and deceit, Bane declares his own martial law in the most aggressive and direct of manners. Ultimately however, both are distinct characters and our preference of characters should not distract from how well they are enacted. All the same, Hardy creates a magnificent physical presence; menacing, bone-chilling and seemingly unstoppable and all that minus facial expression owing to his mask. This speaks volumes about his ability. Anne Hathaway's lean, athletic figure created for great aesthetic pleasure and she captured the essence of the femme fatale almost as well as her predecessor. Sly and enigmatic, Selina Kyle is not exactly the feline that people would be expecting but nonetheless, she certainly has claws and a domineering attitude to match. The chameleon Christian Bale returns to Bruce Wayne presenting him initially as sickly, almost pitiful making his maverick-like motives behind re-adopting the Batman suit after 8 long years in solitude slightly unclear. Nevertheless, like most things in the Nolan world, it all leads towards the film's principal theme, the difference between Bruce convincing himself of his immunity towards what he believes to be the disease that is thanatophobia and acceptance of the fact that he is but a human being with a final purpose and a life beyond. This quest to avert death is something that according to Batman lore is supposed to haunt both Bruce Wayne and Batman eternally and his final acceptance, in this film, of both his vulnerability and the fact that he has given Gotham 'everything', as per the words of Selina Kyle, is what makes this such a fitting conclusion, not just to Nolan's series but to the Batman legend itself. Christopher Nolan has truly brought the Batman legend full circle and to a worthy conclusion. He stays true to plausibility and pragmatism as in the rest of the series. There is no mention of Lazarus pits, Bane's traditional chemical lifeline, 'Venom', or anything else remotely supernatural. And that, in short, is why he is revered so. 'Rises' is visually incredible and continues to push the limits of Batman, the things that define him, what he is capable of and what he can inspire. It is this reason why Nolan's revival of the Batman epic will be etched in film history as undoubtedly one of the great sagas of all time.",10,5,12,26 July 2012
