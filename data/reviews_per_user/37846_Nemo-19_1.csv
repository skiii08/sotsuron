Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," A Film of Unparalleled Gusto & Complexity
","A breathtaking re-introduction to the saga, sweeping us up in the action and emotion of the present (past?) while planting some sinister seeds of things to come. This film rewards fans who pay attention to detail, with more hidden gags and references than can be absorbed in the first viewing. Episode I presents us with a group of fascinating new characters while providing thoughtful, daring new perspectives of some old ones. I can think of no other film in which such a complex fantasy world is brought to life so vividly and uncompromisingly -- or with such unabashed enthusiasm (and if there is one, I'd love to see it). Together with the other parts of the saga, it creates a story with much more depth and subtlety than most critics give it credit for. While it's true that by itself 'The Phantom Menace' doesn't spend a particularly long time developing its characters, the time it does spend is made to count. Also, it *is* only an introduction, just like Ep.IV-- and just as Ep.V stunningly provided shading for the characters of 'A New Hope', I suspect that Lucas has some amazing developments planned for Episodes II & III. MTFBWY. It's not over yet...",9,0,0,20 May 1999
