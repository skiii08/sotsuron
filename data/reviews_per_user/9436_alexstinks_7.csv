The Avengers," Obsessed
","Amazing! I am completely and utterly obsessed with this film1 It is brilliant! I feel the ratio of humour/action is perfect! I love that it has a good number of jokes because I can't normally stand too much action, action, action I need that humour to break it down a bit. This is it! Of course it also has the eye candy a gal needs - well for me anyhow! - Loki! He's just perfection in every single way. Tom Hiddleston is my favourite British actor. Since I discovered him in Thor I have been hooked and checking out all his other movies. He was fantastic as Loki! I sure hope he's in the sequel!I've watched this film 4 times in my local cinema. For me it never gets boring! Can't wait for it to come out on DVD because I will definitely buy it! I just love everything about this film!",10,5,9,20 August 2012
Spice World," Brilliant fun movie for any Spice Girls fan!
","I love this film so much! I was brought up in the 90s listening to the Spice Girls and I was obsessed with them! I remember a family member bought me this on VHS and I loved it! It was just fun! Clearly it's not the type of movie that's supposed to be taken seriously. It is just supposed to be more of a spoof movie about the Spice Girls! I love the songs, costumes, crazy scenes! I also really enjoyed the cameo appearances from Meatloaf, Elton John and co. It was exciting for my as a child watching this. I love it even now! Brings back great memories! I can't fault it for what it is! It is just a piece of light hearted fun!",10,1,2,20 August 2012
Wreck-It Ralph," Exactly what to expect from a Disney movie - PERFECTION!
","This movie was perfect. In fact even though I went to the cinema with high expectations it was even better than I could have imagined! I loved the concept of the movie. It has a very intriguing storyline one of which I hadn't come across before so I couldn't wait to see how this turned out. It didn't fail to impress me. I was gripped all the way through.The details put in to the animation was by far the best so far that I have seen in a Pixar movie, Don't get me wrong - all of Pixar's animations are amazing but this one somehow managed to be better than perfect. I am so impressed no words can really describe my euphoric state after watching this. The soundtrack was perfect. It really worked well with the images and story. I love the use of famous game characters too. That was a nice touch.I am in complete disbelief that this went from an 8.0 to less on this website! - that needs to change because this movie is flawless! There is nothing at all wrong with this! My mother normally gets bored with Disney and yet she adored Wreck-it-Ralph! Believe me she is hard to please! This was completely worth waiting to see and I can't wait to own this on DVD. It is PERFECT! So imaginative!",10,2,2,22 February 2013
Hotel Transylvania," Perfect!
",This movie is perfect for me...completely my sense of humour from start to finish. I wasn't bored at all and just couldn't stop laughing! I LOVE the Slipknot mention - big fan of the band and i've been to their shows so I was able to relate to the comment made in regards to them. I thought the movie was very imaginative...the characters/personalities/locations AMAZING and whole storyline was brilliant! The animation itself was fantastic! My mother even loved the film and she normally falls asleep during animation films! She couldn't stop laughing and already wants to see it again!Perfect 10/10!!!,10,2,4,21 October 2012
Taken," Very Impressed
",I was extremely impressed. I watched this for the first time a couple of weeks ago (and stupidly after watching the 2nd of the Taken films) but it didn't ruin my experience. I'm not an action fan but I have to say this movie really surprised me. This is a really clever film. Bryan (the main character) is so clever! He doesn't need all the gadgets and gizmos that Bond and other action guys need to kill the bad guy. He uses his brain and he's killing the bad guys for personal reasons rather than to 'save the country' so this sets it apart from other films of this genre. I was hooked from start to finish and I love that the film didn't feel long. It flew bye. I want it on DVD. Could watch it again and again. It was excellent. Really well written and acted. 10/10 millions better than I ever ever expected it to be!,10,3,4,6 November 2012
Sinister," Excellent!
",Excellent! I don't normally watch horror films as they never scare me and normally the gore looks really fake - too cheesy but I decided to check this out after seeing the trailer. This didn't scare me at all because to be honest only real ghost stories scare me and life in general not something I know isn't real but even so this was fantastic! This was really entertaining with an excellent plot and incredible twist ending! The actors did a good job and the monster in the story did make me jump a few times even though I didn't have nightmares or actually feel scared...make up was done well. I think he looked believable.I was hooked all the way through! I would watch this again! Great!,9,16,24,21 October 2012
Taken 2," Faultless!
","Perfect film! I was hooked from start to finish. I hadn't seen the first Taken film but that didn't ruin the experience. It was easy to understand from the start. Bryan is extremely clever. He doesn't need all the gadgets and gizmos that other action heroes need. Yeah he has guns but not fancy ones made especially for his palm print and all that. More than anything he needs his brain and he uses it well. I want this on DVD because it was exciting, different and cleverly written. I'm officially a big Taken fan! The film was perfect! I can't fault it in any way. It is something I would happily watch again and again. I'm not surprise it's been sold out at my local cinema for a few weeks. It's 10/10!!",10,8,18,6 November 2012
