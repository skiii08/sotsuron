Kill Bill: Vol. 2," Having something to say
","In trying to figure out why Kill Bill Volume 2 lacked the punch of Volume 1, I am left with two possibilities: either, I am a bloodthirsty action-movie addict unsatisfied by the relative lack of limbs, or Tarantino's dialogue did not live up to my expectations. Fortunately, on Saturday night, I recalled the prophetic words of Ms. Mia Wallace who basically asked Vincent Vega one night at Jackrabbit Slims, 'Why do people feel the need to fill uncomfortable silence with B.S.?'  She then became quite lively when it turned out that Vincent actually had something on his mind, and it turned into a fun conversation.  From what I've seen in this movie, Mia Wallace would have walked out on a date with Bill. Here, the majority of the conversations are rather unnecessary.  From Budd and Elle discussing 'Which one are you filled with' to Bill's long-winded discussions of life and death and superhero mythology, there is a sense of aimlessness to the monologues.  Compare 'Ezekiel 25:17,' or Tim Roth's set-up to introduce himself to the gang in 'Reservoir Dogs.'  Bill is blowing hot air compared to any one of them.  (O-Ren Ishii came close to getting somewhere with her warning to the Yakuza.)     I seem to be in the minority opinion here, though about the quality of conversation.  Frankly, I preferred the silent treatment that O-Ren Ishii gave The Bride to Bill's death-by-monologue style.  Dialogue should be led by intention: Bill's questioning towards the end of the film seems to have absolutely no bearing on his ultimate wish to see The Bride dead.  So, it seems to be filler material.  By the way, (SPOILER) if there's anything to address in dialogue, why not address that The Bride's about to kill her daughter's father?  And why doesn't it bother the kid that Daddy's gone, after he's the only one she's seen for years? I suppose it was the climax of the film that disappointed me most: maybe it's just that the Tokyo showdown was so much more elegant and over-the-top that it feels like it should have ended the film rather than (SPOILER) a sitdown bit of swordplay in a backyard. In terms of cinematography and music, the film is also not quite up to the level that Kill Bill Volume 1 scored (b&w sequences, Zamfir music, anime, shadow swordfights.)  Fortunately, the Pai Mei sequence harkened back to the cinematic style that was all over Volume 1.  Ultimately, Kill Bill Volume 2 is an inferior but still worthwhile product.  The showdown with the Crazy 88 and O-Ren Ishii will be Kill Bill's image in popular memory for years to come.  VOLUME 1: ****.  VOLUME 2:***.",Null,0,1,19 April 2004
Memento," Two scores, two genres, one unforgettable film
","After watching Memento last night, something hung over me that I still can't shake: that synthesized, sad, meditative score.  The music represented the film's wonderful mix of genres for me, from two other California pictures.  In Michael Mann's 'Heat,'(1995) a cop(Al Pacino) chases a crook (Robert DeNiro) in Los Angeles, with a similar meditative score in the air whenever an important decision is to be made (the tunnel scene near the end for DeNiro.)  Here, the cop is told by his lover, 'You hunt down your prey...That's all you do.'  He responds by saying, 'It keeps me sharp...on the edge...I am who I'm after.'  (Lenny, anyone?)     However, even beyond that, we have Todd Haynes' 'Safe'(also 1995 and California), where a suburban housewife (Julianne Moore) suffers a mental/physical breakdown that forces her to flee her surroundings and find the cure.  No one can figure out though whether her condition is medical or psychological.  In that film, an even more solitary, sad, synthesized score hung over her as she tried to figure out her illness.
    Now here we have Christopher Nolan's 'Memento,' also set in California, with a main character is convinced he must hunt down his wife's killer, yet simultaneously suffering a total mental breakdown, the cause of which remains uncertain.  Filling so many of his more tender or pivotal moments is this sad, yearning synthesized music, the music of decisions and decay.
    The film is incredible, and it should be in major theaters, not just urban art theaters.  I'll admit many people won't get it, but there's enough to enjoy and think about here that the plot doesn't have to totally make sense the first time to be a great ride.  (Besides, plot complexity didn't stop people from putting out Mission:Impossibe.)  Moss and Pantoliano do a great job of being dubious friends/foes of Leonard Shelby, and I found Stephen Tobolowsky very poignant as Sammy.
    However, of course, the star of this movie is Guy Pearce.  If his performance were not so absolutely convincing, the movie would seem very contrived.  As it is, you are so drawn into his world and circumstances that plot twists stop being irritating.  Besides, how many times are we really going to find a movie that heads backward from the end, and still provides a suspenseful mystery and a moving drama?    I hardly ever write on the IMDB anymore.  I've lost a lot of faith since the multiplexes decided to only put out the most violent, lewd, overwhelming, and sensational pictures in major theatres, avoiding more complex, intriguing works.  (Why are Samuel L. Jackson, Guy Pearce, Ed Harris, Carrie-Anne Moss, Jamie Lee Curtis, and Pierce Brosnan all getting shuffled away to the 'art house?')  I needed to make a trip back for this picture, though.  Give it a look or two: 'Memento' is a winner.",Null,0,0,6 April 2001
Memento," The big difference
","I earlier commented on the mood and the score of 'Memento,' which evoked other California psychological dramas/thrillers like 'Heat' and 'Safe.' After seeing it again and looking at recent reactions to the film, I can say that Memento isn't the 9th best film ever made.  What it is becoming is a little hope to movielovers who are losing faith in theaters. They had 80 movies at Sundance, and only 8 of them found distribution. Even Memento, the Grand Prize winner, can only make it into 450 some theaters in the country, (despite having the fourth highest amount of money per location in the States according to Philadelphia Inquirer stats.) Meanwhile, at Cannes, Miramax picked up two films out of all the competitors, and the Palme D'or winner, 'The Son's Room,' was left behind by U.S. companies.  (Last year 'Dancer In the Dark' won this award.)    Harvey Weinstein explained the American art market is saturated, but it's saturated because we've stopped putting really edgy stuff into the art theaters...now even the ART theaters have to have commercially viable material, because our multiplex-dominated theater landscape is rejecting anything but the simplest stuff, never mind foreign films.  Box office stats are like Scripture these days: they allow guys like Bruckheimer to claim that 75 million on Pearl Harbor's opening weekend revealed the quality of the film/audience response to it.  All the opening gross for the first few days ever indicates is the quality and level of the hype for the movie in the days before it opened.  Variety doesn't even necessarily come with a 24-theater multiplex- it just means they'll show Star Wars Episode II on 5 screens, in half-hour intervals, leaving the struggling films aside.
   I bring this up because Memento is a perfect case of a really good movie that SHOULD be making box office records but has been ignored because of a little complexity and no megastar power.  People are saying it reminds them of the Sixth Sense.  Sorry, but without that ending and the performance of Haley Joel Osment, The Sixth Sense is not nearly as well-made a film as this.  Christopher Nolan's directing abilities, the writing, and the performances of his cast distinguish this film as a more than a trick-ending thriller.
  I agree the ending is misleading and confusing.  However, (SPOILER) it's not Teddy's words that make the ending powerful- it's seeing Lenny deceive himself, destroy photographs of himself, and create another hunt, lying to himself to be happy.  Maybe Teddy is the culprit, but the point is that Lenny MAKES him into John G., creates and destroys evidence where he pleases, making his records totally subjective and unreliable, despite his claims to the contrary.
  Maybe it's got a gimmick.  Maybe us reviewers are taking it too far, but I for one enjoy a movie that plays with our intelligence instead of just hitting us over the head with effects or pathos.  If this movie were #1 at the box office, I would likewise get tired of the hype, but instead it's being denied a chance to reach the majority of people.  Nolan and Pearce have made probably the best film of the spring, and not enough people are getting the opportunity to see it because of theaters eager to show the pre-determined 'blockbusters.'  I know it's only a movie, but given the general decline, and current lack of faith, within major theaters, Memento is a breath of fresh air.",Null,0,1,31 May 2001
Coffee and Cigarettes," Not original, but offbeat fun
","Jim Jarmusch movies, as a rule, need to be viewed late in the evening. The man's sense of humor and timing is not like your usual comedy: it fits that the first of these was made for Saturday Night Live, because these sketches need a late-night crowd.
    None of these sketches are amazing, though almost all of them have a certain kind of funky humor that it's enjoyable IF YOU LET THEM BE.  There is a giggle to be found in watching the gorgeous Renee French leaf through a guide to knives and semi-automatics over her coffee and cigarettes, the White Stripes' demonstration of a Tesla coil in a coffee shop, RZA's and GZA's health warnings to Bill Murray, Vinnie Vella's 'silent type' kid, and Isaach de Bankole's uncomfortable reunion with his moody friend Alex.  All of these and the better ones, Alfred Molina and Steve Coogan and Cate Blanchett, have some dose of humor, or at least appreciation of the art of people watching.
    The line that may define the Jarmusch style is his first line to Steve Buscemi in 'In The Soup.'  As an independent television director, Jarmusch interviews Steve for a part, and the first thing he says is 'You're reading my dog's mind, aren't you?'  Now, in most circumstances, this would not be funny, but if you're in JUST the right mood, something good starts bubbling up inside of you.  That's a lot like what this movie does, over the course of 12 short sketches, percolate a sense of the bizarre.  Just go and see the damn thing, and you'll have your own thoughts.",Null,1,2,23 May 2004
Finding Nemo," A good date movie!
","I know most guys my age, when thinking of movies to take a girl to, are probably thinking right now about 'Alex&Emma,' or maybe if she's hard-core enough you could both enjoy 'T3.'  Well, I've been out of the dating game for a little while, and out of the movie game for a film buff.  (Last Hollywood film I saw was Bruce Almighty, and that was bad enough to get me to swear off for a little while...)  However, somehow things came together that I got to take a beautiful girl to see what was a perfectly fun movie yesterday afternoon, and I was not the only guy taking a date to Finding Nemo! I love animated movies that offer something to both adults and kids, like Monsters, Inc. and Spirited Away.  This is another perfect example of that trend.  First comment out of my mouth after it was over: I said to Ali, 'These guys know how to deliver a heightened sense of reality.'  The colors, the movements, the FEEL that these guys bring to the ocean is incredible, and hopefully based on some great research and photography.    Now if only Winged Migration was making this much money...;>)",Null,0,0,7 July 2003
Brokeback Mountain," Brave film-making, but over-hyped
","I guess there had been enough built up about Brokeback Mountain as a great expression of the purity of love that I was really thinking 'Best Picture' material as I went in to see it. So, my expectations were high: they weren't met.For one thing, the plot seems to get lost about 3/4 of the way through the film. Especially once Jack is gone, I began thinking that the plot had lost its focus, and I was just waiting for the ending. The performances are worthwhile though, especially Ledger who seems to arrive already burdened or repressed even as the film just starts. Actually, it reminded me of Billy Bob Thornton's performance in Sling Blade, and suddenly I remembered how excellently Ledger had played Thornton's son in 'Monster's Ball.'However, the thing about Brokeback Mountain is it's not a great film: it's a well-made film about a subject almost no one is willing to tackle, men on the DL. Men carrying on homosexual affairs within the confines of marriage and family, not because they want to, but because they believe society's reaction to the truth would be so brutal that they'd be in fear for their lives.This was the 60s-70s, and to some degree, the fears these men have could still exist today. I wonder how much things have changed; are cases like Matthew Shepard rare anomalies or are they the kind of thing that could happen to many men who came out openly and refused the confines of marriage?I read one Christian site review that said the film was artistically made but still seemed to condone these men's choosing of homosexual relations, which they see as sinful. Still, it is what comes naturally to them, and as long as they hurt no one else in the process and mutually consent, then what is the harm? Why persecute them?In the end, the film is at times shocking, at times challenging, but overall more of a slow character study. Ledger is worth bearing with, seeming to always have layers to pull back of anger and passion. The film becomes remarkable not as a great work, but as a well-done film about a very difficult subject. ***.5",7,6,14,3 January 2006
Insomnia," Brilliant acting, why not twist the story?
","The first thing that I wondered when I left the theater this afternoon, and probably the only thing that hasn't already been said well, is that the storytelling lacked the brilliant twist of Memento, that is getting us inside the character's head through telling it backwards in ten-minute snippets.  That was weird, but it worked perfectly for creating the sympathy needed to get into Leonard Shelby.
     So what I thought immediately after seeing this flick is we need to be inside the head of Walter Finch, not Will Dormer.  If these guys really want to play up the moral ambiguity at the heart of the film, the questions about what is murder and when, we should start at the beginning: make Finch the protagonist and Dormer the adversary.  After all, that's how he would see himself right?  
      I mean, John Gammell could easily see through Leonard Shelby, just like Dormer can see through Finch.  So why not follow the guy who doesn't get it?  Have Finch, this guy who thinks he's committed no crime and thinks he can help out a cop who's made a mistake of his own, be our hero until the ending when the curtain is pulled up and Finch finally sees the light, just briefly.
     The film is magnificently shot, edited, acted all around, and don't get me wrong, Pacino plays his character brilliantly.  But we have seen this kind of guy before.  I wish the story itself had been as unconventional as Memento managed to be.  If you haven't seen Memento and you liked this...run to the video store NOW.
     One last question - Insomnia's score is by the same guy as Memento, but it doesn't have the same effect.  Am I the only one who's still haunted by the synthesized music from that movie?",Null,0,0,12 June 2002
Snatch," A great caper without a lead
","I enjoyed the first hour or so of 'Snatch', Guy Ritchie's new gangster caper, especially any moment with Frankie Four Fingers (Benicio), the unstoppable Boris the Blade (Rade), or the inept trio of robbers with Tyrone, possibly THE worst getaway driver ever.  It was around the point that Brick Top (an incredibly vicious performance) began explaining just how pigs devour human flesh that I found the film a little too vicious, a feeling enhanced by my mother's revulsion in her seat.  Then came Bullet-Tooth Tony bringing just a touch too much carnage, though his repeated and failed attempts to kill Boris are hilarious.  (Somebody give Rade Sherbedgia a film worth his sense of comic timing!) The biggest problem with 'Snatch' is that it lacks a strong lead.  Pulp Fiction got away with it, because you're ultimately redeemed by Samuel L. Jackson's transformation.  The similar 'Get Shorty' had John Travolta's cool cat Chili Palmer.  Here, Turkish (Jason Statham) has got just the right tone for narration, but his character is not at all interesting.  I would have much preferred transferring the story over to Sol, Vinny, and Tyrone and their attempts to get out of the mess with Brick Top and Bullet Tooth and dispose of their increasing number of bodies.    Brad Pitt plays his minor role effectively, obviously having a devilishly good time with his accent.  Benicio del Toro was likewise enjoying himself- 'Chai'm not in Rrrome.  Chai'm in a rrrush.'  It got to be a little too feverish for a story where eventually you didn't like the supposed 'main' characters.  The video effects and cinematography were brilliant though- I especially liked the Tarantinoesque re-arrangement of the car crashes and Tony's speech to the robbers.  See it with a bunch of friends, but realize it's not for the squeamish- it's a type of bloody fun we haven't seen in a few years. **.5",Null,0,1,20 January 2001

Alien," This time, the Company is scarier
","You know, back when I was watching Alien 3 over and over again, as a big fan of David Fincher, I realized that perhaps the scariest element of the movie wasn't the alien: it was the Company.  Throughout the third film, Ripley is racing against time to avoid the Company's arrival to pick up and transport the alien to be used for their bioweapons division.  The same problem occurred in Aliens, and once again it happens here.    Only in Alien, the personality of the Company is really embodied in Ashe (Ian Holm.)  I've seen Ian Holm do a wide variety of characters, but this character is chilling.  His performance alone makes us understand why Ripley so distrusts Bishop (Lance Henriksen) in Aliens.  He is the exact same as the ship itself and the space around him: cold, calculating, and unfeeling. Having to display any emotion besides determination is a bit of a NUISANCE for him.    (SPOILER)  When only Parker, Lambert, and Ripley are left, Lambert makes the interesting point to Ashe: 'You admire it [the alien.]'  Ashe responds, 'I admire its purity of purpose: survival, unencumbered by guilt, remorse, or delusions of morality.'  The morbid fascination Ashe, and by extension the Copmany, shows for this killing machine chills me more than the machine itself, perhaps especially given the war-torn times we seem to be living in. Indeed, his attack on Ripley is to me more frightening this time around than any of the attacks of the alien, besides of course the initial eruption (SPOILER) from Caine (John Hurt) whose experience is still the most revolting and disturbing thing in the film.  It didn't take fancy special effects to convey the eerieness of the alien's taking of Caine as its host organism.    So, yes, in the end, 'Aliens' is a far more intense and gratifying film, but when it comes to personifying the creation of the alien, and the heartless calculation of those who would use it, this film is chilling.  You won't leave shaking, but it still sticks with you.",Null,0,1,2 November 2003
Lost in Translation," 1/2 comedy, 1/2 love story= 1 hit
","The first piece of good news: 'Lost' is the first independent film, in case anybody was watching, that penetrated the 'Top 10' since the beginning of the summer.  None of the summer's indies, no matter how praised, got there till now. Thankfully, Bill Murray is a name that still gets some box office attention, especially from 20-somethings like me that grew up with his stuff.
    The bad news: 'Lost' is not a Bill Murray movie, at least not like Scrooged, Ghostbusters, or Groundhog Day.  This is the other guy who's trying his hand at Hamlet (well done), Rushmore (ditto) and The Royal Tenenbaums (??)  He's not going for slapstick, though certainly still a physical comedian.  The comedy of 'Lost' seems to transform halfway through into a somber love story about two drifters, both married unhappily, in the wrong place...but maybe at the right time.       More good news: 'Lost in Translation' relies on moments, not plot, and the moments work.  The hospital waiting room scene, and all the Santori scenes, are hysterical, and even when the comedy erodes, Murray is ABLE TO HOLD HIS OWN DRAMATICALLY.  That was the revelation for me: we've seen Murray try to be serious in his comedies, whether repentant or reflective, without getting at us.  However, he finds that balance here between a melancholy and a lighthearted guy who's falling in love in spite of himself.
    Speaking of balancing moments, the last ten minutes are a great balancing act between Johannson and Murray as they try saying goodbye in a formal, easy way over and over again until finally giving in at the last minute.  The emotion works and clarifies a lot of what's been unsaid up to that point, though given the secretive nature of the ending, there's still some unsaid to the audience.
    The other interesting issue here is the way the movie rather haphazardly depicts Japan, or at least the city of Tokyo, as a hyperactive land of (fill in the blank) imbeciles? bourgeoisie?  really really shallow short people? techno-addicts?  imbeciles? party people?  Every time Johansson escapes from the city, she seems to find the good in the culture, but Murray seems disgusted throughout a lot of the movie (though he does love the music). Then again, better to be honest than politically correct...
    I agree that 'Lost in Translation' is Murray's best shot to get an Oscar nomination: much like Jack Nicholson in last year's 'About Schmidt,' he has put in a quiet tragicomic effort that hits home.  ***.5  Johansson's character more than holds her own with Murray, despite the age factor: he plays young, she plays it old. One of the best scenes in regards to that is the sad-sack Murray cheering up the despairing Johansson with the line 'You're not hopeless,' which is such a reversal of who'd normally give the punches in the shoulder...So 5 questions for Sofia Coppola: (Sofia, feel free to write back) 1.To what degree is this autobiographical?2.Did you write this with Murray in mind, and if not, how'd he get there?3.Why is the first shot of Johansson's butt?  (Not that I'm complaining, especially given the alternative of Murray's butt.)4.Tell us everything about how the scene with the short Japanese woman in the hospital waiting room came together.5.Do you think, and how do you think, this will play in Japan?",Null,0,0,22 September 2003
Léon: The Professional," Always leaves me breathless
","The story and dialogue are absurd on paper: a young girl is taken in by a hitman after her family is killed by corrupt cops.  She gets a taste of vengeance while he gets a taste of life...Or dialogue written like: LEON sees MATHILDA crying.  He hands her a tissue.MATHILDA: Is life always this tough, or only when you're a kid?(Pause)LEON: Always like this.Oh, the schmaltz of the written word, but yet THE PROFESSIONAL is one of the tightest, most breathless action pictures I have ever seen.  I would also call it a tragic romance, but that would be improper...I'm going to assume that if you're reading the review, you've seen the movie and are interested in what others thought about it.  The anonymous who wrote in thinking that it a badly acted piece of tripe with no characters to root for has something right: I admit that there are awkward pauses in the film and dialogue that is over-sentimental and stupid.  However, I don't see how you can't root for these two to survive.Leon is revived by Matilda as much as he is disturbed.  As soon as he decides not to pull the trigger that night, he puts his life at risk.  The issue of pedophilia here is a concern, but dangerously so because Portman does such a DAMN good job of portraying sophistication, grace, sadness, beauty, and rage in her kid character.  I'm surprised she didn't get a single nomination for this, while Anna Paquin got a Best Sup'ting Actress for a much simpler role...
Leon kills without mercy or heart and has only the one rule 'no women, no kids.'  He teaches his code to Mathilde, pushing her to clean up her act while also teaching her a bit of his own cleaning at her command.  The rooftop sequence is striking. Gary Oldman, as the DEA cop, is wacky, strange, off-key.  Yet for me, he comes to represent the spirit of New York in Besson's vision: it is energy, chaos, mystery, corruption, sleaze, and violence.  If Stansfield is the official voice of law and order, then we need to retreat to the outlaws, those who operate outside the city's law but in their own select codes. Oldman is unsettling in the film and is the polar opposite to Leon, whom we grow comfortable with despite his pathology because we can predict his behavior and routine: we can respect it.The music and cinematography lend an urgency to the film's plot, and really there isn't that much time for character development.  Characters develop through the plot, through learning to get revenge, through the lessons of Leon to Mathilde, the strange acts of Mathilde under Leon's care.There are some really strange similarities between this film and the Fifth Element: both involve a reluctant recluse with a bare-looking home deciding to take a chance on a girl running away from police.  Both involve similar opening credit sequences, and both have similar admissions of love at pivotal moments.Fifth Element: The four elements are gathered together in the Egyptian temple but the evil is coming to destroy the world.  Korben Dallas has to convince the cynical, weakened Leelu that he loves her and that love is worth saving so that she will accept the unity of herself with the elements and conquer the evil.  A breathless embrace between the two yields the winning result.  Korben screams as divine light hits Leelu's body.The Professional:  A SWAT team is gathering together a projectile bomb to fire into Leon's apartment.  Leon must convince the desperate, scared Mathilde that separating is the only way for them to survive, that she must escape the apartment on her own.  He confesses his love for her and she returns it. The Professional is not a film for everyone: the violence can be extreme, and the ending is a bit of a retreat.  However, despite the violence, the acting, atmosphere, and pace of the film make it a winner. Jean Reno and Natalie Portman are an awkward-looking but somehow perfect pair.  I would love to see a sequel where Mathilda renounces becoming a good girl in N.J. and declares herself a freelance cleaner.  This film may be melodramatic pseudo-art tripe to some, and from the outside or on paper, I can agree.  However, in the theater, on the screen, The Professional is one of the best, most seductive, and gritty action films I've seen in the 90s.",Null,0,1,25 April 1999
The Bourne Identity," Slam-bang sheisse smart
","I had wanted to see this one for a while due to some good reviews and of course the combination of Doug Liman directing Franka Potente in a spy movie.  To be honest, I wasn't expecting to be all that impressed with Damon.  However, he ends up doing a marvelous job of portraying a seemingly average Joe in a no-memory predicament (think Leonard Shelby) who seems to have the instincts of James Bond and Bruce Lee together (the embassy sequence is especially savvy.)  The action sequences here feel realistic also, (with the possible exception of that final stunt), and the showdown between Clive Owen and Damon is very tight and unusually quiet for a Hollywood thriller. Actually, the setting, direction, editing, music, frequent use of subtitles, and the use of Franka Potente (brilliant pairing, but why do they go from making out to him sleeping on the floor?) as Damon's love interest make this whole thing feel very much like a European spy thriller.  I felt like I was watching a Luc Besson film, but Besson hasn't done anything this good in years.  The ending does a very good job of pulling together the loose ends, and I heard they had a hard time figuring out what to do.  Kudos for making it work.   Our reel had some problems (It's been playing every night since June 14, so I forgive the projectionist!) and so a few plot points were missed.  What was Alliance Securities, and how did they find it?  How was Kane connected to the boat?  How did Bourne know that pressing R on his phone would link him to the Hotel Regina?  How did Wombosi or Bourne know to go to that morgue to search for the body, and whose body WAS in the bag, if not his?  I might just go see it again, so it makes more sense.   So far, Hollywood this summer has provided some really inventive films. Insomnia, Star Wars Episode II, My Big Fat Greek Wedding, Bourne Identity, Reign of Fire, Road to Perdition, Austin Powers 3, even Minority Report with its cliched ending provided some cool moments.  Keep it up guys!  It seems we're going through a bit of a rebirth!",Null,1,2,5 August 2002
The Italian Job," Breezy fun
","I guess I was surprised how enjoyable and just light this film was.  It seemed like it could have almost been rated PG with a risky enough ratings board.  I mean, think about it: no shootings in the climactic minutes, no sex scenes, not all that much obscenity, and no scandalous or heavy concepts to take in.  The Italian Job seems weirdly almost a family film... The Italian Job is like some of the great caper/action flicks (Sneakers, The Firm) in that there's a smart villain who can anticipate the movements of his opponent, and the good guys do have to work as a team to meet the challenge.  There're some brilliant moves in this game, and the players are obviously having a great time.  I mean, even in the REHEARSAL of driving the Mini-Coops through the train tunnels, you can tell how charged these guys are.  And the chemistry between all of them, given what a strange hodgepodge they are, reminds me a lot of what made Sneakers so great. However, Sneakers also had THE BOX.  And THE BOX has a lot of symbolic things going for it, like the prelude to the information superhighway, the meaning of spying in the post-Cold War world, ideas about media control, and perception of reality mattering more than reality.  Here, we've got the same charm, but all we're talking about is gold.  So, this is a fun movie, but it won't stick in popular memory like Sneakers has for me and many others. It's a great night out, and this summer, that's all I'm looking to get. ***.5",Null,0,0,30 July 2003
The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring," The definition of epic
","Well, I went to the late show of this film expecting Star Wars, and I have to say it ALMOST fit the bill.  I think my main problem was that I knew the hero's objective (throwing the rings into the fire) wouldn't be reached by the end.  I knew they'd have to cut off at some other prominent seeming point, and so, several times, I was wondering is THIS where they'll end it? (I've never read the books, besides The Hobbit.)  So my several near-ends: 1.The Fellowship is actually formed and forged in Rivendell.  (By the way, as Hugo Weaving said, 'The ring must be destroyed,' I distinctly heard the guy to my right add, 'Mr. ANDerson.')  2.When Gandalf dies in the mines and they emerge on the other side.  After all, another great sweeping vista and a sense of completion/loss.  3.When they leave the elf-witch's kingdom on the boat with the army on the rise.  (I REALLY thought it was ending here.) So, by the time the film had actually ended, it felt kind of anticlimactic to just have Sam and Frodo embrace on the mountaintop.    This is really a film about worlds and monsters, and there's probably something missing since instead of our imagination creating these things out of Tolkien's words, we experience them instantaneously, though miraculously, on the screen.  The Shadow Demon, the giant orc beast in the mines, Sauron, the tentacled monster of the swamp, the Ring Wraiths (my god, what intensity!), the Golem, the Orcs, and Saruman's day army were all incredible creations, as powerful as the details put into the worlds these travelers went through.  Personally, I thought the acting fine, especially by Mortensen (reminding me of a Han Solo type for some reason), Sean Bean, Ian Holm, and Ian McKellen  ('YOU SHALL NOT PASS!!'.)  I didn't quite find myself engrossed in Frodo's character: he has far yet to come, and he needs to get a little ANGRY.  Even Liv Tyler did a great job, and the Elvish language is gorgeous. The best thing I can say about this movie is that it's good enough to make me go out and find a copy of the Two Towers to read over the holiday. Make the best out of the times we find ourselves in.",Null,0,0,20 December 2001
American Beauty," A mess, but a fine, compelling mess
","This is not the best picture of 1999.  It however may be the most accessible picture of 1999, in that it tries to be cutting-edge and yet mainstream, cynical yet heartfelt, Todd Solondz and Frank Capra at once. Real-life suburban America is as pathetic as it is gorgeous, as shown by Ricky Fitts, a video-maker/drug dealer who spends his free time showing the beauty in what many do not consider worth a glance.  I know I was getting teary while I was in the theater, yet something changed once I left: American Beauty is very compelling, excellently shot (who is the cinematographer?), edited, directed, and acted.  However, it's also rather false/crude: it condenses way too much and ends up giving caricatures and surface in the disguise of poetic monologue instead of real depth.  The film settles for titillation with its overstepping of social boundaries when it could actually try to be provocative.    You've probably read enough reviews to know the plot and the characters. All of them are pretty over-the-top, with the exception of Alison Janney as Ricky's mother, wonderfully absent in the film.  She perhaps says more about the life of a housewife with her line 'Sorry for the way the house looks' than Annette Bening can in her incessant rage.  Spacey is as always incredible, but there's something missing, or forced about Lester Burnham.  That last Kodak-like monologue reflecting on his childhood, the moments when he speaks nostalgically about college life and meeting Carolyn, even the way he says 'I'm great' at the end, all seem very scripted, like a great actor striving to reach a character from a mediocre script.  OK- He's in a suburban daze!  Right, and he wakes up and remembers how good it was to be young cause he meets this hot chick!  And then he dies right when he's happiest!  Finally, he gets this great monologue about how great it was to be alive!  Raymond Carver, this ain't.  It's way too forced.    It's worthwhile and certainly compelling, but the film shouts things in its dialogue that need not be SAID.  It contains crudely drawn characters reaching for a 3d dimension.  For me, the actor most transcending his lines is Chris Cooper, playing a truly repulsive human being who somehow ends up stirring you and making a lot of sense.    Again, the film is worthwhile, but not the best of 1999, especially if you consider the int'l market.  See All About My Mother for a film about the interactions of extreme/pathetic characters well-drawn out and excellently acted, Fight Club for a film that really deals with breaking out of the 90s shell, and The Dreamlife of Angels for the real beauty in the simple things. American Beauty is like a Reader's Digest edition of the three: worthwhile but only a rough draft.",Null,0,0,22 January 2000
Being John Malkovich," Fun that leaves you pondering...
","I don't think Being John Malkovich is a great film, but it did deserve the Best Original Screenplay Award far more than American Beauty.  There are flaws to the film, many non sequiturs and overloads on plot threads. However, Spike Jonze's debut is essentially an ingenious look at being obsessed and infatuated, whether with celebrity, sex, or the idea of eternal life.  The truth is all three have their flaws and their mediocrity, just like us.  The film has sparks of brilliance: does anybody recognize EXACTLY where on the Tpk. they filmed it?  Of course it's a perfect endpoint because on the New Jersey Turnpike, you're either in such a rush or so bored by the lack of scenery that you don't bother to look left or right to see people falling from the sky.  Besides that, for the next week, I will recall with a giggle a scene of a restaurant full of bald-headed men and women reading from menus of 'Malkovich, Malkovich, MALKOVICH!'
   The characters here are almost all pathetic, yet at the same time I didn't get a sense of sarcasm on Jonze's part as with Anderson in Boogie Nights.  Here, they were simply deeply flawed people.  It was tragic to see how Cusack replicated his sad-sack self within the body of Malkovich, even while able to bring his puppetry to new heights.  Diaz was a real revelation here, playing totally against type, believable in all her goofy nerdiness, though she is known for much sexier roles.  Keener, (also great in Living in Oblivion) was great to watch here, though an absolute cow!    I would rather see Charlie Kaufman and Spike Jonze's work anytime than something that purports to be high art and preaches to the audience instead of entertaining it.  Being John Malkovich establishes itself as, and remains for the most part, a rewarding goofy comedy, with some tender moments and food for our heads at the end.  Even if we could leave our own bodies for the mind of John Malkovich, we wouldn't be able to escape who we are.  So why try?",Null,0,0,29 April 2000
Spider-Man," Parker's awesome, but where's Spidey?
","Spider Man's origin is told really well in this story, ending in an awesome chase as Spidey discovers his ability to weave between buildings and chases down his uncle's killer.  Somehow, the Green Goblin battle doesn't quite mesh with that story, though it's got the right performances from Willem Dafoe and Tobey Maguire, as well as an innocent but sexy Kirsten Dunst.One thing's missing.  I, like many, was a huge Spider Man fan growing up for two reasons.  On the one hand, Peter Parker was a nerd, like myself, who had to figure out what to do with an incredible gift, how to take advantage of it and use it wisely.  Sam Raimi and Koepp get this down.But the other reason Spider Man was awesome is his sense of humor: SPIDEY IS THE MUHAMMAD ALI OF SUPERHEROES.  This is a guy who when he was dodging Doc Ock's tentacles, Electro's bolts, the Lizard's bites, or the Sandman's traps, was constantly ripping on them.  He was full of pop references, and would sing as he swung.  (Actually, maybe it was also due to growing up in the 80s when New York was a far more interesting place to be a superhero/villain than 2002.)Maguire gets at Spidey's playfulness, but there's a whole lot of wit to this character that goes untapped (it's part of his nerdiness!) But I can't remember one good insult that Spidey threw in the whole story.  The only real funny 'Spidey' moment is when Tobey stands on the rooftop trying to figure out how the heck to get that web to start up again: 'FLY, WEB, FLY! SHAZAM!'  The rest -- sorry to say -- gives Spider Man the demeanor of Batman, when really it's in the tight spots that his mouth ought to run the best.So, as the story of a beginning, a tale everyone should discover, Spider Man serves it up.  As for you avid Marvel fans, I agree with another reviewer: X Men was a far more thrilling emotional and special-effects movie.  Sam Raimi captures Peter Parker just fine, but until they get somebody like Jon Stewart writing the webslinger's 2003 dialogue, the world still hasn't met the real Spidey.",Null,0,0,6 May 2002
Ocean's Eleven," Something missing...
","I can't quite say what was missing from Ocean's Eleven.  The heist itself seemed a bit hard to follow with all the eleven guys contributing to distractions from the robbery itself.  There seemed far too many little twists, and yet I didn't care about them.  I think there isn't a single moment in the film where I shook my head in disbelief. The best heist movie of 2001 was The Score.  Why?  Because a simple job becomes complicated, and two guys who are not going to be the best of friends go head-to-head in the heist itself.  The heist is not so complicated in the Score, but we are in DeNiro's head so we seriously sympathize with every grunt, wrong turn, and realization he goes through. (The way he actually pulls off his robbery is quite clever.)    Something about Ocean's Eleven is too sure of itself.  You know what's going to happen before it does.  I liked the scenery, the photography, and some of the characterizations were also quite fun.  However, where are the characters and the suspense?  Why is Andy Garcia so damn calm and lifeless throughout the film?  The Washington Post said that Ocean's Eleven was MI, Dirty Dozen, and the Sting rolled into one.  It'd like to be all those things.  All I can say is the film that does the team heist to the best degree is SNEAKERS.  Always will be.       Why?  Because of the camaraderie of the team, the simultaneous desperation and talent in each member, the writing, the villain, the plot, the wonderful prize of 'the box.'  The pure sweat that it ended up taking to get away with the job done. You never draw a breath in Ocean's Eleven...well, except when that mini-truck gets crushed by the monster truck.  Onto to better films...",Null,0,0,8 December 2001
Spirited Away," Between 'Wonderland' & 'Little China'
","This film is a thoroughly impressive tale, with astounding animation and a great amount of humor, emotion, excitement, and absolutely incredible imagination.  From the moment young Chihiro's parents turn into pigs, Spirited Away lies somewhere in between 'Alice in Wonderland' and 'Big Trouble in Little China.'  A somewhat regular Jane is thrust into a world of spirits, toads, monsters, and one BIG BEB-BEH (as Fat Bastard would call him.)
I will just say that I have only watched one other Japanese animated movie, and that was the post-apocalyptic classic AKIRA a while back, which was definitely not suited for kids.  In contrast, SPIRITED AWAY was fine for both kids and adults, as really a lesson in how kindness, bravery, and as someone else said, lack of greed or violence can make one into a hero.
(SPOILER)  The No-Face character got almost too much attention, but the core story of what he is, becomes, and how he is 'defeated' is wonderful. So are the characters of the river spirit, Yubaba, Kamagi, the toad, Haku, and all the others who populate this mysterious universe.  (I don't know why, but the little moment between the Radish Spirit and Chihiro in the elevator had me doubling over.)  This film is an eye-popping treat, that while maybe 15 minutes too long, will definitely give you a smile on your way home.",Null,0,1,5 October 2002
"Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon"," An achievement in pop, a good but not great film
","I read a great story on new Asian filmmaking in a New York Times Sunday edition a few weeks back. It posed the question, 'Does 'Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon' work because it is Asian, or because it so not Asian?'  The film invokes a dead ancient culture of warriors and princesses in a very archetypal fairy-tale sort of way that works as an adventure film but not as a character study.  Likewise, it creates a mythic world, akin to the Western, that does not resemble the realities of the era.  Are we looking for a foreign culture to embrace in pop culture- take a look at Charlie's Angels.  There is a definite utilization of black and Asian icons and culture to add definition to a film that is otherwise stuck in the 80s.  I wonder if this film's popularity isn't part of that search.  Maybe, it's even partially something Lee himself is searching for as a Westchester County resident, some mythical honor-code culture that no longer exists to enliven his otherwise atomized, isolated white suburbia.What must be acknowledged is that this film has done something very few people expected: it proved that a foreign language film doesn't have to be dubbed to succeed nationwide.  Jackie Chan might try releasing his next picture without dubbing over.  However, this may only be working because Crouching Tiger is an action movie.  I fear then that the movie is a fluke, and no film dealing with modern China and Asia, nothing by Wong Kar-Wai or Chen Kaige, is going to make its way into the multiplexes.(Instead we'll get more crap like Brokedown Palace.)  This is not to say Crouching Tiger Hidden Dragon is not well made: it has wonderful cinematography and action sequences, along with good performances from Zhang Ziyi and Chow Yun Fat. However, it is not the best film of the year, certainly not the masterpiece critics are making it out to be.  In fact, in spite of my anger at Gladiator winning Best Picture at the Golden Globes, for action combined with all around great casting (Crowe, Phoenix, Connie Nielsen, Oliver Reed, and Richard Harris), cinematography, and writing, Gladiator was overall a far more provocative and powerful film.  Feel free to disagree.",Null,0,0,31 January 2001
The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers," 2 TOWERS: Vast improvement over Fellowship
","With the Fellowship of the Ring, I felt I got my money's worth in effects and action, but the characters and emotions lagged behind all the scene-changing.  With the Two Towers, the balance has been restored.  Unlike the Fellowship, which feels like a very incomplete though incredibly epic film, the Two Towers has a certain beginning and end to it.  Also, the characterizations are well worth watching.  Strangely enough, though, the characters to watch are NOT those of the Fellowship: the two TOWERING performances here are those of Bernard Hill as King Theodain, and Andy Sperkis as Gollum, perhaps the strongest, most riveting and humanistic CG/actor creation since Yoda.     The nighttime mono/dialogue in the forest between Gollum's two selves had me bent forward into my seat, peering with wonder as I only remember doing about 2 years back, hearing for the first time Leonard Shelby's bedside monologue in Memento about wondering how he can ever heal if he 'can't feel time.'  Meanwhile, King Theodain's slow and quite believable rise from a vegetable on a throne to a true warrior was just as inspiring, and Hill brings both subtlety and honor to his acting.  People in the theater wept as he wept, and cheered as he rode into battle.   The story advances briskly, and though both Ian McKellen and Cate Blanchett are given short shrift, Frodo's relation to the ring is further developed.  I said in my review last year that Frodo needed to get a little angry, and uh...I got my wish.  The action sequences are incredible, but so are the little moments.     In short, this film IS what EMPIRE STRIKES BACK was to STAR WARS, a dose of extra adrenaline, humanity, darkness, character, wonder, and complexity to what was up until then a fairy tale.  I HOPE THE THIRD CHAPTER FOLLOWS IN ITS FOOTSTEPS!",Null,0,0,29 December 2002
Men in Black II," What do you expect?
","People, MIB2's not a movie for critics: it is just supposed to be a fun time for kids and families, a comic book.  For the most part, the flick accomplishes what it sets out to do, with some fun moments, interesting new characters, and what has already been referred to as an AWESOME last 30 seconds.    I do have to say one thing though: I am tired of the ads and the previews taking over 15 minutes before the movie gets started.  I mean, we already get the product placements in the film.  We pay more than pay-per-view which is commercial free: why should we have to watch ads before seeing the movie?  And put previews back at the end like in the 70s, when it ensured that you watched the end credits.
    MIB II could have been played a bit more loose, but I was especially awed by how Tommy Lee Jones actually brought some emotion to the role this time, more than in the first film.  Only he could have made the line, 'It rains because you're crying, baby,' sound that authentic.
    The movie will make a ton of money: I just hope they keep on putting out adult films as well (that is movies for adults, not -- well you know what I mean...  )HAPPY 4TH!",Null,0,0,3 July 2002
Children of Men," Stunned, saddened, and stirred by powerful film
","I left the theater initially just arguing with my dad that the tale isn't so hopeless as he thought. We talked for a little while, and then shortly after we got home, I turned to him and had to give him a hug. The vision in this film is very disturbing, I suspect, because we live in wartime.Our country is in the midst of a war that we are not certain how to stop, and there are other conflicts in the world around us that we haven't committed to ending. Israel and Palestine, Lebanon, Sudan, Ethiopia, Somalia-there are many cases right now of desperate armed conflict much like what we see in this film.It is my sincere hope that HOPE can be revived in these regions: there are relief workers in all of these areas and peace workers fighting for it. Brave groups like Medicines Sans Frontieres, the UN, other NGOs, and parts of our government that are trying to instill hope and foster peaceful solutions. I don't know what can be done in the Sudan, but thinking of people like Don Cheadle's character in Hotel Rwanda, one start is trying to just save lives and say 'Enough bloodshed.'Even where I live here in New York, we have youth that are used to violence in their lives, along with drugs and teenage pregnancy. However at the same time, in the school where I work, they find hope to go to college, get out of the neighborhood, and/or maybe even change it for the better. I don't think we can call ghettoes and slums lost causes, because once we do all that is left is to cut ourselves off from them like severing limbs.If we do cut ourselves off from our local and international war zones and conflicts, we will end up creating the kind of apartheidist society envisioned in Children of Men where force is the only answer anyone has anymore. The infertility problem in Children of Men is more of a symbol than a science-fiction creation: it stands to me for a lack of hope, a resignation: King spoke of that death of the spirit that comes when we stop fighting for what we believe in, and to King, that meant NONVIOLENT action against all oppression.If this film serves as a wake-up call, it will do some good. At the very least, it is a potent well-acted suspenseful allegory. SPOILER: It is enough that watching this film, you honestly believe that gunmen could hush in awe at the sound of a baby's cry. Let us heal the broken parts of our world.",7,1,3,7 January 2007
The Nightmare Before Christmas," A rare beauty, with a dash of guilty pleasure...
","One IMDBer compared the joy received from the Nightmare Before Christmas to that of Willy Wonka and the Chocolate Factory.  I agree: ever since I was a little boy, Willy Wonka astounded me, and the more I see it, the more I admire Gene Wilder for the absolute wacko, mad, and yet kind genius that he Willy Wonka.  However, the other elements tend to fade over time (besides Veruca Salt, who you can't help but love/hate.)   The Nightmare Before Christmas is just the opposite: a joy in every element, not just performances.  I can hardly think of a single Disney film or animated feature that is as bold and visionary as Henry Selick's movie- I enjoyed the Little Mermaid, Lion King, and Beauty and the Beast thoroughly but Selick's fable has a sense of humor and originality that the other films lack in their Disney propriety and G ratings...Bittersweet romance, tragedy, action, comedy, and a healthy dose of guilty pleasure for one and all.  Come on, didn't we all love seeing the fat kid getting chased by the pumpkin-in-the-box, and the little boy receiving a shrunken head wrapped in a bow?  :>)  
    Every time I see this little gem, I am once again amazed at the vision and imagination of its animators, writers, and of course Danny Elfman, whose music I have admired since Batman in 1989.  I wish he'd do something like this again (James and the Giant Peach was a bit of a disappointment.)   I think this movie works for a certain type of kid: parents are the best judges.  It certainly has its more icky and scary moments, but it's also a really tender movie.  Jack just wants to give the people something to remember him by, no harm intended!  In the end, boys gets girl, Christmas and Halloween live in peace, and everyone lives happily ever after.  So by the end, any film buff should feel in a state of bliss: The Nightmare Before Christmas stands in a league of its own.  No matter how other animated films advance the technology, I challenge them to combine it with the ideas, the sentiments, the score, and the pure pleasure that this film packs.",Null,0,1,26 February 2000
The Insider," Subtle, chilling, and stirring
","Mann's fourth picture, The Insider, is even better paced and put together than Heat.  Although Lowell Bergman comes out as being a little TOO idealistic,(my colleagues at ABCNews refute Pacino's portrayal,) his rage in response to the suppression of the Wigand story makes perfect sense, given the devotion Bergman put into securing the trust of his source.  As for Crowe- this guy is right up there with Daniel Day-Lewis right now in terms of his range and conviction.  In going from L.A. Confidential to The Insider and then Gladiator, Crowe shows a huge range of acting ability.  The supporting cast does their job wonderfully, especially Plummer as Mike Wallace.  However, the biggest star of the film, after Crowe and Pacino, is the cinematography.     Dante Spinotti captured America's natural grandeur and sensual beauty in Last of the Mohicans.  Here, he likewise effortlessly brings us into claustrophobic, numb, and disorienting realms of suburban and corporate America- (I'm no longer sure Conrad Hall deserved best cinematographer at the Oscars.)  The music is an odd choice, filling a story of American greed, corruption, and crumbling ideals with what sounds like tribal and spiritual music from the East.  But it ultimately works! What I most like about the Insider is that it refuses to dumb down its script, images, or characters.  Mann respects the minds of his audience, unlike Alan Ball's script for American Beauty.  The Insider is an intelligently made film that demands your attention and rewards it.",Null,0,0,9 July 2000
The Matrix Reloaded," Not the model sequel, but a fun ride
","Again and again, when thinking about action movie sequels, I come back to the Empire Strikes Back as a model.  For one thing, it deepened the storyline, with Luke entering Jedi training and finding out more about his family.  For another, it deepened the relationships of Han and Leia, and Darth and Luke.  On the most important level, it introduced us to brand new worlds and characters like Yoda and Boba Fett, Cloud City, and Dagobah. Finally, the great ride ended with one story completed, and another one begun. Since the Matrix is my generation's Star Wars (I believe), Empire is worth a comparison.  The Matrix Reloaded clearly does not match up, for two big reasons: the characters are diluted more than in the first film, and the resolution of 'Empire' is absent at the end of 'Reloaded' in a big way.  I kept thinking there were so many moments when the film might end all of a sudden, but the one they chose was so far drawn out.   Also, in 'Reloaded,' as my friend pointed out, none of the characters seem to be having as much fun as they did the first time around, except for Agent Smith, who I guess is now just SMITH.  However, even his character is no longer the main bad guy, and that's a big hole in the film: the lack of a central villain to focus on.  I suppose the closest thing is the Merovingian, smartly played by Lambert Wilson, but even that conflict is diluted in the midst of all the philosophical talk and side battles.   Finally, what's really lost for me is the mind-blowing surprises of the first film: the first time we see Neo dodge bullets, when he actually stops the bullets, when Morpheus and he fight for the first time, when Neo ENTERS Agent Smith, all of these events that are now like iconic imagery to me-- 'Reloaded' creates little of that by comparison, with the sole exceptions (SPOILER) of the multiple Neos on the TV screens and Neo's furious flight through the city at the end.

Mystic River," Plot doesn't hit me, but Robbins stays wit' me
","I have to say that this film doesn't quite work: for one thing, thescore enters in at all those high emotion moments to too high adegree.  The plot twists and turns don't quite make sense, with thefinal killer revealed seeming almost like a Scooby Doo ending. However, the real loss here for me is that the ending does not doDave's character justice.  So, he's been killed and put in the river. He's missing.  And the last thing we see is the river, almost likethat last shot in Psycho where the jeep is being pulled out of thepond.  However, this shot gives no indication of him being located,just 'washed away' as is Jimmy's sin seemingly washed away byhis wife.  All he can do is throw up his hands when Bacon giveshim that hard stare.
   This is a shame especially because the only character that reallyhits you is Robbins, besides Fishburne as Sean's partner Whitey. Robbins, as partnered with a wonderfully alive Marcia Gay Harden,is cynical, hopeful, scared, frightening, nurturing, delusional, funny,cunning, smart: in short, he is human and multi-dimensional. Sean Penn doesn't seem to be able to find all the angles onJimmy Markham.
    So, in the end, if this goes up for anything, I would hope it winsRobbins a Best Supporting Actor Oscar.  Besides that, I wouldn'taward it a thing: yes, it is all about acting and drama and plot. However, just because you're making an 'adult' film as opposedto a kid's movie, you still have to show skill.  FInding Nemo wasbetter plotted and executed than this, Clint.

A Beautiful Mind," Excellent film
","Saw a Sunday at 9:30 pm show, huge theater, with myself and about 4 other people in attendance.  I guess that's kind of appropriate for this film.  I don't consider this to be tripe.  I think it quite possibly could have been tripe if that last shot of Charles, Marcee, and Parcher had had them suddenly gone after the crowd passed by.  The singular thing for me about the film is that this is not about being cured of mental illness, but rather learning to live with it.    I guess the point has been made in other films, triumph of the human spirit, live in the heart not in the head, but there is something exceptional about the performances here of Jennifer Connelly and Russell Crowe, as a hopeful and yet tortured couple.  It's a love story at its core, and in that respect, it's incredibly dignified.  The scene where they first meet in the mental institution is very powerful.    The score, cinematography, and supporting cast all shine here.  For some reason, I found myself wondering what the little girl was told her part was. Is she a ghost?  Is she John's imaginary friend?  Or did they say that John was a sick person who needed help, and saw things when he wasn't feeling well?  That relationship especially shocked me for some reason.   
   Finally, I must say though that the film doesn't quite do justice to Nash's theories.  What the heck is he trying to do with the pigeons?  What does traveling in an infinity pattern on a bicycle have to do with his original ideas?  What are the rules of this game that Hansen and Nash are always playing?  And how does 'avoiding the blonde' evolve into the non-competitive equiilibrium that challenges 150 years of economic theory? 
   THANKFULLY, though, the studio's web site gives a much deeper look at these issues, in a highly entertaining and provocative way.  If they ever get around to having an Oscar for best promotional/info site, they might want to look into that one's combination of educational, recreational resources, and aesthetic beauty.   Definitely one of the best of 2002, though in terms of playing madness to the hilt and getting us into the mind of the character, Memento's still your best bet.",Null,0,2,11 February 2002
Lord of War," Leaves you cold, but then maybe it ought to....
","I have been running 'Lord of War' through my head; cinematically, it promises to be a more interesting film than it ends up being. The first shot of the path of the bullet from start to bloody finish promises a stark look at the gun-running industry, and to a degree, there is some truth to it. However, I also wonder how much of the film is Hollywoodized. I kept on thinking that it felt like a Hollywood story of corrupt power like that of Tony Montana or Johnny Depp in 'Blow.'The strange thing about Cage's character is perhaps that he doesn't want to be a 'warlord;' he doesn't want an empire. He wants to be a great provider for his wife and family; tragically, he's more in love with his product than any human being. Leto does an awesome job as Cage's brother, Natali, a man who is as loving as he is insecure.The film is extremely well-written, and Cage does a great job of portraying his character sympathetically though certainly morally bankrupt. You do begin rooting for this guy to get away (well, at least I did) with his crimes. I wish I had walked out of the film with a greater sense of anger or passion about preventing gun violence: instead, I walked out feeling I had been hit with a cynical, bitter look at gun violence that didn't motivate me at all.There's a monologue I once read in college that talked about how 'the hand was made for the gun,' and not the other way around. I suppose if the film had delved more into our natural tendency towards gun violence and less towards the morality of selling arms, it might have delivered a stronger punch for me.",7,16,25,2 October 2005
Signs," Only Gibson makes this worth watching
","You know, I thought to myself that maybe I was wrong about M. Night Shyamalan after seeing the Sixth Sense the second time.  Once I paid attention to the little details, camerawork, lighting, set design, I realized he has a real touch for suspense, even if the plotting is a little naive and childish.  Then came Unbreakable, which again had a couple of cinematically interesting moments but ended with an awful plot twist. And now Signs.     I'm sorry, people: while the cinematography and camerawork are great, somebody needs to teach this guy how to write a good movie.  There were maybe one or two somewhat spooky moments, but the last 10 minutes just ruins it, with the idea of an alien invasion that just happens *SPOILER* to fail because 'some primitive towns found a way to beat them.' 
   What is this movie really about?  Faith?  You want to make a movie about faith in God, really MAKE IT!  God knows we could use it!  But don't have Mel realize his spiritual calling because *SPOILER* his wife was telling him before death to remember to hit the alien standing in his living room with a bat!   Two standout performances by Gibson and Phoenix (who make quite believable brothers), in spite of a limp-ass script, are the only things that make this film bearable.  I just hope somebody begins helping Shyamalan out with his scripts: he's got a great sense of timing, pacing, and dread, but his plots and scripts are those of a child with a bankroll.",Null,1,1,26 August 2002
Sweet and Lowdown," Short and Sweet
","Although these past few weeks have witnessed some great flicks, a lot of them tend to be on the rather long and heavy-handed side.  I've been avoiding Magnolia and the Green Mile out of fear of the effects of having my butt in the chair for that long.  Woody Allen's Sweet and Lowdown is a nice little change of pace, though nothing compared to Bullets Over Broadway. Just see it as a little story about how a second-rate musician finally finds his voice in his love for a woman without one.  Go for Sean Penn, who makes you love him even as he plays the most egotistical chauvinistic off-the-wall 'artist' we've seen since Melvin in As Good As It Gets.  You should specially go for Samantha Morton who makes a brilliant debut as Haddie, the mute.  Without one line, she'll make your heart melt.  Short and sweet. They certainly aren't making many like that these days...",Null,0,0,11 January 2000
Identity," A film conceived by Donald Kaufman...
","IDENTITY might seem like a normal slasher film from the commercials, but those who saw the preview might get an inclination that this is more than a mere motel slasher flick by the fact that (and this may be a SPOILER) four of the main characters come to realize they have the same birthday.  There is an odd connection to each one of the people who have come to this motel, and honestly, the film hinges upon your ability to suspend disbelief. However, if you're willing to accept the twist (and it's a lot easier to swallow than the mindf***k that was BASIC), the film will give you a very good time.  It's definitely derivative of some other films, but it's got its own merits as well, fine performances from John Cusack, Pruitt Taylor Vince, Ray Liotta, Clea Duvall, and Amanda Peet.  Think the Usual Suspects with a dash of Fight Club.  Or actually just remember the screenplay by Donald Kaufman in ADAPTATION...***.5",Null,0,0,28 April 2003
Amélie," Great film with a genius of a subplot
","I really enjoyed this film.  I mean it is an art house flick in its own bizarre style, but really the story is pure Hollywood: young girl goes around doing good to change her sad life until she finds love. However, there was one subplot in this film that I found absolutely brilliant and very memorable: the face in the torn photos.  This stone-faced shaven man had his picture taken all over instaphoto booths and then ripped his own pictures: why?  As they ask, is he afraid he will forget what he looks like?  Or some ghost haunting the subways and trains of Montmartre? The revelation about who this guy is and why he did what he did is so PERFECT, so damn genius, that it alone made me grin more than the rest of the film's magnificent acting, special FX, narration, and cinematography. I still haven't seen No Man's Land, but I doubt it had the wit and HOPE in a sense that this film displayed.  ****",Null,0,2,19 May 2002
The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King," If all's well that ends well, then ***
","I was disappointed in the Return of the King, because it returned me to the same problem I experienced in The Fellowship of the Ring.  'When is this film supposed to end?'  I asked myself that in the first and third volumes, but NOT in the second film which is now in my mind the best of the trilogy. Although the central battle here is incredible, and the effects stupendous, there is still something bloated about it in the end.  Too many characters, plot lines, and endings.  If the film had ended at the coronation in Gondor, I would have called it wonderful.  As it was, people were sighing in their seats.  It felt the same in the first film with the multiple wide angle shots and soaring score that then went back in for close ups and further action.  A fan of the books said, 'You can't expect them to wrap up this great quest so quickly.'  My reply is, 'Why not?'  Hitchcock told incredible stories, but he made sure to have quick and powerful endings.  Jackson's weak in that spot. Somehow, The Two Towers managed to avoid this temptation and told its stories in greater simplicity.
    I stopped being a fan of fantasy novels a while back, and I do wish that this film had given me back that love.  As it is, I was more fascinated by the heartstopping battles in The Last Samurai than what The Return of the King offered us.

Thirteen Days," Impressive history, just a tad too much Hollywood drama
","My history prof in high-school told us that during the missile crisis, he and his college friends were preparing for a nuclear war between the US and Russia.  I can't imagine that now: even though we countries all around have nuclear capabilities, and the US military stubbornly refuses to sign the Nuclear Test-Ban Treaty, being so eager to develop 'the next generation' of nuclear weapons,(one generation I think we can all agree requires an immediate abortion.) Roger Donaldson's Thirteen Days has definite flaws-  First, he should have killed the Costner family angle: Costner's character could have served as an illustrative link to the popular reaction to the crisis.  The moment he sees the line-up for confessions holds greater impact than any family scene.  2.  The music by Trevor Jones (composer of the Last of the Mohicans) at first brings up the tension, but after an hour or so, you're bored by its constant reminder of the importance of events.  With more silence or a gradual build-up, the score could have been more effective.  3.  There's no clear need for those b&w sequences- it really didn't serve a purpose. 4.What the film really needs at the end is a summation of where the central characters ended up- put a photo of the actor and real-life character up with a post-crisis bio.  (Hell, McNamara got us into Vietnam!) I applaud Thirteen Days because it treats history as a subject for drama, realizing that truth is stranger than fiction.  It also is a film that celebrates victory in peace not battles.  I think we'll soon be seeing the exact opposite with Pearl Harbor, which I fear will ignore our oppressive decision to ship Japanese Americans into concentration camps during the war.    Thirteen Days presents JFK and RFK as regular men in extreme circumstances, heroes only by way of heroic decision-making.  The supporting cast perform very credibly, though this is easier since the majority of audiences won't remember McNamara, Adlai Stevenson, Acheson, or LeMay. Regardless, the B&W TV broadcasts of JFK and Stevenson are very effective: people in my audience were applauding when Adlai said, 'I am prepared to wait for my answer until hell freezes over!'     Likewise, Donaldson brings great tension to the air&sea military sequences, combining newsreels, computer graphics, and action scenes.  For a film that visually often seemed to have a TV-movie feel, the U2 flights and Pearce conflicts rocked.  For a moment when McNamara (excellent acting) went against the Admiral on the blockade decisions, I felt like I was watching Hunt For Red October. I wonder if that's a problem of this film: this unique historical moment feels here like a hodgepodge of other movies: shades of Independence Day, (the coming attack, national speech, and preparation), Apollo 13 (how can we negotiate the solution to this crisis?), and JFK (the conspiracy of the military against the lone peaceful warrior.)  Admittedly, when you give a more Hollywood feel to history, you might add to the overall resonance, but do you lose credibility in exchange?     I'd nominate David Self for best Adapted Screenplay, taking the White House tapes and making for totally engrossing dialogues.  The film effectively impresses the importance of the decisions and influence of every man in the Oval Office those thirteen days.  Hopefully, our new president would also do more than nod to the judgment of Old Guard military solutions and look to his own good will, if faced with such a crisis in the years to come.  ***",Null,0,0,13 January 2001
"O Brother, Where Art Thou?"," They had a plot, but no rehearsals...
","I loved the first half-hour or so, the strange interruptions of the threesome's getaway: the arrivals of Orpheus as a black guitar player, mobsters, a blind prophet on the rails, baptizers, and sirens.  Their journey hits a sweet, strange spot that seems uniquely American at first. The film turned sour right about when Big Dan hit Delmar across the face: the totally random, flat-footed slapstick reduced Goodman to a caricature rather than any kind of character.  At least in Barton Fink, we got a chance to see Goodman's salesman evolve.  Here, he was all big and loud, just like Charles Durning and John Turturro, at times incomprehensible.The plot festers very quickly here and turns into a series of small episodes and effects.  Gags range from strange and wonderful to repulsive. Hanging Negroes is not funny; r-u-n-n-o-f-t works but once; wearing blackface at a Klan rally is a low comic blow; being a 'friend of the midget' gets old quick; torch-lit mobs leading men to their electrocution are not causes for hilarity either, though maybe under Dubya that'll change. The Coens pushed the envelope off the table this time.On the other hand, Tim Blake Nelson and George Clooney both are surprisingly affable: their reactions to the sirens, and the morning after, are just precious.  Also, I loved seeing Clooney's interactions with his daughters and Holly Hunter: 'He's BONAFHYDE!  HE'S A SUITOR!  What are you?' 'Well, AH ahm the Pater Familius!'  Anybody who can say that without breaking up deserves applause.The cinematography, as everyone has indicated, is gorgeous, evoking a feel of some bygone 'golden' age.  However, at the same time, this America seems more primitive, lewd: maybe I should head down to Natchez and Mississippi and see how much things have changed over the years.  Often I felt like O Brother was a lot like some of the old musicals: the screenplay and characters were weak moments and filler for great musical moments. The wet brunette sirens were seductive 'baaaaaaa-beh,' the chain gang was powerful, 'I'll Fly Away' a graceful moment, and even for a guy who would never listen to country, 'I Am A Man of Sorrow' jammed.  Actually, this film seems less a remake of The Oddysey than a tribute to John Landis' Blues Brothers with an extra southern good ol' boy kick thrown in.  We could use more celebrity musician appearances or a good-old fashioned chase scene, and the film would lift off.Just like last year's Sweet and Lowdown, this is a minor film by master filmmakers.  Some nights, I go in expecting a good time, and I got just that here: some lovely scenery, jokes, suspense, and fine, fine music.  If you want to feel the ground quaking after the lights go up, go see Quills...",Null,0,0,5 January 2001
