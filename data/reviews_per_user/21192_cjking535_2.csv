The Hunger Games: Mockingjay - Part 1," Disappointing Set-up and Boring Exposition Movie
","This is a waste of time if you are looking into watching this film. It is basically 2 hours of boring exposition that does not satisfy or pay off in the end of the movie. The shallow acting from almost all characters certainly does not help its case, when its elapsed time of action is less than the time of JLaw making weird faces on screen. This movie was an obvious cash-grab that had no purpose other than to make money and set up a finale to the Hunger Games movies. In the end(don't worry I'm not giving out spoilers), the movie does not pay off what it was trying to build up for the whole movie. The whole plot kind of repeated and then becomes redundant towards the middle. The climax is not exciting, because we are too busy seeing Katniss crying, while the real action going on is not being showed on screen. I rated this movie so high, because I am excited for Part 2, and hopefully it will not be filled with the boring garbage that made this film inferior.",7,8,25,22 November 2014
Interstellar," Changes the Way You Think
","No movie experience will ever be the same after you see Interstellar. This is yet another masterpiece by Christopher Nolan and takes on a thrilling and unforgettable ride. The cast is excellent, and Matthew McConaughey was incredible. And Anne Hathaway, Michael Caine, and Matt Damon were spectacular to support McConaughey. At the beginning, it starts of a little bit slow, but it kind of builds up the world and the life on Earth during the blight. This build certainly pays off, when McConaughey and Hathaway embark on a journey that changes the game for science fiction thrillers forever. Once they go into space, the movie kicks into high gear, and never slows down until the very end. The way Nolan jumps back in between earth and space is unmatched, and the creative plot even gives Inception a run for its money. The ending portion of the film was shocking and immersed you into this world. Nolan crafts the film and tinkers with topics that no one has ever dared to go into before. Not to mention that spectacle of digital effects that makes you feel like you are in space. The science behind it is genius, and Nolan strikes again in terms of making a mind-blowing film.",8,2,7,22 November 2014
