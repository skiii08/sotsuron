The Blair Witch Project," The most frightening movie I have ever seen.
","I don't watch tv. As such, I had only the website (www.blairwitch.com) and a couple of recommendations to see the movie to go on, and thankfully so. As such, I took the movie as fact all the way through. As a result, it scared the drek out of me.A great example of how great ideas, not huge budgets and special effects, are what make great movies. BWP now takes its place with The Exorcist and Prince of Darkness as the only movies to truly scare the crap out of me.",8,1,1,28 July 1999
Detroit Rock City," YES! ROCK!
","To hell with the critics, this movie was hilarious! I suppose the older crowd (except for some people who were teens in this era) will probably hate it though.My favorite line was Christine saying 'Disco's so big right now, I wouldn't be surprised if Kiss made a disco song!'",8,0,2,13 August 1999
Sweet and Lowdown," What does it really take to be great?
","I heard lukewarm reviews about this movie, but I thought it was one of the best movies to come out in '99. Allen seems to have lazily spun a tale of a minor player in the history of music. Emmett Ray is the stuff of legend, he turned up on the scene, cut some sides, and little is known for sure about his life. Allen fills in the blanks though.One of the things I liked most was the Django Reinhardt thread, that weaved its way through the whole movie, and made for some of the funniest bits. I won't ruin the movie by talking about it here.But the movie did seem to be sort of spinning its tires, without a real point, until the last 10 minutes. In that time it goes from being a mildly funny showcase for some GREAT! jazz music to being a statement about what it sometimes takes to be a great artist, and the often tragic irony of this truth.Thinking about it now, Allen also sort of parodies the documentary format here, in that all the 'modern' people on camera talking about Emmett Ray really know very little about his life, and the biographical sequences make the viewer the insider, so to speak.",9,0,0,17 March 2000
The Sixth Sense," They should've let Blair Witch die down first
","First: WHY DIDN'T THIS KID AUDITION FOR ANAKIN?!Outstanding movie on all fronts. My only complaint is that it occasionally dragged, and then only once or twice for a minute or two.Excellent acting all around, and some excellent twists as well.",8,0,0,7 August 1999
"O Brother, Where Art Thou?"," The Coens' best film ever.
","Having gone through a horrid dry spell for good movies recently, which hit rock bottom when I found myself, out of desperation, watching Vertical Limit, the Coen Brothers have come through once again, and have they ever.Let me start by stating that I'm biased - about 4 months ago I fell in with a few fellows playing old time music, so it's been on my mind lately. And what made this movie for me was definitely the music: The obvious hit is the Soggy Bottom Boys doing I Am A Man of Constant Sorrow, but the high points for me were the baptists singing Down to the River to Pray, The Siren Song, and Ralph Stanley providing the voice for O Death. The presence of Jerry Douglas on dobro in a few scenes ain't too shabby neither. For a fan of old time/mountain music, this movie is like a shot of heroin - you will be back again and again.But even without the music, the movie features that Coen Bros touch, a little bit odd without descending into overt weirdness, and somehow true to life - there were some truly hilarious moments, and moments of such beauty that I was shaken.I have only one complaint that I can make about this movie, and it's a petty one: during some of the musical numbers, you could clearly hear instruments being played that weren't being 'lipsynced' onscreen, and sometimes the lipsyncing was a bit off. However, that didn't bother me enough to keep me from giving this flick a well-deserved 10.",10,0,0,13 January 2001
