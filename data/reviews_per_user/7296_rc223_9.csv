The Blair Witch Project," The best horror movie for decades.
","Obviously, it's difficult to say anything original about THE BLAIR WITCH PROJECT but two things impressed me. First, in horror movies victims are often portrayed as bringing their fate upon themselves (like the promiscuous teens in FRIDAY THE 13TH) but the trio in this film are just having some fun and generate a lot of sympathy. Secondly, the final image and the way this only works if you're paying attention during the initial lighthearted phase.Absolutely brilliant: 10/10",Null,0,1,28 October 1999
Antz," A lot of fun.
","Antz is the surprise of the year. A well written fantasy with a strong story, terrific insect anthropomorphism and, of course, drop-dead animation. (9/10)",8,0,0,14 December 1998
Alien: Resurrection," Surprisingly poor, even for an unecessary sequal
","Alien was heart-stopping, Aliens: breath-taking, Alien 3: a brave failure. Alien 4 is a mess, a mess with great CGI visuals but still a mess. Ripley comes back from the dead (Weaver again the best thing in the film) and starts acting strangely. The aliens themselves disappear half way through! Poor script, dodgy acting, disappointing action.",Null,1,2,11 September 1998
The Mummy," More like a remake of Abbott and Costello Meet the Mummy.
",I think the problem here is that Sommers lacks either the balls or the talent to make an action-adventure with comedy bits and great special effects like Raiders of the Lost Ark and has made a spoof of the 1930s films instead. And you should try seeing those expensive effects on a 12' portable TV.,Null,0,0,14 February 2000
American History X," Like a cross between Angels with Dirty Faces and Romper Stomper.
","Tony Kaye's background is in advertising and it shows. Even the ubiquitous shower rape scene looks like a shampoo commercial. Norton is magnificent as the skinhead turned liberal although his conversion is too easy for comfort. If all racist beliefs were so flimsy, there'd be nothing to worry about. Wants so badly to be a proper grown up film it's a shame it's so lightweight.(6/10)",6,0,1,29 March 1999
Saving Private Ryan," an awesome acheivement from a master film-maker
","There is nothing new in Saving Private Ryan but the standard war-is-hell details are so well done they seem to have been re-invented for this movie. In lesser hands: stereotypes, cliches and schmaltz. In Spielberg's: well-rounded characters, genuine drama and real emotions. The only problem is that the opening scene is so real and terrifying that it upstages the rest of the story. (10/10 - easily).",10,0,0,21 September 1998
Pulp Fiction," Quite simply, the best movie ever made
","I find something new to like about Pulp Fiction every time I see it. Shocking, intelligent, exciting, hilarious and oddly though-provoking. Best bit: Jackson's Bible quote, Harvey Keitel, the Gimp or is it the watch dream? Two hours of highlights.",10,0,1,11 September 1998
"Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels"," So much fun, you just have to like it.
","A lot of Brit thrillers have come unstuck trying to imitate Reservoir Dogs but this is a fast, violent and funny thriller with excellent characterization and believable dialogue. Great fun.",7,0,1,11 September 1998
Paths of Glory," A 1950s Saving Private Ryan
",A powerful anti-war film. There's nothing like WWI for angry movie making but that doesn't mean it's easy. Douglas is superb and Menjou thoroughly hate-worthy. Terrific battle scenes. (9/10),9,0,1,13 November 1998
