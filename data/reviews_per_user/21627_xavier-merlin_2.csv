The Monuments Men," Big disappointment
","I already had not so high hopes of seeing a good movie when I had seen several reviews of people but still I wanted to see the movie being that the story in itself is quite interesting enough. Sadly, I got it wrong, the movie destroyed the story altogether. After several embarrassing yawning around 45 minutes into the movie with little action going on, unbelievable silly and pointless conversations, horrible bad acting we decided to leave the theater. Even the supposedly jokes are missing their effect. As far as I know my wife never left the theater before the end of a movie, so this movie is really that bad(!). A real disaster. My advice: go see another movie, this is a complete waste of time and a disgrace for the men involved who did the real job saving the 'monuments' way back then ...",1,5,9,25 March 2014
Star Wars: Episode VII - The Force Awakens," Stupidity beyond the pale
","Every hardcore star wars fan knows for sure that 'the empire strikes back' episode delivered the goods. The movie makers should by now have learned (they had plenty of time didn't they?) that people do love a good story and character development. None of this happened, even not in a galaxy far far away ... be it episode 4,6, 1-3 and now seven ...With this latest episode everything went as bad as it could get, everything went completely down the drain. If you have seen the first star wars, episode IV in 1977 (year of the punk and the year Elvis died) then you are in for a big disappointment. Episode VII is not a sequel in the saga, it is a bad episode IV remake but with good visuals.In short the whole move was a roller coaster of events without actual content. The imagery was far more important than everything else being a good story and proper character development. Well, the imagery was stunning, except for the CGI character 'Snoke' which looked more like a new but clearly ridiculous over sized 'Voldemort character' or something similar and was hilarious, not at all scary (as it is supposed to be). The moment the whole movie went without force was when the new villain, 'Kylo Ren', took his mask off, the force never woke up again: it went asleep for the rest of the movie. The actor, Adam Driver, was completely miscast for this role, 'he looks like some teenager Star Wars fan boy' The supposedly cliffhanger of the movie showing some seconds of Luke at the end revealed it all: 'the force has left the building' and for good this time. More of this utter nonsense is coming your way. My advice, stay far far away from more force farce episodes unless you want to be fooled over and over again ...Sorry Disney, please do stick to cartoons, respect the TRUE force and its huge fan base",3,28,39,30 December 2015
