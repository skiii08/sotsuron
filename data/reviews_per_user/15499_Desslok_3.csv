The Blair Witch Project," Oh the humanity!
","First - I've been traumatized by every horror movie in the book. From Friday the 13th to Psycho, I've seen 'em all. That's why I was suckered into seeing this stinking pile of refuse laughingly called a movie. I was intrigued by the press the movie was getting, and it sounded like an interesting premise.An hour and a half later, I was disgusted that I had paid 7 bucks for this train wreck. No - even worse, I had paid the highest price of them all: two hours of my life savagely ripped away from me that I will never get back.Somewhere along the line, film goes have mistaken two hours of people on screen swearing at each other at the top of their lungs as character development, and running around in the woods non-stop as a plot. Half an hour of set up - and then an hour and a half of nothing - and then, the shock ending - where nothing happens. Have people's sensibilities been degraded by modern culture that they find this enjoyable?
No monster/witch at the end. No pay-off whatsoever, at all - zip, nada, zilch! Now, I by no means have to have a full blown million dollar CGI special effect to scare the ever-lovin crap out of me. In fact, less is more - the most scary movies I can think of are where they never show, they simply suggest. However, the viewer needs **SOMETHING** to hang their hats on - a fleeting shadow of a great white shark under the water, a dripping claw on the Nostromo, a long shot of a man in a black jumpsuit in Haddonfield - something. What does the Blair Witch do? Make scary noises in the woods at night. Ooooh - hold me! Oh - and don't forget about those scary sticks and piles of rocks? I find scarier things in my breakfast cereal.
Horror movies are frequently known for their plots - or lack of. Most of the time, this is true - a generic slasher flick often is a string of events loosely held together by a vague narrative. In the right mood, this can be even kind of fun, in a cheesy sort of way. However, the most cookie cutter Friday the 13th movie has more going for it in the coherent narrative department than this amateur attempt does. I was hoping for something more than 'Kids go into the woods to make a movie, kids get lost, kids run around for several days, kids die.' What the hell is that?!?After seeing the film, the next day at work  I was going off about it - and was instructed to go to blairwitch.com for the full back story. Surprise, surprise - guess what! There was indeed a full history on the legend, write ups on the characters, and more background information that I could hope for. If the creative (sic) team did all this work, then WHY THE HELL WAS NONE OF IT IN THE MOVIE?!?!? A viewer should not have to go do homework to get the complete story.Illogical plot devices abound. They get lost in the wood because 'I threw the f'ing map away, you stupid &!^@#^' - a plot crowbar if I've ever seen one. Or how about ignoring common sense - even I, a city boy to the core, would know that if you follow a river downstream, you will eventually wind up SOMEWHERE! Anywhere - a road, a farm, the freakin' ocean, for god sake! Yet this simple concept eludes the characters (and I use the term 'characters' very loosely.). Or - the best one yet: if I woke up in the middle of the night, with the forces of evil shaking my tent like Lucifer himself was outside, I sure as hell would **NOT** grab my camera and keep filming as I ran. I would haul ass as fast as my legs would go - buck naked if need be. Yet they have the presence of mind to keep the film rolling? And what about that survival book that the filmmakers take great pains to point out in the beginning of the movie - and yet never shows up again?(Note to the creative (sic) team - next time, don't just make the movie up as you go. Take some time and formulate a dialogue and a story - maybe even write a script. I know it's a bold concept in this modern day and age, but your viewers will thank you for it.)For those of you who seem to have forgotten what a *truly* frightening and/or movie is, let me bring you up to speed on required viewing: Exorcist (the creepiest movie ever), Jaws (a film that traumatizes an ENTIRE generation of people, keeping them off the beach for years, has something going for it), The Texas Chainsaw Massacre, The Shining, Halloween, Night of the Living Dead, Ring (a classic Japanese horror film proving that terror is not exclusive to North America), Alien, and of course the granddaddy of them all - Psycho. Of course, all the sad people who have bought into the hype of the movie will call me closed minded and an idiot for not falling to my knees and worshipping this movie. Fine - whatever. I'll just be over here watchingBottom line - do not be suckered in by this movie. Go rent a good horror flick instead - you'll thank me for it.",Null,3,6,10 June 2001
The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring," Long and boring to the non-Tolken fan
","Very little character development at all - for ANY of the characters, aside from a brief mention of the deposed king (but even that isn't touched on). Illogical developments in plot and story run rampant though out - simple things like the horsemen that cant catch four midgets on foot. What did they give then a head start to keep things fair? An even worse sin - no ending to the movie. Even the Empire Strikes Back and Back to the Future had self contained stories, despite ending on a cliffhanger. Here the movie just stops. Bang, full on dead stop. No resolution, no 'to be continued', nothing.And the movie was too damn long. Trim out the fat and give me a two hour version please.",1,2,5,27 December 2001
The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring," Too long and too over-rated!
","First - I've never read the books. I've not seen the animated versions. I'm just about as much as a newbie as you can get. So - how does it stack up?The good: I was worried about Christopher Lee doing the more physical aspects of his roll in Star Wars. Seeing him swing that big stick of his around beating up Gandolf put my mind at ease. He is going to rock so hard in Attack of the Clones.I did like the look of the universe. The strangely gothic look of the towers and so on - kudos to the set designer.The bad: I hated some of the fight scenes - A great majority of them were far too close to the action, making it impossible to see what was going on. Give me a wide shot of the action and let the choreography speak for itself. Learn from the HK directors and don't try and punch up your fight with funky camera work.Paper thin characters - Not a single one of the characters has any back story at all. There is zero insight to what makes these characters tick - well, aside from the 'Ring is Bad!' motivation. Why are any of them on this dangerous quest? Why were those two food obsessed hobbits along? Same thing with Sallah - he really didn't do anything to further the plot. Or Frodo's eavesdropping friend - did he even have any lines in the movie? Or . . . . well, you get the idea. The only one who gets fleshed out was the human guy from the tavern - there's something about a deposed king mentioned, but it's never fully explored.I'm given to understand that the books round out the characters a whole lot more. Pity none of this made it over to the screen. I wish they could have trimmed some of the encounters and fleshed these folks out (The whole bit with the lady in white who turned into a scary person for a second could have easily been dropped in favor of character development. It didn't seem to move the plot along, simply telling us information that we already knew. 'Ring is bad - must destroy it, else evil wins.')I need a scorecard to tell everything apart - This isn't so much a problem with the way the movie was constructed, but more of a problem I had keeping up. Letssee, with dozens of characters introduced at lightning speed, plus a whole travel-log of locations, I found myself lost at times. There was Arrow Guy, Sallah, the Food Obsessed Comic Relief (or the gay hobbit couple), the Guy from the Tavern, and the Guy That Went Nuts at the End. Oh - and Frodo and Gandolf. Towards the end, Guy That Went Nuts and Guy From The Tavern were hard to keep apart. When he was attacking Frodo, I keep wondering 'ok, now which one was he again?'
Strange plot developments - So, you have the Scary Black Horsemen and their initial chase of the hobbits towards the start of the movie. The good guys leap onto a raft and push off from shore. Here they are - not more than eight feet away, and the rider doesn't get them. What - your horse is afraid of water? The guy is under orders to get that ring at all costs and is afraid of getting his shoes wet?Or the sworn protectors of the MacGuffin and it's owner letting them wander off by themselves to infiltrate the Tower of Evil? Hello - they'll get about three miles before both of them are killed and the MacGuffin falls into the hands of the bad guys. You know - end of the world? Game over?Leaving the decision to go over the mountains or through the Caves of Death(tm) to the most inexperienced person in the party? What the hell was Gandolf thinking?If the ring makes everyone who wears it invisible, then why didn't Saron pull a disappearing act when he wore it?What exactly does the ring do? If it falls into the bad guy's hands, he rules the land with a thousand years of darkness - that much I got. But what does it do? Does it channel the wrath of god allowing Saron to slay his enemies? Mind control? Is it plans to a Death Star?Where did the Scary Black Horsemen go? The start out as an foe with no pity, no fear and no remorse that will not stop - ever - until the good guys are dead. Then they just kind of seem to fall of the map after the encounter in the ruins and that river. It's kind of like forgetting about Darth Vader half way through Star Wars.The bottom line: I almost enjoyed myself, but it was definitely designed for fans of the book, not Joe Six-Pack. It was certainly no Lost in Space or Batman and Robin to be sure. But is it the best movie ever? Hardly - Citizen Kane, Casablanca, Gone with the Wind, The Godfather, Lawrence of Arabia, and Star Wars still all trump the movie - but it was a adequate waste of three hours.
(But please, of please make the next one just a bit shorter. My ass was so sore after the massive marathon in the theater seat.)",1,2,6,9 March 2002
