Come and See," Thought-provoking anti-war film.
","Mind-blowing and wonderfully done. This thought-provoking film presents us with brutal and vivid images that take us into the violent reality of war. The viewer can nothing but witness a young man's experience in a world of destruction and despair, its loss of humanity in the face of the horror and trauma of war. 'Come and see' is a mind-blowing visual, but most importantly, emotional experience, a play on human psychology that redefines what one accepts as believable. It gives us insight on the absurdity of war: the ingenuity that one can put in destruction, the pleasure that one can take in imposing suffering, the dehumanization of a fellow human being along with the trivialization of death. The brutality of these images pushes us to question ourselves: how could one possibly believe that this quest for power, war, is worth the relinquishment of our humanity? How can one possibly justify the atrocities of war? And how can we today, everyday, go on with our lives ignoring on-going similar atrocities?",8,1,1,11 December 2011
Hero," Will leave you breathless.
","It's an incredibly beautiful movie, an open door to a better appreciation of Chinese cinema. Each scene, each scenery, each new landscape the movie presents us with is a new journey. The decors and costumes are astonishing. The movie itself is brilliantly written, brilliantly constructed, and brilliantly made 'Hero' is simply brilliant. 'There's nothing politic about this movie ... it's total cinema' And total cinema it is indeed! Whether it's politic-related or nor, whether it reflects political views or not, it's a true lesson of wisdom, an eye-opener. It's visual candy!!! I'd watch it again and again, it is truly wonderful!",Null,0,0,13 December 2011
