The Devil's Advocate," and they say god works in mysterious ways
","I enjoyed this movie because I felt as if it was a great representation of what can happen when we don't pay attention in matters of life.  The fallouts from being too focused and from not knowing how to trust yourself and other people are things that this movie covers.Much of the content of this movie is focused on good and evil and it is noticeable that good and evil are always at odds with each other.  Them being at odds with with each other has a direct impact on humans as humans often find themselves caught right in the middle of good and evil's game.
What can also be found inside this movie are aspects of the supernatural realm of life and what can happen when one either doesn't put enough faith in this realm or they put too much.  Either way, white but moreso the black side of magic is present in this movie.  Overall, I must say that Al Pacino, Keeano Reeves, and the rest of the crew do a fine job with the Devil's Advocate.",Null,0,1,2 April 2004
The Blair Witch Project," I will never look at a forest in the same way
","Man, this movie scared me!  I have seen it a few times and I always become scared.  Probably its because I live in the country and am surrounded by forest and see how ez it could be for someone or a group of people to use the/my forest as a haven to conduct witchcraft.  I would recommend this movie to anyone who gets freaked out ezalee.",Null,0,1,2 October 2003
Groundhog Day," Bill Murray is great
",This movie is about a guy who's conceit and self-absorbness has him repeating his life over until he can get it right.  It is based around Ground hog day and is funny.  Andie McDowel is also in the movie and plays a real sweetheart.,Null,0,0,2 October 2003
A Beautiful Mind," WoW...I am truely touched
","I was recommended this film and the end result after I viewed it is that I am forever grateful.  This film is based on a true story and is about the life of John Forbes Nash, a renouned mathematician professor at Princeton University.  What makes John's life so remarkable is not only all of his awards, including the Nobel Peace Prize; but his inability and then ability to cope with his mental illness.  I too would recommend this movie to anyone interested in learning more about mental illness.",Null,0,1,30 September 2003
Donnie Darko," this movie has similar content as beautiful mind

If you are interested in learning more about mental illness, this movie is appropriate.",Null,0,0,2 October 2003
