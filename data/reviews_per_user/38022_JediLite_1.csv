Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," Shutup and enjoy the movie.
","I, too, am irritated by countless critics and 'Star Wars Fans' that have picked this movie apart, sighting racial undertones, bad story, and bad acting, to name a few. There is a real world parallel here......Anything, I think of a politician in particular, under such scrutiny, is bound to have flaws in him/her, or IT, as is the case with TPM. This new Star Wars movie had almost unlimited expectations, and as a result, almost unlimited scrutiny. Sure, the movie isn't flawless, but so many people, it seems, went to see this movie for the express purpose of finding something wrong with it. George Lucas thought of, wrote, directed, and paid for this movie himself. It is HIS vision, and HIS story to tell as he sees fit. To look so hard for fault with his story is rude. How many kids, after hearing a scary story in the dark at summer camp, dissect the story, and analyze what they think might have made it better, or look for hidden meaning where there is none? Certainly none that I went to camp with. I applaud Mr. Lucas for sticking to his ideal of making movies for people that like to watch movies, I certainly enjoyed this movie, and will be among the first in line to see the next. Sadly, I'll probably be in line right behind those same people....waiting to dissect, analyze, and be the first to find something wrong with someone else's story. To those people: THESE MOVIES ARE NOT MADE FOR YOU!! STICK TO THE ACADEMY AWARDS SECTION OF YOUR LOCAL VIDEO STORE IF YOU WANT CRITIC-FRIENDLY MOVIES. LET THE REST OF US ENJOY THE STAR WARS STORY.",Null,6,8,9 June 1999
