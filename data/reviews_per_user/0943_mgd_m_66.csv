Ford v Ferrari," Far less than I expected
","It's not a bad movie, but it's quite flat and nothing that you haven't seen before. Lacks in epic qualities and in depicting the true dangers of racing in those days. Forgettable soundtrack. See 'Rush' for a far better outcome on all these aspects. The worst flaw is in the way they filmed the circuit De La Sarthe: first, there's no iconic shot on the Mulsanne straight, that's something I don't understand; secondly, they failed in showing what a grind was driving at 300kmh for three minutes, with a couple of very hard brakes. Also, they didn't show the slower classes of cars racing simultaneously, that were a true hazard. Overall, little remains for racing enthusiasts.",5,22,48,20 November 2019
Moneyball," Great surprise
","I usually do not like movies designed for broad audiences, but man, this was great.Writing and direction are fantastic, as in 'how to make a great movie out of almost nothing'. The story is quite your average sports quest for success, but the dynamics of the events, the attention for every single scene, the depth of Brad Pitt's character, several great lines, some clever humor, and the fantastic use of noise and silence in the closing scenes, all these things contribute to push this movie well above average. Photography is beautiful. Acting is fantastic, Brad Pitt could still act and delivered a great performance. Same for Hoffman and Jonas Hill.Definitely recommended.",8,5,6,6 April 2019
First Man," A bit boring, but a must-see anyway
","Interesting movie, perfect from a technical and aesthetical standpoint. Chazelle finally gives us new shots compared to the ones we have seen in the last 40 years about rockets and ships. The movie is good in the fact it chooses to tell more about a grief than a moon landing. Is good in that many things are told in a different way, such as the risks the astronauts were facing, the first-person shots, the cuts eliminating many obvious, well-known sequences. The ending is very good, and well-executed. The music is a masterpiece, one of the best themes ever heard, epic and tragic at the same time.But, we all know how it went, and all these new takes and angles can't overcome it. Overall, it's a bit boring.
Anyway, I strongly recommend it to any movie buff.",6,1,2,30 January 2019
Captain Phillips," Entertaining take on real-life drama
","The great risk for this movie (based on a true story) was to be overly grim and rough on the audience. The potential for two hours of anguish, nightmare and psychological torture was there. Instead, Greengrass is very good in balancing drama, action and thrill, also with the great merit of humanizing the pirates (victims themselves) and focusing on the relation between them and Tom Hanks.
Hanks delivers his usual deep and friendly interpretation, and he's a great part of the success of this movie.
Overall, two hours of action and thrill that will keep you entertained.",6,0,0,27 February 2019
3:10 to Yuma," I enjoyed it a lot
","I didn't know what to expect, because I didn't watch the original film. It's a very good story about valor and honor. I liked a lot the strange bunch that takes the journey, and all the encounters they have: the movie does a great job in making you feel how wild the west was. It was enjoyable from the start, but it's in the last 10 minutes that it gains all of its value. The ending is by far the best part, I strongly disagree with those who didn't like it. I think that if somebody didn't liked it, was probably following a preconcieved path about how characters should behave and how the movie should end. Instead, the power of this story is all in the possibility of change.Russel Crowe is outstanding. I don't like him much usually because I think he seems always out of place in every movie he does, but this role really fits him perfectly, and he acted great.That being said, Christian Bale is the main reason of the success of this movie, and by far the main reason to watch it. I don't know how he does it, but he turns every role he takes into gold.",7,2,3,19 April 2019
The Equalizer," Crescendo
","First act: the plot has potential, it's a bit slow, but let's see how it develops.
Second act: the villain is interesting, but Denzel is some kind of supernatural force, I don't buy that. I think this is the umpteenth silly action movie.
Third act: ok, I get your point. The hyperbole is so clear and so fun now, that I like it. I like the character, who fully shows himself for what he is. I like the 'funny' killings, and the bold lines.This movie is a linear crescendo, and I think you'll get rewarded if you have patience.
My rating is some kind of average between the three acts.",6,1,2,14 April 2019
It," It's not easy to make a movie from King's masterpiece
","The effort is there, the production is good, but the direction is so poor and non-scary that the whole movie crumbles. Every single 'scary' scene is lazy and dull, and brings that awful, millennial, 'you should be scared' flavour. Pennywise himself has something wrong in his look, I'd say he's cutesy and stupid, not scary. He runs squirming, and that's supposed to be creepy but it's absolutely not, so that it comes out just as an unnecessary and clumsy vfx. The worst thing about Pennywise is that being these scenes so lazily directed, when he unmistakeably fails to catch the kids he just seems totally unharming.The movie starts the wrong way, with Georgie who is unreasonably amused by a clown with a creepy face. Right there, you know that the director will be forcing the scare all the time.'It' fails to deliver that truly nightmarish atmosphere that was so strong in the book, the eerie deaths and missing kids.Even the real-word dramas and some characters are quite poorly depicted, particularly Bev's abusive father and Eddie.Overall, It ends up more like a kids movie than a horror movie. I'm surprised by the metacritic score.Furthermore, offsetting the year from the fifties to the eighties was a huge mistake. The fifties were much harder on the kids than the eighties, family dramas were probably too, and characters like Bowers would have been much more menacing.Lastly, I really don't understand why they cut the whole 27-years-later setting. I guess it's reserved for the second movie, but they should have told the two stories at the same time, just like in the book. A temporary ending (like those in Star Wars etc) would have made both chapters more interesting.3.5 stars for me.",4,2,6,15 June 2019
Alien: Resurrection," Not that bad, give it a shot
","I watched it a second time after 20 years. It's absolutely not bad as some say. I much appreciated the slight 'grotesque' tone the director applied to the movie, something in the Terry Gilliam range (over the top acting, closeups, weird scenography, and comic book-style characters). Obviously the plot is not that original (but which Alien movie has an original plot?) and obviously the whole thing of the resurrection is a laughable device to sell one more movie; but as a movie in itself, it's enjoyable.",7,0,0,17 November 2019
The Babadook," Just terrible
","I don't want to spoil anything, but I can say that you will not find in The Babadook what you expect. It's just a trivial, mundane story.
The main character arc is totally forced and unwarranted. It's awfully bad writing. The ending was terrible.
I regret watching it.",2,2,7,23 August 2019
Us," Awful
","Peele is a good director, but in Us he overplayed his hand.He went too artsy, with some supposedly beautiful sequences on the notes of some carefully chosen music.He went too abstract, since the whole movie is over the top and allegoric, with a surreal atmosphere and some mild humor.Meanwhile, he totally forgot to create suspence and keep the audience entertained. The movie is boring, and the plot makes no sense.Lastly, there's a huge plot hole in the final twist, as hundreds of reviews state here. It's just... wrong. The worst thing is that, despite making no sense, for some reason you could see the twist coming at least 30 minutes ahead.",2,2,3,25 August 2019
Knives Out," Great movie
","If you are suspicious of high ratings these days as I am, go see my ratings, I do not praise a movie easly. This is perhaps the best movie of the year. Its horizon is extremely narrow, it's just a whodunnit with a hint of immigration themes, but it's perfectly executed. It's grotesque, with a couple of funny moments and tongue in cheek humor. Flawless acting by a great cast, beautifully directed in this over-the-top story. Lots of twists. Utterly satisfying.",8,2,4,7 December 2019
The Secret in Their Eyes," Please stop
","Please stop praising mediocre movies. This one was slow, dull, unfocused and forced for at least 90 minutes of bad direction, bad humor, pretentious emotional depth (that wasn't so deep) and plastic characters. Just the ending was a bit better, because of a couple of twists. But this is not good cinema at all.",5,4,14,18 August 2019
The Irishman," Meh
","Great production, flawless direction, nice ending and all. You don't expect less from Scorsese. But I guess all these 10/10 are out of love for Martin, Al and De Niro, since the movie itself is not that outstanding. With The Departed Scorsese breathed new life in the genre. Shutter Island is an absolute masterpiece, from any point of view. The Wolf of Wall Street another masterpiece, and one of the funniest movies ever. Now The Irishman is some kind of a vintage flavor, a farewell to a period when everybody was doing films about mobsters, and Scorsese and De Niro were doing the best ones. But as I said, this doesn't stand out on an historical scale - because that's what Scorsese got us used to.",6,2,6,30 November 2019
Molly's Game," Entertainment, style and great acting
","Surely an entertaining watch. Stylistically speaking, the fast pace, several cuts to different moments in the timeline, sharp dialogues and abundant voiceover with witty comments put this movie firmly in the top tier of contemporary biopics. The plot is quite compelling. The moral subtext is very interesting, and so are the psychological aspects of the relationship with her father. Overall, the direction is very good.
That being said, this movie is 90% Chastain, in her best interpretation to date. She's sharp, believable, and incredibly fascinating in her character's shoes.On a less positive note, I have the strong feeling that this movie goes too far in glorifying Molly Bloom. But as a movie in itself, it's good; good in a way you see less and less these days.",7,2,2,13 April 2019
The Way Back," Missed opportunity
","The first two-thirds of the movie are dull, with pedestrian dialogues, toned-down emotions, and all the scenes where the story implies action inexplicably cut.It's better in the third act, when the emotional toll is ripe, but that doesn't saves it as a movie overall.Ed Harris is great as usual, Farrell is very good, the others not so much.",5,0,1,14 July 2019
The Doors," Average
","Not bad as JFK, but not an outstanding movie. The linear and rather dull narration is quite dated, but this is a product of the nineties.
The psychedelic scenes are good, they're not forced or unpleasent.
Average overall.",6,0,1,10 January 2020
The Town," Copy and paste
","Movies directed by Affleck seem carbon copies of other movies. I don't know how he can do that.
Here are some tropes you'll find in the movie: the young gang from the neighborhood; the love/hate relationship between the protagonist and his thug friend; the love story between him and the unsuspecting girl, but oh, he wants to tell her the truth; the badass cop; the sad finale, where his friends die.",5,2,8,16 March 2019
Interstellar," A masterpiece with flaws that doesn't age well
","While the story and the visuals are outstanding, at the third or fourth view I can better understand the flaws that I noticed from the start. After all, the plot is quite simple, and the dialogues are irritantingly obvious and full of exposition. So, once you get accustomed to the wow-moments, little remains aside some very good eye-candy. Nolan is clearly the most overvalued director of this time. He's a visionary, but not a good writer or director. At the end of the day, Interstellar is a masterpiece in his concept and will forever retain an history-making value, but it's not that good cinematographically speaking. 6.5 stars.",6,1,3,10 October 2019
American Sniper," Ok movie, very good Bradley Cooper
","I'm not an Eastwood lover - at all - but this movie is watchable. The usually dull tone preferred by Eastwood fits with the biographical story, I mean it's ok for a biopic (while not for many other movies directed by him).
Mild boredom will still hit here and there, but it's forgivable.
The movie is 100% on the shoulders of Bradley Cooper, and he easly carries the load: though he's a good actor, he did a very remarkable, surprising work here, in what could be his best performance to date.",6,1,20,3 February 2019
Gone Baby Gone," Amateurish
","Clumsy and predictable mystery with too many twists, voiceovers and flashbacks. Super clumsy juxtaposition with an important moral theme. Silly plot.It's always the same story with Ben Affleck's movies: both writing and direction are utterly amateurish. They are like an amauter thinks movies are written and directed.Michelle Monaghan's character is totally unnecessary.",2,1,4,19 May 2019
Rush," Underrated
","I was quite surprised by this movie. The ratings are good, but I don't like Ron Howard and I thought it was the usual, hollow overdramatization of actual events. Instead, it's a very nice movie, fairly accurate, and a must-see for any racing enthusiast.First and foremost, the racing scenes and the championship events are accurate and spectacular, they're pure fun.
I have to say there are some of the most perfect special effects I've ever seen, you can't say what's real and what's not.Also, I've NEVER seen a more accurate depiction of the 70's style; that's a very important thing to preserve the atmosphere and let you believe the movie is actually set in the 70's. Lots of movies fail miserably while attempting this. Here, every single t-shirt and haircut of the crowds in the stands is spot-on, the film grain for the racing scenes is very good, the cars are perfect, and most notably the tracks are straight out of the seventies.I like when the actors look like the real people they are interpreting. Here, everybody is a dead ringer: Niki, Marlene, Clay, everyone.Acting is good, Bruhl starts a bit over the top, but soon you'll get aquainted with his persona, and you'll find it's actually a very good performance.
Supporting cast is on par.
Just Hemsworth is a bit off target, because Hunt had a playful note he's not able to replicate. Here he plays just the 'handsome rogue', and little more.The Lauda-Hunt relationship is the less accurate part of the story, but this is an understandable license.Lastly, some quotes have real swagger, the Drake makes a cameo appearence, and the scene where Lauda drives in the italian countryside is outstanding.",7,4,6,21 March 2019
Bohemian Rhapsody," Are you kidding me
","Very disappointing. The movie itself is nothing special, it's just a trite arc of success, despair and redemption. Execution is poor: everything seems dialed in, and the movie fails miserably in involving the audience and give some emotional depth.
Also, I thought they would tell more about his life, and give some insight - they do not.The biggest reason for the failure is Academy Award winner Rami Malek. The truth is he's light-years away both from the greatness of Freddie and any kind of resemblance to his persona. Malek is only capable of hysterical blank stares with occasional weasel smirks, depriving Freddie Mercury of all of his irony, thoughtfulness, sweetness, energy, and grandeur. Malek's performance is the epitome of overrated and overblown.On a positive note, listening to a dozen of Queen hits played loudly at the cinema is something really great.",3,3,10,2 March 2019
Burn After Reading," Nice!
","The plot is a bit lightweight, but it is what it is. The movie is more about an absurd sequence of events set in a suspended atmosphere, filled with dry/dark humor. Nice to watch it, indeed. Acting is very good, Clooney, Malkovich, Swinton and the gym boss are perfect. Just McDormand is a bit annoying. Pitt tries, and succeeds here and there.
Overall, 2 nice hours. Just the ending is quite loose/unsatisfying, but whatever.",7,0,0,3 February 2019
The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo," Flawed
","Mild spoilers ahead. This movie has several flaws. First, it starts too fast: the audience is abruptly thrown in the middle of an ongoing plot, leading to that 'wow, I think I missed the prequel' feeling. Then, the two separate storylines about Craig and Mara take too much to merge. Third, the main plot about the serial killer is quickly forgotten when the movie adds another half an hour describing the closure of the trial, the scam, and the relationship between Craig and Mara. This is a mortal sin, because while you can do that in a book, its adaptation should take a different approach; I really dislike this kind of double-ending. Lastly, there was a lot of unnecessary violence and sex. While I have not problems with that when it's necessary, this movie left me with the feeling that they were included to artificially inflate both the story and the characters' appeal.That said, TGWTDT is just a detective story with an extravagant lead character. Probably the worst movie by Fincher, even if it will entertain you for a couple of hours.",4,1,4,10 March 2019
Jarhead," Polished
","Jarhead is not a masterpiece, but indeed a nice watch. Strong visuals, and a story that's slow (this is what the movie is about) but compelling enough. I had three or four moments where I didn't believe the script (tactical errors, everyday life situations), but it's taken from a real account by a Marine. Let me say, this movie is still way better than the most successful american, later movies about war by Kathryn Bigelow.",6,0,1,18 August 2019
Collateral," Far-fetched
","The cinematography is outstanding, the music is good, the idea is someway original. But it's a bit slow, and none of the plot is believable. They went too far in asking for suspension of disbelief. They didn't even try to tell a credible, compelling story. That would have made a very solid movie. Instead, Collateral comes out as good entertainment and nothing more.",6,2,6,6 September 2019
Dunkirk," Such an imposture
","The good: cinematography; metaphysical tone; some beautiful, artistic sequences.
Now the bad. - It's not thrilling, as someone says. - It's inaccurate, because there are a couple of moments in which soldiers do idiotic things no soldier would ever do (such as running away from the fire instead of sheltering behind houses). - It's quite ridiculous in the stripped down depiction of the beach: a couple of thousands of soldiers, ten vehicles, three planes. You know, the real thing was 100 times bigger. - Charachters have no background, and are not charachters in a true sense. - The dialogues have always been the worst part of Nolan's movies, and here are no better: naive, and full of exposition. - The storylines are even worse: what the heck with that young guy on the boat? Why should I care? The feeling is that Nolan is making up some easy-gripping situations, and mashing them together with no real structure or motive in a pandering movie. - The editing and the pace are a complete mess. The movie is quite boring, and having those split timelines is a clumsy and confusing attempt to add some value where it's missing. But the result is even worse, because you don't have just a dull story, now you have a dull and messy story.Now the huge fault of Nolan and the critics praising him is that they are stripping cinema down to something very simple, very unintelligent, packed in something else that pretends to be artistic and witty. That's an intellectual crime. There's a whole generation out there that believes Nolan is the greatest director ever, while he can be very millenial with this supercifial and pretentious approach. Gimme Private Ryan every day. It's not so much artistic and not so much fake-intellectual, but it's accurate, cares for details, it's spectacular, it's thrilling, has a real structure, real emotions, and real characters.Ps: I forgot the music. Amateurish attempt, again, to inflate the value of prolonged scenes by the use of annoying sounds, which span continuosly across several scenes with no hint of matching the editing. Some will say it's art, I say it's an easy way to fool the audience and aggrandize the mess.",4,1,4,10 January 2020
The Assassination of Jesse James by the Coward Robert Ford," Surprisingly good
","Is it slow? Yes it is. Apart from that, The Assassination has no flaws. Despite the pace, you'll still want to know what happens next. The narration is beautiful, thanks to photography, intense dialogues and some poetic voiceover from the book. The psychological dynamic between James and Ford is perfectly depicted. Every single facial expression is gold. Acting is terrific by Affleck, Rockwell, and Pitt in perhaps his best interpretation. The moment of the assassination is a thing of beauty. Lastly, this movie has the best photography I've ever seen, and I mean it.",7,2,2,26 April 2019
Toy Story 4," The worst Pixar movie in 15 years
","Toy Story 4 offers nothing new. It's the same old exhausting succession of chasings, hide & seek, and getting lost. I would compare it to a boring action flick.Also, there are way too many characters, in an attempt to trade quality for quantity and fill the running time with stuff.The movie explores the themes of rejection, freedom and love, but it doesn't take a clear path in its moral. It's more of an uncritical depiction of human behaviour rather than a true and useful lesson.There's a flurry of harshly negative reviews at the top of the list here, but somehow this cash-in is rated above 8? Something doesn't add up.",2,13,20,22 August 2019
Batman Begins," Genre-defining movie
","Hands-down the best Batman movie ever. The screenplay tries and succeeds in giving a superhero a somewhat believable aura of realism - exactly what this kind of comics lacked for over 50 years.
The story is compelling, the characters are fantastic, and there's a good explanation for everything, even the foolish masks Batman and his enemies wear.
There's a well written love story, much drama, and the psychological aspects are the most important part of the movie.
Batman himself is ultra-cool and delivers some of the most memorable lines an action hero ever did.",8,1,1,17 February 2019

Rise of the Planet of the Apes," B-movie
","This movie is totally unrealistic. The protagonist is extremely unlikeable, and badly acted. He's dumb. He should have gone to jail several times while repeatedly making unreasonable, hazardous and unlawful choices - though supposedly being a genius scientist. The plot is very predictable. The CGI is bad. Several scenes are written and directed like a bad student would. This is the definition of a B-movie. Ok, the ape makes some well-rendered stares, but there's nothing more than that.",1,1,4,6 February 2019

JFK," False history
","JFK is the bible of conspiracy theorists. 90% of this story has been debunked, and in my opinion it's a frightening example of human paranoia.I watched it again hoping for good cinema, but it's not. It's unnecessarily long, even accounting for the complexity of the story. Tons of scenes are wasted on useless family and professional dramas, and unimportant investigation details. So, you get the impression that Stone aims for the epic and pompous piece of Hollywood history, rather than making justice to real history.The only thing I appreciated was Gary Oldman as HL Oswald.",4,1,7,16 August 2019
Once Upon a Time... in Hollywood," It's awful
","I don't know why people are afraid to admit that, or feel compelled to give a high rating. This is flat-out awful. It's painfully boring. There's no plot. There are more like some 'situations', one after another, linked by terrible editing. The only 'plot moment' is the ending, but it's very predictable. There are no Tarantino-style dialogues - for the first time in his 9 movies. There are no 'wow' moments or hyperboles - for the first time in his 9 movies. The comedy is sparse. The movie unfolds as a dull trip through real-world characters, famous actors, tons of references to B-movies from the sixties, and nothing else. Literally: nothing else. I find it difficult to call it a movie, actually. It's more like a very personal and self-indulgent hommage to a kind of cinema he loves, but that's it. It ends up like a fictional and mildly funny documentary. I'm one of the most fanatic fans of Tarantino in the world, and this is not his old self, not in style and not in quality.Ps: Come on. I don't like fanboys and people who can't accept that the king is naked. The ending is pure mannerism and shocks nobody, also because there's no tension to resolve. Secondly, it's an anti-climax, the 'fixing' of something broken, the inner wish of an old man who became reactionary. That's very different from the 'Inglourious' ending, that was a shocking, epic and superfunny stroke of genius.",2,3,9,24 September 2019
Unknown," Wasted time
",This movie fails miserably in selling the pretended doubt upon which the whole plot is built. So there's no point in watching it. But the worst thing is that you could see the final twist coming 45 minutes away. It's sad to see Liam Neeson relegated to such movies.,2,1,5,17 April 2019

1917," Very disappointing
","1) It was so boring I wished I could leave halfway through. 2) The plot is very average. 3) There are tons of inaccurate or illogical things. For example, the whole premise of just two men carrying a crucial message is laughable. Then they have to cross enemy lines to meet their army again? How is that? Then they survive an explosion in the underground room, with no scars: that's impossibile. And so on and on and on. Terribly staged plot. 4) The cinematography is breathtaking, but you know what, that long shot (or should I say two shots, they were two shots) was boring and annoying. 5) The beautiful scenes, such as the shadows in the city. Again, am I watching a painting or a movie? This use of eye-candy strips all of the emotional involvement. Do you want me *into* the battle, or outside looking beautyful pictures? This is a critical and rather basic mistake. 6) Overall, this is an average movie with good looks and the huge minus of being utterly pretentious. Same as Dunkirk. I hate this millennial, hollow, falsely artistic style. It's a shame it's a nominee for the Best Movie award.",4,6,17,26 January 2020
Jerry Maguire," Dated
","20 years later, it plays a bit fake.
Cruise overacts a lot, as others have said here. The dialogues are forced here and there.

","EATG has been criticized for the love story, the stuff going on between Law and Fiennes, the exposition, and a plot that's flat and naive at times. While these are not the strongest features of the movie, I think they were overvalued by the critics. The story flows pretty well despite these shortcomings, and they are not enough to cancel the positives. The positives being: a movie from the russian point of view; a spectacular depiction of Stalingrad; outstanding action scenes with snipers fighting each other; the charm of Law, Weisz and Harris; and overall, a nice war drama indeed. 6.5 stars.",6,0,0,30 August 2019

Zero Dark Thirty," Underwhelming
","While it's interesting to follow the story of how they got Bin Laden, Zero Dark Thirty is not that good as a movie. I understand that the cold narration of actual facts is a choice when dealing with historically important events and with some things that ask major moral questions. But, it seems that these days any movie depicting war or terrorism is shot in this gritty, clinical, uncritical style. And you know what, that's not a plus. It just seems that Hollywood is afraid to give any spin to their movies, if the matter is someway controversial. I'm bored by these movies, and this is just what ZDT is, although being well shot and produced: boring.
A praise for the action sequence at the end, that's good.",5,3,9,13 April 2019

It seems a staged/allegoric setting, just like the ones you can find in theatre plays or in some novels from centuries ago.Also, the continuos enter/exit of the characters strenghtens this feeling you're watching a play.So, it ends up feeling a bit fake, because they choose to tell his life through unrealistic dialogues that would never happen before an event.That being said, the movie is almost enjoyable. Nothing compelling and a bit slow, but it's two hours of average entertainment.",6,2,3,12 July 2019
Joker," Well made
","I was pleasantly surprised by the tone of the movie, that's between grim and surreal with occasional grotesque moments, underlined by an outstanding use of music. Phoenix is freakin good, I liked much his laugh. The character development is good.
On the other hand, Joker comes a bit short in the ending, when you expect a climax that's nowhere to be found. Phoenix acting becomes a little stale also, when it should have delivered the final punch. Another flaw (or it's more a doubt maybe) is the glorification of social revenge. I didn't like the unnecessary rude depiction of Wayne at all. Overall, it's a well made and well directed movie, that could have had more substance. And as usual nowadays, a nice movie that's heavily marketed suddenly becomes a masterpiece for the masses. 6.5 stars.",6,0,5,11 October 2019
Man on Fire," Clusmy and disturbing
","Slow and clumsy, it's a very linear revenge movie in its development, such that equal amounts of time are slavishly devouted to each of the necessary plot points. The editing reminds a lot of CSI. Some scenes are disgustingly violent. Man on fire left me with a very bad taste. Denzel is as good as usual.",5,2,4,2 May 2019
Whiplash," Nice
","Top-notch camera work and top-notch JK Simmons. Tension stays high throughout the whole movie, and many twists keep the story from being predictable. Execution is well above average.
While it's surley entertaining, I think Whiplash lacks some depth. When the credits roll, you will find out that the story arc is very linear, and there's no enlightenment in it. At the and of day, this story is about grit and endurance, and nothing else. 6.5/10.",6,2,2,19 February 2019
Bram Stoker's Dracula," Some flaws and some outstanding aspects
","Must-see overall. The flaws: the first part is quite clunky, the script makes no effort in trying to make things believable or coherent. Reeves is awful (he is nominated for the worst miscasting ever). Van Helsing is quite annoying, dull character and over-the-top at the same time. Some outdoor scenographies and lighting are absymal (Coppola choose to shoot everything on stage to avoid production delays). Some dialogues are silly, the XIX century language sounds weird at times. Some visual effects in the first act look quite dated and ridiculous.But once the story gets going, most of these shortcomings disappear. Seems like Coppola spent all of his effort on the second and third act. The pace becomes faster. There are several jumps forward in time that help build a tragic/romantic/oniric atmosphere. The show is stealed by Ryder (perfect in acting her possession and dilemma) and Oldman. Oldman is a force of Nature: dramatic, empathic, pompous. Their love story is outstanding, spanning four centuries on the notes of a dedicated musical theme. Dracula's character becomes deep and human. The ending is well conceived. Meanwhile, Coppola starts showing his best visual effects one by one - both camera effects and prosthetics. Dracula is a powerful, mesmerizing presence, in each of his many shapes: impeccably elegant englishman, creepy old man, haunting beast. Visually the movie reaches its height during the final scene outside of the castle, that is a thing of beauty. Overall, the movie is a powerful, baroque and truly romantic narration of a XIX century tale.",7,1,1,18 January 2020
It Chapter Two," No
","The direction is heavily off target, and mostly the script also is. There's too much exposition, the plot is constanly forced, many scenes are rushed so that they never build a true atmosphere.There's an awfully amateurish use of music, with scary sounds inserted in every wanna-be thrilling moment, but in this way you're warned every time and you don't get scared. Also, many scenes have an 'adventure' soundtrack that really doesn't fit anything. I don't know about this Muschietti, but he seems very millennial.The story is a collage of scenes with no climax. Also, there's no real plot: as I suspected, the present day story told independently from the childhood setting is not enough for a movie.Pennywise is non-scary, as he was in the first chapter. He's just obnoxious, but not scary or evil.
The squirming monsters are silly as usual.McAvoy and Chastain are totally wasted.The ending is unsatisfying.This movie is a huge disaster, and it's 60 minutes longer than it should.Ps: 'Be who you want to be' while Ritchie carves his name along Eddie's name... fed up with this repulsive, omnipresent, passive propaganda.",2,3,11,10 September 2019
Inception," Obviously a masterpiece
","I watched this for the fourth or fifth time tonight. This is the first time I remembered the details of the plot from the previous watches, and that I had no difficulty in understanding all the fast and complicated explanations the characters give. I'm sure there are a couple of holes, but all in all it makes sense, and it doesn't matter anyway.Inception is a freak, absurd movie, of course in a positive way. How they did imagine such a story and got it into production is just unbelievable. Even some years later, it stands out for its originality.The personal story of Cobb is very interesting, and every time (from the second time on) I can't but cry when there's that particular shot at the end.Inception explores the perception of reality, but while Matrix did it from some kind of rebellion/resurgence standpoint, and The Truman Show did from an emotional/human point of view, Inception's take is deeply existential, and that's a huge plus. Reality, desire and their conflictual relationship is the true subject of this story.There are, unfortunately, a couple of minor flaws. Nolan could have taken the chance of using a language that would be a bit more oniric, I mean letting weird things happen as they actually do in dreams. Instead, the actions and flow are just too realistic, as they would happen in the real world, and the movie puts a great effort into making things play out in a realistic way. This is surely a missed opportunity.
Secondly, it is apparent here the tendency of the Nolan brothers to explain, explain, explain. Every action needs an explanation. While here it's a minor shortcoming, it became annoying later in Interstellar.Apart from this, Inception is surely one of the masterpieces of this era, for its originality, execution, and powerful imagery.",9,1,2,24 April 2019
Parasite," Just read...
","Parasite is a unique movie. I don't know if it's a true masterpiece, or one of a kind (indeed), or just a piece of masterful craft. Bong does everything he wants while telling his stories, and he's the only one I know who can do that aside from Tarantino. The plus here is a very sound moral. I will think a lot about Parasite, and maybe watch it again. This is the first time in 100+ reviews that I don't feel I can correctly rate a movie, but surely it is in the 8 to 10 stars range.",Null,22,35,21 January 2020
The Dark Knight Rises," Too much
","This story has nothing to do with Batman. Batman is not about action-packed large scale wars, where he is just one of several heroes. Batman should be a one man show in a smaller context. In this way, instead, the existential drama typical of Batman is sacrificed in favor of too many distracting elements. The movie starts slowly, trying to develop a story from the ending of the previous installment, but it's not that compelling. Neither Bane is that interesting as an enemy, at the end of the day he's just the same old anarchist tyrant menacing the masses. The exotic setting of the central part of the movie is redundant, it would have been better to leave the asiatic setting of the first movie alone. On the other hand, the ending is good and the Hathaway character is also. Overall, the movie tries to reach an extent that's too much for a Batman story.",3,2,4,17 February 2019
Casino Royale," Disappointed
","Standard action movie: lots of action, poor characterization, poor depth (despite they pretend to give some), a final twist, and mildly boring overall. I'm not a Bond expert but this time he seems to lack some style. This Bond is quite raw and not that charming. Poor music.",4,4,11,11 December 2019
Identity," Unfair
","Well, I watched this because many people wrote it's better than Bad Times at the El Royale.Just no.This movie builds a good suspance, but it's unfair to the audience. Unfair.
A final plot twist doesn't save it.",4,2,7,31 January 2019
Midway," Hahahaha
","Absolute trash. They managed to make one of the most exciting moments in history a boring piece of garbage. I was expecting a tight account of the several coincidences, doubts, gambles and strategies that led to the outcome. Instead, I got an unwarranted focus on 2d-rendered characters I couldn't care less for. It's hard to understand the real dynamics of Midway watching this film. Other shortcomings: 1) Clichés, such as pilots questioning their commanders orders in their face and doing 'rebel' things, as if this was 'Top Gun'. 2) Terrible choice of starting the story from Pearl Harbour. Because of this, the script is cramped and many scenes are rushed. The day of Midway needed two hours of narration itself to adequately tell the almost unbelievable development of events. It was a griding day of crucial choices and risks taken, that would not show their consequences until two hours later. Tension at its best. 3) Ok with the 'realism', but why insist with japanese people speaking Japanese and having me reading subtitles? That was unnecessary. 4) The CGI. Good grief. Most of it is very good. But in the most spectacular moments, you can clearly see the heavy hand of the director and imagine him say: 'More spectacular! More spectacular!'. I'm talking about the super fake cameras moving around the crashing planes: that was good 20 years ago, now it's just boring and fake. Gimme some good vehicle mounted cameras (as Nolan and Miller still do) and that's ten times more breathtaking. Other laughable and heavy-handed CGI moments are the large fires: burning Pearl Harbour has nothing realistic to a trained eye, it's more similar to an imperial cruiser crashing on a planet. 5) Exposition. 6) Acting. They spent 100 millions, and couldn't sign good actors, aside from Harrelson who by the way is going through the motions.
Overall: hot garbage.",2,3,8,6 December 2019
Godzilla," Guys...
","This is the same old movie made from the same mold. It's no different from a Godzilla movie from 50 years ago or from some of the worst Jurassic Park sequels. The build-up is very slow, the creatures design is copied and pasted. There's a trite and useless family sub-plot, make no mistake.Some months ago I watched Cloverfield for the second time after ten years, and man, that was a terrifying, modern Kaiju movie. Years have passed, and they still make these old-school movies, all with the same plot. At least, the Godzilla from 1998 tried to stun the audience with updated effects, some (bad) humor and the 'size matters' refrain. Instead, this work from Gareth Edwards is flat and dull even in the action scenes. I didn't like Edwards in his awful 'Monsters', but this is even worse.",2,3,5,13 August 2019
Green Book," How this won an Academy is beyond me
","It's a bad mix of 'Driving Miss Daisy' and 'Planes, Trains and Automobiles'. Nothing you haven't seen before. Boring, naive, one-dimensional characters. Also, there's the annoying omnipresent PC, that is arguably the only feature of this movie. The black man is a gay also, because nowadays you gotta go with the most possible number of minorities.",4,1,3,20 March 2020
Mad Max: Fury Road," Masterpiece
","I watched this for the second time yesterday, and it was as satisfying as the first time. Fury Road is a little masterpiece (for those asking why my rate is just 8, I think that higher ratings should be reserved to era-defining movies and such).I'm not a fan of action flicks, nor I am of the Mad Max series; but this is a jewel in film making. Here are some notes:1) Action, action, action. Fury Road is an adrenaline bomb from start to finish. While, as I stated, I'm not fond of action itself, when a movie keeps you on the edge for two hours I like it. The problem with most action movies is that you have seen it all before, more or less; in Fury Road, 90% of the action is something new: funny, over the top, superfast, acrobatic, and surprising. It's obvious that the sequences are written with sincere passion, rather than with that 'let's stun the audience with special effects and milk their money!' mood, that's ever increasing nowadays.2) While the photography deserves a mention itself for the over-saturated colors and the beautiful landscapes, the most important aspect about it is the action again. Photography is in service of action, and it does a wonderful job. Lots of scenes have a weird, fast framerate, that gives the movie a distinctive, funny, and obviously 'speedy' look. Dozen of takes filming the explosions are made through old-fashioned fixed cameras mounted on the vehicles, so that you're thrown into the action for real - not like in today's movies, where odd and complicated digital camera movements take away all the emotions.3) The story. It's original and surprising, something of a 'move on from the same old tropes'. It starts and ends in an old-fashioned way, because it has to stay in its roots, but all what's in between is absolutely fresh. Characters are funny, deep, and all enjoy their personal arc.4) Max himself. Tom Hardy is a great replacement, and I'll say he's even better than Mel Gibson (or, something more on pace with the times). His grunts, short lines, and facial expressions (often subtly ironic) are just perfect. I'll also add that the rough, sharp way he moves and walk is a subtle and perfect rendering of that character, a man whose only goal is to survive.5) The design of sets, costumes and cars. Beautiful.6) The old-fashioned way: practical effects, little CGI, and the old way of shooting, as I mentioned. It's definitely better.7) The last and most compelling aspect of this movie in my opinion is that it's totally over the top. Exaggerated characters, sequences, and language ('blood bag', 'witness me', 'shiny and chrome'). The guitar player, the models, the fight with the car door, the gun wielding blind man... everything in this movie is just mad. I like this a lot, it's some kind of post-modern, pulpish cinema.Edit: I watched it for the third time, and I'd like to add,8) It's built like a comic book, really, and I like this very much. The three villains are straight from a comic book in their characterization. Lots of sequences are edited like comics, with interconnected shots and wide angles opening and closing them. Some obscure details like the missing shoe, the jacket, the bullet-teeth and so on get their brief screen time and help build the sequences, that's another thing you find in comics.",8,2,6,18 June 2019
Law Abiding Citizen," The ending
","I'm with everybody else here, the plot was unbelievable but it was super fun, until the ending ruined it all. I think LAC is a self-conscious b-movie that could have been fantastic but lost it all at the end. I appreciated a lot what was Butler's ultimate goal, but that was not enough. Definitely recommended for revenge movie enthusiasts, because 90% of the movie is original and inventive and will keep you guessing.Ps: it reminded me a lot of 'Massacre at Central High', a super trash movie from the seventies, in its senseless, over-the-top, overreactive killings.",5,0,1,17 April 2019
V for Vendetta," Laughable
","Fascinating character. Very poor story, told 1000 times before. Laughable script at every single plot turn. As Brainless as it gets. Idiot popular vendetta, Hunger Games-style. Political agenda. Anti-clerical. Gay propaganda.",2,6,20,28 April 2019
