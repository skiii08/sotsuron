The Monuments Men," Wartime Ocean's Eleven
","You know how people complain that they 'don't make nice, simple movies' anymore? Check this one out. Confidently directed by Clooney, this gorgeous film follows a group of WWII soldiers with one very complicated task: rescue and recover as many great works of art as they can from the Nazis. Sounds like an easy job, right? Nope. With the Germans losing the war, they started retreating back into their native land--and took everything they had pillaged with them. Or burned it. Clooney, Damon and Blanchett are great -- I got a distinct 'wartime Ocean's 11' vibe from them -- but the real standouts are Bill Murray and John Goodman, investing their characters with heart. It's not the greatest movie ever made, and not even the best WWII movie ever made (that's Schindler's List, a movie I saw once and never need to see again), but it's the kind of the un-ironic, un-cynical movie Hollywood doesn't make any more.",7,1,2,8 November 2019
Drive," Dumb
","Wow. Not sure what people are thinking, calling this a modern classic? Nope. If you want that, see 'Nightcrawler.' Hell, 'Baby Driver' is a better 'getaway driver' movie and at least brings something inventive to the table. I watched this with much anticipation, having heard it was a great movie. Not really. Let's watch the two main characters stare at each other for long, soundless scenes, populate the film with ZERO interesting characters, and then top it of by having a main character with the emotional range of a toothpick (see what I did there).",3,3,8,3 November 2019
The Guernsey Literary and Potato Peel Pie Society," Watch out for that escaped pig!
","Just a wonderful film. Beautifully shot and well acted, this moving story of the German occupation of the small island of Guernsey during World War II focuses on how the occupation affected those who lived there. Lily James is perfect as a curious London writer who comes to the island on a whim and is drawn into the lives of the members of a book club, started on the island during the war. The regular meetings allowed the club members a legal reason to meet and socialize.But the story also explores the dark side of the occupation, including those who worked with the Germans and the painful repercussions. As a writer, I understand the power of books and share the joy that these fictional readers enjoyed in their wartime appreciation of the written word--and the way it can offer escape. An excellent film, recommended for anyone who enjoys a moving story and a well-crafted, beautifully shot film.",9,1,2,27 October 2018
