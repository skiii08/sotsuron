The Ring," Hmmm...why!
","Imagine the scene...Its Saturday night, The Ring premiered the night before, and I'm really excited to see  what the Americans have done with what is, in my opinion, the greatest horror movie of all time, Ring/Ringu.It opens, and the female actors are quite bland, not a decent following to a good, albeit brief title sequences. the direction is nice, the lighting is suitable and the whole thing seems better than I anticipated. Fifteen minutes pass, and I'm still enjoying the movie. But then 'Samara''s videotape is played, and the movie takes a turn for the worse. From then on, the plot removes itself completely from the Japanese original, and the atmosphere is totally non-existent. The movie relies on cheap scares to keep you on your seat. Sadly, the impressive direction could not save a very poor movie, which does not touch the original in terms of greatness.
And, frankly, the end sequence is rubbish, unlike the great original.",Null,0,1,24 February 2003
