Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," Not that good, but not that bad either
","I'm more of a casual 'Star Wars' fan, which is probably why I don't think of Ep I as the train wreck that more hardcore fans see it as. In fact, I think the movie was going to be disappointing to most simply because it was so anticipated; when you stand outside a movie theater for hours, days or even weeks waiting to see a movie, I don't see how that movie can possibly meet your expectations.Yes, Jar Jar's antics get old fast, and it's hard to accept that this whiny little kid is supposed to be the same character as Darth Vader, but overall this is a fun, watchable film. The action starts almost immediately (and there's plenty of it); there's suspense, mystery and treachery all about; and we finally get to see many of the things that were only talked about in the original trilogy. Liam Neeson is particularly enjoyable in his role, and it's a real shame that they didn't include his character in the next two films.What I really thinks hurts the movie is that it's missing most of the beloved characters from the first trilogy that made up the heart of that series. Combine that with the fact that we already know what's going to happen in the big picture, and the film loses a lot of the emotional attachment that made the originals so fun to watch. You don't have as much invested in the characters, so you don't care that much if they live or die (the same factor that makes a lot of slasher films so lame).And, like all the 'Star Wars' movies, there's a big loss in the translation from big screen to small screen. I remember being on the edge of my seat during the pod race scene when I saw this in the theater, but on a TV screen it's just not as exciting. The same goes for the climactic space battle. These movies were meant to be seen in theaters, and watching them at home makes their flaws a lot more noticeable.In conclusion, I feel that watching 'Phantom Menace' is like going to a football game where you don't follow either of the teams. It's still fun to watch the show, but it's not the experience that watching your favorite team is.",5,0,1,14 July 2007
Silent Hill," Who greenlit this?
","Two words: it SUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUCKED! The plot was nearly impossible to follow and made no sense. I've played the first game and I had no clue what was going on whatsoever. I wanted to like this movie so much, but I could tell in the first five minutes it was going to be horrible. They just jumped right into the story; there's no chance for you to get to know the characters or even get your bearings.The problem with 'Silent Hill' wasn't a lack of imagination; the problem is the filmmakers just jump right into the story and don't give you an explanation to what is going on. The characters are bland and the script is dull. I like the 'Resident Evil' movies although they're clearly not meant to be artistic or even good; yet compared to this one 'Resident Evil' was 'Citizen Kane.' What really amazes me is that Hollywood execs can't seem to figure out why movie ticket sales are in a slump. They give us incomprehensible dreck like this and expect us to lap it up. Not me, thank you.'Silent Hill' is a terrible, terrible film. I wouldn't see it again if I could get in free. In fact, I wouldn't see it again if they payed me.",1,2,6,29 April 2006
Star Wars: Episode II - Attack of the Clones," Great visuals undermined by weak script, acting
","I hadn't seen this one since it was first released to theaters back in '02, and it didn't seem as good as I remembered it. In the theaters I liked it enough to see it twice, but on a TV screen Ep II's flaws are more evident.What really brings this film down is the flat dialog and sub-par acting through most of it. It's really noticeable in the first half hour; the dialog is mumbo-jumbo, the kind of lines that you'd expect from one of those old '40s serials that the 'Star Wars' saga was modeled after. You'd think that by now, however, screenwriters would know how to put a little humanity into the the script.Even worse is the acting; Christensen and McGregor say their lines as if they were merely rehearsing the scenes and didn't know the cameras were rolling. Natalie Portman tries to add depth to her character, but there's only so much she can do with such a cardboard script.The other major problem with this entry in the series is that it tries to do too much; since Anakin was such a good little kid in the first film but had to be turned into Darth Vader in the third, Lucas tries to cram in most of his 'turn to the Dark Side' in this volume, and it just comes off as forced. Plus they also had to fit in the major part of the big conspiracy that results in the downfall of the Republic, but there's so much going on that, frankly, it's hard to tell what's going on. Rome wasn't built in a day, nor can a government ruling 'thousands and thousands of solar systems' completely fall apart in seven hours of screen time. I'm at the point now where I'm reading the novelizations of the films and then watching the films just to try to understand everything that's happening on-screen.The film finally picks up once the great 'Clone War' gets underway. Lucas and his staff deserve kudos for some of the most fantastic scenes ever committed to film, and here it actually made more sense to have it all CGI - the logistics of trying to keep that large of a cast and crew all on the same page would have been too much for even Cecil B. DeMille. Stuff like this is why mega screens were made.Unfortunately the film as a whole is too flawed to make up for the fun and excitement of the final half hour. I know most 'SW' fans will think I'm crazy for saying it, but overall I have to say I enjoyed 'Phantom Menace' more than this one.",5,1,2,14 July 2007
The Shining," Best viewed as an adaptation, not a translation
","Just watched 'The Shining' again for the first time in years and I still don't know what to think. The first time I viewed it, 20+ years ago now, I utterly hated it because I literally had just got done reading the book earlier that same day. A few years later, after reading about it in John McCarty's excellent book 'The Modern Horror Film,' I gave it another shot and found I enjoyed it much more. McCarty says the film is best viewed as an adaptation, not a translation, of King's novel. This is true.There is no denying that the film is magnificently crafted. The cinematography is graceful and beautiful, and the production design is to die for. Every time I see the film I'm still astonished that the entire hotel was built on a soundstage. Where the film suffers is the casting. Jack Nicholson seems like he's on the edge of madness right from the beginning. He's great in the later part of the film once the madness has fully taken hold of his character, but in the first part of the film I can't help but wonder, 'Why would anyone in their right mind think it would be a good idea to leave this guy in charge of a hotel in the middle of nowhere for six months?' And Shelley Duval just spends the whole movie seeming like she's on the verge of fainting. Granted, that may not be her fault so much as the script's, which turns her character into a rag doll that is seemingly afraid of everything.Just my $.02.",7,1,3,13 February 2016
It Follows," The best I've seen in a while, very well-constructed.
","As a jaded horror fan, I wasn't sure what to expect from 'It Follows.' I heard it was scary, some even saying it was the scariest ever. But it seems like every few years some new film comes out and gets the same lip service, only to prove either uninteresting, unoriginal, or just plain irritating ('Blair Witch Project,' anyone?) So I was relieved when 'It Follows' had me right from the beginning, and downright delighted when it followed through on the promise shown in its first few minutes. Indeed, it reminded me of George Romero's 'Dawn of the Dead.' Not because there are any zombies or shopping malls, but because it's a low-budget yet well-crafted, inventive film that delivers the goods while sneaking in some social commentary. For starters, let's talk about the characters. One of the most common flaws in fright flicks is that the viewer never feels much attachment to the protagonists, so there's no real sense of loss when they're in danger or even when they die. We've all sat through movies where we don't care if the characters get killed, or even worse, we wind up rooting for them to get killed. That is not the case here. The film takes what could've been very stock, clich√©d characters and fleshes them out, and the young cast does an excellent job of bringing them to life. As the story went on it was as if I could see a little of myself in each of them.Second, the film's premise carefully builds and then reinforces a haunting sense of dread, another vital ingredient missing from so many entries in this genre. I felt it when I read Stephen King's ''Salem's Lot' and the first time I saw Romero's 'Dawn.' Those works, like 'It Follows,' give the reader/viewer a troubling uneasiness... that awful feeling (like you have in dreams) that while you can run, you can't hide. As one character puts it, 'All you can do is buy yourself some time.' In King's novel, it was knowing that every night, the town's (human) population was getting smaller and smaller, while the number of vampires was getting bigger and bigger. In Romero's film, it was the constant threat of the zombies; no matter where you go, no matter how much you barricade the door, you never know when you'll look up and see a flesh-hungry walking corpse ready to make you its lunch. And in 'It Follows'... well, I won't say anything. Just see the film and you'll know what I mean.Another noteworthy aspect of this film is that it manages to seem fresh even though it's not that original. There are elements of John Carpenter's 'Halloween,' Wes Craven's 'A Nightmare on Elm Street,' and Gore Verbinski's 'The Ring.' (I include the names of the directors not to sound pretentious, but to differentiate them from the remakes and diluted sequels that followed them. At least for the first two - I've never seen either the Japanese film 'Ringu,' of which Verbinski's film is a remake, nor 'The Ring Two.') It's arguable (and doubtless is being argued on a web forum somewhere at this very moment) that we've seen all this before, and yet 'It Follows' doesn't at all seem like another by-the-numbers horror movie. It's well-crafted and polished, with extraordinary attention to detail in virtually every shot. (One thing I'm still trying to figure out is when exactly is the story supposed to take place? Again, see the movie and you'll see what I mean.)Finally, there's the social commentary sprinkled throughout the movie. It reminded me of Paul Thomas Anderson's 'Boogie Nights,' in that the commentary here is both subtle and non-judgmental. This isn't a slasher flick where the vices of teenagers and young adults equal a death sentence. It's just part of who these people are. They're decent kids who have a drink or a smoke now and then; who doesn't at that age? And as for the dangers of premarital sex... again, just see the movie.If you're a horror fan, 'It Follows' is a must-see. And if you're one of those who doesn't like horror because it seems like once you've seen one, you've seen them all, you should really give this one a look as well. It may seem familiar at first, but trust me, you haven't seen this one before.",8,4,66,5 April 2015
