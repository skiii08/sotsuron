First Man," I am from Germany and do not understand the bad reviews from the Americans.
","This movie is incredible! Brilliant Acting, intense rocket flights and a unbelievably beautiful Soundtrack. A glimpse into the life of Neil Armstrong. No hero. Never was, never will be. Just a civilian with willpower and a goal. Nothing more to say. For me its a masterpiece and I can not understand the bad review.",9,6,10,18 December 2018
