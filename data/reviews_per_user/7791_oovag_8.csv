Come and See," Almost historical
","It's a pretty good movie. At least it is exact at showing the way of proceeding of the SD Einsatzgruppen. As for their cruelty, it also shows that of the predecessors of the Einsatzgruppen, the cavalry in the USA.
Unfortunately, the movie shows Stalinist Antisemistism too. The film denies the Holocaust. The activities of the Einsatzgruppen are directed against Russians, not against Jews.",7,1,9,17 July 2019

Blade Runner," An unsurpassed masterpiece
","All written by Dick is indescribable crap. It is all the more astonishing what excellent films has been made of it. A Rutger Hauer has delivered a top performance here that I never expected from him, and which he never repeated. The latter can also be said about others.",10,1,3,8 December 2019
