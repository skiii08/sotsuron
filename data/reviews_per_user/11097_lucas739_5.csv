The Equalizer," Great .... except the end.
","I sat down to watch this film not expecting much but i have to admit i was pleasantly surprised. I enjoyed it so much i was compelled to write a review, so that says something! Denzel Washington puts in a solid performance as the lead character, ably supported by a rather hot Chloe Grace Moretz amongst others plus a host of your usual Eastern European, tattoo covered mobsters. The film builds nicely from a rather slow start, a start which contrasts well with the action to come, giving you no clue as to what will unfold. My only caveat is with the end scene/boss fight. Thankfully it wasn't a shirtless, gladiatorial fight to the death, however, the scene is set inside a DIY superstore where our hero uses a variety of store products to dispatch those pesky Russians. I can see a parody where, as he hangs one baddie with barbed wire using cement bags as a counterweight i can see him pausing to say 'barbed wire, not just for fencing and only $1 a foot' he proceeds to use a cordless drill, some kind of long handled shears, gas bottles etc etc. Just looked a bit naff and took the edge off what was up until that point a very solid film. Definitely worth a watch.",7,0,1,12 January 2015
Oldboy," Great film!
","I feel compelled to defend this film from some quite frankly unwarranted criticism. Although it isn't without its flaws, and all films have a few,it certainly isn't a one star film.What this film has is the ability to be sublime, shocking, ridiculous, mildly amusing and visually stunning which is some feat for any film.The sheer scale of the comments here suggests that here is a film that gets to you in one way or another. This film is as far away from Maborosi as you can get yet both films are up there as great pieces of cinema. I wont divulge the plot or end this comment with a Latin quote to reinforce my self importance i'll just say go and watch it, preferably if you're not too squeamish and don't mind subtitles.This film left me thinking about it the following day which is normally a good thing (atleast it shows my memory is working!)",9,258,417,17 March 2007
Pacific Rim," Specifically Grim is a big ball of nothing surrounded by lights and toys!
","There are only two angles to review this film from.First is as a preschooler, possibly able to eat solids and potty trained (this is the demographic i hope the film was aimed at).From this diminutive position the whole feature will be lots of flashing lights and creatures and robots and planes and stuff...wow. To anyone else, anyone with half a brain, anyone who can use the big toilet will see this for the steaming pile of vacuity it really is.It felt like brain rape sitting through it. The only way i could endure such utter garbage was to hold a cabbage to the side of my head and try to master 'drifting' with it.The cabbage, with its iQ of zero, couldn't take more than 10 minutes before it got up, declared it to be an abomination and left. As a 2+ hour advert for the forthcoming Jaeger toy range it was a complete success but peel away the gossamer veneer of a story and you'll find nothing of any real substance, nothing at all. I find it staggering that it has a IMDb rating of over 7. It is a damning indictment of how low our expectation levels have fallen. Move on, nothing to see here.",1,8,15,25 October 2013
Hansel & Gretel: Witch Hunters," Better than expected.
","The problem i have with reviewing films that are 'OK' is that there isn't enough to write about to fulfill the 10 line obligation you have to write in order to get your opinions across. So with that in mind it brings me to this offering.Initially i was expecting dross and on that level it sometimes delivers, but overall its quite an entertaining couple of hours viewing. I do have a few gnawing issues with it. Firstly the modern American accents, highlighted, if memory serves me well, with a 'take that bitch' and a 'wow awesome' pretty shitty for where the film is supposed to be set. Artertons transatlantic accent was a bit adrift, and finally the troll has to be about the worst piece of CGI/Plastic/Foam/Puppetry to have graced the screen for decades. Large man in a crap outfit immediately springs to mind, though admittedly he had the best scene in the film for me. Finally this penchant for Steampunk style weaponry is way overused, how about more conventional gear, better fight scene/choreography and better/ more authentic accents,i'm sure Renner can offer something up with a Germanic air, 'take zat du biatch' or 'wow das ist fantastiche'",6,0,2,25 December 2013
Gone Girl," Naff
","The early part of this film is OK but as the 'story' unfolds it becomes a bit of a farce. The Neil Harris lake section was completely unnecessary plus it added an extra painful 15 minutes to what was already becoming a long film. The holes in the plot were at times gaping, leaving me amazed at how this got to be the case. Affleck does what Affleck do, kind of does the emotion without really portraying it with any depth. Support characters were so-so though the defence lawyer had something about him as did the lead detective, everyone else i've already forgotten about. Its a pity because this could have been a half decent film but was sadly let down by a pretty poor script, plot inconsistencies and being overly long. OK to watch on a long haul flight when you're driven to distraction with boredom otherwise i wouldn't bother. Finally the IMDb score yet again bears no relation to the actual quality of the film,. i've scored it a 4 which i think is fair, 5 at a stretch but to have a score of over 8 is just plain ridiculous.",4,4,11,3 January 2015
