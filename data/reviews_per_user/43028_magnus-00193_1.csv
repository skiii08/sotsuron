Blade Runner 2049," So boring i almost fell asleep
","Saw this movie when it came on viaplay and the first 15 min or so it seemed promising. I kept waiting for something to happen... some action, some mystery or just a small thrilling moment that made my pulse raise a little bit... that diddnt happen. I felt almost Zero connection to any of the characters with the exeption of the AI girlfriend who had a tiny bit of substance.
The visuals However was very impresive but the lack of anything happening in Said visuals made me realize i could Archive the same amount of visual excitement looking at photos on google. Because of the visuals i would give it Maybe 2-3 out of 10 but because everyone might not be put off by the lack of action the same way as me i could understand if the user rating was at a mixed/mediocre rating of 6. However this movie does definitly not deserve an 8.1 rating and to help pull that rating Down on a level that matches the quality of this movie i am going to give it 1 Star.",1,5,11,3 August 2018
