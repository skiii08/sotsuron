E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial," The Story that Touched the World
","One word to describe this movie. Wow. I have loved this movie ever since I was about 5 years old. Great acting, Great plot, Great graphics (for 1982, when the movie came out), Great Everything. This is Speilburg at his BEST! And as for Henry Thomas, amazing. No one else could have mastered the character of Elliot. There is definitely nothing I would change about this movie if I was given the opportunity. This is THE movie that touched the world. It still jerks a tear and make my heart feel like it weighs a ton, every time I watch it. It is, overall, outstanding. All of its great qualities earns it a perfect 10/10. Bravo!",10,1,2,5 November 2005
