The Equalizer," Best Bad Ass Movie ever possibly IMHO
","Great story, and the character build up was done so well with this movie that you can't help but get sucked in and love Denzel. The story is unique but it has to do with the timing of the release. It's possibly that this movie would be 'just another one of those' types of movies which I can't state as I don't want to spoil anything. Then end is very well done, which is hard to do as a lot of movies are ruined by the very fact that they don't hit the bulls eye, sometimes they come close and sometimes they completely miss the mark. With this movie, I think they hit the bulls eye, so you have a good movie and a good ending. No one will not enjoy this movie, and if you're a Denzel fan, it may become your favorite? Now I want to watch Man on Fire again and I will definitely be watching this movie again, this goes into the family, movie library.",10,0,6,18 February 2017
Once Upon a Time... in Hollywood," This Movie is a 10+
","Quentin Tarantino has created my new favorite movie.The detail, the era was obviously something that QT loves and wanted to share and I'm thankful for such a Master Piece. I lived in the areas that this movie was shot in so, I may be somewhat biased?QT is one of the best!",10,31,52,9 August 2019
Django Unchained," Classic
","This is in the top three of the thousands of movies I've seen. The story is brilliant, the acting portrayed by Christoph Walsh is stupendous. The cast is 'All Star', music meticulously set, the scenes leave you craving to know what's next, and thank god for pause and rewind. This movie is like a tasty snack, you can just have one, you'll want more and you want to watch it again and talk about all the scenes and characters with your friends.",10,1,4,16 March 2019
Django Unchained," Epic Movie
","Albeit this was an epic flick, many other actors could have truly portrayed Djanjo, and even Calvin Candie couldn't claim to have propelled this flick to a vote of an 8. No Sir/Mam! Christoph Waltz ... Dr. King Schultz thrust this movie to the status that is should be embraced as. Christopher Waltz was in epic form and carried this movie with one of the greatest performances of any film I've seen, and I've seen well over (lets just say, quite a lot of movies) in the last 40 plus years. The story is otherwise very good and the acting and costumes and effects are all up to snuff. Entertaining and fun to watch. You'd never know just what to expect. That's one of the great aspects of the movie that I almost forgot to mention.",10,0,2,22 December 2014
Man on Fire," This movie is a Masterpiece
","This is one of Denzel's best movies of all time. I like The Equalizer more, but still, there's no comparison between the original with Scott Glenn and this movie. Do yourself a favor when you watch this movie. Get a drink, grab a snack and prepare to enjoy yourself for the entire duration of the movie, down to the very last second. How's that for a review? I don't want to give any details away. I will say that there are some valuable lessons in this movie that are enough to set anyone on a straight path, so consider it a learning experience as well.",10,5,8,19 February 2017
