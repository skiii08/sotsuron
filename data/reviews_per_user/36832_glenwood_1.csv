The Blair Witch Project," Jaded Film Snobs Beware!!
","A huge media event is always fun. Even if it's overhyped and under-criticised. There was a big hole in my heart this year where Star Wars:Ep1 was supposed to be but failed. I think it's just amazing that 2 dudes blew their last bit of cash and made a really different and fun horror movie. The hype and gimmickery were relatively minimal and fueled almost entirely by the fact that this film got people talking. Sheesh, I mean there weren't even television ads until a couple of days ago! How can anyone who endures an incessant pummeling of Star Wars and Disney crap on everything from watches to coloring books to freakin Mcdonald's cups even begin to say that The Blair Witch Project is somehow especially hyped?
Before filmakers stopped being storytellers and became illusionists, movies had to use the audiences' imagination, character development, and solid fiction to create cinema. In this age of horror movies that rely solely on teenage cleavage and cat scares, I am excited and moved by the fact that a teeny movie (that is, granted, a bit hard on the attention span at times) has completely exploded. And it's not because kids are whining for the Happy Meals, but because it for the most part is interesting and accomplishes something new. People are talking about it. I'm going to see it again ASAP. I have included some replies to other's posts below:Right now, it is apparently 'hip' to really dig this movie, and say you've seen it and loved it.Invariably, as something becomes popular, those among us indeed 'too hip' for their our good will bring things full circle and begin to dislike things for the sake of being contrary.                               'Wouldn't these idiots put down their cameras if they knew they were being hunted?' This is covered in the movie, and quite well I might add - by calling attention to the fact that through a camcorder reality is a tad less harsh. And if you've known any film students (particularly those interested in the Documentary style), then you've seen people who will NOT put the camcorder down. It's not unusual.
'They have done a great job marketing, and limiting theatre access (to get long lines, etc.), but the big joke is, this movie is horrible.'Once again, there is a website. TV ads started late last week and are fairly sparse relatively speaking to major summer blockbusters. They didn't 'limit' theatre access. It was a small, independent film until 2 days ago! Its up to the theaters which movies they want to show. Here in NC, only the tiny arthouses had it the first few nights, then Carmike picked it up at the last second, and the bandwagon jumping commenced. It's not a big joke. This movie is no more hype than any other that comes out nowadays - you just happen to have not enjoyed it.<There is little real story to the movie and suffice to say the movie feels improvised and off the cuff andsubsequently amateurish The movie WAS improvised, off the cuff, and executed by amateurs. What the hell are you talking about?Highly disappointing as it had so much potential but it was just like any other Hollywood movie. Bad plot holesIt wasn't a Hollywood movie. 3) Why sleep in the dark? Bonfire anyone?This is covered in the film as well. After awhile they were assuming that whoever was messing with them was finding them by following the light that their fire created.
1) Follow the stream to civilization. Learn and remember the map before going out to the forest. Take a guideCollege students on a trip seldom plan ahead, study maps, or hire a navigator. This is completely believable. It was obvious towards the middle, however, that the 'evil' was screwing with them, as they used a compass to go directly south yet ended up walking in a circle. Sorry to be so anal and overstated, I'm just excited for the little guy, and for what I believe this film has done for American cinema. It's frustrating to me to watch film snobs nit pick it to pieces.Scott H.",Null,1,1,3 August 1999
