Hereditary," Could have been much better
","I am pretty easy to scare, and while I'm not a fan of slasher movies, I do enjoy the more moody, atmospheric, psychological thriller type of horror. Hereditary seemed to fit the bill, and it did start of very promising. First, the funeral, and then a disturbing turn of events. Then things slowed way down. The director relied heavily on music to set the mood. So much so that for a good portion of the scenes, if the music had been different it could have been a drama about a family trying to come to terms in the aftermath of tragedy. I turned to my husband at one point and said that woman needs to get herself into therapy.As the movie was slowly building up to the climax, most of the things that happened were unsettling and disturbing, but not outright scary. Then in the last 10 or 15 minutes all hell breaks loose. Things escalate and the twist is revealed and all of this information comes fast and out of nowhere. Other reviewers felt the story was not scary, but I disagree. I thought about it a lot over the next few days, and It could have been much more so if the build up was more intense. We should have discovered more clues about the grandmothers secrets in the middle of the movie. I believe another reviewer described the story as undercooked.The cinematography, special effects and acting were all good. It is worth a rental.",7,0,2,17 September 2018
The Favourite," Overhyped, Pretentious Historical Fiction
","Here's something that I've learned about myself, and it has a direct bearing on my enjoyment of a movie, and therefore my review; I do not like the current trend of 'reimagining' actual, historical people with modern sensibilities. I highly doubt Queen Anne and the people in her court went around liberally dropping f bombs. Then there's the ballroom dance scene that my husband called 18th century 'Dancing with the Stars'. Actually that made me laugh, so maybe that's what was meant when it was described as a comedy. Call me uptight, call me old fashioned, I don't care. It bothers me.Basically, Lady Sarah Marlborough, who is an actual ancestor of Sir Winston Churchill and Lady Dianna, was a childhood friend of Queen Anne and a trusted confidant and her personal assistant. She was intelligent, outspoken and did influence the Queen. This is all true. It is also true that her cousin Abigail was a Lady who fell on hard times and was taken in as a servant, and slowly replaced Lady Sarah as the Queens 'favorite'. I did a little light research on all of this and it is believed that Lady Sarah was pushed out because she was outspoken, domineering and blunt, as opposed to Abigail's softer approach. Serious historians 'highly doubt' that any of the women were lesbians or sexually involved. I read that historical movies tell you more about the people that made it than the people and events they portray. Currently the mood in Hollywood is that men are weak and secondary, even when it comes to sex, and it's all about girrl power. That is the perspective this movie takes in telling the story, even though that's not what the reality was for these real people.I gave the stars that I did based on the strength of the actresses and the elaborate costumes and settings.",5,3,5,23 March 2019
Black Panther," Overhyped? Yes, but certainty not a 1
","What is with all of these 1 star reviews? Have these people actually seen a truly terrible movie? Based on production values alone it deserves a minimun of a 5 or 6, and then go from there. I don't often take the time to write reviews, but after reading some of the 1 stars I had to take a moment to say it's entertaining, and frankly no different than all the other Marvrel movies. It's too long and dragged in some spots? They all do. Unbelievable premise? You have a hard time accepting a technologically advanced kingdom hidden in Africa but no problem accepting a Norse God from a distant planet coming to Earth to save the day? Fight scenes use heavy CGI? No duh. Bad acting? Strongly disagree. It's just like any other Marvel movie, Give it a try.",7,2,4,5 September 2018
