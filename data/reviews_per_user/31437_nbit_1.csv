First Man," A little misleading.
",It's mostly my fault that I feel misled by the trailer. I guess I was expecting a little more Apollo 13 or The Right Stuff and less...whatever this was. It was interesting but for me it's not the kind of movie I prefer. It seemed to focus on the type of father or husband that Armstrong was rather than his career which is fine... Just not at all what I was expecting from the trailer. Felt a little like bait & switch.,5,0,0,28 October 2018
