The New World," With only a page of dialog, how great could a movie be?
","Too slow! It I like the History channel meets the nature channel. It is an accurate depiction of that time period. The costumes were great, and the acting,when they talked, was great. But how much can you watch two people look at each other forever 2 hours. It is a good introductory movie for the girl and she played her character wonderfully, however it is upsetting she was not given more dialog. I was expecting more out of this movie. See it if you are really into history because it is accurately and informative about the Virginia settlers. But if you want entertainment definitely reconsider this movie, for you will be VERY disappointed.",3,0,4,12 February 2006
Brokeback Mountain," Didn't live up to the hype......
","Sorry...but this was so boring. I realize that it was some sort of groundbreaking movie....but it would have been better had there not been and extra 20-30 min. When you start to look around the theater at other people thats when you really know the movie is boring. I recommend seeing it because the concept is very moving, but it does get very boring. Ang Lee does create boring movies. I'm almost certain. Heath Ledger has an amazing character as well as Michelle Williams. I do admit it was one of the best screenplays I have seen this year. Just not a good entertainment quality. See it because because it is a movie that all ages and races should see because of the content and the subject matter.",6,6,29,10 February 2006
