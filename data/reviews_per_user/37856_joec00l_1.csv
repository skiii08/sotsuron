The Blair Witch Project," What a piece of crap.
","The only movie I've ever seen that was so bad I was actually p***ed off at the end. The whole thing is an amateur documentary that three teenagers made with a home video camera. Really, there is absolutely no real cinematography in the entire flick. Furthermore, there was no action at all. Not once did you see or hear more than some clicks in the night and some bloody teeth or something outside their tent in the morning. And really that was the only part that seemed like a horror, but since it was filmed so shakily and cheaply, even that part wasn't at all scary or interesting. I could have made this 'movie' with a couple of my friends. It was straight out of MTV's 'Real World' watching them all bickering and swearing at each other. Every night it was the same BS. One 'scene' where they're all scared cause they hear noises. Not at all scary. Not at all entertaining. It's a home video. Every lousy thing you see is shot through one of their two camcorders. And THAT is the movie! It was an interesting tale, but it has no business being in theaters; it belongs in the 'film-maker's' bedrooms to show off to their college buddies. Leave the real films to real film-makers.",1,1,2,9 August 1999
