Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," Dumb and boring
","It's got to be the plot, I think the film bores you into a state that makes it almost impossible to follow its meaningless intricacies as well as giving a confused and abbreviated version of a story that seems to lead nowhere. I suppose it was aimed at children really, though the special effects are nothing to shout about and I think it was a big mistake having Empire soldiers that looked funny rather than scary like stormtroopers.If I remember correctly George Lucas wrote nine books for three films, then realised that one book would fill a film so chose the fourth as the original Star Wars. Probably he chose the best one as well as makes sense. I think he did so well last time with a team that invented photoshop to make the special effects and such whereas in the latest films they're sub par.",1,2,4,18 December 2004
