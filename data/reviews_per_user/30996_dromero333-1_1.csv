The Benchwarmers," better than macaroni
","i've seen it twice already....it took me a few times to thoroughly enjoy napoleon dynamite and its slow humor but now i am a major fan. saying that, Benchwarmers has simple humor that had me rolling throughout the whole movie...its not necessarily a 'baseball' movie so don't expect much more than that, but it is a fun movie with awesome actors that spit out hilarious one liners throughout the movie. it is a nonstop, back and forth battle between the characters that are intending to hurt each others feelings but make you 'almost pee your pants' laughing.....stupid humor..i love it!!!!!! if you love the humor in Sandler movies, you'll love this one....plus its fun to point out the familiar actors he's used in previous movies...",10,1,3,15 April 2006
