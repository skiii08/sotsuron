The Avengers," Joss Whedon is a genius!
","Joss Whedon is a genius! The ability to bring this cast and these characters together, and actually make a pretty phenomenal movie is a tremendous accomplishment. But even more than that, he was able to finally make 'the Hulk' true to his comic book character (i.e. funny, and bad ass); he even made dull Captain America and Thor entertaining; but the true star of the film has to be Robert Downey Jr.!!!!! Without his comic relief in the first 2/3 of this film, this movie would have bombed miserably. I understand the importance of character development, but it's Tony Stark (Downey) who steals the show, and makes the film bearable.Kudos to Scarlett Johansson, her role as Black Widow, was really a thing of beauty. Strong female roles are hard to find in Hollywood, much less play with true abandonment; however, Johansson shines on the screen as the kick-ass siren. With any good action adventure, an evil antagonist, equally as wicked as his counterparts are good, must be pertinent to the film's plot to be a successful film. In this case, Tom Hiddleston reprises his role as Loki (Thor's evil half brother), as cements his role as screen villain extraordinaire.However, the crowning part of the whole film has to be the film's final 30 minutes. The ending battle of good vs evil is fantastic! The many one-liners come fast and furiously, and the action sequences are out of this world (literally)!!! At a cost of $220 million to make, you can definitely see it up on the screen! I am sure with salaries, percentage payoff to the actors and director (Josh Whedon); that it will be a very long time before Paramount sees any profits to this film; moreover, gathering all these stars again for a sequel is also highly unlikely. So enjoy this very entertaining bit of nostalgia while you can I highly recommend seeing this film; I would even suggest paying the additional cost to see it in IMAX. I am sure the ending battle sequence will be more that worth the cost of admission!!! The summer has started off with a BANG, let's hope the momentum continues!!!

Men in Black 3," Josh Brolin Rocks his Role!!!!!
","I actually enjoyed this film way more than I thought I would, and 100% of the credit goes to Jermaine Clement (Boris the Animal) and Josh Brolin (as a young Tommy Lee Jones).In this iteration of the trilogy, Will Smith (Agent J) has to time travel back to 1960s in order to save Tommy Lee Jones (Agent K) life. But unlike previous films in this series, the villain in this film is truly a force to be reckoned with, and Jermaine Clement plays his role stupendously!!! However, not to be upstaged, as Agent J (Smith) time travels to the past, he is reunited with a younger, not yet curmudgeon Agent K in a wonderful interpretation by Josh Brolin!!!! The 60s make for a great setting in this film from the sixties monsters to the 1960 technology!!! The dialog is well scripted; plot works; and the villain is truly formidable!!!I can recommend this film, good wholesome fun! If you are a fan of the series, this film does not disappoint! If not, it might be worth your time to rent or Netflix!SEE MORE OF MY REVIEWS ON FB @ 'THE FARIS REEL'",7,2,5,11 June 2012
The Expendables 2," 100% Male Testosterone!!!!
","This film is definitely a guilty pleasure!! I have to admit I had a smile on my face as I watched the likes of Stallone, Statham, Van Damme, Jet Li, Lundgren, Chuck Norris, Bruce Willis and AR-NULD all together back up on the screen!!! Is what I am watching absolutely ridiculous? YES! Highly improbable? UNEQUIVOCALLY! Completely fictitious in every possible way? UNDENIABLY!!! However, was I being entertained? INDUBITABLY!!!In this iteration of the Stallone franchise, Barney Ross (Stallone), and his merry men of mercenaries are dispatched to retrieve an access key and location to a stockpile of Russian plutonium, which was part of the payload that went down in a plane crash. However, once they attain the access key, they are immediately ambushed by a terrorist organization that also have their sights on the Russian plutonium supply. There is nothing original being brought to the screen in this film; it's just 100% male testosterone smash 'em up action with a touch of adrenaline rush!! But what I really enjoyed is how director Simon West (Con Air / The Mechanic) was able to showcase each individual action icon in their own featured hi-lighted action sequenceÂ… my favorite being the 'Chuck Norris' sequence by far!! I had not paid that much attention to all the stars who had signed on for this action epic, so as the smoke cleared and Chuck Norris appeared, it was an unexpected pleasure!!! Again, this film is far from Oscar worthiness; however, it's exactly what you would come to expect in your circa 1980-90's action adventure genre. So I can and do highly recommend this film, and I am happy to report that the pre-production for 'The Expendables 3' is already underway!!! So sit back and relax, and enjoy action adventure genre as it was intended to be seen!!! SEE MORE OF MY REVIEWS ON FB @ 'THE FARIS REEL'",7,2,2,28 October 2012
The Longest Yard," See the Original
","A remake of the 1974 classic The Longest Yard, this film features Adam Sandler, Chris Rock, and Burt Reynolds in a cons versus guards knockdown, drag-out, bare-knuckles brawl football game. However, if you've seen the original, you've already seen this film as well, but done much better.The film centers around Paul Crewe (played by Sandler, but made famous by Reynolds), a former football all-star professional quarterback, who was forced to leave the sport after allegations of points-shaving surfaced. The film opens several years after the allegations, and Crewe is a kept-man. Forced jump at his girlfriend's every beckon call; Crewe flees their home intoxicated in his girlfriend's Bentley. A high-speed pursuit ensues, the car is totaled, and Crewe is incarcerated in a federal prison for three years.The warden of the prison is an avid football fan, and the prison has its own semi-professional team. The warden wants Crewe to coach his team; however, the guards would prefer that he not. Stuck between a rock and a hard place, Crewe eventually agrees to assemble an all-convict team to scrimmage against the guards; with one catch, Crewe has to play quarterback.What a difference thirty years make. In the original, you could almost believe this premise. The film was set in some work-release prison in the bayous of the south, with chain gangs, and southern drawls; where you could almost feel the heat and desperation the convicts not to mention their total resentment toward the guards. In this remake, the conviction just isn't present; plus, I really find it exceedingly hard to believe that any state would sanction this game, much less it being televised on ESPN.Anyways, I highly recommend watching the original, rather than this 21st century reincarnation of the same. However, if you feel the need to see Adam Sandler in a football film, defer to his hilariously funny The Waterboy! http://farisreel.com",4,4,7,12 June 2005
Abraham Lincoln: Vampire Hunter," A very warped, and deranged re-telling of our U.S. History
","An interesting conception; however, not without it's faults. This movie is part History Channel, part Vampire flick, part 'Matrix' meets 'Couching Tiger, Hidden Dragon; and definitely worth the price of admission.The story tells the tale of how a young Abraham Lincoln, lost his mother to a vengeful act of retribution from a vampire slave owner. Bound and determined to settle of score of his mother's death, Abraham inadvertently uncovers the secret world of vampires living amongst the human populace of 1861. Henry seeks solace and training from a fellow vampire hunter, Henry Sturgesss, played wonderfully by Dominic Cooper.It seems that with every reincarnation of a new vampire film, Hollywood can take liberties with what a vampire can and cannot do; and this film is no different. In this film, Vampire can exist in daylight; have the ability to disappear from sight, and can only be killed with silver (and not a wooden stake to the heart). However, once converted into a vampire, you cannot take the life of another vampire; only the living can kill a vampire.I have to admit that I did enjoy the fact that the film was set in 1861-66; the cinematography was an enhancement to the film's noir and mystique. Benjamin Walker made a wonderful ax-wielding 16th president; and once the beard was added, he was the spitting image of Honest Abe.The film opens and closes with the following passage: 'History prefers legends, to men. It prefers nobility, to brutality. Soaring speeches, to quiet deeds. History remembers the battle, but forgets the blood. However history remembers me - - before I was a president - it shall only remember a fraction of the truth.' This is to ensure to the audience, that the fact that you are about to witness are true and factual; however, 'We, the people of the United States', have elected to only concentrate on Abe Lincoln's Presidential feats, and not the fact that the Confederacy had teamed up with the Vampire factions in order to save their food supply.A very warped, and deranged re-telling of our U.S. History; however, a quite original reinterpretation as well. Definitely not for everyone; however, if watched with an opened mind, it will be much more enjoyable. A half-hearted recommendation. So enjoy this film with slight reservations, and remember to always have a contingency plan!!!!! SEE MORE OF MY REVIEWS ON FB @ 'THE FARIS REEL'",6,1,2,30 June 2012
The Hunger Games," Loved the Book, A Great Adaptation!!!!!
","The Hunger Games (**** out of 5) - The loved the books, and the movie was true to the story!!!! An excellent adaptation. The movie was dead on, except for a few minor deviations; first being that the mayor's daughter gave Katniss the Mockingjay pin and not Prim..... but a minor point. The movie fulfill my every whim.... though I was expecting Cenna (Lenny Kravis) to be a little more flamboyant....lol!!!! My most anticipated scene was when the tributes... are first introduced in the Capitol.... from the book, the flaming costumes of peter and Katniss were remarkably described, and again the film did not disappoint. A small scene that must ended up on the cutting room floor, but which I enjoyed in the book, was when the loaf of bread from District 11 was delivered to Katniss and Peter; after Rune had passed. But all in all, two thumbs way up!!!! A fantastic film, a phenomenal book..... an incredible night out..... This film will not disappoint even the most avid fan!!!! I highly recommend!!!!!

The Impossible," Phenonemal but Forced....
","First and foremost, I would like to state beforehand that I cannot even begin to imagine the pain, devastation, and anguish that the Belón family must have endured during this most heinous event. This is truly an incredible story of survival, in which I highly recommend seeing; however, I do have some serious reservations as to the 'deliberate' emotion-seeking story telling techniques that director Juan Antonio Bayona and writer Sergio G. Sanchez decided to use in order to tell this tale of woe.'The Impossible' is the 'based on true events' story of the Bennett (Belón) family. Maria Bennett (Naomi Watts) and her husband Henry (Ewan McGregor) and their three sons Lucas (Tom Holland), Tomas and Simon were on holiday over Christmas at a tropical paradise resort in Khao Lak, Thailand. An error with their third floor reservations got them upgraded to an oceanfront bungalow; however, it is curious to surmise if this was a spot of good luck or just one of life's awful twists of fate. While relaxing poolside on December 26, 2004, the Bennett (Belón) family was present during one of Thailand's most devastating natural disasters, the 2004 tsunami , which ravaged and leveled most of coastal area in which they were residing. The painstaking details that director Bayona goes through to recreate this catastrophic ordeal is absolutely mind-bogglingly. Again, I am more than confident that this reinterpretation of this ungodly event pales in comparison to its actual occurrence. However, director Bayona does portray the calamitous, perilous, inauspicious aftermath of the devastated Thailand coastal area quite effectively, and the days that followed even more so...However, here is where I am torn between being the completely immersed audience member awestruck by the events which are being presented to me versus super sensitive critic who is highly skeptical to this Hollywood retelling of this most hideous tribulation. Granted, this had to be an arduous experience; but I definitely feel that director Bayona pulled out all the stops in order to 'milk' the most impassioned audience reactions. Here are some examples of what I mean: (1) possibly one of the most touching moments in this film, is when 12 year old Lucas Bennett is able to reunite a father and son in the Thailand Hospital in which his mother has been taken to. However, this brief moment of joy in this most tumultuous place is ripped from the audience's beguilement as Lucas runs to tell his mother what he has done, only to find an empty bed and the thought that she had passed away. (2) The film's climatic scene in which the Bennett family: father, brothers, mother are finally reunited plays out like an Abbot and Costello routine with all the near misses of each other, retracing the exact same footsteps as the previous lost individual, the just oh so nearly seeing each other only to have the other turn at the exact moment as the individual walks out of sight. The intensity is supposed to build until the entire family finally find each other; however, the scene is so 'intentionally' drawn out and overly dramatic that it actually (almost) becomes comical. (3) However, my most disturbing sequence of the entire film has to be the closing sequence (which was possibly the most true scene of the film). Obviously the Bennet (Belón) family was a very affluent, well to do family. So as the family has been finally been reunified, and the mother (Maria) has successfully undergone surgery, the family is whisked away on a private jet to Singapore. Here my issue whether it's true or not (which I tend to believe actually did happen as shown on screen), the image of this family departing Thailand alone on an empty airplane in which they are the sole occupants, when hundreds maybe thousands of others were sitting there at that same airport in distress was just disheartening. Not an image that I would have decided to end this movie on.I know this review sounds harsh, and I apologize; however, I do still recommend seeing this film. It is truly a testament to the human survival proclivity, and I cannot begin to even phantom the despair and anguish endured by this family. I would like to add that I am sure that I would not have enjoyed reliving this experience by deciding to bring this abominable life incident to the big screen as Mrs. María Belón Alvárez elected to do either... but I digress. Rent this movie, enjoy this movie, recant my observations... but I am positive that my review comments will resonate in your mind as you watch it!!!! This film absolutely has a 'forced' feeling undertone to it.See more of my reviews on FB @ 'The Faris Reel'",6,0,1,30 January 2013
Argo," With ARGO, the Award Season has begun!!!!!
","'Argo' is the first legitimate Academy Award Best Picture nominee of the season. This movie is edge-of-your-seat intense. Kudos to Ben Affleck for directing a truly magnificent film. I just finished watching this movie, and I am absolutely whipped emotionally; my fingernail have been gnawed to the quick, and all I can think about right now is how I want to find out everything there is to know about this C.I.A. rescue mission. I am completely in awe with how much I truly enjoyed this motion picture.In November 1979, as the US Embassy in Tehran, Iran, fell and the Iran Hostage Crisis commenced, six US Embassy employees were actually able to make it out of the US Embassy, and sought refuge in the home of the Canadian Ambassador. For almost two (2) months, these six (6) individuals laid in hiding at the Ambassador home before it got too risky for them to remain, and the C.I.A was called on to devise an exit strategy to get these individuals out of the country. The best 'bad idea' by far was Operation Argo. The C.I.A. would finance a Middle East Sci-Fi motion picture, complete with storyboards, script, press releases, etc. in order to allow one of their agents to pose as a Canadian Film Executive Producer. His mission would be to slip into Iran with the premise of scouting possible shooting sites for his film. Once in Iran, he would contact the six (6) US refugees and issue them fake Canadian dossiers, fake Canadian passports, and fake Canadian film credentials (i.e. – director, producer, writer, cameraman, etc.). The name of the film was called 'ARGO'.Again, the intensity of the film is startling!! The scenes are well acted, well written, and impressively shot. Ben Affleck is a force to be reckoned with for his performance in front and behind the camera. And enough cannot be said about the writers Chris Terrio and Joshuah Bearman, whom I am sure, will also be well acknowledged and rewarded in this upcoming award season. Phenomenal performances by the films supporting cast as well, which included John Goodman as John Chambers, Alan Arkin as Lester Siegel, and Bryan Cranston as Jack O'Donnell. John Goodman's character John Chambers was awarded the C.I.A.'s highest civilian accommodation for his actions in this mission in real life.GO SEE THIS FILM!!!! By far the best films to come out of Hollywood this year!!! I highly recommend this film. I love watching movies, and I REALLY LOVE watching GOOD MOVIES. This is without a doubt, a very excellent film. But do not take my word for it, go see it for yourself! SEE MORE OF MY REVIEWS ON FB @ 'THE FARIS REEL'",10,11,23,9 November 2012
Madagascar," Wait for the DVD
","Ben Stiller, Chris Rock, David Schwimmer, and Jada Pinkett Smith all star in this newest computer generated film from Dreamworks Studios. The film centers around four animals (Alex the Lion, Marty the Zebra, Melman the Giraffe, and Gloria the Hippo) held captive in a New York state zoo. Though none of them are mistreated, but rather, very heavily pampered; Marty (Rock) dreams of being free in the wild.The film opens with Marty celebrating his 10th birthday, which orchestrates a middle life crisis for him. He has been raised in the zoo all his life, and his birthday wish is to depart the zoo. His wishes are further strengthened when a group of penguins, who are also in the midst of an escape, accidental burrow into Marty's pen. The penguins are by far the best thing this film has to offer, and steal every scene their in. I could have easily watched an entire film the penguins escapades, but alas, it wasn't meant to be.Marty hears of a magical place called 'Connecticut' and upon the zoo's closing, he flees the zoo to find his paradise. After discovering his absents, his friends: Alex (Stiller), Melman (Schwimmer), and Gloria (Smith) follow after him. All four are soon captured, but instead of being returned to the zoo, they are crated up and sent to Africa.As computer generated films go, this film isn't the greatest; however, it's not the worst either. The film just seems to go through the motions of being a film. After viewing it, there is nothing that seems to stick in your mind worth remembering. I guess what tickled me the most, was at the beginning of the film I was saying to myself, 'Wow, a lion and a zebra are friends (one carnivore and one herbivore)'; to my surprise, this ends up playing a very pivotal plot point in the film.I really feel that there is nothing to gain by rushing out to see this film, I'd just wait for its DVD release.http://farisreel.com",5,0,1,11 June 2005
Ted," Gawd Awful!!!
","I just do not get it!!! This movie is just plain awful, and yet it is breaking box office records for 'R-rated' comedies. With a running time of 98 mins, I could only manage to sit through the first 40 minutes before turning off this unfunny, quite boring, and quite disappointing film.The premise of this film is quite simple. At the age of eight (8) years old and with no real friends of his own, little John Bennett (Mark Wahlberg) makes a Christmas wish for his teddy bear to come to life. Ted and John become life long friends ('thunder buddies'); however, after twenty-seven (27) years of friendship, John must decide on either staying with his girlfriend of four (4) years Lori (Mila Kunis) or Ted.Ted is the brainchild of Seth MacFarlane (Family Guy / American Dad) and he voices Ted as well. Ted has no redeeming qualities, and is combination of the two characters Quagmire and Brian from the Family Guy TV series. He's a pot-smoking, hooker dating, grocery clerk humping, foul mouth Neanderthal, who Lori (Kunis) feels is preventing her and John from having the adult relationship that she so desires to have.In the 40 minutes that I managed to sit through, I never laughed, smirked, grinned or even hinted to a gesture of happiness to any of the 'so-called' comedy being presented on screen because there wasn't any there!!!! Unless you consider a foul-mouth, pot smoking teddy bear as being funny, which I did not. However, the scene in which I could take no more, is when Ted, while working as a clerk out clerk in a local grocery store gets caught 'bopping' another check out clerk in the store room, and explains to his boss that, 'Last week he screwed her with a parsnip and sold the parsnip to a family of four'  so his boss promoted him. IS THAT FUNNY?????? REALLY??? God, I feel like my dad now, I must be getting old!!!! Anyways, the film is making money hand over fist, and has already crossed the $100 million, and expected to cross the $200 million mark by summer's end. I JUST DO NOT GET IT!!!!!! I cannot recommend this film, I cannot even finish watching this film. It's being marketed as this year's 'The Hangover', and I can assure you it is nowhere as funny as the 'The Hangover'. I would say avoid at all costs but who am I???? SEE MORE OF MY REVIEWS ON FB @ 'THE FARIS REEL'",1,285,522,11 July 2012
Rise of the Guardians," 'Wreck It, Ralph' is better!!!!
","A really interesting concept for a movie, with an incredible ensemble of talent to provide the voices; however, this film pales in comparison to other animated films currently in the theaters. I enjoyed this film; however, 'Wreck It, Ralph' was far more superior on almost every scale imaginable (plot, humor, content, graphics, nostalgia, etc).The 'Guardians' are a group of immortals comprised of North (Santa Claus) voiced by Alec Baldwin, Bunny (The Easter Bunny) voiced by Hugh Jackman, Tooth (The Tooth Fairy) voiced by Isla Fisher, and Sandy (The Sandman) who gestures rather than speaks. Their whole existence on the planet is the protection the children of the planet; however, they can only exist if the children of the world still believe in them. Once the children no longer believe that a Guardian is real, their facade, magical powers and abilities will diminish, and start to fade away.The villain of this film is Pitch Black (voiced by Jude Law). He is the keeper of nightmares. He once reigned supreme during the Dark Ages; however, the 'Guardians' have been able to keep him under control for several centuries. Pitch has been able to strengthen his powers by manipulating the dream powers of Sandy, The Sandman. His goal is to methodically zap the powers of each 'Guardian' one-by-one, by having the children of the world start to doubt their existence; while simultaneously getting his presence into their mindset thus making him a stronger force to be reckon with. Once Pitch Black destroys the 'Guardian' alliance, the children of the world will be at his mercy.Perhaps the two (2) best things that this film has going it are Santa (North) and the Easter Bunny (Bunny). Both are great characters. The scenes showing North, his Yeti staff (which actually do all the work at the North Pole), and his incompetent elves (which I just adored); is simply genius. The rivalry between North and Bunny is great comedic levity, and adds much candor to the storyline and plot. Making Bunny a 6-foot tall, boomerang-throwing Australian accented entity was an interesting choice.The decision of Dreamworks to release this first film during the Holiday Season is questionable at best, because this film is in no way a holiday movie. The timeframe for this film is three (3) days prior to Easter I can only assume that Dreamworks felt that having a movie poster featuring Santa on it would lure family audiences into the theater seats. So be warned, this film really has nothing to do with Christmas!!!! Again, this is not a bad film; however, it's not a great film either. I would wait, and save seeing this film for home viewing. I'd much rather pay to see 'Wreck It, Ralph' a second time than suggest that you spend your hard earned money to pay and see 'Rise of the Guardians' in theaters. Just my personal opinion.See more of my Reviews on FB @ 'The Faris Reel'",5,2,8,2 December 2012
Midnight in Paris," Very Woody-esque
","Movie Review: 'Midnight in Paris' – A very quaint and uncomplicated romantic comedy featuring Owen Wilson as Gil Pender, a successful American screen writer, visiting Paris with his fiancée and her parents. Gil has an infatuation with Paris, specifically Paris of the 1920s; and would prefer nothing more than to give up his Hollywood lifestyle to settle down in Paris and finish his novel. After a night out on the town with his fiancée and her friends, Gil excuses himself to head back to the hotel. However, due to a poor sense of direction and excess alcohol indulgence, Gil (lost) finds himself on the steps of a church as the clock chimes midnight. As he stares at the streets in search of a taxi, a late model car comes to his rescue. The passengers in the car talk Gil into coming to a party with them. It's at this party where Gil comes to the realization that he's been whisked into Paris circa 1920, and he's now face to face with the likes of Cole Porter, F. Scott Fitzgerald, Ernest Hemingway, Salvador Dali, and many, many others Night after night, he continues to return to the steps, and the antique vehicle always appears at the stroke of midnight. As he continues to enjoy basking in the past, he soon realizes that the people of the 20s long for an earlier time of their past as well. It's this awareness that returns him to the present for good. Directed by Woody Allen, it very Woody-esque. Beautifully filmed, Paris makes a wonderful backdrop for this film! Perfectly cast, Owen Wilson plays his role flawlessly. I was actually drawn into the story, and (like Gil) found Paris 1920 way more interesting than present day Paris. Though I am not a huge fan of Woody Allen, I really enjoyed this film.",7,0,1,12 February 2012
Hotel Rwanda," A Must See film!
","This is one of the better films that I have seen lately, and well deserving of the Academy Award nominations that it received. The film stars Don Cheadle portraying Paul Rusesabagina in a role in which he was nominated for Best Actor, also well deserved. The story is a retelling of the true events which occurred in 1994 during a Rwandan uprising which the Tutsi population of Rwanda was almost annihilated by the Hutu militia.Paul Rusesabagina (Cheadle) is a hard working Hutu, who serves as the Hotel Manager of a Belgian five-star hotel, the Hotel Milles Collines, in Rwanda. He is married to Tatiana, a Tutsi, played by Sophie Okonedo. Paul lives in a neighbor populated by both Hutu and Tutsi. As the movie begins, tensions are rising as altercations between Hutu militia and Tutsi rebels escalate. Rumors start circulating about a possible Tutsi coup, as Hutu military soldiers begin rounding up possible Tutsi spies in Paul's neighborhood.A full fledge genocidal war against the Tutsi population is ignited when the plane with the Rwandan President, a Hutu, is shot down by Tutsi rebels only hours after a peace treaty between the Hutu militia and Tutsi rebels is signed. Paul's neighborhood as well as much of Rwanda becomes the battle ground for the war, where only bribery, blackmail, and payoffs are your only survival.Paul is able to get his family and a van full of neighbors back to his Hotel in hopes that United Nations soldiers will protect these refugees. However, just the opposite becomes apparent. The U.N. soldiers are forced to take no stand on the situation before them. What's even worst, at one point of the film, the U.N. forces arrive at Paul's hotel in mass only to help to evacuate the European guests stranded there, thus leaving behind the Rwanda refugees to fend for themselves without any protection whatsoever.Paul becomes a one-man army whose only mission is to save the lives of these people. He is forced to plead to foreign nationals, manipulate generals, bribe the Hutu militia, and grovel to U.N. peace-keepers. He is willing to do whatever it takes in order to keep the atrocities, which are occurring just outside his hotel compounds, from entering their confines.This story is brutally told; it's both gripping and ghastly. Director Terry George pulls no punches; and emotions run rampant as scenes such as 'the U.N. forces departure leaving Rwandan refugees behind at the hotel' just tears at the heart. It's a story of how one man overcomes insurmountable odds to make a difference, and it's graphically depicted. Again, this film is not for the squeamish; however, I highly recommend seeing it. http://farisreel.com",8,0,0,16 April 2005
21 Jump Street," I liked it, I really really liked it.....
","Though I am not a huge fan of old TV series being turned into movies, and I am definitely not a fan of actor Channing Tatum... I have to say that everything in this film works!!!! The casting of Jonah Hill and Channing Tatum as two bumbling cops forced to go undercover as high school students was a good idea which I would have never thought of in a hundred years; however, the truly genius twist was to make Hill (Schmidt - the smart guy) the popular kid and Tatum (Jenko - the ex-jock) the nerdy geek. The scenes are funny, and well written. The plot of the film centers on an illegal drug ring in a local high school, in which out two heroes must infiltrate to uncover the drug's source and dealers. However, the best scene of the film has to be the cameo appearances of the show's original cast members at the film's climax, it was truly unexpected. Ice Cube was a brilliant choice for Captain Dickson, and plays the hard-ass Jump Street Team Chief with reckless abandonment. Directors Phil Lord and Chris Miller's plan to make this film into a comedy was a stroke of genius as well; while both Hill and Tatum compliment each other's acting style really well. Kudos to all involved, I highly recommend this film and found it quite enjoyable. SEE MORE OF MY REVIEWSAT 'THE FARIS REEL' ON FACEBOOK.",7,2,3,9 April 2012
Oblivion," A very average SCI Fi film
","Even from the opening monologue of this film, you can tell that there is something just not quite right with the information that is being presented to the audience. The year is 2077. Fifty (50) years prior an alien invasion force known simply as 'The Scavengers' or just plain 'Scavs' destroyed the Earth's moon causing catastrophic global nature disasters (i.e. – earthquakes, tidal waves, tsunamis, etc.). Cities were toppled, worldwide panic and chaos followed, then the alien invasion commenced. In order to fight off the alien attackers, the world nuclear arsenal was dispatched. The War was won, but the planet was lost due to nuclear contamination leaving most of the planet uninhabitable. What was let of humanity was forced to leave the planet, and colonized on Titan, Saturn's largest moon.Jack Harper (Tom Cruise) is Tech 49, one of the last few humans stationed on the planet. He lives in a tower thousands of feet above the Earth where he and his communications officer and lover Victoria (Andrea Riseborough) are part of an operation to extract the planet's remaining resources, especially water. Jack and Victoria maintain contact with civilization via a video link with their commander, Sally (Melissa Leo), and are due to join the rest of humanity on Titan in two weeks. Assisting Jack in his work are weaponized 'drones', airborne machines that scour the landscape to destroy the remaining alien resistance.Five years prior the government mandated mandatory memory wipes; however, Jack is suffering from recurring dreams and flashbacks of New York before the invasion and an unknown woman. This is quite peculiar given that New York was destroyed some fifty (50) years prior, and in the dreams Jack is an adult. Even more strange is this highly expansive and elaborate drone system that was erected to defend a devastated and abandoned planet. However, things really start to get interesting when 'the scavs' activate a homing beacon and a spaceship containing human bodies in stasis crash lands on the planet.I have nothing negative to say with regards to 'Oblivion'. The film was fine. However, is 'fine' what you are looking for when you are going to see a Sci Fi film??? I THINK NOT!!! There is nothing (forgive the pun) 'EARTH-SCATTERING' about this film. The story is fine, the plot twist works, the acting and on screen chemistry are okay. But I did not leave this film thinking to myself, 'OMG, THAT WAS AWESOME!!!!' It was more like 'Oh, okay, yeah that seems to explain everything.' I'm sure this weekend this film will do stellar business; however, I believe word-of-mouth will bring sharp declines in the following week's receipts. For those of you planning to see this film regardless of this review, do yourself a favor and see it during the Matinée Bargain showings. I would actually suggest waiting for its release to DVD or On DEMAND. Again, this is not a HORRENDOUS film; but it is a quite AVERAGE film.",5,3,7,17 April 2013
Silver Linings Playbook," A terrific, highly original film with exceptional performances!!!
","Kudos to writer/director David O. Russell (The Fighter / Three Kings) for doing an exceptional job getting extraordinary performances from his stellar cast. This is a film which has done the impervious task of securing Academy Award Nominations in every acting category, a feat that has been accomplished since Warren Beatty's 'Reds' in 1981, and the first film to receive four acting nominations since 2008's 'Doubt.' The writing is brilliant, and the acting is radiant as Bradley Cooper (Patrick) and Jennifer Lawrence (Tiffany) light up the screen in this very original, highly entertaining romantic comedy. I really believe that Academy will reward David O. Russell for his Adapted screenplay of the Matthew Quick novel 'Silver Linings'.Jennifer Lawrence is definitely deserving of her Academy Nomination and Golden Globe win for Best Actress as Tiffany Maxwell in this film. A role I would have never imagined that this 'Hunger Games' star could ever pull off, Lawrence proves that she is a force to be reckoned on the Hollywood scene and a certified 'A' list actress for this performance. The Tiffany Maxwell character is a certified nut case. Coping with the recent death of her police officer husband, Tiffany resorts to sex to cope with her stress.Equally unparalleled is Bradley Cooper's performance as Patrick. Again, a role I would have never expected Cooper to be able to accomplish. The Patrick character is an undiagnosed bi-polar individual with moods swings and delusions brought on by severe stress, or in other words, 'he's cuckoo for cocoa puffs'!!! As the film opens, Patrick has been incarcerated the past 8 months in a psychiatric facility after he inadvertently walked in on his wife having an affair. To round out this delicious cast of miscreants is Robert de Niro as Patrick's dad, Pat Sr. The Patrick Sr character is an obsessive compulsive disorder (OCD) suffering die-hard Philadelphia Eagles fan, who is tremendously superstitious and has recently lost his job and pension. In order to make ends meet, Patrick Sr runs a book-making operation from his home. He has also been permanently banned from all Philadelphia Eagles home games due to an altercation in which he started a fight within the confines of the stadium. I really believe that the Academy Award for Best Supporting Actor is a two horse race between De Niro (Silver Linings Playbook) and Tommy Lee Jones (Lincoln), both performances are worthy of their nominations.I would like to acknowledge some very noteworthy cameo appearances in this film from Chris Tucker (who really needs to have David O. Russell direct him in a full fledge film). Tucker was funny, entertaining, and a joy to watch on screen. Also Julia Stiles role as Veronica (Tiffany's sister) was another fantastic performance, and Stiles never has looked more beautiful on screen.My only drawback to this whole film would have to be the film's climax. After 110 minutes of some really great dialog, plot twists, some pure lunacy, and some really great acting. I feel that David O. Russell, just kind of phoned the film's climax in. The last 12 minutes of this film culminate at a Philadelphia Dance event in which Tiffany has wanted to enter all her life. We not talking 'barnyard' prom dance of 'Footloose', or 'resort talent show' dance of 'Dirty Dancing', but full fledge 'Dancing with the Stars' Ballroom competitive professional Dancing. A sequence painful to watch; both Cooper and Lawrence were uncomfortable at best on the dance floor and I literally cringed during their pinnacle 'lift' move which had Jennifer crouch area awkwardly situated in/on/at Cooper's face (it really reminded me of the 'Police Squad' movies sequences where Leslie Neilson would have OJ Simpson's crouch in his face for comedic relief) to make matters even worst, the recovery move was equally excruciating to endure. However, I digressAgain, I truly enjoyed this film. I highly recommend seeing this very original film with fantastic performances from a stellar cast. Well deserving of all the pre-season award nomination accolades/attention that it is receiving.",8,1,4,15 January 2013
Hansel & Gretel: Witch Hunters," A tad bit amusing...
","Hopefully this film will put an end to all these Hollywood fairy tale, live action monstrosities. From 'Mirror, Mirror' to 'Snow White and the Huntsman' from 'Grimm' to 'Once Upon A Time' it's really almost comical how every other studio in Hollywood will initiate similar projects once one studio decides to 'greenlight' a certain genre of film. This film is certainty not the worst of the bunch; however, the mish-mash of fantasy, action adventure, shoot 'em up genres with questionable date appropriate weapon usage emphatically left me perplexed while watching this film.His film stars Jeremy Renner as Hansel; coming off a hugely successful year with 'The Bourne Legacy' and 'The Avengers', I am positive that this film will not add much credibility to his acting body of work. Furthermore, it is interesting to note that in an interview at Cannes in 2011with Famke Janssen (the film's nemesis Muriel); she stated that she only took her role as the head witch because she had to pay off her mortgage.Based on the children's tale in which two children, siblings (brother & sister) are abandoned in the forest by their father and then stumble upon a witch's cottage made totally of candy. Hansel and Gretel's reputation of conquering Witch Hunters is catapulted to legendary status as they successfully annihilate children abducting witches throughout all the lands. It seems that that the two siblings have become immune to witch's hexes, which is somehow associated to their initial witch eradication as children.This is not an awful film, and I have to admit that I actually enjoyed the incredibly violent, morbidly grotesque, and extremely graphic murder death sequences that this film excelled at generating. From decapitations to drawn and quartering, this film certainly wasted no expense to visually articulating its ghastly tale of the wickedly macabre. If more time could have been taken with regards to plot, script, and CGI effects; this film could have possibly been just a tab bit more palatable. However, with all that said, I am actually going to give a lukewarm recommendation to see that film. Definitely worth the price of renting, this film will easily appease those sick and twisted viewers out there who enjoy nothing more than a good 'tree trunk to the face' head explosion, or better yet, a horde of witches diced into bite size morsels as they are chased into a piano wire mesh entrapment. Again this is not award winning caliber acting; however, it is moderately amusing.See more of my reviews on FB @ 'The Faris Reel'",5,2,6,4 February 2013
Django Unchained," Tarantino Goes Western!!!
","I really have to believe that if Quentin Tarantino and I had actually lived near one another as we were growing up, we would have probably been great friends; or at least seen each other attending the same movies. I know this sound utterly prosperous, but in his recent film 'Django Unchained', he has really added some great 'spaghetti western' homage moments from some very obscure films which included movie scores from 'Two Mules for Sister Sara' (Clint Eastwood / Shirley MacLaine) and 'My Name is Trinity' (Terence Hill / Bud Spencer); two films in which I utterly adore. I love a good Western, and Tarantino does not disappoint with his interpretation of this genre. Returning for his second Tarantino film after his Academy Award Winning performance in 'Inglorious Basterds', Christopher Waltz is Dr. Schultz, a former dentist turned bounty hunter. He is in pursuit of three (3) ruthless brothers; however, he needs the assistance of a runaway slave, Django (played by Jamie Fox), to identify his criminal quarry. After recovering his reward bounty, Dr. Schultz (Waltz) reaches a mutual agreement with Django (Fox) to maintain their partnership throughout the winter, and in return Dr. Schultz will assist Django in finding his wife whose whereabouts are somewhere deep in the heart of Dixie. Under Dr. Schultz's tutelage, Django is able to hone his skills as a bona fide bounty hunter and gunslinger in his own right.Director Tarantino is a skilled story-teller. Whether it's a botched bank heist or a vampire diner from hell, Tarantino's filmmaking esthetic is easily identifiable. No one in the industry can show a bullet piercing flesh, and the blood splatter associated with that infliction better than Quentin Tarantino and I can assure you, that blood splatter budget was not scrimped on in the production of this film. From the opening sequence to the ending credits, this film screams Tarantino. Even his five (5) minute cameo in this film is so over-the-top, it's easily remembered and will be often referred to.This film has an all-star cast featuring the likes of Leonardo DiCaprio, Jamie Foxx, Samuel L. Jackson, and Christopher Waltz; and a production budget of $100 Million dollars. This film has everything that you have come to expect in a Quentin Tarantino film: awesome gunfight sequences, blood-shed galore, great story telling, and what I'd like to refer to as a 'Blazing Saddles'-esque comedy sequence referring to pillow-case hoods and eye-hole placement that is absolutely hilarious!!!This is a MUST SEE film for enthusiasts of the Western genre or fans of Quentin Tarantino, I highly recommend this film. Running 165 minutes in length, the film flows effortlessly. I was actually shocked at how long the film was after it had finished, because I had not referred my watch once while watching it. Another Tarantino accolade to great filmmaking and keeping the audience fully engaged and entertained. Again this is not your father's typical Western; it's a Tarantino interpretation of a Western. It's 'Pulp Fiction' meets 'A Fistful of Dollars' with all the Tarantino artistic brutality thrown in to heighten your visual viewing experience. So view this film with caution, and revel in your memories of your Saturday Matinée film jaunts of your youth brought into the 21st Century with a Quentin Tarantino graphic embellishment.

Lincoln," Spielberg is a GENIUS!!!!!
","This is the type of film that the members of the Academy of Motions Pictures just fawn over. It's a period piece, historical in nature, well written, wonderfully filmed, a star-studded ensemble cast, and superiorly acted. This film will be well rewarded in the upcoming award season. Even though this was truly an unbelievable film, (for me) there seemed to be something missing that hint of intensity / drama / chutzpah that changes a really good film into a really great movie. Please do not get me wrong, do I feel that this film should be shown in every American History class across the United States ABSOLUTELY!!! However, being an avid movie watcher who enjoys viewing the same film numerous times; I am not so that this film is the same caliber as some of Spielberg's other marvelous films (i.e. – Schindler's List, Saving Private Ryan, E.T.), nor do I feel the want/desire to view this film again.Set in the winter of 1865 as the Civil War is coming to a close, Abraham Lincoln (played wonderfully by Daniel Day Lewis) comes to the realization that he must use every fathomable power within his means to expedite the passing of the 13th Amendment: Abolishing Slavery before the war ends. Being a former lawyer, he recognizes that if 'slaves' are still considered 'property' of the plantation owners at the war's end, then this will be a negotiable clause in the War Reparations talks, and a point of concession for the North in order to end the war before the upcoming Spring fighting is re-initiated. Lincoln's only course of action is to amend the Constitution prior to the war's end.Steven Spielberg is an extraordinary director, who excels at getting the best performances from his acclaimed actors; this is never more ubiquitous than in this film. The performance of Daniel Day Lewis as Abraham Lincoln is nothing less than astounding. I have read that it had taken Spielberg nearly 10 years of pursuit to finally securing Lewis' acceptance to this role. I can tell you now, it was definitely worth it. Lewis personifies Lincoln, the likeness and make-up is astonishing, and he (Lewis) is definitely the front runner candidate for the Best Actor awards this year. However, kudos can also be given to Sally Field's performance as Mary Todd Lincoln, and even more so to Tommy Lee Jones' performance as Thaddeus Stevens sure to win him some well deserved accolades in the Male Actor Supporting role categories.This is truly a wonderful film, and a definite 'MUST SEE' film in which I highly recommend for this holiday season. With very little competition from any other Oscar worthy films thus far this year, this film could very easily sweep the Academy Awards field this year , a feat in which only three other films have ever accomplished: Silence of the Lambs (1991), One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest (1975), and It Happened One Night (1934). I anticipate 'Titanic' like nominations and wins (14 Nominations / 11 Wins) for this film, and Steven Spielberg to secure his third Best Director's Oscar (Schindler's List-1993, Saving Private Ryan-1998) and second Best Picture award (Schindler's List / Saving Private Ryan lost to Shakespeare In Love-1998).See more of my reviews on FB @ 'The Faris Reel'",8,0,3,16 December 2012
Garden State," Wait for the Video
","Garden State is a quirky little love story written, directed, and starring Zach Braff; the atypical residential intern of NBC's Sitcom Scrubs.The film centers around Andrew Largeman (Braff), a two-bit actor just scraping by in Hollywood. At the beginning of the film, Largeman receives a call from his father (played by Ian Holm) to return home because his mother has died by drowning. Largeman returns home as the conquering hero, resting mostly on the laurels of his made-for-TV movie, in which he played a handicapped individual.Largeman quickly reacquaints himself who his childhood oddball friends, which include: a kleptomaniac gravedigger, a knight's-of-the-round table dinner theater waiter, and a guy who has invented 'no-sound' Velcro (which also made him rich).As the story progresses, we learn that Largeman has been away from home for quite so time due to a childhood accident in which he permanently paralyzed his mother. His psychiatrist father has had him under medication since the age of 9, and has never quite gotten over blaming Largeman for the incident. Largeman has also decided to use his mother's death, as justification to discontinue his medication.Along the way, Largeman meets Sam (played by Natalie Portman), who is everything that he's not; and a relationship is formed. With Sam's help, Largeman is finally able to face his demons, his father, and start living his life coherently.Garden State is bizarre at times; however, always genuine. It's a cute little film worth looking for.",5,0,2,21 April 2005
Brave," A quaint film, not a great film!!!!!
","Although this is being touted as a PIXAR movie release, it's the first Pixar release to have a very Disney-esque quality. The story of a young princess, not happy with the 'life' path laid out before her, asks for help from a wicked witch to 'change' her mother. Merida (Kelly MacDonald) is a strong willed, defiant individual who is in a constant struggle/battle with her mother, Queen Elinor (Emma Thompson). Queen Elinor is determined to groom the young princess into a proper heir to the throne. But more importantly, Queen Elinor wishes to re-unite the four independent Scottish clans back together again, by offering Princess Merida's hand in marriage to one of the eldest sons of the (3) other clans. Upon hearing this news, Princess Merida flees the castle, and heads into the forest. While in the forest, Merida meets a crafty witch. Merida barters her necklace for a magical potion that is supposed to 'change' her mother's attitude/feelings with regards to Merida's pending nuptials. However, Merida was not that specific with her request to the witch, and got a potion that indeed changed her mother, but as they say, 'Be careful what you wish for'!!!!! The potion changed Queen Elinor into a grizzly bear. Merida now has less than 48 hours in order to break the spell. To do so, Merida must 'mend the bond torn by pride' or have her mother remain a bear forever.As stated above, this story line is very Disney in nature, while the artwork is very reminiscent of 'How to Train your Dragon'. I found nothing new, exciting, or original in this Scottish tale. Except for the part of Queen Elinor being changed into a bear. that really came out of left field, and was truly unexpected!!! However, there is nothing 'not' to like in this film either. It's your typical fairy tale, where lessons are learned, forgiveness granted, and in the end everyone lives 'Happily Ever After'.A moderate recommendation, I myself, would wait for the DVD, or watch this film 'On Demand'. A quaint film, but not a great film!PLEASE SEE MORE OF MY REVIEWS ON FB @ 'THE FARIS REEL'",6,18,32,24 June 2012
Here Comes the Boom," An enjoyable, but totally ridiculous film.
","Being a former educator, I am kind of a sucker for movies where teacher's defy the odds and do great things for the betterment of their students. Though this film is no 'Stand and Deliver' or 'Lean on Me', I have to admit that I did get a little choked up at the film's climax as Kevin James (Scott Voss) is entering the arena while the students (and the music department) are playing his theme song First and foremost I have to preface this review with the statement that the premise of this film is totally ridiculous, and that the Scott Voss (Kevin James) character would have been brutalized in the film's climax if this were real life. That said, I still enjoyed this film.Kevin James stars is this film as Scott Voss, a once inspired teacher who has been beaten down by all the bureaucracy of the education system. When Marty Streb's (played wonderfully by Henry Winkler) position as music director is put on the chopping block due to school budget cuts, Voss (James) steps up to help his friend raise the $48,000 needed to keep Streb's job. While teaching a US citizenship course, Voss meets up with a former MMA (Mixed Martial Arts) fighter / gym instructor Niko (played by Bas Rutten). Voss soon realizes there is big money to be made in the MMA octagon (even by losing), and coerces Niko to train him in exchange for private citizenship tutoring secessions. Bas Rutten (Niko), a three-time UFC Champion / Dutch MMA fighter / Karate and Taekwondo blackbelt, is the film's true gem; a very likable character, and the film's most delightful personality on screen.Again the premise of this film is absolutely ludicrous; however, keeping it within the realm of the 'losing aspect' you can deem it somewhat plausible. As the film progresses, Voss starts to gain the respect of his students and his zest for teaching is reignited. As the Voss character continues to grow in popularity, the 'teacher turned fighter' gains some national attention (much like Rocky), and Voss is offered $10K to fight an undercard battle against real life Polish MMA fighter turned actor/stuntman, Krzysztof Soszynski.If you are looking for a really nice enjoyable, light-hearted film with a highly improbable outcome, then this is the film for you. I actually believe the 'Red Dawn' premise of North Korean's landing in Spokane, Washington may probably be more likely to happen; I did find this film mildly amusing and delightfully pleasing. So I am recommending this comical farce on its uplifting theme; and not its preposterous likelihood of occurring. Therefore check your minds at the doors prior to renting this tale of good intentions; then sit back, relax, and enjoy the comical genius of Kevin James.See more of my reviews on FB @ 'The Faris Reel'",6,1,2,13 January 2013
The Adjustment Bureau," I cannot / will not recommend this film
","Movie Review: 'The Adjustment Bureau' – A wannabe sci-fi film with a very interesting premise, only to turn into a lame love story!!!!! Matt Damon stars as David Norris, an up and coming politician. After failing to secure a seat in the NY Senate seat in his first attempt, David has a fate encounter with a mysterious ballerina in the restroom of the Waldorf Astoria. This incident triggers a set of pre-determined events which will enable the continued success of all mankind. To ensure that this master plan is followed, the 'chairman' has dispatched 'case workers' or some may call 'angels' to nudge or direct key people in order to guarantee that these predestined happenings occur. When the master plan gets derailed or goes off-course, a special group of individuals (men in hats) called 'The Adjustment Bureau' is called upon to correct the timeline. In the scenario of this film, it's a 'second chance' meeting of Norris and the ballerina. The Master Plan has it preordained that these two individuals should never come in contact again. However, no matter how hard the 'Adjustment Bureau' tries to redirect, hinder, or disrupt these two from coming in contact. An even larger force or entity seems determined to bring the two back together. AND THIS IS WHERE THIS MOVIE GOES TO HELL IN A HAND BASKET!!! Instead of this force or entity being some sort of 'anti-chairman', bent on the destruction of mankind it's the power of LOVE that cannot be stopped. OMG, PLEASEEEEEEEEEE!!!!!!! So when the Norris character (Damon) is given the option of never seeing the ballerina again, or it could mean the end of civilization as we know it; he opts for being with the girl!!! And that my friends, is where the film spirals into mediocrity!!! What occurs next is a ridiculous chase through a series of 'magical doors' in which only 'men with hats' can manipulate; and if this sounds ludicrous, IT'S BECAUSE IT IS!!!! How a movie with so much potential, could turn into such a pile of drivel, I will never know. I cannot / will not recommend this film, and would avoid at all cost!!!",2,4,6,12 February 2012
Hotel Transylvania," All in all, a nice seasonal film.
","As far as cartoon animation films go, this film actually delivers. An original plot, some memorable characters, and a decent script, which all provided plenty of laughs from the Sony Pictures Animation department. My only issue with this film is that the last third of the film fails miserably, as compared to the first two-thirds of this film. If the anticlimactic ending could have been as fresh and exciting as the beginning of this film, this movie could have been a huge hit, with a plethora of options to continue the storyline.The plot of the film centers around Dracula (voiced by Adam Sadler). In an attempt to protect his daughter, Mavis (voiced by Selena Gomez), from the mean and wicked 'humans', Dracula has constructed a fortified castle / monster inn. Creatures near and far migrate to this demon dwelling so they can socialize freely amongst their own kind, without the fear of being terrorized and hunted down by the awful and depraved human populace hot on their trail. The purpose of Dracula's Castle / Inn is also to keep Mavis from wondering about in public, thus confining her to live her life within the protective castle walls for eternity. However, once a year, all of Dracula's friends (the Werewolf, Frankenstein, the Invisible Man, the Mummy, etc) come to Dracula's Castle to celebrate Mavis' birthday. But this year, an unexpected guest arrives, Jonathan (voiced by Andy Samberg), an American teenager backpacking his way across Europe; and for the first time in 118 years, Mavis has something to be excited about.The thing which makes this film original at first, is the thought that these mean, evil, nasty entities in which awful human books are written about; are in fact afraid of common ordinary person. In fact, humans are the bad guys, with their 'fire' and 'pitchforks', and they are the principal villains in the scary bedtime books that 'monsters' read to their children to scare them into being good. It is this premise, which makes this film works for the most part. However, as the film progresses, the writers/director seem to veer off this established principal, and this is where the film seems to suffer.All in all, a nice seasonal film. I have to admit that I did laugh, and was pleasantly amused at times throughout this film. With a couple of different plot choices at the end of this film, the movie could have been perfect. This film has that 'Monster, Inc' mentality and feel; however, this film is definitely not in its same class. Still I can and will recommend seeing this film. The casting is by far the best part of this film, in addition to the voices of Sandler, Samberg, and Gomez; also featured are Kevin James, Fran Drescher, Steve Buscemi, Molly Shannon, David Spade, and Cee Lo Green, just to name a few. So if you are looking for a family friendly film for your 8 year olds and up, then this just might be the family-friendly film that you are looking for.

The Artist," Different isn't always Better
","Movie Review: 'The Artist' – Three (3) words, 'HOLLYWOOD LOVES DIFFERENT'!!!!! Even if different means making everything OLD, NEW AGAIN (i.e. – shooting a 2011 film in an homage to the silent films of the 1920s). I have to admit that the first 40 minutes of viewing is a totally encompassing experience; however, it does quickly wear off, and I found myself constantly looking at my watch wondering when this film would finally end. Which brings us to the movie's plot and in my opinion, the film's downfall In a nutshell, it's basically just a remake of the 1976,1954, and 1937 films 'A Star is Born' Old star at the height of his career, meets rising starlet. Starlet's career skyrockets, as the old star's career wanes. So once the 'newness' of watching a silent film fades, and you realize that you have seen this film like a gazillion times before; there's nothing more to do but bear the burden of finishing the film. This film is (at best) an 'art house' picture, and not intended for the 'mass' market audience; made for $15 million dollar, the US grosses to date is only $18 million ($47 million worldwide). Nominated for 10 Academy Awards, it will clean house on February 26, and is already the front-runner for Best Picture, Best Director, and Best Actor. If you are a movie connoisseur, you'll probably want to add this film to your collection, if for nothing more than owning a bit of nostalgia and viewing the novelty and pageantry that was the 1920s.",4,2,9,12 February 2012
The Twilight Saga: Breaking Dawn - Part 2," Pleasantly Surprising!!
","After enduring the 117 agonizing minutes of 'Twilight: Breaking Dawn – Part 1', I can honestly tell you that seeing 'Breaking Dawn – Part 2' was the furthest thing from my mind. My only reward for going to see this film, was knowing that this film (good, bad, or indifferent) was the absolute last of the series. It was this, and only this little piece of knowledge, that gave me the determination, strength, and fortitude, to muster the will power to sit through the closing chapter of this highly profitable franchise. With all that said, I have to admit that this film was actually not that bad, and in fact quite entertaining to boot.The film commences right from the end of 'Breaking Dawn –Part 1' with the birth of Edward (Robert Pattinson) and Bella's (Kristen Stewart) baby girl, Renesmee (Mackenzie Foy). I have to say up front, that the camera just loves actress Mackenzie Foy, she is so beautiful on screen. I definitely see a bright future in this up and coming 'rising star'!!!! But perhaps, the biggest surprise in this film has to be the role of Jacob (played by Taylor Lautner). In the pass three film, all we ever got to see from him was pouty, poor-little-ol'-me, Bella loves a vampire, Jacob dude, grow a pair already however, in this film we get to see Jacob the protector, Jacob the brave, Jacob the guardian. It seems Jacob was drawn to Bella's unborn fetus, and upon birth he imprinted on Renesmee. This bond is unbreakable, and with it comes his undying dedication for Renesmee's survival. It's a side of Jacob that we the audience has not seen; one that I much enjoyed throughout this film.This final chapter of the Twilight series centers around Renemee, and her possible threat to the Volturi (the largest and most powerful coven of vampires, who also enforce the laws of the vampire world). The Volturi believe the Cullens have broken Vampire Law with the birth of Renemee. In order to save their coven and Renemee, the Cullens must comb the four corners of the globe for vampire brethren who will champion their cause, and bear witness that Renemee is no threat to the vampire community. An interesting collection of vampire support is assembled, each possessing a special skill / power to accompany their vampirism. All this leads up to the film's climax, the ultimate battle of good vs evil or evil vs worse evil or  nevermind, you get the point.As I said at the beginning of this review, this was actually entertaining this go around. Gone was all the love triangle bull malarkey, an actual plot was developed, action scenes with were really entertaining, and a film which finally took the focus off pasty-faced Edward, sulky Jacob, and just plain miserably sad Bella. So I definitely recommend seeing this film. If you are already a fan, then this film will not disappoint; however, if you are like me and could care less whether Jacob or Edward finally nailed Bella then I say take a chance on this film, you may be pleasantly surprised.See more of my reviews on FB @ 'THE FARIS REEL'",7,3,11,22 November 2012
Mama," Just plain awful
","If I had to summarize the review of this film into just two words, those words would have to be, 'Gawd Awful' or 'Pure Stupidity'; both statements equally and eloquently captivate the essence of unbelievable stench that this film exudes. Written and Directed by Andres Muschiette, it's actually quite comical to count how many times both he as his wife Barbara's names appear on the screen during the film's opening credits. Rated PG13, this film is further justification as to why you should not bother seeing horror movies geared toward younger tween audiences.The film centers around two sisters, Victoria and Lilly. After their father shoots and kills his business partner and their mother, he flees the scene of the crime with the two siblings in tow. High speeds and icy roads lead to an auto accident in the middle of nowhere. This motley crew is able to find shelter in an abandon house in the middle of the woods; however, with no food or water, Jeffrey decides to shoot the siblings. Before Jeffrey can pull the trigger of his gun, an entity (Mama) sweeps into the house and whisks Jeffrey away to oblivion. In the five years that follow, Jeffrey's brother Lucas is still seeking closure to the events which occurred has hired trackers to comb the surrounding woods in hopes of finding his lost brother and nieces. The trackers stumble upon the abandon cabin, where the two sisters (more animal than human) still reside. The authorities are notified, and after a lengthy child custody hearing the two siblings are placed with their Uncle Lucas, with visitation rights granted to his sister-in-law Jean, and child counseling sessions arranged with Dr. Dreyfuss. As you may assume with a film of this nature, the Mama entity is not eager to lose her two adopted children, and thus follows them to their new dwelling. Also the Mama entity is just a tad bit jealous, so in an act of rage she inadvertently throws Uncle Lucas down a flight of stairs putting him into a coma This action brings us to Lucas' wife, Annabel, played by Jessica Chastain. Receiving incredible accolades for her role in 'Zero Dark Thirty', I can only imagine the horrors that must have been racing through her mind when she heard the studio decided to move up the release timeline for this film to capitalize on all her new found fame.Anyways, to make a long story short, it seems the Mama entity is destine to remain on Earth until it can right its wrong. In this particular instance, she is trying to find her lost baby. Forced to jump off a cliff with her child in her arms when she was alive, she was separated from her baby in the fall. If the movie would have followed the rules that it established, then the film may not have been better; however, it would have at least made sense. In the films climatic conclusion, where Mama entity and dead baby carcass are finally reunited, the heavens should have opened up, and the two should have ascended into eternal bliss but did this happen???? Oh no, that would have made complete and utter sense to this completely ridiculous film. Instead writer/director Muschietti decides that the Mama entity should leap off the cliff with her new improved living daughters.This is definitely one of those films in which you have to ask yourself, 'Well, what happened the following day?' In the span of twenty-four hours, Dr. Dreyfuss, sister-in-law Jean, and youngest sibling Lilly are all dead, only Lucas, Annabel, and Victoria know what happened and that a vengeful ghost was the culprit. So as they are explaining all this to the police, do you think that they would get prison or psycho-ward?This is truly a horrendous film and a total waste of Hollywood resources. To even associate Guillermo del Toro's (Pan's Labyrinth) name to this project is insulting and misleading. I cannot recommend seeing this film. You would be best serviced to avoid seeing this film.See more of my reviews on FB @ 'The Faris Reel'",1,52,98,2 February 2013
Sinister," Highly Enjoyable!!!!
","This film is actually a really nice, low budget horror film. More of a thriller / ghost story / boogeyman type movie with lots of 'jump out at you' scares, without all the guts and gore than you have come to expect from an 'R' rated horror film!!!!! Ethan Hawke is brilliant as Ellison Oswalt, a struggling 'true-crimes' writer who is desperately seeking his next great novel. Ellison's claim to fame was his debut best-selling novel, Kentucky Blood; however, his books that followed over the next ten years have failed to generate the same buzz as his initial release.Ellison (Hawke) has decided to investigate the hanging mass murder and child abduction of a middle class family in a small mid-western town. He has relocated his wife and kids to this small town as well, as he further investigates the crime scene and delves into the details of the horrific homicide. Ellison has a history of selecting living accommodations close to the crime scene; however, for this particular case he has opted to live in the crime scene household but neglects to inform his wife or family.Ethan Hawke does a terrific job portraying the down-on-his-luck author willing to do whatever it takes to regain the popularity, fame, and notoriety of his former self. When he stumbles across a box of 8mm home films that connects another four (4) family murders with child abductions dating back 50 years, instead of turning over this additional information over to the local authorities to further investigate; he decides to use this information to his advantage to write his upcoming book. It's this decision, which ultimately puts the gears in motion and subsequently leads Ellison's demise.Made on a shoestring budget for only $3 Million dollars; however, this film does not possess that low budget feel. Written, directed, and executive produced by Scott Derrickson, Derrickson developed a top-notched script with interesting subtext, while maintaining a high level of intensity, intrigue, and just a hint a terror to keep the audience interested, on edge, and jumpy. I definitely recommend this film, there is nothing over-the-top graphic or gory here. This is just one of those old fashion, whodunit / who's-gonna-get-it next horror films, and is done exceptionally well!!! See more of my reviews on FB @ 'The Faris Reel'",7,3,5,25 November 2012
National Treasure," An E-ticket Ride
","Another in a long list of Jerry Bruckheimer produced films, this film centers around the possibility of hidden treasure at the hands of our Founding Fathers and the Order of Masons.The film stars, Nicolas Cage as Benjamin Gates; one of a long list of Gates who have spent most of their lives searching for this mysterious and elusive bounty. Benjamin, however, possesses the ability to unravel the encrypted clues set before him.Ben's father, Patrick Gates (played by veteran actor Jon Voight) believes that the treasure is actually an elaborate hoax set in place to baffle the British during the time of the American Revolution at the exact timing as the signing of the Declaration of Independence. This, as it so happens, plays a pivotal role and significant key piece to the long list of clues needed to decipher the puzzle of the treasure.Done in typical Bruckheimer fashion, the film is grand in nature even if highly unbelievable; although it's quite the roller-coaster ride you've come to expect in a film of this magnitude. Running the gamut from Arctic Circle to burial tombs of Trinity Church, this film provides all the entertainment value required for an enjoyable night out. So check your intellectual thought processes at the door, and strap yourself in for an E-ticket ride, this film is sure to amuse even the most apprehensive at heart. I highly recommend it.http://farisreel.com",7,1,1,30 April 2005
Zero Dark Thirty," A Masterpiece of Epic Proportions
","Kathryn Bigelow is a phenomenal director, an incredible storyteller, and has become Hollywood's mouthpiece for all things dealing with the US's involvement with the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan. Her central characters are stoic, driven individuals heavily encumbered by the events and situations in which they are associated. Her attention to detail is totally unmatched by any other director of this genre. Whether she is focusing on the stress and tribulations of an EOD (explosive ordinance disposal) technician in 'The Hurt Locker' or an up and coming CIA agent in pursuit of Osama Bin Laden, Kathryn Bigelow has the uncanny ability to tell their story in an unbiased, unflinching, no holds barred directness that is a clear, precise, and exceptionally entertaining.'Zero Dark Thirty' refers to the 0030 hrs local time commencement of the Navy S.E.A.L. Team 6 assault on the Osama Bin Laden compound in Pakistan on 01 May 2011. However, the film's main focus is the fortitude and determination of a young CIA agent, Maya, who has dedicated her whole CIA career to the location and capture of Osama Bin Laden. Jessica Chastain (The Help) is remarkable as CIA agent Maya. Maya is a highly intelligent individual who was recruited by the CIA while she was still in high school; her entire 12 year CIA career has been totally dedicated to one single individual: Osama Bin Laden, in which she is the CIA's Subject Matter Expert (SME) for all things associated with Bin Laden. Basically after 129 days of monitoring with absolutely no confirmation or concrete evidence to corroborate, its agent's Maya conviction that Osama Bin Laden is indeed situated on the Pakistan compound which actually 'green lights' the Navy S.E.A.L. Team 6 insertion/mission. This is a brilliant film in which I highly recommend seeing. Kathryn Bigelow is an astonishing director, and was definitely robbed with her snub from the Academy of Arts and Motion Pictures by failing to secure a Best Director nomination for this film. Furthermore, all the bad press aimed at this film with regards to Director Bigelow's decision to include detainee torture sequences in this film is absolutely tenuous. The scenes were essential to the film's plot, and neither condoned nor glorified the actions taken to procure the desperately needed critical information. With a 157-minute running time, this film is a highly intensified, magnificently orchestrated, fantastically conceptualized, a masterpiece of celluloid genius, and a firsthand look of what it really takes to successfully fight (and win) the war on terrorism. Kathryn Bigelow cannot be lauded enough.See more of my reviews on FB @ 'The Faris REEL'",8,10,20,17 January 2013
Dark Shadows," Crap crap crap
","Movie Review: 'Dark Shadows' (* out of 5) – Crap crap crap crap crap crap! CRAP CRAP!!! Crap, crap crap crap. Double crap! Crap crap crap crap crap crap! And more CRAP!!! OMG, what a horrendous motion picture!!!! This film had the makings to be something incredible, but instead of playing this film to be scary or serious; Tim Burton tried to do it as 'camp'. However, the jokes fail miserably, the story line sad, and the dialog pathetic.Based on the 60's vampire soap opera, Dark Shadows re-teams Johnny Depp and Tim Burton; however, this latest collaboration is a poor excuse for entertainment. Depp stars as Barnabas Collins, the Collinswood patriarch. Doomed to live his life as an immortal vampire by his spurned lover and witch, Angelique Bouchard (Eva Green).Barnabas is accidentally released from his tomb in 1972, when excavation in Collins Port unearths his coffin. He returns to his beloved home of Collinwood after nearly 200-year absence to find it in shambles, and the Collins family name and fortune in disarray. Barnabas vows to right this wrong, and reinstate the Collins family name back to its glory of yore.The saddest part of this film is that it had all the elements to be a good film. The unearthing sequence of Barnabas was probably the best of the film Barnabas was fiendish, evil, and wicked; the sequence was terrifyingly delicious. This is how the whole film should have been. I am not sure what Tim Burton's vision for this film was supposed to be, but what he ended up with was CRAP!!!!!! CRAP!!!! CRAP!!! Avoid this film at all cost!!! Being an avid fan of the original series, it pained me to have to sit through this rubbish. I am highly disappointed.",1,16,31,14 May 2012
Star Wars: Episode III - Revenge of the Sith," Worth seeing twice, you can't catch all the subtleties in one viewing.
","(Star Wars  Episode III) George Lucas has put his crowning touch on this quintessential 'pas de la resistance' finale. With cinematic grandeur that only Lucas could achieve, this ending saga quite eloquently weaves continuity into all the loose ends of the five prior epilogues.The battle sequences are exquisite with saber swords blazing; whether matted before mountain fortitude or cascading lava flow. The audience is slowly manipulated through the ominous sequences and events which lead to Anakin Skywalkers lure to the dark side of the Force. Though I have serious reservations if that exact reasoning used in the film to trigger the turn to the dark side was indeed strong enough to do so; however, we all knew that Anakin's turn to the dark side was inevitable.As in all of Lucas' films, the CGI effects are seamless and highly effective in whisking us into a galaxy far, far away. The film's focus was tri-fold. First, was Chancellor Palpatine's rise in the Senate and his continued stronghold over young Skywalker. Second, was Anakin's lost of faith with the Jedi counsel and his lure to the dark side; and third, was the rise to power of Darth Vader, and the annihilation of the Jedi warriors.Again, I have nothing but accolades for this sixth and final episode. The apprehension regarding the 'darkness' of the theme of this film was highly over exaggerated. As a matter of fact, except for one very disturbing scene where 'newly turned' Anakin encounters some 'youngling' Jedi's, everything else in the film is very palatable. The funny thing about the 'youngling' sequence is it's implied rather than shown on the screen, and a scene in which (I felt) was more apt to occur at the hands of the evil Emperor, than a newly turned Darth Vader. (Just my opinion).Sit back and enjoy. Worth seeing twice, I was not disappointed in the least; however, with all good films, I do have my reservations.My suggestion: Worth seeing twice, you can't catch all the subtleties in one viewing.",8,2,4,25 May 2005
Prometheus," Pro-LAME-us
","A more appropriate title to this crapfest would be 'Pro-LAME-us'. Ridley Scott's prequel to his highly successful Alien franchise is just pure rubbish. A team of explorers venture to a far away planet in hopes of finding the answers to the origins of mankind. Believing that the secrets to the origins of mankind have been mapped out in ancient cave drawings, an aging gazillionaire has ponied up $1,000,000,000 (One Trillion) to fund this expedition.Two scientists on board the Prometheus, adamant believers that humankind is direct decedents of this alien race, have been selected to head the team into the alien fortress. As our researchers continue to scourer the alien fortress in hopes to make 'first contact' it becomes quite apparent that some huge catastrophe has taken place at this site almost 2,000 years prior.The team comes in contact with a room filled with cylindrical containers, filled with organic matter. And is in the previously films, they are far too stupid to leave these containers alone, and after nearly 62 minutes of watching this long drawn out film, we finally get some action. However, it's too little too late.The film trudges along at a snail's place, and Ridley Scott brings nothing new to this film. All the common elements are here: (1) the crew is to stupid not to know that alien snake-like creatures might attack, (2) if a company pays $1,000,000,000 for an expedition, there might be ulterior motives involve, and (3) NEVER TRUST THE CYBORG!!!!! I hated this film, it's an atrocity to the franchise (and I thought Alien 4 was about as bad as it could get); however, I WAS WRONG!!!!!! Avoid this film at all cost, or you will be just pissing your hard earned money away!!!!!! Trust me on this one!!!! And please DO NOT get me started on the ending!!!!!!

Taken 2," Gotta Love Liam Neeson
","Kudos to Liam Neeson for single-handedly reviving the action adventure genre. Back in the day, when I was growing up, the action adventure genre was never in short demand due to the holy triad of Willis (Die Hard), Stallone (Rocky / Rambo), and Schwarzenegger (Terminator); however, the mantle of action hero seemed to have been vacated until Mr. Neeson took the reigns and ran with them almost four (4) years ago with hits like Taken, A-Team, The Grey, and Unknown.Though not as good as it's predecessor, Taken 2 does appease the adrenaline junkie's hunger for high-speed thrills, and off the chain action sequences. In this go around, the human trafficking cartel in which Bryan Mills (Neeson) thwarted in Taken 1; have their sights set on vengeance. It seems that one of the individuals killed in the first film was the cartel kingpin's son, and he is hell bent on exacting revenge on not only Bryan, but also his family (ex-wife and daughter).The thing that I love about Liam Neesom's characters, especially Bryan Mills, is that they are played so low key, and down to Earth. No one, not even the criminals in his movies that he is engaging, can take him seriously. That is until that can of 'whoop ass' is opened up. He's just your average, run of the mill 'Joe', devoted father, and all round nice guy, who possesses enough mercenary skills to kill you with his bare hands if need be. I guess that why so many people going to his films, because Liam Neeson has the knack of making people (you the audience) care about the characters that he is playing; and that goes way beyond Acting 101 class.Bryan Mills is no exception. I love the Bryan Mills character. Devoted ex-husband, loving father by day; ex-black ops, ex-military, security force provider by night. All Bryan wants to do is make an honest living, and be the best dad that he can be to his daughter Kim (Maggie Grace); who can be very trying at times, but actually grows up a lot in this film.My one complaint with this film has to be its length. The film is only 86 minutes long, short by any standard. The film takes 21 minutes up front with fluff and fill before any action even begins, and wastes another five (5) minutes at the end, which leaves the audience with about only sixty (60) total minutes of action adventure time and I want MORE!!! I also have to question Bryan's decision to leave his wife's limp body at the scene of the henchmen's abduction site, but hey, he was only doing what the script told him to do LOL!!! Still a very enjoyable film, and I did walk away from this film feeling very satisfied. So I do recommend this film. If action adventure is your genre of choice, then you will not be disappointed. The film references the first film enough so seeing Taken 1 is not a necessity to enjoy Taken 2. The good news is that it seems that a Taken 3 and 4 might come to fruition. With a $49 million debut (twice Taken 1) at the box office, I am sure that 20th Century Fox will not have any issues making this happen either. So it seems that Bryan Mills just might be around for a well, and that's a good thing!!! SEE MORE OF MY REVIEWS ON FB @ 'THE FARIS REEL'",7,1,2,12 October 2012
The Dark Knight Rises," A phenomenal film!!! ALL HAIL Christopher Nolan!!!!
","A phenomenal film!!! ALL HAIL Christopher Nolan!!!! Where to begin It is so hard for me to ever enjoy a summer blockbuster, because I am to easily wrapped up in all the hype that is Hollywood. So by the time I get to the movie my expectations are so unbelievable high, it's nearly impossible for me to enjoy anything that Hollywood is spitting out. However, this is not the case for Christopher Nolan's third and possibly final exclamation point to his highly successful Dark Knight series. The film truly lives up to all the hype, and is a wonderful conclusion to the Dark Knight trilogy, and at the same time it segway's brilliantly to a new and exciting chapter for the Batman franchise.The film's opening six-minute introduction to the film's main villain 'Bane' set the stage for all things good in this movie. A beautifully executed sequence. The film's success has to be attributed to its villains, and Tom Hardy's Bane and Anne Hathaway's Cat Woman are fantastic in the film. After Heath Ledger's Academy Award winning role as the Joker, you would be hard pressed to find another villain with was as much tenacity. However, I assure you that Tom Hardy's Bane has as much (if not more) evilness, ruthlessness, distrainment, loathsomeness, and zero ounce of decency, as Ledger's Joker. 'Bane' command the screen, he is truly evil, and it is fair to say, that he is possibly the most wicked person to ever villainize the silver screen. However, not to be out shined, Anne Hathaway's Cat Woman is bright, cunning, competent, self-absorbed, and all things a man is easily attracted to in a woman, and she is able to hold her own on screen with the likes of both Bane and Christian Bale's Batman / Bruce Wayne.The cinematography and CGI are top-notch, and exactly what you have come to expect in a Christopher Nolan epic. As Bane hold's Gotham City hostage, the chaos/reign of terror that he bestows on the city is truly a sight to behold. Batman has few new toys this time around as well, and I just love Morgan Freeman's Fox character!!! I really enjoyed this film, and I highly recommend it!!!! An emphatic 'TWO THUMBS UP'!!!! This film should be seen on the big screen and/or IMAX. It does not disappoint, and is worth investing the extra money to enhance your viewing experience!! As stated above, the film does put closure to the 'Dark Knight' chapter of the Batman series; however, the door has definitely been left ajar for Hollywood's next great director to step up to the plate. So enjoy this film with the knowledge that Christopher Nolan has just possibly finished one of the greatest most profitable trilogies in recent Hollywood history.

Flight," Another fantastic performance by Denzel Washington
","Denzel Washington has a knack for selecting roles of on-screen personalities that possess serious character faults, flaws, and deflects. Whether it's Detective Alonzo Harris from 'Training Day' or Frank Lucas from 'American Gangster' or even Tobin Frost from 'Safe House' it is usually very difficult for the audience to ever fully embrace the actions that his characters are engaged. Whip Whitaker from 'Flight' is no exception.Whip Whitaker (Washington) is a phenomenal pilot, highly decorated veteran with thousands of flight hours logged; however, Whip Whitaker is also a drug addicted, cocaine snorting, over-indulgent, uncontrollable, yet 'somewhat' functioning alcoholic. After a night of drunken debauchery, Whitaker is scheduled to pilot a routine channel flight to Atlanta. A structural integrity mishap with the plane's tail flap (elevator) causes the plane into a free-falling nose dive, and impending disaster. If not for the exceptional piloting skills of Whip WhitakerÂ… the plane, the crew, and the 102 passengers would have all perished. Whitaker was able to successfully crash land the plane in an open field, but not without fatalities. So is Captain Whip Whitaker a hero, or the scapegoat? In the approximately 105 minutes that follow the accident, we (the audience) are introduced into the world of Whip Whitaker. This is not the glamorous world of the aviation pilot, but rather, the seedy world of the abusive alcoholic. Whitaker is helpless to his addiction, and even though he has been warned of pending prosecution and life imprisonment if he is found guilty of pilot negligenceÂ… Whitaker is powerless to the monkey on his back. It is actually quite painful to watch this character spiral out of control; while a credit the Denzel Washington's acting ability to loathe and detest this character so much. In the events with lead up to the film's climax, I was absolutely flabbergasted as I watched (and knew) what was about to happen as Whip Whitaker (and his inability to maintain self-control) was lured into temptation. Again the disgust and resentment that you have towards this character is a testament to Washington's incredible talent.I do recommend seeing this film; however, it's serious in nature and has very dark overtones. Another terrific performance by actor Denzel Washington, worthy of another Best Actor Nomination; however, I believe that trophy will be going to Daniel Day Lewis for his role as 'Lincoln' this year, which I cannot wait to see.See More of My Reviews on FB @ 'THE FARIS REEL'",7,2,3,16 November 2012
Pitch Perfect," Fat Amy is da Bomb!!!
","Definitely a film targeted towards all the GLEE fans out there. A 100% predictable film that leaves very little to your imagination, with the whole movie being totally laid out in the opening five (5) minutes of the film. However, the a cappella numbers are done well (mostly anyways, the Bella's numbers are really bad), and the music mash-ups really rock; I have to admit that I actually enjoyed this film, another guilty pleasure for my coffers.This film is set on the mythical campus of Barden University, where acapella groups rule the roost. There are four rival a cappella troops on the Barden campus including last year's National 'A Cappella' Champions, The Treble Makers. However, the film actually centers on an all-girl troop, The Barden Bellas. The Barden Bellas were the campus buxom beauties with great vocal ability, but due to their antiquated routines and poor song selection just cannot complete nationally with their Barden counterparts, The Treble Makers. Eager the meet her father's demand and attempt to blend in on campus in order to make her way to Los Angeles, Beca (Anna Kendrick) joins the struggling Bellas a cappella group. Beca is an unknown, yet-to-be- famous, innovative, talented mix-master DJ with the ability to blend multiple genres of music into incredible 'mash-up' remixes. The only problem is the Barden Bellas are unwilling to change their song selection format from their current obsolete standards.The film is filled with various stereotypical characters; however, its best character by far is 'Fat Amy' (played marvelously by Rebel Wilson). When asked why she wanted to be called 'Fat Amy', her responds was brilliant, 'So skinny bitches like yourselves wouldn't do it behind my back!!!!' Even more amusing scene was when the Bellas reached a bonding moment of the film when the troop is trying to grow stronger together, and the members are asked to share their most personal / intimate secret with the group 'Fat Amy' confesses that 'Fat Amy' isn't her real name. the group gasps and leans in closer to hear this startling revelation 'it's really Fat Patricia!!!' The scene is done so seriously, that it's absolutely hilarious!!!!Again, this is really a very cheesy film, with little or no thinking required. However, if you are a fan of GLEE, you will undoubtedly enjoy this film. If Glee makes you skin crawl, then this film should be avoided like the plague. Recommended for home viewing, perfect to rent, download, Netflix, or Redbox. This film is not going to win any Oscar nominations, but if you are in the mood for some light chuckles, and some really nice music numbers, then maybe this is the film for you.See more of my reviews on FB @ 'The Faris Reel'",5,3,8,12 December 2012
Looper," Loved this Film!!!
","I know I really liked this film, because all I can think of right now is seeing it again. I love movies with intricate plots that make you think, movies that you have to pay attention to them to ensure that you don't miss anything. I know on a second viewing of this film, I would see so much more of the film that I missed on my initial viewing. And for this reason alone, I have to highly recommend seeing this film!!!The 'simple'...plotline for this is film as follows: If the mob wants you dead in 2072, they send you back in time to 2042 where a hired hit-man, a Looper, awaits for you to materialize, then shoots you pointblank with a 'blundergun,' a sawed-off double shotgun. The body is then incinerated, and the mob's problem is solved. If you are lucky enough to survive thirty (30) years of service, your 'loop is closed', and your future self is sent back to your younger self for execution. As your reward, you get to live your next 30 years of life 'buck wild'. However in the future, a new mob boss, the Reign-Man, has taken over the five (5) major crime cities in 2072, and is systematically killing off all the Loopers in the future. Old Joe (Bruce Willis) has a plan to find a kill 'The Reign-Man' as a child when he's 'looped' to the past for execution, that is if his younger self (Joseph Gordon-Levitt) doesn't kill him off first.Written and directed by Rian Johnson, this film/script is fresh, vibrant, and a Sci-Fi geek's wet dream; and I just loved everything about this film. Every second that Willis (Old Joe) stays alive in the past has potentially catastrophic to the future, not to mention that every new experience younger Joe (Gordon-Levitt) experiences from the mishap execution, instantaneously becomes a new memory for Old Joe (Willis). Yes, it's that kind of movie.... :) Joseph Gordon-Levitt embodies the persona of Willis much like Josh Brolin did in MiB3 as young Tommy Lee Jones. Levitt has Willis' facial expressions, head tilt, body posture; it's all there. While Willis still plays Willis with blatant disregard and reckless abandonment. My only complaint to this film would be the 2042 'time-warp murder site'. We are supposedly in a future where mob crime rules supreme, wide spread poverty, but there just happens to be a sugar cane farm circa 1940 sitting just outside the city complete with 1940 diner. It's just a little to 'Norman Rockwell' for me!!!! Anyways, I do highly recommend seeing this film I enjoyed it immensely!! However, I am a sucker for Sci-Fi, time travel, and all things Bruce Willis!! Joseph Gordon-Levitt is coming into his own as well a fine performance, well done!! So if you are jonesing for a really nice Sci-fi, time traveler, mob-infested thriller, boy do I have a movie for you!!!! SEE MORE OF MY REVIEWS ON FB @ 'THE FARIS REEL'",7,0,4,5 October 2012
Madagascar 3: Europe's Most Wanted," Good, not Great!!!!
","A very cute family film that the whole family should enjoy. Ben Stiller, Chris Rock, Jada Pinkett-Smith, and David Schwimmer all reprise their roles as the lovable 'fish-out-of-water' NYC zoo animals Alex the Lion, Marty the Zebra, Gloria the Hippo, and Melman the Giraffe. In their attempt to get back to the NYC zoo, the gang must join a Russian Circus in order to avoid capture.In hot pursuit of our fleeing heroes is French Animal Control person Captain Chantel Dubois (voiced by Academy Award Winner Frances McDormand from 'Fargo'). She plays the villianess role superbly; surrounded by a team of Clouseau-type detectives, she is determined to add Alex's head to her wall of mounted trophies.Equally entertaining are the cast of misfit circus performers. Their leader and one time star performer is Vitaly (Bryan Cranston) the tiger, who was injured while performing, and has lost his courage to perform. However, it is Stephano (Martin Short) the half-witted sea lion, who will steal your heart.But the true stars of the film, as in the two prior films, are the Madagascar Penguins. They truly steal every scene that they are in. The team of Kowalski (Chris Miller), Private (Christopher Knight), and Mason (Conrad Vernon) are pure cinematic genius, and I just love them!!!Not a great movie, but it's a good family film; and with nothing else out there to compete with, it will rack up handily at the box office. A moderate recommendation; it's good wholesome fun. So enjoy!SEE MORE OF MY REVIEWS ON FB @ 'THE FARIS REEL'",6,0,0,16 June 2012
Sin City," I LOVED this Film!!!!!!!!!!!
","Based on the graphic novels of Frank Miller, this is a movie that you'll either love or hate immediately. Directed by Robert Rodriguez, Quentin Tarantino, and Miller himself, this film is ultra violence and ultra risqué. Filmed in black and white with hint of coloring throughout, this film is exquisite. It's a combination film noire 1940's style detective novel meets Pulp Fiction, and I just loved it.The film is a culmination of several short stories, all intermingled. From the opening sequence to the ending credits, the film seizes hold of the audience, and dares you not to be entertained. The black and white is grand and enveloping; which tones down the blood splatter being spewed across the screen. This effect turns a would-be mad-slasher movie into cinematic genius.This film has everything, from the A-List of stars which include: Bruce Willis, Mickey Rourke, Jessica Alba, Clive Owen, Rutger Hauer, Powers Boothe, and Elijah Wood playing some sort of flesh-eating psycho that's just too cool for words and a far cry from his Frodo character of the last five years; to over the top story lines with ninja hookers, dirty cops, unstoppable vengeful superhuman hit-men, carnivorous were-boys, IRA mercenary militia and corrupt politicians. It's everything that you could ever want in a movie and more.To try to explain the movie in words, would take to long, and would end up incoherent; let's just suffice it to say, 'You'll have to see it to believe it,' and leave it at that. I must also reiterate that this film is very adult oriented; if you're easily offended or overly sensitive to adult content and graphic subject matter, then I would think twice before viewing. However, since I am neither of these, I enjoyed this film thoroughly.",9,1,2,20 April 2005
Coach Carter," Take a Chance on this Flick
","Coach Carter is a MTV feature film production. This film stars Samuel L. Jackson, and tells the true story of Coach Ken Carter from Richmond High School in inner city Los Angeles, California.Carter is a self-made man, a strict disciplinarian, and owner of his own Sporting Goods Store. As the film begins, Carter has returned to old alma mater to watch a basketball game against St. Joseph, the High School his son is attending. Prior to game, Coach Carter has already been approached by the school's current coach to take over the team.Richmond is severely thrashed, their undisciplined, their cocky, and unruly. Carter accepts the coaching position; however, it has to be on his terms. Richmond had only won 4 total games the previously year, so Coach Carter was afforded his request.Carter required all of his players to sign a contract before any of them could play ball. The contract required each player to maintain a 2.3 G.P.A., attend all scheduled classes, and to sit in the front row of all classes in which they attended. He required Progress Reports for all teachers documenting each player's academics. He also required each player to dress appropriately on Game Day, with Tie and Coat; this promoted respect in the team, and respect for oneself.Prior to the season's start, no one even knew who or where Richmond High School was, but rigorous practices, forced discipline, and strict guidance from carter turned them into winners; however, that's where the trouble started.Winning was easy, Carter had a plan; and the team executed it superbly. However, Carter wanted more for these players; he wanted hope, desire, and the ability to lift themselves above the life in which they were headed. He wanted his players to have the ability to attended college; and this could only happen if their grades were good enough.However, Richmond H.S. only graduates 33% of their seniors and over 60% of those are female. Carter explained that his player stood a better chance going to Jail than college. Once the Progress Reports were published, six of his players were failing at least one or more of their classes. So Carter at 16-0, undefeated and headed to the state championships, locked the gym doors and started forfeiting games; turning basketball practice sessions into tutoring lessons for the players. This is when the sh@# hit the proverbial fan..In the semblance of Stand and Deliver, Remember the Titans, and Hoosiers, Coach Carter is another story about one man against insurmountable odds, bound and determined to make a difference in someone else's life, even if that someone isn't seeking change (well, at first anyways). In doing so, he changes that person today, and for generations to come. Coach Carter is raw at times, and might not be as good as other that I've mention; however, it's a story well told, and I did enjoy it.http://farisreel.com",6,0,0,21 April 2005
Warm Bodies," Zombie Romeo and Juliet
","I have to admit that it actually took me two sittings to finally get through this film; however, once you get past the utterly preposterous plot premise of this film, the movie turns out to be kind of cute in the most ridiculous set of circumstances that you could possibly imagine. The basic plot line is as follows: boy dies and turns into a zombie, boy kills girl's boyfriend, zombie eats boyfriend's brain, gain knowledge of girlfriend, zombie falls in love with girlfriend. You can easily see why after only the first 24 minutes of my first attempt to view this film, I quickly diverted to watching something else. However, the film does get better, and even somewhat more ludicrous as the film proceeds. But we will get to thatThe film centers around 'R', a teenage zombie with lots on his minds, but he is constrained within the rotting corpse of a zombie. He reminisces of days gone by, and collects household treasures that he can relate (snow globes, vinyl records). His only pleasure in his afterlife existence comes with the consumption of human brains. The brain holds all the memories and experiences of its human host, and all these events and recollections get transferred to the zombie as the brain is ingested. These life images provide the zombie with a brief euphoria of what it was like to be alive. So when 'R' (Nicholas Hoult) ate Perry's brain (Dave Franco), Perry's memories of his girlfriend Julie (Teresa Palmer) came rushing into 'R' s zombie soul. While feasting on Perry's brain 'R' happens to glance up, and quickly realizes that Julie (his new memory) is about to ravaged by a horde of zombies as well. He rushes to save the damsel in distress, and thus ignites the first spark of life ever to be felt by the undead.The story that follows is your typical dweeb boy falls for the hot cheerleader teen angst PG-13 film; however, writer/director Jonathon Levine does employ lots of zombie humor to keep this story fresh and fun. The longer Julie and 'R' are together, the more human 'R' becomes. However, turmoil arises when the truly undead, the 'bonies', sense that their world is changing as the newly undead are starting to experience feelings. Add in that Julie's father (John Malovich) is the leader of the human resistance force to kill all zombies, and what you have here is a 21st century twist on a Zombie Apocalypse meets 'Romeo and Juliet' tragedy complete with its own balcony scene. Needless to say, this is not Shakespeare nor does it try to be. This film is light-hearted fun with plenty of quirks to keep you amused. I actually found the closing five minutes really, really enjoyable with comments like 'damn these zombie fingers' and 'I no eat (you)'. This is definitely not your typical rom-com, but under all that rotting flesh, a romantic comedy is exactly what this film becomes. A moderate recommendation, well worth the price of renting. So give this film a shot, and I think you may be pleasantly surprised.See more of my reviews on FB @ 'The Faris REEL'",5,2,6,12 April 2013
