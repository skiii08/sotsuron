E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial," A touching film for kids and adults
","Few films have ever entertained me, exited me and brought me so close to tears as E.T. It has humor and thrills and a whole lot of heart. Actually, I don't know if I've ever seen a film with more heart than this one. Who ever thought that a rather ugly alien could be such a lovable character? I have loved this movie since childhood and will love it for the rest my life. Like all great movies for kids, E.T. appeals to people both young and old. The performances are so convincing and the emotions are so real that you can't help being caught up in the thrilling adventure of a boy and his friend from outer space. This movie is Steven Spielberg's masterpiece. Schindler's List was excellent, but most of it's power came from the scenes of innocent Jews being randomly shot. It's main emotinons are that of fear and sorrow, but E.T. focuses on love and that is the most powerful and most important feeling of them all. If you haven't seen it and you're thinking that this film is cheesy or sappy, it's not. It's very real and very entertaining. It's the perfect film for anyone who has ever felt lonely or rejected and wished that they had a friend.",10,1,2,30 August 2005
