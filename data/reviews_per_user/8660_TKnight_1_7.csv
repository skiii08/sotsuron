Casablanca," The Greatest Film Ever Made
","A bold statement, especially considering I haven't seen every movie that's ever existed, but as far as the classics we all know and that latest new epic or new teen comedy is concerned, Casablanca is simply the greatest film of all time.It is honestly difficult to say this, especially when The Godfather, Gone with the Wind, and Lawrence of Arabia are taken into account. Out of these three I'd say The Godfather is probably the most interchangeable with the greatest of all time, however The Godfather does lack the 'go out to the movies and take your mind away for a hour and a half' aspect that is so necessary in films. When you go to something like 2 Fast 2 Furious you are going solely for escapism and entertainment. When you go see Darren Arnofsky's 'Pie' (if you could have found it in a theater) you are seeing it solely for it's artistic value. Neither aspect of going to the movies is better than the other. There are those high-brow, art house people who watch nothing but Pie, Transpotting, and Fight Club who say 2 Fast 2 Furious or anything like it is utter crap and has no value. Then there are those teeny-bopper idiots who watch nothing but TRL, American Pie, and think black and white movies are boring and they are just as wrong.The best movies ever made are certainly not those starring Paul Walker or Sean William Scott and feature nothing but explosions and fart jokes. Nor do the best movies ever made have actors you've never heard of and deal with the deep, dark issues of the human mind or make as many jabs at pop culture, or any culture for that matter as they can. Such art house movies negate the purpose of movies, which shall always be at its core, escapism. However, escapism at its extreme negates the power and meaning movies can transmit.The best movies ever made are those that combine these two aspects. Art and Entertainment. People should never be extreme one way or the other with almost everything in life and movies are certainly one such thing. Casablanca does everything I've mentioned that makes a perfect film. Those who love Brittany Spears and American Pie probably have never heard of, nor will they ever appreciate this film because their parents have taught them black and white=boring. Those modern critics who look back at movies like Casablanca or filmmakers like Frank Capra and call his work meaningless, sensationalist tripe are just as wrong and closed-minded as the teeny boppers.Casablanca contains great performances from the greatest actors, wonderful cinematography, intelligent dialogue, and the greatest classical love story ever told on screen and the greatest, realistic ending of any film ever made as well. Just as the romantic comedy would not exist without Shakespeare, the modern romantic drama and film noire, would not exist without Casablanca. See it and many other films of the past. The greats of today would not exist without the greats of yesterday.",Null,1,2,11 August 2004
Alexander," I would have rather done homework!
","Where to begin? The question WHY is the first that comes to mind. Why can't epic fight scenes be filmed in a way where we actually SEE what's going on? What is this trend as of late to make the camera as jittery as possible and the cuts as random and quick as possible during large scale battles, of which there are only TWO in all of Alexander's three hours? There is sometimes nothing but shifty gold chain-mail on the screen. Literally nothing else. Just armor going back and forth for no reason and in-between shots of Colin Farrell's dumb-struck expression of which he manages to slip into every scene. Is this supposed to convey the confusion and horror of warfare? It certainly disorients. But last time I checked that wasn't the point of going to the movies.Before I sift further through this heap of ridiculous dialog and imagery, let me point out four good things about Alexander. One: the scene when he tames the horse was cool. Two: Rosario Dawson is nude for one scene. Three: Lot's of close ups of Angelina Jolie Four: The scene when Alex goes up against an elephant is cool too.None of these are reason enough to waste your time. I should have stayed home and written a paper for my Gov Ec class instead of seeing this film. The music is purposeless and downright cheesy during long speeches and far too short fight scenes. The acting...well, there's too much of it. Nobody is just being natural in this movie. Everyone is trying to be Creek or Roman or a Tribesman or an Indian or something. And Colin, well, he's better suited for Dare Devil. A resurrected Bull's Eye would be a better fit than the role of Alexander.I'm busting with bad things to write so let me focus on other criticisms. People are complaining that there's too much violence. It's a movie about war. What are you expecting? When two armies run together they're not doing so to drop the sharp things they're carrying to hug. If anything there's not enough violence. There's far too much talking and thinking and moaning and complaining for a movie about a man who's supposed to be the tough guy to end all tough guy's. And I think the brutality of Alexander, the true strength and iconic status which this warrior possessed, could have been shown even with the bi-sexual element remaining. The man-love in this movie didn't irritate me because I'm against it. I honestly don't care. What irritates me is the way it's portrayed. The scenes between Alexander and the guy he loves (I can't remember his name to save my life) are written horribly. The dialouge is utterly clich√©. It would have been just as awful if it was a scene between the more traditional man and woman. This is my point, that the frustrating thing about the character is not that he's bi-sexual, it's that it's Colin Farrel trying to act bi-sexual. It is impossible to believe that these two are actually in love. Not only are their faces unconvincing, the way they say their lines is as if they were uncomfortable to do so.And because Colin tried to handle this 'feminine' side to the warrior as best he could, the barbaric side is completely lost. Alexander is a whinny little boy. The female characters are much stronger than he. The duality to this man should have been left in the hands of far more experienced actor, and dare I say it a far better writer/director than Oliver Stone. It would have been very interesting to see a bi-sexual warrior in a well-done film. It could have been controversial on a much larger scale and could have exposed American audiences to something they're not used to.But my main point is, why take away battle sequences that could be both artistic and entertaining (which would also provide depth to Alexander) and substitute them with unending speeches about glory and death and betrayal and yada yada yada. This film is bad. Plain and simple. It is almost not worth the time I've spent to write about it.In the end, I come back to the question of Why. Why are people making movies like these, spending years and millions to produce something that is so obviously unnecessary. The people in the audience were more interesting than what was on the screen. I found myself checking my watch more times than I can count. And I have a long attention span!Do yourself a favor and stay home, or just watch BraveHeart or Gladiator again and call it a day.",Null,0,1,4 December 2004
Star Wars: Episode II - Attack of the Clones," I'll Try To Be Nice...
","I once wrote a beyond scathing review of this film that compared George Lucuas to a dictator we shall leave nameless, and went on to describe his blasphemous decision regarding the release of only the Special Edition DVD's as a rape of classic film.I'll do my best to be nicer and more focused on the horrid excuse of a Star Wars movie...no...horrid excuse of a movie that is Episode Two. I remember going to the theater, extremely excited, soaking in the nerdy atmosphere of childish bliss, knowing that even if the movie sucked it would still have an awesome lightsaber fight in the end. You can imagine how I felt leaving, provided only with a lame Gladiator/Rancor scene ripoff, an all too brief fight where Obi-Wan gets his butt handed to him, and two subsequent lightsaber fights that could have been great but wound up being trite, meaningless five-second bouts.What was Lucas thinking when he wrote the scene when Anikan and Padme are sitting in the fields talking about politics...and what was he drinking when he wrote the following scene where Anikan rides some bulbous brown alien beast that looks more like something you'd find in an Episode of South Park? The man's talent has been drained by his children, as well as this once well-crafted space opera which has grown far out of his control.He has attempted to put it back into his control, obviously, but it seems now that he's doing everything he wants, he is forgetting all that is good about story telling, dialogue, and action sequences. Episode II is nothing but a filler, a mish-mash of flashing lights and colors that tries so desperately to have validity through a few shadows and dark, brown leather tunics.I almost feel bad for Lucas after watching this movie. Because he honestly seems to think it's good. It is not. Episode II is a yellow brick road that leads nowhere near as cool as Emerald City. It just keeps going round and round with a parade of irritating Munjkin like characters that have no develop, utter the dumbest lines in the world, and ultimately end up being inconsequential.This doesn't even feel like a Star Wars movie. It seems like a lame TV rip off CBS might do. Even Episode One had a sense of grand epic scope, going from undeniably exciting pod-race scenes to superb lightsaber duels. And at least Liam Neeson was in that one. Schiendler with a Lightsaber is a winning combination.The strongest aspect of Episode Two is Ewan McGregor and Jango Fett. Their battle through the asteroid ring was, in fact, cool. But Obi-Wan Kenobi, the only important character besides Anikan that links the two series', is not given hardly enough screen-time. Lucan has denied this character in both prequals and this is his greatest flaw, not the abysmal love story, not the unending special affects, but his inability to provide us with characters that hold half as much interest as the original cast. Ewan does an excellent job with the little that he is given and if only Lucas has not explored the benefits of developer that character.I have high hopes for Episode III. I will go see it, despite the fact that I once wanted to start a boycott of it. The fact that it's PG-13 and the last Star Wars ever is reason enough to see it. Lucas has a lot of work to do if he is to be redeemed.The Revenge of the Fans will be far worse than that of the Sith if we're given another Episode II.",Null,13,24,26 March 2005
Collateral," Mann's Most Mainstream...but still superb.
","Acting, cinematography, plot, and pace are all executed to near perfection in Collateral. I actually went into this one with low expectations because when I heard Jamie Fox of 'Bait' and 'Booty Call' fame was starring along-side Tom Cruise in a Michael Mann picture, I was worried. And going into one of Mann's pictures, you can't help but think there's no way he can top himself. He already nailed the L.A. action/drama with Heat and following that up with The Insider, arguably one of the best movies ever made, has to make one wonder if Mann can get any better.Well, he hasn't gotten better, he's just added another piece of great film-making to his growing list. His shot-choices are sometimes very much like those in independent films, The Insider being the best example, and his music selection, usually consisting of middle-eastern strings and chants, brings a zen-like atmosphere to his movies that tends to add a very artistic element to a story that could be done in an otherwise very straightforward way.The Music in Collateral with the exception of some techno and Audio Slave, is really my only problem with the movie. The various hard rock fits with the gritty L.A. cab driver life, but I couldn't help but miss Lisa Gerard's chanting (of Dead Can Dance fame and the singer of various middle-eastern-like songs in The Insider). My only other complaint is the sudden appearance of inconsequential F.B.I. agents in the film. But the scene these agents wind up in is simply one of the greatest shootouts ever filmed.I write that Mann hasn't gotten better because as good as Collateral is, it is not as good as the two other films I've mentioned. It does not carry the weight or importance that The Insider does and it simply is not as epic as Heat (and it doesn't have a gun fight between Pacino & De Niro. Nothing can beat that.)That said, the only way it's possible to find anything bad about Collateral is by comparing it to Mann's own films, and you know a Director has reached a point of notoriety when that's the only way one can find flaws.Now for Tom Cruise. I'm not sure how good of an actor he actually is. He is fairly similar in almost everything he does, even though I don't like to write that, it's true. However, he always has screen presence, and I'm not annoyed by him on screen, which is more than I can say for many other actors who started out as pretty boys. And, in films like Last Samurai and the surprisingly disliked Far And Away, Cruise has a certain strength that comes from anger. Now that he's a bad guy in Collateral, all of his anger and rage is set free and we finally see a character that Cruise has nailed. He simply is Vincent. If you ask me what his name was in Last Samurai or Far and Away or Days of Thunder, I couldn't tell you. But I will always remember Vincent. Whether he's just looking into the camera with shadows and LA lights streaking across his stoic face, conversing the meaning of existence with Jamie Foxx, or shooting up an entire night clud as Okenfold's techno plays in the background, he dominates the film with a creepy, cool edge that has thus far escaped him in his career. He's always performed well in his other movies, don't get me wrong, but in Collateral he achieves a level of comfort that makes it very easy to believe in him.Jamie Foxx and Pinket-Smith give great performances as well. I rooted for Jamie the whole way through and he just keeps getting tougher and tougher as the movie goes. It will be interesting to see where he goes from here.And aside from the shoot-ups which are awesome and a climactic chase scene that will drive any to the edge of their seats, there is an underlying theme tying all these characters together in a very interesting way. Pay attention to the conversation Cruise has about the man on the monorail nobody notices. Well, with movies like Alien Vs Predator bringing a screeching halt and slow, agonizing death to the summer movie season, it's safe to say Collateral deserves your ten bucks and two hours. As of now it is one of the few Best Picture candidates this year.",Null,0,0,10 August 2004
Hero," Hero Rescues The Summer Movie Season!
","**A few little spoilers I guess**I went into Hero with low expectations at least in regards to the story, acting, and what-have-ya. All I wanted was some awesome action. Well, I got superb action along with superb everything else. I just came from the theater so I'm a bit jaded, but I'm certain that when I buy this on DVD and set it next to Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon on my movie rack and watch it a second time, I will appreciate it just as much if not more.To like this movie one has to like Asian philosophy, Wire-fu, anime, pretty much anything eastern. If you don't like any of these things or simply don't understand them, then Hero is unfortunately not for you. This is really a shame because the technical aspects of Hero as well as the very simplistic story (which is told in a rather complicated way) is enough to wow anyone who sees it. However, those who can't get passed their belief in gravity or continually ask 'why is there writing on the bottom of the screen?' won't be able to stomach this film.Whether you're a fan of the style or not, or whether you are annoyed by Hero's flashbacks, retellings, and eventual open-ended ending, it is a great film, definitely one of the greatest of the summer, definitely the greatest action film of the summer, and thus far one of the few worthy of a best picture nod (though barely anyone would agree).Asian-cinema has action sequences, particularly those involving sword-play, down to a science. The editing in Hero is unbelievable in regard to the fight sequences. Slo-mo is used to perfection, angles are always ever-changing yet long lasting so that we can actually SEE all that's going on, and the choreography is right up there with Crouching Tiger and The Matrix(because they're choreographed by the same man).If I'm comparing Crouching Tiger to Hero, I'd have to say Hero falls short but not by much. Crouching Tiger has a complete story where every character is developed extremely well and we KNOW why everyone can flip around the way they can. In Hero, such backstory and explanation aren't really necessary but it is harder to become invested in a story that sometimes turns out to be a lie or where three or four different scenarios that may or may not be true play out before us. Those who already have a hard time following a movie with subtitles are going to find Hero a painstaking experience. However, I argue that showing a traditionally simplistic story in a complicated way, creates a new take on the classic revenge story. Sure, the film could be linear and we could see Jet Li progress one assassin at a time in a traditional chronological path, but then Hero wouldn't be Hero. I really could go on and on about this movie because I haven't even talked about a lot of what I wanted to. I never expected this movie to be half as deep as it is. Almost every fight scene contains some kind of element or color of nature. And I really loved the final message of the film, one that I certainly wasn't expecting. I know it may annoy some that 'To lay down your sword' is apparently a warrior's ultimate hope when we've seen that warrior using his sword for an hour straight in order to get what he wants, but 'can't we all just get along' is a better message to spread than some of the tripe we're seeing on screens big and large these days. And to get such a message from such a film makes Hero unexpectedly meaningful and worthwhile. And add some of the best cinematography, editing, and sound among superb fight-scenes and you get something that doesn't happen enough: a good combination of art and entertainment.Hero is the only movie that completely took my mind away from the world for an hour and a half this year. It's editing in fights is even better than either Kill Bill and the shots and colors in this film are, dare I say it, better than Crouching Tiger. Worthy of your money. A solid good time. And if you don't like reading, don't. Just watch the fights. It's still worth it.",Null,0,0,27 August 2004
World Trade Center," Highly Overrated and Too Tame...
","I'm surprised by the excellent reviews this movie is getting. It's not a bad movie, but it certainly doesn't merit the steller acclaim. It's not all that well written, directed, shot, or edited. The performances are good, I suppose.I think people are just afraid to criticize a movie about Septemeber 11th. Bottom line is that this movie is cheesy and pandors to the audience. If Stone still had some balls he would have set the entire movie in the rubble. The movie would have been much better if the first half hour had shown the normal routine of the cops. Show us what life was like on September 10th and then build to the moment. Establish the characters. Don't make us care for them just because they're September 11th cops. That's just annoying because it doesn't show any real writing ability. It's like saying, okay, people will like them even if they don't know who they are.This movie is far too tame and it's a shame it came out because there can definitely be a better movie that handles the exact same subject matter, but it can't come out without being deemed a copy. It should have been R and there should have been more cursing and more violence to adequately reflect reality. Ultimately, Sept. 11th just isn't great movie material. Like Pearl Harbor, historically tragic events just don't usually work on screen because there is no way to adequately recreate what happened...and the question needs to be asked...why should we recreate it in such a way. The documentary on Sept. 11th is far more powerful and well-executed and captures the day and the feeling of the day much better.",1,9,17,19 August 2006
Star Wars: Episode III - Revenge of the Sith," Redeemed...
","You speed through backroads toward the highway, heart beating in your ears, pores pumping sweat, and eyes alight with childish excitement. You jerk into the parking lot, spring to the front door, tear it open, buy your ticket stub, and smile wide as you pass under a banner that reads STAR WARS: EPISODE III: THE REVENGE OF THE SITH. The day you've been waiting for has finally come. Three long years of eager, sometimes heartbreaking anticipation and finally, the yellow words blast upon the screen for what may be the last time. STAR WARS.It was a beautiful day, one of the best. And from then on this movie only gets better. It is, Star Wars saga aside, a very good film in its own right that fires on all cylinders and delivers everything it sets out to. But, when considering it as a part of the series, it is even better, because not only does it connect everything, wrap it all up in a beautiful package and leave you feeling sad, happy, and drained, it entertains and enthralls with amazing lightsaber battles, and scenes of dialogue (yes, even dialog), that are honestly emotionally gripping.I found Episode II to be a disappointment, to say the least. But after seeing this film, I can accept Episode II and I see how necessary it is to the series. And for anyone who dislikes the prequals altogether, they cannot deny the fact that Episode III is an excellent film and an excellent STAR WARS film. It links the the original series to the new series, and it taps into the old sense of desperation you felt for Han, Luke, and Leia, especially towards the end of the film when everything literally goes to hell, Anikan goes on his rampage, and Obi-Wan and Yoda team up and go after the Sith.EVERY scene between Palpatine and Anikan is amazing, insightful, and even written well. The look of this film, its darkness and emotion, create and experience that will affect any movie-goer but especially those who loved the original Star Wars as children, because, if they're willing to see passed whatever disappointment they had with the previous two sequels, if any, they will see a film that speaks to them, that does a good job of clearing things up and bringing finality to a tale that is surprisingly tragic.Even if you hate this movie for a variety of reasons, it is worth it for the lightsaber battles alone, particularly the parallel fights of Yoda and Palpatine and Anikan and Obi-Wan. There are some remarkable moments in this movie, particularly the climax of the final duel, and the very last shot itself. And, one of the greatest moments in the history of film, a moment that is destined to become classic, is when the helmet finally locks in place and Vader takes his first, deep breath. This film is an homage to the original in many ways, and for all those wondering if Lucas redeemed his series with this film, he certainly did. It's an excellent and enjoyable piece of work that certainly isn't for the faint of heart.",Null,1,2,28 January 2006
