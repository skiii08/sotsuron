The Devil's Advocate," Pacino, Reeves and Theron in a movie well worth seeing.
","SPOILERS THROUGH:At first I thought I was watching 'The Firm' meets 'Rosemary's Baby' and gradually realized it was something else entirely. The Devil's Advocate is a really good, quality film that manages to be both highly thought provoking and tremendously entertaining at the same time. I really enjoyed this a lot.The three main performers are all at their best. This film was made before Theron became such a big name and she is as good in this as everything else she's in. She actually steals the movie a few times and more then holds her own with the likes of AL Pacino.Then there's Keanu Reeves. Although his performance has received some not so good reviews, I liked him in this role and thought he does his best work here. Keanu is suited to a certain type of role and he was perfect for the role of Kevin. As mentioned, this movie reminded me, at first, a little of 'The Firm' and I certainly thought Reeves was better in his role then Cruise was as Mitchelle Mc.Deer in 'The Firm'. Just my opinion but I thought it was great casting.And then there's Pacino. Absolutely and completely superb. This is one of the best roles, if not the best, I have ever seen him play and could anyone else really have been as perfect for the role as Pacino? This was a movie where the casting definitely helped make it what it was.One thing I enjoyed so much about The Devil's Advocate is how one doesn't know what will happen moment to moment. In the world of movies, it seems the majority are at least somewhat predictable. Not so in Advocate. It was so very nice to actually be surprised. And not surprised once either. The movie has several zingers which I never saw coming and that's a great challenge in movie land. Advocate was definitely up to that challenge.Then there's the cinematography which was excellent and the story itself which is provocative and thought provoking in it's tale of vanity and human corruption. And though it has a long running time it seems much shorter then it actually is. And the movie has humor as well and that humor makes for some great moments, the conversation between Pacino and the two knife wielding men on the train for example. Devil's Advocate comes close to a 10 for me, though not quite. There were some plot holes and things I didn't understand. Also, though the humor in Advocate was usually outstanding, it was weakened when the film got a little to campy at times which didn't go with the rest of the movie, especially since so much of Advocate was genuinely creepy. This is probably a film best seen more then once and there are several things that are open to interpretation.Then there's the ending. Althoughh this is not the type of ending I like In most films AT ALL, for some reason it fit here. And by the time the film ends, one is in such a high state of anticipation to see what's gonna happen, and so into the movie, that it's ending is almost OK. I say almost because I still think the ending could have been a little stronger but that's just a minor complaint. I'd give this a 9 of 10 and really recommend it.",9,11,12,15 April 2006
The Blair Witch Project," not what I expected but creepy.
","It was completely different then what I expected but I did enjoy it. Very unique movie. VERY different then what I thought. WAS extremely over-hyped. but I enjoyed the hype! my friends and I had been having dinner out when we just looked at each other, said we HAVE TO go right now and see this-and bolted.I really think the hype was part of the fun. If you see it expecting a certain type of movie you will be disappointed. There are parts that are not so scary and parts that even drag a little. However-that said-this IS one creepy movie-not a masterpiece and maybe not as horrifying as it was supposed to be but definitely a creepy movie, eerie in the psychological sense and well acted. Worth seeing just for the sheer uniqueness of the concept though people with motion sickness may want to think about taking something for that beforehand.SPOILER:The last scene in the end was freaky and singlehandedly more frightening then the whole rest of the movie. See it if you haven't.",7,5,9,12 August 2003
Saturday Night Fever," the days of wine and disco.....
","Saturday Night Fever. Just the name evokes memories. It's hard not to feel nostalgic remembering this movie. Being someone who grew up knowing the magic of disco, I  definetly remember the glittziness and glitter of this early travolta movie. But I still wouldn't call it one of the best pics ever made as many reviewers before me had indicated.I think this movie stands up as being a major influence on other movies as well as having some of the best music ever seen in a movie-and that's for sure-the music is addicting. And the dance numbers were pretty cool to.But the story itself is just good for me-ok maybe VERY good-I'll admit I am a much bigger fan of 'Grease' then Saturday Night Fever. I will say the movie nailed the atmosphere to a tee. Another reviewer recently posted on here talking about aspects of superficiality and I agree. In the disco era, as in many others, image is everything. That's the type of environment that can have more then a little negative impact after awhile if it gets into your skin.It's hard to see this now and not be taken back in time but even now, I like this less for the story then for the incredible sizzling music that very few movies before and after have ever been able to duplicate so effectively.I give Saturday Night Fever a 12 out of 10 for the music but about an 8 for the movie as a whole. But hearing that great music never fails to make me wanna get up and dance!",8,2,4,3 May 2004
Kill Bill: Vol. 2," You know a movie's good when it gets better each time you watch it....
","There are certain movies that are just so amazing you almost can't review them because what can you say that hasn't already been said? Such is the case with Kill Bill. In fact my review of Pulp Fiction was quite short as well. Terrentino's movies are so brilliant in their making that even if you don't like them you gotta be awed at the not so simple task of making these movies. And in the case of this one, there isn't one performance that isn't Oscar worthy. And I think it deserves it's place in the IMDb top 250 even more then Pulp Fiction.Kill Bill is a movie I enjoyed throughly and part two is more my thing then one because I am simply more into talky dialog driven movies then movies with less talk and more violence but since 1 and 2 are part of the same film basically spread out over time, I Don't suppose it matters. Nothing brilliant to add-it's all been said. BUT A FEW SPOILERS NOW: My favorite scenes may have been where the bride trains with Pai Mei and the non verbal as well as verbal interaction between them. I sorta wish all performers in this could win Oscars. Just one interesting note to those who may not have seen this.The best films are actually stories that come to life in such a vivid way that they cease to become movies and become a true to life story unfolding in front of you. Kill Bill could be a walking advertisement for such a film. Call it twisted, odd, call it talky, call it violent and unnecessarily brutal(And part two IS violent have no doubt about it). It is all the things mentioned. But it is also an intense movie where the characters are so real you feel like you can reach out and touch them. The direction is perfect and you are with the bride on her heartbreaking journey every step of the way. There isn't one scene in the movie that could have been done any better.The movie is upsetting, to be sure, and will haunt you for days afterward. But the most interesting thing is how hooked you will become without knowing you are hooked. For anything about the movie someone may not enjoy, (if indeed there are any), If you decide to walk out, there will probably come a point when you just won't able to. Great script. Q & U did good!",10,0,1,24 October 2004
Walk the Line," exhilarating.
","SPOILERS THROUGH:Yes!! My first '10' for a 2005 release I saw in the theater. Walk The Line was a wonderful Movie! It was touching, poignant, and also very entertaining. It contained sweeping cinematography, and was wonderfully directed with many a closeup shot, which worked very powerfully here. The performances were tops. Joaquin Phoenix gave a powerful and intense performance. Reese Witherspoon is a breath of fresh air. She was charming, spirited, engaging and completely Oscar worthy. Both have an excellent chance at best Actor/Actress Oscars. The chemistry between these two is as electric as the feel of the whole Movie, and the fact that these two people do their own singing is incredible. Joaquin was great and Reese Witherspoon should record an album, preferably immediately.To me a movie gets a 10, when there just isn't anything lacking. Walk The Line is a great movie and one does not have to be Johnny Cash fan to love this movie. Of coarse you may just become one after seeing it, but I think a biography that is just really well done can appeal to people who may not even know a lot or much, about the person before seeing it.There is a lot to love about this movie and it crosses so many genres. It is a serious drama in many ways. It is also an entertaining and exhilarating musical that will have your foot tapping in much the same way Chicago did. It is a story of success and triumph. And it is also a love story, and in a way, much more interesting then many others on film, because this one is real. Walk The Line is my favorite film of the year so far and though I know it may not stay that way (there are at least two other movies coming out this year I suspect maybe up there) I still believe it's a perfect 10. What Walk The line also does so beautifully is connect with the Audience. Watching this movie makes one wish they had known Johnny Cash and June Carter cash. It gets you involved very deeply, but more then involved, more like utterly immersed. This movie is destined to become a classic. It really is, as mentioned above, a breath of fresh air, because of how truly well done on all levels it is (and that's a rarity.) There is a radiance to Walk The line one does not see often and I could see this becoming one of my favorite films ever. My vote is 10 of 10 and I hope this movie continues to generate a lot of buzz and people continue to support it and the talent involved. I had a great time seeing this and hope many others feel the same.",10,4,8,24 November 2005
50 First Dates," Charming romantic Barrymore/Sander movie with some great moments and gorgeous scenery but not as great as wedding singer.
","Let me start by saying this movie was actually much better then the previews made it out to be which is a plus because it's usually the other way around in movie land. Secondly,I found there to be both positives and negatives about 50 first dates. On the plus side, this movie works solely because of the chemistry between Barrymore and Sander which is so wholesomely natural and real that it wouldn't surprise me if they have a movie number three in the next few years. This is a movie that varies a bit from wedding singer in that the true hilarious moments are few and far between(though there are some.) This succeeds more as a romantic comedy but more on the romance side then the comedy. The premise of Barrymore's Lucy's problem is a unique one and Sandler and Barrymore play their roles with style demonstrating their chemistry is still as strong as ever.The main negative of the movie actually isn't really a negative, more an observation that has already been noted by several IMDb reviewers. Many of the times the movie tries for wit, particularly in the beginning, it falls a bit flat. Not to give anything away to people who have yet to see this, but some of the mildly gross stuff just wasn't funny-and I didn't hear next to anyone laughing either. These jokes try WAY to hard and are actually more of an annoyance, detracting from the storyline rather then adding to the movie in any way. Anyone who goes into this expecting the exact kind of humor as wedding singer maybe disappointed, this errs way more on the side of romance and sentimentality then true hilarious comedy, whereas wedding singer had both. In my opinion, this movie was much better then expected, way above average and delightful in many respects, the romance played out between the characters was wonderful due to the reasons listed above. And there are few screen couples who have such a natural and honest screen chemistry as Barrymore and Sandler.The scenery I must mention as well,because it is absolutely wonderful. This movie could also serve as a tourism advertisement for the state of Hawai, the setting was that beautiful. All in all, I am glad I saw 50 first dates, it was a delightful and very good movie with some very poignant moments, but I still prefer wedding singer, which is one of my favorite movies in the world. But 50 First Dates, all in all, is a great movie and I'm sure I will watch this again at some point. My rating is 8, maybe even 8.5 of of 10.",8,0,1,21 February 2004
Ghost," Still has the power to make you cry.
","Ghost is a movie defines the term 'tearjerker'. Despite being a really bittersweet story and despite being hollywood to a TEE it's a good movie. So sad and if I had to pick a movie where the tears flow through the duration this would be at the TOP of the list-still despite it's obvious tearjerker build up, this is a beautiful HAUNTING movie. Once in awhile people are cast in a movie who are so right for their roles you just can't picture anyone else who could play them. This is such a case, partcularly with Swayze who was wonderful and Demi Moore, despite having gone onto more of the 'tough girl' kind of roles shines here-and I'm not even a major fan of hers. Moore is best when playing a more soft kind of role and here she is about as good as it gets. Ghost is definetly on its way to being a classic-or maybe it already is. It's definety one of the best love stories to come out of the 90's and still remains a beautiful addition to the romance genre of movies.",8,6,9,3 February 2004
Marie Antoinette," surprisingly disappointing.
","SPOILERS:I was really disappointed in this movie and I read some of the reviews and it appears I am not the only one. While I would not rate this a 1 or a 2, or even say it was bad or horrible, it WAS a major disappointment as well as one of the more baffling movies I have seen in awhile. At times it almost seems rather funnily disappointing, as if it was done deliberately. While that's obviously not the case,(who sets out to make a disappointing film ON PURPOSE?), I was left at the end not just disappointed but completely weirded out.Where to begin? Well.....first is the lack of storyline development. There were many aspects of the movie that were interesting but it seems like they were developed in a way as to make them as uninteresting as possible. I was actually very interested in the marriage of Marie Antoinette and thought that the performers' did a good job. But just when the story was at it's most interesting..after all the time spent(a lot) on this plot line..it is just done. And in a 'blink and you might miss it' kind of way. It is beyond disappointing, it is really really annoying.Add to that, the lack of dialog. And what little dialog there is,can be quite mundane at times..and much of it is kind of muted. Asia Argento's character provides some brightness and drama until..HELLO!..She is written out of the movie very abruptly. In fact a lot that happen in this movie is abrupt. That is the perfect word to describe this movie. Whether it is writing various characters' out of the script, resolving long plot lines in the blink of an eye, or ending on an unusually rosy, Abrupt(yes-there's that word again) light, it seems Marie Antoinette is all things abrupt.Except of coarse, for the food. I must not forget to mention that as the long, drawn out(extremely drawn out) scenes of brightly colored food, delicious treats and people chewing, did seem in fact to be a major focus of the movie and if some of the important story lines and characters, were shown in half as much detail as the glowingly beautiful arrays of goodies this probably would have been a halfway decent movie. Alas that was not to be.Now for the good. I loved the photography. the brightly colored hues did not just pertain to the food but to the whole picture. If there had been some depth and substance to the film it really could have been great. The visual style was wonderful but very little other stuff was.I did however appreciate the use of music and though many don't like current music being used in a period piece, I sometimes do and just thought the song selections fit here.I do disagree however with people who did not think Dunst did a good job. I think she did. She is not one of my favorite actresses either. But she brought a sweetness and lovable mischievousness to the role and by the abrupt end, was able to have introduced an element of sober solemnity. I would rate her performance as one of the highlights of this movie.My vote ultimately is a 5 of 10. It isn't horrible but is sure a long way from being good and is a major disappointment.",5,3,4,22 November 2007
The Ring," Finally-maybe the first GREAT horror to come out of the last 10 years.
","The Ring, which I almost didn't originally see, being that it looked so scary, turned out to be more then I bargained for. When I did see it, I had no idea I was about to view a horror flick that actually had depth and originality! Finally, Finally- a movie where the movie makers hit it spot on!This movie blows away other supernatural thrillers like:'The Others', 'stir of echos', 'what lies beneath' and 'gothica'. It also blows away movies like 'Scream'. The ring is a heavily atmospheric, genuinely frightening film that relies almost NILL in the way of blood and gore and still manages to absolutely horrify-as well as haunt you.The Ring reminds me of the movies I grew up loving, those atmospheric horrors of the 70's and early 80's, it seems nobody MAKES anymore, like 'The Other'(NOT 'The others!) and 'Let's scare Jessica to death'. I had kind of distanced myself from the horror genre in the last decade or more actually, because there were so few truly GOOD ones around-most horrors now rely on gore and cheap effects. And the supernatural ones, many times just bore me with their unoriginality. I was exhilarated at the end of The Ring because it threw me back in time to when horrors were actually good!The acting was great. The scenes were vivid and surreal and stay with you. The photography,lighthouses, fog, scenery etc is haunting and has that air of quiet gloom where the movie is WAITING ,that is just perfectly reminisint of old school horrors. The makers of this should be proud. It also reminds one, how bad some of these other horrors can be. I actually rated 'Gothica' about a 5 or so on here and after seeing ring as a rental(after I saw gothica) I wondered why. And really BAD movies like 'what lies beneath' aren't even worth mentioning in the same breath.A good horror has to have more then the ability to scare. It has to be well made, atmospheric and if it's haunting so much the better. It has to hook you in. And as far as the sequel to the ring, The ring2 goes, I am not nor have I ever been a sequel type of person yet I am looking forward to this. I have to see it. This movie got me, hooked me and I'm GLAD! It's about time!I'm all grown up now but I bet if I'd seen The Ring as a kid, it would have scared me triple. The most frightening scene by far is :SPOILER When Samara comes walking out of the television set. Also when Aiden tells Naomi Watts :that she shouldn't have let 'her' out. Also the pictures coming out distorted which really freaked me out and it didn't help when the phone rang right after the first murder and it was late at night. Scared the heck out of me but in a good way!Only bad thing-there was a tiny bit of gore which was rather icky and not even necessary-could have lived without it-that and the horse scene which was more sad then scary. Go see The Ring-right now if you haven't. It rocks!",8,1,1,16 March 2004
Raiders of the Lost Ark," Great adventure, great story line, great special effects, great visuals, so genre specific it might not be for everyone.
","Occasinaly, there comes a movie, that you know is extraordinary in many ways and yet, because it is very specific in it's appeal, you can appreciate it while not being very deeply involved in it personally. That was the case, for me, with Raiders.A great movie to be sure and jam packed with more action and adventure them almost any other movie I've seen. Yet because, I am not a fan of this type of movie I saw it once and, while appreciating it, really had no strong desire to see it again. It is, as many of it's most ardent fans write, completely unique and I will admit certain moments got me. It's an extravaganza of adventure not often seen and one thought I had with this movie is how real it looked and felt (and how incredibly difficult to film it must have been.) But I still would would not rank it as one of my favorites. It remains a movie who's fierce beauty and power I can appreciate and have a healthy respect for while not having any strong desire to see it again-though I am glad I saw it at least once. I can appreciate this film's high rank on IMDb and understand it, if I was to cite 1 reason why I did not fall in love with Raiders, it's simply because it's just not my genre. I would estimate if I had to pick a movie that was known to be one of the best that did not appeal to me and that I did not really get into all that much, while still admiring many of it's aspects Raiders would be that movie. Although,all these years later I can still feel the film's power.",7,0,1,7 January 2005
Erin Brockovich," this is a GOOD movie.
","I saw this in the theater and loved it. I really enjoyed Erin Brokovich and it Maybe my favorite Julia Roberts movie. It is empowering, well acted, touching and given the real Erin was in it, one gets the feeling it was accurate as well. I found this movie to be both wholly absorbing from the start, and incredibly disturbing.I walked away as well, with a deep sense of admiration and respect for Erin Brokavich and was happy Julia Roberts ultimately won an academy award for her portrayal of Erin-and that's a big thing because I'm not even a major Julia Roberts fan! But she was wonderful, sassy and strong minded and very good in the role. I expected to like this movie but am not sure I expected to like it this much.This reminded me a bit of the much earlier 'Silkwood'. I would completely recommend this movie to one who hasn't seen it yet, it gets a 9 out of 10 from me and was well done on many different levels. This is a movie that deserved the hype it got.",9,1,2,10 May 2004
Meet the Parents," Not as funny as expected but still OK-but just OK.
","When I(finally) saw 'Meet the Parents' which I had heard SO much about I was expecting a lot. Maybe my expectations were to high, it definitely wasn't the laugh fest I had expected though I still kind of enjoyed it and would rate it about a 6 or so out of 10. I wouldn't really strongly recommend it though.Some of the jokes, to me, just weren't funny. Like for instance the volleyball that hits the girl in the face and the ern breaking with the ashes in it. I also thought some of the jokes directed to Greg(Stiller's character) were a bit cruel. I thought I was the only one who thought that until I read some of the other reviews on here and found that others agreed with me. Some of the jokes were funny-there were a few great one liners and fun dialog(the 'martha farker' thing, the 'milking' scene for instance)but after awhile I was just getting mad at everyone for tormenting this guy and angry at his girlfriend Pam for not sticking up for him. The movie to me rated somewhere between a 5.5 and 6 which still means I thought it was average , just not great or the '10' I thought it would be.De Nero easily steals the movie in his best role and should consider more roles in comedy, somehow he manages to keep Jack Likable through it all(even while I started hating everyone else picking on poor Greg I couldn't hate Jack)and he absolutely makes the movie, with another actor I probably wouldn't have liked it at all.The best scene in the movie was when Jack 'proposed' to Greg, THAT was great. Meet the parents was definitely not perfect but OK to see as a rental if not already seen. My vote's 5 or 6 out of 10.",6,0,1,15 December 2003
Fight Club," Love it or Hate it, it is different!
","I just watched Fight Club this week, I'd been avoiding it, mostly because I just had convinced myself I wouldn't like it. In fact, I was sure I'd hate it. OK-here goes-BOY WAS I WRONG! This movie is really really different, obviously very well made and now that I've seen it I can understand why it's ranked so high on the IMDb top movies of all time.Not to say I thought it was perfect. I did, as expected, have a problem with all the violence but that I expected and doesn't take away from the well written intelligent script, much in the same way as the Kill Bill movies which I felt the same way about. In fact, Fight Club reminded me of Kill Bill, not because the stories had any similarity whatsoever but because of the fact that their both violent, both (for lack of a better term) completely out there!, yet both very gritty and extremely intelligent. So yeah I liked Fight Club. I've read dozens of reviews on here and many mention plot and how it's one of the best movies ever made etc-so I wont even go there. What I will say is that Norton and Pitt are wonderfully matched on screen and I cannot imagine these two roles being played by anyone else. Were there ANY Oscar nominations for this movie? I don't seem to remember any which is a shame. Pitt's best role to date and maybe Norton's as well. I will say I can see where this maybe liked more by men then women. Most females I know have not and do not want to see this while most of the guys I know have seen it or plan to at some point. This movie should have been promoted in a different way because to many people think it's about nothing more then boxing and men beating each other up and that turns a lot of people off. Anyway:I admired Fight Club, I thought it was bizarre and frightening in a way and can see similarities to many movies from Clockwork Orange to Lord of the Flies. My one complaint is something that I haven't seen brought up a lot.SPOILER ALERT: I had a bit of a problem with the ending. I mean, as odd as this movie was, it wasn't over the top to the point where you roll your eyes or anything. But at the end when Norton shoots Tyler and it seems he has gotten rid of him and everything is gonna be OK... I was a bit baffled because if there was anything this movie wasn't, till that point, it was 'feel good', and that was my thought about the ending. I mean Norton's character had multiple personality disorder and all of a sudden he was over it like that? When Tyler had been such a big part of him for so long. Now it is possible I misinterpreted the ending(I've been on the message boards and everyone seems to have a different theory about what the ending really meant.) But that really did bother me since that is a pretty serious thing and it seemed a little unrealistic the way it was done but hey this is a movie.Anyway, I still don't know if I'd rank this in the top 35 movies of all time but I have no problem understanding how this could be someone's favorite movie, it was very well done and is probably the type of movie any film school student should study(though I could also see how this wouldn't be for everyone). I'd give it an 8.5 out of 10. And I'll say it again, Pitt and Norton-both should have been nominated, great performances.",8,3,8,11 March 2005
Monster," Charlize Theron is an extraordinary actress.
","How could I not go see a film where Ebert's review mentions Theron's performance as one of the best(or maybe he said THE best-can't remember) female performances in cinema history? I went, saw it and must say that Ebert is right.Theron is extraordinary in this. It's NOT just the physical transformation but the overall perfermance in general. If she doesn't get the oscar this year, it would be very much a letdown. As far as the movie goes,the direction is incredible, it captures the time period to a tee, as does the music in the film. I had heard that Theron wrote a personal letter to Journey's Steve Perry requesting the use of 'Don't stop Believing' in the skating scene. I'm glad it was used as it captures the essense of the scene and time period wonderfully.I'm not going to wax poetic on everything-first the negatives- this is a VERY VERY difficult film to sit through. It is not for the faint of heart. Certain scenes are so horrific you might have to look away from the screen and you will be shocked and unerved. HOWEVER- If you think you can deal with those things, see this. While I don't think this is the best movie ever made, I do think it is one of the most well acted, and also a fascinating, powerful character study. I would also like to mention as amazing as Theron is, not enough praise has Gone to Christina Ricci, who as Shelby is pretty darn good in her role and I would love her to receive a supporting actress nod, she certainly deserves it. The interaction between the two female leads is fascinating. All the acting is great, not just Theron and Ricci, Bruce dern as well as the various other people including the victims are acted on a leval of pure excellence.  Any major film buff who can appreciate amazing acting and direction will want to see this although as mentioned-it is NOT for the faint of heart. Although I think this movie is very very welldone it'd be hard to sit through it again, although seeing it once, I know now when to 'look away'. One other thing I will mention is this movie doesn't drag-not for one moment-which is in itself kind of rare-And lastly-I hope to see Charlize making the acceptance speech come oscar time.",8,0,0,17 January 2004
Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl," Originally a skeptic, it got to me! A mighty fun adventure!
","SPOILERS THROUGH:Well believe it or not I just saw this movie! Up till now I had no desire to see it. I'm not a particular fan of pirate movies and not a big fan of action/adventure type flicks(though that's been changing a bit in the last few years.) But I have to admit I have been curious. So many people I know have seen it and told me I am really missing out on something special. So I did indeed see it this week. And the movie got me! I thought it was excellent.As has been mentioned, the best part of the movie is Johnny Depp. Now I'm not exactly a huge Depp fan. I appreciate him and do think he's an amazing actor but have never taken to him as strongly as some other actors. But I have to say, his portrayal of Jack Sparrow was brilliant and easily the best role I've ever seen him in. Depp takes this role and Creates an unforgettable history making movie character. His Sparow is fun, funny, mischievous, lovable and quirky. He definitely made The movie for me.And the cinematography is fantastic. The movie rippled with adventure and drew the viewer in immediately. The campy fun atmosphere was perfect as was the larger then life quality. If one's ever been on the famous pirate ride, they will find things they recognize about it too. And Bloom was very good as was Kneightly as the fiery pirate loving Elizabeth. Perfect casting.The movie may have been a little long for me and I won't say there weren't a few draggy moments but by and large this was a wonderful adventurous ride and I really felt bad I didn't see it when I originally came out though I'm not sure I'd have appreciated it as much then, if I had. As mentioned, I had been gradually getting more into these type of flicks and I think the more appreciation one has for the action/Adventure film the more they will appreciate this though it is the type of film one can enjoy without necessarily being a major fan of pirates and sword fighting. The reason that is so, is because, simply put, these characters are fun and different as is the movie and there are moments of pure exhilaration. That's something that a good adventure movie needs(actually almost any type of movie) and Pirates has it. It is so utterly unique it isn't surprising to me now that it has received so much recognition though I admit I didn't get it before I saw it.Not that there were not some negatives. The biggest one is the length of some of the sword fighting scenes. Some of them I thought, just went on an unbearably long time, particularly the one toward the end. It did get to the point where it really became a little numbing and unless one is terribly into the sword fighting element I think a lot of people might feel that way. I'm not sure how long the last sequence was but it seemed like hours. I wish that had been a bit shorter. One scene I loved though, was the fight between Depp and Bloom in the beginning. That was excellent and one of my favorite scenes.So....I would give this an 8.5 out of 10 and can't wait to see Pirates two which I will be doing very soon. I'd recommend this to anyone who hasn't seen it and maybe Skeptical. It's a mighty fine time!!!!",8,4,9,29 July 2006
"The Chronicles of Narnia: The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe"," The movie many of us have waited our lives for.
","SPOILERS THROUGH:This is going to be a hard movie to review because it will be nearly impossible to keep my objectivity. Let me begin by saying I grew up with this book. I don't remember exactly how old I was when I read it, I just know how much it meant to me and the feelings of childhood magic it produced in me. Through the years, I've read it on occasion and those feelings never fail to be stirred again and again and again. Narnia the movie, is something myself and probably millions of other enamored fans have waited their lives for. I always wondered why this hadn't been done as a major film before and always felt somewhat of a yearning. So finally it was and I saw it yesterday. And it was wonderful.I think the movie version of The Lion, The Witch and The Wardrobe is a joy to view. Absolutely captivating and incredibly done. One positive were the special affects, particularly Aslan. I simply could not believe the realism in every last detail, especially the facial expressions. It was almost mind numbing and such a relief when one thinks about what it could have been like.Mystery, magic, that feeling of timelessness-it was all there, most prevalently at the very beginning, when the words :Presents: 'The chronicles of Narnia, The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe', went up on screen. For anyone who has loved this book and craved a movie version of it, this was not just a moment, it was THE moment. At least for me it was. The performers were great and it was like meeting old friends (and enemies!). First, All four children were terrific , I never cease to be amazed that people of that young age can act! It's awe inspiring. I'm not going to say any were better then the others, all were great. So was that wacky, Wondercful professor ('what DO they teach them in school these days'?!).And now we come to the White Witch. Now when this movie was first being made I had heard a rumor (which I don't even know if it was true) that Nicole Kidman was asked to play the white witch. I am a fan so I was very pleased. So much time later, when I heard she was not, in fact, cast as The White Witch, I was a bit disappointed. I needn't have been! Tilda Swinton rocked! She was just fantastic (best supporting actress nod should be hers). She made the part her own in a wonderful way. Swinton was electric, her white witch was spot on and also looked the way the white witch SHOULD look. Kudos!All the supporting characters-real or otherwise-were great. But I really must mention Aslan again. Liam Nielson's voice was perfect but the facial expressions still amaze me, modern technology is also something worth being in awe of. Also worth mentioning was the great, utterly wonderful musical score.But most importantly is the fact that this movie was adapted from the book so faithfully. I was amazed by that and by how much of the dialog was verbatim or nearly so. Certain things were exact, other things varied a bit but were for the most part in keeping with the book, though there Were a few things missing that I'd have liked to see (Edmond being knighted by Aslan after the battle was won for one). Overall though, very little varied greatly and that is such a relief and a tribute to the wonderful book and it's brilliant author, C.S. Lewis.The negatives? None really. I have searched for some, since I do want to have some objectivity. Others have mentioned that it would have been nice to have a narrator, that was something I had thought of too, after seeing it. One because the narrator could have explained some things that the book explained and the movie does not. And second because one aspect to the book that made it so magical WAS the narration of C.S. Lewis. It would have been nice to have a Narrator woven in somehow.I will say that there is one thing I was a tad bit disappointed in and that is the fact that Narnia, while beautiful, majestic and magical didn't look to me, beautiful, majestic and magical enough. I wanted it to be the most beautiful thing I had ever seen-surpassing the cinematography in any movie ever made. It didn't. Although Narnia was beautiful to look at and became more beautiful as the movie deepened, it never blossomed into the most visually beautiful movie in the World. I wanted Narna to look like the magical place of wonder I had in my mind growing up. It did and it didn't. It kind of did but not quite to the extent I would have liked. I was considering giving the movie a 9 because of that and not a 10.But then I expressed this view to a confidante and fellow movie goer who made an excellent point. That perhaps no movie version could ever be quite that beautiful and magical because it would be competing against a version that didn't come from anything actually seen, but from a child's imagination. And that really is true. All the millions of people who read this book were free to imagine Narnia in any way they wanted. To me, when thinking about it, the movie still deserves a 10 of 10 rating. It really is magic that a story that was told so many years ago, still has remained so loved over the years. The Chronicles of Narnia:The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe meant so much to me as a kid (and adult) and it means so much to me to have seen it on the big screen, a movie for all seasons, rich in story and still as magical as ever.",10,1,2,18 December 2005
The Notebook," magnificent
","SPOILERS ALL THROUGH: The Notebook may leave one speechless after watching it. This movie was one of the best love stories I've ever seen. I was so moved by it, I watched it a second time shortly after seeing it for the first time. The Notebook was absolutely outstanding and without a doubt one of the best love stories I've ever watched.The acting was of the highest caliber, the photography was gloriously stunning, and the story was so bittersweet and touching, it was almost to much so. For love story purists this movie's poignancy will envelop you. If one does not have a high tolerance for these types of films they should probably stay away.This movie has been compared to Love Story but I Happened to have enjoyed The Notebook a lot more. The main negative is it is almost to bittersweet. It is draining and exhausting to watch but the film maintained an old style quality that makes it seem like this should have come out many years ago. It is unique and an instant classic. These days, a movie like this just doesn't come around to often. Judging from both the critical and viewer acclaim this film has received, maybe more of these types of films should come around.There is nothing I can say to do justice to the performers who went above and beyond mere excellence. If I could only pick one performer to give an award to, however, it would have to be James Garner. Was he even nominated? His performance was pure, powerful and flawless. It Was as Oscar worthy as anyone's I've ever seen and I think this movie should have been nominated as well as all of the four main Performers.The Notebook is sweet and nostalgic. It's also powerful, luminescent, graceful and visually lovely. It also contains one of the most powerful endings I have ever seen, and that's no exaggeration. Again-if one is not a fan of this genre they should stay away but for fans of romantic dramas, this one is a must see. The Notebook is an utterly magnificent film.",9,0,0,22 October 2005
Elizabeth," An interesting, sometimes intense movie.
","I had been wanting to see the movie 'Elizabeth' for quite awhile. I had heard such good things about it, from friends and reviews on here. I had that chance recently, and have to admit it was a pretty good movie. Cate Blanchett plays a wonderful Elizabeth, the character development is rich and interesting to watch. This movie has a somewhat long running time but the time passes quickly and that's a plus. Your also drawn in from the beginning, to the duplicity, deception and numerous motivations of the many around her. One thing 'Elizabeth' certainly isn't is boring.If one has always been fascinated by royalty, this movie is just about the perfect choice. I was and am,one who does have a strong interest in that, growing up I read many a book about kings and queens etc etc. 'Elizabeth' creates the feeling of the royal court wonderfully. And I mustn't forget to mention the cinematography either which is wonderful.Elizabeth is a movie I liked a whole lot while never actually loving. I think that's because of the Amount of characters and the ambiguity of virtually all of them. So many characters are introduced, many peoples' motives are never revealed fully, it's absolutely,a movie, where if your distracted for a second or two you lose a great deal. While the character development for Elizabeth is darn near perfect it's not there as much in anybody else. Still, The story of Elizabeth is a fascinating one and this is an absorbing and good movie. My vote is 7.5 out of 10.",7,1,2,22 March 2004
The Girl Next Door," The movie that wouldn't end.
","Girl next door was an interesting movie choice. I went in not expecting much. For the first half hour or 40 minutes I thought I was wrong. The movie had a heart! It seemed reminiscent of those old style 80's teen comedies I love so much. Risky business, as others have mentioned, a little sixteen candles etc etc. So I relaxed and began to get into the movie. Unfortunately, I was wrong yet again.This movie-correction-the MAJORITY of this movie wasn't good. If they could have made this movie with just the first 40 minutes and the last 5 or so, they'd have a keeper, but the middle just torpedoed the whole thing. Here is why. And yes:there will be some SPOILERS:The movie becomes preposterous-violent, corny, not funny and TEDIOUS. It becomes the movie that will not end. There are exhausting tiresome twists thrown in virtually every five minutes that did nothing for me except give me a headache I did not want.This had the potential to be great. It started promisingly enough. Danielle and Matt have lots of chemistry-she brings out his wild side-it's fun and breezy. But the movie just throws to many unfunny pointless curb balls and quickly becomes less a comedy then a wanna be boogie nights-teen style. And it doesn't work. It loses its focus and becomes more then mediocre, just bad. So many scenes are thrown in that are obviously just fillers. They don't need to be there and are not funny-just pointless.We were very disappointed in girl next door-we actually almost walked out at 1 point but the movie was winding up at that point anyway. Although, as mentioned there WERE parts that were good, the movie skimmed over the good parts while highlighting the stupid ones.Kelly should NOT have morphed into A thug-he should have stayed funny if a bit slick. He was great up until the kidnapping scene which was just dumb.There should have been more scenes of Danielle and Mathew falling in love-such great chemistry! such under use of ALL that chemistry!The movie should have wound up at least 20 minutes before it did-maybe more.The end was ridiculous-how did Kelley even know they had MADE that tape? Tedious-and maybe the movie should have wound up with the whole scholarship dinner.In closing-I'd give this 3 out of 10-though the beginning and last few minutes gets an 8 and the soundtrack gets an easy 10. This is not, the worst movie I've ever seen at all-(although pretty bad)-but it wasn't anything near what it could have been.",3,1,4,11 April 2004
How to Lose a Guy in 10 Days," light bubbly comedy
","SPOILERS THROUGHOUT: OK-I am the first to admit this movie had flaws. It was quite ridiculous in some areas and many scenes aren't as funny as they should be. It still warrants an above average rating though. This is mainly because of Kate Hudson. I doubt that had anybody else played this role I'd have tuned into this movie for more then 10 minutes. But she plays this role very well. Hudson has a naturally mischievous quality that lends itself well to a movie such as this and makes one want to watch. So I did.I think there were a few problems with this movie, one being some of the jokes become a little more obnoxious then funny and come very close to wearing out their welcome. There's also the problem that no matter which way you look at it, and no matter how unbelievable many romantic comedies are, these two people BOTH having bets going on simultaneously, is almost just to much. I think it would have maybe been better to just have Hudson involved in the whole bet thing and concentrate more on the wit factor.The other problem I had with 10 days, is the ending. I'm SO tired of all these romantic comedies ending the same way. One's about to leave town(usually the female) and then the male lead goes racing after her....I wish this movie hadn't done that, it's getting SO overdone, we get the same ending almost every time. The movie was somewhat creative, so I ask, couldn't a more creative, WITTY ending been used? They still could have wound up together just not in the same standard bland way!The movie's main positive was Hudson who made this occasionally laugh out loud hysterical. Some things WERE very funny and the wit came not just from the stunts Hudson pulled but from Hudson herself. Like her mother, Kate Hudson has a wonderful sense of comedic timing, great facial expressions and she had me roaring in some places. I loved the line where she says something similar to: 'I love you but I don't like you right now', turns away and then mouths what she just said with an expression of utter befuddlement. That's just one example but the fact is, though this movie had some problems the movie makers hired the right leading lady and that's the main reason I'm giving this a 6 of 10. This is not going to go down as one of the greatest romantic comedies ever made (though I think it really could have been even funnier.) But for what it is it's not a bad way to spend some time. My vote is 6 of 10.",6,0,0,30 April 2005
That Thing You Do!," Wholesome
","SPOILERS THROUGHOUT:That Thing You Do is a sweet and fun movie that's enjoyable to watch, particularly when one just wants to relax. While it doesn't have the edge of some other films I've seen dealing with bands and music, what it does have is rare to find and that's wholesomeness. There is a sweet wholesome quality through the whole movie and it's mood is contagious. Definitely a fun movie to watch.I will say that the most interesting characters for me, were not the guys in the band, they were Tom Hanks himself and Liv Tyler who's darling here as Fay. I liked the fact that these characters were not over the top and were very believable. I wouldn't really refer to this as that much of a comedy, it doesn't have a lot of fall down in your seat funny lines. What it does have though is sweetness. You may not laugh constantly but you sure will smile a lot.The main thing I was surprised about was the ending which was kind of abrupt and I really did feel should have been longer. I wasn't to into the updates at the end, the 'where they are nows', to me things were just wrapped up awfully quickly and I didn't expect the movie to end that abruptly. Maybe it should have been longer.This movie has a great reputation and I can see why, it makes a nice view and almost seems like it's from another time period. My vote on this one is 7 of 10 and a recommended viewing, particularly to any music lover.",7,2,3,24 April 2005
The Others," A very well acted movie with an intriguing plot but too slow moving.
","This was a reasonably good movie that did not remind me of Sixth Sense as it did others but had it's own unique premise. I found the cinematography to be absolutely breathtaking, the atmosphere mysterious, and the Ghost Story intriguing. Also Nicole Kidman was every bit as good if not better in this then she was in Moulon Rouge so I don't know why she did not get an Oscar nomination. Anyway....In spite of all the positives-I didn't LIKE the movie all that much-oh it was all right, it was I suppose a 6, maybe a 6.5 but not much more. The movie had 2 major flaws in my mind and kept the film from being truly great.1)WAY TOO slow going-after awhile you stop being interested and become simply impatient-as interesting as the central plot is, how many times can children gasp and Nicole Kidman look scared until the audience loses their patience? Which brings me to:2)The type of scare tactics used. SPOILER ALERT: Oh me Oh my-WAY TOO MUCH-doors that open by themselves,scary music, cliché cliché Cliché-it's to bad-watching this all I could think at times was how Redundant they were making it-there should have been more Truly frightening scenes like The daughter changing shape and when Nicole and the kids realize their dead and the table starts shaking and the camera shows them yelling and....their is NOBODY there! Awesome! Scary too! Alas, too much time was wasted on creaky noises and people saying 'who's there?'So I'd have to say The Others is an OK movie but not a classic. I feel Sixth Sense was actually a much better movie. But this performance from Nicole was outstanding and up there as one of her best.",6,0,1,11 November 2003
Troy," Where did the time go?
","This was an extraordinary movie but one's enjoyment of 'Troy' will depend entirely on the attitude one has when going into the theater.I knew the story from a very long time ago and while I remember the basic story I do not, I freely admit, remember the details. For me however, it did not matter how accurate the movie was because I went into Troy with the attitude that it would not be accurate at all. This IS Hollywood. Few movies of this type are gonna stick to the facts. There are many reasons to go see a movie. In the case of Troy, I went to be entertained. I wanted to be swept away into the exciting legend, into the adventure of it all. And I was. And that's why I would recommend Troy so strongly to people who want that particular movie experience. The movie was also well acted, exciting, touching, thought provoking and beautifully filmed.Firstly-I will comment on Brad Pitt who has been getting a lot of flack for reasons that are beyond me. This was Pitt's problem in Legends of the fall too. He's simply to handsome for people at times to take seriously and that's doing both him and the moviegoer a disservice because he's truly excellent in this and his Archilles possesses intensity, fierceness-and humility. Pitt started off OK and got better, this wasn't an instant 'wow' more of a slow burn. He managed to move me to tears in one or two scenes so I'd say he did his job. In fact, I will not fault the acting of anybody, all were good in their roles, but the two who it would be criminal NOT to receive Oscar nods are Peter O' toole and Eric Bana, both of whom were electrifying. This wasn't Pitt's fault, the other two just had more to work with. Diane Krueger was certainly beautiful enough to incite a war but her character was a bit cookie cutter, Helen's dialog WAS a bit weak, as was Orlando Bloom's, we never really know just WHY these two fall in love with each other, their interaction together was a bit weak, even their love scenes were a bit-well-DULL. I know Helen wasn't meant to be a main character but she could have been given a little bit stronger character development.I will say Eric Bana should become a household name after this performance, he was outstanding and O'Toole's scene with Pitt was as close to perfect as a movie scene can possibly be. Visually, the movie is amazing(the scenery etc) and the music was great too. I really do think this movie isn't just good but excellent. In spite of all the positives, Troy's not perfect. There are a few other negatives I'll admit. The battle scenes were a bit gory but that is to be expected. What bothered me was the graininess of some of the battle scenes. Was it me or were there a lot of spots that were just blurry? All my friends noticed that too, the cameras seemed out of focus or something, that detracted a bit and is one of my only criticisms along with what I call 'The Blond factor'.What I mean by that is this: where did Helen of Troy have blonde hair? Wasn't she a brunette?(I'll admit I could be wrong on that though.) In fact, everyone in the movie was so BUFF, it was a bit hard to take seriously at times. I don't think there's a female on this planet who could say that Brad Pitt did not look extremely handsome in this film, even if one isn't personally attracted to him, one would probably admit this guy looked extremely sexy. But he probably would have been taken more seriously if he had dyed his hair black and not been so BUFFED-there were so many shots of Pitt's muscles that after awhile, no matter how visually pleasing that may be, one has to think: yeah, this is how their planning to get people into the movie.I don't mean to be overly critical at all because this was a truly extraordinary film but it did, at times, look like a party for a model agency with all those perfect people. EVEN THE BABY had those big blue eyes and sunny smile.... And: WARNING: END SPOILER: When Brad Pitt dies he sure manages to look absolutely stunning-I mean unlike everybody else, there's little blood or gore or ANYTHING-it's a bit much. However, those are minor quibbles because the movie's positives easily outweigh any negatives there may be.I still think this is an easy 8.5 of 10 maybe even a 9-it's got a lot to like-action, adventure, intense Oscar worthy performances, humility, fun and very importantly, moves at an electrically fast pace which is why I chose to head this review: where did the time go. This is a three hour movie and by the time it ended I was puzzled because it felt like maybe an hour had gone by. That is the mark of good movie, when you not only don't notice the time going by but actually think it was way to short. Troy turned out better then I thought, they could have really botched this but as it was, it was about 2 points higher then I thought it would be(I thought maybe a 6.5 or 7). I think if someone comes into this with no other expectations then to be swept away for three hours they will like this. 8.5 or 9 out of 10 and I hope to see a few Oscar noms.",8,3,6,16 May 2004
Dead Poets Society," Robin Williams is Extraordinary in his best role.
","This is a beautiful touching Film. This was the type of inspirational movie there's nothing really bad to say about at all. Everyone was magnificent in this particularly Robin Williams who does some truly beautiful, moving, acting and establishes himself as far more then a comedy actor. This is also a movie(if by chance you HAVEN'T seen-bring a lot of tissue-you will need it as you'll probably be crying your eyes out!)My only complaint isn't about the film but about the fact(and I could be wrong on this) that I didn't see it in the IMDb top 250-now maybe I just missed it-but if any movie deserves to be included this one does. A must see if one hasn't already seen it.",10,0,1,28 November 2003
Brokeback Mountain," Brokeback Mountain- a moving and powerful film.
","SPOILERS THROUGH:I'll start by saying right away that Brokeback Mountain is a haunting, touching and powerful film. I have no doubt this film will win many awards and it should. I'd been looking forward to it and luckily this is one that did not let me down.I hate to echo a line that so many others have already said but it happens to be true so I will. This is SO MUCH more then a 'gay cowboy' movie which is what many have pigeonholed it as. This movie is about the love between two men true enough. But it contains so much to it. One does not need to be gay to appreciate this. However, if one is bothered by the subject matter or does not like dramas, love stories, period films or films with a western theme it is probably not for them.To me Brokeback Mountain is about love yes but also innocence. Jack and Ennis are two men both played with enthralling intensity by Gylanthal and Ledger, who have loved each other and gone on to make other lives for themselves. Their lives are full, if not happy ones but as time goes on, it's clear to these men and to the audience how one summer on Brokeback Mountain has shaped them and how much they mean to each other. This is really a movie you feel as well as see.Brokeback Mountain is not fast moving, it does not get in one's face with it's forcefulness, to the contrary the movie moves extremely slowly and just sort of starts to envelop you in the lives of the people on the screen, their sadness, longing and dreams. It's subtle, quiet and touching. It is powerful. It makes you cry but not in the way certain tragic romances do, although there is certainly tragedy involved here. But this is a more quiet and almost mysterious kind of powerful. Nothing's milked, it kind of just appears on screen. The movie is always quiet and vibrant as a summer's breeze. It's bittersweet.Ledger and Gylenthal are both simply incredible. In their performances and their scenes together, they are able to show a large range of emotions as we see these individuals experience so much. We see love, passion, anger, tenderness, yearning, playfulness and friendship. Those are the things that this movie is about.There are certain scenes in this movie that need no dialog as they are tenderly touching in and of themselves. One example is when Ennis dissolves into tears in Jack's arms. Another beautiful scene enfolds as these men play together and jump into the water on Brokeback Mountain. And at the end in a very intense moment, Ennis clasps Jack's shirt and smells it. These scenes tell as much about these individual's relationship as any line of Dialogue.My one complaint isn't with the film, it is that Gylenthal is not getting the buzz that Ledger is and that should not be the case because he is outstanding and as good as Ledger. I first really took note of Gylenthal in 'The Good Girl' where I found him incredible but in Brokeback Mountain he is even better then that. Gylenthal's Jack inspires so many emotions and with Gylenthal it's all in the eyes. There are certain performers who can convey as much with their expressions as with any dialog and that is the case here. Gylenthal is a gifted and Brilliant actor and is certainly destined to leave a strong mark on the world of cinema.Ledger too is wonderful but he has been getting so much buzz it's almost not necessary to say that. There were certain things I'd have liked to see in Brokeback Mountain, more of Jack and Ennis's relationships with their wives for one, as well as pumping up the volume a bit-it got kind of difficult to understand every line of dialog sometimes. I still think that it's one of the best films of the year.And of coarse there is the brilliant direction by Ang Lee and the almost unreal,untouched beauty of Brokeback Mountain. This movie may haunt afterward and for people who WANT to see this, one thing it probably won't do is disappoint. My vote's 10 of 10.",10,30,35,8 January 2006
Home Alone," Sickeningly sweet-TO SWEET.
","If I had to pick a movie that was a smash that did absolutely nothing for me Home Alone would be at the top of the list. Oh, I'm not saying the movie was awful. But overated yes and after all these years, I still don't get the appeal.I'm an adult but was fairly young when this came out-and I love all types of movies. This movie's premise bothered me, seeing a kid get terrorized by robbers,even in a comedic sense, was not my cup of tea and I spent most of the movie feeling sorry for the poor kid who got left behind and wishing the movie would end. Yes, Mcauley Culkin was cute-but aside from that, I don't think Home Alone rates more then a 5.5 maybe a 6. I have definetly seen better kid movies, family movies etc. It was hyped so much and so sickeningly sappy, the most I could say about it is that it's a 'cute' little movie.",5,7,16,3 December 2003
L.A. Confidential," got so much right where so many other movies get the same things so wrong....
","SPOILERS:I had to comment on this movie because I just watched 'The Black Dahlia' recently and the difference between the two films is quite extreme. LA Confidential is a great movie. It's received so much recognition and has so many positive comments I don't even know what to say about it. But everything that's wrong with certain other, similar films, is what's right about this one.The cast is great. The story isn't GOOD, it's fascinating and plays out in a way that's transfixing. I must agree with many that there are few movies of this kind around today and that's a shame. But there's not much negative to say on this one because the film gets just about everything right....and how common is that? I won't single out any one member of the cast but will say that my one complaint is that Kim Bassenger is the only one who won an Acadeny Award for this film. And I am glad she won an academy award because I'm a major Bassenger fan and always felt she was under rated. But there were other films she was better in then this one. And there's so many others in this film who were as good or honestly even better-where were their awards? There are certain films that one watches where it's almost unbelievable that they or the performers, don't receive even more recognition and this is definitely such a film.Basically anyone who likes Film Noir or just a really good film with a sensational cast, intelligent writing and a fascinating plot should check this out. My vote's 9.5 out of 10.",9,3,5,10 March 2007
Match Point," Mesmerizing, very very disturbing and without a doubt one of the best of the year.
","SPOILERS THROUGHOUT: Match Point is so well made and so mesmerizing that it's actually disappointing when the film ends. It is an excellent, extremely impressive drama and it's true that this is definitely not a typical Woody Allen film.I'm actually not a major Allen fan. One of the reasons I was looking forward to seeing this was because I had heard how different it was from the usual Allen film, darker and much more Noirish then what you'd expect from Allen. It sounded like something I'd like and I did. This is definitely academy award worthy and it's also really really disturbing.The theme of the film, as anyone who has seen it knows, is the importance of luck in determining -well-pretty much everything in one's life. It really makes one think in the way many films don't. This film inspired an all night discussion between myself and several of my friends and it's not any film that could do that.The fact that this could be true-that it all comes down to luck-is actually a very disturbing thing and as far as the way Match Point's story unravels, it is topnotch. The performances were wonderful and the audience is kept on the edge of their seat from the beginning. Match Point manages to avoid a lot of negatives other films don't. (It's not overly long, not boring, the dialog is sharp, the characters are fascinating and the story compelling.) It goes way beyond being a very good film and goes into being an excellent one.The atmosphere itself is perfect. The musical score is almost hypnotic and the opera music that comes and goes throughout increases the compelling aspect of the picture. The imagery of the scene when Johanson runs into the lush fields in the rain must be mentioned as well. The whole movie is curiously subdued but had an energy about it where you know the film is gathering momentum, that is palpable. The ending is chilling and as mesmerizing as the rest of the film. This really is a must see.As for negatives there are a few. First was the ghost sequence. Not that I did not think that fit-I did. But I am still confused as to whether that was through Chris's eyes, or was the dream of the police officer. I am still completely unsure of that.There were also some plot holes in the last act that I'd have liked to have been explained. For example, if the police had Nola's diary then they must have known she had given Chris an ultimatum and was threatening to tell his wife. They had to have known from the diary, the frequency of which Nola and Chris were together, that she was pregnant and that he was having difficulty telling his wife. And yet, from the beginning, way before the old lady's ring is found, with the exception of the one officer, nobody seems to think Chris would do it. That's not just luck, that's something beyond, almost unbelievable. Because in reality, he'd probably be the prime suspect.Adding to that, is the fact that there is a witness. The 'friend' Nola confides in. When Chris calls Nola, the friend asks Nola if that's 'him'. The implication at least, is that Nola has told her friend all about Chris and their story. If the friend knew that Nola was leaving to meet Chris, wouldn't that put him under suspicion right away? These maybe minor points, but they are the reason I'd give this a 9 over a 10, even though I enjoyed this more then almost any film I've seen this year. This movie is very well made and it will get under your skin and really disturb in a way most films do not. Brokeback Mountain still deserves the Oscar, in my opinion, but Match Point, being this well made, really deserved a nomination as did some of the performers.One other thing that was a little hard for me to buy was how much everyone loved Chris from the beginning. And that is because, to me, Chris lacked any charm whatsoever. There was no charisma there, he was almost robotic and so it was difficult for me to believe absolutely everyone would want to be around this guy. (It didn't surprise me so much with the women in his life because almost everyone in the world, at one point or other falls for someone that others may not like.) But SO MANY people loved this guy from the women, to his buddies and his wife's family, coworkers etc. Chris, to me, seemed cold, stilted and not really present in an emotional sense, from the beginning so I couldn't understand why everyone wanted to be near this guy. But then again....maybe he's just lucky.In closing, Woody Allen fan or not...if you want a film that will inspire discussion you've found your dream here. 9 of 10 and a must see.",9,1,2,5 February 2006
Crash," I didn't find it that enjoyable but I did find it moving, well written, complex and thought provoking.
","SPOILERS THROUGH:Crash seems to be a love it or hate it type film but I'm in between on that. I found the themes explored here to be relevant and the movie left me moved, wound up and a bit shaken. There was not a performer here who did not deliver and the pure intensity of the performers and the film in general is enveloping from the beginning. Even if one had never heard of this film and did not know what it was about coming in, one can tell within the first five minutes what the message will be. Crash is definitely a movie with a message and it's unrelenting in it's force and energy. Throughout the two hours or so, this movie played for I don't think I moved once.In spite of the positives, I can't say I really enjoyed this nor do I have a difficult time understanding why someone would not like it. Crash is really really heavy and at times brutal. I understand the people in saying that the movie is unrealistic because of all the coincidences that happen but I really think, though some of the individual stories maybe unrealistic, the complexities and attitudes of many in the film, are both realistic and sad.Crash is a movie that is very uncomfortable to watch at times. There is a feeling that your eavesdropping into peoples' lives and it is almost impossible not to be a bit shaken and want to talk about the film afterward. I found the ensemble cast to be great and the film's writing to be excellent. It's an impressive film.If I were to voice any negatives, it actually would not be the coincidence factor, it would be the fact that it is very difficult just to relax and enjoy the film at any moment for any length of time. Virtually every scene has either something bad happening, or the sense that something bad is right around the corner and in my opinion the musical score took away from the film, not because it wasn't a good musical score but because it seemed more suited for a horror movie. The music quickly overshadowed the film and due to the constant rising and falling of the music, there was the sense constantly that something terrible was about to happen. Almost everything seemed like foreshadowing and it was hard not to get caught up in wondering which character was about to get killed, beaten up or screamed at next. This, to me, actually took away from the movie's message because your so busy wondering about this or that, there's very little ability to just sit back and watch the film unfold.In spite of the fact I didn't ENJOY this, it was a much better then average movie. I wouldn't give this the Oscar but I could see any of the performers being recognized and I really was impressed by the screenplay, the cleverness of the writing and the emotional depth of the film. All the performers(really, all of them!) were great but I must single out Matt Dillon who stunned me with one of the most intense ensemble performances I've ever seen and the chemistry of all the people working together was great. This wasn't one of the more enjoyable films of the year but it was one of the most forceful and deserves the recognition it has been getting. My vote's 8 of 10.",8,3,9,12 February 2006
The Beach," Should have been called-Lord of the flies-where they are now.
","The Beach was a very odd movie experience for me. On the plus side, this was visually beautiful. What a feast for the eyes!  Being a person who craves visually beautiful movies, that was a plus for me. Unfortunetly, the minuses are everything else. This movie was a letdown. It just was. It started out ok, not really great but maybe passable.Strong visuals from the start. Haunting. I thought it was going to be very David Lynch at first, it had that feel. Decaprio plays the drifter who wants to find paradise for the soul and he and a young french couple find it, in the form of a secluded beach populated by strange people, which comes to include the three above mentioned individuals.Great premise-but the movie itself didn't pull it off. I'm still not sure what The Beach was trying to do. Or say. WARNING-THESE NEXT LINES WILL CONTAIN PLOT SPOILERS: The whole thing went from, if not spellbinding, at least surreal and a bit arty, to 'Lord of the flies-where they are now'. It was almost ridiculous. I soon tuned out, as the story became preposterous and almost a takeoff on a movie that I had seen in its ORIGINAL and loved dearly.
I have read many reviews on the beach, none very good, and I honestly understand why(although many times I don't agree with critics). This could have been SO SO good. It had an interesting story but ultimately dissolved into senselessness. The film didn't need to borrow from other films, it showed some promise of early magic-although I never felt it was GREAT, I did feel it had the potential to haunt me.So, in closing, I have to say I didn't much like this movie but I may, unlike with most films I don't like, give it a second viewing(maybe not alone this time.) I would like to see what friends have to say about this one, so far nobody in my circle has seen it. It's a pity this disolved the way it did but if it turns out my feelings change on this one, I'll post another review. Right now I'd have to say about The Beach-Almost haunting, beautiflly crafted visually, movie that had promise-but went the way of absurd, disjointed Lord of the flies gone wrong.",4,0,2,1 April 2004
The Doors," An entertaining and inaccurate look at The Lizard King.
","First of all I have to say that I quite liked this movie. It was entertaining(mildly) and great for an evening spent with friends. I'ts ROCK AND ROLL.Now-for anybody wanting to get behind Morrison the myth and know Morrison the man-this is not the movie for you.This movie doesn't get much past the drugs, groupies etc etc. Shock value-yes. Excess-yes. And as I stated it IS entertaining.But it doesn't tell you anything. This movie is not a 10 and it so could have been. I have no problem with Kilmer's acting. He really creeped me out with the physical transofrmation as well as doing his own singing(quite erie actually). All the other roles were well cast too with the possible exception of Pamela(Meg Ryan??) Sorry Oliver that was off, she's to preppy and girly girly to play a sixtie's rock star and poet's girlfriend. That said-good acting doesn't mean a thing if the movie in general(the script) doesn't cut it. Jim Morrison was one of the most influential poet and song writers in the world and I for one would have liked to see that sweet, mystical part of him, that part of him that captured hundreds of thousands of people worldwide expanded on.There is not another movie that does it but anyone wanting to get a sense of Jim would be strongly advised to read 'strange days' a book about Jim written by his wife Patricia Keneely(did I spell it right??).There was a review posted on here that said the patricia character didn't exist. She actually did exist and was the only woman Jim ever wed. That's just one thing among many many others the movie barely touched on.So that's my review-again-entertaining-yes. Holds your interest-yes. good acting(for the most part)-yes.Deep, analytical or getting inside the incredible person that was Jim Morrison-no way baby!",8,4,7,11 August 2003
Closer," An emotionally brutal and cynical look at relationships-or lack thereof.
","Firstly, let me say that I can understand why someone wouldn't like Closer, though I thought it was extraordinary. I myself have never seen a more fascinating audience reaction where people either walked out or shouted how bad the movie was while it was playing. In fact, while, closer is a very heavy movie, It is an intense, performance driven, Emotionally brutal film that, while draining to watch, is fascinating in it's sheer effectiveness in exposing the raw emptiness and utter lack of meaning that can and does, exist, in those 3 magic words: I love you. Closer was originally a play and you can kind of tell that within the first few minutes of the movie. Although, this story is more suited, in some ways, to the stage, I think all involved did an excellent job in bringing it to the big screen.There are only 4 characters in the whole movie and all 4 performers were wonderful in different ways. (They would have to be for a movie like this to maintain it's power.) I know, to many, the strong amount of cursing and vulgar language might have been a negative, but I think it added to the emotional power of the movie. I also found Some of the scenes disconcerting but the movie was very honest in it's telling of the power games, battles for control and obsessive love/hate struggles that actually go on in many, though not all, of romantic relationships. Many of my friends who did not like this, in fact, said the reason why they were uncomfortable, was that it was to true to life. I think the majority of people will be uncomfortable watching Closer and if the movie made one mistake it Was not advertising in an appropriate way, many I knew went, thinking it would be another sunny Julia Roberts comedy which it obviously isn't although I think Roberts turns in her Strongest performance here to date. Closer isn't afraid to take chances and to me, it is very accurate in showing the ugly side of relationships. Everything is explored here from power games, dependency issues, sexual obsession, intimacy, infidelity etc. The words I love you are rendered almost meaningless here. Closer also shows how little people can sometimes know each other no matter how deeply involved they may be. And the audience gets to know the people on screen as these characters come to know each other and what develops isn't predictable. I thought this film was superb. Beyond the incredible performances turned in here, I hope Closer wins best direction. The scene at the strip club between Alice and Larry was the most well directed scene I've seen all year and that one scene alone is enough to go see the movie.In closing-this isn't for everybody or maybe not even the majority but I thought it was very well done, was almost flawless (the lapses in time, while maybe working on stage, Served to confuse many seeing it as a movie.), and contains some of the best and most intense performances of 2004. One of the best of the year.",10,6,10,19 December 2004
Capote," There have been many overrated films in 2005. This is not one of them.
","SPOILERS THROUGH:If ever there was a movie that defines the term 'character study' it would be 'Capote.' The film is a near masterpiece and that's quite strongly due to Phillip Seymour Hoffman. I've been a fan of his for years and have never seen a film he was in where he wasn't extraordinary. And Capote maybe his best performance yet. I did not know a lot about this story before I saw the film. My main draw in seeing it was the incredible reviews and the presence of Hoffman in the title role. I went into the theater mildly curious and came out overwhelmed by the performances, not just from Hoffman But Catherine Keener and Clifton Collins Junior(who should have been nominated for best supporting actor.) Capote isn't overrated, it's a highly underrated film. I really don't know a lot of people who have seen it.Capote does have a kind of slow buildup and takes awhile to get going but when it does it's gripping. It's the kind of film it's difficult to say you 'have fun watching' but it sure is a film you respect the heck out of while your watching it. I definitely see why it's up for an Oscar and though it is not my favorite film of the year, it's certainly one of the most riveting.Phillip Seymour Hoffman becomes Capote so much so, that you forget who he is and the relationship between Capote and Perry is full of complexities, incredibly developed on screen and utterly fascinating. And I must really mention Clifton Collins Junior again who's portrayal of Perry should have landed him a best supporting actor nomination. What this film does so skillfully and so well, is lure the audience in. The beginning is slow and features a large amount of short quick scenes of parties and dinners. I will admit my attention wandered. The tension doesn't build like a typical film because it's tough to know how much one is getting into the film until their already deeply involved. It becomes less a film one is watching and more just a look into one person's inner being. Capote's a strange and uncomfortable film, brutal at times, shocking many times and one that also at times, leaves a bad taste in your mouth because of the unrelenting and gritty structure but it's always brilliantly acted, and an excellent character study.",9,1,1,25 February 2006
Ocean's Thirteen," Really really disappointing.
","SPOILERS:I gave Ocean's 11 a 9 out of 10. To say I loved that film is an understatement. I skipped Ocean's 12 but felt compelled to see this mainly because Al Pachino was in it. Maybe I shouldn't have because as far as I am concerned he was the only good thing about it.All the wit, all the cleverness, all the charm and the great one liners, the excitement, the wonderful, energetic atmosphere....all that is gone. It's like everything that was good about 11 was cut and in it's place the direct opposite was done. Very disappointing. Except of coarse for the exceptional Mr. Pacino who of coarse, is wonderful but I do think he's kind of in the wrong movie. What I didn't like is listed below.I liked Ocean's 11 because it was a 'caper film'..and an incredibly clever one. What was clever about this? Not much. (And not much 'caper' either.) Instead we get a series of jokes and pranks, some of them more annoying then funny, a series of short quick scenes(seriously-did any of the scenes last more then a minute?) I was getting a little dizzy with all the quick takes. And the movie drags too. I kept waiting for something to happen(or at least something with more interest then what was happening.) I think the original premise was good but at least make the 'revenge' story a bit clever or different or INTERESTING. This was ordinary and even a bit below ordinary. In Ocean's 11 we get something incredibly complicated but exciting,with incredible energy. Here we get jokes and tricks and stunts about smells and rashes and a lot of the central plot didn't even make sense. (There is a difference between plot holes in the movie and the movie itself being one long plot hole.)I could go on but why bother? Suffice to say this was not what I expected.And the absence of Roberts is disappointing as well as the fact that Clooney and Pitt do not even appear to be acting half the time rather then basically playing themselves or just being cute. The whole movie was a letdown.The positives? Al Pachino, Al Pachino, Al Pachino! It was great seeing him in the flick and whatever else I say about it, seeing Al in it was maybe worth seeing the movie. In fact even though I basically disliked Ocean's 13 intensely it is not unwatchable and maybe major Pachino fans should check it out. But it is nowhere near the level of 11 and I'd rate this a 4 (am giving it an extra point for the Pachino factor.)My vote is 5 of 10.",5,1,1,15 July 2007
The Devil Wears Prada," a lot of fun, well acted and surprisingly poignant as well
","SPOILERS: I have not read the book but enjoyed the movie a lot. Although this may not be for everybody I thought it was wonderful and Seeing the movie actually made me want to read the book. The Devil Wears Prada is an enjoyable movie with great performances particularly from Streep who steals the movie.There have been other movies made that attempt to showcase the fashion industry but I think this one does it the best. What I liked about this movie was the following: it was witty. It was fun, sassy and satirical. And I'm always up for movies that showcase superficiality and then rip that same superficiality to shreds! It's refreshing to see a movie like this and oodles of fun. It seems almost everything was done well. The pacing was snappy and quick and very good. The music selections were perfect('Crazy' is one of my favorite songs.) The glamor aspect was captured well-really well-and the characters were all believable.And then there's Streep. She was EXCELLENT and I am sure she will receive an Oscar or Golden Globe Nomination. I will admit this movie would not have been what it was without her and having her in it just made the movie.Hathaway was also the perfect choice to Play Andrea. Anne Hathaway is a lovely actress and it was nice seeing her in the lead role. I was quite surprised to see Gisele Bundchen had a small part. I thought the casting of all was perfect.And then there's the poignant aspect to the movie. This movie maybe fun and breezy but it is also painful in parts and thought provoking as well as being very true to life. I never worked in the fashion industry but did work in an industry where many of the people I worked with were almost replicas of some in the movie, only worse. For anyone who thinks the characters in this movie are not realistic, they definitely are. And in real life many are even more ruthless. The focus on looks, Money, and just image in general in our society is extremely sad, getting worse and a real issue and it's portrayed very well here. This is 'Working Girl' for the Fashion industry. The movie also shows power and glamor can get to even the unlikeliest of people by showing the change in Hathaway's character so well. My one complaint with the movie is that the movie's message could have been made a little clearer. It was a little muddled but the overall movie was still great.I loved the end. I was afraid it would turn into a romantic comedy where Andrea is frantically trying to track her boyfriend down and he's boarding a plane about to leave town and she runs and runs....etc etc. man I'm glad that didn't happen. I LOVED the end and really liked that Miranda was humanized. Actually I really liked the movie as a whole. It was exactly what I hoped it would be and how often does that happen? My vote is 10 of 10 for enjoyment and 8.5 for the movie as a whole.",8,2,4,9 July 2006
Romeo + Juliet," To modernized
","It wasn't that I hated this film but it certainly didn't leave a lasting impression on me. I don't understand what the purpose was of modernizing this story, especially the way it was done. While certain parts were mildly enjoyable and it was fascinating to see the early magnificense of Danes and Decaprio the movie made no lasting impression on me and some parts just-well they just didn't work.It would be difficult for me to say exactly what didn't do it for me but I guess it just seems odd updating the story in this way. Great casting, great performances-but the movie left me flat.I am not sure 'updating' this movie was a GREAT idea. It was just a tee bit to modernized and though well intentioned was just off a bit. It didn't work quite like it should have. After the movie's done it's just sort of like your left with the feeling 'what was the point'",5,12,20,14 November 2003
Forrest Gump," a movie for all seasons...
","Forrest Gump will be a forever timeless movie. There is much to love about this film and it fully deserves its place as one of the altime top movies around. I've been reading some imdb reviews and most agree. Of coarse Hanks was magnificent-when I think of Forrest I don't think of him as even being a movie character, he was so lifelike. I guess thats the mark of a great actor when they can create a character that lives forever in our hearts. This movie had an innocence about it-an idealism that I loved-I loved watching the changing face of the country as time went by and I thought Robin Wright Penn was also magnificent-Some people have mentioned the movieis not true to life. Isn't it? Every day there's another story about someone who makes it against all odds. I'm not saying the things that happen to forrest happen to all these people-but -in a time when most 'news stories' are about violence and crime and people who DON'T make it-occasionally one hears the stories of hope-people who aren't given all or ANY the breaks who SOMEHOW-have the strength and perseverence to carve out their own niche. Unfortunately, the reason we don't hear these stories that much is because they aren't given the attention they should get. I had heard once(don't know if this is 100 percent accurate) about a newspaper or magazine that once only reported about good and remarkable occurences-and wound up going out of business! Oh well.... The point is, I think this movie is VERY  important because it has the ability to inspire. And in the times we live in that is always a good thing.",10,1,6,30 November 2003
Bridget Jones's Diary," witty, charming utterly adorable comedy with Renee at her finest.
","This movie is about a single woman's journey to find herself as well as Mr. Right. It's a sweet, poignant movie with warmth, humor and depth and very well done. This movie also made me a Renee Zellwegger fan. I saw it on the big screen and got into it wholeheartedly from the beginning. This movie combines a witty script, featuring classic comedy with great acting. Renee is perfect for the lead role, as she was utterly charming and whimsical in this. Actually Hugh Grant was pretty good as well, It's difficult for me to think any female wouldn't love this(of coarse everyone has the right to their own opinion). I found Bridget to be a very realistic character as well as the characters of many around her. The attitudes that were shown toward Bridget as a single girl are indeed very realistic even in today's times. I'd say this was one of the best movies of 2001 and a movie I'd wholeheartedly suggest seeing, to anyone who may not have seen it as of yet.It's warm, witty and fun. I don't think a part two was at all necessary though.",9,2,3,17 March 2004
Fargo," a good movie but overrated. Loses power as it goes along.
","SPOILERS: I am not one who hated Fargo. I can see, watching this, just why it is considered as such a great film. But I also think it's overrated. I was disappointed when it was over and don't think it is nearly as good as many have said. Here's why.First the positives. In the beginning and part of the middle nearly everything is positive. And I do mean everything. The performances were great. The landscapes were breathtaking. The musical score was phenomenal, among the best. The movie was compellingly atmospheric. The story was interesting and the dialog was superb. The movie is clearly superior to many other films. It sucks you in from the beginning and there is so much power to the movie, from the opening, that one is on the edge of their seat waiting as the movie gathers momentum.And that is why I did not love this. It gathers momentum all right. But it goes nowhere. The whole time I was watching this I was waiting for an incredible ending, for something along the lines of The Usual Suspects. But it never happened. It's not that the film is bad, it's just that it is so powerful from the beginning, but it never develops into anything at the end. The movie ended so suddenly I was still waiting for another half hour at least. At the end, I said to myself: is that all? The movie promises something big but it doesn't deliver. I thought maybe something would happen with the buried money, with maybe some kind of 'twist', SOMETHING. There were all these 'little things' seen throughout the movie which I filed away to myself, thinking they would somehow be very important to the storyline later but their not. Instead the movie became a mish mash of fights, gory murders, and.....that's it. Toward the end, there was to much an emphasis on violence and not enough on anything else. (Though the movie's violent throughout, in the beginning and middle there was also an emphasis on the story.) The speech that Mc.Drmand made at the end was powerful but the end as a whole was nowhere near the rest of the movie.I'd compare it to watching a really good movie and then finding out at the end it was all a dream. I personally do not like those type of films either. But this was similar because we, the viewer are lead to think a lot more is going to happen that what finally does. Even the scene with Jerry getting arrested, although I'm glad he gets caught, could have been even more powerful. The film just ends, leaving the viewer to think:that's IT? I Personally thought Fargo was a 10 of 10 at TIMES. But I felt it really needed something more to give a feeling of completeness which it did not have. I know many, if not most, think it's a 10 of 10 but I'm just not in the majority here though I agree the movie had certain great aspects for me it definitely was not outstanding.In closing I'd say, the dialog, the acting, the musical score etc were terrific but the movie's shortcomings really became apparent toward the end. The movie left a bad taste in my mouth and though I can absolutely see why many love this so much I was disappointed. My vote's 7 of 10.",7,0,0,8 January 2006
Notting Hill," Lovely airy romantic story where the scenery is as good a reason to watch as the plot.
","Notting Hill is such an obvious warm, lovely airy romantic movie you almost don't want to say anything bad about it because of just how sweet it is. And actually, I don't have anything bad to say because I quite enjoyed Notting Hill. It was sweet, mildly funny, touching. However, the one of the best things about it was the scenery. This movie is so beautiful visually it's almost worth it, even if one doesn't get into the plot, to see it for the Gorgeus rolling hills and scenery in general. It was lovely. Lovely is definitely the word that comes to mind when viewing Notting Hill. It was pretty much almost exactly what I thought it would be going into it.As enjoyable a movie as this is, I wouldn't say it bowled me over. I liked, not loved it and have enjoyed other romantic comedies more although as mentioned, as far as cinematography goes it gets 10 of 10.The SECOND observation I wanted to make and something that I've noticed is lacking in other romantic comedies is -ENDING SPOILER 2)The end was UNUSALLY touching. Rather then, when the guy and girl eventually get together and the audience gets to see that 1 scene where MAYBE they kiss-this ending went on a minute or two and showed the couple's wedding, kids, walking the red carpet. I liked that. It was a nice change. To many other romantic comedies including Truly great ones don't do that-they end to abruptly-I liked, tremendously the scene where they get together at the end,at the press conference, it was very touching and the fact that they stretched the end a bit was particularly nice.Notting Hill, in my opinion has more pure romance in it then comedy but it's an excellent choice and a must see for any fan of romances in general.",7,0,0,31 March 2004
American Pie," Hardly a classic.
","I avoided this one as long as I could, finally a friend insisted that I watch it. My review?OK-it's not bad. I gave it a 6(and that was being kind). So yes there are some funny parts to this movie. You may laugh. And YES I thought the legendary 'pie scene' was funny, very funny actually, and laughed along with millions of other people.However, that said American Pie is run of the mill, typical and not really a terrific movie. Hundreds of comedies are funnier and after seeing this, I can't say I particularly remember much about it or would have cared at all had I not seen it.It does have some funny moments and it isn't as bad as I thought it would be at all. The humor is there at times. But there are a lot of other teen comedies that are more genunely unforgettable. The single best comedy for young people is 'fast times at richmond high.' This can't come close.Like I said, It's not unwatchable, merely typical. Many Many better comedies out there.",6,0,1,24 August 2003
The Italian Job," larger then life exciting heist film!
","The best words to describe The Italion Job are: THRILLING,LARGER THEN LIFE, FUN, ELECTRIC, UNREALISTIC AND EXCITING.WARNING: SPOILERS THROUGHOUT!Who cares if this movie is unrealistic? Man, what a wild ride!  This movie reminded me alot of Ocean's 11 and it creates the same effect which is to basically keep you on the edge of your seat throughout the length of the picture. This is a movie where,like Ocean's 11, you can't leave your seat for even 1 minute or you'll miss something important(trust me I did.) It is also a movie with some of the best direction and coolest soundtracks I've heard and seen in awhile. It is a movie to just lose yourself in for 2 hours-no thought on the reality of the story, no thought at all-just sit back and enjoy the ride!I like heist movies and this one was incredibly well done so I liked it ALOT-I could see someone to whom this genre of movies does not appeal NOT liking it but I still thought it was great(8.5) though I still like Ocean's 11 a wee bit better.The direction and cinemotography were excellent-the views of Venice and the Alps were breathtaking-and the whole feel of the pic was larger then life-I would easily recommend this movie as a rental to someone who has not seen it-Norton,Theron, all the  stars are at the top of their craft and the ending is suitably satisfying.",8,0,2,23 November 2003
The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring," Technically brilliant movie
","I must admit of all the movies out there Lord of the rings was on my list of 'don't go sees'. The reason was simple. I had no interest in the lord of the rings(books) nor did I care to see a movie based on any of them. But a good friend of mine insisted that I go-and so amidst many a mumble and grumble on my part I acompanied this friend to the movie theatre silently gloating over how I would prove my friend wrong when I hated the movie as much as I envisioned.MY FRIEND HAD THE LAST LAUGH.I was wrong-way wrong on this one and will say right here that if someone with as little interest in the Lord of the Rings Saga as me could fall in love with a pic like this anyone can-and I do mean ANYONE-so SEE IT if you haven't!I'm not gonna get into reviewing plots or anything like that. Here is what I will say: Aside from the fact The movie is engaging, wonderfully written and acted etc etc, the people responsible for the technical visual aspects of Lord of the rings are geniuses. The visuals in this movie are technically amazing, breathtaking, and are so intricate you wonder how HUMAN BEINGS could actually put something like this together. At the very least even if you don't like the film(which is doubtful) your mouth will be hanging open at the sheer ARTISTRY of the film. I think Lord of the Rings is the type of movie that could inspire someone to start a career in movie making.
Lastly, I will say one of my pet peeves is movies that run a long time and don't seem to end. Lord of the rings had a long running time which was one other worry of mine when viewing this movie. WELL-the time passes so quickly it barely feels like half the time has gone by. And during that time there are very few moments one will actually be bored.So all in all, I have to recomend Rings. Probebly most people reading this have seen it already but in case there's that one person who, like me is a skeptic, check the movie out. Because you DO NOT have to be a Lord of the Rings(book) longtime fan to REALLY enjoy this movie.",8,2,3,5 September 2003
Grease," Still great after all these years...
","Perhaps I'm not going to be completely objective but I love this movie! It's one of those movies I saw when I was young that I still watch whenever I can. For some reason this movie never gets overplayed. It's almost as great now, as when I first saw it.How does this movie stay so timeless? Grease is a classic that is still so refreshingly GREAT after all these years. I don't know how the movie does it but it somehow manages to remain timeless. The movie is so effortlessly bouncy and so filled with great music that you can't help but never get tired of it.The music is a favorite of mine as well or at least some of it. I've never seen Grease two nor do I have any desire to. But this movie remains one of top ones. I can't say much negative about Grease as I grew up with it, cheerfully admit to owning (and loving) the soundtrack, and watch it whenever it's on television so I can treat myself to yet another viewing. I will say that if I were to voice one negative it would be the transformation of Sandy at the end, which though it was rather fun to watch, does send rather the wrong message at the end. However this movie is so campy that I never really took the story all that seriously anyway since it's almost satirical at times. And honestly the story is not what makes this great, it's the music, dancing and characters themselves.Grease is, to me, a wonderful production. I never ever get tired of the incredible array of songs. It's appealing on so many different levels. It's upbeat, bouncy, a great friendship movie, a great movie to grow up with, and a great overall musical. It probably wont appeal to people who don't like any of the songs and it's also best, when watching it, not to take it to seriously. See it for the great music, wonderful dancing and unforgettable characters. It also never gets old. Ever. And I will say every time it's viewed it's as good or almost so, as the first time-and how many movies can one say that about?Grease will never win the award for deepest picture but that's OK. It is one of the FUN pictures ever made and is one of the ultimate 'guilty pleasure type movies' . I have to say 10 out of 10.",10,1,2,4 December 2003
Footloose," Corny but classic
","Footloose was such a popular movie when I was growing up. I just had the opportunity to see it again the other day. I'm a bit mixed on this movie because I did indeed find the corniness undeniable but the overriding message was so sweet and this such an ultimate feel good movie I really would have a hard time completely ragging on this movie.My problem with this movie isn't that I find it corny now, it's that I didn't like it then either-and I am a big fan, both of musicals and teen movies. I also like feel good movies and appreciate the message of the movie. Still-Footloose never captivated me as did so many other teen movies of this time period. After viewing it again, I find my feelings have not gotten fonder or lessened-it's pretty much stayed the same.I think the reason why it never captivated me is the music pure and simple. With musicals, one has to like the music being played because the music is as important as the overall message. Phantom of the Opera is a great example, you can't dig the story if the music doesn't grab you. The music in Footloose never got me so I didn't enjoy the musical numbers. Many musicals can be corny while still having remarkable elements to them. I do, however know that so many DID find this remarkable. I have friends who are Footloose purists. In my case, It's not that I liked it and then changed my mind, it's that I never liked it at all. The movie really bored me at times and I found a lot of it cheesy yet I could still appreciate the underlying theme of it all.I think a 6 is an appropriate rating for Footloose, I'd never rank it below average because I do not think it could be considered dreadful. But I do think it's quite over rated and the comparisons to Grease I find a bit baffling because I don't think it can begin to touch a movie like Grease. Still, I could see where Footloose would be an appealing choice to some and it is considered by many to be a teen classic. This definitely isn't the worst of the genre but it isn't the best either and my rating is 6 of 10.",6,2,6,18 March 2005
Cast Away," Hanks always seems to shine
","SPOILERS THROUGHOUT: My review will be short and sweet. This is a beautiful movie and though I didn't see it in the theater, I pretty much knew the story by the time I did see it, so there weren't many surprises. That Tom Hanks was incredible was definitely not a surprise as he is one of my favorite actors and with the exception of 'You've got mail' I have never really seen a hanks movie I did not like. Here Hanks is in another haunting film playing another unforgettable character.This is the best I've ever seen Helen Hunt. This movie contains so many bittersweet moments and scenes (one word-Wilson) and the ending is so absolutely bittersweet and realistic to a degree, it s both touching and brilliantly acted.As good as Castway is, don't see it if your in a bad mood(or if you don't like Tom Hanks.) There is no doubt that Tom Hanks is one of the most talented actors we have working today and I think all involved did a great job with this movie.",9,1,2,26 June 2005
Cold Mountain," breathtaking visuals,moving story but the film itself was tough to watch.
","SPOILERS: Cold Mountain was a film I tried to see when it first played on the big screen but didn't manage to get to the theater. It's been playing on television lately so I sat down to watch. I didn't like it all that much even though it was very moving.The visuals, featured in this film, almost defy description. They were absolutely breathtaking, to the point where one could turn the sound down and just watch the film to let the photography envelop you. The landscapes were an absolute dream and the film was definitely moving.So WHY didn't I like this? Well first off, is the length. This is a very long movie and moves very very slowly so one really has to be in the right frame of mind when they sit down to watch it. Also, as anyone who knows the plot would know, it is a very sad picture and that element, coupled with the very long length, and slow pacing makes it rather difficult to enjoy.It is also very violent in many areas which again, most, who know the plot would know when sitting down to watch it, since it is about war.But there were other elements I had problems with. Nicole Kidman and Jude Law did not have any on screen chemistry, and, though Nicole Kidman is one of my favorite actresses working today, I felt she was miscast. She was supposed to be exhausted and despairing on a farm, yet her eye makeup never looked better. It was a bit tough to buy as at times she looked liked she was headed off to a modeling assignment.Some of the dialog seemed forced to me as well and the reunion between Law and Kidman lacked something as well. I'm an admirer of Cold Mountain because of it's beauty, poignancy and some of it's casting such as Zellweger as Ruby. But the movie won't go down as one of my favorites. My vote is 6 of 10.",6,3,7,19 March 2006
The Shining," red rum
","The Shining is such a classic how can one even comment on it? Obviously this film is a legend, a classic etc. And some of the most legendary lines around were coined in this movie. Great acting, great special affects, creepy! Eerie(very eerie!). A classic! But one thing I have to add: as good and scary as the movie was, as erie as it was, I found some of the scenes to be either intentionally or unintentionally rather funny too. 'All work and no play'(being typed over and over again),here's johnny',even the famous 'RED RUM!!' to an extent. I'm not sure whether it was supposed to be that way but many of us felt that way and would go into gales of laughter when certain particular scenes came on.That's NOT to diminish the movie's eriness or fear factor AT ALL!. I'm just thinking that there were some unexpected moments of wit in this classic as well and that made it all the more fun to watch. RED RUM!",9,2,4,29 August 2003
American Beauty," The hype was well deserved-excellent movie.
","Here's a film that was as outstanding as the buzz made it out to be. I'm not surprised this won an academy award. American Beauty was an excellent movie, both tragic and powerful, extremely engrossing and well acted.The movie touches on subject matters that maybe controversial but are very real. Who really knows what happens behind anybody's' closed doors and who really knows who another human being truly is 100 percent of the time? This movie is very 'unhollywood' and still managed to fascinate many. I know very few who have viewed this and not liked it and at least its a movie one has to respect even if they do not personally love it, it doesn't play by the rules in the slightest, no 'by the numbers' plot here, and it doesn't cop out on any level.I must mention the performances by everyone-the whole cast was great and helped make the film what it was. American Beauty is one of those films that's just a good, quality piece of work. It's Oscar win is justified.I love movies where the characters actually have some basis in reality. The characters are all very much that in American Beauty. These people are not 'carricitores', they could be our friends, our neighbors or even ourselves. The movie works on every level. To sum up- Very well done movie, and a 10 of 10.",10,1,2,27 November 2003
Dreamgirls," Electrifying.
","SPOILERS: I really was very happy to see a movie that actually lived up to the hype. Most movies do not. That, combined with the fact this is a musical and most musicals brought to a film version are not extraordinary, kind of made me skeptical. But I must say Dreamgirls is the must see picture of the year. This has been kind of a disappointing year with movies, I thought. There has been only a few I'd say were great or must sees. This is definitely one of them.I know it's been said....over and over and over and over.....but I'll add to it. Jennifer Hudson is extraordinary. In fact she's so extraordinary, it's almost a bit scary. I mean listening to her it's incredible to think that a HUMAN BEING can actually have a voice like this. There's a lot of words to describe Hudson's voice from dazzling to terrific to hypnotic to extraordinary. None of these words however, do her justice. Her voice could almost put one into a trance to the point that you don't want the songs to end, particularly the unbelievable 'And I am telling you I'm not going'. Without a doubt she not only steals the movie but makes a place for herself among the top of the heap of singers. Not to mention the fact that she's a darn good actress!!!!! It would be unfair not to mention the performances of all the others as as well. There were not any weak links that I could see. There has been tremendous buzz around Eddie Murphy and I understand that. But I also thought Jaime Fox was excellent and I don't understand why he's not being more widely talked about. And Beyonce's singing was quite good and though it seemed a bit understated, that did go with the character who's voice was not supposed to have strong personality as mentioned in the movie. I was also amazed how she managed to transform her appearance and look so different. But she was very good as was Anika Noni Rose. And I LOVED Danny Glover in this(He may have been my second favorite After Hudson). I thought everybody in this movie did a great job.What's interesting about Dreamgirls is that when I was first watching it, for maybe the first half hour or so I didn't think I'd like it all that much. The movie is a little different then say 'Chicago' which launched immediately into one of it's best numbers. With Dreamgirls, it seemed to take awhile to get to the best music which I didn't expect(I am not one who saw the stage version.) So when the music suddenly went from moderately good to incredibly powerful, I was a bit unprepared. And not only does the music pick up but the movie's overall power strengthens as well.Forgetting about the musical aspect for a moment, the story itself is also incredibly powerful and provides a realistic look into the dark aspects of the entertainment industry. The characters are developed wonderfully, particularly Effie. And the energy of the movie never slows down.I happen to love musicals so seeing it was wonderful. It's been talked about for an Oscar and though I was skeptical before I saw it, I really could see this movie taking home the golden prize. The movie/ musical that did that a few years ago, 'Chicago' is one of my all time favorite movies in the world. Dreamgirls, while probably(very surprisingly) my favorite of the year so far, hasn't made it to my all time top 10 yet but that doesn't mean it someday couldn't. I think the makers of this movie did an admirable and wonderful job of bringing it to movie theaters and thought the movie was powerful, dazzling, poignant, and a class act all around. I look forward to seeing it again and would give it a 10 of 10. See it because it does live up to the hype.",10,2,4,6 January 2007
The 40-Year-Old Virgin," a comedy with a heart
","SPOILERS THROUGH:To bad there's no Oscar for best comedy of the year. I have heard critical raves about 40 year old Virgin and the movie didn't disappoint. Not only is it hilarious, but there's a sweetness to the characters and the story which is unusual for a comedy of this type. Yet it somehow also avoids the 'cheesy factor.'I personally think Steve Carroll is one of the funniest actors I've ever seen and he's got genuine acting talent as well so he makes this movie work. The supporting cast are great, particularly Catherine Keener who takes on a tough role as the love interest but doesn't fall into the trap of being just the object of desire of the lead actor. Keener plays an individual rather then a cliché and she is a breath of fresh air. All the performers in this movie are excellent in playing characters that have individual personalities rather then being just props for the storyline. Everyone is memorable.The humor in this movie is obnoxious, crude and rather disgusting at times and is not at all the type of humor that I myself usually like but for some reason it works here. In fact everything works here. The thing that sets 40 year old virgin apart is that it's both constantly comedic and touching without being schmaltzy. It's a comedy with a heart and the movie keeps you laughing but also has a depth that is unusual for a comedy of this nature. At any rate, the movie worked for me and I really enjoyed it.The end I must mention as well as it was really well done and unique. The 40 year old Virgin is a great movie to see when you just want to laugh and have a good time watching a constantly funny, original movie that also reaches out and touches in a way one might not expect. Comedies if they are really well done deserve nine's and ten's sometimes and my rating of this movie is 9 out of 10.",9,1,2,12 February 2006
54," Cmon down to 54
","I liked this movie, it's not a 10 but certainly not a bad picture. I do agree that the focus should have been more on the happenings of the club itself but this happens a lot in true life stories turned into movies. Actually the movie could have been a lot worse.I think they did a reasonably good job, though not an exceptional one, of capturing the Glitz, glamor and mystery of the greatest nightclub in the world. You feel the appropriate sense of loss at the end of the movie and wish you had been there. I know I did. The NYC club scene is still alive and kicking but no other club will probably ever be as notorious as 54. I was really shocked this movie didn't do better at the box office but though I liked it, I agree it had flaws. The movie while capturing the atmosphere and time period strongly, and making one curious about Studio 54 and maybe wishing they'd gone at least once, didn't succeed in making the club's allure irresistible and the movie compellingly unforgettable and an instant classic as it should have, because all the tools were there for an unforgettable film.The movie should also have been MUCH LONGER. It still turned out much better then it could have though and is most definitely entertaining. I thought it was MUCH better then The last days of disco which I thought was horrible. I'd give it a 7 or 7.5 of 10 for the movie making, 8 of 10 for personal enjoyment though I'd really like to have seen this be a 10 all around, in the way of a 'Boogie Nights.' Still worth seeing though.",7,1,2,13 August 2003
Ocean's Eleven," a roller coaster of fun.
","Man does this movie ever pull you into it's atmosphere and get you involved in the plot! This was a really fun movie! I really enjoyed ocean's eleven very much, even more then I thought I would. The movie features an absolutely amazing star studded cast and the movie is like a roller coaster, the plot steadily builds until by the end your freaking out waiting to see what happens.Definitely a great entertaining ride. I think the actors/actresses had a great time making this. In addition to being a really fun movie to watch one can almost feel how much fun the cast had being in it. It's really great to see a movie where the mood is so infectious and this is a movie one just gets swept into.If you haven't seen it be warned: the first 20 minutes or so is a bit draggy but that's just to build momentum, the movie more then compensates for that during the rest of the film. The movie Pulls the viewer into keeping eyes glued on it and stays Consistently engaging and on the edge of your seat exciting. I think everyone was great in this and this is one of those rare movies that has a rare energy where you really don't wanna BLINK less you miss something. This is also a movie one probably needs to see more then once.Ocean's eleven easily rates an 8.5, possibly higher.",9,0,0,30 August 2003
The Usual Suspects," Who is Keyser Soze?
","SPOILERS THROUGHOUT:Uusual Suspects is REALLY good-if you haven't seen it-stop reading this now because there are SPOILERS THROUOUT!I will confess, at first glance it doesn't seem like it's gonna be a classic-I was rather bored at first-not unmanageably so but it seemed like your typical crime movie. Obviously it's not or it wouldn't be so loved-I think there's a few things here that distinguish it besides the ending-which DOES make it into the movie hall of fame for 'biggest punch in the gut ending ever!!'Firstly, there's the cleverness of the whole concept-the movie teases, hoodwinks and toys with it's audience-Some people don't like the movie for that reason, they feel manipulated-while I can understand that, I don't agree with it. The whole concept of the movie was so simple it's brilliant-as the movie goes on is there a movie viewer out there who doesn't get sucked into what Verbal is saying? He cons on screen AND off screen-the audience buys into just one man's WORDS-nothing more-until out of this simple story we begin, in our heads to make up incredibly complicated scenarios to solve the puzzle.Who is Keyser Soze?The answer, is of coarse right in front of us. Now here is something else. I guessed the answer relatively quickly and WAS SHOCKED ANYWAY when what I had thought came to pass-I got so sucked into Verbal's verbal torrent of words that I forgot my original premise-or maybe it wasn't forgotten but just put to one side-even if this idea floats through briefly your brain there is no clue AT ALL the end will play out as it does.Then of coarse, there is Keyser Soze himself, who takes on a sort of mythical legendary status in the movie to the point where the movie has made it's viewing audience crazy to know the identity of someone who's name WASN'T EVEN INTRODUCED as a character until well into the movie! The name Soze begins to take over the whole film and completely alters what everyone thought it was gonna be about.The ending-Without a doubt this is one of the best twist endings of all time-not just who Soze really is, but the METHOD of how it comes out-deserves to be up there as a great movie for that alone.Also-even though it's not perfect(I was actually as mentioned very bored at times in the beginning)you just sort of know your watching something that's gonna become a classic. There's just something about it.It can also be watched more then once(and should be!) and rather then dissipate, the movie's intrigue does not lessen at all with multiple viewings. The mystique is still there, strong as ever and the end still sends chills down the spine. A great film!I wouldn't rank this as my favorite movie of all time but I can see why it would be someone else's. It is clever, it has style, it is refreshingly different and it has some of the best acting I've ever seen. A must see if you haven't seen it.",10,0,1,4 January 2004
Die Hard 2," No No sorry no.
","As an action movie this was boring and the movie in general just didn't excite. To hollywood, to contrived and to draggy. I forced myself to sit through it but even now cannot understand the appeal of the die hard movies. Everyone has their own opinion but I wouldn't rate this past a 4.",Null,1,4,1 February 2004
Flashdance," The idea is better then the movie itself.
","Flashdance is about as dated as you can get. The problem with this movie as i've found is that the story itself is rather flat in certain areas. Also, you have to really like the music featured in this movie, because if you don't, being that there's SO MUCH of that type of music it maybe irritating.I did like this when I was a kid moderately,  but not for the story at all-for the music. But now, that music just seems dated as anything and I really am not into Flashdance at all anymore.There is nothing wrong with the movie. But it can't touch something like Saturday night fever(it's been compared to that). I wouldn't call Flashdance a classic, not really and the movie lacks the electricity of a 'saturday night fever'. It is an empowering movie though and shows if you have a dream-never give up. But I did give up on repeated viewings of this, didn't age well with me and I'd give it a 5 out of 10.",Null,1,4,10 May 2004
Dirty Dancing," 'I don't believe you Baby'!
","This timeless summer love story is a classic and will never be dated. I can't even count how many times I've seen Dirty Dancing. This is one movie that I could probably watch every few weeks and still love.There is something timeless about this movie. I have loved other 'blockbuster love story movies' like Pretty Woman and when Harry met Sally. I think their up there but there is something about Dirty Dancing that just makes it absolutely perfect. The characters, the chemistry between Swaze and Grey, the movie's direction, the INCREDIBLE dancing, the warm summery atmosphere, everything about dirty dancing is absolutely perfect. It is an instant classic and I've never really seen a movie like it either before or since.I don't think there is one particular element that makes this movie so loved but many things, a lot of which are mentioned by numerous reviewers. Dirty Dancing has a nostalgic, languid, summery mood, realistic characters, a relateable honest message coupled with incredible music and dancing, and the one of the best dance sequences cinema has ever given us. This movie is always on TV and I will continue to watch it as long as they show it. But I WILL mention I have no interest in seeing 'Havanna Nights', this one they should have left alone.",10,127,177,1 September 2003
Legends of the Fall," why SHOULDN'T this film have received an Oscar nomination?
","There's something about Legends of the Fall that is haunting. This beautifully done period piece about 3 brothers and the father(and woman) who loves them hasn't received enough credit. Sure it was long, soap operaish and had many 'beautiful people' in it. So what? I thought this was an excellent movie, very moving, actually exceptionally so. It's a superb movie with unforgettable characters, haunting music and some of the most gorgeous scenery I've ever seen. Don't expect just another period piece. Brad Pitt was delightful although it wasn't his best role(close enough) and I also really liked Aiden Quinn who put in an Oscar worthy performance. In fact, I liked everybody. I would like to know why Julia Ormond did not become an instant star from this or at least get an Oscar nomination, she was absolutely brilliant. My feeling is, had this movie been made with a different, more 'serious' cast it would have received a lot more critical recognition. (Picture Legends Of The Fall:starring Tom Hanks and Meryl Streep.)So many people lump Brad Pitt as a pretty boy ignoring the fact that he's a really good actor. In fact, the performances by EVERYONE here are top notch. This movie is absolutely stirring and I've watched it so many times I've lost count. Everything, from the characters , to the richly appropriate music, to the almost unbelievably magnificent, scenery, and emotional power to the movie in general, come together to create a movie that is very much unique in it's way. This beautiful tale had it all and though there is a lot of death and you will cry throughout the picture it shouldn't be missed if you haven't already seen it. 10 of 10.",10,20,35,13 August 2003
Batman Begins," Get lost in it.
","SPOILERS THROUGHOUT: This is the best 2005 release I've seen and certainly akin to the classic superhero movies. I went to see this because of what a quality Piece of cinema I had heard it was and the movie did not disappoint. It was absolutely outstanding.This is certainly the best Batman picture I've seen. This is not so much as a comic book story turned into a movie as it is a powerful, dark and haunting character study of the angst and pain one mortal suffered and how these feelings and events guided him toward his ultimate fate as Batman. The film itself is not only good but Oscar worthy and (though I know movies such as this are not usually nominated), I hope at least some of the performances will be remembered particularly Bale who is completely outstanding.One of the interesting things about film is the fact that it is as much for adults as teenagers. In fact maybe more so. I remember the types of movies I liked as a teen well, and I am not absolutely sure I'd have liked this. Batman begins is such a serious and mournful movie that I could see many a kid having a tough time with it, in fact I could see many a PERSON-of any age-having some difficulty, this isn't sweetness and light at all, and it's material is sometimes very disturbing and dark. It is more dialog driven then action oriented and the power of the movie, from the beginning was so forceful I forgot to eat the movie popcorn. It is absolutely riveting.Baylor's performance is flawless, he IS Batman. Baylor inhabits the role so absolutely and his performance is so captivating that you forget he's an actor. A perfect casting choice.All performers were great including the wonderful supporting cast, especially Oldman, of whom I'm a major fan. The only one who was not believable to me, was Katie Holmes and that is not because she isn't talented, it is just that she looked to young to be an assistant DA and she also didn't look very surprised when she found out Batman and Bruce Wayne were the same Person. and the two had no chemistry whatsoever. Their relationship didn't quite ring true.The photography is fantastic as well. I loved this film's interpretation of Gotham and the action scenes were luminescent and really beautiful. Also worth mentioning is the scene when Bruce Wayne is ready to face his fear of the bats and goes into the bat cave and the bats submerge him. The overall look of the movie was dark, gritty, and (here's that word again-haunting.) I enjoyed the look of the movie as much as the movie itself.Batman Begins reminded me of several other pictures including Raidors of the lost Arc and the Kill Bill movies. But it is very much it's own picture. This is not a movie I would be shocked to find somebody didn't like, it is very dark indeed, and way more disturbing and bleak then some of the other batman movies but I myself thought it was, in it's way, a masterpiece and certainly is Worthy of admiration as well as containing some Oscar Worthy performances. My vote is 9.5 of 10.",9,2,3,3 July 2005
Liar Liar," Solid funny entertainment
","Liar Liar is one of those movies that's great when you just want a pure comedy. And what a comedy it is too! Carey turns in a manic and very good Performance as the dishonest attorney, forced to his horror, into telling the truth for an entire day because his son made a birthday wish that happened to come true. Liar Liar takes a concept that's funny to begin with and makes it, at times, actually hilarious , mainly by not taking itself to seriously and just going wildly creative and outrageous with the concept. This is a movie that I would solidly recommend to someone who just wants a light, if rather manic, comedy. I am picky about my comedies and consider this to be actually hilarious in some places, a good example being in the court room when Cary in the middle of questioning a shady client (who is lying), objects to his own questions. LiarLiar is not without flaws, there are some times it gets a bit to slapstick, a bit to obnoxious and the ending, while very sweet was a little over the top with the airport scene. I still liked this a lot though as a whole. It's purpose is to entertain which it does. I really do love this concept. Imagine someone who lies regularly having to tell the straight truth no matter what. I could think of a few people who might have trouble with that(and who it might be really entertaining to see while they do it!). In closing, I really liked this very much and the movie makers and cast, especially Carey, did a great job of having fun with the concept and pushing this as far as they could. My vote's 7 of 10.",7,3,4,18 February 2005
Blue Crush," Some of the best underwater visuals I've ever seen but the movie apart from the incredible visuals didn't thrill me.
","Blue Crush is a movie that's gotta be seen to be believed and that's for one reason-the water shots. This movie is stunning in it's photography and contains some of the best underwater and wave/surfing visuals I have ever seen. In a way, I wish I had seen this on the big screen because man what a powerful bonanza that would have been. The visuals are almost unfathomable.I must be honest and say I didn't really get into the movie much when the characters weren't surfing. There was a lot of music interspersed with dialog which didn't, to me, go with this type of movie and I was so wowed by the ocean scenes that when the characters weren't surfing I was bored. There were a few times I felt like I was watching Animal House meets a movie about surfing. The movie contained some of that type of humor which, to me, again, didn't go with what the movie was supposed to be about. If the movie didn't have all that other stuff I'd have liked it a lot better. It almost seemed like two different movies. I was a bit perplexed by that.This movie needs to be seen by anyone who surfs or who loves the sea in general. I was swept away by the fierceness and power to the water scenes but wish I'd enjoyed the movie more as a whole. I'd give the visuals a 20 out of 10 though even though not the movie as a whole. This is still worth seeing just for the visuals, man those surfing scenes were incredible.",5,3,6,12 January 2005
Meet the Fockers," I did NOT expect to like this but I did-and I didn't even like the first one!
","SPOILERS THROUGH:The last thing I expected was to like the sequel to 'Meet The Parents', a movie I didn't even like that much and that I thought was over rated. Yet I did like the sequel, 'Meet The Fockers' very much. And that's unusual for me. I don't even usually watch sequels, let alone from movies I didn't like that much in the first place. But this movie is very funny, in a belly laughing kind of way, not a great movie, but a fun entertaining One.The main reason I liked this was the same reason I didn't like the first one. With the first one, there were Plenty of laughs but it was always at Greg's expense and there was a meanness present that was a major turn off. It was almost a black comedy but one I thought was highly over rated. With Fockers, although some meanness is present, the pureness of comedy is much stronger then the first one. People play off each other not against each other, and you laugh with them rather then at them. There is some very good comedy in this and another reason is because the characters are very funny in and of themselves but in a way that is accessible to the audience and easy to relate to.The Fokker's themselves are real, fully developed people and Hoffman and Streisand are utterly hilarious. They work incredibly together and project a sense of fun as well as going for the comedic. It was tremendously enjoyable watching them and seeing the zany antics they and the rest of the cast, got up to. The movie moved smoothly as well, the pace was excellent and the laughs, while not constant, were very funny when they did happen.De Niro I thought was excellent in the first one and here he is still great. This is one where nobody really outshines the other though, and even the supporting cast(the baby, the police officer etc) were hilarious. The Fokker's are one of those families one just wants to see more of. Their fun, their funny, and even Ben Stiller, who I'm not a major fan of, came across as tremendously likable and much more fun then in the first one. I'm drawing comparisons because it seems like many people preferred 'Meet The Parents' over 'Meet The Fockers' and with me it's the other way around. I'd give this movie an easy 7.The scene where Greg, gets up and starts telling the truth was hysterical and reminded me a bit of 'Liar Liar'. I would definitely recommend this movie. It was pleasant surprise to like a movie I went into thinking would be absolutely terrible.",7,0,0,3 December 2006
The Princess Bride," 'As you wish'
","A good friend of mine loves this movie and convinced me to watch it. It was a very sweet, fun fairy tale kind of movie and I very much liked how the movie was made(the story being read to a curious child by his grandfather).This is very much a feel good fairy tale type of movie in the form of Ever After and The three musketeers. It's also a very sweet story with the standard 'love conquers all' type of message but you believe it in the story of Buttercup and Westley.I thought Mandy Patinkin was particularly good as the fierce yet inherently decent Inigo Montoya. And of coarse there's Cary Elwes for many a girl to swoon over-did anyone else notice how much of a resemblance he has to Brad Pitt?My only negative, is a scene or two were surprisingly violent for this type of movie and people not expecting that maybe in for a surprise. But that is my only strong negative.All in all a very sweet feel good movie that's well above average and is definitely worth checking out. My vote is 8 of 10.",8,2,3,30 August 2003
Seabiscuit," Defines the term:'Heartwarming'.
","SeaBiscuit lives up to all the hype and is so truly heartwarming I'd recommend it as a movie to see when you want a movie to watch where you will be rest assured of being in a good mood when you get done watching. It's the feel good movie of the year and with good reason-the story is a beautiful and Enriching one and true as well. Were it NOT a true story I still think it would be a good movie but not to the extent it is.I imagine many of the people reading this have already seen it. I have read some of the reviews and most have been good but there were a few negative-some people said this was to 'Hollywood'. I don't agree for the simple reason that this story is based in reality. It happened. No. maybe the real life events were not EXACTLY as they were on screen, maybe certain things were given a bit more-(sugarcoating) and that is precisely why I said if this were not a true story I could imagine it being called :intentionally sappy etc etc.But the bottom line is the plot IS based in reality and :WARNING SPOILERS COMING UP NOW!The fact is that this ended on a good note because thats how the real story ended-unless there is something I don't know. Hollywood makes many movies about real life events that DON'T have happy endings-because they didn't in real life. This one had a happy ending because that's how the story of Sea Biscuit played out in reality. It pulls at your heartstrings but so what-the story IS incredible and is a great great story to make into a movie. And it is so easy to love Sea Biscuit, that tough little horse that changed so many lives and gave inspiration and hope. In addition the cinematography was lush and lovely and I was amazed by how real the horse racing sequences were, and how incredibly they were filmed. I never had an interest before in Horse Racing but the film pulls you in with it and gets you excited-the ending is one of the most richly satisfying I've ever seen, due a lot to the truth behind it and I don't think the ending was as Hollywood as people say-there was no racing to the finish line and hugs all around as people raced out of their seats and the news was swept all over the radio... etc etc etc. The camera just sort of fades out-with the audience knowing how it turns out. That was well done and CLASSY.The acting was wonderful as well, especially Toby Mguire who really SHOULD get an academy award nomination for this. The beginning does drag a bit, Sea Biscuit doesn't even make his first appearance until about 45-60 minutes into the film-stay with it! You won't be sorry you did.The best scenes, other then The horse racing of coarse were the scenes of bonding between Sea Biscuit and Toby Mguire. Everyone has hurdles in life and everyone gets banged around a bit by the quirks of fate. Sometimes, hope and inspiration are found in unusual and wonderful places. And that is what makes the story of Sea Biscuit so wonderful.",10,0,1,27 December 2003
School of Rock," I'd go see School Of Rock in concert any day!
","SPOILERS THROUGH: What a great idea for a movie and a great all around movie! Now this is what we, the viewing public, get when everything works. Good direction, good cast, a solid story and some great ROCK-N-ROLL! The result is a movie destined to become a classic in the way of a 'This is Spinal Tap'. Definitely a breath of fresh air.It's always good to see a movie that captures the essence of rock-n-roll. Not to many do. School Of Rock starts out good, but gains momentum along the way until, by the end, it's clearly a great great movie. Kudoes to everyone involved in the making of this one.A lot of people I know who did not like it said it's because it's to feel good and by the numbers-that it's not unpredictable enough. I can see that applying to certain types of movies but not to something like this. This is a movie about, above all else, rock-n-roll. The first criteria should not be :does it have twists and turns, is it unpredictable enough etc. What the main criteria, in my opinion, should be is: does the movie rock??!! Does it make you feel good as great rock-n-roll does? Does it contain believable characters, characters that one can relate to? Does it have great rock-n-roll moments that inspire one to remember what it is they love about rock-n-roll in the first place? The answers to these questions are:yes, yes, yes and YES!This isn't the best rock movie ever done but it is maybe one of the most lovable. I really didn't care how predictable the plot was if I could visualize it happening and relate to it. School of Rock somehow captures the essence of what it is to just love your craft (your craft being music.) It is exceptionally well written and just all out cool! Jack Black does quite an impressive job here as do all the children and pretty much everybody. Unfortunately I did not see this in the theater though I wish I had. I really enjoyed this and am pleased to see that Hollywood still knows how to make great rock-n-roll movies. (I was kind of thinking they didn't.) My vote is 8.5 of 10. Good movie.",8,1,1,28 December 2005
Coyote Ugly," cookie cutter when it could have been cutting edge.
","It's not that there's anything wrong with Coyote Ugly. It is certainly watchable and not near as bad as some would make it out to be. I'ts even fun in some areas.What is lacking however is any originality. It is completely generic. Cookie cutter is a great word. I had a problem with that aspect of it, that and the complete lack of believability in anything about it.Violet (I'm sorry, beautiful name but this girl did not look like a 'violet'-Cindy, Stacy maybe but not Violet) is determined to become a song writer and moves to the big bad apple to do just that. Yet from the opening scene(WARNING-SPOILERS THROUT REST OF POST) we know exactly where this movie is going, the predictable formulated movie problems that will get in her way, the movie characters that will appear and how it will all end.This movie reminded me of two others-flashdance meets cocktail-Yet even though I don't think either of those movies was particularly great they had something that I can't put my finger on that was lacking in Ugly.The strengths of the movie was in the quirky cast and the actual bar scenes-this is a perfect movie to watch when you don't want to concentrate to hard because you don't have to with this. Yet although this movie was better then it was reported to be, it was also light years away from being anywhere near as good as it could have been. There was a lack of buildup toward things-characters simply appear, things happen that are so unrealistic they border on ridiculous-take away the racy dancing on bars and a few other things and this could have been a 1 hour after school special on going for your dreams etc etc-not that all after school specials are bad but there is this unreal quality to the movie-and a rush at the end to make it feel good that reminded me of a high school version of cocktail(a better movie in my opinion). A good example is the whole painfully dull ordeal of Violet getting to the club in time to sing her song and become a star(which you know through all the u turns, screaming and general hysteria is gonna happen anyway).Still, the movie wasn't all bad-good looking characters,fun dancing and singing, a few great one liners-all combined to make Coyote a pleasant movie view if not outstanding. 6 out of 10 is my vote.",6,0,1,5 June 2004
Moulin Rouge!," A visual masterpiece.
","The word mezmerizing comes to mind. Moulin Rouge was a great film, of coarse it was, it's one of the few films you barely even see any negative reviews on. Nicole Kidman was WONDERFUL as Satine etc etc. I'm not gonna get into it to much since everyone else has but I will say this. For the skeptics who haven't seen it-this film is a visual masterpiece even if you don't think you'll like the movie see it for that reason.I had really looked forward to seeing this a lot and luckily this was one that DIDN'T disappoint. It really is a terrific movie.Never mind the great music, cabaret, costumes acting, etc etc(I know I wasn't gonna get into it-can't help it.)There are plenty of other great films out there, even better films, but many great ones even ones I rated higher(I gave this a 9) don't have the ability to DAZZLE like this. From start to finish Moulin Rouge is an extravaganza of lights, colors and cabaret that'll take you by storm, leave you breathless and make even the biggest skeptic awstruck!",9,3,4,20 August 2003
Meet Joe Black," so sweet....
","Surprisingly, Meet Joe black left me feeling good. I say 'surprisingly' because I knew the polt line which sounded very gloomy and I had some initial concerns about watching it. Although I did not get to see it from start to finish(came in after it started) I watched it through to end and found myself charmed and touched at this unusual movie.Oh of coarse I cried to-that's inevitable when watching a movie like this. But the gloom and doom that can proceed this type of movie (for instance I walked out of 'City of angels') just wasn't here and I enjoyed Meet Joe Black. It was fun to see Pitt in this kind of role and contrary to what I've heard many say, I thought he and Claire Forlini had oodles of chemistry-more then Pitt had with almost any actress I've seen him on screen with.The movie is very much a downer in some places and the ending was both sad and beautiful but It is worth watching though I wouldn't rank it as one of my faves. I'd give it a 7 of 10 but you have to be in the right mood to see it because of the subject matter and the movie's length.",7,1,2,26 November 2004
The Illusionist," enthralling.
","SPOILERS:This is the kind of picture to just get lost in. I found this movie utterly captivating. So far I have liked every film I've ever seen Ed Norton in. This one is no different and maybe my favorite. From beginning to end The Illusionist is completely and utterly enthralling.The cast was excellent. Ed Norton was the perfect choice to play The Illusionist. Giamotti was superb. I didn't see this before the Academy awards but now that I have I can't believe none of the performers were at least nominated. They were that good.The visuals were magnificent, visually stunning. The magic and how it was used was fascinating to watch and done beautifully. And what a musical score! It was as captivatingly lovely as the imagery and fit perfectly. This movie reminded me of an old style Hollywood film, the kind of thing that one doesn't see a lot of anymore. The constant feeling of mystery, combined with the lush visuals, compelling story and fine acting came together in a movie that was exceptional. I adored it. It's rare that a movie can be this powerfully engrossing within the first few minutes but it is. Definitely one that should have received more recognition.There were several 'twists' and all were done really well. I did not predict the end 'twist'....and I am usually pretty good with that type of thing. Oh Yeah I had figured the two lovers would be together but I thought he'd either bring her back to life or he would die as well as her. It never occurred to me she was still alive. I thought the twist was brilliant and the end really wowed me. I know twists in movies are pretty standard fare now but this one still managed to surprise....a lot.As mentioned Norton was superb. And Biel, in her rather small role as the duchess was very good. The love story was very believable. Giamotti was amazing. I can't believe this is the same guy from 'Sideways'. That's why they call it acting I guess. This guy really needs to win an Oscar.I can't say this was perfect because there was one thing that bothered me and that was the suicide scene. I didn't think that needed to be there and was not necessary to the story. But putting that one point aside, I found this tale of love, mystery and magic to be enthralling and a wonderful addition to the great movies of this past year and absolutely top notch in every way. It's a must see for fans of period films, romances, Ed Norton and Paul Giamotti fans or fans of magic.",9,0,0,4 March 2007
Empire Records," a hilarious, nostalgic and rocking trip down memory lane!
","How did I miss this when It came out? Being that I used to search for movies of this type, I don't see how this gem slipped me by. I just watched saw it for the first time this week(after being inspired by many a glowing IMDb user comment!!) and found it be really terrific. The movie really affected me and watching it was an absolute trip. I want them to do a part two and I just saw part one! I guess I'm a little late in jumping on on the Empire Records train....This movie is a breath of fresh air. The characters are so relateable. And lovable. Joe is awesome! 'Warren Beaty' steals every scene he's in. And it is just so much fun in general. The musical choices are great. The numerous one liners are Brilliant! Of Coarse I saw other movies I've loved reflected in this one (examples being 'The Breakfast Club', 'Clerks', etc). But I think this had it's own unique charm. It's such a good choice for anyone who's a music fan out there, as well as to anyone who's coming of age and just not really sure what they want and where their going. It's a little less talky then some of the other similar movies and it seems a celebration of freedom and rock-n-roll. I was also strongly reminded of 'High Fidelity'.Besides being hilarious, touching and nostalgic all at once, Empire Records also had another effect on me and that was making me want to call all my old buddies from that time period to yell at them to see this great movie....immediately. Unfortunately, I doubt many of them would be able to relate anymore. To the people who CAN relate however, who haven't seen this and who may stumble upon this review....take ninety minutes or so and See this little gem and take your own trip down memory lane.I will be recommending this movie to the people in my life who I know will dig this peppy flick.",7,0,0,24 February 2007
Dumb and Dumber," about as funny as a toothache.
","This movie is a perfect example of whats NOT good about comedies-Dumb and Dumber was a movie I never wanted to see, finnaly did and wish fervently that I hadn't. Jim Carey was great in this year's 'Bruce Almighty'. But this movie isn't good enough for him. Actually its just not good period.",3,11,26,8 December 2003
Shrek 2," Just as good the second time around.
","It is extremely difficult, under the best of circumstances to make a good sequel-particularly if the first installment is a 10. Shrek 2 has done it and is destined to follow it's predessor to go down as a classic.I was a bit worried going into this whether Shrek magic could be recreated but they have done it. Shrek 2 is a colloge of wit, fun, colorful imagery and jam packed with adventure, hilarity movie and character tributes-it packs the same delicious punch as the first one.The main characters are back with a vengeance and this time there are quite a few new ones as well-I'm not gonna get into reviewing the story which 90 percent or more know anyway, or giving away any of the funnier lines to the 10 percent or less who may not yet have seen it-what I will say is it's highly unlikely one who loves Shrek 1 will walk away disappointed.Special kudos to Puss and boots-played by Antonio Banderes in a fantastic performance-also additional kudos to the, never fails to be hilarious, gingerbread boy who, as in the first Shrek, quietly provides the finishing touches of pure hilarity-he was one of my favorites in the first installment and I was quite pleased he was brought back in the second.If I had one thing I was a bit disappointed by, it is (SPOILER) that Dragon wasn't brought back as a main character-it would have been hilarious to see a love struck donkey-I was surprised about that.Most of the really hilarious stuff-the fall down in your seat hilarity, takes place in the second half of the movie-during the first half your just glad to see all your favorites together again on screen.It is never dull and always entertains-I look forward to Shrek 3-I never thought I'd be a fan of animated pictures but Shrek has made me a believer! Good job to all-8 of 10.",8,0,0,5 June 2004
Kill Bill: Vol. 1," Silly Rabbit
","SPOILERS THROUGHOUT:So what do I say in my review? How wonderful, how great this movie is? Well, many Know that. It is, after all, in the top 100 films of all time. I have a hard time doing reviews on movies like this that are almost to perfect. Whatever can one say? Tarentino's Kill Bill(BOTH volumes) are fully deserving of being called instant classics. There are few movies that mesmerize this much. And really, mesmerize is the perfect word to describe the effect of the Kill Bill movies. They are simply extraordinary. But there was one thing I didn't like in volume one that was not so prevelent in two.That's the violence. I enjoyed both movies but I did give Volume two a ten and this a nine. The reason is the violence. It was a bit much in the first volume. Many people I know, still have yet to see either of the Kill Bill movies because of this reason and I myself was a bit wary at first. One is a lot worse in this regard then two and even though I think the movie is fantastic in it's photography, writing, performances etc, the brutality was tough to take. I really can see how someone could NOT like this.I actually prefer two a bit because of the highly charged dialog driven atmosphere. I will concede however, that it really doesn't matter which version one personally prefers-their both stunningly great movies.The gore in volume one is, many times, almost cartoonish but there are still parts where one wants to say 'enough already'. It is just to much(OK it's Tarentino but still....).Of coarse, many would argue that was necessary for the overall story. That is my one major gripe about volume one, otherwise I'd say it was perfect. When I say I liked two better, it wins by a smidgen anyway, and for mainly that reason, and another reason is because everything comes together in the second one. I am actually glad they were released as two separate pictures.My favorite character(other then the bride)? I just don't know. I liked all of them. O'wren Ishi was an intense person to watch, Mountain Snake was so evil (kudos to Hanna, who'd have ever thought we'd see the innocent little mermaid in a role like this?) And there was something about that twisted little assistant Gogo that was (here's that word again) mesmerizing, she kind of stole the show in some ways.My favorite scene may have been the fight between Liu and Thurman. Although that scene was mighty intense, it was spellbinding the way it was carried out, all that intensity against the cool, lovely wintry setting.To me, the Kill Bill movies are almost to good, in that one really does not want them to end. I really would, as would some of my friends, like to see a prequel(with the SAME cast please). I'd like to know see how they all met, their various relationships with each other, what made them assassins( we do not know except for Lui). I'd like to see the love story between Bill and The Bride, I'd like to see friendships being built, each person's story. I'd like to see it all! The story of Kill Bill is to good to leave alone. Although follow ups are almost always bad, this IS Tarenteno. Hey, you never know....",9,8,18,13 April 2005
Jerry Maguire," This likable Film with likable main characters is Tom Cruise's best movie.
","SPOILERS THROUGHOUT:I just caught this gem this week(did not see it when it was in the theaters, my loss). I knew Jerry Maguire had been widely talked about and also knew that it, and it's performers, had been up for numerous awards but had felt no strong desire to see it. That was a mistake, as this was throughly enjoyable.This was a great movie about love,friendship and the highs and lows of the entertainment industry. (When your hot-everyone loves you-but when your not....well..)This was a difficult story for me to watch. I've worked in entertainment and been where Tom cruise's character was(bottom). This movie really hit everything on the head and in addition to the realism of the characters(sadly this type of thing happens way to much in ANY industry) manages to inspire hope as well without being to over the top and the main characters are both likable and interesting. It's a really good film.I really enjoyed Tom Cruise tremendously and as I'm not a big fan of his(or wasn't until now) that was nice. Renee was as always flawless and I was bowled over by Cubing Gooding's performance. (I had particular interest in seeing him to see who could possibly beat out Ed Norton for best supporting actor.) I won't say he was better then Norton but he WAS great and he earned his Oscar and nailed the character to the tee. This movie also has some absolute great quotes like(here it comes): SHOW ME THE MONEY!!If anyone reading this hasn't seen the movie go rent it. I really have very little, if anything negative, to say.",8,2,5,11 August 2003
Charlie and the Chocolate Factory," a good time was had at the chocolate factory.
","SPOILERS THROUGHOUT: It's so nice when you see a remake that is actually good. And Charlie and the Chocolate factory is a winner all around-although it is hard to think of this as a remake as it's so different from the original.This version is a delightfully engaging, vivid, chocolaty dream. I actually liked Johnny Depp in the role of Willy Wonka, yes he was creepy to be sure, but he was also up to the task and there are only a handful of actors who I think would have fit in the role. (My friend and I went over who else would have been good and came up with Jim Carrey, Robin Williams and oddly enough Hugh Grant to name a few.) Though many have remarked on the similarities to Michael Jackson, and I did indeed see them, they were not nearly as intense as I was lead to believe and Wonka definitely has his own persona, independent of Michael Jackson, Keith Richards, Edward scissor hands or anyone really. Depp puts humor into the role as swell as creepiness and it works.And the other cast members were exceptional as well, most notably Freddy Highmore as Charlie. The other children were delightfully bratty as ever and it was great to see the oompa loompas again. Special Kudos to the nut cracking squirrels. The movie is very true to the book and the things that were added I thought enhanced the story rather then detracted. It was very well done.And the special effects-incredible-flowing Chocolate everywhere you turn, flying elevators, sugary streams and glowing iridescent colors everywhere. The Special effects are in a class by themselves and hopefully the movie will win some awards in that department. All in all Charlie and the Chocolate Factory is an unexpected, delicious surprise. The original is a classic but this is a fine remake and hopefully many children growing up, will see it and fall in love with the story as so many did all those years ago. I really did not expect to like this much, if at all, but it was a delight and oodles of fun all the way through. My vote is a strong 9 of 10.",9,2,4,24 July 2005
The Insider," yes this was great.
","SPOILERS THROUGH: There is very little that I can add to many of the glowing reviews. I thought The Insider was incredible. Flawless from beginning to end. It's in the IMDb top 250 and small wonder. It was a superb movie.There are so many elements in this movie that are fascinating. The journalistic issues. The issues of whistle blowing and doing the right thing. In my view both the main characters are heroes. The fact that this is based on a true story makes it that much more fascinating.Pacino and Crowe both, in my opinion, gave flawless performances and both were excellent at drawing the viewer in(let me change that) SWEEPING the viewer in to their lives and the things they were fighting for. There are many movies that take on important issues but lack the ability to keep the movie interesting. That's not the case here as the movie literally simmers from start to finish and through the last hour or so, I don't think I moved. That's the type of film this is and it is absolutely outstanding.This was one of the best roles I've seen Al Pacino in and though I have not seen a lot of Crowe's work, he is wonderful here and well cast.The supporting cast was wonderful too. There have been so many movies made about deception and dishonesty, it's nice to see a movie where the main characters are courageous and heroic. The Insider is all at once absorbing, disturbing, thought provoking and triumphant. In other words, it's everything a good movie should be. This is a long movie but the time goes very quickly and it's not the type of movie that could have been any shorter. (It actually could have been even longer.) Everything from the acting to the camera work(some of it quite unusual) to the story itself is top notch and this is an example of a great film and that rare movie that myself and my film going friends can actually agree on. My vote is 10 of 10.",10,8,11,23 July 2006
Men in Black," saw it by accident but liked it more then expected.
","Not being a big fan of the science fiction movie genre I wouldn't have picked this as a movie to see myself but it happened to be on at a friend's house so I saw most of it. This wasn't bad for a scifi-I think, judging by the comments on here most either love it or hate it and I happen to be somewhere in between.I didn't NOT like it and I could easily see someone else loving it. But wouldn't many agree one really has to like the science fiction genre to like this? The plot is so pure scifi you can't even pretend it's anything else and although the special affects were great and I could appreciate them, I am not a major scifi fan and as such, wasn't that into this movie. I will say, though, that even though this isn't really my thing, this always remained watchable and I managed to get through it and even be mildly into it at parts, which is more then I can say for a lot of there similar movies. I guess that shows this was well made, in it's way. But the fact remains this just isn't my type of movie and it didn't make much of a lasting impression on me. Parts of it I thought were just silly and the parts of the movie I REALLY liked were the more dialog driven scenes rather then the action. It's a movie I could see science fiction lovers going crazy for, and as mentioned It WAS better then a few other scifis I have seen.While I probably would not have ever seen this, other then the fact my friend happened to have it on, it wasn't a bad way to spend a few hours. The movie as a whole rates to me about a 5.5.",6,0,0,24 November 2003
The Graduate," Please don't remake this!
","There is very little I can add in complimenting such a beloved classic but I will list some of the reasons why this movie is so great.1)The characters-They speak to us.so much character development. These characters have stayed with us through the years and that's the mark of a good movie(or book.) Can anyone who has seen this hear Mrs. robonson without thinking of this movie? 2)Timelessness-it never gets old and I could still watch it tomorrow and enjoy it as much as I did the first time I saw it many years ago.3)The music. That speaks for itself.4)the 60's atmosphere. This is a movie that takes you back to a wonderful time we'll never see again. It is nostalgic without being dated.Of coarse there is much more-but it's already been said about 1,000 times on here! LOL. There is a realism to these characters that was way ahead of its time and the inner turmoil of as they struggle to find identity and meaning in a world that can be enormously frightening, is touching. I loved the book to, I'm not sure which I preferred but I wouldn't even dare rate this under a 10 for the reasons already mentioned and a heck of a lot more that I can't even think of at the moment.Fully deserving of it's place in the IMDb top movies.",Null,0,1,23 May 2004
There's Something About Mary," A few of the most hysterical scenes I've ever seen.
","SPOILERS:This movie is at the top of the heap as far as comedies go. Not because the whole movie is consistently roll in your seat hilarious but, rather because there are a few scenes here that go kind of beyond that. Something About Mary had a few scenes that go down in comedy history for me. AnD any major fan of the movie will probably know, to what scenes I refer. It also introduced me to Cameron Diez and managed to have an interesting story thrown in with all that wacky comedy. It definitely made it's mark! This movie had the whole theater in hysterics when I saw it including me. This movie is so very funny. To be honest not every scene is that great, there are a few draggy moments, the movie's not perfect but it's true moments of comedy are just tops and there are a few of the most purely hilarious scenes I've ever seen in a movie contained here. When one goes to a movie expecting just another, mildly funny, comedy and instead gets something like this it's definitely a surprise. I don't think I really know anyone at all who doesn't like this and that is rare. I know some people didn't going by the IMDb reviews and to be sure, there are some pretty obnoxious moments in this movie but by and large I think the moments of pure hysteria are just so funny, they outweigh anything negative about the movie. My vote's 8 out of 10 as a whole, with a special rating of 10 for at least a couple of scenes.",8,0,1,2 September 2003
Pretty Woman," Just has that special something....
","What is it about this movie that made it such an instant mega smash when it was released? I'm not sure if it's The incredible chemistry between Gear and Roberts, the smart dialog, the storyline-combination of all of the above-etc etc. But I do think These days, so few GREAT romantic comedies get made. Pretty woman is great. I enjoyed every moment of this and have seen it many times.I haven't read any IMDb reviews of this yet, I wanted to comment first. This is a lovely story of hope and the true purity of falling madly in love-there are so many movies that try to be romantic and inevitably come across looking forced and contrived. The story and acting in Pretty woman, while very obviously being 'Hollywood' to a tee, are so natural and free flowing, that it's just a joy to watch this. It's also great to see(in what's not usually the case) a romantic comedy that gets it right, in every area from casting to dialog to pretty much everything from start to finish.

I loved it and so did everyone I know.",8,0,2,29 January 2004
Detroit Rock City," One word:Rockin
","I liked detroit rock city for one reason and one reason only. I am a metal fan and this movie brought to the big screen the adrenalin fueled craziness that is Kiss and hard rock music in general. Anybody looking for 'depth' in this, has the wrong movie. I like all types of movies and sometimes I like my movies deep. But not all the time. Sometimes I want to smile. Sometimes I want to be entertained. This movie does that and it does that well.I think the bottom line is, if you are a Kiss fan or fan of hard rock in general you will love this. If you are not such a fan, but still open to movies where the sole purpose is to entertain you may like it. But if you hate Kiss or have no interest in their type of music in general your more likely to have no particular interest in this. Me, I thought it was great! Kiss forever!

What a lovely piece of escape from the world!You don't have to be a child to like this, watch it when you want that delicious feeling of being in a fairyland of joy and wonder when anything's possible. Not a bad way to feel for an hour or two.",7,0,1,13 November 2003
Mr. & Mrs. Smith," Mr and Mrs Smith is a hit.
","SPOILERS: This movie was so much better then I ever thought it would be. Just saw it last night and the theater was so packed we could barely find a seat. Good turnout for a really good movie. This is definitely a great summer's release.Jolie and Pitt have oodles of chemistry, not just physically but the way their able to keep their back and forth banter so interesting and entertaining. These two really carry the movie and it works. It is one of the most energetic movies I've seen in awhile and people look like they had a good time being in it. I'm definitely glad I saw it.The movie is both an action movie and a comedy. And the comedy is just great. There are a lot of funny lines and Vince Vaughn was incredible as well, should have been in it more. The movie didn't take itself seriously at all and that is definitely a good thing. The wit factor was an unexpected pleasure because so many movies try to be funny and aren't. This had a lot of great one liners.It also had something else which I must mention because I still laugh thinking about it. It had Pitt singing along to Air Supply's 'Making Love out of nothing at all.' Now bear in mind Pitt is not known as a major comic actor. But this scene was totally and completely hilarious. I am not sure just why I am singling this one scene out but it was the funniest scene I have seen in awhile. Pitt's got a gift for comedy!! Who'd have thunk it? Not me, the way he plays to the camera is really good and of coarse Jolie is great to, when the two of them are on screen together they shine. Good job.The second thing I liked about it was the action sequences, particularly when Jolie jumps from the window. These action scenes are incredibly filmed and even though I, for the most part, don't like action movies, I got into this. The action sequences were never long enough to get boring(until the end that is-more on that in a minute), and kind of reminded me of 'The Italion Job' with the way they were able to keep it all interesting and very larger then life.Now-negatives(and there are some.) The last half hour. It was really dull for two reasons. One is because Pitt and Jolie stop sparring so much and start being chased. A lot. That brings me to the second negative. The action scenes become the focus of the movie rather then Mr and Mrs Smith themselves and that is where the movie loses focus. Had that not been the case, I'd probably give this a 9, because it had a lot of positives. But it became to much of a cliché at the end and lost it's sense of uniqueness which is the main thing it had going for it. Time did not pass quickly either, you always feel the time and it feels like it is way longer then it is. I think there should have been less of all that stuff at the end. I mean here are these two people who have such terrific energy and wit between them and the last part of the movie becomes a mix of a hundred movies we've seen before. I was disappointed with that.In spite of the flaws, it was a fun and energetic movie, and much better then it could have been. It's worth seeing as long as you don't think to hard about the plot and just enjoy it for what it is, an off the wall action/comedy with two very entertaining leads. Oh and one more thing. This movie is wide open for a sequel and I bet that there will be one. My vote is 8 of 10.",8,1,5,12 June 2005
Rosemary's Baby," the best supernatural movie ever made?
","I'm not sure about that but Rosemary's baby has got to be one of the best, if not the best, psychological supernatural thrillers ever made. The real test of a good movie(or one of them) is can it hold up to multiple viewings? In this case-oh yes.I cannot even count how many times I have seen this. A good-really good-'scary movie' must have more then the ability to merely scare, it must have the ability to haunt. Rosemary's baby is a movie where certain scenes become etched in memory. Movie as good as book which is almost a non existent thing.This is not a slow moving picture at all or at least I don't see it as one. What this movie does, as does another Levin creation, Stepford wives, is lure you in. There maybe moments that are not scary but as it goes on and you keep watching you start to get more and more creeped out-the atmosphere is what does it-even if someone were tuning in and didn't know this story already-the creepy feeling that something's very wrong is still there strongly from the beginning, strengthening in tone as you get deeper into the picture until by the end and the final few scenes your blown away.This is definitely more subtley and atmospherically creepy then a 'boo' in your face scare fest like 'scream'. It is the type of movie you very rarely see anymore.If anyone, by chance has NOT seen it they are missing someone-I don't recall seeing this in the IMDb top 250-while I'm not sure I'd put it in my top 10, I still think this maybe should be there, in IMDb'S top 250, it's been an influence on so many other movies and so few movies have been able to follow the movie's lead in the same well done way.",10,136,187,29 April 2004
When Harry Met Sally...," One of the best romantic comedies ever made.
","SPOILERS:When Harry met Sally is a romantic comedy classic that many have tried to emulate since it came out. Not that they've succeeded. But this movie that's often imitated, never duplicated is flawless from start to finish. Meg Ryan who I'm not a major fan of is adorable as Sally, sadly though I think this role may have 'typcast' her a little. Billy Crystal is wonderful, I enjoyed this so much and it's one movie that can be watched over and over and never loses it's magical flavor.This is definitely up there as one of my favorite romantic comedies ever And it does something that is rare in these types of movies, it manages to be sweet, funny AND extremely deep with incredibly intelligent dialogue and unforgettable characters.I love the theme of the movie, and that it is interesting and thought provoking while still being fun and humorous-it looks at male/female relationships-can men and women just be friends? I really am not sure, in real life, the movie would have had the ending it did but hey you never know. So many people love this movie and have made comments, I'm not even gonna go on. When Harry met sally is a high quality romantic comedy that is a 10 of 10 and a movie that ages like fine wine, it gets better every time it's watched.",10,1,3,23 August 2003
The Holiday," definitely NOT your typical romantic comedy.
","SPOILERS THROUGH:One of my best friends saw this and hated it. Our tastes are similar so I went in thinking it wouldn't be my cup of tea. Well this is one where we differed radically because I absolutely adored it.The Holiday definitely had some problems but by and large I found it to be an enamoring story and quite fun to watch. It was definitely much better then I expected.The main pluses of the movie are it's characters who you get really invested in as the movie goes along, and the writing. I felt much of the dialog was very intelligent and well written, particularly the scene where Winslet's character has that monologue with Jack Black where she talks about unrequited love. As Hollywood as the movie is....and it's VERY Hollywood..the acting and writing are good enough to elevate it and the film kind of taps into a certain element, a bittersweet aspect that one really would not expect to find in a movie such as this. Very 'Bridget Jonesey' but in a good way.It also reminded me of 'Love Actually'. Although Love Actually is clearly a better movie there were some similarities. The characters are developed very well and a lot of the dialog, besides being intelligent, is surprisingly down to earth. The Diez and Law romance, even though there are some aspects that are completely unrealistic, is developed so slowly and naturally that it's breath of fresh air. The chemistry between them is also absolutely sizzling and they are the kind of screen couple where you kind of hope they get together off screen as well because there is just something very natural and real about their on screen romance.Winselt and Balck's relationship is developed too but the romantic aspect feel a bit rushed. In reality, sadly, there's a good chance these characters would not have got together but instead gone back to their toxic relationships. There is a false note about their romance because it happens way to quick and both were simply to in love with other people to make their coming together look completely natural but by that time, I was so happy Winslet was over that jerk she was with, it was OK to rush it a little. And her and Black made a pretty good couple as well.The main negative to The Holiday is that there is some cheesy scenes and dialog and it's all interspersed with the intelligent parts. Sometimes the audience gets cheese and intelligent writing in the same scene, in a matter of seconds. So it's somewhat difficult, at times, to take the serious things seriously and the non serious things non seriously. And yes it is predictable. (Did we not know Cameron's character would finally be able to cry as she said goodbye to Jude Law?) But really the movie is so much fun, one can try to overlook those aspects.There is some very good comedy in the movie too. As far as performances, Winslet is the scene stealer-bar none. Jude law is...Jude law. A charismatic and fun Jude Law but still law. Jack Black is...Jack Black. A lovable Jack Black most definitely but still Jack Black. Cameron Diez is...Cameron Diez. A complex, moody and fragile Diez to be sure but still Diez. But Winslet is....something else again. This is not an Oscar Worthy film, as good as it is, but Winslet's performance is luminous. She is pure magic.I would definitely recommend the movie, except to people who absolutely can't stand romantic comedies. I'd give it an 8 and definitely see it again.",8,2,3,3 June 2007
Love Actually," The sweetness of this gem of a movie is irresistible.
","What a sweet feel good movie! I liked Love Actually very much actually! The movie's central theme is-what else-love. And how love can be found anywhere. You just have to look for it. OK-call the movie sappy, call it corny etc-but also call it good, very good. In a time when there are so many movies where the central themes are violence and indeed at a time when there is so much violence all around us-not just the movies-isn't it NICE to have a sweet little fairytale of a movie once in awhile? Now some people have said there were to many stories in the movie and although I could understand that I enjoyed all of them. Some stories got more time then others and I did feel that some should have got more time that didn't. Still thats a minor criticism. GO SEE THE MOVIE IF YOU HAVEN'T! It'll leave you feeling good. And some scenes will make you laugh hysterically, there is a lot of humor in this movie too.SPOILERS: My only problem with the movie was with Laura Linny(Sarah's) storyline. It was not wound up neatly-to the contrary it seems like the writers forgot about her completely. I know that not everything can end happy in real life. Still-if the movie was going for sappy and uplifting it should have gone all the way. To just leave one of the best story lines hanging like that-it took away a little something. Even if Sarah and Carl did NOT wind up together there should have been a final scene between them. Also the whole theme of the movie is you should speak out and proclaim how you feel. So why didn't Sarah speak out to Carl and just TELL him about her brother? I think, though, the writers were trying to say that love comes in many ways and her story was about her love for her brother rather then her love for a boyfriend. Still I'm a sucker for happy endings so I didn't like that!All in all though I still felt Love Actually was a nine of 10. And the BEST scenes by far was the opening and closing(people hugging in the airport etc). When life feels particularly bitter, a movie like this is heaven. Definitely one of the must see movies of the year!",9,1,3,22 November 2003
Wedding Crashers," Just when one thinks comedy is extinct, Wedding Crashers crashes on to the big screen ....
","SPOILERS THROUGHOUT: The Wedding Crashers is definitely not for everyone but I thought it was one of the funniest comedies I've seen in years. And that's not an exaggeration because there were truly times I thought I'd have to leave the theater I was laughing so hard. This isn't an Oscar contender, it's a funny contender.One problem with a lot of Comedies is that there is one person who usually gets the funny lines and that's it. All the humor revolves around that person. Not so here. Wedding crashers is chock full of hilarious off the wall people and they all get their moment (or moments) to let the comedy rip. It's a movie that has consistently funny things happening constantly and that's a rarity in the comedy genre.The amount of comedy here is strong and there are a few scenes that may have made me laugh harder then I ever have in the theater-particularly a certain dinner scene starring Vince Vaughn and Isla Fisher. Okay-this movie has made100 maybe 200 million already so it stands to reason I should have expected something really funny but I didn't. I thought I'd be under whelmed.All the performers were great but I must single out Isla Fisher who played Gloria. She has a great future as one of the best comedic actresses I have ever seen. I loved Jane Seymour in this and Rachel Mc.Adams-well what can one say-she is so lovely and talented she creates such a realistic character in an off the wall comedy. One day this woman will win an Oscar, that's practically a given.The men were great too, although Walkin was somewhat underused. Vince Vaughn is the next Jim Carey and Owen Wilson surprised me in that he played the romantic lead with such finesse. Everyone was cast perfectly.I have no problem giving comedies 9's or even 10's if their flawless. This wasn't though. Even though I loved it, it had flaws. There was NOTHING that was off limits in the movie's almost satirical tone. There were some things that were more cruel then funny. A few scenes where the guys were getting hit, beat up and shot were rather gross. And the crashing funerals....well, I know it's central to the movie's premise and overall resolution but I did think it was a bit much as was the reference to Jodie Foster's character in The Accused which for some reason rubbed me the wrong way as well. This is not a movie to see if one's easily offended. Actually, even People who AREN'T easily offended may have problems because the movie's comedy simply touches on to many areas someone might consider off limits, it's almost inevitable that one will get offended about something unless one's tolerance level is really high.I also think the last half hour or so became a bit to soppy. This movie, in a way, started to remind me of a sicker more twisted version of Sideways-or maybe The Wedding Singer. Or maybe both. I don't think a comedy at this level can really aspire to also be THAT sweetly sentimental because then the level of humor goes way down. I did appreciate the happy ending, this movie almost guarantees that, but the brief period the two friends are estranged wasn't really needed-or anyway it didn't need to be that bleak. Not after what the audience sees for the first ninety minutes.In spite of the flaws-this is an 8.5 (at least) and definitely a movie I will recommend, watch again myself AND may have to own when it comes to DVD. My vote on this rowdy, twisted, unrealistic, strange and totally hilarious comedy is 8.5 out of 10.",8,2,3,4 September 2005
Ice Age," The cute Factor
","SPOILERS: I didn't get into this movie all that much, maybe because I am not a big fan of animated pictures though I've started watching more of them, in the last few years, Thanks to a great movie called Shrek. Yet even though I wasn't that into this I still gave it a 6. Not a great rating but a bit above average. And that's for one reason.Ice Age has one main thing going for it and that's 'the cute factor'. In fact the adorable factor! Be prepared, people who may not have seen this, if you are an animal lover, you will find many friends here. I think part of the reason Ice Age was made was to make the viewer melt a little at all the cute little animals scampering across the screen. And yes it worked. On me anyway.Ice Age is NOT a movie I enjoyed strongly but it is a movie that pushed all the right buttons for me in terms of the cute factor. The plot does take awhile to get going. During the first half, I wanted to go to sleep. During the second half, I wanted to hug all the characters. They all reach out and draw you in on their wintery journey, particularly Diego (and that darn squirrel!!).Another positive is that the movie, blissfully, does not wear out it's welcome because it's rather short and doesn't go on and on and on. Ice Age is not a movie I'd watch over and over again, it's a little dull at times and is not in the league of a Shrek, but it is perfect when one is exhausted and just wants to lose themselves in cuteness. It's complete cuteness and warmth and sometimes that's not a bad thing!",6,1,2,7 April 2005
Bram Stoker's Dracula," Oddly enthralling yet hopelessly boring in certain places.
","When I saw Dracula I went in not having read the book or knowing the story at all. That was probably a mistake. This is a movie that's extremely difficult to follow if you go in blind, not knowing the history. Therefore, there are many places where you won't really know what's going on if you don't know the history of the story.In spite of that, and in spite of the flaws in the film, I did mildly enjoy this-even though I felt oddly lost at many times throughout the movie. The cinematography, as mentioned by many before me, is simply enthralling-richly gorgeous sets, breathtaking photography, the movie succeeds in setting the dark Gothic tone of the movie-on a scale of 1 to 10 the movie gets a 10 in that respect.However, the reason I enjoyed this wasn't the scenery. Rather it was the almost hypnotic chemistry between Oldman and Ryder which has got to be among the strongest I've ever seen on screen. the scenes between them are so luminously beautiful, you kind of go through the whole film just to see the two of them on screen together. The casting of these two in the main roles definitely produced movie magic-when Rider utters the line'take me away from all this death' I got shivers down my spine. Both of them gave Oscar worthy performances. But it was the on screen chemistry between them that singlehandedly fueled the movie and made it what it was.In spite of that, though, there were so many flaws to the movie I couldn't give it above a 7. There was a muted quality to the sound, at times it was hard to understand what anyone was saying. Likewise, there was a choppiness through many of the scenes, a lack of smoothness that as I mentioned makes the movie extremely difficult to follow and frankly when Rider and Oldman are not on the screen the movie is at times boring. I wish the movie had flowed more smoothly then it did,and had been a bit shorter, in spite of those flaws there is an enthralling beauty about the film which Rider and Oldman deserve a lot of the credit for. My rating is 7 out of 10. A good movie with some great moments-but not perfect.",7,1,2,29 February 2004
Anchorman: The Legend of Ron Burgundy," nowhere near as good as it looked in the previews.
","SPOILERS THROUGHOUT:Anchorman was a case of a movie that looked great in previews that really wasn't all that good when I saw it. I do love comedies and this looked to be a good one but I felt it was highly overrated and was rather a disappointment.The main problem I had with Anchorman was the humor. It just wasn't very funny. Some of the attempts at humor were obnoxious, and though there were a few laugh out loud funny jokes (although I can't even recall what those are now) for the most part, the humor was very cliché and nothing new. The movie wasn't that long either but did actually drag in certain places.Ferrell was pretty good, Applegate wasn't bad (though, to me, she seemed to be trying not to laugh at times), but this movie, while harmless enough was almost desperately trying to engage the audience in laughter-nothing was all that funny, and nothing was terribly original. I also never believed I was watching media people, and though the movie may have tried at humor it didn't try at much else. And I REALLY could have done without that scene of the dog being thrown into the water.It is very difficult to take a movie seriously when one gets the feeling the cast isn't taking it seriously. Although I know people who like this movie, for me it's definitely below average and a bit of a disappointment. I was expecting some believability and at least an attempt at a story. I was also expecting a high degree of wit and fun. Instead what I got was a bunch of tired jokes, none very original. There were some positives-the movie wasn't overlong, the direction was good, the story was actually A good one (and would have made an excellent movie if more time had gone into the dialog, and the story had been taken at all Seriously). The best thing in the movie was the outtakes at the end. My vote is a 4 of 10.",4,19,38,1 January 2006
Stranger Than Fiction," superb.
","SPOILERS:So what's a guy to do when he finds out he is a character in an author's budding manuscript? That's the dilemma of a certain IRS Agent played by Will Ferrell in this delightful and different little gem. This is one of the best movies I've seen in awhile and is a definite must see. It's superb.Stanger then fiction reminded me of another favorite of mine, 'The Truman Show'. This movie though, while being quite serious at times, is not nearly as dark. The storyline works for many reasons. The cast are all great. I've only seen a few of Maggie Gylenhall's movies but it's difficult to think of her being better then she is here. She is absolutely wonderful as the feisty Anna and Emma Thompson is riveting as the author/narrator.One thing that really makes Stranger Then Fiction so good is that this movie has the ability to combine comedy with some very serious moments and it does both with excellence. The special effects must be mentioned because they are great and very creative. The story itself, while being refreshingly different is also thought provoking and very poignant. The pace of the whole movie is good as well.The character development is also excellent as these characters are developed slowly and precisely and we, the viewer, get to witness transformations in nearly everyone. One gets really invested in the outcome as well, and out of the quirkiness and imaginative element, combined with the sprinklings of surprisingly effective comedy, and the delicate poignancy of the story, comes a movie that's a pure joy to watch.Stranger Then Fiction is a movie that deserves to be an instant classic and is so much more then a movie about a guy who finds he's a character in a book. It's about life, love, and letting go. I've racked my brain but can't think of much of anything negative about it at all. I'd strongly recommend it. It's always good to see a movie that both entertains and has such a large amount of emotional depth. 9.5 out of 10.",9,1,2,21 April 2007
Jaws," one of the best thrillers ever.
","Jaws is one of those movies that not only survives the test of time but gets better. I saw it way back, loved it and my opinion has never changed. This is a movie that is as riveting as it is frightening and it's frightening not because of the whole 'don't go in the water' thing, but the whole element of relaism surrounding the story. You do not even ever feel like your watching a movie, it feels like watching a story unfold right in front of you.I honestly know a few people who wouldn't get in the water after this was made. I still think the book was scarier but this is one of those movies that you can't say a bad thing about because what's to criticise?Haunting, great acting, stunning visually-frightening, timeless-Jaws is a classic-10 of 10 without a doubt.",10,3,7,2 April 2004
Kingpin," tries very hard to be funny.
","I'm sorry. I love love LOVE Woody Harrelson and I love comedies and I really like Bowling! So I wanted to really really like this movie. But I didn't.It's tough to say why but just a few thoughts are....this movie tries REALLY hard to be funny. I felt that immediately. I didn't think it was though nor did I think the story was that strongly interesting. I found certain things funny but never hilarious and the movie sometimes seemed to be just creeping along. Although Harrelson is great, I prefer him in Dramas.I did enjoy the scenery and the bowling theme. I just didn't get into the movie itself, many clichÃ©s and the humor was very forced. I wouldn't call Kingpin dreadful(it's gotton some pretty bad reviews.) But it'll never go down as my favorite either.",4,2,7,3 April 2005
The Lion King," Lovable lions....
","This was one of the first modern animated movies I had seen and I did enjoy it. I went into watching this thinking I wouldn't like it at all and did so that's a plus.I liked this movie in many ways. Obviouysly it was very sweet and touching and the complete aura of realism was there for an animated picture. There were moments I cried, the story was just so touching and I can see why this movie was..is.. so big.However, as much as I liked it, I don't think it was as good as Shrek(just my opinion-I KNOW many will disagree with me on this one!)Shrek probably makes my 50 top films ever. Lion King however was a major influence for me because had I not liked it, I may not have given other similar films a chance.One thing about Lion King. It was heavier then I thought it would be. There's some tough to watch scenes and I was a little surprised they'd be there in a movie that so many children would be seeing. I was expecting a much lighter movie but it was a beautiful film.However, although I wouldn't put this in the same category as Shrek(meaning, for me, I wouldn't necessarily want to watch it over and over as with Shrek) I'd still give it a well above average rating. Lion King was an extremely well done, moving picture.",7,1,5,27 November 2003
Bring It On," For the true blue cheerleader. This isn't a bad movie but a bit predictable and didn't do much for me.
","SPOILERS THROUGH:It's not that there's anything AWFUL about Bring it on but it really is tailer made to fit a certain viewing audience-if your not a teen or a former cheerleader I can't see this being a favorite-though I could be wrong. I myself watched it late night and though I will say I wasn't to bored, it didn't do much for me either.What I didn't like most were two things: the attempts at comedy, most of which weren't to funny, and the whole 'formula' feel to it. Toward the end, at the contest when that line is uttered: 'remember to bring it on'-it was sweet but so forced too, it's a bit hard to take seriously-I'm not putting the movie down at all because, man, it's better then a lot of the garbage that's out today- and the movie has a sweet message.I'd still say, not being a cheerleading fanatic I'd love to see a movie that's a bit different and more of a character study on professional cheerleaders or something along those lines. On the plus side here as mentioned, the movie's message is sweet and the cheerleading itself with all the cool moves was fun to watch, as they did an excellent job with that . This really isn't my kind of thing but it's not awful. I've seen better movies but I've also seen worse.",5,0,1,11 January 2004
The Terminal," Hanks and Spielberg do it again-another winner!
","I've seen some really good movies in 2004 but so far, this maybe the best. The Terminal is an incredible fairy tale of a movie-it's quietly captivating, rich in interesting colorful characters and superbly acted and directed.Tom Hanks as Victor Navorsky is quite simply entrancing to watch. He is an amazing character actor and in The Terminal he again creates a character who is instantly embraceable. You care about Victor and want things to turn out OK for him as much as his friends in the Terminal do.This is a movie that actually got some bad reviews and I'm baffled by why. Although, I usually can see flaws in even the movies I think are 8's and 9's there isn't much to be critical of here. Some people have said it's to 'feel good'. That it's lacking in reality. I don't necessarily see those as negatives, there are many good movies that are feel good or unrealistic, just as there are some bad ones. The Terminal has a lot that's likable about it. Firstly, there's Hanks himself and I will admit if any other actor had played Victor it might not be the movie it is, Hanks is simply amazing, you forget who he is within the first five minutes. I won't mention everyone by name, but the rich array of supporting actors/actresses were all good as well. It is an unusual movie that really isn't either a straight comedy OR a straight drama-it perhaps falls through the cracks of genres but I'd call this mostly a heartwarming and completely absorbing character study of one man's attempt to make a life for himself in an airport terminal. It's a very different type of movie-for all the strategically placed product adds, there's something quietly uncommercial about Terminal and watching it is an interesting experience. The movie is about 2 hours and you get a lot in those two hours. For me what was striking was how genuinely interesting this movie turned out to be. I'm one who finds airport terminals fascinating anyway-all the hundreds of and thousands of people rushing about to hop on a plane and start some new adventure....but to actually live in a terminal-an interesting (and rather strange) concept-Hanks acting here is quiet and understated and at a level surpassing merely 'talented'. He manages to make nibbling a cracker fascinating. I would give this a 10 of 10 and know there are many who may think it's not for them but I found this movie to be a beautiful fairytale of a picture and hope at least Hanks gets an Oscar nod. I also hope that skeptics give this movie a chance-as good a movie as any Hanks film I've ever seen. 10 of 10.",10,212,299,5 July 2004
Music and Lyrics," takes me back a bit to 'Wedding Singer'.
","SPOILERS:I enjoyed Music and Lyrics which was a surprise because it looked absolutely awful in the previews. But I found it much better then average. This is a movie that actually wound up being better.. far better..then it looked which is a surprise because it is usually the other way around.Drew Barrymore and Hugh Grant have a great deal of chemistry and make their budding relationship feel realistic and sweet. Their one major love scene is pretty short and not at all graphic but manages to be more sizzling then a lot of love scenes that do have the other above mentioned elements.Drew Barrymore seems to star in a lot of movies that recall the 80's and that is just fine with me since that was a time period loved. There are several aspects of this movie that remind me of 'The Wedding Singer' which is one of my all time favorite romantic comedies so that definitely works in this movie's favor. It also gives a look into the music business and I found a lot of this movie surprisingly poignant.Basically this is a movie I was sure I would hate that I found to kind of adore. It is sweet, flows very well and feels natural, and has an enormous amount of depth and a surprising amount of humor(there are many things played for laughs that are indeed actually funny). In addition the music featured is great, very 80's and it's a lot of fun to see Hugh Grant seeing. The music is very reminiscent of 'ABC', 'Wham' and many other bands from that time period and the relationship between Grant and Barrymore's characters is one that the audience gets invested in. The supporting cast is excellent as well.I would give this an 8.5 out of 10. I wish the previews had been a little stronger. I'd have probably seen it in the theaters. This is definitely a must see for romantic comedy lovers and fans of the eighties.",8,0,0,19 August 2007
Scream," great premise for a horror
","I'm not into scream the way so many are, meaning I can't remember it scene by scene nor do I have any interest in seeing it again but I liked the movie and got the premise which really was good. a horror within a horror-it was nice to see something that hadn't been done before and the cast was great as were some of the more memorable scenes and lines.But I still don't think scream was a perfect movie, there were at least 2 things I didn't like about it one being the amount of violence it featured. I realize that for the premise of the movie-some violence needs to be there but cmon-after awhile, it was a bit much, scream was more violent then many regualr horror films! I think the movie's best moments were diologe driven-the showy emphasis on all the gore was overdone and done for effect and ditracted from the whole movie in general. I also felt the ending was a bit ridiculous and unlike the plot in general there was nothing brillient about it, it seemed thrown together. I'm trying to do as honest a review as possible because so many either loved or hated this and I'm in between-I definetly did not love it, but moderatly enjoyed it and am glad I saw it. I think they could have stopped with one though.",6,1,2,11 December 2003
Carrie," The one King movie I LOVED!
","Man was this a great movie! Even after all these years this tale can haunt! I'm not a big king fan but this is my favorite of his books and the ONLY movie of his that I actualy liked.I remember growing up thinking about the cruelty of young people and how venoumous it could be. If maybe the story of Carrie could just make an impression on even a FEW children so they could absorb how much childhood taunts and teasing can permanently DAMAGE a person then this movie might actually be more then entertainment and might save some people a lot of pain. Having gone to a school where I knew all kinds of kids, many of them very similiar to the tormentors of Carrie I can say WITHOUT a shadow of a doubt this story nails the angst and heartbreak of the teenage years to a tee. The ONLY PERSON I didn't 'recognize' in the story was Tommy. Honestly, I don't know very many true life males who would have done what he did, at least not in my school.I have to check out the actor who played him,other then 'superman' I don't think I've seen quite a noble male character in movies. At any rate-the beauty of a story like 'Carrie' is how unforgettable it is,after all these years it's still loved and still watched frequently.",Null,0,1,29 January 2004
The Queen," just a little to hyped.
","SPOILERS:It seems everyone in the world thought this movie was extraordinary except myself and the person I saw this with. I don't think this was a terrible movie but I DID think it was really really over rated and there was a bit to much hype about it. I was very disappointed with the Queen and here are the reasons why I didn't think it was much above average.There was a television movie feel about it. I'm not sure just what I was expecting but this felt very much at times like a TV movie. It also seemed like so much of The Queen was less about Lady Diana or The Queen then about Tony Blair. I expected the film to open with the day Lady Diana was killed only it didn't. This seemed, at times, more Blaire's story then Diana's or The Queen's. And a lot of the movie just wasn't very interesting frankly. It didn't hook me in or the person I saw this with.I also felt it was a bit to talky. The music in the film was enthralling so to bad it wasn't used enough. I generally like talky films but with this one, it was just TO talky. So many scenes went on and on about the same thing. And that would have been fine if I felt I was watching The Royal Family but I didn't. I didn't feel like I was watching the royal family. With the exception of Helen Mirron who is always extraordinary, nobody really jumped out at me and I never felt the performers were the people they were playing.The actor who played Charles didn't even look much like him. Sometimes it just didn't seem authentic. I did enjoy Mirron as the queen but as far as an Oscar goes I will be happy if she wins because I always like her work but I'd still give it to Judy Dench for 'Notes On A Scandel'. Her character still haunted me for days after I saw the film. With The Queen, it really didn't stay with me afterward. Still, the best thing about the movie by far was Mirron who is definitely an amazing actress.Also the movie moved very slowly and there wasn't a lot of intensity about much of it and there should have been. Sometimes I felt Diana was a backdrop to the relationship between Blair and the Queen. Perhaps I didn't fully understand what this was going to be about. But the movie just wasn't as powerful as I imagined it to be from the previews.This all being said, I can understand why it's up for an Oscar because it does have Mirron and it seems like the kind of film that would be nominated. But for me this is a 5 or 6 and although I'd watch it again if someone I know wanted to see it, I will admit it would be very hard for me to get through it a second time as It wasn't exactly easy the first time. There are a lot of positive comments on this movie, way more then negative ones so perhaps I missed a few things and just didn't get it but this was a let down and just about average for me.",6,10,17,11 February 2007
Shrek," Deserves to be in best TWENTY movies of all time!
","IF YOU HAVEN'T SEEN THIS RENT IT AT ONCE. Shrek is one of my alltime FAVORITE movies. It was one of those things where I didn't want to see it and a friend just finnaly sat me down and made me watch it! Then I saw it again the next day.....This movie will pull at your heartstrings. I can't think of THAT many movies I was that stunned by. Don't go into this expecting just another animated movie because it isn't. Shrek is going to be a part of history.
I could go into what this movie's about(friendship, love, kindness and vulnerability etc ) but none of that would capture the essense of this enchanting treasure. The day after I unwillingly watched it, I was so blown away I showed it to someone else who was even more anti-shreck then I had been and THEY loved it! Shrek is the best animated movie ever created and one of the best all time movies ever created.",10,2,4,18 November 2003
The Silence of the Lambs," Wonderful!
","I'll probebly have the shortest review on the imdb message board for this movie. what's to say? It's all been said, the film is a modern day classic-the ultimate in crime dramas/psychological thrillers etc etc-it puts other thrillers like 'kiss the girls' to shame.I don't think this was overtated, I know few people who, even if they can't sit through it don't at least have a high level of respect for this movie. Hopquins and Foster just made this superb, their interaction on screen was fascinating-just fascinating-the ultimate in the cat and mouse and this movie besides being the ultimate in suspence was also strangely touching.I almost didn't see this, I was told it was so difficult to sit though but it really wasn't. I haven't seen part 2 or 3, I don't want to-nothing could possibly measure up and Jodie Foster probebly knew this after all we don't see her in the sequel.To wind up, this isn't just a good film, it's superb.And the academy knew it to, I just wish they hadn't made a sequel.",10,1,1,16 November 2003
Vanilla Sky," Wins the prize for 'most completely bizarre movie'.
","SPOILERS THROUGHOUT!!OK-I was really looking forward to Vanilla Sky. It looked interesting in the previews though I went expecting more of a 'final analysis' type of thing. What I got was something else altogether.This maybe the only movie that I walked out of as confused as when I walked in. The movie made absolutely no sense from start to finish. Yeah, I grasp the general concept but..I've always said there's unrealistic and then there's over the top. (Then there's another category all together-over the top multiplied by six. I think that's where Vanilla Sky is.)Anyway-the final plot was so unrealistic in certain areas and left so many questions unanswered it was almost embarrassing, not to mention unbelievable.This movie really plays games with your head. Just when you think you've got it figured out(the plot, not which girl Tom Cruise is making love to)it morphs into something else entirely. I understand plot twists, I favor movies with plot twists. But vanilla sky is more then a movie with plot twists, it's one long twister.There are so MANY plot twists you can't relax enough to figure out what's going on minute to minute and enjoy the movie. That takes away a lot of the movie's overall power.I think this movie could have been really terrible had it not been for the incredible cast who for some reason decided to do this(sc-fi, for lack of a better term.) Had the movie not been done with skilled actors/actresses like Cruz, Cruise and Diez this could have been not just bad but a joke. In reality though these performers are so incredibly talented they keep you glued to the screen in spite of all the movie's obvious flaws. I think that says a lot more about their acting ability then the quality of the movie.I hate when I see a movie that seems like it could have been done so much better. The question I have is why were so many questions unanswered in this movie? I'd like to know because despite everything I (somewhat) enjoyed this movie.",6,0,1,22 August 2003
Bruce Almighty," As good as I expected it to be, maybe even better.
","Some people might Think I'm crazy for giving this a 9 of 10, but I thought it was great as both a comedy and a sweet, involving story.I had seen the previews for this and couldn't wait to see the movie. I was afraid that the movie wouldn't live up to the previews(something that happens QUITE frequently in movie land.) Boy was I wrong!This was very enjoyable from start to finish. The movie is very moving and funny and also manages to make a quiet statement about not taking what you have in life for granted and being happy with yourself and your choices.Some people may consider Bruce Almighty corny but I thought it was done very well and managed to make it's point without coming across as preachy.What also surprised me was how much I enjoyed Jim Carey's performance. I had seen some of his other work and couldn't say I was very impressed but he was very good in this. Maybe it's because, for the first time I felt rather then just being very in your face funny he was actually ACTING-and he proved himself to be a pretty good actor. Anniston to did a surprisingly sweet performance as Bruce's girlfriend and Morgan was PEREFECTLY cast as God.This was a movie that had me laughing SO hard but crying too-beautifully done without being at all overdone Bruce Almighty is a perfect movie choice. 9 of 10.",9,0,1,28 August 2003
Before Sunrise," a movie about innocence
","SPOILERS THROUGH: I'll join the large amount of fans of this film in commenting how outstanding it was. I had heard about this movie for so long. Although I've yet to see the second part, I loved this movie and thought it was an extremely well done, thoughtful film. The characters of Jesse and Celine were developed beautifully and the whole movie had a sweetness about it in general. It's a beautiful film and one that any major film buff should see.One might not imagine that two people walking around just having random conversations about..well..everything, could be all that interesting. But it is. This movie struck Me as being about innocence. That and connection. It sometimes seems that the older one gets the more difficult it is to really connect in the way one can when their young. This movie really brings home how great it is to just meet someone who gets and understands you immediately. It's about the mental click where so many movies are concentrated on the physical click. It develops the relationship flawlessly and gets you involved in the characters' lives.It also may make one reminiscent for times gone by. Connections like the one Jesse and Celine share, that almost effortless click, are few and far between and when they do come, they are precious. It's good to see a movie that's light on dramatics and special effects but deep on introspection and dialog. It's a very lovely film and one that really shouldn't be missed.",9,2,4,5 November 2006
Signs," Powerful and moving yet strangely unenjoyable movie watching
","Signs is a movie that makes you think. What you think the movie is going to be about is deceptive. I watched it just recently and came away confused about my feelings on it. On one hand, this is a powerful and forceful movie. It is very well acted and thought provoking. The cinematography is wonderful considering how low budget it was. However, it is a tough movie to enjoy. I freely admit I did not enjoy Signs at all, in fact I nearly walked out. Yet it wasn't necessarily a bad movie just not for everybody.One possible negative is the atmosphere. I'm big on movies that are atmospheric. With Signs, there is atmosphere from the beginning. Yet from the first five minutes of the movie, what was interesting to me, is that the movie used atmosphere less as a backdrop to the movie itself, rather the atmosphere WAS the movie. The atmosphere didn't quietly sneak up on you, it hurled itself at you full force from the first few minutes. Rippling cornfields. Dogs barking. strange sounds. etc etc. There was no buildup at all, it just came at you right away. One could tell immediately that this movie was gonna be a bit odd.The dialogue had a muted quality that actually went with the story perfectly but made the movie unfortunately a bit tedious. I will say that the first forty minutes of signs were, for me, almost unwatchable. The movie does pick up after that, as the tone is gradually altered and insite is gained into the main characters. But it's a long forty minutes.Signs is a movie that's impossible to pick on because it's impact is so intense toward the end if one succeeds in following it to the end, you won't turn it off untouched. There are certain scenes that will literally take hold of you and I credit Mel Gibson for a lot of that, he was amazing in this.There is a certain scene that I won't give away but he engages in a dialogue with God, the pain and sense of loss his character conveys is Oscar worthy and may leave you a bit shaken-if you get that far.Unfortunately, because of the oddness of the movie and the fact that it's very difficult to get into for a large part of it, it may lose certain people before they have a chance to get swept into it. I watched it with a group of people one of whom walked out and I almost did. At the end I was not sure if I was glad or not to have seen it through.In closing, Signs is a movie Guaranteed to inspire debate-(just look at the varying opinions on this board). It is intense. Gritty. Powerful. And moving. Enjoyable? Not at all. But maybe it wasn't supposed to be, this is not exactly a movie that one could possibly call commercial. Signs is a movie I perhaps respect the heck out of more then like in any way. I simply cannot give it a rating either. If I were rating it on personal enjoyment my rating would be pretty low. If I were rating it on edginess and power it would be much higher. Maybe those intrigued by a movie such as this, who haven't seen it should give it a try and judge for themselves.",Null,0,2,11 July 2004
The Sixth Sense," Strikes just the right balance.
","This was such a good movie. Sixth Sense was not just scary, but engrossing, well written and earned every drop of praise it got. Saw it around the time as 'Blair Witch' and though Blair is good(I gave it a 7), Sixth Sense really was, more then good, it was superb and my vote's a 9 of 10. Besides being creepy the movie itself is almost bewitching, it strikes just the right balance between drama and psychological thriller.SPOILERS: What an acting job from Bruce Willis. The 'twist' to the movie was surely just that-didn't even see it coming. What is really cool about Sixth Sense and one of the things that makes it an excellent movie, is that it can still be watched after you've seen it once-even knowing what the 'twist' is.This was one of my favorite movies to come out around this time period, it is absolutely unique. Not many movies around anymore that can both scare and thrill at this level-EXCELLENT!!",9,0,0,19 August 2003
The Truman Show," a movie so unique one wonders how it got made.
","SPOILERS THROUGHOUT:Truman Show is without a doubt Carey's best work. I did not have the pleasure of seeing this until this year, where after seeing Bruce Almighty and becoming somewhat of a Jim Carey fan, I made an effort to watch more of his movies. Truman Show is an instant classic in all the right ways, it's a smart, well acted, somewhat eerie, and utterly unique masterpiece. It also gets better the more you watch it.I don't happen to like the genre of science fiction and nobody could deny Truman Show's got a bit of sci fi but I don't think it really falls under any one genre. What's really scary is the idea-this concept-is not so out there anymore, in today's times, that one could completely rule out that this could ever happen. It's creepy, very much so, in the way that The Original Stepford Wives is but more so in a way, and I wonder about what would be said about the movie had it been released currently, instead of the late 90's when reality TV was just starting to cause a ripple.I first started changing my thoughts on Carey after Bruce Almighty, a great movie (and one that is a lot more thought provoking then many give it credit for.) But as good as he was in that, he simply shines in Truman, everyone does, I loved Laura Linney as Truman's annoying, cold on screen wife Meryl. I've seen many of Linney's movies, this is one of her best.I'd advise people who haven't seen Truman Show to see it more then once-the first time I saw it, I thought it was about an 8 or 9, it grows on you and it's the kind of movie you want to see again as soon as it ends. There are a few frustrating things to be sure, I wish it had not ended so ambiguously, I'd have liked to see more of Truman's life after leaving the set, his relationship with Sylvia and what the other characters were feeling gone into a bit more. Also the audience. Was Truman an instant celebrity when he left or was he quickly forgotten in favor of the next flavor of the month by his devoted audience as is a bit inferred? Truman Show, unlike about 95 percent of movies made, does seem like a sequel could be made, although with how bad most sequels are I'd be a bit wary. Still, any flaws are not enough to prevent a 10 of 10 rating from me, you could be watching this movie for the 50th time and it still seems like it would inspire the same reaction.",10,14,20,14 March 2005
Shall We Dance," musical enchantment
","This movie was wonderful. Please, if you are reading This and have Not seen it-go! Right now. A wonderful and exhilarating movie, strongly underrated.This movie is about finding yourself through the power of dance. It is beautifully filmed, sweetly sentimental without at all being maudlin and the dance scenes are equisite. Now if one is not a fan of movies that center on dancing they may not like this but I think all should give it a chance as it will probably charm you. There is One dance sequence between Gear and Lopez that will take your breath away.The movie is an ode to the power of dancing and you do not have to be a fan of ballroom dancing to easily love this movie. I had a more enjoyable time watching this on the big screen then almost any film I've yet seen in 2004. Even JLO who I've never been particularly impressed by, was great here as the fragile dance instructor. Gear and Sarandon deliver as always but it is the quirky supporting cast I recommend you watch for. This movie is not by the numbers-you will not always be able to guess what is gonna happen. It is funny, touching, completely different from other films out there now, contains great dance sequences and virtually all it's characters are humanized in a way that will be relateable to almost everyone. I give this an 8.5 as a whole but a 10 of 10 for pure enjoyment purposes. Watching this is absolutely exhilarating and movies like this should be made more often.",8,0,1,24 October 2004
Honey," Honey it's not bad.
","SPOILERS THROUGHOUT: I really didn't think Honey was that bad. As far as sunny predictability, yeah it's all that and then some, but as far as being dreadful it isn't. While Honey may seem to predictable, to contrived, and to by the numbers sunshiny, it isn't a bad way to pass some time though it's by no means a must see.I did enjoy Jessica Alba's performance as Honey though she seemed almost to good to be true at times. While the movie was clearly designed to be Hollywood feel good in the way it went about things, the movie was at times very much fun to watch as well as being very well paced and interesting despite it's formula feel. I liked it a bit more then Coyote Ugly or even Flashdance in a way. Sometimes it's fun just to watch a relaxing feel good movie-and one thing you know about Honey is that even when negativity is introduced, things wont stay negative for long-not in this movie's world.There really wouldn't have been a way to make this movie less predictable I don't think, because it's plot almost demands a happy by the book ending. I wouldn't call this a great movie but would give it a 6.5(wish we could rate by .5's here on IMDb). It isn't going to win any awards but there isn't anything that stands out about it to be dreadful and it's a cute, uplifting little movie. This is rated on here a 3 or 4 and that really is a little Harsh. My vote is 6.5.",6,1,2,1 August 2005
Click," I get the message of Click and appreciate it, but I still didn't like the movie.
","SPOILERS THROUGH: Click was a movie I had wanted to see since I first heard About it and only recently had a chance to watch it. I unfortunately was quite disappointed although I didn't find it nearly as bad as many have said. This wasn't a 1 or a 2 but I Still was let down and wish I had liked it more.First the good. Adam Sandler was-well-Adam Sander. I happen to be a fan and found him good as he always is. The key to Sandler's charm is that he's so darn likable one can never really dislike him even when he does dislike able things. He still retains that trademark Adam Sandler goofy lovable quality. Here is no different.But Sandler is the main positive. The problem I had with Click is the movie tries to be both a comedy(in it's very early stages) and a serious drama and doesn't do either really that well. The comedy, what little there is of it, isn't very funny and doesn't come close to much of Sandler's other work. Somehow you'd think it would in a movie with such a premise as this but the comedy doesn't work all that well.But then there's the drama. OK-I like serious movies-a lot. But this movie defines the term 'bait and switch.' The reason I knew it would be as heavy as it was is because I'd heard about it. But I really think the movie should have bean marketed in a different way. I'm sure there were a lot of young kids who went into it thinking it was going to be a light Sandler comedy and I think it would be nice if people knew what they were getting.Click's message is a stinging and poignant one and I was very moved by the movie but also felt it went on way to long and the message which is an important one, was pushed and pushed until it became way to much. Watching this movie is an exhausting experience. Yes The message is a good one but Just because a movie is moving and has a good message doesn't mean that it's a perfect movie. I really felt Click, as unusual and as moving as it is, had a lot lacking.Kate Beckinsale was not given a lot to do with her part which is a shame since she's such talented actress. Starting the movie as a kooky, almost obnoxious comedy where it doesn't seem to be taking itself all that seriously at times, and then morphing it into a movie so sad it could almost put 'Ordinary people' to shame doesn't work for me. I think the movie should have played as either a silly comedy only or a serious drama only.And it went on forever. This is one of those movies where it didn't seem like it was ever going to end. I really like the premise and message of the movie, not to mention the editing which was tremendously creative but I didn't like the movie itself at all. In spite of that fact would still give it an average rating for Sandler, the creative aspect and the message itself.The dramatic aspects of Click will stay with you and the message, as mentioned is a good and very true one. I wonder if they will do a click two. I still like Bruce Almighty, which this reminded me of , much better even though it was lighter because I felt it flowed better and did the comedy better as well. Click's a movie that isn't for everybody but that one should know what their getting before they watch it. My vote's 5.",5,0,1,9 December 2006
Interview with the Vampire: The Vampire Chronicles," A movie to see for the acting, costumes and special effects
","Not being a fan of vampire movies, I didn't love tihs but I actually liked it a bit more then I expected to. I would imagine to really love this movie one has to be a sort of vampire movie fan to begin with and though I am not NOT against these types of movies I'm not into them either-if that makes ANY sense at all. Basically, this is a movie to see for these reasons: the costumes and atmosphere, special effects and very importantly the great acting-and I do mean great. Pitt and Cruise are both fabulous and unrecgnizable-both give their careeres a very large range with these performances.I also think this is a movie best seen in a group-when I saw it it was with a large group of people and we were almost kicked out of the theatre for talking so much-it's that type of movie. Definetly more of a fun movie to see then a deep memorable one.My rating is 7 of 10.",7,2,3,13 November 2003
The Breakfast Club," Stands up as just a genuinely GOOD movie.
","I like all types of movies but growing up of coarse I loved the teen movies that all kids my age watched. As I got older many of these movies remained timeless and this is one of them. A must see for any kid though I would really say a must see for ANYBODY.What kid growing up didn't identify with this movie, this movie was for any 'type' of kid because that was the movie's central theme-all 'types' coming together. I'd go so far as to call Breakfast Club a classic, it's heartwarming, funny, and completely original. The movie differs from teen comedies (that are just as good)in one major way, it manages to be witty, create unforgettable characters while still getting a message across, somehow through all this completely avoiding falling into cheeziness.There will always be those teen classics that stand proud as being truly just GOOD movies-and Breakfast Club is about as good as it gets.",9,2,4,6 September 2003
The Wedding Singer," The 80's live on in Wedding Singer !
","Yes I love The Wedding Singer. In fact it ranks among my favorite movies ever. I love this not so much for the story line, although Sandler and Barrymore are adorable together in this but rather the hysterical return to life in the 80's. Since I am a child of the 80's(and retain many a fond memory of that time period) every time I watch this movie it brings me back. This movie is best watched among a group of your closest 80's friends. It is a comedy classic and my only beef with it is it makes me miss the 80's so much! Basically, I love this movie! Nothing more nothing less. Wedding Singer is among my top 20 favorite movies ever-one of the best comedies and GREAT music as well! The best of the eighties music(and I do count 'you spin me round' as one of them!) This movie pays tribute to a great time period and retains a place in my heart as both sweet/sentimental and roll on the floor funny. Watch it if you haven't, you will be hysterical. Oh man do I miss the 80's!!!!",10,7,13,3 December 2003
The Pursuit of Happyness," If there was an Oscar for most inspirational.....
","SPOILERS:I really enjoyed this movie and found it to be a very moving, inspirational tale, especially since it is based on a true story. This is one of the better pictures I've seen this year and I would definitely recommend it.I could see where some would not like this because there are a lot of very painful, bitter moments but the story is more then just interesting, it's fascinating and it just kind of hooks you in. The real Chris Gardner must be quite a guy. The father and son, played by Will and Jaden Smith, put in excellent performances and one becomes immersed in their story or at least I did. It's an unusual movie, quite different then anything I've seen this year.As mentioned, there are many a morose moment in this and patience is needed to get to the high point of the movie which comes very close to the end. Actually, My biggest criticism would be that moment which, although wonderful, is way to short and feels to hurried. I also found the believability aspect tested when Chris kept running into the same people on the street but that was the only aspect I felt didn't ring quite true. I would also have liked to know more about Linda, played by Thandie Newton. But despite those things the movie is very good. It flows well and the narration which could have been awful, fits the movie so well, I can't imagine the film without it. I felt the movie pulls one into the story from the very beginning. It's fascinating to watch Chris fight for the job and to see how the brokers warm to him.I think this was a heartwarming intelligent movie, extremely well written and worth seeing. It does help to know the story ahead of time. Although it's sometimes good to come into a movie knowing nothing, in this case, so much of the movie is so sad, that if you know it's going to have a happy ending, it's probably easier to get through. I would definitely recommend this movie.",8,1,2,7 January 2007
Jurassic Park," cute to see dinosaurs and that's about it.
","It's so funny how different peoples' tastes are. When this movie first came out I went and saw it and my feelings haven't changed on it through the years. I basically moderately enjoyed it while I was watching it and then didn't think much about it. It didn't really stay with me.The main thing I liked about the movie is of coarse the amazing special effects. But in terms of the story itself I did not get to involved. Once the awe of the concept wore off, That was it. But perhaps that's because I'm not terribly into science fiction pictures anyway.I have certain friends who consider this a masterpiece. I will admit the special effects were amazing but I wouldn't consider it as a masterpiece, though it was definitely an extravaganza. And it is worth seeing for the rare Few who may not have seen it, particularly people who maybe into this type of flick.I'd give this about a 10 for the special effects (seeing dinosaurs running around was kind of cool) but I'd rate it only about a 5 or 6 or so for level of interest. As mentioned, I'm not generally into science fictions and didn't find this scary. Nor did I see the sequel. Cute to see once and that's about all.",5,3,13,21 December 2003

Rock Star," Do you want the gig then?
","What to say about a movie like Rock Star? A lot actually! This is the type of movie that is almost tailer made for the critics to slam. It is also a movie I, as a MAJOR Hard Rock fan enjoyed-no-loved actually-while all the while being very consciously aware of its many flaws and that the movie, while a decent effort in some respects missed the chance it had to escape into greatness and become a rock movie classic. Oh well....I loved this movie-and would see it again and again-but I know that's purely based on my own personal tastes-Rock Star is a movie that will appeal to anyone who has experienced elements of the rock or hard rock lifestyle and wants to go down the road to nostalgia. It was a great time for metal heads. And it's nice to have a movie that effectively captures that(long forgot by many non-rock fans.) time effectively, as I think that Rock Star has done. That is one of the film's strengths, the concert footage. You will feel like your right there with them and how could any hard rock fan not love that? As far as setting the atmosphere Rock Star gets a 10 of 10. It also gets a 10 of 10 for pure entertainment. If you want a movie to just let yourself go and free flow into some great memories of good times past, then this is the movie for you. It is also the reason why I loved this movie so.But it isn't a great movie. I understand that and were it my actual job to review movies professionally, I'd probably have to be a bit hard on this one. The problem with Rock star is the character development.What is wrong with the character development is this, there isn't any. None. The movie has certain scenes-few and far between but they ARE there-that DO touch on greatness:WARNING BRIEF SCENE SPOILERS: 3 examples- 1)when Izzy makes his debut on stage(including the fall he takes)2)The first 'after show' party with Emily(Anniston and Izzy.)3)Backtracking a little-In the beginning when the original lead singer is casually dismissed(fired)-the whole 'business as usual' tone sets the stage for what's to come. It's played very effectively.But the problem is, nothing ever does come. There is little to no character development of anyone in this movie, peoples' persona's are merely touched on, but never fully explored. I don't think that's the fault of the actors/actresses,particularly Anniston who tries hard, they just are not given much to work with. It's just that the script was weak and lacked the ability to go beyond the 'formula' feel into true movie depth. Rock star was so sugarcoated at times(including towards the end) it was almost ridiculous. And , though, those scenes I mentioned WERE outstanding and very believable, sadly much else in the movie wasn't.Another reviewer mentioned the lack of buildup towards the end and I agree but there was actually a lack of buildup about ANYTHING. WHY does Izzy leave at the end? Because he misses his girlfriend and the band won't let him write songs? It tests the limits of believability. And, frankly the end was just corny. Made no sense and had no reality to it at all.Watching this, it's almost like watching a movie where the makers of it said: OK, this happens here and then this happens and then this etc etc etc. By the end it's no longer a movie about a boy who's dream came true, it's just another thickly formulated love story. And you wonder why so much detail is left out....I hope I'm not being to hard on Rock Star because I truly loved it-but not for the right reasons. I would have liked to love this as a great movie about the highs and lows of rock fame. Instead I loved it for it's 80's period feel, the clothes, the hair, the lights, the life.... Although many others loved it to, I suspect most are people who lived the life of a rock fan, like I did or some who play. I'd have liked to see the movie cross over and just be respected for being a good, well told movie, instead of a cliché. I think, one of the problems was the length. I myself, hate over long films but this was one that really should have been longer, if a movie is done really right, the length is not even felt-there is just to much to the story for it to be as short as it was-that's one reason why there doesn't seem to be much development of either the story or the human beings portrayed in the movie.So-to wind down-this is a movie you can greatly get into- but not a great movie. See it for fun. See it for entertainment. See it to go back to that great, great space in time when metal wasn't just a part of life, it WAS life-and for those non rock fans-see it to get a little glimpse into a life that meant and still means so much to so many of us.",8,7,12,7 March 2004
High Fidelity," Underrated
","This is a movie that I saw kind of accidentally but was very impressed by. I found it touching, funny and just very good-why is it so little known? It didn't remind me of 'reality bites' as other people have stated, because this was much less 'hollywood' then that. I kind of was reminded of 'clerks' in an odd way. There were definite similarities and the characters had an excellent element of realism that I'm sure is the main appeal of the movie, many could view this and found parts of themselves, their relationships, and their friends in many of the characters. Add some great music and a record store setting to the mix and a great cast, and you've got all the ingredients for a really good picture.I didn't love when I first saw it, though I definitely liked it a lot. It seems the type of movie to definitely grow on you, when I see it a second time I have the feeling the movie will jump a couple of points. I have yet to see a John Cussac movie I don't like, he's as good here as he is in everything else he does. Movie definitely recommended for viewing.",8,0,1,28 February 2004
The Island," definitely not boring but not my kind of movie.
","SPOILERS THROUGH:I was strongly reminded of 'Logan's Run' when watching this, only this wasn't nearly as good. The Island certainly isn't dull at all but on the whole this was not for me. It's the kind of movie I could see why somebody else would adore but just wasn't my type of thing.The premise was creepy and the movie absorbing but the movie was so bizarre it was very difficult to enjoy. The futuristic atmosphere gets to you after awhile and because of the subject matter, it is rather difficult to watch. There was also to much violence. As for the action scenes they jump out at you and sure were larger then life but I also felt the movie should not necessarily have been so geared toward the action. For what they were they are well done but I would have preferred that there weren't so much action because that took away from the storyline and took the movie to being almost an action flick rather then a creepy drama/science fiction.Although The Island does keep one watching I alternated between being fascinated by the movie and finding elements of it almost annoying. I am glad this had a happy ending as I admit I did not think it would, but I did find the ending to abrupt and rather unbelievable. I would have liked more explained and it just seemed kind of flat after the whole big buildup. I would have liked to see a more powerful ending like Johanson and Mcgreggor actually getting on the news with this story. I just felt it ended to abruptly.One strong point though, is that it was extremely well acted however and Mcgregor in particular was excellent. I could see where this could have been a masterpiece but I didn't think it really was. The only way I could see watching it again, is perhaps, to pick up on things not picked up in the first viewing. (It seems like the type of movie one should see more then once.) But being that I did not find this very enjoyable, I'm not sure I would see it again. In closing, I wouldn't really recommend it though I didn't think it was absolutely dreadful either. (I know people who absolutely hate this.) I wouldn't say I hated it because as mentioned, it's tremendously absorbing, and very well acted. But there's to much violence, to much action, to much not explained, and to little slow quiet drama. I'd rate this around average.",5,0,1,2 September 2006
The Godfather," forgive me.
","This is the number 1 movie of all time-according to IMDB. This is a film that is as close to being perfect as a film can be-according to many. So-I am going to admit it straight out here-I have NEVER-I repeat-NEVER been able to get into the godfather-I feel almost guilty saying it-but it is the truth-This is considered to be the best of the best. But I didn't feel any of the fascination that many others did.I have tried(unsuccessfully) to watch this from start to finish and it never works-ever. I always turn it off. I want to like this because of how amazing it is supposed to be. I have family members that watch it over and over and over again. But not I. I just-it just did not compute. Ever.I suppose there are those films considered masterpieces that for some reason or other one just can't like. That is how this is for me. I could not appreciate the dialogue, very slow pace, I never got into the character studies, to much violence and I would always get an odd restless feeling. But I guess everyone has a movie or two like that where they just don't get it. This is mine.I really really wanted to like this film. If I ever do, I'll come back on and post an apology.",Null,2,6,16 March 2004
