The Twilight Saga: Breaking Dawn - Part 1," Two Eye-rolls Way Up!
","...(Shaking head, muttering)... It's definitely not as bad as some reviewers say it is, but it's no magical masterpiece.I'm now reflecting on the impossibly gooey cheese that is Breaking Dawn. It begs you to cringe with over-the-top theatrics, uncomfortable pauses, and more awkward moments than all the other Twilight films combined. You'll find yourself cringing and/or laughing hysterically at times. The film tries hard to evoke emotion from its audience, too hard. Try too hard at something, and you're bound to look silly. I do not blame the actors for this, It falls squarely upon the writer. In fact, it might not be praise, but the acting is significantly better in this film than the others in this saga. Some people thrive on that feeling and love the falsetto version of cheesy drama. They're the people who subscribe to Soap Digest and have their Tivo's programmed to record their beloved Soap everyday. The further the Twilight saga progresses, the more it embraces the type of audience I just described, and alienates the rest of us.The story is so bizarre and illogical at times, it crosses the line from the fantasy-Romance genre into bad Sci-Fi type storytelling. That's a shame. But at least the movie still moves along telling its story...albeit slowly.Poor Jacob. The humiliation the poor guy is forced to suffer never ends! He must be a dedicated masochist. However, the emotional torment he continuously endures is rivaled by the physical pain Bella suffers in this film. She is put through the ringer, but you can't really feel sorry for her. She continues the tradition of making the men in her life agonize.I did enjoy some of the scenery in the film, the sets are very appealing and appropriate for the story, it maintains a good atmosphere. The musical score is also appropriate, not distracting, it does what it's meant to do.The Robot-like voices in the wolf argument scene are hardly comprehensible. I've had more success translating Korean rap songs. I could have stood for a more in-depth look into the wolf packs world, and seen more action from them. But alas, very little material concerning the pack is presented. The film is strongly fixated on Bella and Edwards ordeal.For the Twi-hards: you wont regret going to the theater and shelling out the cash to see this one. For others, with milder interest in the Twilight franchise, you'd be equally as pleased just to wait for the DVD.",Null,16,31,19 November 2011
Paranormal Activity," Dangerously good, a classic!
","I am a cinema-phile. I currently own over 600 films and constantly add more. Most of My collection is comedy and horror. I'd consider Myself a horror queen. If you've seen it, chances are, so have I. I absolutely *refuse* to own or play this film in My home for fear that it may attract evil spirits into My residence. I cannot watch this film and not feel that evil is at work here. Perhaps it is because I actually lived in a house plagued by evil spirits for a while, perhaps I'm reverting to Christian beliefs I once adhered to long ago. This movie definitely struck a cord with Me. A film that powerful definitely deserves respect and My admiration. It is a remarkably effective low budget film documenting a supposed demon that haunts a couple. It's so good, it's scary! Definitely watch, not at your house though!",9,0,1,26 August 2012
Mama," Mama will have you calling for your Mama.
","I went to watch this film in a theater and had very high expectations, due to the director and producer. I was not disappointed. The storyline was intriguing, but I expected more. Perhaps the DC on Blu-ray will have more substance. I look forward to it. I found the antagonist (mama) pitiable. Obviously she was mentally challenged, but loved her child - and any child- long after her demise. As a ghost, she managed to spare an innocent child's life, and helped raise 2 girls who were left alone in the wilderness. She was a good mama, but as movie-goers will see, she's also a very jealous one. After the 2 girls are rescued, they go to live with their biological uncle and his free-spirited girlfriend. They are given a large house and must make the best of things as a family. Soon the couple learns that the girls did not come back alone.",6,0,1,31 January 2013
Mother!," You'll love it or hate it
","***SPOILERS***This is the sort of film that will not resonate well with general audiences. It's a major allegory. There is a great deal of symbolism and some shocking scenes.It's disheveled, bizarre, heavily message-laden, and at times unbearably cruel. Simply put, it's crazier than a bag full of wet feral cats.If you're easily offended or dislike the type of material I described , I suggest you remove the lug wrench from your posterior orifice and go watch 'My Little Pony' instead. There's a husband, he's an aloof, day-dreaming, revered poet struggling with writer's block. He has a certain disconnection from his wife. His wife is younger, beautiful, creative and capable. She's nurturing and attentive. The couple live alone in a large, lovely country estate. The house had previously been destroyed by fire and mother is working very hard to restore the home. Curiosities abound as she does home repairs. She wants to reconnect with her husband, see his writing succeed, and have a child.A traveling man mistakes the home for a B&B, but mother's husband openly welcomes the guest. It turns out that he didn't make a mistake. The man (Adam) was dying and he desperately wanted to meet his idol, the poet. The man complains of abdominal pain (rib) and the next day his wife arrives (Eve). The man's wife (Eve) is obnoxious and meddling. She accidentally breaks the one item in the home that she was told not to touch: a crystal-like stone that the husband recovered from the ashes of his home (the Apple of knowledge/free will). The husband is devastated by this and furious for a while, yet he continues to host his guests. The couple is later visited by their quarreling sons. They are fighting over their father's inheritance (old testament, Cain and Abel). One son kills the other in the home, but mother is unable to remove the bloodstain. It will not vanish (evil/violence), it has permeated the wooden floor.Mother and husband argue yet end up having intercourse. The moment she awakes she ridiculously announces that she's pregnant. They are both overjoyed and the husband is suddenly inspired to write the most remarkable poem ever written. It's soon published for the world to read.The last two-thirds of mother! is insensible and difficult to watch at times. Mother is heavily pregnant and heart-breakingly helpless to stop the flood of intruders who have come to praise or show their repulsion with the husband/poet. Hell breaks loose. Mother is unable to restore order and protect her beloved home. Her husband seems oblivious. There's total chaos as the house is overrun by reckless people from all walks of life. The peaceful, beautiful house that was lovingly restored by mother is in shambles. The house had once lived and breathed, as though the house and mother were one entity. Her husband nonchalantly forgives the destructive trespassers and revels in their worship of him instead. He was mesmerized by his 'fans' admiration and praise and ignored their terribly rotten behavior. He could have stopped the madness but chose to ignore it instead. mother! is certainly not for everyone. Director Aronofsky plainly said in an interview that he doesn't care whether viewers love it or hate it, he's just pleased that viewers have strong reactions. Reviewers who claim that the film was written in just 5 days are mistaken. Only the first draft was completed in 5 days. It took much longer for the final script to be completed. It's strongly religious, emulating various biblical figures and events while conveying a critical message about our abuse of our planet/environment. If you do not have a good understanding of the bible/Christianity then you will be hopelessly confused. On the other hand, those with a strong Christian understanding and faith may feel insulted. I appreciate Aronofsky's bold and brazen vision. I watched the movie a second time and it will be a fine addition to my massive collection. A good film will always leave the viewer with something; it could be a song, a joke, paranoia, arousal, curiosity, anger or introspection. The latter two can be attributed to mother! It will make you think. *** For those of you wondering what the yellow powder mother consumes is...it is POLLEN. Mother obviously represents Mother Nature. She stays indoors at all times though, never outdoors. Pollen is flora seeds, they're critical to the reproduction of living things. When mother woke one morning and proclaimed her pregnancy, she threw away the pollen.",10,1,7,21 October 2017
Law Abiding Citizen," Inspiring
","Any film which inspires a person to do the right thing or to try to make amends for an injustice, is a beautiful thing! People love, and some people even *need* a strong vengeance tale. Law abiding citizen is certainly a fine one. I even referred to it in My real life when I was dealing with a detective who had failed to pursue appropriately (or at least notify Me of pursuit of) a person who attacked and hurt Me even though they had an admission and all the relevant information to do so.I believe that when the justice system fails, it becomes conscientious citizens responsibility to pursue justice instead. Too many persons guilty of terrible crimes against other people are walking free because of an ineffective judicial system full of irrational technicalities and irrelevant loopholes. So when justice isn't served by the system, the responsibility falls upon the people. Justice is 'an eye for an eye' whenever such is possible and reasonable. But it must not ever involve harming an innocent party.In Law Abiding Citizen, these 'rules' are pretty well adhered to, though there is a sense of impending harm that looms over certain innocent parties though. I believe the film ought to be viewed by those studying sociology and psychology to trigger discussions on the subject, because it is very real. The pursuit of justice is performed by an incredibly resourceful genius who has long planned every move before it happens. Nothing performed by our vigilante is random, every move has been plotted precisely. And the perpetrator is clear, though there's no clear explanation as to how it occurs while a man is in intensive prison lock-down. There's an exceedingly interesting, touching and creative script. The audience as perplexed as law enforcement is, in solving 'how does he do it? How was that even possible?'Acting is great, as are the sets, dialogue, sound and effects. I was a bit upset about the ending, but found that it was the only decent solution possible to the plot at hand. I highly recommend this film! It is a very satisfying movie that will capture your attention! Appropriate for individual viewers, couples, families with their children a subjectively mature 14 yr's or older, and for small gatherings of friends. Foul language is kept to a minimum, there are brief moments of implied drug use, brief innuendo of rape, and a quick shot of a nearly nude woman resting. The largest concern for parents or those with extremely uptight sensibilities will be the violence, though there isn't a gore factor.",9,0,0,1 April 2012
