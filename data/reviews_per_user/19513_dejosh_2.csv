United 93," Oh my God!
","I've seen thousands of films in my life, and this one is by far the most impressive experience of all. You will never forget United 93 again. You will feel the pain, the sorrow, the shock and you will never never forget!! This is the reason why the moving pictures were invented in the first place and I wish this film will be available for everyone for free! So that as many people as possible can experience this flight. But this is of course a utopia of the film-lover. So all you lovers and non-lovers out there; get this film, go to the cinema, rent it or even download it. I don't care how, but please please see this film and you will never, never, forget!!!!!!",9,1,3,23 August 2006
