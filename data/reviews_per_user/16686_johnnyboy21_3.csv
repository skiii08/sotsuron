The Blair Witch Project," The only film in the last five years to give me nightmares.
","Films, no matter how scary, have never bothered me so much. I was really looking forward to TBWP as I kept tabs on it's progress in the US. When I saw it I was disappointed. Not because it wasn't enjoyable or different, but because people were audibly saying things like 'this is s**t' and ' what a load of bol***ks'. Several people left too. The film for me was really interesting and I liked the fact it was made on a shoestring budget and did not conform to expectations. It didn't frighten me either. Then within two weeks of seeing it and continually talking about it with friends/family, I started having nightmares about it. Really vivid, creepy ones too. Enough to make me wake up in a sweat and enough to make me glance over my shoulder when i walked upstairs to bed at night. They wore off after about 3-4 weeks, but any film that has that sort of effect deserves recognition. I thought it was great.",8,0,1,18 May 2001
The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring," I love it when movies divide opinion
","First off, this was a great film. Production values were excellent (to make the Hobbits seem so small compared to the other characters was genius) the acting wasn't Oscar calibre, but then i never expected it to be and neither should anyone else. In terms of entertainment, the film gives you something you have probably never had: an enjoyable and involving fantasy film. The special effects were never intrusive, the cinematography excellent and the 'feel' of the movie was wonderful. It's been a while since i felt i was taken into another world. I never score films solely on their entertainment value, i try to take as much into account as possible. The thing i like above all is the way Jackson has taken a book written as an analogy for WWII in the 50s and has tweaked it just enough to keep faithful to the book, but scripted it for a 21st century audience. The movie deserves all it's praise and repeated viewings. I have seen it twice (both to full screenings over a week apart) and came out both times feeling excited and fulfilled. No one i know (most not movie fans) has disliked it. To read the divided opinion on the net says only one thing to me: some people have no taste in movies.",10,0,0,4 January 2002
The Mummy Returns," What a let-down.
","What was the hype about? $68million opening? Why? Occasionally fun and it always looks nice, but the acting and script were dire. The special effects, especially the Scorpion King in the finale were terrible. I have seen more impressive rendering on the PS2. The saving grace was the huge battle in the desert, which did surprise me with its scale, otherwise I felt pretty cheated. Hardly any Mummy, no Scorpion King, lacklustre action and only moments of excitement and cleverness. If I were you I'd wait for it to be released on DVD and hope they include tons of extras. Otherwise stick with the original.",6,0,0,23 May 2001
