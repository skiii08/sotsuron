Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," People will like anything with the Star Wars logo on it
","I was bored during the almost 2 hours and 20 minutes this movie lasted.  I enjoyed the parts everyone expected to see, the pod race and the light saber fight.It seems as if the rest of the movie was simply a 2 hr build up for a 20 minute action scene.If this movie was not a Star Wars movie, but a normal sci-fi movie, it wouldn't be getting such great comments from die-hard fans.  Which just proves that some people out there will like anything with the Star Wars logo on it, regardless of quality.",4,0,1,22 May 1999
