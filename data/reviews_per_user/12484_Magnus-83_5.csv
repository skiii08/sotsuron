The Ring," What a horror flick should be like
","As a great fan of horror movies, I feel that the future looks promising for this genre. During the last two years, there are two movies in particular that have made an impression on me, 'The Others' and 'The Ring'. What they have in common is the lack of excessive gore, something that otherwise seem to be the foundation of American horror. Instead, they are creepy and scary, ie they will terrify you, but they won't make you sick.The storyline of 'The Ring' in short: A young reporter investigates the events surrounding a strange videotape, where a few people have died a week after watching this tape. During her investigations, she watches the videotape, and immediately after receives a phonecall by someone, telling her that she have seven days left to live. This quickens up the pace a bit, and this reporter eventually uncovers what she believes to be the truth of this cursed tape - Case closed? No, there is a twist, you see... And that's about all I'm going to tell you, watch the movie if you like to know more. ;-)In difference to some of the other reviewers that consider this to be a crappy movie, my verdict is that it is one of the greatest horror movies I've seen in recent years. A simple reason to disagree with them is this - Each and everyone with an internet connection and an e-mail address can write a review here on IMDB, regardless of experience, knowledge and judgement, and I know that writing reviews is NOT easy, if you like to communicate anything more than your own opinions and personal interpretations. Some reviewers claim that every movie they've seen is either the lowest piece of crap they ever seen, or the greatest movie to ever hit the market, with a total disregard for the fact that there is quite a span between 'utter rubbish' and 'finest piece of work ever done'. It's hard to take that kind of shallowness seriously.Thus, I rate 'The Ring' as 8½ out of 10 - It's a great horror flick, but I don't think it's the best I have ever seen.Others have complained about 'The Ring' as being too much of a 6th Sense-ripoff, and claims that anyone who compares this movie to 'The 6th Sense' is doing the latter movie a great injustice. Well, on the contrary, in my opinion - 'The 6th Sense', although a good horror flick is far from as good as 'The Ring', as it relies more on blood and gore (all the ghosts you see are either decaying, covered in blood and gore or puking) than horror, in order to scare you. Unfortunately, blood and gore equals to horror to a good part of the American crowd, but I believe Europeans have a little more taste than that. Covering everything with ketchup is a very cheap trick, and it don't work on me. Otherwise, 'Black Hawk Down' would be the pinnacle of the horror genre. ;-)The bottom line is this: If you like to watch a great horror flick with a creepy mood, some unexpected twists and a good deal of mystery, this is the movie for you. If blood, gore and excessive use of sound effects is what you like, I'd recommend you to watch 'Pet Sematary', 'Night Flier', 'Terror on Elm Street' or some other splatter movie. ;-)'The Ring' is a horror movie, no more, no less.",9,1,1,2 April 2003
Troy," Well made
","I found the 2-DVD version of 'Troy' in the bargain bin at a local department store. Since it only cost me the equivalent to a few dollars, I decided to buy it. And I was not disappointed.Troy, as most of us know, depicts the Trojan War described in the Iliad.First of all, I would like to make one thing clear - Neither the Iliad nor this movie are in any way historical documents. The Iliad is an old fairytale, whereupon this movie is based. To seek rational explanations for this and that is a waste of time. Consider it for what it is and has always been, a great and very entertaining fairy tale, like the Lord of the Rings is of today.I'll proceed with the review. This movie is a 'slightly' condensed version of the epic itself. And of course with the necessary touches of hollywoodization added to it. For good or for worse. Being made into a Hollywood movie is usually either the best or the second worst - being made into a Disney cartoon is the worst - thing that could happen to a classic story like the Iliad. But Troy actually manages to end up somewhere in between, which I find rather unusual.As I wrote earlier, the story depicts the Trojan war, a result of the elopement or kidnapping of Helen of Sparta, by prince Paris of Troy. Troy was according to legends - as well as a few historians - a city located in what is today northwest Turkey. A city that by the standards of that day was considered large and prosperous. As well as damn near impregnable, with walls that couldn't be breached or scaled*. And since this war involved the greatest nations of the known world (at least according to the ancient Greeks), it was important enough to involve the gods themselves, who gladly gave their chosen champions a helping hand here and there, as well as taking every opportunity to back-stab their opponents when possible. Unfortunately, every divine or arcane intervention was left out of the Hollywood version, that is basically an action movie set in ancient times. The reason for this is that the filmmakers wanted to make an accurate historical movie, and thus they left out the parts that were considered a bit too unreal to fit in. I fail to see the logic in that decision, though, since the Iliad IS in fact simply that, a fairy tale. Not a historical document**. Didn't they realize that? This means that this movie sometimes feel very real, and since the acting is top notch, some might find it disturbing. Especially since most of us knows how it will end. Throw in a lot of blood and gore, and there you go.In my personal opinion, this was a really bad call. I mean, doesn't this movie really cry out for a sequel? No, I'm not thinking about 'Troy II - Paris revenge' *duh*, I mean the Odyssey. But how could you make a watchable movie out of the Odyssey without the fairy tale part? Remove that, and you end up with a boring and probable box office bomb about some guy getting really, really, really lost on his way home from Troy.The 'fairy tale' bits'n parts that were left out aren't the only changes the script writers made. Although many of the characters from the original Iliad are represented in this movie - and by very skilled actors as well - there are some changes that have been made to their personalities, traits and fates. Some, like me, might dislike that, but it's just a movie anyway. And as I wrote, it is a bit condensed, especially the time-frame. In the Iliad, the Greeks spent ten years outside the walls of Troy, until they finally realized that their current tactics weren't working, and that they should try something new. In the movie it is a matter of weeks. Even though the script writers and filmmakers have made a lot of changes*** to the story, Troy remains quite a watchable movie. Removing the fairy tale part and trying to make a historical movie was a mistake though, for that is what the Iliad and the Odyssey is - Ancient fairy tales that have survived through time, thanks to a literary genius in ancient Greece.-----------------* This happened long before siege engines was invented. They didn't even have iron back then. Metal objects were made out of bronze, thus it was called the bronze age. On the other hand, siege engines hadn't been of much use, since in reality it's likely that there never even existed walls and fortifications like those of Troy back then. Buildings were small, city walls were low, ships were short, swords were weak and soft, armor gave little protection, etc.** We don't know if Troy ever existed. Archaeologists have found remains of at least one ancient city in that area of Turkey, not necessarily the actual city of Troy. Quite a number of fairly large cities existed around the Mediterranean sea during the bronze age, and most of them have been lost. In short, there are no conclusive evidence that support the claims that Troy have been found. *** There are changes that are necessary to make the movie watchable. And there is always the possibility of improvements. At the same time, you should - as a filmmaker or script writer - ask yourself this question: Will I be remembered as a one of the greatest writers of all time in a couple of thousand years, comparable to Homer or William Shakespeare? If you feel that 'no' would be the most suitable answer to that question, don't make changes that aren't necessary. And make no improvements.",7,9,18,28 October 2005
Lost in Translation," Intelligent, complex and in many aspects unique movie from a promising director
","First of all, let's make one thing clear - Lost in Translation is not a movie for anybody. It's not predictable, it's not full of clichés. And this review is more about the crappy reviews that flood IMDB than the movie itself. Well, keep on reading.To sum up the storyline, Lost in Translation is about two lost and lonely souls in the vast megapolis of Tokyo, an environment that could make anyone feel lost and insignificant. And, as fate would have it, sometimes a few of these lost souls will find a kindred spirit.That's the core of Lost in Translation. Yes, it IS a comedy, as well as a drama. But not for anybody. This movie is obviously not too easy to understand for many of the viewers, since it's not as obvious and simple as hollywood-productions in general tend to be. It's still funny, but it's also subtle, intelligent and complex. And anything but simple and obvious.Naturally, this means that some will hate it, because they don't understand it. Well, that's OK with me. Usually, I feel that there are way to few movies that appeals to those of us who have higher demands than Joe Sixpack, but here's for a change a movie that truly appeals to the demanding viewer. Some of us prefer to read books, while others find comics challenging enough. It's the same with movies.To put it bluntly, if Lost in Translation would have stuck to the 'standard plot' of american movies, the storyline would have been something like this: Bored middle-aged man meets bored young woman. Resulting in an affair, they divorce their respective spouses, and start over with each other instead.But it doesn't, thankfully. Instead, we get a story about friendship across the boundaries of age. The characters are as different to each other as day is to night, yet they understand each other better than their respective spouses.In three words: A great move.I know, I've read a lot of this mumbo-jumbo (from those who didn't quite get it) about 'wannabe intellectuals' and all that, that we who liked this movie only pretend to like it in order to show off, and not because we actually did.Wrong. I say that this is a great movie and I mean it!
I've picked out a few statements from other reviews below:<ul><li>There's no good acting in this movie.</li></ul><ul><li>The movie is badly directed.</li></ul>And so on and so forth. I'm used to read 'this-is-the-worst-movie-I've-ever-seen'-reviews here on IMDB. But I don't take those reviewers that seriously. Usually, the problem is that many reviewers don't understand that they might not be capable of telling good acting/directing from bad. Anyone can write a review here on IMDB, mind you... A good reviewer knows that there are many aspects to what you review, and nothing is truly black or white, but a shade of gray.Besides, Lost in Translation is not THAT complicated, it's like your average novel, and shouldn't be to hard to understand, in my opinion.
But as someone said, movies primarily exists because a lot of people are either too lazy or stupid to read books, and I think that Lost in Translation partially proves that to be a fact.The bottom line is that this is a great movie from a director that I personally find very promising, and NOT hyped and overrated due to her lineage, as some would have you believe. The acting was great, about what you could expect from a seasoned actor like Bill Murray, while the performance of Scarlett Johansson was quite impressive, given the fact that she's still just a teenager, but managed to pull of the role of a woman who are probably supposed to be in her mid-twenties.Very watchable movie. At least, if you for a change like to watch a sophisticated, touching, unique and intelligent movie, instead of the usual garbage that's just like a million other movies.",Null,0,1,29 February 2004
The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers," Exceptionally well made movie - But somewhat ruined
","'The Two Towers' is an exceptionally well made movie, acting, special effects and music are all at the top notch. It is probably the movie I've enjoyed watching 2003. (Yes, it I know it was released during 2002, but I always wait until there is possible to get a good seat in the theaters, and leave the camping outside the movie theaters to the geeks! ;-)) The scenery was stunning, as was the visualizations of the characters in the books, as well as the atmosphere.Unfortunately, I'm not by far as satisfied by the way Peter Jackson converted the plot of the book into a movie. There are a few changes that was made, although not all of them were bad, many of them somewhat ruined the story. Mostly these 'bad' changes consists of scenes invented by mr Jackson himself, that have nothing to do with the plot, and was shown at the expense of some, more imporant scenes that had to be left out. As for example, the warg riders that assault the people of Rohan on their way to Helms Deep is quite out of line. I just can't figure out, did Peter Jackson wake up one morning, realizing that he thought it would be really cool to put orcs on big wolfs, and put them in a movie they didn't belong to? As those who have read the books probably know, there were no warg riders in the Lord of the Rings saga. The battle of Helms Deep were stretched from just a minor happening in the book, to the focal point of this entire movie. Quite naturally, a lot of scenes had to be left out then. And what is this with Osgiliath, were Frodo and Sam were brought? In the books, this was just the remnants of a former city, that had been abandoned when the forces of Mordor started to push against the people of Gondor. This meant that all references to Minas Morgul and Minas Tirith were left out of the movie, probably because of the lack of time or money, probably both. Thus, the audience missed the entire core of the story, as for exampe why it is named 'The Two Towers' - Those are the citadels of Minas Tirith and Minas Morgul, towers that represent goodness and evil. Yes, that is correct, the name of this book doesn't refer to Barad-Dur and Orthanc. All these ways of showing Arwen is another way of wasting precious time; She shouldn't appear at all in TTT.Another set of bad changes - Characters. Peter Jackson have by reasons unknown decided that the craracters in the book were to be changed. The most anoying to me is Gimli, who by mr Jacksons interpretation is supposed to be a kind of fool that we should all laugh at. Yes, he's short. And can't se over the battlements of a normal fortress. He is clumsy and crude beyond belief. All he lives for is drinking beer (subsequently burping, even in the presence of a king) and fighting. Well, as described by Tolkien, Gimli is one of the more majestic and adorable characters of the entire trilogy. And quite unique for being a dwarf, because of his deep with an elf (Legolas), a race otherwise despised by the dwarves. But this is obviously not good enough for Peter Jackson. King Theoden of Rohan have been degraded from the calm, wise and understanding regent of the books, to a grumpy, somewhat incompetent and violent 'don't-argue-with-me-I'm-the-king'-type of character in the movies. After being 'cured' by Gandalf, his first thought was to slay Wormtongue, and Aragorn had to intervene. Well, in the book, a soldier wanted to slay Wormtongue, while Theoden intervened and instead told the guards to give him a horse and let him go. So, in essence, that is what happened in the movie, so why do all these changes? Treebeard, the wise ent, picked by curiosity up the two hobbits in the book, eager to learn more about them. By Peter Jacksons interpretation, he only wanted to kill them, because he thought they were orcs. Why was this change necessary? Besides this, the ents decided, by their own initiative, to assault Isengard according to the book, as Treebeard (a.k.a Fangorn, as he not only lived in this forrest, but he also was the soul of the forrest and knew about everything that happened in there) had grown mad with the ways of Saruman. But according to Jackson, it took the cunning of two little brats from the Shire to convince the oldest living being in Middle-Earth (Treebeard) that he should assault Isengaard. Faramir, the younger brother of Boromir, was according to Tolkien the opposite of his hot-headed and bad-tempered older brother. He was wise and calm, and choose the way of the mind instead of the way of the sword. Well, not according to Jackson. Instead, he behaves like a blueprint of his older brother, seizes the hobbits, and brings them to Gondor.I could go on forever, but I'll think I better halt here. I always expect some changes to the plot and storyline when a movie is made with a book as the foundation. Otherwise, it would probably not be possible to make something watchable. But what disturbs me about TTT is that most of these changes are totally out of line, there is no need or reason for the director of doing them! So why were these changes made? Why removing scenes that could easily have done, and replacing them with stuff that is totally out of line and that in fact does a lot of damage to the plot? Why change the characteristics and behaviour of the characters in this story, when they have already been outlined by someone who dedicated almost his entire life to create these stories?IMHO, what Peter Jackson did is unforgivable. Yes, it is a great movie and very watchable. But remember this, the author of the Lord of the Ring saga is John Ronald Reuel Tolkien, not Peter Jackson or Frances Walsh. They probably don't understand that the plot of this saga is a lot more complicated than just a bunch of orcs, humans and elves that play hack'n slash with each other.Other changes that I liked is the scene were Arwen stand by Aragorns dead body in the future, and then sits by his grave for quite some time, and finally walk off into Loth-Lorien - Although the movie never explains that it is were she's heading, as well as that's were she'll die, at her own wish. I think that scene was beautiful, and quite interesting to see in this movie, since the books never states what happens to the others after the ending of the 'Return of the King'. And it also explains why Elrond is so hostile to the idea of his daughter marrying a simple human.This is a great movie. But make sure you watch it before you read the book if possible, otherwise you might be disappointed.",Null,0,0,5 April 2003
The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King," A magnificient end to a great saga
","First of all I must admit that I was a bit worried when I went to the movie theater, fearing that the Return of the King would disappoint me as much as the Two Towers. Well, I was wrong, which I'll gladly admit. 'Short' (in the relative sense) version - The Return of the King is a great ending to a great saga, especially since it includes a lot of material that I was expecting in the previous movie, but that was left out in order to clear up space for Peter Jackson to use for a lot of the fighting scenes that he's obviously so fond of. If you do the infamous book vs movie-comparison, you'll see that this movie actually starts off about in the middle of the previous book (The Two Towers), but that doesn't mean that too much of the material from the Return of the King have been left out.Instead, all that IMO actually counts in th storyline is there, and then some. Of course, this movie is not a 100% faithful to the original, but it is well within the scope, so to say. And of course the order of some events (as well as the framework for some of those) have been altered, in a way that will make the movie more enjoyable. Remember that watching a flick is in no way the same as reading a book, in fact there is quite a difference. I know that some die hard-fans of Tolkien complains about the details, but details doesn't matter that much in this case, what is important, though, is that the overall framework for the storyline is kept together, and if the wrong character says something to someone compared to the book, it's not of much performance, as long as the effect on the storyline isn't altered or ruined. And yes, the oh-so-tough war mongerer in the book who broke down and went bananas after a time breaks down instantly in the movie - Yes, that is also true, but in what way does that affect the overall story? It stays the same. So, in my opinion, Peter Jackson achieved a far better result with the Return of the King than the Two Towers, a movie that felt like nothing more than an action-flick with a lot of cheap fighting scenes to me. 'Long' version, along with some detail analysis and SPOILERS - What appealed the most to me in the Return of the King was the great effort put into making the details look good. For example, the siege engines used in the battle of Minas Tirith wasn't just the simple 'hollywood-ish' rock throwers where someone pull a lever and sends half a mountain into orbit without one single clue to how the damn thing is propelled. In this case, they use actual medieval siege engines that in some cases proved superior to cannons (more accurate and better range) as long as into the 17th or even 18th century. You can (with a fair amount of perception) see the counterweight move downwards, forcing the arm upward, and finally the slingshot hurling the projectile into the skies.  Grond (the mother of all big-motha[CENSORED]-battering rams) was another treat to my eyes, very faithful to the description in the book and looking even more imposing than my imagination made it when I read the Return of the King. And although it's name is never stated, you can hear the armies of Mordor chanting it while it is moved to the city gates and put into action. Minas Morgul looked absolutely fabulous to me, about the way that I figured from reading the book (well, the Two Towers, that is), along with the unholy glow that illuminated the city. As far as I know, Minas Morgul is one of the towers that the title of the Two Towers refers to, while Minas Tirith is the second. One can only wonder why it never appeared in the movie with that name, though, and why Minas Tirith looked more like a medieval cathedral than an actual tower.The amount of cheap dwarf-jokes have fortunately been cut down in this movie, something that I appreciate much, as I feel that it otherwise violates Tolkien's intention of showing the dwarf and the elf as equals, despite the fact that they are of different races, thus very different individuals with different strengths and weaknesses, and by their way of cooperating with each other become an almost invincible force. This is a fact that Peter Jackson or the screenwriter never realized, as the elf is shown as a superhuman hero without any obvious faults, while the dwarf is shown as a clown who makes a complete a*****e out of himself as soon as he appears in front of the camera - Bad call, New Line! All in all, this is a great movie, and a great ending to a wonderful saga. In my opinion, this last movie saved a trilogy that started out great with the Fellowship of the Ring and then went rapidly downhill with the Two Towers but got back up on the track again with the Return of the King. I can't say for sure if it could have been done better or if Peter Jackson was the ultimate choice of director, but I know that there aren't that many directors around who could have achieved a better result. I can recommend this movie to hard-core action junkies as well as the more intellectual Tolkien-fan who enjoys a good book.",Null,0,0,22 December 2003
