The Ring," Don't watch THE Ring. No you won't die, but you'll waste time!
","I don't understand why people that say they like the US version better than the Japanese version. I think those people have an inability to appreciate foreign films or lack proper reading skills to read the subtitles.  The Japanese version is far superior than the US version. THE Ring had questions that were answered very quickly and easily in the movie. Ring (I'd rather not say Ringu) is more of a mystery because many things are left to the unknown like the video tape. Everything in the video tape for THE Ring was explained unlike the video tape in Ring. I believe one of the things the the filmmakers in the Japanese version set out to say is that the unknown or uncertainty is what scares us. Having everything explained in the US version is like saying 'Americans are stupid, let's make the movie make since.' Something Dumbworks...er Dreamworks likes to say. So, as you can see, I recommend watching the Japanese version.",5,1,2,1 March 2003
Donnie Darko," pretty good
","This film is highly enjoyable unlike many other mainstream hollywood movies recently released.  This film is NOT influenced by David Lynch films because Donnie Darko is understandable.  David Lynch movies are just plain weird and incoherent.  So don't believe that Darko is like a Lynch movie, and give Donnie Darko a watch.",Null,0,0,9 January 2003
