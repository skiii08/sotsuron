The Equalizer," An Action Star is Reborn
","I always liked D.W.'s movies. This is a change in direction for him just like Liam Neeson became an action superstar late in the day, DW has just raised the bar. The first half hour seems to be at a very slow pace but with good reason. The few characters that are in the movie are very interesting and well played out. The bad guy is superb, a contender for the baddie of the year award as far as I'm concerned. The action sequences are awesome, swift and visceral. Plenty of blood n guts for those who prefer grown up violence as opposed to Edward Woodward style 'I'll shoot you in the leg if I really have to', which I loved as a kid hence my video Taliboss does The Equalizer on a certain video website. This raised the benchmark for modern intelligent action movies. I loved it.",10,0,3,17 March 2015
