Requiem for a Dream," Requiem for a Dream
","After being underwhelmed by PI, I wasn't to eager to check out this movie. I had heard so much about how disturbing and hard to watch it was, I almost felt like I was resisting the story at first.  Like I was a little let down--sure, this stuff was depressing, but it wasn't THAT bad.  An hour and a half later, I walked out of the film and turned to my friend and said: 'Man...that was some film'.  You see some awful things, but they're shot so beautifully and the editing is so frenetic, you can't look away.  Even during the TITICUT FOLLIES-inspired nose-feeding scene, you are captivated. Even those who would compare Aronofsky's style to the school of MTV quick edits can't deny he has a way with actors.  Jared Leto, Marlon Wayans and Jennifer Connelly will probably never do better work in their lives.  And Ellen Burstyn...wow.  Watching this in a theater the same weekend her wonderful EXORCIST performance was re-released just reminds us all she is a national treasure.  In the end, many disturbing things happen to many people but nothing tears at your heart more than the simpleness and reality of her character's descent.  She is absolutely perfect.",Null,0,0,14 January 2001
Memento," 'I can't remember to forget you'
","To quote the great Keanu Reeves:  'Whoa'.  Give yourself over to this hypnotic, challenging movie and you'll have a great ride.  Try too hard to figure it out or second guess it, you'll ruin the fun of watching a truly original work unfold.  It's so great to see Guy Pearce in another good role since LA CONFIDENTIAL.  Joe Pantaliono is reliable as always.  And even though the story is told backwards, it still manages to surprise you.  A clever film that doesn't sacrifice the humanity at the heart of the film for cheap shocks, this movie is more than a mere gimmick.  Pearce will truly make you care about this character, rooting for what essentially boils down to a revenge fantasy.  You could poke holes in it all night long, but why bother?  Just lean back and enjoy one of the best mindf***s captured on film.",Null,0,0,23 March 2001
"O Brother, Where Art Thou?"," Even a 'bad' Coen Brothers movie beats most 'good' movies
","A little bit of a mess and a big disappointment. Talented actors bluster their way through stereotypes, beautiful scenery highlights the lack of a cohesive story and any promise of greatness fades faster than George Clooney's accent. However, much like LEBOWSKI, O BROTHER has moments of sheer brilliance that make it worth a viewing.  The dialogue, while superficial, is fun and fast and there's real chemistry between Clooney, John Turturro and Tim Blake Nelson.  Feels more like the Coens had clever ideas for scenes and had to come up with a makeshift plot to string them on. Still, the Coens are entitled to a little self-indulgence for being the most consistently original and daring filmmakers working today.",Null,0,0,31 December 2000
