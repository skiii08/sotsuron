caitrionabalfe#jamesmangold far perfect film and he takes out of the simple relam of the genre without entirely losing the vibes of #race
A blast from the past and writing, the way it dramatised an a interesting chapter in racing.Great performances of #christianbale #mattdamon #caitrionabalfe !
Specially the kid noahjupe with Bale
Conversations and the bind between father and son was incredibly they did with ease.I think the acting and directing part was quite easy. The problem with shooting that for motor sport movie's. On that crises big applause for #phedonpapamichael work his racy moments.Even #marcobaltrami #Buacksander sound design score was furious.#fordvsferrari",7,0,1,3 January 2020

'culturally historically,aesthetically,significant.' Movie ever made !
Douglas is terrific as the iron-jawed slave fuelled by righteous fury.Of all the historical epics, this pretty much takes the biscuit, with an unbelievable cast, incredible cinematography and plenty of quotable scenes.",7,0,1,22 December 2019

( It's a razor-sharp throwback ) entertainment that's as smart, witty, stylish and exhilarating narration with touch of twists.
#steveYedlin never allows his cinematography to get too showy to distract from the mystery or ensemble.
Nathan Johnson music grabs attention.Craig is delightful-I love the excitement in his voice when he figures things out late in the film.Ana de Armas, who is really the heart of the movie and claim to love Marta.",8,0,1,1 January 2020
Children of Heaven," Modesty of storytelling
","' The Adjustment Beauro 'Film: Children of Heaven
Director : Majid Majidi
Cinematographer : Parviz Malekzaade
Music : Keivan Zahanshahi
It's the beautiful tale of innocence, poverty and compassion - a film that pulls us with such power into the situation faced by its characters that we can't be left unmoved.At the same time it evokes memories of Vittorio De Sica's 'Bicycle Thieves' and Albert Lamorisse's 'The Red Balloon.'
Satyajit Ray's 'Pather Panchali''The Reaction' at the end of a bunch of goldfish swimming around a pair of feet
This particular scene made it's a great Cinematic Experience !Greatest tales are in a surrealistic simple way, they don't need more colours or anything else to attract the Cinema lovers !!It's a master class Art form !!#majidmajidi

Incendies," Deeply disturbing end

Director : Dennis Villeneuve
Dop : @andreturpin

@melissadesormeauxpoulin
@maxime_gaudetteIt is quite better to be idle than breaking the silence, the impact of breaking silence is investable !the burden of knowing what's taking place off-screen is just as difficult for the audience to stomach.Dominated by periods of eerie calm followed by sudden, astonishing mood swings, Incendies an intelligent, emotionally complex world cinema at its finest.It is not really believable, and yet if it is not taken literally, but as a cinematic prose-poem, it has undoubted force.Incendies finds an engaging way to end the circle of violence and anger (referring to the title which translates to destruction by fire').
There are moments of absolute breathless silence that Incendies leaves you with. There's no way you can wash off what you witness and it shatters you from within.'There are truths that can only be revealed on the condition of having been discovered.'Elemental and expertly directed by #dennisvilleneuve
