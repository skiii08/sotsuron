Requiem for a Dream," A breathtaking film with a pulse
","Like Aronofsky's previous film, Pi, there is a rhythm to this movie, as if it is a synthesis of music and film.  Although the film may be difficult to watch with its harsh look at drug addiction, there are moments of beauty when he shows us the true soul of the characters which are truly touching. Burstyn's wrenching portrayal of a diet pill addicted widow alone makes this film worth viewing.",9,0,0,18 November 2000
