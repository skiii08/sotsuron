10 Cloverfield Lane," But what genre?
","It had been a good many years since watching Cloverfield, and upon watching the trailer for 10 Cloverfield Lane, I had a pretty solid idea of how this new movie was going to pan out. Now maybe this trailer only showed in Europe or perhaps even just Britain where I'm from, because I can't for a moment believe that people didn't expect exactly what was going to happen after watching the 3 minutes of footage? The twist was given away. The plot spoiled. Anyone with half a brain could've deduced the entirety of the story from the trailer.So, saying that, I knew what to expect. I went into watching the movie with a pretty strong idea of what was going to happen- and I wasn't far off.The first 3 quarters of this movie is one movie in itself, and the last quarter is an entirely different one. So far from one another in terms of genre that even despite knowing what was going to happen, I was still stunned by the total change. The first 3/4 is, honestly, extremely well done. John Goodman portrays such a convincing creepiness and terrifying instability that I found my skin crawling in almost every scene he was in. He completely steals the movie for me. And thank God, because without him I don't think there would be much to hold it up. The psycho-thriller element to this movie is fantastic. If it had remained solely within that genre, I think you'd be working with a solid 9/10. But the ending just sours it for me. Expected, but not enjoyable. Cool CGI and action is great in itself but after a buildup of drama and tension and claustrophobic social interactions, it just feels odd and misplaced. All in all, a great movie that's thoroughly worth watching- but I feel the sharp deviation at the end will either confuse and disappoint, or be a snippet of excitement that isn't nearly satisfying enough.",7,2,2,15 July 2016
The Babadook," Different, but good?
","I so badly wanted to love this film when I saw the trailer because I'm sick and tired of the stereotypical 'jump-scare' formula that so, so many horror films rely on these days, and the trailer promised something different. Although I felt that this film broke away successfully, it isn't without faults. Where it so thankfully steers clear of jump scare clich√©'s, it fails to avoid many others such as 'unusual boy that nobody understands', 'wimpy, flaky woman who snaps' and the overused 'insects to signify mental breakdown'. It's a little exhausting to see these repeated. A stereotype that the film uses successfully, however, (possibly the best use of this I've seen in cinema so far) is the children's-story element. The Babadook book itself has easily the most terrifying illustrations I've seen, and it works so, so well to create unease. The illustrations are perfect, and I wish the drawings were used more frequently to express fear, because once they were turned into CG creations the horror was gone. ...What a surprise. Have we not learnt from this yet?'Monsters' are always best left to the imagination- and that's where the movie failed, I feel, by showing the Babadook as an entity. To remain a figment of the viewers imagination with nothing to fuel your conjuring's but the drawings in the book, I know the movie would've been a lot more terrifying. But once we see the Babadook, a huge slice of the terror is gone.Aside from that; the cinematography was beautiful; the palette of heavy blue was effective and the camera angles made the mundane day-to-day activities much more bearable. The child actor held his own; none of the acting felt forced or ridiculous, even if the constant 'mummy! mummy!' got a little frustrating (we get it, it builds tension, but i'm clawing at my ears here). Overall, not as scary as I'd hoped, but it took horror into a much more positive direction. It was a great insight into the issues of single-parenthood and the necessity of support. How problems such as heartache don't just 'go away', they stay with you, buried deep down (in the basement, as it were), but can be controlled with love and help and understanding. The film wasn't a shallow horror story, it voices deeper meaning and insight- which you don't see much of nowadays.(On a side note- where did that kid even GET that dove? Seriously. What.)",7,4,12,6 December 2014
