Scarface," I did not like this movie.
","Scarface is, in my humble opinion, an overrated heap of typically excessive US junk violence movie. Some good acting though. Al Pacino is a great actor who unfortunately seems to choose rolls in movies that I myself personally dislike, for example all those incredibly overrated Godfather nonsense movies. Michelle Pfeiffer did very well too. I have to admit though, that the 2 hours and 50 minutes did not at all seem to long.",2,2,7,19 April 2017
