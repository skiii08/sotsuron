Catch Me If You Can," Don't miss this one!!
","This was a really entertaining and engrossing movie all the way through. At two hours and twenty minutes it seemed like an hour and a half.  Walken and DiCaprio were excellent, and Hanks even better than that!!  Good character development, no slow spots, and enough humor too. Very, very good. 8/10",9,1,2,2 January 2003
Final Destination 2," Not bad. . . not bad at all!!!
","If you saw the first it was pretty good. . .this one is better. The storyline is about the same, not great, but GOOD.  The special effects are much, much better, and better 'kills' too.  The opening car accident scene is the highlight of the movie so you want to pay attention to that.  A cool ending too.  I'm going with an 8/10.",8,0,0,2 February 2003
Final Destination," Frustrating at times, but definitely not boring!!!
","Better than the average slasher film because the 'slasher' was the grim reaper, an unknown and almost unstoppable entity, much harder to deal with, there just wasn't anywhere to escape, and nothing you could do to 'cheat death'.  The character development was OK, but not great.  All in all the movie was well done, good special effects too.  There was one annoying character in the movie, that was its worst point.  I recommend this and give it 8 out of 10!!!",8,1,2,17 March 2000
