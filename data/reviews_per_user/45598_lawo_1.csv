The Blair Witch Project," Is poor production really the cool way to make movies?
","This film must represent the best marketing strategy since Microsoft. Slap together a film made on really poor home cameras with no soundtrack, no proper editing, no post-production and the flimsiest of plots and convince everyone that this is the cool way to make movies and you have The Blair Witch Project.  If you can sit through the jerky pictures until the end you will be rewarded with one of the greatest anti-climaxes in cinema history. If however you are a fan of first year film study drop outs' attempts at suspense then this one's for you.",1,2,4,8 December 1999
