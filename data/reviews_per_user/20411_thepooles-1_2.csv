Alien 3," Aliens 3 as an early 90s AIDS scifi parable?
",After viewing Aliens 3 in an almost empty movie theater during its original short release time I had the feeling that I had just viewed a cinematic parable for the AIDS scourge. There were haunting and elegaic sections of the film that were wrenching to view. Coupled with beautifully muted thoughtful music cues it was a somber but enriching experience. Being a social deviant was presented as a curse that keeps on giving regardles of the setting or one's vague search for redemption or atonement. A hetero female enters into the monastic/penal colony setting and shows that regardless of their determination she is the one symbol of gender purity that will not just haunt them but very likely be the catalyst of a terrifying death and oblivion. As other viewers have pointed out the film is rich in material to ponder much like BLADE RUNNER.,Null,1,51,21 February 2008
Blade Runner," The replicant Roy ends up nobler than his creator or tracker.
",Just as man may have made God in his own image and not vice versa the replicant Roy transcends his created purpose in his final moments with an act of unprogrammed compassion for a human who most likely was incapable of reciprocation. The tracker Deckard was more monstrous than the rampaging Roy. I think Philip Dick's tracker cop Deckard could easily have transformed into an unwitting replicant and one cleverly used by the authorities. Another Sci Fi classic is SOYLENT GREEN which I feel captured the more likely dystopian near future. Both film directors were savvy in their scoring choices. Beethoven worked for SOYLENT GREEN and Vangelis's 80s synthesizer arsenal layering was perfect for BLADE RUNNER.,Null,1,3,19 August 2007
