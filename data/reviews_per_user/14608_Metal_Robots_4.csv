Blade Runner 2049," 8 out of 10
","I'm going to see it again soon and i'm not going to give any spoilers but I just went to see Blade Runner 2049 and it's the best performance that Harrison Ford has given (in my memory) in years, he acted as though he actually wanted to be in this and cared about it, unlike some other things he's been in recently ;)Vangelis's score has always been as important to me as anything else about the original, and in this one you hear echos of it through-out which is nice, although it's not as varied and memorable as Vangelis's I don't think it is trying to be and it does the job. The film is 100% in-keeping with the original, if you like that you will not fail to enjoy the new one.The film does nothing but add to the ideas of the original, and it remains every bit as subtle and moody while showing a genuine love and understanding of the original with nods to it that are never cloying or sicophantic. I don't want to say any more than watch it at the flicks if you want to see it, it's worth the experience and it's worth showing support for atmospheric sci-fi that respects the audience's intelligence.A worthy sequel to the original classic, but not perfect. Some things I think could have been left out and added nothing to the film...the prostitute, the Joi character (especially the three way sex scene - exploring K's sexual desire just felt awkward and unnecessary, at least the way it was done) and the reproduction Rachel. I can see why they were in there but they were just weakly-implemented ideas that were narrative cul- de-sacs I wouldn't miss at all, and without them the film might have been a bit more concise, I don't think shaving a few minutes off that mammoth run time would have done any harm.",8,1,3,14 May 2018
Ready Player One," The most lightweight Speilberg film so far.
","I fell asleep and missed the middle half, can't really be bothered to re-watch it, it's not very good and probably Spielberg's weakest film (that I'm aware of - bearing in mind I haven't see A.I. for ages). Wasn't really expecting much though as I tried reading the book a while ago and couldn't finish that either, it was so badly written, but i'd hoped they had fixed that with the screenplay. It was slightly better than the book in that it didn't just resort to lists of lazy context-less 80s references, barely held together by a story seemingly written buy a junior school kid.Films that are 50% CGI, you have to ask how much 'directing' was involved anyway. It's hard to work out who it is aimed at, as it's probably OK for kids and young teenagers as a pretty standard lightweight fantasy film like The Hunger Games / Maze Runner etc, but the 80s references that are in there are not going to mean much to them (I presume)",6,0,1,13 April 2018
Star Wars: Episode IX - The Rise of Skywalker," A McGuffin-fest of craptabulous proportions
","Any one remember the beyond-stupid scene where Rey stands on a cliff edge and uses the McGuffin dagger to find the other McGuffin? So, if you just so happen to be standing at EXACTLY the right point, angle, elevation etc, plus the ruin of the Death Star hasn't moved or degraded at all in the decades it was there.....this tells you where the next required McGuffin is (of course by the time you actually got on the ruin, your perspective would be wrong again anyway...)By this point it was clear that the writers never had any intention of making a decent film, I think they wrote the whole thing in a day and just made it. Honestly, it was just a case of 'We HAVE to finish it, and quick. Rip off anything you can think of, it doesn't matter how stupid it is, just write anything and fast'. The whole film was one McGuffin leading to another, aided by a long string of amazingly convenient coincidences. It was dumbfoundingly bad. This is like watching someone play Tomb Raider. Star Wars is now reduced to sub-video game level story telling.I only gave it 2/10 because it at least had small appearances from Leia, Han and Luke of some kind.Disney, please employ capable writers/producers or just give up on this nonsense, because at this point you were just prodding and poking at a carcass, wringing out the last few remaining dollars possible.",2,28,43,11 April 2020
Alien: Covenant," An improvement over Prometheus
","To open: I know a lot of people really like Prometheus and think its attempt at a new direction was great. Personally I think the basic idea behind it was ambitous and could have been amazing, but it was ruined by trying to include TOO many ideas and too many irellevent characters, and definitely too many for the farcical, inadequate screenplay to hold together.Watched ALIEN: COVENANT last night. Definitely better than Prometheus. It's clear that the writers decided not to follow the exact story as was intended at the end of Prom, possibly due to the criticism it received. It had a lot of unashamedly obvious references and call-backs to Ridley Scott's original Alien, and even a couple of nods to other classic films of his like Blade Runner, with some very reminiscent scenes, and dialogue lifted straight-from. The first two acts kind of wrap-up what was introduced in Prom, the final act almost comes across as a soft reboot of Alien.It's an improvement over Prometheus no doubt, but still has a couple of annoyingly stupid characters doing annoyingly stupid things (luckily nowhere near as many is Prom did) and some silly plot elements that seem illogical, unnecessarily convoluted, or just plain unnecessary. (I really wish they had never introduced the black goo nonsense in the first place, the original parasite concept was perfect and much more scary, and adding more vectors muddied the elegance of it)The action is mostly good, except (ironically) for the scenes with what we now regard as the classic Xenomorph, which are almost totally lacking in tension, neither as shocking as Alien, or ominous as Aliens. Not wanting to sound too negative: The films looks great and you are getting your money's worth in terms of atmosphere and sound and production design. It has an effectively gritty tone compared to the (what I considered) shallow half-baked fantasy/allegory of Prom and all the performances are good to great. Michael Fassbender again has easily the best moments and plays dual-roles very well.Over-all i'd say it's a fairly good serious sc-fi action film compared to what little else similar is around these days, it has much less of the confused directionless feel that Prom had, and after having seen this, the sequel it obviously sets up at the end is more welcome now, even if Scott seems happy to comfortably sit and trade on past glories.I think we can now possibly expect a slew of average to quite good sequels if they carry on in this vein (and he stays in good enough health to carry on directing), I doubt there will ever be anything that has the same impact as the first two again.",7,3,10,25 May 2017
