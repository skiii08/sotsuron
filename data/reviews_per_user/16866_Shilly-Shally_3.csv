Minority Report," Average
","You may have got the impression from the previews that Minority Report is a fast-paced compelling action movie set in the future. It is not so, in fact the action sequences take up only about a 1/5 of the movie. The movie seems to slow down dramatically in pace about 1/3 the way through and although it has a fantastic storyline, characters and cast, it just fails grasp the full attention of the audience. 7/10.",Null,0,0,16 December 2002
Lost in Translation," A delightful way to spend 2 hours.
","This film is a bittersweet, low key yet uplifting story about two people.Don't read any reviews from critics, don't ask how it is, just go see it and enjoy it.It'll linger in your mind and enlighten you for the rest of your day.",10,1,2,16 January 2004
The Matrix Revolutions," Even with my lowly expectations it still disappoints.
","After the big atrocity that was Matrix Reloaded comes another- Matrix Revolutions. The many questions brought up by the unconvincing storyline in 'Reloaded' go mostly unanswered in 'Revolutions' i.e how could Neo stop the machines outside the Matrix?The ending seems make-shift and story improvised in a film that is muddled and dull if not for the occasional action and a big battle to save Zion against the machines 2/3 way through.Well, the good thing is, the trilogy is over and Joel Silver and the Wachowkis won't be able to make any more money filled mallets to knock down the brilliant monument they built with 'the Matrix.'
