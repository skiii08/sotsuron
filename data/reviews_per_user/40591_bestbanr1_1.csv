The Twilight Saga: Breaking Dawn - Part 1," !!!!This review may contain spoilers!!!!!
","hi , Breaking Dawn part 1 is really not like the other twilight movies , the soundtrack was amazing , the acting was really really good , its has real action and real suspense unlike twilight , new moon , eclipse .. the sex scene was hot , the birth scene was incredible Kristen did an amazing job in this one , i'm not a twilight fan and i cried at the end i was really surprised after watching Breaking Dawn cause this is the first amazing twilight movie ,Bill Condon did an amazing job in this one , Breaking Dawn is one of the best movies i ever seen in my life but the sex scene and The blood level was kind of over-rated for a PG-13 movie like Joey A' Rpd said this movie should be Rated-R ,breaking dawn is not for teenagers at all i recommend it for 18+ ..",10,57,164,31 October 2011
