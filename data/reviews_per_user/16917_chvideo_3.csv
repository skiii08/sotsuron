Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," a good film despite what critics say and Jar-Jar Binks' annoying behavior
","First of all, I have to say that I liked this movie and plan on seeing it again.  The visual fx were stunning, and the movie was entertaining except for the Jar-Jar character.  I realize that this character was aimed at kids, but the slapstick comedy was too idiotic and I had a hard time understanding what he was saying--that just got on my nerves.One thing I should say is that I left the theater feeling unfulfilled, (I never thought I'd say that about a star wars film) but maybe that's the point.  I then realized that the balance of seeing BOTH the empire and the rebellion was a key part of the original trilogy.  This film focuses a great deal on the Republic and the exploits of the two Jedi and I realize that showing too much about the rising evil sith lords and the beginnings of what will eventually become the Empire would be tipping Lucas' hand too much.....but I just felt that the film was very one-sided.  The scenes that included the 'trade federation' activities were just not enough.....just a thought...In the end I still think this is a good film and despite what critics have said, it does not JUST set us up for the following two films but stands alone on its own with its own plot which is resolved by the end credits.In a sentence: Just go see it, it's a good film.  You won't be disappointed.",8,0,0,27 May 1999
"South Park: Bigger, Longer & Uncut"," parents hate it, which means I love it
","this movie was funny, I loved all of the references to pop culture especially the 'are weeza gonna die?' Jar-Jar Binks reference from one of the 'operation human shield' soldiers.  I couldn't stop laughing when the American general called in Bill Gates and shot him in the head--that was excellent!!  I didn't stop clapping for at least a minute.....poetic justice indeed.  Just one question - What's the deal with the movie theater carding me to get into this flick?!?  That was lame.",8,0,0,16 July 1999
Pulp Fiction," Average, or a little above....maybe
",I've always wanted to put this film's parts in order....just a strange interest of mine.  Never mind....it would just make it even more boring.,5,1,4,12 January 1999
