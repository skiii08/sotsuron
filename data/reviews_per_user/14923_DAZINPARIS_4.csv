The Avengers," A consummate failure - here's why
","Here's why 'The Avengers' fails so badly.1. Wrong, wrong director - Joss Whedon is a TV Director. 'Serenity' worked because it was essentially a TV movie. And he has here made 'The Avengers' a TV movie. Bad move, this should have gone to J.J. Abrams, Bryan Singer or Brad Bird.2. Dreadful miscasting - only Robert Downey Junior can hold his head high. Chris Evans is as wooden in this as the flat 'Captain America' film. Those playing Thor, Hulk, Black Widow either phone in performances or look embarrassed.3. Weak, weak villain - Tom Hiddleston plays a slight, camp character who offers little panache or interest and more closely resembles a spoiled teenager than anything else. This film needed a 'General Zod'.4. Too much obvious CGI - come on, it's 2012, there's no excuse for the George Lucas-y effects like the flying Shield craft graphics.5. No drama, tension and a script so obviously flat that Whedon inserts misplaced self conscious quips to lighten the tone.For anyone growing up with Marvel comics in the 70's (chime with me on this), we deserved SO much more. For younger audiences, it will pass I'm sure.Really can't understand though the positive reviews. Am I alone in this ?",1,386,800,11 May 2012
Captain America: The First Avenger," A waste of everyone's time
","So, Cap America in a nutshell? No fun, no drama, no tension, no emotion.Chris 'charisma free' Evans is horribly miscast, as is Dominic Cooper who needs a lot of practice on his American accent.Tommy Lee Jones turns up and phones it in, whilst Hayley Atwell is just plain wooden.Stupid CGI everywhere with misplaced technology (lasers in 1941) and a rubbish pantomime villain.Joe Johnston, hang your head in shame. Thor certainly wasn't great, but it was better than this.",Null,9,24,27 July 2011
Terminator 3: Rise of the Machines," hmm not bad actually
","Ok, T3 is exactly the same as T2, but not too much CGI and some groovy action made it for me the best blockbuster of the summer. Only one thing to spoil it and that was the waste of space that was Clare Danes. Cringingly unconvincing actress and the worst female casting there has been in a while (although I couldn't take my eyes of her nose).",Null,0,0,10 December 2003
I Am Legend," Would have been OK but....
","this film was completely spoilt by the worst CGI in years. It was half film, half video game. Seriously dreadful and unconvincing monsters.What was the director thinking ?A summary :It starts off fine although it reminds one of 28 days later. It also introduces some needless religious wobble towards the implausible end. Will Smith is fine. The flashbacks work well.But I think Hollywood is lazy once again in rushing out a picture that's been on the backburner for years. And unless you can produce Gollum in the studio, don't bother with shoddy CGI that's only suitable for a game.",4,1,3,24 December 2007
