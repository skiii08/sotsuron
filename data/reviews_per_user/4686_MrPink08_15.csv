The Incredible Hulk," The Incredible Ed
","Edward Norton has always been my favorite actor, and here is one of the reason why: he can take crap and make it look good. Case in point: The Incredible Hulk. After the 2003 Ang Lee disaster, Norton stars and writes this superhero epic, which is just as good as its companion Iron Man, which I also loved. Norton makes us care about the Bruce Banner character. We actually want him to find a cure for his 'illness' and not just break out into a Hulk fit at any random time.Instead of boring us with a dull backstory like Eric Bana's Hulk did, director Louis Lerterier (The Transporter) opts to show us the backstory in an opening montage during the credits. That way, we get right to the action. Bruce Banner (Norton) is living in Brazil, seeking a cure for his 'incident'. However, he is tracked down by General Thunderbolt Ross (William Hurt) and Emil Blonsky (Tim Roth) who want to use Banner's substances to create 'supersoldiers'. Eventually, Blonsky takes some of the supersoldier serum and becomes like Banner, only evil. Banner teams up with girlfriend Betty Ross (Liv Tyler) and Dr. Samuel Sterns (Tim Blake Nelson) to find a cure for his rage.In addition to Norton, it was nice to see Tim Roth finally get a starring role in a film not directed by Quentin Tarantino. Tyler portrays Betty well, and she and Norton have good chemistry on screen. Hurt's Ross was a huge improvement over Sam Elliot's, and Nelson is a fun character who comes off likable.Fans will love the cameos in this film as well. Tony Stark, aka The Invincible Iron Man (Robert Downey Jr.) shows up at the end, and Lou Ferrigno makes a cameo. But the real star is Norton and his big bad green self. A Perfect 10, and I cannot wait for The Avengers Movie.",10,4,6,1 July 2008
The Hangover," A Comedy We All Desperately Needed
","In rough times like these, we need a good comedy to make us laugh and put a smile on our faces. The Hangover is that movie. Its a raunchy rowdy crazy good time, featuring everything from retro Mercedes to Mike Tyson. So far, it's easily the best film I've seen all year.The story revolves around a trip to Las Vegas gone wrong, which sometimes works (Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas) and sometimes dosen't (What Happens In Vegas). Two best friends, the cool schoolteacher Phil (Bradley Cooper) and the nerdy dentist Stu (Ed Helms), along with the bride's brother Alan (Zach Galifianakis) wake up in their room in Caesar's Palace, with no recollection of what happened the night before, which they spent having a wild bachelor party for their friend Doug (Justin Bartha). Turns out, there's a tiger in the bathroom, a baby in the closet, Stu's missing a tooth,and (for reasons unexplained) there's a chicken in the kitchen. And, oh yeah, Doug's nowhere to be found. The three race around Sin City searching for the groom, where more crazy stuff starts happening. When the valet brings their car, it's a police car. Stu is married to a stripper (Heather Graham, beautiful as ever). They apparently had a run in with a mean gangster (Ken Jeong). They went to Mike Tyson's house. The list goes on and on, each misadventure produces more hilarity than the last.The cast is pretty much a poor man's Judd Apatow, without the cheap love story sandwiched in (yes, Knocked Up and The 40 Year Old Virgin were classics, but turned slowly into chick flick territory). Most of the guys you know you have seen, but just can't put a name to a face. Helms, best known as Rainn Wilson's rival on The Office, plays the role of Stu perfectly. He plays the delusional Stu with great humor, especially when he goes crazy on the others. As the closest thing to a lead, Cooper is the laid back guy who tries to keep everyone under control. Hopefully more lead roles are headed his way. Galifianakis plays the annoying Alan with perfect poise, that when he when he dosen't fret over the tiger when he first sees it, you just have to wonder why no one discovered him until now. Bartha's screen time is reduced, due to the fact he's missing for half the film, but he does his job well and manages to crack some good ones before he goes missing. There are some enjoyable cameos by Mike Epps, Tyson, and Jeffrey Tambor that will keep you laughing as well.Overall, The Hangover is one of the funniest films I've ever seen, and, as I said earlier, the best I've seen all year. A sequel is already being written, but I'm not sure if I want it. But knowing these guys, if they could make a comedy about anything, I'd probably watch it.",10,4,6,11 June 2009
I'm Not There," A Legendary Tribute to a Legend
","Bob Dylan, in my humble opinion, is the greatest American singer/songwriter in the history of American music. Todd Haynes does an excellent job of covering this man's epic life. Using six different people, including a woman and an African American kid, to portray Dylan is risky, but it pays off very well. The fact that we get to hear Dylan's greatest hits on top of that is amazing. The film is split into six segments. Jude (Cate Blanchete) is Dylan in the 'Don't Look Back' era. He is a popular singer, outcast by the media and fans due to the complexity of his songs. Jack (Christian Bale) portrays Dylan the born again Christian. Woody (Marcus Carl Franklin) is a kid who idolizes the great Woody Guthrie, just like a young Dylan. Billy (Richard Gere) is Dylan the outlaw in a Billy the Kid vs Pat Garrity (Bruce Greenwood) story. Robbie (Heath Ledger) is Dylan the divorcée, an actor trying to hold on to his wife (Charlotte Gainsbourg). And Arthur (Ben Whishaw) is Dylan the poet.Not only do the Dylans impress me (Blanchette especially), the supporting cast portrays important figures in his life as well, including Suze Rotolo (Gainsbourg), Allen Ginsburg (David Cross), Joan Baez (Julliane Moore) and Edie Sedgewick (Michelle Williams). The musical segments are very creative as well. The song 'Ballad of a Thin Man' is used to torment a reporter named Mr. Jones (Greenwood again) who dosen't understand Jude.In conclusion Haynes succeeds in this: It is hard to make a biopic. When you do not intend to use your subject's name, it's downright hell. But Haynes is totally up to task. Now if only we could get him to remake 'The Doors'...",10,0,0,27 May 2008
Inglourious Basterds," An Inglourious Pick for the Best Film of the Year!
","This summer, everyone I know waited for Transformers: Revenge of the Fallen. Me? I waited in great anticipation for the new film from my favorite director Quentin Tarantino, a World War II revenge epic entitled Inglourious Basterds. And, I will admit, it did not disappoint.While Tarantino is known for his over the top violence, it's not the blood and gore that makes his films so good. It's the long sessions of dialog. While this may turn some film goers off (like my friends who preferred the aforementioned Transformers), to me it's what makes his films roll. If you pay attention, the dialog is very funny and entertaining. Plus, the action is more exciting and unexpected when QT sticks it in the middle of the conversation.In his previous films, Tarantino used mainstream Hollywood stars for his films. However, with the exception of Brad Pitt and a cameo by a nearly unrecognizable Mike Myers (fans of The Office will recognize BJ Novak aka Ryan), you probably won't recognize nearly three quarters of the actors in the film. All of the foreign actors in the film are terrific, and they give a sense of realism to the film. Melanie Laurent, a French actress, is Shosanna, a young Jewish girl who plans to burn down her cinema with Nazi leaders inside. Among the Basterds are Til Schweiger, a sadistic German who kills Nazis in creative ways, and Michael Fassbender as a British war leader. As for Pitt, he portrays the leader of the Basterds, a hillbilly named Aldo Raine. Raine is an awesome character, and a role only Pitt could play. He leads his all Jewish team into France where they do 'one thang and one thang only-(kill) Nazis'. Myers's cameo is small, but you can't believe how unrecognizable he is. Hopefully, Myers gets his career back on track after duds like The Love Guru and The Cat in the Hat (easily one of the worst films ever). Eli Roth, best known as the director of Hostel, is on hand to portray Donnie, a Bostonian Jew who beats Nazis with a baseball bat. Roth is not only a good director, but a good actor as well. He previously cameoed in Tarantino's Death Proof, and hopefully more roles are on his way. But Christoph Waltz steals the show as the crazy Nazi general Hans Landa. Waltz speaks every language in the movie, and portrays Landa perfectly. You really can't like Waltz since he portrays a Nazi, but hopefully some better roles are headed his way. Some film goers will recognize Diane Krueger, who portrays German actress Bridget von Hammerstark, a spy working for the Allies. Krueger is best known for portraying Nicolas Cage's love interest in National Treasure. There, she seemed pure American. In this film, she speaks her native German perfectly, showing her versatility.So, as the summer ends, I have to say I came in with a bad attitude about the summer of 09 (movie-wise anyway). However, with films like Basterds, The Hangover, and District 9, I think film goers will remember 09's movies for long to come.",10,5,14,28 August 2009
The Mummy," The Mummy...Dig it!
","Let's face it, not too many people remember the 1932 film The Mummy very well. But its 1999 remake is an Egyptian thrill ride complete with explosions, flesh eating scarabs, Brendan Fraser, desert people, plagues, Rachel Weiez, and, of course, a cool mummy. The movie assumes you have an imagination (I do obviously) and is nothing but a fun time.Brendan Fraser stars as Rick O'Connell, who will remind people of Indiana Jones, but more badass. Fraser portrays Rick as a wise-cracking American who is searching for treasure beneath the sands of an ancient Egyptian city. He is also escorting Evy (Weiez), a nerdy but pretty British librarian, and her brother Jonathan (John Hannah), who, like Rick, is interested in striking gold. Trouble starts when Evy accidentally awakes Ihmotep (Arnold Vosloo), a former priest of a Pharoah that was mummified alive for murdering the said Pharaoh, after having an affair with his mistress (Patricia Velazquez). Things go from bad to worse when Rick's 'buddy' Bennie (Kevin J O'Connor) sides with Ihmotep in exchange for gold. Joining the battle to kill the mummy is the leader of a desert people tribe (Oded Fehr) who warned the party in vain to leave the city or die.The film is not only a great action movie, but it can also be considered a comedy. Fraser and Hannah frequently crack out classic one liners such as Fraser's 'If I don't make it outta here, don't put me down for mummification' and Hannah simply showing disgust when a group of Americans are seen having fun when the desert people attack. O'Connor is funny as the bumbling Benny, and Weiez simply works her magic on Fraser. These two have some great on screen chemistry. Fehr is awesome as a gun shooting desert guy. And while the mummy is a bit whiney, Vosloo does a good job with part anyway.An excellent film. A perfect 10, and I definitely recommend the film's sequels as well.",10,2,2,21 August 2008
Cloverfield," Fun, yet questionable
","JJ Abrams kept us in the dark with his film Cloverfield. Now that it's here, it's safe to say it lived up to expectations-and then some. Abrams gives a monster we've never seen before, a camera view we've seen only once before (The Blair Witch Project), and a film we probably won't see for a long time.The film centers on a going away party in honor of Rob Hawkins (Michael Stahl-David), who is moving to Japan for a job. The party is being thrown by his brother Jason (Mike Vogel) and Jason's girlfriend Lily (Jessica Lucas). Rob's best friend Hud (TJ Miller, in a role that seems like it was written for Rainn Wilson) is given filming duties for the evening, and we see the night's events from his point of view. Later that night, the party ends early when a huge monster attacks town. What makes this film great is that not only do we have a huge monster, but we have little monsters too. Rob and his friends later go searching in New York for Beth (Odette Yustman), his ex-girlfriend, whom Rob clearly still loves.While the film has its good qualities (The monster(s), the special effects, Hud), it is sadly held back with its few problems. For one thing, it left more questions unanswered than it did answered. Sure that's fun, but this movie just went overboard on the unanswered questions. Another thing, with the exception of Hud, I found the other character quite annoying. And finally, the movie is just way too short.Overall, a great and fun film. Please, please, please, JJ...make a sequel.",8,0,0,8 August 2008
District 9," A New Species of Sci Fi
","Aliens come to Earth. Which means they're here to attack and destroy us right? Usually, that's the case. We've seen it in countless film, like Independence Day, Alien Vs Predator, and even Mars Attacks. However, Peter Jackson and first time director Neil Blomkamp take us in a different direction with their film District 9. Blomkamp avoids all the alien movie clichés, including an all star cast and a major American city.Instead of a hostile alien species, the aliens in District 9 are leaderless drones who make an emergency landing over the city of Johannesburg, South Africa (rather than New York or LA). The aliens are malnourished and leaderless, so the South African government places them in District 9, which quickly becomes a slum crawling with aliens and South African gangsters who demand to learn how to use the aliens' supercool weapons. The aliens begin causing trouble within the city, sparking a relocation effort led by the evil MNU (Multi National United) Corporation. All MNU really cares about is learning how the alien weapons work, much like the gangsters. However, neither side has learned anything.Leading the eviction cause is Wikus van der Merwe (Sharlto Copley), a enthusiastic MNU agent who passes through District 9 with glee, happily evicting the aliens (who will do anything for a can of cat food) and burning down houses with their unborn young inside. The eviction sequences are what JJ Abram's Cloverfield should've been. Copley ad-libbed all his lines during the 'documentary' sequence of the film, and he makes feel as if we're watching an actual documentary. Wikus' world goes to hell, however, when he sprays himself with some alien liquid. On the plus (or minus, depending on how you look at it) side, he can operate the supercool alien weapons. He becomes the most wanted man in the world, and hides with a friendly alien (and the alien's cute son) in District 9.It's refreshing to see a new sci fi flick after so many clichéd failures (the recent Star Wars Episodes I and II). A native South African, Blomcamp casts mainly his fellow countrymen into his film. Copley, who helped Blomkamp create Alive in Joburg, the short film D9 is based off of, is destined to be a star some day. It's also good to see a sci fi movie set in another major city in another country. And, finally, the aliens are not the bad guys in the film. As lame as it sounds, District 9 may make you embarrassed to be a human.",9,18,27,29 August 2009
The Curious Case of Benjamin Button," Fincher and Pitt have done it Again!
","David Fincher has simply improved with every film he has done. He started off with the underrated Alien 3, then moved on to the mysterious Se7en, gave us his greatest hit with Fight Club, stayed strong with Panic Room, and, most recently, treated us with the chilling thriller Zodiac. Now, he gives us The Curious Case of Benjamin Button, but you wouldn't know that Ficher directed it if you didn't see his name at the end of the film.Once again, Fincher teams up with Brad Pitt, who portrays the title character. Pitt, who was terrific in Se7en and even better in Fight Club, portrays a character he dosen't usually portray. Benjamin Button is a tragic yet determined individual, who has the slight problem of aging backwards. Whoever did the CGI effects in this movie deserves an Oscar. Early on, Pitt portrays Benjamin Button as a seven year who looks like he's in his 80's. You will not believe that it is Brad Pitt under all that makeup and CGI.As good as he is, Brad Pitt can't carry the film by himself. After all, he needed the respective help from Morgan Freeman and Edward Norton to make Se7en and Fight Club work. Fincher's male lead comes mainly from Jason Flemyng and Jared Harris. Flemyng does a convincing job as Benjamin's father. I didn't even recognize Flemyng, who I thought played a classic role in Guy Ritchie's Lock Stock and Two Smoking Barrels. And Harris is terrific as Captain Mike, a man Benjamin befriends while working at sea.Fincher also succeeds once again with his female lead. After working with Gwyneth Paltrow on Se7en, Helena Bonham Carter in Fight Club and Jodie Foster in Panic Room, Cate Blanchette is excellent. Cast as Benjamin's love interest, she is simply perfect. She has terrific chemistry with Pitt, especially in the touching scenes where she grows older and he grows younger.Overall, a terrific film. If I have any complaints, I have to say, the film didn't know to quit while it was ahead. What could've been a nice two hour film is stretched out to nearly three hours. And the early scenes showing the wrinkled baby Benjamin Button are a tad disturbing to look at. But I will say this. I'm not the type of guy who loves all these 'Oscar Worthy' flicks. But take my advice...trust Fincher and Pitt to work their magic all over again.",8,0,0,29 December 2008
The Dark Knight," Puts the 'Dark' in Dark Knight
","In a summer of comic book movies, deciding which one was the best is a hard task. So far we have been treated to film adaptations of Iron Man, The Incredible Hulk and a Hellboy sequel, all of which were very good. The Dark Knight makes the decision even harder.Christopher Nolan's sequel to the already excellent Batman Begins is better than the original, better than all four Burton/Schumaker films combined, and better than other comic book films such as every Superman movie ever made. Christian Bale returns as the Caped Crusader, reprising the role that made him a star. Bale once again blows us all away as he makes Michael Keaton look like George Clooney in the Batsuit. However, there is a reason the word 'Batman' is not in the title: This movie belongs to not Batman, but the Joker. The late Heath Ledger makes his presence felt in his final film. Compared to Ledger's Joker, Jack Nicholson's portrayal of the Clown Prince of Crime in Tim Burton's 1989 version of Batman is the equivalent of the disaster that was Arnold Schwarzenegger as Mr Freeze in Batman and Robin.The film picks up a few months after 'Begins'. Gotham City (a thinly disguised Chicago) is becoming safer thanks to the efforts of Batman, good cop Jim Gordon (Gary Oldman), and new Gotham DA Harvey Dent (Aaron Eckhart). The real Batman, Bruce Wayne, is facing some problems in social life, much like Peter Parker in Spider Man 2. Dent is currently dating Bruce's childhood sweetheart Rachel Dawes (Maggie Gyllhanall who replaces Katie Holmes). Gotham is suddenly threatened by The Joker, a sadistic killer who wears clown makeup and gets a kick out of torture. When Nicholson did the role, he went for laughs. Ledger does the same. The only difference is when Jack tried to be funny, he did silly things like point a gun with an outrageously long barrel. When Heath tries to be funny he does magic. He makes a pencil disappear! Wanna know how he does it, kids? He puts the pencil on the table, then throws a guy head-on into the pencil! Sir Michael Caine and Morgan Freeman reprise their respective roles as Alfred and Lucius Fox. Both are a couple of the greatest actors we have ever seen, and are not afraid to demonstrate. They both are the voice of reason in Bruce Wayne's crazy brain, and crack out the funny one liners to lighten the mood of this dark film.Speaking of the film's darkness, it's not a great idea to bring the kiddies to this one. This is darker than all of the previous five and even some adults may be affected by Ledger's death when viewing this film. It's impossible not to think of Heath's passing when he is on screen, and some images seem a bit disturbing due to his death. For example, there is one scene where The Joker hides in a body bag to avoid some rival gangsters.Ledger, once again, makes this film. Fans, like myself, will love his memorable quotes such as 'Why so SERIOUS?' or 'Let's put a smile on that face!'. However, sometimes Ledger makes his presence felt by not saying a word at all. For example, a scene where The Joker, dressed in as a nurse, blows up a hospital, is made funny in a sick way. Heath simply walks through the crumbling building as explosions go off behind him. After a while they stop. Ledger, makes a few funny faces, messes around with a controller, then casually walks away as the building explodes.Ledger couldn't have done it without a little help, though. Oldman's Gordon is given a much bigger role in the film, much to the viewer's delight. While everybody loved Oldman is 'Begins', 'TDK' establishes Gordon as the greatest hero in Gotham not named Batman. Eckhart is great as Dent, and even better as the villainous Two-Face, who Dent becomes when his face is horribly scarred by The Joker. Eckhart makes fans forget about Batman Forever, where Tommy Lee Jones completely butchered the part.Sadly, though, the film is not without its few flaws. Gyllanhall has no chemistry on screen with anyone, not even Bale. Katie Holmes is, surprisingly, missed. Caine is very good, but his role is made smaller in this film. And finally, one of the things that made 'Begins' so good was Cillian Murphy's Scarecrow. Sadly, Scarecrow makes only a quick appearance that has almost nothing to do with the plot. He is, however, spared, leaving Scarecrow fans, like myself, hopeful.Overall, The Dark Knight makes us love the comic book film even more. It also gives us a tragic reminder...we are Definitely going to miss Heath Ledger.",9,5,11,19 July 2008
Grindhouse," Crazy Good Fun!
","I was not alive for the height of exploitation films. After viewing Grindhouse, I sure wish I was. Robert Rodriuguez (From Dusk Till Dawn, Sin City) and Quentin Tarantino (Reservoir Dogs, Pulp Fiction, Kill Bill) have already combined to form some excellent films, but this time, they really outdid themselves. As the film's poster will tell you, Quentin and Robert deliver 2 1/2 hours of pure dynamite! And, with a little help from their friends, they have managed to pull off an excellent double feature, which leaves you heading over to Blockbuster to pick more grindhouse flicks.First up is Rodriguez's Planet Terror, which features a go-go dancer named Cherry (Rose McGowan) teaming up with others, including her ex-boyfriend El Ray (Freddy Rodriguez), to stop vicious man-eating zombies from taking over the world. This film is typical Rodriguez: A 2 hour complation of sex and violence, but intelligently put together. Since this is supposed to be a Grindhouse flick, the violence and sex is really high. Marley Shelton, Josh Brolin, Naveen Andrews, Michael Bihen, and Jeff Fahey co-star. Fans will love cameos by Tarantino, Stacy Ferguson (better known as Fergie), and Bruce Willis. It's fun to see Bihen back in a badass role, bringing us back to the days where he was making us applaud in The Terminator and Aliens. Be warned, though. If you're not the type of film-goer with an imagination, you're gonna hate this film.Next up is the superior half of Grindhouse, Tarantino's Death Proof. Kurt Russell, also badass once more, stars as a psycho stuntman, who stalks and kills young women with his vintage cars. Among his prey are a group of Texas girls (Vannessa Ferlito, Jordan Ladd, Sydney Tamilla Potheier, and McGowan) and a group of Hollywood startlets (Rosario Dawson, Tracie Thoms, Mary Elizabeth Winstead and Zoe Bell). Filmgoers who want nothing with buckets of blood violence in every minute of the film need not apply. Yes, Death Proof is violent, but Tarantino works his classic magic in this segment. The infamous diner scene that introduced Reservoir Dogs is basically recreated by one group of girls. The characters constantly talk pop culture, another Tarantino charm. Bell, who is really a stuntwoman in real life, acts quite well, keeping mind that she's not really an actor. The film ends with a 20 minute car chase that belongs with the great ones like Vanishing Point. Maybe it's just because I'm a huge Tarantino fan, but Death Proof really beats out Planet Terror.In between the two films, fake grindhouse trailers are inserted. Rodriguez opens with Machete, a film about a Mexican vigilante, before his segment. In between the films, Edgar Wright (Hot Fuzz) presents Don't, a nod to British horror films. Rob Zombie (The Devil's Rejects) presents Werewolf Women of the SS (title pretty much explains it all). And Eli Roth (Hostel) gives us Thanksgiving, a parody of slasher flicks. The trailers are very funny and very entertaining. Guys like Nicolas Cage, Danny Trejo, Cheech Marin, Will Arnett, and Simon Pegg stop by to say hello during the trailer as well. Also, in the two films, Michael Parks returns to reprise his awesome character of Texas Ranger Earl McGraw. His son, James, also reprises the role of his son.So, in closing, your grindhouse experience won't end when this movie's over. You'll be so tempted to see what the real thing was like, this film basically just started it.",10,0,1,8 August 2008
The Happening," If this is the worst M Night can do...he's a good director.
","I have always been a fan of M Night Shymalan and have always taken some ridicule for it after The Village and Lady in the Water, which I personally enjoyed. I already took criticism for The Happening. And yes, I will admit, it was M Night's worst film yet...but that dosen't make it bad.M Night's latest effort stars Mark Whalberg as a Philadelphia science teacher. Once again, M Night casts a great lead role as Whalberg follows in the steps of Bruce Willis, Mel Gibson, Joaquin Phoenix and Paul Giamatti. Whalberg made this film interesting and fun. Shymalan tries to join in on the fun with his plot which features people in the Northeast killing themselves in gruesome ways. One of the reasons this is not Shymalan's best work is that here he tries to frighten us by showing these depictions of death. However, sometimes they just come off silly. For example, one man starts a lawn mower and intentionally allows it to run over him. In addition, one of the things that made M Night's other films successful was his quirky characters, like Abigail Breslin in Signs, when she portrayed Gibson's daughter who had a fear of tap water. Shymalan tries this tactic again in The Happening, but the characters, such as an old lady separated from the rest of society, come off even sillier.The Happening does redeem itself with its 'monster'. When the carnage first occurs, the initial blame is attributed to terrorists. Later, it is thought that plants have been communicating with each other. Fed up with our treatment, the plants release toxins inside of them, causing humanity to fall one by one. Shymalan passes this test with flying colors. It's almost like he presents us an interesting version of An Inconvenient Truth. Also, Shymalan asks us the question, 'How do you fight and flee from something...when you don't know what it is? It is, indeed, Shymalan's worst effort yet. But when he releases his next film...it's gonna be one heck of a redemption.",7,3,8,3 July 2008
Transformers: Revenge of the Fallen," Robot Scenes=10/10 The Rest? Not So Much
","I'm 17, so I was supposed to love Transformers: Revenge of the Fallen right? It had everything from Optimus Prime to Megan Fox. What's not to like? The answer: plenty.Don't get me wrong, I'm a Michael Bay fan. I loved Armageddon and Bad Boys, and I was a fan of the first Transformers film. But Bay messed up big time with the sequel. Normally, I'd try to find ways to defend Bay, but this is his fault. The skill he showed in his previous summer blockbusters is gone. Even though Bay screws up big time, it's not entirely his fault.While the robot cast is terrific (Peter Cullen should get an Oscar nom for his portrayal of Optimus), most of the human cast is dreadful. Don't get me wrong, I like Shia LaBeouf, but he's really trying too hard in this flick. He stutters half his lines and when he's not doing that, he's just yelling nonsense. As if that's not bad enough, he gets more Razzie help with his annoying parents and an equally annoying roommate. On the contrary, the Transformers girls, Fox and Isabel Lucas, are great additions to this film. For the ladies, there's Josh Duhamel and Tyrese Gibson, but he barely gets any time. And John Tuturro, genius in the first film, is superb, but by the time he hits the screen (about an hour and a half into the film) it's a lost cause.Even the robots are not safe from error. There's these two annoying robots who are bound to stir up some type of controversy. They are annoying, rude, and unnecessary. In addition, the main villain, the titular Fallen, is introduced, but then forgotten about and not revisited until an hour later. Rest assured, this happens numerous times, which also leads to questions about the length (a crappy 2 1/2 hours) Overall, Transformers 2 was a big, loud mess. As far as robot movies go, Terminator Salvation was much better. Call me what you will, but I did not like it. Everyone I know loved it, but maybe that's another thing. The hype machine was overflowed, so maybe that's why I was disappointed. But who knows? Maybe you're asking the wrong guy. Need proof? While my friends waited for this, I'm just counting the days until Inglourious Basterds comes out. But heed my warning. Don't transform your cash into a ticket for a crappy movie",3,3,9,3 July 2009
Stranger Than Fiction," Worst. Movie. Ever.
","I sat through Son of the Mask. I survived Spider Man 3. And I barely made through The Ring. But Stranger Than Fiction is the worst film I've ever seen. I'm a huge fan of Will Ferrell, but really, Will, what the heck were you thinking when you accepted this? It sounds promising: a comedy starring Will Ferrell, Dustin Hoffman, Queen Latifah, Maggie Gyllanhall and Emma Thompson? I'm in! But it the end, the film is a big steaming pile of...y'know.The plot is promising too. Ferrell plays a depressed IRS agent who has his life narrated by a suicidal author (Thompson) who plans to kill him. While we could've had an Anchorman-esquire comedy with that, we are instead put through visions of Thompson trying to kill herself, Ferrell acting lonely and depressed, and Gyllanhall just being plain annoying. Latifah is given next to nothing to do but roll her eyes at Thompson, and Hoffman does nothing but mumble his few words. I didn't laugh at one scene, unless you count a small chuckle during one of the previews.I know people praise Ferrell for his performance in this, but I personally hated it. Ferrell sulks on the screen, looking like he wants to chuck himself off a bridge half the time. I like seeing Will Ferrell prancing in an elf outfit, not sulking around Chicago getting into half hearted arguments with a tattooed baker. Overall, a huge disappointment in the career of Will Ferrell. I can only he will recover from it.",1,6,19,31 May 2008
Hancock," Makes Wild Wild West look Oscar-Worthy
","Wild Wild West was OK, but still Will Smith's worst film. However, Hancock makes Wild Wild West look like I Am Legend. Will Smith lumbers across the screen as a drunken superhero, not looking like he cares at all about doing this film. As far as superhero films go, this one belong in the trash can along with Batman and Robin, the Eric Bana Hulk, and Superman III and IV.Smith plays the title character, who really dosen't care what Los Angeles thinks of him. Kind of like Spider Man, except Hancock seems so reluctant to protect these people. Plus, in Spider Man, it was the media that hated him and the people who love him. Here, it's all hate for Hancock. Enter Jason Bateman, who was pretty much the one redeeming quality about this film. As a ordinary guy who tries to improve Hancock's image, Bateman shines in a (almost) lead role like this. Charlize Theron is cast as his pretty wife, who is given pretty much nothing to do for the first hour, except sulk and complain.The first half hour of this film was all right. It goes upside down when Hancock has to go to jail. There a disgusting scene I won't mention occurs. Next thing you know, Hancock is a changed man, thanks to Bateman. While it was all right the first time, Smith overplays it, and unfortunately becomes downright annoying. Enter an even stupider subplot with Theron, and the films goes down the drain. It's hard for me, a Will Smith fan, to say this, but this film did the impossible: it made Will Smith extremely annoying.",2,33,58,1 July 2008
WALL·E," What happened Pixar?
","I liked Toy Story, Cars, and Finding Nemo. Ratatouille was OK. I didn't care much for A Bug's Life or The Incredibles, but that's just me. But Wall-e was an endurance test. It was to see if a person can really watch an annoying film for an hour and a half without falling asleep. You won't fall asleep though. The film is just a loud montage of sound effects, so that will keep your eyes open.The Wall-e character saves this film. It's one of the cutest things I've seen. He's a little trash collecting robot who roams an abandoned Earth collecting trash and collectibles left behind by the humans, who have disappeared into space and have become fat and lazy. The first 20 minutes of the film were basically I Am Legend with a robot instead of Will Smith and sandstorms instead of vampires. Then a robot named Eve comes to gather a plant on Earth so the humans can go home. Wall-e falls in love with this robot. This good and everything, but their 'conversations' are unbearable. After a five minute conversation between these two, I had a migraine. The film then moves to space, where it just goes downhill from there.Wall-e could have been another Pixar classic, but instead goes down the drain. The human cast is given little, if nothing to do. The usually funny Jeff Garlin acts like a moron in his few minutes on screen. Fred Willard is given a pointless role as a CEO of a company. But I must give props to Sigourney Weaver. Hearing her voice as the ship's computer brought back memories of the Alien films.So, to all you amateur film makers out there, I say this. If you ever feel like your latest film is going nowhere, take a badly tuned radio and place it next to techno music video. Film that for an hour and a half. Who knows? People sure liked it in Wall-e. Maybe they'll like it when you do it, too.",1,30,88,16 July 2008
