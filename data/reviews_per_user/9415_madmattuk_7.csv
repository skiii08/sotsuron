Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," Rubbish, I'm afraid
","Far below the standard of episodes IV to VI, the Phantom Menace failed to impress on just about every possible level.After half an hour or so I found myself admiring the scenery in the background (which was admitedly quite good) not exactly the sign of a gripping movie!I'll be interested to see how episodes II and III handle Darth Vader's turn to the Dark Side...",4,0,1,12 July 2001
Minority Report," Philip K Dick captured perfectly
","I can't remember when I last enjoyed a Spielberg film (Indiana Jones, probably) and I certainly can't remember when I last enjoyed Tom Cruise in anything; but, somehow, I found Minority Report very entertaining.
Yes, it was too long, the solving of the mystery was a bit hackneyed and Spielberg couldn't resist a scene of sickening sentimentality (the precog revealing how Sean's life would have been). Despite all that it captured the atmosphere of Dick's novels/stories much better than (say) Blade Runner. Imaginative drug abuse, a plot straight out of 40s PI fiction, a deep underlying morality - all recreated perfectly.",9,0,0,8 July 2002
Memento," Strange thought? (*spoilers*)
","In a way the excellent Memento reminded me of the equally excellentDraughtsman's Contract.  In both the hero believed that order and systemswould provide the answer to any mystery, in both they were wrong anddangerously so.In both films the hero's reliance on system makes them predictable and opensthem up for exploitation.The bottom line?  If you enjoyed Memento try to rent the Draughtman's Contract you will almost certainly enjoy it too.",9,1,3,8 June 2003
Shaun of the Dead," An American Werewolf it wasn't
","I'll have to admit to never having seen Spaced, but I have seen an awful lot of zombie movies.Shaun of the Dead started promisingly with a tacky 70s style synthesiser horror soundtrack merging into The Specials' Ghost Town, but then rather overdid the slackers/commuters as zombies angle for the first fifteen minutes or so.It picked up however and deftly  juggled horror with comedy with pathos for the rest of the movie.Worth watching if you like zombie movies but not nearly as consistently funny as An American Werewolf in London.  (Plus none of the women were a patch on Jenny Agutter).",6,1,3,9 April 2004
Finding Nemo," Four out of four
","Not my mark but its position among Pixar films.  Lacking the invention ofMonsters Inc and the strong characterisation of the Toy Story films, I foundFinding Nemo slightly disappointing.I'm sure children will love it, but despite some visually beautiful scenes(especially the jelly fish) I don't think there's much here for the older viewer.Not a bad film exactly (I gave it 7) but not up to the standard of the other three.",7,0,1,12 October 2003
Star Wars: Episode II - Attack of the Clones," Better than Episode 1 but still not very good.
","It looks as though George Lucas has learned from his mistakes in Episode 1. This time around he's upped the action, reduced the politics and brought Episode 2 more into line with the feel of the original trilogy.Clearly this in itself is enough to keep the fans happy but it does not make Attack of the Clones a good movie by wider standards.  Stilted dialogue, wooden acting and a strangely washed-out feel to most of the CGI graphics made the first half of this film in particular, a chore to watch.  Can anyone genuinely think of a memorable quote from this one?Episode 2 did just enough to keep me hanging on for Episode 3 - let's hope George Lucas hires a decent script-writer next time round!",6,0,0,20 May 2002
Enemy at the Gates," I wanted to like this but...
","I am a keen student of the Eastern Front and married to a Ukrainian whose father fought in 'The Great Patriotic War' so I was very much looking forward to this movie...But.  It was absolutely awful!  Every effort was made to ensure that the military hardware was correct but absolutely no effort had been made to to research how Russians would have acted (or in many cases looked) during the war.<WARNING, SPOILER>One particularly risible episode: A small boy, Sacha, has been spying on the Germans but he's caught and hanged. Later a political commisar is atttempting to get the boy's mother to join an evacuation of civilians prior to an expected German offensive. The mother refuses. In a 'noble' gesture the commisar lies and says that Sacha has defected to the Germans.
Now, in real life the mother would have been (a) terrified of reprisals but also (b) mortified that her son did not die fighting the fascist scum. In EatG she is overjoyed that her son is safe with the Germans and leaves her home without further delay.Still it was marginally better than Saving Private Ryan.",4,1,3,17 May 2001
