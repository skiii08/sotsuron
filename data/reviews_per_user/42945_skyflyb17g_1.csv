Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," I think George Lucas messed up!
","When I heard Lucas was going to make THREE MORE STAR WARS MOVIES I was really excited.  Then as I started thinking about it I realized that the true and original trilogy was just about perfect.  Would these new films mess all of that up?  My sister said, don't worry it's George Lucas.  I thought about that and was then fully reassured that the new films would be great. When I did go to the movie I was shocked.  It (to me) didn't have any star wars feel to it.  I was at one time a star wars freak.  I think most people go through that stage and then are fans for life.  Some however, are diehard fans. They will stick by Lucas's side through it all.  I am just a fan and was very disappointed in STAR WARS, Episode one.  The acting was terrible, the special effects were way overdone and Lucas lost my faith.  Now those fans who liked phantom menace may be saying that I am no true fan saying this about a star wars movie.  Well, Maybe it's this star wars movie that's saying i am not a real fan. Sorry George. --AdiosP.S. I was also pretty mad that he took one of the best lines from the original trilogy and put into his cash machine movie.  The line is, a jawa saying, 'HOODENIE!'",1,24,44,23 July 2000
