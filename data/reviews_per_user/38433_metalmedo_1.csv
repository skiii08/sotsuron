Borat: Cultural Learnings of America for Make Benefit Glorious Nation of Kazakhstan," A Total Conflict To The Truth ... But Actually interesting !
","This movie probably gets you to laugh hard, I definitely did ! ,but yet very interestingly strange !, As The producers Are Jews, you are about to see a movie promoting Jews, not that i have anything against it, but actually it is more than I thought it would be.The movie stands up for Jews and makes you feel that they are the kindest human beings, and anyone against them is either a fool or a total retard! This is an Anti-Muslim movie, However, they didn't mention that Borat is a Muslim in any way.And guess what, Muslims in Kazakhstan don't actually F..K their sisters! and they DO know who Jesus (Peace be upon him) is ! I give it a 10 for the laugh.. A Zero for the truth.. But it's definitely worth watching..",1,6,13,24 December 2006
