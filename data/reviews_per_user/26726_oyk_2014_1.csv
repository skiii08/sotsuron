Conquest 1453," Just Garbage
","Everybody speaks Turkish in a historical movie? I could go with English since it's international language, but Turkish? The most part of the sets is poorly made in green screen, that makes it obvious as fake. The acting? Please..I was laughing half the time..It's ridiculous. Well for one part the photography could be considered satisfying, if there wasn't that much of procession in the computer. The only good thing is that the Turkish culture is well seen and presented but I wouldn't say the same for the Hellenic or Latin of the time. In a few words I expected a lot more from that movie and I got really disappointed. The way I see it, this movie only fulfills the standards as a propaganda trying to satisfy the Turkish people by showing inaccurate Historical stuff and emblazoning the Turkish power of the time and the great(?) Turkish culture.",1,32,60,13 September 2012
