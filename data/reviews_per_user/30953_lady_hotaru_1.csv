Blade Runner 2049," A very good sequel to a classic
","I am a big fan of Blade Runner and I was excited to see BR2049 but I didn't come into this sequel with too many high expectations, fearing to be let down. I love Denis Villeneuve's work with a passion and when I saw Arrival last year, I was very confident in what he could do with sci-fi. I must admit that from the first frame of BR2049, I was sold. The few callbacks to the original movie you can catch here and here were magnificent. The cinematography is absolutely insane. I saw it in IMAX and it was one of the most breathtaking visuals I've seen in a very long time. The lighting, the set designs, they all brought me back to the feelings I have when I watch the first movie. I've read that Villeneuve wanted most of the props and locations to feel real and thank god he did. Not only Roger Deakins's work is going to earn him a well deserved Oscar, he teams up perfectly with Villeneuve's style and they make magic together. As for the music, I like that it stands on its own, I didn't want them to copy the Vangelis score too much and they do just enough references. I think Ryan Gosling was the perfect leading man for K. Even when he must be cold and serious, I feel that he still keeps his charm and magnetism intact. Ana De Armas was a pleasant surprise, bringing a bit of sensitivity as Joi. I also liked the Luv character, played by Sylvia Hoeks, and Dave Bautista. And let's not forget Harrison Ford, who did a pretty good job playing Deckhard again. You must go into this movie as an experience, not watching a big blockbuster with big explosions all the time. You must know the first story to really enjoy it but you must also not compare it too much. It's a contemplative journey through dark cities, snow and ashy deserts. It's a movie that raises many questions but doesn't give all the answers. Just like the original, it's not perfect. I thought it was way too long and some scenes almost made me laugh because they were a bit ridiculous and predictable. But in the end, I strongly feel that Villeneuve won his bet and he proved without a doubt that he's one of the best directors of the last 20 years.",9,10,23,7 October 2017
