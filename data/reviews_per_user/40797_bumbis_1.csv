The Perks of Being a Wallflower," Very disappointed
","After reading the book and enjoying it, this movie was extremely disappointing and felt like a misrepresentation of the original workFirst off the relationship between Charlie and his Aunt wasn't nearly showcased enough and every relating event up to the reveal at the ending was far to vague to awaken any emotion. Helen was his best friend, and that was one of the most important details. All the dark and troubling feelings, and the real anxiety that Charlie went through (like the lsd come down, the depression after the Mary Elizabeth breakup, and so on) were just left out or underplayed.Charlie felt very distant and more of a generic boy rather than the intelligent but deeply troubled person he is portrayed as in the book.The relationship between Bill and Charlie was oversimplified as well. the dialogue between them at bill's played a pretty big part in the revaluation at the end and that was completely cut. they were also just kinda awkward together in the movie.The scene where Charlie and Patric laugh their asses off from the picnic story was cut as well, which is a shame.Everything that made the book so interesting was sucked out until we're left with a skeleton in the shape of 'The perks of being a wallflower' but the content being just words here and there and some of the pretty quotes.Read the book!",2,1,1,28 April 2020
