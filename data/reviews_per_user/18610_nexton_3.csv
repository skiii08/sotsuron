Captain Phillips," Decent film, decent actors!
","Just like usual, Tom hanks as a big Hollywood star gives the best out of it and for me its a good act from him. The starstruck effect from him doesn't change much since he got 2 consecutive Oscars.On the other side, all actors in film also give something special for the film, seriousness, tension, deadpan (this for Tom Hanks), and also grief.I also give a good credit for the Somali actor who plays the main antagonist here, Barkhad Abdi, and the rest of his henchmen. The one thing that make this film just a film (it doesn't show the actual event...in my opinion) is how mushy the the robbers in the film, they fights each other, debates each other, and blames each other, they are too mushy to the crew of the ship. It's like the avarice they have just for a showcase in the film, not the actual event. They yammers the group until they are all shot and died, except the leader. But again, this is just film, so there is no use too regret that part.And.....the last note.....is it anyone there just like me.......Have more sympathy to the bad side than all of those NAVY people???",7,1,2,23 March 2014
Elf," best role's Ferrel
","This film was hilarious for children or adult. Will Ferrel acted so well and made laugh very hard. The plot wasn't so excellent, it's an easy quest for the story. Actually, i only see Ferrel in maybe 3 or 4 movies, most of them in minor roles, and this was his best appearance that i ever known.I bet Favreau directed well for this movie. Two thumbs up for his first big project movie. maybe there's one thing to criticize that the love between Buddy and his father it was showed too clich√© and it was too easy to solve it. Wish more complicated for this scene. but, this was a great movie of the year.",8,2,2,25 September 2005
Bram Stoker's Dracula," Bram Stoker would be disappointed if he's alive!!
","I read the novel and finished it about one week and the next day i watched the movie.Well, i just want to say that if i watched the movie without read the novel first i would have given a better rating maybe 8.Its not a bad movie but very unfaithful and disrespect the novel. I am disappointed with this flicks because the title is the straightforward 'BRAM STOKER'S Dracula'. Bram himself should be regretting himself to wrote the good book and abused after his rest in the grave.***SPOILER***WARNING!!!1. The film clearly abused the novel with humanizing the Dracula, how the Dracula feels regret when turning Mina into vampire and all other scenes. While in the novel Dracula is something a curse creature, unforgiven, cursed by God, inhumane, heartless, deserves to die, and has a childish frame of mind.2. In the novel there are no explanations about the Dracula having lovers or wives or whatever. So turning Mina into some kind of reincarnation of the passed Dracula lover is something ridiculous. And the film even worse makes the love relations between Dracula and Mina into the main topics is disgusting.3. The novel shows the very deep modesty relation between Mina and Jonathan, they very loves each other, very respecting each other, they feel their emotions each other, they show their grieves deeply if one another has the problems, and it's affecting us...REALLY. But the film turns Mina into an unfaithful wife with her desire to the Dracula and they even almost make love in Mina's desire...MY GOSH!!!!SPOILER ENDS!!Finally, i understand if a film isn't exactly words by words with the novel version, but if they changed the main topic and the heart of the novel which is the beast Dracula in to something humane Dracula, thats too much. And turning the faithful and religious Mina into the unfaithful Mina in the film, thats just unthinkable.For the casual beholders and yet to read the book, it better to watch the film first then read the book so you wont be upset. Even better After watch the film and don;t do the reading, it will make you feel cheated.But for the beholders that have no desire to read the book, its the best for them, the film could be a fun thing. The pesky beholder (just like me) is the one that after read the book then watched the movie. Just sad thing.",6,0,1,1 July 2013
