Once Upon a Time... in Hollywood," Easy-going movie
","Despite this movie not having a plot or storyline, It's still vary watchable with its funny 10 minute scripts scattered throughout the film is set in the late 60s Hollywood pop culture,
Yes the movie is fun and Watchable in part,
It's not something to be taken seriously It's more of a kick back chill out have some beers kind of movie..
It's a movie with great scenes
but it's not a great movie as a whole
But the individual scenes are like mini movies within themselves,
With lots of little storylines going on at the same time all paying homage to the Quentin Tarantino universe,
Not Quinton's finest work but is worth seeing just to see DiCaprio and Pitt ( Rich and Cliff)
By the end Of the movie you feel like you know Rich and cliff vary well..",7,0,3,31 August 2019
