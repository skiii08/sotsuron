Minority Report," Great during a heatwave
",The effects in this movie are very good.  Sadly that is the best that can be said about this train wreck of a movie.  The only thing that kept me in the theater was the air conditioning inside and the heat wave outside.,1,5,9,29 June 2002
Ocean's Eleven," Utter disappointment
","If all you want is to see Brad, Julia and George this is your movie.  If all you want is to be in a warm place for a while, this movie will do in a pinch.  If you re looking for a quality remake of a decent movie, save your money, wait for the video to come out and rent it.  The effects are so so and there is just no on screen chemistry between the stars.",Null,0,1,7 December 2001
Quantum of Solace," Save your money and rent the DVD
","I was entirely disappointed with this installment of the 007 movies. They have done away with all the neat gadgets that Q would make for Bond. No bullet proof car. No mini mines. No nothing. They have stripped almost all the humor (there was only two laughs from the audience when I was there). Bond would charm the girls with a double entendre, trade barbs with the bad guys just before defeating them then go off with the girl. That is all gone. They changed the opening. The moving eye and Bond shooting is in the closing credits. The silhouetted girls swimming during the theme song is gone. There is no lead in we are just thrown into an action scene. I think that in the entire 2 hours there was about 10 minutes of dialogue. The rest was shooting, fighting, one car chase, a boat chase and a dogfight. Basically it is a generic action film script (think the Jason Bourne films). If that is your thing then this is your film. But if you are looking for a traditional Bond film stay away this ain't it.",3,4,6,15 November 2008
8 Mile," Bad movie!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
","There are no words that can adequately reflect just how bad this movie was. I was actually wishing I had rescheduled my root-canal for the day I saw this train wreck of a movie.  Think of the O.J. trial and Cop Rock, this movie is not nearly as good as they were.  Movies like this are why they no longer put money back guaranteed on your ticket.  Run, save yourselves it's too late for me but there is still time for you to avoid this movie.",1,5,16,9 November 2002
Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets," Very good movie!!
","An amazing movie.  It appears to be put together a bit more hastily than the first, but overall it was a very enjoyable 2+ hours.  The only issue I had with the movie was that it left a few unanswered questions at the end.  I can't say what they are because of the spoilers rule, but there are only a very few and it didn't hurt the overall movie.",Null,0,0,15 November 2002
Shrek," This is a must see movie
","There are so few family movies anymore that this one is a must see.  There are moments during the movie that you could forget that what you are seeing is animation.  Shrek has the cute characters for the kids, and the inside jokes for the adults.  I saw this with a group of teenagers and they really enjoyed themselves.",Null,0,0,18 May 2001
Gangs of New York," Not quite as good as a root canal but real close
","The best that can be said about this movie is that no one part was better or worse than another, it is just consistently bad.  It is sad that with talent Scorsese directing and Daniel Day-Lewis and Cameron Diaz staring this movie could not be salvaged.But at least the coming attractions were good!",1,5,12,3 January 2003
