Iron Man 3," A Low Down Dirty Shane
","I'm not going to go into the specifics of what's wrong with this film (just read all the other reviews) I'm just going to state Iron Man faced a villain he couldn't defeat...Shane Black.This will always be 'Shane's Iron Man', a pale imitation of Jon Favreau's creations that preceded and that were so well integrated successfully into Joss Whedon's Avengers.They only hope for our hero is to once again rise like the Phoenix from the ashes in Whedon's Avengers 2 and coax RDJ back in the suit once more for Iron Man 4, this time with Favreau at the directorial helm, we fans deserve it.",1,27,57,4 May 2013
