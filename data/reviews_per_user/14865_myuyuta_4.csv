The Blair Witch Project," How much can a movie suck???
","I went to see 'The Blair Witch Project' at an 11:30pm showing with the hope that it would scare the hell out of my girlfriend and my friends. Not only was 'BWP' very unprofessional (some people say that was one of its advantages, but I really don't think so), but it wasn't scary at all. Two of my friends fell asleep watching it (really). For 80 minutes I thought that the scary part was coming up and then it ended. Hugely disappointing.",1,19,38,6 March 2002
Taxi Driver," the perfect flick for anyone who has any kind of angst in their heart
","Just excellent. Look at the characters: the disturbed Travis, the little whore Iris, the slimy pimp, the squeaky clean Betsy, Travis' clients- the scum of the city, and the politicians who represent the glorified scum, and last but not least Martin Scorsese whose character was in the movie only for about a minute but that was more than enough to freak Travis out even more. And the final sequence when Travis 'cleans up' was just unbelievable. If you have any kind of angst in your heart, this is one film that you just can't miss.",10,0,0,18 February 2002
Platoon," THE war movie
","In general, I'm not a fan of war movies. But 'Platoon' is literally a war movie. Other 'war movies' seem to concentrate a lot on the soldiers' life before the war, their families, etc. In 'Platoon', the only civillian characters are the Vietnamese. The film is powerful and gripping. It is also quite gory, which is a turn-off to some people. But, after all, there is a lot of gore in war, right? Tom Berenger's portrayal of Sgt. Barnes was magnificent. Willem Dafoe and John C. McGinley weren't half-bad either.    In response to those two guys who criticized it(hockeyguy and Mike Fleming), I think you don't know what you're talking about. First of all, I don't believe soldiers would use politically correct terms to identify the enemy('We wasted three Asian people' would sound strange). Hence, the frequent use of 'dinks' and 'gooks'.     We Were Soldiers- accurate? The US was promoting peace in Nam, right? Please. If you've heard about the My Lai Incident(it was mentioned in the film when soldiers talked about Charlie Company), you'll know  that Oliver Stone could have gone even further in his depiction of raping and pillaging. I've read that some soldiers refused to participate in such acts but they didn't want to 'spoil the fun' for the others. So the only unrealistic thing in this case was that Charlie Sheen's character saved the little girl from getting gang-raped. As far as the 'awful actors' part, I guess it's just a matter of taste. Anyway, unless you faint when you see blood, 'Platoon' is a must-see.            9.5/10",10,0,1,18 December 2002
Ben-Hur," Lord of the Rings' granddaddy
","There are many parallels between Ben-Hur and Lord of the Rings (let's take 'Return of the King', for the sake of the argument). The obvious one is that they're both ridiculously long. I mean, wouldn't you rather watch 30 less minutes of Charlton Heston's over-the-top theatrics? Even then Ben-Hur would top 3 hours and be considered an overly long epic.   Another thing is that both flicks won 11 Oscars and I'm pretty sure neither deserved that many. I mean, Heston won an Academy Award for THAT? And LOTR's clean sweep obviously happened because the first two were not taken seriously enough by the Academy. I didn't see how 'Return of the King' was better (or worse, for that matter) than the first two. Perhaps there's a rule that every movie over 3 hours has to win Best Picture and a bucketload of other Oscars- see also Titanic, Schindler's List, Dances With Wolves, Gandhi... I'm sure there are many many more. OK, that's enough ranting for now. Apart from the always unintentionally funny Heston, the performances are good. I especially liked Stephen Boyd as Messala. The chariot race sequence was fantastic and the ending would appeal to every Christian on the face of the Earth. As an Atheist, I just found it chuckle-worthy. In a nutshell, if you have nothing to do for a whole day and don't mind Charlton Heston, you see this. It's pretty good although a little overpraised.",Null,0,3,2 March 2004
