The Sound of Music," A timeless Classic
",I've watched this film more times than I can count and why? Well it's a beautiful film and a movie that always puts me in a good mood. Julie Andrews plays Maria who goes to the Captain Von Trapp's household to be a frauline to help with his children. Of course it's a musical so there is lot's of singing but these songs are so nice and give me goosebumps every time. It really is like a fairy tale but that's what makes it so special. It's a very long film but guaranteed worth it! In my opinion of the best musicals ever!,10,2,2,8 November 2018
The Ring," Not your usual horror film
","The Ring is definitely not your normal horror film. It's not your usual horror film with teenagers and weapons and predictable scare jumps.
The Ring is about Rachel Keller who is investigating the mysterious horrific death of her niece, Katie. What emerges is truly scary and dark. It really makes you think and go to the dark side a bit. Some scenes are quite disturbing but really the whole film is disturbing. I absolutely recommend it. It will play on your mind for a long time!",9,2,2,9 November 2018
The Notebook," Beautiful and a true Romantic Film
","I've seen The Notebook more times than I care to write. This movie is one of my favorites. The Notebook is one of the best romance films I've seen. It tells the story in flashback of Noah and Allie. They both come from very different backgrounds but that doesn't stop them falling in love. Of course Allie being from a rich upper class family,her parents discourage the relationship between her and Noah. They portray a love that every girl would love to have. It seems that no matter what paths they both go down they are always drawn back to each other. Noah never stopped loving Allie and vice a versa. I love it when they are both on the boat together feeding the ducks, it really is a beautiful scene. In the film you see Noah as now an older man reading to a woman who is now the older Allie,so it is showing that their love never died and they stick by each other til the end. I really think people enjoy this film because it really portrays true love and the true meaning of finding that one person you're destined to be with. Have the tissues ready!",10,1,2,31 January 2017
The Bodyguard," A great film, underrated in my opinion
","I don't know why The Bodyguard hasn't got a higher rating than 6 stars?! I think that this film maybe only appeals to a certain audience. Whitney Houston plays the part of Rachel Marron a singing superstar who has recently became the victim of an obsessed stalker. Kevin Costner plays the part of her newly appointed bodyguard, Frank Farmer. Without going too much into it, Rachel and Frank end up falling for each other. However because Frank is hired to be her bodyguard, the lines get blurred as Rachel wants more. The music in the film in my opinion play a big role. As most of the songs were hits of Whitney Houston and the soundtrack was very successful. I didn't like the albino stalker guy in it, he was very creepy. Overall I love this film, it may not be for everyone but I've seen a lot worse.",8,6,10,6 February 2017
The Aviator," Another amazing Leonardo DiCaprio Film!
","Wow another amazing performance from Leo. I must say this film never interested me but I watched it on Netflix tonight and I thought it was great. Leonardo never ceases to amaze me. He plays the role of Howard Hughes who was a filmmaker then a aviator. Howard Hughes suffered from OCD and was known for his eccentric lifestyle. Leonardo did a great job of portraying him and the scenes where he is in a deep depression in his movie room were acted so well. I also loved the costumes which I think portrayed that time period perfectly. Especially Kate Beckinsale as Ava Gardner with the hair and hats, was spot on. I think this film was great and very enjoyable. It's sad to see the character of Howard Hughes declining but it is inspiring to see how much ambition he had. I really recommended this film, it is rather long but worth it.",8,2,2,3 February 2017
Grease," Grease deserves more than 7
",Grease is a classic and a movie that never gets old! I think most people have seen it but just incase well it stars Olivia Newton John as Sandy Olsen who has come to Rydell High in California from Australia. She spent the summer with Danny Zuko played by John Travolta. The movie shows Danny trying to win back Sandy and the experience along the way with lots of colourful characters. It's a musical so there's lots of singing but the songs are fantastic. I think the dance scenes were choreographed really well and the actors perform so well. Especially John Travolta in the Greased Lightning routine. Great film and great soundtrack too!,10,5,6,9 November 2018
The Revenant," Amazing and another great Leo performance
","I watched this film on blu ray and it was amazing. I'm a huge fan of Leonardo DiCaprio and this film didn't disappoint. I loved the scenery in the film, it really was spectacular. Leonardo DiCaprio plays Hugh Glass who is like an explorer back in 1823. He has a half cherokee son. He is left for dead after being attacked by a huge bear and his group doesn't want him to slow him down.
Tom Hardy is a villian in the film. Then he goes on a very eventful journey of self survival. He really goes through very harsh weather and gets pushed to his limits. I couldn't take my eyes from the screen. Leonardo plays this part so well, in my opinion he was 100 percent deserving of the oscar. One of his best roles!",10,1,2,9 November 2018
American Beauty," One of the best films ever!
","I doubt by now many people haven't seen American Beauty by now. There is so much I love about this movie. It tells the story of the Burnham family who are dysfunctional. Lester is not happy in any aspect of his life and his wife, Carolyn, who is a Realtor pretends everything is fine. Their daughter Jane is a typical high school girl who keeps a lot to herself. After Lester meets Jane's friend Angela his life changes. Jane's life also changes when she meets Ricky the new next door neighbor. As the film goes on you see Lester change and become more confident and more assertive to his wife and daughter. I love how the film touches on problems that every family could face but does it in away that makes you want to keep on watching. I think the soundtrack had a big part to do with it for example the music that plays when they watch Ricky's video of the plastic bag. Although the end of the film is quite sad, I think in a way Lester died happy because before it happened Angela asked him how he was and he said ' I'm great'. It's definitely a film that looks at the darker side of family life in suburban America. If you haven't seen it by now then please do, you won't regret it!",9,1,2,5 February 2017
Dirty Dancing," Never gets boring!
","I have seen Dirty Dancing so many times. I remember watching it on VHS when I was 8 years old. Dirty Dancing to me is a film that never gets boring. It is the story of 'Baby' who goes on holiday with her family and falls in love with Johnny Castle who is a dancing teacher. Baby is the youngest of 2 girls and her overprotective parents have her life planned for her. Baby first meets Johnny at the dancing club at the holiday resort. Baby falls for him and he falls for her. I love how Baby starts as a quiet, unsure girl who then becomes a woman who is confident and carefree. You can tell that Baby and Johnny come from very different backgrounds but Baby sees through that in Johnny. I love the romantic part of the film as much as the dancing. The scene at the end is amazing. Everyone will know the 'Nobody puts Baby in the corner' line. The dance at the end was done fantastic, its definitely my favorite scene.",10,1,2,3 February 2017
The Pianist," Very well acted but depressing.
",I watched this film for the first time yesterday. I knew it was about World war 2 but I didn't realize specifically which parts. Adrian Brody is amazing in this film playing the part of Wladyslaw Szpilman. It reminded me very much like Schindlers List not only because it covers the same themes and time period but also because it really made me appreciate the time in which I live. The way people got treated during that time was horrific and heartbreaking. This movie in my opinion had some very confronting scenes such as Adrian Brody's character getting brutally whipped by a German soldier and also a man getting thrown off the balcony from his wheelchair. These scenes for me were quite hard to watch. Overall though this film was good to watch. I can't imagine it would be easy to act those parts and put yourself into those situations but it was acted very well and very genuine. If you managed to watch Schindler's List then this film you will be able to relate to.,8,0,0,28 January 2017
Django Unchained," Violent but entertaining
","I haven't seen many of Quentin Taratino's films but I must say I did enjoy this film. I really enjoyed Christoph Waltz's acting. Jamie Foxx plays Django in the film, a black slave who got separated from his wife. He embraces on a journey with Dr. Schultz played by Waltz. They go looking for 2 brothers who Dr. Schultz has a warrant for. When Leonardo DiCaprio's character comes into the film he is watching 2 slaves fight Mandingo which is a brutal fighting that leads to death. Leonardo is really good in it and in my opinion his acting abilities show no limit. The only thing I didn't like about this film was the excessive use of the N***** word and the scenes of violence including the scene where a slave is killed by dogs. But overall was a great film and great acting by all the cast.",8,0,3,1 February 2017
Magic Mike XXL," Nothing magic about this film!
","I watched Magic Mike XXL tonight. What a waste of time! I do like Channing Tatum but in this film he was lacking well everything. He stumbles through the film, always wearing the same backward cap. Apart from the dancing scenes, the film is very mundane. I was fast forwarding through most of it. I also didn't like the choice of actors like Kevin Nash and Amber Heard, in my opinion they can't act! Some of the music was good but overall boring.",5,2,2,25 August 2017
There's Something About Mary," Worth10 Stars
","TSAM is absolutely hilarious! From start to finish this movie makes me laugh so much. From Ben Stiller as Ted who is still in love with his school crush Mary ten years after school has ended. He hires Pat Healy a Private investigator to track her down but then Pat falls for her. My favourite scenes are the ones with Warren, he is hilarious! All the characters are so funny and this film will have you in a laughing fit.",10,0,0,9 November 2018
12 Years a Slave," Confronting and Heartbreaking
","I just watched this film for the first time on Netflix today. I found this movie very confronting and at times horrific. I don't know a great deal about slavery in America in this time but I didn't realize it was so inhumane. Although this film is touching and one can really can sympathize with the main character the brutalities are horrific. The scene with the young girl 'Patsey' getting lashed was extremely hard to watch. It really puts life in these times into perspective, I can't imagine what people in those times must of endured. All in all the actors were amazing acting these parts and the movie was touching and definitely one that is hard to pull away even at the confronting parts. I had never seen the actor Chiwetel Ejiofor before but in this movie he was outstanding and he deserved the BAFTA award 100%.",8,2,6,23 January 2017
There Will Be Blood," Very surprised and amazed
","I'm embarrassed to say I only just watched this film even though it came out in 2007. I must say I wasn't really that interested in watching it but now I wish I hadn't waited so long. It's my first film I've seen with Daniel Day Lewis and wow what an amazing actor! The movie starts a bit slow but once they get to Little Boston it really picks up. Paul Dano in my opinion is underrated. I've seen a few of his films now and he always impresses me and this film was no exception. I loved the music as well, in the intense scenes it really added to the drama of the film. Also what I loved about Daniel Day Lewis' character was the suspense of him, you never know what he will do next.Apparently he won Best Actor at the 2008 Oscars for his role and he deserved it 100%. I gave it 8/10 and I recommended it but it is over 2 hours.",8,0,2,6 February 2017
The Wolf of Wall Street," Leonardo never ceases to amaze me!
","Well I finally watched this film because my husband bought it on blu ray. All I can say is what an amazing film! Leonardo DiCaprio plays the role of real life stockbroker Jordan Belfort. The movie is based on a memoir written by Belfort. When he was working on Wall Street his company was engaged in a lot of corruption. What I loved about this film was the acting by Leonardo DiCaprio, he really played the part well. Also I liked how the film had comedy through it even though it deals with some intense themes. I wasn't such a fan of Jonah Hill, I find he tries to hard to be funny. I think the film really shows the extremes of what people will do for money and of course the consequences of having too much of it. The only thing I didn't like was the excessive swearing, but the film is known for it's bad language. I gave it 9/10. It's a long movie also, so make sure you have a lot of time.",9,0,2,12 February 2017
August Rush," Beautiful and touching film
","I watched this film today. It had me in tears. What a beautiful movie. The little boy is played by Freddie Highmore who I think is a great actor for his age. I haven't seen many of his films but he played the part beautifully. It is about a orphan boy who is musically intelligent and he leaves his boys home to go to NYC to look for his birth parents. His mother played by Keri Russell, was told by her father that the little baby boy was killed but in fact he was put up for adoption by him. When she learns that he is still alive she goes to find him. Keri Russell played the part of his mother really well. I'm not a big fan of Jonathan Rhys Meyers but he was OK in this film. The ending was so touching and it will definitely pull on your heart strings. A lovely film and definitely worth watching!",8,1,1,10 March 2017
Joy," Pleasantly Surprised
","Well here is another Jennifer Lawrence film that I loved. At the beginning of the film, it starts a bit slow but then gets quite good. Jennifer Lawrence plays a character based on a real life woman who became very successful with a mop and other products. I think her and Bradley Cooper work great together. He plays the QVC boss who promotes Joy's mop. I think the movie really shows what a person is capable of when they don't give up! I recommend this film and would definitely watch it again!",8,0,1,8 November 2018
