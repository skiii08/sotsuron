The Avengers," Best marvel movie yet.
","(5 out of 5 stars).The Avengers is one of the best marvel superhero movie yet. Joss Whedons direction and script delivered the movie. It was fast paced, action packed throughout, and the story was filled with surprises. The plot is great. The villain Loki returns and is better than ever. The cast ensemble is huge.

And a post credit scene played for laughs.",10,0,0,29 April 2020
Blade Runner 2049," Blade Runner is the example of an artwork to the science fiction genre with its powerful direction, visuals, and storytelling.
","What makes you a human? There is plenty of these type of questions that Blade Runner 2049 always refers back too in this science fiction film that is very much impressive. And I ll admit this, better than the original movie which may shock to all since the first was a cult hit of a movie. I feel like all the credit has to go to director Denis Villeneuve in making a compelling, visually done film. Blade Runner 2049 may not please every one in the audience and it sure will divide the audience either they enjoy it or find it boring. Lets get this straight out in the open. Blade Runner is not the typical Hollywood science fiction action movie were it is loaded with big action set pieces throughout. I ll also admit, this film could have used a little more action but otherwise the movie does well in its storytelling, impressive visuals, and a stunning direction. I do not want to give too much away about the plot. The less you know the better the movie will be. I ll just give the basic plot outline of a blade runner named K (Ryan Gosling) who hunts down replicants (bioengineered humans) who have been defective. Well on his first case of hunting a replicant, he unearths something that will get the attention from a corporation led by Wallace (Jared Leto) who is trying to perfect a great replicant. And K will need the help of a former blade runner Deckard (Harrison Ford) in order to find answers about what he has discovered that can change everything they once knew. The storytelling in this film is what makes it great. It is slow moving in a good way. It does leave you wanting to explore more about the dystopian future. The film spends its time in a futuristic Los Angeles, were its gloomy and flashy with its holograms. Then, K travels to San Diego, were it is a complete wasteland. Where L.A. dumps there massive loads of trash, which literally looks like a huge city of a junkyard. Also, the landscapes of Las Vegas, were it is orange and gloomy from the radioactive. These sequences of different areas does want you to explore more about. Also, K interpersonal relationship with his A.I. device that he carries with him that brings up a hologram of a young woman (Ana de Armas) who can keep him company emotionally or physically. There is plenty of details in the story that the film does take its time with its length. But it never gets boring. The visual effects are top notch impressive. Like I mentioned above about the landscapes to its neo noir lighting from the city. And to even make everything better is the music score by Hans Zimmer and Benjamin Wallfisch. Bringing back the original score theme and adding a few changes does give you that nostalgia feeling when seeing the score volume loud and seeing every shot with the camera done great as it captures the visual sets and effects. Director Denis Villeneuve (known for Prisoners, Sicario, and Arrival) if you seen those films. You should know he builds suspense, characters, and overachieves in trying to capture the best shot visually. And a lot of talking throughout the movie. Well the same goes for Blade Runner. He is all about storytelling and respecting the original by exploring further with its plot. He is starting to become one of my favorite directors that can always capture a tone and build its suspense. Sure, my one small issue with the film is it does lack in some action sequences. You get some small brief fight scenes and shooting sequence. And than a flying car chase in the climax. But I only wish there was a bit more to the action. Otherwise, Blade Runner 2049 is a good science fiction film. The direction and music score is great. The visuals are amazing and hard to take eyes off the screen. Ryan Gosling and the cast ensemble were good. The storytelling is slow moving but works great at being an artistic film than a typical action blockbuster. I rate the film 4 out of 5 stars. I recommend to see it on the big screen for its impressive music score and visuals of a dystopian future and plot. If you enjoy an artistic science fiction movie or loved the original than this will be a film for you.",8,1,5,7 October 2017
First Man," An emotional journey with a stunning direction.
","First Man (4 out of 5 stars).First Man delivers a spectacular journey through Neil Armstrong and the emotional journey that was driving him on heading to the moon. The direction really focused on Neil's perspective like when he was flying a rocket plane through the atmosphere. You did not see any other camera angle except the perspective on what he sees. Which is not much but from the cockpit windows. It did created a little claustrophobic and intense feeling. Ryan Gosling delivered an outstanding performance. Along with Claire Foy playing Janet, his wife. Damien Chazelle did deliver an emotional powerful direction.The plot really dived into the emotional journey with Neil Armstrong, NASA test pilot. He was trying to be supportive to his sick daughter. Throughout the film, he was still trying to coop and grief for his daughter. He was always driven to be on the flight of Gemini 8. After a failed travel into space. NASA was in a hurry to reach the moon with the space race against the Russians. All leading up to Apollo 11 with Neil and two others reaching the moon.The plot tried to keep itself into the emotional journey of Neil and dealing with family loss. The moment he walked on the moon and looking beyond the crater with tears running down his eyes. It was a powerful scene. It was not just about man first landing on the moon. It was the accomplishment and the struggle these characters did to get there.Ryan Gosling and Claire Foy delivered a powerful performance. The direction from Damien Chazelle was great. He made some scenes feeling a little claustrophobic when Neil was in the cockpit. You would only see what he sees. You would not get the full view of space or of the planet but only a glimpse of the planet with shaky cameras to be realistic. Or dizzying space craft spins. The climatic scene with Apollo 11 landing on the moon. It was well shot. The music score Justin Hurwitz was fantastic. The scene of walking on the moon was beautifully done.The film does have some long stretches of scenes with nothing going on or being slow moving. Otherwise, First Man is a good film. The visual effects and direction was great. The performances were good. And the plot delivered an emotional journey of Neil Armstrong.",8,1,2,24 January 2019
The Incredible Hulk," Fun addition after Iron Man.
",4 out of 5 stars.Hulk does improve over 2003 Hulk film with a faster pacing and plenty of hulk action. And battling against Abomination. The film is fun. Action packed. The cast is great with Edward Norton. I did find Liv Tyler and the rest of the cast to be decent. The plot is good. The film does pick up with a better climax than Iron Man movie did with a short fight scene. The fight with Hulk against Abomination was awesome. The film does have a mid credit scene which was cool.,8,0,0,18 April 2020
Mission: Impossible III," M:I 3 is a kinetic action packed sequel that throws you into a wild ride.
","Mission Impossible 3 ( 4 out of 5 stars).Mission Impossible 3 is a pretty fun exciting and action packed sequel. J.J. Abrams does bring a fresh style to the spy action film with a kinetic style, lots of action, a simple plot device that puts characters in a globe trotting adventure, and it is very fast paced that keeps you on the edge of your seat. I will say though, J.J. Abrams who did tv shows like Lost and Alias. This film does feel a lot like an episode from Alias just replace Jennifer Garner with Tom Cruise. And using similar music score from Lost. Which has the same music composer Michael Giacchino. The plot follows Ethan (Tom Cruise) finally settling down with Julia (Michelle Monaghan). She does not know his secret life of working for IMF. She thinks he goes on business trips when he leaves for a mission. When a mission in Berlin has him rescuing an agent he once trained Lindsey (Keri Russell). He discovers that an arms dealer Davian (Philip Seymour Hoffman) is after a mysterious device known as 'Rabbit's foot.' When Ethan and his team extract Davian and have him in custody. Davian will test Ethan when stakes are high when the threat comes to his wife Julia. J.J. Abrams script uses the rabbit's foot as a plot device. Were the audience will not know much more about it. Except that it is a high valuable target to arms dealer and the bad guys will try get their hands on it. With the good guys trying to prevent that. It is a simple plot. But it sets up characters going on one set piece to another. The action sequences are awesome and kinetic with energy. From the suspense opening sequence. To an action scene in Berlin were Ethan breaks into a warehouse with gun torrents causing destruction. And there escape on a helicopter being caught in a dogfight with another helicopter. Then, the film pauses a little bit and give a bit of a love story with Ethan and his wife. Then, flashes to Rome were Ethan and his team infiltrates an auction and tries to capture the villain. Which leads to a menacing conversation when Davian threatens Ethan on the plane. Foreshadowing for more to come. And than there is an explosive action sequence on a bridge with a drone destroying a convoy and Ethan trying to stop the bad guy from escaping. The action does not stop there. J.J. Abrams knows how to keep the pace moving and having wild action sequences that makes it the best movie out of the three. Tom Cruise is great yet again. Philip Seymour Hoffman does play a menacing villain. He does not have to throw a punch but his words can make you feel unease. Michelle Monaghan was decent, as Ethans love interest. Their love story in the film is the weakest part. The movie plays like action and explosions than slows down when Julia is thinking Ethan is hiding something than it rushes to another action set piece. And it follows this pattern throughout.Overall, Mission Impossible 3 is a good action film. The action sequences are plenty and visually exciting. It runs at a fast pace with several action set pieces. The plot is okay with a boring sub plot with Ethan and Julia. J.J. Abrams direction is energetic. He does have a lot of close up camera shots that is zoomed in characters faces. But still the best Mission movie yet.",8,1,1,26 July 2018
War Dogs," Guns, guns, and a dud.
","War Dogs is a film that is based on a true story about two friends that run an arms dealer business and selling their weapons to contractors/ to the pentagon. There is nothing on a film that is trying to adapt a real story onto film. Todd Phillips direction tries to make the film fun and some humor from the two leads like Miles Teller and Jonah Hill. Phillips previous work like Due Date and The Hangover films is still better with the jokes and humor. War Dogs is a fair comedy drama film, while playing into a serious direction just cause these events happen. And when a character is in uncomfortable territory in a country and he is just a regular message therapist, trying to make a living. The plot takes place in 2005, David (Miles Teller) a message therapist that is trying to make a living, and now then pregnant girlfriend played by Ana de Armas. David meets up with a long lost high school buddy Efraim (Jonah Hill) and is introduced in his business of arms dealing. Even though, David's girlfriend disapprove of guns, and becomes distant when his lies and secrets about this job increases. David and Efraim go way over by meeting Henry (Bradley Cooper). A guy that has connections to dealers with plenty of supplies.Miles Teller and Jonah Hill are both humorous and fun actors. The film does have its dark humor and a decent amount of laughs. Feels like the film takes into a serious turn when lives are threatened and people get kidnapped. A reminder that their arms dealing business is far from being a walk in the park job. And when they have to keep up with hiding evidence that can spark them into getting trouble with the law. Basically, the film does have that feel like another arms dealing movie such as Lord of War. And lets thrown in the idea of a true story and mixing with jokes in it just like how Pain and Gain turned out. Thats one main issue the film struggles is trying to keep a coherent direction and balance between the drama and its dark humor. Only if the script made these characters just as interesting and kept up with the pacing into making a better film. Even when the characters use pop references like the Scarface film and others, etc. War Dogs is a decent dramedy of a movie, the cast can do so much to make the movie entertaining. But for the dull script, and a coherent direction. The film would be one of those forgettable comedy movies.",6,1,2,22 December 2016
Iron Man 3," Awesome conclusion to the Iron Man trilogy.
",4.5 out of 5 stars.Iron Man 3 is a really good superhero film. Coming after Avengers. The film does pack a lot more with action. Humor. And a good concluding story to Iron Man. The story was good. There is a twist with the villain that may divide fans. I thought it was well done. Shane Blacks direction was good. He packed enough action sequences. Humor. And a great cast. It may not live up to how Avengers was with pacing. But it was one of the best films in the trilogy.,9,1,2,4 May 2020
Resident Evil: Afterlife," Action packed, loud, and an awesome fourth installment.
","Resident Evil: Afterlife (4 out of 5 stars).The fourth film does deliver a lot of action, visuals, and an awesome music score by Tomandandy. The story continues after the third movie. With Alice attacking an Umbrella lab. With an exciting explosive sequence. The film has a lot of action to make this entertaining. With faster mutated zombies. A monster called Axeman. Which had an awesome sequence with Alice and Claire fighting the axeman. And Wesker being the main villain was a fun add on. Fans of the game will see a similiar fight scene from one of the games.The movie is fast paced. Loud. And non stop exciting. And intense with the music score. I did find the movie script to be cheesy with dialogue and some action scenes. There is a lot of slow mo action scenes which was trying to deliver an awesome 3D experience. The cinematography is great. Paul Anderson did a great job in delivering the action sequences. And i cant wait to see where it goes next. The ending ends in a cliffhanger. And a fun cameo in a mid credit scene.",8,3,3,10 April 2020
It," You'll float too. Assuming you can handle the creepy scares of It.
","You know what is the majority of everyone's phobia is? Clowns, the creepiest things ever and to see Stephen King's It being remade into a movie again after a great performance done by Tim Curry. This It film takes the bite and brings in some classic horror movie scares which is what is missing in all these modern horror movies which are filled with lots of clichés and less creepy scares. Bill Skarsgard taking the role of Pennywise is even better. Beside the point that I have rarely seen the actor's performance in any other movie. He does a great job portraying a menacing, creepy looking clown that stalks children and comes charging at you at full force. I thought the original movie was okay but a bit slow. However, this film does build the characters with the kids who are being stalked by the menacing clown and plan on stopping him since no one else will. From the opening creepy sequence when Georgie following his paper boat on a raining day and coming across Pennywise. That sequence sets up the unease feeling. The story setting is in the 1980's this time. The plot follows Bill (Jaeden Lieberher) and his group of friends, who have been seeing some supernatural figure of a clown around their small town that is trying to strike fear into them. Bill and his friends must find a way to stop It from killing anymore kids around their town. What I loved about the film is it does build characterization with every kid in the Losers club. Bill is struggling with an emotional conflict of losing his brother. Beverly is abused by her father and has rumors of a false reputation against her around town. Richie is a cocky foul language kid always using jokes about mothers. Stan is religiously conflicted. And Eddie is a hypochondriac, who is always informing others about the dangers of germs and being contracted with diseases that are in the air. These characters are different and it is fun to see how they all react on screen. The actors that portrays them were good. And every kid has their own fear of something that It tends to use against them. The direction does rely on some old fashion horror movie techniques to get scares. It is not overbearing with loud sound effects or flashy camera angles. But classic horror movie style, were the story may be slow moving just to build characters and have them all encounter Pennywise individually. Until, its exciting thrilling climax of them trying to stop Pennywise once for all. Sure, the audience will find Pennywise be unsettling and scary. Which brings our fear of clowns into play. The direction is a lot of fun seeing these characters trying to solve the mystery of the towns children disappearing. And when their inner conflict of fear rises when Pennywise shows up with a red balloon. It can be scary. Overall, It is a great horror film. Bill Skarsgard is great as Pennywise. The direction does not hold back on delivering the thrills of classic horror movie scares. The cast ensemble playing as the kids were a lot of fun. (most of them are unknown actors which is even better because they all did great in their roles.) The story is slow moving but fun as it builds up the suspense. I cannot wait for the sequel to see the other half of the story. I rate the film 5 out of 5 stars.",10,7,16,8 September 2017
Hereditary," Slow moving but leaves you with a creepy payoff direction.
","Hereditary (4 out of 5 stars).Hereditary is going to be that type of horror movie were it will divide the audiences on either you like it or hate it. It is a bit artsy, creepy, and disturbing. The cast delivers a great performance, the plot can be slow moving. It does have that slow set up. More similar to the horror movie set up like Rosemary's Baby. Sure, that is were the filmmakers are trying to aim for. I did not find the movie to be scary at all. But very creepy and disturbing feel. The less you know about the plot the better the reveal is. The plot follows Annie (Toni Collette). She is an artist to miniature models. Also, has a miniature models of a life story of her family and the situation with her sick mother. After her mother passes away. She barely knew much about her mother. Besides she has many friends and kept a very secretive life. After her passing, Annie, and her husband Steve (Gabriel Byrne), her son Peter (Alex Wolff), and Charlie (Milly Shapiro) start experiencing some unknown things. That begins happening around them. The plot is slow moving. So do expect a slow set up with the characters. Annie barely knew her mother. Her husband is a passive guy but tries to do what is best for their children. Peter feels like a black sheep with the family. And Charlie who is distant with the family, making tiny models, and is more of a loner type of child. The direction by Ari Aster delivers a sharp tone. The story is a slow set up. But slowly things do become a little weird. When they start seeing Annie's mother. People in that town act differently or weird. And there are strange symbols on light poles or on walls. Annie begins to feel like she is losing her mind. The set design is mainly consist of them being in Annie's house. When a creepy situation like someone hanging in a corner of a dark room is slowly lurking. It gets very uncomfortable. And there is plenty of more of those horror techniques when the film gets closer to the climax. Toni Collette is great as Annie. Her performance is through the roof amazing. Alex Wolff was also good too. Milly Shapiro playing a silent girl type is great. The cinematography was great in capturing this uncomfortable feeling. The film does get very disturbing when it reaches the climax. And the film does its job as a horror movie making you feel disturbed even after the movie. Without giving away any spoilers. Overall, Hereditary is a good horror film. It does not have much scares. It does have a creepy and disturbing direction. The acting is great. The direction and script delivers an uncomfortable setting. The plot is very slow moving with its pace. Which is were it may lose the audience. But the payoff was definitely worth it.",8,1,2,7 September 2018
Detroit," Intense and edge of your seat with a couple of narrative perspectives of the Detroit riot.
","Detroit is an intense crime drama film that holds you to the seat to the final moments of the movie. Being based on a true story during the Detroit riot in July 1967, when the African americans were rising up against the police when they are mistreating them. The action begins when a police raid stops a party for a returned veteran. And from there are a couple of narrative stories one about a lead singer from the group called The Dramatics. When their concert was interrupted from the riots, they hold up in a hotel for the night. Then, there is a security guard Melvin (John Boyega) who is protecting a store from being attacked from the riot. When he hears gunshots leading to the hotel. He goes to check it out. Along with three officers Philip (Will Poulter), and two others. Philip and his two other officers try to hold up the hotel were there is nothing but African americans and two girls Julie (Hannah Murray) and Karen (Kaitlyn Dever). Philip and his two men hold up the people in the hotel and beat them down until someone gives up the suspect that shot a gun out of the hotel window. Director Kathryn Bigelow does well building up the suspense. She did decent with The Hurt Locker and Zero Dark Thirty. Detroit starts with the intense build up with the few narrative stories that eventually connect when they meet up in the climatic hotel. The emotionality with the characters to see innocent lives getting harassed and beat. It is a tough film to watch. John Boyega plays Melvin a guy that is for hire as a security to protect shops from being vandalized. A guy that holds his emotions when he sees people being mistreated horribly. Will Poulter playing an officer that is on the urge of hunting down any one he sees. As we see him in the opening sequence with his officers chasing a guy down, who was just carrying grocery bags for his family. The tone and direction says it all with these characters and how brutal they can be. The climatic sequence when these characters are being forced to face against a wall, as one by one are being interrogated with brutality and fear. It is an intense sequence, but well done with the direction and intensity. The couple of things I felt like it did not work with the film is after its second act. The film slows down and never gets back up. It goes through the court scene and some aftermath of the lead singer from The Dramatics having trouble and being shaken up from the treatment. Also, I felt like they could have trimmed and edited down like 20 minutes or so. Some scenes felt like they have been playing for too long like a long monologue singing sequence with the singer. Overall, Detroit is a good crime drama film. The direction built up the suspense for the first two acts of the film. And it never slowed down until the end. The actors were great. The plot was brutal to see with the events of the riot but true. I rate the film 4 out of 5 stars. I recommend checking the film out if you care about historical true stories.",8,0,2,21 December 2017
Rocketman," Amazing performance from Taron Egerton and a great biopic story.
","Rocketman (4 out of 5 stars).Rocketman is one ordinary biographical musical film that delivers with an amazing performance from Taron Egerton and a fantasy musical direction that showcases the highlights of Elton John and the rise and downfall in his life. I am a fan of Elton John and his music. The movie does show from his high points in his career to his struggle with his relationship with his mother and father. And his addiction to alcohol and drugs. The film also focuses on his relationship with John Reid (Richard Madden) who is also his manager and abusing his power as a manager.The plot is a good biopic showing Elton (Taron Egerton) always wanting to be a musician since as a kid. After his father wants nothing to do with him and his mother not really caring about him. He meets a song writer Bernie (Jamie Bell) which they become best friends. And after a few songs attracting a few managers. And one of them being John Reid (Richard Madden). Which they both fall for each other.Taron Egerton delivered as Elton John. From his dramatic performance to his musical sequences. He sure can sing. And the outstanding flashy wardrobe. Jamie Bell is also good as well. Playing his lifelong friend. Richard Madden was good playing John Reid, a shady manager. Bryce Dallas Howard was also good playing Elton's mother.This is no straight up biopic film. The script and direction did turn this biopic into a musical film. From the opening scene with Elton walking towards an addiction group to discuss moments from his life. Turning some events into a musical about how he was feeling. It worked. There are some great fun musical sequences and the songs were great. The cast ensemble all had a moment in a musical. Sure, the audience will be cheering for it.The film also focused on his rough relationship with his father. Which can be emotional that brought him into his addiction. And his emotional abusive boyfriend John Reid.I did feel like the film ran a little too long. With a few musical sequences too many which ruined the pacing of the movie. That slowed the progress of the story.Overall, Rocketman is a good biographical musical film. Taron Egerton should be nominated for awards for his outstanding performance as the legendary Elton John. The film has some fun musical sequences and some powerful dramatic moments. Which turns a biopic story into a fantasy musical story.",8,2,3,1 June 2019
A Star Is Born," Lady Gaga and Bradley Cooper delivers with a powerful performance and a sharp direction.
","A Star is Born (4 out of 5 stars).A Star is Born is a romantic drama that delivers with great performances from Bradley Cooper and Lady Gaga. And a sharp direction being Cooper's first film. I enjoyed it more than I thought I was. A plot about a famous rock star Jackson (Bradley Cooper) who struggles with alcohol and drug addiction. Which he falls for a waitress/singer-songwriter Ally (Lady Gaga) at a drag bar. Unhappy with the way she was living. Jackson invites her to his concert only to have her be part of it. From there, they go on tours and they partake on duo performances. Ally falls for Jackson. And sees that he is battling an addiction that is affecting his way of life.Bradley Cooper was great playing Jackson Maine. His performance of his mumbling voice and when he is singing. He sounds great as a rock star. Lady Gaga being in a big feature movie was great too. I only seen her in American Horror Story Hotel as a creepy character. But her playing Ally was great. She did a good job with a character that wanted more for her in life than being a waitress. The emotions she portrays when she see Jackson battling his addiction was powerful. Especially, the final song she sings in the movie. And she is also a fantastic singer.The music in the film was all great. It delivers a great soundtrack with Bradley Cooper and Lady Gaga singing. Sure, there are some songs that are played multiple times at concerts in the movie. But the songs never get old or boring. It does have a great love story. Not really a sappy or annoying romantic kind of movie. Jackson falling for Ally when she fights off a drunk guy at a bar. And there moment sitting in the parking lot in front of a store with Jackson telling Ally she is beautiful and her stubborn attitude of denying it was beautiful.Overall, A Star is Born is a good romantic drama film. I never seen the original movies. But Bradley Cooper and Lady Gaga are fantastic in the movie when it comes to their performances and them singing. The songs are great. The direction is powerful with its romantic story and the downfall of addiction.",8,2,5,30 October 2018
Wind River," A slow chiller crime thriller that builds its suspense with a grim direction.
","Wind River is a suspenseful thriller from a writer Taylor Sheridan (who has done previous scripts like Hell or High Water or Sicario). The plot follows US wildlife service Cory (Jeremy Renner) who works in the Wind River Indian reservation in hunting for wolves or other predators that attack the livestock in peoples property. When he is out in the snowy landscapes. He discovers a dead girl, who must have been running from something and died from breathing in the below zero air. What was she running from? And why is she out in the middle of nowhere? It raises the questions that cause FBI Jane (Elizabeth Olsen) to travel to Wind River which is way out of her comfort zone as an environment. Jane is going to need a tracker and the help from Cory in hunting a predator that harassed and murdered a teenage girl. I will say I did find Wind River to have its suspenseful moments. It may not be as good like Sicario and Hell or High Water which they were thrilling and kept you on the edge of your seat. Wind River being the third script by Taylor Sheridan and also directing this film. He does a few things right for being his directorial debut. He added an isolation tone to the film. Which a few characters reference the feeling of living in the mountains of Wyoming and feeling distant from society. The feeling of loneliness and how some people commit crimes to go to prison for better comfort and care. This film also focusing on a Native American reservation setting and how people go missing every year in the frozen snowy mountains. The plot is simple for its crime drama about an FBI agent and a tracker trying to solve a murder by investigating the victims drug addict brother and trying to find her boyfriend that works as a security for a drilling company in the mountains. I say Jeremy Renner and Elizabeth Olsen were perfect with their performances. Even though, they already had on screen chemistry with the Avengers movie. Their duo chemistry worked well here. Renner playing a character that is struggling within himself from a tragic past and grief. And great as a tracker. Olsen playing a character that is not in her comfort zone with going to a snowy climate. When she arrives, she is underdressed for the cold weather with a small jacket and high heels. The film is slow moving and does take a while for it to set up the suspense. The cinematography work in capturing the Wyoming mountains and snowy wildness is chilling and visually stunning to look at. Nonetheless, the pace is slow and boring until the thrills build up in the climax leading to an intense standoff with the police and the driller's security. Overall, Wind River is a fairly done thriller that you would need patience for the slow moving script to build the suspense for a shoot out climax. Jeremy Renner and Elizabeth Olsen performance is worth looking at. Even the visual setting of the reservation mountain of Wind River is breathtaking. I will rate the film 3 and a half star out of 5.",7,0,2,18 August 2017
Captain Marvel," Captain Marvel shines as the new character in the MCU world with action, story, and visual effects.
","Captain Marvel (4 out of 5 stars).Captain Marvel is the 21st MCU superhero film that introduces with another brief origin story of Carol Denvers (Brie Larson) who gets the power of energy projection and superhuman strength and becomes Captain Marvel. Captain Marvel film may not be the best in the MCU and may be a step backwards to being a fun origin story. The film is good. Brie Larson delivers the role of Carol Denvers. It does have a lot of action sequences and a proper brief origin story that focuses her getting stuck in an intergalactic war with two alien worlds such as Skrulls and the Kree. The direction and character development did feel a bit bland compared to every other superhero in the MCU.The review would be so spoiler free since there is a twist in the middle of the film. When Carol Denvers figures out the whole agenda with the bad guys motives and who her loyalties stand between the two alien races. The film does kick right into action with Carol having the abilities but does not know her true potential with her powers. There are flashbacks of her childhood and her motivation of standing up for what she is fighting for. When she falls onto Earth in 1995, we see a young Nick Fury (Samuel L. Jackson). And Agent Coulson (Clark Gregg). They learn and figure out who she is and what the real threat is out there. She needs Fury's help to learn who she really is and trying to figure out what the villain wants.Brie Larson is great playing the character. I can not see anyone else playing her. Except the script of the film did make her character feel the least interesting hero in the MCU. Every one in the MCU had a moment to shine and had a little fun with the character. Carol Denvers is basically the Jason Bourne, with her broken memories of her past and trying to find where she fits in. It was not as fun compared to the others. The direction was also a bit bland with some forgettable action sequences. Almost similar to how the first Thor movie was. The climax of the movie was kind of exciting and spectacular. With Carol achieving her true potential of her powers and toying around with the bad guys while learning her powers with Just A Girl by No Doubt playing in the background. When more space invaders arrive and she flies to space to take them out. Which she becomes an unstoppable force that no one will even stop her was cool but there was not really much of a climatic battle.Samuel L. Jackson was good playing the young Nick Fury. Ben Mendelsohn playing Talos a shapeshifting Skrull is fun. Lashana Lynch playing Carols best friend was good but like I said the development between these characters were dull. Jude Law was good too as Yon Rogg who was Carol's commander in the Kree world. Some returning cast members like Djimon Hounsou, Lee Pace, and Clark Gregg were good too. Gemma Chan and Annette Bening were good playing brief characters.The visual effects were awesome and exciting. The film did have a comic relief of Goose the cat that is roaming around the air force base and tags along with Nick Fury. That is the most fun you will see in the movie.Overall, Captain Marvel is a good film. There is plenty of action to keep you entertained and visual effects. The cast ensemble was good. The plot was good for an origin story with the character finding her place. It may not be as fun compared to other MCU films with a bland direction and development with the characters. There is a mid and post credit scene. The mid is important which hints for the next MCU film which everyone is anticipating for and the post is just for humorous fun.",8,3,8,10 March 2019
Iron Man 2," Fun. Action packed. And a fun addition
",4 out of 5 stars.Iron Man 2 is a fun sequel. It has some fun action sequences. Bigger climax. But the fight with Iron Man and War Machine against Whiplash was a bit short and weak. The cast ensemble was good. Tony stark faces a conflict within that is affecting him. The film does have a uneven pace in the middle of the movie. Scarlett Johansson shines as Black Widow. There is a great post credit tease scene. Besides the slow pacing with Stark facing his own issues that causes him to be irresponsible. It is a fun sequel worth watching.,8,0,0,18 April 2020
Passengers," A beautiful sci-fi romance thriller with two wonderful leads.
","Passengers is a science fiction/romantic film that delivers a wonderful cast, and visuals. It may not be the best and feels a little short on the conflict that these characters face. Director Morten Tyldum does well with building a better romance story and showing some stunning visual effects. I think Passengers deliver on the science fiction plot and for those who are seeking a romantic film. This film will fit in that expectations and better than most of the predictable redundant love movies out there. The plot follows a starship Avalon that is on a 90 year voyage, transporting 5,000 colonists to a new home planet. Engineer Jim (Chris Pratt) hibernation pod malfunctions, awakening him 90 years early. After discovering that he is stuck on the ship alone with no back up support from Earth. Aurora (Jennifer Lawrence) wakes up and realizes they are stuck in the ship alone and are unable to go back to their sleeping pods. With some occasional power outages, gravity shut offs, robotic droids malfunctioning on the ship. They realize there is something more happening that they need to fix. In order for the ship to make it to the new planet. And discovering a purpose for them to be waking up early. The film starts out great, we have Jim waking up, and realizing his fate has been sealed that he will be dead by the time they reach their destination. It feels like a character study of loneliness. He can be alone for so long until his desire of needing a human companion. He takes a great advantage of the luxury ship to himself, except for the cafeteria and their restricted menu cause of his class on board. His only company would be a bartender droid Arthur (Martin Sheen), but to what length when he does not have a human connection. Jim's actions may not be the best in logic or some may call it greed or creepy. Without giving much spoilers from were the direction goes from there and would make better sense when seeing it for yourself. Aurora and Jim build a relationship, realizing they only have each other, when their is no hope of seeing their destinations by the time they get there. Morten Tyldum does play with the direction of isolation on Jim's loneliness and his desire for love. Chris Pratt is a great actor, playing a character that is humorous, and emotionally driven at the same time. Jennifer Lawrence is a beautiful actress that gives her best with the role as well. Seeing the two is a perfect chemistry on screen. What also made the film even better is music composer Thomas Newman. His music score is beautiful, and the sound works with the stunning visual effects. Visuals when seeing Jim floating in space and out in the horizon of stars. Or seeing them witness as they pass by a big giant red star. Cinematographer Rodrigo Prieto did well in capturing some fantastic shots from the visual set pieces to set design. My only problem with the film is the conflict. The conflict is the ship malfunctioning and threatening the lives of everyone on board. This does not happen until the third act which switches gear into a science fiction thriller. With this film on a good concept idea on a central theme of mortality, human connection, etc. I feel like screenwriter Jon Spaihts could have build so much into a more complex thriller with this space voyage instead of a simple quick fix conflict. It is still a wonderful film with two amazing leads, impressive visuals, and direction.",8,24,48,21 December 2016
Us," Jordan Peele delivers his second horror film that brings suspense, weirdness, and thrills.
","Us (5 out of 5 stars).Us is Jordan Peele's second outing in directing a psychological horror thriller after his first film Get Out. Us takes the audience into a new ground of a horror movie which feels like it is inspired from the Twilight Zone series or the creepy horror thrills from It Follows. I enjoyed every bit of Us which it delivers some thrills, has some humor, and a shocking story that takes it into a new direction. It may not have a settle political theme or message that Get Out has. There is a message and theme about a social class from the people living in luxury to those living beneath the surface.The plot is definitely one of those were it is best to see without knowing much about it. The plot follows Adelaide (Lupita Nyong'o) and her family going on a vacation. They reach their vacation home, and head out to the beach which Adelaide is very anxious about. After having a traumatic past when she was a child at that beach. And she went inside this mirror theme park house. When the family encounter another family that looks exactly like them with some strange look and impaired speech. They have come across their doppelgangers that are out there to kill them. Unless they can escape their doppelgangers and survive the night.Jordan Peele is becoming my next favorite director with horror films. The film has a creepy atmosphere beginning. A young Adelaide at a carnival at the beach with her family. While her mother step away to the bathroom while the father was drunk and playing a whack a mole game. She walked away to the beach with some eerie storm coming from the horizon of the ocean. That tone is what sets for the rest of the film. Even during the opening credits with that music score in the background. It delivers chills hearing it. Then, to the present day, Adelaide is struggling with her past. Her husband Gabe (Winston Duke) is trying to have a good time with the family on vacation. Their teenage daughter Zora (Shahadi Wirght Joseph) and son Jason (Evan Alex) who is obsessed with trying to start a fire with his lighter. There is a eerie moment when the family is walking on the beach and their shadows are aside of them was just brilliant in capturing the tone of the movie. Also, the song of 'I Got 5 On It' by Luniz also is played a few times with a darker score. But it works perfectly in the movie. Right after the family is trying to escape their doppelgangers. The suspense and thrills delivers. I would not say it was scary but it did deliver the intense and suspense build up.There are a couple of twists and turns on the story with the doppelgangers which is best to see for yourself and have your own interpretation. Especially, in the final 15 minutes of the film. The twist will leave the audience talking right after credits roll. Lupita Nyong'o delivers with her performance as Adelaide and her doppelganger. The doppelgangers are by far creepy with their look and the animalistic sounds they make. Which seemed almost inhuman. Winston Duke was also good as well.Overall, Us is a great psychological horror thriller film. The plot and direction creates a creepy tone almost like Stanley Kubrick's The Shining when the family is driving to the mansion. Except this family is driving to the beach. The film does deliver suspense and thrills that is worth checking out and some shocking weird twists that may have the audience talking.",10,8,28,23 March 2019
Eurovision Song Contest: The Story of Fire Saga," Weird, fun, and a little too long for a comedy film.
","Eurovision Song Contest: The Story of Fire Saga (3 out of 5 stars).Eurovision is a comedy film about two best friends since there childhood. Had a dream about going into a singing competition in Eurovision. Lars (Will Ferrell) and Sigrit (Rachel McAdams) are a duo that sing in local bars in Iceland. While they enter a competition presenting there country. They face against Alexander (Dan Stevens) a Russian singer who has a flamboyant style. And others. While Lars father Erick (Pierce Brosnan) is disappointed with his sons talent.Eurovision is a film that feels like a stylish 1980s music video with its European celtic like music and costumes, lighting, and visuals. One wonders if the writers and director was high on something from its trippy and weird style. It does have its fair share of comical moments. I did find the film to have its charm with the performances and decent story about Lars and Sigrit trying to chase there dreams.The performances are fun and weird in a good way. Which is what it is trying to be with its stupid humor. The film does run a little too long with its running time. Running at 2 hours. The direction does have an uneven pacing. Lars and Sigrit singing and having their musical duo is a lot of fun and flashy with its songs and set design. When the characters are not in a musical moment. The direction can be a little dull and slow.",6,1,3,30 June 2020
Knives Out," Entertaining, fun, and a better crime solving movie.
","Knives Out (4.5 out of 5 stars).Knives Out is a mystery murder crime film which you will have a lot of fun with this Clue like concept as Detective Benoit Blanc (Daniel Craig) tries to solve a murder. This kind of film reminds me like Murder at the Orient Express. But a little more fun and entertaining. Rian Johnson direction and his witty script makes this movie worth watching. It is fun, there are surprises, and twist and turns.The plot follows Harlan (Christopher Plummer) who is a patriarch and owns a lot. After he was mysteriously found dead and presumed it was a suicide. A private investigator Benoit Blanc is hired to solve the mystery. With the family being on the will and are wanting their share of Harlan's property and company. Blanc believes there is a suspect that is at large within the family.The film's plot is a little slow moving. It is a lot of fun. Blanc interviewing every family member Ranson (Chris Evans) who is the black sheep of the family. Linda (Jamie Lee Curtis) and her husband Richard (Don Johnson). Walt (Michael Shannon). Meg (Katherine Langford). Jacob (Jaeden Martell). Joni (Toni Collette). And their house nanny Marta (Ana de Armas). The cast ensemble was great. The performances are fun and entertaining.The film is filled with surprises with twist and turns. Definitely best seeing without reading or looking up spoilers about it. I would love to see another movie of this.Overall, Knives Out is a really good film. If you are into the murder mystery kind of movie. This would be it.",9,46,95,13 December 2019
The Irishman," A sharp crime film but dragged down from an over long run time.
","The Irishman (4 out of 5 stars).The Irishman is a good epic crime film that delivers a strong direction from Martin Scorsese and the cast ensemble with Robert De Niro, Al Pacino, and Joe Pesci. The performances are top notch great. Especially, the deaging the characters with visual effects. The film follows the early years of Frank (Robert De Niro) and his rise of being a mob hitman. Seeing the actors portray there characters throughout the years is great. Definitely, an improvement over other films that try that deaging technology unlike Jeff Bridges in Tron Legacy.The plot is over long following Frank through the years of truck driving to working for the mobster in cleaning and taking out anyone they want gone. The film is one of the longest with being at 3 and a half hours long. Which does show it when watching. The film does slow down and I felt like they should have trimmed down some scenes.The script and direction is sharp with the crime epic. The actors did great with their performances. It may not be Martin Scorsese best picture in his list of movies. The movie delivers in a gritty and old fashion filmmaking.",8,2,6,29 November 2019
Aquaman," Amazing film that delivered an epic adventure story, stunning visual effects, and action.
","Aquaman (5 out of 5 stars).Aquaman is an awesome bada** superhero film that delivers on an epic adventure scale with action sequences, visual effects, and a great story. I will consider this to be the best DC movie beating out Wonder Woman. The character Aquaman seems like a cheesy character to even be adapted onto the big screen. With Jason Momoa performance as the character. He makes the character bada** and even when he achieves his golden outfit.The plot is a great adventure story. It was not rushed nor overstuffed with sub plots. It follows Atlanna (Nicole Kidman) the queen of Atlantis being rescued by a lighthouse keeper Thomas (Temuera Morrison). They both fall in love with each other and have a son named Arthur (Jason Momoa) who will soon become Aquaman. As decades fly by, Aquaman is found by Mera (Amber Heard) who informs him that his step brother Orm (Patrick Wilson) is trying to wage war against the surface people. And he is trying to unite the seven kingdoms underwater to create havoc to the surface people. With Mera and Nuidis (Willem Dafoe) help and needing to find the true trident of Atlantis in order for Aquaman to claim his rightful place in the throne. He will fight against Orm's army and hired pirates led by Black Manta (Yahya Abdul-Mateen II).The plot delivered an epic scale adventure. Aquaman travelling to Atlantis that looked like a beautiful colorful city underwater. Was more astonishing than the Avatar film. The action sequences are big and well directed. There is a lot of action throughout. Aquaman fighting against pirates in a submarine. From the epic lifting the sub out of the water. The fight scene with Atlanna fighting against Atlantis soldiers in the opening scene with one long camera take was well choreographed. James Wan direction of having the camera rotate around the action sequences worked so well. He is known for his small budget horror movies like Saw and Insidious. His action style from Furious Seven and this film was just awesome. He delivered a great underwater chase scene that almost felt like Tron Legacy with the beautiful lighting vehicles and Atlantis lighting. And the chase scene in Italy when Aquaman and Mera are facing against Black Manta and his soldiers was thrilling. The climax battle sequence is breathtaking. With Aquaman and Orm/ Ocean Master fighting each other was the best choreographed fight scene with the cinematography work.The visual effects are breathtaking when the action is underwater or on land. It was great on an epic scale. The cinematography work was well done that captured the action and choreography. The music score Rupert Gregon-Williams was great. And had a good score that made the movie feel like an adventure. Also, the soundtrack with a few songs in it was great and fun. Jason Momoa was great. Amber Heard is beautiful and great as Mera. Willem Dafoe, Patrick Wilson, Dolph Lundgren, Yahya Abdul-Mateen II, and Nicole Kidman were all great with their characters. James Wan's direction was brilliant with making an adventure story and epic action.Overall, Aquaman is a great film. I say it is the best DC movie out there. I definitely recommend seeing this in the big screen in theatres. If you are looking for an adventure story and exciting epic action sequences with beautiful stunning visual effects. This is the film worth seeing.",10,1,2,23 December 2018
Deadpool 2," Gory, exciting, and fun that you can have with the wise cracking Deadpool.
","Deadpool 2 (4 out of 5 stars).Deadpool 2 is back and turns out to live up to the first movie. With plenty of exciting action sequences, a wise cracking script and performance from Ryan Reynolds that delivers with lots of humor. Ryan Reynolds is born to play the character. Plus the humor in the movie does take a lot of jabs to the Marvel characters from The Avengers or making fun of DC for its seriousness. It may not be the best superhero movie with a thin plot or lacking depth with the villain (I will avoid spoilers on the plot). Is it better than the first film? I will say they are equally entertaining. The first movie did not have much depth with the plot either. The plot follows Deadpool (Ryan Reynolds) after a downhill spiral on life. He may be given another chance to do a good deed by saving a moody mutant teen Russell (Julian Dennison) who has the powers of firefist. When Cable (Josh Brolin) arrives from the future and his only goal is to kill Russell. Deadpool enlists new recruits to form a team called X Force with one of the members being Domino (Zazie Beetz). I will say the plot felt a little thin when it comes to having a story. Has that Terminator concept with a man coming from the future to rewrite history. Sure, there is a joke thrown in there from that concept. The movie is nonetheless entertaining, funny, and exciting. There are plenty of action sequences that keep the pace moving. The opening montage of Deadpool facing against criminal mobs internationally to an opening credit scene that feels like a James Bond movie with a song played by Celine Dion (which works with the setting and tone of the opening scene). The car chase scene with the huge armored prisoner transport vehicle and Domino and Deadpool facing against Cable was the highlight of the movie. I felt like the climax of the movie was a little bit short. Without giving away spoilers, the turning point of the villain was a bit weak. Also, you get to know a little about Cable and his motives on going after Russell. Josh Brolin was perfect as Cable. It would be difficult to see anyone else playing the character. Morena Baccarin returns. Same with T.J. Miller the wise cracking buddy of Deadpool. Colossus returns as the goody good X-Men character that is trying to recruit Deadpool to doing good. Brianna Hildebrand is back as Negasonic Warhead but with a short role. Zazie Beetz is Domino. And her character is also the highlight of the movie. She did great with the role. I did not like Julian Dennison as Russell. A character that is moody with anger issues and undeveloped. It was difficult to care for the character even when Deadpool and Domino are trying to save him. The movie had plenty of humor. It did not take itself seriously which threw jokes towards Marvel's characters, DC, even the I want to build a snowman from Frozen. The humor was fun and stupid. Overall, Deadpool 2 is a good superhero film. Ryan Reynold's delivered with performance and script. He is the wise cracking character, which also poked fun at himself. The action was exciting and also delivered by a director David Leitch (who did movies like John Wick and Atomic Blonde). Josh Brolin and Zazie Beetz were great and highlights of the movie. The film is a lot of fun with plenty of humor and action. Also, there is two mid credit scenes that is a lot of fun as it pokes fun at the character. I do recommend seeing this film in theatres if you enjoyed the first movie for the action and its raunchy stupid humor.",8,4,10,19 May 2018
Thor: Ragnarok," Pure fun with laughs and excitement with its action spectacle.
","Thor is a smashing fun time that is funny, action packed, and visually colorful with its direction. Not sure if director Taika Waititi took notes about moving away from its serious direction with Thor The Dark World movie and turning to Guardians of the Galaxy style. Cause Thor: Ragnarok did not take itself too seriously. There was humor in almost like every scene, the style and the music score playing like an 1980's science fiction techno movie was what made this movie pure fun. It made the movie to be the best out of the three. The plot follows Thor (Chris Hemsworth) facing against Surtur (a demonic looking beast), and on his return home to Asgard. He notices his father is missing and Loki (Tom Hiddleston) is once again trying to rule their kingdom. On the search for their father, they come across Hela (Cate Blanchett) the god of death. Who plans on taking over Asgard. While Thor and Loki get lost in a foreign planetz Sakaar. Where Thor gets captured by a Valkrie (Tessa Thompson) who sells him to the grandmaster (Jeff Goldblum). The grandmasters plan to have Thor face against his long winning contender in a gladiatorial battle. Thor: Ragnarok is a lot of fun from beginning to end. There is not one dull boring moment. Yes, it may slow down in the middle of the second act for the characters to have a dramatic moment. With Thor and Hulk trying to convey the other about leaving and staying. Then, there is Hela who is hellbent on taking over Asgard's throne for a very personal reason (Without giving away spoilers). And Valkrie personal vendetta after losing her team in a war which has been affecting her and causing her to drink a lot so she can forget. Every character seemed to have a fun moment. Thor throws out a lot more cheesy one-liners. Hulk has some fun moments with his lines. And even Loki has some fun betraying and somehow always having a heroic moment that makes you forget what he did before. Jeff Goldblum was the highlight of the movie as the grandmaster. Playing an evil narcissistic character. There are a lot of action sequences that is entertaining and big. The fight scene with Thor and Hulk was funny and awesome. The visual effects are astonishing. The direction is colorful. The set designs are fun to see. What I also mean that the film does not take itself seriously. There was a hilarious moment when Thor is strapped to a chair that's going through a little tour of Sakaar and the music choice may seem familiar to another classic movie. Overall, Thor: Ragnarok is pure awesome. I never had this much fun since Guardians of the Galaxy. The direction in this film is way different than the other two movies. Its colorful, the music score is great. (There is two scenes were the 'immigrant song' played in the teaser trailer was used.) And it worked great in those action sequences. The cast ensemble all had fun and had their moment to shine and had some humor. The action sequences were great and the visual was amazing. Also, there are two post credit scenes. The mid credit you can say is somewhat important for a future film. And the end credit scene was just meant for laughs and gags. Nothing serious.I rate the film 5 out of 5 stars. Definitely worth checking out on the big screen for its exciting action and colorful fun direction.",10,1,9,3 November 2017
Resident Evil: Extinction," Desert wasteland apocalypse with lots of action.
","Resident Evil: Extinction (5 out of 5 stars).This third film kicks off with plenty of action. Continuing the story with Alice driving in the desert landscape alone. Facing against bad guys. Zombies. And zombie birds. Meanwhile, Claire (Ali Larter) and her caravan of survivors are driving along the wasteland. Trying to find a safe haven.It is an interesting way to end the trilogy. Taking the setting in a desert landscape. With survivors running low on food and gas. While Umbrella corp led by Iain Glen character is creating faster zombies.The film is very fast paced. There is a lot of action to make this worth watching. The music score by Charlie Clouser was decent. The cast ensemble is great. The visual effects was good.The film does end on a cliffhanger for another movie which would be fun to see.",10,1,1,9 April 2020
Ready Player One," A great visually exciting ride that will connect audiences with some nostalgia feeling from a classic pop culture.
","Ready Player One (4 out of 5 stars).Ready Player One is a visually stunning science fiction film that pays homage to the 1980s classic games and media and has plenty of easter eggs that fans will pick up on. It is an exciting thrill ride from beginning to end. I never read the novel but know it's a story concept that reference a lot of classic games and movies. The plot takes place in 2045, were every one escapes the real world to go into a virtual reality known as Oasis. They can do endless possibilities, play for money, meet people, and explore a bigger world. Wade (Tye Sheridan) is trying to find three keys that are hidden in the Oasis. That is left behind from James Halliday (Mark Rylance) the creator of Oasis. And his passing, he decides to hide three keys. And the player that finds all three keys can find the hidden easter egg that will be worth trillions and inherit on being in charge of Oasis. Wade discovers a clue by learning from Halliday's past. And will need the help from his friends Artemis (Olivia Cooke) and Aech (Lena Waithe). Before an evil organization led by Nolan (Ben Mendelsohn) and his army of players try to find the egg first. The pros about the film?There is a lot to love about the movie. First, the visual effects are amazing. When Wade enters Oasis and seeing an ever-changing landscape. Lots of characters and colorful costume design. There are a lot of characters that you may notice from other movies and games. And it was a fun surprise to see them show up. Like the already shown in the trailer with the iron giant. The movie spends ¾ of its time in the Oasis. So there is endless entertainment that will keep your eyes engaged to the screen. From the exciting race sequence that had cars being smashed by a dino or Kong. To a stunning club setting were characters can leap into an air dance battle. And a fun sequence involving a classic Stephen king movie which is best to see for yourself when characters are placed in that setting. Also, the climatic battle was epic and fun when two giant characters battle it out. The concept and story was fun. Sure, Ernest Cline must have been a fan of the old school games, music, and movies. And wanted to bring it back to revive those era. Especially, when Wade wishes he was back in the 1980s were the pop culture was more noticed then. Tye Sheridan was great. Olivia Cooke was good as well. Ben Mendelsohn plays the cliché villain who is a businessman that makes his agenda so obvious about ruining the pop culture for his own profit. T.J. Miller plays the villains soldier for hire in the Oasis which he throws in a humor to lighten the mood. Mark Rylance was fantastic playing the awkward James Halliday. This is one of Steven Spielbergs better movies. It is overbearing with beautiful visual effects but it did not let the story fall in the shadows. The music soundtrack was also good too from Van Halen, Tears for Fears, Blondie, ect. So much more.The cons of the film?Every thing was so fun and great about the movie. I feel like Steven Spielberg played it too safe from going all out. I was hoping for more of an exciting intro like Tron Legacy. And a better music score. Alan Silvestri score seemed a little similar to his other movies like The Avengers, Beowulf, ect. I feel like it would be better fit with a electronic techno score like Junkie XL, Daft Punk, M83. Otherwise, the soundtrack was a fun playlist that worked with the movie.Overall, Ready Player One is a good film. Plot was fun and neat with a good theme. The visual effects and action was plenty throughout. The cast was good. Steven Spielberg did good with delivering a visually exciting ride with many references that audience can try to pick up from. I recommend seeing this film in the biggest screen in theatres. Definitely worth the price of admission. If you are a fan of the book or enjoy the 1980s pop culture. There is plenty to enjoy from it.",8,0,2,1 April 2018
"I, Tonya"," Margot Robbie and Allison Janney's performance steals the show in a edgy humor style film.
","I, Tonya (4 out of 5 stars). I, Tonya is a biographical film that has a tone like a mockumentary showing the interviews from Tonya, her mother, her ex husband Jeff, and even the tv producer played by Bobby Cannavale giving his input on the whole situation of Tonya entering the Winter Olympics on figure skating and the 1994 event attack on Nancy Kerrigan. The plot follows Tonya when she was young around 4 years old wanting to learn on being the best figure skater and her abusive mother (Allison Janney). Then, following her teen years with still training to be the best and she meets Jeff (Sebastian Stan) who soon becomes her husband and also abusive. Then, as an adult, were her and her husband are on and off every time. She enters the 1994 Olympics and her rival Nancy Kerrigan was attacked by some hired help that comes bashing her knee before the event. What worked great with the film? Director Craig Gillespie tried to keep this film at a fast pace. It follows modern times during the interviews with these characters sharing there side of the story and perspective on what they thought of the 1994 attack and Tonya Harding. Then, it flashes to her earlier years briefly up until the 1994 event. Were she gets accused and put on trial for the attack. I will say the film moves at a brisk pace, which does not slow down or get boring. There is also some characters breaking the fourth wall barrier talking to the audience about what they thought of their side of the story.Margot Robbie was fantastic as Tonya Harding. She grows up to be somewhat of an unlikable character, were judges criticized her for the attitude. And how she acts towards people. Also, Sebastian Stan was great as her passive aggressive husband. He is like a ticking time bomb when he gets abusive around. Allison Janney was phenomenal playing a strict, abusive, unsupportive mother. What I did not like about the film? Bobby Cannavale's character is out of place. He plays a tv producer sharing his input on the 1994 Winter Olympics attack. And his input on Tonya Harding. His performance was decent but his perspective on the event was more of a commentator as an audience than being involved with the characters. Overall, I, Tonya is a good biographical film. It was fast paced showing Tonya's earlier years on training to be a figure skater, some events with her on and off husband, and her mother's unsupportiveness, and her entering the Olympic championship. Film does not get carried away with the mockumentary style or wall breaking but does feel out of place with Bobby Cannavale's character. But I still recommend the film as worth watching for some incredible performances and the story of Tonya Harding.",8,0,0,16 March 2018
Molly's Game," Bold and a fast moving script with an amazing performance by Jessica Chastain.
","Molly's Game (3 out of 5 stars). Molly's Game is a captivating drama film that is cold with its undertone performances and provocative with its thrilling poker games that Molly Bloom is in charge of. The film starts with Molly being a world class skier until an accident ending her career. She moves to Los Angeles to start a new life while taking a break from law school. She meets a guy that introduces her to an underground poker game where celebrities and high end clients buy in to compete. From there, she decides to host her own poker games in hotels and begins making a name for herself and money until the law catches up with her. When she will need the help from Charlie (Idris Elba) her lawyer. I am not a huge poker player or get excited for the game itself. But the film and direction does put you in a fresh perspective for the audience that are not familiar with the game. Even Molly Bloom was seeing this and trying to understand the game and the rules. When she has to google each poker player terms to understand it. Also, the films visuals of showing us the decks and the idea of putting it in to win. Jessica Chastain is a beautiful actress. She did great in the film portraying Molly Bloom. Her performance was cold and stunning. Idris Elba was also good too playing her lawyer. Aaron Sorkin did well with keeping up and making it a fast talking script. Just like how he did The Social Network or Steve Jobs. It could have been a very boring movie when the conversations are all about poker and breaking the laws. The script was fast and kept the pace moving with the characters. The couple of things i did not like about the film. I felt like the music score by Daniel Pemberton could have improved. Atticus Ross or some composer that could have mixed the original score with electronical could have made the film more exciting with its poker story and direction. Also, the film does slow down by the end of its second act. During the climatic court case scene. It just went from an interesting fast drama film into a boring let down. Overall, Molly's Game is a fair film. It is a provocative drama film with its true events and concept. The acting was great and the script kept the dramatic scenes exciting. It just fails with a tedious music score and boring ending.",6,1,2,13 April 2018
BlacKkKlansman," Better than I expected with great performances and a powerful story.
","BlacKkKlansman (4 out of 5 stars).BlacKKKlansman is a biographical drama film that is a crazy true story about a first African American detective in Colorado police department. Were he goes undercover to a KKK clan after having conversations with them over the phone. He enlists one of the detectives to go undercover for them to help expose their future attacks.The plot tries to be fun and have a powerful story over real events on what happened. John David Washington playing Ron Stallworth, the first African American detective. Who was bored working in the records room in the department and his chief transferred him to being a detective. He sees an ad for a KKK clan on the newspaper and decides to call them wanting to be recruited. He sends another detective Flip (Adam Driver) to pretend to be Ron Stallworth when he is going undercover for the clan. It was fun seeing Adam Driver and John David Washington performance together as they practice to be the other person. And Driver being conflicted on joining the clan cause of his dislike how they treat people and he is apparently Jewish which he knows nothing about except for his family.The performances were great with the two leads. Laura Harrier was great playing Patrice who falls for Ron. Topher Grace playing the arrogant David Duke who is a KKK leader.Spike Lee did give a powerful direction. He tries to have some fun with the material while taking it very serious with delivering the true events. The films setting was in the 1970s and his direction tries to be that 1970s film. Sadly, I think the music score felt a little out of place at times. During dramatic car chase with the leads trying to stop a bomb the music during the movie felt indifferent. The music score could have been better. Even, the ending sequence with Ron and Patrice walking in the hallway with the hazing direction and music playing was similar to Spike Lee's previous films Inside Man. Could have been creative with the music choices.Overall, Blackkklansman is a good film. The acting was great. The story was powerful. Even the movie referring back to 2017's August events in Charleston was mentioned.",8,10,19,9 November 2018
Spider-Man: Homecoming," Pure fun, Tom Holland did not disappoint. May be one of the better Spider-man movies but not Marvels best film.
","The friendly neighborhood Spider-man is back and better than ever. Hearing about another Spider- man movie being rebooted within 15 years after Sam Raimi's films and The Amazing Spider man being the second reboot. The thought of seeing the origin story for a third time would have been exhausting seeing another adaptation of Peter Parker taking the big responsibility of being a hero and witnessing Uncle Ben being killed off. However, Spider-Man: Homecoming takes place after Captain America Civil War and no background story to how Peter Parker became the webslinging hero. Homecoming works well more as a coming of age movie as Peter Parker is going through his sophomore year of high school and wanting to have a bigger purpose in joining the Avengers. The opening sequence of seeing Peter (Tom Holland) going to Germany and shooting his homemade movie as he is about to be part of that Civil War that Tony Stark (Robert Downey, Jr.) invited him too was hilarious. The fun moments with Happy Hogan (Jon Favreau) and Peter sharing the same hotel and Happy's assistance to Peter is just hilarious. Peter is still learning about all the features his new spider man suit. Peter is desperate for a big mission and is hoping Tony and Happy will call him to be part of the Avengers. They have been ignoring him and hoping he is staying low on his web slinging and is hoping he just focuses on his side of town and neighborhood without getting the mainstream attention. Peter has been doing the good deeds in stopping burglaries, bike thieves, etc. Until, a group of robbers stealing an atm was using some alien weaponry that is led by Adrian. Adrian Toomes/Vulture (Michael Keaton) and his men were shut down by Stark's damage control company in savaging alien parts/weaponry which he will not stop until he gets what he wants. Spider-Man Homecoming is a lot of fun from Tom Holland's charming wisecracking humor as the character and seeing his early years as the hero were mistakes happen. He face plants to the ground, slips and lets the bad guys run away. But he is learning as the hero. The action sequences are fun and Peter's humor throughout would keep you entertained. The Ferrier boat sequence was exciting. Sure, there is a couple of issues with some lighting which I ll come back to discuss. The visual effects were great and colorful. It may not be Marvel's big spectacle action movie which this film is grounded and more about the story and characters growing and learning from within themselves. There are new characters like Michelle (Zendaya) who is odd and weird but she loves to keep to herself no matter how awkward she is. Happy has more screen time, trying to supervise Peter and hoping he stays out of trouble. Aunt May (Marisa Tomei) is younger than the other actresses in the other movies but she was great as well. Robert Downey Jr. did not steal the show in the movie, were there are glimpses of him reminding Peter that he needs to step down as the hero and avoid causing major trouble. Michael Keaton is awesome as the villain, who will do whatever it takes to get what he wants and his winged suit was incredible. My issue with the film is not big or did not make the movie terrible. Vulture is an awesome villain with a twist in it. It is sad to see that every time he is on screen fighting with Spider-Man. Most of their scenes together is badly lit with the lighting which makes it hard to make out or get excited over. Even the climax of the movie, which was short (shorter than the first Iron Man's movie climax). After all these Marvel movies, you would hope they make a climax that is exciting to see with Spider-Man battling with the villain. But it was slightly a let down. My other issue is Peter Parker's bully such as Flash (Tony Revolori) was unbelievable. The casting choice with him did not make Peter being insulted with name calling feel even realistic. Could have been a better actor picked for Flash. That is a minor issue with the film.May not be Marvels best movie but surely one of the best Spider-man movies to date. Overall, Spider-Man Homecoming is a really good superhero movie. Direction has that coming of age development with the characters and story. The cast so far was great and Michael Keaton was awesome as the villain. The action sequences were plenty and fun. Could have had a more exciting climax. I definitely recommend the film which is a huge improvement over the last few Spider-man movies. The final post credit scene I found to be useless since it was made for as a joke but the mid credit scene does set up for another.",9,48,90,8 July 2017
Captain America: The Winter Soldier," Awesome.
",(4.5 out of 5 stars).Great action. Love the second movie. It does have a political thriller feel with the movie which had an uneven pacing. The cast is great. The action sequences are awesome. The winter soldier was an awesome villain. This movie was an improvement over the last.,9,1,1,6 May 2020
Star Wars: Episode IX - The Rise of Skywalker," An epic saga finally reaching an end with plenty of emotions and action that may leave you wanting more.
","Star Wars: the Rise of Skywalker (5 out of 5 stars).Star Wars: The Rise of Skywalker is an epic conclusion to the series which delivers and may satisfy for Star wars fans. J.J. Abrams delivers a conclusion to the series. The Last Jedi was still a great movie. But the characters choices and origins was not at all satisfying. Abrams does open this movie with a few surprises which brings back a character from the previous set of movies. I will try to avoid spoilers with this film. It is best to see for yourself and get the reaction when it happens.The plot begins a year after the last movie. Rey (Daisy Ridley) is training herself to be a jedi. Finn (John Boyega) and Poe (Oscar Isaacs) are on a beacon trail to a hidden star system. Which the first order base may be at. Kylo Ren (Adam Driver) is on a search for Rey.The film opens with a surprise return of a character which will leave you with goosebumps. The first hour the movie spends Rey, Finn, and Poe on a chase from the first order. While trying to discover a beacon to search for a planet that the death star ruins are at. There is plenty of action sequences that will leave you at the edge of your seat. The visual effects are amazing and big. John Williams music score delivers one last epic battle. Some of the action was awesome. With a desert planet and a speeder chase scene. To a pretty cool lightsaber battle with Rey and Kylo by the ocean with huge waves. And a final space battle. J.J. Tries to fill in as many space ships in one screen. With lots of explosions.I did expected a little different climax. Was hoping for a big epic climatic lightsaber battle like Revenge of the Sith. This movie did have a different climax which was still good. The film does put you in an emotional roller coaster. With tying up loose end with characters. Leia (Carrie Fisher) role was a key moment for the story. Sure, they used deleted footage from the last two movies to make it work. Which nearly worked and it did not feel out of place. The film does have a twist with a character revealing their origins or discovering who they are. Which was awesome.I know some people will not like how this movie went. There is a course correction from what Last Jedi did. It is what happens when you have different writers with The Force Awakens being J.J. Abrams take. And Rian Johnson taking over for Last Jedi. Abrams came to a conclusion with this movie and gives us a satisfying movie with the characters origins.Overall, Star Wars: The Rise of Skywalker is a great film. I loved it. J.J. Abrams direction and cowriting the script brought an epic conclusion to the skywalker series. It has plenty of action, visual effects, and an emotional story to make this worth watching on the big screen.",10,13,30,22 December 2019
Lion," Beautiful emotional journey of a lost boy trying to find his way home.
","Lion is a strong emotionally driven film that hits around every corner about a five-year-old boy that gets lost in India. I was surprised about how good this movie was from direction, acting, the music score, and the plot, which is based on a true story about Saroo Brierley. This is one well done biographical film about his story, in 1986 when he was five years old and living with his older brother Guddu and younger sister and mother. They steal coal from moving trains to sell at the market to afford milk. Guddu tries to work at these one stop jobs and was supposed to work overnight. Saroo (Sunny Pawar) and Guddu are close as brothers. When Guddu leaves Saroo on a train station bench cause he couldn't stay awake for this job. Saroo not knowing when his brother will return, he hid inside a train and fell asleep. When he woke, the train is moving, not knowing how far away from home the train took him. Saroo is left roaming in the other side of India, were a different language is spoken. With no idea how to get home or find his family. He is left without shelter, coming across homeless kids, and guys that would kidnap the kids for money. Saroo then gets taken in by an orphanage. Were they found a family for him to live with in Australia. John (David Wenham) and Sue (Nicole Kidman) adopted Saroo into their lifestyle. Decades later, Saroo (Dev Patel) taking programs for hotel management. He meets a lovely Lucy (Rooney Mara), who he falls in love with. The one set back that is always preventing from peace is the thought of his real mother worrying. Saroo sets out, from the help of using google earth and retracing his steps on trying to find his hometown in India. Lion turned out to be a really well film. The direction and cinematography capturing the India settings and the culture lifestyle. Also, the music score also set the mood and tone of the movie. It is a beautiful score and the sense of wonder that it creates. It is a sad emotional story of a journey that Saroo goes through. Even in the final moments of the movie, the scene was emotionally powerful seeing these people reconnect. What I really like about the film as well is the language spoken. Saroo and his brother spoke Hindi throughout the first half of the movie. Hollywood didn't have to tamper the material by having the characters speak English. Sunny Pawar is a charming talented kid. It is an emotional roller coaster seeing this kid go on the journey of trying to find his home. When it comes to a scene, were he has a bent spoon and going through the motions, pretending to eat soup when he is starving. And mimicking a young guy in a café shop eating soup was very hard to watch. Dev Patel is a great actor, playing an older Saroo and how his inner self is struggling with the thought that his mother is worried. Rooney Mara is a beautiful actress. David Wenham and Nicole Kidman are both great. Lion is a really good biographical film, which at times may be difficult to watch seeing homeless kids struggle. The journey Saroo goes through is a powerful one and from the final moments in the movie. Should bring tears of joy seeing how everything is resolved. Definitely worth checking out for its story, the acting, and the movie itself is well done.",9,0,0,16 May 2017
The Lost City of Z," A mans obsession on achieving his goal for a search on the lost city.
","A mans obsession on finding the lost city in the amazon can achieve his goal. The Lost City of Z is an adventurous drama film based on a British explorer Percy Fawcett (Charlie Hunnam). I thought the film was fast paced and explored several years and the events attempts of Fawcett going out in the amazon to map survey and finding artifacts about a lost city. The plot follows Percy, who is assigned to survey the amazon and to follow a river path that is in uncharted territories. Costin (Robert Pattinson) is also with him on this journey, were they will come across indigenous tribes. Percy made the sacrifice to go on this several year journey, leaving his pregnant wife Nina (Sienna Miller) behind, along with his son Jack (Tom Holland). This struggle on taking this assignment is difficult on being away from his family but he will claim his family's name, if he does this task. Percy and Costin traveling through the rivers, coming across a tribe that is cannibalistic on eating their own with a belief of setting their spirit free when this tradition is done. They reach the rivers end only to see pottery artifacts that Percy believes there was once an advanced civilizations and a lost city. They arrive home, only to see his son all grown up and his wife. His obsession on finding this lost city which could have gold and ancient artifacts gets worse. With the support of his son Jack, who is willing to go with his father to go searching for this city.What I liked about the film is it is well paced when it begins with Percy in the military and getting offered to go on an expedition. Many years go by, and seeing Percy and his relationship with his wife, slowly getting distant when he is gone for so many years. When he is home, his desire to go back out is always putting his own family in second to this obsession. The film does have an incredible tone and direction seeing Percy and Costin traveling in the amazon with tribes that are attacking them and the eerie wilderness. The cinematography work was impressive. The cast did great. Charlie Hunnam delivered a good performance with a characters obsession that he will never give up his dreams on this search. Robert Pattinson also had a better performance as well. Sienna Miller did great. Along with Tom Holland and his short appearance. What I did not liked about the film is I did feel like the movie was quite long. It did have a perfect flow with the pace and storytelling. But it started to slow down in the final half hour of the movie when Percy was giving up and his son motivated him to go back into this expedition. Overall, The Lost City of Z is a good adventure drama film with great performances, direction, and plot. Especially with this being based on an actual explorer and the events that led to his disappearance in 1925.",8,2,7,30 April 2017
Captain America: The First Avenger," Awesome action, good story but cheesy direction and decent visual effects.
","(3.5 out of 5 stars).Captain America is a pretty fair addition to the marvel universe. Good plot and origin story of Steve Rogers played by Chris Evans. Chris Evans is great as the character. The cast ensemble is a good one. The story taking place in 1940s during WWII. An experimental drug that gives Steve superhuman strength. There are plenty of fun and big action sequences to make this a fun summer blockbuster. The villain Redskull played by Hugo Weaving was good. I will say the films direction is kind of cheesy with playing Captain America like a propaganda film. And the cheesy music score by Alan Silvestri was cheesy. The visual effects are decent. Not the best. Especially, the cheesy look with skinny Steve Rogers. And some of the action visuals effects looked weird.The ending was awesome without giving away much spoilers. Which makes the next film thrilling and exciting to look forward too. Plus an exciting post credit tease on what's to come next.",7,1,1,23 April 2020
Bohemian Rhapsody," Bohemian Rhapsody is a triumphant of Queen and Freddie Mercury rise to fame.
","Bohemian Rhapsody (5 out of 5 stars).Bohemian Rhapsody is a pure triumphant of a biographical film about the lead singer Freddie Mercury and some brief events of his life and the british rock band Queen. If you love Queen or never heard of them, you may enjoy the film. The film moves at a fast pace and it never had a dull moment or a scene that was prolonged with unnecessary dialogue. It may not be detailed or went into extended focus on Freddie's life.The plot follows Freddie (Rami Malek) showing his earlier years when he was a baggage handler at the airport. When he met a local band that lost their lead singer. They recruit him to sing for them and got a few hits with a couple of songs. Years go by, they get albums made and go on tours. Freddie's marriage with Mary (Lucy Boynton) is struggling cause of his sexuality is interested in man. The film also focuses on the rocky relationship with Freddie and the rest of the Queen band. And towards their regroup to sing for the Live Aid in 1985.The film may not gather every detailed historical event of Freddie's life. It briefly showed when he was working at the airport, meeting Brian May, Roger Taylor, and John Deacon. Then, years go by and they are meeting managers and recording albums. Their experimental rock band was hitting the ground. So much that one of the managers played by Mike Myers rejected their offer of a six minute song of Bohemian Rhapsody that no one will know who Queen is. Love Mike Myer's portrayal as the character which he is nearly unrecognizable. The film also goes over briefly of Freddie's failed marriage cause he was sexually attracted to men. When he falls for Paul, one of his managers. Which he was manipulating most of Freddie's choices.The film does pack a punch with emotions that you feel for Freddie and his band. As Freddie tells his band that they are all legends. The moment you see him becoming sick with an illness. It was getting emotional to see him trying to get his band back together for the Live Aid concert. Every song that was playing in the movie from Queen was just pure awesome. It was loud, it was fun, and the story packed a punch of emotions with Freddie and his band. A scene with Freddie visiting his parents with his partner was also an emotional touch as he and his disapproving father hugged it out.Rami Malek was perfect as Freddie Mercury. Lucy Boynton was great as Mary. Gwilym Lee, Ben Hardy, and Joseph Mazzello playing the band members were all great.Overall, Boehmian Rhapsody is a great biographical film. The film pays great homage to Queen. Freddie Mercury's story of his growth to Fame and the powerful moment during the Live Aid concert was just pure spectacular. I loved every minute of the film.",10,2,3,4 November 2018
Bird Box," Suspense and thrills but with a weak ending.
","Bird Box (4 out of 5 stars).Bird Box is bit of a scary apocalyptic thriller film with a concept of blindfolding yourself to survive from some supernatural entity that will cause you to commit suicide. We already got a horror movie that played with the concept of keeping quiet such as A Quiet Place. Bird Box messes with a concept of closing your eyes when walking through the apocalyptic lands.The plot was good. It is a survival thriller. About a pregnant Malorie (Sandra Bullock) who gets caught up in a mass epidemic of people committing suicides. She gets rescued by Tom (Trevante Rhodes) and held up in a house with Cheryl (Jacki Weaver), Lucy (Rosa Salazar), Olympia (Danielle Macdonald), and Douglas (John Malkovich). They figure out there is some kind entity that is causing people to commit suicide. Some kind of evil that cannot be seen nor can you look at it. They will have to gather their resources, stay inside, and watch out for any other threats that may be lurking outside.The plot begins with Malorie and two children crossing a river. Trying to get to a safe haven. While it flashes five years earlier; Malorie surviving with a group of people in a house. The plot is a bit of a mystery on what is causing this threat. Without going much into details, it does leave it open and vague with what this threat is. From the maniac people that are obsessed with this supernatural thing. By the time the film reaches its end, you still do not get a direct answer on what it is. Which is for the best cause it does leave you feeling chills with characters being chased by some invisible thing. The direction and music score also helped build the suspense and thrills. The music score by Trent Reznor and Atticus Ross helped create the chills feeling when something is lurking outside with people trying to hide from an unstoppable force.Sandra Bullock delivered a great performance. Trevante Rhodes was also good as well. However, I did feel like the film was having trouble coming close to its climatic end. Yes, it is a survival story with Malorie and two children trying to find a safe haven. But once you reach the end, you will be asking yourself, that's it? It ends a little too quickly without an actual climax.Overall, Bird Box is a good apocalyptic thriller. It does deliver some suspenseful chills with its direction and music score. The plot and concept was good with the survival story with blindfolding yourself and walking through the apocalyptic city. And the performances were great.",8,0,1,27 December 2018
Baby Driver," Baby Baby Driver is fun, action packed, and all style with its music choices.
","Baby Driver is pure fun and awesome. Car chases, bank robberies, and a driver that uses music cues to help him focus. The movie works as a musical with a variety of classic artists and it all worked perfectly in their own way. Edgar Wright direction is stylized and fast paced. There is plenty to love about the movie. If you love action, it has it. If you love car chases, you have it. If you love music, it has some great choices. If you also love a bit of romance, it has a bit of a love story. The plot follows Baby (Ansel Elgort) a getaway driver that relies on music that he makes with his own personal playlists, even he mixes sound from recordings. After an accident he was involved in with his parents that caused him to have tinnitus. He uses the music to block out the ringing in his ears. He is a getaway driver for a mastermind Doc (Kevin Spacey). He owes him two bank robbery jobs and he is out from the criminal organization. He meets a lovely waitress Debora (Lily James), who also wants to run away to travel. Baby is forced to do one big last job with a team of a psychopath Bats (Jamie Foxx), Darling (Eiza Gonzalez), and Jason (Jon Hamm). The plot was fast paced and great. About a young man who knows whats right and wrong. But wants to seek for a better life. He is conflicted with living life in the fast lane and being a professional driver. His character is awkward, he is shy, and he keeps to himself. He does express the music he listens too. Either by lip singing or dancing into a musical as he walks to a café. But when he is behind the wheel, he is unstoppable. The action and car chases are exciting and plenty throughout. Edgar Wright relied on practical realistic stunts than cgi which is always the best. Feel like the car chases were more alive and thrilling than the film Drive. The direction gets serious when Baby is wanting a way out but is forced into this world. While he wants to go far away and live his life and fall in love with Debora. He tries to protect Debora from knowing whom he works for and keeping his team from knowing who she is. This is one of Ansel Elgort better performances and I really hope to see him do more serious roles like this. Lily James is beautiful and stunning, she plays her character well as his love interest. Jon Bernthal as the brute player in the gang. Jon Hamm and Eiza Gonzalez as a couple, and psychotic when something makes them unhappy. Jamie Foxx playing the tempered gangster were anything can happen that will set off his mood swings. The soundtrack in the movie was spot on great. It worked with every scene and sequence. Mainly, relying on some of the greatest classic bands. Overall, Baby Driver is an awesome action film. The cast was great. The action and car chases were loud and exciting and plenty throughout. The plot was great about a getaway driver wanting to seek for a better life and falling in love with a girl that is turning his life direction around. The direction and script was fast paced and pure style.",10,22,44,29 June 2017
Justice League," Justice League is a fun ride. And an awesome start for the DC universe. Cant wait for more.
","The long awaited Justice League is finally here after a long production of reshoots, and after the negative critical reaction with most of the DC movies except for Wonder Woman. DC has been struggling with the critic's reviews unlike the friendly Marvel movies. I will say and admit I enjoyed every DC film to date from Man of Steel, BvS, Suicide Squad, and Wonder Woman. They are just pure entertainment. The characters are dark, the action is visually explosive, and it does feel like a perfect tone that can match up to a comic book style with the characters. Justice League is pure fun, action packed throughout, and it also has some quirky fun humor which is a little lighter in tone if you compared it to BvS that was a bit dark and serious.Justice League is no Avengers and most of the Marvel movies which they may be stronger when it comes to their storytelling. Justice does everything that you can expect for a DC movie. Lots of action, visual effects, cool fun characters teaming up, and also a cliché villain like Steppenwolf. If you expect some high level-hitting story, you may miss out in this movie.For a short run time of 2 hours, the shortest DC movie. It does run at a fast pace with Bruce Wayne (Ben Affleck) trying to assemble a team of heroes like Aquaman (Jason Momoa), Flash (Ezra Miller), Cyborg (Ray Fisher), and Wonder Woman (Gal Gadot). After the death of Superman (Henry Cavill), Bruce will need help with this team to battle against Steppenwolf (Ciaran Hinds) who is planning on finding three mother boxes on Earth to annihilate for complete power. At this fast pace, the film does briefly run through any character development with these new additions. There is plenty of fun to be had with these characters. Flash and Aquaman were fun and added a great mix up with the team. Cyborg does feel a little underwritten character in the movie. Only wish there was more to his character. Steppenwolf is the cliché villain that shows up out of nowhere and ready to destroy the planet. But when he does show up, the chase scene with the Amazonians trying to escape with the box with him hunting them down was intense. And this type of movie, you do not need a highly developed villain. Justice League does have a bigger, loud, and visually packed action to keep you on the edge of your seats. And it is why we go to the theatres in the first place. There are also some fun easter eggs thrown in there. Danny Elfman music score was actually good as well. I was disappointed that they replaced Junkie XL with him when Joss Whedon came on board for reshoots and editing. The movies music score does have that feel like a late 1980s superhero movie with some hint of original theme songs which was cool. But it was not entirely distracting when modernizing the themes. Overall, Justice League is awesome. Lots of visually packed action. A great fun cast ensemble and characters that worked great as the team up. And cant wait to see more. The plot is more linear and straightforward compared to the choppy BvS. It is pure fun.I rate the film 5 out of 5 stars. I definitely recommend the film to see on the big screen.",10,5,12,19 November 2017
The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring," Amazing effects and a great epic storytelling.
",The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring (5 out of 5 stars).The film is amazing and a great start of a trilogy. When i first saw it not knowing it was a trilogy. I thought the film dragged on and was cheesy with the acting. And the movie ending being incomplete. After realizing it was a trilogy of books and movies. It is a great start for a first movie. I love the cast ensemble and they all did great. Peter Jacksons direction defies a whole new fantasy genre and epic storytelling with his writers. The plot is great. I never thought the movie was slow for a three hour film. The visual effects are great. The film does have some exciting battle sequences with the characters facing against trolls. Orcs. And a demonic looking beasts.The music score. Cinematography. The script. The cast. And direction is all amazing for a wonderful start for the first movie out of the trilogy.,10,1,1,1 April 2020

Split," Split exceeded my expectations and may see a comeback from director after several duds with his films.
","Split is one of M. Night Shyamalan's better work so far and he has been having a lot of duds with his previous films. He is a hit and a miss with his films. Split is an entertaining effective psychological thriller film that showcases James McAvoy's performance as a guy with 23 personalities and his mysterious 24th personality that would soon arrive. Kevin (James McAvoy) kidnaps three girls Claire (Haley Lu Richardson), Marcia (Jessica Sula), and Casey (Anya Taylor-Joy). He sticks them in an underground basement. Tries to take care of them, so they can meet the 24th personality known as 'the beast.' I will say the plot was very intriguing and it is best not to reveal too much. It is better seeing the film and being surprised by the twist. Sure, audience will again either like the end results or hate it. I will say it is not the best movie. It could have been a whole lot worst. The concept was interesting with a guy having multiple personality disorder. And how every characteristics was prepping for the mystery 24th personality. The script does add some strong thematic situations that focuses on Casey and the flashbacks of her camping trip with her father and uncle. Yet again, cannot say much more. Her past will come into a factor during the climax. I did not find Split to be scary; I think it plays more as a thriller. The tension slowly builds up to the climax. Which the film can get slow and dull for a moment. During the second act, with the three girls trying to figure out how to escape and trying to understand Kevin's personalities. And maybe trying to outsmart one of them. Also, in this act, we have Barry (one of the personalities) that is constantly visiting psychologists Dr. Karen (Betty Buckley) for a quick therapy session, which she is trying to connect for his sudden behavior. Once, the 24th personality is revealed, the suspense is non-stop until the end. James McAvoy gave an impressive performance, granted only portraying a few personalities on screen. If it was not for him, feel like the film would not have been as good. Anya Taylor-Joy gave an emotionless performance as Casey, who is haunted from her past and being kidnapped with her friends. She is an up and growing actress from films like The Witch and Morgan. Split is an improvement for an M. Night Shyamalan film. Most of his films have been pretty boring or had a terrible ending like The Visit, The Happening, etc. But he does have some standing work like Signs. The ending in Split, may have the audience talking right after and discussing the possibility. I liked the direction he was taking Split and the concept idea. It is one of those films you need to see for yourself.. I ll recommend Split, if your looking for thrills or enjoy M. Night's mystery direction. Split is a pretty fair film that exceeded my expectations and I dislike most of his films.",7,1,9,21 January 2017
Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse," Spectacular and crazy wild ride bringing a new take on Spider-Man.
","Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse (5 out of 5 stars).Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse proves that after a few times rebooting a Spider man origin story into a movie can never get old. You would think there is plenty of different Spider Man movies done so quickly within the last 15 years. Into the Spider Verse takes a different approach. Approaching the material and adapting the comic book into a movie. With colorful animation and visuals with the word effects or comic book action violence. The movie is spectacular and one of the best Spider Man movies ever.From the help of Phil Lord and Christopher Miller (the people who did the 21 Jump Street movies and Lego Movies) takes the comic book material and they bring a kinetic energy with the story. The plot follows Miles (Shameik Moore) a teenager who is forced into private school with his father being a police officer and a mother that is busy as a nurse. He gets bit by a radioactive spider. And he notices changes such as having sticky fingers and being toned out. When the Kingpin tries to turn on a particle accelerator which Peter Parker/Spider-Man fails to stop him. He asks Miles to learn to take the responsibility and stop Kingpin. Miles meets other Spider-Mans from other alternate universes such as a burnt out Peter Parker (who is out of shape, careless, and depressed looking), Spider-Ham (a talking pig), Peni Parker (a young girl with a spider robot), and Gwen Stacy (Spider girl).The film does have a lot of throwback references that brings in some easter eggs from Sam Raimi Spider man movies. The film is a lot of fun. The most fun you will ever have watching a superhero movie on the big screen. Director Bob Persichetti, Peter Ramsey, and Rodney Rothman did a fantastic job in adapting the comic book into an animated film. The animation is slick, stylized, and colorful. If you are sensitive to flashy lights and fast paced changing colors it may be a difficult film to see. The characters are a lot of fun. Miles is that type of likable character were you can try to relate too. The villain Kingpin did look a bit cheesy with having a gigantic body that seems very inhuman. But it was a lot of fun. The story and direction runs at a kinetic fast pace energy. And the action sequences are stylized and exciting.Overall, Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse is a great film. Definitely a recommended film if you are into comic books or superhero movies. This Spider Man is a lot of fun. It has a fast paced story, it has action, and the animation/ visuals are entertaining with a comic book brought to the big screen. The soundtrack in the film which brings in a hip hop tone works great with the movie.",10,1,3,21 March 2019

Dunkirk," Dunkirk is an intense experience, impressive with every work done on the film. It was spectacular.
","Dunkirk is an intense war film that grabs you in the first minute and does not let you go until the end credits roll. I will have to say probably one of the best war films. Christopher Nolan has added his signature style with a non linear storytelling with three story narratives that collides with each other, amazing cinematography work by Hoyte van Hoytema, impressive action sequences that relies on practical stunt work even the cat and mouse aerial combat scene, and music composer Hans Zimmer score was great. Dunkirk literally is one big battle for survival from the beginning moments of hearing the time ticking and seeing Fionn Whitehead running across town with snipers shooting at him to reaching the beach of Dunkirk awaiting with the other soldiers as they are being evacuated. Nolan creates the intensity very well knowing anything can happen at any moment from bombs falling to being shot at. There is no safety for these soldiers that were fighting for survival to get home. The plot follows 400,000 soldiers that were waiting to be evacuated from Dunkirk. As a couple of ships were coming to take them out of there. The German planes kept attacking them from above. And only a few spitfire pilots Farrier (Tom Hardy) were the only defense against the Germans. The plot was kept fairly simple with no politics getting involved or the backstory to these characters. It starts with bullets flying and these soldiers trying to survive. Nolan did not try to add any character development since it was focused on the entire war experience. We could already sympathize on these people because they were young soldiers who are desperate for survival. The action sequences are throughout the movie. It starts with it and builds the suspense and momentum. Nolan is best at trying to make you feel anxious along with these characters. Hans Zimmer score had to be playing throughout and really helped with the suspense building. The sound editing and design was impressive from every bullet sound to explosions to the fighter planes roaring across the screen. Every scene of the movie was engaging and difficult to take your eyes away from it. The aerial combat sequence throughout was the best combat fighting ever done in a movie. It puts the audience in the cockpit with the pilot or seeing it through pov on the plane. It was a wild ride seeing this. There were also some claustrophobic moments as the soldiers are in a ship in the cafeteria and an explosion out of nowhere floods the boat. It can be scary to see what these guys went through. The cast ensemble were bunch of unknown actors but they all did there best like Fionn Whitehead, Tom Glynn-Carney, Jack Lowden, Harry Styles, and so much more. Then, there is Mark Rylance, Cillian Murphy, and Tom Hardy who all did great. The film does have less talking and a lot of suspenseful action. I feel like every actor had at least ten lines. And it never slows down to catch a breath. Which makes the pacing of the movie spectacular. Being Nolans shortest film since his earlier films. The tone of the movie felt like a ticking time bomb. The non linear plot structure worked so well. The effort has to go to the editor Lee Smith, who structured the film so well as three narrative stories interconnecting. Every scene kept the film running with anxiety and suspense. Overall, Dunkirk is a great war film that I definitely recommend checking out in theatres. There is a lot of action and suspense building to put you on the edge of your seat. The cinematographer, the editing, music score, the cast ensemble, and all the practical effects like the aerial combat and action is amazing.",10,5,17,21 July 2017
Pearl Harbor," Breath taking, emotional, and very intense with Michael Bays direction.
","Pearl Harbor (5 out of 5 stars).Pearl Harbor is an amazing intense war film based on true events of the day Pearl Harbor was attacked. The film is breath taking with Michael Bays fast direction. The opening moments seeing Ray and Dannys friendship grow from childhood to adulthood with them being pilots.The plot is great. Following Ray and Danny going into military. Ray falling for a girl Evelyn. He goes away into combat. Which has that predictable love triangle with Danny and Evelyn. All while the day comes which the attack on Pearl Harbor tangles their lives and many others.The first hour build up was great. Ray and Evelyns love story.

The climax gets emotional with the characters.Overall, Pearl Harbor is an awesome great film.",10,1,3,28 March 2020
Yesterday," Fun, entertaining, and a little too long.
","Yesterday (3.5 out of 5 stars).Yesterday is a fun romantic comedy film that has a silly plot, a good cast, and fun musical sequences. The plot follows a struggling musician Jack (Himesh Patel) who is losing the crowd and only has his long time friends that are there for him. One of them being his love interest since childhood Ellie (Lily James). One night as he is riding home on his bike. The electricity goes out all around the world. And when it comes back. A bus hit him accidently. He wakes up the next morning who is the only one around the world that knows about the Beatles. Which he tries to remember every song so he can sing to it on stage.It is a fun and cheesy plot with the Beatles playing an important part in the movie. The film also tries to have that love story without it being too settled. Himesh Patel can sing and the songs he performs on screen are great. Lily James also does a great job as well. The film also has Ed Sheeran playing a small role.It is an entertaining film. I did find the movie running a little too long or feeling a little dragged on in the second act.Overall, Yesterday is a pretty fair film. The cast did great. The plot is cheesy and fun.

Resident Evil," Entertaining and a fun zombie thriller.
","Resident Evil 5 out of 5 stars.Great action sequences. I am a huge fan of the game series. May not be the best adaptation. For a movie trying to be its own thing was great.

Avengers: Endgame," Spectacular finale to a great long franchise of MCU films.
","Avengers: Endgame (5 out of 5 stars).Avengers: Endgame is a magnificent awesome superhero film that concludes the infinity stones storyline that has been building up with 22 movies in the Marvel universe. They had done a great job building up each solo character and have there films bring something new and exciting. Endgame is the game changer that delivers the ultimate climax of the story arc with the big bad Thanos (Josh Brolin) going up against the Avengers. After the previous film Infinity War leaving the audience hanging with the cliffhanger. Marvel has done a great job in marketing and keeping this film spoilers free with the trailers that only show the same footage and very minimum. Which I will say it is best to see the film knowing very little about what is going to happen.I will try to keep this review spoiler free. Endgame is amazing and spectacular. Joe and Anthony Russo direction was fantastic and they did a great job in delivering a spectacular climax of the MCU. The plot was amazing. For a three hour long film. The film does move pretty fast and kind of feels short when watching it. I did feel like Endgame is a little short on the action set pieces like the previous films. Which this film does focus more on the emotional connections with the original Avengers like Iron Man (Robert Downey Jr), Thor (Chris Hemsworth), Captain America (Chris Evans), Black Widow (Scarlett Johansson), and Clint Barton (Jeremy Renner) and how they were all affected by the aftermath of Infinity War. The film does have a lot of fun and feels like a wild adventure with what these characters go through. The final hour delivers all out with an epic climax which every character has a moment to shine. And makes up for the lack of action in the movie. I love how every hero works with another when fighting there enemy. There were some moments where you will be in an awe and clapping moment with the climatic battle sequence. The visual effects are top notch great. There is some fun humor that will lighten the mood of the film. And there are some tear jerking moments that will leave you feeling happy and sad at the same time. The directors did a wonderful job in surprising the audience with something new and reaching every characters full potential. The climatic fight scene with Thor, Cap America, and Iron Man teaming up and bouncing around with there super powers are just awesome. The surprises do keep on coming throughout. Which will leave you feeling satisfied.Overall, Avengers: Endgame is a great and awesome superhero film. It is one of the best finales that Joe and Anthony Russo have delivered. The plot was amazing and fast moving. The direction focuses more on the emotional side of the characters and story. While delivering an epic climatic showdown that will have you grasping and excited. The cast ensemble was great. I will say this is one fun wild ride that I am happy how it ties the story arc together.",10,146,279,27 April 2019

Toy Story 4," The fourth Toy Story delivers the charms, characters we love, and a great emotional ending that we deserve.
","Toy Story 4 (4 out of 5 stars).Toy Story 4 delivers a great concluding story after believing the third film in the series was the last. Toy Story 3 was good and it had an emotional satisfying end with the theme Andy growing up and going to college. He is growing distant with his gang of toys with Woody and his friends. He passes his collection of toys to Bonnie. Sure, the film does answer a question about Bo Peeps absence in the third film. Which the film begins with a flash back several years ago explaining Bo Peeps absence. Now, the present time Bonnie has been having a great time with her toys. She has been distant with Woody which he has been placed inside the closet. But when she starts Kindergarten. And makes a new toy out of a spork. She becomes obsessed with the spork toy she made and called him Forky. Forky believing he is just a kitchen utensil and belongs in the trash. Woody tries to babysit Forky and keeping him close with Bonnie. As they go on a road trip. They lose Forky on the road. Woody decides to chase him down and to bring him back to Bonnie. Along the way, they come across a carnival and an antique store of unwanted toys. That is when Woody sees Bo Peep again. When he comes across another toy of a doll named Gabby Gabby. Who wants Woody's voice box so she can talk and maybe get a child to take her along. Buzz Lightyear embarks on a mission to find Woody and Forky and to bring them back.Toy Story 4 delivers another great sequel. It did not feel like Disney was aiming for another cash grab and an unnecessary sequel. The story does conclude some characters arc. The theme of where do toys go when the child no longer wants them? And what do the toys do next? It does have another emotional ending which is sad and satisfying. The animation is beautiful and colorful. I remember the first movie being one of the best animation films ever. The fourth film comes along way. And is one of those film series with all four movies having a theme and a story that works so well.The characters of Woody and Buzz are back. There are some new additions like Forky, a confused spork. He is adorable, funny, and entertaining. Bo Peep is back as a stronger and an independent woman. Then, there is Ducky and Bunny which they are a funny duo. Duke Caboom voiced by the noticeable Keanu Reeves was entertaining. And the villain Gabby Gabby can be menacing with her several dummies that she commands. She was also a fun addition.Tom Hanks and Tim Allen and the rest of the voice talent were all great with their roles. I did feel like the film was a bit anti climatic with characters rescuing and escaping while getting side tracked. But the film is pure enjoyment for adults and kids.Overall, Toy Story 4 is a good film. It has a great theme and story that makes it a perfect conclusion to the series. The characters are fun. The animation is beautifully done. The voice talent is amazing. This sequel is definitely worth it.",8,31,58,22 June 2019
Batman Begins," A nice complex masterpiece of a comic book film.
","Batman Begins (5 out of 5).Batman Begins is an awesome masterpiece of a reboot to the superhero franchise. Director/Screenwriter Christopher Nolan did a fantastic job-recreating Batman. Not by telling the same story like the previous Batman movies were we see the caped crusader facing against a new villain. Nolan takes us to were it all began. It is an origin story. We see Bruce Wayne doing everything for the first time. From jumping on rooftops without his wings or grappling hook. The plot does not follow in a chronological order within the first hour of the movie. But it works great with Nolan's direction set up. It begins with a kid Bruce Wayne falling in an old water well and facing against Bats. Than it cuts to an older Bruce Wayne, imprisoned in a different country and comes across Henri (Liam Neeson) who is giving him a second chance at redemption. Bruce is left traveling through and coming across ninjas that are being trained for the league of Shadows. Then, it flashes towards a young adult Bruce who is visiting the trial for his parents murderer. And only to see Gotham city being corrupted. After Bruce training, he comes back to Gotham to be the caped crusader and to stop a bigger threat from the mob. And Dr. Jonathan Crane (Cillian Murphy) who is corrupted and plotting a threat to Gotham.The plot was well organized. The script was fantastic. The action sequences are awesome. You have an exciting Batmobile known as the tumbler being chased by the police. Batman facing against criminals. And a villain scarecrow, which uses a toxic gas to make people see their own fears. The concept and setting is dark for a superhero film. But Batman is supposed to be in that direction. Christian Bale was fantastic. Michael Caine, Katie Holmes, Gary Oldman, Cillian Murphy, and Liam Neeson were all great. Sure, there are some twists and surprises with the villains. And an exciting climatic battle with Batman fighting in a moving train. Overall, Batman Begins is an awesome film. Nolan did the character justice. The script gave the proper treatment to the development and plot. The direction was sharp, clever, and exciting for an origin story. Plus the cliffhanger ending that opens for a sequel and the direction on the villain is great.",10,0,0,20 August 2018

Avengers: Infinity War," Brilliant and an epic showdown of the MCU that is breathtaking and exciting.
","Avengers: Infinity War (5 out of 5 stars).Avengers: Infinity War is an epic awesome fun superhero film that is basically the climatic battle of the MCU that has been leading up to this since the very first Iron Man movie. And surprisingly, it does not disappoint. Marvel has been doing well with its storytelling over 19 superhero movies and counting. And every one has been giving hints of the infinity stones or a big bad villain that will soon arrive like Thanos. And Thanos is the groundbreaking villain that will shake the line up of heroes and possibly changing the direction of the rest of the MCU. The plot follows right after the events of Thor: Ragnarok. Thor and Loki and the rest of the Asgardians come across Thanos. And his desire for hunting down every Infinity Stone to annihilate half of the universe. Meanwhile on Earth, Doctor Strange and Iron Man face against danger that lands with Thano's adoptive children who are searching for the remaining stones on Earth. While, the Guardians of the Galaxy are on a race against time on trying to stop Thanos from reaching the final stone. The plot had the Avengers getting separated into their own adventures. Yes, it involves trying to protect the stones or racing against time to find them before he gets it. You have Spider Man, Doc Strange, and Iron Man taking the fight on Thanos home planet. Rocket, Groot, and Thor searching for a weapon. The rest of the Guardians are trying to stop Thanos. Then, Captain America, Black Panther, and Scarlett Witch trying to protect the remaining stone on Earth. Characters were everywhere and had there own objective. Thanos is a villain that is set on world domination. And the writers did add a little emotion to his character and his reasoning behind his motivations of destroying everything. He is the force of nature that will test every Avenger. Sure, some may complain that there are too many characters. Yes, there is. But the writers tried to keep a well-balanced screen time on giving every character enough progression to the story. Which makes this 2 and half hour running time feeling pretty short when several characters are on a different journey that eventually crosses paths. The visual effects and action sequences are plenty throughout and exciting. It is epic. The first ten minutes with Thanos threatening characters and attacking does leave you with chills. There are some awe, shocking, and haunting moments. And some fun humor with characters interacting with each other. When you get so many high ego heroes in one spot together can be hilarious. And than you have the Guardians which they always light up the mood. Every character has a spot to shine with the fight sequences. Then, an epic climatic battle in Wakanda. And the final moments of the film is pretty haunting. Which may leave the audience talking once the credits roll. This shocking cliffhangar does leave you hanging for the next Avengers movie. Especially, on where the direction can go next. Which is best to avoid all spoilers and media to see for yourself. Overall, Avengers: Infinity War is a great superhero film. The plot is epic. Our heroes go through several exciting action set pieces to face against the ultimate villain. The film does have a huge cast ensemble as it is. And every one does get their fair share of screen time. Except for a couple of characters that were absent in this film (there roles are probably saved for the fourth film). The visual effects are amazing. And the action sequences are plenty throughout. There is a lot of action from beginning to end to keep you on the edge of your seat. Especially, when characters lives are at stake. The film does end with a shocking cliffhanger, which will leave you pondering on where the fourth Avengers movie will go. I recommend seeing this film on the big screen. If you seen any of the MCU movies or the previous Avengers film. This is definitely one of the best movies and the climatic part of the Marvel universe. Also, stay tune for the final post credit scene which is an important set up for the next Marvel chapter.",10,3,8,28 April 2018
Once Upon a Time... in Hollywood," Golden age of Hollywood delivers with Tarantino's witty script and direction.
","Once Upon a Time in Hollywood (4 out of 5 stars).Once Upon a Time in Hollywood is Quentin Tarantino's love letter to the 1960s Hollywood era. Tarantino is a huge film geek from the 60s/70s era. His latest film is fun, entertaining, and very moving. What can you expect in Tarantino's film? A huge cast ensemble, an overlong running time, a slow moving story with a lot of dialogue in his script, a sharp 60s direction, and this time just a brutal fight climax that does not over do it like his other films.The plot is a dramatic/ comedic love letter to the 60s Hollywood era. It follows a struggling actor Rick (Leonardo DiCaprio) who is trying to make it big into movies and getting out from doing western tv shows. His stunt double Cliff (Brad Pitt) and him are best friends. They do a lot of work together. Cliff gets caught up and notices a bunch of hippie girls in a film ranch that he once knew. Which these group of girls are following a serial killer Charles Manson (Damon Herriman).It is a slow moving plot. If you are a fan of the 1960s Hollywood theme. This film will be quite enjoyable. Leonardo DiCaprio is great playing Rick Dalton. An actor that is trying hard with his roles in the movie. Brad Pitt was good. There is a huge cast ensemble like Margot Robbie playing Sharon Tate, which she is living with her husband Roman and her ex boyfriend Sebring (Emile Hirsch). Living right next to Rick.The film is entertaining with its 1960s setting, the golden age of Hollywood, and a cult following Charles Mansion. The style, clothing, and the vintage soundtrack are fun. Brad Pitt and Leonardo DiCaprio on screen chemistry worked great. Seeing the two on screen was a lot of fun and captivating. Rick is usually seen acting in a western show and trying to deliver his best when he is not messing up his lines. Cliff picks up a hitchhiker girl and takes her to a film ranch which he finds it suspicious.The film does have a thrilling and suspenseful climax without getting too much into details. It might be a hit or a miss with the audience, especially the ending of the film. Cause you are curious on what Quentin Tarantino's targeting tone of the movie is trying to be. It is not as bloody compared to Hateful Eight or his other films. It does have a brutal fight scene. The film does end a little too abruptly with you asking that's it? Which it apparently is, and it was not the kind of story you were expecting.Overall, Once Upon a Time in Hollywood is a good comedy drama film. It is one of Quentin Tarantino's better films. It is a slow moving story, a fun sharp direction by Tarantino and his witty script. The cast was great. It does get a little lost with the tone and ending.",8,11,19,27 July 2019
Get Out," Get Out is a smart suspenseful thriller and one of the better horror movies up to date.
","The fear of meeting the significant others parents has always been an anxiety of wondering how they are like. The anxiety of trying to impress them, the background history or even the appearance can make you feel a little nervous. Director/writer Jordan Peele first film and tackling a horror genre at that makes a pretty entertaining movie. He definitely has his work cut out as a director by making the one thing couples usually have an anxiety about and twisting it around.The film follows Chris (Daniel Kaluuya) and his girlfriend Rose (Allison Williams) are planning a small trip to visit her parents. He is afraid they will judge him for being a black guy. They arrive at their country side house, were Chris notices that there is a black guy doing work on their yard or a house maid. Which her parents assure him that they are not prejudice. When his girlfriends mother does an hypnosis session with him. He notices that everyone there may not be who they say they are.Get Out is a great suspenseful horror movie. It may not be scary or bloody. It does build the mystery suspense. The moments of Chris noticing the strange behaviors that the house maids are behaving. Her parents behaviors being erratic and cheery and creepy about meeting him and introducing him to other guests in a big party. The concept of hypnosis is also pretty crazy as Chris starts questioning if its his paranoia self about fearing about being judged for his race or if something sinister is going on. Jordan Peele does well building the suspense and the anxiety with a white family having black people as maids.I was very surprised about how awesome this movie was. I had low expectations after watching the trailers and was thinking it would be a cheesy bad acting horror movie. Jordan Peele proved the expectations wrong. It turned out to be a smart suspenseful movie were you root for the main character. Which is rare to see characters make certain decisions which can be frustrating in most horror movies.There is a twist that is best not to reveal or talk about. The less you know or see from the previews the better the surprise will be. The last act and the ending does not disappoint. The movie does have some funny moments and plus a comic relief character that is Chris friend that is always throwing jokes about sex slaves and only trusting the 'brothers' of his kind.Daniel Kaluuya did great which this is my first time seeing him perform on screen. Allison Williams did well as his girlfriend. Bradley Whitford and Catherine Keener both were great and creepy with their characters.Once the twist is revealed, it can be kind of disturbing about whats really going on. Without giving much away. Overall, Get Out is a great horror film. Director Jordan Peele may have a great start working on films. The suspense and funny moments were well balanced. The twist was surprising. The cast and acting were great. The plot and concept of interracial meeting the family and paranoia was entertaining. I definitely recommend the film if you are looking for suspense",10,8,18,21 June 2017
Aladdin," Beautiful, stunning, and a well made adaptation of the original.
","Aladdin (4 out of 5 stars).Aladdin is a beautiful wonderful musical fantasy film that brings the animated classic movie to life. Which director Guy Ritchie does really well in being faithful to the original movie. From similar musical sequences to very much the same story. Sure, there will be some new changes and additions like Will Smith's Genie telling a narrative story in the beginning of the movie. And some new characters like Jasmines Handmaiden, and some new original songs sang by Naomi Scott. Otherwise, fans of the original will love. I know some may find it difficult to accept Will Smith playing Genie. After beloved Robin Williams is so great as the character. Will Smith was fantastic as the character. Brought his fun, outgoing charms, and the musical sequence were great. Will Smith was the perfect choice. Mena Massoud as Aladdin was also good as well. He delivered the charms of a thief, trying to feed the poor, and falling for a princess. Naomi Scott was also good as well. She is beautiful and great as the character. Marwan Kenzari was good as Jafar. A villain that wants power.Guy Ritchie's direction is one of his better films. The film feels like an adventurous kind of movie feeling similar to The Mummy. With the opening credits sequence of the city and the desert landscape of a monstrous cave. The film does have some fun action sequences and chases with Aladdin. The story is similar to the original so don't expect anything new. The musical sequences are also fun and great as well. The best one with Whole New World song sang by Mena Massoud and Naomi Scott were also great. There is also plenty of humor with Aladdin being awkward in talking to the princess. And Genie being his mentor in trying to teach him. The visual effects is also great as well.I will say the movie did feel a little too long with the run time. Feel like the editors can trim the film a little in trying to make it a better pace with the movie. There were some slow moments that dragged on a little.Overall, Aladdin is a good fantasy musical film. The cast did great. Guy Ritchie's direction stuck to the original movie and some new additions with characters and musical sequences. The music was great. The characters were fun and entertaining.",8,11,33,24 May 2019
The Lion King," Beautiful, emotional, and a great live action adaptation.
","The Lion King (5 out of 5 stars).The Lion King is impressive. Probably the next ground breaking with the filmmaker's technology in bringing the animated film to life. With life like settings, the visual effects on the animals and the background. It was amazing and believable. The Disney original film was one of my favorites as a child. Watching this live action brings back the nostalgia feeling. From the opening moment of the circle of life song with the sunrise showing in the landscapes of Africa. Seeing every animal showing up to the Pride rock with Simba being carried over. The film delivers all around. The visual effects are impressive. The story is beautiful, emotional, and adventurous. It is a perfect adaptation of the original. Maybe more new scenery's added the extra screen time. The voice talent was good. Seth Rogen was more noticeable as Pumba which was great. The film does have some exciting action sequences that makes you feel like you are with the characters in action.The plot follows Simba who is a prince and flees away when his uncle Scar takes over the kingdom. From there, he meets Pumba and Timon. Until, he is a lion and Nala tries to get him back to face against Scar and his Hyenas. Every one knows the story if they seen the original Disney film. It is very much the same. It is great seeing it brought to live action. There are a few emotional powerful moments in the film that does get to you. Mufasa and Simba's bonding moments as father and son will bring some tears again. I did feel like Jon Favreau direction did added some extra new scenes to help with the transition with the story. The film does keep true to the musical sequences. Which were all great and had a fun impressive musical scene with the characters. There is a new sequence with a Beyonce song Spirit thrown in the movie with the characters travelling back to their homeland.Jon Favreau direction is fantastic. He did great handling The Jungle Book. He did this film just as well. He delivered the emotional connections with the story and characters. The film had some exciting action scenes. Simba and Nala were great. Mufasa was great. The rest of the characters were all fun as well. The music score by Hans Zimmer is beautiful and inspirational. It does deliver nostalgia and emotional connection.Overall, The Lion King is one of the best Disney's live action film. I loved the original. This live action remake may be a little dark and has less humor than the original. The story is great. The direction, music score, voice talent, the action sequences, visual effects and musical scenes are all impressive. That will deliver with excitement and maybe some tears.",10,2,13,20 July 2019
A Quiet Place," Great direction and a suspense horror film were silence is the key.
","A Quiet Place (4 out of 5 stars).A Quiet Place is a horror film were silence is the key to survival in an apocalyptic world that has been invaded by some unknown creatures that came from space. At least, that was given from the newspapers clippings in a family's basement. Lee (John Krasinski) and his wife Evelyn (Emily Blunt) and there three children are those last few survivors that are amongst the living. They scavenge for supplies and walk throughout with complete silence. They have a path covered so they can walk barefoot. They rarely talk and only communicate by sign language. And they prevent any noise from occurring such as opening doors, dropping stuff, things that make noise, they cook in a covered grill underneath floor, ect. The pros about the film? The film does have an intense buildup. It can be scary. The first five minutes really puts the audience on what they will be expecting. One simple noise will bring a creature running at a full speed to kill them. That is what makes the movie nerve wrecking. Kids make a stupid decision turning on a toy. Accidently knocking a lantern. And than staying in complete silence, hoping the creatures don't come close. The suspenseful moment when Evelyn is going through labor having a baby without screaming was intense. The creature design was interesting. They are blind but have superior hearing. And they are indestructible from nearly everything. But they are quick and fast. John Krasinski did well with his performance. Playing a father that is trying to protect his family. Emily Blunt was great too. The plot and concept was good. They kept the creature backstory only down to newspapers clippings. It is a film about survival and family. As in how far will a person go to protect their children. Director Krasinski may have a cut out with his direction. He built up the suspense and intensity. The music score Marco Beltrami helped putting the audience in edge. The cons of the film? I feel like the film is a bit slow at times. Feels like a silent film with a music score in it. Characters spend majority of the movie using sign language which is neat and cool. Which plays a key to survival. But the film does pick up pretty fast in the second act. Overall, A Quiet Place is a good horror film. It is creepy and intense. It has its mediocre amount of suspense. John Krasinski, Emily Blunt, and the kids were great. The direction and music score was good. Krasinski may have a knack to making a good horror movie which in the third act it gets a little wild. I recommend seeing this film in theatres to get the full experience with the creepy silent moments and music pumping its loud volume to build the suspense.",8,3,6,7 April 2018
Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Men Tell No Tales," Dead Man Tell No Tales is fun and all with visual set pieces but does feel like its on hallow waters.
","Dead Man Tell No Tales may not entirely be dead on the water as the series may be running its course after a pointless fourth installment. Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Man Tell No Tales is a slight improvement over the last movie which focuses on new characters and a plot with emotionally driven characters that are on the search for the trident of Poseidon. Like how the first three Pirates movies were, when the story usually focused on Will Turner (Orlando Bloom) and Elizabeth ( Keira Knightley) and Jack Sparrow (Johnny Depp) was just the comic relief. Then, The Strangers Tide film had Jack as the center of the story and failed to carry the movie, also besides the fact Johnny Depp has been struggling to carry a movie and been a decent actor with his latest work. Beware of spoilers, the plot follows Henry (Brenton Thwaites) the son of Will Turner, who is emotionally driven to break his fathers curse. The only way to break the curse is to find the trident of Poseidon. After encountering Salazar (Javier Bardem), who wants him to find Jack Sparrow. So he can get his revenge after his confrontation with Sparrow left him and his crew cursed as a ghostly undead on the ocean. Meanwhile, Jack has been causing a stir up with a poorly executed bank robbery which he runs into Carina (Kaya Scodelario) who is an astronomer and believes in science that is causing everyone around her believing she is studying witchcraft. Henry enlisting the help of Carina to locate the trident and Jacks help to navigate the sea. As Salazar is on their trail with his ghostly ship crew that will stop at nothing that gets in their way. The positives about the fifth Pirates movie is I love the concept idea that Henry and Carina are both the focus point of the story this time. These characters are emotionally driven and are on the search for something. And Jack Sparrow is put on the comic relief sideline this time as he wrecks havoc wherever he goes. The film does have some fun big action set pieces from the opening with Jack being dragged along with the building in a bank robbery to ship battles and impressive climax that has these characters walking on the oceans floor. The visual effects were awesome. Javier Bardem was a fun addition as the villain, who is mostly cgi with his ghostly movement and face. Brenton Thwaites was better than expected. After his dull work on his last films like The Giver, God of Egypt, or The Signal. Kaya Scodelario was good playing an independent women that is driven by science and knowledge with astronomy. Like most Pirates films that is set up with fun big visual set pieces and Jack Sparrows clumsy humor. The humor with the character is no longer entertaining or funny. The character appeal is running into a dead mans tale. Johnny Depp performance is becoming dull. But if you enjoyed his humor in every Pirates movie, than this film is no different. Overall, Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Man Tell No Tales is a fair film with exciting visual action sequences, some fun new characters. But the plot is running its course and along with Jack Sparrows repetitive slapstick humor that does not bring anything new to the table. On the high note, there is a post credit scene that is worth checking out teasing for the next film.",6,1,4,30 May 2017
Back to the Future Part III," Western fun and Michael J. Fox delivers.
",(4 out of 5 stars).The third film is a lot of fun. Taking Marty to 1885 to bring Doc back. After the last movie left on a cliffhanger. Doc found a love interest. Marty meets someone that interests him. And than there are bandits bad guys who are after Marty. Plenty of fun and action. Does conclude the trilogy well. And an improvement over the last movie.,8,0,0,20 June 2020
Hidden Figures," Great performances on a story that needs to be heard on the behind the scenes of Nasa's space race.
","I am aware of how big the U.S and the Russians space race was. On who would be the first to head out to space and land in on the moon. Nasa was at a fast pace to get a space shuttle launched. One thing I felt like it was unheard, was the person that made this possible, mathematician Katherine (Taraji P. Henson). Gifted at an early age in elementary school and ahead of everyone in her class. The teachers recommended scholarships and plans for college. Many years later, Katherine, engineer Mary (Janelle Monae) and Mathematician and supervisor Dorothy (Octavia Spencer) all work together in a subdivision for computers in Langley. After the Russians launched their first satellite into space. The pressure for the Americans was high, when Nasa was in a hurry to get their first astronaut into space. Al (Kevin Cosnter) director on trying to get an space craft engineered, asks for Katherine to join his group on trying to solve these algorithm equations. Unwelcomed by many of his staff since she was an African American. Katherine faces the challenges of trying to solve a difficult equation and being mistreated by her coworkers. She is not allowed to get a cup of coffee from the same coffee pot or use the same bathroom. Making her run out of the building and to the colored bathroom in a different division building. Hidden Figures is a crowd pleasing drama film that shows the hardship these characters went through. Like a moment when Dorothy was not allowed to check out a book with her son in a library and has to go to the color section. Moments like seeing her son, wondering why they are treated that way. While her mother responds about only doing the right thing, and not letting anyone take an advantage. As she discusses about taking a book without permission from the library but she replies that she paid her taxes, so she has her rights like anyone else does. The film does convey a great story on what was going on behind the scenes with the space launch and showing the mathematician perspective on making this happen. Taraji P. Henson gave a great performance and will have to say is one of her better films. Octavia Spencer did great. Janelle Monae was also good, about how she is inspired to be an engineer. Kevin Costner was also good. The rest of the cast ensemble was great with their brief small roles. The one thing we can all predict from this, is we know what the outcome is. That's usually what falls with most based on true events biographical stories. I felt like the film dragged on at parts and could have been trimmed like 15 mins. Cause there were moments, were it did get kind of boring. Also, felt like the music score could have been more inspirational with the direction. Which is sad, cause music composer Hans Zimmer is brilliant in his other work. But being partnered with Benjamin Wallfisch, there score in the film did not add to the movie. On the bonus side, Pharrell Williams did have an okay song adapted for the movie. Overall, Hidden Figures is a fairly well drama film, I do recommend that you should watch. Just to see these characters that went through a lot, facing against racism and sexism. All while trying to work for Nasa and making the space launch successful. Plus the cast ensemble performances were all great.",7,1,4,12 May 2017
Coco," Beautiful, sad, and amazing to look at. Great for the whole family.
","Coco (4.5 out of 5 stars). Coco is such a beautiful emotionally sad story about a young boy Miguel who always dreamt about being a musician. When his family abandoned music in general after their great great grandfather was a famous musician and walked out on their life. He wants to pursue his dream of being a musician and accidently transports himself into the land of the dead. Where he has to seek his great great grandfather to return him back to living and to share the truth to his family about him. Pixar has made a comeback. They have been struggling with there sequels like Cars, and a boring The Good Dinosaur. Coco turned things for the better. It was a really good film. I am not sure if this one counts as a musical film as well. Since Miguel sings in a competition concert and a break out song. But the musical score was also beautifully done as well. The story and concept was great. It also explores the Mexican tradition of the day of the dead holiday. On why they celebrate it and there perspective on the living and the dead. Basically, families put out pictures of lost loved ones and their favorite foods and items by their pictures. And the spirit is able to come and visit the living if they are still remembered. Those who is slowly forgotten, they disappear from the land of the dead to another world. The film did a great job exploring the plot. And a boy's dream of being a musician while his family disapproved of and hoped he can join the family business of making shoes. The visual effects and animations is top notch beautiful. It is colorful, amazing, and eye candy to look at. When the land of the dead scenes are shown. Every skeleton design has decorations on them, or costumes, or the scenery of that world is just amusing. There was never a dull moment. The voice talent of Anthony Gonzalez did great as Miguel. Gael Garcia Bernal as Hector was good. Benjamin Bratt as Ernesto was good. The musical scene was great. A bit of a Spanish song with some English was great. It is also a tearjerker when you actually care for these characters. And has a theme that it focuses on about family and forgiveness. Only thing I thought it could have been better was Michael Giacchino music score. It was not as recognizable or memorable compare to his earlier work. Sadly, his music score in Good Dinosaur was more noticeable than this film. Overall, Coco is a really good film. Fun for the whole family. A plot and concept that explores the culture and tradition of the day of the dead which is really neat. The visuals and animation was beautiful and colorful. Voice talent was great. Lacking in memorable music score. But still a fantastic film.I recommend this film to all.",9,0,3,4 March 2018
1917," Impressive and raw with its sharp stunning direction.
","1917 (4 out of 5 stars).1917 is one of a king epic war film which puts you right with the characters Will (George MacKay) and Tom (Dean-Charles Chapman) as they travel through the battlefield. Director Sam Mendes is trying to achieve something with his direction, long camera shot continuation, and a wonderful music score by Thomas Newman. The film does well in capturing the realism and raw tone of war. The silence in walking through a mineshaft. The enemy firing at you and hearing the bullet ricocheting. Or an enemy charging at you. The audience is put right next to these soldiers as they cross enemy territory.The plot follows Will and Tom as they are assigned by their captain to cross no mans land and to warn the other battalion that they are about to fall into a trap from their enemy. It is a race against time that they will have to walk a far distance in less than a day. While watching out and avoiding their enemy.Director Sam Mendes does well in capturing a still camera shot. Mendes does not over do it like other action film directors with adding a lot of unnecessary action or explosions. He does capture the realism and raw tone of the movie. I like that he is trying to break the ground barrier with a one long continuation shot with the camera. Sure, there may be a scene cut somewhere. The editors did a great job in keeping the camera shots and direction very coherent without breaking away from a scene. It is kind of distracting. It works great with the movie. The opening scene following Will and Tom from their captain being told their assignment. To walking through the trenches around the soldiers. The cinematography by Roger Deakins did a great job in following these characters. And capturing the production set with torn down villages. Or a gritty aftermath of the battlefield with corpses on barb wires. It is just impressive. Lee Smith editing was well done in keeping the one long shot focused.The music score by Thomas Newman was beautifully done and haunting in a way. George MacKay and Dean-Charles Chapman were also good with their characters. We learn a little about them as they talk about their history as they walk through no mans land. Plus there are other actors in here with a small appearance like Mark Strong, Andrew Scott, Colin Firth, Claire Duburcq, Richard Madden, and Benedict Cumberbatch.My one issue with the film which I dislike about it is the pacing. It is nice to see a one shot sequence with the cinematography following the characters without cutting scene to another. Basically, you're with the characters every foot step they make. Which is cool and all but it does get a little slow when they walking a long way in a field or come to a complete pause.Overall, 1917 is a good war film done by Sam Mendes and his sharp beautiful direction. With a good music composer, editor, cinematography, and cast. It is one film that is worth seeing on the big screen.",8,0,1,16 January 2020
Resident Evil: Apocalypse," Non stop action, some similiar game adaptation moments, and pure entertainment.
",Resident Evil: Apocalypse (5 out of 5 stars).I will say i love the sequel. It lives up to the first movie. Its fast paced. Has plenty of action. And it has some similiar sequences that are like the games. Love the cast ensemble in it. Nemesis is great in it. May not be as scary as the games. Milla Jovovichs character is tough as always. She has enhanced abilities that makes her kick the undeads. There is a lot of exciting action. The story follows Alice and Jill trying to escape the city from the horde of undead and mutants. The cinematography. The script and direction is exciting and fast moving. Don't except any character development. The ending was a little weak compared to the first movie cause i was expecting it differently. If you keep a open mind as an enjoyable action flick. Than it does not disappoint.,10,3,4,6 April 2020
Star Wars: Episode VIII - The Last Jedi," The Last Jedi is most impressive!!! Rain Johnson takes big risk and turns out it can be a wild visually exciting ride!!!
","Star Wars: The Last Jedi does pack a wild science fiction punch being a strong emotional, visually exciting, and a great second film in the trilogy with the direction by Rian Johnson. Also, one of those films it is best knowing less and avoiding spoilers cause there are a couple of twist with the characters directions or reveals. I will try avoid giving away much details besides it was a spectacular film overall. The film kicks off right after the Force Awakens as ended, Rey (Daisy Ridley) meets Luke (Mark Hamill) in an island. Where she wants answers on were she fits in all this and needs Luke's help to aid in the resistance. Meanwhile, Poe (Oscar Isaac) and Leia (Carrie Fisher) are trying to escape the first order led Kylo (Adam Driver). Then, there is Finn (John Boyega) and Rose (Kelly Marie Tran) who are on a casino like planet looking for a decoder by the name of DJ (Benicio Del Toro). The plot was strong and emotionally moving with characters. A little hard to discuss without giving away anything. Besides there is a lot of unexpected directions characters turn around too. You may get good guys struggling with hope, bad guys that are also emotionally conflicted, and an climatic battle with characters dueling with lightsabers. Some aerial dog fights through space ships. And also a battle on a salty planet. There are also some twists that star wars fans may love or hate. I personally was expecting the direction to go a lot different. But I have no complaints with its new direction. I am excited to see were episode 9 will go. The set designs were cool. There is a lot of action from beginning to end. This film also feels like it's a big long chase with the rebels trying to escape from the first order through their space cruisers. There are some fun looking creatures like the porgs or the crystallized looking dogs. The aerial combats was plenty with the film and the visual effects are exciting and amazing. There was also a cool lightsaber duel which may leave the audience clapping. The script by Rian Johnson did give a good emotional story with a lot of things going on with the characters. Poe and Finn have a lot more to do in the story. And Rose being introduced and giving a more emotional connection with Finn. As they share there perspectives of this galactic war. And how running away from it will never make it go away. Out of all the star wars films. This is one of the better films. I still loved Revenge of the Sith, The Force Awakens, and Empire Strikes Back. The Last Jedi fits in right after Empire Strikes Back. Overall, The Last Jedi is a great Star Wars addition. It packs an emotional story, characters are at stake and have a lot going on in the film, the action and visual effects are great and plenty.I rate the film 5 out of 5 stars. I definitely recommend seeing the film in the big screen for its impressive exciting action, story, and the visuals.",10,2,21,18 December 2017
Guardians of the Galaxy," Fun, exciting, and a great cast ensemble.
","(4.5 out of 5 stars)Great cast ensemble. Fun characters. Plot is good. Diving deeper into mcu and out there in space. The visual effects are great. The film does deliver the action sequences and is action packed. There is a lot of fun humor that will keep you laughing and emotional. The soundtrack is awesome with the movie. James Gunn script and direction is fun, witty, and entertaining. I did find the villain Ronan to be a little underdeveloped and cliche.",9,1,1,7 May 2020
Mission: Impossible II," John Woo's direction can be a little ridiculous with its action but better than the first.
","Mission Impossible 2 (3.5 out of 5 stars).Mission Impossible 2 is a stylized explosive action film that brings a little freshness into the series. And an improvement over a dull first movie. Tom Cruise is back and better than ever. The film does pack a little punch with action which the first movie was lacking. The plot follows Ethan (Tom Cruise) being assigned to go after a rogue IMF agent Sean Ambrose (Dougray Scott). Who steals a chimera virus and plans on making profit with the cure. Ethan is going to need help from Sean's ex girlfriend Nyah (Thandie Newton) who is a skilled thief. The plot has a twist or two that will throw off the audience with surprises. Especially with the spy gadgets like facial mask to disguise themselves as somebody else. The action sequences can be ridiculous in this film. With John Woo's stylized direction. Kind of has a spaghetti western action scene with Woo having white doves flying between the hero and villain. And slo mo scenes with characters giving stare downs with flames between them. Also, cars explode easier in this movie when they barely crash into another. But I am sure all this is for summer entertainment at the movies. With a thrilling opening sequence with Ethan free rock climbing to Nyah and Ethan having a showdown in their sports cars racing on the side of the mountain. Then, there is another stunt with Ethan repelling down to a secured building which leads to a firefight. And another climatic showdown with a motorcycle chase and Ethan going face to face with Sean. Dougray Scott was good as the rogue agent. With a performance that looks like he has anger issues and is about to snap at any given moment. Thandie Newton was okay too that spies for Ethan. While Brendan Gleeson playing a character that works for a biocyte pharmaceutical company that created the virus. His character was dull and undeveloped. But good thing he was only in it for a small part of the film. Ving Rhames returns as Luthor, Ethan's sidekick and tech guy. The music score by Hans Zimmer does bring some energy to the film mixing the theme song with a fast paced rock score. Overall, Mission Impossible 2 is a pretty fair film. Better than the first movie. The action sequences are exciting and ridiculous. Have to keep in mind it is one of those blockbuster type of films. John Woo's direction can be a little cheesy with its style of white doves flying between characters or slo mo stare downs that try to build suspense. The plot is good which does slow down a little bit in the second act but picks back up with a wild bike chase and a fight sequence in the climax.",7,2,4,25 July 2018
Silence," Silence has its raw unease moments with Martin Scorsese's direction and also very slow moving.
","The latest Martin Scorsese historical drama film following the Jesuit priests traveling to Japan to find one of their own that went missing. Scorsese's film is well focused on story telling this historical story, also delivering some great performances from Andrew Garfield and Adam Driver. Silence may be short on being one of Martin Scorsese's better films like The Departed, The Wolf of Wall Street, etc. In the 17th Century, Father Rodrigues (Andrew Garfield) and Father Garupe (Adam Driver) are sent on a mission to look for a missing priest Ferrera (Liam Neeson). When he was last heard in Japan, where they are trying to renounce the Christianity faith and torture to those who would not give up their faith. Martin Scorsese is great at being a storyteller in his movie scripts and direction. I like the concept going over the 'hidden Christians' era when the conflict in Japan of the shogunate is trying persuade the village people in their country to renounce their Christian faith. With Father Rodrigues and Garupe visiting the village citizens and to see that they are still holding on to their Christian faith. Even as they have mass in hiding at night. When Rodrigues is feeling like he is being tested as he witnesses innocent people being tortured unless they renounce their beliefs. It is a powerful moving film. Rodrigues holding onto what he believes in, no matter the challenges that he is facing. The cinematography has its raw tone, and the music score kept to the minimum and with the outdoor noise of Japan being heard in the background from waves sound, a silent moment with crickets noise, etc. The set design was beautiful. Some unease feeling when seeing how people are being treated for what they believe in. Andrew Garfield did a great job with his performance and Adam Driver as well. The film is very slow moving with its storytelling. Does take a while for it to set up its story. Clocking in at a running time of two and half hours. The film can also be boring, seeing Rodrigues being taunted and he rejects the idea of giving up his faith which can go on for almost an hour. May not be one of Martin Scorsese's better movies. The acting and direction is the spotlight of this movie. While the rest falls in the slow moving story of a historical drama that hasn't been told before.Overall, Silence is a fair film, great performances, and strong direction. Its slow pace of two and half hours does feel like a very long time and some boring moments. I would rate Silence 3 out of 5 stars.",6,0,0,29 March 2017
Logan," Best Wolverine film yet!!!
","I was very much amazed with Logan, and for it to be the third Wolverine film. It felt completely different as a film with the character like the style, direction, and tone. Different in a good way, were James Mangold's direction was worth mentioning and how this character was so grim looking. The film given an R rated direction, makes it even gritty when it comes to its brutal bloody violence and a more profane Wolverine. Logan is an impressive film that could stand on its own if it wanted too. The script was perfect as it focuses on the characterization with a grim old alcoholic Wolverine and gritty intense fight sequences that can leave the audience cringing with the characters claws slicing through the bad guys. The plot takes place in 2026, Logan (Hugh Jackman) is a chauffeur for hire, driving his clients in a dystopian future. Trying to make enough money for him and Charles (Patrick Stewart) to live on their own and away from everyone. Until a lady asks Logan for help, knowing who he really is. And needs his help to drive Laura (Dafne Keen) from the borders of Mexico to North Dakota for safe haven. With a militarized unit known as the Reavers led by Donald (Boyd Holbrook) after them. Laura has a similar gift like Wolverine with the claws and a healing factor. The plot was well done, taking the story further out with the timeline, making Logan feeling isolated and alone. With the adamantium poisoning him as he ages, and it is finally catching up to him. The film has some gritty intense action sequences making Wolverine fights with the bad guys bloody. The film's midway reveal with the villain was also cool and puts an insane match to Wolverine without giving away spoilers. Hugh Jackman and Patrick Stewart delivered their best as their characters are older and a grimmer look. Dafne Keen did great as Laura, a quiet young girl that delivers expressions that you can actually feel for when she is afraid or angry. Logan does so well in concluding Wolverine's character arc, and even though it is sad to see this being the final movie to the character. It did it so well, that Logan ends in an emotional satisfying way. I still have trouble seeing how this movie is so different from the others. The others focused too much on having a lot of mutant characters and action and cgi. This film worked on delivering just on that one character, less cgi action. Grittier undertone action. Sometimes taking it way to seriously for a comic book character. Which makes this character different from the previous movies and the X-Men movies. Overall, Logan is a really good superhero film, making it the best in the series. With its dark gritty direction, a strong script that delivered on the old man Logan concept, powerful performances, intense action, and an emotional satisfying conclusion. I give Logan 4.5 out of 5.",9,2,7,6 March 2017
Hotel Mumbai," Suspenseful and intense thriller.
","Hotel Mumbai (3.5 out of 5 stars).Hotel Mumbai is a suspenseful thriller that adapts the true events of the Mumbai attack in 2008 and the people in the Taj Mahal Palace Hotel. It can be a very tough film to watch with the realistic shootouts. Especially, the film being a true story and there are many horrible shootouts and tragedy events that can make this film scary to watch. The film does a great job in having an intense and fast paced direction. Putting the audience at the edge of their seat throughout the movie.The plot follows the victims that went through the 2008 Mumbai attacks in India. When there was a group of young terrorists who were designated to several locations in India and following orders from some unknown guy who has been preaching their religious belief and delivering a message to the world by causing such a horrible tragedy event. Arjun (Dev Patel) is a young adult and a waiter at the restaurant in the hotel. David (Armie Hammer) and Zahra (Nazanin Boniadi) is a married couple who are visiting the country and staying at the hotel with their newborn baby. Vasili (Jason Isaac) is a high class VIP guest at the hotel. When the terrorists attack around the city. And several terrorists are on a shooting spree in the hotel. The survivors band together to avoid the attacks and trying to survive the night.I did feel like the plot is just the retelling of the events of 2008 Mumbai attacks with several characters trying to save their families and trying to escape. The characters being real life people. The script did feel a little uninspired to develop the characters in the film. You have a high-class couple David and Zahra. David feeling a little out of place with living the high class lifestyle. David will do whatever takes to make sure his family stays safe. Even with their nanny Sally (Tilda Cobham-Hervey). When an intense scene with the terrorists going room to room and she is trying to hide in the closet with the baby. And her trying to cover the baby's mouth to stop him from crying. It gets suspenseful and it does not stop from there.The film picks up the pace real quick. Seeing people and tourists in a restaurant. And their terrified reaction. When they see a grenade drop in the floor randomly. And the chaos that goes on from there. When the victims are stranded in the hotel with no support from the police and waiting for the Special Forces to help out.One thing I did have issues with the film. There are like six to nine terrorists in a big hotel. And plenty of people who are hiding. And avoiding them. A few strong victims who are capable of fighting back. But no one grabbed any kind of weapon to fight back.Overall, Hotel Mumbai is a pretty fair film. The direction is intense and suspenseful. The horrible tragedy is a tough one to see. The cast did great with what they can with their characters like Armie Hammer, Dev Patel, Nazanin Boniadi, Anupam Kher, Tilda Cobham-Hervey, and Jason Isaacs. The film may have some weak developed characters and poor choices with the actions on the characters. It is definitely worth checking out.",7,2,32,3 April 2019
The Dark Knight," An epic masterpiece of a superhero film which makes this one of the best.
","The Dark Knight (5 out of 5 stars).The Dark Knight is a great sequel to the follow up reboot of Batman. A lot happens in the film and making this one complex superhero film. Think of this film like a moving chess piece with the characters like Batman (Christian Bale), Gordon (Gary Oldman), and Harvey Dent (Aaron Eckhart) as they are all being affected by the Joker (Heath Ledger). Without giving much details and spoiler free. This is one spectacular superhero movie with a smart clever plot. Exciting action sequences, powerful acting, and an organized driven script that makes every scene in the movie important.The opening sequence of a robbery led by Joker was fantastic. Heath Ledger's performance is intimidating and scary. He is the character that has no remorse or empathy. And will kill anything in his path without blinking an eye. But his mastermind plan on taking Gotham is insane. Enough said about the plot. Which is best to find out for yourself when you see it. The action sequences are also great. The car chase with the tumbler is great. The film does get very dark fast when characters are horribly scarred or when characters die. There are sub plots that works great and are integrated with the main story later on. Harvey is trying to fight the corruption in Gotham. And putting away a lot of mobsters. Gordon is stuck in a conflict when he realizes there is more corruption in the city. Bruce is struggling with the concept that he can't be a hero forever and wants to settle with his love interest Rachel (Maggie Gyllenhaal). Now, knowing Harvey Dent is the white knight of Gotham. When the Joker is causing chaos in the city. Giving demands, orchestrating a bigger plot that will test everyone. The music score was great. Hans Zimmer music was fantastic. The script was great. Felt like a crime thriller concept mixed with a superhero movie. The direction was sharp and complex. With a lot of moving characters and story. The acting was great. Especially, Heath Ledger giving a great performance. The action is exciting and big.Overall, The Dark Knight is a great film. One of the best superhero movies yet. It can be dark. The Joker's threats and performance is intimidating. The acting was great. Christopher Nolan did great with his second Batman film.",10,0,0,20 August 2018
Midsommar," Shocking direction but slow moving.
","Midsommar (4 out of 5 stars).Midsommar is a folk horror film that leaves you feeling disturbed, unsettled, and speechless by the time the film ends. It is one of those cult films about a pagan cult in Sweden were they have rituals that are weird, awkward, and disturbing. The direction of the film is beautifully done by Ari Aster (Hereditary). If you seen Hereditary you may expect some of the same direction techniques. A slow building story, unsettling suspense and disturbing thoughts about what you are seeing. Ari Aster is two for two with his directing. The film delivers with the powerful performances by Florence Pugh and Jack Reynor. The music score delivers.The plot follows Dani (Florence Pugh) who is struggling with family matters about her estranged sister. While her boyfriend Christian (Jack Reynor) is tired of their relationship and wants out. Christian was planning a trip with his friends to Sweden to visit a commune festival. After a tragedy strikes Dani which Christian feels bad. He brings her along with his friends to this commune were it is like some kind of Pagan Cult.I can not give much details about the plot without entering spoiler territory. Besides there are some wtf moments and some cringy scenes that makes you feel unsettled. Plus there are some gory and graphic scenes that will make you shocked. The ending does leave you feeling a little speechless about what happens. Which makes you question on some characters motives and actions.The direction is really well done. The cinematography work is great capturing the beauty of the scenery and the haunting feeling of being isolated in this commune. The music score works well with the cult tone. The set designs with symbols and rituals these people are performing makes you question with their beliefs.I did not find the film at all scary or horrifying. Just disturbed with some characters fate revealed and the graphic nature of the sacrifice and rituals.Florence Pugh delivered with her performance. She delivered a lot of emotions with the character. With her feeling wrecked emotionally with her family issue and her boyfriend ignoring her. Jack Reynor was also good as well playing an arrogant kind of guy.The film is slow moving with its direction. Its two and a half hours long. The story is slow moving which may lose some audience. Definitely, one of those films that you will need patience for.Overall, Midsommar is a good film. It delivers shock and disturbing unsettling feel. The plot is a scary folk tale of a pagan cult. The performances are great. The script and direction is slow moving but it delivers the unsettling mood.",8,1,2,10 October 2019
Mission: Impossible," Slow and a dull direction but does set up for a franchise for Tom Cruise.
","Mission Impossible (3 out of 5 stars).Mission Impossible is a decent action spy film. Yes, it is a great start for a franchise based on a tv series. I did find this film to be quite boring and slow at times. The plot was all over the place and had a couple of twists that is not surprising. It had a couple of action sequences like an infiltration scene were Ethan Hunt (Tom Cruise) is dangling from the ceiling in a high security room. And the climatic bullet train scene were Tom Cruise is chasing the bad guy on top of the train. Which can be breathtaking. But otherwise, the film suffers from poor editing and pacing issues. The plot follows Ethan Hunt trying to find a mole in his team. After his team's mission was sabotaged and wiped out. He spends most of the movie in a safe room, looking at books, and trying to find traces of were the money that was setting him up. There is a couple of twists were good guys turned bad. Or bad guys turned good. It just suffered from poor pacing. There are a couple of action sequences. The climatic scene was the only exciting part of the movie. But it does take a long way to get there. Director Brian De Palma could have done the film a bit better. The characters were undeveloped. Jean Reno, Emmanuelle Beart, Henry Czerny, Ving Rhames, and Jon Voight could have all stuck out. But there characters were all flat. Tom Cruise was good playing the IMF agent. Overall, Mission Impossible is a fair film. It only had one exciting action sequence. The plot was dull and boring about them trying to find a mole in their agency and spend most of it in one room, the characters were forgettable, and Tom Cruise was the only good thing about the movie.",6,1,1,13 July 2018
The King," Great acting, story, and a direction that will put you on the edge of your seat.
","The King (3.5 out of 5 stars).The King is a pretty fair historical drama film about King Henry IV of England. About a story when Henry gives his distant son Hal (Timothy Chalamet) the role of being king after his passing. Hal was always a drunk and distant son which Henry preferred his other younger son. Hal trying to correct the conflict that his father has left behind. He receives an insulting message from France. And an assassin sent by the French King. Which Hal prepares for war with the French.The plot is entertaining and worth watching if you care for historical dramas. Especially the story and setting taking place in the 15th century. The script and direction may be a little too long or prolonged in the second act of the movie. Which made it slow and boring in some parts.The acting is great with the performances by Timothy Chalamet as Hal. Joel Edgerton playing Falstaff, Hal's best friend and advisor. Sean Harris playing William, Hal's advisor. Ben Mendelsohn as the ill King Henry. And Robert Pattinson playing the Dauphin, the French King's son. Pattinson's performance as a French prince with the accent was something different.The direction of the historical drama is worth watching. The story behind King Henry's son Hal and his rise to ruling England and making it a peaceful place was good. There will be some slow parts which the film could have used some editing some scenes to help with the pace.The battle sequence is decent. It was a bit confusing with the chaotic battle with both armies crowding in. Making the characters feel claustrophobic and buried underneath the bodies.Overall, The King is a pretty fair film. The plot is good. The performances are great. And the direction is decent. The film suffers from weak pacing and prolonged scenes but it delivered telling this epic tale of these characters.",7,2,4,3 November 2019
How to Train Your Dragon," Fun, beautiful animation, and a cute story.

Beauty and the Beast," Beautifully done for a live action remake.
","A beloved classic Disney film being remade into a live action does live up to the original movie with the lovable characters, same musical sequences, and some beautiful visual effects. Disney's has been doing so well into remaking their classics into live action like the previous films like The Jungle Book, Pete's Dragon, Cinderella, etc. Bill Condon direction follows the classic in every way that fans would love. The rest comes down to criticizing the cast talent meeting the characters expectations, the visual effects on Beasts and the characters like Lumiere, Cogsworth, etc. I really liked the live action follow up and loved how every moment being reenacted. Also, feel like they explore more in depth with the Beast and Belle's past about losing there loved ones. The plot is amazing and beautiful being the same exact thing about the original. The Prince (Dan Stevens) and his staff are cursed in the castle after his actions of rejecting a beggar woman who crashes his party. She curses the Prince turning him into a beast and his castle staff into furniture. Then, it follows Belle (Emma Watson) who feels like an outcast in her village for being obsessed with reading. And captures the attention of a narcissistic Gaston (Luke Evans) who is determined to marry her. When Belle's father goes missing in a snowy dark castle. She learns that her father has been imprisoned by the beast and takes her fathers place. The castle bouteiller Lumiere (Ewan McGregor) that is cursed into a candelabra and Cogsworth (Ian McKellen) who is a clock tries to convince the Beast to try to charm Belle and maybe she can be the one to fall in love with him, in order to break the curse. The film does have beautiful musical sequences. Emma Watson as Belle was a perfect choice, being a beautiful talented actress and portraying the character really well. Hard to imagine any one else doing the role. Dan Stevens was also great, with a performance that was delivering a menacing voice as the beast at first, and a prince. Luke Evans and Josh Gad were matched up well as Gaston and Lefou. Turning the animated characters in the original to a live action version worked for the most part. I still fell in love with the animated Cogsworth and Lumiere and found them to be funny and entertaining. In the live action, the two being brought to a visually realistic candelabra and antique clock was stunning but had less quirky humor and cute characteristics the original had. Not sure if it was the voice cast Ewan McGregor or Ian McKellen which they are very talented actors. Or the way the characters were written. The ball dance sequence was stunning and had that magical beautiful visuals look. The film does have plenty of gorgeous sets, visual effects, musical sequences, and a great cast ensemble.Overall, Beauty and the Beast is a good fantasy film that lives up to the original and fans will love. I will give the film 4 out of 5 stars.",8,4,14,17 March 2017
Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2," Guardians is back and has plenty of visuals and action. A great second chapter in GotG.
","Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2 is back and flashy as ever when it comes to its visual style of action, soundtrack, a fun cast, and the laughable humor. Usually sequels can be a let down after its predecessor set the standards high. And the build up momentum for the sequels is easily forgotten. Writer/Director James Gunn manages to continue what worked on the first movie and expand further with the characters he brought together. Yes, it is a ragtag of misfits that try to be a team and argue to each other with their own personal issues. In the end, they see each other not as friends but family. The plot follows Peter (Chris Pratt), Gamora (Zoe Saldana), Drax (Dave Bautista), Rocket (voiced by Bradley Cooper), and Baby Groot (voiced by Vin Diesel) are tasked at fighting away a giant monster and protecting valuable batteries. Ayesha (Elizabeth Debicki) the leader of the sovereign race, who needed the guardians help for the task. After a dispute, leaving the guardians on the run away from Ayesha and her army of drones chasing them away. The guardians crash on a planet, where they come across Ego (Kurt Russell) who is Peter's father. Ego takes Peter, Gamora, and Drax to his planet. Meanwhile, Rocket, Groot, and Nebula (Karen Gillan) stay behind their wrecked ship, only to come across the Ravagers led by Yondu (Michael Rooker). Trying to claim the bounty on the guardians that is set by Ayesha. Guardians of the Galaxy 2 has everything you can expect. It has plenty of action and the visual effects were colorful, and impressive. When Peter and his team visit Ego's planet. The visual effects were astonishing. The set pieces were great too. It does have its fun share of humor. It is fun to see a dysfunctional team trying to get along; you have Peter and Rocket with their arrogant cocky self. Nebula and Gamora personal conflict that keeps them fighting each other. The one thing that always drives Peter and his team is how they see each other as family. Also, there is baby groot which is always a scene stealer. Groot is small and cute, even from the opening moment of him dancing and needing music playing as the guardians are fighting against a giant monster. The villains are usually what worry me, as several Marvel movies later. They all have that same motive and have that clichÃ© routine. I was worried for a second in this film about who and what the villain was. Without giving away spoilers or details. This film villain is by far better compared to the first movie. Definitely, the villain does not show until later. It definitely leads the direction into a big climax with the guardians trying to save the galaxy yet again. The guardians are tested personally as Peter, Gamora, and Drax are separated from Groot and Rocket being with Yondu. Gunn never lets a single moment become dull. There are easter eggs, celebrity cameos, etc. Also, there are five mid/post credit scenes that are worth checking out unlike the first movie end scene of Howard the Duck that was a waste. Overall, Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2 is a visually exciting sequel that surpasses the original. It has a fun cast and characters, the soundtrack is awesome, the visual effects and action is exciting, the villain is an interesting one, and James Gunn's fun direction makes it a flashy fun movie.",10,43,78,6 May 2017
Thor," Colorful, fun, and action packed

The Shape of Water," A flawless story but slow and boring at times.
","The Shape of Water shows Guillermo del Toro visionary direction of a tale that is a love story with a bit of fantasy. The film does well with its storytelling, interesting characters, the concept of a creature that looks like it came out of Creature from the Black Lagoon falling for a mute girl. Guillermo del Toro script does well with its storytelling. A girl falling in love with a sea creature. Elisa (Sally Hawkins) is a mute girl that works at a factory that is mostly kept secret with the experiments done within the facility. Elisa goes day by day, waking up and being lonely, she even has a set timer for her self fun time, and she works and after spending time with her lonely neighbor Giles (Richard Jenkins). Giles is obsessed with key lime pies that he keeps in his fridge, which is a lot of pies that he saves for later. And also has an apartment filled with cats. Then, Elisa notices Richard (Michael Shannon) and his secret government project he needs to hide in their facility which is a humanoid sea creature. Elisa becomes friends with the creature by feeding it eggs during her lunch breaks and notices the creature is not the threat they all assume. Richard trying to figure out what it is before the soviets try to steal their specimen away. Elisa helps breaks the creature free and falls for the creature. What I like about the film is it does have a visionary tale. And del Toro always does it best. Every character is distinct and different. Sally Hawkins is a mute girl and sweet and charming with her performance. You can't help but to love her performance. Michael Shannon is addicted to painkillers and racist and becomes very nasty as the villain. A colonel that wants to get the job done by any means necessary. Richard Jenkins was good as a crazy cat man and obsessed with his key lime pie that tries to be friends with the waiter at a diner. Octavia Spencer is good as Elisa's friend. And Doug Jones as the amphibian man, if it was visual effects or practical make up work. It was well done. The concept was neat as it plays in the 1960s. The time were the soviets was on the trail of trying to steal the americans amphibian creature. And also the fear of spies within the facility. What I did not like about the film is the plot is slow moving. Which can be boring at times. Seeing Elisa go through her day-to-day routines can be repetitive and boring. Also, there is one weird musical scene that just took the tone and direction away from the movie. When Elisa and the Amphibian are on the dining room and she burst into an imaginary musical sequence was cheesy and weird. Overall, The Shape of Water was a fair fantasy drama film.",6,2,6,3 January 2018
The Matrix Reloaded," Big, epic, and awesome.
",The Matrix Reloaded (5 out of 5 stars)The Matrix Reloaded is awesome. It delivers as a sequel. With the plot being epic of people from zion are counting down to a machine war for humanitys survival. The movie is action packed. And awesome. It has a few awesome action sequences with Neo fighting a lot of Agent Smiths. Or an awesome fight scene in a mansion. Or a long car chase that is breathtaking and intense. The film does have some cheesy cgi and visual effects. Still good. The cast ensemble is great.The direction and script is great. The film does end in a cliffhanger for a third movie.,10,2,2,12 April 2020
The Disaster Artist," Hilarious and the funniest film I have seen all year
","The Disaster Artist is about a movie that is so terribly bad that it's funny. Not sure if many have heard about Tommy Wiseau's film The Room. A movie that did not made much sense nor did it have any coherent scenes together. James Franco decided to direct a comedy film based on a novel about Tommy Wiseau's experiences and the behind the scenes with the film. The Disaster Artist is hilarious; it was always entertaining with the performances from James Franco, and Dave Franco. In 1998 an inspired actor Greg (Dave Franco) meets a guy Tommy (James Franco) in his acting class. Both hoping to achieve the Hollywood dream and become movie stars someday. They both made a pact that they will always push each other no matter how difficult it is to become a star. They move to Los Angeles, were they both get denied by many acting agencies. Tommy decides to write, direct, and star in his own movie The Room. Where many film crew questions the purpose of the story, the techniques Tommy is trying to convey, and the mystery behind who is Tommy and where is he from, where does he get all his money when he starts spending millions on the movie. The plot was fun seeing Greg and Tommy form their friendship. Tommy telling Greg to break out into character at a restaurant. Seeing the awkwardness that Tommy is and his weirdness behavior on directing his own movie was always entertaining. I ll also have to say The Disaster Artist probably is the funniest film I have seen all year. There was a lot of stupid fun humor and it does have its charm in its own way. I am sure The Room film is amusing, may not be the highest quality of a movie but its bad enough to become its own cult classic. Tommy Wiseau may have his own fanbase for it. James Franco is hilarious as Tommy. Dave Franco is good as well. There are so many surprising actors that make an appearance like Zac Efron, Josh Hutcherson, and Alison Brie. Overall, The Disaster Artist is a good comedy film. The plot is fun about the true story of Tommy Wiseau and Greg making a film together. The humor is stupid and hilarious throughout. The cast was great and James Franco is awesome with the role. I rate the film 4 out of 5 stars. I recommend seeing the film in theatres or rental, if you care for stupid comedy movies which may have its random jokes every now and then (kind of like Napolean Dynamite). Then, I definitely recommend seeing it.",8,6,15,8 December 2017
American Made," American Made is quick, entertaining, and Tom Cruise is back again!!!
","American Made is fun, fast paced, and Tom Cruise is playing a character that is different from what he usually does. From the director Doug Liman, who also did Edge of Tomorrow with Tom Cruise and showed they can have fun with that. Well same goes for American Made, were it follows Barry Seal (Tom Cruise) a bored airline pilot, who causes some shakiness with the plane to wake some of his passengers for some laughs. He is approached by Schafer (Domhall Gleeson), who wants to recruit Barry to work for the CIA in flying over South America in a plane to snap pictures. Evantually, Barry gets caught up with the Medellin Cartel, who recruits Barry to fly cocaine back to the U.S. With Schafer being blind sided with the drug smuggling. Barry is making plenty of money that he can barely keep hold of such as having it all put away in a room filled shed or even having it buried in his back yard. Soon enough, the CIA convinces Barry to run guns to the Contras. While the operation may be expanding with Barry having his own airport runaway in a small town of Mena, Arkansas. While the FBI, DEA, and TFA are hot on Barry's trail. The film is very fast moving. It does goes by briefly on Barry's life events. A moment of him being an airline pilot and bored with his life. Then, it flashes to him being recruited by Schafer. And starting a family with his wife. This is the type of movie that could have last longer if it had development to the characters. But director Doug Liman kept the pace rolling, and had everything moving at a brisk pace. It is also quite fun to see Barry Allen handling some difficult situations being placed in hostile countries. From working with the cartel to smuggling drugs over. He is a skilled pilot. That flies low to wait out the DEA planes that are following him to waste fuel. To even taking off on short runaways. The scenes with seeing him expanding on his operation in bringing in more money than Mena is worth in the town is fun and entertaining. Tom Cruise is an underrated actor. Sure, he is great in his action movies like Mission Impossible, etc. Seeing him playing a character that is vulnerable and not a skilled fighter is fun to see. He can portray the character very well. American Made may not be a typical Tom Cruise action movie. But more of fun suspenseful thrills of seeing Barry working his way to the top as a delivery man pilot. It never slows down or gets boring. There are some funny moments with the character. The things that did not work with the movie. I ll have to say it is the development. There is none with the movie. If there was, it was shadowed by the quick moving pace. The movie goes over the several years quickly. A moment were Barry and his wife are living in a fixer upper safe house and a minute later, Barry and his wife have plenty of money and a remodeled home, living in luxury. Another thing is the cinematography must have been hand-held. There was a lot of close ups with the characters faces. And a lot of shakiness for small dramatic scenes which felt unnecessary. Sure, the technique is done to bring some kind of realism or build the suspense. But it felt overdone in the film. Sure as well it wont be recognized for great cinematography work. Overall, American Made is a fairly well crime thriller about Barry Seal and what he has done from being a bored pilot to working for the CIA, DEA, and the cartel. The direction is fast paced, fun, and entertaining. Tom Cruise was great. It may not a memorable film for a forgettable plot from the lack of development. Or its poor camera work with the film. But it was fun. I rate the film 3.5 out of 5 stars.",7,2,5,29 September 2017
Joker," Impressive performances, dark tone, and eerie feel of the character.
","Joker (4 out of 5 stars).Joker is a psychological thriller film that Writer/Director Todd Phillips brings his own direction of the origin story of Batman's ultimate villain character. Joker is not the typical antihero superhero movie that most people would try to expect from. It is more of a character study of a character Arthur Fleck going insane and becoming a mad man when he realizes society has fallen in his eyes. Joker is a gritty, dark, and a surprisingly thrilling film. Definitely, one of those movies you will like it or hate it. This one does leave that haunting, spine chilling taste once it is over.The plot follows Arthur (Joaquin Phoenix) who sees human services for help regularly. He tries to take care of his mother Penny (Frances Conroy). He is attracted to his neighbor Sophie (Zazie Beetz). And he works being a clown and holding signs up. When human services are cut for budgeting. And his mother needs help medically. He sees that the people living in the low class area are struggling and forgettable towards the eyes of the rich. He slowly loses his mind and becomes the psychopath Joker.Joaquin Phoenix performance is off the charts impressive. Every single scene with Phoenix is great. He is impressive from the creepily body movements, his physique being underweight, and laughter is creepy. I feel like he is trying for the awards season. I can not compare him to other actors that have portrayed the roles. Heath Ledger will always be the best. Cause this is a different adaptation of Joker. This is more focused on a man who is slowly breaking away.The music score by Hildur Guonadottir is great. The music score delivers a spine chilling tone. It works with the atmosphere of the movie. The movie does deliver a good haunting origin story of Arthur becoming the mad man. Showing how wearing a clown disguise has an influence on others. And how others protest for the way society is treating them. Almost kind of scary that can be believable with the way things are in the real world with violence.However, I did find the direction with Joker to be kind of dull. It was great with performances, the origin story of Joker, and the music score. It is not one of those movies that is rewatchable after that one time. Do not expect any big action sequences, heroes fighting against the villain. This standalone movie is a grounded origin story. The movie does have some gritty and violent killings which may put some people at unease. I did love some references with characters which I will not give away cause of spoilers.Overall, Joker is a good psychological thriller film. Joaquin Phoenix is great with the role. The music score is good. Joker is one of those movies that leaves you with a disturbed taste from the character study. The movie will not be for everyone with its smaller budget and slow direction.",8,2,5,5 October 2019
It Chapter Two," It delivers scares, thrills, and is epic for a horror film.
","It Chapter 2 (5 out of 5 stars).It Chapter 2 is awesome, insane, and it delivers for a supernatural horror film. I loved the first movie with a terrifying Pennywise stalking Derry and a group of kids trying to stop it. The plot follows 27 years later, Bill (James McAvoy), Beverly (Jessica Chastain), and the rest of the Losers club return to Derry to stop It once and for all.The film opens with a haunting beginning about a young guy getting attacked and stalked by Pennywise. The rest of the film builds up the characters with the Loser club being adults. Bill is a famous writer for Hollywood and writes books with terrible endings. Beverly leaves an abusive relationship. Richie is a comedian. Ben works for a corporate company. Eddie is still a neat and health freak. Stanley is living a normal married life. And Mike still lives in Derry while investigating the current disappearances. Their own worst fears comes back to haunt them when they reach Derry. One by one they face this mysterious clown. While trying to save other children from being lured by the clown.The film is a little bigger than the last movie. It is longer and a lot more happens with the plot. The origins of It and how they are supposed to stop it. Some past bullies comes back to haunt the Losers club. I am not sure how faithful this film is to the novel. But it is nearly similar to the original movie/series with Tim Curry. The film has plenty of thrills and scares to make this film one of the best horror films of this year. The cast ensemble is perfect. James McAvoy, Jessica Chastain, Bill Hader, Isaiah Mustafa, Jay Ryan, James Ransone, and Bill Skarsgard is back as Pennywise. They all were great with their characters. The film brings back the original children actors back as it explored more of the events of that summer when they first encountered It. Those kids personality and the adults were a perfect combo.There is also one suspenseful scene with Bill going into a haunted walk through house ride at a fair. Trying to save a kid with mirror maze hallway. Which is thrilling. The climax of the movie is epic. There fight against Pennywise is insane. Characters are separated and faced with their own fears. The ending is satisfying with a conclusion to the characters and the story itself.Overall, It Chapter 2 is a great film. Even though it was 2 hours and 48 minutes long. The story is well spread out to develop the characters and their encounter with Pennywise. The cast is perfect. The direction delivered enough scares and thrills to make this film a great horror film.",10,16,29,7 September 2019
12 Strong," 12 brave soldiers riding into battle delivers on the action but lacks in character depth.
","12 Strong shows the highlight of the 12 American soldiers battling against the Taliban soldiers after the 9/11 attacks. 12 Strong could have been a really good war film. It may have its problems with a lack of characterization in the script and a repetitive concept with the action. But the cast ensemble and the action sequences are well worth the admission. The plot follows after the 9/11 attacks. CIA paramilitary soldiers Cpt. Mitch (Chris Hemsworth) was in a hurry to go back into service after seeing the terror attacks in the news. Mitch enlist he brings his team together Sam (Michael Pena) and Spencer (Michael Shannon). Their mission in Afghanistan is to join forces with the alliance Abdul Dostum (Navid Negahban) and his army to help eliminate the Taliban forces. What I liked about 12 Strong is it does deliver on the action and explosions. May not be the best war film like Saving Private Ryan, Dunkirk, 13 Hours, ect. Seeing the brave men of Mitch and his paramilitary team form a bond with the alliance. After the 9/11 attack. His team motives of going back into service was to go kill some terrorists, no questions ask. They had trouble seeing eye to eye with the alliance. But there bond, that they will stand by the americans side to fight for there country against the Taliban. Like a saying of my enemy of my enemy is my friend or something like that. The film has a few small action sequences were Mitch calls an airstrike to eliminate the Taliban camp site with a little bit of a shoot out. Then, the climax does deliver it all with lots of explosions, intense shoot outs, and an army on horse back riding out into battle. Chris Hemsworth did great. Michael Shannon was also good. Michael Pena did well. And even Navid Negahban was also good. What I did not like about the film. I feel like the script was lacking in character depth and the plot was repetitive with the teams mission in Afghanistan. Sure, we learn a little bit about the three main characters. Chris Hemsworth has a family. His wife knows what she is in for. He is a true American patriot, when an attack on American soil happens. He will go overseas to help fight back in battle. Michael Shannon is also a family with a wife that is tired of seeing him go. And Michael Pena's character who has a wife that is also sad and tired of seeing her husband leave. When these characters are in battle there is no emotions to feel for these characters. The script literally lacks in depth that it is difficult to care for these brave soldiers when we really should feel for them. Plus when they are in battle it does feel like the life/death stakes is down to the minimum when everything is taken care of easily. It is always an easy solution of airstrikes. When these guys are hands down fighting, they are easily taken care of from fighting back or avoiding explosions and gun fire. I feel like these characters lives are not really threatened at all. Sure, the direction also lacked in building the suspense and putting you on the edge of your seat to caring for these characters. Also, the plot was repetitive with the team discovering the Taliban and calling an airstrike. Then it's done. It happens a couple of more times. And every break in between these character chat about their views of this war. And it is also were it missed the opportunity to have development for the characters. And than the final battle when 12 american soldiers are battling on horseback and getting last minute help from the alliance. Sure, these soldiers ride into battle like if it was nothing and they were invincible in avoiding gun fire and explosions. Overall, 12 Strong is a pretty fair war film. It has some great action battle sequences that will keep you entertained. Chris Hemsworth and the cast were a great choice. The film does lack in character development in the script and the direction was repetitive with the plot. I rate the film 3.5 out of 5 stars. I recommend in seeing the film in theatres for the action. May not be the best war film but still worth seeing.",7,2,11,20 January 2018
Kong: Skull Island," Kong is big, loaded with action and visuals.
","Kong: Skull Island is an awesome monster film that fits right in there in the whole MonsterVerse that the movie studio is trying to build up on. Like the 2014 Godzilla film was trying to do. Kong film is fast paced; plenty of action visual sequences, and does have some stunning direction with its Vietnam/1970s style. Kong: Skull Island is more into the whole big fun blockbuster style type of film compared to 2005's Peter Jackson's King Kong that paid homage to the original and had development with characters and story. Even Kong in the 2005 film had more of a personality and emotions than this film. Does not make this film terrible or anything, which this one had more of an action packed adventure and Kong being bigger and viewed as a King of the island. The plot follows Bill Randa (John Goodman) and seismologist Houston (Corey Hawkins) hiring Former Special Ops James (Tom Hiddleston) to be their tracker for their expedition to Skull Island. Hoping to discover an ecosystem of species that has yet to be discovered. Teamed up with a military unit led by Preston (Samuel L. Jackson). They discover that man is not on the top link on the planet when they come across Kong. Realizing that there are other beasts and Two legged lizard monsters known as Skullcrawlers. What I really loved about Kong: Skull Island is it was well paced compared to the 2005 film. You did not have to wait 40 or so minutes to see Kong. The film had a little faster set up. Bill Randa proposing his plan to the government and than recruiting a team for his expedition to a tracker James, Military unit, and even a photographer Mason (Brie Larson). Next thing you know, a thrilling sequence with several helicopters arriving on the island and running into Kong. It goes from there with people trying to survive the dangers of the island from flying prehistorically birds, a mountain sized Kong, and Skullcrawlers. Kong's battle with a giant octopus was stunning. Even the climatic battle with the skullcrawlers was pretty awesome. The visual effects were spectacular. It could also be quite overwhelming seeing some cheesy noticeable effects with the choppers formation and being attacked by Kong. This is a fun sized blockbuster film, which goes all out with a lot of action, visuals, and keeping up with the pace. Cinematographer Larry Fong had entertaining set ups with the camera work. There may be a first person moment as a character is firing a weapon at a giant ant, or using a sword on a flying monster. Director Jordan Vogt-Roberts had a fun style, having a 1970s soundtrack, a Vietnam tone. Or having spectacular scene set up with Kong rising in front of a sunset. There are plenty of those sequences set-ups. One slight issue I had with Kong: Skull Island is I was really hoping for a longer battle with Kong fighting against a giant Skullcrawler. The climax was exciting and big and awesome as it is. I felt like it was short in a way, which I wanted to see more of. Otherwise, Kong: Skull Island is a really good monster film with plenty of action, awesome set pieces, and a great cast ensemble. Also there is a scene after the credits that set up for a special surprise. I would rate Kong: Skull Island 4.5 out of 5.",9,24,47,10 March 2017
Murder on the Orient Express," A great large cast that worked with the characters. The mystery film is slow and boring that makes hard for it to improve throughout.
","Watching Murder on the Orient Express is like playing a game of clue. Trying to solve the murder mystery with several suspects that may or may not have a motive. However, the film is less fun than playing. Murder on the Orient Express draws some great performances. Especially, the best detective in the world Hercule Poirot (Kenneth Branagh). Who is great at solving mystery crimes from the tiniest details that every one would miss. He happens to be on the same express train with several other people that played by an ensemble of talented actors like Penelope Cruz, Willem Dafoe, Judi Dench, Johnny Depp, Josh Gad, Derek Jacobi, Leslie Odom Jr., Michelle Pfeiffer, and Daisy Ridley. When there is a murderer at large, Poirot will have to follow every single clues and theories to who is the suspect. And how every one in train compartment has a connection of some kind? The direction, tone, and set are fun and visually impressive to look at. With the train being stuck on the snowy mountains and blocked by an avalanche. The performances were also great. Kenneth Branagh did great as the character and tried making it a lot of fun to see him on screen with his compulsiveness and awkward personality. Sure, they can continue with multiple films with the character in different mystery stories. The few problems I have the film is. It can be very slow in the middle of the second act. So slow, it can be boring at times and you can easily lose interest on were the story is going next. It has its uneven pacing that could have had better editing and maybe trim down a few overlong scenes. Also, the climax with the mystery and twist revealing itself and playing back a few scenes to recap on how everything was done didn't feel like much of a surprise. It just did not have the exciting build up to even care for what was going on. Overall, Murder on the Orient Express is a fair mystery drama film. A great cast ensemble. A spot on direction and tone for its mystery feel. It was a little longer than it should have been and the slow pacing did not help build the excitement at all.I rate the film 3 out of 5 stars.",6,0,2,22 November 2017
Wonder Woman," Wonder Woman is awesome and an exciting origin story and hopefully a better turn for its direction with DC.
","Wonder Woman being brought to the big screen after being a big icon as a character from an old TV show or animated movies. This being DC fourth movie in their extended universe after last years BvS and Suicide Squad. Wonder Woman is lighter in tone but at the same time growing more as a inspirational character. The movie is awesome, it does well with its plot, has a developed script, acting was fun and good. The action and visual effects were great. May have a scene of cheesy cgi, but it is easily forgiven for trying. Director Patty Jenkins did great adapting a superhero film, maybe she will be the DC version of how Sam Raimi was with his Spider-Man movies good except for the overwhelming third movie.The plot follows Diana, a girl at heart, raised on an island of Themyscira. Land of the Amazonians and led by her queen mother Hippolyta (Connie Nielsen). Her mother does not wish for her to learn about fighting. Diana's desire to train to become a fighter, and trained by Antiope (Robin Wright). As years go by, Diana rescues an Air force pilot Steve Trevor (Chris Pine) after crashing near the island, escaping from the Germans in the midst of World War 1. Diana learns from him about the war, and is willing to help defend the world. Her believing that Ares, the god of war is behind this conflict. She goes with Steve to civilization in London to accompany him on being part of this war. All while, Ludendorff (Danny Huston) and Dr. Poison (Elena Anaya) are planning an ultimate attack with their secret hidden weapon.Wonder Woman was a perfect origin story, we see her as a child. She is curious about the world and where she came from. Which we learn very little about. She grows and wants to be part of this world in defending people. Her character is vulnerable, believing everyone is good. Until, she sees battle and people fighting each other.The action and visual effects were exciting and awesome. The battle sequence with Wonder Woman running through no mans land with mortars blasting on her side. Reflecting bullets off her shield and body armor. Her character has this stylized fighting either using her sword or Lasso. Or even punching guys through buildings. The film may have less action than the last three DC movies, but this film was more grounded to building this character emotionally. When it comes to the action sequences and the climax, it does not disappoint. Even with her fight with the villain, which explodes with spectacular visual effects.Gal Gadot is amazing as Wonder Woman, she is beautiful and a great choice as the character. Chris Pine did great as Steve. Robin Wright, David Thewlis, and Connie Nielsen were perfect. Danny Huston and Elena Anaya were menacing.The film does have some fun with Diana going to London and how she interacts with this whole new world. The way she feels about dresses or how people act and think. Patty Jenkens tries to have a little fun with that by adding some humor. The main theme song that was done in BvS is also back in the movie which is pretty cool. Overall, Wonder Woman is a great superhero film with awesome action, great story and direction. I definitely recommend the film, you will not be disappointed like the other DC films. Cant wait to see the character return in Justice League.",10,10,25,3 June 2017

Black Panther," Its too overhyped as a MCU movie. But still a great exciting adventure for the Black Panther character.
","Black Panther was awesome and the triumphant king of Wakanda. First thing first, I enjoy and loved the film as it stands out on its own. Plus the world building of MCU, now were introduced to the world of Wakanda, were technology is advanced by a few decades than everywhere else around the world. But it is also kept a secret except for the people from Wakanda. It was beautiful visually; it had some good action sequences, and an inspirational plot. I will throw this out there, I feel like the movie is overhyped. It was a great movie. But when you put this up with other Marvel films. There are other great ones and better superhero movies than this. The pros about this film. Lets start with the plot. It does not feel like a Marvel movie at all. It is a good thing. It starts after the events of Captain America Civil War. T'Challa (Chadwick Boseman) heads back to Wakanda. He is declared King. When he sees that Ulysses Klaue (Andy Serkis) shows up on the radar selling vibranium that only belongs to Wakanda. And the rest of the world is not ready for this technology. T'Challa chases Klaue down and discover a mercenary Erik Killmonger (Michael B. Jordan) may be his biggest challenge yet. When Killmonger wants to take over Wakanda. Plot is inspirational, about a king that does not think he is ready. But is faced with an ultimate challenge politically when he wants to do what is right for his kingdom and the rest of the world. The action sequences were good. May not be an action packed wild ride compared to other marvel movies. I ll be honest about the opening action scene was terribly lighted and dark and filled with close up camera shots and quick editing. When Black Panther attacks a convoy to rescue one of the hostages. But it gets better throughout. It has a few good action scenes. From the casino when T'Challa and Okoye (Danai Gurira) fight through some bad guys. To a car chase scene with Black Panther. And than a climatic battle Killmonger's followers and a fight between him and Panther on a futuristic railway. Director Ryan Coogler could have made some action scenes fun. When offered a 200 million budget. He really tried to be careful to not over do it. But he could have tried for a blockbuster approach. The visual effects were great. The music score stands out on its own as a MCU film with an electronic chant music. Chadwick Boseman was great as Panther/T'Challa. Michael B. Jordan was also good. And stands out as a villain. When his motivation is slowly revealed after a tragic past that made him what he is today. Lupita Nyong as Nakia was great as T'Challa's love interest and wants to do something about the real world's conflict outside Wakanda. Danai Gurira has a lot more screen time and is good too. Same with Martin Freeman, who has more to do than his brief appearance in Captain America. And Letitia Wright as Shuri was great as T'Challa's sister and is the brains in offering new technology and gadgets. Overall, Black Panther is a great film. I loved it. It is visually entertaining. The action was not top notch but it was good. The plot was great, it was a little too much in the political side than being a personal character story, and the huge cast ensemble was good. If the movie were standing alone as a superhero it would have been the best movie. But being part of the MCU, there are other great movies better than this. I feel like this film was lacking in the fun energy than the last several MCU films had. I still recommend seeing this film in theatres for its exciting action, an indifferent plot, and also there is two post credit scenes, I think the final end scene was a nice nod to a character. I rate the film 5 out of 5 stars.",10,23,79,16 February 2018
Iron Man," Iron Man is pure entertainment, energetic, and pumped up action.
","Iron Man (4 out of 5 stars).Iron Man is an energetic, super fun, and a smart superhero film that plays it safe. Robert Downey, Jr. is great playing the heroic character. It is difficult to see anyone else taking on the role. He delivers with an arrogant, cocky, and a charm that begins with you hating his character to loving it. The script worked great on the character development as he changes his views through the movie. The plot was good it could have been better. But it works. Tony Stark is an arms dealer, selling to the military. Only to discover his weapons are going in the wrong hands. The first act of the movie is Tony being stuck in a cave, trying to build an armored suit for his escape. The second act is consist of Tony making improvements on his iron suit and realizing his company's weapons are being used by the enemy. Jeff Bridges was good too, playing the villain. The film is a lot of fun. It has high energy and fast paced. It just does not slow down. Plus the direction of the film plays like a rock star with this kind of super hero. With a rock music score by Ramin Djawadi that gets you pumped up. Or the opening sequence with AC/DC playing. The film does have a lot of fun moments that makes you love Tony Stark and his charm as the character. The action sequences are also good. The visual effects are great. The climatic battle with Iron Man and the villain was good but does feel a little short for the climax. Overall, Iron Man is a good superhero film that is worth checking out. May not be a masterpiece like The Dark Knight. But it is a great start and a lot of fun.",8,0,0,29 August 2018
Mother!," Mother! Creepy and weird direction and a plot that is difficult to say what its about with a hidden message in it.
","Mother! Is by far the strangest psychological horror film to date. It is not for everyone and everyone will either have a like it or hate it reaction to the film. Screenwriter/Director Darren Aronofsky take on the film does have a religious theme in the mix which some would be able to pick out the references in the plot. The plot is difficult to discuss without giving away spoilers. The less you know the better the film will be. It is difficult to even discuss what the movie is about and is best to view it than hear about it. All I can say is Jennifer Lawrence's character and Javier Bardem are a married couple living in a country side house. Until, guests arrive and there loyalties are tested. Plus the film does build some mystery with its eerie direction. And it raises a lot of questions throughout. Such as the visions Lawrence's character sees? Why cant she ever go outside the house? And why is Bardem's character so inviting to strangers? I like the theme and twist when the plot comes together. Some may have different perspective with what the message of the plot is trying to convey. The final half hour of the film is were it is all at. When chaos happens and it gets violent very fast. And to discuss what goes on here would not even make sense. Besides it is a crowdfest of violence. Darren Aronofsky direction was decent. Yes, it was good building up the mystery plot which they did a good job hiding it in the trailer. And the film can mislead the audience if they are expecting a horror movie from it. When you see the film the direction and plot is completely different than it is suppose to be. Think of 2009 film Knowing, were the plot shifts into a completely different direction but besides the mass destruction and end of the world theme. Jennifer Lawrence was great. Playing a character that is soft spoken and sweet. But you learn very little about her character besides she takes some kind of yellow drink when her visions appear. She sees images of blood spurts on the ground that gets bigger throughout. Javier Bardem was also good as well, and his character is also kept a mystery. Why is he so inviting to strangers? How do these strangers have a connection to him? The film does have an eerie direction. In matter fact, there is no music score in the film. It is all plain silence and noise from the set and actors. And also you never hear a characters name or do not even know what these characters names are. It is all left for the audience interpretation. The movie can be slow moving. Which the audience will need patience for. If you have patience to see the plot fold together than it is for you. If you do not care to see Lawrence walking around the house and seeing all these suspicious activities from people or objects than I suggest you skip this one.Overall, Mother! Is a fair psychological horror film. It has an eerie direction. The cast was wonderful. The plot is slow moving and requires a lot of patience. The twist and theme is fairly okay which does leave it open for the audience to talk about. It is also one of those films that you do not really care about seeing again.I rate the film 3 out of 5 stars.",6,0,0,20 December 2017
Creed II," Creed packs an intense punch from performances and an inspiring story.
","Creed 2 (4 out of 5 stars).Creed 2 packs a wild punch as a sequel based on a spin off on the Rocky series on the character Adonis Creed. Yes, the plot feels a little similar to the previous films. Creed (Michael B. Jordan) is having a great life with small boxing fights, moving to the next step with his relationship Bianca (Tessa Thompson) who's music career is taking off, and Rocky (Sylvester Stallone) still helps him as a friend. In Russia, Ivan (Dolph Lundgren) and his son Viktor (Florian Munteanu) is rising up in the boxing world and plans to get respect back after being disgraced when his father lost to Rocky. Viktor plans to challenge Adonis Creed to a boxing match. Rocky hesitant on Creed taking the challenge after Ivan's fight with Adonis father did not end well and Rocky is still left a little scarred. Adonis will train himself and push harder to face against Viktor.The plot was good. Similar to the previous films but it is about the inspirational story with Adonis Creed. The film may have a central theme about being a father figure and being there for family. With Adonis afraid of starting a family and inspired by his father. While Rocky is having a struggling relationship with his distant son. And Ivan trying to inspire his son Viktor. A lot of things is going and moving with the plot and its inspirational theme. The pay off with Adonis training after a brutal first fight with Viktor is spectacular. And the boxing fight with Adonis and Viktor is intense and brutal. You can feel the punches Adonis takes in and the strength to not give up.Michael B. Jordan was great yet again. Sylvester Stallone aging as Rocky but delivers a great character. Tessa Thompson was great too. And has a couple of musical sequences with her singing career which was stunning. And Dolph Lundgren and Florian Munteanu were both great. More quiet type of characters but menacing from their facial performances.Overall, Creed 2 is a good film. The story is inspirational with father themes. The acting was great. The training and fight sequences are intense and brutal. It may be a little long with its pacing but definitely a good movie.",8,1,2,12 December 2018
The Greatest Showman," Fantastic and one of the best musicals that has such a powerful emotional story.
","The Greatest Showman surpassed my expectations for a musical historical drama film. Definitely, one of the best films of the year. It has everything you can expect in a musical. The plot is emotional and beautiful at the same time, the musical set pieces are fantastic and the songs are just beautiful. The cast were all great with there characters. I enjoyed every minute of the film. It nearly has everything and an inspirational love story that will make you have tears and smile in the end. The plot follows P.T. Barnum (Hugh Jackman), who was once a tailor's boy and struggled throughout his childhood with providing food for his father. He fell in love with his childhood sweetheart Charity (Michelle Williams). They grew up and married and had kids. His work goes bankrupt with him having the struggle to afford a roof over his family. He decides to open a circus with extraordinary people. He inspires them to join, that they should not be afraid to hide their appearances. It does create a crowd outrage, when people who are judgmental disapprove of there show starts backfirin. P.T. will need the help from a famous singer to help draw the crowd in. But when it will be too much when P.T. loses himself from the greed of one than being part of a bigger family. What I liked about the film is everything about it. It has a beautiful love story. P.T. struggles to build himself and able to support his family. By struggling to bring in a crowd to his shows to earning enough to buy Charity's family estate home. He puts a team together that will eventually be one big family. He brings in a lost actor Phillip (Zac Efron) to his circus family where he falls for Anne (Zendaya), which would create a backlash from the judgmental public about their race and relationship. It is a cute heartwarming love story, were one gives it all up for their love ones. The musical set pieces are just astonishing. The music soundtrack was great. Every cast did well with there singing. Even if it was recorded at the studio and lip sync. The music was great. The Greatest Showman song was fantastic and even the rewriting the stars set piece done by Zac Efron and Zendaya was just beautiful and it was really hard to take your eyes off the screen from this sequence. I am not a huge fan of musicals since it eventually falls flat or there are some songs that gets boring. Not The Greatest Showman. Every song was great, even when some songs are done again. It was great and it worked with the story and characters in the film. It was never boring. Hugh Jackman was amazing. Zac Efron did great. Michelle Williams was good. Zendaya is beautiful and her character did great. Overall, The Greatest Showman is such a great film. Every musical song was amazing. It delivers emotions and joy when watching these characters. The plot was a beautiful inspirational love story. It was always entertaining and fun to watch with the cast ensemble. I recommend seeing the film in theatres for its beautiful fantastic musical set pieces. Even if you are not a musical fan or are. You may enjoy this film. I rate the film 5 out of 5 stars.",10,0,1,12 January 2018
Pitch Perfect 3," Third time may not be the best time for the Acabellas to return which lacked the fun the first movie had.
","The acabellas are back in this final installment and good riddance from what started to be a fun filled musical comedy to redundant boredom. I loved the first Pitch Perfect film, it introduced the audience to the world of acabellas and singing without using any instruments. The characters were different and fun, and the plot never was cliché. The second film was fun but lacking in a story. Pitch Perfect 3 lacks the plot, humor, and the characters are no longer interesting from what they once used to be. On a positive note, this third installment is supposed to be the final film in the series with the story concluding the characters. The Bellas are done with college and are living among their lives. Beca (Anna Kendrick) loses her job cause she was not cooperative with her music manager. Fat Amy (Rebel Wilson) lives with Beca and host her own street corner shows singing Amy Winehouse mix ups. When every one is not happy with the path they tried working for, they all meet up at a reunion invited by Emily (Hailee Steinfeld). They all decide to partake on a tour for United Service Organization competing against some ruthless bands that hold no rules and use instruments. There was not much of a plot. We learn that Aubrey (Anna Camp) father is in the military and she all of a sudden gets passes to sing in the tour after their own friends invitation did not open them up to singing at the reunion. Then, there is a sub plot of Fat Amy's father shadowing their group overseas played by John Lithgow, who tries to reconnect with her by placing a stuffed animal on her pillow. And another sub plot with Beca getting the attention from a music manager which he is recruiting only her. Then, in the end as every one started off with their miserable jobs. They all fall back to the same position they started with. Besides they got to see and sing with each other for one last time. This film also lacked in humor and it was not as funny as the first film. Most of the jokes are all Rebel Wilson's character trying to say the most wisecrack lines that are annoying than funny. Hailee Steinfeld's character is the one being poked at for stupid responses. Brittany Snow is falling in love with a military guy with lots of awkward encounters. Hana Mae Lee is still the quiet one and a mystery. Alexis Knapp steps out on this one for majority of the film. And Elizabeth Banks and her co commentator are still on the spot light cracking jokes about feminism and sexist humor. Overall, Pitch Perfect 3 is a miss this time around. It was not as funny. It was boring at times. The characters are not as entertaining as they used to be. The plot is just horrible. I rate the film 2.5 out of 5 stars. I would recommend this film as a rental. It just was not worth sitting through this in theatres.",5,4,13,22 December 2017
Jojo Rabbit," Take Waititi's direction, humor, and charm delivers again.
","Jojo Rabbit (5 out of 5 stars).Jojo Rabbit is a comedy drama film that goes over a dark serious event of WWII but with a little Taika Waititi's script and direction of humor, and charm. This film delivers. It is a lot of fun, has some quirky humor, a great cast, and a plot about a serious and dark issue but with a little heart in it. This kind of film is not going to be for everyone. It is what it is with this kind of movie. Audiences may have trouble connecting to the main character Jojo, a kid who is trying to be a Nazi. He is raised different, sees the world in a blind eye. But it is also a coming of age kind of story being caught in the world of conflict. It is one of those plots were it is best to see for yourself than read about it cause it does not sound appealing especially over the issue with the kid trying to be a nazi.The plot follows Jojo (Roman Griffin Davis) a young boy in Germany. His father is absent cause he is sent out in the war. And he lost his sister to some sickness. While his mother Rosie (Scarlett Johansson) is caring and sweet. Jojo is sent out to a boys camp for Hitler's youth training. Led by Captain Klenzendorf (Sam Rockwell), and his assistants Fraulen (Rebel Wilson) and Finkel (Alfie Allen). When an accident sends Jojo home. Jojo finds out his mother has been hiding a teenage jewish girl Elsa (Thomasin McKenzie). Jojo afraid and hesitant on living with this girl. He tries to aid in keeping her hidden.The plot is great. It is a coming of age story during WWII. And being raised to follow a Hitler's laws. Jojo's world is turned upside down when he sees that his mother is part of the resistance and helping a young girl hide in their home. Jojo was stuck in believing the horrible rumors on what he thought the Jews are. While learning from Elsa that her and him are not so different.The cast ensemble is great. Roman Griffin Davis and Thomasin McKenzie are great with the lead roles. They are sweet and delivered fun roles. Taika Waititi plays Adolf Hitler as a imagination that talks to Jojo. Jojo has an imaginary friend that is Hitler that tries to keep him company. Taika Waititi's performance humor is a lot of fun to watch. Rebel Wilson, Alfie Allen, Sam Rockwell, and Scarlett Johansson are all great with their performances.The film's script and direction is a lot of fun. The characters are fun. The humor is entertaining. And the story is charming and goes over a serious dark time about loss and friendships.Overall, Jojo Rabbit is a great film. It is entertaining. Fun.

Plot about the dark elves and the Ether which comes into an important role with MCU. The cast ensemble is good. The visual effects are great. The film does have an emotional moment. The villain i thought was underdeveloped and forgettable. The ending does leave off in a cliffhanger for another.There is an important mid credit scene and a post credit scene that is played for laughs which i thought it was a waste.,9,0,0,5 May 2020
Midway," Lots of action to make this worth watching but lacking in a good script.
","Midway (3 out of 5 stars).Midway is a fair war film delivered by Roland Emmerich who makes films that are big blockbuster action movies. Midway is not a great war movie or a great film in general. It delivers on plenty of action sequences with aerial combat. Realistically it is no Dunkirk with the realism on the practical stunts than having actors sit in a stage production with all visual effects. The visual effects are decent. The script lacks in delivering characters that stands out. The story was okay about the Battle of Midway. Roland Emmerich's focuses on building the action suspense but not leaving any satisfaction in the end. I feel like this film does make Michael Bay's Pearl Harbor feeling like a masterpiece when it comes to a story with a forced love story, better action and aerial combat that puts you on the edge of your seat, and the emotional impact you have with the victims and soldiers that was under attack.What worked great with Midway? Well for a war film, Roland Emmerich does pack a punch with having a lot action in it. The cinematography was good and making you feel like you are with the pilots in the fighter planes. The opening sequence with Pearl Harbor being attacked tried to set the tone of the film. It was not as powerful like Michael Bay's Pearl Harbor. The rest of the film focuses on Dick (Ed Skrein) flying in the air, and getting into a lot of aerial combat with the Japanese. Dick is a cowboy, and cocky personality who flies and living on the edge when he is dive bombing. Evantually, the action sequences with aerial scenes do get repetitive. Dick and his other fighters flying high and dive bombing into a Japanese carrier. Hoping their missiles hit their ships.The film has a great cast ensemble. Sadly, none of the actors have room to develop their characters. Ed Skrein, Woody Harrelson, Patrick Wilson, Luke Evans, Mandy Moore, Nick Jonas, and Aaron Eckhart. None of the characters have a characterization which makes them standout. The script lacks in delivering actual people who went through these events. Instead, the film makes every character forgettable.The plot about the battle of Midway is a great feature to be brought onto film. After Pearl Harbor, Americans sent out several carriers to aid in Midway. Which American fighter pilots were trying to stop the Japanese carriers from beginning another attack. The movie lacks in delivering an emotional story when it is too focused on bringing flat characters from one set piece to another. Then, having the repetitive aerial battle throughout the two hour time frame.Overall, Midway is a fair war film. It delivers a lot of action and aerial combat. The visual effects are a little decent. The actors are forgettable with their characters from a shallow script. The story is lacking emotional depth with the characters.",6,6,12,9 November 2019

Life," Life is a lot of fun and intense. With a great cast ensemble and thrills. It can't be missed,
","Life is an awesome fun science fiction horror film that covers familiar ground with the story all while keeping the thrills and adrenaline rushing. Lets cross the first thing that may be running in everyone's minds and comparing Life to the Alien movie. Yes, it has that familiar plot of astronauts in a space station. They discover some lifeform that evolves into a killing monster. Everyone is killed off one by one. Life is more grounded compared to Alien. Sticking to a modern time and being more believable with the concept as the space crew reconnect with their satellite probe that was sent to Mars to get some samples. Some of those samples have some hibernating organism that develops and grows rapidly and gains intelligence. Next thing you know, this alien species they call 'Calvin,' is an unstoppable killing machine. The creature design on Calvin was also grounded and its incredible strength. Besides having a familiar story, the direction and script was fast paced and intense. The script tries to build some characterization briefly with the space crew. From an introspective Dr. Jordan (Jake Gyllenhaal), a medical analysis Dr. North (Rebecca Ferguson), Hugh (Ariyon Bakare), Katerina (Olga Dihovichnaya), Roy (Ryan Reynolds), and Sho (Hiroyuki Sanada). We learn briefly about these characters, but you also care for them when they meet a deadly bloody fate. Even, if there are some stupid choices made, being made for a logical reason. You actually feel sad when somebody dies in the film. Kind of rare for most horror films now and days, when the script has nothing but stock characters. The first character death scene was disturbing and bloody when their fate is sealed in a horrible way. Just like how Alien had that dinner table scene that really set the tone. The film does have plenty of thrills, as characters are trying to figure a way to eliminate Calvin and avoiding the alien from reaching Earth even if it requires they sacrifice their lives. What makes the thrills is the space station being small and tight corridors with the alien freely roaming and killing characters off. The intensity never slows down. The direction was pretty exciting, seeing characters being in a zero gravity setting and the visual effects was stunning and the creature design was grounded and creepy. It does have a fun great cast ensemble with some recognizable actors like Ryan Reynolds, Jake Gyllenhaal, and Rebecca Ferguson. And a few others. Without giving away spoilers, the film does have a twist in the end that left myself with a frustrated and surprised reaction in a good way. I thought the ending was intense and a bit nerve wrecking. But left the movie being satisfied. Overall, Life is a really good sci-fi horror movie that worked great on its own; it was a lot of fun, intense, and thrilling. Better than expected. I definitely recommend it if you care for the genre. I rate Life 4.5 out of 5 stars.",9,35,69,23 March 2017

Green Book," A fun emotional journey of two people going on a road trip.
","Green Book (4.5 out of 5 stars).Green Book is a really well done biographical comedy drama film about a true story of a Jamaican classical jazz pianist and his personal driver going on a road trip tour to some of the rough parts of the country during the time of racial segregation. It is a good story. Almost like a road trip buddy comedy. With two opposite people. The jazz pianist Don Shirley (Mahershala Ali) is a high class Jamaican American and has a condo of many expensive furniture and antiques. The bouncer/driver Tony Vallelonga (Viggo Mortensen) is an Italian American and struggling to make money to support his family. He is a loud foul mouth, blunt, a chain smoker, and eats a lot. He even put himself in a bet in an eating competition to make some money.The plot follows Tony when he loses his job in a night club cause of renovation. He gets an interview from Dr. Don Shirley. Tony is a bit of a racist. When he sees two African Americans doing some plumbing work in his apartment and his wife Dolores (Linda Cardellini) serves them a drink. After they set their glasses in the sink. Tony grabs the glasses and throws them out in the trash. When Shirley recruits Tony to be his driver for this music tour. Which would set him away from his family for two months. Tony and Shirley will have a lot to go over about each other. Shirley is proper and mannered. Tony is the complete opposite.It is one of those heartfelt stories. Yes, it does have some difficult scenes to watch during the racial segregation when Don Shirley gets denied to use the whites bathroom or eat in a public restaurant with the rest of the people. Or when he is given a closet of a room to get ready for the concert. Sure, Tony does not take that likely and react poorly by knocking whoever is rude to the guy out. There is some character development with Tony and Don becoming friends throughout the movie and are able to tolerate each other. Don trying fast food restaurants with Tony. It is fun to see Tony and Don react to each other on screen. From being the people who can not stand one or another to being close friends throughout the road trip journey.Viggo Mortensen was great playing Tony. With the gaining weight for the role and an Italian accent. Mahershala Ali was also great playing Don Shirley who is prim and proper with his mannerisms. Linda Cardellini playing Tony's loving wife, who is set more aside on the screen time. Waiting at home and writing to her husband.Overall, Green Book is a really good film. It does have a heartfelt emotional true story about Tony and Don Shirley. It does have some fun humor that will make you laugh and some tough emotional moments. The performances are great.",9,0,3,16 March 2019
Da 5 Bloods," Great performances, pretty decent plot with a strong theme but overlong slow running time.
",Da 5 Bloods (3.5 out of 5 stars).Da 5 Bloods is a pretty fair war drama film. About foue Vietnam vets that go back to the jungle in modern time to search for their best friend remains while searching for hidden treasure they buried.The plot is good also focusing on modern times of race and black lives matter concept. The film also shows the struggle each vet is going through mentally and physically. Delroy Lindo delivers a powerful performance that he is struggling with. The cast is good with there performances.The film does have a sense of style with Spike Lees direction with the narrative switching between Vietnam war to present day. I did not think this was Spike Lees best movie. But it was entertaining. I did have issues with how long the movie was. It was overlong and needed some editing to help with the pacing.,7,22,47,13 June 2020
John Wick: Chapter 2," John Wick is pure awesome with impressive action set pieces.
","John Wick does what no sequel can ever accomplish for this action thriller that lives up to the original. It's bigger and spectacle with impressive gun shoot outs and fight choreography. John Wick: Chapter 2 is awesome for those who liked the first movie or love action films. I found this film to be an improvement over the last installment when it came to the non stop action sequences, more strategic gun shoot outs, and a thrilling car chase. The plot follows not to distant from the first film. John Wick (Keanu Reeves) is contracted to go back to his old ways of being an assassin. Santino (Riccardo Scamarcio) sends him a target of killing his sister. Well, not every thing falls into plan when she has her body guard Cassian (Common) that will play cat and mouse with nonstop shootouts. And John Wick gets a high priced bounty on his head with every assassin trying to hunt him down. Director Chad Stahelski does what worked the first time around and tries to expand this world of assassins and continental hotels, where it's a safe haven for assassins with rules they have to play by. The plot is just straightforward and simple, which the film just uses to put every fight sequence in play. It would sometimes feel like a video game seeing John Wick fight against countless bad guys in every set piece in a creative way and on easy mode, which makes him look unstoppable. Chad Stahelski second film is starting to put him in line for making entertaining action films. Cause these types of films could have been flawed with repetitive shoot outs and no cares on what happens next. Unlike this second installment, every set piece tries to top the other. There was a subway sequence when John and Cassian were both trying to take each other out with silenced pistols in a crowded station while remaining covered from the public. Or a climax that takes place in a museum art shot in hallways with lighting mirror effect which makes these guys fighting each other difficult to find out were the gun is aiming at. The direction is well done in keeping a fast paced, loud gun shootouts and chases. The cinematography was well maintained in capturing impressive shots during the shootouts and the fight choreography. Keanu Reeves is back in action and he does not hold back. So far doing really well with these films. Then, we have Common, who plays a character that can be on the same league with John Wick's skills. Ruby Rose is stunning as ever as the fierce silent Assassin Ares. It is nice to see her doing more films, after seeing her in a brief appearance in Resident Evil: The Final Chapter or xXx 3. Hope to see her back in action in more movies. John Wick is an exciting joy ride for action fans and hopes to see more from this. I recommend seeing it, which you would not be disappointed.",10,24,51,9 February 2017
Annihilation," A stunning direction and cast but very slow moving.
","Rating 3 out of 5 stars. (Fair)Annihilation is suppose to be a smart science fiction horror film with a sharp direction and a plot that has themes that the audience can discuss right after it ends. It is a fair film. The direction is sharp and done by Alex Garland, whose previous work was Ex Machina which was a great film that also had a theme in there. Annihilation is at times beautiful with its set pieces on a landscape were laws of nature does not really bide by the rules when it comes to mutation. The cast ensemble was also decent as well. It is not Alex Garland's best film, as this sci fi movie does require a lot of patience with its slow moving story.Lets talk about the pros about this film. Annihilation is definitely one of those films that audiences will either be liking or hating it. Especially with its plot. I do not want to give away much details or spoilers about it. Besides it is about a group of military scientists led by Jennifer Jason Leigh, Natalie Portman, Gina Rodriguez, Tessa Thompson, and Tuva Novotny. They enter a mysterious zone known as Area X, were there is this force field wall called the shimmer. They enter it to locate the source and origin of this quarantined zone which seems to be growing. Once inside, they discover that landscapes and species mutations are beyond their imaginations. There is some creatures or cross breeding's with the animals. The plants are growing on an indifferent cycle as it evolves. But the scientists questions only remains about what happened to the previous several expeditions? Why has only one survivor from the previous expedition made it out? What is the purpose of the shimmer? The plot is mysterious and there is a twist that may throw the audience off course with the film. I like the twist. Sure, when it came to the third act of the movie, the climax was very trippy and visually stunning to look at. It is very unsettling and disturbing at the same time. The cast ensemble was great. Natalie Portman, Jennifer Jason Leigh, Gina Rodriguez, Tessa Thompson, and Tuva Novotny were great. Every one of there characters were not perfect and all had a connection of some kind on why they were chosen to enter the shimmer. Oscar Isaac's only had a short on screen time, mainly seen in flashbacks. The set design of the colorful plantation landscape was stunning. The visual effects were okay. Alex Garland unsettling direction was good too. What I did not like about the film. It is a slow moving film. You might even be asking yourself during it. If anything is going to happen at all. The group enters the shimmer, they are losing their awareness, and are traveling to get to the source of the shimmer. But going from one set piece to another and to stop and observe does go a long way. Nothing happens for most of the film until the climax. It does get boring. Then, there is flashbacks with Natalie Portman's character of her and her husband (Oscar Isaacs). Than the film flashes forward with Portman's character explaining the events in the shimmer. It does mess with the pace of the film and slow things down even more. I also felt like barely anything happened during most of the movie. The group come across a crocodile that has teeth like a shark. They come across mysterious plant life that is forming a shape of a standing person. And they see footage from the last expedition which may be disturbing. And than a giant sized mutated bear looking thing. But there was no suspense or thrills. I am sure the climax was suppose to be unsettling awe moment. But it was trippy and weird. But it missed the opportunity of being exciting. Overall, Annihilation is a fair science fiction film. The cast was good. The visual effects and set pieces were fun to look at. The direction and plot was sharp and driven with themes that may have people talking about. If you have the patience to sit through unnecessary flashbacks and its slow moving pace with nothing happening for a long running time. Than you may enjoy it. I will recommend the film as a rental, unless you're a huge fan of the sci fi genre and enjoy films like Arrival or 2001 Space Odyssey than I say see it in theatres.",6,2,7,24 February 2018

Incredibles 2," Incredibles is astonishing and awesome with its exciting visuals and lovable characters.
","Incredibles 2 (4.5 out of 5 stars).Incredibles 2 is an awesome superhero sequel that matches up to the original movie that was released 14 years ago. Now, that was also a risky move on pixar's end since they do not have a good track record with making good sequels except for Finding Dory. While, the rest of them like Cars or Toy Story were kind of losing there touch that made the original movies so good. Sure, the story was good in this sequel which focuses more on Elastigirl doing solo missions while her husband Bob is a stay home daddy with Dash, Violet, and baby Jack Jack. While Elastigirl is on a trail of a new villain called Screenslaver that brainswashes anybody that gets hypnotized by his static coding on monitors. Director Brad Bird is back and brings a lot of entertainment in his film. It has plenty of colorful visuals and the animation was stylish. The action sequences are great and exciting. The film follows right after the events on the first film when Mole man breaks through the city with his big driller. And the Incredibles family has to stop him. Which sets the plan in motion when the destruction makes the officials question if superheroes are even needed or do they create more destruction than just letting the bad guys get away clean. The train sequence was fun and exciting with Elastigirl chasing it with her motorcycle and trying to stop an unstoppable train. Seeing Jack Jack experience his powers when the clueless father Bob is burnt out from being a stay home father. While Dash is having math trouble and Violet having boy trouble. The family dynamic is a lot of fun and entertaining. I do feel like the film slows down with the sub plot of Winston Deaver, a superhero fan that is recruiting other superheroes to help fight crime and to prove to the officials that society need heroes. The other superheroes that are introduced are forgettable. When the film backtracks to Mr. Incredible and his way of handling with the kids at home is back on screen. It is amusing. Or seeing Elastigirl back in action. When it comes to sequels that lose its touch or is inferior to the original. Incredibles 2 lives up to the hype and is worth the wait. The pace is on going and fast. It does not lose itself with uneven characters being on screen. Elastigirl is more focused on in the plot. But Bob and the family are not forgotten and they have plenty of screen time when they are back in action. When Violet and Dash are to the rescue while bringing an uncontrollable baby Jack Jack. And Frozone is back in action when he takes off with his suit while his wife nags in the background again. Overall, Incredibles 2 is a really good family superhero film. If you love the original, you will enjoy this just as much. Or if you love superhero movies, this one brings enough entertainment for children and adults to enjoy.",9,1,7,16 June 2018
Alien: Covenant," Ridley Scott is back to its suspense roots that made the original Alien film
","The master of science fiction of putting the audience back in Space on a colonization ship with a xenomorph alien on board. Ridley Scott is the answer. He introduced us to this science fiction horror movie with the first film that build the suspense and a story of survival. Then James Cameron's Aliens which was more action packed and gave Sigourney Weaver the stardom of being a heroic female character. Then, the yawnfest of Alien 3 and Resurrection. Along with AvP films. Alien: Covenant is a fun intense ride which is more exciting than Prometheus. Bringing back the science fiction horror concept and lots of bloody gory deaths. Yes, characters make the stupid decisions again. Like slipping on bloody floors when about to shoot an alien. Or looking through an alien egg and the end results the character has an alien bursting out of his chest. Which later becomes a faster xenomorph that chases the rest of the survivors. The plot follows the crew of covenant, a colonizing vessel that is heading to a brand new world to start over. When an energy surge cause distress to their ship, awakening the crew members and killing a couple. Daniels (Katherine Waterston) and her team receive a distress signal coming from a nearby planet. Which they manage to get too and land to see if the planet is inhabitable to live on. Until a crew member gets infected, releasing terror. Daniels discovers the fate of the remaining Prometheus survivor Dr. Elizabeth Shaw (Noomi Rapace) and David (Michael Fassbender). I enjoyed Prometheus for being a prequel to exploring the space engineers and for being its own science fiction film. I also preferred to see a bit of terror and some xenomorph which is what made these films. Alien: Covenant does bring back the alien, it also has more suspense action, and the visual effects were good too. Ridley Scott does the familiar set up, showing us the crew Daniels, Tennessee (Danny McBride), Oram (Billy Crudup), Lope (Demian Bircher), Karine (Carmen Ejogo), and Walter (Michael Fassbender). Acting wise they all did great. Fassbender played Walter/David really well. David being creepy and weird. Katherine Waterston did well, playing another heroic female star. May not live up to Sigourney Weaver. But still great. Scott does escalate the bloody death scenes. The first death scene of an alien bursting out of a person was bloody and disturbing. And the body count does go up once the early stage of these xenomorphs are loose and discovering a terrible secret that wiped out the civilization on the planet. The action sequence of Daniels battling out the xenomorph on top of an aircraft was intense as she dangles around the ship, trying to get the alien off. Even during the climax, as Daniels and Tennessee run around tight corridors in a ship with an alien on board was thrilling. I can't discuss anymore about the plot without giving much away. When things are going good and the film is feeling like an alien film. Even with music score by Jed Kurzel, recreating the music theme from the original alien movies was spine chilling to hear. The film does go back to its Prometheus concept theme with Davids hidden agenda which is not as appealing. There is a weird odd scene between David and Walter as they share philosophical views on music artists and their message behind them. And these get a little weird which makes the scene feel left out compared to the rest of the movie. I feel like it should have been left on the cutting room floor. Overall, Alien: Covenant is a really good science fiction horror film that Scott can manage to build the suspense with some fun terrifying action. The cast were a great ensemble even a small cameo with a known actor which has a farewell quick death scene. The terrifying xenomorph and bloody death scenes are thrilling. I definitely recommend the film if you enjoyed the alien films and Prometheus which is an improvement from that.",9,9,24,20 May 2017
