Antz," you've got to think for yourself
","Although animated and containing much humour, this film's message is more for adults than children.  Those of us who live our lives in the 'workaday' world of routine - getting up, going to work, coming home, and starting all over again the next day - should be most receptive to the message this film has to offer.  Every once in a while it's a good thing to stop and ask yourself 'what am I doing' or 'why am I doing this'.  In other words, don't be driven by life, rather be the driver - think for yourself.  This film contains many amusing moments, most notably the typical Woody Allen monologues that we are so used to seeing in his earlier films - nebish New Yorker becomes nebish 'New worker' ant.  Allen doesn't fit the mold and decides to find out what life is really all about by seeking out 'insectopia'.  Along with the colony princess - played by Sharon Stone, the two ants try to find out whether there's a better world outside the colony. It's not exactly your usual 'boy meets girl, boy falls in love with girl' flick but it sort of follows that pattern, with a few surprises along the way.  Kids will love the animation but the dialogue is what really wins the prize here and it's what the adults should enjoy most.  A very enjoyable film with something very kids of all ages.",Null,0,0,21 November 1998
The Beach," trite story, poorly executed
","There are lots of pretty things to look at in this movie - the leading lady, the scenery and lovely leonardo.  Unfortunately this movie has little else going for it.  It seems that when the producer and director were assembling this mess they forgot one thing, namely, a good writer.  Apart from poor writing this movie has been directed (or edited)so that the pacing is jumbled and inconsistent.  It is difficult to know whether the audience is expected to take this movie seriously or whether it is intended to be a comedy.  If you like beautiful beaches and lots of tanned skin give this movie a try but if you find yourself getting bored after 20 minutes be forewarned - that's all there is to it.",4,0,1,8 March 2001
