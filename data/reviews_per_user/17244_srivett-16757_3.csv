Hereditary," Oops, I should have picked another movie
","I was on an RV trip with the wife and we decided to watch a movie. We looked over the options and decided to watch this movie at the cinema. Neither of us enjoy gory movies.Well, I had no idea what the movie was about and figured it may actually be about real hereditary health issues. 20 minutes in and I figured it was an informative film about mental health problems. 40 minutes in and I was very confused. 60 minutes in and I wanted to leave. We stuck it out to the end and all 8 of the people in the theater stood up collectively. Two of the people seemed to have known what this movie was going to be and walked out of the theater calmly. The remaining 6 people (myself included) stood there and all said at the same time, 'What the hell was that?'. I could try to explain it but other reviews likely already do that. This is not a movie you could walk in cold and obtain value from it. I'm not sure if people who specifically search out horror movies could either but parts of it certainly do create some sorrow before you start getting confused again. Jeepers Creepers (2001) would be a much better movie for the unsuspecting audience. Calmly pop that movie in the machine after the sun has set and watch your friends slowly freak out. :D Watch Hereditary if you want them to crack up laughing as they walk out the door 1/2 way through.",1,1,4,18 September 2018
The Shape of Water," Oh Dear
",I broke my one rule of movie watching. Do not watch movies that get awards.I really liked the opening sequence and the sets. The boobs were good too. The rest of the movie was quite silly and was not engaging. There was unnecessary negativity and gruesome scenes that also took away from the movie. Then the plot holes and cliches...Did white people in the 1960's really behave like that? I don't know as I wasn't around and I don't need my nose rubbed in it either. Changes in society are best made through positivity. Maybe the group that made this movie will go and make a Nazi defeat movie next...we need more of those too?,1,31,56,18 September 2018
Jojo Rabbit," The annual Nazi movie
","What happened in WWII was very serious so don't misunderstand me.I went into this movie totally blind, we saw the 'poster' on the computer screen selling tickets and it didn't indicate it was any sort of Nazi or war movie so we thought it would be fun to have a complete surprise unfold before our eyes. I knew something was going on when they rolled 2 war movie advertisements as part of a really long opening to the movie. I mean really, there are people who fill their calendars with the opening dates of war movies?Anyway, this is a twist on the stereotypical European setting Nazi war movie where they focus of a few individuals instead of the mass horror that took place. Whoever keeps paying to have these annual Nazi movies produced needs to stop, the last one I went to was Inglorious Basterds and that was it for me. There is nothing new to be discovered with these movies. Please find a new war or at least a new setting outside of Europe. Please spend money creating awareness where there is no awareness. You have a great power to do so.The acting was OK and you can fall into the story but I wished I was watching something else the entire time.",4,6,28,26 November 2019
