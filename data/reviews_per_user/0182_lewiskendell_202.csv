The Blair Witch Project," Take a little trip into the woods.
","'I'm afraid to close my eyes. I'm afraid to open them.'The Blair Witch Project was the first really popular 'found footage' movie of my generation, and Cloverfield, Paranormal Activity, Quarantine, and other movies owe a lot of their success to this low-budget flick. If was mega-popular (though divisive) when it was released in 1999, but is it still chilling when watched today? For the most part, yes. What makes The Blair Witch Project effective is the great way that atmosphere and fear of the unknown are used, as well as how well the three actors sell their frustration, unease, and finally, terror. As the three amateur filmmakers get more and more lost in the woods, their anger and annoyance at one another and their situation does a great job of raising the tension. Add that to the local legends that they were exposed to before venturing out into the wilderness and the odd, disturbing events that start happening each night, and you've got a pretty creepy little film.The key to enjoying movies like The Blair Witch Project is how easily you can suspend your sense of disbelief and just go with what you're seeing. If the movie can draw you in, you'll probably have a good time with it. I didn't have a hard time putting myself in the shoes of our trio, and I know that if I had been in their situation, I would have been well and properly freaked out. It had been probably five years since I last saw this, but It still gave me the creeps and I still love the ending. It's a fun movie for the right kind of horror fan.",7,0,2,22 December 2010
Whip It," Ellen Page flexes a little muscle.
","Whip It fits comfortably into the mold of many sports movies that came before it. Sure, it puts its own spin on things. The female-centered story and the roller derby were all relatively new to me, but the rest is basically the same themes we've seen before. A protagonist who finds confidence in a sport they never thought they would be good at. A rival who turns out to be not be such a bad person, after all. A conflict between a parent who wants one thing for a child, and a child who wants to go down a different path. These situations show up so often in movies, because they make for an interesting (if familiar) story.Other than Jimmy Fallon (he's just too annoying for me to handle), the cast was pretty great. I love Ellen Page, so it's no surprise that I thought she was a great choice for the main character. There really wasn't much to complain about with this movie, at all. It may be nothing new, but it's well-done. And I actually know some things about roller derby, now.",7,1,4,5 April 2010
The Avengers," Most entertaining movie I've seen so far this year.
","I loved Iron Man and Thor, enjoyed Captain America: The First Avenger, and was slightly disappointed in Iron Man 2. But even the best of those movies were just a lead-up to The Avengers, which is absolutely one of the finest superhero movies, and one of the most entertaining movies of any kind, that I've seen.This is pure summer blockbuster fun. And I don't mean that in a way that limits the movie, but instead as an example of the best of what a summer blockbuster can be. The story is rather straightforward: a massive threat to Earth that's too big for any of our heroes to handle alone, and a rocky road of butting egos and misunderstandings stands between them and working together as a team. It's clear, easy to follow, and only has the briefest moments of lost momentum. The Avengers feels like it's the perfect length, with no action scenes that drag on too long into mindlessness or uneven pacing.What struck me most about it was the humor. It carried the movie even more than the excellent action scenes, the well-handled exposition or the interplay between our heroes. The Avengers is outright hilarious at times. The laughs are woven organically throughout. The tone of the movie just feels right, which is probably the best compliment that I can give it.I must say that my expectations were easily surpassed by the first assembly of the Earth's mightiest heroes. Marvel definitely made the right decision to carefully lay the groundwork for The Avengers the past few years, and it paid off. And it helps immensely that they chose the right man to write and direct it. Can't wait for Avengers 2!",9,4,9,14 May 2012
National Treasure: Book of Secrets," More adventuring with Ben Gates.
","'This is ridiculous.'If Helen Mirren says it, it must be true. National Treasure 2: Book of Secrets is indeed ridiculous. Even more so than its predecessor.Ben Gates (Nicholas Cage, once again in a role that requires him to basically act like Nicholas Cage) is hot on the trail of another historical treasure, this time to clear the name of his great-grandfather, who's been implicated in the infamous assassination of President Lincoln. Don't try to figure out how those two things are connected, as the plot is just an excuse to keep the action speeding from one location to the next.Book of Secrets follows the formula of the original movie extremely closely. There are once again hidden messages to be found on historical documents, centuries-old riddles that Ben puzzles out the answers to incredibly easily, high-security historical landmarks to waltz in and out of, and a villain that accompanies the protagonists underground for a finale based around a large action set-piece.   Riley and Abigail (Justin Bartha and Diane Kruger, both essentially just collecting a paycheck) are given nominal reasons to go treasure hunting with Ben again, and this time around he's also joined by his mother (Helen Mirren), as well as his father (Jon Voight). Mirren, Ed Harris as the antagonist, and the locations are the only real differences between the second movie and the first. Ben even finds himself once again being pursued by FBI Agent Sadusky (Harvey Keitel).If the idea of a near-exact copy of the first movie turns you off, then I'd advise you to stay away. If you're up for more and can overlook the barely there plot and mammoth liberties taken with historical fact, then I say go for it. As for me, I don't mind switching my brain off again and watching Cage ponder ridiculous historical 'facts' and Diane Kruger be hot for another two hours. National Treasure 2 is as entertaining as the first movie, for better or for worse.",6,0,0,13 August 2010
Kill Bill: Vol. 2," Tarantino's Version of a Family Drama
","'Bill. Where's Bill?'While Volume 1 was a love letter to Kung-Fu films, Volume 2 is a family drama at its heart. Here we get the 'why' to go with Volume 1's, 'how'.The Bride shows the human part of her self, and this results in a plethora of very human moments. Vol. 1 was about style and imagery, Vol. 2 is gritty and brutal. The hateful jealousy of Elle and Bud's cunning familiarity, offer stark counter-points to the indifferent Vernita and O-Ren's detachment. In Volume 1, Beatrix battled those who only hurt her because it was their job. In Volume 2, she confronts those who had a much more personal stake in her tragic past.Despite the considerable changes in tone between the two volumes, the themes remain consistent. I prefer the first volume more, but the second volume is even more important to the overall story arc. There are still great fights, excellent music, and wonderful writing (the Pai-Mei scenes are some of my favorites from any movie, period), but don't expect a direct continuation of Volume 1's style. Approach this as the second side to Kill Bill's coin, and you'll enjoy it.",8,0,1,13 March 2010
Vertigo," Hitchcock brings his patented brand of mystery to San Francisco.
","'Go up the stairs. Go up the stairs, Judy, and I'll follow.'How far, how deep into obsession can love for a woman drive a man? That's the very question that Alfred Hitchcock tackles in this twisty thriller.Having little knowledge of the plot of Vertigo is even more necessary than the average Hitchcock movie, so I'll reveal as little as possible. Jimmy Stewart plays an ex-detective who is convinced by an old friend to secretly follow his wife (Kim Novak), who has been acting strangely. What comes next is a completely unpredictable and dark tale of love, death, deceit, and obsession. The only thing that keeps Vertigo from being amongst my favorite Hitchcock movies is its uneven quality. The tone of the first half of the movie is quite different from the second half, and while that makes complete sense within the context of the story, I found the latter portion to be much more entertaining, as a result. The ending ranks right there with Notorious and The Birds as the most memorable that Alfred ever did.This was the first Hitchcock movie I ever saw, and in hindsight, it was a great one to begin with. Vertigo's mixture of mystery and darkness is a perfect introduction to the legendary director, and it fully deserves the sterling regard that it's earned over the years.",7,2,4,8 August 2010
Black Swan," Dark. Uncomfortable. Unrelenting. Amazing.
","'I felt it. Perfect. It was perfect.'Some directors make movies that are 'experiences'. Darren Aronofsky is one of those directors. Black Swan is a combination of the unbearable descent into hallucinatory madness featured in Requiem for a Dream, and the unflinching pain and physical drive to be one thing and one thing only, as seen in The Wrestler (and those just happen to be my two favorite Aronofsky movies). The marriage of those two elements is a fascinating movie that's frightening, uncomfortable, and tries its hardest to make it difficult for you to keep your eyes on the screen, even as you're riveted by what you see.Portman is amazing. The camera is almost always tight on her, just as the pressure of her mother, her ballet director, and her rivals is always pressed oppressively close against her. This is not the story of a normal woman coming unraveled. Nina is frayed from the first moment we meet her, both physically and mentally.I've never been a massive Portman fan, but I always thought that she was a nice enough actress. Here, she impresses with not only her ballet skills, but her ability to communicate fear, frustration,  obsession, and psychosis. Mila Kunis puts in another solid performance in the string of good movies that's she's been in the last few years. She's simultaneously threatening and endearing. Vincent Cassel is suffocating and terrifying (from Nina's point of view, which is also our point of view) as the ballet director. Barbara Hershey is overbearing and disturbingly motherly, as Nina's mom, and puts perhaps the greatest burden of stress on Nina's shoulders.Black Swan feels like an Aronofsky film, through and through. His fingerprints are all over it. His camera style, the way he brings the audience in and makes them feel a part of the character, and experience in a way what the character is experiencing. This is not a movie for everyone. It's horror, but a psychological kind of horror that puts us directly into the fractured, overwhelmed, frustrated mind of a person. After only one viewing, Black Swan hasn't quite replaced The Wrestler as my favorite Aronofsky movie. But, it is clearly his most interesting film by far, as well as his most artistic and his most technically spectacular. Black Swan crawled under my skin, and I can't wait to see it again.",9,2,4,28 January 2011
Pirates of the Caribbean: On Stranger Tides," Fourth time's the charm?
","'I have no say in it, Gibbs. It's a pirate's life for me. Savvy?'I think a fresh start was exactly what the Pirates of the Caribbean franchise needed, and as a result, this is the best entry in the series since the first movie.While the second and third movies were overly-long and tedious, On Stranger Tides goes for fun and entertainment over the increasingly seriously direction the last couple of movies followed. Jack Sparrow's search for the Fountain of Youth is still a little too long (there's really no reason for these movies to be over two hours in length), and there was DEFINITELY no need for another peripheral love story now that Bloom and Knightley's storyline was finally (and mercifully) ended in At World's End. The characters of Philip and Syrena are blatantly forced into the story just so there would be another couple, and the time and attention focused on those two definitely hurts the overall pacing of the movie. They're are by far my biggest complaint about On Stranger Tides. I like the other new additions to the cast, though. The new villain, Blackbeard is appropriately menacing and Penelope Cruz fits the PotC world like a particularly sexy hand in a glove. I'm glad and slightly surprised to be able to say that the forth entry in this franchise is a good one, and it accomplishes that by going back to what made the first one so likable; it gives us a fun adventure that's not weighed down by attempts to be dark and serious.",7,0,1,23 November 2011
Howl's Moving Castle," Beautiful, but the story is lacking.
","Watching a new Studio Ghibili movie is an event that has few equals in film. Each time, the viewer knows that by the time the movie is over, there's a huge chance that they will have another title to add to their list of favorites. That's a wonderful thing...but with expectations like those, sadly there is bound to eventually be disappointment. I suppose that time has finally come for me. I certainly didn't hate Howl's Moving Castle. Some parts of it were as wonderful as I could have ever expected. First of all, it's beautiful. I could not have asked for more in that regard. The backgrounds, settings, and characters are so gorgeously drawn and animated, that each frame is its own individual work of art. A number of the characters were very appealing to me, as well. Who didn't instantly love Sophie and Turnip-head? I even liked the character of Calcifer (and Billy Crystal's voice-acting). On the other hand, I never warmed to Christian Bale's Howl or The Witch of the Wastes, but that makes complete sense within the context of the story. Those two creations were not really written to be liked.(A special commendation has to be given to the animators and voice actors who kept Sophie as a clearly recognizable character, even as her appearance underwent several changes. That couldn't have been easy to do, but it really helps the viewer form a bond with her.)  So, where did my disappointment come from? The story. I realize that this isn't an original Miyazaki creation (instead, it's an adaptation of a popular British book from the 80's), so perhaps they had difficulties in working within another person's vision? So much that I wanted to know about the characters and their world, is left unexplained. Huge plot points come and go in a brief span of time, with very little comment. Howl's story was fortunately fully-resolved, and it could be argued that everything else is unnecessary, but it feels to me like there were a lot of missed opportunities. Even the main plot was a bit boring and frustratingly vague. Howl's Moving Castle could have been a fantastic movie, but these niggling issues make it no better than average.There's a wide-range of discussion and contention about which Miyazaki movie is the best, but general consensus is that none of them are less than decent . Some people will absolutely love this, it just didn't appeal to my tastes as much as some other Ghibli films have. At the very least, Howl's Moving Castle is worth watching for the extraordinary visuals.",6,0,1,22 March 2010
Borat: Cultural Learnings of America for Make Benefit Glorious Nation of Kazakhstan," Still a brilliant comedy, four years later.
","'I had learned that if you chase a dream, especially one with plastic chests, you can miss the real beauty in front of your eyes.'Reviewing Borat is a bit of a conundrum, because I had to decide on a score based one either how funny it was when it originally came out, or how funny I find it to be now, after I've seen it about six times. The latter won out, which is why my score is a little lower than it would have been four years ago. The first time I saw Borat still ranks among the top two funniest theater experiences that I've ever had (Team America: World Police holds the other spot). The whole theater was in stitches and gasping for breath, and my group was no exception. There may be a method to Sacha Baron Cohen's madness and a genuine message about intolerance and bigotry underneath this movie, but the humor is crass, low-brow, raunchy, and absolutely hilarious. I won't bother to explain the Borat phenomenon, because I'm sure anyone who's in any way remotely interested has known about it for several years. The movie still holds up pretty well, and while some of the shocks and audacity of it don't make as much of an impact any more, Cohen's bumbling, anti-Semetic, misogynistic, gleefully offensive character still does. If you have somehow missed seeing this and you enjoy comedy like South Park, watching Borat will make your face turn blue. And I mean that in a good way.",8,0,1,2 September 2010
Requiem for a Dream," All I can say is, wow.
","'Harry...can you come today?'I think Darren Aronofsky is such a brilliant director, because every movie that he's done makes you feel something. Requiem for a Dream made me feel uncomfortable, depressed, and a little sick on the inside, and it's an amazing movie for achieving those things. This is a movie about addictions, appropriately divided into sections entitled Summer, Fall, and Winter. An interconnected group of people take parallel journeys as a result of their habits, and the viewer comes along for the painful ride. Requiem isn't really a 'preachy' movie, if that's what you're expecting. It's a little hard to describe it in a quick review, it's something that needs to be seen and experienced. And it is an experience, for lack of a better description. The same way that Mulholland Drive is an experience. It's something that goes beyond just sitting down for two hours to be entertained. I have to make special mention of the way camera techniques are used to augment the story. The camera angles and various film styles employed here are just brilliant, and greatly helped draw me into the story. The score was great, as well.Requiem for a Dream is a masterpiece, but it would be inaccurate for me to say I enjoyed it. It made a definite impact on me, though, and I find that to be just as important. A must see.",9,0,0,3 September 2010
Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," Not a bad movie, but definitely a flawed one.
","'The chosen one the boy may be. Nevertheless, grave danger I fear in his training.'In the years since I've seen Episode I, I had forgotten how close Jar Jar Binks comes to ruining this entire movie. I was even looking forward to seeing it again, since I've only watched it once before and had forgotten most of it. But then, Jar Jar popped up on the screen and opened his mouth, and I was re-introduced to the single most stupid and annoying character in the history of science fiction. I can't imagine even young children enjoying his insufferable shrieking. Sigh. As for the rest of the movie (other than some occasionally suspect acting), it's actually okay. The pod racing is still fun to watch today, there was some exciting action scenes, and Darth Maul was cool enough to almost make up for all the Jar Jar. The story isn't the best the series has to offer, but it's good enough to be a worthy addition to the Star Wars mythos. If the blatant efforts to make Episode I as appealing to kids as possible could have been toned down some (trust me, they would have liked it anyway), this probably wouldn't have been considered the ugly step-child of the Star Wars franchise. As it is, though, The Phantom Menace is a flawed movie that manages to overcome that and be entertaining, anyway. I guess that's the power of the Star Wars legacy; this universe is so rich that even lesser entries are hard to not like.",Null,0,4,25 September 2011
Sucker Punch," Very flawed, but very fun (for the right audience).
","'You have all the weapons you need. Now fight!'Sucker Punch is a cheesecake action movie that offers a crazy premise, lots of hot girls, and non-stop video game/anime inspired explosions and fights. If you expect anything more than that from the movie, you will be greatly disappointed. This is a niche film if I've ever seen one. It's simultaneously silly, dark, and very grim. All sex appeal and slow-motion back flips. Style over substance taken to a new peak. And a lot of people will most assuredly hate it.   Will this appeal to you? Picture watching a hot girl having a sword fight with giant Gatling gun-wielding demon samurai (in slow motion and with lots of explosions and collapsing buildings) one minute, and then watching five hot girls fight a WWI-inspired battle against Nazi Zombies the next minute. With giant mechs. And then there are dragons. And orcs. And nothing but the flimsiest excuse for why these things are happening. And each girl dresses like a burlesque dancer or call girl at all times. And there's non-stop violence involving said scantily-clad girls. Sucker Punch is two hours of exactly all those things.Oh, and there are three separate realities that the characters exist in. I won't even bother trying to explain the story, because it's just an insane excuse to see half-naked women do things and kill stuff in slow motion. Don't worry about the plot, it will just distract you from focusing on Baby Doll (Emily Browning) shooting down a Zeppelin with a machine gun, while wearing a sailor outfit/Japanese school girl uniform. Or keep you from focusing on Rocket (Jena Malone) while she's blowing off a robot's head with a sawed-off shotgun and trying to stop a bomb on a speeding train from blowing up a city. If you're going to watch this movie, you'll get the best experience by keeping your attention solely on what's happening right in front of you at any given moment, and forgetting about what's happened before or what the overall story is supposed to be, and how any of this is supposed to fit into it. Just go with it.Sucker Punch is nonsensical, silly, and lots of people who see it will think it's purely exploitative, empty, action-driven trash. That's a fair assessment. I can't fault them for that opinion. Even a fan of the movie (which I am, in case you can't tell by now) has to admit that at it's very best, Sucker Punch is an absurd, sleazy male fantasy with only the most shallow visual appeal and thrills to recommend it. I still found it very entertaining, though. Flaws and all, this was ultimately a fun movie (for me). For the right audience, Sucker Punch is a uniquely exhilarating genre flick that combines babes, action, and a ton of different influences in a way that doesn't happen very often. Just consider my review carefully before you watch something that could possibly be a massive waste of your time. As for me, I'm looking forward to a blu-ray release that hopefully restores the footage that was cut from the theatrical version. This is a crazy ride, but I'm totally prepared to take it again.",7,3,5,1 April 2011
Source Code," A second impressive feature from a director with nothing but promise.
","Source Code is a very cool sci-fi action/drama from Duncan Jones. It's much faster-paced and less philosophical than his previous feature, Moon, and it's even more satisfying, in my opinion. The plot, which involves a man reliving the same 8 minutes before a terrorist attack over and over in order to find the person responsible for it, is intelligent without ever becoming hard to follow. Jake Gyllenhaal gives a great performance as a harried, confused man who eventually finds focus and purpose in what he's been tasked to do. You don't have to be a hardcore sci-fi fan to enjoy this, as it's grounded in the real world in a way that makes it very easily accessible. Source Code gets my full recommendation. It's an exciting, smart, original movie with heart.",8,0,1,17 September 2011
The Young Victoria," Another solid historical drama.
","'You are confusing stubbornness with strength, my dear. And I warn you, the people will not like you for it.'I think I've seen more of these British historical/period dramas in the past year than I had seen in the entirety of the previous twenty-three years of my life. I guess I've become somewhat of a fan of the genre. The Young Victoria is similar in quality to the two prior to it that I've seen: The Duchess and The Other Boelyn Girl. I've actually given them all the same rating; but for different reasons. As in those movies, the crucial performance of the film rests on the shoulders of a young actress, and I thought that Emily did an admirable job. I'd put her turn as Queen Victoria slightly behind Keira Knightley's role  in The Duchess, and slightly ahead of Portman and Johansson as the Boelyn sisters. She expertly handles the role of a very young, inexperienced woman who steps into position of huge power and must deal with the countless suspect influences of those around her.The settings and costumes are as opulent as one would expect from a movie like this, and perfectly serve to immerse the viewer into upper crust nineteenth century England. The story is also what one would expect, with all the drama and focus on romance that these sorts of movies are known for indulging it. I found the last 15 minutes or so to be slightly disappointing, as they devolved into overly melodramatic romance and a sort of cliché montage that was at odds with the quality of the scenes that preceded it. That earned The Young Victoria a slightly lower score, but it's still a minor complaint.I recommend this to anyone who has a preference for these kinds of romanticized takes on the nobility of yesteryear. It's still not the truly great entry into the genre that I'd like to see (I've heard that Elizabeth is very good, perhaps I should try that), but fans of similar movies won't be disappointed.",6,1,1,5 July 2010
The Ring," Psychological horror doesn't get much better.
","Psychological horror films can be among the most effective ones. Their reliance on slowly building tension and atmosphere makes them less susceptible to the desensitization that can come with the repeated 'jump scares' and excessive gore that can be an issue in other kinds of horror movies. Of course, psychological horror always must be sure to not be too slow-paced, because then it becomes boring. The Ring is a perfect example of what I consider a good psych-horror movie to be, because it unfolds like a mystery and keeps the viewer cerebrally involved...as it scares the crap out of them. There really is a good story here. Figuring out what is going on and why is a great part of why The Ring is one of my favorite horror flicks. It completely avoids many of the genre's clichés, while still providing scene after scene of unsettling imagery. We're talking some really freaky stuff. The characters come off as relatively normal human beings, instead of the annoying one-note caricatures that populate so many of the movie's contemporaries. I really think that it surpasses the original Japanese version in almost every way. The story is tighter, more focused, and more consistent. I love Naomi Watts, so it's no surprise that I think the casting was pretty great. And as I said before, the atmosphere is absolutely stellar. All the greys, blues, fog and rain mixed with the growing despair of the characters, really helps to put the viewer in the right mood. It's amazing how a sense of dread permeates the entire film, even though the main antagonist is seen so sparingly. There's virtually no gore or violence, and everything works exceptionally well without it. This movie scared the hell out of me in high school, and it still does today. It's a great mystery/thriller, artfully woven into one of the best horror movies in years.",7,4,7,20 April 2010
Resident Evil: Afterlife," How much more ridiculous can these movies get?
","Let me be clear, despite my slightly positive rating, Resident Evil: Afterlife is in no way a 'good' movie. But it is entertaining, in a ridiculous, inexplicable way.I'm a fan of this series, even though that admission would probably cause some people to doubt any and all of my credibility when it comes to movies. The last three RE flicks were just dumb, fun action movies with zombies, and I could appreciate them for what they were. No, they don't follow the games very closely, and no they weren't scary in the slightest, but I still liked them (to varying degrees). Milla Jovovich is a credible and likable action star and seeing her jumping through the air, kicking and shooting things in the face never really got old, for me. Plus, this series has a habit of including some pretty hot actresses in each installment (including this one), which I heartily approve of. Afterlife, to be quite honest, is a train-wreck. But, it's like a train-wreck where no one gets injured, and the train cars do some crazy flips in slow motion and there are tons of explosions and everyone who happened to see it had a pretty good time watching it. Writer and director Paul W.S. Anderson has completely (and wisely) given up on trying to make these movies make sense in the slightest way, and let all logic fall right off the B- movie cliff. There's just so many cheesy, absurd things going on at any given moment that it's almost an overload. The almost constant slow motion, the AWFUL acting, the absurd dialogue, the concrete-tunneling zombies, the guarantee that exactly every 3 minutes, a zombie or monster was going to magically appear behind a character and kill/almost kill them, the random elements from the games strewn about haphazardly...it's all just so ridiculous.This truly awful movie appealed to me in a perverse way. It certainly didn't bore me, that's for sure. But, you should be very wary if your tolerance (and maybe even fondness?) for a disaster isn't equal to mine. Resident Evil: Afterlife destroys the limits of absurdity like one of Alice's shotguns to the face. And yet, after the extra scene during the credits, I actually felt eager to see the next Resident Evil movie. Maybe I'm the one who's absurd.",6,7,12,3 January 2011
Casablanca," A movie that it's almost impossible not to love.
","'Leave him alone, Miss Ilsa. You're bad luck to him.'There's not much I can say about Casablanca that hasn't already been said countless times in the sixty-eight years since it was released. The story about a chance meeting of former lovers in French Morocco during World War II is as classic as any movie can possibly be. It's endlessly quoted and nearly universally beloved, and my opinion after seeing it doesn't differ from popular opinion. This is a fantastic movie.If not for Grace Kelly, Ingrid Bergman would be my favorite classic actress of all time. Stunningly beautiful and as talented of an actress as there ever was, she's the heart of this movie to me, even more than the central character, played by Humphery Bogart. Casablanca is my introduction to him, and he gives an expert performance of a brooding, bitter man with a past that's covered his true soul with cynicism. His character was layered and complex, and he delivered the amazing dialogue expertly. Paul Henreid and Claude Rains were also excellent in their roles, with special mention going to Dooley Wilson, who has probably the best role of any black actor that I've seen from that film era.You see old movie trailers describing their respective films with bold proclamations of 'Danger!', 'Intrigue!', 'Mystery!', and 'Romance!', and those all are perfect descriptors of Casablanca. It just feels like a film that was made to endure across the ages. The music is brilliant, I've already mentioned the acting, the characters are memorable, and the story hooks you with mystery and delivers an ending that couldn't be more perfect. Seeing Casablanca should be mandatory for every movie fan, it deserves all the critical and fan acclaim and every award it's ever gotten, and more.",9,1,2,6 September 2010
Minority Report," Cruise and Spielberg's first collaboration is a great one.
","'But it didn't fall. You caught it. The fact that you prevented it from happening doesn't change the fact that it was *going* to happen.'This blockbuster collaboration between Tom Cruise and Steven Spielberg just happens to be one of my favorite sci-fi movies, one of my favorite Tom Cruise movies, and one of my favorite Spielberg movies. It's a gritty, exciting thrill ride that excels in special effects and action, but doesn't solely rely on those two elements.In a near-future world where a few select people have the ability to see murders before they happen, three of these 'precogs' have been used by a special government organization known as Precrime to prevent a single murder from happening in Washington D.C. for six years. But, on the eve of the program possibly being expanded nationwide, Precrime officer John Anderton (Tom Cruise) is predicted by the system to murder a man he's never met before in the next few days. Does he allow himself to meekly be captured? Of course not, that wouldn't be much of a movie, would it?The world of Minority Report is futuristic, but still very much grounded in reality and how metropolitan America may well look in forty years. The movie is filmed with a blue filter that makes everything seem very cold and urban, and it suits the tone perfectly. Cruise is great, and wisely leaves most of his charm and boyishness at home under Spielberg's direction. This is a serious and at times quite dark character for him, and he nailed it. Minority Report strikes a great balance between action and story, and while the plot may not ultimately be the most original ever on its most basic level, it's certainly effective and interesting.This is the sci-fi movie that I recommend to people who may not normally be into the genre, because it's sure to entertain, regardless of its classification. If you have even a mild interest in it, don't delay in seeing it.",8,0,1,22 September 2010
Finding Neverland," An imaginative look at how the tale of Peter Pan came to be.
","'Just pretending? You brought pretending into this family, James.'Finding Neverland is a story about the London-based playwright James Barrie, and the special family that inspired him to write his timeless masterpiece, Peter Pan, over the course of a summer. It's a cute and charming movie, but not really the kind that I go for.Johnny Depp stars as Barrie, and gives a solid performance as the imaginative, yet frustrated, playwright. He seems to have wonderful chemistry with the young actors that he shares so many scenes with, and his interactions with his distant wife (Radha Mitchell) are suitably strained. I thought that Winslet was also good in her small role, as the widowed mother who occasionally seems more like a background character, but begins to add more to the movie towards the end.Finding Neverland is a good family film, and people who loved Peter Pan as children (or as adults) will probably love it. I thought it was a solid, it just didn't connect with me as much as I suspect it will with others. Despite the unremarkable rating I gave it, I have no qualms about recommending it to anyone who has an interest.",6,0,0,11 August 2010
Chinatown," Expertly crafted neo noir.
","'I don't want to nail you. I want to find out who put you up to it.'A drought-stricken, late 1930's Los Angeles serves as the backdrop to this neo noir starring Jack Nicholson and Faye Dunaway. What starts out as a seemingly routine job for a private detective of shadowing a cheating spouse, balloons into a murky mystery involving murder, greed, and long-hidden secrets.I had to watch this twice, because the first time I was a bit distracted and didn't get the full experience of the movie. These kinds of films require you to pay as close attention to the details as the detective who's the protagonist of the story, in order to fit all the pieces together. The mystery of what's going on has several layers that are slowly revealed as the story unfolds, Dunaway and Nicholson are brilliant playing off one another, and the ending is truly memorable and perfectly reinforces the theme of the movie. This is a flick that almost any fan of the genre will enjoy.",8,5,10,31 August 2010
Star Trek," I can't help but wish that the re-launch was accompanied by a better story.
","I have a feeling that I'm missing a bit of the intended Star Trek experience, by not watching it on the big screen. It's easy to see how the action sequences and special effects would make a much bigger impression at the theater, and without those to blow the viewer away, the movie has to depend on its less flashy elements. This isn't to the film's advantage. At times it 'feels' like Star Trek, and at times it absolutely doesn't. This is coming from a mild Trek fan, at best. The story didn't do much for me. It's like the writers latched onto the very first semi-decent idea that they had, when it wouldn't have hurt to brainstorm a bit more. Nero seems a lot more like a villain from a forgettable TV episode, than the grand return of the series to the big screen. Most of the cast made little impression on me at all.They certainly won't be replacing the original actors in my mind. This is a decent sci-fi movie with above-average special effects, but that's all.",6,2,6,13 April 2010
Monster," The making of a monster isn't as black and white as you may think.
","'In my life, it's always been the harmless stuff that hurts the most. Whereas the things so horrible you can't even imagine it, is usually a lot easier than you think.'Monster is a dark, unpleasant, ugly movie about one of America's first female serial killers. I don't say those things in a negative manner, because those attributes were intentional, and help tell the story in the realistic way that (writer and director) Patty Jenkins was aiming for. I usually have little interest in movies like this, but there were two reasons why it ended up being somewhat worthwhile for me. First, Jenkins tries to show the circumstances of the life and crimes Aileen Wuornos without condemning or excusing her. She was a woman who had lived a life of horrible events and circumstances, and that context helps the movie be more interesting than your average flick about serial killers. The second reason was the performances of the two lead actresses. Both Christina Ricci and Charlize Theron were amazing, but Theron really gave one of those 'once in a lifetime' performances. She completely disappeared into her character in a way that's incredibly difficult to do for a mega-famous actor or actress. And it took quite a toll on her during filming, which you can see if you check out the special features included with the DVD.As I said, this isn't the kind of movie I usually go for, but it was obvious even to me that Monster is a cut above most movies in the genre. Don't hesitate to check it out if it sounds like something that would interest you, and even if it doesn't, you might want to see it just for the outstanding performances.",6,0,1,8 December 2010
Inglourious Basterds," Glorious, not Inglourious.
","What can I say? This is simply more Tarantino goodness. The story is simple enough and the action isn't overwhelming, so most of my attention was directly on the all-star cast. All that clever dialogue wouldn't be of much use with some capable actors to deliver it. Everyone was good, but clearly Colonel Hans Landa was the overwhelming star of the movie. The film was at its very best every time he was on the screen. It's not an exaggeration to say that he's this year's Joker. There better be some best supporting actor nominations coming for Christopher Waltz. The movie never reached the absurd heights of Kill Bill, but it was much more consistently entertaining than Death Proof. There was never a dull sequence, even with the considerable length. I actually wouldn't have minded a few more scenes of the Basterds' exploits. Thank you Tarantino for once again delivering a great movie that I will be watching for years and years to come.",9,0,5,10 April 2010
Captain Marvel," A basic origin film like this was fine a few years ago, now I need more.
","It's so difficult not to compare Captain Marvel to two other recent movies - Alita: Battle Angel and Wonder Woman. Both of those movies started actresses who did a great job of channeling iconic characters - making the audience root for them and showing what makes those characters special. Captain Marvel is lacking in that area.It's not a bad movie by any means, it's just so unremarkable. It's missing the heart that Wonder Woman and Alita have. Brie Larson (who I know is a good actressss in other movies) is just so blank here. At first I explained that away as a part of the plot, but no she just doesn't give Carol Danvers much of a personality at all. Many comic book fans love these movies because we love these characters, and when it's difficult to invest in the character, it's hard to immerse yourself in the movie.I will say that the special effects were great, but the plot just seemed to exist to get Captain Marvel to the end of the movie with powers in tow, ready to make her debut in Avengers: Endgame. As origin stories go, this one is just average. It went from mediocre to fairly entertaining by the end, but comic book movies have evolved to the point that my expectations for them are much higher.Captain Marvel doesn't fail, but it also does not live up to the tagline of 'Higher, Further, Faster' very well. I'm hoping the character has a better showing the second time around.",6,4,7,14 March 2019
Coraline," A dark fairy tale.
","Coraline is a modern day, adult fairy tale. Neil Gaiman is known for his imaginative, genre-bending tales, and Coraline is no exception. It shifts in tone from whimsical to frightening to somber, but it's all presented in a truly engaging manner. Even if the story wasn't as good as it is, Coraline would be worth seeing for its strikingly beautiful art style and fluid animation. It's different from that used in The Nightmare Before Christmas or Corpse Bride, but it does remind one of them. Kids may like this film for its pretty images, but it lacks the snappy humor and wackiness that many modern fairy tales have. It takes a older child or an adult to appreciate the subtleties, melancholic sensibilities, and depths of Coraline.",8,1,1,1 February 2016
Dawn of the Dead," The way zombie movies should be done.
","I'll always associate the Dawn of the Dead remake with my freshman year in college. Myself and a few of my friends had a great time in the theater watching it, and checking it out again a few years later, it's still a fun time. I credit it and 28 Days Later for really bringing the zombie movie back in an awesome way. Dawn of the Dead does almost everything right. There are some really horrifying events, plenty of scares, a good cast of characters played by capable actors, lots of action, a few moments of levity, and tons of zombie mayhem. It avoids the overwhelming deluge of heavy-handed social commentary that so many zombie movies drown in (Land of the Dead, anyone?), but it's also not just a completely shallow experience. You can't really go wrong with Dawn of the Dead if you're even slightly a fan of the genre. It starts with a bang from the very beginning, and rarely lets up the intensity. See it.",7,3,5,15 March 2011
Iron Man 2," RDJ dons the suit for a successful second go-round.
","'You wanna be a war machine? Take your best shot!'The second movie in superhero franchises often is fantastic. X-Men 2, Spider-Man 2, Batman Returns, and The Dark Knight all managed to improve over their pretty solid predecessors. While Iron Man 2 can't quite join those movies by improving over the excellent Iron Man, it's still an enjoyable movie in it's own right.It may not be quite as consistently entertaining as the first movie, but Iron Man 2 boasts increased star power with the inclusion of Cheadle, Johansson, Rourke, and Rockwell, as well as even more special effects wizardry than its predecessor. The increased focus on the expanded cast  and even more elaborate action scenes comes at the expense of some of the humor and perfect story flow that made the first movie so darn great, but Iron Man fans won't be very disappointed with this new movie, I can guarantee you. Iron Man 2 is flashy, fun, and another fine comic book movie.",6,0,1,28 September 2010
Forgetting Sarah Marshall," A wonderful break-up comedy.
","A HUGE step up from the overrated Knocked Up. These are the kinds of movies that guys and women both can enjoy and laugh their asses off together. Jason Segel, Kristen Bell, Bill Hader, Paul Rudd, Russell Brand...Forgetting Sarah Marshall essentially has my comedy dream team in it.You feel nothing but pity and horror for Jason's character as the movie starts, but he never comes off as so pathetic that you don't root for him. This is one of the more 'realistic' comedies that I've seen, even though there are tons of outlandish scenes. The next time you want to watch a date movie with your significant other, try this for a sure- fire hit. It's flat-out hilarious, and that doesn't change with repeated viewings. Forgetting Sarah Marshall is one of my favorite comedies, ever.",9,0,3,6 April 2010
The Hunger Games," The First Blockbuster of the Year!
","The Hunger Games is as straightforward as book adaptations get. Nearly every scene is taken word from word for the page, and while some things obviously have to be left out in the interest of time, watching the movie is incredibly close to the experience of reading the novel. And in this case that's a very good thing, because The Hunger Games is a great book and makes for a great movie. The tone is spot-on, be it the frivolous, manic environment of the Capitol (the ruling city of the future post-war remains of America and yearly organizer of the Hunger Games), the unflinching poverty of District 12 (home of our main character and several other people important to the overall story), or the brutality of the games themselves. Nothing featuring children killing each other should be easy to watch, and the PG-13 rating doesn't stop several scenes from being wince inducing. The violence is never really glorified or lingered on, but it's there. I loved Jennifer Lawrence as Katniss. Any concerns I had about her being a little older than the character or too 'healthy' looking were quickly forgotten. Katniss is defined by her determination and resourcefulness, and Lawrence nailed that. I also was pleasantly surprised by how well most of rest of the cast embodies their characters, including Josh Hutcherson as Peeta, who actually made me like the character in the movie more than the book. Lenny Kravitz as Cinna, Woody Harrleson as Haymitch, and Wes Bentley as Seneca Crane all help bring the world to life by handling their characters so well. Even the actors playing the other contestants in the games managed to be memorable and show the essence of their characters, no matter how brief their scenes are. If you're a fan of the books, put your worries aside. This is The Hunger Games you know and love on the big screen, and it's done well. If you're new to the franchise, just know you're in for a thrilling, often brutal, and occasionally touching story.",8,4,12,4 April 2012
Shaun of the Dead," Fun with zombies!
","Shaun of the Dead does for zombie movies what Hot Fuzz did for cop films. It wasn't quite as successful at it as the movie that would come afterwords, but it was a fine way for Simon and the gang to hone their craft in preparation for their epic buddy cop spoof.The entertainment value here comes from the humor and the characters, and it succeeds in being better than many of the serious zombie movies that have been released in the last few years. Not much has to be changed in order from zombies to be transformed from horrifying to hilarious.  There's  lots of in-jokes and foreshadowing that makes repeated viewings just as fun as the first. Trust me, watching a zombie being rhythmically beaten to a Queen song never gets old. Plus fans of the UK Office get the pleasure of seeing Lucy Davis (in a hilarious role) and a few other welcome cameos. Add all that to the pleasure of getting to see Simon Pegg being Simon Pegg, and what more could you want? Zombie fans will love this, plain and simple.",7,0,1,13 May 2010
Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Man's Chest," A return to the Caribbean...for better or worse.
","On a technical level, Dead Man's Chest surpasses Curse of the Black Pearl in every way. The special effects are downright amazing. All the various members of The Flying Dutchmen look marvelously creative, the set-pieces are complex and action-packed, and the Kracken is a horrifyingly impressive creation. Yes, Dead Man's Chest isn't lacking in visual wizardry...it's the story and 'fun-factor' that fail to live up to the first Pirates of the Caribbean. Where the original was fun and humorous, the second movie in the series just seems uninspired and too long. You can tell that Pirates 2 was made purely because of the success of the first, and not because the writers had another great story to tell. Without that lynch-pin to hold everything together, Dead Man's Chest feels like an unnecessary cash-in. You should still see it if you liked the first movie, but be prepared to be slightly disappointed. More and bigger does not always equal better.",5,0,0,25 March 2010
Public Enemies," A Greatest Hits version of the life of John Dillinger.
","I really wish Johnny Depp would play 'normal' guys like this more often. His acting talent is more apparent when he's in a role that's not defined by eccentricity. The guy made a fine Dillinger, I must admit. Public Enemies breezes through the more interesting parts of Dillinger's criminal career, without getting bogged down in any origins or psychological justification for his behavior. He was just a man who liked fast money and the things that came along with it. This isn't a historically precise, complex character study, it's just an entertaining romanticization of a very notorious man.Along with Depp, you have a plethora of talent actors and actresses who are either in love with Dillinger, helping him, or trying to bring him down. This is a seriously impressive cast, from headliners like Cotillard and Bale, to small but appreciated cameos from Emilie de Ravin and Carey Mulligan. There's a great actor everywhere you look, in Public Enemies. That's one of the many things to like about the movie. It brings the 'summer blockbuster' feel to a genre that isn't normally associated with that idea, and it does it well.",7,0,1,5 June 2010
Elizabeth," The early years of the Virgin Queen.
","'I am my father's daughter. I am not afraid of anything.'I'll admit that I enjoyed recent historical dramas like The Duchess and The Young Victoria. But sometimes, pardon my language, I want to see a historical drama with some balls. And I don't mean the kind with dancing and fancy dresses. Elizabeth fits that descriptor admirably.The movie opens with a chilling scene precluding the execution of some Protestant rebels, which does an effective job of setting the tone for one of the central conflicts of that time and the move; the conflict between the supporters of the Catholic church and the Protestants (of which Elizabeth was a steadfast member, to the dismay of many).Elizabeth covers the time period stretching from the early dangers she faced at the hands of her suspicious half-sister, Queen Mary I, to the political and personal successes and failures of the early part of her 44 year reign. We watch as she faces rebellion and betrayal, and gradually sheds her inexperience to become a forceful, capable, and independent ruler.  Cate Blanchett is a fantastic actress. That should be a surprise to no one. And she certainly looks the part. She makes for a fine Queen Elizabeth. As for the rest of the cast (sans one person, in particular), I found them all to be suitable. Blanchett is clearly the focus of the movie, though, and the film works because it rests so well on her queenly shoulders. As for the settings, costumes, etc., they're less opulent than those that I've seen in some more recent movies of this type, but they serve their purpose within the story well.  My only real problem with the movie (besides how comically evil some members of the Roman Catholic church were portrayed to be) was Robert Fiennes in the role of Lord Robert. His character seemed like he would be right at home in a bad romance novel, and I found myself rolling my eyes or losing interest nearly every time he was on screen. He was the wrong actor for the part, too much of the movie was unwisely (and unnecessarily) focused on him, and his interactions with Elizabeth were handled atrociously. Those were the only weak scenes in a very strong movie, but they did force me to drop my score. Other than that, though, I highly recommend Elizabeth.",7,1,1,29 July 2010
Prince of Persia: The Sands of Time," You won't be blown away, but you'll probably enjoy yourself a bit.
","'But perhaps there was something else at work that day, something beyond simple understanding. The day a boy from the unlikeliest of places became a prince of Persia.'When a video game movie meets a big summer event movie, it's not unreasonable to expect a disaster to result. Prince of Persia isn't a disaster, thankfully, but it also doesn't go beyond disposable entertainment. I won't go much into the plot, because there's not much of a plot to go into. Dastan (Jake Gyllenhaal) was a lowly street urchin who was adopted into the royal family of Persia as a child after performing a heroic deed before the king. After he's framed for the death of his adopted father, he goes on the run with a princess of a conquered city to keep a magical dagger out of the hands of those who set him up. Along the way, there's ostrich racing. sword fights, and lots and lots of sand.Prince of Persia is at its best during the numerous fun action sequences, which include lots of the impressive feats of free running, climbing, and acrobatics that make the games so popular. It never quite achieves the sense of epicness that it occasionally reaches for, and there's really no memorable parts that stick out after the movie is done. Which means no real reason to watch it again after the first viewing. As for the cast, I thought they were okay. This wasn't a movie that was exactly demanding when it came to acting, but everyone did what they could with the merely adequate writing. The special effects were decent, the sand-swept vistas were eye- catching, and there weren't any huge flaws to point out...but there wasn't anything that the movie did particularly well, either. Prince of Persia is worth watching one time if you just want some mindless entertainment for a few hours, but don't expect the charm and excitement of the first Pirates of the Caribbean movie (which Bruckheimer was obviously going for).",6,0,1,14 September 2010
The Secret in Their Eyes," A well-made and involving mystery flick.
","'If that's what happened...why didn't you take me with you?'The Secret in Their Eyes is a thoughtful, layered mystery/drama from Argentina. The story is split between two time periods: the investigation by the three main characters of the rape and murder of a young woman in 1974, and the reunion of two of those characters in 1999. Benjamin (Ricardo Darin) is writing a novel about the 25 year-old case that ended with an unfavorable outcome , and in the course of recounting what happened, we learn about the past events and the rather complicated past that Benjamin had with his superior, Irena (Soledad Villamil).What makes the movie so interesting is the relationships between the characters. Ricardo Darin, Guillermo Francella, and Soledad Villamil are all wonderful in their roles, and the camaraderie the two men and the chemistry between Darin and Francella makes what happens to the characters feel very involving and real.This really is a movie that has a little something for everyone. The unfolding mystery of what happened 25 years ago and the events that are revealed in 1999 are interesting and ultimately satisfying, and so is the understated relationship between the male and female leads. It's hard to imagine anyone not liking this, unless they just have a negative opinion of subtitles.",8,2,4,22 September 2010
Pirate Radio," Rock & Roll, out at sea.
","Pirate Radio (or The Boat That Rocked, or whatever name you want to use) definitely has a Cameron Crowe-type feel to it. It's not a clone of any of his movies, but it shares the elements of surrogate families, people being united by music, and coming-of-age stories. I was a little confused about how the focus shifted from a character, to more of an ensemble piece, by the end of the movie. It made the narrative seem a little disjointed. A quick look at the cast lets you know that the acting probably won't be a disappointment, and it wasn't. Philip Seymour Hoffman and Bill Nighy were as excellent as the world has come to expect them to be, while Nick Frost nearly stole the movie every moment he was on film. There were several very beautiful actresses who made the best of some rather smallish roles, including January Jones, Gemma Arterton, and Talulah Riley. That's a lot of bang for your buck. The first three-fourths of the movie are good (not great), but the last quarter was a little of a disappointment, for me. The tone of the story changed drastically, and not for the better. Still, it was a good (if by-the-numbers) movie.",6,1,2,17 April 2010
Hot Fuzz," An action/comedy gem from the other side of the pond.
","'Come on, Sergeant, you've got to accept that it was just another nasty accident.'Absolutely hilarious. Every time I see this movie, I end up enjoying it even more. It simply doesn't get old, the jokes are razor sharp, and yes, it's even better than Shaun of the Dead. Seriously, I like this movie so much that I start grinning like a kid on Christmas morning if anyone even casually mentions it.  Simon Pegg stars as Nicholas Angel, a super cop from London who is transferred to the idyllic small town Sandford, because quite frankly, he's making all the other officers look bad. The town initially appears to be just as safe and peaceful as its residents insist, but ,of course, there's a sinister secret behind the friendly facade. That's really all you need to know about the plot. Just trust me, it's great.    Hot Fuzz has a supremely clever script, and the jokes never fall flat. If you're familiar with movies like Point Break, Bad Boys, the various references to those movies and others will have you giddy. But Hot Fuzz is an incredibly entertaining tongue-in-cheek cop flick, even if you've never seen any of the movies it pays homage to. I've already mentioned how funny it is, and the epic and ridiculously amazing action scenes are just brilliant. Nick Frost, Bill Nighy, Timothy Dalton, Lucy Punch, and a host of other hilarious Brits join in on the fun and carnage, and the whole movie is just delightfully awesome. See it, prepare to love it, and prepare to have no doubts that Simon Pegg and director Edgar Wright are geniuses.",8,1,2,12 August 2010
The Others," A personal favorite. Supernatural drama/horror done right.
","'We must all learn to live together...the living and the dead.'I remember first seeing this back in high school, and I'm still almost as impressed with it today as I was back then. It came out at a time when there hadn't been many other movies quite like it, and it goes way beyond the average horror movie in both concept and polish. The Others doesn't rely on constant jump scares, buckets of gore, or violence. Its originality, understated performances, and focus on atmosphere are the reasons why I enjoy it so much. Every character is ominous and unsettling in their own way, and every event has a hidden meaning. Those are also the reasons why it still holds up so well, when many other supernatural movies lose their luster after the first viewing.  The plot is as novel as modern ghost stories come. There's several very creepy moments, and they're thankfully explained by the revelations of the movie, instead of eliminated by them. This is my favorite Nicole Kidman movie, and one of my favorite supernatural movies, period. It makes me wish that period ghost movies were made more often, they're a nice change of pace from those set in modern times.",9,0,2,18 July 2010
Troy," The Director's Cut is a definite improvement.
","(This is a review of the Director's Cut of Troy, which is significantly longer, more brutal, and better overall than the theatrical version. There's more time for character development and the battles are much more intense. It's definitely the version to watch.)Troy plays fast and loose with history and Greek Mythology, but it ends up being a pretty entertaining movie, as a result. And really, isn't that the point? Yes, Brad Pitt as Achilles and Orlando Bloom as Paris are direct and blatant ploys to get butts in theater seats, but they're certainly not bad. The hodgepodge of accents can be a distraction, but the cast is likable (Sean Bean as Odysseus was a favorite of mine) and there are equal parts drama and epic battles to keep a wide audience satisfied. Lots of blood, noble, lusty heroes, beautiful women, and a pretty spectacular take on the ultimate fall of Troy. This movie doesn't quite reach the heights of the best movies in the genre, but it mostly achieves what it sets out to do: put a fresh take on one of the oldest and most famous stories of war.",7,0,0,23 April 2011
Orphan," Starts off well, falters spectacularly at the end.
","'I don't think Mommy likes me very much.'I know the 'evil child' movie has been done to death, but that doesn't mean that another one worth watching doesn't come along on occasion. I thought Orphan was going to to be one of those worthwhile flicks...until the last act. A family with a troubled past that's only recently managed to move past a tragic miscarriage decides to welcome a new child named Esther into their home. Esther initially seems like a bright, lovely nine-year-old, but soon troubling events make the mother (Vera Farmiga) and Esther's two new siblings suspicious of the girl. And for good reason. Esther has plans for her new family, and deadly things happen when her plans are threatened. Isabelle Fuhrman is perfect as Esther, whether she's being adorably charming, or completely sociopathic. This kind of movie succeeds or fails based on whether the characters involved draw you into the story, or make you laugh at the absurdity of the premise. Largely because of young Isabella, Orphan fell into the later category for me. Up until the ending, that is. I'll be honest, I though the finale was outright terrible. The word 'inexplicable' comes to mind. It really hurt a movie that up to that point was fairly good. I guess the silly twist was made in order to make Orphan more believable, but it achieved the exact opposite effect.  It's not really a horror movie, so don't expect lots of chills. But as a pretty dark thriller, Orphan works for its first hundred minutes. The twisty (and unnecessary) shenanigans near the end, though, hurt the movie a lot. It's been a while since my opinion of a film nosedived so quickly while I was watching it. Disappointing.",4,3,6,29 March 2011
500 Days of Summer," One of my favorite recent movies.
","'You weren't wrong, Tom. You were just wrong about me.'I find myself having to revisit my original review and bump the score up, because this movie gets better every single time I see it.(500) Days of Summer is very unconventional, but in this case, unconventional is a welcome change. The whole relationship genre seems to suffer from being too dour (Two Lovers), too formulaic (a bazillion movies starring Katherine Heigl and her kind), or simply too saccharine for anyone with a Y-chromosome. Just for avoiding those pits, (500) Days of Summer deserves some kind of special award at the Oscars. Zooey Deschanel is great, of course. This role is similar to those she's had in movies and shows like Gigantic and Weeds, but that's just because she's so believable as this kind of character. Joseph isn't really stretching outside his comfort range, either, but once you've seen this, you won't be able to imagine anyone else in his place. The movie itself is a mixture of unnervingly genuine moments and fanciful flourishes. The narrator (don't you love narrators in movies?) tells you what you're in for within the first five minutes of the movie, and you'd be wise to believe him. It's not that you're not going to get a happy ending, it's just that this movie is similar to life; the happy ending you get may not be the one you were looking for.",9,0,0,28 August 2010
Juno," A good movie, but the dialogue may be a deal-breaker for some.
","Juno is just fun, and a pleasure to watch. It's not going to change anyone's life or make a big, important statement, but I haven't seen many movies that are more enjoyable. It's pure charm through and through.Sure, the dialogue is a little over-the-top at times, but this isn't a documentary. Once you get used to it, it starts to feel right to hear these characters talking this way. Like it's a necessary part of this quirky world that Diablo Cody has created.This has to be the most twee story about teen pregnancy ever written, and you won't enjoy the movie if you cannot accept that fundamental fact. Juno requires a healthy amount of off-beat sensibilities from its viewers, and in return, it will charm the pants right off of you. Seems like a fair bargain, to me.",8,3,7,8 April 2010
Pirates of the Caribbean: At World's End," Better than the second, but still not as good as the first.
","The Pirates of the Caribbean franchise has come a long way from the romanticized, light- hearted Johnny Depp romp that was Curse of the Black Pearl. Dead Man's Chest was buried under it's own mythology and ambition. Not to mention the fact that the first movie wasn't made to be easily sequelized. But At World's End corrects a few of the second movies mistakes, and is a better movie as a result. The first half was a nonsensical mess, and really had me wondering if this was just going to be three more hours of an empty plot that served only to carry the viewer from mindless action scene to mindless action scene. But the last hour and a half grabbed my attention again, and I actually ended up liking the way that the story ended. Sure the action scenes are still too long and the story was as disposable as they come, but I still ended up having fun watching the movie. It's nice to finally have an end to the stories of Will and Elisabeth (though I will miss Keira's gorgeous face, I admit), because the best hope of the next movie being good is to have Jack Sparrow as the main focus, without all the story baggage of Pirates 1-3.Anyway, At World's End left me hopefully for the future of the franchise, which is more than I expected from it. It's not quite as good as Curse of the Black Pearl, but it easily surpasses Dead Man's Chest.",6,1,1,6 May 2010
X-Men," A good introduction to the Marvel Universe.
","Batman, Superman, and several other comic book icons had been coming to the big screen for years, but none of those movies really required the sheer ambition that was necessary to bring such a beloved and complicated, ensemble style book like X-Men to film. I don't think that X-Men was quite as good as the first Spider-Man or Batman movies, but it succeeded admirably in putting together the world and characters necessary for it's sequel, X2, to be such a great movie. I think that Bryan Singer and the producers made a lot of good decisions with this movie. Focusing the story on the relationship between Wolverine and Rogue was smart, as were most of the casting decisions. The film adaptations of the various characters and their powers were not perfect, but they certainly could have been worse. The special effects were great for their time, too.For all those things that it does right, though, I still consider it to be only slightly above average. Maybe the reason that I don't love the move more, is because I've seen it so many times that it has little left to offer me. I don't ever remember thinking it was amazing though, even when it was new. X-Men is a decent comic book flick, but it pales in comparison to its much better sequel.",6,0,0,18 April 2010
Midnight in Paris," Woody Allen adds a rather unique (and very good) movie to his filmography.
","'And actually, Paris is the most beautiful in the rain.'Probably the most charming and fanciful Woody Allen movies that I've seen, and also one of the most enjoyable. Owen Wilson is great as a proxy Allen, transported back to the streets of 1920's Paris and looking for his 'Golden Age' amongst the famous writers and artists that wafted through the city at that time. I really don't have any criticisms about the movie. The script is trademark Woody Allen, full of musings about life and happiness, but it's more subtle and natural than his dialogue can often be. The cast is great (Corey Stoll as Earnest Hemingway and Adrien Brody as Salavador Dali being two of the most memorable examples), and Paris looks so beautiful that it often can distract from what's going on with the characters. Fully recommended for Woody fans, Wilson fans, romantics at heart, and those who love Paris (both past and present).",8,3,5,16 January 2012
Zodiac," Could be a bit shorter, but no other real complaints.
","Out of the countless serial killer thrillers, Zodiac is fairly unique. Both because it's based on a true story, and because one of the primary characters is a civilian. It's not too often that you see a cartoonist doggedly chasing down leads and sleuthing like a hardcore gumshoe.What we have seen before, is a story of obsession over catching a criminal, and the impact it has families and careers. That's Zodiac in a nutshell. And as the actual crime is still an open case, in a lot of ways the film lives and dies by how well it portrays those relationships. Thankfully, I found all that interesting. If I have to nitpick, I'll say that the running time could have been a bit shorter, and Jake Gyllenhal may not have been a perfect fit or his role. He grew on me as the movie went on, but I can think of five people off the top of my head who would have really nailed that character.Anyway, this is a pretty good movie. Don't expect anything like Se7en or The Silence of the Lambs, but it is thrilling and involving in its own way.",7,0,0,15 May 2010
The Prestige," Nolan's masterpiece!
","Wow, I didn't see this one coming. It's been quite a while since I've been surprised by the quality of a movie like this. It kept me guessing and engrossed from beginning to end. The way that the narrative shifts back and forwards in time can be a little hard to follow on the initial viewing, but that's the only possible negative that I could ever think of, for The Prestige.There have been many comparisons made between The Illusionist and The Prestige, and understandably so. They were released not very far apart. They both deal with magicians, and pushing the boundaries of what is considered illusion and what is considered real. Both of them have solid casts (though the absurdly excellent actors in The Prestige could easily be described by a stronger word than 'solid'), captivating stories, and twisting plots. But, while The Illusionist is merely great, this movie is basically flawless in my eyes.Â The story got better and better and better as it went on, topping itself again and again. The movie keeps improving with repeated viewings, as well. You'll pick up on clues that you probably completely missed the first time around. Needless to say, I was blown away by the ending. It bears repeating that at the actors and actresses are marvelous. I'm gushing, I know. You get it by now, I love this movie. Even after a few years and several viewings, I still enjoy every moment of it.I LOVE THE PRESTIGE!",10,2,5,12 April 2010
Cloverfield," A return of the monster flick.
","'IT'S A LION! IT'S HUGE!'OK, that's not a real quote from the movie. But that meme (and its endless derivations) are a testament to how excellent the viral campaign for Cloverfield was. The initial trailer for the movie was one of the best I've ever seen, and it had me and countless others scouring the trailer and the Internet for any clue to what this movie was going to be about.Once it finally arrived, I have to say that it mostly lived up to all the hype and anticipation. It's basically a monster movie about a group of people who get caught in Manhattan as a huge, powerful creature lays waste to the city. They have to venture across the island to find and rescue a friend of theirs, before attempting to make their escape. It goes without saying that they encounter a lot of danger along the way, including some smaller creatures that seem to fall from the larger beast. The entire movie is filmed from the viewpoint of a camcorder (which apparently caused motion sickness for some viewers), and as a result it's about as realistic as this kind of a movie can be. (I'd also trek across a war zone to get to someone who looks like Odette Yustman, so that's pretty realistic, as well.) The special effects were solid, there's a lot of genuine tension, and all the actors and actresses were authentic enough to pull of the realism that the movie was shooting for (the guy playing Hud was incredibly annoying, though). The monster is seen only in half- glimpses for the majority of the movie (smart), destroyed NY looks amazing, and it's not hard to suspend your sense of disbelief and get drawn into what's happening to the characters. It does strain credibility that this particular group of people encounters the monster so many times, but that's a small niggle. As is the fact that it doesn't hold up quote as well after multiple viewings. If you don't like this movie, this genre just doesn't appeal to you. I just hope you're not susceptible to motion sickness.",7,0,1,24 June 2010
Sleepy Hollow," Burton Hollow
","It's a tricky thing, updating these old, well-known stories for a modern audience. Stray too far from the source material, and you lose a lot of the spirit of the original work. Don't change things enough, and...well, you probably won't make very much money. Which brings us to Sleepy Hollow. A very well-known, American story. How does it fare?Well, it gets Burton-ized. Tim Burton leaves his fingerprints more heavily on some movies than others, and Sleepy Hollow is one of those movies. It only resembles the original story in name, location, and villain, and the rest is heavily influenced by...whatever the rest of Burton's work is influenced by. If you like that idea, then you'll like this movie. If you're tired of his visual style and cinematic signature, then Sleepy Hollow won't change your mind. I didn't feel like the tone really fit what Sleepy Hollow 'should be', but that's just the result of a preference on my part, not necessarily a flaw. I can appreciate what Burton did in updating the tale of Ichobod Crane and the Headless Horsemen, but it didn't connect with me as well as I hoped. I was expecting more of a horror movie, and Sleepy Hollow isn't frightening in the least. Still, it's not bad.",6,0,1,22 May 2010
Silent Hill," At the top of the video game adaptation genre.
","'Congratulations, Rose. You're here. You did it. Your reward is the truth.' It's not often that video game movies succeed in being entertaining while also keeping in the spirit of what made that particular game successful in the first place, but Silent Hill pulls it off as well as any other attempt that I've seen. It works not only as a game adaptation, but as a horror movie, as well.I remember seeing it in the theater with a rather large group of friends, and we all (and most of the audience) were pretty freaked out by it. It's not nearly as frightening after repeated viewings, but the spooky atmosphere and perverse creatures remain effective. It certainly helps to know about the mythology of the town and the characters, but not exactly necessary. You'll still get most of what the movie is about. The pacing is deliberately slow at times, because like the games, the focus is on building almost unbearable atmospheric tension (aided by fantastic music lifted directly from the games). This goes hand in hand with the surreal, terrifying sets and the oppressive darkness that falls upon the town when the nightmare creatures appear. You may find yourself cringing every time you hear the sirens (like I did), wary of what kind of horror Rose (played by the gorgeous Radha Mitchell) is about to have to face next. On the negative side, the script is incredibly clunky, at times. Stilted and obvious dialogue occasionally draws the viewer out of the movie, and a bit more subtlety would also have been welcome. The villains really are almost comically evil. It's hard to imagine that even they believe that what they're doing isn't horrible.Silent Hill is a gory, intense, nightmare of a movie. Just as a film adaptation of this property should be. It's proof that good results can occur when a video game is treated as more than just an easy cash-grab and is adapted competently.",7,0,0,29 June 2010
Snatch," Excellent British caper flick.
","'I fail to recognize the correlation between losing ten grand, hospitalizing Gorgeous, and a good deal.'I'm quite fond of these British crime movies, and Snatch is no exception. It's got a great cast and an interesting story just like Layer Cake and RocknRolla, but what separates it from those movies is how unrelentingly funny it is. I'd say it's probably the most hilarious movies that I've seen in a while. Nearly every line of dialogue gets laughs.The story involves a VERY large diamond, unlicensed boxing, replica guns, gypsies, caravans, and a pig farm. Trust me, it's great.Out of all the characters in the movie (and there are a lot), I'd have to say Brad Pitt as Mickey and Alan Ford as Brick Top are the two that absolutely stole the show. This is my personal favorite Pitt performance and character, its just brilliant. Snatch would be worth watching for those two alone, even if the rest of it wasn't so good. But the rest of it is so good, so take this as a recommendation and check this movie out.",8,0,2,11 September 2010
Pan's Labyrinth," Inventive and beautiful.
","'You are not born of man. It was the moon that bore you.'Pan's Labyrinth is a beautiful movie. It's also brutal, unique, harsh, and powerful. I can't easily recall a film that interweaves magical wonder and sinister violence in such a seamless way. I hate to simply repeat the well-worn description of the movie as a fairy tale for adults, but that's exactly what it is. We may see the movie through the eyes of a child, but she's living in a world where even fantasy is tinged with the terrible influence of reality. We wonder at every fantastical thing that young Ofelia encounters on her quest to return back to where she's been told she belongs, because even those that seem to be trying to help her have an air of danger that we've been trained to sanitize from anything a child might encounter. You never really know if Ofelia is more threatened by the alien and unfamiliar dangers of the night that are brought to her by the questionable satyr, or the all-too-human and familiar dangerous of the day and her  war-torn country. Creature and set design is a definite strength of del Toro. Unlike in Hellboy, where the striking visuals were wasted on a story that wasn't worthy of them, Pan's Labyrinth provides a strong fabric to support the beautiful creatures and sets that move the plot forward. There are entire stories hinted at by the lair of the Pale Man and the ancient labyrinth with its faun-shaped entrance. So much imagination and creativity went into this movie, that it would be worth seeing for those things alone.There's a lot about Pan's Labyrinth that I haven't gone into, because it's best to watch it with as little knowledge about it as possible, as I did. Rest assured that it's a very good movie, and you'll be filled with nothing but admiration for Guillermo del Toro by the end. I can't wait to see it again.",8,1,7,13 July 2010
Final Destination 2," Ever seem someone crushed under a pane of glass? Would you like to?
","'That's why death is working backwards. It's tying up all the loose ends. Sealing the rift once and for all.'Yep, when a movie has dialogue that silly, you expect it to be pretty ridiculous. And that's exactly what Final Destination 2 is. It's even more over-the-top than the original movie was. A new group of people once again escape death in a huge accident, only to face further absurdly elaborate attempts on their lives. The death scenarios were all pretty entertaining, and if you weren't tired of the formula after the first movie, you'll probably enjoy the escalated efforts of this second installment. It's literally just more of the same, but guessing how each person is going to die is the kind of light entertainment that just doesn't get old, for me.",6,0,1,7 August 2010
The Way Back," A walk to remember.
","The Way Back is a drama about a group of prisoners and a teenage girl seeking to escape the reach of the communists in 1941. Loosely based on a true story, the movie follows the group from their escape from a Soviet gulag in Siberia, through the Gobi Desert and across the Himalayas...all on foot. It's was an incredibly perilous journey, and many of the characters do not make it to the end. Hunger, exposure, exhaustion, and dehydration were the almost constant companions of the group, and they took their toll. The great cast (including Colin Farrell, Ed Harris, Saoirse Ronan, and Mark Strong) really makes you care about the slowly bonding group as they travel mile after mile through harsh conditions and dangerous environments. The Way Back may not have the thrills of an action blockbuster, but it kept my interest throughout. A good movie about a very interesting subject.",7,1,2,14 May 2011
Megamind," Okay, but doesn't really stand out in a crowded genre.
","'Sorry! Sorry. He's just not used to positive feedback.'Megamind is a mixed bag in almost every way. The idea of a super-villain turned superhero would have been novel, if the superior and similar Despicable Me wouldn't have been released around the same. The movie tries it's best with abundant slapstick humor, but it's only sporadically funny. Some of the character designs are great (say what you will, but Roxanne is one hot computer animated character), but others are lane and not memorable (Titan, or 'Tighten', I'm looking squarely at you). The settings and background as a whole are clean, bright, and colorful, but also very generic and uninteresting. The voice cast is full of big names, but they get very little opportunity to shine. Megamind is by no means a bad movie, but with how competitive the genre of family computer animated movies has gotten in the last few years, it doesn't do nearly enough to stand out. It was decent enough to give a rental and I quite enjoyed some parts of it, but seeing it once will probably be enough for most people over the age of seven or eight.",Null,0,1,14 July 2011
Horrible Bosses," And you thought your boss was bad.
","Horrible Bosses is one of the funniest movies I've seen this year, but it's also one of the most frustrating.The story is pretty simple. It's about three friends (Jason Bateman, Charlie Day and Jason Sudeikis) who have three different bosses (Colin Farrell, Jennifer Aniston and Kevin Spacey) who are making their lives a living hell in different ways. It gets to the point where the three guys get so frustrated that they decided to try to find a hit-man to off their superiors. That's when the shenanigans start. When Horrible Bosses focuses on the trio of bosses, it's absolutely hilarious. All three of then steal the show in their own ways, be it Spacey's pure evil, Farrell's childishness and coke-fueled hedonism, or Aniston's super-charged sexual harassment (Charlie Day gets no sympathy from me). Their part in all of this is relatively small, though, with most of the time spent on the three main guys deciding to go through with their plan and doing 'recon'. And without the bosses involved there are long stretches of jokes that fail, are recycled from other movies, or just go on too long. Bateman, Sudeikis and Day are funny, but they're just playing slight variations of characters they do so often, and they don't get most of the funniest lines. Don't get me wrong, I really liked Horrible Bosses. It just had the potential to be even better if the three funniest people in it (Spacey, Farrell and Aniston) would have been given more time to shine. Still, good movie.",7,2,4,18 October 2011
The Town," Affleck returns to Boston with positive results.
","'So I came here, and I put him in the f*cking ground. Did nine years for it. Now, you don't gotta thank me...but you're not walking away.'The Town is a heist thriller in the vein of Heat, in the sense that the movie is more about the personal lives of the criminals, and not the heists, themselves. There's plenty of action and conflict, but describing it as only an action movie would be overlooking a lot of The Town's depth. This is another solid directing job by Ben Affleck, even though I didn't enjoy it quite as much as Gone, Baby, Gone. It's set in the streets of the various Boston neighborhoods that he knows best, and there's an unmistakable authenticity to the settings and characters.What could have been a fairly typical cat and mouse tale between cops and robbers is elevated by the excellent cast, that includes a fine performance from Affleck himself, as well as Rebecca Hall, Jon Hamm, Jeremy Renner, and others. Interactions between the characters ring true, and their relationships feel complex and genuine as they push the story forward. I didn't find any particular aspect of The Town to be spectacular, but it's consistently solid and entertaining, as a whole. It's good to see Ben Affleck continuing the career resurgence that he's had in the last few years.",7,0,1,10 January 2011
Taxi Driver," Scorsese's masterpiece.
","'Loneliness has followed me my whole life, everywhere. In bars, in cars, sidewalks, stores, everywhere. There's no escape. I'm God's lonely man.'Taxi Driver is a perfect example of the novel-like quality that differentiates a Scorsese movie from those done by many other directors. Martin takes a page out of Woody Allen's book and makes the city of New York just as much a character in the film as De Niro or Shepherd. And against that living backdrop, he tells a story of with all the rage and violence of Raging Bull,  coupled with a profound loneliness and a unique (almost wistful) style that I've yet to find replicated in any of his other work.Taxi Driver is my favorite Scorsese movie. It also features my favorite Robert De Niro performance. It's the kind of film that's capable of imparting the feeling of a time and a place to people who weren't even alive back in 70's New York to feel it for themselves. This movie is made to be watched again and again, and don't be surprised if it improves every time. If I could choose any single one of Scorsese's movies to recommend to someone who is unfamiliar with him, I'd go with Taxi Driver. That says it all.",8,0,0,27 July 2010
Shutter Island," I can't believe that Scorsese and DiCaprio gave this their best effort.
","I was relatively disappointed in Shutter Island, and that absolutely shocks me. Disappointment is not a word that I ever thought I'd use to describe a Scorsese and DiCaprio collaboration.The actual movie never delivered on the thrilling trailer. It wasn't what I was expecting, which isn't the problem. It was a much more psychological and cerebral movie than I thought it would be, but once again, that's not the problem. The problem was that I didn't find it to be particularly compelling. The story is relatively well told...it's just not a story that I could muster much interest in as I was watching.As for the cast, we have a absurdly talented group of actors and actresses, who all give serviceable efforts. Nothing really to complain about, but nothing particularly noteworthy, either (though I thought Emily Mortimer was great in her short amount of screen time).Shutter Island is a case of my expectations being much too high for the movie to live up to. It's not bad by any means, but I'm accustomed to excellence from those involved...not mere competence. Shutter Island felt like it could have been made by any of a dozen directors, and that's not an attribute of a great Scorsese movie.",6,1,3,9 June 2010
Tangled," Meet the new and improved Rapunzel.
","'I, am a horrible daughter. I'm going back. I am never going back! I am a despicable human being. Woo-hoo! Best. Day. Ever!'Tangled is a charming, amusing, visually beautiful movie that will please princess-obsessed little girls, adventure loving little boys, and the older people that are bound to have this movie memorized by osmosis from the countless times the young ones around them will probably watch it. This modern update of the Rapunzel fairy tale gives a family friendly message about growing up and becoming your own person, wrapped up in the cute animal sidekicks and hijinks that are expected from these kinds of movies. The animation is bright, vivid, and lively, the voice work is good, and the songs are passable, if not great. There's just not a lot to complain about, here. I didn't think it was as hilarious as Despicable Me or as emotionally engaging as Toy Story 3, but there's just something special about a good old fashioned fairy tale, now and again.",7,2,5,30 March 2011
Star Wars: Episode II - Attack of the Clones," Is Episode II worth the Star Wars name?
","'I've been dying a little bit each day since you came back into my life.'Both of the first two Star Wars prequels have substantial flaws that zealously try to ruin the un-ruinable, the mighty Star Wars franchise. In Episode I, it was the complete overkill in trying to make the movie appealing to young kids, personified by the much (and deservedly) maligned Jar Jar Binks. There's much less Jar Jar in Episode II, but its biggest flaw is almost as bad: the awful way the blossoming romance between now-Senator Padmé Amidala (Natalie Portman) and the teenage Anakin Skywalker (Hayden Christensen) is depicted. Christensen isn't a brilliant actor in the best of circumstances, and whether he makes a suitable Anakin is up for debate. But pairing him with George Lucas's hokey attempts at writing romantic dialogue is just painful. The movie seriously drags when it focuses on the relationship between Anakin and Padmé. But, like Episode I, Episode II somehow manages to overcome its flaws to be a decent entry into the Star Wars canon. The visuals received an impressive upgrade over the first movie (and I don't only mean Portman's increasingly sexy costumes), and there are many breathtaking action scenes and special effects sequences. The story takes the characters to new worlds and involves more mystery and intrigue than the first movie. You get to see multiple Jedi in action in large-scale battles, and who hasn't wanted to see that? Natalie Portman and Ewan McGregor seem much more comfortable and natural in their roles, despite the absurdly cheesy things the script often forces Portman to say. Is Episode II an improvement over Episode I? Yes. Is it as good as Episodes III, IV, V, and VI? Nope. Poor writing keeps Attack of the Clones from reaching its full potential.",Null,4,8,27 September 2011
Corpse Bride," Burton returns to what he does best.
","'Oh, don't be ridiculous. What corpse would marry our Victor?'The story of the Corpse Bride is very simple. A young man accidentally practices his vows on the eve of his wedding in the presence of a woman who died a tragic death, and finds himself in the land of the dead, married to her in truth. Does he return to the land above to marry his betrothed, or does he remain with his corpse bride?I'd be perfectly content if Tim Burton would stick to his original creations, and stopped adapting other people's work.  Especially if it lead to more stop-motion movies like this one. Burton's obsession with deathly pale characters with sunken eyes and Victorian clothing is much more charming in animation, than it is in his live-action movies.I know that making a movie of any kind is labor-intensive and time-consuming, but it's rarely as evident as it is in stop-motion movies. The obvious comparison to Corpse Bride is The Nightmare before Christmas. The former isn't quite as clever as the latter, but it's nearly as artistically pleasant. The character designs are good, the sets are impressive, and the painstaking attention to detail is astounding. Other than some underwhelming songs, I enjoyed every bit of Corpse Bride. It's a dark, fantasy tale that has all the humor, star power, and whimsy that a child or adult could want from an animated movie.",6,1,3,26 June 2010
Forrest Gump," One of the best films of the 90's.
","'Mama always said that dyin' was a part of life. I sure wish it wasn't.'No matter what Tom Hanks does for the rest of his career, to me, he'll always be Forrest Gump. I mean that as a compliment. His role here was one of the best and most memorable that I've ever seen in a movie. I can't imagine another actor who could have played this character, and played him so well.Forrest's story will take you all across America, and beyond. You get to see a large part of recent American history through his eyes. It's extremely clever the way that Forrest's presence is weaved throughout so many iconic events and places. The man meets Presidents, inspires kings (of music), and lives the kind of life that most people would never even dream of. And he takes everyone watching along with him. Forrest Gump is so beloved, because it's so charming and heartbreaking and genuine. Even when it's at its most sentimental or sugary sweet, it's grounded in the kind of genuine human emotion that makes great movie experiences. You'll laugh and fight back tears, but you'll also think. This is one of the few movies that everyone should see, and that almost everyone will like. It's a classic in every sense of the word.",9,9,11,29 June 2010
Gone Baby Gone," Often, doing the right thing isn't so simple.
","'I will hate you for doing this, and I don't want to.'There have been a lot of solid movies set in Boston in recent years, but Gone Baby Gone tops even The Departed and Mystic River, as good as they both were. What starts off as a story about a missing child evolves into one of the most thought provoking and genuinely compelling movies that I've seen.Ben Affleck has real talent as a director, and did an excellent job of maintaining the authenticity of both the story of the Dennis Lehane novel and the neighborhood that it's set in. Casey Affleck, Michelle Monaghan, Ed Harris, Morgan Freeman, and Amy Ryan were all perfectly cast, and give stellar performances.Gone Baby Gone is just one of those movies that it's hard to find a flaw with. It's expertly made, sticks with you, and doesn't offer any easy answers. Highly recommended.",8,9,13,17 August 2010
Captain America: The First Avenger," A hero for the past and present.
","What I like about Marvel's superhero movies is that they all have a unique tone and feel. Where something like Green Lantern (I can't help but compare the two movies since I've watched them only a day apart), despite it's extraterrestrial scope, it feels so generic. It doesn't play up its strengths or use its unique mythos to its advantage. On the other hand, the Iron Man, Thor and Captain America (and to use a DC example, Batman) movies feel completely different from each other. And that's a good thing, because with the many superheroes crowding the big screen these days, they have to have something to offer to make them worth the time and money. Captain America succeeds by taking Steve Rogers' hero origins during World War II and making it the backbone of the movie. Time is taken to establish the time period and characters, and the settings and costumes are all excellent. I liked Chris Evans as Johnny Storm in the Fantastic Four movies, but I like him even better, here. He really brings Steve Rogers to life as a character, instead of just being Chris Evans in a Captain America uniform. The whole cast is great, actually, with Hugo Weaving (he's always great, isn't he?) deserving special mention as the primary villain, the Red Skull. Captain America has nice action, excellent WW2-era trappings, and is a undeniably a fun superhero flick.",Null,5,9,29 October 2011
Fargo," Outstanding!
","Wow, wow, wow! Fargo was simply a pleasure to watch! I feel like I'm gushing, but this one is totally deserving. There are clear similarities between Fargo and No Country for Old Men. Both movies deal with the results when average people get mixed up with unfathomable evil and violence. And all for just a bit of money. The Coen Brothers have created a movie that's strong from beginning to end. I really can't think of a single thing about the movie that I would change. I loved the ending. The music was top notch. The setting was perfection from the accents to the scenery. Every actor fit their role like a glove (Marge has to be one of my favorite characters in a movie, ever). There was just the right balance between the light and dark elements of the film. I absolutely loved it all!",10,0,0,10 April 2010
Léon: The Professional," A great action movie with a heart.
","Deliriously corrupt DEA agents, a murderously vengeful 12 year-old kid who's fond of smoking, and a coldly-efficient killer who has more of a heart than he would like to think. These are the ingredients of Léon: The Professional, and they combine to make quite the tasty dish.This is definitely an action movie, but it's the non-action parts that make it so memorable. Most of them are between Léon and Mathilda. When he first passes her on the stairs with her cigarette and bruises, or when he takes her up on the roof overlooking Central Park for her first real lesson. Scenes like these add a real emotional gravity to the movie, which 75% of action flicks either don't even bother with, or give a half-hearted attempt at, at best. A lot of people may focus on only the violent or seemingly exploitative aspects of the film, but that means that they're missing out on something much deeper.As for flaws, Gary Oldman takes over-acting to a whole new level in this movie. Occasionally, that kind of thing is okay (or even a plus), but not here. This isn't The Fifth Element. He was too wacky to feel sinister or dangerous. Other than that, this is a fantastic movie that is worth adding to anyone's collection.",8,1,1,27 May 2010
American Pie," 1999 seems so long ago.
","American Pie probably needs another review less than almost any movie in the world. Is there anyone left who hasn't already seen the movie, or at least knows what it's about? Regardless, here are my two cents. American Pie hasn't aged particularly well. It doesn't have the timelessness of some of the other movies in the raunchy teen comedy genre, and it's been greatly surpassed by movies that have come after it. It's still funny in some ways, but a lot of the gross scenes that used to be shocking, are fairly unremarkable by today's standards. The most enjoyment I get from the movie now, is from looking at the substantial cast and seeing how their careers have changed, remained stagnant, or basically ended all-together, since 1999. There aren't many other reasons to go back to American Pie.",6,0,0,22 March 2010
Burn After Reading," A fine entry to the Coen's catalog.
","Burn After Reading is one of those cool movies that dabbles a bit in more than one genre. It somehow manages to be a comedy, a spy- thriller, and a relationship study. How many movies can claim all that? A quick glance at the cast is all it takes to see that this picture is pretty star-studded. The Coen brothers must have used their Hollywood pull to get all this talent together, but thankfully the casting never trumped the roles. Everyone fits their characters so well, and there's quite a few unexpected performances to be seen. George Clooney was especially memorable, I don't think that I've ever enjoyed one of his performances this much.Burn After Reading isn't a rapid-fire comedy, but instead its humor is the kind that keeps a smile on your face basically the entire time, and then widens it with a chuckle or two every few minutes. I hesitate to say that it's for everyone, but I recommend that everyone give it a shot to see if it's there cup of tea. It certainly was mine.",8,1,3,29 January 2016
Watchmen," A good effort at making a difficult movie.
","The Watchmen film adaptation is both helped and hurt by its cool trailer and its source material. The trailer was amazing enough to encourage those with no previous knowledge of the graphic novel (like me) to check it out before the movie was released. Unfortunately, this only served to raise my expectations a bit higher than they would have been if I would have gone into the experience completely fresh. Taken for what it is, Watchmen is a laudable effort. While a few key scenes and important plot points ended up on the cutting room floor, that's more of a reflection of how well-written the source material is, rather than gaffs by Zack Snyder.The narrative and overall flow suffers the most from the necessity of having a reasonable running time. At times the movie just feels like it's a string of cool events that are taken directly from the comic frames, separated by a bastardization of the rest of the story. But then again, once I think of how complex the story is to begin with, it's easier to give credit to it being handled the way that it was.The acting was OK for the most part, by the end of the movie I had basically accepted everyone in their roles. Dr. Manhattan, Laurie and Dan took some adjusting too, while Rorschach, Adrian Veidt and Edward Blake were more of a natural fit. Some of the dialogue that works so well on the printed page seemed a bit clunky on the screen, but that's to be expected. Watchmen was written as a comic book, not a play.I think that open-minded newcomers who watch Watchmen stand a pretty decent chance of liking it. It works fairly well as a superhero movie, even without all its depth and complexity. Watchmen veterans, on the other hand, will just have to come to terms with the fact that while the movie wasn't perfect, it will be very difficult to make a better version of Watchmen. Perhaps we should enjoy what we have, changes and all, and just be grateful that this movie was even made. Don't expect perfection from the Watchmen film adaptation, that's what the graphic novel is for.",7,0,2,1 February 2016
The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring," A fantasy film for the ages.
","The Fellowship of the Ring was the first movie that absolutely convinced me that nearly any book or novel can be adapted to film. All it takes is the right people. A bunch of talented folks who are passionate about the source material, and who are committed to preserving the spirit of the work, can make miracles.The first book of the The Lord of the Rings trilogy is dense with exposition and and mythology, and most of it survives intact in the journey from page to screen. Despite all that, the movie never feels dull or overly-expository. Everything is easily presented in a way that those who are unfamiliar with LotR can understand, but it's not dumbed down to where passionate fans would revolt. I can't imagine how daunting that task must have been, but Jackson & co. pulled it off admirably. The cast is solid, the special effects, backgrounds, and CGI are astounding, and it all just 'feels' like Lord of the Rings. Even after seeing the extended edition of the movie several times, it's still one of the most entertaining adventure/fantasy movies that I've ever seen.",8,0,0,27 May 2010
28 Weeks Later," A stellar sequel to a great movie.
","I thought 28 Days Later... was great. A breath of fresh air and a thoughtfully entertaining horror flick. So it's not lightly that I say that I think 28 Weeks Later is even better. The only thing that's missing from the original is the parallel between the rage virus inflicted attackers and the brutality and rage of the main male character and his enemies, at the end of the movie. Everything else is just as good, or improved. Well, everything except the one specific zombie who seems unnaturally intelligent and obsessed with two characters in the movie. Super Zombie didn't fit at all into the 'rules' of the movie, and seemed like an unnecessary plot device. That minor complaint is virtually my only one, though.  28 Weeks is brutal, intense, and more frightening than its predecessor, with the scenes in the crowded parking garage and the pitch black subway tunnel REALLY standing out. The simple story moves along briskly, with no superfluous moments to distract from the tension. The tone is understandably different (there is a new director, after all), but I don't think that the slight change hurt the movie at all. I loved the cast, and the ending is one of the best I've ever seen in a movie of this kind. Any time that I feel like a movie went by too quickly, I know it's a fantastic one. And that's exactly the impression that 28 Weeks Later left me with, even the second time around. It's less deliberate and more action-focused than 28 Days, but only the most stringent fan of the first movie will have an issue with that.",9,2,4,19 June 2010
The Thing," Still worth watching for any horror fan.
","'You think that thing wanted to be an animal? No dogs make it a thousand miles through the cold! No, you don't understand! That thing wanted to be US!'I'm definitely going to see the upcoming remake of The Thing (Mary Elizabeth Winstead, 'nuff said) so I thought that it would be wise to see the 80's remake (the original movie came out in the 50's) before hand. And I'm glad I did. It may be a little dated by today's standards, but it's still a solid exercise in paranoia-fueled monster movies.An isolated Antarctic research station on the cusp of polar winter becomes a battleground for a handful of people and a terrifying alien. One that has a unique ability that quickly causes the humans to not be able to trust one another. They have to remain on the lookout for danger from their fellow humans, as well as the creature. The two aspects of The Thing that are most worthy of mention are the gory and impressive special effects, and the believable tension between the actors as they realize that there is no one they can trust but themselves. The creature design for the Thing truly is memorable, and if you have an aversion to copious amount of blood or tentacles, this will be a nightmare for you. The dynamics between the characters is what most of the story focuses on, and without that, this would just be a mindless movie about people being killed. But instead, it almost becomes a race between the viewer and the characters to figure out who is a threat and who (if anyone) might survive this whole thing. Pretty cool.I think if you're a fan of movies like Alien, you'll like this. It doesn't quite have the timelessness of that movie, and it's not quite as frightening, but there's a similar vibe that the two share. If the upcoming remake is at least as good as this one, it'll be worth watching.",6,1,6,23 July 2010
Pitch Black," Unexpectedly good sci-fi.
","'Finally found something worse than me, huh?.'I'm somewhat of a rabid Radha Mitchell fan (the woman is gorgeous and talented; she should be a much bigger star), so seeing her in a solid, gritty sci-fi/horror flick like this is a pretty good use of two hours for me.The basic story is about a transport ship (piloted by Mitchell's character) that is forced to crash land on an unknown planet. A planet that happens to be inhabited by deadly, light- sensitive predators that come out to feast every twenty-two years when a cosmic event shields the planet from its three suns for a time. One of the passengers of the ship also happens to be a deadly, light-sensitive predator (Vin Diesel) on his way back to the maximum-security prison world that he escaped from. The rest of the crash survivors are forced to rely on Riddick because of his ability to see in the dark and his natural survival instincts, but will he ultimately help them escape, or leave them to their dark fates?Pitch Black isn't perfect. There are a few rather large plot holes (What do the beasts do for the rest of the twenty-two years, just hang out? And what do they live off of on such a barren planet?), but nothing that really took me out of the story. Some of the characters are overly dumb, annoying, or inexplicably antagonistic, but such story devices and character archetypes come along with the genre, more often than not. The special effects and monster designs do look their age, but that can be forgiven in a movie that's more than eleven years old, and they're really not any worse than what you'd see today on the average made-for-TV sci-fi flick. On the other hand, the filmmakers did do a good job of using visual trickery to make the outback of Australia where the movie was filmed look a lot like a harsh, alien world, and on a small budget I'm assuming. So they get props for that.As for what I liked about Pitch Black, it was a pretty entertaining ride. Mitchell was great as the flawed, conflicted pilot unceremoniously promoted to leader, and Diesel was well- suited for Riddick, who's really the main character of the movie. There are likable characters to get attached to and fear for, several tense situations (though calling the movie scary would be a stretch), and a solid amount of action. All in all, Pitch Black was a pleasant surprise. I was more impressed with Diesel than I've been at any other movie of his that I've seen, and none of the lesser elements of the movie are significant enough to stand out much. Recommended.",8,6,9,24 September 2010
Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows: Part 1," As the end draws near...
","'The Ministry of Magic has fallen. The Minister is dead. They are coming.'Even if you weren't familiar with the book that it's based on, you could tell from the very first few minutes of Deathly Hallows that we're speeding toward the final confrontation. The bleak, subdued settings, and the overall dark tone of the visuals and story portray a world in which Voldemort's victory is almost complete, and there is little comfort or hope to be found for our heroes and their allies. Death and danger constantly surround Harry, Hermione, and Ron, as they seek to complete the difficult task that they've been left by a mentor who can no longer guide them. They must stand alone, but the stresses of such an impossible journey makes even depending on each other harder than it's ever been before. The final Harry Potter book was a good one, but it isn't my favorite. Which is why this movie isn't my favorite of the series, either, despite the fact that I think David Yates did a phenomenal job of adapting it to the screen. The decision to make two full-length films from the final book was of course the correct one, as there's simple too much that would have had to have been left out or glossed over with a single film. There still had to be some things left on the cutting room floor, of course, but the absence of these minor scenes don't hurt the movie more than they have in previous installments. The way some events have been streamlined or altered is actually for the better, in my opinion. Now the wait begins for Part 2, and it's not made any easier with the knowledge of how well-executed Part 1 is. This was a movie of smart choices by the filmmakers, from the use of a hand-held camera to give the 'on-the-run' plot a gritty, realistic intensity, to the way the story ends at the perfect point. Harry Potter is going out with a bang - as he deserves. The best compliment I can give Deathly Hallows Part 1 is that when it ended, I was a little disappointed that the movie was already over. Even after 2+ hours, I wanted to sit and continue on to the second part right then. Fans won't be disappointed.",7,2,4,25 November 2010
North by Northwest," The Popcorn Flick of Hitchcock Movies
","North by Northwest reminds me of Vertigo more than any of the other Hitchcock movies that I've seen. Both of them are his versions of 'blockbusters', with the pacing and action scenes of a good summer movie. I enjoyed both of them to about the same degree, as well. It's a pretty thrilling ride, I must say. A case of mistaken identity leads Cary Grant into a web of narrow escapes, murders, espionage, chases, and general peril. He meets the requisite icy blonde along the way (who may be friend or foe), and most of the other Hitchcockian flourishes are present in some degree. North by Northwest is also pretty damn funny. I laughed more than a few times at Grant's pithy quips and his mutually aggressive banter with Eva Marie Saint as Eve Kendall. Who just happens also be another gorgeous woman in a leading Hitchcock role. Who could have guessed?      This is a pretty good movie for anyone unfamiliar with Alfred Hitchcock to start with. It's entertaining enough in traditional ways that it will appeal to people who may have yet to become addicted to Hitchcock's style. I say 'yet', because North by Northwest will probably speed you on your way to becoming hooked.",7,0,4,7 June 2010
Salt," Not quite Bourne with boobs, but almost.
","(This is a review of the Unrated Director's Cut of Salt. I haven't seen the original theatrical version or the Extended Cut.)Salt is a fun spy/action movie. It had lots of exciting scenes, a credible action actress, and at times, it's downright thrilling. It even had me guessing at what direction it was going, at a few points. Salt is also derivative of lots of other movies. Primarily the Bourne series and the Mission Impossible movies, but also the Bond films, Tom Clancy's series, and The Manchurian Candidate. It didn't bother me much that Salt borrowed liberally from so many other films. As they say, there's nothing new under the sun. The one real issue that I did have with Salt was that the last part of the movie tries to be entirely too clever, and loses a lot of its credibility and falls apart, as a result. But, as I can't really go too much into that without spoiling the whole film, I'll just content myself to saying that while I didn't really like the turn the movie took towards the finale, it wasn't enough to ruin the movie for me.I love Angelina Jolie in these kinds of roles. She's a born action star, and there are very few actresses who would have been as successful in this role as she was. She almost makes you believe that her character could beat the crap out of and outsmart every other police officer, agent, and soldier that she came across, without missing a beat. It seemed like she did most (if not all) of her own stunts and (brutal) fight scenes, and given the fact that she had just given birth to twins a few months before, I was beyond impressed. The ending completely leaves itself open for sequels, and I'd love to see Jolie return for the role. All we need is a story that doesn't lose itself in shennanigans that would feel right at home in an over-the-top spy movie from the 60's, and we could have a really solid franchise on our hands.",7,1,3,27 December 2010
The Men Who Stare at Goats," Good in parts, but slightly disappointing as a whole.
","'More of this is true than you would believe.'The Men Who Stare at Goats is an offbeat farce that does a lot of things right, but loses itself a bit in reaching for a 'message'. The cast is great, with actors like George Clooney, Ewan McGregor, Jeff Bridges, and Kevin Spacey proving (if you somehow didn't know already) that they all have affinity for comedic acting. Clooney and McGregor have wonderful chemistry (they spend most of the movie together), and I probably would have given this a higher score if the dynamic between those two in the first half of the story would have continued on into the second half. McGregor plays a reporter trying to get into Iraq to cover the recent events there concerning the war, and Clooney is an undercover contractor he meets and learns about the government's attempts at developing psychic soldiers, from. They're hilarious together.   TMWSAG attempts to do what Burn After Reading did so well, which was use absurdity in fiction to point out truth in real life. It's not quite as successful, though, even though I thoroughly enjoyed most of it. Some parts are hilariously funny, if you have a suitable sense of humor, but that aspect of the movie was so much more interesting to me than the overall statement about war and the military that was being made, that I became annoyed when the latter was focused on more than the former.I loved the overall idea and loved the cast, but the movie as a whole was just a little too muddled and inconsistent. Nice to see Rebecca Mader in a small role, though.",6,1,3,13 December 2010
Ratatouille," Food, Paris, and Pixar. What's not to like?
","'No! You waste energy and time! You think cooking is a cute job, eh? Like Mommy in the kitchen?'Who knew that a movie about rats could be so charming and visually beautiful? Mice? Sure, The Great Mouse Detective and An American Tail did it years ago. But leave it to Pixar to make a lowly rat lovable, and even make him someone that we'd want fixing our food! Now, that is quite an accomplishment.Visually, this is one of my very favorite Pixar movies. The character designs are very appealing to me, and the technical detail is outstanding. The look of the characters themselves are only outshone by the marvelous Parisian backdrops that we get glimpses of through windows and from sky shots. The music is great, the message is good, and the story is entertaining for kids and adults. I put Ratatouille on that second Pixar tier. Not quite up to the brilliance and cleverness of Monsters Inc. and Toy Story, but a great animated movie in every regard.",8,4,6,2 August 2010
Bad Teacher," One of the more underrated comedies of the year.
","'Your jeans feel so good against my jeans.'I had heard some pretty mixed things about Bad Teacher so I decided to wait and give it a rental instead of watching it at the theater, but it turns out I was a bit over-cautious. This is a pretty funny movie, and the best Cameron Diaz role since There's Something About Mary. Diaz plays Elizabeth, a shallow, materialistic, rude, manipulative teacher at a middle school whose only real current goal in life is to buy a pair of fake boobs and land a rich husband to take care of her the rest of her life. A young, rich substitute teacher ignites a rivalry between Elizabeth and another teacher, while at the same time Elizabeth does anything and everything in order to procure the $10,000 she needs to get her 'essential procedure'. Bad Teacher isn't really the kind of comedy that has a lot of laugh-out-loud moments (except one particularly funny scene involving dry-humping), and it's full of characters that have very few redeeming qualities. But I found it amusing throughout, its mean-spiritedness set it apart from a lot of the other comedies I've seen this year, and Diaz really did do a great job as the foul-mouthed, totally selfish main character. I liked it.",Null,1,4,19 October 2011
The Exorcist," Classic, timeless horror.
","'Now, I want you to tell me that you know for a fact that there's nothing wrong with my daughter, except in her mind. You tell me for a fact that an exorcism wouldn't do any good. You tell me that!'Definitely one of the most well-crafted horror movies that I've seen. Lots of time is given to developing the characters and atmosphere, which leads to a pretty fantastic payoff in the end. There's a clear sense of expert care taken with every aspect of the movie; there are no slapdash efforts or cut corners, from the script to the acting to the music. This story of young girl who may be possessed by a demonic entity is full of shocking imagery, but never once feels exploitative. The themes of doubt, faith, and sacrifice are clear, but not the least bit heavy-handed. The practical special effects are still impressive today, so I can only imagine the impact they had back in 1973. Frightening, disturbing, and ultimately, even a bit uplifting. The Exorcist is one of those classic movies that's still just as good today, and that every horror buff should see.",8,3,4,16 July 2011
Spirited Away," One of the best movies that the world of animation has to offer.
","'Now go, and don't look back.'Some movies diminish with time and repeated viewings. When you find one that doesn't, you know you have a true classic on your hands. That's exactly what Spirited Away is.The animation and art are as impressive as any other animated movie that I've seen - including stop-motion movies, computer animation, and other traditional animation. The character designs are so imaginative that it makes me thoroughly jealous that I don't have the talent that these talented artists do. Every background and frame of animation is beautiful, and that's no exaggeration.     The story is simple, engaging, and charming. There no grand story arc, just a spoiled girl who matures a bit as she seeks a way back to her world for herself and her parents, and the trials that Chihiro and the various denizens she meets at the spirit bathhouse face. There are light morals about pollution, discrimination, and greed, but they're never presented in a way that's heavy-handed or blatant.All that praise, and I haven't even mentioned the score (one of the best in any animated movie that I've heard) and the voice work (very good in both English and Japanese) Spirited Away was a labor of love, and it shows. It's a masterpiece for Studio Ghibli, and a movie that anyone with heart can love, be they young or old.",9,1,2,18 July 2010
No Strings Attached," Decent enough.
","Not bad. No Strings Attached gets off to a rocky start with a string of unfunny jokes and a forced premise. But thankfully, the movie eventually falls into an entertaining, if entirely conventional, groove. Kutcher plays his usual heart of gold, sensitive, funny guy, which I can take or leave. But Portman kills it with a sense of humor and beauty that reminds me a lot of Mila Kunis. Don't get too excited at that R rating, this isn't a raunchy sex comedy, despite the premise. It's most assuredly a romantic comedy. I doubt No Strings Attached will be anyone's movie of the year, but it's certainly not as bad as the first 15 minutes had me worried that it would be. Check it out if you're interested",6,1,3,22 June 2011
Tropic Thunder," One of the rare comedies that is still funny after multiple viewings.
","This review is so, so easy to write. If you like comedies, go see Tropic Thunder. It has an all-star cast, it's completely hilarious, and it's even fairly original. There are so many great things about this movie, that it would take way too long to list them all. I saw Pineapple Express lately, and I thought that was good. But Tropic Thunder is even better!Ben Stiller completely redeemed himself in my eyes by writing, directing, producing, AND starring in this masterpiece. After The Heartbreak Kid, I thought he might have been slipping a bit. I was very, very wrong. I have to mention how excellent the cast is, one more time. It's pretty cool to see some of the unexpected actors who show up here, and they all have spectacular on-screen chemistry with each other. Tropic Thunder works as a comedy just as well as it works as a spoof of actors who submerge themselves to the point of foolishness in their roles, in pursuit of accolades and awards. Heck, it works as a parody of movie-making in general. If you can't tell, I adore Tropic Thunder. This is comedy, my friends.",9,0,2,20 March 2010
Scott Pilgrim vs. the World," The first movie I've seen in quite a while that made me want to stand up and cheer.
","'Scott, if your life had a face, I would punch it.'Scott Pilgrim Vs. The World is easily the most purely and totally entertaining movie that I've seen in ages. It's the epitome of video game culture on film, a great comic book adaptation, and just flat-out fun.For a movie with so many flourishes, bells, and whistles, the story is quite simple and effective. It's even driven by love, awww. Scott Pilgrim is a 22 year-old video game fan, band member, and a nerdy version of a ladies man. He's also a little immature and selfish, as a lot of people in their early twenties can be. When he meets Ramona Flowers (Mary Elizabeth Winstead), he's instantly and totally smitten. So much so that he forgets his current girlfriend and pursues her with full fervor. And it's fortunate that he's so head over heels, because Ramona has seven evil ex's who are determined that she's either going to be with one of them, or no one at all.And those conflicts are settled by fighting. Wild, kinetic, inventive fights that can only be summed up as epic. Like the rest of the movie, they're infused with video game culture in a way that's irresistibly appealing to me. This entire movie just feels like it was made for me and people like me, and I love it for that. My only complaint is that a little under 2 hours in not nearly enough time to flesh out the myriad of cool characters. A lot of the side characters only get the minimum of attention, and that's unfortunate (but understandable). But hey, you're going to want to check out the comic after seeing this anyway, and then you'll get to see all the cool bits and characterization that had to be omitted to ensure a reasonable running time. Other than wishing it was longer, I had no issues. The movie was consistently hilarious, Cera was a great Scott, Winstead was a great Ramona, the whole cast rocked, the music rocked, the fights rocked, and there was all the style and fun you could ask for. Scott Pilgrim Vs. The World is the best movie I've seen this year, and Edgar Wright is a genius for pulling this off so well. You may not love it as much as I did if you're not a part of its targeted demographic, but it's such an entertaining movie that anyone with an open mind has a strong chance of at least liking it.",8,7,26,14 August 2010
Enchanted," Charm and humor to spare.
","Enchanted begins as a typical, Disney-animated princess story. But after a gorgeously animated intro, it shifts to the real world, and suddenly all the cartoonish clichés and fairy-tale staples are unleashed upon the real world. If that doesn't sound interesting to you, clearly you're childhood was devoid of Disney or you don't have any young relatives in your life.Enchanted is funny enough for any lover of (clean) comedy, charming, and...pretty much enchanting. All the fairy-tale characters fit their roles perfectly. Amy Adams perfectly captured the voice, mannerisms, and wide-eyed naivety of a real-life Disney princess. The Dashing Prince, Evil Witch, Comic Animal Sidekick, Inept Lackey, they're all present and accounted for. Disney did an excellent job of gently lampooning itself, but in such a way that it comes off as more of a loving tribute than any kind of mockery.This movie has a lot of positives, and few negatives to speak of. I was slightly disappointed by most of the songs, none of them besides 'That's How You Know' were really that memorable. How weird is that for a Disney movie? And occasionally the lovey-dovey factor went a little high for anyone that isn't an eight-year-old girl to be comfortable with. Hmmm, but it is a fairy-tale. so anything else could hardly be expected. Enchanted is clever, sugary sweet, and amusing. Any past or present Disney fans owe it to themselves to see it. And the rest of you (if there's anyone left) should do yourselves a favor and watch a movie that's guaranteed fun.",8,1,1,1 February 2016
Resident Evil," Just because the zombies are slow, doesn't mean the movie should be.
","I'll admit that I'm a closet fan of the series, but the first installment doesn't do as much for me as the later movies. My main complaint is that the best part of the franchise, Milla Jovovich (Alice), doesn't get going until the last quarter of the movie. Until then, we're subjected to boring build-up and the lamest, slowest zombies since the first Resident Evil game. When Alice finally starts doing her thing, the action picks up, but that doesn't fully wash away the boredom of watching the generic other characters being killed far too slowly. There isn't much cross-over between the movie and the game, besides a few of the locations and the zombies. I don't mind that so much, but I wish Anderson would have added a few more cool moments and set-pieces to Resident Evil, to balance out the boredom. He clearly didn't aim to make the movie scary, so it really needed to be action-packed, to keep the viewer's interest.",5,1,2,17 March 2010
Quantum of Solace," A follow-up that almost (but not quite) lives up to Casino Royale.
","I think Quantum of Solace is a good (but not perfect) follow-up to Casino Royale, and an example of what the new Bond films in the coming years will be like. It's a lean, stream- lined action flick with a British-spy glaze. It does not have all the intricacy of Casino Royale, but it won't be easy for any other film to match the significance of Bond's first mission as a 00.In QoS, Bond continues down the path that he was set on during the previous movie. He's still fairly unpolished, and the grief of Vesper's death consumes him. The plot is simple, but entertaining. The stunt work and action scenes are the highlight of the film. They are brutal, visceral, and very 'Bourne-like'.My main issue with Quantum is that because it's basically a side-story to Casino Royale, the plot does not really hold up as well as that of the previous movie. The villain (and his scheme) isn't very compelling. It's all a bit convoluted and occasionally hard to follow, but I ended up enjoying it more the second time I watched it. Now that the two-part origin is done, it will be interesting to see where they take the 'Quantum' angle. Does the idea of a secret, shadowy criminal organization for our hero to fight, fit well into the new Bond universe? I hope so, and I look forward to Bond 23.",7,2,7,5 March 2010
No Country for Old Men," The Coens do it again.
","'You can't stop what's coming. It ain't all waiting on you. That's vanity.'Even if No Country for Old Men didn't have gorgeous cinematography, excellent pacing, a near perfect script, and an absolutely perfect cast, I still would have loved it for its tone. It's the most similar movie to Fargo that the Coens have done, and the similar theme of implacable and unfathomable violence in a rural American area (once again initiated by money) is one of the main reasons why I love the Coens so much.The breathtaking, empty setting of south Texas is a seamless compliment to the measured pace of the movie. No Country has suspense coming out of its ears, as each scene seems to somehow surpass the previous ones in measured tension. The overall quiet of the film only serves to magnify the eventual scenes of violence when they come, and the fact that you don't see everything happen on-screen keeps the viewer fully invested in the story. There's no constant quick cuts and hyper-kinetic camera work to be seen; only long-smoldering sequences that pushes your anticipation to the brink of breaking, and then pushes it some more.In a cast this good, two people stand out even beyond the others. Tommy Lee Jones as the world-weary sheriff who's the heart of the story, and Javier Bardem as the relentless, inscrutable, main antagonist of the story. Jones was perfect, there's no other way for me to say it. And Bardem gives life to the best and most interesting villain since The Operative in Serenity. Both performances were among the best that I've seen in my life.No County for Old Men is the kind of movie that improves with every viewing. Ten years from now, I'll still be watching it and loving it.  It's film-making at its finest. When you take an amazing story and marry it to directors with immeasurable talent and a cast that couldn't have been better chosen, you get a masterpiece.",10,4,6,12 July 2010
District 9," A thought-provoking sci-fi tale.
","District 9 is a unique experience. I'd describe it as political sci-fi action faux-documentary thriller. If that doesn't qualify as unique, I don't know what does. Another simpler way to describe it is that it's a good sci-fi movie. District 9 poses the question of what would happen if some relatively unimpressive aliens were forced to find refuge in South Africa. There's lots of exploration of themes like xenophobia, exploitation, bioengineering and weapons ethics, among others. The best science fiction movies always seem to find a way to tackle a complex subject or two, without beating the audience over the head with it. District 9 (along with Moon) is a good recent example of that.Don't fall under the impression that this is some cerebral think-piece, though. There's lots of action. In nearly every scene, there's some small (or huge) bit of interesting visuals going on. From the design and animation of the aliens, to their technology and various explosions and gun battle set-pieces, the special effects are universally impressive. Especially for the relatively small budget that the picture was made with.I heartily recommend this to almost anyone. District 9 is a very entertaining movie that can offer you more, if you choose to ponder the topics it raises. And if you just want to see stuff get blown up, it'll still have you covered.",7,0,7,17 June 2010
The Assassination of Jesse James by the Coward Robert Ford," A story of the last days of the notorious Jesse James, and the man who came to regret killing him.
","'I'm saying his sins will soon find him out. I'm saying his cup of iniquity is full. I'm saying Jesse James is a desperate case and may require a desperate remedy.'The Assassination of Jesse James is about as far from your usual shoot 'em up, bang bang, western yarn, as you can get. It's actually a character study. A particularly measured and slowly paced character study. But it works on the strength of it's great cast and solid writing.Casey Affleck is wonderful as the unsettling, perpetually nervous, shifty man whose unnerving obsession with Jesse James is uncomfortably obvious. And Brad Pitt continues to impress, as he presents James as a charismatic, dangerous, and paranoid man (though his accent was a little iffy, at times). The supporting cast of talented actors like Sam Rockwell, Paul Schneider, Garret Dillahunt, Mary-Louise Parker, and Zooey Deschanel, are all favorites of mine, and all perfectly suited for their roles.Some people may find the pace to be a little TOO glacial, but it would be a crime for a movie with cinematography this beautiful to be rushed. Some of the backdrops and settings are almost breathtaking, with snow-covered roads and fields of grain featuring colors that seem almost too vivid to be natural. I'm a big fan of striking scenery in my movies, and this one certainly gets my seal of approval in that regard. The Assassination of Jesse James is not a short movie, and it's value is in the interactions of the characters, not in the robberies (which we see only one of) and romanticized-western action that we would normally associate with the near-legendary story of the James Gang. I found it to be worthwhile. It raises questions about what makes a man a hero or a villain in the public's eyes, and by the end of the film, we find out that those questions have interesting answers.",7,0,0,1 August 2010
Meet the Fockers," Meet the slightly inferior sequel.
","'It's nice, all of us being here together, don't you think?'Ben Stiller followed up the hit 2000 comedy Meet the Parents with a slightly lukewarm revisit of Gaylord Focker, this time with his own parents in tow. It's not as funny as the first movie, but it's also not a complete blight on the quality of the first film.The plot this time around revolves around the meeting of Greg's and Pam's parents, as the soon to be in-laws have yet to be introduced. As you could probably guess, Jack (a returning Robert De Niro) clashes with the free-spirited and unorthodox Bernie (Dustin Hoffman) and Roz (Barbra Streisand). Conflict and the occasional humorous situation results.With such a great cast, It's a little disappointing that this feels like such a re-tread, and that so many of jokes are hit or miss. Greg once again finds himself straying outside of the circle of trust, there are more jokes about him being a nurse, a dog that likes to hump things, and a baby who curses. It's a bit of an understatement to say that Meet the Fockers starts off slowly. Still, there are some laughs to be had, and at the very least, watching this will get you caught up on events before the third (and much funnier looking) movie in the series rolls into theaters this winter. Fans of the first movie or Ben Stiller should check this out, but you should also keep your expectations at a moderate level. The fresh faces add some fun, but the writing is a little stale.",6,1,2,9 August 2010
The Transporter," Nothing special, but still entertaining.
","The Transporter movies all share the same basic elements. Fantastic action scenes, barely-there stories, and Jason Statham. In the original Transporter, we're introduced to Frank, Statham's character, and the absolute bare minimum of his background. The rest of the movie is car chases, explosions, and fights.I won't go into the plot, because it's pretty much only here to give Statham a pretext to hand out his butt-kickings. My favorite thing about these movies is that Statham is never really in danger of dying or being beaten. If he's fighting someone, they MAY get in a hit or two before puts them down. Even if it's like, 20 guys with machine guns, and all he has for a weapon is his shirt. The fight scenes are pretty cool, you can always rely on this series to add a few new wrinkles to the standard old sequences.There's some kind of smuggling going on that Qi Shu's dad is involved in, and Matt Shulze is somehow involved in it too. And François Berléand plays some kind of cop who is also Jason's friend, or something. Qi is the eye candy/damsel in distress/love interest, Francois helps move the plot along, and the rest of the cast are bad guys. That's pretty much it. Seriously.Don't watch The Transporter if you're looking for a well-written script or some compelling character development. Pop it in when you want to see some bad guys get the crap kicked out of them, pretty explosions, and a pretty girl.",6,1,1,29 January 2016
Tucker and Dale vs Evil," A funny spin on a horror staple.
","Tucker and Dale Vs. Evil takes a horror genre staple as turns it on its head. Instead of a family of inbred hillbillies slaughtering (and often eating) some hapless out-of-towners, we get a duo of lovable backwoods guys named Tucker and Dale. They find themselves stereotyped, feared, and utterly bewildered by some visiting college kids. Their attempt to save one of them from drowning is misconstrued as kidnapping, and the kids end up killing themselves in hilarious ways while trying to 'rescue' their friend.Tucker and Dale really is a funny movie, with a lot of the death scenes being especially comic. Who knew death by wood chipper could be so hilarious? It slows down a bit and loses some of its comic edge as it goes on and starts to resemble a typical horror movie a bit more, but I still highly recommend this to anyone interested in seeing a familiar horror story from a different (and amusing) angle.",7,1,1,22 December 2011
Mission: Impossible - Ghost Protocol," A franchise that's still going strong.
","After a short hiatus, the Mission Impossiblr franchise is back. And yes, it's still a blast. Mission Impossible: Ghost Protocol is the best pure action flick I've seen in quite a while. There were quite a few 'wow' moments where all I could do was stare at what was happening on the screen in amazement. It's just a fun movie, through and through. Any Mission Impossible fan will be pleased, and seeing it on the biggest screen possible is a must. It may not can quite match the brutally personal story and ruthless villainous performance of Philip Seymour Hoffman that propelled the third (and still best) movie (both plot and villain are fairly generic, here), but Ghost Protocol tops it as far as the action is concerned and proves that the franchise (and Cruise himself) has lots of gas still left in the tank. I'd love for this cast to stick around and continue the series.",6,1,3,2 April 2012
Revolutionary Road," A cinematic punch to the gut.
","Wow. I'm almost at a loss for words. Revolutionary Road was one of the most honest and emotionally involving movie experiences that I've seen in months. It's fairly rare that a film leaves such a strong impression on me, but I'm pleased to say that it has happened once again. The music, acting, and directing are brilliant, but that is to be expected from a movie with this many talented people involved. I won't go into any particulars about the plot. It's best that a viewer experiences this with no pre-defined expectations, like I did. Just know that there are some incredibly complex issues presented here, and there are no easy solutions to be found. Revolutionary Road is undeniably sad, but there's a complete lack of those 'tug-on-your-heartstrings' moments. It's all brutal and true to life. That's what makes the movie so compelling. You can't watch it, without thinking about yourself.",9,0,1,30 March 2010
28 Days Later...," What would happen if science unlocked the true rage of humanity?
","28 Days Later is the sci-fi horror thriller that brought zombies back to the mainstream in style. It and the Dawn of the Dead remake were mostly responsible for putting zombies back in the mind of the general movie going public, and making them actually exciting again.This is a very British movie, and the style reflects that. It has a measured pace in some places, and the occasional humor is very dry. But when the action hits, it hits hard and it is frantic. It's an exciting film, to say the least.There are a few recognizable faces here, but none of the actors involved were big stars at the time it was made. Which is great, because it would be a very different movie if it was just a vehicle for an actor or actress. 28 Days Later is more about the potential violence and rage in ordinary humans, than it is about the infected who have brought so much destruction to England. That's one aspect of the many that gives it appeal beyond the traditional audience of zombie flicks. Great movie.",8,0,1,19 June 2010
"Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon"," A spectacularly elegant martial arts film.
","One of the best and most stylish martial arts films of all time. The choreography and wire-work that was so impressive back in 2000, is still just as awesome today.I've watched my fair share of martial arts flicks, both old and new, and none of them convey the 'art' part of martial arts as effectively as Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon. The action scenes are so graceful and mesmerizing that they almost seem like ballet. Every fight scene is a visual feast, with people flying, floating, leaping, and running straight up walls. And each scene manages to be more impressive than the last. It's poetry in motion. And pleasantly, there's a nice, story to serve as a background to the action. It's nothing you haven't seen before. A  rebellious young woman, forbidden love, revenge, etc. It's all simple and well-presented. All in all, there's not another modern martial arts film that I'd recommend over Crouching Tiger. It chooses to be elegant and restrained instead of gory and brutal, and it's a better movie for it.",8,0,0,1 May 2010
Drive," One of my favorites of 2011.
","Drive is probably the coolest, most effective hard-boiled thriller I've seen in quite a while. Any time I'm sitting in a theater full of people that are absolutely quiet and still for long stretches of time (minus occasional gasps and laughs), it's pretty obvious that you've got an engrossing movie on your hands. Everything about Drive works. The pacing is excellent, the soundtrack sticks in your head like glue, the cinematography is outstanding, and the actors, led by Gosling, left no room for complaint. I'm really starting to respect the guy as a pretty amazing actor. Driver (the main character) is a quiet man, but there's a danger inside him that Gosling brings to life perfectly when necessary. It's the best role I've seen him in. As much as I liked Drive, I can't recommend it for everyone. It's a very violent movie, a slow burn, and it has heavy noir influences. If any of those things are a turnoff for you, do a little digging first before you lay down your cash to see this. Otherwise, I recommend it wholeheartedly. It's like a throwback to the 70's in the best possible way, I really enjoyed it.",9,3,11,16 September 2011
Insidious," Enjoyably frightening flick.
","In Insidious, strange happenings and frightening occurrences lead a family to believe that their new home is haunted, especially after a tragedy befalls one of their members and the ghostly presences seem to become stronger. Insidious is definitely scary. I'd challenge anyone to watch it alone at night and not be freaked out by it. The first half will probably meet the approval of nearly any horror fan. It takes time to build atmosphere and establish the characters, while still offering more than enough scares. The second part may be more divisive, though. The story goes in a fairly original direction, and I wouldn't be surprised if some people were put off by the shift in tone. I didn't find it that difficult to adjust to, though I did think the former half was more frightening and satisfying than the latter. I just thought I'd offer a warning that how the movie starts is fairly different from how it ends. Great finale, though, even if it wasn't totally unexpected. Overall this is a more than solid horror movie, and I recommend it.",7,1,2,9 August 2011
X-Men: The Last Stand," Half the movie of the previous X-Men.
","It doesn't take long to see that The Last Stand has a very different director than X2, and it also doesn't take long to figure out what Brett Ratner's philosophy for the third X-Men movie is. MORE! BIGGER! More mutants! More action scenes! Bigger explosions! More special effects! X-Men 3 tops X2 in all those areas I just mentioned, but it's definitely not the better movie.The main area I think The Last Stand suffers in, is the story. They took two absolutely huge stories that easily required their own movies (the Dark Phoenix and the mutant 'cure'), sand tried to stuff them all together into one plot. It just doesn't work well. Events seem too hurried and under-developed, and after the solid story of the last movie, that just isn't acceptable. I understand that story choices have to be made, and they won't always be made in the way I would do things, but the large body count and drastic character changes just seemed unwise, to me. X-men 3 is a decent movie, and nowhere near the horrible disaster that was still to come in X-Men Origins: Wolverine, but this pales in comparison to its predecessor.",6,1,2,19 April 2010
Good Will Hunting," Better late than never.
","It's a lonely feeling to finally watch such a popular and critically-acclaimed movie like Good Will Hunting, and be wondering what all the fuss was about. Sure it's been a few years since it was released, but movies this highly praised usually stand up to the test of time.So I didn't think it was amazing...but it was good. It's the kind of underdog story that pulls at the heartstrings, and I imagine that a large portion of its popularity comes from that fact. Matt Damon is just a great actor in every movie he ever does, Minnie Driver was aces, and Robin Williams made the rare decision to showcase the portion of his talent that doesn't make me want to slap him.Good Will Hunting is a solid movie, and it's really a shame that it has taken me so long to see it. Solid, but not spectacular.",7,2,5,17 May 2010
The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers," The quality continues.
","All the good things that The Fellowship of the Ring started, The Two Towers continues without a hitch. Sometimes the middle part of trilogies can be the weakest, but that's not the case here.The viewer is introduced to more of the world beyond the Shire, including Rohan, Fangorn Forest, and Mordor. All these locations are crafted with as much care and skill as the Shire  and Rivendell.The best parts of the movie are Gollum and the epic Battle of Helm's Deep. Gollum is still my favorite CG character in any live-action movie, even several years later. He feels just like a living, breathing character. And as for Helm's Deep, it's hands-down one of the most impressive battle sequences ever in a fantasy film. Top notch in every way.So basically, if you liked The Fellowship of the Ring, you'll probably like The Two Towers even more.",8,0,2,28 May 2010
The Lion King," There's little here to recommend.
","When you remake a classic, it has to be better or it will seem very unnecessary to the original audience. 'Different' just is not quite good enough.The 2016 remake of The Jungle Book is a great example. It took the original movie and breathed new life into the story with charm. I liked it more than I ever did the traditionally animated version.In comparison, this version of The Lion King is the same, but updated. And those updates felt worse, almost each and every time.The computer animation is certainly impressive in its photorealisim, but the characters were uniformly less charming and interesting as a result. The elephant graveyard is no longer terrifying. Pride Rock is much less majestic. The savannah seems sparse and empty.The songs were anemic and underwhelming compared to the original soundtrack, which is one of the best Disney ever produced. The new version of 'Be Prepared' would have fared better being left out of the movie entirely.The new voice actors ranged from passable to forgettable. It was jarring seeing the incredibly realistic animals' mouths moving in speech.Positives? Seth Rogen and Billy Eichner were amusing as Timon and Pumbaa. Realistic hyenas are certainly scarier and more menancing than cartoons.If I had never seen the original Lion King. I would have though this was an okay, if unremarkable movie that looks more like a showcase for how far computer animation has come in rendering realistic-looking animals. If you see it, see it for that reason. I don't think I'll fell compelled to ever watch this version of the movie ever again.",5,2,6,22 July 2019
The Mist," One of my favorite horror flicks of the 2000s.
","'Well...we got four. Four bullets.'The Mist is probably my favorite Stephen King adaptation. When military experimentation opens a door to another dimension, a small town in the northeast U.S. is swiftly and completely blanketed by a thick fog. A fog inhabited by terrifying creatures that may mean the end of everything. A group of people trapped inside a supermarket must then try to survive dangers both external and internal. Since this is based on a King story, you know that there's going to be more to it than just monsters killing humans. Conflict between the people in the store is just as much of a threat as the horrors of the mist, and outsiders versus the town natives and misguided fanaticism brought about by fear are two of the major themes of the plot. It's nice when a horror movie is interesting beyond the usual shocks and gore, and that's one of the strong points of The Mist.I thought the creature designs were good, if not amazing. They looked suitably frightening for the most part, and the actors did a good job of reacting to the beasts, which is always important with CG creatures. Another strong (and very King-esquire) point was the ending, which was absolutely fantastic. I think this would be worth seeing for the ending, alone.The Mist gets a full recommendation from me. It's horrifying (if you have a aversion to spiders like me, you will be permanently scarred), and has that trademark Steven King vibe that elevates it beyond typical horror. It's been a few years since the first time I've seen it, but it still was just as entertaining the second time around. That's about the best compliment that a horror movie can get.",8,2,5,21 August 2010
Stardust," A fun fantasy movie.
","'What do stars do? They shine.'Sky pirates. Blood-thirsty (actually, heart-hungry) witches. Fallen stars. Murderous princes. Action, humor, and all the romance that anyone should require. Stardust is an entertaining fantasy adventure film that has it all, and should appease any fan of the genre.Matthew Vaughn's second directorial effort is quite different from the work he did before and after it (the excellent Layer Cake and Kick-Ass, respectively), and it proves that he can make a good movie in nearly any genre. This adaptation of the Neil Gaiman novel of the same name follows our young hero Tristan (Charlie Cox) as he follows a falling star to another world, in order to bring it back as a gift for the woman he wants to marry.It's not that simple of course, as Tristan finds the star to be not a mere celestial rock, but a young woman (Claire Danes). A very uncooperative young woman, and one who is also being sought by three witch sisters and a prince, who all wish to kill her for her immortal heart. As you can probably guess, that scenario has adventure written all over it.Stardust has a very definite Princess Bride vibe. If that movie's mix of action, humor, romance, and colorful characters (Robert De Niro has a ball as a rather unique pirate, and Michelle Pfeiffer and Ricky Gervais also steal every scene they're in) appealed to you, then you're in luck. I honestly can't come up with many reasons why someone wouldn't like this, unless you're just not a fan of Gaiman's book or the genre as a whole. I found it to be charming and fun.",7,3,4,6 August 2010
Cars 2," Cars returns and goes global.
","I like the direction Pixar decided to go with Cars 2. Turning it into a globe-trotting spy flick is a fun and interesting way to continue the story without having to retread anything that happened in the first movie. With that said, I am not a fan of Mater, and the fact that he's essentially the main character of the movie is not exactly my cup of tea. I can completely understand how kiddos love him and find him hilarious, but he annoys me to no end. So, as much as I enjoyed some parts of Cars 2 (including the addition of Emily Mortimer, who automatically makes anything better), I can't say I'll be eager to see it again soon. It's bright, vivid and looks amazing, and there's a nice little story of being true to oneself at the heart of it, but the Mater overload is just too much for me. Cars 2 can't compare to the best Pixar has to offer, but there's a 99.99% chance that there's a young one in your life that will have a blast watching it (and playing with the toys that you're inevitably going to have to purchase afterwards).",6,1,1,28 November 2011
Kick-Ass," Jet packs with chain guns, precocious pre-teen killing machines, and Youtube heroes.
","'Come on, be honest with yourself. At some point in our lives, we all wanted to be a superhero.' I'm loving the recent bounty of 'real people as superheroes' movies. Whether they're adaptations of graphic novels like Kick-Ass and Watchmen, or original stories like Defendor and the upcoming movie Super, I can't get enough of them.Kick-Ass (the graphic novel) is like Watchmen for the new generation. Not as momentous or genre-defining of course, but still just as post-modern, in its own way. The movie adaptation does feature some changing and refocusing of the original story, but I think it holds up pretty well.Kick-Ass is entertaining, which is the most important thing. Funny often, violent often, often funny AND violent, and (very) occasionally poignant. Nicholas Cage is better suited for this kind of irreverent movie than almost anything more serious, Aaron Johnson is a decent Dave, Christopher Mintz-Plasse is as funny as usual, and Chloe Moretz steals the show, as she often does. The more the movie focuses on her, the better it is.   A lot of fuss had been made about the violence in this movie, and of course, Hit Girl. Well, those people would be shocked to know that the story and Hit Girl herself have greatly been toned down from what you'd see if you read the graphic novel. Several of the more 'questionable' things were cut out of the movie entirely, and the ending is decidedly more general audience friendly than it originally was. Kick-Ass (while violent, don't get me wrong) is no more violent than something like Watchmen, and beyond the shock factor some people may feel about seeing a 12 year- old use some very improper language, there's nothing here more offensive than what you'd see in a similarly rated action movie. All of Hit Girl's scenes (really, the entire movie) are so over the top and unrealistic, that I honestly don't see how anyone could be bothered by that character. If she's an issue for you, this really isn't the kind of movie you should be watching. I just thought I'd address that, because I quite frankly thought that the controversy over all that was ridiculous.You should easily be able to tell from the trailer if you'll this movie. If you thought those were awesome, you'll enjoy this. If you thought otherwise, don't bother. It's not for you. Fans of the graphic novel should also be reasonably pleased, as the casting was solid, a lot of the story was kept intact, and it's just plain fun to watch.",9,4,9,3 August 2010
Unknown," An ambitious effort paired with uneven execution.
","'You really don't remember anything, do you?'An American professor in Germany (Liam Neeson) for an important conference is separated from his wife, gets in an accident, and wakes up with amnesia to a world where his identity has seemingly been taken by another man. Along with a taxi driver (Diane Kruger) who is his only link to his life before his accident, he tries to unravel what's going on and avoid mysterious men who seem to be hunting him for unknown reasons. Unknown certainly aspires to be a top-notch thriller. And it has the cast to accomplish that, including Neeson, Bruno Ganz and Frank Langella, as well as enough twists to satisfy any audience. But just because a story is initially unpredictable, doesn't make it great. Only a few scenes in Unknown actually held my full interest, while most stayed safely in the mode of generic action and car chases that we see in countless movies a year. You'll be able to sympathize with the amnesia-stricken main character quite well, because so little of Unknown is memorable. The mystery of what's going on was enough to keep me watching until the end, but curiosity by itself is not exactly entertainment. The answers, when they come, are a little too implausible to be satisfying. This is a plot that's easy to poke holes into, if you're into that kind of thing. Unknown isn't horrible, it's simply inconsistent. It starts off as a thriller, hits several rough patches between the occasional compelling moments, and finishes up as if it was trying to be Taken 2: Take Harder.Definitely a rental, in my opinion.",6,0,2,1 July 2011
Moulin Rouge!," Extraordinary...for a while.
","'I mean the show will be magnificent, opulent, tremendous, stupendous, gargantuan bedazzlement! A sensual ravishment. It will be...Spectacular Spectacular!'I thought the first half of Moulin Rouge was spectacular. Beyond spectacular. Grand, sexy, bright, colorful, manic, clever, sumptuous, lavish, and endlessly amusing. Kidman was wonderful, the songs and performances grab you and don't let go, and I was just intensely interested by it all. It was the kind of start that anyone who enjoys a fun movie would find irresistible.The second half, however, cooled my ardor a bit. The story takes a turn for the more serious and tragically romantic. The liveliness was replaced with sadness, the fun was supplanted with the dour, and Nicole Kidman was tragically over-dressed. I'm not claiming that these aspects of the movie were flaws (except Nicole Kidman not being half-naked anymore), but they didn't appeal to me as much as what came before. I found myself losing interest somewhat.So my score is an average of a stellar first half and a disappointing (for me) finale. Depending on your preference for the melodramatic, you may not share my reservations. Regardless, this is a movie that anyone with even a passing fondness for musicals must see. It's a glorious experience, even if it's an uneven one.",8,0,2,3 November 2010
The Illusionist," Impressive, but not the best.
","There have been many comparisons made between The Illusionist and The Prestige, and understandably so. They were released not very far apart. They both deal with magicians, and pushing the boundaries of what is considered illusion and what is considered real. Both of them have solid casts (though I do wish that Liv Tyler would have kept Jessica Biel's role), captivating stories, and twisting plots. But while The Prestige is one of my very favorite movies, I only consider The Illusionist to be a good one. The plot of The Illusionist is simple, it's basically a love story. There are some incredible moments sprinkled throughout the narrative, and a few particularly memorable parts that stand among my very favorite scenes in any movie. I almost felt a sense of wonder akin to the audience members at Eisenheim's shows. But as I said, the story is ultimately a very familiar one. It works well within the context of the movie, but compared to The Prestige, it seems almost pedestrian. The cinematography was amazing, though. I loved the vignette-type style in which the movie was shot. I have to say, that this is my favorite Edward Norton performance. He captures the mystery and almost sinister potential power of Eisenheim, perfectly. You're almost forced to believe the impossible may be possible, because of Norton's persona. No one else really rises to the heights of Norton's performance, but the other actors still play their roles reasonably well. The Illusionist is a very good movie, and I think it would have stood out even more, if not released so close to a similar movie that I consider to be superior. The focus on a love story will probably make this even more appealing to some people, than it was to me.",8,0,0,12 April 2010
Fantastic 4: Rise of the Silver Surfer," The series is heading in the wrong direction.
","There's little reason to recommend Rise of the Silver Surfer. It's missing even the goofy charm that made first Fantastic Four a decent popcorn movie. The problems begin with the casting. Its much more apparent here than in the first movie, that these actors really don't fit their characters. As much as I love Jessica Alba, she's no Sue Storm. She tries hard, but she never comes close to being anything more than a pretty distraction. Dr. Doom is smarmy, but not sinister or intimidating. Johnny seems bland, The Thing is defined by his girlfriend more than anything else, and Reed is just goofy. Each character is basically an even more watered down version of themselves from the first movie. The Silver Surfer just flies around looking cool and making dire predictions. And let's not even begin talking about Galactus. Everyone is uniformly underwhelming. As for the story, it's more boring than anything involving FREAKIN' GALACTUS should ever be. It's short, which makes it bearable...until the ridiculous ending. Horrible. It sounds like I hated the movie, but I was just genuinely disappointed that Rise of the Silver Surfer didn't improve on the first movie, at all. Watch this if you simply must see every superhero movie (or if you must see every Jessica Alba movie), but be prepared to find little satisfaction.",5,0,3,12 April 2010
Nausicaä of the Valley of the Wind," Nausicaä: Reviewed
","A thoroughly typical Studio Ghibli movie, which means that it's charmingly and expertly animated, and has an environmentally friendly message. I can't place Nausicaä among my favorite Ghibli films like Spirited Away and The Cat Returns, though. Other than Nausicaä herself, the characters aren't very memorable. The story is simple and straightforward, almost to the point of being bland, and the pro-nature message is very heavy-handed, even though it's appreciated. The first half of the movie is also better than the latter half, in my opinion. Still, this is a movie I like to revisit from time to time, even though it lacks some of the imagination and immersion of superior Ghibli films. It's beautifully animated, though in a way that's more utilitarian than awe-inducing. Keep in mind, that even a merely 'decent' Ghibli film is still more than worth checking out.",Null,0,2,27 July 2011
Transformers," Exactly what you'd expect a big screen version of Transformers to be.
","I have great news: even Michael Bay couldn't run a movie about giant robots fighting each other. Though he did give it his best effort in Transformers 2. Transformers is a fun blend of action and humor. The action never fails to impress. Some of the most beloved Transformers were lovingly created on-screen for this movie, and it's just fun to see them changing forms and actually doing the cool stuff that countless boys all over the world once had them doing in their imaginations. The explosions, special effects, and computer-generated robots are all a joy to behold. The humor only occasionally strays into territory that's too childish for even the kids that are a large part of the targeted audience. Most of the time, there are genuine laughs to be had to break up the long action set pieces. Shia Lebouf is a funny and likable protagonist, and pairing him with Megan Fox resulted in a pair of reasonably good central characters. This movie isn't really about the human characters, anyway. It's about the robots. And if you're a fan of Transformers, action, CGI wizardry, or all three, you're probably going to be as pleased with this as I was.",8,6,10,15 June 2010
Empire Records," If you're still interested after thirty minutes, you'll like it.
","Many people will hate Empire Records. I almost didn't like it myself. It's the characters. Not the actors, they were all pretty decent. But the characters themselves, and the way they were written. So many of them are initially annoying and of-putting, that I almost was dead-set on disliking them from the start. As the movie went on, that slowly began to change. I started to see a bit more of the humans beneath these initially shallow characters. It's only deep in a Breakfast Club kind of way, so don't expect a deep study on the human condition. If you can't stomach the characters, you haven't missed very much. But, if you can, there's a mildly interesting (but throughly frivolous) tale to be seen. Plus, you get to see Renée Zellweger actually looking semi-attractive. Who would have ever guessed that was possible?",6,0,0,22 March 2010
Garden State," One of 2004's best movies.
","'I'm okay with being unimpressive. I sleep better.'Watching Garden State makes me seriously nostalgic, even though it's not very old at all. It reminds me of my early years in college, when I was just being exposed to movies like this, and music like the tunes on the soundtrack. But I don't think the entire reason I like this movie can be chalked up to nostalgia.Garden State is made for people who like melancholy movies about disaffected young adults. Which is not to say that it's glacial or depressing, there's actually a lot of humor. But if you enjoy more manic, lighthearted relationship movies, you'll do well to avoid this and save yourself some boredom.For the rest of us, Garden State is a breath of fresh air. I never would have guessed that Zach Braff could have pulled something like this off, but he certainly nailed the unfocused pointlessness that many people in their mid-twenties may feel. Fans of Natalie Portman will be pleased, as well, because she's great in this. Recommended.",8,1,2,8 September 2010
Donnie Brasco," Well-told true story about a mob informant.
","'I'm not becoming like them, I am them.'Donnie Brasco is a true crime story of a federal agent who infiltrated the Bonanno crime family over a period of years, ultimately resulting in a lot of successful prosecutions. I'm not usually the biggest fan of these kinds of movies, but the cast makes Donnie Brasco pretty interesting, even for those who might not be into it, normally. Johnny Depp, Al Pacino, Michael Madsen, and other less-known (but still great) actors fill Donnie Brasco with performances that keep it as realistic as the subject matter deserves. It's nice to see Depp take on roles that are grounded in reality, because they prove that he's pretty good at just plain old acting. No eccentric characters required. And as good Al Pacino movies have become pretty rare these days, it's nice to be reminded that the guy is still brilliant at what he does when he gets good material to work with.",6,0,1,2 March 2011
The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo," Completely exceeded my expectations, the buzz about this movie is totally justified.
","'You don't know my family. You don't know what they're capable of. 'A disgraced reporter is hired by a wealthy older man to investigate the mysterious disappearance and possible murder of his favorite niece many years ago. The reporter, Mikhail, is eventually joined by a emotionally damaged young and mysterious computer hacker named Lisbeth. They both face a considerable amount of danger as they dig into the girl's death and the many secrets of her family.The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo was very good. Even better than I expected. I have no experience with the book (yet) so I can't make that comparison, but judging the movie only on it's own merits leaves very little doubt that it's high quality in every way. It's a murder mystery and suspense thriller (the best of those genres that I've seen in quite a while) that's outright brutal to watch at times.  The story is riveting, and I found myself wanting to know what happened to young Harriet back in 1966 as much as any of the characters in the movie did. Lisbeth and Mikael were two excellent and complex protagonists who are expertly played by their respective actors, the entire movie is thrilling and engaging, and the ending was satisfying. This was an excellent movie overall, and I recommend it to anyone who likes murder mysteries and can handle some pretty graphic and violent scenes.",9,4,9,20 August 2010
Resident Evil: Apocalypse," Mindless (but fun) action.
","I'm a fan of the Resident Evil movies. They're clearly made by people who are not overly concerned with sticking closely to the video games, and I think that's a good thing. The series boils down to basically a few action flicks with a sprinkling of zombies and Milla Jovovich. Apocalypse is pretty similar to the other two Resident Evil movies, only it's set in the same city that the second and third Resident Evil games are in. There are enough familiar names and cameos to keep fans invested in the plot and its hodge-podge of movie clichés. As ridiculous as it is to see little, 100 pound Milla fighting a 400 pound monster or outrunning an explosion, it somehow works amongst all the other ridiculous stuff that's going on. I love all the casting, (except for the Mike Epps stereotypical character) and Jill and Alice are hot and tough enough to keep the movie interesting. Apocalypse is not frightening or mind-blowing, but I just can't help but enjoy a video game movie that is fun to watch.",7,1,2,6 April 2010
Mulholland Drive," Prepare to go off the deep end...and love every second of the trip.
","'Silencio'.An aspiring actress from out of town (Naomi Watts), a film director suffering from a series of bad luck (Justin Theroux), and a mysterious woman with a purse full of money, amnesia from an accident, and people searching for her (Laura Elena Harring), all intersect in Los Angeles. But something seem odd. Off. Strange. What's going on, and how are these people connected?Naomi Watts is my favorite actress, so there's absolutely no excuse for it to have taken so long for me to see this movie. Especially considering how fantastic Mulholland Drive is, and how great she is in it. From the very beginning, you have no idea what's going on. Strange things occur, and you're left wondering what in the heck is happening and who these people are. But the ambiguity never becomes frustrating. It only serves to make you more and more eager to continue on and see what everything is leading to. I literally said out loud at least three times, 'I have no idea what's going on, but this is awesome.' It's been a while since a movie has caught my attention so strongly from the very beginning and held it to the very end.Despite my adoration for Mulholland Drive, I'm vaguely aware of the fact that some people might find this movie 'too weird'. As I mentioned before, you're given a lot of scenes without the initial context to make sense of them, and I know that can annoy some people. The film is also quite surreal, at times, and while I may have found that scenes like those at the corral and Club Silencio (and really the entire last half-hour) to be incredible, I can (sort of) understand that they may be just flat out odd to some folks. So be warned, this movie is DIFFERENT. And yes, the all-caps really is necessary. If you only like your movies literal and straight-forward, do yourself a favor and choose a different movie.  I don't hand out ratings this high very often, but Mulholland Drive leaves me no choice. It's was so unexpectedly and unconventionally amazing (especially if it's your first David Lynch film, as it was for me), that I have no doubts that it's one of the best movies I've ever seen. It's startling, mesmerizing, and it'll bend your mind so far that it may never snap back to its original shape. I've seen nothing else like it. I'll admit that I can't help but wonder what the story would have been like without the hard left turn 2/3's of the way through (otherwise you'd be looking at a perfect rating), but this movie is a gem.",9,2,3,30 July 2010
The Evil Dead," Raimi's classic horror film is still worth checking out.
","'We're gonna get you. We're gonna get you.'The Evil Dead is ultra low-budget, ultra gory, and ultra entertaining. I recently saw the Night of the Demons remake, which has a similar premise to this movie, (group of young people trapped in a house with demons and forced to try to survive until dawn) and I hated it. It's impressive how Evil Dead did right what Night of the Demons failed at miserably so many years later (and with the advantage of a bigger budget, I'm sure). As the number of survivors in this horror flick fall to one, Ash (Bruce Campbell) is driven close to madness as he's forced to fight off the nightmarish attacks of his former friends, who have all become possessed Deadites. The demon-like creatures aren't content with just trying to kill him, they seem to take great joy in torturing him mentally as much as possible The special effects and make-up are extremely well done. The Deadites all look quite gruesome, and there's a great sense of foreboding atmosphere before they even appear. It bears repeating how great all this looks, considering how low of a budget it had. Even if it wasn't as entertaining as it is, it still would be worth seeing just as an example of what can be done with creativity and not very much money.",7,0,2,19 December 2010
Kill Bill: Vol. 1," Impressive Style and Substance
","The clearest indicators for how much I like a movie are these two things; how many times I can watch it in a short time period, without it losing its appeal, and the number of things in a movie that I think could be changed or removed in order to make it better. The first volume of Kill Bill does better in those aspects than any other movie I've ever seen. This is the best representation of what I feel are Tarantino's best qualities as a writer and director, with not a glimmer of the (admittedly minor) problems I can have with him. The soundtrack is stylish, cool, and fits every scene like a glove. The action shifts tone from brutally realistic, to gloriously over-the-top, while always perfectly complimenting the story being told. The cast is perfect. The characters are memorable. The story is simple, but effective, and the manner in which it is told only serves to enhance it. There's no other way to say it, I simply love the movie. Others may not agree, and I certainly acknowledge that Kill Bill Volume 1 may not appeal to everyone, but I don't think I'll ever be able to get enough of it. This is my favorite movie, ever.",10,1,3,13 March 2010
Ip Man," Don't hesitate, see this now!
","Ip Man is an excellent martial arts film that combines some of the best fight scenes on film with a great story that's involving, occasionally amusing, stirring, powerful, and true. The movie is split into two parts: the beginning, where we're introduced to Ip Man, his family, his city, and his style of martial arts, and the second half, which chronicles the struggles and hardship of the characters after the Japanese invasion of World War 2. The tone of both halves is very different, but they both work equally well. And there are lots of fantastic fight sequences in both, though those in the second half are for far higher stakes than those in the first. Great acting, beautiful sets, and perfectly suited music accompany the strong story and fight choreography. It's no exaggeration to say that it's really hard to find fault in this movie. If you're at all interested in martial arts or this period in China's history, see Ip Man as soon as possible.",8,0,0,2 July 2011
Clash of the Titans," A soulless remake with little to offer beyond loads of special effects.
","'I can't become like them. If I do this, I do it as a man.'No one can say that this remake of Clash of the Titans is just a retread, that's for sure. Some of the people and events remain the same, but most of this new version is a completely different movie altogether. Different, but not very good.CG is used liberally. Everywhere you turn there's a CG monster or a special effect. But that doesn't change the fact that Clash of the Titans feels like nothing more than an empty action movie flavored with the story of Perseus and a conflict between men and the Greek gods. We're moved from one unimpressive action scene to another without any reason to care about what happens to the protagonists, and all the giant scorpions in the world didn't keep this from feeling boring and ultimately pointless.I thought that Sam Worthington was decent in Avatar, but here he's bland and dull as Perseus. Liam Neeson (who seems to be in every other movie these days) has very little to do, and is basically wasted. The same goes for Ralph Fiennes. Gemma Arterton just looks pretty and serves as the generic knowledgeable guide that these kinds of movies seem obligated to have. The surprisingly decent cast was basically thwarted at every turn by a poor script that put little effort into presenting interesting characters.Big action movies can be a lot of fun, but not when they're this uninspired. Clash of the Titans is an inferior effort. Not just in comparison to the original movie, but to the entire genre, in general. See it if you must, but I doubt you'll be eager to view it a second time.",3,4,5,26 August 2010
Paranormal Activity," A refreshing horror movie that deserved its success:
","I would have given Paranormal Activity a slightly higher score, but for two reasons:1. I didn't get to watch it in the conditions that are best for a horror movie. and...2. The movie was spoiled for me long before I got to see it. Very lame. Despite those two things, I ended up liking Paranormal Activity a bunch. The idea and execution were very well done, and going with two unknown actors really added to the realism of the project. If any of the events Katie and Micah experienced ever happened to me in real life, I'd be terrified, and I thought they did a pretty convincing job of appearing as confused and freaked out as I would have been.This kind of horror won't work for everyone, as it relies a lot on tension and a sense of immersion.  If you can't put yourself in the place of the two main characters, then Paranormal Activity won't do much for you. But if you're brave enough to watch it at night and alone, there's a good chance that your imagination will make the rest of the night...interesting, for you.",7,1,2,29 May 2010
Mission: Impossible II," What should be impossible is making a movie this ridiculous.
","'Just stay alive. I'm not going to lose you.'What was John Woo and Tom Cruise thinking? Or should I say, what were they smoking? How could they have not realized what a disaster they were involved in making? If I would have seen this at a theater, I don't know if I would have walked out after 15 minutes, or if I would have stayed just to see how much more absurd this thing could possibly get.Mission Impossible 2 is nothing like the first movie or MI:3. For starters, those movies were actual good. The script for MI:2 was absolutely horrendous. We're expected to believe deep relationships exist between characters because they met, talked for all of 5 minutes, had a random car chase, and then immediately had sex. Some (most) of the dialogue was embarrassing to hear; I'm almost certain that it had to be just as embarrassing to say. Tom Cruise just grinned his way through the movie. Thandie Newton was completely wasted. The villain was too generic for me to even remember his name. The rest of the cast might as well not exist.  John Woo went waaay overboard with 'stylistic' flourishes that are so ridiculous that they were genuinely funny. I mean, some of the stunts and action set-pieces are just surreal versions of what a 10 year-old boy thinks would be cool. Pointless slow motion. Doves. More pointless slow motion. More doves. And yet, somehow the movie was still boring. It shouldn't be possible for a movie with this many explosions and shoot-outs and absurd scenarios to be dull, but they somehow pulled it off. I guess that counts as an accomplishment. Congratulations?Mission Impossible 2 was just dreadful. It's not stylish, it's a cheesy, over-the-top in all the wrong ways, string of ridiculous, artistically empty scenes. It could have been campy fun if it would have been presented in a tongue-in-cheek manner, but Woo was dead serious about all this nonsense. Even the IMF couldn't salvage an enjoyable experience out of this mess.",3,1,3,3 July 2010
The Adjustment Bureau," Fated to be average at best.
","I had high, high hopes for The Adjustment Bureau. Emily Blunt and Matt Damon are both among my favorite actors, and early inklings of the plot made it seem similar to Dark City in all the right ways. Two desperate lovers being kept apart by a shadowy, powerful group that seems to hold the reigns of fate, itself.Those high hopes were not realized. The Adjustment Bureau is by no means a bad movie, but it's just so ordinary and unimaginative that it comes off as a watered-down love story/thriller instead of the exciting, tense struggle it could have been. Damon and (especially) Blunt aren't really given anything substantial to do. There's an interesting sequence or two near the end, but the rest of the movie is so pedestrian that the fantastical premise is mostly wasted. See it if you are a fan of the leads, but don't expect more than a very standard thriller with little sense of tension or depth.",6,0,1,2 January 2012
The Hangover Part II," Diminishing returns.
","Same exact concept, mostly the same hijinks, but not nearly the same payoff. That's The Hangover Part II in a nutshell. This time, the 'wolf pack' ends up in Thailand for Stu's wedding, and once again things go horribly wrong and an entire night (and another person) are lost in a haze of substances, carnage, and bad behavior. And just like in the first movie, most of Part II is spent with the guys trying to piece together what happened the night before, get everyone back safe before the wedding, and just generally not die. This is a pretty unnecessary sequel, and it shows. It's just not early as funny as the first movie, the characters are less likable and more annoying, and the whole thing just feels stale.",5,0,0,14 December 2011
Friends with Benefits," More friends with more benefits.
","Friends with Benefits is much funnier and raunchier than your average romantic comedy. What really makes it work is the on-screen chemistry between Mila Kunis and Justin Timberlake, who have both never been more charismatic or appealing than they are here. The two keep things interesting (and sexy) even when the story takes a turn for familiar territory. Which it inevitably does. Two attractive friends decide to have a strictly physical arrangement in order to avoid the typical complications of a relationship, but things inexorably get messy when feelings start to encroach, despite their best attempts to keep things casual. We're hardly in spoiler territory, here, and while the story isn't revolutionary, there are enough wrinkles in it to keep it from feeling stale. And as I said before, Kunis and Timberlake are so likable that just having them on the screen is entertaining. The first half of the movie is quite amusing, too, though that gets toned down some as things get more serious. In the battle of 'friends having sex movies' between this, Love and Other Drugs (admittedly, that movie ultimately goes for a very different vibe) and No Strings Attached, Friends with Benefits is definitely the winner in my opinion. Both guys and girls should have a good time with this.",7,0,1,8 December 2011
Annie Hall," The kind of movie that makes you feel smarter after you watch it.
","Before Annie Hall, I had only seen the more recent Woody Allen movies. Vicky Cristina Barcelona (very good), Match Point (good), and Scoop (awful). Needless to say Annie Hall was a bit of a shock. It was was very different from those later Allen films. I love how Woody is unafraid to throw any and everything at the viewer. Any story-telling device or technique that he wants to use, he just goes for it. Talking directly to the audience, flashbacks, asides, they all combine to tell the story of a relationship - piece by piece. This isn't a straightforward narrative, and it's a better movie as a result. Every time I thought things were beginning to bog down a little, some awesome joke or interesting narrative flourish would come out of nowhere and jolt my interest back into what was going on. That's how you make a relationship movie interesting for those who typically avoid these kinds of flicks.Take all those complimentary things I've just said and wrap them in the kind of bittersweet, memorable ending that I love, and you have Annie Hall in a nutshell. I never really appreciated how smart Woody is, before i watched this. It's funny and intelligent and full of the kind of references and jokes that makes me wish I could write this kind of thing. Great movie.",8,0,0,31 May 2010
"Girl, Interrupted"," Ryder and Jolie anchor this genuinely interesting movie about 18 months in a mental institution.
","'Was I ever crazy? Maybe. Or maybe life is.'Based on the non-fiction novel of the same name, Girl, Interrupted is about a young woman in the 60's named Susanna (Winona Ryder) who is encouraged by her parents to enter a mental institution for a short time after she attempts to commit suicide. As the short stay ends up turning into a much longer one, Susanna has to make an actual attempt to deal with her issues, or risk becoming like the near-permanent residents of mental hospital she a patient in.Most of this non-linear movie revolves around Susanna's relationships with the women she meets during her stay, including the volatile and sociopathic Lisa (Angelina Jolie), anti-social Daisy (Brittany Murphy), with her odd fixations, and child-like Polly (Elisabeth Moss). I don't know how accurate each woman's behaviors were to their actual conditions, but it was interesting seeing that what Susanna says at one point during the movie was actually true; that the people in the hospital really did and wanted the same things that we all do, only to an extreme.I hope I'm not making Girl, Interrupted sound like some documentary on mental health, because that's not what it is at all. It's about one young woman and how her stay in this place with these women changed her and how she handled her own life. I thought it was pretty good. It portrays its subject matter frankly but respectfully, and the story doesn't drown in melodrama or sentimentality, as this kind of movie easily could have. Ryder, Jolie, and the rest of the cast were all great, and my attention was held from beginning to end. Recommended.",7,1,1,14 September 2010
Men in Black," Sci-fi comedy done right.
","Few movies take me back to my childhood like Men in Black does. I used to absolutely love this movie, and I basically had every word of dialogue memorized, at one point. It's still mostly as fun and funny as I remember, from when I first went to the movies to see it in the late 90's.Will Smith and Tommy Lee Jones really make a great on-screen team. They play off each other flawlessly, and I couldn't picture any other actors playing the roles of J and K. The story isn't exactly amazing, but the special effects and alien designs still hold up pretty well, today. Men in Black has aged very well, and is still an enjoyable sci-fi action comedy.",8,1,1,11 April 2010
Pride & Prejudice," Another fine movie made from an Austen classic.
","Pride & Prejudice is a more than adequate adaptation of Jane Austen's perhaps most famous book. It marries her classic writing with an excellent cast, great sets, and beautiful cinematography.For me, the movie begins and ends with Keira Knightley. If she wasn't in it, I doubt I ever would have been compelled to watch it. But knowing how good of an actress she is and how she excels in period movies like this, I was happy to give it a shot. And she was wonderful, as usual. It's hard to imagine a better modern actress to portray Elizabeth Bennett. She was, of course, supported on all sides by fine performances from Donald Sutherland, Rosmaund Pike, Judi Dench, and several others. But it was undoubtedly Knightley's show, and there was nary a hitch to be seen. The other standout element in Pride & Prejudice is the dialogue. This is no surprise, as the script was lifted directly from Austen's lauded prose. Good writing made the novel a favorite for over 200 years, and it makes this movie a success, as well. I can't imagine anyone who has enjoyed the book thinking that this is anything other than a fine adaptation, all around.",7,0,1,7 July 2010
Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind," If you're looking for a movie that feels genuine and different, you're in luck.
","'What a loss to spend that much time with someone, only to find out that she's a stranger.'Would you want to erase your most painful experiences from your memory, if you could? Heartbreaks, disappointments, regrets, all gone over the course of a night? Is there any value in memories from a failed relationship?Feel free to come to your own answers about all that, but Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind has it's own POV to share. After the relationship between Joel (Jim Carrey) and Clementine (Kate Winslet) comes to a messy end, she decides to have it all deleted from her mind at a clinic that specializes in that sort of thing. Upon finding out that he's essentially been erased, Joel opts to have the same procedure done. As he's lying comatose, trapped in his own disappearing memories of the woman that, for a time, he loved, he starts to wonder if he has made the right decision. Maybe some memories of Clementine are worth holding on to. I like this movie. It's smart, it's thoughtful, it's inventive, it's harsh, and it's touching. The cinematography is beautiful, and all the little transitions and visual flourishes that happen as Joel loses his memories are pretty cool. Winslet is as great as always, Carrey pulls off an excellent, understated (for him) performance, and a bevy of solid supporting actors are present in the side-stories that compliment the primary tale of Joel and Clementine.My personal favorite thing about the movie was seeing a relationship in reverse, from ending to beginning. You see the cracks shrink and smooth over, but the seeds were there from the very start. Is it worth it to try again, armed with the both the knowledge of what to avoid, and the knowledge that history may inevitably repeat itself? I don't know. But, I do know that this movie is well worth the hour and forty-eight minutes it takes to watch it. Recommended.",8,1,3,6 September 2010
Alice in Wonderland," Should have been called Johnny in Burtonland.
","'All this talk of blood and slaying has put me off my tea.'I'm generally supportive of continuations/re-imaginings of well-known stories and movies. If the new chapter turns out well, great! If it doesn't, you can always just ignore it and pretend that it never existed. Alice in Wonderland falls somewhere in-between those categories. It's worth-while enough to justify its own existence, but not good enough to stand beside the original stories, or the excellent Disney animated movie.This movie seems more like an excuse to revisit the cool characters of the original stories, than a proper stand-alone movie. Some of them are great, like the Chesire Cat and the Red Queen. Others...well let's just say that I thought it was a horrible idea to turn the Mad Hatter into a major character and base so much of the movie around him. I understand WHY Disney made the choice to go in that direction (look at all the money it made them), but I thought that character was just horrible. Every scene he was in seemed like a forced parody of what Alice in Wonderland should be.That's a microcosm of my main complaint with the movie. Too much of the charm and cleverness of Carroll's writing was 'Burtoned' out of the movie, and replaced with Tim's always noticeable style. I'm not asking for him to unimaginatively copy the style of the source material, but whenever Johnny Depp was on the screen, the movie usually ceased resembling anything like Alice in Wonderland. On the positive side, I thought Mia Wasikowska made a fine Alice (though the 'finding herself' subplot seemed completely tacked on and under-developed). Some of the backgrounds and CGI were great. And as I said before, I thought the Chesire Cat and Red Queen were excellent. I had a decent time watching it...once I let go of my previous expectations and accepted the fact that this was going to be another example of Burton being Burton. For better, or for worse.   I found myself wanting to like the movie, even in the face of its not so great aspects. Maybe if Burton could have reigned in his typical excesses a bit more, this could have been a great movie. As it stands, this is just another entry in The Wacky Adventures of Depp and Burton. With a slight Alice in Wonderland flavor.",5,0,6,20 June 2010
Avatar," A technical benchmark.
","One thing about Avatar is unconditionally true, it's a technical marvel. My mind staggers at the thought of how much creativity and hard work went into the creation of Pandora. From the plants, to the animals, to the faces of the humanoid characters, Avatar is stellar. And the way it's all integrated together with the human characters makes it even more impressive.As for the rest of the movie, it's good enough to not detract from the visuals. The story is a tried-and-true favorite. Sigourney Weaver, Sam Worthington, and the other cast members are fine, whether they're in Navi bodies or their own. My main complaint with the movie was how cartoonishly evil the main villain was. It's a bit hard for me to swallow such a 2-D antagonist, these days. Otherwise, this is a solid adventure movie with some of the prettiest computer animation that you'll ever see.",8,3,5,21 May 2010
Drag Me to Hell," A funny, dark, and gross horror flick.
","Drag Me to Hell is not slow-paced by any stretch of the imagination. It's a literal onslaught of shocks and gross-outs. Some parts of the movie work better than others, but it was by far the most memorable of the horror movies that I've seen this year. I'm sure that die-hard Raimi fans probably have a different opinion about his unique little humorous touches, but as a casual fan I found his little flourishes occasionally distracting. I know that horror movies often benefit from some humor, but some scenes (the anvil in particular) just felt unnecessary. Drag me to Hell is also loud. I mean LOUD. You will jump. A lot. And not necessarily because you're afraid. You may just be jumping because it sounds like a fully-loaded freight train is about to come crashing from the speakers. Some of the frights are genuine, but your body will slowly become numb to the quick-cut jump scares, and by the end of the movie they really won't affect you much anymore. At least that's the way it was for me. The story is cool enough, but a few of the plot devices are all too familiar. The certain length of time to break the curse before it's too late for the protagonist, the desperate séance at the end of the movie, and the last second twist that's pretty much telegraphed to the viewer with more that 30 minutes left to go. Do those things spoil the movie? No. I actually enjoyed DMTH a lot. But these ticky little flaws stand out when the rest of the movie is so enjoyable.I thought the Alison did really well, and her beastly tormentor was suitably freaky. The old gypsy woman was a scene-stealer. She was equally frightening and disgusting. There's also a memorable goat that I would have loved to see for a longer period of time. Raimi really makes the curse seem horrible, and we can completely understand our heroine's (I use that word quite loosely) desperation to put an end to it. DMTH pushes the right buttons most of the time, and it's a really good movie to watch with your girlfriend or a few of your buddies. It's not perfect, but don't let the few flaws that I've pointed out stop you from seeing a pretty cool horror flick.",7,2,4,14 July 2010
There's Something About Mary," A comedy worth watching repeatedly.
","It's the rare comedy that's even funnier the second time you watch it, than it was the first. Something about Mary fits that definition perfectly. It's one of the most memorable Ben Stiller comedies, for a lot of reasons. The story itself isn't something that we haven't seen been before, but it's told exceptionally well and flows quickly from hilarious situation to hilarious situation. Ben Stiller and Cameron Diaz have great on-screen chemistry, even though a lot of their time is spent with their equally funny co-stars. And it's nice to be reminded of how gorgeous she was in her younger days.  Be prepared to wince and cover your eyes a few times, because some of the funniest moments in the movie are also the hardest to watch. Overly tanned boobs, painful crotch accidents, and masturbation jokes, are all par for the course. Something about Mary is raunchy, hysterical, and worth watching again and again.",8,0,1,21 March 2010
Up," A colorful delight.
","My favorite Pixar movies are the ones who have (in my opinion) the very best characters. Monsters, Inc., Toy Story, Finding Nemo, The Incredibles, etc. My least favorites are the few that have the most uninteresting characters, like Cars. Not to say that Cars is a bad movie, but it didn't leave a memorable impression on me like those other movies did. Up fits somewhere in-between those two categories. It has some great characters, they just don't happen to be the main ones.I'll just come out and admit it - I thought Russell was an annoying little brat. Carl was a likable enough protagonist, but Russell really hurt the movie, for me. Kevin and Dug, on the other hand, are a big part of why I still ended up liking the movie a good bit. They're some of the most flat-out hilarious characters that Pixar has ever made. Most of the comedy in Up involves one of those two animals, in some way.This is a beautiful movie, no one can deny that. It's so bright, vivid and colorful, that anyone who's watching it on DVD or an SDTV is really missing out. Up is basically a commercial for running out to get a shiny new HDTV and a Blu-Ray player. This movie is an absolute visual and technical marvel, and it's also a good family film. Pixar's record of quality remains spotless.",7,0,0,16 April 2010
National Treasure," A solid (if unremarkable) adventure movie.
","'Why can't they just say, 'go to this place, and here is the treasure; spend it wisely'?'Let's start with the most important thing: that Riley character was extremely annoying. He's officially in my annoying character hall of fame. I don't know if be was supposed to be funny, or what, but the parts of the movie where he kept his mouth closed were my very favorites. Just had to put that out there. As for the actual review, it's hardly a secret that I'm not much of a Nicholas Cage fan. His method of acting seems to be just playing the same character in nearly every movie of his that I've seen, from Gone in 60 Seconds to Ghost Rider. Needless to say, I didn't see National Treasure because of him. I did want to see more of Diane Kruger's movies, however, and the trailer made it seem like a more fun version of The Da Vinci Code, so I thought I'd give it a try. And that's basically what it turned out to be. It didn't change my opinion of Mr. Cage's acting skills, but I liked it. National Treasure is a combination of a heist film, an adventure film, and a historical mystery, wrapped in a friendly, summer blockbuster wrapper. It moves along quite quickly, and stays fairly interesting (as well as slightly predictable) from beginning to end. Lots of conspiracy threads about the nation's founders and the Freemasons are drawn together in a way that would make Dan Brown proud, but it never suffers from the forced grasps at importance that the two Robert Langdon movies have unfortunately buckled under. If you're looking for a family-friendly adventure movie that gives history a fantastical spin, you could do a lot worse than National Treasure.",6,0,1,8 July 2010
How to Train Your Dragon," A pleasant family movie.
","'You see, most places have mice or mosquitoes. We have...dragons.'How to Train Your Dragoni is a fairly typical, but fun, animated movie. It's not among the best that I've seen, but it's certainly entertaining enough to give a shot, especially if you have kids.The story is a blend of the usual stuff you get from these kinds of movies: the 'different' hero who doesn't fit in, the love interest that's won over by the finale, and a misunderstanding to overcome and unite the dragons and Vikings by the end against a common threat. Some of the humor fell flat, but that's really the only criticism worth mentioning. The voice talent was very good, and the visuals were beyond good. All the unique designs for the different kinds of dragons were pretty cool, as well. Those things plus the pretty thrilling ending will keep adults from being bored, and kids will probably be sold from the very beginning. How to Train Your Dragon may not do anything new or exceptionally well, but it's a likable movie, nonetheless.",6,1,8,19 October 2010
The Descent," Some of the best modern horror to be found.
","The Descent is a movie of several different kinds of fear. Fear of oppressing, endless darkness. Claustrophobic fear of being trapped in small space miles under the surface, with possibly no way out. Fear of unknown, bloodthirsty monsters. Fear of your own companions and their actions.I've seen this so many times that I shouldn't be frightened by it anymore, but I certainly am. It's the atmosphere and the uncomfortable ease that you can find yourself drawn into this unknown cave system with these women, their underlying issues, and the unseen terrors in the dark. I keep watching it again because it's so entertaining, even beyond the normal parameters of a horror movie.The Descent dabbles successfully in both primal and psychological horror, features a setting that would inspire panic without any additional enemies, and sticks a great cast right in the middle of it. There will never be a horror movie that appeals to absolutely everyone (the nature of fear is too subjective for that), but this is one of the few movies in the genre that I think comes close to being universal. If you have any slight interest in horror of any kind, you should make seeing this an imperative.",8,2,5,10 July 2010
In Time," Entertaining, but forgettable.
","'The truth is, for a few to be immortal, many must die.'In Time is a decent action movie, but nothing more. It's enjoyable for an afternoon, but never rises above disposable entertainment. The cast is likable. Timberlake and Seyfried have good chemistry, even though Timberlake occasionally seems like a less than convincing fit. I like the guy as an actor, but he doesn't entirely match the character he's asked to play. To be fair, though, the character (Will) is like an amalgam of every positive protagonist trait in movie history. He's completely selfless, generous, smooth, charming, crafty, and seems to be able to transform into an invincible action hero any time the need arises. That would be tough for any actor to sell. Amanda Seyfried is here only to look hot running around in heels and be won over by the hero. She does a good job, but since those criteria are accomplished by her genetics, wardrobe and the script (in that order), that's only to be expected. Cillian Murphy isn't given anything more than a generic 'tough and relentless, but fair' detective/antagonist role to work with. Vincent Kartheiser, on the other hand, is the one actor in the movie that's absolutely perfectly cast. No one can play a rich d-bag like Vincent. The main problem with In Time is that the script needed a lot more polish. The concept is cool (people are essentially immortal, but every moment after they turn 25 must be 'bought'), but the 'time is literally money' angle could have worked a lot better if it was wielded with a bit more subtlety. Yes, we get that the rich and privileged few are 'living' off of many.  The story hums along at first, but then seems to waver in tone and purpose. What's simple and straightforward at first eventually unravels to the point where even the characters themselves seem to not know what they're doing or why. Timberlake and Seyfried never seem to be in any real danger, and the climaxes are thoroughly anti- climatic (the fight scene between Timberlake and a bad guy in the third act is absolutely, though unintentionally, hilarious).Still, I didn't dislike In Time. It has a lot of flaws and certainly didn't live up to its potential, but if you take it as a faintly ridiculous Bonnie & Clyde-lite action movie with a thick and cheap coat of social issues slapped on, then you can have a good time with it. The movie definitely wants to have substance and a message, though, and it fails at that.",6,0,0,1 May 2012
Thor," Another excellent piece of the Avengers puzzle.
","Thor is an entertaining superhero flick that is thoroughly refreshing, thanks to its source material, which is pretty different from the other superheroes we've seen on the big screen from Marvel's camp. Thanks to Thor's not-from-this-Earth origins, we get a spin on the traditional Norse myths that gives the film a fun fantasy feel. I dug the tone as well, which can be compared to the mix of impressive action and humor that the first Iron Man flick nailed. Chris Hemsworth is a perfect fit as the charismatic, hot-headed Thor, and he's surrounded by an equally impressive cast. Natalie Portman, Kat Dennings, Anthony Hopkins, Idris Elba, Stellan Skarsgard and Tom Hiddleston are all excellent so excellent in their roles that it's a pity we don't get to spend more time with them. Which brings me to my only real problem with the movie, the length and pacing. It felt a little too short to make the character development seem completely authentic. Specifically, Thor's maturation into a wiser man and his relationship with Natalie Portman's character. Given the fact that the movie takes place over a very brief period of time, it makes those two events less than believable if you take the time to think about it. The length of the film just felt too short, though I admit I'd much rather have a tight experience like this than an overlong or boring one. I also felt like the movie peaked in the first act, and never quite rose to that level again. That's not to say that the last two-thirds of Thor isn't good. It is. The movie just becomes less unique and more like other superhero flicks as it progresses. All in all, Thor is a fine piece of entertainment. Whether you're a fan of the character, addicted to superhero movies in general, or you just want to be prepared for the Avengers mega-event that's coming in 2012, you should check this out ASAP.",Null,0,0,16 September 2011
The Fountain," A different side of Darren Aronofsky.
","'Death is a disease. It's like any other. And there's a cure. A cure. And I will find it.'I think Darren Aronofsky is great. He brings a sense of art into each movie he makes, no matter how human, small, and individual his stories may be. The Fountain is different from his other projects, however, because it's almost wholly an art film. It largely leaves conventional storytelling behind and explores love, loss, and fear of mortality through reoccurring images, symbolism, alternating time-lines/realities, and some really fantastic visuals. I have to say that I liked it. It's ambitious and it takes a while to get a handle on, but it captured my interest from the very beginning. There were moments when The Fountain brought to mind a Guillermo del Toro movie, times when it felt like pure Aronofsky, and then scenes that reminded me of nothing I've seen previously. Hugh Jackman gives a commendable, fragmented performance as the three main characters in their three variations of the story. But it's Rachel Weisz who plays the only character in the film that we really get to know a part of, and she's the anchor of the overall story. I gained a healthy respect for both actors, while watching this. On the whole, I found The Fountain to be a worthy experience. There's something lacking, though. I can't say what it is, exactly. The movie felt a little too loosely connected, as if the theme binding it together wasn't tied quite as tightly as it should have been.I predict three different possible reactions to The Fountian. Person A will watch about 15 minutes of it, quickly realize it's not for them, and turn it off. Person B will appreciate what Aronofsky tried to do, but feel that The Fountain is ultimately a flawed effort. Person C will enjoy the movie and want to see it again several times, despite niggling concerns that it's not quite all it had the potential to be. I'm Person C. I loved the cinematography and had a very positive reaction to all the metaphysics and existential themes (which isn't always the case, despite the fact that I was a philosophy major in college). It's not the typical Aronofsky film and it's not his best (The Wrestler) or his most complete (Black Swan), but it's definitely his most ambitious.",7,1,3,9 March 2011
Zombieland," Zombies!! Entertainment!! Fun!!
","It's been quite a while since I've seen a good zombie movie. The last one I saw was Land of the Dead, which was so horrid that it completely put me off the genre for a while. Thankfully, Zombieland came along to remind me of why I like these kinds of movies so much.Zombieland doesn't try to make any grand social statements, or critique the ills of modern day society. It's just a funny, enjoyable ride. The small cast is uniformly great, the story zips along at a lively pace, and (maybe most importantly) lots and lots of zombies meet their end in violent and creative ways. This isn't a revolutionary movie, by any means. It doesn't do anything that hasn't been seen before in the genre, but does everything it borrows, fairly well. Bring on the sequel!",7,0,1,3 April 2010
Psycho," A classic in every sense of the word.
","It's hard to imagine a black and white movie from 1960 with no cursing, no blatant violence, and very little action, being epic, but Psycho definitely deserves that description. Even with a basic prior knowledge of what was going to happen, I was still completely enthralled by the whole thing. It takes several different turns in tone and content throughout, but it's all consistently well done. There are very few better examples of the words thriller and mystery than this one. I used to absolutely hate older movies, but Psycho is proof that all the things that I love about movies now, were alive and well many years ago. I was absolutely startled and freaked put a few times during the film, and that's one of the finest compliments that I can give.",9,1,2,10 April 2010
When Harry Met Sally...," The most popular romantic comedy of the late 80's.
","I figured it was about time that I worked my way through some of these older romantic comedies. I'm not the biggest lover of the genre, but I do like a good one, from time to time.  Besides, there are some movies that every movie fan needs to have seen. I've heard that When Harry Met Sally... is one of them, so I'm finally getting around to it. So, what did I think? It was OK. Quite funny in some parts. Billy Crystal and Meg Ryan work well as a couple, and I like the way the movie flitted around their various meetings, before it settled down into the story. The random interviews of couples interspersed in the movie were really cool, too. It wasn't the best movie of this kind that I've seen, but it was good enough that I'm pleased to add it to the list of movies that I've seen. Fans of the genre will probably love it (tbough I'm sure 95% of those people have seen it already), while people like me won't feel like they're wasting their time while watching it.",6,1,2,26 May 2010
Crazy Heart," The Weary Kind would have been a great title, too.
","Crazy Heart is the story of an aging, alcoholic country music legend whose career has degraded to the point that he's playing bowling alleys instead of arenas. He meets a reporter and her son, who may offer him an opportunity for the kind of happiness that he hasn't had in years. At around the same time, a former protégé offers him a chance to find some substantial success, again. It's a good movie. There's a dusty country-western flavor that will probably appeal to a lot of people, and the three main actors (Maggie Gyllenhaal, Colin Farrell, and Jeff Bridges) all do great jobs. These kinds of films aren't necessarily my favorites, but I always appreciate a well-told story. Crazy Heart definitely satisfies that requirement. If you're a fan of this kind of music or drama, you'll probably enjoy this even more than I did.",7,1,2,20 May 2010
Nick and Norah's Infinite Playlist," A teen romance for the NYC indie rock crowd.
","Nick & Norah is a nice little date movie for indie kids. At times I think that it tried to hard for the 'cool' vibe, but at Nick and Norah's age, didn't we all do the same?Being from a small town and living in a small-ish college city, it's cool to see the nightlife and culture of NYC. It would be pretty awesome to be able to spend a night going from show to show with a sea of faceless people with similar musical tastes. I think I enjoyed that aspect of the movie more than the rather typical love story that was the the primary focus.Michael and Kat were pretty perfect for their parts, but it was Ari Graynor who completely stole the show. Her character was absolutely hilarious. That girl seriously needs to be a bigger star, because she's got great comedic talent. Nick and Norah won't blow you away, but it's guaranteed to appeal to a certain kind of viewer. It's charming, funny, and a breath of fresh air in an overcrowded genre.I recommend it whole-heartedly.",8,0,0,10 July 2010
Army of Darkness," Not exactly the continuation I was hoping to see.
","'Honey, you got real ugly.'I thought The Evil Dead and Evil Dead 2 were fantastic. Their low budgets didn't preclude them both from being some pretty entertaining horror movies in their own unique ways. Army of Darkness totally eschews all pretense of being a horror movie, and goes solely for a campy vibe that revolves around Bruce Campbell's character, Ash. This will be right up some people's alleys, but I can't say I loved the change. As the movie picks up where Evil Dead 2 left off, Ash is transported back through time. The evil of the Deadites and the power of the Necronomicon still wait for him in England's Dark Ages, however, and he's unwillingly thrust into a battle to save a castle full of people from the an army of undead. Some people will probably welcome the shift in scope and total change in tone, but I really missed the vibe of the first two flicks. Sure, they were way over-the-top and occasionally campy/silly, but Army of Darkness is a completely different animal. I'll stick to the original two films over the silly action hijinks of Army of Darkness.",4,1,3,12 April 2011
Die Hard with a Vengeance," More Die Hard, for better or worse.
","I honestly cannot understand why I don't love the Die Hard series. I'm a Bruce Willis fan and I love action flicks, but these movies just tend to be only average, in my eyes. The fourth entry was fine, the first one was decent, and the second one was alright, at best. Clearly this is a well-loved series, so I'm assuming that the problem must be with me.As for Die Hard with a Vengeance, I'd put it on par with Die Hard 2. Some aspects of the movie worked well. The connections to the story of the first movie were a nice touch, and the pairing of Samuel L. Jackson with Willis effectively turns it into a buddy cop movie. It's more entertaining seeing John McClane interacting with another character, than it is to see him going gung-ho alone. But beyond that, I just didn't think it was very exciting or interesting. There are plenty of late 80's and early 90's action movies that I absolutely love, but I can't add this to that list.",5,1,2,4 June 2010
Stranger Than Fiction," A different side of Will Ferrell.
","I absolutely enjoyed Stranger than Fiction, when I first saw it at the movies a few years ago. It seemed so different from most of the other movies that I had seen by that time. My roommate and I left the theater thoroughly impressed.Alas, I've seen a lot more movies since then, and my tastes have been expanded by all the great movies that I've seen in the years that passed. Don't get me wrong, Stranger than Fiction is still a good movie. I couldn't count the number of small smiles that frequently popped up on my face as I watched it. But now I see that beyond a few clever touches, it's really a pretty pedestrian story. It's greatest strength is the rather unique way that the plot is told, but nothing happens that hasn't happened in a million other films.Will Ferrell was a good choice as the main character, but it's not exactly a demanding role. None of them are. But even though the movie isn't exactly the marvel that I remember it being, I'm still glad that I got a chance to watch it again.",6,0,1,19 April 2010
The Wrestler," Outstanding!
","The Wrestler has been sitting on my computer for the past week or two, and after all the ruckus I've been hearing about Mickey Rourke's performance and his win at the Golden Globes, I thought I should stop being lazy and watch the film. I have to say, there's something to all the adoration that this movie has received. The Wrestler is solid through and through.People who have followed Rourke's career see this as his big comeback. I've personally only seen him in Sin City prior to The Wrestler, so I think my experience with the movie was less tinged with nostalgia than that of a die hard Rourke fan. I'm proud to say that enjoyment of this film certainly doesn't depend on being a Rourke devotee.The Wrestler is filmed in a realistic style that makes it seem almost like a documentary. The realism extends to the wrestling scenes, the dialogue, pretty much everything except the idiots who kept turning down private dances from Marisa Tomei (right, like that would ever happen). In my opinion, the realism is essentially what makes the film work. Rourke's reaction to his circumstances and his interactions with the people in his life are the bread and butter that keeps the film interesting.Speaking of the people in his life, Marisa Tomei and Evan Rachel Wood are simply outstanding. They make the acting invisible and really make the documentary vibe even stronger. Nearly every scene they are in sticks out. They managed to be just as three dimensional as Rourke's character with significantly less screen time. Tomei is officially now one of my favorite actresses (and way too gorgeous to be 44 years old), and Wood is now on my list of talented young actresses to watch.All in all, The Wrestler is a movie that I'm happy to recommend to any and everyone. It has so many memorable scenes: the day that Ram and his daughter spend together, his face as he looks at all the old, washed-up wrestlers at the autograph signing, and let's not forget the entire emotional end sequence. Do yourself a favor and watch The Wrestler, it's a genuine treat.",10,2,4,10 April 2010
The Lion King," The zenith of traditional American animation.
","'A king's time as ruler rises and falls like the sun. One day, Simba, the sun will set on my time here and will rise with you as the new king.'The Lion King was a masterpiece when I was a kid, and it's still a masterpiece, now. It's easily in my personal top ten. It's a movie that every breathing person should see. Other than those things, there are really only three other details you need to know about it. 1. A lot of the better animated movies are known for being enjoyable for both kids and adults, but The Lion King may be the very best example of that description. Children will love the antics of the hyena trio and Timon and Pumbaa, while adults will find the Hamlet-inspired drama to be top-notch.2. The animation is outstanding; from the bright, vivid colors of the characters and scenery of The Pride Lands, to the nightmarish macabre darkness of The Elephant Graveyard. I still don't think that there has been superior traditional animation from the U.S., Japan, or anywhere else. It's dazzling in standard definition, I'm almost drooling at the prospect of the eventual high-def release.  3. If you like the musical aspect of animated movies, you're in luck. While most Disney films have one or two great songs and several good ones, The Lion King is packed with great songs from beginning to end. Nostalgia may be partially to blame, but I can't hear The Circle of Life or Can You Feel the Love Tonight without getting goosebumps.",10,1,2,23 August 2010
Inception," The rare movie that doesn't collapse under its own hype.
","'The dream has become their reality. Who are you to say otherwise?'If I had to sum Inception up in only a few words, I'd say that it was ambitious, complex, original, the special effects were outstanding, and you're going to have to really focus on it to get the full experience.The first half of the movie is spent explaining the rules of the process of stealing and planting ideas. This is necessary, but also entertaining. As you learn the roles of each individuals in the plan, you're slowly being prepared for the second half. And the second half pays off splendidly. It's a cascade of separate characters in different layers of dreams, each with a different reference of time. It all sounds complicated (it is, so pay close attention), but it's also very cool the way it all works together.As for the special effects and action scenes, they were some of the best I've seen. And in a way that didn't suggest computer wizardry. My mind was blown at the sight of an entire city folding back on itself, and there were several other sequences that were comparable. I can't wait for the DVD to find out how this stuff was done without the obvious CGI.The cast was as good as you'd expect, so no worries, there. I'll only go into detail about the three actors I'm personally most interested in. I haven't been this impressed with Leo DiCaprio since I saw Revolutionary Road, the guy was a perfect fit for the role. And I love Ellen Page even more after seeing this. It's nice to see her step outside of Juno, Smart People, and Whip It type roles, and again show that she has some versatility. As for Marion Cotillard, I'll just say that someone needs to get that chick an action role, because she would be epic. She holds a gun and wields a knife like she was born with the things in her hands.I can't help but admit that Inception lived up to the considerable hype. It got better and better as it went along, and most importantly, all the various threads came together and made sense at the end. I can't understate how important that last part is. It's not for everyone (what movie is?), but this is one of the best movies that I've seen this year, and definitely the most ambitious. I'll even go so far as to say that it's behind only The Prestige, among the movies that Christopher Nolan has directed. If you like that one, I have a strong feeling that you'll like Inception, too.",9,4,9,18 July 2010
Sherlock Holmes," Holmes by name, only.
","I don't know if I just saw a Sherlock Holmes movie, or a mash-up of House, M.D. and Harry Potter, set in the nineteenth century. We have a scruffy genius with few social graces, who correctly draws astonishing conclusions from minute details. His long- suffering partner, who constantly (an unwillingly) gets caught up in the schemes of the main character - and despite his frequent exasperation, seems to be the only person who can truly put up with him. And then we have a villain who gains power through seemingly dark magic that is rooted in the deaths of others. Greg House + Voldemort = basically this entire movie. My point is, the protagonist of this movie felt little like the classic character of the great detective only occasionally. I almost wish that they would have scrapped the Sherlock Holmes title entirely, and made this a completely original movie. Is it Robert Downey Jr.'s fault that I see him and think Tony Stark? No. But the fact still remains that as good as he is, he never fit the part for me. He's a great actor, but this wasn't really suited for him. Once you get beyond the title, you'll see that this is a pretty standard adventure movie. There are action sequences sprinkled in liberally, to keep the pace moving, a fairly simple plot, fight scenes, and even a few explosions. And somehow with all that going on, I still was bored and ready for the movie to end, long before it was over. Besides that, Rachel McAdams' character was completely unnecessary and annoying. I know mainstream movies generally need some kind of a love interest for the main protagonist, but Rachel was a complete mismatch for her role. The sense of cleverness that goes into a tale about Holmes was also missing. Every part of the mystery boiled down to some new invention or rare compound that only Holmes and the villain had knowledge of. He was supposed to be a great detective because of his uncanny deductive reasoning, not because he had memorized every random poison on earth. Maybe by the time the inevitable sequel is made, I'll be acclimated to this modern version of Sherlock Holmes. It's great for RDJ's career that he has had so many mega- successful movies in the last few years, but that also makes it much harder for him to disappear into a role. This is one example of his fame being too big for the character.",5,2,4,28 April 2010
Rango," A dusty, quirky western romp.
","'You're a stranger. Strangers don't last long here.'Rango is unique, charming, and off-kilter. When Gore Verbinski and Johnny Depp got involved in an animated movie, chances were good that it would be something different than the usual. And that's exactly what you'll get with this. This is a western adventure at heart, starring a wannabe thespian chameleon who ends up in a drought-stricken town after he's accidentally abandoned on a busy desert highway. The first thing you'll notice are the visuals, which are a cool mixture of detailed realism and stylized elements. It took me a while to get used to how all the characters looked, I've never seen a similar art style. Once I adjusted, though, I really liked the unique look of the film. Older people will probably get more out of Rango than younger kids. There's not much of the slapstick humor of many of the most popular animated films, and much of the movie would fly right over children's heads. The voice talent is excellent and as impressive of a cast as any animated movie I've seen,The story dragged on a bit at times, and it could have been a tighter experience if it was about 10 or 15 minutes shorter, but I'm happy to say that Rango is one of the most refreshing movies of the type that I've seen in a while. Even if you love the Toy Story's, Tangled's, and Despicable Me's of the world (and I certainly do), it's nice to watch something a little different, from time to time. Rango fills that void quite well.",Null,0,0,31 July 2011
Centurion," Romans, blood, and vengeance.
","'Now she hunts Romans. Now we are the prey.'Centurion isn't a historical epic, it's a historical action flick. You won't get the grandeur and scope of a movie like Gladiator, but if you're looking for some violence and would like to substitute swords and arrows for shotguns and Uzis, then you could do a lot worse. Michael Fassbender and Olga Kurylenko star on opposite sides of this movie. Fassbender is a Roman centurion in Britain who has been among the only survivors of two attacks by the warring Picts on his fellow soldiers. Kurylenko is a mute Pictish woman working with the Romans, who turns out to be more than she seems. Both of the stars prove credible in their action scenes, which are the main showpieces of the movie. The battles are what you'd expect from (director) Neil Marshall - visceral, brutal, and with copious amounts of blood. They occur frequently, and they never fail to have a high body count. If you're at all familiar with the story/legend of the Ninth Legion (which Centurion was adapted from), then you know not to expect many of the main characters to survive. You also probably know that there really aren't any true 'good guys'. The Romans are fighting to control the territory they've conquered, and the Picts are fighting for revenge and freedom. Both sides do some terrible things, but the Romans are presented as our main characters here, and therefore, our protagonists. This is a much more simple and conventional movie than Marshall's other work like The Descent and Doomsday, and it's probably his most mainstream flick, as well. But, there's nothing wrong with a straight-forward action movie if it's entertaining. I probably won't rush to own Centurion or see it again, but it was certainly worth seeing once. Fans of Imogen Poots will definitely want to check this out, as she has a nice (if somewhat brief) role.",6,2,4,9 January 2011
Despicable Me," The most fun computer animated movie of 2010? Maybe so!
","'Now, the rest of the plan is simple. I fly to the moon. I shrink the moon. I grab the moon. I sit on the toilet.'Any animated movie that was released during 2010 is inevitably going to be compared to Toy Story 3, so let's get that out of the way, first. No, Despicable Me is not 'better' than Toy Story 3. On an emotional and story-telling level, it's not nearly as profound or involving. But Despicable Me isn't trying to be profound, it's aiming for amusement and entertainment. And on those two fronts, Dreamworks has a definite success on their hands.My favorite thing about Despicable Me is how humorous it is. This is seriously the funniest animated movie that I've seen in quite a while. It has the expected amount of jokes that will give kids (and older people, too) the giggles, as well as lots of comedy that only the grown-up crowd will appreciate. It's fun to see what will pop up next (keep your eyes open for a particularly amusing reference to a particularly un-amusing scene in The Godfather).Despicable Me is also a vivid, bright movie that's pleasing to the eye in all the right ways. The character designs are stylized and fun, the soundtrack is a nice change of pace for this kind of film, and the pacing is excellent, with nary a dull stretch. The voice talent is great, but I will admit that most of them were pretty much unrecognizable. I wouldn't have known that Jason Segel, Kristin Wiig, Russell Brand, Julie Andrews, or Will Arnett were even involved, if not for the credits and the fact that I had read about them beforehand. Steve Carell and Jack McBrayer (in a small but hilarious part) are really the only voices that are easily recognizable. That's not a criticism, just an observation. So yeah, it's pretty clear that I liked this movie a lot. It reminds me most of Monsters, Inc. (a movie I absolutely love) in the way that it combines sweetness and humor in a manner that's never cloying or annoying. Watch it with your kids, watch it with your friends, watch it with your significant other, or watch it by yourself. You'll laugh, you'll cheer, you'll say 'awwww', and you'll fall in love with Agnes, Edith, and Margo even faster than Gru does.",8,7,8,27 January 2011
Carrie," A must see for horror fans.
","'I wanna be normal, I wanna start to try me, a whole person, before it's too late for me to.'What happens when an odd, repressed, emotionally abused teenage girl with telekinetic abilities is pushed past her breaking point by an overwhelmingly humiliating prank pulled by her bullying classmates? A prom night that no one will ever forget. If they happen to survive it, that is. Carrie is an absolute horror classic. It runs the gamut from unsettling, to creepy, to horrifying, and every second of it is enjoyable. If it doesn't freak you out before the end, you're made of sterner stuff than I am. I don't think I'll ever forget the insane zealotry of Carrie's mother or the mesmerizing carnage of the end of the movie, among other scenes, and the best proof of a good horror movie is one that is memorable. This is by far the best Stephen King adaptation that I've seen, and the fact that it was based on his first published book makes it even more impressive. The pacing is perfect, with a perfect build up to the spectacular finale that will have you torn between feeling satisfaction of seeing some horrible people getting their comeuppance, and a genuine horror at the character of Carrie. If you're at all interested in a scary movie that's effective beyond constant jump scares or gore, then you should love this. I sure did. It's quality hasn't diminished in the least by the years that have gone by since it was made. Great camera-work, great score, great movie.",9,2,3,29 September 2010
The Woman in Black," A one-trick pony.
","'Never forgive.A young lawyer (Daniel Radcliffe), widowed from the day of his child's birth, leaves his young son for a few days in London in order to handle the sale of a house in a small village. The villagers are less than welcoming, and the more time he spends there, the more he learns a the tragedy that has and continues to befall the children of the village... and the more he may be putting his own son's life in danger. The Woman in Black is a frustrating movie. For every interesting story turn, there's an irritating flaw that keeps it from being as good as it could have been. My biggest peeve rests on the film's over-reliance on jump scares. They're used so often and predictably that they mostly ruin the effect that the creepy environments manage to muster. It just destroys the immersion factor in a movie for me when there's a loud bang and something suddenly appears in the frame over and over and over. On the positive side, the period setting is a nice change of pace, the story does unravel in an interesting way, and Racliffe does a decent job (though a lot of the time he's just gazing somberly off in the distance or resolutely investigating a suspicious noise, on the way to his next jump scare). The Woman in Black isn't bad, it just doesn't do enough to make itself stand out amongst a dozen supernatural thrillers, and it relies far too much on scare tactics that annoy me far more than they spook me. I don't mean to dissuade anyone from seeing it who's interested, just temper your expectations.",5,1,2,2 June 2012
X-Men: First Class," A fine return to form for a franchise that had begun to lose its way.
","'I've been at the mercy of men just following orders. Never again.'Congrats to Matthew Vaughn for getting the X-Men franchise back on track after the spiraling quality of X-Men 3 and X-Men Origins: Wolverine. First Class is an exciting prequel that changes the tone drastically from the other X-men movies, takes some risks, and delivers a movie that stands with X2 as the best in the franchise. The positives start with the cast, which is almost universally great. You might think that some of the lesser known characters heavily featured in this installment might be a detriment, but it really gives an opportunity to focus on the most important characters: Charles Xavier (James McAvoy), Erik Lenhsherr (Michael Fassbender), Raven Darkholme (Jennifer Lawrence), and Sebastian Shaw (Kevin Bacon, clearly having a ball). The story is tight and interesting throughout. Real life events are weaved through the X-Men universe, grounding the plot in reality in a way that really works. It's easy to follow for newcomers, while there are tons of little things that will leave those familiar with X-Men lore with quick grins on their faces. The movie isn't perfect, however. The plethora of B-characters occasionally lead to clunky action scenes because of the nature of their powers, and some repeated abilities result in sequences that are perhaps a little too reminiscent of precious movies. The film is actually better when it focuses less on big action set-pieces, which is odd for a superhero flick but indicative of how well-written the script is. I also had a problem with Beast, who started out as a great addition to the movie and ended up as somewhat of misfire because of a really poor costume job. It just looked bad. All the other costumes and special effects were fantastic, though.First Class is a total success, in my book. Entertaining throughout, full of memorable moments, and cast exceptionally well. It doesn't feel like the previous X-Men films, but that's not a bad thing. First Class stands on its own despite its prequel status, and turns the franchise around with some timely and fresh ideas.",8,1,3,13 June 2011
Blade Runner," Near flawless sci-fi/noir.
","'It's too bad she won't live. But then again, who does?'(This review is for the Final Cut version of Blade Runner.) It took me two viewings to really appreciate Blade Runner, but once it hit me, it me hit me like a ton of bricks.Out of all the movies that Ridley Scott has done, this is the one that proves without a doubt that he deserves his place as one of the great directors. This is one of the most fully-realized and technically and artistically impressive worlds that I've ever seen created on film. The backgrounds and sets are wonderful. The cinematography is outstanding. Nearly every single shot is visually striking in some manner. Blade Runner's setting is a wildly imaginative glimpse of the future, yet grounded in a gritty reality that's appealing and fits the tone of the movie perfectly. As does the music. As for the story, it's intelligent, engrossing, and perfectly paced. One that you don't have to be a huge fan of sci-fi or noir to enjoy. In broad terms, it's about an ex-police officer who specializes in eliminating artificial humans (replicants), and his efforts to track down four who have illegally come to earth. There's more to it than that, of course, but watching the story unfold and letting it draw you into this alternate future is a pleasure that I wouldn't want to rob from anyone reading this. Just trust me, there are deep themes that are explored here, but the movie is thoroughly entertaining even if you aim to enjoy it on only its most superficial levels. As you may have guessed, this is my favorite Scott film, as well as my favorite Harrison Ford role. It stands out for its memorable and three dimensional characters like the elegant and haunting replicant Rachael and the kind (but creepy) Sebastian. The use of light and shadows throughout the movie gives it a timeless, classic quality. Sci-fi (heck, movies in general) doesn't get much better than this one. Beyond it's own undeniable quality, the genre as a whole has benefited from Blade Runner's influence.",9,2,5,28 July 2010
Casino Royale," Welcome back, Mr. Bond.
","What a wonderful re-start for the Bond franchise! From the opening scene to the end, this movie keeps the entertainment coming. Daniel Craig steps into the role that Pierce Brosnan left, and he does an amazing job playing the new 'realistic' Bond. Eva Green is one of the hottest Bond girls ever, and the lack of gadgets is actually refreshing. Some people may be a little put off by the lack of some of Bond's more gimmicky trademarks (and I have a soft spot for some of those gimmicks, myself), but I would encourage those fans to give this a chance. The Bond franchise had fallen behind the Bourne and Mission Impossible movies in recent years, but Casino Royale puts the super spy firmly back into the mix. It's not just a great Bond movie, it's a great movie. Modern, thrilling, and new...but still undeniably Bond.",8,0,3,20 March 2010
Toy Story 3," If only more movies could be made with this much care and skill.
","'Now you've got to promise to take good care of these guys. They...mean a lot to me.' If this is goodbye to the Toy Story franchise, then it's a fond farewell. There's not much question of whether fans of the previous two movies will like it, or movie fans of any age. The story is amazing, humorous, thrilling, and bittersweet. There's more adventure, heart, and soul in this 'kids' movie than in anything else you're likely to see anytime soon. And if you don't find yourself getting a little emotional at certain points in the story, you're made of sterner stuff than I. It's pretty obvious that this was a labor of love on Pixar's part, and the result is their best movie so far. It's also one of the most visually astounding computer animated films that I've seen. Especially on Blu-Ray. The colors are vivid, everything has brilliant sharpness and clarity, and the level of detail in every toy, human, and background element never ceases to amaze. Toy Story 3 is just utterly beautiful. Not just from a technical standpoint, but as an achievement in artistic style that elevates it to the levels of visual appeal that had until this point been reached only by traditionally animated movies like Spirited Away and a few others.I know that no movie has been (or ever will be) loved by absolutely everyone. But Toy Story 3 is as worthy of approaching that mark as any other movie I've seen. It's guaranteed to get some kind of genuine response from 99% of those watch it: be it a tear, a cheer, or just a big smile. See it. See it with your kids, your significant other, your friends, or just by yourself. You won't regret it.       Goodbye Buzz. Goodbye Woody. Goodbye Andy. We'll miss you, but you'll always be with us.",9,1,1,8 November 2010
La Vie En Rose," The life of a French cultural icon.
","La Vie en Rose did two things for me:1. It made me interested in learning more about the life of Edith Piaf. 2. It made me finally accept that biopics like this are never going to be my thing. The movie was fine, and I have no real criticisms about it beyond the fact that at times I was left wondering who a specific person was, or why a certain thing was happening. But that can probably be attributed to the language barrier and the fact that I knew absolutely nothing about Edith, prior to seeing this. But it was just very difficult for La Vie en Rose to hold my attention. The dramatized lives of Johnny Cash and Ray Charles didn't hold much interest for me, and neither did this.I want to reiterate again that I think the movie itself was fine, I'm just scoring it based on my personal enjoyment of it. Anyone interested in Edith, French film and music, or biopics, may well love it. Even blind eyes could see that Marion Cotillard's portrayal of Edith was astonishing, so fans of hers will probably love this, as well. I just think that I need to abandon this genre, because it doesn't work for me.",5,1,2,19 June 2010
Vicky Cristina Barcelona," A great cast gets the best out of Allen.
","Vicky Cristina Barcelona is a movie of beautiful parts that never quite solidify into an equally pleasing whole. It doesn't have a 'plot', but instead it focuses on the relationships of a few people over a summer in Spain. The narrative focus switches between three main characters as they all seemingly go through changes, only to end essentially where they began. Every actor and actress was cast perfectly. Javier Bardem is beyond charming, and really it's more accurate to say that he embodies the role of Juan Antonio instead of acts it out. Penelope Cruz, Rebecca Hall, and Scarlett Johansson are all so hypnotically beautiful that it's easy to overlook the fact that each of them gives some of the most outstanding performances of their careers. And I can't talk about beauty without mentioning the picturesque scenery of Spain. I wanted to visit there before, but now I think I'd rather travel there than any other place in the world. The theme song, 'Barcelona', was the cherry on top of it all. Each time I heard it during the film, I just had to crack a bit of a smile.The main theme of Vicky Cristina Barcelona is how different kinds of people look for and respond to different kinds of love and relationships. Each person who watches it will probably relate differently to the actions and thoughts of the main characters, because they all represent the various human perspectives of love. They all seem so refreshingly authentic, in an urbane way. There was very little romantic idealization going on (to my relief).Vicky Cristina reminds me a bit of Closer, even though its motif lies in the completely opposite direction. Ultimately there's no resolution, no progress in the lives of the characters. It feels like the viewer simply lived among the characters and viewed their lives for a few months, and then left again. Of course, every movie doesn't have to have a tidy ending to be good, but in this case it's a double-edge sword. The ending was so abrupt that I was left wanting to know more. How (if at all) were the characters changed by their summer? Is it unfair for me to wish for a Vicky Cristina Barcelona...Part 2?",8,1,4,26 March 2010
Beowulf," Beowulf returns to the big screen in a new format.
","'The mother, the hag, she's not my curse. Not anymore.'I think the decision to go entirely with computer animation for this adaptation of Beowulf was a good one. Sure, a live-action movie with practical effects or a mixture of CGI could have been good, but I think the movie stood out more this way, than it would have, otherwise.The animated models look remarkably like their voice actors (you can easily tell who they're based upon, if you didn't know beforehand), and some of the backgrounds and settings are still quite impressive, a few years later. But, that's not to say that the the visuals don't still fall prey to the usual problems that arise when you try to do realistic human animation. Some of the facial expressions look odd, the movement of the characters occasionally seems very jerky and artificial, and almost every pair of eyes looks soulless and dead. As I said, those issues are certainly not unique to Beowulf, but they are here.As for the rest of the movie it's a good action flick that has some humorous moments and enough blood and violence to make it appropriate for teenagers and up. The story really only covers a few events, and there's not much here other than the battles (which are certainly entertaining) and a few talky bits. Don't expect much more than that, and you'll be content. I actually think that Beowolf would have benefited from being made with post-Avatar 3-D technology, but even in 2-D on your TV screen, it's a fun adult adventure.",7,0,0,10 September 2010
Fantastic Mr. Fox," An excellent animated film that will be especially appealing to Wes Anderson fans.
","'If what I think is happening IS happening...it better not be.'I never would have guessed that Wes Anderson would venture into the world of  stop motion animation, but after seeing The Fantastic Mr. Fox, I have to admit that it's a natural fit. I think having the unlimited creative license that animation provides really let him indulge his creativity, and a absolutely great movie was the result.Anderson and Noah Baumbach took the classic Roald Dahl story and greatly expanded the beginning and end, while giving it a unique look and tone that is quite different from other recent animation. It's still essentially about a fox who steals from three local farmers in order to provide from his family, and brings a lot of trouble on all the nearby animals as a result, but the story is now fleshed out beyond that. This is an Anderson movie through and through, with all the eccentric characters, wonderful music, complicated family dynamics, and understated, off-beat humor that the world has come to expect from his work.It's difficult to find any part of Fantastic Mr. Fox to raise a complaint about. The animation, character designs and sets are beautiful, the cast of actors and actresses brought in to do the voice acting were all excellent, and the movie as a whole was just charming. Along with Ponyo and Coraline, I'd say that this is among the best animated films I've seen in quite a while. Even better than Pixar's excellent recent work. I really hope that Anderson makes something like this again in the future.",8,5,9,28 August 2010
X2: X-Men United," Does the X-Men justice in every way.
","X2 is everything a movie sequel should be. It takes all the good parts of the original X- Men movie and makes them better, while virtually eliminating the flaws. It comfortably sits on the top tier of super-hero movies, with Spider-Man 2 and The Dark Knight. It's no coincidence that all three of those movies had fairly strong bases to build on, and kept the directors from the previous film.This time around, the Brotherhood and the X-Men are tentatively united against a massive threat to all mutant-kind. The movie begins brilliantly, with one of the most impressive, memorable, and complex scenes ever seen in a movie of this kind...and surprisingly, that level of quality is kept for the entire rest of X2. From the brutal fight between Wolverine and Lady Deathstrike, to the rather perfect ending, this is the definitive X-Men movie that we all wanted.",8,0,1,19 April 2010
RED," RED - Retired and Extremely Dangerous
","'Old man, my ass.'Red is the action romp that recent movies like The Losers  and Knight & Day have tried, and mostly failed, to be. It's fun without being dumb, funny, not too long or short, action- packed, and has a great cast as a bonus.The story is about a retired C.I.A. field operative (Willis) who is seemingly targeted by his own agency for death, for some unknown reason. He goes on the run with his recent acquaintance/love interest (Mary-Louise Parker) and looks up a bunch of his similarly retired buddies to help him find out what's going on. And it's that cast of supporting characters that really makes Red worthwhile. It includes Helen Mirren, Morgan Freeman, John Malkovich, and Brian Cox, and they all seemed to be having a ball as action stars.  Karl Urban also pitches in as the primary agent in the hunt for our dangerous oldsters. You'd be hard-pressed to find a better cast than that in ANY movie, regardless of genre. My one real problem with Red was the story. The best that could be said about it was that it was there, and it gave an excuse for the gang to get together and hop all around the U.S. Action movies admittedly don't need spectacular plots, but that of Red often left me cold.Other than that, I give Red a full recommendation. The casting was inspired, and it's just undeniably entertaining to see these guys (especially Mirren and Malkovich) blowing people away and just generally proving that bad-asses come in all ages.",7,0,0,26 January 2011
Final Destination," No longer novel, but still watchable.
","'But what if it was our time? What if we were not meant to get off that plane? What if it still is our time?'I'm sure everyone on Earth knows how these movies work, by now. A group of people (attractive teenagers, for the most part) narrowly escape certain Death as participants in some disaster. Yes, Death, with a capital D. But Death is not to be denied, so he sets up increasingly elaborate scenarios to kill off the survivors, while they attempt to thwart his plans yet again and live another day. As you can tell from the description, these movies are basically just about the death scenes and trying to guess how each person is going to bite the bullet, before it happens. They're like Saw without the torture and convoluted back story.Compared to the movies that came later in the series, the original Final Destination isn't nearly as inventive or brutal with its death scenes. Some of them will seem downright tame to today's audiences (this movie was released way back in 2000, after all). But, if you're a genre fan who can still find entertainment in even a mild dose of this formula, Final Destination probably won't be a waste of your 98 minutes.",6,1,2,24 July 2010
Rear Window," Possibly my favorite movie of the 50's.
","I love a good suspense-thriller, and Rear Window is one of the best classic examples of the genre. It's excellently paced, and balances tension and levity. There's no doubt that it holds up well 50+ years after its creation.   Grace Kelly is my favorite of Alfred Hitchcock's leading ladies, and her pairing with Jimmy Stewart really pushes Rear Window over top. For a movie with so few main characters, it was absolutely essential that the two leads have chemistry and be capable actors, and their were few other people at that time who satisfied both those requirements more than these two.Limiting the story to what the protagonists can see from their apartment window was an intentional creative constraint that helped Hitchcock to fully develop the themes of the movie. I never knew that such a singular point of view could offer such a riveting and interesting experience. I don't exactly consider Rear Window to be the 'best' Hitchcock movie, but it is my favorite that I've seen so far.",9,0,1,2 May 2010
The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King," An impressive success in every possible way.
","The extended version of Return of the King is slightly over four hours long. And other than the excessively drawn out and overly indulgent ending (the only thing that keeps it from perfection, in my eyes), every minute of it is wonderful. The best compliment that I can offer, is that it makes those four hours pass by in the twinkling of an eye.The first two movies laid all the groundwork, introduced most of the major characters, and set the stage for the end. All that's left for Return of the King to do is deliver...and deliver it does. The Battle of Minas Tirith makes The Battle of Helms Deep seem like a minor skirmish, and it's not even the climactic battle of the film. Each of the characters (and the entirety of the world of men) is in perhaps more danger than they've ever been. Frodo and Sam must face the perils of Mordor, the ring's continued burdening of Frodo, as well as the treachery of their guide. And the Eye of Sauron and the smoke and flames of Mount Dhoom cast a disheartening glare over all, as evil's final push to conquer Middle Earth moves into its final phase.RoTK stands as the best of the trilogy, in my humble opinion. It handles the events of the book incredibly well, only changing or excluding things when it's of benefit to the film. It's astonishing to see the world of Middle Middle translated so well from page to screen. Such a great adaptation of a complex work of literature as The Lord of the Rings should be nigh-impossible, but Peter Jackson, WETA, and New Line managed to pull it off. Return of the King is an achievement, a marvel, and almost a miracle, but most importantly, it's a near-perfect film and a great end to the trilogy.",9,1,2,17 June 2010
Casino," No one stays at the top forever.
","'A lot of holes in the desert, and a lot of problems are buried in those holes.'I learned three things from Casino: running a casino is a tough business, Las Vegas is a complicated town, and a terrible wife makes life much harder. Casino is a lengthy movie about the rise and fall of a couple of Vegas big-shots, and  the loss of the essence of old-school Vegas, itself. The story is told primarily from the points of view of Sam 'Ace' Rothstein (Robert De Niero) and Nicky Santoro (Joe Pesci), two guys who have known each other for years, and come to make money in Vegas in very different ways.Sam is a genius at all aspects of gambling that's tapped by the mob bosses back east to run a casino for them, while Nicky is a muscle guy who's there to protect Sam's operation. We watch them make a lot of money, and get into a lot of trouble because of their respective weaknesses/excesses. It's an entertaining movie, and the 179 minute runtime will pass by pretty quickly.Both De Niro and Pesci were excellent, with many other great actors supporting their performances. A lot of your enjoyment of this movie will hinge on your preference for the genre. Casino is very much a mob-type movie, though it's not a Godfather Part II Las Vegas re-tread, by any means. If even someone like me who's not a particular fan of this kind of movie can enjoy it, then that's a promising sign that most others will enjoy it, too.",7,5,7,16 August 2010
50_50," Perfect tone and a great cast make this a movie to see.
","Excellent movie. 50/50 is heartfelt and touching without being sappy or cheesy, and it doesn't hurt that it's genuinely funny at times. Great performances all around, especially from Joseph Gordon-Levitt. The guy makes all the relationships in the movie, be that with his mother, his best friend, or his psychiatrist (even his dog!) seem real. 50/50 has an excellent cast top to bottom, and the great script gives them a chance to show it. This is officially the cancer movie for people who don't like movies about cancer. I'm usually put off by this kind of film, but I was so impressed by the cast and the positive buzz around it that I had to give it a try. And I'm glad I did. What you'll find here is a refreshing take on a subject that can be really tricky to 'get right'. It's not just about Joseph's character, it's about the people around him, and it handles that in a very honest way. Can't recommend it enough, really.",8,0,0,25 February 2012
Get Him to the Greek," A worthy spin-off to Forgetting Sarah Marshall?
","'When the world slips you a Jeffery, stroke the furry wall.'Forgetting Sarah Marshall is one of my favorite movies ever (no exaggeration, I probably could watch it once a week without getting tired of it), so it goes without saying that I had mile-high expectations for this spin-off. And while Get Him to the Greek isn't bad by any means, I don't think it lived up to either Forgetting Sarah Marshall or it's own potential.Russell Brand and Jonah Hill are funny guys, so it may come as a surprise that the two funniest people in the movie were Rose Byrne and Sean Combs. They were both hilarious. Brand's character seems to be more reigned in this time around, and doesn't get to be nearly as funny as he was in the previous movie, where he stole the show. The great (and hilarious) songs from FSM were also replaced with some that weren't nearly as funny or clever. Hill gets some funny moments, but the stuff with his girlfriend (the awesome Elisabeth Moss in a small role) just never came off as particularly interesting or genuine. I get that the filmmakers were going for that mix of humor and relationship stuff that made FSM have such a wide appeal, but that's a tricky thing to pull off and the formula doesn't work as well, here.I'm sure my review seems harsh, and I don't mean it to be that way. Get Him to the Greek is a decent comedy. Some parts were quite funny. But to be honest, as the movie went along the jokes began to fizzle out until I was almost bored for the last 15 minutes. Check it out, but I doubt you'll be in a hurry to see it again soon.",6,4,10,7 October 2010
Easy A," A re-imagination of The Scarlet Letter, with a modern twist or two.
","'That's the beauty of being a girl in high school. People hear you had sex once, and bam, you're a bimbo.'I wouldn't quite put Easy A on the level of Superbad or Mean Girls, but it's a better than average teen comedy that comes at the typical high school tropes from a slightly different angle, and feels fresh, as a result. The movie works so well because of Emma Stone's performance as Olive, a  wickedly smart and kind-hearted high school girl whose white lies and attempt to do a good deed to help friend avoid bullying, ends up giving her quite the slutty reputation, thanks to the school rumor mill and a group of absurdly over-the-top group of religious students. Olive decides to (pretend to) embrace her newfound status as the school's most notorious fallen woman, but the gossip eventually gets way out of her control, and unfortunate consequences result. Stone had already proved in Superbad, Zombieland, and The House Bunny that she has a gift for playing the funny hot chick (though in this movie she's initially not very popular with the high school guys...yeah, right), and she has great on-screen chemistry with Amanda Bynes, Stanley Tucci, Patricia Clarkson, Aly Michalka, and the rest of her co- stars. This is a great cast all-around. No complaints in that area.   Even when some of the jokes don't amuse as much as they could have (don't get me wrong, there are plenty of times that you'll be rolling with laughter), Emma Stone is so likable and has such great screen presence that I never lost interest. Check this out, it's a fun movie through and through.",7,0,0,24 December 2010
Fast Five," Faster and faster.
","Fast Five has enough machismo and testosterone to make The Expendables look subdued. It's much more of a straight up action/heist film than the previous movies, with the occasional car chase scene to remind you it's still a Fast & Furious movie (if all the returning faces aren't enough to let you know). And it works. This is a really fun flick to watch in an 'Ocean's Eleven meets the gleeful carnage of a Michael Bay movie' kind of way that's entertaining and ridiculously over-the-top. Fast Five is easily the best movie of the series, and probably one of the most exciting movies of the year. Dwayne Johnson is a perfect addition to the cast and his confrontations with Diesel's character is among the many highlights of the film, plus it's good to see the old cast members back in action. If you want an action romp that breezes by without getting to serious, looks slick, and just doesn't know what it means to slow down, this will give you all you need and more.",8,3,5,2 December 2011
Honey," Just as ridiculous as you'd expect.
","'We just peoples.'Can you believe that I actually went to the movies to see this? Sure, I was like 16 at the time. And I was on a date. But that's still kind of embarrassing.   You usually couldn't get me to touch one of these movies with a ten foot pole. The whole 'dancing' genre just does not appeal to me in the least. But there's exceptions to every rule, and Jessica Alba is an exception to every rule. So against my better judgment, I gave Honey a try.Every imaginable cliché from this kind of movie is conveniently collected here in one neat package. The impossibly sweet and sunny heroine with a heart of gold, who achieves her dreams of dancing, but must deal with the sinister pitfalls that come along with success. The stern, disapproving parent, who is totally convinced that their child is throwing away her talent. The rift that grows between the main character and her friend, as her career takes off. The perfectly diverse, multicultural cast. The whitewashed, sanitized view of 'urban culture', where the only bad guys are the drug dealers (whom the precious children are saved from in the end, of course). And the horribly unnatural 'slang', that no real person on earth actually speaks like. Some of the meager entertainment that Honey has to offer, comes from how forced and hilariously awkward the dialogue is.   Your tolerance for all that could possibly be much higher than mine. I'm the guy who automatically turns up his nose at any dross like this, churned out just to appeal to young urban (a.k.a. black) people. Surprise, some of us are immune to this kind of derivative, pandering nonsense.    What I am thoroughly UN-immune to, though, is attractive young actresses. The star of this movie, in particular. So maybe I'd better climb back down off my oh-so-high horse. Getting to see Jessica Alba half-dressed and dancing around suggestively - holds some appeal for me. Not nearly enough to rescue this movie, but enough to make me not rip it out of my DVD player and throw it in the garbage. What can I say? I'm male.",4,0,2,20 June 2010
Pineapple Express," You'll laugh, often.
","If I ever got together with a group of my friends and made a movie, it would probably turn out to be a lot like Pineapple Express. It's an action/comedy in the vein of Get Smart, but minus the spies and with an R rating and some weed thrown in. All the different parts of the movie work well. The action scenes are hilarious, the dialogue is hilarious...it's the funniest overall movie that I've seen since Zack and Miri Make a Porno. We're talking about some of the most hysterical fight scenes that I've ever had the pleasure of watching. Rogen and McBride do their usual thing (which I honestly don't think I will ever get tired of), but Franco's jocose character was completely unexpected. I never knew he had it in him!I'm glad to know that Rogen is a guy that I can always count on for some laughs. Pineapple Express doesn't leave much room for criticism. There's a dangling little plot threat with Amber Heard that I would have liked to see addressed at the end of the movie, but that's only because I thought the other scenes between Seth and Amber were so funny. If that's the most that I can find to complain about, then there's nothing left for me to do except admit that Pineapple Express is simply a great comedy.",8,1,2,29 January 2016
Sin City," A perfect translation from page to screen.
","Well before I left the theater, the first time I watched Sin City, I knew it was going to be one of my favorite movies, ever. It's one of the rare movies that I went to the theater to see multiple times, forcefully dragging along any of my friends who hadn't seen it (and the smart ones who already had). It's just that good. It's the best film ever based on comic books or graphic novels, and I doubt that will ever change (until Sin City 2, that is). Robert Rodriguez realized that the source material was basically perfect, all he had to do was get the cinematography and casting right. And he succeeded brilliantly. The nearly frame-for-frame creation of the comic panels works so well, because there's nothing really that could have been added to improve what was on the page. And the sheer amount of great actors and actresses collected here is impressive, to say the least. They embody the characters without overwhelming them.This isn't the perfect movie for everyone, but I don't see how it could disappoint anyone who is familiar with the novels, a fan of Miller's style, or anyone who enjoys a dark, funny, and stylish action movie. I love it from the very first scene to the very last. Which is great, because I'm sure I'll have watched it at least 20 more times, before a sequel gets made.",10,7,8,17 April 2010
Gangs of New York," A solid (yet flawed) movie.
","The last act of Gangs of New York made the entire movie worthwhile, for me. It also was part of the reason why the film occasionally felt so disjointed.On one hand, Gangs of New York tackled such heady issues as immigration, the draft, class conflict, racism, and discrimination of all kinds. It's a pretty brutal and realistic movie, in that regard. On the other hand, it's the story of a young Irish American who seeks revenge for the murder of his father. I found the latter far less interesting than the former. These two parts of the story are supposed to parallel each other, and I can see the ways that Scorsese tried to connect them, but it's only towards the end where this approach actually works. The rest of the time, it's fairly awkward.  I lay a lot of the fault for this in the casting of Leonardo DiCaprio and Cameron Diaz. I have no problems with either of these actors (and have enjoyed them both in other movies), but they just didn't 'fit' here. And when they were surrounded by so many actors who were perfect for the location and time period, they stuck out like a sore thumb. It doesn't help that the two characters were basically thrown together, with little story basis for why they should be so devoted to one another.Despite what I considered to be its considerable flaws, I still thought that Gangs of New York was a good film. Seeing an exaggerated portrayal of some of the actual history of early New York and immigration to the city was cool, and most of the latter half was brilliant. Fans of Scorsese are in for a (at times muddled) treat.",7,0,0,24 June 2010
Moon," A different kind of sci-fi story.
","I haven't seen a new, cerebral sci-fi movie in a while, but Moon scratches that itch quit well. It's somber, engrossing, and almost heartbreaking at times. The plot is fairly simple. There's a clean energy source on the moon, and a company has built a permanent base there, to harvest it. The base is occupied only by a man (who stays there for three years at a time, before going back to earth and being replaced) and a robot that serves as a universal helper to the human. From there, a story of loneliness, love, and the very essence of humanity, unwinds.I really dug the direction the story took. It never felt limited by the small number of characters, and the plot developments succeed in keeping the movie interesting, without becoming disorienting or boring. I recommend Moon to anyone who likes a good, personal drama, regardless of whether or not they are a general fan of science fiction.",7,0,7,27 April 2010
True Romance," True entertainment.
","'I'm not lying to you. And I swear from this moment forth...I will never lie to you again.'.Everyone knows that True Romance was written and sold by Quentin Tarantino. Then came the spat between Tarantino and Tony Scott when Scott wouldn't allow the rights to revert back to Tarantino, so he could direct it. And it's not a surprise that Tarantino would have wanted to direct it, because it's a great movie.The title is correct, the movie is about a romance. A romance surrounded by all the stylish violence and well-written dialogue that you would expect from a Tarantino movie. Call girl Alabama (Patricia Arquette, the best part of the movie) and store clerk Clarence (Christian Slater, in the best role I've ever seen him in) meet and fall madly in love one night. The next day they're married, and Clarence gets the notion in his head to kill Alabama's former pimp. It's all cascade of drugs, violence, mobsters, cops, and movie producers, from there.I don't know if there has ever been an on-screen couple that I rooted for more than Alabama and Clarence. They both go through A LOT of stuff for each other. Their relationship is never melodramatic is sappy, it's the kind of thing that puts a smile on your face to see two people who are just obviously perfect for one another. You can't help but want the two of them to get out off all this okay.I can't help but think that the music used in the movie would have been better if QT had been able to direct it, but there's not much else about the movie that I can complain about. The cast is great, it's very funny, and the pacing is outstanding. Any fan of Tarantino owes it to their self to see this.",8,0,2,26 June 2010
The Runaways," Inappropriate and in your face. The way any movie about The Runaways should be.
","'You hear that? That's the sound of hormones raging.'The Runaways is at the opposite end of the spectrum from most recent music biopics. Where movies like Ray and Walk the Line aim for emotional resonance and creating a connection between an iconic figure and the audience, The Runaways is about style, dramatics, and looking good. Which is pretty in line with what the band was about. The sobriety of those movies I previously mentioned wouldn't have worked for such a hyper- kinetic story as this one. Sure, the movie slows down a bit when the crash and burn sets in, but the focus on style, sound and imagery is never really replaced by anything else. And I mean that as a compliment. Michael Shannon didn't really work for me as Kim Fowley, but the movie wasn't really about him, anyway. The five girls playing the group seemed to have an inappropriate amount of fun with their roles, and who wouldn't? You can't help but be impressed by their performances, they play and act like a real band. But no doubt about it, this is Kristin Stewart's (Joan Jett) and and Dakota Fanning's (Cherie Currie) show. They don't let you forget it. Not many actresses their age would have the talent and the balls to take something like this on. They do it, and do it right. I left the movie with a healthy amount of respect for both of them.     The entire movie plays out like a music video about all the things you would be mortified of seeing your teenage daughter doing, but of course, would make her cool to do. Which makes sense, as the director (Floria Sigismondi) is best known for directing music videos. The cinematography gleefully sells the same excess, ego, and intoxication that the Runaways' image did. All the band's songs that are woven throughout the movie keep it moving at a super-charged pace. You have to tailor the tone of a film to its subject matter, in order for it to be successful. The Runaways is the true(ish), female version of sex, drugs, and rock & roll, and I couldn't help but really enjoy every bawdy and inappropriate minute of it. Get in a Runaways frame of mind, or don't even bother with this one.",8,64,81,20 July 2010
Gladiator," The very definition of 'epic'.
","'The beating heart of Rome is not the marble of the Senate. Its the sand of the Colisseum. He'll bring them death, and they will love him for it.'Gladiator ignited or rekindled a fascination with historical epics for a lot of people, and rightfully so. It hearkens back to movies like Spartacus and The Ten Commandments, sweeping and grand film events that go all out in taking you back to a specific time and place.It's a very good movie. The story of a once great man who is stripped of his family and his honor and left with nothing but his desire for revenge and the gladiatorial arena, is simple and powerful. But there are two real reasons why Gladiator works so well: Russell Crowe is the perfect Maximus, and the sets are absolutely awe-inspiring. This is the closest to seeing ancient Rome that any of us will ever get, and if you weren't impressed by Commidus's entry to Rome or the scenes in the Colisseum, I don't know what WOULD impress you. Each building and battle rings of authenticity and attention to detail. Crowe gives a believability to Maximus that many actors wouldn't have been able to pull off half as well. He makes Maximus seem a man who truly would inspire awe among the public and his followers, and jealousy from those who feel threatened by him. There were several notable performances from this cast, but Crowe stands above them all. It's still his finest role, in my opinion.Gladiator is the best movie that Ridley Scott has made since Blade Runner. It's impressive in all aspects, and completely deserves the lofty reputation that it has.",8,1,4,17 July 2010
Transformers: Dark of the Moon," A franchise that just can't live up to its potential.
","Why can't it just be about the robots?The first Transformers movie struck a decent tone between the humans and the Autobot/Decepticon conflict and mythology. Yes, it was at times silly, but the focus was never totally off of the main characters (and what we want to see from these movies in the first place), the robots. The second movie took the concept 'more is better' and ran with it, to less than satisfactory results. More action scenes and more robots, but also more 'wacky humor' and more focus on the humans.  It was an indecipherable, overly-long mess that was made to be as loud and eye-catching as possible, but it was a noticeable step down in quality from the first movie. And now we have the third movie, which turns down the potty humor slightly, but features some awful writing and a story that's just silly. Forcing the character of Sam (Shia Lebeouf) and others to be a part of a plot that they have no reason to be in anymore just adds a lot of unnecessary, empty scenes to a movie that has no business being 2 1/2 hours long. I liked his character in the other two movies, but in this one he's so over-the-top and hysterical that it's annoying, and the storyline with him and his new girlfriend (Rosie Huntington-Whitley) is an uninteresting distraction at best. John Turturro returns again in a role that wore out its welcome about 45 minutes into the first movie, Frances McDormand is wasted, John Malkovich is REALLY wasted, and Alan Tudyk is REALLY. REALLY wasted. Don't expect much from the casting of those fan-favorite actors. If you're under the impression that I hated Dark of the Moon, that's not true. If you ignore the horrid writing and tune out the parade of annoying or pointless characters, there's a decent action movie buried in here about a bunch of robots smashing and blowing each other up. It's just a shame that so much of the movie is spent on the weakest, least interesting part. It's a great idea to ground such fantastical beings as Transformers in our reality through some human characters to relate to, but if that portion of the equation isn't at least adequate, the whole movie suffers. Enough of my rambling. If the many flaws of the second movie didn't put you off, then you'll probably like Dark of the Moon even more. The action is easier to follow than in Revenge of the Fallen (though there are virtually no good robot vs. robot fight scenes until the very end of the movie) and the editing overall has been improved. I was just hoping that a better balance between the Transformers and humans would have been found by now, but the scales still tip far too much in the wrong direction.",Null,0,2,1 October 2011
The Social Network," Don't hesitate to see this.
","'I was your only friend. You had one friend.'The Social Network is a very smart, entertaining look at the founding of Facebook, it's (co)creator, Mark Zuckerberg, and the various legal actions that have taken place over the creation and ownership of the company that has become the face of social life on the Internet.I'm sure that a lot of liberties have been taken with the story of what really happened (if anyone actually knows), but those liberties make for a very good movie. The cast is great, with Andrew Garfield, Armie Hammer, and Jesse Eisenberg standing out as the biggest and most important roles. The writing and dialogue are very sharp, and the cinematography, especially in the initial setting at Harvard, (though filming didn't happen on the actual Harvard campus, of course), is memorable.David Fincher did a great job cultivating a believable, fascinating atmosphere from all the melodrama. If you're wondering what could be so interesting about a 'Facebook movie', I recommend that you do yourself a favor and see for yourself. The Social Network is a movie that doesn't try to label its subjects as good or bad guys, and it doesn't attempt to be a documentary showing exactly what happened. It does, however, aim to entertain. Aim and succeed.",8,1,2,11 February 2011
Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade," Third in more ways than one.
","Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade is my least favorite of the original three Indiana Jones movies. It's not bad by any means; it's still a better historical adventure than The DaVinci Code or any other recent entry in the genre. But it's lacking a bit of the bit of the old Indy magic that made the first two movies so fun.For the first half of the movie, it almost seems more like a James Bond movie than Raiders of the Lost Ark. There's very little raiding to be had. And for the second half, it's almost TOO MUCH like Raiders. The reason I liked Temple of Doom so much is that it added a lot of new elements while keeping true to the spirit of the first movie. That's what I was expecting from Crusade as well, but the focus on Indy's dad just didn't do much for me.What I did like was how funny the movie was. Every entry in the series has had some level of humor, but Last Crusade was absolutely hysterical at times. No painfully obvious, forced gags that would ruin the tone, just lots of quick little jokes that you'll miss if you're not paying attention.Â I hate being so harsh on a movie that's not bad by any measure. But I was so pleased with how much more I like the second movie than the first, that it's really disappointing to find the third to be the least entertaining of the bunch.",6,2,7,16 May 2010
The Birds," You'll never look at birds the same way again.
","In 2008's The Happening, M. Knight Shyamalan failed spectacularly to do what Alfred Hitchcock did way back in 1963. Make a great movie about what would happen if one of the most benign and least threatening aspects of nature, suddenly, inexplicably, and fatally turned against humanity.While Shymalan tried to horrify us with the wind and plant pollen, Hitchcock decides to remind us of how many more birds there are than humans, and how sharp beaks are just as capable of plucking out eyes and stabbing flesh as they are at pecking seeds. If you scoff at the idea of birds being deadly...well, imagine yourself in any of the various terrifying and menacing situations that these characters face throughout The Birds. The last 15 minutes are as tense as almost anything I've ever seen in movieThe ordinary and frivolous opening of the story is a perfect segue into the unexpected horror that descends on the small coastal town of Bodega Bay. There's a slow, menacing buildup to the action, and it definitely serves to lull you into an easy calm that shatters all the harder once the feathers start flying. And we never know why. Great movie.",8,5,9,18 May 2010
The Simpsons Movie," It's The Simpsons. In a movie.
","'So, you want some of my electricity, do you? Well, for once, the rich white man is in control.' Imagine an average episode of The Simpsons. Now imagine it stretched out to movie length, with a little bit more of a risqué element added than what they could get away with on television. That's The Simpson's Movie in a nutshell.Now imagine the last Simpson's episode you saw that was pretty funny, but not good enough to rank among your very favorites. That's how I felt about this movie. I remember it being pretty hilarious the first time I saw it, but I think some of that may have just been the theater atmosphere and the novelty of watching The Simpsons on the big screen. The second time around, it doesn't hold up quite so well. Lots of amusing moments, but few jokes that go beyond that. The best comedies (and the best Simpsons episodes) are the ones that are still very funny after the first viewing. The Simpson's Movie doesn't quite meet that standard. It's a must-see for fans and a worthwhile diversion for general audiences, but once is probably enough.",6,0,0,6 July 2010
The Wizard of Oz," A cinematic achievement that never truly grows old.
","'You have no power here! Begone, before somebody drops a house on you, too!' It seems a little silly to be writing a review of The Wizard of Oz. It's the movie that's been seen by more people than any other in history. Most of us have seen it 10 times by the time we're seven. But I'll put my two cents in anyway, from an adult's point of view.As a kid, I thought the munchkins were slightly creepy and the winged monkeys much more so, but I loved Dorothy and I loved the songs, and the entire movie was just so bright and colorful that I find it hard to believe that any kid could dislike it. Now, at the age of 25, I can still recognize the merit of it, without being influenced much by a lasting nostalgia. The Wizard of Oz is a lot like Alice in Wonderland (my all-time favorite children's novel), it treats children like they're smart and clever and capable of understanding and handling ideas that sometimes we adults forget they can get a handle on. The danger and excitement of The Wizard of Oz is a true adventure, be it a candy-coated one.I can also better appreciate now the staggering amount of work and creativity that went into bringing this novel to life. It's just remarkable, really. The choreography, the classic songs, the sets, the costumes, the special effects, they're all still impressive today. More so, really, because many of the tools used to make modern movie magic weren't available back then. And Judy Garland...really, what needs to be said about her that isn't blindingly and extraordinarily obvious? No one else could have been Dorothy Gale.It was nice to revisit this once again, and while some of my childhood adoration for The Wizard of Oz may be gone, my admiration for it still remains.",7,6,9,10 November 2010
The Fighter," Maybe not a champion, but certainly a contender.
","'I'm the one who's fighting. Not you, not you, and not you.'The Fighter is a family drama disguised as a boxing movie. A pretty decent family drama, in fact. Maybe saying it's 'disguised' as a boxing movie is inaccurate. Boxing is a big part of the movie and the life of the characters. But most of the drama comes outside the ring, as a result of the push and pull between Mickey Ward's domineering but loving manager/mother, his self-destructive brother/trainer/former champ, and his new girlfriend, father, and other people who are trying to help him achieve his dream of being a boxing champ. Much has been made about the performances of Christian Bale and Melissa Leo, and the praise is completely deserved. Especially for Bale, who gives the performance of his career in this movie. Amy Adams was also great, and continues her string of strong performances in good movies (she's my favorite contemporary actress for good reason). That's not to discount Mark Wahlberg, who does a fine job as the central character. The other actors just steal the show. All in all, I'd say that The Fighter is a solid movie elevated my some fantastic performances. Even if sports biopics aren't really your thing, you should give it a try just to see some excellent actors at work.",7,1,1,15 March 2011
Evil Dead II," Ash is back for more hilarious terror!
","'We just cut up our girlfriend with a chainsaw. Does that sound 'fine'?'Did you like The Evil Dead? Then my friend, you are in luck! Evil Dead 2 is a bigger, better sequel in every way.After a quick re-cap/revision of the events of the first movie, Evil Dead 2 is off and running, and it never slows down. The movie picks up immediately after the original ended, with Ash shaken, alone, and still under attack from the terror unleashed by the Book of the Dead. Evil Dead 2 is more over-the-top (if that's even possible) than the first Evil Dead, and it's more hilarious, as a result. The fake blood flows by the gallon and the Deadites are more gruesome. This is a movie that's just fun, fun, fun to watch. There's a bit of a trade-off, as there's less 'genuine' horror, but as far as pure entertainment goes, there is no real contest about which movie is better. If you liked the first, you should love the second. If you loved the original, well, get ready to meet your new soul-mate.",8,0,1,23 February 2011
Up in the Air," Jason Reitman is a stellar director, no doubt about it.
","Mr. Clooney, you have finally convinced me of your charm and acting talent. They both are on full display in Up in the Air, and I find myself throughly convinced. I can't picture a single other actor in this role, and that's about as big of a compliment as I can give. Mr. Reitman, you are now 3 for 3, and that's quite a feat. I'm the biggest Juno fan in the world, and while Up in the Air doesn't eclipse that particular favorite of mine, I still enjoyed it for many of the same reasons. The story is starkly modern, yet I think it will stand the test of time very well. It's melancholy (I do so love melancholy), occasionally uncomfortably honest, and it flows perfectly. Never a dull moment, no glaring flaws, and a cast that brings the best out of the characters. The music is a perfect companion to each scene, enhancing them while never becoming a distraction. Up in the Air is a great movie, and one that I hope to see again very, very soon.",8,0,2,7 April 2010
Atonement," One of my favorite movies of the last 10 years.
","'Yes. I saw him. I saw him with my own eyes.'It's past time I wrote a proper review for Atonement, as it's am excellent movie in all aspects and a personal favorite of mine.I'm quite the fan of Joe Wright. He's talented enough to make Pride & Prejudice into a movie that both guys and girls could enjoy, and pairing him with Keira Knightley again for another historical piece is basically a guarantee for success. The man knows how to craft a good drama.The first thing I love about Atonement is the cinematography. From the opening portions in the beautiful English countryside, to wartime London and the British evacuation at Dunkirk, this is a startlingly beautiful movie. Not a moment passes by without something eye-catching in the frame. From the settings to the costumes, it's a cinematic showcase.Second, the cast is outstanding. This was the movie that made Keira Knightley one of my five favorite current actresses, and made me a fan of James McAvoy. It was also the movie that proved that Saoirse Ronan is easily the best actress of her age. All three actresses who played Briony at different ages were good, but Ronan had the task of defining the character for the other two women, as well as the most challenging role in the movie. Her Academy Award nomination was completely deserved, especially for one so young.Third, this is an excellent adaptation of an excellent book. It's a movie that easily could have seemed disjointed because of the way it switches time periods, settings, and tone, but every part of it works and flows together. The changes from period drama to war film and back to drama are pulled off flawlessly.So yeah, I think very highly of Atonement. Any time a movie takes a genre that I'm not a huge fan of and MAKES me a huge fan, I'm impressed. It has something for almost everyone, and it's just a well-crafted film. Check it out, even if this kind of thing isn't normally to your taste.",9,1,3,6 October 2010
V for Vendetta," A good movie, made from a great novel.
","Before reading the V for Vendetta graphic novel, I considered the movie version to be excellent. After reading it...well, I still consider it to be a good movie, but I cannot really call it a good adaptation of the book. I'm not one of those people who automatically considers the film version of any piece of any literature to be inferior by definition. And I realize that there are going to inevitably be some changes in the journey from page to screen. Just because thing are changed, does not mean that those changes have to have a negative impact on the core story. Some things work better on page than film, and vice-versa, and it can be a grave disservice to a story to not make those changes, solely for authenticity's sake. My only problem with V for Vendetta, is that the changes made to the film version, had a negative impact on the movie. The characters were altered into less complex, whitewashed versions of themselves, and that was difficult to overlook. The plot also differs in a few fundamental ways, with several things being excised from the narrative. I can understand that a 132 minute movie cannot hold every detail of a moderately long novel, but there are some fairly weak additions to the movie that are not nearly as compelling as the material that they replaced. The occasional focus on action sequences (and the slow-motion that was used liberally within them), I eventually accepted as just one of those inevitable changes, made to appeal to the general movie audience. And as much as I love Cat Power, 'I Found a Reason' did not fit at all into the scene where it was used. Or the movie, as a whole.   These will be non-issues for viewers who have no experience with the novel, and I  heartily recommend the movie to those people. But my recommendation is slightly more  cautious to those familiar with the original version of Alan Moore's work. I can't imagine  that your thoughts will differ much from mine, as you watch this.The actors chosen to play the characters were good choices, for the most part. Sadler,  Creedy, and especially Prothero, all spoke and looked like I imagined a living version of the character would. The rest of the cast was solid, as well. I had no problems with their performances, even when I occasionally had issues with the way their characters were interpreted and written. My sole qualm in this area was with Natalie  Portman, but I couldn't tell if she didn't portray Evey well...or if she did, but the version of Evey that she was given just didn't connect with me.I care little for the deeper political and philosophical issues that were the heart of the  graphic novel, and I feel the same way about the ones presented in the movie version,  so I won't comment on those things. I enjoyed reading V for Vendetta merely because  it's an excellently told and illustrated story, and enough of that brilliance shines through in  the movie version, for me to give it my approval.",6,1,6,13 March 2010
The Island," Nothing wrong with a little disposable entertainment, from time to time.
","The Island is a big, noisy, empty movie. It perfectly fits the bill of the summer popcorn flick. You won't learn anything, you won't leave with any lasting impressions, and if you don't see it on the big-screen, then you're missing half the point. This movie never tries to be anything more than it is, and I can appreciate that. After the relatively quiet beginning, the viewer is never forced to go very long without gunshots, explosion, or car chases. Some of the action scenes are actually pretty epic, and if you end up remembering anything about the movie after, I'm willing to bet that it will be a few of those. So as an average, disposable summer movie, The Island is a success. There's little reason to see it again after the first time, though. That's like watching the same exact kind of fireworks twice in a row. Sure, they're still pretty, but the novelty has worn off, and you're ready to see one of the other countless kinds of pretty explosives.",5,1,2,18 May 2010
"O Brother, Where Art Thou?"," Fun to watch!
","The first thing that struck me about O Brother, Where Art Thou? was the locations. The Coen brothers did a stellar job of portraying the Mississippi of this time period as I have always imagined it would look. It makes me want to seek out these parts of my state myself, just to see what true rural Mississippi once looked like.The second thing that caught my attention about this movie is how over-the-top it is. That will automatically make it unpleasant for some, but it became endearing for me after only a short time. Yes, George Clooney's accent doesn't work nearly as well as John Turturro's or Tim Blake Nelson's, but after a while it all seems to fit and just seems right.The third element that stands out about O Brother is the songs. Awesome. Every scene is highlighted by some of the most kick-ass, old-timey tunes known to man. Anyone who doesn't want the soundtrack after seeing the movie is just being contrary. The fact that this is loosely based on The Odyssey is only occasionally apparent, but the story that is here is more than enough to entertain. Every new character is captivating, no matter how long or brief their screen time. The movies starts off brilliantly, sags a bit toward the middle, and then finishes fairly strong. It's not quite consistent enough to be a classic, but I definitely would like to see it again. O Brother, Where Art Thou? is just a lot of fun to watch.",7,0,0,1 February 2016
