Borat: Cultural Learnings of America for Make Benefit Glorious Nation of Kazakhstan," Funniest movie ever?
","This was HILARIOUS!!! I really don't know if I've ever laughed that hard at a movie before.As usual, Borat was super offensive in an ironic way, but this time the result is several times funnier than Da Ali G Show ever was. If you like that show, you will love this movie.The film blends traditional Borat segments like those we've seen on Da Ali G show with a fictional storyline. It's pretty obvious what is scripted, but all of a sudden it transitions into a gut busting reality scene, then something happens in 'reality' that relates to the storyline. They pulled it off really well, and I've never seen anything quite like it. It's pretty refreshing to see something so original.It's a great movie to see in a theater, because the crowd reaction really adds to the experience.Did I mention it is flat out HILARIOUS?!!!",10,2,13,5 November 2006
Mulholland Drive," Excellent film!
","This was a great film. I honestly didn't quite understand it until hours after it was over. My only criticism would be that it gets a bit slow from time to time, but I still really enjoyed it. Naomi Watts really deserves an Oscar nomination for her brilliant and versatile performance.",9,1,1,23 October 2001
