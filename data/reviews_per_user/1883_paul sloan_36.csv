The Blair Witch Project," What Is This Witch's Promise ?
","This movie, while really an interesting curio,is a nice piece of hokum with some great moments. Most of the action is shown on video tape as we follow  3 young film makers in search of the mystery that is the Blair Witch. Obviously low budget,the whole enterprise is put together convincingly-well. Dialogue comes over as realistic and there is a tense build-up of atmosphere as spooky occurences happen.One problem with the credibility of the story is that it is not really believable that they would continue to film everything when things go so drastically wrong. However, there is much to entertain here and films like The Blair Witch Project show that just because something is low budget it is not necessarily poor quality. The DVD version is well worth exploring with a great scene by scene commentary from the producers and directors and a fantastic pseudo-documentary called The Blair Witch Legacy which expands the story and superbly complements the original movie.",Null,0,1,13 October 2000
The Sound of Music," I'm Not Seventeen Going On Eighteen
","The Sound Of Music has aged fairly well. Yes, the story is corny and the movie has to be one of the most sentimental of all but it has the truly magnificent songs of Rogers and Hammerstein to compensate. The photography is truly breathtaking at times with superb production values throughout. This and Doctor Zhivago were my favourite films when I was growing up in the sixties and I  have seen it countless times.Eventually I grew up and became into  adult movies like The Godfather etc. but The Sound of Music brings back many pleasant memories. It was a world of colour and adventure. Sheer escapism for a kid growing-up in rainy industrial Scotland. One thing I know for sure is that Julie Andrews, while not quite a babe,was certainly far too good-looking to be a nun.Also the fact that the hills were alive with the sound of music remains equally valid in our own present times.",Null,0,5,3 September 2000
Fight Club," Come And Have A Go If You Think You're Hard Enough!
","Can anyone really believe that Edward Norton is capable of holding his own in a fight? If you can get over this major credibility hurdle then this film is quite acceptable being a curiously-different black comedy with some great dramatic elements. Brad Pitt and Helena Bonham Carter provide sound support.One criticism I have is that the movie is too long and loses direction in the second half, with one not sure where the plot is heading. A pruning of length would have helped. Oh yes,and we can't forget that Meat Loaf plays a guy with breasts. Mind you it is a tough guy with breasts that he plays. I wonder how his agent described the part to him.'Hey, Meat, got a great part for ya! Big budget Hollywood movie. Brad Pitt's in it.It's a fight movie. Your part? well you play a tough guy with boobies.It'll pay well though.'",Null,0,1,19 October 2000
Billy Elliot," Strikes the right chord
","Billy Elliot is a movie that really does the business.Forget some gaping holes in the story and the over use of swearing, this film has great charm showing one boy's discovery of dance and a world away from the squalor and bleakness of his home life during the UK miner's strike of the 1980's.Julie Walters, Gary Lewis and the remarkable Jamie Bell in his debut all give excellent performances. Stephen Daldry gives us a film with just the right mix of reality and sentimentality. Well worth seeing !",Null,0,0,30 April 2001
The Others," If It's not one it's the Others
","Nicole Kidman is excellent.The movie is atmospheric but ultimately drab and the script is littered with clues to the denoument.Eric Sykes is wasted and is far better as the voice of the scary lion in Teletubbies. However, overall the project is well-made and very wathchable though fans of the genre will have seen it all before.Oh yes, and Nicole Kidman is of the all- time babes!",Null,2,4,2 September 2002
X-Men," The Unusual Suspexts
","This movie is noisy. It works if accepted in a comic book way. Otherwise it is rather unengaging and is saved by excellent EFX and top rate acting performances.If you watch it for no other reason, then watch it to see Halle Berry, surely an all-time movie babe!",Null,0,0,27 March 2002
Snatch," Diamonds Are For Never
","A further enjoyable romp with those London Boys. The plot is wonderfully silly with great dialogue and acting throughout. While there are plenty laughs, you still never forget the menace of these quite awful and dangerous characters. The running time of this movie simply rushes by. This is great entertainment and definitely equal to Lock Stock in terms of quality but is probably not as memorable as Mr Ritchie's debut. Well worth catching.",Null,0,1,21 March 2002
The Godfather: Part II," Epic Mob Adventures
",This must be the best sequel ever.It takes the story of the Corleone family to a truly epic stage.Tremendous acting from the star cast and the dreadfully under-rated Michael V. Gazzo and Lee Strasberg.The flashback scenes are great and who can forget the Black Hand wanting to wet his 'beak'. Shame Godfather III was so dull by comparison.,Null,0,0,5 September 2000
LÃ©on: The Professional," Besson Hits The USA in style.
","This is a superb movie.At last working in the USA, Luc Besson's  direction paints NYC in a strange yet accurate way. It is , at once, frightening and attractive.The character of Leon, as played by Jean Reno, is really fantastic though we never really get to know what makes him tick.His relationship with Mathilda is tender but he seems ill at ease for the most part with her. However, he becomes complete when using his massive arsenal of sophisticated weaponry. Natalie Portman is wonderful as the apparently streetwise,yet vunerable Mathilda, whom Leon virtually adopts.Best seen at the cinema , this is a thriller with great action and intelligent moving moments. A rarity.",Null,0,1,30 October 2000
He Got Game," Spike Goes to Disney
",Spike Lee makes a movie for Disney.It was only a matter of time before Spike tried his hand at a basketball film and this is a worthwhile if flawed effort. Denzel Washington is great as Jake and the film is directed brilliantly. However half way through it is easy to see how the whole thing is going to end and the whole finish disappoints. Still there is much to enjoy here such as the use of Aaron Copland's stirring music and the towering performance of Mr Washington.,Null,1,2,2 December 2000
American Psycho," Oh! The Horror
","In some ways this film is remarkable. Many people who have read the novel of American Psycho have said it is unfilmable.So the fact that this film exists is some feat in itself. That does not mean to say  that this movie is good. It is not bad, Christian Bale is magnificent as Bateman, but it is not good and plods around the outer limits of satire and black comedy before disapearing into  oblivion in a most unsatisfactory manner. A worthy failure by most folks' reckoning.",Null,0,1,30 March 2001
Being John Malkovich," Different for sure
","This movie is cetainly different with a totally unique plot and set of circumstances. John Cusack is great in it and for the first hour the whole thing is bizarrely entertaining. After that, much of the movie is quite contrived and really quite dull. The problem is Malkovich himself. His life seems just to be one big snooze if this  is anything to go by. Who would pay money to be in his head ? Now if it was Being Robert Downey Jnr that might be more fun",Null,0,0,5 February 2001
Spider-Man," Let's Hear it For The Goblin!
","SPOILER WARNINGThe hard thing to take on board from this movie is why does Norman Osborn not just take a pay-off from the company, retire and go fishing. Instead he has to become the Green Goblin.This causes him heaps of trouble and ends-up with his death. Some folks never learn! Spider-Man is a true fun, escapist movie. we could do with more of this stuff. Oh Yeah! and Kirsten Dunst is a pure babe.",Null,0,0,26 September 2002
Collateral," Hot Night In The City
","This movie is just a great roller coaster ride where we go along with Tom Cruise and Jamie Foxx . Superbly directed by Michael Mann, this is quite a dark tale of one night in the life of cab driver, Foxx, and his very unusual fare, Mr Cruise. The tone of the plot is dark and it does get complicated, especially when the cops become involved but the movie rattles along at great pace. It is nice to see a movie of this type with a big budget and see talented people doing their thing.The plot does have loads of holes in it and Jamie Foxx's glasses do seem silly and pointless but Collateral is none the less for these minor points. Also, in a movie world of sequels and retreads, it is great to come across an original idea that is both well made and entertaining. Recommended .",8,2,3,7 March 2005
American History X," Worthy but bleak
","Edward Norton's performance makes this movie. He is certainly one of the finest screen actors of the moment. This tale of a young racist and how his life and family are affected by his actions is a powerful one.It is also relentlessly bleak in tone and not easy to watch at times.However,this is still worth one's time and effort to watch and, however you feel about the film's message,it is surely thought-provoking. Nice to see Mr Keach too. he has been woefully under used by Hollywood in recent years.",Null,0,0,21 November 2000
Ocean's Eleven," Fair but all a bit pointless.
",Are Hollywood script writers so devoid of ideas that they have to recycle ideas that were really not very good in the first place? The cast in this are great and the whole thing is a good natured heist movie. Don Cheadle appears uncredited and it is little wonder given his atrocious Cockney accent. Julia Roberts is largely wasted but gorgeous as ever. The down side is the totally ridiculous plot and a generally plodding pace throughout. Although there is much to like in the movie I found it quite boring overall and my life would not have been lessened had I not seen it.,Null,0,1,4 December 2002
Spirited Away," Delightful Visual Joy
","Not many Japanese animated movies have made it into the mainstream. However, Disney chose a winner with this. It is such a breath of fresh air and so deserved the Academy Award. The tale is engaging, the visuals stunning and the long running-time just flies in. There is something for both kids and adults and it truly is a great experience. Reccomended",Null,0,1,7 May 2003
Man on the Moon," You Better Believe it!
","Jim Carrey becomes Andy Kaufman in this film. It is his best role to date. Love him or hate him Kaufman certainly was a unique comedy performer but,come the end of this movie, you certainly are none the wiser as to what made him tick. In this sense ,as a biopic  the movie does not work and you are left with the feeling that Milos Forman  is trying to make a 'clever' movie for movie people. Carrey is great and De Vito and Love are superb in their supporting roles but one is left with the feeling,like REM say in the soundtrack, that watching the film has been like pushing an elephant up the stairs",Null,0,0,13 March 2001
Saving Private Ryan," God Bless America
","This movie has extremely high production values. Superb direction, great acting,magnificent special effects are all present here.It is only the script that is lacking.The story is contrived and slight with sentimental and unrealistic dialogue.The opening thirty minutes are breathtaking and the movie is well worth seeing for this sequence which is one of the most convincing battle scenes on film.However, the rest of the film,while good, is just too long.Black marks to Steven Spielberg for his unsympathetic portrayal of the German soldiers.Generation after generation of American film-makers have portrayed the Germans as cruel people in war movies.I would have thought a director with the distinction of Steven Spielberg could have seen the German Army from a more human perspective.It was not only US soldiers who suffered in the war.Despite the realism,this was another movie where America and good ol' American values win the day. This is one movie that suffers on Video and TV.Ideally should be seen in the cinema to get the full effect",Null,4,7,7 August 2000
28 Days Later...," Nearly 2 Hours Later
","There's little doubt that Danny Boyle and Alex Garland are talented in directing and writing respectively.The first half hour goes in superbly well. From there on it all gets a bit gory and nasty. Nothing wrong with that per se but you might expect some thrills too.However these are in short supply.Cillian Murphy is also not strong enough an actor for the lead though he is not bad. Brendan Gleeson is miscast in a supporting role and the excellent Christopher Eccleston is wasted playing a daft soldier.Naomie Harris is very appealing in the role of Selena and I am sure we will hear much more of her in the future. As usual in Boyle's films, the use of music is great and the soundtrack album should be well worth having.The scenes of Jim walking through a deserted London are memorable and the DVD extras explain how they managed to pull it off. Overall, 28 Days.... would have been better if a bigger budget had been in place.However,there is much merit in the movie and it probably will become a great cult favourite of the future.",Null,0,0,3 August 2003
Pi," Proof Of The Pi
",This movie is like a bad dream with numbers. It certainly is different form the usual Hollywood fare. That does not mean to say it is any good. The story is crazy and while the movie was cheaply made it does not look it. The trouble with pi is that you are always aware you are watching a 'movie'. You can't get lost in it or suspend disbelief. No doubt there is directorial talent here but this dark mathematic tale is not a particularly worthy vehicle.Better to come.,Null,1,2,21 March 2001
Caddyshack," It's The Rodney Show
","Yes,there are some clearly dumb moments in this movie and there are some needless crudities. However,this movie is worth seeing for Rodney Dangerfield.Every scene he is in is just hilarious from his arrival at the golf course to his turning-up at the yacht club, he really is hysterically funny8 out of 10",Null,0,0,15 June 2000
The Insider," You Can Call Him Al!
","Nobody in the movies shouts quite  like Pacino. This is probably his best performance since Scent Of A Woman.Great support from Russell Crowe as the put-upon former tobacco man and Christopher Plummer is also wonderful as the legendary Mike Wallace of 60 Minutes fame.Based on a true story,Michael Mann keeps up the interest throughout the long running time and gives us a tale of corporate responsibility and double dealings conflicting with journalistic integrity and personal loyalties. The story of the responsibilities of tobacco companies is likely to be an ongoing one for many years and this movie, as well as being entertaining, provides a good starting point for finding out all about the subject.",Null,0,0,1 April 2001
A Clockwork Orange," A Fruity Wind-Up If Ever There Was!
","They certainly don't make them like this anymore.On release this was a big commercial production from a big studio. Must have been fun down at the local Odeon back then.Seen this for the first time recently wondering if it deserved all the raves , controversy etc.Firstly Malcolm McDowell is fantastic as Alex and it is a real shame he is best known these days for hamming it up in Hollywood. I must admit I found most of the characters in the movie quite scary. The story is clever and mostly thought-provoking. However, it is not a comfortable view and still powerful and shocking despite its age. If for nothing else it is worth seeing for Alex's rendition of Singing In The Rain. You will never forget that!",Null,0,0,6 March 2003
The Godfather: Part III," The Big Sleep
","The first time I saw this movie, I fell asleep in the cinema and woke up with a half hour to go not having a clue what was happening. I later saw the movie on video and when it came to the original part where I woke up,I still did not have much of an idea as to the proceedings despite being totally awake.This movie is nearly a Turkey and is only saved from being so by high production values and a mostly good cast. Not on a par with the first two Godfather movies. Made solely for the money and it shows. When will Francis Coppolla make another good movie? We can only wait and hope that he gets motivated. There is no doubt he is capable",3,4,7,22 May 2000
Love Actually," London? Er, No actually
","London has never been more unrecognisable in a movie since Dick Van Dyke went dancing over the chimney tops in Mary Poppins. The bit about 9/11 at the start was very sickly and unnecessary and kind of put me off Love Actually before it got going.The actors, however, do make this movie work. With such a great ensemble cast it was always going to be good. There are too many stories on the go plot-wise and a trimming of the length of the movie  would have made it better. It is interesting to note that on the DVD version there are loads of deleted scenes and Richard Curtis says in their introduction that the movie was considerably longer and he had a problem reducing the length to the eventual running time.So there!Love Actually is a good romantic comedy peppered with swear words and some crudity but is nice for  all that. I just feel that if it contained a cast of complete unknowns it might not have worked at all.Best to see on DVD with much extra features.",Null,3,7,25 March 2004
Jaws," Fun In The Water
",Jaws has lasted the years well.It still has great atmosphere with brilliant acting and directing. There is just so much packed into this film it merits being seen time and time again.Peter Benchley tried many times to recapture the success of Jaws in his writings but this was the masterpiece where his often rambling novel was honed down to a superb exciting screenplay. The many sequels to this movie are best avoided.,Null,0,1,30 August 2000
Vanilla Sky," Snoozerama
",I took about seven attempts on DVD to watch this pretentious load of tripe!This movie is all style and no substance. It is a mad rollercoaster ride of image and boredom. The whole thing baffled me even after the director's explanation on The DVD and I would say I am fairly intelligent.It is only worth watching for the babetastic Cameron Diaz and Penelope Cruz and also for the great soundtrack,Null,1,2,7 November 2002
Any Given Sunday," Stone Me! It's Football
","The trailers for this movie looked great. Pacino shouting the way only he can, forceful directing from Oliver Stone,James Woods and Dennis Quaid in supporting roles and, don't forget, the glory of football.The actual film is a total disappointment and is yet another cliche -ridden , predictable sports movie. Like Spike Lee's He Got Game ( on the subject of Basketball) this movie promised much but failed to deliver. The film is long and long-winded and is quite frankly dull for lengthy periods. Pacino's presence is the saving grace and keeps the whole thing afloat long past the time where you have given up caring what happens to any of the characters. Maybe movie-makers should leave sports alone or stick to documentaries on the subject as recent efforts such as Any Given Sunday have been tiresome.",Null,0,0,21 February 2001
Space Jam," That's More Than Enough Folks
","Michael Jordan playing baseball. That certainly belongs in the world of Looney Tunes and would be really laughable if he hadn't tried to do so in real life. As well as being rotten at baseball he makes Jackie Chan look like Anthony Hopkins on the acting front and he is playing himself. However,this movie is really enjoyable. It is a film for all the family though is really aimed at the kids. It is well-paced and there is never a dull moment as Michael and the cartoon characters take on the aliens.It would be great if cartoon characters could enter the real world.Just imagine Elmer Fudd as Secretary General of the United Nations or Daffy Duck as Mayor of New York.Still, better leave the toons to Michael.",Null,0,2,29 August 2000
Signs," Preacher Mel? No Way!
",Disappointing. Miscast and mostly dull and uninvolving. I had great expectations after The Sixth Sense but this is mighty boring and downright laughable in the last 15 minutes. The script is one almighty snoozefest. Phoenix is lost in this movie and Mel tries hard but never cuts it as the preacher who has lost his faith. Predictable movie that is trying to be worthy and philosophical at the same time but really goes belly-up early on and never recovers. Those responsible for this  should have known better. Not reccomended.,Null,2,3,22 March 2003
The Sixth Sense," Thrills Without The Slashes
","This is an excellent film.It is intelligent,exciting,well-written and directed.Movies like this are an antidote to the usual 'slasher'movies that usually top the box office lists. It proves that you don't need to show a whole lot of blood and gore to create an eerie atmosphere.It is a shame that such original films as this are increasingly rare in Hollywood where there tends to be an over emphasis on sequels and rehashing of old TV series.Reccomended.",Null,0,0,12 August 2000
Tarzan," Hollywood Goes To the Jungle
","Only in a cartoon could Tarzan become so clean cut and American.However, the animation is great and there is much to keep the kids happy here. Phil Collins'songs though seem out of place and appear to have wandered in from a different film. Yes I know one is an Oscar winner but this Best Original Song award is really a bit of a nonsense  these days.  Disney animated movies are all quite short but they cram in so much to a short running time. Movie makers in general should realise that a short length can be a good thing. Another thing to notice about Disney animated movies is that they always have the same bad guy though they do change his name from movie to movie.",Null,0,0,5 September 2000
Gangs of New York," Do You Wanna Be In My Gang ?
","GONY was so long in the making and realisation. It looked as if it might not see the light of day at one stage. One story going the rounds was that Scorsese wanted to release a version lasting over 4 hours and had many arguments with producer Harvey Weinstein concerning the release date and running time. So what do we have? Firstly the movie does look quite edited. The editing is done well but some of the plot does seem disjointed. The set of old NY is great,in fact it is much too good as in admiring it I was losing track of some of the action taking place.Also, because the set is so authentic you are always aware it IS a set and this stops you suspending disbelief and prevents you becoming immersed in the tale.Leo de Caprio never convinces in his role and Cameron Diaz joins the long line of gorgeous prostitutes in the movies a la Julia Roberts though she does her best with a nothing part.And so on to Daniel Day-Lewis. The last thing I had seen him in was The Boxer which was OK.Then he just disappeared.It was said he was working as some kind of craftsman in rural Italy. It was only a matter of time before he returned to the screen. He is too good an actor to be sitting about sewing leather in a Tuscan farmhouse. As Bill The Butcher he is totally menacing. He clearly relishes the part and plays it just the right side of going over the top.A truly memorable screen baddie.The true story of the unrest in NY at the time shown is a fascinating one and despite some shortcomings Scorsese does well. Before it was released there were rumours that GONY was a turkey. It most certainly is not that and,while not a classic,was definitely a worthwhile venture though obviously a pet project for Scorsese.Fantastic on DVD with mucho extras!",Null,0,0,28 July 2003
Gladiator," True Epic .
","Okay, Gladiator is not high art. There are huge gaping holes in the screenplay. Much of the story is predictable and some special effects are just plain silly. However, this movie is great escapist fun with magnificent acting especially from Russell Crowe whose towering presence defines the whole film. It is a chance for us to get lost for a little while in a different world. Ridley Scott looks at Ancient Rome with a truly epic vision and shows the horror of the gladiator games with a terrifying reality that is also pure entertainment.Reccomended.",Null,0,0,4 January 2001
Goodfellas," U Got The Look
","Warning! Spoiler Ahead. A magical movie.It's all about looks. The look Paulie gives Henry at his betrayal in court. The total mad smiling look of Jimmy Conway as he finally loses control of his sanity. Acting, directing, superb  soundtrack ,dialogue to die for. This movie has it all. Point of interest. This should have been a great launching pad for the acting career of Ray Liotta.However,he has been involved with so many Turkeys it is a wonder they have enough left for Thanksgiving in the USA.
