The Blair Witch Project," Look past the backlash
","Funny, but had this film not been so incredibly succcessful, I imagine people would be much more likely to praise it.  It's hard for any film to live up to the hype that surrounded this one.  Try to take a step back and judge the film on its own merits.  It's innovative and very effective.  It's actually a miracle how good the movie is, considering the conditions under which it was made.  The directors and edit should receive major credit for making something out of the footage they had.And the acting was superb.  Please don't say that it wasn't really acting. That's absurd. This isn't a hidden camera situation.  These three actors knew exactly what was going on - they were shooting a movie.  Sure, the film crew tried to scare them, but in the end these three were acting.  The fact that so many people claim that the actors weren't acting is just testament to how well they acted.  We bought every second of their act.  As Heather Donahue was quoted as saying (and I'm paraphrasing here), 'A pile of rocks is not scary.'  Meaning, there was a lot of acting going on.",Null,0,1,30 April 2003
Meet the Parents," everything went right here.
","So rarely does Hollywood turn out a decent comedy, that you've got to stand up and take notice of this movie.  It manages to be funny and entertaining at the same time. No small feat these days.  This movie works on two levels.  Yes, it's hilarious.  It really is. But it also works as a thriller.  I know that sounds silly, but this movie had me on the edge of my seat.  At certain points, I couldn't even look to see what horrible turn the plot might take.This film deserves all the success it's had.  And that's so rare.",Null,0,1,30 April 2003
The Exorcist," Simply terrifying
","I first saw this film as a kid, and couldn't sit through it.  It literally scared me out of the room.  Then I saw it as a teenager - same effect.  It wasn't until I was an adult that I sat down and watched this thing straight through - albeit it in the middle of the day with all the lights on.  I just can't understand how some of you don't find it scary. Perhaps you're too cynical.  It's a movie, you've got to go with it.'The Exorcist' is William Friedkin at his best.  Interestingly enough, many of the scenes in this film that don't take place in the little girl's room are the spookiest. Friedkin has infused every scene with a foreboding and volatility.  Particularly frightening are the scenes in the hospital when the girl is getting tests done.  An interesting comment on modern life.",Null,0,1,30 April 2003
Platoon," disturbing and poetic
","This could be the best war movie ever made.  I haven't seen another film before or since that as successfully drops the audience into a war zone and keeps them there for the entire running time.  The film is as heavy as they get.  You may need a nap after you see it.  It manages to be terrifying and poignant and dramatic.  Performances are first rate all around (a young Charlie Sheen could act), screenplay is stellar, directing is as good as it gets.  This is Oliver Stone breaking out, and man did he break.",Null,0,1,30 April 2003
Cube," flawed but entertaining
","First of all, I think you have to give this film credit right off the bat for being so  incredibly different.  These filmmakers tried damn hard to show you something you  haven't seen, and in many aspects the film succeeds. First, the bad news.  Some of the  acting here is sub-par.  Some of it stands out in stark contrast to the professionalism of  the rest of the film.  The actor who played Quentin has a few particularly stagey  moments. His crazy-eyed stare could've been taken down a few notches and been more effective.  He tries so hard to act insane; it feels like acting.  But those are only a few  moments.  Overall, the guy's pretty believable and carries a good portion of the show.Directing, editing, cinematography - all well done.  I was told that, in reality, only one  room existed, but was shot in such a way to make you feel as if it were an endless maze.   Very clever.  The movie contains a surprising amount of gore.  Several scenes took me  back.  I didn't expect this level of gore in a small independent, and smart, film.  Nonetheless, it's effective gore.  It ups the stakes. 'Cube' is a suspenseful film that definitely deserves a look.  But be warned: if you're a  moviegoer who prefers to be spoonfed (this film does NOT do that), or who requires a  black and white conclusion, skip it.  It's a little more challenging than what you're  looking for.",Null,0,1,30 April 2003
True Romance," a misfire
","It's too bad about 'True Romance.'  Judging from the screenplay, this could have been a fine film.  That is, with a different director.  Tony Scott is responsible for the mess that is 'True Romance.'  He clearly can't do subtlety.  He doesn't know when to tone it down. He doesn't know what's funny about the screenplay.  He plays every moment huge and overblown.  A stylistic choice, you say?  Please.  Take a look at Tony Scott's credits.  'The Last Boyscout', 'The Fan,' 'Beverly Hills Cop II.'  Did he mean to make these films the overwrought bores that they were?  That's all he knows how to do.  It's really a shame that his brother didn't direct 'True Romance.'",Null,3,9,30 April 2003
