The Rock," Amazing movie
",The story is good and very interesting. The drama and the actions scene and the humors of the character. Ed Harris justified the role of brigade general wants to correct the lying in U.S Military. Also the one who played the role of Maj. Anderson who justified the importance of preventing mutiny. Also Sean Connery played great and Nicholas Cage also. My favorite part on this movie is the arguments of Gen. Hammel and Maj. Anderson. I love the lines. You can feel the intensity and the principles they believed. And also i like the explosive scene such as the capturing Humvee's in the road scene. I vote 9 of ten to this movie of Michael Bay.,9,2,3,21 June 2006
Saving Private Ryan," one of the top war movie made
","This film supposed to be one of the most acclaimed movie made by Mr. Spielber after E.T. you can see the improvement of the sound effect, the reality of war that you can see to the other movie. I like this movie because of the story. Its amazing how Mr. Spielberg got some big actors to play to the characters he made.The battle in the beach is one of my favorite part in the movie, you can see the reality and truth about the war.The other one is the part of questioning their leader why 8 men risking their lives to save just one. I've noticed that you will always follow the order or before you obey. All actors was great such as Tom Hanks, Matt Damon specially Giobanni Belluci and others. This movie is one of my all time favorite.",10,2,3,25 June 2006
The Da Vinci Code," the most controversial next to schindler list
","Well! this movie captured my attention, i don't have time to read it in the book, they said that the story is great but I'm not a patient reader. But when this i heard that Tom Hanks is doing this film i'm so excited to release this film. Now i've already watched the movie a month ago when it show her in Philippines.I'm a believer of Jesus Christ, I'm a sacred catholic, I've watched the movie to test my faith.I noticed that there is several scene that i shocked. Realizing that the there is a another story behind's Jesus real identity. Actually there's no changing in my faith after I've the film. Dan Brown's wants to test us the faith that we had. Tom Hanks justified the role of Robert Langdon, the story is great and the other character.. I've give 7 out of 10 rating for this. Why? As I've said I'm more than believer for Jesus.",7,0,1,21 June 2006
Titanic," one of the best drama movie i've seen
","Well! this film catched the hearts of million viewers all over the world. By the way, this film was released early in 1997, but i've watched this film late on 2000. What a late bloomer. Some people say's this is a great and very touching movies. So I tried to search a original copy of this film and luckily i found it. It's very touching you know. The story lines, sound effect and flow of the story. I've feel I was there in the unsinkable ship together with the other passenger when its sinking. What a masterfully done by James Cameron.The actors are greats such as Leandro and Kate, they justified the role they played in the film. I cry in the scene that jack is dying in the freezing water, and rose try to wake up jack when she see the rescuer to catch them. I'll give 9 out of ten in this film. It was great.... ever...",10,0,2,25 June 2006
