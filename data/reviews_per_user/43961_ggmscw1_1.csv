Walk the Line," Unreal experience!
","I'm not much of a 'theater-goer', costs too much, the lines are too long, and there isn't usually a movie interesting enough that I can't wait to watch it in the comfort of my own living room! But 'Walk The Line', WOW!!, this is a first movie that I've gotten a buzz to see in the theater in a long time, and man was it worth it! I was worried though, being a southerner and a long time Johnny Cash and June Carter Cash fan, I just wanted it live up to and do justice to the life of 'The man in black' and his rock and soul mate. And well it did! J. Pheonix absolutely personified Johnny Cash, the first time he was on stage in Texarcana, and you hear the growl in his voice when he says, 'Hello. I'm Johnny Cash.', it makes the hairs on your arms stand straight up and sends chills down your spine. But the real surprise was Reese Witherspoon as June Carter Cash, it's the little things that make her performance absolutely unforgettable and breathtaking! I don't know if you've ever been below the Mason Dixon Line, but we have our own way of saying just about everything. Anytime you can rhyme words like flower and hour, or power and our, well that's just pure southern drawl right there! Reese even had that little high pitched 'I mean business, but can be sweet as pie all at the same time' twang in her voice throughout the entire film. I can't even describe the feeling of 'coming home' that I got while sitting in that theater tapping my foot to every beat coming out of the speakers and the silent sing along I was having! I laughed, I cried, I felt, really felt something throughout the entire movie. Passion is what drove Johnny and June, you can see the passion between Jauquin and Reese, and you can feel the passion that drives this movie into being a movie that will be hard to beat for a long time to come!",Null,2,5,21 November 2005
