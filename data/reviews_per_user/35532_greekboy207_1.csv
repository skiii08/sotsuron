Sucker Punch," Very Powerful And Mesmerising But It Needs More
","I think its a highly impressive movie with a lot of energy and emotion, In fact it strikes people a lot because some of these things can happen in real life. However I believe strongly of the fact that the stories of how the other characters ( the 4 friends of the main character and the dancing teacher) got into the mental place, also how the owner of the place got it for starters, it certainly needs more story and work behind it. I also think it could have been just a bit more realistic. Its a shame how a simple but powerful movie could have had more in it. As a summery of all, it had the best storyline for a suspenseful/sadistic/thriller movie but it was like a draft as if we could have heard the history behind the place. I also think its a big shame how the movies a dream of a dream because it kills the feeling in it.",7,0,0,20 January 2012
