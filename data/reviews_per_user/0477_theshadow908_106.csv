Scarface," Brian De Palma's classic
","Scarface is about a Cuban refuge named Tony Montana who comes to the United States in the spring of 1980. When he and his friend arrive in Miami, they get jobs as small time drug dealers, but as the film progresses, they work their way up to becoming rich and powerful. However, greed and power consumes Tony, and he digs himself into a hole he can't get out of. Scarface is a good movie, but you have to be in the mood to watch it.The popularity of this film among teenagers like myself is a little skewed. When the movie was re-released in 2003, everything went insane with the action figures, beach towels, t-shirts, and other merchandise. Unfortunately, most teenagers see this as a violent gangster film with lots of swearing. Cool, eh? Or they just want to jump on the Scarface bandwagon. None really see the entire message of the film, which is that greed is not a good thing. This entire movie is an entertaining message. Greed can screw you over. Oliver Stone did a great job conveying that in the script. Ironically, he went on to direct Wall Street, which contains a speech about why greed is good. The plot is good and the dialogue is intelligent (even though it contains hundreds of f-words). The only problem I had was that the movie could have been shaved down to 2 hours. The movie is 3 hours long, and it really drags in some scenes. The movie doesn't get really good until the last 45 minutes.The acting is superb. Al Pacino does his absolute best in this movie. Tony Montana and Michael Corleone are the top on the list for Al Pacino's best acting jobs.Overall, Scarface is highly entertaining as well as a classic movie, but some people might get bored due to the length.7.5/10",7,1,2,9 July 2006
Walk the Line," Excellent biopic.
","If you're a Johnny Cash fan or even if you're not, this is one entertaining movie. The movie chronicles the life of Johnny Cash from his early years up to June Carter agreeing to marry him in my home town of London, Ontario. This movie doesn't really take a lot of liberties like some true stories, but instead sticks squarely to the facts. Johnny Cash would be proud of this film. Joaquin Pheonix and Reese Witherspoon (though they don't really look their parts) do a phenomenal job as Johnny Cash and June Carter. Every actor in the film put their all into the role and it made it great.This movie has just the right amount of balance between Cash's personal life and his professional life, and it keeps the viewer entertained. Joaquin Pheonox did his own signing for the role, and though it wasn't dead on like Johnny's it was eerie how close it was. Reese Witherspoon was also surprisingly good at singing. She really deserved the best actress win at the Golden Globes, and Joaquin deserved his win as well, and I think that they might have a chance at the Oscars. It really is a shame that Walk the Line isn't nominated for Best Picture, because I think it might have won.This is one of the best films of 2005, and one of the best biopics I've ever seen. Definitely see this movie. It's a good time.8/10",8,4,6,5 March 2006
Mission: Impossible III," The first summer blockbuster of 2006.
","In this installment of the popular Mission: Impossible series, Ethan Hunt has quit the field to train new agents at the IMF. The reason he quit is because he wants to start a family. When he is pulled back into the field for a rescue mission, he begins to go on the hunt for Owen Davian, a dangerous arms dealer who is searching for a device that could cause world wide destruction. I found that M:I-III is more like the first film because it got back to having real emotion and mixing great action scenes with an actual story. M:I-2 was basically a no brainer all action popcorn flick. Now, J.J. Abrams is no Brain De Palma, that's for sure, but he brings the general feel of the first film back.There was something about Tom Cruise's performance in M:I-2 that made it not like the first film. He played the character differently. Mission: Impossible III brings back the Ethan Hunt I know. Of course, the great Ving Rhames returns as Luther Stickell, and I was pleasantly surprised that he got a larger role in this film. Laurence Fishburn did a great job taking over for Anthony Hopkins from the second film.Mission: Impossible III is a great movie, and there wasn't too much I scoffed at. However, at times the dialogue is really corny because there's a love interest this time around. The dialogue isn't as engaging as the first film, and that's the only thing that keeps it from being on the same level. Mission: Impossible III is the first big summer blockbuster of 2006, and it's worth the price of an admission ticket.7/10",7,0,2,7 May 2006
Lucky Number Slevin," Entertaining, but kind of flat.
","Lucky Number Slevin tells the story of a man named Slevin Kalvera, friend to a man named Nick Fisher. One day Slevin is at Nick's apartment waiting for him when two gangsters show up informing him that he owes 'The Boss' all kinds of money. No matter how much he explains that he's not Nick Fisher, 'The Boss' won't let up. He wants Slevin to kill a rival gangster's son. Unfortunately, this rival gangster, 'The Rabbi', wants something from Fisher as well. Throw into the mix a legendary hit-man and a curious girl next door, and you're well on your way to discovering the mystery behind the movie.The first thing that threw me off about Lucky Number Slevin was how misleading the trailer was. The trailer made it look like a happy, purely for entertainment popcorn flick, but it ended up being a gangster drama. The writing was really good. I enjoyed listening to the characters talking back and forth because the dialogue was so snappy and precise. I had to laugh at how great it was. The movie contains a fair amount of action, and as things unfold leading up to the ending, it's fun to try and piece the puzzle together. However, at the same time the plot is kind of flat and underdeveloped. I don't really know how to explain it. It's a contradiction. Cool things happen throughout the movie, but the plot isn't that deep. The movie starts, some cool twists and turns occur, and it ends with no character development or anything.The performances are pretty good. Ben Kinglsey, Morgan Freeman, and Bruce Willis are good no matter what role they're in, and they're all great here, although Bruce Willis didn't really have a whole lot to do in the movie. It was nice to see Morgan Freeman play a real bad guy for once (unless you choose to count Hard Rain and Shawshank Redemption, where he plays a bank robber and a murderer). Josh Hartnett was pretty good as Slevin. I'm not a huge Lucy Liu fan, so she wasn't very thrilling.Overall, this is good for one viewing, because it has some great twists and turns and a good ending, and some really good performances. It makes you think, but the plot is kind of flat.6.5/10",6,3,7,15 September 2006
Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," Okay kickoff to prequel trilogy.
","Star Wars Episode I is a prequel to the successful Star Wars trilogy in which Jedi Master Qui Gon Jinn and his young apprentice Obi-Wan Kenobi try to stop a war breaking out between the planet of Naboo and the trade federation, and along the way they discover Anakin Skywalker, who they believe could be the Jedi that brings balance to the force.The acting in this movie is good, as well as the introductions to our favourite characters, but some scenes rely solely on special effects, and special effects laden sequences are too drawn out. It seems like the main point of this movie is to show that Star Wars can be done better with CGI, but it takes away from the feel of the original three. I also felt that the story was far too political, focusing mostly on the senate, the republic, and the strain they have put on them due to a possible war.All in all, the movie is okay, but it just doesn't feel like a Star Wars movie. 6/10",6,0,1,12 January 2006
Monty Python's Life of Brian," Doesn't live up to the hype, but it's still decent.
","Monty Python's Life of Brian tells the story of a man who was born across the street from Jesus, and his life as a 33 year old man in Jerusalem. He ends up joining the People's Front of Judea (not to be confused with the Judean People's Front) so he can concoct plans against the Romans. After he escapes capture, 100s of people mistake him for the messiah and begin to follow him around, making life a living hell. I've heard many people praise this as the funniest Monty Python film, and though I disagree, this movie is still classic Monty Python funny.This and The Holy Grail are the two Monty Python movies that actually tell a story. I don't find this as funny as The Holy Grail because the style is different. The Holy Grail had rude humour, but it didn't feature the same amount of f-words, or the unnecessary full frontal male nudity. Of course, like any Monty Python film, there are scenes that are so absurd you can't help but laugh. It was only near the end of the movie that I started to laugh out loud. I really enjoyed how they portrayed Pontius Pilate and his friend Biggus Dickus.Overall, this is a pretty funny movie for Monty Python fans, but it definitely doesn't live up to the hype.7/10",7,3,10,20 June 2006
Fight Club," An interesting and dark film.
","Fight Club tells the story of a boring man with a dull life who meets an eccentric soap salesman named Tyler Durden. The two become friends, and end up starting a 'fight club'. A place where men can vent their anger by beating the crap out of each other. As the movie moves on, the fight club gets larger until it evolves into a terrorist organization, and a shocking twist ending reveals that Tyler Durden is more than he appears. Fight Club is a very interesting film. It's a film I recommend seeing more than once to take it all in. I recall not liking it at first, but when I saw it again, I took it for what it was. A brutally violent and in your face drama/comedy that deals with many of life's problems.The always amazing Edward Norton plays the nameless lead role in the film with Brad Pitt as Tyler Durden. They both play their vastly different roles well, and the relationship between them is more believable than most movies about two friends. The writing and the build up to the ending are crafted so well that you almost get drawn right into the film. Fight Club is a dark and disturbing film that requires a thinker to view it properly. Very good.8/10",8,0,2,8 May 2006
Citizen Kane," The perfect film.
","Citizen Kane is the film that is widely considered to be the best film ever made. It tells the story of Charles Kane, a young man with barely any idea how to run a business, who decides that he wants to run a newspaper. We follow through his life from his childhood all the way up to his death, where he mutters one word: 'Rosebud'. The subplot of the film is a reporter who is interviewing everybody that ever knew or worked with Kane, in hopes of finding out what Kane's famous last word means. While I personally wouldn't call this the greatest movie ever made, it is indeed the perfect film. Anybody who wants to study fine acting and fine directing, need only watch Orson Welles at his absolute best.Citizen Kane is the study of an eccentric's life. He starts out as a young and cocky newspaper editor who eventually becomes an old and wise politician eccentric, building an insanely large mansion on a huge chunk of land just for his wife. The story of the film is very good, and the way it's put together makes the movie very interesting. It bounces back and forth between present day and flashbacks, weaving the story in and out as the reporter begins to get frustrated. Everyone spills their guts about Kane, but not one person can account for 'rosebud'. It seems no one will ever know, except the viewing audience when the classic twist ending is shown. Orson Welles' direction is very good, and you can tell that some present day director's have taken some tips. One of the best techniques is using ground shots to make Kane look larger than life.The acting in the movie is very good, especially from Orson Welles. His awesome voice coupled with his amazing on screen dynamic makes him really fun to watch. Most of the Citizen Kane stars come from the Mercury Theatre radio program that Welles was a part of, and they all do very well in their first time on screen.Overall, this is an amazing film, and though it's not my favourite personally, it is quite possibly the perfect film.10/10",10,1,3,4 October 2006
Amistad," Well made historical drama.
","Amistad tells the true story of a group of slaves en route to America who break free and revolt, killing the crew of the Amistad. They are brought to America where they are put on trial for murder. Also, three separate parties are trying to decide who the slaves rightfully belong to. Now, a young lawyer named Baldwin is assigned to defend the slaves, and he enlists the help of ex-president John Quincy Adams to speak for them. This movie is well directed, and well acted, and well written. Unfortunately, it doesn't have much of an entertainment factor.I think it's fair to say that Steven Spielberg is one of the most talented director's of our time. His movies are always very well made. Some are made for pure entertainment, and some are made with entertainment and a message. Unfortunately, this movie is just a message. Now I'm not saying this movie is bad. Far from it. This movie is as well written and directed as all of Spielberg's films. It has a very noble message that's worth listening to, and it's very historically accurate. It's just that this movie isn't very entertaining. When I say that I mean that this isn't a movie that you say to yourself, 'I feel like watching Amistad', and you invite some friends over and cook up some popcorn. You can't even watch this by yourself. It's a great docudrama for history class, and it's good to watch once just to see it.The acting in this movie is very good. Everybody does great in their roles, but obviously the best performance came from Anthony Hopkins as John Quincy Adams. He gives an amazing speech in the courtroom at the end of the movie that deserves to be on a list of greatest speeches on film.Overall, I highly recommend this movie to everyone, but it isn't a movie that you'll want to watch over and over.7/10",7,0,1,14 October 2006
Dawn of the Dead," Great zombie movie.
","After the events of Night of the Living Dead (whatever version), zombies have continued to spread across the country. There is hardly enough warning, and when the zombies suddenly strike in one city, a small group of people end up trapped inside a shopping mall while the growing numbers of the living dead swarm outside. This is a very well made zombie movie, and probably one of the best horror remakes there is.The entire concept of this movie is creepy, and the style that it's made in, with the shaky camera and fast pacing, manage to heighten the intensity of the movie. The special effects and make-up are as realistic as they could possibly get. The movie contains just the right kind of blend of action and horror, as well as throwing in a touch of comic relief here and there.The acting is extremely good for a zombie movie. When you've got good actors like Ving Rhames and Mekhi Pfeiffer in the movie, you know that there's not going to be any problems in the acting department.Overall, this isn't even a popcorn flick. It's a seriously good horror movie and a great remake.8/10",8,0,0,25 June 2006
Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Man's Chest," Just as good as the first.
","Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Man's Chest picks up 3 years after the first film. Will and Elizabeth's wedding is halted when they are both arrested for aiding Jack Sparrow in his hunt for the Black Pearl. Will is offered a pardon if he can find Jack Sparrow and retrieve his magical compass. He finds Jack running in fear of Davy Jones, whom he owes his soul. Jack and Will are joined by Elizabeth, who has escaped capture, to find the heart of Davy Jones and destroy it. Dead Man's Chest is far more action packed than the original film, but it is a darker, more serious film.Everything that was good about the first movie is good in this film. Once again, Johnny Depp is hysterical as Captain Jack Sparrow. Orlando Bloom does very well returning as Will Turner. The dialogue is just as witty and cool as before. Some parents might not like that this film is darker than the first. Some scenes might even be considered frightening. The character of Davy Jones and his crew aboard the Flying Dutchman are amazing. The CGI in this movie is quite possibly the best special effects I've seen in a movie recently. One of the only problems I had with the movie was the character of Elizabeth Swann. She has changed from the first film. Keira Knightley's performance was just as good, but her character is strongly downplayed. She doesn't have a lot to do with the movie. I personally enjoyed this movie just as much as the first film, but some people may not like the fact that this movie ends in a complete cliffhanger, due to the fact that this was filmed at the same time as the third film. Nothing is resolved at the end, because it's all going to end in the third film.The acting is just as good as the first time around. As for new characters, Bill Nighy is amazing as Davy Jones, even though his face is completely covered by CGI effects. Stellan Skarsgard is great as Will Turner's ghostly father, Bootstrap Bill.Overall, this is an awesome sequel, and the third film promises to be even more amazing.8/10",8,2,5,4 August 2006
Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl," Highly entertaining blockbuster.
","Pirates of the Caribbean tells the story of a group of cursed pirates who kidnap the governor's daughter and take her aboard a ship called The Black Pearl. The woman's young suitor, Will Turner, teams up with the flamboyant Captain Jack Sparrow, the rightful owner of the Black Pearl so they can both retrieve what is rightfully theirs. A journey filled with action and adventure unfolds, and along with it, one of the most entertaining films of 2003.What fascinates me the most about this movie is how great it is, and how much of a success it is, and it's based off a ride at Disneyworld! The first movie based off a Disney ride, The Tower of Terror, was a TV movie with Steve Guttenberg. The three that followed, Mission to Mars, The Country Bears, and The Haunted Mansion, were all flops. When I heard about the Pirates of the Caribbean movie, I wasn't very excited. After seeing it however, I was blown away. The movie is a visual stunner. The special effects are awesome, and the set pieces are some of the most amazing things I've seen on film. The dialogue is witty, with a few jokes meant to go over the little ones' heads. Not only that, but they actually managed to get a great story out of it.The acting is amazing. I was never a fan of Orlando Bloom, but he does well in this movie. I really enjoyed Geoffry Rush as the evil Captain Barbossa. As always, Johnny Depp proves with a knockout performance that he can play any role he wants, however he wants, and it will be great.Overall, this is an amazingly entertaining film, perfect for all ages. I recommend it to everybody.8.5/10",8,0,3,4 August 2006
The Notebook," One of the better chick flicks.
","The Notebook tells the same old girly movie story. A poor boy falls in love with a rich girl, who doesn't really like him at first, but they develop a relationship and become inseparable. When she has to go off to school and he goes off to war, they lose touch, and she ends up engaged to another man. After reading about her first love in the newspaper, she goes to see him, wondering how he's doing. They discover that there's still something there, and they fall in love all over again. This is just another chick flick, but it is one of the better ones.The problem I have with chick flicks is that they're always so depressing. One of the main characters is always dying, or ill in some way. Something always ends up going wrong in the end, and it's done purposely to make teenage girls cry. This movie is different. There's no terminally ill characters, and the main characters end up happy. However, this movie does have the same old formula of rich girl/poor boy. That's a story I'm starting to get really tired of.The acting is pretty good. I had no complaints about how cheesy the acting was, which is also new for me. As a guy, I only watched this movie because Rachel McAdams is hot, but she did do a really good job.Overall, it's still got its corny moments, but it's the best chick flick there is.6.5/10",6,0,1,25 June 2006
The Girl Next Door," A teen comedy that actually has a good story!
","The Girl Next Door tells the story of Matt Kidman, a highly intelligent high school student who plays it safe so he can get into Georgetown University. When he begins dating his new next door neighbour Danielle, he discovers that she is a former porn star and it throws his life off balance as a series of disturbing events begin to plague him. What I like about The Girl Next Door is that when you look at the cover or see the trailers, it looks like a raunchy sex comedy like American Pie. However, when you watch it you'll see that it's got some very funny moments, but also some touching dramatic moments. It has a really good story that separates it from other teen comedies.All of the actors in this movie do a really good job. Emile Hirsch, who I'd never heard of before this really impressed me with his acting skill. He definitely has the potential to move on to greater things. I've seen Elisha Cuthbert in different things like Popular Mechanics for Kids and Are You Afraid of the Dark, but this is her breakout film. Not to mention that she is one of the most smoking hot actresses in Hollywood today, but that's besides the point. She plays her role really well. Timothy Olyphant is hilarious as Danielle's manager.Another good thing about The Girl Next Door is that if you look beyond just the movie, you'll see the film actually has useful messages. Overall, this movie is above and beyond any other teen comedy, and everyone involved deserves congratulations on a job well done.8/10",8,4,5,25 May 2006
Spider-Man 2," A great sequel
","Spider-Man 2 is the continuing adventures of Peter Parker/Spider-Man, only now he's beginning to lose control over his life. Peter Parker is attempting to hold down two jobs, college, and some form of social life. All this while swinging around New York saving lives. Harry Osborn is bitter over his father's death, and wants Spider-Man dead. Mary Jane can't trust Peter anymore. Eventually, Peter decides to give up being Spider-Man...Until an idol of his, Doctor Otto Octavius is in a freak accident and transformed into the villainous Doctor Octopus. Now Peter has no choice but to stop Octavius before he destroys the city. This is a great sequel that holds up to the standards of the first film.Usually, sequels are lacking in quality compared to the first film. Well, not this time. Once again, Sam Raimi manages to use the perfect formula for a superhero film to create this comic book masterpiece. He is able to have realistic conflict among the characters as well as plenty of Spidey action scenes without the movie being overloaded. This movie features a lot more comic relief, which I like in an action movie, as long as it's done right, and trust me it's done right here. Raimi also is able to nail down exactly how stressful it would be to have a low paying job, school, and no social life. So, plot and style wise, this movie is top notch. As for CGI, it has vastly improved from the first film. Is it perfect, no. But it's better. The only small problem I had with the movie was some of the dialogue. There are a couple of lines here and there that make you cringe, such as Doc Ock's line, 'Nothing will stand in our way. NOTHING!', and upon discovering the mechanical arms fused to his body, 'NOOOOOO!', and especially Peter Parker's line to Mary Jane, 'Punch me, I bleed!'.The acting in this movie is a little different from the first film. Tobey Maguire I thought did better in the first movie, the same with Kirsten Dunst. They seem to have chosen a different way to portray their characters, and it's not as good. James Franco is supposed to be more greedy and bitter in this film, so his changed portrayal makes sense. Alfred Molina is very good as Doctor Octopus. He is able to be playfully evil and dead serious very convincingly.Overall, this movie is slightly better than the first film. Spider-Man 2 is a spot on sequel, and it leaves me very excited as to what Sam Raimi will do with the third film.8.5/10",8,0,1,16 July 2006
Blade," Great action film.
","Blade is the story of a vampire/human hybrid that has all of their strengths (strength, agility, regeneration) and none of their weaknesses (sunlight, garlic, silver), except for the thirst, which he keeps contained with medicine. He hunts vampires at night, particularly Deacon Frost, a dangerously power hungry vampire.Wesley Snipes is awesome as Blade. He is able to turn a kind of cool comic book character into an amazingly cool movie character. Everybody plays their roles well. The action in this movie is non-stop. It doesn't let up. The fight scenes are awesome. Blade features one of the greatest sword fighting scenes in cinematic history. The special effects are pretty realistic, save for a few sequences, and they're cool to watch. The movie is really well paced. It doesn't slow down or get boring at all. Everything is really good all around. This is probably one of the better comic book films, and definitely one of the greatest vampire films.8/10",8,0,2,21 January 2006
The Mummy," Great action film.
","The Mummy tells the story of a treasure hunter who teams up with a librarian/archaeologist and her brother so they can travel to the City of the Dead in Egypt so she can find the golden Book of the Living. Along the way, they come into conflict with a larger team who are hunting treasure. Both teams discover the Book of the Dead, and when the librarian reads from it, she unknowingly raises a mummy from its tomb. Now the mummy wants to use her as a sacrifice to raise his lover from the grave, and the treasure hunter must face the mummy to protect her. This is a loose remake of the 1932 horror classic, only instead of a horror, they've turned it into an exciting action film, and it's great.The Mummy is visually stunning as well as a well written and well acted film. It shows what ancient Egypt really looked like, and the sets are really great. The ancient Egyptian sets are probably the most realistic of any film. This movie is really well written and well paced. It has a great blend of action and comedy, which I like in a movie. The special effects are nearly flawless, especially in the scene where a giant wall of sand is chasing after a small bi-plane. The reason this movie is so good is because it manages to take a story that's been done before, re-imagine it, and make it an exciting action movie that never loses pace or slows down.The acting is really good as well. Brandon Fraser does really good as the treasure hunter who will stop at nothing to kill the mummy. Rachel Weisz is very good in her breakout role as the librarian. John Hannah is hilarious as her bumbling brother.Overall, this is a great action movie that makes me anxious to see if Universal can remake some more of their classics with an action twist.8/10",8,0,0,21 June 2006
Brokeback Mountain," Dull, boring, and amazingly overrated.
","I wanted to watch Brokeback Mountain for one simple reason. I enjoy watching movies that have a big buzz or controversy surrounding them. This had both. I read some amazing reviews from many different critics as well. Being a straight 17 year old male, I obviously took a lot of grief from my friends when I mentioned wanting to see this movie. However, I still sat down and watched it...What a huge mistake that was. It was the longest and most torturing 134 minutes of my life. I mean don't get me wrong, I've seen far worse movies, but at least they were so bad they were good. They half way entertained me. This movie did nothing for me.What was good about Brokeback Mountain? The film making and cinematography. Ang Lee was better here than with Hulk, that's for sure. The sets and the way it was filmed were done really well. Heath Ledger and Jake Gyllenhaal were good in their roles. I mean, anytime an actor plays a role that's something they're not, be it gay, handicapped, a serial killer or a drug addict, they have to be a good actor to pull it off believably. They succeeded with that.What was bad? Everything else. The story, the dialogue, the way it flowed, everything. Nothing happens throughout the movie. I could sum it up with 'They meet, they fall in love, they continue to meet until the movie ends'. Really, everything else was just stretched from there. I'm trying so hard to think of how to put this like an actual critic would, but I can't. It was boring! It sucked! I couldn't wait for it to end, and when it did I was relieved.I can't believe all the amazing things that were said about this movie. I think people just gave it praise because they wanted to fit in. Truly overrated.3/10",3,30,73,14 April 2006
The Day After Tomorrow," Enjoyable disaster film, but there are a lot of flaws.
","The Day After Tomorrow tells us about why global warming is bad. In a sped up time frame, we are shown as global warming causes weather impossibilities all over the world, cultivating in a giant super storm that covers 3/4 of North America in ice.The movie starts out good, establishing characters and adding some emotional drama into the budding story. The special effects are amazing when the storms start to happen, and it's almost worth the price of an admission ticket. The tidal wave hitting New York was obviously the climax of the whole film, and it was amazing. We focus on a group of survivors fighting to stay alive in the freezing New York Public Library and on the rescue effort on the way to save them.Unfortunately, this movie resembles a TV disaster film way too much toward the end. What I mean is that throughout the whole movie, it is predicted that the super storm will get larger and larger, and realistically, the entire cast should die and the world should be in ruins. Instead, only North America is destroyed, and the storm just clears itself up, no problem. Also, everybody lives. Just a little ridiculous. Also, Dennis Quaid's acting is only worthy of a TV movie. Everybody else in the movie like newcomer Emmy Rossum and relative newcomer Jake Gyllenhall does a good job.Overall, this is an enjoyable movie, but don't expect it to be the most amazing film you've ever seen.6.5/10",6,0,1,17 April 2006
X-Men," Pretty good comic book film.
","X-Men is based off the famous Marvel comic about the conflict between average human beings and mutants. Charles Xavier is a mutant who runs a school where mutants can go to learn and be safe. However, underneath the cover of the school, he has a strike force he calls the X-Men, sworn to protect humanity from any threat. The X-Men consist of Cyclops, Storm, and Jean Grey. On the other side of the spectrum is Magneto, an evil mutant who believes in mutant superiority and leads his own team, the Brotherhood, consisting of Mystique, Toad, and Sabretooth. When Magneto attacks two mutants named Wolverine and Rogue, Xavier must find out what his old friend wants with them. X-Men is a good movie for anyone who is a fan of the comics or the 90's cartoon series, but people who just want to sit down and enjoy a movie might not like it.The acting is really good. All of the actors involved bring their characters to life with good results. Hugh Jackman made a surprisingly good Wolverine even though he was a complete unknown at the time. Halle Berry is a great actress and she made a really good Storm, even though her screen time was a little under what it could have been. By far the best acting job in the movie is Ian McKellan who tackles the role of the evil Magneto. His voice is ice cold and it makes Magneto seem even more threatening that he already is.The action scenes are great, especially the climactic battle at the end. Bryan Singer breathes a new life into the X-Men and makes their cinematic adventures look as if they're taking place in the real world rather than the comic book world. The only problem with this first movie is that it's basically a two hour introduction to all the characters. If you think about it, not a whole lot happens in this film. The plot isn't that deep, but instead it focuses on establishing the characters and where they stand. Don't get me wrong, this isn't a bad thing, the movie is still good, but like I said, it's more appreciated among fans of the source material.So, X-Men is a good comic book/action film albeit a little underdeveloped, and should be viewed by all X-Men fans.7/10",7,0,0,26 May 2006
Spider-Man 3," An amazing end to the trilogy.
","When Spider-Man 3 begins, everything is going great for Peter Parker. New York finally loves and supports Spider-Man, he's doing great in school, and his relationship with Mary Jane couldn't be better. In fact, he's going to pop the question. Unfortunately, things start happening that get in the way of Peter's plans. Harry Osborn returns as the New Goblin and tries to kill him, he finds out that a new villain called the Sandman is his uncle's actual killer, and a strange alien creature takes the form of a black costume and tries to possess him. The alien begins to make Peter more aggressive as his new found fame goes to his head, making him cocky. Finally, Peter realizes that something is wrong, and he gets rid of the strange substance. Unfortunately, the creature attaches itself to Eddie Brock, a man who has lost everything to Peter Parker, and a new villain is formed. Quite possibly the most evil and deadliest villain Spider-Man has ever faced. Though this movie isn't as good as the first two in the series, it's still amazing and a lot of fun.What I liked about the first two movies was that they had a formula to them that allowed for plenty of personal drama for the characters as well as plenty of action. In this movie, Sam Raimi tries to squeeze in tons of personal drama between Peter and Mary Jane as well as Peter and Harry, and Peter and Eddie Brock, and Sandman and his daughter, and the list goes on, while also having action scenes featuring New Goblin, Sandman, a malfunctioning crane, and eventually Venom. This made certain scenes seem rushed and pointless. I liked that they kept the movie both funny and serious, because the humour in this series has always been a high point for me. The twenty or so minutes where Peter becomes evil were so enjoyable and humorous to me that I just couldn't stop smiling. The plot isn't that bad because it covers all the points that needed to be covered, and by the end of the movie it ties everything up nicely, leaving no need for a 4th film though I'm sure that it will happen. The action scenes in this movie are fantastic. The crane sequence was done really well and featured some of the best special effects yet. Also, the ways Spider-Man maneuvered in that scene were amazing. Both of Peter's fights with Harry were incredibly awesome. They were the most violent and intense fights in the whole series, and I loved them. As with the first two films there were a few lines of dialogue that made me cringe. Sam Lee's cameo in this film was his worst cameo to date. Now, what I really didn't like about this film was the characters of Sandman and Venom. The movie needed New Goblin because it was a continuation, but either Sandman or Venom should have been cut out. My reason is that Sandman was pretty much pointless to the rest of the story, and if he was gone, Venom could have had more screen time and development. If Venom was taken out, his character wouldn't have been destroyed the way it was. Venom had so little screen time that it literally annoyed me. And half the time he was on screen, he retracted his mask so it was just Eddie Brock with a black suit on. I really didn't like what Raimi did with the character, though I am happy I saw him in live action at all. I also didn't like that Mary Jane was whining about Peter being Spider-Man through the whole movie, and that by the time the movie ended, Peter still hadn't proposed.The acting in this movie is just as good as the other two. Tobey Maguire did a good job playing both the good and the evil Peter Parker. Kirsten Dunst played Mary Jane well once again, though I didn't really like her character in this. James Franco did an amazing job as Harry in this movie, especially when he was insane. He gave his best performance in this movie. Thomas Haden Church was pretty good as Sandman, he looked the part, but he didn't really get to do a whole lot with his talent. Topher Grace was funny as Eddie Brock, and he was surprisingly good when he became Venom. He's no longer Eric Foreman to me.Overall, the first two films are better, but Spider-Man 3 is an amazing ending to this trilogy, and if they decide to make a 4, 5, and 6, I hope they can be as epic and as interesting as these films were.7.5/10",7,1,1,7 May 2007
The Prestige," A highly entertaining film with dozens of twists and turns.
","The Prestige tells the story of two magicians, Angier and Borden, who start off working together under another magician. When Borden accidentally (or perhaps purposely) causes the death of Angier's wife, the two go their own separate ways, each becoming famous. A bitter rivalry begins, with each one sabotaging the other, until Borden invents a trick that Angier simply must duplicate, and Angier becomes obsessed with learning the secrets of the trick. This is all I can tell you, because this movie is so filled with twists and turns, that I can't say much else without giving something away.This is Oscar material for sure. In my eyes, The Departed is the best movie of 2006, but this movie is definitely up there. It has an amazing story with twists and turns all throughout. There is not one point in the film where you're not trying to put together some new plot twist. At the end of the movie, when the main twist is revealed, I guarantee that you will have a smile on your face. Christopher Nolan's direction style is very good with this type of movie. Even daylight scenes manage to look dark and foreboding. There really aren't many flaws in this movie. It pulls off being a serious movie as well as a popcorn flick.The acting in this movie is very, and I mean VERY good. Hugh Jackman is awesome as the obsessive Angier, and Christian Bale is amazing as the sinister Borden. Michael Caine is as good as always in the role of Cutter. I really like David Bowie's fantastic portrayal of magical genius Tesla.Overall, this movie is simply amazing, and I'd recommend it to everyone. The acting is great, the direction is great, the story is great, and the twists are amazing. This really deserves some Oscars. See it ASAP.8.5/10",8,1,2,23 November 2006
The Terminator," Explosive action film.
","The Terminator tells the story of a cyborg from the future traveling to the year 1984 to kill a woman who will eventually give birth to a boy that will become a war hero in the future. A human soldier is sent back as well, to protect her. Together, they flee the cyborg, who will stop at literally nothing to destroy the hope of the future. This is a very fun action film that most action fans will most definitely enjoy.The Terminator is embedded into everyone's memory as one of the most recognizable action films ever, as it should be, considering it shot both director James Cameron and star Arnold Schwarzenegger into super stardom. This is also a highly referenced, parodied, and quoted film. It isn't as epic of its superior sequel, but it still manages to pack a wallop. It was made on a relatively low budget, but it still manages to look awesome. I liked how James Cameron successfully mixed together action, science fiction, and suspense to make an exciting movie.The acting in the movie is very good. Arnold Schwarzenegger is obviously perfect in the role, considering it's his best known. Michael Biehn and Linda Hamilton are very well together. Look for a young Bill Paxton as a punk teen.Overall, The Terminator is one of the best action films around, and I recommend it to anyone who likes action films.8/10",8,0,1,5 August 2006
Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid," One of the best films I've ever seen!
","Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid tells the true story of two bank/train robbers from the old west who lead the Hole in the Wall gang. When a man they continuously rob gets sick and tired of it, he hires a 'superposse' to track down Butch and Sundance and kill them. This causes Butch and Sundance to flee to Bolivia and end up trying to go straight, but to no avail. Right from the opening scene to the iconic ending, Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid is perfect through and through.I bought the Ultimate Collector's Edition DVD on a whim because I'd heard so much about it, and boy am I glad I did. I made a goal for myself to set out and see the classic iconic films. This movie was a great way to kick it off. This movie mixes everything that makes a good movie. It has funny, witty dialogue, great acting, great direction, great cinematography, great everything. Whenever a movie can be dead serious and deathly funny at the same, it's gotta be good. There is not one dull point in this movie. Throughout the entire film there is funny and witty scenes. The scenes where Butch and Sundance are constantly being chased by the 'superposse' are both funny and tense. There is one great scene where Butch and Sundance have to jump off a cliff, but Sundance can't swim. Then there's a scene where they have to shoot their way out of a tight spot but Butch can't shoot. Both characters have weaknesses, and both have their strengths. I absolutely loved the ending of this movie. It was one of those endings where it's so obvious what happens that they don't even have to show you. The movie just freeze frames and we hear the sounds of what's going on. It gives you chills.Paul Newman and Robert Redford are both great actors, and they play their roles to perfection. They are so cool, that the characters are people who you want to be like (uh, except for the robbing and killing, of course).Overall, this is one of the best movies I've ever seen, and it's so well made, I recommend it to any fan of classic, iconic films.10/10",10,0,2,12 June 2006
Crash," An amazing statement on racism in North America.
","Crash tells many different stories. It involves many different people. However, all of their lives are inadvertently linked together through one accident. All of the people involved also happen to be prejudiced toward another race in one way or another. This movie just made me feel really rotten about how racist some people can be. I felt particularly bad for the Spanish locksmith that Sandra Bullock's character thinks is a gang member, and then we see him arrive home and discover he is a struggling single father.What I liked even more about this movie was that it really makes you think. Besides the racism, it has another message, and that is you can look at any fender bender anywhere in the world, and the people involved all have their stories, and it all connects. There are so many subtle moments in the film that when you see them, you don't think anything of them, but when you see the ending, it all comes rushing back.The acting in the movie is really good. This is probably one of Sandra Bullock's best roles, and it is definitely Matt Dillon's best role. Paul Haggis is an awesome writer and director, and I can't wait to see what else he comes up with. This is truly a great movie that deserves whatever Oscar's it wins.9/10",9,1,8,1 March 2006
Star Wars: Episode VI - Return of the Jedi," Great ending to the Star Wars saga.
","Though not as good as the first Star Wars, this is probably the most enjoyable one in the series. It tells the story of Luke Skywalker's final confrontation with the evil Darth Vader. This has the most complicated and darkest plot out of all the Star Wars films besides episode III, which makes it a lot more enjoyable to watch. However, it doesn't lose the feel of the first two, which is good. This is probably the best written and best acted of all the Star Wars movies, and the special effects have gotten better too.My only problem with the movie is the Ewoks. Their role isn't as important to the story as you'd think, and their part is way more drawn out than it needs to be. They kind of sucked the seriousness out of the movie.I'd also like to say that I enjoyed the DVD re-release as well. A lot of people complained that the new footage of Hayden Christensen as the ghost of Darth Vader was disrespectful and unnecessary, but I thought it was a cool way to connect the old trilogy to the new one.7/10",7,1,2,12 January 2006
Scary Movie 2," Not that great.
","Scary Movie was a great movie when it came out, so naturally many people were excited with the news of a sequel...Even though the first movie promised there wouldn't be any. Most of the main characters from the first film and a few new ones must spend the weekend in a haunted mansion for a school assignment. The main films spoofed this time around are The Haunting and House on Haunted Hill.Scary Movie was so funny because it pushed the envelope. It was stuff you've never seen in a movie before. Now, in Scary Movie 2 it's old news. There is far too much toilet humour in this movie and it just gets redundant after a while. Of course I'd be lying if I said it didn't make me laugh. It did. The only problem was that it reused many of the same jokes from the first one. That, and it was too short. Everything happens to quickly, and it makes the plot seem sloppy. It's just not as good as the first all around.5/10",5,1,4,16 April 2006
Blade II," A very good sequel.
","Blade II is about the human/vampire hybrid still on his mission to destroy vampires. When there comes a new species that feeds on both vampires and humans, Blade must team up with an elite group of vampires to take them down.This movie really does hold up against the first. The only thing that keeps it from being better is the rather cartoonish CGI sequences. The acting is better this time around, and so is the story and the writing. This movie is a lot funnier than the first, and also has some of the greatest fight scenes I've ever seen. The villain in this movie is a lot more interesting and engaging than in the first movie. The relationship between Blade and the sworn enemies he's forced to team up with is pretty cool to watch. All in all, this movie is a lot of fun.The creature effects are really cool. Anyone looking for a creature feature won't be disappointed. The stunts are better as well. I might as well just sum it all up by saying that Blade II is more exciting, funnier, and has more action and better acting than the first one. The only thing that's disappointing to watch is the pathetic CGI work.8/10",8,0,11,21 January 2006
The Doors," Captures the rock and roll lifestyle perfectly.
","I am a 17 year old student who is just getting into the amazing band that is the Doors. I watched the movie knowing about how Oliver Stone skewed the facts and changed some things around, so instead of expecting a 100% factual biography on Jim Morrison, I watched it expecting an entertaining film with great music...That's what I got.Even though the film isn't completely factual, it conveyed really well what the rock and roll was like for most rock stars. Drugs, alcohol, sex. It all happens in this film. Oliver Stone didn't really do wonders with Jim Morrison's story, but his direction style was really good with this movie. The concert scenes were done really great, and for someone who's just getting into the music, they were really great scenes to watch.The performances in this movie are something else. I'd have to say that from the Val Kilmer movies that I've seen, this is his best performance. He's really a perfect film incarnation of Jim Morrison, even if it's Oliver Stone's version of Jim Morrison. Everybody in the movie does a really good job in their roles, and it was really cool to watch.So if you want a 100% factual Jim Morrison biography, read a book. If you want an entertaining movie about an awesome rock band in the 60's with awesome music, this is a great movie.",8,2,2,30 March 2006
The Polar Express," Terrible. The book is much better.
","The Polar Express tells the story of a young boy who is beginning to lose his faith in Santa Claus. Then, on Christmas Eve, a magical train filled with other unbelieving children pulls up in front of his house to take him to the North Pole. Along the way, the children get into adventures until the meet Santa and learn the true meaning of Christmas. This film is terribly done and butchers the classic children's book.The book was so simple and great. It was a short length, and yet it covered so much. The boy gets on the train, there's a few pages of the journey, and when he arrives in the North Pole, he meets Santa Claus right away. Turning this story into a 2 hour movie was a big mistake. The film makers had to add so many ridiculous things to make the movie 2 hours, that the plot was too stupid to function. The movie is visually dazzling, I'll give it that, but the pointless additions to the story completely bog the movie down.As for acting, it kind of annoyed me that every voice in the movie was Tom Hanks. Maybe he could have changed his voice a little to make it unrecognizable. Also, maybe his name was too big for this movie.Overall, this movie has too many pointless plot points that make it boring compared to the book.3/10",3,3,8,27 June 2006
Rocky II," Very good sequel
","Rocky II picks up where the first Rocky left off. People begin to accuse Apollo of fixing the fight and of being a disgrace to the profession, prompting him to challenge Rocky to a rematch. Meanwhile, Rocky has retired from boxing. He marries Adrian and has a son, but he's having trouble finding a job. Pretty soon it becomes apparent that the only way he can support his family is if he goes back to boxing, so he accepts Creed's challenge and begins training to become the heavyweight champion of the world. Rocky II stays true to the feel of the first film, making it one of the better sequels.Rocky is the single best underdog story ever captured on film, and it was a huge success, and seeing as Rocky lost by split decision at the end of the first film, it was a good idea to make a sequel. Sylvester Stallone wrote and directed this movie, and he made it a lot like the first film, with some added stuff. However, there seemed to be a little of the finesse of the first film missing. It didn't have exactly the same feel. I think it was that the fight wasn't that important in the first film but this movie is all about the fight. This movie is the last good drama in the series before it turned into an action series with the 3rd installment.All of the actors from the first film return to their roles, and everyone does just as good, although Rocky comes across as vastly uneducated in some scenes whereas he seemed to at least have a high school diploma in the first film.This movie is very similar to the first film with what many people would call a more common and likely ending.7.5/10",7,0,0,5 January 2007
Star Wars: Episode II - Attack of the Clones," This entry of the Star Wars saga doesn't fit in with the rest.
","Anakin Skywalker has become a teenager, torn between obeying his master Obi-Wan Kenobi or going all out to show how great he thinks he is. The movie has three purposes. To begin the relationship between Anakin and Padme, to introduce the Clone War, and to show off flashy special effects...That's about it.I didn't enjoy this Star Wars as much as the others because it was too boring. It was basically space filler in between episodes 1 and 3. All this movie does is make connections between this trilogy, and the original trilogy. There's no real story to this. The dialogue is as corny as ever, and I'm not a big fan of Hayden Christensen's whiny portrayal of Anakin. The Yoda light saber fight was impossible to take seriously. This is definitely the weakest entry in the series, though it is still enjoyable.5/10",5,1,2,12 January 2006
The Godfather: Part II," Superior to the original.
","The Godfather Part II is a complicated film. In its 3 hour run time it manages to pull off telling two stories. One that takes place in the 1950s, and one that takes place in the 1920s. In the 1920s we see Vito Corleone arriving in New York City and making a name for himself among the wealthy gangsters, starting a family, and eventually becoming Don of the Corleone crime family. The exact parallel is the 1950s story, where we see Vito's son Michael in his new role as Don of the Corleone family as he starts his own family. The Godfather Part II is a superior film to the original because it tells a much more interesting story, and it does a better job at portraying what an organized crime family is really like.All of the great actors from the original are back including James Caan in a flashback sequence. Al Pacino comes across as a great bad guy, and he seems to be ten times more cold hearted than his father ever was. He's a changed man. He started off a legitimate man who wanted nothing to do with his family's business, but now he's more into it than ever before. This movie features Al Pacino's second best performance in a film (second to Dog Day Afternoon), and it shows what kind of actor he truly is. This is the film that made Robert De Niro a star, and rightly so. Robert De Niro portrays young Vito Corleone on his rise to power in New York. This is Robert De Niro's first big role and he plays it like he's been doing it for years. The best thing about it is that just about every line of his dialogue is in Italian, and yet you still enjoy his performance.The Godfather Part II contains the most realistic view of the mafia ever portrayed in film. In fact it's so realistic that the central characters don't even refer to it as the mafia. The Godfather Part II tells a more interesting story than the original, and it's more fun to sit through. The Godfather Part II is a great film that is both dramatic and epic as well as entertaining. Great movie.9/10",9,0,2,29 May 2006
Predator," Classic sci fi/action flick. Just awesome.
","I've seen too many good action films to make a top ten list, but if I did, I'm sure this would be in there. Predator tells the story of an elite military team that goes into the jungle on a mission from the government, but they end up fighting for their lives against an intelligent alien creature that hunts humans for sport.The story and concept behind this movie are just awesome. Making a sci fi film into a hardcore action film is the coolest idea there is, which is why I like Aliens so much. There is non stop action in this film, and for action fans, it's a really fun ride. The Predator has to be the coolest otherworldly creature in the history of movies. The technology the Predator uses represents movie magic at it's best and most creative. Another cool part of it is that Arnold is in it. I mean, no matter how many times I watch this film, I'll never get over the fact that this movie is not one you'd expect to see Arnold in.Listen, the simple fact is if you're an action fan or a sci fi fan, this is definitely the film for you. You will love it. It's just one of those great American classics with great scenes and great quotes that will never go away.9/10",9,1,2,17 January 2006
The Aviator," Probably the best biographical film I've ever seen.
","The Aviator is an outstanding and epic film about the life of eccentric businessman Howard Hughes. It chronicles his life from his turn as a film director up to when he got his flying boat, the Hercules (or as we know it as, the Spruce Goose) to fly. It covers his relationships with some of Hollywood's most famous women as well as his struggle with obsessive compulsive disorder.In my opinion, this is probably Leonardo DiCaprio's best role. Every single person in the cast literally becomes their role from DiCaprio's spot on performance as Hughes to Cate Blanchett's incredible performance as Katherine Hepburn. I also enjoyed how a few great leading actors popped up in bit roles and played them really well, such as Jude Law as Errol Flynn and Willem Dafoe as a reporter. Martin Scorsese did a great job as always directing this movie. He has a real good eye for the movies he chooses to direct, because he does them all wonderfully. I really think that he was robbed of a best director Oscar. Million Dollar Baby really didn't deserve the best picture Oscar over this far superior film.The movie is about 3 hours long, but if you're interested in this type of film, it shouldn't really matter. It covers all the important things you need to know about Howard Hughes. I would now really like to see a film about the later years of Hughes' life. This is one of the best movies of 2004, and I highly recommend it to everyone who likes an epic film.8/10",8,0,1,1 March 2006
The Bourne Identity," An awesome spy film.

He goes on a journey to find out who he is and what he did for a living. Along the way he finds out that he was a lethal spy, and now he is being hunted.The Bourne Identity is an entertaining action film. The chase scenes are awesome, and the fight scenes are well choreographed and well filmed. Though the movie changes a lot from the book, it still has the same feel to it, and it flows just as well. All of the actors in this movie did a good job in their roles, especially Matt Damon who shows his diversity in this movie.The Bourne Identity is a thrilling action movie with a great story. The movie doesn't slow down. I definitely recommend this movie to anyone that enjoys a good action movie with a deep plot.8/10",8,0,1,4 February 2006
Terminator 3: Rise of the Machines," Not as good as the first two.
","Terminator 3: Rise of the Machines picks up years after the events of Terminator 2. Cyberdyne has been destroyed, the war has been averted, but John Connor is still afraid. He drops off the grid. He drifts from town to town while there is no record of his existence. Now, a new terminator called the T-X is sent back to kill John Connor once and for all, and once again, a T-800 model is sent back to protect him. He finds out the war has only been delayed, and now he must try to find a new way to stop it. This is a fun, action packed film, but it doesn't live up to the first two.James Cameron is no longer the director, which is the film's first problem. Next, the style is too different. A lot of comic relief was put into the script, and at some points it was highly unnecessary. The story in this movie only manages to confuse anybody that was paying attention to the second film. There are too many questions that go unanswered at the end of this movie. What I did like about this movie was that it finally showed us how the war started, and that was really cool to see. I also liked all the references that were made to the second film, like when John Connor asks the terminator if he remembers 'hasta la vista, baby.' Some of the humorous parts got a good laugh out of me, but it just got to be too much at some parts.The acting was pretty good. Arnold played the role that he created perfectly. Nick Stahl did a very good job taking over for Edward Furlong. Kristanna Loken does well as the new Terminator.Overall, this movie contains a lot of action, humour, and is really fun to watch, but it's a disappointment after the second film.7/10",7,1,2,6 August 2006
"I, Robot"," Good action film.
","I, Robot tells the story of a detective in the future who doesn't trust robotic technology at all. When a murder is committed, he believes a robot did the killing even though everyone tells him it's impossible. He goes on a hunt for the robot to find out the truth and winds up getting pulled into a mystery even he wasn't expecting. I, Robot is a good action movie, but it's purely for popcorn entertainment.The movie has some good messages about big businesses and technology, but all of that is washed away by the fact that the plot is mainly a guy with a futuristic gun shooting down robots. While this movie is really good to watch when nothing else is on or you want to get lost in a movie, it's not a movie that anyone should take seriously. It doesn't stick very close to the plot of Isaac Asimov's book, so fans of that might not like it. I high point is the special effects. The special effects are very good and the fight scenes are awesome.As for acting, it's all just okay. Will Smith was never that amazing to me. He's always the same guy. A smooth talker that makes witty jokes as he saves the world from ultimate destruction. Yes, he plays the part well, but let's see something different. Shia Lebouf is in here as the detective's younger friend, and though he doesn't have a lot of time on screen, his character is a little annoying.Overall, this movie is really good to watch, but it's not a masterpiece that deserves to be praised.7.5/10",7,0,1,6 June 2006
Over the Hedge," A typical animated family film.
","Over the Hedge tells the story of a rogue raccoon that has to gather food for a vicious bear, but he only has a week to do it. He stumbles upon a group of animals living in a park surrounded by a suburban area, and he tells them he can find them food. However, he is actually gathering food for the bear. As the animals befriend him, he ends up getting them into trouble with an exterminator and a woman who lives in the neighbourhood. When the animals find out what he's really up to, they all leave him, but now it's up to him to save them from the lethal exterminator. This movie is entertaining, but compared to all the other animated animal movies for kids, it's nothing special.Lately an abundance of animated films featuring cute fluffy animals have been released. I remember back in the early 90's when computer animated films with fluffy animals were something new and different. Now these movies just don't seem to have a soul anymore. They're all exactly the same and they follow the same formula. There's always a character that everybody likes, but then they find out that character's a liar or something, and then the character has a change of heart at the end. It always happens. It's the same with this film. It has some really funny moments and a few entertaining scenes, but overall, it's not that impressive because we've seen it all before.This movie has a great cast. Every voice you hear belongs to a talented actor or actress (except for Avril Lavigne of course), and it makes the movie just a bit more entertaining. The best voice work comes from Bruce Willis and Steve Carell, who do good in their roles.Overall, this movie has it's moments, but it's nothing new and exciting.6/10",6,0,0,15 November 2006
Terminator 2: Judgment Day," The best action film in existence.
","Terminator 2 picks up many years after the first film. Sarah Connor is in a mental hospital, and her son John is a rebellious pre-teen. Now, a far more sophisticated robot has been sent back to kill him. However, another T-800 model has been sent back as well, only this time to protect John. Together, they rescue Sarah and go on the run to stop the upcoming nuclear war in its tracks. Not only is this film far superior to the original, but it is far superior to any other action film as well.James Cameron did a great job turning the first Terminator film into an action classic. He does an even better job this time around. It's obvious that this movie was made on a higher budget than the original, and thank God for that. The special effects in this movie are just awesome for what was available at the time. The liquid metal T-1000 looks amazing when he shape shifts. The action scenes are explosive and amazing to watch. The story and dialogue is all around better in this movie. What I liked most was how the human emotion element was used. John Connor grows attached to the Terminator sent to protect him, and he teaches him how to use phrases like a human, smile, and give high fives. The relationship between John and the Terminator, and how Sarah says 'out of all the would be fathers, this machine was the only one who measured up', really makes the movie much cooler than the original.The acting in this movie is really good too. Edward Furlong is great as young John Connor. Arnold is awesome in the role he created. Linda Hamilton makes a strong improvement from the first film. She is more of an action hero this time around instead of a victim, and that makes her character better.Overall, this is a spectacular action film that anybody who likes action will love. This is far superior to the first film, and one of my personal favourites.9/10",9,3,4,6 August 2006
Apocalypse Now," Chilling Vietnam story
","Apocalypse Now tells the story of a soldier who is sent out to find and terminate Col. Kurtz, a highly decorated war hero who has been driven insane by the horrors of Vietnam. We follow Captain Willard and his crew through their journey up the river to find Col. Kurtz, including battles among the enemy as well as amongst themselves, and we see the toll war can take on the human mind. This is a chilling portrayal of the Vietnam war, and it's not your usual war movie.Francis Ford Coppola was hot off the success of The Godfather, The Godfather Part II and The Conversation when he tackled this movie, based off a book called Heart of Darkness by Joseph Conrad. Coppola went through utter hell making this movie, but it was all worth it, because he churned out a good project. This movie isn't your conventional tale of war. It is more a tale of the inner turmoil that can be caused by war. The action scenes are few, but the dramatic scenes are so well done that you find yourself not craving the action. I truly enjoyed the style the film was made in. The movie starts off with a realistic atmosphere, but as Captain Willard's journey progresses, things begin to look more and more unhinged, more and more surreal, until he reaches the utter insanity of Col. Kurtz's base camp.The performances in this movie are great. The movie is filled with great actors including Martin Sheen, Marlon Brando, Laurence Fishburne, Harrison Ford, Dennis Hopper, and Robert Duvall, and they all give knockout performances.Overall, this is a very chilling and very stylish war film, and I'd recommend that anyone who watches it not sit down expecting a film like Platoon.8/10",8,0,1,25 August 2006
Disturbia," Best thriller I've seen in a while.
","Disturbia tells the story of a teenage boy named Kale who is sentenced to three months house arrest after punching a teacher in the face for making a comment about his recently deceased father. When his mother takes away his TV and his computer, he resorts to spying on the houses surrounding him. Things begin to get frightening when he begins to suspect one of his neighbours is a serial killer. He gets his friends involved with his impromptu investigation, and soon the neighbour realizes he's being watched...And he's not too happy about it. Disturbia is loosely based off the 1954 Alfred Hitchcock classic Rear Window, but it is still a film all in itself, and it is the best thriller I've seen in a while.What makes this movie better than most horror movies that are released today is that is doesn't rely on excessive gore and gross out tactics to frighten you. It relies on mood and suspense, and that works so much better. As the film went on, the tension got so high that I was literally on the edge of my seat rubbing my hands together because I was so anxious to see what was going to happen next. I actually felt the adrenaline rush that the characters in the film must have been feeling when they were snooping around in the neighbour's garage. The movie has a realistic feel of how creepy it would be to have a serial killer living across the street from you and you had no way to prove it. Everything in this movie is done well. The writing, the directing, the way it all pans out. I was actually shocked when I left the theatre over how good this movie really was.The acting was very good from everybody involved. Shia LaBeouf has come a long way from Even Stevens. Something tells me that he has a nice career ahead of him. David Morse is perfectly sinister as the neighbour. He's just one of those actors that you might not know who he is to hear his name, but he pops up here and there and you always say, 'Cool, it's that guy.' Overall, this was an amazing thriller, and I'm glad I went to see it because I really wasn't expecting that much. It leads me to wonder why Hollywood continues to pump out absolute garbage like the Saw trilogy, Hostel, and Dead Silence when they could be making movies like this instead.8/10",8,291,434,15 April 2007
Edward Scissorhands," Pure, unbridled entertainment.
","Edward Scissorhands tells the story of an artificial man who was never completed, and has pairs of scissors for hands. He is brought down to the real world where he falls in love with the daughter of the woman who took him in. Gradually, the neighbourhood begins to lose trust in Edward, and he is forced to run away forever.Tim Burton could direct a movie of Johnny Depp reading a phone book and I'd watch it, just for the artistic value. Tim Burton's warped perception and the style of his art are perfect for this type of movie, and it makes for great movie-making. Tim Burton uses pastel colours and elaborate costumes to portray what suburban life was like in the late 50's or early 60's. It's always bright and shining in the neighbourhood. In direct contrast is the dark and creepy castle with storm clouds hovering over it 24/7, that serves as the home to Edward.Johnny Depp gives a strong emotional performance as the kind, but naive Edward. Every role in this movie is expertly filled. Alan Arkin is especially funny as the oblivious husband of the woman who took Edward in. Vincent Price is great in his final role before his death as the man who put Edward together.Edward Scissorhands is an unconventional love story, but it's still one with raw emotion. It's the perfect movie to watch around Christmas, because it has a very Christmassy feel to it, at least towards the end. The thing I love best about the movie is that the WHOLE film, the character, the love story, everything, is given to us as an explanation as to why it snows. SPOILER: Snowflakes are shavings from ice sculptures that Edward is carving.This is probably one of the most well written, well acted films in cinema history. One of the greatest.10/10",10,1,2,20 April 2006
The 40-Year-Old Virgin," A pretty funny movie.
","Lately comedies have been going really down hill, but I have to say, this one is pretty funny.This movie is about Andy, a 40 year old nerd who collects action figures, spends his weekends shopping for materials to make a sandwich, works in an electronics store, oh, and he's never had sex. When his co-workers find this out, they go on a mission to get him a one night stand, but disaster awaits him at every try.All of the performances are pretty funny. Steve Carell is really making a name for himself with comedies now, and he's getting more and more offers...Rightfully so. This movie is non-stop funny, and it has some truth in it too. It's an all around good movie, better than I thought it would be.7/10",7,1,2,13 January 2006
Face_Off," Awesome action film.
","Face/Off tells the story of an FBI agent named Sean Archer who is in charge of taking down a dangerous terrorist named Castor Troy. Troy is also responsible for the death of Archer's son 6 years earlier. When Archer puts Troy into a coma, he discovers that there is a bomb ticking somewhere, and only Troy's brother knows where it is. Archer decides to undergo a new surgery that transforms him into Castor Troy by taking Troy's face and putting it on his head so he can find out the location of the bomb. Unfortunately, Castor wakes from his coma and forces the doctors to turn him into Sean Archer. Now Castor Troy is living with Archer's family while Archer sits in jail. He must now figure out a way to escape and convince everybody that his is who he says he is, as well as take Castor Troy down once and for all. This is an amazing action movie that's loads of fun to watch.First off, the plot of this movie is pretty cool. Originally it was meant to be set in the future, but I think the story would have been way to generic if it was. Thankfully they set it in the present day, and I think it really does the movie justice. Apart from having a really cool original story, the movie features some really awesome action sequences that for the most part are pretty believable, and for me, believable action sequences make an action movie so much better. I think there was a really good balance between actual story and the action, which is good.The acting is very good in this film. This is a perfect film to show acting range. When it starts out John Travolta is the good cop and Nicholas Cage is the sadistic maniac, and then they suddenly switch roles, and it goes off perfectly. John Travolta plays Nicholas Cage playing a psycho really well, and Nicholas Cage does a good job of playing John Travolta playing a good cop. Truthfully, I liked Nicholas Cage better in the role of Sean Archer than John Travolta, and I'm happy that was the way it was through the majority of the movie rather than vice versa.Overall, this is a great piece of work from John Woo, a really fun and entertaining action film, actually a good film all around.8/10",8,4,7,1 February 2007
Spider-Man," Not since Superman has a comic book film had this much impact.
","Spider-Man, based off the Marvel comic book, tells the story of geeky high school student Peter Parker, who is bitten by a genetically altered spider, and wakes up the next morning with amazing new powers. At first he attempts to use these powers for personal gain. When a wrestling promoter screws him over, he lets a criminal rob him. Later, his Uncle Ben is shot and killed by the same man. He realizes that he can't let that happen to anybody ever again, so he becomes Spider-Man. Not long after, his first big threat arrives, the maniacal Green Goblin, who, unbeknownst to Peter, is the scientist father of his best friend.The reason Spider-Man was such a big hit is because it had the same epic potential as Superman. The fan base was huge to begin with, so hype for the movie was unequaled by anything else. The reason I liked it so much was because it followed a perfect superhero movie formula. Adequate time was spent on all the aspects of the story. The origin, the honing of his special powers, a few fights with petty criminals, the first fight with the villain, a small confrontation in between, and the final climatic battle. In between all of this is the personal drama. Sam Raimi was able to successfully tie all that in and make it work in the 2 hour time frame. He was able to show how Peter Parker's life changes when he becomes Spider-Man.Raimi set the world of Spider-Man in a realistic world. A lot of people didn't like the Green Goblin in this movie, stating he looked like a Power Rangers villain. I disagree. Norman Osborn created an armoured flight suit for soldiers to wear, so the armoured green suit was perfectly fine with me. Spider-Man is, in my books, the most accurate comic book movie out there, besides Sin City at least. Another thing some fans missed was Spider-Man's trademark wisecracks toward his enemies. While this is a part of his character, I thought it made him more serious. I mean, who can really think up that much stuff to say while deep in battle. Also, the situation isn't that funny, so why make jokes? What disappointed me most about the movie was the campy dialogue in some scenes. Some of the lines that come out of characters' mouths in this movie are way too cheesy. Also, the CGI is really underdeveloped. Other than that, this movie has nothing wrong with it.The acting is really good. I hated the idea of Tobey Maguire playing Spider-Man until I saw the movie. Now there's no one else. He really shocked me with how well he played the role. I didn't know he could be tough when he wanted to! Willem Dafoe is great as Norman Osborn/Green Goblin. He plays the perfect bad guy, and plays a great nut case too.Overall, Spider-Man is a great comic book film, and if the dialogue was 100% cool throughout the movie and the CGI was flawless, it would get a 10 out of me. I recommend this movie to anyone that was ever remotely a fan of Spider-Man.8/10",8,0,1,13 July 2006
Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban," While still a good movie, it's the worst of the series.
","Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban is the worst film in the series, because too much of the style has been changed. Chris Coloumbus set a standard for how the Harry Potter universe should look. He had everything done a certain way, and it was perfect to the Harry Potter mythos. Now, a new director has come aboard with a completely different vision, and he did it his way.The story and the settings are dark, which is accurate to J.K. Rowling's book, but the style of everything seems off. In the first two movies, they wear their wizard robes through the whole film. In this, they wear their normal clothes. There's no reason given, and this isn't from the book. The story seems to rushed because the director cut so much out of the book, and then didn't come up with a way to connect everything that's in the movie. This movie just isn't as enjoyable as a Harry Potter film. It still provides a fun time of course, but it just doesn't feel the same.As always, the performances are top notch. Gary Oldman is perfect as always in the role of the wicked Sirius Black. David Thewlis is great as the new Defence Against the Dark Arts teacher with a dark secret.6/10.",6,1,1,14 January 2006
The Fast and the Furious," Exciting for the racing scenes. The rest of the movie...Not so much.
","The Fast and the Furious tells the story of an undercover cop who infiltrates a gang of street racers looking for the person who's been organizing highway robberies against transport trucks. However, the deeper he gets, the more like them he becomes. I personally think that this movie had potential to be really good, but instead it was just okay.I'll start off with what made the movie worth watching. Cars, cars, and more cars. Anyone that likes fast cars and cars racing and cars crashing will definitely get their share from this film. All of the racing scenes are expertly filmed with the camera examining the engine and the exhaust pipe as the car speeds up. There's also the fact that the film involves cops and robbers, so there's violence and gunfights as well. Unfortunately, that's about it...The plot isn't terrible, but it could have been better developed. It isn't complicated enough. The plot is really simple. I don't want to say that not enough happened, because it did have enough, but there was just something about it that didn't seem complete. And the acting? Well, as you can expect, the acting wasn't that great. Paul Walker looked bored half the time, like he didn't want to be there. Vin Diesel? Well he's just a bad actor anyway. Overall, The Fast and the Furious is a fun action film, but if you take it seriously...It sucks.5/10",5,0,1,7 May 2006
The Exorcist," A movie that'll leave you with the jitters.
","The Exorcist tells the story of a young girl who becomes possessed by the Devil. Her mother doesn't know what's wrong with her, hiring doctors and psychiatrists. Eventually, the possession gets so bad that she finally turns to a priest who is losing his faith to perform an exorcism on her daughter.The Exorcist isn't my favourite horror film, but I can definitely see why some people love it so much. I'm of the opinion that any horror movie that involves religion at all is especially creepy. This movie is no exception. Every scene that deals with the possession is strongly disturbing. Linda Blair does great as the possessed little girl and she really has to be congratulated for her acting here, considering the things she had to do and say in this movie were far too mature for her. Every role in this movie was expertly played, so you can't really complain about corny 70's acting.The plot of the film is really good. The fact that it is loosely based on a true event makes it creepy going in. Then you have all the disturbing scenes in the film like the spider walk down the stairs, or her head spinning 360 degrees. Mercedes McCambridge makes the film, providing her incredibly creepy voice for the voice of the Devil. The creepiest thing about this movie however, isn't the Devil's voice. It's his face. Subliminally throughout the entire film, the Devil's face pops onto the screen for less than a second and disappears. This is what leaves you scared after viewing the film. Just the thought of seeing that face on your wall.The Exorcist is the definition of a classic horror film.8/10",8,2,4,23 April 2006
Die Hard 2," Good entry into the franchise.
","Die Hard 2 picks up two years after the first film. John McClane is back with his wife after moving to Los Angeles and transferring to the LAPD, and now they're in Washington visiting her parents during Christmas. McClane is at the airport to meet his wife's plane when a group of American terrorists take control and refuse to let any planes land, including the one carrying his wife. Once again out of his jurisdiction and facing an incompetent airport police captain, John McClane finds he's the only one willing to do anything about the situation, and he sets out to save his wife along with hundreds of other people. Die Hard 2 is a good follow-up to the first film.Die Hard 2 takes much of the same awesome action sequences and plot devices and moves it from an office building to an airport, adding some new twists and turns along the way. John McClane continues to be an everyman type of hero that's easy to like. He's fast talking, funny, and he gets the job done. The supporting characters in this movie prove to be awesome allies to McClane or huge pains in the ass, which is fun to watch. The humour in this movie is just as hilarious as the first film, keeping you laughing between all of the explosions. The only problems that I really have for Die Hard 2, though minor, are that some of the action scenes are a little more unbelievable this time around, and the main villain in this film, though really rotten, isn't as exciting as Hans Gruber from the first film. These two minor problems don't really effect the enjoyment of the movie though.The acting is still great. Bruce Willis does just as well in this film as John McClane. Dennis Franz is good as the headstrong airport police captain who doesn't think he needs McClane's help. William Sadler is good as the American soldier turned terrorist that McClane must stop.Overall, Die Hard 2 is an awesome sequel to an equally awesome film.7.5/10",7,1,3,1 August 2007
Quantum of Solace," A few things missing, but overall a good entry to the series.
","In this direct follow up to Casino Royale, British secret agent James Bond embarks on a mission to take down the mysterious organization that Le Chiffre was working for, and also blackmailed Vesper Lynd into betraying Bond. Bond's new target is Dominic Greene, a proclaimed environmentalist with a crooked plan to buy up Bolivia's water supply before staging a coup d'etat. Bond maintains that he is simply fulfilling his duty, but M knows that he is acting purely out of vengeance for Vesper's death. Quantum of Solace is an action packed film, and definitely an enjoyable watch. It succeeds in taking James Bond in an entirely new direction, however there are certain things missing that could have made it that much better.Despite what some movie critics and classic Bond purists will tell you, this is a very good James Bond film. Casino Royale was a reboot, and in rebooting the franchise, the makers of these films are trying to take the series in a new and more refreshing direction. Daniel Craig's James Bond is the coldest, most ruthless killing machine on the British secret service, just as he is described in Ian Fleming's novels. However, despite seeming almost robotic when he's doing what he needs to do, Daniel Craig is able to play Bond's more human side as well. Action scenes aren't so easy for Bond to get through anymore. He can miss his mark when he's making a jump, he can slip and fall, he can get hurt. What makes it better is that when he gets up and keeps going, you can see that he's in pain but he's fighting past it. He's also more human on an emotional level. There is a scene where he's sitting at a bar, drunk out of his mind, and staring at a picture of Vesper with a look of absolute heartbreak on his face. I think this is the most distraught I've seen Bond over a woman's death since On Her Majesty's Secret Service. I enjoyed how Bond made his way through this entire film without having to use any sort of special gadget. While Bond's gadgets are a trademark, I think this new take on the series is trying more for a sense of realism. I also think it makes James Bond seem much more capable when he's using his own strength and intelligence to get out of situations. I also enjoyed Dominic Greene, the main villain of this film. He was unlike any main villain I've seen in a James Bond film before. He was a small, meek looking man that only had his power to wield as a weapon, unlike most of the villains who appear menacing due to some trait like being mountainous in size, having a vicious scar or a bleeding eye. When he finally has to fight Bond, he is actually terrified out of his wits, blindly swinging an axe praying that he will hit Bond before Bond hits him, because he knows if that happens he'll be done for.Now, as I said, this is in no way a bad James Bond film. It's taking the series in a great new direction. However, as a fan of the series overall, there are some things that I missed that I think should make a return. First of all, missing characters. While I don't feel it's completely necessary to bring Q back just yet, I think the famous M's secretary Miss Moneypenny should make a return soon. The scenes between Moneypenny and Bond are always a small highlight to the films, just to see how many smooth and flattering ways Bond can reject this poor woman. Secondly, while I do think that James Bond should be a more serious character than he has been in the past, I don't think it's necessary for his humour to disappear completely. I think the odd pun or one liner should be allowed to pop up here and there, and Quantum was completely devoid. The third problem I had with the film was that it seemed far too rushed, and the story wasn't all that fleshed out. I felt like this film was serving as filler material until the next film in the series when Bond will undoubtedly take the evil organization down. Also, I want the series to return to the format where each movie is disconnected from the last. And finally just a few nitpicks. The gun barrel sequence needs to be at the beginning of the movie. I felt like it was put at the end only to be different. Also, though the opening credits sequence was classic James Bond, the song could have been much better.7/10",7,1,3,21 November 2008
Alien vs. Predator," Entertaining, but not as good as it could have been.
","In AVP, a group of scientists headed up by Charles Bishop Weyland, who's descendant would go on to create the Bishop android from Aliens and Alien 3. They go to explore it and accidentally discover two warring alien species.This movie is an all around good time, very entertaining, because if you're a fan of the Alien and the Predator, you see your favourite characters in action, however, this movie doesn't really have the feel of the other six movies it's based off of. The first mistake was taking two successful R-Rated franchises and combining them into a PG-13 movie. All of the intense action, gore, violence, and horror from the other movies are gone.Another problem I have is that they totally ignored the plots from the other movies. The Predator, who normally gets a thrill out of hunting humans, is totally changed in this. He forms a friendship with the lead girl and she helps him dispatch the Aliens.So, while this film is fun to watch, it is nothing like the Alien and Predator movies, and it's just not the same experience.6/10",6,2,3,16 January 2006
Liar Liar," Jim Carrey's funniest film.
","Liar Liar tells the story of Fletcher Reede, a hotshot lawyer, father, and ex-husband with commitment issues. Every single time he promises something, he doesn't do it. After upsetting his 5 year old son, his son wishes that for just one day his father couldn't tell a lie. The wish comes true, and hilarity ensues as Fletcher struggles to lie himself out of situations when nothing but the truth can leave his lips. Liar Liar is a comedy with a message, and with Jim Carrey's hilarious style, the movie is a guaranteed fun time.Tom Shadyac and Jim Carrey apparently work really well together, because all of their pairings have been hilarious. This is a god comedy for Carrey because he's not playing a zany character like a pet detective, a dumb limo driver, or a superhero on steroids. No, instead he plays a normal every day guy. An intelligent lawyer who just doesn't make time for his son. Only when he can't spit out a simple lie, such as saying a blue pen is red, does the movie get truly hilarious. He suddenly finds everything he cares about crashing down around him because he can't lie, and Carrey's hilarious facial expressions and actions just amplify the already funny situation. The fact that the movie makes several jabs at the lawyer profession and that the movie actually has a message behind it makes it a better comedy than most.I am a huge Jim Carrey fan. Have been ever since I first saw him in Ace Ventura. His movies of late haven't been all that satisfying, but I can always turn to Liar Liar to make me laugh. Most comedies are funny for the first two times you watch it, but afterward they become dry. As for Liar Liar, it keeps me laughing every time. Overall, it's a really good comedy that I think most people will enjoy.8/10",8,0,1,14 June 2006
The Lost World: Jurassic Park," A very good follow up.
","4 years after the events of Jurassic Park, John Hammond calls on Ian Malcolm and asks if he'd like to visit Jurassic Park Site B, an island without fences or boundaries where the dinosaurs were bred. Hammond wants to send Malcolm and three others to see how the dinosaurs are surviving. Ian initially refuses, but when he finds out that his scientist girlfriend is already on the island, he decides to go on a rescue mission. Upon arrival, the team discovers that Hammond's nephew has sent in another team to capture the dinosaurs for another attraction...This time in San Diego. The Lost World: Jurassic Park features more dinosaurs, more action, and the lack of boundaries gives it a more natural feel, making for a really exciting action film.One of my pet peeves is when a director doesn't want to do a sequel for his own movie. Luckily, Steven Spielberg knew this movie would be good and stayed on. His perfect style of direction is ever present making the style of the movie just as fitting as the first time around. I personally think the plot of this movie is better than the first. I like Sir Arthur Conan Doyle's The Lost World for the same reason. I like a plot that involves dinosaurs running free on an island. It allows for better and more open action scenes. The Velociraptors are far more terrifying than in the first film, and the addition of another T-Rex is genius. All of the new dinosaurs in this film are perfectly done. Quite honestly, The Lost World: Jurassic Park is just as good as the first in all ways but one...The acting.Jeff Goldblum was never a favourite actor of mine, but I thought he was okay in Jurassic Park. In this movie, he's back to the way I know him. He talks in that stupid voice all the time that he's been stereotyped with, and he is so wooden that it makes the giant trees surrounding him look like better actors. Vince Vaughn plays the same character he always does, the wise cracker with a funny voice. I'd have to say the best acting job in the film is done by Pete Postlethwaite, who plays a hunter intent on bagging a T-Rex.Overall, The Lost World: Jurassic Park is just as good as it's predecessor, but the acting is a little off.7.5/10",7,1,2,9 June 2006
The Number 23," Not bad, but it could have been better.
","The Number 23 tells the story of a man who starts to read a book called The Number 23, about a detective who begins to go crazy connecting the number 23 to everything, eventually ending with the detective committing murder. This scares the man because he finds a large amount of points in the book that mirror his own life. He himself begins to go crazy with the number, and as he reads on, he finds that there is more mystery involved with the book's origins than he could ever imagine. This is a well made, entertaining film, but it fell flat towards the end.First off, this movie is made very well. The visual style of it is very dark and Gothic which was kind of cool. The scenes depicting what was happening in the book were awesome. They had a kind of surrealistic tone to them which was cool. It looked kind of like film noir which made it look really good. The movie was a pretty good mystery once the main character begins looking for a killer that's on the loose. Unfortunately, the movie just isn't that creepy. Some of the things said about 23 are a little chilling, but it just seems pushed and overused in some parts. This movie, like most of its kind, has a twist ending. Though I won't say what the big twist is, I suppose I can say without giving anything away for sure that it's a highly overused and clichéd twist ending that I was unable to find surprising due to the fact that I've seen it done so many times. In my opinion, the movie was pretty good right up until the last, oh let's say, 23 minutes.Jim Carrey's performance was surprisingly good. I usually don't like it when he plays a serious role, but because there was a few humorous points, this role seemed to suit him. His performance as the detective in the novel was actually really cool. Everybody else's performances were just okay.Overall, this was a cool, well made movie that kind of fell apart in the end. There was definitely room for improvement.6.5/10",7,40,64,26 February 2007
Ghost Rider," Entertaining, and that's all I wanted it to be.
","Ghost Rider tells the story of stunt motorcyclist Johnny Blaze who sold his soul to the Devil as a teenager to save his dying father. When he's an adult the Devil returns to cash in on the deal, telling Johnny that he will become the Ghost Rider, a spirit of vengeance sent to capture anybody who's escaped from hell. His target: Blackheart, the Devil's son, and three elemental demons, Earth, Wind, and Water, who intend to create hell on Earth. As Blaze struggles to gain control of his powers, his childhood sweetheart Roxanne returns, and he's forced to protect her from the evil forces around him. Though not the best comic book movie ever made, this movie was entertaining just like I wanted it to be.First off, Ghost Rider was never really a top notch Marvel character to begin with. He has a smaller group of fans than someone like Spider-Man or the Hulk, but it's an interesting story and this movie definitely had the potential to be better than a lot of comic book movies. Unfortunately, it ended up just being a fun action film to watch when you've got nothing to do. The story wasn't bad, and the action was a lot of fun. All the Ghost Rider scenes were cool. The best part was his ride up a skyscraper where he lassos a helicopter and tells the pilot that he's pissing him off. What was good about the film was the action, most of the special effects and some of the comedic moments such as Ghost Rider giving the finger to the cops as he escapes them. Now onto the bad. The villains were weak. Mephisto was alright, but he was off to the side most of the time. Blackheart was an underdeveloped villain that didn't really do much. His three demonic henchmen were even worse. Ghost Rider destroyed all three of them within seconds when there could have been a massive battle there. The climax could have been a tad more action packed too, though it was sufficient. The dialogue at times, was brutal. There was no wit or thought put into any of the one liners. For instance, Ghost Rider says to Blackheart 'You're going down!' and Blackheart hastily replies with an age old classic...'I don't think so.' The acting was okay. Nicolas Cage did a pretty good job as Ghost Rider, and Peter Fonda wasn't too bad as the Devil. Sam Elliot was average as the Caretaker. The worst acting in the film came from Wes Bentley and especially Eva Mendes. He acts with one tone of voice and one facial expression, she acts like she's in a high school play and it's her first time.Overall, I wasn't expecting a Spider-Man 3 or a Batman Begins, but I was expecting a fun movie to see on a Saturday night, and I got it. For entertainment purposes, Ghost Rider delivers.6.5/10",7,24,44,19 February 2007
X-Men: The Last Stand," Save The Best for (The) Last (Stand).
","In this amazing third entry to the X-Men franchise, a man named Warren Worthington invents a cure for mutation. This angers Magneto, so he gains an army hundreds strong to tackle the problem from its source, a young mutant. However, the X-Men, who have been facing dark times after the return of Jean Grey (now the evil Pheonix), are banding together to fight Magneto one last time, and stop the cure from going into production. This is the best of the three movies due to it's great plot, the extravagant action scenes brought by new director Brett Ratner, and the addition of several new mutants.This X-Men film has a great plot that couples amazing action sequences with a real story that involves all sorts of conflict from the X-Men to the Brotherhood, Jean Grey to herself, and the humans to the mutants. The political and real life subtexts are too many to count, and it gives the film a more emotional base. You actually have to stop and think that if this was really happening, what side would you be on? This movie has many plot points that you're not expecting to happen, and it makes the film really exciting to watch. Screenwriters Zak Penn and Simon Kindberg take advantage of the fact that this is the last film in the trilogy by tying up all of the characters' story lines. I can't tell you exactly what happens, but some characters die, while some characters discover new sides to themselves. The series really ends nicely...Until the last scene, and an extra scene after the credits where it leaves it wide open for a 4th entry, even though we know the 4th entry won't come.The new mutants in this film are very well handled by the actors playing them, and it makes really interesting characters. Kelsey Grammar's Beast is as great on screen as on the comic page. He played him perfectly. I was worried that Dr. Fraiser Crane wouldn't be able to pull off Beast's brute fighting skill, but when that time came, my jaw dropped at how cool it was. The only mutant I had a problem with was Angel, who was over-hyped in the trailer and yet only had two scenes. Magneto showed some new tricks in this film, including one with the Golden Gate Bridge, and it was amazing to watch. Brett Ratner's direction when it comes to action is top notch.X-Men: The Last Stand is a non-stop action film that is worth all X-Men/action fans seeing. Great film.8.5/10",8,35,73,26 May 2006
The Elephant Man," A powerful true story
","The Elephant Man tells the true story of Joseph 'John' Merrick, a man so savagely deformed that he is part of a freak show, and he is called the Terrible Elephant Man. A doctor from the London Hospital discovers him there, and rescues him from his violent 'owner'. At the London Hospital, John Merrick learns that people do care, and the world is full of good people. This is a touching drama that teaches us acceptance.This movie was filmed in black and white to give it a classic feel, and it certainly succeeds. I couldn't picture this film being better in colour. Even though it was made in 1980, it feels like you're watching one of the great classics of the late 50's/early 60's. The story is very touching and it really makes you feel sorry for the real Joseph Merrick. The whole plot of the film, as well as dialogue between characters, is interesting and it draws you into the story.Anthony Hopkins is great as always in his role as Dr. Frederick Treves, the doctor treating the Elephant Man. John Hurt is absolutely phenomenal in the role of Joseph Merrick. It is quite simply the best role he's ever played.Overall, this is a classic movie that has a strong message of acceptance, and tells the story of a remarkable man who managed to inspire millions.10/10",10,1,1,5 August 2006
Dog Day Afternoon," A lesson in amazing acting and writing.
","Dog Day Afternoon is loosely based on the true story of John Wojtowicz (called Sonny Wortzik for the movie) and his 2 friends who attempt to rob a bank in Manhattan in order to fund Sonny's homosexual lover's sex change operation. The plan is to go in and get out, 10 minutes at least, but before Sonny knows it he's facing the FBI, the NYPD, and the media. We focus on Sonny and the decisions he has to make over the 14 hour period.This is probably the best Hollywood heist story there is. No matter how many they've brought out over the years, none of them have been as thrilling and as well thought out as this. Dog Day Afternoon completely defined the Hollywood heist film. Of course, director Sidney Lumet takes liberties with the true story, but the basic facts of the event are here. Another thing that makes this movie so great is the mix between many different genres that the film goes through. There's heart wrenching drama, there's thrilling action, and there's a dab of light hearted comedy here and there.I personally think they should show this movie in high school drama classes to show what it means to be a good actor. Al Pacino gives his most realistic performance in this movie. Every other actor in the movie gives an explosive performance as well. John Cazale is great as Sonny's partner in crime, Sal. Chris Sarrandon gives an Oscar nominated performance as Sonny's lover.For anyone that is a Pacino fan or a fan of good movie making, this is an essential for your collection.9/10",9,1,2,19 April 2006
Shrek 2," Good sequel, but it doesn't live up.
","Shrek 2 picks up where Shrek and Fiona are now married. They travel with Donkey to Far Far Away so Shrek can meet her parents. Nothing goes right, and Shrek and Fiona end up fighting. Fiona's father even hires Puss In Boots, an ogre assassin, to take Shrek out. However, Puss ends up befriending Shrek, and they set out to foil the evil fairy god mother, who wants Prince Charming married to Fiona. This isn't as good as the first movie, but it's okay.Shrek 2 has a complete change of style from the first film. It is still a good movie for children and adults alike, but the humour is a little more crude this time, even though it will still most likely go over their heads. The humour is actually kind of lacking though compared to the first one. I think the movie focuses too much time on Fiona and her parents rather than Shrek and Donkey. The dramatic scenes might kind of bog the film down too. Perhaps the movie is too ambitious.The voice talent is just as good. We have newcomers such as Julie Andrews, John Cleese, and Antonio Bandaras. They all do phenomenal jobs in their roles.Overall, this is still a good movie for kids and adults, but it just isn't the same as the first time around.7/10",7,0,1,10 July 2006
Saw II," Just as God awful as the last.
","With the massive success of the first Saw, it was inevitable that there would be a second. Of course, you'd think they'd want to improve on it a bit. I guess not. It took only a year to write, film, and produce...That's a bad sign. Of course, the result is terrible.This time around, the Jigsaw killer has a house full of 8 people, yes, 8 people instead of 2, how thrilling, and there's plenty of traps to go around. One of the victims is Det. Eric Mason's son, so this makes it all personal for him.As well as the first one, the concept is kind of cool, but the acting is almost unbearably bad. Donnie Wahlberg isn't really worth the money he gets paid to act. He should leave acting to his brother, even though he isn't even that good either.Like the first film, it ends with a twist. Unlike the first film, the twist is completely ridiculous, and it promises another piece of garbage amateur film that's likely to be pumped out by October of this year.",2,6,12,13 January 2006
Charlie and the Chocolate Factory," Brilliant
","Tim Burton's new Charlie and the Chocolate Factory is destined to go down in history as an instant family classic. It sticks really close to the book, with only one added subplot, and it's a good one.Tim Burton's direction, as usual, is visually stunning. This movie is flashy and colourful, and a lot of fun to watch. All of the acting in the movie is really good, and Johnny Depp has really outdone himself with his eccentric portrayal of Willy Wonka. Freddie Highmore looks like he may be the next Hollywood golden child.Everything in the movie is so well done, there's not much to complain about, except for the Oompa Loompa sequences. I thought the scenes where the Oompa Loompas were singing were too long and drawn out, and kind of goofy.8/10.",8,1,3,13 January 2006
Mission: Impossible II," Totally different style.
","Mission: Impossible was a fast paced espionage thriller that actually made you think, which is what I like in a movie. Since John Woo, who is one of the kings of the action genre, took over for Brian De Palma, you can expect Mission: Impossible II to be an intense action movie with a majorly dumbed down plot. Everything to do with the plot is laid out for us basically right away. Now, all there is to do is sit back and watch those classic John Woo action sequences. In this movie, Ethan Hunt is once again a secret agent, and he is sent on a mission to stop a crooked agent from stealing a deadly virus for his own use.I liked the first Mission: Impossible better because it had a more advanced plot. This Mission: Impossible is just a bland shoot 'em up action film. Now there's nothing wrong with that. The movie was still immensely entertaining. It just didn't fit in with the first film. Even the character of Ethan Hunt, though still played by Tom Cruise, is different. In this movie he doesn't seem as serious about his job. He's more cocky. However, I do like that the character now has absolutely amazing skills in hand to hand combat.Overall, if you're looking for a smart spy thriller like the first film, this ain't it. If you're looking for a fun action film with amazing action sequences, this is it.6.5/10",6,111,160,3 May 2006
The Graduate," Strange dark comedy.
","The Graduate tells the story of a young man just out of college and unsure of what to do with his life. His family annoys him, and life is confusing. He ends up starting a love affair with the much older Mrs. Robinson for reasons he can't even explain, but things get complicated when he falls for her daughter. The Graduate is a strange little film that you might have high expectations about due to it's status in cinema history.The Graduate is a very well made film that has many messages about real life, and that may be what draws a lot of people to it. People who describe this as a comedy are a bit mistaken. It's a black comedy. There are funny scenes, but not that are really laugh out loud funny. The drama in the movie is actually more involving. The plot starts out kind of strange, but it gets stranger as the movie moves on. It actually gets more and more unrealistic as the movie moves on, which is kind of annoying. One problem is that Simon and Garfunkel made up the soundtrack for this film, and people who don't like their mellow form of music might start to get really annoyed. In one sequence of the film, they play the song Scarbourough Fair way too much, and it starts to get annoying.If you want to talk acting, it's no wonder Dustin Hoffman made his career off this film. He does a great job playing Ben Braddock, and he is able to convey stress, fear, and funniness all at the same time. The other fine actors surrounding him in this film only help to amplify his talent.Overall, The Graduate is a good movie, but it's not for everybody. Not everybody will be able to understand its meaning, and not everybody will be able to even sit through it. It's a strange little film.7.5/10",7,0,1,3 June 2006
The Mummy Returns," Not even close to the first film
","The Mummy Returns takes place 9 years after the first film. Rick O'Connell and Evey Carnahan are now married with a 9 year-old son who enjoys exploring as much as they do. Evey has been having strange visions, and it leads her to the discovery of a bracelet that once belonged to the legendary Scorpion King. When her son accidentally puts it on, an evil cult kidnaps him to revive the Scorpion King. Meanwhile, they've already raised Imhotep from the grave once again, and it's up to the O'Connells and Evey's brother John to stop the mummy and find their son. This is a pretty fun popcorn movie, but it lacks the same charm the first film had.The plot to this movie is okay, but it's just not the same as the first one. Too many ridiculous plot devices have been added to make the movie more meaningful, but it fails. For instance, we find out that Evey is a reincarnation of Nefirtiri, a rival of Anck Su Namun in ancient Egypt. This leads to a fight between Evey and a reincarnation of Anck Su Namun near the end of the movie. Wait...Where was this reincarnation of Anck Su Namun in the first film when he needed her? Whatever. There is an action scene involving a bunch of pygmy mummies, and it is one of the most ridiculous scenes in the movie. The character of the Scorpion King was majorly hyped up in the trailers and through word of mouth, but the sad part is that The Rock appears as the Scorpion King for about 5 minutes at the beginning. The movie also uses a couple of the same scenes, such as pillars falling like dominoes instead of bookshelves, and a wall of water chasing a boat rather than a wall of sand chasing a plane. The special effects are terrible as well. The Scorpion King appears at the end of the movie as well, but as a CGI effect so bad, it looks like an N64 video game character.Thankfully, the acting is just as good as the first film. Brandon Fraser and Rachel Weisz are great as a couple, and John Hannah is once again hilarious as Evey's brother. Arnold Vosloo plays the mummy once again, and does a good job, but sadly, due to everything else that's going on in the film, the mummy's return receives the least attention.Overall this is a fun popcorn movie, but nowhere close to as good as the first movie.6/10",6,0,0,21 June 2006
Mission: Impossible," Exciting espionage thriller.
","Mission: Impossible tells the story of wrongly disavowed secret agent Ethan Hunt trying to prevent the theft of a list of all the secret agents in the world with the help of two other disavowed agents played by Ving Rhames and Jean Reno. While all this is going on, he must find the true mole in his agency that set him up.Mission: Impossible is the perfect film for anyone who enjoys a good spy movie. The plot is quick and to the point. It never lets up for a minute. Unfortunately when it comes to spy movies, I'm left stumped with some of the details. With Mission: Impossible, even though they talk about things that are hard for the layman to understand, it can be easily figured out before the end of the film. But who cares anyway? The action scenes are amazing, particularly the famous sequence of Ethan Hunt dangling from a ceiling and catching a sweat droplet so it doesn't trigger the alarm. Since I'm young, I never had the pleasure of watching the TV show, but if it was anything like this movie, I'm sure I'd truly enjoy it.All the roles in the film are played very well. I particularly enjoyed the fact that Ethan Hunt's team is made up of well established actors such as Jon Voight, Emilio Estevez, and Kristen Scott Thomas. You're saying, 'Great cast. This should be good.' Then, without a moments notice, they're all dead in the first 10 minutes.Mission: Impossible is an amazing thrill ride movie, just what you'd expect from the director of Scarface and The Untouchables.8/10",8,7,7,3 May 2006
Saw," The concept is kind of cool, but the film itself? Just awful.
","I really don't understand what attracts so many people to this terribly written, terribly acted, terribly filmed piece of trash. When I saw the story for this film, I really thought it would be the best horror movie of 2004. It sounded awesome. Then I saw it, and I was utterly shocked at how bad it was.As I said, the concept was good. I also thought the twist at the end was pretty cool. Completely unbelievable, but cool. That's it. That's what keeps it from being a 0.The acting is the most atrocious I've ever seen. It's like amateur hour. It's like the director gathered a bunch of teenagers who've never seen a movie before and said, 'Now act!'. Cary Elwes and Danny Glover are generally not bad actors, but something happened to them in this film. Cary Elwes is completely unconvincing. What's worse is that the character of Adam is played by Leigh Whannel, the guy that wrote the thing! He's a terrible actor too.Really, this is a terrible film and it does not deserve the credit it gets.",3,1,1,13 January 2006
The Last Samurai," Great action/war film.
","The Last Samurai is the story of an American soldier who is captured by Japenese Samurais, but as he is kept prisoner there he begins to respect the soldiers and eventually grows fond of them. He ends up befriending the samurais and fighting on their side against the Americans. This is one of the best historical type war movies there is out there, in the vain of movies like Dances With Wolves.The plot of this movie is very good. It shows that there can be understanding between two cultures who are taught to hate each other. The American soldier learns respect for the other culture even as he's their prisoner. And even though he's their prisoner, they learn respect for him. When they end up becoming friends, you can see they'd do anything for each other. The dialogue is also very good, even humorous at times. The fight scenes are perfect. This is one of those movies that puts you right in the battle so you can see what it would really be like.I've always been a Tom Cruise fan. He's a pretty good actor. He seems like a far more down to Earth character in this film though, and it's refreshing. I can't really pick and choose good acting jobs, because they're all good. Overall, this is an amazing film, and I'd recommend it to fans of the genre.8/10",8,1,3,15 June 2006
The Fly," Superior to the original.
","The Fly tells the story of an eccentric scientist named Seth Brundle that has invented a device that teleports inanimate objects but has a problem with transporting live things. He meets Veronica Quaife, an eager journalist that hopes to document Seth's work. They end up falling in love, and in the heat of a moment, Seth goes through the telepod. Unfortunately, a fly gets into the machine with him, and their genes splice together, slowly mutating Seth into a half fly half human hybrid.This remake of the 50's sci fi film is a better film all around with a better plot, better dialogue, better acting and it's creepier. David Cronenberg injects his bizarre style into the film making it a unique horror film. The special effects and make-up were so amazing that they earned the film an Oscar. It's really cool to watch as Seth gets more powerful, but then begins to deteriorate into a disgusting mutation. The film is also filled with raw emotion due to the beauty and the beast love story.Even though there's really only 3 people in this movie, it's not boring at all, and the 3 stars play their roles to perfection. The Fly is a masterpiece, chilling in its delivery with an ending that could cause sensitive people to tear up.8/10",8,0,1,9 May 2006
National Treasure," Good adventure/action flick.
","National Treasure tells the story of a man who has grown up believing he has descended from the Knights Templar, and he must find and protect an ancient treasure. When a member of his team goes bad and sets out to steal the treasure, the man must steal the map, which happens to be on the back of the Declaration of Independence, follow the clues, and find the treasure. This is a very fun popcorn movie with great action and a very interesting premise.I love movies where there is some sort of mystery that needs to be solved. I loved the plot to this movie, where it is explained that clues as to where the treasure is buried are hidden in things we see every day, such as the one dollar bill. Every time a character discovers a clue, a smile is brought to my face because of how clever the plot is. The characters are interesting and watchable, mix that with the plot and there you have a fun movie. The Da Vinci Code has a similar premise (a man finds clues in something we see all the time), but don't kid yourself...This movie is far more entertaining than The Da Vinci Code. This isn't a perfect film, but it doesn't advertise itself to be. You know as soon as it starts that it's just going to be a fun action flick.The acting is really good. I'm usually not a huge fan of Nicolas Cage, but he's good in this movie. The other actors that pop up are what make this really exciting, such as Harvey Keitel, Jon Voight, and Christopher Plummer, and they all do great jobs.Overall, this is a fun action movie for a night in, and it's better than The Da Vinci Code.7/10",7,1,2,24 June 2006
Reservoir Dogs," Awesome crime movie.
","Reservoir Dogs tells the story of 6 total strangers who are gathered by a crime boss and his son to pull off the perfect crime. They don't know any information about each other going in. However, tension and conflict arises when the robbery goes wrong and they decide there must be a snitch in the group. The group spends the film in a safe house, fighting and accusing each other, waiting to be picked up. Reservoir Dogs is a violent and in your face movie, and that's what makes it so great.Before Reservoir Dogs, Quentin Tarantino was a complete unknown. He was all set to make this film with $30,000 and a bunch of friends, but Harvey Keitel wanted to be involved, and the movie became professional. The movie showed right away the talent that Quentin Tarantino had for film making. His artistic camera angles, his intensely violent scenes, and best of all, his intelligent and witty dialogue. Reservoir Dogs is a small movie. It takes place all within a day, all within one place. We don't even get to see the robbery take place. However, this still ends up being a classic film.The acting is great. Harvey Keitel put everything he has into this movie, and Steve Buscemi is great as the neurotic Mr. Pink. This movie serves as Michael Madsen and Tim Roth's most memorable roles, and rightfully so.Overall, this is the great film that introduced Quentin Tarantino to the world, and I suggest anyone that liked Kill Bill but hasn't seen any other Tarantino movies, go back and watch this film.8/10",8,1,3,9 July 2006
Rocky," The greatest underdog story ever told.
","Rocky tells the story of Rocky Balboa, a low life who works as a loan shark for the mafia while boxing on the side as a hobby. He earns the once in a lifetime chance to become something more when the heavyweight champion of the world Apollo Creed decides to give a local underdog fighter a shot at the title and selects Rocky. Rocky accepts the challenge and with the help of Mickey, the owner of the local gym, he begins training his body and mind for the fight of his life. Rocky is a great character story that still holds up today.If there's one thing that critics and audiences agree on, it's that an underdog story usually makes a good film. Well, this is truly the greatest underdog film ever made, and it deserved every bit of praise it received. Rocky Balboa was a nobody, and to him it wasn't about the title. It was about having his name up in lights next to Apollo Creed. It was about doing something with his life other than roughing people up for money. This isn't an action packed boxing movie. It's very character driven. This doesn't even necessarily have to be called a boxing or sport movie. It's more of a drama that just happens to involve a man who boxes. The movie is well paced and well directed. Sylvester Stallone wrote a pretty good script with some good dialogue.The movie is very well acted. Whenever people think of Sylvester Stallone they think of Rocky's voice, but most people should know that that's just the character, and Sylvester Stallone plays it well. Talia Shire does a good job playing shy and making the transition to outspoken. Burt Young is good as Rocky's best friend Paulie and Carl Weathers is good as heavyweight champion of the world Apollo Creed.Rocky is a great classic that still holds up as a good movie today, and I look forward to seeing the latest entry in the series to see how Stallone ends the franchise.8/10",8,1,2,11 December 2006
Inside Man," A good bank robbery film.
","Inside Man tells the story of a man named Dalton Russel, who leads a daring bank robbery that turns into a hostage situation. Now he's dealing with disgraced hostage negotiator Keith Frazier, who is attempting to get to the bottom of things. When the shady CEO of the bank and a woman he's hired to help him protect certain interests arrive, he begins to discover that there's more to this bank robbery than it would seem. This is the only Spike Lee movie I've ever seen, but trust me, I'll see more, since this was a very intriguing film.What I liked about Inside Man was the style it was made. It is choppy, but not so choppy that it's annoying (cough, Domino, cough, Man on Fire), so you get a sense of tension, and it seems very high paced. The plot is good, and very intriguing. There are some things you have to figure out throughout the film, which makes it more interesting. My only problem was that after the bank robbery was over, the film continued for another half hour, and it started to drag a bit. The dialogue in the movie is very cool. There's some humorous and some awesome lines that come out of the character's mouths.The acting is very good. Denzel Washington is good as always as Det. Keith Frazier. Clive Owen gives a solid performance as Dalton Russell. I liked Willem Dafoe and Christopher Plummer. Jodie Foster wasn't as good as she usually is, but she's not in the movie a whole lot.Overall, the movie lags toward the end, but it's intriguing and has an awesome plot.7/10",7,45,65,10 August 2006

","Pulp Fiction tells many stories, but all of them involve the same characters. The movie takes place within a time span of three days and involves a cast of characters that is entirely criminal, including hit men, drug dealers, rapists, petty robbers, crime bosses, and a crooked boxer. This movie is very realistic, and features some of the best acting and direction I've ever seen.The entire concept of this film is awesome. Different stories involving crime are always intriguing, but especially when Quentin Tarantino does the directing. Quentin Tarantino both writes and directs this amazing movie, and it's his most perfect creation. Quentin Tarantino is one of the most talented writers out there. He has the ability to make dialogue as realistic as life. The characters discuss things such as coffee, hamburgers and foot messages. This may seem like too many conversations about nothing, but face it, it's how people really talk.The acting is absolutely awesome. This movie is so full of amazing actors, it was impossible for it to fail. John Travolta and Samuel L. Jackson are great together. Bruce Willis and Ving Rhames are as good as always too. Then there's the cameos such as Steve Buscemi and Christopher Walken, and even they're great.Overall, this is an amazing film with absolutely no flaws. This is destined to become a timeless classic.10/10",10,0,2,27 June 2006
The Da Vinci Code," So, uh...What was all that hype about?
","The Da Vinci Code tells the story that we all must know by now about a Harvard professor who finds himself caught up in trying to solve a murder while discovering clues that lead to the theory that Jesus was married to Mary Magdalene and their descendants still walk the earth today. The book and movie involve intrigue, murders, mystery, and a little bit of action, and overall stirred up quite the controversy with the Catholic church. This movie has been hyped as this summer's biggest hit. The book is supposed to be an amazing best seller. Now, while the story may look intriguing, and the trailers make the film look amazing, I think that people are going to be surprised at how much of a let down this film really is.I'll start off with the acting, since that's what bothered me the most. So many great actors in this movie...Alfred Molina, Paul Bettany, Jean Reno, Ian McKellan and Tom Hanks. These are all actors that I have enjoyed watching in the past. Ian McKellan gives a solid performance and Paul Bettany is chilling as Silas, the murderous monk. Beyond that, no one does a spectacular job. Tom Hanks, who is an amazing actor, and is one of the primary reasons I thought I'd like this movie, gives the worst performance of his career. I'm talking TV movie quality acting. He never changes facial expressions, and he barely reacts to situations. His acting is so wooden, it's like it's Tom Hanks' evil twin brother out to destroy his career. Alfred Molina is quite wooden as well.The trailers for this movie makes it look like a non-stop action film with the music playing and the images we see of people running and gun shots going off and Silas whipping himself. When you see the movie, you'll quickly realize that there's no action at all. The entire two and a half hours of film is talking. The movie actually ends up feeling longer than 2.5 hours because it drags out and some scenes. Toward the end of the movie I couldn't stop yawning.However, this movie gets a 5 out of me because I do enjoy the code breaking aspect. I like movies that have a mystery that needs to be solved. The scene where Ian McKellan's character breaks down Da Vinci's 'Last Supper' painting was very entertaining to me, as well as the end scene when Tom Hanks figures it all out. I liked National Treasure for the same reason, but unlike Da Vinci Code, National Treasure keeps you interested with a cool story, great acting and lots of action. Da Vinci Code almost feels like an ill conceived sequel. I haven't read the book, so I'm going to assume it's better than the film.5/10",5,2,5,19 May 2006
Titanic," An epic film.
","Titanic is the most famous 'fictional story tied into real event' movie to date. It tells the story of a poor man who wins tickets to board the Titanic in a poker game. He and his friend board the ship in hopes of reaching New York City and starting life anew. While on board, he falls for a rich woman who is set to be married. After he saves her life, she begins to fall for him, and a passionate love story begins. However, their plans are halted abruptly when the ship hits an iceberg and begins to sink. Now it's a race against time to try and get off the ship as soon as possible.I don't care what anyone has to say about this movie. Sure, the first hour is chick flick material, and it features the clichéd rich girl/poor boy formula, but this movie is so well made, well acted, and well directed, that it deserves all the praise it gets. The movie has a 3 hour running time, but it's never really slow. Even in the sappy scenes, you're drawn in by the amazing set around the characters. James Cameron did a great job directing this movie. The recreation of the interior of the Titanic is amazing. It's like they're filming inside the real ship. Though the first hour is mainly a love story, it still can keep the guys entertained because it's not a long drawn out drama. Cameron keeps amazing balance between continuing the love story and telling the story of the disaster in the second half of the film. The sinking scenes are fantastic. Finally, the most accurate portrayal of the Titanic's demise on film. This movie has drama, action, and some comedy. It manages to tell a great story and be a highly entertaining action film at the same time.The performances are very good. Not one performance in this movie is flawed. Everybody involved is extremely talented and they all do very well in their parts.Overall, despite what anyone says about this movie, it doesn't change the fact that it's an epic film with a great story and amazing visuals.9/10",9,5,9,15 September 2006
Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone," Destined to become a children's classic the likes of Wizard of Oz.
","Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone is based off the immensely popular book of the same name, about an 11 year old boy who finds out he's actually a wizard, and is sent to a wizard school where evil waits for him at every turn.Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone is extremely enjoyable to watch. Just to see all the special effects put to use with the magic sequences is amazing. This is one of those movies that I'll still be watching and enjoying as an adult, like Willy Wonka and the Chocolate Factory, or The Wizard of Oz.The performances in the movie are really good. The director picked all the right people for the roles. Even the three main kids were really good in their parts.Like any book to film, I was disappointed with how much stuff got left out from the book that I was looking forward to seeing on film, but otherwise, it was a pretty faithful adaptation.A really good movie. 8/10",8,0,1,14 January 2006
Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire," Best of the series.
","Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire is the darkest, most tragic Harry Potter movie yet, and it makes it all the more enjoyable. In this film, Harry finally meets Lord Voldemort face to face. I must say I was very pleased with this entry in the Harry Potter series. It was done just right. When Alfonso Cauron took over for Chris Colombus with the third film, he screwed up the style, but now Mike Newell brings the style back to its roots.As you would expect, a huge amount of the book has been cut out, but Mike Newell did a great job deciding what needed to stay, and what could go. He still makes a great film out of what he has. I was a bit disappointed that the Dursley's were cut out, but it's only a minor flaw.The performances, as always, are great. Brenden Gleeson is great as the new Defence Against the Dark Arts teacher, and Ralph Fiennes' three minute role as Lord Voldemort is well worth the wait. This is the perfect example of what a Harry Potter film should be.8/10",8,0,0,14 January 2006
The Godfather: Part III," What happened?
","After the immense success of the first two Godfather films, it was only right that there should be a third one. This entry takes place in New York during the 1970s. Michael Corleone is older now, and he's struggling to go legitimate and leave the Corleone crime empire to somebody else. Sonny Corleone's son Vincent is struggling to become the Don, but Michael doesn't trust him. As Michael tries to get out, a series of events causes him to be sucked back in. You'd think this entry would be just as good as the last two, but it's not. It's just not the same. You don't get the same feeling watching it.It's a given that Al Pacino is older and Michael Corleone is older as well, but Al just doesn't play him the same. Michael Corleone had a certain style from the way he talked to the way he acted. In this movie, Al Pacino plays him differently, like a character from one of his more recent movies. All of the actors from the first film are gone except for Diane Keaton and Talia Shire, but they're not important enough for the audience to care. Sofia Coppola is in the role of Michael's daughter Mary showing some of the worst acting I've ever seen. The only new actor that deserves praise is Andy Garcia as the cocky Vincent Corleone.This entry in the Godfather series has the obligatory 3 hour running length, but unlike the first two films, you'll be checking your watch to see when it ends. Even less happens in this movie than the first one. It's long and boring, and it doesn't even have the same style as the first two films. Overall, it's good to watch if you've seen the first two, and it's not terrible, but it just doesn't have the classic quality of the first two films.6.5/10",6,2,5,31 May 2006
Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets," Not as good as the first.
","In Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets, 12 year old Harry Potter returns to Hogwarts only to face more danger at the hands of evil wizards. The story is much darker this time around, which makes it a more serious film.This sequel isn't as faithful an adaptation of the book as the first one was, and it's kind of disappointing. Of course, if you haven't read the book, and you just want to see the film, there should be no problem. Other than that, everything is fine.The performances are just as good. Kenneth Branagh plays the new Defence Against the Dark Arts teacher with just the right amount of goofiness and arrogance. All the main players from the first movie are back in their roles, and they all do a terrific job This movie isn't as good as the first one, but it is still a very good film.7/10",7,0,0,14 January 2006
Mr. & Mrs. Smith," A good popcorn flick
","Mr. and Mrs. Smith is the story of a bored married couple who have nothing to talk about, but when they each find out that the other is a deadly assassin, they're on a race to kill each other.First, I'll look at the story and the writing. The writing is pretty good, and at times it's snappy. The comedy in the movie is pretty funny, but this really isn't a full blown comedy like a lot of people were expecting. It's really more of an intense action film. I thought the funniest part was the satirical look at suburban living. Now, while I enjoyed the film, I couldn't help but notice a lot of plot holes, and the somewhat inconclusive ending. Also, it seems to drag on in some parts.The acting in the movie is pretty good. Brad Pitt is as cool as ever in his role, and Angelina Jolie is just as awesome. Vince Vaughn seemed a little out of place even though his scenes are funny.Anyways, don't expect a serious full blown Hollywood action film. This is more of a popcorn flick. 6.5/10.",6,0,4,13 January 2006
The Departed," Martin Scorsese's triumphant return to the gangster film.
","The Departed tells the story of a young mobster that is put through police training and becomes part of the Boston Special Investigations Unit so he can tip off his boss, mobster Frank Costello, when the police are tracking him. Meanwhile, a young cop is put undercover in Frank Costello's gang. Both Costello and the police captain realize they have a mole leaking information, and everybody begins to crack up trying to search for the rat. This amazing good cop/bad cop movie marks Martin Scorsese's triumphant return to the gangster film.The second this movie started it screamed Scorsese. Gimme Shelter by the Rolling Stones is blasting as Nicholson narrates. I knew right away I'd like this movie. The plot and the script are absolutely top notch. Everything about this movie is great. I loved the dialogue. It is witty, funny, and realistic. You usually can't get all three of those in one. The story remains interesting and engaging throughout, and the twists and turns only make it more exciting. The direction style is genius, but of course we're talking about Martin Scorsese here. The only thing that keeps the movie from getting a 10 for me was that toward the end it started to drag a little bit, but not enough to make it boring.The acting in this movie is great. Jack Nicholson is just as good as in any other movie. He's just an amazing actor. Matt Damon and Leonardo DiCaprio were amazing in this movie. Leo is quickly shedding that Hollywood pretty boy image. Alec Baldwin and Mark Whalberg were great when they bickered back and forth at each other.Overall, this is the best movie of 2006 so far. I'm sure Scorsese will be jilted out of another Oscar, because the Academy doesn't recognize real art, but he is the best director of 2006 in my eyes. Utterly fantastic movie.9/10",9,0,2,8 October 2006
Die Hard," The ultimate action film.
","Die Hard tells the story of a New York City detective named John McClane who is separated from his wife. She invites him to a Christmas party at her office building in Los Angeles, and he decides to go to work things out. Once there, a group of German terrorists come in and take hostages with the intent of stealing millions of dollars in bonds. McClane manages to escape and begins to fight the terrorists one by one to save the people in the building.Die Hard is a classic film because it completely revolutionized action films. The 80s were a time of unrealistic action sequences, predictable characters, and rudimentary plots. Die Hard changed all that. Die Hard takes place in a real world setting, or at least about as real as you can get with an action movie, so the action sequences, while insane, are slightly believable. The plot of the movie is simple, yet it's so brilliant at the same time. And the characters in this movie are engaging and a lot of fun to watch. John McClane is a really likable everyman kind of guy, we can all relate to him. Hans Gruber is an awesome villain, both cold and ruthless, yet very human. The supporting characters on the outside of the building are all great as well. Another great thing about Die Hard is that even though it's a hardcore action movie, it manages to be extremely funny at some parts, almost to a point of being able to call it a comedy. This makes the movie really easy to watch over and over again. There's really nothing wrong with this movie whatsoever in any department.The acting is great. Bruce Willis is hilarious and hardcore as John McClane, and he portrays the adrenaline and the frustration of the situation very well. Alan Rickman is awesome in one of his earlier roles as the main villain Hans Gruber. Reginald VelJohnson is enjoyable as McClane's outside contact Officer Al Powell, and Paul Gleason is funny as a hardheaded and incompetent deputy chief of police.Overall, Die Hard is the ultimate action film because it's fast, funny, and hardcore. It also gave us one of the most famous action movie one liners of all time...You know the one.8/10",8,6,7,28 June 2007
War of the Worlds," This is an intense movie.
","War of the Worlds is a chilling take on what would happen if an alien invasion were actually to happen. It focuses on a father trying to safely take his two children away from the danger.The overall mood and the feel of the movie are good. It's really dark and intense, and it captures the feelings and reactions that people might have in a situation like this pretty well. Tom Cruise's performance as a man just trying to save his kids is good. When he first sees the alien tripod, he actually looks terrified. The special effects are really good, and the alien tripods were actually as scary as they should be, especially when they sound off before firing a death ray.There are a few flaws in the film. The worst part was the ending. It had no logic with what happened earlier in the movie, and it left a few plot holes. Also, I think that the movie should have shown what was happening on a world scale, instead of just focusing on one character.All in all, it was a really enjoyable movie, though not one of Spielberg's best. 7/10",7,0,1,13 January 2006
Wedding Crashers," Funniest movie I've seen in a while.
","This is probably the funniest movie I've seen lately, as well as the funniest Frat Pack film.The story is hilarious. Two men crash weddings so they can have sex with members of the wedding party, but at one wedding, one falls in love while the other is desperately trying to get away from a crazy person.The performances are good. Christopher Walken is always enjoyable, and Vince Vaughn is at his funniest. Owen Wilson was funny in his role, and Rachel McAdams proves her acting versatility.At times it turns to bathroom humour, but what comedy doesn't do that nowadays? Probably the funniest film of 2005.8/10.",8,0,0,13 January 2006
Anchorman: The Legend of Ron Burgundy," Will Ferrell's funniest film.
","I'm not really a fan of Will Ferrell. I don't think he's that funny. I've hated almost all of his roles. However, I will say that this movie is pretty good. This is probably the funniest Frat Pack film besides Wedding Crashers.The story of a 1970's anchorman who must always be on top is hilarious. He's constantly at battle with other news teams, and he falls in love with an anchorwoman he wants desperately to keep off the air. Some scenes had me cracking up so hard, I had to rewind them six times to see them again. I'm thinking particularly of a scene with an uncredited Jack Black as an angry motorcyclist.Will Ferrell is really at his best here, and this is the only movie I think he really deserves praise for.7/10",7,1,3,13 January 2006
Jaws," Steven Spielberg's finest.
","Jaws tells the story of New York cop Martin Brody, who has moved to a small summer tourist island to become the chief of police. His job is relatively easy until a large Great White Shark begins using the beach for a buffet on the 4th of July weekend. Brody joins forces with an oceanographer and a crazed sea captain with a vendetta against sharks to kill the creature once and for all. With its great acting, superb direction and intelligent dialogue, Jaws is truly one of the best summer blockbusters ever made.Peter Benchley's chilling novel was an instant best seller, so it was only a matter of time before someone attempted to make it a movie. Thank God it was Steven Spielberg. At the time this film was made, Spielberg was still relatively unknown except for a few TV projects including the cat and mouse thriller Duel. Steven Spielberg brought his genius directing style and mixed it with the words of Benchley's great novel to make the first ever summer blockbuster. What I like most about this film is that it's not really a horror, and it's not really an action. There's actually a story to it. The intelligent dialogue makes the movie interesting to watch because of its blend of humour, fear, and desperation. Of course, there are two other main things that add to the effect of this movie. The first is the chilling score by John Williams. You don't even have to see the movie to know where it's from. The second is the fact that you don't really see the shark until the end. The tension just keeps building.Obviously, a lot of the success has to be credited to the great actors involved in this movie. Roy Scheider is great as Martin Brody who is determined to kill the shark yet has a great fear of the water. Robert Shaw is beyond perfect as Quint, the Ahab-like captain who will stop at nothing to destroy the shark, even if it means his death and the death of those around him. Richard Dreyfuss is always good to me, but especially so here. His constant bickering with Quint makes for some awesome comic relief.Overall, Jaws is one of the most entertaining films out there. It takes itself seriously yet it's still a popcorn flick. I recommend this movie to everyone.9/10",9,2,5,8 June 2006
Star Wars: Episode III - Revenge of the Sith," Best one in the series.
","Star Wars Episode III is probably the best one in the series just because of the way it brings everything together. It's not classic material like the original, but it's really enjoyable to watch everything get connected. This movie ties up all the knots. Anakin's final journey to the dark side to become Darth Vader, Palpatine becoming the Emperor, Luke and Leia's birth, and everything else, no matter how small the detail.Episode III is visually stunning, and Hayden Christensen does a much better job as Anakin, and is very convincing as the evil Darth Vader. The dialogue is as corny as the other Star Wars movies, but that's only a small nitpick. Everything in this movie is done really well, and it's the most fun to watch out of all of them.8/10",8,3,6,12 January 2006
Shooter," Just another generic, clichéd action movie.
","Shooter is the story of an expert military sniper named Bob Lee Swagger who becomes a recluse after his partner is killed in battle. Some government officials track him down and tell him that an assassin is planning to shoot the President from a mile away. They want Swagger to use his expertise to tell them where the assassin might be shooting from. Swagger agrees, but when he is framed with the shooting himself, he sets out on a journey to find out who set him up and why. There's nothing particularly bad about this movie per se, it just doesn't stand out among the countless other films like it.The movie is written rather well and the plot isn't too bad. In fact, this is probably one of the most realistic films about a sniper that's out there. I actually learned in this movie just how much comes into play when you're planning to pick someone off, and it's not as easy as other movies make it seem at all. For instance, even the spin of the Earth itself comes into play when you're firing a sniper rifle. Scenes like that were done well. My main problem was the rest of the movie, though filled with some decent gun fights, fist fights, and explosions, is just so bland. It's the same action movie I've seen dozens of times. A guy gets framed and starts a one man war in order to prove his innocence. I can't think of any other way to describe this movie other than meh, or perhaps blah. It's just one of those movies that's just there. It's not advertised a whole lot, it isn't a failure at the box office but it isn't much of a success either.The acting was okay. Mark Whalberg gave the only good performance. After Saw, and now this, I am quickly losing all confidence in Danny Glover. Everyone else in the movie is just alright. No outstanding performances.Overall, the movie wasn't terrible, but I'm not going to watch it again.5/10",5,10,20,15 April 2007
Halloween," The Greatest of It's Genre.
","Halloween is considered by most to be an insanely popular slasher flick that started the slasher craze. But can we really call this movie a slasher flick? To me, it's more of a psychological thriller. Halloween tells the story of a six year old boy named Michael Myers who, for no explainable reason, killed his 17 year old sister Judith. He is locked up in a mental institution for 15 years, and on the night of October 30th, 1978, he escapes to his home town with his psychiatrist on his trail. Halloween has been given the credit of starting many of the typical slasher movie devices, such as the drunken/promiscuous teens die first while the innocent virgin lives to tell the tale, point of view shots accompanied by heavy breathing, not-so-intelligent victims tripping and falling while trying to escape, etc. Of course, we must give credit where credit is due...Many of these techniques were taken from Bob Clarke's 1974 slasher Black Christmas.The reason that I say Halloween isn't really a slasher flick is because there are only 5 murders in the movie, which isn't particularly high for a slasher movie. Halloween spends most of its time cleverly building the suspense until the climax. Michael Myers mostly appears throughout the film as a shadow in the distance, or we only see a shoulder or his hands. John Carpenter makes use of several interesting camera angles to effectively creep out the viewers. John Carpenter's chilling score is what makes the film. Without the music, the movie wouldn't be as good as it is.What I really enjoy about Halloween is that it has a Halloweeny feel to it. When you watch it, no matter what time of year, you always get this feeling of fall weather and the Halloween season. Halloween is truly a classic in the horror genre, and anyone that favours the horror films of today over this movie don't know art at all.8.5/10",8,0,1,16 May 2006
Shrek," Great movie for kids and adults alike.
","Shrek tells the story of a hideous ogre who lives in a swamp, happy to be alone. When the evil Lord Farquaad evicts all the fairy tale creatures (including Pinocchio and the 3 Little Pigs) from his land, they go to Shrek's swamp. Lord Farquaad tells Shrek that he'll remove the creatures if he can defeat a dragon and rescue a stranded princess. Shrek sets out with a talking Donkey to rescue the princess, but ends up in a series of misadventures. Shrek is a great movie because it appeals to both kids and adults.Shrek attracts children because it has a bevy of fairy tale characters that they will recognize including everybody from the 3 blind mice to the Big Bad Wolf. All of these characters in one film will surely keep your child happy. It appeals to adults because some of the humour is adult oriented, but it is just over your child's head, so you don't have to worry. Also, the movie has a fairly good story, so it's not one of those preachy kids' movies.The voice talent is very talented here. Mike Myers and Eddie Murphy are hilarious together, and John Lithgow doesn't need his face and body to be on screen for his great acting to show through.Overall, this is a great movie that adults and kids can enjoy together.8/10",8,0,1,10 July 2006
The Silence of the Lambs," Chilling psychological thriller.
","The Silence of the Lambs picks up 5 years after the events of Manhunter. A serial killer is kidnapping and murdering women, and wearing their skin as clothing. When the governor's daughter is kidnapped, an FBI trainee named Clarice Starling is sent to talk to the cannibalistic Dr. Hannibal Lecter so he might shed some of his vast knowledge on the case. This leads to a bizarre relationship where Clarice opens up to Hannibal for information. This is a very good psychological thriller that will live on through the years as a timeless classic.The Silence of the Lambs is superior to it's predecessor because it seems to be made on a larger budget, and it uses some big names. It successfully translates the mood from Thomas Harris' novel to film, so the movie comes off as dark and creepy. The characters are awesome. The cat and mouse conversations between Hannibal and Clarice are immensely interesting. She is shy, and Hannibal forces her to be bold. The serial killer in this movie, Buffalo Bill, is based off of real life killer Ed Gein, and he is extremely disturbing in this movie. Another good thing is that this is a no holds barred movie. It doesn't pull any punches. It shows what it wants, and it makes the movie more realistic.The acting is awesome. Anthony Hopkins does a vastly superior job in the role of Hannibal Lecter than Brian Cox did in Manhunter. He made the character his own, and that's why nobody mentions Brian Cox in the role. Hopkins' portrayal is creepy and memorable. Jodie Foster does a knock out job as Clarice Starling, the shy FBI agent forced to interview Hannibal.Overall, this is an amazing movie, and it definitely deserved the Best Picture Oscar. Anybody that loves a good psychological police drama really needs to rent/buy this movie.9/10",9,1,1,11 July 2006
Casino Royale," Amazing reboot to the Bond franchise.
","Casino Royale is the first James Bond movie based on a book since The Living Daylights, and the first really good Bond movie since GoldenEye. After acquiring his 00 status, Bond is sent to a casino in Montenegro where he must beat a man called Le Chiffre in a massive game of Poker. If he wins, Le Chiffre will go down, but if he loses, the money will go toward terrorism. Bond ends up falling in love with the accountant sent to help him, Vesper Lynd, as he must deal with Le Chiffre and his men constantly trying to put him down. This is certainly not the most action packed of the Bond films, meaning it actually has a story, which is always good news.Casino Royale certainly lived up to the hype I felt for it. Everything in this film is good. Unlike the past couple of Bond films, this movie mixes a really good story with some great action scenes. Bond's mission seems pretty simple, he has to win a poker game, but the things that happen before, during, and after the game are awesome. This is a complete reboot of the Bond series, not connected to the past 20 films at all, but the film makers wisely kept Bond traditions alive. They had the song (even though it wasn't the best Bond theme) and the clever opening titles, they had the one liners (though in this movie they were awesome and funny instead of terribly corny), and just when I was getting worried he wouldn't say it, they squeezed 'Bond, James Bond' at the end along with the classic theme. They even thought up a new and refreshing gun barrel sequence. This film goes quality over quantity, and that automatically makes it good in my books. Le Chiffre isn't the most exciting villain Bond has ever faced, but he is cool. Vesper Lynd makes an attractive and appealing Bond girl.The performances are great. When Daniel Craig was cast, most everyone had their doubts. I was a Craig supporter and I had my doubts. When I saw the movie, he blew me out of the water. Looks wise he's nothing like what Ian Fleming intended, but behaviour and attitude wise he was perfect. No one will ever top Sean Connery in my opinion, but Daniel Craig is the best Bond since. Eva Green gives a good performance as Vesper Lynd. Mads Mikkelsen gave a great performance as the villain Le Chiffre. He portrayed the evilness well, and his eyes contained pure enjoyment whenever he saw Bond fail. I also liked Jeffrey Wright as the new Felix Leiter.Overall, this is one of the best Bond films in a while, and I hope Daniel Craig continues to pump out movies as great as this.8.5/10",8,2,4,28 November 2006
X2: X-Men United," Superior to the original.
","The X-Men are back in this sequel with great new characters and a great new story. Following an attack on the president, the X-Men discover that an army general named William Stryker is planning to destroy every mutant in the world by controlling Charles Xavier and forcing him to do so. The X-Men are forced to team up with Magneto and Mystique to fight Stryker. Meanwhile, Wolverine continues to search for clues of his past, and he discovers that Stryker is connected somehow. X2: X-Men United is a great film for action fans and X-Men fans alike. Whereas the first film was mainly to introduce the characters, Bryan Singer was really able to cut loose in this movie and make it more fun.A couple of new characters are added to the mix this time around, including two of my favourites, Pyro and Nightcrawler. Pyro is an amazing character that comes across as an angsty teen who doesn't know where he stands. His main action scene is the most amazing scene in the movie...To me anyways, but I love fire, so...As for Nightcrawler, Alan Cumming does an amazing job in the role, and the opening sequence with Nightcrawler attacking the White House is just awesome. The characters from the last film are given bigger tasks this time around, and it's great to see what they can do now. Wolverine even has one of his trademark 'berserker rages', and tears through the X-Mansion killing his enemies left and right. Once again, Ian McKellan is perfect as Magneto.The plot of this movie is so much better than the first one. It manages to go deeper than before and explore some real issues that relate to the way mutants are treated. For instance, a scene where Bobby Drake/Iceman telling his parents he's a mutant is reminiscent of a homosexual coming out to his parents. His mother even uses phrases such as 'We still love you Bobby', and 'Have you tried...Not being a mutant?' The plot even looks at political views as the president struggles over what to do about the 'mutant problem'.X2 is an all around better film and makes for a really fun time. The best part about it is that you don't necessarily have to have seen the original to enjoy this. It's a stand alone movie as well as a sequel. Bryan Singer did a great job with the X-Franchise, and he gave Brett Ratner a difficult task when he left to do Superman, and Ratner took control of X3.8/10",8,0,0,26 May 2006
The Producers," Mel Brook's first hysterical film.
","The Producers tells the story of Max Bialystock, a Broadway producer who has had some really bad flops lately. A public accountant named Leo Bloom arrives to do Max's books one day, and he discovers that a producer can make more money with a flop then he can with a hit. Upon hearing this, Bialystock teams up with Bloom to find the worst play ever written, the worst director in town, and the worst cast around. When their surefire flop becomes a huge success, they suddenly find themselves in more trouble than they can handle. The Producers is Mel Brooks' first film, and it shot him straight to stardom due to its laugh out loud humour.Mel Brooks hasn't done a whole ton of movies in his time, but the ones he has done have all been hysterically funny. Mel Brooks has a great brain in his head. He knows how to write a good parody, but he also can write great original material. This is an example of his originality. Brooks' satire on the show business profession can bring tears to your eyes in some scenes. The entire plot and the tongue in cheek style of the film makes the movie all around hilarious. The funniest scenes are the ones involving Leo Bloom, played perfectly by Gene Wilder, who is so cowardly and nervous that he's thrown into hysterics when someone even looks angry.The acting is really good. Gene Wilder does an amazingly good job in one of his first film roles. He's so funny in this movie that it makes you want to go out and see his other films, just because you know it will be funny. Zero Mostel is funny as Max Bialystock, even though he falls second to Gene Wilder. The other acting job I really enjoyed was Dick Shawn as Lorenzo St. Dubois, or LSD. He plays the funniest hippie I've ever seen on film.The Producers is one of those classic comedies that makes you laugh every time. Great movie.8/10",8,1,1,11 June 2006
A Nightmare on Elm Street," A creepy horror classic.
","A Nightmare on Elm Street tells the story of a dead serial killer/child molester who was murdered by a lynch mob, and now is killing the mob's children in their dreams. After her friend is killed, Nancy Thompson stands up to the dream demon to stop him once and for all. A Nightmare on Elm Street is a creepy horror classic by one of the greatest horror masters Wes Craven.A Nightmare on Elm Street is not a typical slasher movie. In 1984 when it was released, there had already been four Friday the 13th movies, three Halloween movies, and one Texas Chainsaw Massacre. Violent slasher movies with a silent, masked serial killer was the horror movie formula of the time, but Wes Craven went a different, original route by making the killer a wise cracking burn victim. Even his weapon is something never seen before: A glove with knives attached to each of the fingers. The movie has a mood to it that is very creepy. The dream sequences are dark and foreboding, and make the killer himself look more evil. The way the killer makes cracks at his victims before he kills them gives him more of a personality, which makes him a more interesting killer than Jason.The acting in this movie is quite good. Fans of Johnny Depp will get a kick out of seeing him in his first film role as a sex starved teen. Robert Englund is perfect as the murderous Freddy Krueger. I'm sure he wasn't expecting the character to take over most of his acting career.Overall, this is a classic horror film that should be viewed by all fans of the genre.8/10",8,0,0,21 June 2006
Star Wars: Episode IV - A New Hope," The classic sci-fi film that started it all.
","Star Wars, now known as Star Wars Episode IV, is a great classic. It's still amazing how it's held up after all these years. It tells the story of Luke Skywalker, a poor farm boy who, after meeting old Jedi Master Obi-Wan Kenobi, begins the greatest journey of his life. He goes up against the evil empire and Darth Vader, who has a past with Obi Wan. Not a whole lot happens in this original Star Wars, but it revolutionized sci-fi films as we know them, with battling space ships, laser guns, and hologram communication. The acting and the writing isn't the greatest there's ever been, but it doesn't stop the movie from being completely enjoyable. Star Wars totally deserves the attention it gets and the money it makes from books, video games, TV shows, toys, and it's following sequels.Star Wars will forever remain a classic, even if critics continue to ignore George Lucas's creativity.8/10",8,2,3,12 January 2006
Fantastic Four," Not great, but far from bad.
","Fantastic Four is the story of five scientists who travel into space, and after being blasted by cosmic rays, gain special powers. Reed Richards can stretch any part of his body to any length. Susan Storm can turn invisible and fire force fields. Johnny Storm can generate flame. Ben Grimm has turned into a giant rocky creature with amazing strength. Victor Von Doom can generate electricity. As the four main heroes try to find the cure for their powers, Doom becomes power hungry and turns evil.Fantastic Four is one of those movies that's not meant to be taken seriously. It's for pure popcorn entertainment, and it accomplishes that very well. The movie has a good blend of humour, drama, and action. Some parts are kind of corny, but that can go for any film.The cast is good. Ioan Gruffud, Chris Evans, Jessica Alba, and Michael Chiklis do good in their roles, and Julian Macmahon is awesome as Doom...Until he gets into costume, and he starts to overact a bit.My main problem is the story. The movie captures the tension between the four, and Ben's stress with what he's become very well. However, it focuses way too much on that, and all the action in the movie is reserved for the last 15 minutes. Doom doesn't even appear in all his comic book glory until the end, and it's disappointing. Also, the Fantastic Four fight to save themselves at the end, and not for the lives of innocent people, like most superheroes.The movie makes for a fun watch, but if you're looking for a serious film, this isn't it. 6.5/10",6,0,1,13 January 2006
Monty Python and the Holy Grail," The best Monty Python film.
","Monty Python and the Holy Grail tells the story of King Arthur and his knights of the round table as they head out on a quest to find the Holy Grail. This is based on a real Arthurian legend, but made hilariously absurd by the Monty Python group. This is Monty Python's best film because it is non stop funny, and its twist on the legend of King Arthur makes a great base for a film.The reason I find Monty Python funny is because their humour is so random, and so absurd, that you can't help but laugh at how ridiculous and how stupid some of it is. What I like about this film in particular, is that it can't even make it through the opening credits without goofing off with subtitles at the bottom of the screen. Then, as the movie actually starts, it manages to look like a serious King Arthur film for all of five seconds before we notice that King Arthur is not riding a horse, but he's skipping along as a lackey behind him clacks too coconuts together making the sound of hooves. Then, the verbal humour starts. This movie has some truly hilarious characters that will make you fall to the floor laughing. There's Sir Robin, the Not-Quite-As-Brave-As-Sir-Lancelot, who everyone thinks is the bravest of all the knights when in fact, he's afraid of the smallest of things. Then there's the Knights Who Say NI, a group of knights that scare all who see them by screaming the word NI over and over. Possibly the funniest scene in the movie is where the knights of the round table are attacked by the fiercest monster in all the world...A fluffy white bunny.What makes the movie even better is that it was made on a very small budget, so in some scenes, animation has to take over because they just couldn't afford to do the scene in live action, but they manage to cover this up by making the animation scenes absolutely hilarious. The Monty Python group are true comic geniuses, and this is their best work. I recommend this movie to everyone that likes a good laugh.8.5/10",8,2,4,19 June 2006
Star Wars: Episode V - The Empire Strikes Back," Great sequel to a great movie.
","The Empire Strikes Back is about the continuing battle between the Rebels and the Empire. All the good guys from the first film return to fight the evil Darth Vader, and this time around, a big secret comes out. This movie probably contains the first great twist in a film.All the aspects from the first movie are carried over well, only the plot is more complicated and darker. Luke continues to struggle with becoming a Jedi, and goes to the great Jedi Master Yoda to help. The special effects have gotten better too, and it raises the action a bit.In my humble opinion, this is the weakest movie of the original trilogy, but just barely. The movie is still loads of fun and tells a great story, and continues to revolutionize the movie industry.7/10",7,2,6,12 January 2006
Sin City," The perfect film.
","This movie is really one of the best of 2005. I'm appalled that it's being totally ignored at the Oscars. Never has there been a comic book movie that sticks so close to the source material that you don't have to read the comic after seeing the movie, even though you should, because you'd appreciate the movie more.The acting is great. The only one I really had a problem with was Alexis Bledel, but even she wasn't that bad. This movie looked good right off the bat with such an ensemble cast. Clive Owen was perfect as Dwight, a man trying to keep people safe from a maniac cop. Mickey Rourke literally brought the character of Marv to life in the best performance of his career.Sin City keeps you on your toes with non stop action, plenty of humour, and cool moments that bring a smile to your face. The dialogue in the comics and therefore in the movie is so snappy that it will probably be a popular movie to quote in years to come. Ever since I saw this movie, I've had the urge to narrate my life. It's just so cool.Definitely see this movie, you won't regret it. A truly classic film.",10,2,4,11 January 2006
Coach Carter," Inspirational story about a coach that actually teaches.
","Samuel L. Jackson is amazing as always as Coach Ken Carter, a good coach who takes a job at a down and out school as the basketball coach. He's not afraid to tell the students what he thinks of them, and he believes in discipline. Upon seeing that all of the kids on the team are failing their classes, he tells them they can't play basketball until they've brought up their grades.The acting in the film is really good, and the story is great. This movie is just like every other high school or elementary school sport movie (Remember the Titans, Hardball, Glory Road), with a group of poor kids who get a coach who pushes himself to the limit for his players, but this one has a particularly good message.7/10",7,0,0,11 January 2006
The Bourne Supremacy," A sequel that holds up.
","In The Bourne Supremacy, Jason Bourne is living a secret life with his girlfriend Marie, still trying to discover who he is. When he is framed for a crime involving the CIA, a hit-man is sent to kill him. This causes Jason Bourne to respond to a previous threat he made...Anybody from his past life that confronted him, he'd get revenge. He sets out to find out what happened and why he's being blamed.A lot of the principal players return for this sequel, and it's good to see how their characters evolved since the first film. Some new characters are present as well, and they are good additions to the series. Matt Damon is even better as Bourne this time around, seeing as he's comfortable in the role now. I really enjoyed Joan Allen in her role as well.The movie never gets too boring, and there is a nice blend between the action and the drama. This movie also features one of the best car chases since Bullitt. The only big flaw is the cinematography. The camera whips around so fast in some scenes that you can barely see what's going on. The movie ends with promise of a third installment, and I personally can't wait.8/10",8,68,92,2 March 2006
Jurassic Park," Great sci-fi/action film.
","Jurassic Park tells the story of John Hammond, a man who has discovered that it's possible to clone dinosaur DNA to bring dinosaurs back to life. He plans to open a theme park where dinosaurs are the main attraction. To preview the park before it goes operational, he brings a paleontologist, a paleobotanist, a lawyer, a mathematician, an his two grandchildren to see it. Unfortunately, everything goes wrong, and the dinosaurs end up escaping and causing all kinds of mayhem on the island. Jurassic Park is an exciting film with great special effects even by today's standards.Steven Spielberg is one of my favourite directors because he is able to bring a realistic style to everything he does. Almost every movie he makes handles itself perfectly. His camera angles and his style are a huge part of what makes his movies so good. Michael Crighton's book is also huge. It was an instant best seller. The book is basically all of the scientific aspect, and it seems so believable, I'm surprised cloning dinosaurs hasn't happened yet. Spielberg made a smart decision by cutting out a lot of the scientific jargon and replacing it with action. Michael Crighton's book is great, but as a movie, an audience couldn't stand it. Spielberg handles it just perfect. Of course, Joh Williams' score helps the movie as well. His movie themes are always good.The actors in this movie are all really good. Sam Neill and Laura Dern are great as Alan Grant and Ellie Satler, the two leads. Jeff Goldblum has never been a favourite actor of mine, but I do like him in this. His style of acting provides just the right amount of comic relief.While some people may find the film is a little slow, I think it's a great movie to watch on a rainy day.8/10",8,2,4,9 June 2006
V for Vendetta," A for Awesome
","V For Vendetta is an intelligent film with an interesting view into the future. It tells the story of a terrorist called V, who is attempting to overthrow the fascist British government in the year 2019. He is hunted by police, and joined by a young woman he believes is destined to be with him.Like most comic book movies, V For Vendetta has a few big changes from the graphic novel, but unlike League of Extraordiary Gentlemen and Constantine, two other Alan Moore creations, the changes in this film make it somewhat more exciting.In the film, V is such an engaging character that every moment he is off camera you find yourself wondering when he's going to come back. There is not much action in this film, so anybody going in expecting non-stop action like The Matrix will be sorely disappointed. Most of the film focuses on the rather unconventional relationship between V and Evey. I also liked how the movie is due attention to all aspects of the story. Romance, action, mystery, drama, even a little comedy thrown in. It's all present. One of my favourite aspects of the film is the realistic view of the future in the sense that it is only 13 years into the future, so don't expect anything too futuristic. No flying cars or laser guns here.The performances in this film are really something else. I first saw Hugo Weaving in The Matrix, and I didn't think he was anything special. However, you have to have some amazing talent to be able to give a character dimension and charm, even though we never see his face. Natalie Portman wasn't always thrilling to me either, but she gives a great performance in this film. John Hurt...Well, John Hurt is always good no matter what role he plays.V For Vendetta is a remarkable film that holds some truth in its message, and it is certainly better than most films that are set in the future. It's too bad that Alan Moore didn't want his name to be connected to this. He might have been proud, and he would've made huge money.8/10",8,2,4,23 March 2006
The Godfather," A great film, though not as great as some will say.
","The Godfather is a story surrounding an organized crime family named Corleone in the 1940's. The patriarch, Don Vito Corleone, his loyal son Sonny, his daughter Connie who marries the abusive Carlo Rizzi, and his legitimate son Michael who is not involved in the family business. When Michael returns home from the war and Don Corleone is nearly killed by a rival gang, he slowly finds himself being sucked into the life. Though many people will say The Godfather is the greatest movie of all time, it's not. To tell you the truth, it's not an exciting movie at all. It's not action packed, and not a whole lot happens in its 3 hour running time. However, it is a brilliantly made film with some amazing acting, and portrays the most realistic view of the mafia in film history.Let's start off with the acting. Al Pacino who is now recognized as one of the best actors of all time got his start as Michael Corleone in this film. The movie mainly focuses on his getting sucked into the family business. Al Pacino plays the role brilliantly showing both his tempted side and his reluctant side. All of the supporting actors in this film are awesome. There are really solid performances by James Caan as Sonny who has the coolest scene in the film, and Robert Duvall as Tom. Of course, nothing bad can be said about the late Marlon Brando's performance as Don Vito Corleone. This is Brando's most famous role and for good reason. His genius portrayal will go down in history as one of the greatest acting jobs of all time.The realism of the film is what also makes it good. This is the most realistic view of the mafia you will ever see on film. Most mafia films portray the action side of the story with all the hit men and explosions and gunfights. The Godfather doesn't show a lot of that. It focuses mainly on the business side of things. It shows how serious mobsters really are about their jobs.So, even though The Godfather isn't the greatest film of all time, it's one of the best made.8.5/10",8,1,2,29 May 2006
