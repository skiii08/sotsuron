The Equalizer," In one word - badass
","I liked how the movie led the viewer into the story without giving a full background of Robert McCall's character (played by Denzel Washington). This way there's a little mystery lingering around him the whole movie and the viewer is given some bits and pieces that he or she can put together on their own.
That said, the peaceful start of the movie 'goes south' real fast once McCall pisses off the wrong people so he becomes the target himself. One thing I can say for sure - you don't want to find yourself on Robert McCall's bad side.I found this movie really entertaining as it kept me in suspense the whole time and also guessing what twist might come next. The psychological battle between the protagonist and his nemesis was very well done. So were the fight scenes which were brutal and merciless at times.The ending and the resolution was a bit amusing to me, since Denzel unleashed his inner-MacGyver in order to deal with matters at hand. I might get some strange flashbacks the next time I visit supplies retail store :)",8,0,2,27 July 2018
Suicide Squad," Another example of a terrible DC movie
","So the premise of the movie is - when there are no superheroes left (namely, Superman) to save/protect the world, we should assemble a team of hot-headed bad guys to do the job. Just inject them with an explosive tracking device and we're set - what can go wrong, right?
Oh, and apparently you just need a smartphone app to blow their heads off that you occasionally wave in their face to motivate them.While the cast of the movie includes some prominent well-known names, the ensemble of their characters just doesn't work because of the poor writing.The whole saga can be encapsulated within a few points:
<ul><li>storyline, plot - nonsensical and barely any to speak of;</li><li>characters - borrowed from a stash of stereotypical anti-heroes, also no development of their story-archs (a few flashback scenes at random times doesn't cut it);</li><li>dialogues - almost unbearable and filled with one-liner clich√©s;</li><li>Harley-Joker love (?) saga included just because we needed some weird abusive romance in this mess as well?</li><li>soundtrack - feels more like a mix-tape of songs that play at random times without any regard to what happens on the screen.</li></ul>All that combined amounts to an epic disaster, which to me felt more like a parody of a movie; or rather several movie trailers and teasers stitched together.So until DC gets their act together and work on a coherent storyline in their Universe, this disaster won't be their last.",4,0,0,28 June 2020
Grease," A timeless classic
","It's been 40 years since this movie was released, but it has aged like a fine wine and hasn't lost any of its charm.
Granted, looking from today's perspective, many might feel that its love story is a bit cheesy and naive, but then again - which love story isn't that way?Grease is a light-hearted and fun-loving musical which will leave you with positive emotions after watching it.
The main duo of John Travolta and Olivia Newton-John works great and so does the supporting cast around them. The singing parts along with the choreography are done very well and some of those tunes are so catchy that you might find yourself humming along.",9,3,3,24 July 2018
Bridge of Spies," Historical drama, not an action movie
","The story of the movie takes place during the Cold War era and depicts the tension between the US and the USSR. Both countries are trying to spy on each other in order to gain an advantage over the other side in terms of information.
The story buildup is done very well and both characters depicted by Mark Rylance and Tom Hanks make you appreciate more the human side of the story rather than the political one. Even given the serious tone of the story, I did enjoy the humorous elements that were added in by the characters.Don't expect too much action and suspense as this is not that type of movie, rather focus on the points this movie is trying to present about the ideals that we agree with but often don't follow. In this case Tom Hanks' character is fighting for what's right, not what's politically favorable.The movie has a certain 'je ne sais quoi' to it, that's why I gave it 9 instead of 8 and it's well deserved.",9,0,1,19 July 2018
2001: A Space Odyssey," 2001: A Space ..something..
","This movie by Stanley Kubrick was made about 50 years ago, just a short time before the man actually set his foot on the Moon. Ironically, mankind still hasn't topped its achievement and we are way past year 2001 - talk about wrong priorities and wasted opportunities..That said, I'd agree that this movie was ahead of its time and it was very ambitious in what it was trying to achieve and represent, and to some extent it did succeed. Considering all that, I still feel that this movie is over-hyped - it fails in one key aspect and that is storytelling. Basically it consists of 3 different acts where the only connecting piece is the mysterious monolith, the origin and purpose of which is very vaguely explained in the movie. It's kind of 'make of it what you will' approach, which I personally didn't appreciate. The movie is based on a novel written by Arthur C. Clarke and I'll admit that I haven't read it, however reading the book first shouldn't be a pre-requisite for enjoying the movie. And that to me is one of the main issues. 
We can talk about the symbolism in the movie all we want, but if the viewer is not given any information or explanation about what actual sense he or she should make out of this it just feels like a vacuum. Having some kind of narrator in the slow awkward parts (and I'll get to those later) would help this movie tremendously. Without it, those 3 acts are just stitched together like Frankenstein's monster and are expected to work by leaving an impression on the viewer. They do, but not in the right way.
At the end of it I was left with more questions than answers without getting any proper context or purpose and that is why my watching experience felt frustrating and pointless. I get that the intention was to keep it open for interpretation and debate, but, boy, that's one hell of a stretch.On the positive side, the movie is impressive for the technological advancements it tries to represent (like portable screens, artificial gravity in the spaceship, hibernation pods, etc.) given the limitations of technologies that were available at the time. It uses neat tricks to achieve space illusions, which can definitely be commended. Funny enough, some of those technologies still don't exist in real life today.
That said, it does get plenty of the simple science wrong, like: pouring coffee in a cup on a space shuttle (good luck with that, when there's no gravity), showing Sun as a yellow star (while in fact it's white), pitch black space during the EVA scenes (while there should be plenty of stars seen), etc. The design of space ships/shuttles/pods depicted was highly impractical and funny, but can be overlooked in the grand scheme of things.Another Achilles heel of the movie is the characters - they all have a personality of a wet mop. Didn't care for any of them. Actually the most interesting one was supercomputer named HAL in the final act. He struggles with his personality and purpose, that he's been programmed to do, which made this part of the movie somehow interesting and thought-provoking. One can clearly see, how HAL has influenced AIs and robots in other sci-fi movies, so kudos for that.And last but not least - the pace of the movie. It's so slow that it makes snails look like cheetahs, I'm not kidding. I fully get what Kubrick was trying to achieve with this - to show how vast the space actually is and to highlight specific emotional points in the movie, but it borders on frustration of wasting viewers time. In many of those scenes you can easily go make a coffee or a sandwich and come back, and you wouldn't have missed a thing. Watching a space ship graciously glide through space for two and a half minutes isn't impressive nor breathtaking, when it happens for the forth or fifth time... The movie could've easily been 1 hour shorter and have exactly the same effect.
And to top it off, is the climax scene at the end which looks like a laser show at a trance party and might induce some epileptic seizures as it goes on for way too long. The controversial ending to me was actually less controversial than frustrating for the reasons I explained at the beginning, so I'll leave it at that.In short, after staring at a black screen for two minutes and listening to some highly annoying noise in the background at the beginning of the movie, the viewer is greeted with the epic opening theme of 'Thus Spoke Zarathustra' by Richard Strauss and the movie title. To me that was the most enjoyable part of the movie and it could just be ended there.
My score of the movie mostly represents the appreciation of its influence on the sci-fi genre that followed it. It would be way weaker, if released today.",5,0,2,20 August 2018
Die Hard," The classic of John McClane is having a really bad day
","In my opinion, this is the best movie in the 'Die Hard' series. It has become a classic shown around Christmas time, since the action in the movie takes place around this holiday.When the NY police officer John McClane (played by Bruce Willis) lands in LA to visit his family, he has no idea that his day will turn into a nightmare where he will be outgunned and outmanned while trying to survive and trying to find his way out of this mess.
While the performance of Bruce Willis as John McClane didn't win him any awards, this should be considered as his iconic break-out into fame role. As a protagonist of this movie he's by no means perfect, but still gets the audience on his side while he battles his nemesis Hans Gruber. Hans is brilliantly played by Alan Rickman - he's confident, ruthless and one step ahead of law enforcement in terms of executing his plan. The only thing he didn't account for was... John McClane.The movie provides an entertaining battle between the two, while also throws some punches and makes fun of the police, the FBI and the media about how clich√É¬© and ignorant they can be in crisis situations.If you like action movies, this definitely is a must-see or as John McClane would say, 'Welcome to the party, pal.'",9,1,1,18 August 2018
Shooter," An entertaining action movie
","A former sniper (played by Mark Wahlberg) gets recruited by a secret government agency to investigate threats of a possible assassination attempt of the USA president. However he gets crossed and becomes the main assassination suspect himself, luckily he manages to escape and sets on a path to exact justice on those who are actually responsible.In my opinion, this one of the best movies starring Mark Wahlberg as a lead. The movie has a good story with some unexpected twists, so it keeps you entertained and guessing about what to expect next.
For action fans there are plenty of chase and shootout scenes throughout the movie, and, of course, Hollywood likes those explosions whether or not there's an actual need for them :)Definitely worth your time.",8,0,0,21 July 2018
