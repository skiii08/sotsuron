Resident Evil: Afterlife," Alice Is Still Alice. Enough Said.
","If you have not played the games and seen the previous films, go see something else.This is an episode in a series. A very stylish, visually appealing episode in a series. A series where favorite characters never die, they just get cloned again and again. A episode which takes off from last episode's cliff hanger and leaves off with a cliff hanger that will be continued in the next episode. An episode in which only one thing of great import happens, but it was something we knew would happen, something we wanted to happen. And no, I'm not going to say what it is, because if you are reading this, then you have seen all the previous episodes and you already know what the One Thing is.The only times this film----sorry, this episode dragged was when Alice was not on the screen.For those who compare it to a cut scene in a video game, cut scenes are awesome. When they work, they get you psyched up for game play by establishing a character and a conflict and then you get to take over. Cut scenes are a 'readerly text' in the (translated) words of Roland Barthes.",7,2,3,30 September 2012
Monster," If You Work with the Disadvantaged, This Should be Required Viewing
","Just watched the film 'Monster' for the first time. I have been putting this one off for a decade, because it never seemed like the 'right' time to watch a downer movie. But you know what? I realized that if I wait until it is the 'right' time to discover how bad some people have it, I will never know. Oh, I feel for my patients---homeless, unemployed, uninsured because they have a disability. But today I FELT for them. And I realized something. Nature is not fair. Some of us---for whatever reason, birth order, genes, nurture---respond to unimaginable, intolerable, childhood trauma by rallying and overcoming and succeeding not in spite of but because of the negative forces that shaped us. While others of us were intended to live in normal homes, with normal nurturing parents and normal food and normal everything, never rocking the boat, never asking for more----and when these folks get f****d over as children, there is no way that they are gonna survive intact. It is probably a good defensive strategy for the species as a whole. Have some people who thrive in times of tragedy and who are bored out of their minds the rest of the time. And have everyone else just want to fit in. But it sucks for the individuals born into the wrong place and circumstances. Charlize Theron is absolutely f*****g brilliant. So is the film. Watch it and be prepared to cry.",10,0,0,2 February 2014
Hugo," I Feel Like I Watched the Emperor's New Film....
","Four Academy Awards? Or was that five? And a nomination for Best Director? Did I watch the same film the critics watched? The 'Hugo' which I saw had 1) bad acting 2) inappropriate music 3) plot holes big enough to drive a semi through.Yes, the cinematography was lovely. The editing was competent. The lighting/color/ costumes created a steam punk paradise. However, the lead actor was so bad that I found myself cheering on the train. Most of the male actors (with the exception of Christopher Lee and Jude Law) appeared to have been coached by someone with Asperger's. What on earth was Ray Winstone doing in this movie? For that matter, what kind of drug did they feed Ben Kingsley? Here is a suggestion for those who are thinking about watching 'Hugo.' Watch 'Sexy Beast' instead.About halfway through the movie I considered turning down the volume and watching it as a silent film. That is how bad the Howard Shore score was. No, the music itself was not bad. It was the way the music was used to create dramatic tension thick enough to choke a bull moose--when the action on the screen called for something light, whimsical, comedic. Note to the director. If you are going to use solemn, ominous, LOUD music, you need to be prepared to deliver a punch line that is solemn and ominous.And then there is the Joseph Campbell problem. As in if the screenwriters had read their Joseph Campbell, they would have done a better job of creating an epic fantasy, which is what I think this wanted to be (based upon the Howard Shore score). Basically, this story is the Fisher King---except Kingsley's motivation is all wrong. (Here comes the spoiler). The Fisher King becomes ill, because his kingdom is ill. Kingsley throws away his art and career and every shred of humanity he possesses---because the critics no longer like his work???? Where was the extended footage of the horrors of WWI---mustard gas and trench warfare? Where was the son killed in battle? THAT is Fisher King material. I guess Scorsese did not want to scare the kids. Except, if he did not want to scare them, why the scary soundtrack? Make up your mind, please.By film's end, I found myself indulging in a fantasy of my own. What would the movie have been like if someone who actually knows how to do dark children's fantasy, like Tim Burton had directed it? Three stars for being absolutely lovely to watch. Now I am going to go watch 'Sexy Beast' so I can remind myself what good acting is.",3,2,6,18 December 2012
Mulholland Drive," Would Give It a Better Review if I Had not Already Seen'Celine and Julie Go Boating'
","Technically exquisite movie, like everything that Lynch does. However, about half way through, I started thinking about the 1970s French film 'Celine and Julie Vont En Bateau' aka 'Celine and Julie Go Boating.' Now, when you redo a creative masterpiece, you are expected to one up the creative masterpiece---by adding some twist that the original did not contain, for instance. Pointing up a flaw in the original and fixing it. Maybe playing on the viewers expectations.This one did not quite do that. A really good film makes you want to go back and watch it again right away. This film makes me want to watch 'Celine and Julie' again. To see why I remember it (Celine and Julie) as being brilliant and this one as being just pretty good and fairly clever and a pleasant way to pass the evening but nothing new.Probably would have made a very good TV series. I enjoyed the first half much more than the 'let's explain it all now and show how clever the writer/director was' ending. Which means that Lynch is better at dishing out bizarre slice of life than he is as explaining life the universe and everything.",7,0,0,16 October 2013
