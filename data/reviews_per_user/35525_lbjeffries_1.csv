Requiem for a Dream," Powerful!
","After seeing Aronofsky's Pi, I thought we had a new and talented director before us. Nothing however could have prepared me for Requiem for a Dream. This movie is so powerful, so overwhelming that I couldn't quite believe what I'd just seen. It's a story that doesn't hesitate to go all the way, Aronofsky clearly doesn't want to compromise - neither should he. Moreover, Aronofsky's cinematography is, in my opinion, very suited to the story and message he was trying to visualize. Likewise, all the actors did a magnificent job... (makes you wonder why Julia Roberts got that Academy award and not Ellen Burstyn!) This movie has baffled me, and still baffles me everytime I see it again now that it's out on DVD. Aronofsky is the best thing that happened to cinema since Paul Thomas Anderson!",9,0,0,20 August 2001
