The Avengers," Action packed & Unlimited Fun
","Avengers had one of the longest marketing technique used in the movie industry.Its marketing started way back in 2008 with the release of Iron-Man.After 4 years and 5 movies later, that movie is finally released.The Avengers fulfills all the expectations that were raised in this 4 year duration.All the main actors have returned (except Edward Norton ,replaced by Mark Ruffalo for The Hulk) ,and the story is fun ,witty and action packed.The biggest drawbacks most star-studded movies encounter is giving the comparatively more famous actor the biggest chunk of role.Thankfully this was not the deal for Avengers.All the main heroes (IronMan,Captain America ,Thor & Hulk) got equally big as well as important part in the story.The secondary actors (Nick Fury & Black Widow) were not brushed off ,and even with all the superheroes getting the good parts ,these 2 still had major roles.The only character felt unused and a bit expendable was Hawkeye. This speaks volumes of how the story has been handled.Juggling 6-7 heroes and giving each ample screen time is no easy task.In the acting department ,Robert Downey stole the show as he usually does.He was born to play IronMan.In every scene he appears he is in total style and gives IronMan his soul. Both Chris Evans(Captain America) & Chris Hemsworth (Thor) were not bad.Both did equal justice to their roles.Tom Hiddleston (Loki) delivered yet another excellent villainous role ,similar to the one he did in Thor.Scarlett Johansson (Black Widow) had a surprisingly longer and major role and she too gives her best.Jeremy Renner (HawkEye) was too rigid ,this may be due to his role not being fully fledged.Samuel J(Nick Fury) was good. But the true show stealer was Mark Ruffalo as the Hulk.The Hulk will indeed be EVERYONE's favourite character once they have seen Avengers.Every scene & action scene by Hulk is just Pure Awesomeness.Story as i previously said is truly noteworthy because of the huge juggling acting of giving each Hero their own connection with the movie.But in terms of story telling ,it falters just a bit.The story makes way for the action and takes the backseat.While the first half concentrates on the story ,the second is completely action based.Action scenes are superb.The numerous fight scenes,hero vs hero,hero vs hoardes ,heroes vs the villain ,ALL are properly choreographed and exciting.Direction was great.The way Joss Whedon managed to direct this movie with these many superheroes and mixing them and giving one solid movie is truly remarkable.On the downside the first half was riddled with pacing issues.Some dragging scenes in the first half drained the excitement after some great fights.But once the Hulk appears ,the movie just blasts off to high levels of awesomeness never to go down again.The real Avengers movie starts with The Hulk and ends with him too. The dialogues were witty and funny ,and Robert Downey's style of delivery & Hulk's grunts of words steal many scenes away.Overall Avengers is a colourful,funny,action packed movie that delivers its promise of a United Super Heroes movie.The movie might not be legendary ,but The Hulk & Robert Downey will not be forgotten. A must watch movie.Acting-4.5/5 Story-4/5 Direction-4.5/5 Action-5/5 Comedy-4.5/5",7,2,6,12 May 2012
Sucker Punch," A sucker punch to your common sense....
","This is Zack's 2nd rotten movie ,the first being the one about the owls..As a big fan of the director i was excited to see the movie and decided to wait for the extended cut..but i was disappointed with the whole movie.... Zack instead of making a straight-forward movie about a girl trying to escape a mental institute,he decided to take a twisted approach to the whole plot and made it more action oriented mixed with many unwanted twists.... The plot started to become more and more mundane just after the scene where baby-doll is enrolled in the institute.. I loved Zack's style,especially his trademark slow-mo and closeups but the multiple and repetitive action scenes drained the interest in those effects from me.... In my opinion,the movie would have been wonderful if Zack ignored all the alternative worlds and just made a movie on baby-doll and friends trying to escape the institute normally(shawshank/prison break style).. Acting was average on the whole,i liked Jena Malone.Carla seemed to go over the top with her accent....the character 'blue' was well acted.... Action scenes were all good but their repetitive use spoiled the impact....i read somewhere that Zack didn want the action scenes to look like a video game but i guess he failed,since they looked nothing other than video games....Before cing sucker-punch i was excited 4 Zack's superman ,but after the whole mess of this movie,I'm having second thoughts....",2,4,11,26 June 2011
Resident Evil: Afterlife," Worst Resident Evil Movie !!
","i didn't have much expectation from Afterlife,but being a Big fan of the first movie,made me watch the rest of the series...but each movie gets more worse than its predecessor ...just within minutes into the introduction of Alice,the movie started to go bad.. the fights were just too lame,and over that,crappy CGI...the first scene that takes place in Tokyo seemed to be taking place only for one reason,..to kill all the Alice clones..tats it..the end of the 3rd part (extinction) promised us that Alice will fight back with her army of clones..in the 4th part ,all clones are dead after fighting a couple of guards.. unfortunately that was just the starting....Alice loses all her powers,but stays alive even after a big airplane accident.. after 6 months,shes flying to Alaska..Alice looks like a model through out this movie...she has on heavy makeup,i don't mind it cause Milla is damn hot...but in a zombie movie who wears makeup all the time...i know its a small issue,but thousands of similar issues lag this movie down....even Ali Larter,is almost unrecognizable at first..but after she meets Milla,Ali looks hot too..as the movie progresses, more characters appear..the introduction of Wenthworth miller too is horribly done.. the jail ,where all the characters are currently living in is nicely lit up too...fire torches EVERYWHERE...i suppose there's no fuel shortage..conveniently Arcadia (the sole hope of civilization away from zombies) is nearby..there's a whole lot of time given to a plan made by wentworth on how to make a 'Prison Break'...but that is completely useless ..and another plan is immediately made..by the time Alice reaches the ship(don't know how she gets things done so conveniently) all the characters are dead,except the famous ones (Ali larter and wenthworth)...more bullcrap awaits at the ship..more dumb gunfights...a character is ripped off from the matrix...and it goes on and on..finally the end..and whats that?just after rescuing the people trapped in the ship and killing off the sole villain of this movie,more planes with more guards come by ,'Promising Us' yet again some big fights coming up in the next movie..There are very few genuine scary moments...acting and dialogues are over the top...CGI is very very bad for a big budget movie..For a movie based on Resident Evil the game,this has Nothing to do with it...i know the previous ones had no relation to the game as well but this one is just plain laziness... A reboot of this mess is needed..Hopefully not with Alice and her superpowers,just the simple characters from the game...",1,0,4,5 August 2011

Man of Steel," action packed to the brim
","Man Of Steel (2013) Rating- 85/100The origin story of the greatest superhero of all time ,Superman.Starring- Henry Cavill,Michael Shannon,Amy Adams,Russell Crowe Director- Zack SnyderHenry Cavill as Clark Kent/Kal-El/Superman is great.He puts in a lot of effort behind the role and he is successful most of the time.You could sense the pain and loneliness behind his character ,which is essential to the tale.Amy Adams as Lois is good.She proves to be a much better representation of Lois than her earlier predecessors.Micheal Shannon as Zod is great.As a villain he is excellent and truly the best villain to face off against Superman. On a surprising note ,Russel Crowe as Jor-El, has a good amount of scenes and hes amazing in them!Diane Lane and Kevin Costner do good as the foster parents.There's a tight bond between Superman and both his parents (his dad and both foster parents) and the actors do an excellent job bringing it out.The stumbling block for MOS is its story.Don't get me wrong ,its good ,but there's some heavy structural problems and thats mostly the directors fault.Other than that ,the story is engaging.The excellent depiction of Krypton and explaining Superman's powers on Earth were all done neatly.Goyer has brought in the realistic natures that were seen in The Dark Knight Trilogy and lends MOS the same ,a hard task considering the highly out of the world powers of Superman. The relations between Superman and his parents were excellently highlighted.But his romance with Lois was not good enough.Some scenes do go a bit over the top (ex:The tornado flashback) ,and its hard to understand the choices the characters make.Zod's character was well developed and this helps in making him a great villain.The visual effects were amazing.The Krypton sequences and especially the climax was wonderful!Music from Hans Zimmer was as usual amazing.It really gives the movie an intense atmosphere.Direction by Zack Snyder was good.He keeps the movie packed with emotion and drama and amazing action scenes.The pace of the movie is a bit uneven at the start as it shifts back and forth from action to drama in the course of minutes ,but the latter half is fast paced and action packed.One of the issues i had with MOS was, Zack trying to 'Nolanise' the movie.The first half is riddled with jumping from the past and the present almost continuously.Juggling with timelines is best left to Nolan.Some scenes end all of a sudden and others just jump ahead without proper clarity.Editing is weak especially in the middle ,and this could irritate some viewers.But Zack does master one aspect of the movie and thats the ACTION.I really have to talk about the action of this movie. It was just mindblowing!!! The entire third half of the movie is one gigantic EPIC battle.I have to say that its the best superhero fight sequences I've EVER seen.Mixed with the soundtrack and the visuals ,the action is just jaw dropping.The scale of destruction was immense.It was really great to see Superman actually fighting someone that matched his powers.The finale left me speechless There are plenty of powerful scenes showcasing Superman's powers and all of them are spot on.Zack has made no mistake handling the action sequences ,and thats what keeps this movie afloat.Overall ,Man Of Steel will go down as an excellent reboot of Superman made memorable with those jaw dropping action sequences.Its not perfect but its a blast!Its a must watch if you love action!Acting- 4/5 Story- 3.5/5 Direction- 3.5/5 Action- 5/5 Drama- 4.5/5 Thriller- 5/5 Visual Effects- 5/5https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=673752085985052",10,33,61,14 June 2013
The Intouchables," A Beautiful Movie..Masterpiece..
","Intouchables is a true story of Philippe ,a rich aristocrat who is paralyzed from neck down and Driss ,an unemployed man coming from a poverty stricken family..Francois & Omar as the lead cast give a superb performance .. The charismatic Omar (Driss) is just amazing..His very presence on screen is powerful as he juggles between rib-tickling comedy and some serious drama...Francois (Philippe) is on par with Omar...He gives a very controlled performance and is able to hold strong against Omar's contrasting character.Considering,Francois had to act as a quadriplegic, he has done an amazing job..His expressions itself substitute any needs of dialogues.. The bond the two develop is pure gem.Story is smooth and never drags..It could have been an intense drama movie,but the directors usage of comedy made it stand out from other similar stories..Direction is sharp & the movie doesn't rely on any over the top scenes..The music is beautifully blended into the movie and it enhances the effectiveness of many scenes...The Intouchables can be described by one word..Beautiful...The movie is a must watch for all..Acting- 5/5 Story- 5/5 Direction- 5/5 Comedy- 5/5 Drama- 5/5",10,37,50,27 March 2012
Insidious," A Horror movie with a difference
","Watching this horror movie was very enjoyable..unlike most movies of this genre that have innumerable clichés ,insidious managed to stay away from most of them.. Acting from Patrick William and rose were on the spot.. Direction was also great. This movie is indeed a must watch for any horror fans.. The scare tactics used in this movie is also excellent and is well placed.Another plus point for insidious is its soundtrack and its usage in the movie.... The movie doesn't have dull moments and once the plot sets in ,you are certainly in for a ride.I feel that insidious is one step ahead of paranormal activity and fans of PA wont be disappointed with Insidious.. The best horror movie of 2011 so far....",10,0,2,26 June 2011
