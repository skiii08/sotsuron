Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," Not much of a movie, but a great time nonetheless.
","The Phantom Menace is a BAD movie.  The plot is underdeveloped, the direction is callous, the dialogue is campy, the acting is uninspired, and the movie as a whole is severely over-edited.  It has the scope of a three-hour epic, but has been condensed to fit a standard two-hour time slot.  In the process, it has lost valuable screen time necessary for developing key characters and building tension.Did I hate this film?  No, I loved it!  It is a sensational audio visual experience that resembles less a movie and more an art exhibit/concert.  I enjoyed it enough to gladly pay to experience it again, and again.But I really would prefer Episode II to be a movie movie.",Null,0,1,23 May 1999
