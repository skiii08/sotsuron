The Incredible Hulk," Incredibly Awful
","The movie starts to basically fall apart after the initial 15-35 minutes and never quite recovers. The concept, and the initial storyline were rather promising, but they are never quite built upon, and the focus is, instead, on mind-numbingly dull, repetitive special effects that are neither aesthetically pleasing nor that revolutionary in terms of technical wizardry. The whole movie is basically about the hulk- running away from a military that acts as if it owns the planet, roaring loudly, and smashing things. Its yet another generic mindless action movie targeted at 12-15 yr olds; and indeed, if I was a twelve year-old I'd be in love with this movie..trouble is I ain't twelve years-old, and neither were my fellow cine-goers, who were laughing throughout the overdone action sequences and positively jeering by the end. the only redeeming quality about this movie is Edward Norton's performance, William Hurt is moderately tolerable, and everyone else, especially Liv Tyler, are wasted. besides, its 30 minutes too long. Conclusion: watchable, but barely so.",5,5,8,23 June 2008
The Hangover," Delivers the goods, though it could've been better.
","If you're looking for a movie to blow off some time and steam with, then you should give this is a watch; if you are looking for an innovative, witty film with pertinent social commentary, or satirical elements, this is probably not the movie for you. I watched it expecting a few laughs, some clichéd storyline, and a bit of fun, and that's exactly what I got, though it did feel a bit incomplete, and that's probably the room that they've left for the sequel. This is a fun film if you're that sort of person, but not as good as it could've been; if only they'd paid as much attention to story as they did to the gags.",6,2,5,15 August 2009
Batman Begins," wish WB would do the same with other franchises...
",nothing left to be said about the movie. it was pretty damn good!!!! Just hope Warner Bros will stop screwing the other great franchise:Harry Potter. they've made nothing but a parody/mockery/caricature of the books.Lord Of The Rings is really not that great a book but a great movie. Harry Potter deserves to be made like that; seriously and true to the books.and not like the insane action/comedy its made to be.Here is to Hoping Warner Bros don't screw up the all-important 6th and 7th movies.Because i bet they've already screwed the 5th one!!!!,7,1,1,22 June 2007
Fantastic 4: Rise of the Silver Surfer," See With Your Kids.......That Way at least someone will enjoy it....
","don't see it. mindless big-budget crap. but then again that goes for most of the movies released every summer. as technology gets smarter; are humans getting more dumber???? well, it would definitely seem so if you would check the returns the studios get for these kind of childish movies. just add one kg of CGI, 500 grams of insane stunts, a dash of good-looking people and a hint of acting. perfect recipe for a money-making machine of a movie . Don't blame the studios.Capitalism 101:Demand=supply. The studios wouldn't be making such mindless nonsense if their wasn't a demand for it.Indeed, humankind is getting a lot dumber.And Hollywood Is The happier for it.",4,7,15,22 June 2007
Avatar," An enthralling spectacle
","An engaging, enthralling, well-written, inspiring, and thoroughly entertaining feature-film that is as intent on telling a story as it is on wowing you with spectacular images and special effects. A particularly endearing aspect of this movie is its thematic focus(environmentalism, mercenary corporations, and the downside of avarice) and its tasteful application of science-fiction clichés while inventing a few of its own. Its groundbreaking implementation of photo-realistic CGI and good-ole surround sound result in a truly immersive experience and just like the protagonist one's awareness of his surroundings is amplified and one's perception of the real is shaken. The only let-down is the score which while adequate, isn't as memorable as the rest of the film. And best of all is how these elements coalesce to make a sci-fi film that stays true to its genre by enthralling and raising pertinent questions, while also providing an engaging and cathartic story.",9,4,9,21 December 2009
Transformers: Revenge of the Fallen," Wasted potential
","With a furious and almost intransigent focus on special effects over story, the 'physical' over the emotional, and the appalling(and unnecessary) attempts at being 'contemporary' and 'humorous', not to mention the relentless pushing of a romantic angle where there wasn't one to be had, make this film a waste of time, money, and a potentially good experience. The director betrays complete disinterest in the(poorly written) human characters and in telling a story and yet expects us to not only relate to them, but to also care about the 'plot' and watch this drivel till the 'epic' finale. In addition, the pathetic soundtrack and the consistently weak acting don't help either. To top it off, rather predictably(and horrifyingly), room is left for yet another sequel! Avoidable.",5,1,6,29 December 2009
