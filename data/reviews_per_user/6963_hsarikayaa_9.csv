Ford v Ferrari," Had a great time
","When you accept that this is a mainstream movie you enjoy the (real) story and racing scenes. We can complain about how we get to see main character's life so little even his devastation at some point. However, they did really great job on racing scenes. Only thing that i can complain about is that the ending could be more painful to win(maybe some suspense). It was kinda all about victories throughout the whole movie and nothing really bad happened. But yea anyway it was fun to see.",7,1,1,5 December 2019
Toy Story 4," Made me look for the previous movies
","It wasn't lower than 6 stars nor higher than 7. With all respect it was enjoyable but nothing close to previous movies. We can look deeper in terms of unsuccessfull character builds and the simpelest story but no need for that. In short, don't expect a great Toy Story movie. As i said, with all respect, whatever marketing reason it was that made you make such a movie, you gave us a great childhood movie back in times and i appraciate for that. I hope the next ones will not be like this one.",5,1,3,22 June 2019
Once Upon a Time... in Hollywood," Thats a Tarantino movie
","The reason for the title is for those who say ''hey thats so different than other tarantino movies, it was boring blablabalb''. Stop it. It is nothing but a tarantino movie. Wilhelm scream in the very beggining, lots of foot and indispensable weird action scene. These are the most remarkable ones. I think people dont understand the idea of the film. It is not really about the characters or what happenes to them. It is about the holywood itself at that time as you can understand from the title of the movie. He is such an enthusiastic film lover which bring him where he is now. Back in time when he was working at the movie store he saw every movie in that store. Western and asian movies were his favorites. Thats why his movies are like bloody, action, sword and exaggrated fight ect. He finds it FUN. I am writing these because he has all the guts to make a movie like that and make profit out of it.(I think profit is not the priority for him at that point)I appraciated for what he done to this industry and show that if you truly passionate about your interest you can do it.The movie was not the most enjoyable or his best but it is worth to watch because his name is on it. Thanks.",8,5,7,4 September 2019
The Illusionist," Everything is good about the movie i guess
",The story was so good but more respect to cinematography in the movie. DAMN well made! Edward Norton was again awesome of course.,10,0,0,17 January 2019
Sing Street," Awesome
","Untill the end of it, i tought if there was a little bit more about the boy and the girl that'd be much better or the same thing with the band or the bully boy. But at the very end of the movie everything i thought was washed away and i was amazed. The movie is actually about two brothers like it shows at the end. Worth to see.",8,0,0,8 December 2019

Joker," Great job but there is a crucial missing
","First of all, I saw it for the second time yesterday just to be sure about my thoughts and yes I was much more brutal about something in the movie but I feel a bit different now.Excellent cinematography, great sceneography and splendid acting by Joaquin Phoenix YET I found some element missing. Let me first make it clear. I don't really know about DC world and the stories and for this case Batman. I chose to see this movie as a completely different world than Joker from DC. So here we have a man who is having psychological problems and goes crazy after what happened to him lately. Don't get me wrong. Movie is great overall but there is this problem I'll write about and it makes the movie ''not enough'' I'd say. Some people complain about how different this joker than the other joker(like its not like a comic thing) and it seems like similar compositions with ''Taxi Driver'' or ''King Of Comedy'' make some people ''oh its so same so its bad...''.  However, these or other things that most people are talking about are not my point breakers at all.So what are the problems?The problem is lack of incidents for Joker to become Joker and plot it self. For those who don't know much about technical side of the screenwriting, your protagonist should be likeable or at least able to make the audience feel empathy for him/her. Even we feel connected to bad characters sometimes. Please note that, I am not supporting the idea of everything should be done by some strict rules in cinema like I gave the example of character building but apparently it is not so successfully done in this movie. I am getting the point. Obviously joker went through something even before the movie starts and we get to see him suffer after the movie starts. He gets beaten a couple of times, tries to be a comedian and fails and discovers that he is adopted and his favorite tv show man makes fun of him for his sickness ect. In that sense, the question here is: Did we feel for joker? The answer is maybe yes but believe me it was not enough. At least not enough to become a symbol for the city and start a riot. I mean camo'n... He kills three rich men, and police suspects someone dressed like a clown. So this triggers poor people to rebel with clown masks? I know there is an unemployment problem and they are going through an election, people are ready to explode already but it just still does not persuade me. The very first thing triggers his becoming Joker process happens in the beginning in the train. Especially the last scene where they save joker from the police car. Joker did't feel powerful enough to make lots of people save him and put him in a leader chair. No, he did not! I just pity him for what happened to him and thats all. There must be something bigger than that.The movie doesn't give enough reason in terms of making audience feel enough for the protagonist to change so that we actually can believe he may lead something but this did not happen. Also, 8 stars is for what i said in the beginning. Everything other than that done so well that nearly makes me forget the fact that i mentioned about. I just wish the plot was a little more intense for joker.All in all, still, it was enjoyable to watch thanks to great visual storytelling. Great job by Todd Phillips and his cinematographer Lawrence Sher. They did comedy before and i really was amazed how they pulled that drama off. I liked some details like the part where the rich people watch Modern Times and enjoy it which is really critically done. You see, film is overall great but plot could've done better for joker's change in my opinion. Also what the hell is wrong with people saying ''It was the best movie ever''. This movie is a true piece of art but for god's sake don't make it overrated.So good with some crucial missings",7,1,1,10 October 2019
American Gangster," Looooooong
",So much longer than it is suppose to be i think but you get to like it at the end. Denzel and Russel carried the film i think.,7,1,4,10 March 2019
Green Book," Great overall unless some claim
","I don't understand why people are complaining about predictability. When you see a movie which is based on a true story, you have to make yourself ready for that then see it. You need to focus on the 'Film' here.",9,1,3,11 March 2019
