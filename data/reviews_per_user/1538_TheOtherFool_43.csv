Kill Bill: Vol. 2," Why oh why
","As I feel it, Tarantino got away with Volume 1 of his revenge saga, as there were some elements in it most people (like me) not so much adore or find absolutely fantastic, but at least it was a movie you can like, laugh at and even admire (in particular the effects). Too bad you can do none of the above with Volume 2, as this conclusion must be one of the biggest let-downs in cinema-history.'The Bride' (Uma Thurman), as we learnt from Vol. 1, is on a killing spree after 'Bill' and his assasins killed her soon-to-be husband, family and friends on her wedding (or, as we know now, her wedding rehearsel, but never mind that). In part one she killed of Copperhead (Vivica A. Fox) and Cottontooth (Lucy Liu), now the time has come for Elle (Daryll Hannah) and Budd (Michael Madsen). And the inevitable Bill, of course.She starts of with Budd, who apparently traded his 'killer-life' for a trailer in the desert, working as a bouncer/toilet cleaner in a local bar. But Budd knows The Bride is coming for revenge, so when The Bride is planning to surprise him, he's way ahead of her, shoots her down and buries her 6 feet under. But this movie wouldn't be called 'Kill Bill' if, well, Bill wasn't killed, so the Bride gets out (in the best scene of the movie), remembering a trick she learnt from Pai Mei. So we have a flashback to Pai Mei, training The Bride for her life as a killer. Think The Karate Kid. This scene has so little to do with the movie and is so silly, it's right here where the movie takes a downfall.Back to the story then. The Bride gets out of her grave and kills Budd and Elle (who happened to be in Budds trailer as well), and goes out to find Bill. But not before she has an encounter with Esteban Vihaio, some pimp who knows Bill. So we hear the whole story with Esteban etc. etc. etc. Throwing in some interesting characters who have nothing to do with your movie doesn't mean the movie is getting more interesting, you know...When The Bride finally meets Bill there's a surprise for her: her kid (of which Bill is the father) wasn't killed at the massacre but has now turned into a 4 year old girl. The 'end fight' of The Bride and Bill should've been the highlight of this saga, but turns out to be so dull it's beyond belief.As this whole 'Volume' is boring, useless, and in the end really unsatisfying.4/10 for the OK first hour I guess.",4,4,8,4 June 2004
Scarface," What would Hollywood be without it's gangsters?
","Al Pacino is Tony Montana, a poor immigrant from Cuba who wants to make it big in the USA. And he does, as he becomes one of the most important drug lords of his days. But after every rise comes a fall...Your typical smack-in-the-face, epical crime/gangster movie with elements as honour and family played to the extend. Pacino is excellent (as is about everybody else from the cast), but Scarface can't really compete with The Godfather (I + II), Goodfellas or The Untouchables (a slightly different film, but it's my alltime favorite, so I love to bring it up :)).The element the movie suffers the most from is the love-story between Montana and Elvira (Michelle Pfeiffer), a drug-addicted powerlusted 'babe' (hardly IMO, oh well...) who's with Tony's boss until Tony kills him, takes over his business and apparently his woman. Why he would do that is a mystery to me, as Elvira doesn't bring much joy to him. Au contraire...Another thing I thought was strange: how did Tony make so many money, almost effortlessly? We hear him talking about millions of dollars, and that's just in his first period of reign. Is it really that easy?But overall, I enjoyed the story, although it's not the classic many people mistake it for (again, IMO). It seems a bit harsh though to give DePalma a Razzie for it... what were they thinking?7/10.",7,0,1,28 May 2004
Miracle," For a small group of fans...
","Now, I'm not a hockey fan yet alone an American one, but I can't see how anyone could take a liking in this film. It's just your typical 'group of friends' vs 'mean but superior opponents', and we all know who's going to win...The thing that really bugged me though was the complete lack of character development with any of the players, the whole story seemed to revolve about the coach (a decent Kurt Russell). And he's just not that darn interesting...So the only people that could be interested in it are either hockey fans or patriotic Americans, and preferably both. And even then one might be a bit bored after an hour or so...For me: 4/10.",4,0,12,4 November 2004
Requiem for a Dream," A top 10 film definitely
","I saw Requiem for a Dream in a cinema, and it was one of the few which actually got to me in such a way I almost had to cry at the end. I sat through all the credits before I could actually stand up. I've seen it again since on DVD, and the power of the film was still there. Sure, it's a bit much in the end, with the scenes getting more and more gruesome, with the dramatic (brilliant!) music getting faster and faster. But it worked for me, Aronofsky, as you will, 'got away with it'. Great acting as well, Burstyn definately deserved a Academy Award (Julia Roberts... yuck!). And oh do I love split screens! So, basicly, my number 8 film: 10/10",10,0,1,8 September 2002
50 First Dates," At times pretty hilarious
","This rom-com cross between Memento, Goodbye Lenin and Groundhog Day works pretty well, although the ending was a bit of a downer...Henry (Sandler) is a womanizer (hard to imagine, I know), who only has one night stands and then leaves the woman whomever he's with. But one day, he falls in love with the local Lucy (Barrymore) when they meet up in a cafe having breakfast. They hit it off and agree to meet again the next morning, but things take a turn from here on.It turns out Lucy has lost her short-term memory after an accident, and can remember exactly one day. Every day she thinks it's her father's birthday, and her father and brother work with it so things won't upset her. It's a good excuse to eat a birthday cake every day I guess...So every day Henry has to conquer Lucy again, and in the meanwhile gets to know her pretty well (comparable to Bill Murray in Groundhog Day). He eventually makes a tape with the 'highlights' of her life she has to see first thing every morning.At a time, it looks like the romance won't work because of all this trouble, but too bad the writers decided to let it have a happy ending after all...50 First Dates surely is a fun movie though, with some funny situations, in particular with an old, cynic guy in the cafe. He's hilarious! Oh and funny part by Rob Schneider as well. Better than I expected, that's for sure. 6/10.",6,0,0,4 May 2004
Monster," Mostly powerful, but hardly a classic
","Dark true story about prostitute Aileen (Charlize Theron), who in hope for a better life starts going out with young girl Selby (Christina Ricci) and killing/robbing her clients. While we first feel for her (her first 'victim' would have killed her if he had the chance), in the end she loses control completely. The scene where she shoots a guy that is really trying to help her is so hard to take... one of the most powerful and disturbing scenes I've seen in a while.Powerful probably *is* where the movie's aiming at and it gets the job done. The movie is dark and gives you an idea of how things work at the bottom of society... not a pretty sight for sure. Sometimes it's hard to understand the decisions the characters make, but most of the time you keep on feeling for the Aileen character, how monstrous she might act at times.One last thing: it seems 'Monster' is all about Charlize Theron, getting ugly and winning an Academy Award for it. But the true star is the amazing Christina Ricci, who is playing the Selby character so well, *she* should have won something for it, but didn't. Let's hope we keep on hearing from her.Final score: 7/10.",7,0,1,24 May 2004
Dawn of the Dead," Those darn Zombies again!
","'Dawn' always was the most appealing of the Romero trilogy, so I guess they made a good choice remaking this one.The movie starts literally like a blast. When coming home from work Ana (Sarah Polley) finds her husband becoming a zombie after being bit by a little girl. She flees with her car while around her the neighbourhood and the whole city collapses. Fantastic heli shots in this one, you should see the movie just for that.She then meets up with a group of people, and they all get trapped inside a mall while thousands of zombies try to get in, like in the original. Of course not everybody will make the end alive...There's some pretty gory shots in this one (check out the birth!), but it's all great fun. One to watch, although I still think 'Shaun' is the better movie...7/10.",7,0,0,11 October 2004
Shaun of the Dead," Funny, refreshing, close to brilliant
","Name a comedy (other than Bad Santa!) of recent years you actually laughed your ass off... I couldn't think of any (other than Bad Santa!), but Shaun of the Dead had me rolling all over the place.Shaun is a typical loser kinda guy (they should have had him for the Jon role in Garfield), who's dumped by his girlfriend because he always takes her to his favorite pub instead of some classy restaurant. Then there's problems with his roommate who doesn't accept the fact his sloppy and lazy best friend, Ed, is living with them.But worse things are about to happen, as suddenly there appears to be a lot of zombies wandering the streets. Oh well, let's have a cuppa tea first...The now legendary records-scene ('Second coming!', 'Yeah, well I liked it') is just one example of some hilarious scenes, too many to remember really. I'm sure gonna watch it again one of these days.The movie kinda slows down in it's last third, but by then you've seen more convincing zombies and heard more jokes and puns than any other movie of recent years (other than Bad Santa!).One to watch! 8/10.",8,0,1,23 September 2004
Elizabeth," Only for fans of the genre
","Costume drama about queen Elizabeth, who reigned England for a period of over 40 years. We follow her during her first years in power as she is supposed to marry, but ultimately doesn't, giving her the 'title' The Virgin Queen.Two stories are in the central. First of all, it's the Queens (a part by Cate Blanchett) lovelife. Three parties desperately want to marry her: the royal families of France and Spain and long time friend and lover Lord Robert (a great Joseph Fiennes, who also starred in (the much better (IMO)) Shakespeare In Love).Then there's the issue of religion. At the time Elizabeth comes to power England is a catholic country, but Elizabeth is protestant. Both sides 'meet' each other in what apparently became the Anglican church. That's a thing I didn't know yet. You see, you *can* learn things from the movies.The acting is impecable and it all looks great, but like other costume drama's it just won't stick with me. At the time of the last (great!) scene I was a bit bored ... is it just me?Strong performances make it a 5/10, but I'm sure fans of the genre (that includes the members of the Academy) will strongly disagree with me.",5,1,2,26 May 2004
The Girl Next Door," Weird, fun yet uneven
","With all the good intentions this movie may have been made with (a story about growing up, save sex, friendship and the likes), it will probably be remembered most as the movie in which Elisha Cuthbert as Danielle is showing of an awful lot of skin. Not that I, or most of the (male) audience, mind, that is. And it's the filmmaker's own fault the movie is looked upon that way. It starts out with young and inexperienced Matthew (Emile Kidman) peeping at his new nextdoorgirl while undressing. He's attracted to her (hmm, yes what teenage guy wouldn't...) and from that moment on she takes him out to make him feel more secure about himself. When they arrive at a party Matthew just feels he should do something, and there's a wonderful scene in which he just steps over his shyness to kiss her, while David Gray is singing his breathtaking This Years Love. Beautiful scene, very recognizable.But then the movie flies all over the place again, with porn, a political speech, a golden penis, violence and drugs all taking its place. No, seriously. This all makes up for an uneven film, in which the falling in love scenes between Matthew and Danielle, how unlikely they may be, make up for the best scenes of the film. They even got David Gray to sing his song for a second time! But on the other hand the movie is messy and too hard tries to fit in a happy ending. Too bad as The Girl Next Door sure has some things to offer. 6/10.",6,6,11,26 November 2004
That Thing You Do!," An OK movie I guess
","Nice little flick by Tom Hanks, about a group of teenagers from Erie, Pensyllvania becoming the next big thing in the sixties with their band, the Oneders (that's Wonders). One would expect the movie follows the routines set in this genre, but somehow it stays clear from it. The hot-shot manager (Hanks himself) is even pretty nice and the band don't break up because one guy thinks he's more important than the other one (what you would expect after drummer Guy Patterson (Tom Everett Scott) is considered the heart of the band while he's just in it for a couple of months).Too bad though there is this one thing always at the background: Faye (Liv Tyler). She's involved with singer Jimmy (Johnathon Schaech) but somehow Guy is interested in her too. Not that it's an issue throughout the movie, but you always feel it's going to end up like that. But, until that point, the friendship in the band is there and they're just having a good time while their single is climbing the charts...Small roles as well for (now) oscar-winner Charlize Theron as girlfriend of Guy, Giovanni Ribisi as original drummer of the Oneders (until he broke his arm), and Chris Isaak as Uncle Bob. Oh and I love Holmes Osborne as the father!Star for me though is Steve Zahn as Lenny. He's so funny! Anyway, a cute little movie here you will enjoy with the entire family, though nothing really special. 6/10.",6,3,6,12 May 2004
Insomnia," Not the quality I expected
","After the intruiging 'Following' and the aclaimed 'Memento' I was expecting nothing but the best from this third offering by Nolan. But man was I dissapointed. The two storylines are neither very interesting nor exciting, and personally I couldn't care less how the movie would end once I sat halfthrough it. The beautiful scenery, good acting and a brilliant scene with a light switched on (you *should* see the movie for that) don't really make up for it. I gave it 4/10.",4,2,3,12 September 2002
The Day After Tomorrow," Though I would've liked it more
","The Day After Tomorrow - It's big, it's loud, it's expensive, it's interesting... but is it truly any good? When I first saw the promo's of this film, I instantly loved it, claiming it would be not only a summer blockbuster but a possible instant classic as well. Although Emmerich made some crappy films over the years (Godzilla comes to mind), he's still a director with a good eye for incredible action scenes. Independence Day and even the cheap Moon 44 are proof of that. Plus, in The Day After Tomorrow, he had a chance of working with young talents (Jake Gyllenhaal truly is a good actor), as well as perhaps the best actor around (Ian Holm). Although it's too bad the latter doesn't really appear on screen as much as I wanted.So, expectations were high. But, although The Day After Tomorrow doesn't fail on all accounts, I must say I was a tad disappointed in the outcome. In the beginning of the movie, it takes too many too well known steps (politicians not believing the scientists, etc.), and too soon you're feeling like: alright, get on with it.When it does get on (the weather horror, that is), it all looks amazing, but the movie then is seriously damaged by some family/love stories that just won't work. Gyllenhaal and Rossum don't have any chemistry going on and when Quaid is coming out to get his son things just are getting silly.One last thought about the ending: I can understand how many people dislike it, but it's somehow a bold statement by Emmerich to make it end like that, so I'm not gonna bash him for that.In short: phenomenal effects, interesting ideas, but the movie is a bit spoiled by relationships which just won't work. 6/10.",6,1,2,23 December 2004
Closer," Striking performances, but little to enjoy
","'Who's afraid of Virginia Woolf', Nichols' classic debut on the big screen is one of the few movies I *haven't* seen yet of that brilliant list we call the IMDb top 250, but after watching 'Closer', the director latest film, you won't see me rushing to the nearest videostore to get it. And here's why.'Closer', which adapts the play of Patrick Marber, is about 4 people and their ever-changing (or are they) relationships to one another. In the beginning of the movie, we meet Alice (Natalie Portman), a young and mysterious New Yorker, who bumps into (in a way) Dan (Jude Law), a journalist-later-turned writer.After that first scene, which was quite impressive, Nichols plays a little trick. In the following scene we meet Anna (Julia Roberts), who's taking photo's of Dan to print on his book. At first I thought it was the next day, or even a flashback, but it turns out the story progressed a couple of months, to the point where Alice and Dan live together. In this scene, Dan falls for the more matured Anna, who finds him fascinating as well. And the misery starts.The fourth player in this drama is Larry (Clive Owen), a doctor who, partly accidental partly 'weird Dan scheme', meets up with Anna. The two get along, and a scene (which, in 'Closer', is a year) later are living together. But Anna can't quite forget Dan. Nor can he forget her.That's basically the plot line there for 'Closer'. In a movie like this, as in any adapted play, the acting comes first. Of the four performances, Portman's portrayal of Alice is by far the best. She's as innocent as sexy and as much a girl as she is a woman. She can play one scene in which she's a fragile, young girl, while the next moment she's stripping and saying quite nasty things to Larry.As for Julia Roberts: she once again proves she's not much of an actress. She has chosen some wise projects over the years (Notting Hill and Erin Brockovich in particular), otherwise she would have been long forgotten. Her portrayal as Anna is boring and annoying, by far she's the least shining of them all.As for the men: Clive Owen beats Jude Law on points. Both actors get their job done, but Law's 'puppy faced mean guy' routine starts to irritate in the second half of the movie, while Owen's performance is sharp and well-delivered, in quite a difficult role.So, why didn't Closer do much for me then? Well, for one, I was surprised in how little depth the characters (other than Alice) had throughout the film. The characters seem to be lacking emotions, and wander around like machines. They looked made up, not so much real or confronting. Furthermore, I couldn't relate to any of the characters, I didn't feel anything for them. It was almost like the more misery they had, the more I enjoyed myself.As a whole, 'Closer' has some good performances, and Owen and particularly Portman are allowed to actually win their Academy Awards, but as for story or character development, there is no way I could give 'Closer' the familiar two thumbs up.5/10.",5,1,1,10 February 2005
Barry Lyndon," I'm sure it's a great novelle...
","... but as a film, 'Barry Lyndon' doesn't quite work. We follow the life of country boy Redmond Barry and his rise and fall in British aristocracy. This is done in such a fragmentaric way it's hard to name it one movie. At one part, Lyndon is a spy for the Prussian Minister of Police, but only for the mere reason to make him meet the Chevalier, and the movie has loads of such bits and parts which are small movies at itself, and hardly interesting or important enough to be concluded in the whole. Another thing I found irritating is the over-use of the voice-over. He just tells way too much. Now, 'film-technical' there's nothing wrong with Barry Lyndon, it's even a masterpiece in some ways (hence the 4 oscars, and the endless and deserved praise it gets for the fantastic usage of lenses to get that candlelight feeling on the big screen), but in the end the story is not interesting enough to catch your interest, at least not for 3 whole hours. My grade: 6/10.",6,5,14,10 March 2004
The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring," Big budget... but then?
","First off, I'd like to make a statement: I have not read any of the LOTR books by Tolkien. I once started out in The Hobbit, but didn't think much of it. So I'd like to review the Movie, and will not relate it to the book. So I don't care if Middle Earth 'came to life' to some viewers, or if the Orks really had 3 eyes or whatever. I don't care about that.Let's start with a view at the story. A ring that has the power to destroy the world falls into the hands of young Frodo (Wood), who with help of several friends has to destroy it on a special place. The first movie of the trilogy basically are these people on their journey to that place.And that's it. I don't care where that place is, which member of the Fellowship really is the son of whom, what is going to happen in the next movies or whatever. This is the open ended story presented, and it's really not that interesting. Way too many (unimportant) characters are involved, the movie is lacking in story and pace and isn't as epic as a lot of people (mostly fans of the book), make you believe it is.If you analyze it, the movie goes like this: Group of people taking a journey. Have a fight. Lose a guy. Continue journey. Have a fight. Lose a guy. Continue journey, etcetera, etcetera. These fights might be against different enemies (Orks, Uru-kai, a huge monster or black knights), it all comes down to the same thing. And that, to be honest, is a bit boring.The worst part though is that when Lotr:Fotr finally does finish, nothing has really happened. They're still on their journey, still losing guys and I'm sure they're gonna have a lot more fights in the other 2 films, of which I already saw The Two Towers. Is it really necessary to expand an easy (mind you, I didn't say bad) story to a 9 hour movie extravaganza? For instance, is Cate Blanchetts character really of importance to the movie? No, the only reason she's in there because she's in the book. And that's a pretty lame reason, since this is Film-making we're talking about.Now, it's not that the Fellowship is a really bad movie. It all looks phenomenal and we have to congratulate Peter Jackson for the fact he got those studio people mad (or, in retrospect, wise) enough to spend so much money on it. We have to respect Tolkien for creating an exciting world, full of imaginative details.But, for the many things Fellowship is (a cool look at the book for fans?), a good movie it most definitely is not. 6/10.",6,19,38,20 July 2004
The Village," Top notch acting and a haunting story... but a disappointing ending
","Of Shyamalans previous movies I only liked 'Signs', so I'm hardly a fan of him. Still, there was some anticipation surrounding this movie, with it's superb cast and an interesting plot.It involves a small town hidden in the woods, where the people have some sort of truce with the creatures from those woods: they won't come in the village if the people don't go into their territory. This way, the small village has no bonds with the outside world.Problems arise when a young man called Lucius Hunt (Joaquin Phoenix) is stabbed and desperately needs medication from the outside world. His blind girlfriend Ivy (Bryce Dallas Howard) sets out to seek help, through the woods, into the wide world.In the first hour of the film, it's perfectly balanced between the scares of the creatures and the relationships unfolded, but once Ivy sets out into the woods the movie loses it's momentum. Although I filled the box 'spoilers included' I won't go too far with that: an observant viewer might know enough by remembering who the director of this movie is...As said, the ending is rather disappointing. It feels strange to see 'the real world' as we know it. There's a rather useless scene with a patrolman stealing some medication for Ivy... it just didn't really fit in to the movie.What still stands though are the excellent performances by the whole of the cast, with some exceptional acting in particular by the relatively unknown Bryce Dallas Howard and William Hurt as her father.On the whole one would perhaps expect more after it's first hour, but 'The Village' still is a movie to watch, as it's truly scary at times and has some of the best performances of the year.Edit: after watching the movie for the second time I feel I have to upgrade it to a 7/10. Special notice to the scene where Lucius grabs Ivy's hand for the first time. Perfect scene.",7,0,0,17 January 2005
Collateral," A tad boring movie with a silly ending. What's all the fuss about?
","Cabbie Max (Jamie Foxx) finds himself caught with psychopath-hit-man Vincent (Tom Cruise) in his taxi on a night with murder in the air...Vincent is doing his thing with a couple of witnesses of some sort of crime (I forget what it was), and his last stop is procecutor Annie (Jada Pinkett Smith). Now it's up to Max to stop that.Not really an amazing storyline, and to be honest, not really a special movie in any way. Foxx is pretty convincing in his role, but Cruise is nothing special and the ending is rather strange and silly. It's almost laughable when Cruise does his Terminator/Matrix thing on the subway...Movie has some compelling moments (the scene in the nightclub comes to mind) but is surely not the instant classic some people mistake it for. 6/10.",6,5,8,4 November 2004
Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban," Yep, they're back again
","Harry Potters third adventure is darker and grimmer than the first two (probably mainly because of it's new director), but that doesn't necessarily make it better... or worse, for that matter.First shots of the movie are a nice touch, as it's shot from the hand, and it shows us the movie's gonna be a bit more for the elder, as there's a foul-mouthed auntie who's getting blown up by Harry, before he leaves the house of his uncle Vernon, for good as it seems this time.He leaves for Hogwarts where the place is garded by Dementors as known killer Sirius Black (who reportedly betrayed Harry's mom and dad to Him That Shall Not Be Named (or whatever)) has escaped the infamous Azkaban (probably named after Alcatraz?), who's out to get Harry as well.Harry gets help from his old pals Ron and Hermione as well as new teacher Lupin to fight of the danger, but things aren't as they first appear (as you would expect).Before we go any further, I'd like to state I haven't read the books of Rowling, so I don't care if Hagrids hut is further from the castle than it should, and things like that. So if Cuaron thinks he should do it this way, it doesn't mean it's better or worse the way Columbus did it, it's just different.Having said that, I like the athmosphere of this movie better than the first two. Maybe because it is aimed at a bit older public (I'm 25 right now), it was a bit more exciting and scary. In fact, the Dutch certification for this movie was 9 years and older, a certification never used before. No kids stuff, for sure.The actors themselves look and act older as well. Harry looks a bit tougher and Ron has his eyes set out for Hermione, and I think many 15 year olds in the audience can't really blame him.So we have grimmer athmosphere, a more mature cast for a more mature audience, what about the story?Too bad it is exactly here the movie goes wrong. The story has it's dull moments (with 141 minutes, this really is too long people!) and flies all over the place, with some characters with too little screen time (Hagrid, Dumbledore, but more importantly, Draco) and others with too much (Hermione in particular). The 'surprise meeting' in the (ehm, forgot how the place was called), well, you know, when they're pulled underneath the tree was really silly, and the worst thing still had to come.I'm talking, of course, about the 'going back in time' incident. Why oh why do they keep on doing this. It's like that old Superman joke: why doesn't Superman ALWAYS fly around the earth so that he can undo ALL evil. I had the same with (I think) the 8th Startrek movie, where the crew goes back in time to stop those who already went back. When they're stopped, why don't they try it again, or at another point. If you have this ability to travel through time, why not use it all the time?The same things happens here. By going back in time, Harry and Hermione save the innocent, as they say. Well, if they know how to do that (and it looked really easy), why not save Harry's parents then? Why not use it for more important things than simply being able to catch more classes?It's a bit of a let-down, how this ended, and I'm sure it's the same in the book, but having not read them I can only judge the movie and I think that was a terrible mistake.All in all: it's not a bad movie for sure, and it had some enjoyable moments, but can't really give it any more than a 6/10.",6,0,2,22 June 2004
The Butterfly Effect," Fairly interesting, too bad for the ending (spoilers)
","Evan (Ashton Kutcher) suffers from losses in his memory. Obviously, something went wrong in his childhood. He finally discovers what it is, but ends up in jail for killing the kid brother of his girlfriend, who was after him after the childhood disaster. Evan finds out how to go back in time through his journals so he can erase everything that went bad, but it only gets worse... So he goes back *again*, and... well, you get it. Let's say, some sort of Lola Rennt, but not quite.Interesting premise is carried well by Kutcher (a comedy actor), but once you know what's going on loses some of it's impact. The biggest fault Gruber and Bress made is to give it a somewhat happy ending, with everybody being OK and Kutcher burning his memoirs. The 'meeting' on the sidewalks is just a bit too much I'm afraid...Overall: pretty good, 6/10.",6,0,3,6 March 2004
Before Sunset," Not completely satisfied I'm afraid
","Alright, shocking confess: I only heard of 'Before Sunrise' when this one came out. So I went out to see that a couple of weeks ago, so I could start with 'Sunset', as I believe it's pretty obligate to watch both movies to really know what's going on.So, it's nine years later. Celine (Delpy) and Jesse (Hawke, who, even more than Delpy, looks like he hasn't changed at all) have grown up without ever seeing each other again after that 16th June they promised to see each other 6 months later. As it turns out, Jesse was there in Vienna, but Celine had to attend the funeral of her grandmother.But fate, in a way, served them well. Jesse now is a somewhat famous writer (he wrote the story of 'Sunrise' down), and is on tour through Europe, signing books and answering questions. When he's about done in Paris, his last stop, Delpy walks in. That scene, by the way, is worth watching a second time.So the two start talking while wandering through France, not unlike they did in Vienna in Sunrise, but you would expect the talks to be different, more adult. And they are. After some babbling about reincarnation, playing the guitar and anything else there might come up, the two get down to the core: what's your current relationship like? Up until then, the movie is pretty jolly. When Jesse confesses he was in Vienna on December 16th, all Celine can do is laugh out loud. There's a feeling there on both of: well, okay, too bad about that, but life goes on. When later, while driving in the back of the car that should take Jesse to the airport, both confess they just can't forget that night 9 years ago, the movie starts getting more serious.You can't help comparing sequels to each other, and if I had to do that here, I'm afraid 'Sunrise' did more to me than this movie. The conversations seem more fabricated this time (I know a lot of people don't agree with me on that), the characters a bit less likable (maybe because in Sunrise they resembled my age more), and the ending far less satisfying than that of Sunrise.Not in any way that Before Sunset is a bad movie, and anyone who saw Before Sunrise should really go see it, but I just felt more connected with the first movie.6/10.",6,2,5,20 January 2005
Seabiscuit," Well made, well acted, well done.
","So here it is: a story about a horse that would give spirit to a whole nation, after the depression of the late 20's and early 30's. Make it a story where the horse and it's jockey have to overcome injury to win it's final great race, and you got your tearjerker (and, therefore, Oscar winner) right there.But, somehow, 'Seabiscuit' is much more than that. What is definitely a help, is it's incredible cast. Tobey McGuire once more shows he's one of the better youngsters around in Hollywood, and old-timers Jeff Bridges and Chris Cooper will do the rest for ya, even though Cooper is not at his best here as Tom Smith, the trainer for the horse. Then there's William H. Macy in a hilarious role as 'Tick Tock McGlaughlin', a radio presenter.The life-story we follow the most though is that of Charles Howard (Bridges), owner of the horse. As a self-made millionaire selling cars, who lost his son due to a car-accident, he finds a little bit of joy back to life, with his new wife and his new love, the horsing business. His inspirational speeches make 'Seabiscuit' a crowd-pleaser, in particular that of the 'common people', who recognize themselves in the little horse.As said, the movie is a little bit too much of a happy ending story to really make it into the 'classic' category, but the movie looks great and hasn't got a boring moment in it. Good acting all around therefore make it a very pleasant movie experience. Although the 7 academy award nominations were a little bit much...7/10.",7,5,5,23 December 2004
28 Days Later...," Horror with a twist
","Somehow, the feel of 28 days later exceeds most horror/zombie/infection movies. If such movies have flooded the box-office these last couple of years, 28 days later is, well, 'something else'.An infected monkey is freed by activists, not knowing this infection will soon spread among humans. And indeed, 28 days later, the majority of the English are infected zombie-like creatures. But somehow they past by Jim, who has been in the hospital these couple of weeks after an accident. When he wakes up, there's just empty hallways, empty streets... until he gets attacked by our growling zombies. He is then rescued by Selena and the two of them meet up with a dad and daughter, and the four of them try to make it to a, what they think, safe place.Then the movie turns more psychological, and I must say it's losing a bit of the grip it had me in during the first 45 minutes or so. Although it's still better than a lot of comparable movies in this genre, I was feeling the movie kinda ran out of steam.Danny Boyle tried something new, and it worked out for at least some parts, although ultimately (and not helped with the ending), I was expecting just a little bit more.6/10.PS Fantastic music by Godspeed You Black Emperor in the beginning with Jim wandering the streets.",6,0,1,19 October 2004
The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers," No, not quite
","In my comment on 'The Fellowship of the Ring' I made the mistake of stating I had not written any of the Tolkien books. Although not untrue, obviously what I meant to say was that I hadn't read any of them. And with this I again like to begin my commentary, as to make clear I value 'The Two Towers' as a movie, not as the filming of a book.The fellowship of 9 from part 1 are reduced to 7... uhm 8 and split up: Sam and Frodo keep on carrying the ring to Mordor, Pip and Merry are captured by some mean looking orks and the man, midget and elf trio are following these orks to rescue the two hobbits. Gandalf meanwhile takes a part as well, as he's 'reborn' even stronger and mightier than before. Talk about your deus ex machina...If 'Fellowship' was rather boring and one-directed (with events just happening over and over again until the three hours were full), 'Two Towers' is more intense but also more unclear and messy than that. It is darker than part one, but is introducing way to many characters that doesn't really matter for the continuing of the story. If part one had that problem, part two is taking it to new heights. Worst part are the dream sequences with Liv Tyler... what was that all about? Too long, boring and unimportant. Bad film-making.One of the main treats of Two Towers should be Gollum, or Smeagol (why not give every character 2 names so nobody understands it anymore). Gollum wants the ring Frodo carries, but finds himself loyal to his master as well. Now this could be interesting. Too bad nothing is really happening with this conflict, except the endless and countless monologues of Gollum... a missed chance.The end battle should cover up for everything, but it's more silly and slapstick kinda funny than intense (dwarf-tossing...). And of course it had to end with the second deus ex machina scene by Gandalf. On the other side of middle earth though things get even wackier, with silly looking trees (did they run out of budget?) attacking the Tower of Saruman. Watch out for the flooding scene... it has B-movie written all over it.Although I can understand why these movies are appealing to some (in particular the ones who love the Tolkien books), there is no way you can say The Two Towers is one of the best movies ever. There are so many moments the tension drops, so many silly hold-ups, a cast (although trying) undermined by the CGI. In a way, Two Towers is more compelling than Fellowship, but on the whole it doesn't even live up to it's very mediocre prequel. Let's just hope for the best for Return of the King. 5/10.",5,1,2,4 August 2004
School of Rock," This movie is fun fun FUN!
","The energetic Jack Black shines as Dewey, a 30-or-so Rock 'n' Roll lover who can't get his life together. He's being thrown out of his own band and his friend/roommate Ned wants him to finally pay his part of the rent. Then a phonecall throws his whole life around...A hot-shot school wants Ned to substitute for some sick teacher, but Dewey decides to check the place out for himself. It turns out his 10 year old students know how to play some pretty cool music. A band, the 'School of Rock', is born!Black is amazing in this one as he is hyped up the entire movie but he just won't get irritating. Mike White, who apparently wrote the movie, has the perfect face for the nerdy Ned and the kids all play really well, with the 'Summer' kid the star of the youngsters.The movie ends a little bit too cliche, but the rollercoaster of laughs beforehand make up for that. A good movie all around.7/10.",7,2,4,13 April 2004
Coyote Ugly," I actually liked it
","Now here's one silly, formulaic romantic comedy I actually... like! Violet is a waitress with ambitions to make it in the big city (NY this time) as a singer-songwriter (what else really :). The movie follows all the necessary steps (work sucks at first, meets boyfriend, work's getting better, boyfriend is great, breakdown at work, break-up with boyfriend, thinking about returning, chat with dad that she has to stay to make it, finally makes up with boyfriend and makes it in music industry). Now, we've all seen it before (showgirls comes to mind), but it's carried out really good in this movie. Perabo is perfectly cast as innocent but sexy star, Garcia is good as boyfriend and Goodman is perfect as dad and comic relief. Not a brilliant movie, but just fun to watch and pretty flawless. 7/10, which is high for the genre.",5,1,2,7 March 2004
Hero," Wow.
","Beautifully made cross between Rashomon (the storytelling), Ran (the 7 kingdoms) and Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon (the effects) has a nameless warrior (Jet Li) on a visit to the King of Qin. He tells him how he defeated the King's 3 main enemies. But not everything is how it seems in this wonderful picture.Zhang's recent picture House of the Flying Daggers might not have been what everybody's been expecting, but 'Hero' is so beautiful at times it hurts your eyes. Scenes in particular to look out for are the sword dance on the water and a breathtaking scene including thousands and thousands of bows. You keep your mouth closed in that scene...Maybe not such a huge surprise as Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon, but a movie for everyone to see. 8/10.",8,0,2,18 November 2004
Meet Joe Black," When it smells like overlong, and looks like overlong...
","Meet Joe Black, aka death. Now, he wasn't always death, but decided to take the body of Joe (Pitt), who gets run over (quite spectacularly I might add). Death visits rich guy Parrish (Hopkins), and makes a deal: he will let him live (for now that is), for a look at life and how to live it. Problem here: Parrish's daughter (Forlani) falls for Death, erm, Joe, who she met right before he died.As interesting as it may sound, that's no reason to make the movie last for 3 whole hours. There just isn't enough to work with, so an interesting story with perhaps some interesting statements is completely gunned down by the dreadful pace. It's just annoying, there's no other way of putting it.There seems to be an interesting downfall of Brest's career going on: from the great Midnight Run, then this nonsence, and ultimately the much talked about Gigli... say no more, say no more! 3/10.",3,1,4,3 April 2004
The Nightmare Before Christmas," They should play this every year 'round Christmas time...
","...but, in fact, as far as I know, it's never been played on Dutch TV. Such a shame, as it is one of the best Christmas' movies of all time.Meet Jack Skellington, a (you guessed it) skeleton who lives in Halloween-town and makes kids scare on Halloween, year in year out. But Jack wants something more in life, and finds out about Christmas. Now that's a fun holiday! So he decides to kidnap Santa and take over his role. He does it with the best intentions (as far as kidnapping goes), but everything goes wrong... The kids aren't really happy with the presents (as they are more like scary monsters instead of Teddy bears) and Santa winds up in the hands of the evil Boogyman. Is there time to turn it all back?Tim Burton's characters and ideas are really amazing. Though a bit scary for the youngest, Halloween-town looks great. The story is really touching and the songs are some of the best the movies ever gave to us (Danny Elfman not only wrote the music, but sings on this one as well!). It's one of those movies you actually want to end well. Watch it and maybe you'll fall for it too...8/10.",8,1,2,3 April 2004
Resident Evil: Apocalypse," It's all been done before
","I have to admit: 'Resident Evil' was some sort of a guilty pleasure. But now there's a part 2 and I'm sure that someday there'll be a part 3 (concidering the open ending of 'Apocalypse'). And I feel myself thinking: I've seen this before. Dozens and dozens of times. Why do I even bother anymore? Milla Jovivich is Alice again, and this time her fight is against some evil 'Nemesis' monsters and other nasty Umbrella corporation types, while saving a little girl from zombie-dead. Main help is Jill Valentine (Sienna Guillory), whose main importance it is to 'look hot', as Jovovich explained in a TV special.The movie has all the necessary ingredients to make up for a decent movie (a cool heroin, some monsters, a really really bad guy and fine effects), but it's never fresh or original. Too bad.5/10.",5,1,5,14 January 2005
Shrek 2," Lacking in wit and charm
","The original Shrek was a treat for the eye, and deserved the praise, awards and money it got. Too bad the sequel doesn't really provide any of the aspects that made 'Shrek' such a fun movie.The main problem of the movie I think is that 'Shrek' now is an engaged man (well, male ogre anyway), who feels he has to 'fit in' in society. If in part 1 he was free to be himself, now he is bound by rules. In this way, the story feels more 'real' if you will, with real people and real emotions playing a part in the 'Kingdom, Far Far Away'. Shrek 1, in a sense, was more absurd, and therefore way funnier and fresher, than part 2.I'm not getting my hopes up for part 3 anymore... 5/10.",5,3,6,20 January 2005
Kill Bill: Vol. 1," Bang Bang
","Quentin Tarantino probably is the only director to get away with a movie like Kill Bill. It's basically an ultra-violent one-idea movie, but done with style.Movie starts of with a bang literally, as 'The Bride' (Uma Thurman) is almost killed on a massacre at her wedding, where the notorious 'Bill' killed 9 people, including the groom and the minister apparently. We don't know why he did it, or who 'The Bride' really is, we have to just go along with it.The Bride wakes up after a coma and decides to kill Bill and his (female) helpers. The biggest part of the movie concentrates on The Bride wanting to kill O-Ren Ishii (Lucy Liu), who is introduced in a great way into the film, with a short (extremely violent) anime. Great stuff.Rest of the movie mainly consists of The Bride slicing and chopping everybody that comes in her way. Death count must be about equal to 'Commando' and those kinds of movies. There isn't a real story in it, we just have to wait for part 2 for that I suppose. Hell, it even has a cliffhanger you would only see on Days Of Our Lives and comparable soap operas.In short: stylish, violent, fragmentaric, good stuff, but one would expect more. 7/10.",7,0,1,11 May 2004
Big Fish," It's hard to describe what a wonder this movie is... (spoilerish)
","Picture a man in his forties reading a book in his comfortable chair. He's laughing, screaming 'I love it!' and thinking: I will make this into a movie.This is what must have happened when Tim Burton read Daniel Wallace's 'Big Fish: A Novel of Mythic Proportions'. Now, I haven't read it myself, but if it's anything like the movie (and why wouldn't it), I can see why Burton loved it so much he wanted to turn it into a movie.You see, Big Fish is one big fairytale. And Burton has something going for fairytales. Look at The Nightmare Before Christmas, Sleepy Hollow or Edward Scissorhands. I wouldn't even have been surprised if Edward would have turned up in this wild fantasy story called Big Fish, where stories about midgets, giants, hidden towns, siamese twins and the inevitable big fish make up for one the most touching films ever to be put on screen.Ed Bloom sr. (Albert Finney) loves telling the stories about his 'adventures' when he was young (Ewan McGreggor). And when he was young, Ed Bloom jr. (Billy Crudup) loved hearing them. But once you hear the same story hundreds and hundreds of times, you're getting bored with them. And when your dad tells them again on your wedding night, you get mad. It's what happens as these two get into a fight, not to speak again for the next three years.It is at that time that Jr. is about to become a first-time dad while Sr. is on his deathbed, they meet again. And this time, Jr. wants his old man to tell the truth for once and for all, instead of these lies, how amusing they might be.And they are amusing. As well as touching. Remarkable. Fantastic. Beautiful. I won't go into them too deeply, but they include giants, midget-werewolves and poets slash bankrobbers slash wall-street millionaires. And it are stories about the love for a one-eyed witch and, of course, those really big fish.But in the end, it's the story of the father and son, of truth, of friendship, and in the end, of love. The way Jr. 'talks' his father into death is breath-taking, exhilarating, it's wonderful. The first movie that almost took me to tears since I saw 'Ordinary People' for the first time about a year ago.I always wanted to say this: It may be just my very humble opinion, but I have no problem proclaiming 'Big Fish' to be the best movie of 2003.9/10.",9,0,0,29 May 2004
The Mummy Returns," I actually liked it
","Good old-fashioned adventure no-brainer works perfect just like that, as The Mummy Returns provides loads of fun.Our two heroes from the first Mummy (Brendan Fraser and lovely Rachel Weisz) are now married and have an eight year old son. He's a bit of a brat, and apparently his parents think alike as they don't hesitate to make out while he is kidnapped by some scary mummy type guys.The story makes no sense of course (and sometimes is a bit hard to follow), but the special effects truly are amazing and comic relief by John Hannah as Weisz's sister is very funny. I'd say it's better than the first one, 7/10.",7,1,1,4 May 2004
The Last Samurai," Oh no. It's one of those dying with honour movies again...
","In fairness, if you're gonna watch a movie by Edward 'Glory' Zwick starring Tom 'overdoing it' Cruise, you shouldn't be surprised of the result 'The Last Samurai' is: a powertrip by the last combining the over the top 'dying with honour' crap from the first. And it's exactly that. It's long, it's loud, it's purposeless, meaningless and shallow: it is, really, my worst nightmare.Not that The Last Samurai is a complete waste though: there's some good acting (although the academy award nomination for Watanabe was a bit overdone) and a couple of *decent* (mind you, not *good*) battlescenes. But nevermind the story: overblown pretentious silliness disguised rather poorly as an epic action movie.Perhaps for the people who liked 'Gladiator' (Oh, how I hated that movie), but if I were you I'd stay away from it. 4/10.",4,9,19,23 September 2004
Love Actually," Wanted to embrace it, but couldn't
","'Whenever I get gloomy with the state of the world, I think of the arrivals gate at Heathrow Airport. General opinion's starting to make out that we live in a world of hatred and greed, but I don't see that. It seems to me that love is everywhere.' With this monologue by the British Prime Minister (played by Hugh Grant), that wouldn't have been misplaced in The Great Dictator (I mean that as about the highest honour I can give), Love Actually begins. It's the story of about a dozen people (all somehow linked to each other), who are in relationships of some sort. Some fall in love, some cheat, some just don't know what to do with themselves.Obviously, one story is better than another. For instance, there's this guy going to the USA to 'score some babes', and he actually does, but we couldn't care less. Then there are two 'actors' who hit it off, but that's not really that interesting neither, nor is the romance between a woman (Laura Linney) and a co-worker, with a mentally ill brother standing in the way of things.Other stories work better, with the Prime Minister falling for a servant of his, and a widowed step-dad (Liam Neeson) explaining his 'new' son how to act towards the most popular girl in school.The two really interesting stories that remain are that of cheating husband Harry, and how his wife is dealing with that and the romance between writer Jamie (Colin Firth) and his Portuguese cleaning lady. There's a wonderfull scene where Jamie is asking her father for her hand, and the whole town following them to where she works.But overall, the movie was a bit disappointing. The love-stories were too simple, too flat and one-dimensional. Also, the 'red line' between things (no. 1 hit by 'Billy Mack') turned a bit boring near the end. Too bad as I really wanted to love this movie for it's bright and upbeat message.Final score: 5/10.",8,5,11,1 May 2004

Denzel Washington.He's playing 'Creasy', a hardass, tough but somehow likable former agent in need of a job. This is provided by an old time buddy (Christopher Walken) and consists of protecting a young girl in Mexico from getting kidnapped. But not even Creasy can stop this from happening, and he vows to avenge her death (after some rather crappy negotiations).I won't give away any more, as this is one to watch by all accounts. Even Mr. J-lo (number 3, 4?) can't prevent that from happening... Now give that man a deserved Oscar for once!8/10.",8,2,6,19 October 2004

","Disney returns to style with 'The Lion King', a great story for the whole family about a young lion and his destiny.This young lion's name is Simba, but they might as well call him Sambi, as it's the tale of a young animal who has to face his responsibilities after the death of an elder, in this case, Simba's father King Mufasa.Evil genius is uncle Scar, who wants to rule himself, and he does as Mufasa gets killed and Simba leaves the kingdom, thinking he's responsible for his fathers death.Movie lightens up a bit then with the introduction of the hilarious Timon and Pumbaa, then turns heavy-handed again when Simba reclaims the crown when he returns to the kingdom.Fantastic animations and a compelling story make it an experience world wide, although the songs aren't the best IMHO.Overall: 7/10.",7,0,1,27 May 2004
Signs," A nice surprise
","After the abysmal and overrated Sixth Sense and the even worse Unbreakable I wasn't expecting much of this movie, but it seems I was too quick to judge. Signs is a movie which I found actually scary. From the first moment in the crop fields right to the end when Gibson's character 'sees the sign' provided by his wife it had me glued to my seat. The actors were very good as well, and Night (saves me the typo's :)) shows he does know how to build a scene. In short: a very well done film. 8/10.",8,7,15,12 September 2002
Identity," Well it's fine, until... SPOILERS
","Once every while you watch a movie that you thouroughly enjoy, but still feel cheated afterwards. 'Identity' must be the ultimate movie in that category, as it's spooky, stylish, dark and scary, but ultimately very unsatisfying. Ten people are being forced to stay in a motel for the night after a storm flooded all the highway exits. Soon, the character mysteriously die one at a time (think 10 little indians), and it's up to main character Ed (John Cusack) to figure out just what is happening.It sounds like an exciting story, and it is. The actors (besides Cusack we see - amongst others - Ray Liotta and Amanda Peet) are fine, the atmosphere just right and the story entertaining as well as dark. But then, about 3/4 into the movie, the writers spoil it by completely explain the plot and what the heck is going on.(SPOILERS BEGIN) It turns out Cusack really is one of 10 identities a serial killer has, and the others in the motel are the other 9. One of those 10 is a killer, while the others may not be as harmful. The real killer's lawyer wants to establish this so he can plead insanity, and the killer won't get the death penalty. The idea of the lawyer is to have Cusack kill of the murderer in his mind, so he won't be a danger anymore. There, got it?It's all a bit silly, come to think of it, but the worst part is that it is all happening after 3/4 of the movie. So the last 20 minutes or so, when tension should rise, you're watching a movie about fictious people, to save the life of a known serial killer. That's not really helping the story, to put it mildly.Enough has been said about the ending, it's just so stupid I won't waste any words on it. Identity could've been such a good movie, now it's just entertaining until that very moment everything is revealed...5/10.",5,7,12,8 August 2004
The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King," Such a disappointing journey
","Considering the hype, box office numbers, Oscars and everything else, the Lord of the Rings trilogy has been for a lot of people the highlight of film making these last couple of years. And even without very much liking it, as a person who did not read the books and though I feel that everybody was just overdoing it, I must congratulate Peter Jackson and his team of cast and crew by accomplishing just that. Maybe, when things cool down a bit and other projects take their place in the spotlights, I can honestly get over the fact that all those people who think this is how movies should be, clearly outnumber the people like myself who see it as a good, but ultimately failed attempt on producing a wonderful trilogy from a no doubt inspiring book.Peter Jackson did not have an easy job by filming the trilogy, and I will give you an example on how to work with a silly part of the trilogy (I at least assume that the next passage is in the book somewhere as well). It's when Frodo is attacked by the huge spider, and taken to a castle of the orks (or similar nasty creatures).In the next scene, we see how 2 orks get into a fight over I think a piece of clothing. Everybody (that is, the other orks) have their say in it and a huge brawl starts. So when Sam comes to the castle to save his master Frodo, he finds thousands of Orks dead on the ground, only having to kill about 4 of them before getting to the top of the tower, where Frodo is held.Now, in any other movie that takes itself remotely serious, these events would be laughable, ridiculous, the movie would be slammed for it. But here comes the nice part: because it is 'in the book', Jackson gets away with these silly little facts. As he got away with the fact that the whole and entire army of Sauron go on and take on the army, not one noticing the two little hobbits and the creature called Gollem. And there are other examples, like the death and rise (apparently) from Gandalf in part 2, the oh-so easy defeat of Saruman when some silly looking trees come to action... the plot holes are endless.I will be clear: because of above reasons (amongst others), I do not think highly of the Lord of the Rings trilogy. It started out with the rather boring Fellowship, went on with the loud but ultimately silly Two Towers, and ended with the incredibly disappointing and not satisfying Return of the King, the least of the three. It's too long, with lulls everywhere and a complete lack of decent acting because of the overuse of CGI. It's boring, silly and not to be taken seriously. It's, in one word, a drag, in particular for people who did not read the books, or didn't take much fun into them.So, in the end, there's a trilogy here that has ruled the box office and that special night somewhere in february nowadays, but I am not convinced one bit. And somehow I don't think I will be any time in the future...As for Return of the King: 4/10.",4,13,29,10 September 2004
Dodgeball," Hilarious
","Maybe the underquote of 'Dodgeball' shouldn't be: 'A true underdog story', but 'how a comedy about the stupidest subject became one of the best of recent years'.So there's your typical group of losers, who all are connected to 'Average Joe's' gym, in desperate need of some money, or else they will be bought up by snotty Globo Gym owner White Goodman (Ben Stiller in yet another great role). They enter a dodgeball competition to get the needed 50 grand, but of course Globo Gym enter their own team. So, who's gonna make it to the final and who will ultimately become Dodgeball heroes? We all know the answers, but that's OK, 'cause Dodgeball has so many fun to offer we don't even care. As I said, Stiller's hilarious, as are Joel Moore and Stephen Root, but the true star is Rip Torn. His characterization of coach Patches O'Houlihan, once the best Dodgeball player around, should deserve him an Oscar. And I mean it.One more notable appearance: Christine Taylor again is a nice surprise (as in Zoolander), I noticed she's not really doing anything now: how come? All in all: great fun, some fantastic comical deliveries (although Vince Vaugn is a bit of a let-down), a comedy for everyone to watch. 7/10.",7,0,0,23 December 2004
Rock Star," Boring movie about boring music
","80's sleazy (glam)rock is like 90's house music or current boybands: it's boring and has no ideas or ideals. The only thing that makes it a bit 'cult' nowadays is that it's a long time ago, so we can laugh at its sillyness. Too bad 'Rock Star' has no laughs at all, as it must be one of the most boring movies of recent years.Chris (Mark Wahlberg) is singer of a Steel Dragon tribute band. When he's kicked of the band at the same time the real Steel Dragon singer is kicked of as well, he becomes the next lead singer. You already know how this is gonna end up at that time, with Chris losing it with sex, drugs and r&r and forgetting about his long-time girlfriend/manager, Emily (Jennifer Aniston).There's way too much (boring) music in this standard formula-packed excuse for a movie and should be avoided for it at all cost. Watch the (over-rated, but still more fun) Almost Famous instead, or even better, a movie about real people playing real music having real emotions, That Thing You Do.What a stinker. 2/10.",2,1,4,23 May 2004
