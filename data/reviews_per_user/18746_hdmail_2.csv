The Blair Witch Project," Docu-Comedy
","Some horror movies are meant to be funny, but I'm pretty sure 'Blair Witch' was meant to be taken seriously.  Too bad.  Any haunting qualities this picture could have had, based on the innovative filming techniques and exquisitely ominous setting, were overshadowed by the constant bickering, whining, and tears of the three 'stars'.  By far my favorite part of this movie is the closeup of Heather Donahue's runny nose.  (I would like to see this movie become a cult classic like 'The Rocky Horror Picture Show', where you can go to the theater and throw rolls of toilet paper -- or, in the case of Heather Donahue, boxes of Kleenex.)  I know that this movie can't have been that good because by the end, I was rooting for the Witch.",1,1,3,17 July 2000
The Mummy," Good if you don't expect to be scared.
","The original 'Mummy' was definitely more scary than this 1999 update, but this version still makes a pretty good showing.  Aside from the humor and rich special effects, the background story is well-explained and overall it's worth viewing.  It's sort of a cross between Indiana Jones and the Elizabeth Peter Egyptology novels starring Emerson and Peabody.",10,0,0,31 July 2000
