Ford v Ferrari," Wow, and worth 4d viewing
","What an incredible film, great pace, amazing acting, a story that sucks you in and takes you on a ride. I thought that it may feel too long but the time flew by and I didn't want it to end!! The 4d staging was perfect too. I'm heading back for this at the cinema again for sure!",10,4,10,15 November 2019
