Mission: Impossible III," Best one so far!!
",I saw an early preview of this movie and i thoroughly enjoyed it. Even though the plot wasn't that great the action was incredible (i especially enjoyed the scene on the bridge) I dragged my wife along to see this film which she had no interest in and had not seen the other two but she enjoyed it to my surprise as she doesn't particularly like this type of film. What stood out for me was that it was the right combination of story and action which i thought made it the best out of the three films because i found the first one had too much story and not enough action and the second film had no plot whatsoever and the action scenes that were a bit too unbelievable. I recommend this to anyone who liked the previous films and to those who just want to see a good popcorn flick.,8,2,14,10 May 2006
X-Men: The Last Stand," Wow! what a film
","I saw this film on Thursday and all i can say is wow what a film. This film had everything, action, emotion, drama, comedy it was unbelievably good. Brett Ratner did a very good job and i was a bit sceptical because Bryan Singer dropped out and then nobody else wanted to do it but this movie was awesome. All the characters were great although i was really gutted with the lack of screen time given to cyclops and the fact that he died along with other major characters. That is my only negative point regarding the film. If you are a fan of X-Men you have to see it and if you are not a fan you still have to see it. I thoroughly recommend it. Brilliant film",6,31,60,26 May 2006
