Black Swan," Rubbish
","Awful does not even start to describe this! I was tempted to walk out from the time it started and only having my lovely girlfriend by my side kept me in. Natalie Portman is amazing - to lose so much weight and then to learn how to look as if you can dance, her acting is also superb, really want to see her again. But all her brilliance was totally wasted by a clueless plot and directing. I suppose the movie would appeal to you if you like seeing dysfunctional families and believe that one can only get the top job (be it prima ballerina or a James Bond girl) in the industry by sleeping with the right people, then this is a movie for you. Frankly, this on is an absolute stinker. Don't waste your time and money - better buy a special edition of Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels, gift pack of Paolo Di Canio's best goals or even David Beckham's biography. Even that will be a better investment.",1,13,22,13 April 2011
