It," The kids are great, Bill Skarsgard is phenomenal
","I want to warn you, It really is a different kind of horror movie, it is much more than that i might add. It's not just scary. It is interesting (!) fun, entertaining.. The Children are great, humor is great. Bill Skarsgard as Pennywise is phenomenal! I wanted a little bit more screen time for him... Hope to see the second part and much more Pennywise! P.S. Go, see It !",10,6,15,9 September 2017
The King," Great acting!
","I was sceptical at the beginning, as the other Netflix films are boring to say a least and waste of time (in my not so humble opinion) . But I thought i'd give it a shot. Acting was superb, enjoyed every minute of it!",9,6,11,2 November 2019
