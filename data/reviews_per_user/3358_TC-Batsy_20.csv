Minority Report," Tom Cruise's Stellar Performance
","Tom Cruise and Steven Spielberg gave movie buffs an underrated sci-fi film based on Philip K. Dick's short story with twists and mind blowing CGI - at that time - in a futuristic Washington DC. Tom Cruise is incredible in Minority Report, and his stellar performance as John Anderton marked the beginning of his successful movies in the sci-fi genre that later followed. Everybody runs!",10,1,1,6 June 2020
Billy Elliot," Born with a Talent
","Billy Elliot, a young boy discovers his passion for dancing in an English mining community that expects boys to behave like men all the time and perceives that ballet is only for females and gay men. The boy doesn't realize his talent without the help of his teacher Mrs. Wilkinson who sees him as a potential ballet dancer in the future, and believes that working in the mines like his father and brother will kill his dream. A delightful comedy with Billy's grandmother who still dreams that she can always be a professional dancer despite the circumstances that have forced her to live in that community, so it's her fate which she cannot escape. It's a great movie with lots of beautiful and unforgettable moments between Billy and his family and friends.",10,1,2,26 May 2006
Suicide Squad," DC Does It Again
","I never cared about those arrogant critics because their reviews never influence my decision to watch a certain movie whether it's good or not. Suicide Squad became a hit on very different on many levels as we see the bad guys behaving as heroes fighting an evil entity in this dark action comedy movie. The performances of Will Smith, Viola Davis, Margot Robbie, Jai Courtney and the other actors were sublime except for Cara Delevingne who is a terrible actress and should stick to modeling. I liked the Batman cameo and the reference to Superman's death from the last movie. DC movies never disappoint and they're way superior to Marvel.",10,4,11,8 August 2016
Oblivion," Beautiful
","Oblivion takes you to a post-apocalyptic future set in 2077 after an alien invasion destroys half the planet and its moon. Jack Harper played by the amazing Tom Cruise goes to the surface on a regular basis to repair drones while his partner Vica stays in the Sky Tower as his communications officer, they only have two weeks left before their mission ends so they can return to a space station and join the others. However, Jack is not enthusiastic about leaving Earth and expresses his desire to spend the rest of his life at his cabin by the lake with relics from the past like books and vinyl records, until one day he meets a mysterious woman who claims to know him and that triggers a series of shocking revelations about his existence. Even though this is Joseph Kosinski's second film, he and his crew did a fantastic job with the visual effects and using the breathtaking landscapes of Iceland for the desolate cities, and the soundtrack blends very well from the first till the last frame. Tom Cruise still proves that he's at the top of his game at the age of fifty where he does his own stunts and continues to give an astounding performance which he always does. For fans of the science fiction genre, Oblivion is the perfect movie and it deserves multiple accolades for its exceptional plot, acting and cinematography.",10,2,5,20 April 2013
Bohemian Rhapsody," When Rock Music Was Entertaining
","Bohemian Rhapsody is not only for Queen fans, but also for people who appreciate rock music when it used to be entertaining unlike the trash we are listening today.",10,2,3,26 December 2018
Man of Steel," Sublime
","I saw Man of Steel five years ago on Father's Day and I really enjoyed it. Henry Cavill is perfect as the latest Superman/Clark Kent of this decade and liked how his iconic suit - without the red briefs - is given a new makeover. The other actors like Amy Adams, Laurence Fishburne, Diane Lane and of course, Michael Shannon are great in their roles respectively. The DC Universe is getting better with each movie based on our favorite superheros. Man of Steel is sublime and the soundtrack by Hans Zimmer is awesome.",10,2,3,31 August 2018
Mission: Impossible - Rogue Nation," Forget Bond and Bourne, Ethan Hunt is the Best Secret Agent
","I loved Mission: Impossible Rogue Nation as much as the previous movies of the MI franchise. Thanks to Tom Cruise and Christopher McQuarrie for giving the audiences an action-packed, adrenaline pumping experience which included Tom's death-defying stunts like hanging outside an aircraft and despite the risks, he pulled it off as usual because he's a real actor who always gives 100 percent in every movie he does. The cast is amazing including Simon Pegg, Rebecca Ferguson and Ving Rhames. Forget Bond and Bourne because Ethan Hunt is the best secret agent ever. I give Mission: Impossible Rogue Nation 10 stars and looking forward to see the sixth mission.",10,3,6,4 December 2015
Collateral," Unstoppable
","Collateral is a very unique action-thriller movie which I personally enjoy seeing it. It has a great cast starring Tom Cruise as Vincent, the cold-blooded hit man out to do his job and Jamie Foxx as Max the reluctant cab driver with big dreams. When both men meet each other, their lives are no longer the same on that particular night as they have to survive a game of cat and mouse while law enforcement officers and a dangerous drug cartel are tracking them. Vincent is doing all the killings and Max has to drive him all over L.A. without resisting him as he's the hostage. I really liked the plot in this film which gives viewers the opportunity to interpret and analyze the characters of Vincent and Max who show a lot of depth. Among all the action movies, Collateral is on the top of my list.",10,1,1,15 September 2012
Mission: Impossible - Ghost Protocol," Mission Accomplished!
","I'm a huge fan of the Mission Impossible movie franchise and I have seen all of them. In this fourth installment of the successful series, agent Ethan Hunt and his team are disavowed after a rogue terrorist known as Cobalt bombs the Kremlin and frames them for it. Ethan and his teammates have to prove their innocence and prevent Cobalt from using nuclear launch codes to start a deadly war between the United States and Russia in a game of cat and mouse from Moscow to Dubai and Mumbai. In this movie, Tom Cruise did one of the most risky daredevil stunts in his amazing film career by dangling from the tallest building in the world, the Burj Khalifa which left me at the edge of my seat. He's without any doubt a sophisticated actor and stuntman always putting his heart and soul in every movie he works on. I'm also looking forward to see Mission : Impossible 5 in the future. Mission Impossible : Ghost Protocol deserves 10 stars!",10,2,3,23 April 2013
Aladdin," Terrific
",I decided to see Aladdin because of Will Smith and he did a terrific job as the Genie. Don't let the haters discourage you from watching the movie.,10,6,10,18 August 2019
Eyes Wide Shut," Keep Your Eyes Wide Shut
","Stanley Kubrick was a genius filmmaker who knew how to master the art of storytelling in such aesthetic and mysterious proportions which he kept doing in all of his unforgettable films. Eyes Wide Shut sheds light on Bill Harford, a doctor living happily with his wife Alice and their seven-year-old daughter Helena. The night Alice talks about her sexual fantasy with another man sets Bill on a strange journey of jealousy and lust throughout New York City where he learns from his old friend Nick about an underground cult where men and women engage in sexual rituals. The orgy's atmosphere looks intimidating and gloomy especially when Bill finds himself in danger for infiltrating into the mansion until a masked woman sacrifices herself so no harm will come to him. Bill's unusual experience on that particular night haunt him after being warned by the Master of Ceremonies not to tell a soul about the orgy or he and his family will suffer severe consequences. Tom Cruise was fantastic as Bill Harford, his acting was sublime and natural and even though I dislike Nicole Kidman she was good in some parts. Eyes Wide Shut is a unique sexual thriller and a masterpiece.",10,1,1,14 October 2012
Jack Reacher," Jack Reacher is a Great Action Thriller!
","I haven't read Lee Child's books but thanks to this film I'm already interested in finding more about Jack Reacher and his adventures as an ex-military cop seeking justice in his own terms. Jack Reacher is a witty, serious, strong and intelligent man who tries to solve a case involving a sniper responsible for shooting random people in downtown Pittsburgh. With the help of Helen Rodin, a young defense attorney they dig deeper into the murder case and discover something sinister and evil which is very shocking. The action scenes are incredible including the car chase in a classic '72 Chevelle. People who claim to be fans of the Jack Reacher books made a big deal when Tom Cruise was chosen to play the main character who happens to be over six feet tall and weighs more than 200 pounds. There is no actor in Hollywood who fits the physical description of Jack Reacher and only Tom managed to capture his essence in a very remarkable manner thanks to his unique acting abilities and talent.",10,3,8,6 February 2013
American Made," Just Wow!
","American Made or Mena is an amazingly sublime, beautiful movie and it's worth the money. Tom Cruise - who is still on the top of his game - really hit it out of the park and he knows how to do comedy especially when playing an anti-hero like Barry Seal and his penchant for doing stunts has no boundaries that's why they look real and keep you on the edge of your seat. American Made also highlights the corrupted politicians and CIA officials who played a role in the Contras and shaped the politics of that era during the Cold War. Tom deserves his long-awaited Oscar for portraying someone like Barry in this film along with Doug Liman who is a talented filmmaker and his father was one of the prosecutors in the Iran-Contra Affair. I wish I could give this movie more than 10 stars because it's very underrated.",10,3,7,22 October 2017
Joker," DC Does It Again! Eat Your Hearts Out, Marvel
","Joker will always be one of the most iconic villains in pop culture. In this dark movie, mental illness and injustice drive a simple man into madness as he struggles to be a comedian and put a smile on people's faces. I've never liked Joaquin Phoenix and his movies, but he did a wonderful job as Batman's archenemy.",10,2,4,12 November 2019
Edge of Tomorrow," Movie of the Year
","I have been anticipating to see Edge of Tomorrow formerly known as All You Need is Kill and words cannot describe how much I loved every second of it and had to watch this incredible movie over and over again. It has the elements of a successful sci-fi film combined with action, humor and drama that can keep you on the edge of your seat thanks to its unique script about Major Bill Cage who finds himself resetting the day every time he dies in a battle against aliens. Edge of Tomorrow is the first Hollywood picture to be based on a Japanese Manga, and hats off to Tom Cruise who remains as the best movie star after three decades and still makes great movies while doing his own stunts and showing his talents in comedy along with Bill Paxton, Emily Blunt and Noah Taylor. I adore this movie and I've seen it at least six times and looking forward to own it forever on DVD. Edge of Tomorrow deserves 10 stars.",10,6,10,19 June 2014
Wonder Woman," DC Greatness
","Gal Gadot is impressive as Wonder Woman in her first solo action movie after her debut in Batman VS Superman Dawn of Justice, and she nailed one of DC's most iconic characters. More greatness from DC and looking forward to see Wonder Woman 1984.",10,6,10,20 April 2019
Vanilla Sky," Tom Cruise the Mysterious One
","Vanilla Sky is a unique and great movie. It makes you think and wonder what has really happened to the protagonist (David Aames), and whether the entire movie is based on his dreams, or not? Tom Cruise was terrific when he portrayed David Aames, a wealthy playboy who doesn't know how to keep his promises, especially when it comes to having sex with Julia whom he doesn't love. During his birthday party, David meets the lovely Sophia who captures his heart despite being his best friend's new girlfriend. He soon finds himself drawn to her and in love at the same time. But everything ends tragically for David when Julie takes him for drive in her car and attempts to kill him as a punishment for his disloyalty towards her. She dies in the accident that leaves him with a disfigured face and in a coma for three weeks. In my humble opinion, I think that David's dilemma, as well as his love affair with Sophia both change him emotionally as he tries to overcome all the errors that he made in his lifetime. Finally, Vanilla Sky is a combination of science-fiction, thriller, mystery and romance for those who like to understand movies from a different point of view.",10,1,2,28 March 2005
Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice," Epic Battle Between the Greatest Superheroes
","Two iconic superheros facing off is what made me love Batman VS. Superman Dawn of Justice. The epic fight between Batman and Superman- whose differences in terms of character- created unforgettable moments before they join hands to fight a common enemy. Casting Ben Affleck as Batman/Bruce Wayne was a great choice despite the negativity he received from the fans who judged him before seeing his performance as the most charismatic comic book character ever created. Henry Cavill is the best Superman/Clark Kent in my opinion and he captured his essence perfectly since Man of Steel three years ago. Jesse Eisenberg was impressing in his first role as a villain, both Amy Adams and Gal Gadot were amazing as Lois Lane and Wonder Woman. The music composed by Hans Zimmer is haunting and beautiful on many levels which is why the soundtrack is a must for every fan of the DC universe.",10,3,6,22 July 2016
Interview with the Vampire: The Vampire Chronicles," For Those Who Like Vampires
","Interview with the Vampire is an excellent horror movie that sheds light on the emotional and humane aspects of a vampire who is disdainful of his powerful nature to hunt down and kill mortals for their blood in order to survive. While living in New Orleans in the year 1791, Louis, the wealthy owner of a plantation encounters an attractive French vampire named Lestat who understands his desire to end his miserable life after the loss of his wife. In exchange, he must become a vampire so he can live for eternity. Lestat doesn't feel any kind of remorse when he kills people including 'evil doers', unlike Louis who prefers to feed on rats and other animals instead of taking lives. Things take a different turn when he finds Claudia and accidentally feeds on her which causes his maker to turn this young girl into one of their kind and keep her as their loving daughter. The tormenting questions that Louis and Claudia have always been asking during these long years are: what is the cause of their nature? Why can't they change as the years progress? All these seem to bother and anger Lestat who withholds information from them, which prompts Claudia to plot his death so she and Louis can escape and find other vampires in Europe and other parts of the world. Neil Jordan and Anne Rice deserved so much credit for presenting this great novel to the big screen, as well as Tom Cruise, Kirsten Dunst, Antonio Banderas and Stephen Rea for their outstanding performances which were set in San Francisco, New Orleans and Paris.",10,1,2,31 October 2005
Born on the Fourth of July," Happy Birthday and Happy Fourth of July!
","First, Happy Fourth of July to everybody! Second, this movie is probably the best thing Oliver Stone ever directed along with the amazing collaboration of Vietnam veteran and anti-war activist Ron Kovic and super star Tom Cruise. Born on the Fourth of July is a documentation of the horrors of the Vietnam war and its impact on the American society throughout the 60s and 70s when Communism was perceived as a threat to liberty. Ron Kovic was a naive and patriotic young man whose devotion to his country caused him to pay a heavy price after being paralyzed for life, he eventually began to fight against the government that betrayed him and his fellow soldiers into going to Vietnam. Tom Cruise's performance was brilliant and he was able to reflect Kovic's anguish and pain as a paraplegic. He should've won an Academy Award for his role.",10,2,5,4 July 2012
