Hereditary," Pleasseeeeeee.... NO WAY! there are way better movies than this. Not as per the Hype!
",No way! this movie is nothing like the hype was about. Not scary at all. In fact it feels like the writers got confused. They themselves didnt know what they started with and what they have ended with that it doest make sense at all.So the tag line says 'Evil runs in the family' **SPOILERS**Are the creators of this movie trying to say that mental illness is evil??? :0 thats just crazy...and then from being so called mentally ill the family ends up being into some weird hell angels raising cult!!! what????? what is happening?? to make it worse specially in the scene where the mother is pleading the father to burn the book... the overacting was just annoying. The amount of times she said 'please' was at one time I went during that tirade of 'please..' saying 'Pleaseeee can you stop saying that word Please!' it was just soo annoying. and then the end... ........ I have no words!,1,10,22,12 June 2018
