Hereditary," Unconventional Horror
","Unlike typical horror film which got these following receipe:
1. Silent and boo. This film creeps you out deeply, crawling into your brain and emotion through great acting from the cast.
2. You never know what you goin to get (if you never read the synopsis), the drama starts in begining of the film, slowly pulls you into unexpected mystery and horrors, that's mind blowing.",8,1,2,2 September 2018
Captain Marvel," Watch It Only You Feel Can't Miss A Single Marvel Film
","Yes.. My tittle says all. The production might doing their best to become another successful female superhero figure that surpass Wonder Woman, but obviously they'd failed. The movie is only about introducing an important character (which claimed to be main key connecting Advengers franchise and its next installment, Endgame) in the most uninteresting storyline. That's all.",1,37,62,10 March 2019
