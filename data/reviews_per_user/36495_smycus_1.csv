Hereditary," Looking for a good horror? Look elsewhere...
","Please excuse possible linguistic imperfections but English is not my mother tongue.When it comes to the movie -it doesn't deserve 1-star rating. Come on, 1-star reviewers - how many movies have you watched during your lifetime to state 'it's the worst movie ever!'
But I understand utmost disappointment when over-inflated expectations (all this hype and stupendous, favourable reviews) eventually met reality (the final product).
After reading some enthusiastic press reviews I was really looking forward to see this one; I did love to love this movie which meant to be really scary, with a proper horror mood and all. Alas, that is not the case! By the way - I would like to know the detailed diet of those comparing this one to The Exorcist!Back to the movie: one thing is sure - it is not another one cheap, asinine movie; I find production way above average; acting and directing is generally OK - but why Gabriel Byrne decided to star here remains a real mystery! I am not going to dwell upon some plot absurdities (a gruesome accident and no police involved/the drugged, the unconscious son driven home instead of being taken to hospital) because first of all others have already focused on them and secondly I think that so-called horror genre does not have to strictly follow a plain logical path and not everything need to be explained.But I do expect horror - as the movie claims to be - to give me at least occasional shivers. 
Hereditary starts as a drama and for the 3/4 of its running time it achieves this. If it went this way I'm sure it could have been a quite good drama... but then somebody realised: 'Hey, we're shooting a horror movie; let's use some blood and stuff!' The final half an hour seems to me to be rushed to say the least. And the final scene when the demon in the body of the son looks around there is no sign of its victory, it looks bewildered - as if it wants to ask: 'Hmmm... what a bunch of losers are all around me! What have I done?'",4,0,1,25 August 2018
