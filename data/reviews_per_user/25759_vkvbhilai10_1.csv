Men in Black 3," Good but not a money worth.
","Had a taste of fresh Mib 3 today.After a gap of almost 10 years this seemed to be a new start. Starting of the movie was good with Boris escaping...but then in first half the movie out to be slow uninteresting,unrelated to the original flow of the movie,though there were many comic sequences with could keep me seated .Both Will and Tommy discover there roles as they they go more into there past.All have done a nice job in the movie. Coming to the second half the movie went out fast and more action filled the thrill in the audiences.The concept of Apollo mission was good,though seemed somewhat foolish.The second most important thing was what agent j discovers his crux in his childhood and how the agent k was helpful to him.The whole outcome is that this movie is a onetime watch",8,10,20,25 May 2012
