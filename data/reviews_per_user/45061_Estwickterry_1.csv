Iron Man 3," Should have walked out!
","*******Spoiler Alert***********I voted this movie a 5 of out 10, but to be clear, for Iron Man/Comics fans this movie should be rated a fat -5. It was a good movie if you was non comic fan, female, or a studio that made millions. Iron Man 3 had that unnecessary movie type of suspense that's found in a soap or twilight film. Know matter the type of movie you watch, the audience always know the major character will thrive victorious; its how they thrive victorious that will make the movie clever or a waste of time.So lets step inside Iron Man 3. We all know Iron Man will win. Its just that simple. We even know Iron Man will win before the movie comes on. So Why So Much Unnecessary Suspense??? Why so much double back tracking, tricking, and unglorified mishaps?? The fact that Iron Man blasted his home address live on air and wasn't prepared for an attack blows my mind away. The fact that his his drone robots are can be choppedable into pieces is beyond my comprehension.The fact that the war machine was able to be compromised by someone who took 15 years to develop his evil bio plan, with help from an old Tony fling that was amazed at his drunken intelligence make my bows bubble and run.The fact tony crashed landed and found shelter in a working garage but Invented a hot glove, made me want to head butt a cactus with my balls. The fact that the great Iron Man was saved by his girlfriend, not once but twice, by saving day at the end of the movie made me want to staple my nipples to my sack and do sit-ups.All of these moments are unnecessary suspenseful with the resolution for a wimp. Iron Man fans are trying to see Iron Man test the limits of his genesis and blast the leaving chap out of someone,talk some trash, drive a hot car, all mixed in with some figures that you keep guessing what next. Its Just That Simple. Someone kick that studio in the nuts for me!",5,4,8,5 May 2013
