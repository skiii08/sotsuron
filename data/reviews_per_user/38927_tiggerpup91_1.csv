Pirates of the Caribbean: On Stranger Tides," A Fun-Filled Adventure!
","Johnny Depp hasn't lost a bit of his pirate charm in this newest installment in the Pirates franchise. I'll admit, I went into the movie with my doubts- I didn't think the movie would be half as good as the first, or even the second or third. However, those doubts were quickly and utterly washed away. So let me assure you, the movie is well worth the watch- it's filled with action-packed, fun and sometimes hilarious fight sequences, witty dialogue and wonderful, new characters. This is one Pirate movie you don't want to miss out on.I'll stay spoiler-free, but go a bit more in-depth about the movie. Once more, Captain Jack Sparrow is wrapped around and involved in another mysterious and adventurous plot, and the fun is only just beginning. I watched it with a friend, and we found ourselves laughing, cheering, gasping in fear and surprise, and overall enjoying the movie by every second. If you enjoyed the charm, spirit, and the essence of fun and adventure from the first three movies, you'll love this return to the world of pirates just as much, if not more than, the previous installments. One of the best parts of the movie was the acting. The two new main actors we see, playing alongside Captain Sparrow, didn't feel out of place at all- they held their own as solid, 3- dimensional characters and even challenged Johnny Depp for the limelight. We also get to move along the plot with a few secondary characters that were, in my opinion, just as wonderful and deep as the main ones were. Overall, I rate this film as high as I possibly can. The score was brilliant- Hans Zimmer wows us again with his unbelievable talent- the acting was flawless, and the fun never stopped. I was even impressed with the fight-scene choreography. It challenges even the first movie in regards to which movie would be my favorite. If you're looking for a fun adventure (without the complicatedness of the trilogy-interwoven-multiple-plots from the first three), sailing the high seas with pirates and the always clever and charming Captain Jack Sparrow, definitely take your friends and family to go see this movie.P.S. As far as appropriateness for children goes, I'd be okay with going to take the 12-year old I babysit with me to see it, as there isn't really any extreme sexual or vulgar references, and the language is surprisingly kept to a minimum (with a few scattered exceptions). However, the fight sequences and sometimes bloody/graphic moments, while exciting and fun, may be too scary for the younger children. So take caution when bringing the little ones along for the show.",10,1,2,1 June 2011
