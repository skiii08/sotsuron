Mission: Impossible III," decent...
","I must say I think DePalma's version was clever and fun to weave through, while this one focuses more on Hunt's running abilities. Tom Cruise gives us lots of 'intense' looks while breathing as hard as possible. It's like they shoulda campaigned for Michael Mann to direct so everything could break off in pieces and randomly explode. The plot is just average and lacks the initial wow factor of the first. Phillip Seymore Hoffman does what he can do with the shallow screenplay and acts his ass off as usual. The action is definitely up to par with the summer kick, and pulls no punches in how far it goes. There are a couple cool gadgets throughout, and not to mention missile throwing helicopters. With it's fun it compromises some key elements to a good movie. Tom cruise does his best to over act Ethan Hunt's character. The plot was so thin, i could slice through it with a butter knife.and The 'twists' are easy and predictable. It just doesn't have that classy spy-thriller feel that the first M:I: had. It's like they dumbed down for the audience. We never find out what the 'rabbit's foot' does or is, only left to assume. Don't get me wrong, this is a fun and semi-engaging movie. It just doesn't live up to the hype it was given or the rating is sustains on IMDb. When I think of Mission Impossible, I think classy and mentally engaging (of course totally disregarding M:I: 2) and this just doesn't stay close. I'd make this comment more witty and interesting except I'm tired and watching Family Guy. 6/10.",6,1,2,21 May 2006
The Hills Have Eyes," Wes Craven should bow his head.
","Wes how are you going to let Aja outshine you my friend? This movie definitely stands it's ground as one of the best horror movie this year. I left the theater still in awe in how sinfully satisfied every drop of blood and senseless massacre made me. It is no secret to those who know me, I reek of horror movie fanaticism and leap at every attempt to see a good one (though few they may be). Not only did this version of Wes Craven's cult classic surpass the gritty feel and hell-like conditions of the original, but the acting was superior and the gore was laid on you like a Hilary Clinton speech. By that of course I mean full force, never knowing which way its going, Switching its mind regularly, and playing the louder of the two in question. With that said, This movie does have it's flaws. The deformed nuclear mutants with super strength was a bit far fetched at times, and at one point at the beginning almost reminded me of al gore after being mauled by a the ever gruesome global warming. Yet, it is not bad enough to give this movie any lower than a 7/10.",Null,0,1,17 May 2006
War of the Worlds," Breathtakingly terrible.
","I would say 'War of the Worlds' is the worst Steven Spielberg movie ever pushed to eyes of innocent humans, but I forgot that the aliens were offended as well. How can you guys really justify giving this heap of trash anywhere CLOSE to a 7? I forget how many dumb people truly exist until I read some of these reviews and look at some of the 'weighted' scores. Yes, I'll admit that making the camera run away from the special effects with Tom Cruise and his downright annoying family was a good idea....it just really missed it's point. H.G. Wells novel was focused on scientific ideas as well as theology and the attempted destruction of mankind. It was only focused on the protagonist as a sense to get you involved in the mayhem. Therefore, Spielberg's vision of running away from the whole point of the film....DEFEATS THE PURPOSE not to mention is just straight-up annoying having every scene a close-up of Tom Cruise looking like a convicted child molestor on his way to prison. I mean come on, this movie just misses every single point it tries so hard to hit. I truly wished Dakota Fanning would get snatched up by an alien and her punk brother smacked around by Tom cruise, yet it does not happen. Okay I'm done man, you people make up your own minds, but don't come crying to me when people don't remember the garbage that is 'War of the Worlds'.",2,0,1,17 May 2006
Donnie Darko," Does this really deserve a top 100 list?
","Let me start by reminding my readers Donnie Darko is not a bad movie. Jake gyleminahalfardein or whatever does an exceptional job as the weirded out high schooler with evil bunny vision and supersonic god hearing. The movie is set-up nicely and paced right on time. The idea, though not concrete is original and intriguing and is a potential conversation storm. Thus, I cannot give 'Donnie Darko' any less than a 7/10, but it's flaws detract from its success. When I watch a movie, I need to have images and themes bootprinted in my brain like jackie chan just kicked my ass....brain or something like that....anyways, one reason this movie failed to be great is it tries to be classic. They try to inject Donnie with super smart intelligence and emotional anti-social speeches which just don't move me in the slightest. I wasn't even nudged by his 'gripping' lunch room monologue. I don't like subplotting religion into a film like its supposed to be some sort of subliminal message only heard by listeners and then calling the bulk of said message science fiction because you add some time travel and an exploding plane. You have to give me downright explosiveness to be considered for my top 250, nevertheless my top 100. Yes, Donnie Darko is an exceptional piece of artwork. No it does not deserve to higher than Full Metal Jacket. 7/10",7,1,2,17 May 2006
