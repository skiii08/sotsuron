The Blair Witch Project," Horror at its finest
","[Editor's note: this comment contains a minor SPOILER]How many times have you heard a noise in the middle of the night and shivered in your bed? The fear of the unknown source of the noise chills your blood. That fear of the unknown is what makes The Blair Witch Project one of the greatest horror films.Only using a camcorder and a black and white 16mm held by the actors themselves, the film's subjective cinemtography heightens the atmosphere of fear. Many scenes at night nothing is visible but darkness. The soundtrack is filled with noises but the camera keeps jerking around; you can not find its source.The scene inside the house ( I won't say what happens there ) was filmed ingeniusly (if done on purpose). One character holds the camcorder, the only piece of equipment capable of recording sound, while the other has the 16mm which has no sound recording device. As the one with the camcorder runs down the stairs, the audience can only see what the 16mm sees as it is trying to follow the other person. The screams of the person with the 16mm can only be heard as distant screams through the camcorder's microphone. So the descent down the stairs has an eiry detachment that works extremely well.The Blair Witch Project shows that multi-million dollar budgets are not neccesary to make high quality films...",10,1,2,2 August 1999
Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," Better than Platoon? Gone With the Wind? I think not...
",Some movies have great dialogue. Others have well developed characters. This movie had neither. Actually this film had nothing but amazing special effects. I am a Star Wars fan; I have seen the original triology many times and still love them all. But Phantom Menace has nothing that the original movies had. There are no stunning characters to follow (I still believe that Han Solo is one of the most important male characters in movie history). The plot is weak and scattered. The dialogue is banal and empty. Lucas should have just made a cast of computer animations and nothing would have been lost.,1,2,4,25 May 1999
Chinatown," One of the Best of All Time
","Chinatown is a movie that combines a superb script with flawless directing. Robert Towne's script is probably the best script of all time. It encompasses all the elements of classical film noirs and uses them to tell a perfect story. The clues are fed to the audience slowly, but carefully. As Jake Gittes discovers more and more of the twisted plot revolving around the death of Mr. Mulwray, a world of disgusting corruption is found. Towne's script is reinforced by two of the greates performances of all time: Faye Dunaway and Jack Nicholson. Dunaway is the perfect femme fatale; she pulls Jake into a case that is bigger than he can handle. Nicholson plays a more thoughtful character than his usual roles. The most interesting part of the Gittes character is his vulnerability. Nicholson's nose is covered with bandages for a good part of the film to reinforce the fact that Gittes is not super-human; he will not and can not solve this case in time to save Dunaway.Finally, Roman Polanski's direction is amazing in Chinatown. His camera is a voyeur in the film. It follows just over Nicholson's shoulder, it is right next to Dunaway's face (which from interviews, I hear really disturbed her and created friction between she and Polanski), and it surveys the young L.A. landscape revealing its superficial beauty. Polanski wonderfully contrasts this beautiful image of early L.A. and the corruption underlying the plot. On the one hand we see the desert and all its stark beauty. But in another scene, the camera is dodging punches or trying to get away from Claude Mulvhill. This move definetely signified a peek in Polanski's career. It is unfortunate that events in his personal life has made him an outcast in America, he truly had a great eye as a director.",10,1,2,2 June 1999
2001: A Space Odyssey," Greatest Movie of All Time
","Instead of writing a paragraph, I'll give four good reasons why 2001 is  the greatest cinema experience of all time:  1) It is a visual Odyssey that could only be told on the big screen.  The special effects that won Kubrick his only Oscar are the most  stunning effects before that age of Jurassic Park and T2. They allow  Kubrick to give an accurate (or at least are the most accurate)  depiction of space travel to date. The silence that fills the space  scenes not only serves its purpose as accurate science, but also adds  to the mood of the film (to be discussed in a later point with HAL).  The fact that Kubrick shot the moon scenes before the Apollo landing is  a gutsy yet fulfilling move. Many have said that upon its original  release, it was a favorite 'trip' movie. I can think of no other movie  that has such amazing visuals for its time and even of all time (sorry  Phantom Menace fans!)  2) Kubrick's directing style is terrific. As in all his films, Kubrick  likes to use his camera as means to delve into the psychology of his  characters and plots. His camera is not as mobile as other greats, such  as Scorsese, but instead sits and watches the narrative unfold. Faces  are the key element of a Kubrick film. Like classic movies, such as M  and Touch of Evil, Kubrick focuses on the characters' faces to give the  audience a psychological view-point. Even he uses extreme close-ups of  HAL's glowing red 'eye' to show the coldness and determination of the  computerizd villain. I could go on, but in summation Kubrick is at the  hieght of his style.  3) HAL 9000 is one of the most villainous characters in film history. I  whole-heartedly agree with the late Gene Siskle's opinion of HAL 9000.  Most of this film takes place in space. Through the use of silence and  the darkness of space itself, a mood of isolation is created. Dave and  his crewmen are isolated between earth and jupiter, with nowhere to  escape. Combine this mood with the cold, calculated actions of HAL 9000  and you have the most fearful villain imaginable. I still, although  having see this film several times, feel my chest tighten in a  particular scene.  4) The controversial  ending of 2001 always turns people away from this film. Instead of  trying to give my opinion of the what it means and what my idea of  2001's meaning in general is, I'd like to discuss the fact that the  ending serves to leave the movie open-ended. Kubrick has stated that he  inteded to make 2001 open for discussion. He left its meaning in the  hands of the viewer. By respecting the audience's intelligence, Kubrick  allowed his movie to be the beginning, not the end, of a meaningful  discussion on man's past, present, and future. The beauty of 2001 is  that the ending need not mean anything deep, it can just be a purely  plot driven explanation and the entire movie can be viewed as an  entertaining journey through space. No other movie, save the great  Citizen Kane, leaves itself open to discussion like 2001. It is truly  meant to be a surreal journey that involves not only the eye but the  mind. Instead of waiting in long lines for the Phantom Menace, rent a  widescreen edition of 2001 and enjoy the greatest cinematic experience.",10,922,1418,3 June 1999
Eyes Wide Shut," Sureal Dream...A great finale by Kubrick
","Eyes Wide Shut will imediately alienate or entice its viewers. Walking out of the theatre, there were many people commenting on how bad it was. For a person looking for a porn film, I guess Eyes Wide Shut had too much plot and too little sex. For a person looking for an erotic thriller, I guess Eyes Wide Shut had too many open-ended questions and too few climatic scenes filled with answers. But for a person looking for a peek into the mind, into that Freudian unconscious, Eyes Wide Shut had plenty of images to contemplate.First of all, like all of Kubrick's films, Eyes Wide Shut is about images, visuals. Durring Cruise's 'night on the town' Kubrick's grainy film mixed with his extensive backlighting creates a dream-like state. The camera is slow and methodic. It shows us all we need to see in this urban dreamscape (minus those pesky digital images!). Because thats what Eyes Wide Shut is: a tour of the human dreamscape, or at least the seedier side of it.The plot moves slowly not concerned that it has left some questions unanswered, because this isn't a film about answers. Here we see another Kubrick signature, the open-ended ending. When those credits role, you'll probably still have questions or maybe you'll want to know what just hit you. Where did Kubrick just take you? What did you just see? I must say that one viewing, which is all that I have had, is insufficient to answer those questions completely.Eyes Wide Shut is an excellent movie that makes you think. Not like The Usual Suspects, but like Persona or 2001 or Blue Velvet, another dream caught up in dreams. It doesn't keep you guessing, it keeps you thinking...well after the credits role. One thing is clear though, this is a must see finale to a wonderful career.",10,0,0,16 July 1999
The Matrix," good effects, good idea...bad execution
","This movie would be good if the director kept the special effects and then fired all the actors and rewrote the script.  The idea of The Matrix is amazing.  When I realized what the Matrix was, I was interested. Unfortunately, the script didn't allow me to care enough about the rest of the narrative.  If the characters were less cartoon-like and I was made to feel any sympathy towards them, maybe the film would work.  Go see The Matrix for the special effects but don't pay attention to the narrative, or you will be disappointed. (3 out of 10)",3,3,8,6 April 1999
