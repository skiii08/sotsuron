It," A truly great scary movie. But not for all.
","'IT' was so well put together fro many reasons. The first thing I noticed about the movie was the character development. Sometimes movie skip that and you feel nothing for the characters when something happened. The on screen chemistry between the actors made the movie amazing. The real trust that the actors had with each other could not be faked and be believable. Without that 'IT' wouldn't be nearly as great as it is. The cinematography is one of the major factors that made the movie great. The camera angles changed and never failed to impress me, they used them as ways to make the movie interesting and keep your attention. One of the main factors that made the movie amazing was the amount of fear and scare they added. Some movies jump in with jump scares and do it so the audience doesn't get bored. During this movie, I was never once uncomfortable because they knew when to stop. each and every scary seen was nearly perfectly executed. They used humor in the scariest scenes to lighten the mood and make you forget why you were scared. I went with two friends to see this movie, they were both expecting a jump scare movie. I talked to them after and they said they didn't like how long it took to get to the scary parts. That's what made the movie amazing, I felt for the characters when their fears came to them. I knew their kind of humor. I don't think I have been this obsessed with a movie in a long time.",9,5,11,11 September 2017
