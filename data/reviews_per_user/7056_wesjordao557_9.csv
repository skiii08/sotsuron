Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," Lives up to the trilogy!
","This was a great Star Wars movie. I love all four of them. Alot of people say this wasn't good, because of Jar Jar Binks. I don't see how he was SO annoying. The charecters were good, the story was good, and the acting, was good. Liam Neeson was a great actor, and Ray Park did great as Darth Maul. Ewan McGregor didn't do that great. But episode 2 looks like he does better acting.Well, I can't wait for Episode 2 to be released this May. I bet it's going to be better!",Null,0,1,9 April 2002
Star Wars: Episode VI - Return of the Jedi," Great Ending To The Star Wars Saga
","This is a great ending for Star Wars. I've seen all the original movie and the two new ones, and when you think about it, it ends great. And it brings a little tear to your eye once Vader sacrafices his life for his son. And when you see all the planets (Corasunt, Tatooine, Cloud City, Endor) celebrateing at the end, and then Obi-Wan, Anakin and Yoda watching Luke and everyone celebrating. It's great.
And George, if you ever read this, I think it would be a great idea if you add Liam Neeson and Samual L. Jackson standing beside Yoda, Obi-Wan and Anakin at the end.",Null,0,0,5 July 2002
Star Wars: Episode II - Attack of the Clones," Yoda Kicks Ass!!!!!!!!!!!!
","First off, If you liked the original Trilogy, than you got to see this. When you watch Episode 2, it feels like the orignal movies. Episode 1 (in my opinion was good, but I usualy like sequals/prequals). Anyways, like I said Episode 2 does feel a lot like the original trilogy. Great story, the action, great effects, great acting, except for Hayden Christensen. He's ok but not great.And you must watch the lightsaber fight at the end when Yoda kicks some heavy ass! That scene is going to become a CLASSIC!",10,0,0,17 May 2002
The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring," Best Movie Of 2001
","This was a great movie. I loved it. The story was great, the action was great, the charecters were great, and even the acting was great. Lord Of The Rings is my 2nd favorite movie. Star Wars is my 1st. I can't wait when Star Wars Episode 2 and The Two Towers come out this year!",10,1,1,14 March 2002
Spider-Man," Superman, Batman, Blade, X-Men..... and now.... SPIDER-MAN!
","Superman was the first and started it all with the comic book movies. It was great at it's time and is now a classic. Later on came Batman another amazing classic. As time went on, we saw other comic book movies such as Ninja Turtles, The Mask, and Men In Black. We later recieved Blade, which started Marvels big movie debut. Than came a bigger movie, X-Men. Now, we finnaly recieve Spider-Man.I can say that Spider-Man is an awsome movie! It's the best comic book movie ever. It stays true to the charecter. Before the movie came out, I was having alot of doubts. I was hoping the movie would be great... and it was. It has everything for everyone. Drama, romance, comedy, and of course, action!This is a movie for everyone, young and old. 10 out of 10.",10,0,0,4 May 2002
Titanic," The Worst Movie Ever Made
","What was James Cameron thinking? How did this get 11 Acadamy Awards? And why? Why did they pick that geek, Leonardo DiCaprio. He was an awful actor. He couldn't act great even if his life depended on it.I do have to admit, the only part was cool is when the ship crashed and started to sink. That was awsome. But other than that.... it SUCKED.If there is a guy out there that likes this, you are GAY!",Null,1,4,21 April 2002
Space Jam," Not Looney Tunes Style, But Still Good!
","This movie is not classic Looney Tunes funny, but it's still pretty good. The characters are fun watching together in one movie, and it's kind of cool that they finally get a feature length movie. The Looney Tunes have always been my favorite cartoons (I'm 19 now). Bugs and Daffy will always be my favorite. I guess I liked it because I'm a big Looney Tune fan. So, for anyone, big or small, watch it.",10,3,4,25 February 2002
Star Wars: Episode IV - A New Hope," Star Wars: The Start Of A Great Saga
","This is now called Star Wars Episode 4: A New Hope because of the prequal movies. I think it's a fun and great movie. All the Star Wars films are grat in my opinion. a lot people say Episode 1 sucked and some people say Episode 2 was ok... but to me they are just as good as the original. They are conecting great, and that's what I suspect them to do.Anyways, the original will always be great to everyone. Just like Lord Of The Rings and Spider-Man. This is the best movie ever!",Null,0,0,8 June 2002
Star Wars: Episode V - The Empire Strikes Back," Another Great Star Wars Film
","The Empire Strikes Back is another great Star Wars movie. It has great action, great story, and more. It's great to see Harrison Ford (one of my favorite actors) in a great movie.This is also the first appearence of Yoda, the master of all Jedi's. If you seen Attack Of The Clones, you'll agree with me.The only problem I have with people is, this movie has some romance scenes, just like Attack Of The Clones. So why are some people complaining about Episode 2? Because they have problems!!!!!!!!",Null,0,0,7 July 2002
