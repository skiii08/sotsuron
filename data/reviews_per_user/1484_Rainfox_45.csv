The Devil's Advocate," Carrying bricks
","* * ½ (2½ out of 5)The Devil's AdvocateDirected by: Taylor Hackford, 1997
`Guilt is like carrying a f**kin bag of bricks. Put it down.' - Al Pacino, as the devil.
Spiritual and gothic thriller that amidst blinding performances still suffers from familiarity. The apparatus of the script is weak, so the viewer is constantly one step ahead of the main character of Kevin Lomax (Keanu Reeves), and his dance with the devil. 
Charlize Theron is wonderfully headstrong and focused as Lomax's wife, while Connie Nielsen is sexy, sophisticated and breezy as the office vamp. Of course, the agenda in The Devil's Advocate is clearly Al Pacino. By getting him to play the devil, the moviemakers were halfway home already.
Pacino was made for the role and he knows it. He's all over the place. With him, it's always a pleasure. He's cocky, provocative and dangerously seductive. The dialogue is chewable, and Pacino relishes in it, his eyes widening and his cheeky smiles going ear to ear. 
The moral reasoning is even reflective and The Devil's Advocate is also at times an entertaining subversive comedy, but this mix of Rosemary's Baby and The Firm sorely lacks any real sense of surprise.",Null,0,0,27 May 2000
The Blair Witch Project," Hype backlash bigtime

The Blair Witch ProjectDirected By : Daniel Myrick, Eduardo Sanchez (II), 1999Hype backlash bigtime
Tremendously over-hyped horror hit (grossed over $130 million in US) that collapses under it's own weight regardless.Three kids, two cameras (a handheld and a 16mm) and an investigation into the cold, rainy woods of Washington searching for witches and superstition make out The Blair Witch Project. The `documentary' is presented throughout as a true story and was even preceded by much internet and word-of-mouth hype as to whether or not it was a true story. Of course it is only a movie.
Very repetitive (day, night, day, night) and be advised to leave most of your logic at home (No mobile phone? One compass only? One map only? No clue as to sun-reading at all?). Thank you.However; the premise was intriguing. The back-to-basics approach of filmmaking, the superb acting (mostly ad-libbed) and the desolate scenery make for an interesting experience. The intimacy and anxiety is enhanced by the great performances of Heather Donahue, Michael Williams and Joshua Leonard. It would have been interesting to observe (or be) one of the few who viewed this just when it was taking off, because frankly I wasn't convinced at all.
Nevertheless, viewing Blair Witch in a packed cinema a few days after opening night, where 90% of the crowd consisted of teenagers, I made an interesting observation. The last horror film that most of these kids saw was probably in the vein of  'I Know What Jason and Freddie Did Last Spring'. So naturally, they wanted gore! Or did they? Some made remarks during the movie ('Is this it?' 'When does it start?' 'Alright with all that name calling!').? Maybe they had just heard that this was the movie that had fooled everyone across the sea and that it was genuinely scary and tested new ground. If that is the approach, then be prepared to be hugely disappointed. Sure, I was annoyed at these spoiled and  'illiterate' (pun intended) MTV-generation youths, that had apparently been feeding on junk-and-dollar horror for too long. At the same time  however - their reaction is somewhat understandable. The hoax was part of the package. Kind of like de-masking Jason.  State of the art special effects may show him to be ugly as nothing you've ever seen, but he looked so much more frightening with his hockey mask on. He was MUCH more terrifying when shrouded in mystery. This is the trick and trap that Blair Witch reminds us of, and ultimately falls for itself. Kapow. The Blair Witch Project is a small movie celebrating it's own originality and thereby to an extent forgetting the initial task. Which is to scare! Yet it is somewhat charming and most importantly solid proof of how spoiled and unimaginative many have become when watching horror.
Note : The last ten minutes should keep you on needles though. And the ending is brilliant.",Null,0,0,6 December 1999
Alien 3," Been there, done that
","* * (2 out of 5)Alien3Directed by : David Fincher, 1992
If you liked Aliens, it is probably best you don't see Alien3. It, for some reason, turns the triumph of Aliens and the conclusion herein into a depression deeper than the vastness of a hundred black holes.First off, the characters of Hicks, Newt and Bishop - who went through such a terrible ordeal in Aliens - are mysteriously dead as this one opens and obviously not due to anything terribly story related. Other than that, director Fincher (of former MTV fame) dishes up a stylized alien universe and his camera style  more close-ups and more zoom shots  is easily different from both Ridley Scott (Alien) and James Cameron (Aliens). Where Fincher is an original artiste this also quickly becomes annoying when any real suspense is missing (there is a lone alien running around again), the story is a no-story and when no characters (other than Ripley) are even vaguely interesting. Ellen Ripley is joined by one, big, faceless mob.Alien3 has moments; yet everything ultimately seems like a huge deja-vu. Charles Dance and Sigourney Weaver even share some interesting chemistry (that should have been further built on) - that too fizzles.
Weaver co-produced this time, she also shaved her head (literally) and if nothing else Alien3 has a magnificent scene where Ripley - at last - comes face to face with an alien. We are talking inches.Note : The ending was one move that Warner wish they had never done. See Alien : Resurrection.",Null,499,547,6 February 2000

Raiders Of The Lost Ark
Directed by: Steven Spielberg, 1981
George Lucas wrote and Steven Spielberg directed. There you go.
Raiders is a groundbreaking, exhilarating and rugged action-adventure, that literally set a new standard at the time, while it also payed homage to the old time swashbuckling Hollywood movies in grand style.
Filled with wit throughout, a great story, some unbelievable and awe-inspiring stunt work, a wonderful and inspired cast lead by Harrison Ford, Karen Allen and Paul Freeman, and Raiders is as good as it can possibly get. From camera work to dialogue, from backdrop use to editing, from coloring to effects, this is truly inspired entertainment.
Ford totally embodies the role of Indiana Jones with his charming never-say-die attitude, bull-whip and omnipresent fedora hat (he did most of the stunt work himself too), and it is important to state that the movie would have suffered immensely had Ford not been chosen (Tom Selleck was originally cast).
Also; check out the fluidity and ease with which Spielberg directs. Amazing.

Fight Club
Directed by: David Fincher, 1999
A surprising, glamorized and visceral pop-culture feast by David Fincher (Alien3, Se7en, The Game) based on the writings of Chuck Palahniuk. Alternative only in style (Fincher all the way), Fight Club is really just another coming-of-age movie along the lines of American Beauty (1999).
While it's sensibilities are none too deep there's still plenty too get excited about. Both Brad Pitt and Edward Norton deliver some pounding performances and Helen Bonham Carter is a slick cartoon slut come to life. Fincher's visual style leaves you pinned in your seat - he simply rubs you raw -  and Fight Club screams for repeat viewing to catch the subtleties and re-experience the plot twists.The funny - and true - thing about Fight Club is that it actually works and comes full circle against impossible odds.Criticized for almost everything when it was released; the whiny and infantile philosophizing (courtesy of the narrator and the machine-gun pep-talks by Pitt), the hefty blood n' guts routines of the bare-knuckle brawls, the general gung-ho testosterone filled outlook on life and the fact that it offers no answers to the muddled ideology it preaches, Fight Club got as much of a rough beating in the press as it served up itself.
But the issues in Fight Club - primarily the sheer desperation of the shuttering male angst - can never be deemed vacuous because they are genuine signs of our times and to depict them this colorfully and with this much energy, anger and invention is frankly entertaining as hell.",Null,0,1,21 September 2001

As Good As It Gets
Directed by: Albert Brooks, 1998
A contrived feel-good vehicle obtains a life of its own by way of some outstanding performances. Helen Hunt is touching, tough and obscenely huggable as the down-and-out New York waitress who gets a helping hand from a seriously disturbed and obsessive-compulsive regular customer (Jack Nicholsen). Hollywood's favorite freak, Nicholsen, is on a delightful eyebrow-arching rampage in this standard romantic comedy by Albert Brooks (Terms of Endearment, Broadcast News). His performance may well be his best to date. The movie is not. Lacking both depth and needed working class feel, its low points are when Brooks lets the sappiness take control (Harold Ramis as a cartoonish Dr. Feelgood).
However: As Good As It Gets wants you to believe that there's an innocent charm to life, and by staying slow-burning conservative and soberly delivering the goods, this is actually achieved. Amusing and sweet fun.",Null,0,0,27 May 2000

The 13th Warrior," Inconclusive journey to Valhalla
","* * (2 out of 5)   The 13th Warrior
Directed by: John McTiernan
Intriguing but fragmented and limp adventure tale that suffers from post-production re-shoots and incoherent editing. A mixture of sword and sorcery (Conan, Excalibur) yet appealingly featuring  the same monumental, raw and ragged surge also present in Jean-Jacques Annaud's classic Quest for Fire. Based on Michael Crichton's 1976 novel Eaters of the Dead (from the Scandinavian tale of Beowulf). Thirteen Viking warriors set off to fight a rival tribe in 1000 AD northern Europe, only to encounter remnants of a vicious Neanderthal clan. 
Director McTiernan and writer Crichton disagreed on the final cut and it shows. There's a misplaced romantic opening (featuring Omar Shariff) and a disappointing rushed ending. 
Other than that, there's quite a lot to get excited about; McTiernan infuses a nice, honest and unself-conscious atmosphere and he makes his characters believable with just the bare essentials of dialogue. Audacious performances by most of the cast. Great sets and scenery, dark and fascinating   battle scenes and astonishing outdoor cinematography (shot in British Columbia, Canada). 
However, the make-up department should maybe have taken it easy. Why have the rugged warriors all got unblemished faces and why is Antonio Banderas wearing mascara?

"South Park: Bigger, Longer & Uncut"," Bigger, Longer, Uncut and it actually works
","* * * ½ (3½ out of 5)
South Park : Bigger, Longer and Uncut
Directed by : Trey Parker, 1999The essence of Trey Parker's South Park - the television show - is crude and foul-mouthed social commentary dressed up as an ugly drawn (low-tech paper animation) cartoon, that on a good day can be as politically sharp and relevant as it can be magnificent fun.
The show chronicles the lives and adventures of third graders Kyle, Stan, Cartman and Kenny, as they endure down the path of life towards adulthood in the small, hick town of South Park somewhere in desolate Colorado.
Obviously influenced not only by such raunchy and classic adult animation as Fritz The Cat (1972), but by more recent 90s favorites  the dead-on teenage angst and dimwitted humor of Beavis and Butthead, the charming and intelligent social satire of The Simpsons, and the subtle, white-trash, rural middle America characterizations as depicted in King Of The Hill - South Park has nevertheless clearly distinguished itself in both tone and style if not subject matter.
How? By being twice as rude, offensive, obnoxious, absurd and calculated as anything ever before.
This formula works because South Park - however repetitive it may seem with a constant cavalcade of filth, wall-to-wall-cursing and depraved acts - relentlessly keeps the punches coming and has both heart and grit enough to do so, thus ensuring that the only safe bet is that the character of Kenny will get killed sooner or later (no spoiler, a trademark). `No one here gets out alive´ seems to be the message. If Jim Morrison was alive today he would be a fan.
Amazingly, the movie too wins you over because of this general element of surprise and flow in the verbal attack, and 'Bigger, Longer and Uncut' is actually a very descriptive subtitle to the full-length movie (it runs 80 minutes). It is exactly that.
However, Parker has also built this pro-longed edition more in the veins of a musical than a regular episode thereby making everything seem very fresh and initially different. Fans may be annoyed at the many musical moments (some are more entertaining than others) but it makes for a nice pacing and an appropriate abrasive feel (as South Park should be).
The good song and dance routines are superbly written and robustly crafted in the best of musical traditions. I will be the first to admit that they had me singing along more than once. Blatantly humming something like: 'Shut your f**king face, uncle f**ker' - as the four kids do after having seen their heroes Terrance and Phillip's R-rated film, 'Asses On Fire' - whilst laughing my head off and tears rolling down my cheek, is not how I would like to be remembered. Yet it happened to me. You have to hand it to Trey Parker: South Park can be genuinely addictive.
That is because there is a much needed moral behind all the adolescent obscenity. The moral being not only anarchistic, but both intelligent and reflective. Creators Trey Parker and Matt Stone slam censorship and intolerance, and make a hard case against the lack of parental guidance - in general, not only at the movies. Kids nowadays in America are not necessarily victims of any sleazy outside influence or a decaying society, but namely of a lack of communication with their parents. An issue that can not get enough of a forward push in the United States today.
On the downside; some parts of the movie work better than others. For instance, I never took to the Saddam Hussein and Satan relationship. It carries on too long and is unfortunately at center throughout. There is also mock genitalia shown simply to shock - and that is beneath even South Park.On the upside however, other vulgarities, like the ethnic stereotyping - a tireless joke in the world of South Park - takes on a whole new meaning towards the end of this movie (Q: Chef: 'Ain't you heard of the emancipation proclamation?' A: Army General: 'I don't listen to hip-hop'). The movie nakedly addresses cultural and racial misunderstandings, minority bashing and human shallowness in a both hilarious and sinister fashion without tooting any specific horn. Brilliant.
The experience of viewing South Park : Bigger, Longer and Uncut rests primarily on the unknown factor (as much as it is also jam-packed with inside jokes which may seem unfamiliar to many non-Americans), so I will not reveal anything more. If you can stomach the extreme vulgarity that resides in the small mountain town of South Park, Colorado, and want to be wooed by some wry and open-minded wit, then you are surely in for a joyride.
Summing up the warped but wonderful humor of South Park is best done by quoting a news reporter as heard in the movie itself :[Covering a bloody war] : 'It doesn't matter if it's loaded with violence, as long as there's no foul language, then the MPAA says it's safe for children.'",Null,0,0,12 February 2000

Alien is a scary watch for even the most convinced horror fanatic. Standard 1950s formula (with touches of Kubrick`s 2001), but done with such flair and vision that it became an instant classic. Sigourney Weaver delivers a top performance, as does John Hurt and Tom Skerritt, but the real winner is director and designer Ridley Scott who creates an environment so compelling and spellbinding it would not only spawn three sequels but be considered an institution to this very day.
The alien design was created by artist H.R. Giger and is legendary by itself.Note : The art direction, cinematography and sound editing was revolutionary, as was the camera angles and barren and bleak vision of the future. Must remember to mention that the movie boldly had a woman as the main character, another plus for this genre that only added to Alien's credibility. The movie also went against mainstream as lead characters were randomly killed, and this naturally only adding to the suspense (a technique later copied in such diverse thrillers as Shoot To Kill, 1988, and Deep Blue Sea, 1999).",Null,0,1,6 February 2000

The Godfather Part II
Directed by: Francis Ford Coppola, 1974
Stunning and utterly compelling sequel. A side story telling the saga of how the Corleone family came to America is told in conjunction with the continuous saga of new Don Michael Corleone (Al Pacino). This is done with a puppeteer's focused hand (pun intended) by co-writer/director Coppola and the result is amazing. He seems to somehow intertwine the two stories of the old and new Don effortlessly and deliver grand entertainment.
Deservedly the movie won an Oscar for Best Picture  and for a sequel that's no small feat. Robert De Niro is exquisite (watch those subtle Brando mannerisms) and under-plays elegantly as the young Vito Corleone, while Robert Duvall is brilliant once more as Tom Hagan  a voice of reason in a dark and sinister mob world.  By and large Al Pacino's film though. Michael Corleone was a great character and a great role for one of the greatest American actors of the 20th century. The new Don has become spiteful and Pacino's performance is harrowingly intense. His anger and pity comes so naturally; it's simply disturbing. Probably Pacino's finest hour.",Null,0,0,7 October 2000
The Thing," Good things come to those who wait
","* * * * ½ (4½ out of 5)
The Thing
Directed by: John Carpenter, 1982
Looking back on John Carpenter's The Thing  today a highly treasured cult favourite  one has to wonder why it was dismissed by both the audience and critics when it first came out in 1982.
Steven Spielberg's extra terrestrial adventure about a sweet alien that phoned home (that stole the hearts of both children and adults world wide) had opened just two weeks before and was on its historic box office rampage. Bad scheduling may have had a greater impact than anything else on the fate of Carpenter's first big studio effort for Universal Pictures. Nobody was prepared  moreover wanted anything so dark, gory and scary as this genuine remake of the famous 1951 original. This was the time of E.T.: The Extra-Terrestrial.
It then makes for great movie history trivia, that The Thing has gained such a remarkable afterlife on video, DVD and television. Both financially and critically. Carpenter's version is less a remake of the Howard Hawks' version than a more faithful adaptation of John W. Campbell's short story 'Who Goes There?' (on which both were based), and critics today point out how well Carpenter plays his characters against each other. Kurt Russell will never top this one, and he gets a brilliant sparring from the entire cast.
It opens in Antarctica with a sled husky running from a pair of crazed and armed Norwegian men in a helicopter. The scene is long, slow and uneasy. It feels like the Apocalypse. It oozes doomsday.
This scene comprises one of the greatest opening sequences in film history.
Ennio Morricone's moody synth score (heavy on naked thumping bass lines in classic Carpenter style), the windswept massive white of the desolate polar ice and the majestic husky running across the tundra chased by the chopper, compromises a completely mesmerizing piece of scenery.
A satisfying example of a movie that today  18 years after  looks downright muscular in its simplicity.
The budget was big ($14 mill), yet it allowed Carpenter to visualize his ideas better than ever before. There's a brooding darkness to this film, making the whites and blues of the icy Antarctic claustrophobia seem poetic and almost angelic. Dean Cundey's extraordinary photography created a palpable chill to every shot. The careful preparation (the crew went into a record 11-month pre-production) paid off immensely.
Horror specialist Rob Bottin was handpicked for the many gory and grotesque special effects. Be warned  there's a lot of splatter and gore here. The Thing is actually notorious for its creature morphing scenes. Some find them disgusting, some mere cult.An argument could be made against The Thing being an Alien rip-off; it has its origins in an old sci-fi story and it creates tension by popping a crowd of people (note: all-male) on an isolated outpost (an Antarctic research facility) terrorized by an alien life form.
Where Carpenter was clearly inspired by Ridley Scott's 1979 masterpiece, his own alien movie is original and intriguing in its own right. There's a rhythm and an environment that equals Scott's in every way.
The husky was in fact half-wolf and half-dog, and it was noted that it never barked or growled on or off the set (Horror Takes Shape, the making of - DVD version).
Watch in awe at the scene where it walks through the hallway and stares at a human shadow, slightly tilting its head forward in stalking position like a wild wolf. This is a fine piece of animal training, sure, but that's not the point. This is as spooky as anything ever made in a horror movie.
Carpenter had all the right tools here, and he utilized them to perfection, making The Thing his best movie alongside Halloween.",Null,399,448,27 May 2000
Terminator 3: Rise of the Machines," A legit blast from the past - the battle has just begun
","* * * ½ (3½ out of 5)Terminator 3: Rise of the MachinesDirected by: Jonathan Mostow, 2003Let's get right to it, shall we? Is Jonathan Mostow's Terminator 3: Rise of the Machines ('T3') bad? Is it what we feared, considering it's primarily a box office vehicle and career savior for a forgotten Arnold Schwarzenegger and completely without mastermind James Cameron's involvement? And does it seriously wrong the two previous? No. No. And no.Not at all. In fact, it's very good. Worth the wait? Yes. Would we rather have had James Cameron's vision still? Of course we would. But T3 is a legit blast from the past evident from the somber and charming opening voice-over by Nick Stahl (as John Connor, bringing us up to speed) all the way to the clever plot twist at the end. T3 holds its very own. Or as Ah-nuld's returning Terminator dryly remarks: 'I am nod shidding you.'What do we get then?We get Ah-nuld - back and ready, now 55 - slipping seamlessly (physically too) into the one role we must remember to give him credit for. As the twisted steel endoskeleton killing machine, covered in human tissue, the heavy-accented non-actor is a welcome kick in the face.
We also get a storyteller with a heart in director Mostow. Operating on a gigantic budget of $170m he wisely remembers that bigger and louder isn't necessarily better. There's a story to be told here. Maybe T3 predictably follows the traditions of the first two (time zone arrivals, introductions, a big chase and a final shootout and confrontation), but Mostow is surprisingly refined in his approach and passes the Cameron-test with ease. T3 has the same texture, the same grit and the same vacuumed atmosphere of despair, making it - okay, in its best moments - slither right in alongside its two predecessors.Sarah Connor is dead and her son and future rebel leader, John, is now a twenty-something drifter, living 'off the grid' with no address or phone. Stahl plays both to the juvenile (and, honestly, bad-acted) pop charm of Furlong from T2 and to his own (and Mostow's) idea of an older and emotionally wrecked loner. Amidst the mayhem and inferno, Stahl lends weight with a natural command of what's at stake here: the human race and the integrity of a renowned action franchise. Stahl is an absolute steal. Co-star Claire Danes even brings back fond memories (of Hamilton) from the first one.The same can unfortunately not be said of Kristanna Loken as the new villain(ness), the liquid metal T-X. Don't blame Loken - she's fine when she's on screen even though she naturally lacks some of the spine-tingling intensity of Patrick in T2 (a case of having been there, done that). It's when she morphs into computer effects there's a weird occurrence. 13 years have passed since the last time, but the liquid metal of the T-X - you'd imagine that CG has improved since then - seems strangely more stingy and effects-pasted than the fluent ooze and flubber of the old T-1000 from 1991. Also, the T-X is maybe too much to swallow as a concept: In my review of T2 I questioned the ability of the T-1000 to form human skin and clothing fabric, but here it is completely out of bounds. The T-X can form interchangeable firing weapons (rockets too) with her hands. Well, can the liquid thing - the matter - then generate new matter so that it doesn't 'shoot off' its own essence? If so, why not just change into an atomic bomb and go off?The old Terminator flicks were likewise rich on goof-holes, but this does bog T3 down. There are also too many one-liners dating back to Ah-nuld's annoying celebrity traditions, a grand helicopter crash that doesn't spark any intensity and Earl Boen shows up (out of nowhere) as Dr. Silberman purely to generate recognition other than Arnie himself. This is where T3 sticks out like a sore thumb.Luckily, there are more positives than negatives. Stan Winston's gorgeous and glittering silver cyborg designs are a welcome return in these sickening times of CG overload courtesy of over-reaching ambitions by formerly inventive filmmakers (take your pick: Spider-Man, Hulk, Matrix Reloaded, parts of the Lord of the Rings series and the Star Wars prequels). And when Arnie and the T-X slug it out in a kind of robotic martial arts slam dance (destroying an office restroom complete with urinals and toilets), it's an intoxicating blend of adrenaline, mechanical power and sexual energy. You feel the bruises and bending steel. Back to basics fist fighting, bare-bones dogme action at its finest. T3 actually seems like a throwback to the nitty-gritty cinema heyday of rugged stuntmen, breathing explosions and cool editing (a superb job by Neil Travis and Nicolas de Toth). Full of B-movie values and subtle plot-moving stopgaps but operated from a mega budget.
Sure, T3 is clouded with zippy CG effects, but the best scenes and set-pieces are for real. You may speculate just where all the money went then. Relax. That's a real street, a real area of Los Angeles, that gets demolished in the gawking crane and fire truck chase that not only bolts out as a shocking display of property damage, but as the most intense and satisfying Armageddon on wheels since William Friedkin's freeway spectacle in To Live and Die in L.A. (1985). Leaving CG-drenched stinkers like 2 Fast 2 Furious (2003) and Driven (2001) in a cloud of Judgement Day dust. The action in T3 is worth the ticket alone.But Mostow's spice of choice is subtlety and the little things add up. Arnie picks up biker gear a third time around while you smile, the technical evovlement of Cyberdyne is displayed but not pondered upon, and I did enjoy the 'heat plus sand equals glass' detail. Nice touch and a perfect example of how well-rounded this sequel was approached by the filmmakers.Mostow effectively marries old and new with a tight and thought-provoking sci-fi story. The ending is a triumph, as Mostow and writers John Brancato and Michael Ferris keep the best for last and almost caressingly open Pandora's Box. An ending for the ages, logically - not just in typical greedy Hollywood fashion - paving the way for another sequel with the actual war of man against machine.T3 is a pleasant Tinseltown surprise and a biggie with purpose. Don't be put off by a non-Cameron Terminator and shy away, or as Ah-nuld simply states in a hilarious scene: 'Don't do dat.'",Null,0,0,10 August 2003

American Beauty
Directed by: Sam Mendes, 1999Electricity in the air
'I rule,' Lester Burnham wryly remarks. Unemployed, middle-aged and traumatized by what appears to be a mid-life crisis, these are his words after having purchased the sports car of his boyhood dreams, casually sipping beer from the bottle, dressed in a sweatshirt, bare feet up on the coffee table, and provocatively addressing his bewildered wife, a wretched and cocky real-estate mogul. It's liberation, it's freedom and we  the viewers  feel it instinctively. Such is American Beauty through and through. Brimming with sardonic humor and seemingly ready to pop at any given minute. A sharp and incisive critique of modern day consumerism but also a deliriously funny and insightful 'set-piece' concerning the post-American-dream America waking up to discover that their eggs are burnt, pancakes notoriously fattening and coffee mysteriously caffeine free. Yes, I am talking in metaphors. The solution? Push the panic button and hit meltdown. American Beauty does so and with an appetite. Imagine the twisted human hollowness that was so nakedly portrayed in Happiness and so evocatively questioned in Pleasantville. Then cross it with the visual beauty and thematic sorrow of The Ice Storm by way of Spielberg's heartfelt suburban odes to underlying discontent  as glimpsed in Close Encounters of the Third Kind and ET  and you'll have an idea of both the theme and style of American Beauty.This is a debut for director Sam Mendes and an amazing achievement. The director and screenwriter have equipped Burnham with something as rare as an opening monologue  not a play-by-play but more of a fairy tale introduction  a major spoiler none the same. To top that off, the best scenes are courtesy of some splendid and intertwined dreamy passages  thick and rich on symbolism and both sexy and surreal  that blend in effortlessly. This is ambiguous and successful filmmaking containing an original cinematic spark.
So, what is wrong with Burnham? Nothing really. Life just got the best of him. His conflict could be an awakening or an emancipation just as well as any classic midlife crisis. We are of course inclined to believe that it is anything but the latter. Burnham has seen the light.However, you'll be disappointed if you go in expecting the movie to come up with any new angles or answers. American Beauty is a movie much in the vein of the late 90s  a product of the time it was made in  as it revolves around a general rebellion against all forms of normality, dot.commies and basic consumerism. Nothing more, nothing less. Some characters are as deep as cereal bowls. The message being nothing more than a Nike commercial; Just Do It'.American Beauty is best when it colorfully and maniacally sticks to Burnham; depicting this little man like a shark circling a victim. You gaze in awe and instinctively familiarize with him, yet at the same time there is an acute awareness of both the frustration, hidden viciousness and primal egotistical nature beneath the smooth surface. If our schools had such a thing as a 'suburbia one-on-one' class  to warn kids of the dangers of forgetting to live your life after thirty or forty  then this could be the mainstay of that curriculum. Amidst the Hollywood stereotyping (the couple next door), the movie somehow still works fabulously. It actually feels like anti-formula because it is  face it  so charmingly formula. I am merely addressing parts I felt didn't work as well as intended, because I was so impressed by the overall movie.The urge to deliver that drips from American Beauty from start to finish  from the masterful direction by Mendes to all the hypnotic performances  make it a memorable and definite late 90s benchmark and most certainly one to be considered a classic in the years to come.",Null,0,0,21 April 2000
Terminator 2: Judgment Day," He came back
","* * * * (4 out of 5)
Terminator 2: Judgement DayDirected by: James Cameron, 1991Entertaining and technically fascinating $100m grand action movie does go 'soft' a few times, but is otherwise both a satisfying and refreshing sequel.Rich on impressive special effects wizardry  the liquid-metal villain T1000 is a gawking sight  and pretty much loaded with the same heavy action and raw drive that writer/director Cameron injected into the first one, even though a careful eye will reveal that it goes along in almost complete symmetry to the original too. Put simply: there's an arrival, a first encounter and establishment of the human characters, an escape and re-evaluation scene, a major car chase (featuring a truck) and a final confrontation at a metalworks factory. Sound familiar?Arnold Schwarzenegger returns  of course  and he's equipped with a nice story-twist that he makes the most of. Beefed up Linda Hamilton is completely sensational as Sarah Connor. There's a fitting and rugged growth not only in her biceps but in her character due to her many tribulations from the first encounter with these mechanical assassins.Robert Patrick is a stand-out as the metal-organic terminator and not only in terms of effects. His rendition of a cold-blooded robot is simple and relentless  the T1000 never gets discouraged no matter the opposition or damage factor  thus lending a very scary edge to the suspense.However, more story and continuity paradoxes emerge than need be. Maybe time-travel logic was never one to be thoroughly divulged into but how can the T1000 re-generate clothing and human skin? Hm. Not important  it's never a hindrance to Cameron's energetic flow and slam-bam visuals.
Terminator 2: Judgement Day, or 'T2' as it was billed in marketing ads, is a lean, mean and terrific effects bonanza. Featuring Guns N' Roses' rousing song 'You Could Be Mine' and James Cameron both co-wrote and produced.",Null,0,0,10 August 2003

Frothy fableVery original fable - a small visual feast - featuring some wonderful ideas from the warped world of movie wonder-boy Tim Burton.It is actually the beautiful simplicity of lead character Edward Scissorhands that sets it apart. Johnny Depp is brilliant as the confused, fragile and emotionally estranged outcast: the boy cursed with scissors instead of hands. On numerous occasions the movie falls short, but the potent mix of heartwarming humor and relevant social satire amidst a classic yet oddly fresh fairy tale premise wins you over.Rolling Stone Magazine helped elevate the movie to a box office hit  with the following quote: 'Edward Scissorhands is not perfect. It`s magic.'

Being John Malkovich," Consciousness is a terrible curse
","* * * (3 out of 5)
Being John Malkovich
Directed by; Spike Jonze, 2000
Absurd, frenetic and initially interesting mix of Barton Fink and Brazil, but lacking the humorous depth of the Coen brothers and the visual poetry of Terry Gilliam. Being John Malkovich talks about identity, gender, soul and creativity, and is content to conclude that consciousness is a curse under which we all try to exist. An inventive idea and good choice of 'host', but a self-labelled intellectual comedy must never be this overlong and pretentious. After the first few portal trips, screenwriter Charlie Kaufman goes on automatic pilot, the built up love triangle never heats up, Cameron Diaz starts to struggle in her bombed-out wig and our intriguing and Kafka-like main character of Craig Schwartz (John Cusack) seems somewhat lost. Not without moments though. A chase through Malkovich's subconscious and a flashback as seen through the eyes of a tame chimpanzee are major highlights. Much hyped Catherine Keener is too distant in her role as the office vamp - she's unassuming without any subtlety, while Malkovich himself seems inspired and very thrilled to be in on the joke. Ironically one of his finest and most reflective performances to date.
Andy Warhol once said that everybody gets fifteen minutes of fame, and maybe these words spawned it all. Maybe not. Filmmaker Spike Jonze (who starred in Three Kings) is heavy on artsy swagger and good at it too, but Being John Malkovich would have been an instant classic as a taut Twilight Zone episode instead.",Null,0,0,18 June 2000
Dark City," Dazzling darkness
","* * * ½ (3½ out of 5)
Dark City
Directed by: Alex Proyas, 1998
Exciting film-noir sci-fi thriller that has sets and plot twists to die for. It's dark, melancholic and gloomy but also funny and inventive. Visually, scenes literally drip from the screen. The movie cost $27 million to make and despite a few goofy scenes Dark City looks like it had a budget of three times that amount. Writer/director Alex Proyas (The Crow) has once again dreamed up a surreal world straight out of the comic books, blending cyber-punk with film-noir. Starring an enigmatic Rufus Sewell and an intelligently sexy Jennifer Connelly, with great supporting roles in a pensive William Hurt and a spooky and fittingly gasping Kiefer Sutherland.
Dark City steals heavily from existing classics  Blade Runner, Metropolis, Brazil, Citizen Cane and The Third Man  while also borrowing from such diverse films as Naked Lunch, Jakob's Ladder, The Truman Show, Hellraiser, Burton's two Batman movies and Lynch's Blue Velvet. Michael Ende's famous children book Momo (1986) also comes to mind, as does Franz Kafka. Unfortunately there's a whole lot less than meets the eye and gradually it becomes clear that for the most part looks are simply everything here. Dark City is at times even clumsy (some scenes feel rushed; the shattered glass between Sewell and Connelly, and the escape/pairing of the three main characters). The ending is impressive  there's a nice surprise waiting  but some may find the rational interpretation a letdown. Critics generally loved it; with Chicago Sun-Times' Pulitzer Prize-winning film critic Roger Ebert even picking it as the very best of 1998. Ebert then later put his money where his mouth was as he recorded a complete audio commentary track for the DVD release (without pay or royalties). That's the essence of Dark City; despite faults and lack of substance it truly inspires.",Null,1,2,4 June 2000
Aliens," Staying frosty
","* * * * * (5 out of 5)AliensDirected by : James Cameron, 1986
Intense, action-packed and fresh horror movie that is one of very few sequels regarded on the same plateau as the original. This because Aliens is surprisingly subtle; in between the whole blood-and-guts routine, director Cameron simply continues the story of Ellen Ripley with an almost angelic feel - Aliens is like picking up a book to read the last half - not at all like watching a sequel.Cameron can not get enough praise here as he obviously went to great length to recreate the same environment of the 1979 classic, but also to deliver the same feel and sense of endless tired space.Aliens is an exciting and shock-filled grunts-in-space extravaganza with  first of all  some serious firepower and some major special effects; and in revealing an alien completely (quite a few of them actually) - compared to the one we never really saw in the original - the suspense and danger is still impressively maintained and actually enhanced. An immaculate accomplishment.The cast is terrific once more. Like in Alien, the characters are intriguing and developed slowly, thus making us familiar with them. There is great dialogue throughout, and the clever, futuristic story will have you on the edge of your seat right until the end credits. Sigourney Weaver is again at center  she is nothing short of superb (was rightfully nominated for an Academy Award). Her sense of bewilderment and hatred transcends brilliantly.Other standouts are Michael Biehn as Corporal Hicks and Lance Henriksen as the suspicious android, Bishop. It is a great supporting role for Biehn as the average joe with a heart of gold and a healthy common sense. Young Carrie Henn shines as the estranged little girl Newt. Also; add in Paul Reiser who is simply sensational as `company man' Carter Burke.Watch those corners, people. And stay frosty.",Null,0,0,6 February 2000

Allegedly Tony Kaye dis-owned the movie after lead actor Edward Norton had it re-edited to lengthen his own screentime. Funnily enough - to me - this only talks in Norton`s favor as far as his craft is concerned because his performance is nothing short of brilliant and so harrowingly powerful that it alone evokes needed emotions and glues large screenplay holes together. In more occasions than one, scenes are clearly missing and we are left with what could have been; a daring and controversial movie that cannot cover all the bases yet still scores a home-run that sticks in your mind.",Null,0,0,2 November 1999

Kill Bill: Vol. 1," Tarantino's bloody Valentine
","Tarantino's bloody Valentine<ul><li>Clap your hands, stomp your feet and wiggle your toes</li></ul>* * * * * (5 out of 5)Kill Bill: Volume 1Directed by: Quentin Tarantino, 2003Kill Bill hits the ground running. With an uncanny grasp of film lore and a boy-scout's shameless innocence, Quentin Tarantino carves up a bloodied slice of geek mania in the finest of martial arts traditions - as masturbatory as it is exploitive and rewarding.There's a popular saying about Tarantino. That he didn't go to film school, he went to 'films'. Kill Bill underlines this with a big, fat marker in screaming pink.It is crafted with both a burning passion and a delicate sense of detail, amidst a grounded understanding of the history and style of its many scattershot origins. Be it Hollywood, spaghetti westerns, Che Chang, the Shaw brothers, a cult benchmark like Blade Runner (yes, that's the L.A. tunnel doubling for Tokyo) or pop-culture 60s TV-schlock like the Green Hornet (music and Kato mask) and Star Trek (how about that pompous opening quote?). Tarantino is throwing everything and the kitchen sink in the same cooker and it smells delicious. Tastes even better.Is it a tribute or a parody then? Neither. It's a celebration.The plot is deceptively simple: a woman known as The Bride (Uma Thurman) seeks revenge on a team of assassins (The Deadly Viper Assassination Squad, or DiVAS) led by a man named Bill, who massacred her wedding party (including The Bride's unborn child) and left a bullet in her brain. As if that wasn't enough, Miramax decided to cut the movie (180 minutes) into two separate parts. Whatever stand Tarantino made on this issue doesn't matter, because Volume 1 works effortlessly in its current running time, even though we don't get to see that much of head-honcho Bill (portrayed by sleaze icon David Carradine - remember how bad this man was at kung-fu?) or the whistling, hip-swinging, one-eyed Darryl Hannah. Instead we get an agile Thurman carving her way through opponent after opponent, leaving wounds and body parts that erupt like scarlet geysers.As with his other films, Tarantino ignores chronological order and goes about his story in a mish-mash of information. Yes, this is the style we are accustomed to with him but it never felt as right as it does here. This is the cartoon (and anime) style of interwoven storytelling, where characters are rooted by their past experiences and charged by emotions of revenge, while defined by their weapons of choice and/or colorful names.
It turns out no one does it better and Tarantino naturally also knows where the line is drawn - he's a Ph.D. in congenial geekdom laws - so there's no plastered speech bubbles of 'oomph' and 'kaboom' and no awkward special effects just for show. He might tease us with bleeping out a name, go Manga anime for an otherwise too offending scene or suddenly turn black and white as a fingerpointer to TV censorship, but it's all direct homagés that fit as a whole. There's an unflagging spirit to Kill Bill, as if the tons of soul, trivia and history invested in it was meant to be.There are also no digital effects during the fight scenes.
Tarantino brought in friend and choreographer Yuen Woo-Ping, best known to the MTV-generation for his Matrix and Crouching Tiger work. Yet the elaborate action in Kill Bill is like nothing you've ever seen before. It's a gorgeous throwback to Woo-Ping's original style from the 70s - his Zui Quan (Drunken Master) days - which translates to being real stunts by real people and an emphasis on, say, just how sharp a Japanese sword can be. CGI-less and based on hardcore flow rather than specific stiff kung-fu moves (see Matrix), even the rare wire-work feels fresh and elegant. Blended with a keen eye for editing (Sally Menke works miracles), Kill Bill takes genre material and elevates it to a whole other level. To a whole new world. The showdown in the House of Blue Leaves restaurant between The Bride and the yakuza underworld is the most exhilarating, well-staged and intoxicating swordfight ever brought to the big screen. Doubt me? Just watch Tarantino's smoke.Thurman delivers a remarkable performance as The Bride. Never once do you doubt her moxie or capabilities. Physically, she's completely convincing and not just a 'silly Caucasian girl playing with Samurai swords' (an actual quote from the movie ofcourse), evident from the opening, high-speed knife-fight with Vivica Fox (as killer vixen Vernita Green) to her eye-popping electric boogie twirls on a dancefloor cutting hundreds of yakuzas into bits and pieces. Literally. Thurman's martial arts mannerisms are dead-on - a performance for the history books. White girl, yellow heart. Indeed. She truly honors the tracksuit she wears.
While the yakuza showdown packs the most wallop, the best scene turns out to be a rather exquisite one. The final stand-off in Volume 1 between The Bride and another faster-pussycat assasin, O-Ren (Lucy Lui)- in an idyllic snow-covered garden - is a marvel. So where'd the snow come from? Don't ask and don't spoil the moment. Just acknowledge and respect that Tarantino is honoring an ancient Japanese tradition with the kind of love a mother has for her new-born. It's an angelic scene, enhanced by the loud dead calm that only lazy, falling snow produces. As the two warrior goddesses reflect in the crisp white landscape, the silence is broken momentarily by the caressing clank from a wooden waterpump. It's pure poetry.The cast is perfect all around. Tarantino brings out both slapstick and relaxed realism in Sonny Chiba, while he gets the rather obvious Oriental fetiches (and his own?) covered with dressing Chiaki Kuriyama up as a schoolgirl with murderous inclinations. Her weapon of choice is a steel ball and chain with pop-out razors. What a deliciously funny performance by Kuriyama (however much is taken from Kinji Fukasaku's Battle Royale laid aside). But it's Lui that almost upstages our heroine. Her dotted, cheeky smile and twinkle of eye concealing a hidden ruthlessness is the object of much attention by the camera.Lui is forgiven every bad episode of Ally (that's about 95%) and the shameless Charlie's Angels remakes for her performance as the sexy Godmother of the yakuza. I am reminded of John Ford's famous statement - when an assistent director questioned a shot he was making of a character's face, stating it was boring - that 'What is more exciting than the human face?'. Lui articulates a delicate cuteness and bruteness through the most subtle of facial expressions and as she fronts the yakuza entourage arriving at the restaurant, enhanced by the terrific main theme, it's as classic and cool as cinema can possibly get.The mastermind behind the Wu-Tang Clan, RZA, has scored Kill Bill (together with Tarantino) and given it a pounding pulse to match the storm of visuals that come in from all sides of the universe. The overall sound is hard to define. Imagine old-school Nancy Sinatra ('Bang Bang') mixed with the savvy groove of Hotei's 'Battle without Honor or Humanity' on top of the theme from 'Ironside' by Quincy Jones, and you'll have some idea. Oh wait, those songs are already in the movie. Well, there you go.It has to be said: Kill Bill is extremely gory. The violence is ludicrous, sometimes hilarious, but it actually walks a fine line between simply bringing bloodsplattering anime to life and the repulsive horror of Michael Madsen's ear-cutting moment in Reservoir Dogs. One minute Kill Bill gets down, dirty and dangerous for fun or shock, and in the next Tarantino brings everything to a screeching halt - as when The Bride and Vernita simultaniously hide their knifes away, welcoming reality walking in the door in the shape of Vernita's kid coming home from school. You just might be able to sense Tarantino laughing contently in the background. He's toying with us, but it's as thrilling for us as it is for him.
Kill Bill is glorius pulp fiction. A trancelike celebration of the pulp in the fiction. A martial arts benchmark and a slobbering, bloody Valentine's kiss from Tarantino to movie geeks all around the world. Right smack on the mouth.Now, that's a first.",Null,0,1,31 October 2003
From Dusk Till Dawn," Boys With Toys
","* * * (3 out of 5)Cartoonish horror spoof and B-movie salute, mostly memorable for late and sudden change into corny (and silly) gore. Produced and co-written by Quentin Tarantino but directed by friend and colleague Robert Rodriguez, From Dusk till Dawn is self-aware 90s genre crunching as seen through the very eyes of Tarantino (who also has a supporting role). Strictly to be regarded as such too.A stylistic homage with many honorable mentions and artistic nods - most notably to George Romero (originator of the zombie movies), John Woo (elaborate scenes of violence), John Carpenter (the godfather of modern day B-movies) and even Tarantino himself (look for the Kahuna Burgers from Pulp Fiction at the motel) - that comes across more like a boys-with-toys extravaganza than as any typical hip noir Tarantino effort.Both trademark directorial styles are present: the first half plays (somewhat) like a regular self-indulgent Tarantino gangster movie (as in Pulp Fiction, Jackie Brown and Reservoir Dogs), while the last half is El Mariachi or Desperado by way of tongue-in-cheek Evil Dead. Packed with famous faces - Harvey Keitel, Juliette Lewis, Tom Savini, Salma Hayek, George Clooney and Cheech Marin - some of which seem oddly out of place (Keitel), while others are clearly having the time of their life (Cheech Marin of the Cheech & Chong movies).The opening sequence is charmingly atmospheric - a superb Michael Parks as Texas Ranger Earl McGraw buying Jack Daniels at Benny`s World of Liquor - yet promises more than the movie ever delivers. It wrongly oozes the familiar Tarantino vibe only to abruptly abandon it and literally splatter all over the place.George Clooney and Quentin Tarantino portray the outlaw brothers and men-in-black hoodlums Seth and Richard Gecko. Packing impressive silver hardware that goes boom, dressed in immaculate 'Reservoir Dog'-ish suits and riding a dusty and overly thick-wheeled Cougar, the horrors of their crimes (blatant murder, rape and kidnapping to name a few) are never completely believable. The brothers casually blast their way through Texas and seem more like cartoon super heroes than actual bank robbers with a purpose.Seth is the smart, cool and decisive one (Clooney), while Richard is the nerdy and geeky brother who continuously makes a point out of killing innocent people. Due to his unstable psyche we learn. Uh huh.The story here is George Clooney. An actor of intelligent charisma despite a flood of raw sexual appeal. He is suave, calm and given some ridiculously cool dialogue ('Okay, I want him out of here, in his car, and down the road or you can change the name of this place to Benny's World of Blood.'). Clooney went on to other and better roles (forget Batman & Robin) after the success of From Dusk Till Dawn, but it was this performance that completed his transition from the shadows of TV (the series ER) to big screen fame and credibility.We are also treated to another memorable performance by Tarantino (he also starred in Pulp Fiction and Reservoir Dogs). Memorable for all the wrong reasons. His acting - or lack of it - is nearly a disaster. Pretentious and downright embarrassing in parts, it can only be deemed completely amateurish. In sharp contrast to his directorial skills it heavily taints the flow of the movie.However; From Dusk Till Dawn contains a couple of scenes that keep your eyes peeled (the before mentioned opening sequence and a seductive dance by Salma Hayek are two major standouts) - not forgetting the meticulous Oliver Stone-Light direction and editing of the end sequence where everything and everybody is either exploding, burning or bleeding. Tarantino and Rodriguez actually keep things entertaining and enough sparks flying around throughout.Watch for the snappy dialogue (Seth: 'Now, is my s**t together, or is my s**t together?' Richard: 'Your s**t is forever together!'), the stylish camera angles (as in filming through the bullet wound in Tarantino's hand) and the awesome Mexican inspired biker-bar soundtrack (ZZ Top, Robert Rodriguez himself and more) and you just might - just might - witness the scale on your 'Cool-O-Meter' go up.",Null,0,0,21 April 2000

M:I-2 (Mission: Impossible 2)
Directed by: John Woo, 1999
John Woo-infested and contrived sludge. A hollow made-for-Summer movie if there ever was one, featuring product-placement overload and basically just too much of everything. 
The first one worked neatly so you come back smiling and wanting more. Don't. Plenty of gadgetry and plot twists can't make up for the extreme self-aware vibe. Featuring ridiculous and annoying cinematography. More of a commercial or vehicle for the well-toned Tom Cruise (complete with new neck-long hair) than anything else. 
Woo's action sequences are (as always) impressive. However  they're also unbelievable and pretentious and it's amazing how he sticks to his guns (and own formula) not realizing how he's destroying his own legacy. Woo is for action movies what Status Quo are for classic rock bands; numbly beating the same old horse because it still pays the bills.
M:I-2 qualifies as brainless and uninspired box office flubber. Only the soundtrack offers a glimmer of hope as Limp Bizkit do a slamming job on the theme song (listed as Take A Look Around).",Null,0,1,2 September 2000
Quiz Show," The sore loser is a winner
","* * * ½ (3½ out of 5)The sore loser is a winner>Concise, sober and interesting depiction of the famous NBC game show fraud ('21') in the 50s. Based on a true story and firmly directed by Robert Redford.The backbone is entertainment in a historic perspective. Luckily, Redford and the superb cast allow for realistic tinges of despair and downright meanness to surface among some of the unfortunate Hollywood parading that somewhat bogs the movie.David Paymer and Hank Azaria - as media piranhas Dan Enright and Albert Freedman - are particularly annoying in their hysteric characters. Redford goes for a touch of the Coen brothers here - Paymer and Azaria do a truly smashing job - it just doesn't work in this context.There are exceptional and formidable performances all the way round. Most of them work. Lead by two major performances: Ralph Fiennes and John Turturro.Fiennes seems to find the same venom deep in himself that made his performance the year before - as the sadistic German commandant in Steven Spielberg's Schindler's List (1993) - a tentative stand out. He was both compelling, original and darkly seductive. This time he seems to turn that very same venom upon himself as he carefully embodies college professor Charles Van Doren. An educated man who is tempted and ultimately lured by the promise of money and fame on the game shows made for the revolutionary television.Fiennes' Van Doren is intelligent and wise, but nervous and disillusioned when among his peers - those are namely his father and other intellectuals - and he has even adapted a slight stutter that plays ingeniously well with his facial expressions and quirkiness. His performance is scintillating brilliant.Opposite him is John Turturro in what may be his finest performance to date. Turturro is Herb Stempel - the former game show winner who is found to be too geeky and greedy (and Jewish) for the network and therefore scheduled to 'take a fall' - and he has never been better.He gives the term 'sore loser' a whole new meaning.Turturro is always intriguing but has also become somewhat predictable. He is mainly used in eccentric and frenzied roles simply because of his onscreen magnetism (as in The Big Lebowski). Only Barton Fink (1991) hinted at the more shaded and jaded side of Turturro; one that showed us glimpses of emotional understanding from underneath that charismatic and provocative shield. That is visible here although Stempel basically whimpers and whines throughout the movie: Why must he take a step aside for Van Doren? Why? Why? It is hilarious all the same.Yet it is with his wife and child at home that we glimpse the sensitive side of Herb Stempel as portrayed by John Turturro. A man who is to be respected for his intelligence, sure, but also for his commitment to family and honesty. After all.Furthermore both Paul Scofield as the elder Van Doren ('Your name is my name!,' he protests after learning that his son was aware of the scam: the father-and-son scene is simply mesmerizing) and Rob Morrow as investigator Dick Goodwin deliver high caliber performances.Where do all these powerful performances leave the movie itself? On solid ground actually. The movie is taut and tight in form - interesting not only because of the morals at stake here - but because Redford treats the material like a murder mystery with Van Doren at center, caught in an emotional tight rope (to tell or not to tell?).Redford peels layer after layer off of Van Doren and his slow psychological disintegration has you pinned to your seat.The moral seems to be that amidst lost idealism we must rise again. Simple awareness of the gradual and ever-changing assessment of moral justification that resides in society today can help us make the many temptations - in what was already then considered a 'consumer-land' - go away. Or can it?Along the way we are treated to some unfortunate candy-coated moments though. When Van Doren caves in and issues an amendment at a hearing he is at first applauded. Only to be sucker-punched by sheer Hollywoodism. A senator adds: 'An adult should simply not be commended for telling the truth'.As if the senator was expecting the audience - not at the hearing, but you dear viewer - to applaud him. These self-conscious John Wayne values do not fit the movie. Not when so bombastically dropped.All in all Redford delivers no answers - this is entertainment based on reality - but he is knowledgeable about human nature. When he brings that out in the open - by way of Paul Attanasio`s razor sharp screenplay and the amazing cast with Fiennes and Turturro in front  - Quiz Show is intelligent and alluring cinema.",Null,0,0,21 April 2000
There's Something About Mary," Infantile something about nothing
","* (1 star of 5)There`s Something About Mary Directed by Bobby and Peter Farelli, 1999Infantile something about nothingI did not watch this movie amidst all the hype that it enjoyed when it was released (and grossing in excess of $100 million in US box office). Maybe that is why. Then again, maybe not. This movie is one big, loud, silly, vulgar, pathetic and - excuse me - 'dumb-ass' movie. The latter in the sense that it contains scenes so stupid and so degrading that I was actually watching most of it with my mouth open in total amazement as to the length the Farelly brothers went in creating what I term 'shock-laughs'. There is male sperm being mistaken for hair gel. There is the male genitals getting stuck in a zipper (and was that the most original they could come up with? I mean, Porky`s The Movie, did a better twist on the `male penis' - giggle giggle - getting stuck `somewhere' and that was over 20 years ago!), there is animal cruelty, there is handicapped people being made fun of, and there is a pair of old breasts courtesy of an elderly woman made out to ridicule.  All of this can be fun, do not get me wrong. If done in an original and fresh form. Only this is so vivid and so out-there that it most of the time seems oddly restrained in all of its brash nature and truly un-appropriate throughout.And what`s with that fake dog? My local toy store has better stuffed teddy bears. Scenes like that of the much used clichè : 'girl´s killer dog attacking the boy who is there to pick her up for a date', well they have been seen a million times before. So the least they could do was make something of it. But oh no. It really is annoying to the point you would question the effort they - the film makers - lacked in trying just vaguely to make this somewhat believable for the sake of a good laugh. Instead we get Ben Stiller wrestling a toy dog.Knowing the directors (they also made the crude and over-the-top Jim Carrey laugh, Dumb & Dumber, yet here Carrey added a touch of poignancy to the stupid laughs), There`s Something About Mary will not shock as many people as is intended. It strives so hard to be as unpolitically correct as possible and is merely concieved as being a bunch of implausible laughs blown totally out of proportion. It is beyond screwball. It is screwball fast forwarded.
It may work (and obviously did at the box office) for teenagers but since it has no subtlety whatsoever I kept expecting aliens to land og Mary to turn into an axe-murderer.I remember seeing the trailer for this movie. All the above mentioned scenes were in it. Also a scene where Mary`s brother gets a fish hook stuck in Ben Stillers mouth. And that is about it. There you have it. The laughs. I have talked to many people who were dissapointed in the movie because the trailer already showed all the laughs. In a nutshell people; the film makers again play it as loud as possible whenever possible. Even when editing the trailer. This movie has not got one, honest laugh. Ok, correction. There is one good belly-shaker. A mix up. The main character played by Ben Stiller gets mistaken for somebody else and held in custody by the local (southern) police force (subsequently Stiller gets fondled by a big brute in jail and so forth). Ever seen such a scene in any movie before in your life? Yeah, exactly.",Null,1,2,21 October 1999

Premeditated, slick and intoxicating remake of the classic TV-series. Directed by Brian De Palma and co-produced by Tom Cruise. Features a muddled plot but the electric pacing makes the suspense ring true. Cartoonish spy-thriller elements go hand in hand with alluring special effects. Great fun.

Eyes Wide Shut," Life goes on. Until it doesn`t.
","'Baby did a bad, bad thing.'Cloaked in the usual Kubrick cloth  long mooding shots, lush set pieces, scintillating camera work and, yes,  many naked woman  the old master gives us the Tom Cruise and Nicole Kidman Show. Unplugged. Cruise is great as the disillusioned husband and father, Dr. Bill Hartford (even the name is great), who one innocent, pot-smoking evening learns of his wife`s fantasies of another man. His safe, little world of living the 'good life' in the upper class (Central Park West apartment and all) is completely zapped and undermined. He wanders helplessly through and about the streets of New York, from one yellow taxi cab to another, from one confrontation to another, and gets himself entangled into an underworld of sex and murder. Or does he? Opposite Cruise and at the core of the story is Kidman in a fascinating performance. She will make you cringe with wonder in your seat, uneasy at the power and realism she purveys. The two (married in real life)  especially in the shots they share  deliver some of the best screen time this side of Casablanca. We`ve seen Tom Cruise like this before, but he`s never had this edge or this fire in both speech and eyes. Kubrick really took him that step further and the natural chemistry between the real time couple can actually at times seem offensive, as you may feel like you are invading actual home life and privacy. Sydney Pollack can be seen in a (typical Kubrick) perfectly cast supporting role, and the dark, neon-lit streets, alleys and buildings of New York (filmed mostly on location) makes for a great backdrop to the story.
Images will float and visions will blunder, this plot of men and women, sex and love, life and meaning, reality and fantasy, is the kind of cinema we never knew we missed before we got it. This is the good stuff. Movie making at it´s finest. Relevant and hypnotic, Eyes Wide Shut will be churning in your mind long after you leave the cinema. Food for thought. Delicately, yet honestly served. Bon appetit.A masterpiece.ps : Love that ending (and quote).",10,0,0,10 October 1999

The Matrix Reloaded," Get Me An Exit!
","* ½ (1½ out of 5)
The Matrix ReloadedDirected by: The Wachowski Brothers, 2003This movie has been getting a bad rap and I have to join in. I wasn't that much of a fan of the original either (a 2½ rating, so imagine my solitude when everyone was raving madly about it in 1999).Keanu Reeves was poor in The Matrix. He's a really, really bad actor and the whole concept of the Matrix itself was not only dumb, it lacked simple logic and at best entertained like disarming nonsense. For a sci-fi freak like myself the basic idea was technically charming but the structure and themes were wafer-thin. Guns? Fistfights? Black leather? Suits? Too stylized, too nerdy, folks. You can tell it was written by nerds, for nerds, an 'action-utopia' or 'perfect computer game enviroment.' To my knowledge and if I tune my future-goggles right here, hey, machines would never build something like the Matrix. On the contrary: Why cater to humans? They're all drugged and locked down anyway.But back to Matrix Reloaded. The things that worked in the first one and that I liked - the atmosphere, the larger-than-life feel on a decent budget and the impressive still-motion wire stunts (that already back then got overdone) - are missing here. Well, the 'feel' of them are. This is just the Wachowski brothers with more money. Huge fights and huge chases but no excitement. It's soulless, it's heartless. Keanu is even worse than in previous outings - yes, it's actually possible - because here he has to tackle a romance with first lady Trinity. He delivers lines so bad, so wooden, they made me laugh. Funny also, because Carrie-Anne Moss is both cool, charming and sexy but she's just kissing and staring into the face of this bland neanderthal. Sad stuff.The fights in Reloaded are way over the top. More of the same to begin with. Punch. Block. Kick. Punch. Jump. Kick. Say what? Why? Read Harry Knowles' review for more. He's completely on the money. We've seen it all before and it's idiotic. So just shoot the damn gun, alright? Oh wait, Neo can block bullets now. So why can't he block kicks and punches with a 'mindwall' like he can bullets? Ah, the logic.Agent Smith is back for no other reason then.. well, he's back. The public wanted him. Pretty obvious. So how to bring him back from the dead.. How about we make him a computer virus? Nice one, we'll buy that, but the thrill is lacking despite Hugo Weaving's characteristic spoken drawl and sleek meanness. Furthermore, Smith manages to turn up at two pivotal junctions in the story, just after Neo has delivered crucial dialogue to either The Oracle or Morpheus. How does he do that? The third installment, Revolutions, might shed a light on that, fanboys, but it's writing based on audience reactions, not vice-versa now. Contrived populism that destroys whatever shards of integrity the original had.The grand fight scene that got all the trailer buzz - the many, many Agent Smiths against a lone Neo - made me speechless. Because I didn't care. Been there, done that. Neo will win. There is no intensity, no drama, just a retread of effects from the first one and juiced up. Then when the brawl escalated into a computer game (completely computer generated) I had to look away. I went into the kitchen and made some coffee, contemplating on how few moviemakers today have actually realized how CGI just isn't good enough yet. They want us to think so, but it's not. Talk about denial.
Later on, a freeway chase has logistics to die for. The Wachowskis actually built 1.4 mile of freeway just south of San Francisco to make this scene. That's moxy, considering how everyone else would just CGI-y it. I was psyched when this scene began hence it was maybe the kick in the face Reloaded needed. But it just doesn't resonate. I must direct people's attention to other recent movies: in Spielberg's Minority Report (that is even more CGI-drenched in its chase scenes) we cared because the story and storytelling was so good. In Terminator 3 - lesser all around to the two before it, but not as bad as we could have feared - the firetruck scene is gawking simply because there's a focus on the nitty-gritty basics of the action and struggles itself, real steel and glass, real automobiles burning rubber and colliding. In Matrix Reloaded the whole freeway slam-bam scene feels like a computer game. You know how you just always floor your car, pedal to the metal, when you play a computer game because you just don't care? It's all speed and velocity? Same thing here. Trinity, Neo and Morpheus whiz in and out of traffic, chased by agents and bad guys and there's just no tension whatsoever.That scene is a full-on free shot. That hits like a powder-puff.
Same can be said for the movie as a whole. I didn't even get to the underworld of Zion, the long pandering neo-classical religious and philosophical speeches or the two new henchmen, The Albino Twins, who - when they morph into spirits - reminded me of the effects in Poltergeist (22 years ago).
Matrix Reloaded is bad. A disappointment even for moderate fans of the first one. The program doesn't just need patches, it requires a real upgrade. Somebody call Bill Gates.",Null,1,2,26 October 2003

Directed by: Frank Darabont, 1999
Sterile and chummy Stephen King adaptation. Filmmaker Frank Darabont wrote the screenplay and directed, with Tom Hanks planned for the lead role since the beginning. Formulaic and sentimental drama has few highs and many lows (including a three hour running time). David Morse  a terrific and charismatic actor  is seriously wasted.
Way inferior to The Shawshank Redemption (also King and Darabont) and it undeservedly got caught up in much hype. The superficial tone isn't convincing at any time and the special effects and slick characters are too glossy for the movie to touch in any sense.",Null,1,2,3 September 2000

The WaterboyDirected by Frank Coraci, 1998
Sandler scores a touchdown
Campy but surprisingly heartfelt comedy with a tongue-in-cheek approach to the classic sports movie story; starring Adam Sandler as a shy and retarded 31-year old school waterboy who in the end saves everybody  including the season. Duh!Directed with occasional poignancy by Coraci and with some nice, warm comedic turns by both Jerry Reed of Smokey and the Bandit fame (villian), Henry Winkler (coach), Fairuza Balk (girlfriend) and Kathy Bates (mother).This is clearly Sandler`s vehicle though (he also co-wrote), and the movie`s salvation is clearly his love and respect for - not only the game of football, the state of Louisiana and the `southern' way -  but for people on the outside looking in; outcasts, rejects, the black sheep of society. And this is evident throughout and why The Waterboy  unlike other recent screwball comedies like There`s Something About Mary  wins out on sheer heart alone. I also dare say that Sandler`s portrayel may annoy (like it did Roger Ebert) but when all is said and done, please compare it to Tom Hanks as Forrest Gump. The difference?

Any Given Sunday," Life as a contact sport

Any Given Sunday
Directed by: Oliver Stone, 1999
Simultaneously epic and earthy, Any Given Sunday is an astonishingly well-grounded drama given its premise.
Despite sticking to formula (one final game to determine everything) and dropping a few characters on the floor (Ann Margret as the alcoholic mother), Oliver Stone's Any Given Sunday is fresh, energetic and skilfully crafted entertainment.
Stone dazzles with trademark flurried cinematography, but he also wisely fleshes out interesting and reflective characters in this no-holds-barred depiction of how pro sports has become strictly about the corporate dollar.
For football fans there's plenty to get excited about; Stone has made it clear that it's as much a work of ambivalent love as a homage to such classic football movies like Robert Aldrich's The Longest Yard. Renowned for his cinematography, Stone here also delivers simply astounding and crisp sound editing. He also convincingly creates his very own pro football league as the NFL declined to offer any assistance. Some of the uniforms and team names therefore seem a little silly to fans (that includes me), but there's instant and added credibility in the form of cameos by such major former NFL forces as Jim Brown, Lawrence Taylor, Warren Moon, Johnny Unitas and Dick Butkus. Pushing the envelope while also staying focused on the inner workings of the game itself, Stone has once again created some amazing visual achievements. His trademark. I particularly enjoyed his ability to film from the quarterback's perspective. Something many have tried to purvey realistically but never succeeded in until now. Hard hitting both on and off the field, Any Given Sunday is a showcase for some unmitigated brilliant performances by standouts Al Pacino (as the head coach) and Cameron Diaz (as the team owner). Also by a wide range of normally unappreciated American actors: James Woods finds just the right pose as the sleazy and suspect team physician, Aaron Eckhart is fittingly subtle as the talented offensive co-ordinator who lacks his coach's trust, Jamie Foxx is poignant as the rookie quarterback and rapper turned actor LL Cool J is believable and bittersweet as the star running back. However; the culminating treat is Dennis Quaid, picking up the pieces from where he dropped them in Taylor Hackford's Everybody's All American back in 1988, continuing his likeable rendition of an estranged yet proud and honourable star quarterback past his prime.
`This game,' the thoughtful yet tormented head coach Tony D' Amato says to his rookie quarterback, 'this game has got to be about more than winning or losing.' This kind of talk is cheap, sure, and we've heard it all before. But when delivered by Al Pacino  in an intoxicating performance that ranks among his most convincing  then these words suddenly feel like pillars to a Coliseum. And the meaning gathers new energy and purpose. The undercarriage of the movie  like the game itself  is about more than just blocking and scoring.
Oliver Stone tells us the stories of contemporary people from different strata of society and how they struggle to survive within this world of pro sports where most everything is conditioned by money. A world that is morally repulsive, but built on a tough and tactical game that at heart is as pure as the driven snow. As a storyteller Stone is both audacious, unconventional and frenetic and occasionally he gives way to hyperbole (the eye injury) and strutting formula (the final game). But Any Given Sunday luckily never just wallows in testosterone  it describes the game and its participants, both on and off the line of scrimmage  and it only uses its sheer velocity to get around and address issues in a refractory manner. Stone catches the mentality of the star athlete today and he pities him more than anything else.
In the weeks leading up to my first viewing of Any Given Sunday I had seen a vast amount of terrific  movies (among others The Straight Story, American Beauty and Magnolia), but that couldn't shake my faith in it. Because it works so well, is such inspired technical work and so benevolent by nature. Any Given Sunday takes its deserved place among Stone's best movies: Wall Street, Born on the Fourth of July and Nixon. Maybe in time it'll even take its place among his very best: Platoon, JFK and Natural Born Killers.",10,2,4,27 May 2000

Tarzan," Welcome to the jungle
","* * * * ½  (4½ stars of 5)Thoroughly warm, dynamic and rewarding Disney movie destined to be remembered among the best.Fast paced and constantly entertaining (not a dull moment), the legend of Tarzan swings again by way of a great screenplay (Burroughs is intelligently yet honorably cooked down) and some amazing and funny vocal work (Rosie McDonnell is hilarious as teenage friend Terk, Lance Henriksen is terrifying as silverback Kerchak, and Glenn Close is nothing short of magical as mother Kala.)Visually awe inspiring, Tarzan is like nothing you have ever seen before. I was told of this in advance, but little did I expect this much of a quantum leap; it can not be grasped untill witnessed. And this, in a cinema. Pleeeeze.The Disney studios introduce a new technique called `deep canvas´ - a form of greater scope, depth and texture by way of incorporating 2D characters in a 3D (CGI) enviroment - that truly make the jungle and it`s creatures come alive. Some downright spectacular action sequences (Indiana Jones worthy) - staged in this beautiful and lavish world of worlds - leave young as well as old gasping in their seats.Also watch for :* The distinct lack of characters crooning (singing), as the songs (Phil Collins) are used as a backdrop or for story compressional purposes only.* The intelligent twists on the incarnation of the figure of Tarzan. Mainly; here he walks on all fours like a gorilla. What a great touch.* The character of Jane; always a sore spot in other renditions (from the `Me Tarzan, you-scream-and-schmooze-only-Jane´ theory), is completely wonderful here. Minnie Driver`s 'performance' is Academy Award worthy; fiesty, cheery, heartfelt and the best female lead since Lady (Lady and the Tramp).Ultimately fun for all ages, Tarzan only has one minor setback. The inclusion of a villain will - to the nitty-gritty - seem somewhat superflous as we are busy being enchanted by the wonderful scenery and characters and really have no wish to be disturbed.Go now.

The Thin Red Line," Cold and cool. Ultimately un-moving.
","Yeah, yeah, yeah.You`ve heard it and you`ll hear it again : 'Why did this movie see no success while Saving Private Ryan did?'.I`ll tell you why.This is a classic example of a great book gone bad on film - well, not necessarily gone bad - but gone wrong. Totally.First off; lousy casting.This movie is filled with famous faces under all those helmets, ringing Hollywood names, clean cut american jaws, real 'jack n dianes' as Mellencamp would say.Clooney. Penn. Nolte. The list is endless.Why? Why? Why?Malick is pulling a Woody Allen here. Only - it doesn`t work.We see Nolte and we follow him, are moved and disgusted with him, feel for him, and loathe him. His performance is spell-binding. Definitely. The only high.As for the rest .... waste of ammo. Especially Penn - with high greasy surf hair - is tired, dazed, un-moving. Yawn.They all are. This is like sending the army of dead into battle.Or the Federation droid army from Star Wars Episode 1. Faceless and lifeless, the young men move in...THATS HOW IT WAS somebody`ll say. Well, maybe, in arts, but not in REAL LIFE.Malick`s move is intentional. He bombards you with symbols and metaphors (shots and stills of animals, the wives back in the US, scenes of the men swimming, smiling, living the Bounty life) trying to purvey that a soldier`s fear and questions of life need no messenger, they should be common knowledge. Rightfully so, only he forgets to make it at all interesting.We don`t care. This is Apocalypse Now Light. With extra sugar.We care for the boys in Saving Private Ryan (SPR) because they bleed, cry, scream, feel and MOST IMPORTANTLY talk and communicate like human beings - not like puppets on a string controlled by Malick.SPR brought war to the viewer, right up front. Now, this movie doesn`t have to do that at all. Only this movie tries to make us believe that the soldiers had James Joyce and higher philosophies of life on their minds every other minute as they crawled up hill in battle. It`s unbelievable, it`s too stuck-up.The tall green grass sways beatifully in many of the scenes where they try to take that hill from the Japanese, but you are left with the feeling of Malick asking for reshoots if the wind doesn`t carry the grass just to his liking, NO MATTER how well the actors just did their scene. Yeah, it`s nice camera work, but thats really a negative when your story is a no-story.Malick has heart, no doubts there. Only he needs to be able to communicate his visions much better.Cold and cool, the Thin Red Line is window dressing. A heavier, more beautiful version of Hamburger Hill - lacking the power of Platoon, the realism and in-your-face attitude of Saving Private Ryan, even the coolness and provocative nature of Full Metal Jacket and the drama and thoughtful, believable pocket-philosophy of Apocalypse Now.By-the-way : Watch out for John-I-Have-My-Own-Jet-Travolta in a horrible role as commanding officer aboard the hangarship in the beginning. He delivers a Pulp Fiction meets John Wayne version of old time Hollywood war movie commanders. With his 'ain`t it cool' cigarete moves. Unwillingly funny, you`ll look away.
