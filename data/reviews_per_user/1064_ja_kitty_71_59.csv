Black Swan," A beautifully, dark ballet film
","I have first heard of this film from the poster ad, and footage from the Oscars when the film's actress Natalie Portman won the Oscar for Best Actress. So I had gotten curious and I wanted to see it. Well I had ordered the film when it came on DVD online and I had watched the film a couple of times; I love it, it is a beautifully, dark ballet film.The film explores a New York ballet dancer Nina Sayers (Portman) who had got the starring role in the company's production of 'Swan Lake,' but slowly goes on the brink of madness. You know, I never liked the director in the film, he's such a lecherous bastard. I had loved Natalie in the 'Star Wars' films and I certainly love her in this film; I thought she had deserved that Oscar for Best Actress.So, I love really this film from beginning to end that's all I could say. And I also love that bits of Tchaikovsky's score from 'Swan Lake' added to the soundtrack.",10,2,4,16 May 2011
Kung Fu Panda," Dreamworks Animation with an Asian Flare
","I love shows and movies that are set in Asia and also animal films too...Like this excellent film. In this film, Po the Panda, was the laziest of all the animals in the Valley of Peace and a typical 'I'm your biggest fan' kind of guy when it comes to the Furious Five. With a powerful enemy Tai Lung the Snow Leopard at the gates, all hope is pinned on a martial arts hero known as 'The Dragon Warrior' to rise to save the day. When Po unwittingly shows up in the midst of the martial arts competition, the masters are shocked to see that this unmotivated panda bears the mark of the Chosen One. I love (out the Furious Five) Tigress and Monkey. Did you know that the individual fighting styles of the Furious Five members (Crane, Mantis, Tiger, Monkey and Viper) are actual martial art styles modeled after those particular animals.I don't have a favorite scene, because I love the WHOLE film and it's lesson on believing in yourself and being your own hero - age-old lessons that I don't mind at all. And I do love the musical score by Hans Zimmer and John Powell. As I say a million times I love an excellent soundtrack in a movie.",10,4,7,14 June 2008
Coraline," Great adaptation of another Neil Gaiman book
","I had never seen this film which is an adaptation of another Neil Gaiman book, but I had seen the trailer and I had gotten curious. So I bought the movie on DVD and after I had watched it, I love it. The film is made in the stop-motion animation by Henry Selick, the director of Tim Burton's The Nightmare Before Christmas...though I not really interested in that film.In the film, Coraline Jones and her parents, Mel and Charlie move from Pontiac to Ashland in the Pink Palace Apartments, which is a converted mansion that they share with retired actresses Miss Spink and Miss Forcible and retired Russian circus performer Mr. Bobinsky. Coraline's parents are busy working on a gardening catalog, which leaves them with little time for Coraline. On a walk with a dousing rod, Coraline meets Wybie Lovat whose grandmother grew up in the house, and a cat that Wybie says is feral. They find an old well on the hill above the house. Wybie is a little surprised that his grandmother agreed to rent to the Joneses; usually she tries to find tenants without children.Later, Coraline's mother gives her an old ragdoll that Wybie brought over. A note says that he found at in his grandmother's old chest. The button-eyed doll looks strikingly like Coraline. He also tells Coraline that his grandmother had a twin sister who disappeared as a child, and that he's never been inside the house. Later Coraline finds a small locked door that had been wallpapered over, and when she insists her mother unlock it, she is surprised to find nothing but a brick wall. That night, Coraline is awoken by the sound of mice, and follows their trail to the small door. Opening it, she finds a passageway instead of the brick wall, and crawls through it. On the opposite side, she finds herself in the 'Other World,' which is inhabited by button eyed doppelgangers of her parents. The 'Other Parents' seem to be much warmer and attentive than Coraline's real parents, particularly her 'Other Mother,' who does everything she can to impress Coraline.Coraline continues to return to the Other World and is entertained by 'other' versions of Wybie and the neighbors. Over the course of several nights, Coraline spends time with the fantastical Others, but when she falls asleep, she finds herself back in her normal world. Of course it raises tension between her and her mother, who slowly tries to be more affectionate to Coraline. During her third visit, she is warned by the black cat, who can warp between worlds but can only talk in the Other World, that not all is as seems in the Other World and to be careful. That's all I could tell you folks, you will have to see the film for yourself how it endsI am thinking of reading the original book...I know that is a bit unorthodox but that's me. This is an awesome movie, very well written, and the animation is excellent. The story was perfectly funny and full of suspense. I don't have a favorite scene (as I said many times), because I love the whole film - from beginning to end.",10,2,4,21 October 2009
Beauty and the Beast," Disney's beautifully animated twist on de Beaumont's famous fairy tale
","Beauty and the Beast is one of my favorite French Fairy tales. I am terribly in particular about stories from different countries.Based upon Madame Le Prince de Beaumont's famous fairy tale (with a few twists here and there), this film is about a beautiful young peasant woman named Belle is considered strange by the villagers because her preference for reading books and dislike of being courted by the local hero, Gaston, who is an egomaniac and 'positively primeval'. At one point Gaston offers his hand in marriage to Belle,but she rejects and this serves a hard blow to Gaston's ego.While traveling to a fair, Maurice who is Belle's father and an eccentric inventor , becomes lost and loses his horse Phillipe in the night as wolves chase him. Cold and tired, he stumbles upon a mysterious castle and enters it. One by one, the enchanted household items, Lumi√®re the candelabra, Mrs. Potts the teapot and Cogsworth the clock and head of the household warmly welcome him and shelter him from the cold. But a horrifying Beast discovers Maurice and, in a fury, locks him in a dungeon on top of the castle tower. Belle, who worries when Phillipe, returns home without him, decides to seek out her father. Eventually, Belle winds up at the Beast's castle. She finds him at the tower dungeon and tries to break him free, but the Beast catches her instead. She offers herself in exchange for her father's life, against his wishes. The Beast agrees and releases her father. That's all I could tell you folks, you will have to see the film for yourself how it ends.I love the film's prologue, told in stained glass windows, with David Ogden Stiers' (Cogsworth) narration. And I also love the scene where Belle asks if she can see her father and the magic mirror reveals that Maurice is lost and sick in the forest. The Beast, having fallen in love with Belle, releases her to rescue her father; even though his heart is breaking and he would give up his humanity. I do love Belle, beside being a bookworm (just like me, my mom and my grandmother), she is strong-willed, and not a slave to petty superficial things - being a house-wife and raising children. She is also independent and allow herself to see inner beauty without sacrificing her own values. Belle is a perfect role-model for girls. Beauty and the Beast was also the first animated movie to be nominated for the Oscar for Best Movie of 1991, and had an equally successful adaptation for Broadway in 1994.Overall I love this film - from beginning to end, and you know, it's kind of hard to choose which film version of the story is the best I would say this version; the French version made in 1946 and the 1987 'Canon Movie Tales' version are the best to me.",10,4,5,27 February 2009
"The Chronicles of Narnia: The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe"," Awesome adaptation of C.S. Lewis' classic series
","There had been a few adaptations of C.S. Lewis' classic series; But those adaptations over the years, are an animated TV special, and a live-action TV mini-series from BBC. So Narnia hasn't made it to the silver screen, until Disney and Walden Media decided to adapt Narnia to the big screen, with today's visual effects and excellent soundtrack too boot.Now that 'The Lion, The Witch and The Wardrobe' is a movie, I'm excited; I wanted to see it. And so I did, and it was awesome! with a top-notch cast. Though I never like Mrs. McReady and the Beavers display quite humor. And also, the film has awesome effects, and music too. As I said, I am not one to take sides which adaptation of 'Narnia' I love. So I love BOTH this film and the animated TV special.",10,1,3,3 January 2008
The Other Boleyn Girl," An intoxicating historical romance
","I had read the book and now I had just seen the film with my mother. I thought both book and film are excellent. I did get confuse of the genre though, I mean is it an historical romance? or an historical drama? But I know the film is an historical romance because about the two sisters, Mary and Anne Boleyn pitting against each other for King Henry's affection. After Henry (Troy's Eric Bana) tires of his queen, Katherine of Aragon, he initially takes Mary as his mistress who bears him a bastard son. But Anne manipulates herself into the bedroom of the king forcing him finally to marry her on the promise that she will bear him a male heir to the throne. Mary is thus reduced to 'The Other Boleyn Girl'.You know throughout the film I couldn't believe that Mary & Anne were very close to each other. But after Mary attended his majesty's wounds after an hunting accident. And at the palace Henry & Mary play 'that's-not-belly-button-that's-not-my-finger;' then Mary bear him a bastard son. She also 'squealed' on Anne of her secret marriage to Henry Percy. Now Anne hates Mary, but of course Mary was there for Anne as a queen 'til the end after all that happen during her reign and...well let's not go there. You will to see the film for yourself, for those who love a historical romance like myself.",10,4,8,14 March 2008
Prince of Persia: The Sands of Time," Persia is really AWESOME!
","I went to see this film (based on a popular XBox game), and I thought it was AWESOME! Though admittedly I never played the game. I am no good at XBox games, but that's OK.The film is about Dastan, adopted prince of Persia, whom (after conquering the holy city of Alamut) was framed for the king's murder by a poisoned robe. Alamut's Princess Tamina helped Dastan escape from the soldiers. Of course, she didn't care about him, she wanted the dagger he stole during the attack. It is not an ordinary dagger. It is a dagger that when you press the jewel on the hilt, controls the flow of time! Dastan found out the dagger's power after a 'slight skirmish' from Tamina. After some thinking, Dastan knew that the murder had to be his brother Tus, who wanted to be king and the dagger. Thus becoming the most powerful ruler of Persia. And with a little cooperation, Dastan and Tamina decide to work together to clear his name and keep the Dagger of Time safe.So anyway, I really love this film.",10,1,5,5 July 2010
Troy," An awesome sword-sandal adaptation of Homer's epic poem
","After seeing the trailer, I thought it would be an awesome sword-sandal film. I went to see it in the theatre with my twin sister. This film is an excellent adaptation of Homer's epic poem 'The Illiad.' Even though the story's altered, and also in the ending of the film is loosely based on Book 2 of Virgil's The Aeneid. The Wooden Horse and the Sack of Troy do not appear in the Iliad, which ends shortly after the funeral of Hector.Many people may not like, but...I love the film's version of the ill-fated Helen & Paris. Also I like the fact they put Helen in a bad marriage ('...every day I was with him, I wanted to walk into the sea and drown'), 'til Paris came along and whisks her away. For other discussions on the film, I am Achilles/Briseis shipper. Though no one ever thought of doing a shipping of them. Also one last thing : I never liked Agamemnon...'Peace is for women.' What bull-s**t! A tyrant with shot-put for brains.That is all I have to say about this film, and I don't have any particular scene I like, because I love the film from beginning to end.",10,2,6,5 January 2010
Juno," A funny side of teen-pregnancy
","Now, don't think of me weird, but I think pregnancy (and birth) is a beautiful thing in a woman's life. But for a teenage girl, well...if you want to go around with a huge belly for 9 months, that's fine. But, just think about the birth and the child. It is a bumpy road to take. Just ask 16-year-old Juno MacGuff in this great film about dealing with growing up/tough decisions, and what I think 'the funny side of teen pregnancy.' I do not mind the film's lessons at all.I love the character of Juno and Ellen Page's performance. I do not know why, I just love her. I also love the 'friendship-turn-into-love' between her and Paulie Bleecker throughout the film; I mean 'it all started with a chair.' Indeed, I think this film is on of the best of 2007: full of wit, humor and some...other scenes that is made so entertaining and enjoyable.",10,1,6,25 January 2008
The Jungle Book," Disney's underrated Jungle classic
","This one of Disney's underrated films, and also the last that he himself supervised on - he died around that time. It is a favorite in my family and it always will.The film is based on Rudyard Kipling's classic book and I not one compare with bonified fan of the original book, but I love this film and the animated film version from Russia, even though I do love original stories. And also I love movies/stories that are set in Asia being that the film is set in India.I love the main-title theme, it sets off the mood of the jungle. I love that scene at the beginning where Bagheera 'delivers' baby Mowgli to the wolf family like the stork. I also love the scene with the monkey whacking Baloo (who thought the monkey was Mowgli) on the nose - that's was funny.Overall this is a very entertaining film, and a song-filled celebration of friendship, fun and adventure set in a lush and colorful world; though I am still SHOCKED by the negativity towards it.",10,0,1,3 April 2008
Sleepy Hollow," Tim Burton's take on the classic Washington Irving story
","I get a nack for literary movies. Even films based on the classic horror novels with literature's famous monsters: Count Dracula, The Frankenstien Monster, Dr. Jekyll & Mr. Hyde; The Phantom of The Opera, The Hunchback of Notre Dame and...The Headless Horseman. Also I love Tim Burton's films, I have a few of them actually. Out of the two versions of this classic Washington Irving story, I love both the Disney animated version narrated (and sang) by Bing Crosby and this gruesome, Gothic film version starring two of my favorite actors - Johnny Depp and Christina Ricci.In this version, Ichabod Crane is a constable from New York in 1799, who is most concerned with all the new scientific gadgets that will allow him to do his job better. However, he is quite squeamish about his latest assignment: traveling to the town of Sleepy Hollow, where there have been a series of murders involving people whose heads have been cut off. Upon his arrival, the four town elders informs him that the three victims were killed in open ground, and the heads had disappeared - taken by a headless ghost that is supposedly responsible. Ichabod is unconvinced of this, but learns more about the ghostly horseman. It is the ghost of a vicious Hessian sent to aid the British during the Revolutionary War, and he was caught by revolutionaries and decapitated with his own sword. When Ichabod sees the ghost kill one of the town council members, his skepticism evaporates. And then, he soon discovers that the horseman's ghost has an unholy connection to Baltus Van Tassel a wealthy farmer, and whose daughter (Katrina) he is falling in love with.Overall, this is an awesome film. Johnny gives it wit, humour and charm. This film is also great for the October month close to Halloween; or any month.",10,0,0,25 June 2008
Star Wars: Episode VI - Return of the Jedi," An awesome finish to the original Star Wars trilogy
","I had gotten curious about the Star Wars saga. But I had bought the DVD collector's box-sets of both the original and the new prequel film trilogies. And after that, I love the Star Wars saga.We now come to the last chapter in the Star Wars (original) trilogy. Luke, now a Jedi Knight, and his band travel to his home planet of Tatooine, to get Han Solo out of the palace of Jabba the Hut. But the Hutt has no intention in freeing the prisoners and tries to kill them all. After escaping from Jabba and the sands of Tatooine, they regroup with the Rebel fleet; but Luke has a promise to keep, so he heads for Dagobah. But Yoda is dying - the end of his days are upon him. On his death-bed, Yoda tells Luke he needs no training; all he needs to do is face Darth Vadar. But Luke felt torn, he could not face his own father, who was once Jedi Knight Anikan Skywalker. Luke also found out from Yoda before his last breath (and Obi's spirit), that Leia is his long-lost twin sister! The two were separated from birth to protect them from both Vadar/Anikan and the evil Emperor.Meanwhile, the Rebel Alliance had learned that the enemy is building a new Death Star space station - bigger and more powerful than the first one; and indestructible. With a shield generator on the forest moon of Endor. So Luke and Han formed a crack team to go to Endor, and find that generator, take it down so that the alliance could destroy the incomplete Death Star. On Endor, Luke and his companions meet a tribe of Ewoks, primitive yet intelligent indigenous forest creatures of Endor. With the help of C-3PO, they are able to forge an alliance with the tribe. Later, Luke decides that the time has come for him to face Vadar. He confesses to Leia the truth about her and Vadar, and that he has to try to save the man who was once their father. So like I said : That's all I could tell you folks, watch it and see how it ends.Overall, 'Return of the Jedi' is an awesome finish to the original 'Star Wars' trilogy. I thought all films in the original trilogy are really good, and I love the Ewoks, they're cute!",10,0,2,4 February 2010
Sweeney Todd: The Demon Barber of Fleet Street," Tim Burton's version of the horrific Broadway musical about vengeance and jealousy
","Tim Burton is back! And along with his regular star Johnny Depp, they both concocted their version of the horrific Broadway musical about vengeance and jealousy. Why 'jealousy'? It's because Turpin (Harry Potter's Alan Rickman) was jealous because of Benjamin loving his wife Lucy Barker. Of course Ms. Lovett (Mary Shelley's Frankenstein's Helena Bonham Carter) was secretly jealous too. But if I told you why, it would spoil the film. You know, I did not know that Johnny (nor Alan Rickman) could sing. I did see a musical starring Depp called 'Cry-Baby' which was almost like 'Grease,' but it wasn't that good.The film has some essence of Alexandre Dumas' book 'The Count of Monte Cristo,' and the fairy tale 'Rapunzel'. Only in 'The Count', Edmond wasn't psychotic like Sweeney. Also unlike Edmond, Sweeney did not found a hidden treasure and became rich. In the story, Benjamin Barker had a good job, a lovely wife and an adorable baby girl Johanna. But the love Benjamin had for his wife inspires jealousy and lust in Judge Turpin, and has Barker deported to Australia on a trumped-up charge; of course I think it's kangaroo court and that's illegal. Then he raped Lucy...O.M.G! the man's a f**kin', raping sex fiend! Poor Lucy then poisoned herself in despair and Johanna became Turpin's ward. Then, many years later Barker, now calling himself Sweeney Todd, returns illegally to England with the help of a young sailor named Anthony. He visits the pie shop of Mrs. Lovett an old friend who recognizes him and tells him what happened to Lucy and Johanna. Then she takes him up to the room he used to rent above her shop, where she has hidden his razors under a floorboard. He's profoundly happy to have them back and decides to reopen his barbershop. As for essence from the 'Rapunzel' story, Johanna's like Rapunzel and Anthony's like the handsome prince. I thought how it's set up was so great. She sings her song about being locked up. Then a beggar woman gives Anthony her name after he ask her. His song's lyrics respond to what she sang, I thought it's perfectly balanced and very intelligent writing. And it's also written not to be taken literally but to be romantic and promise her his thoughts and heart are with her.So after watching the film two times, I give and a 10/10; despite the gore of course. But I do love a good musical soundtrack.",10,0,1,17 April 2008
The Polar Express," Recommended as a Christmas classic
","I was shocked, surprised and flabbergasted by the negativity I heard on Keyframe.com. My Mom and I saw it in the theatre and I thought it is a wonderful Christmas film. The film tells the wonderous story of a young, doubting boy who travels to the North Pole on a magic train on Christmas Eve along with other children, to meet Santa Claus.I don't favorite a scene, because I love the whole film. Overall, it is a beautiful movie with wonderful characters and a truly heart-warming story. It has it's equal share of surprises, seriousness, amusement and emotion. The animation is very detailed - the larger scenes in particular are breath-taking and the music is absolutely perfect for the film. The movie is highly recommended as a classic addition to any family's Christmas movie collection.",10,0,3,20 December 2008
Tangled," Rapunzel - Animated
","It was about time that any animation studio would make a film based on one of my favorite fairy-tales Rapunzel, and I was glad Disney is the studio to make it. I had seen the film only last weekend, and I thought it was awesome.The film goes like this : A magical golden flower, with the power to heal, was born from one ray of sunshine. An nasty woman know as Gothel, uses the flower's power to restore her youth and beauty. While centuries later, a kingdom was built, and just as the king and queen were going to have a baby, the pregnant queen became very ill. The people searched the land for the golden flower. Until the royal army had spotted the flower, and bought it back to the queen. Then a baby girl (Rapunzel), was born to the royal couple, and everyone in the land was happy. All except jealous, spiteful Gothel, who had learned that Rapunzel's golden hair retains the flower's healing abilities as long as it isn't cut, so she kidnaps the child and isolates her in a tower, raising the girl as her own daughter. However, every year on Rapunzel's birthday, the kingdom sends thousands of floating lanterns into the sky longing for their lost princess to return.Eighteen years later, a thief known as Flynn Rider, steals the lost princess' tiara, and escapes the guards. Then he came upon Rapunzel's tower for a hiding place. Once he had scaled the tower, Flynn was held by the girl with the long hair.Rapunzel then strike a deal with the charming thief to act as her guide to travel to the place where the floating lights come from that she has seen every year on her birthday. Well, that's all I could tell you folks, you will have to see the film for yourself how it ends, and, I know I say this but : I don't favorite a scene, because I love the whole film.",10,7,10,14 December 2010
The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring," Tolkien 's famous trilogy in a live-action spectacle
","Tolkien's works were adapted into TV with animation by Rankin/Bass (1977 and 1979). In 1978, Ralph Bakshi had animated the first two books of the famous trilogy to the silver screen. And now, with today's technology, an all-star cast, and a fabulous music score, New Line Cinema has brought the trilogy to a new level in a live-action spectacle and one of the best film series of the 21st century. Each scene has heart,a bit of humour, heart-thumpin' action, and excellent effects. And I should like to tell you, that Rings is what got me to love four of the film's stars - Elijah Wood, Orlando Bloom, Viggo Mortensen and Liv Tyler; she gives Arwen's first scenes her sultry voice.In 'Fellowship of The Ring,' I love the first scene after the prologue: Frodo was reading beneath a tree, hears a male voice singing. He runs to see who it is and finds an old man (Gandalf), wearing a gray cloak and a pointy hat, driving a cart filled with fireworks and suchlike. When the cart stopped, Frodo goes 'You're late!' Of course, Gandalf does not look at the hobbit at first, and then turns slowly, with an emphatic expression on his face that begins to twitch and he said 'A wizard is never late, Frodo Baggins. Nor is he early. He arrives precisely when he means to.' Then they both (he and Frodo) slowly begin to grin and crack up into laughter, then Frodo leaps on the cart and hugs the old man and said that he's glad to see him. Another scene from the film I like, is when after Frodo was stab, and Arwen takes him to her father in Rivendell, she faces the Ringwraiths at the Fords of Bruinen and casts a spell on the river to 'wash' away the Ringwraiths. I also love the romantic bridge scene in Rivendell, between her and Aragorn, they're my favorite book couple; I am fickle like that.",10,0,0,5 April 2008
Kung Fu Panda 2," A perfect sequel to go with the original film.
","I had seen the teaser trailer for the awaited sequel for Kung Fu Panda...and I was psyched! Now I had seen Kung Fu Panda 2, and I find that both the original film and this sequel are both AWESOME!Po is now enjoying being the Dragon Warrior. But then a band of bandit wolves were attacking the Artisan Village for metal. But during the battle, Po noticed a symbol on the bandit leader's armor that triggered a memory from his past - thus letting the wolves escape. Po asks his father Mr Ping ,where he came from, but all the goose can tell him is that he found Po as an infant in a vegetable crate behind his restaurant and adopted him.Afterwards, Master Shifu had receive word that Master Thundering Rhino, leader of the Kung Fu Council protecting the metropolis of Gongmen City, has been killed by the white peacock Lord Shen with his massive weapon, which threatens to destroys Kung Fu tradition. So Po and the Furious Five are sent to stop him. Now I know I would say this too: that is all I will tell of the film, folks, you will have to see the film for yourself how it ends.So overall, I love really this film from beginning to end, perfect to go with the original film.",10,5,5,4 July 2011
Van Helsing," An awesome Steampunk action/horror film
","This is an awesome steampunk action/horror film about vampire/monster hunter named Gabriel Van Helsing (X-Men's Hugh Jackman). He is based on the character Abraham Van Helsing, created by Bram Stoker; of course he was made younger to appeal to a more modern era, and his name was changed from Abraham to Gabriel. Gabriel works at what-it-looks like a 19th century paranormal secret service in the Vatican.But he oftens complains to the Cardinal Jinette that he is a murderer, killing monsters which were once good, decent people. However, he continues to do his job so that innocent people can no longer be harmed by the monsters who terrorize the world. Gabriel also had lost his memory, and has only clues to his history and true identity.In the film Van Helsing (along with Friar Carl) was sent from Rome to a protect and aid a gypsy princess/monster hunter named Anna and to help in her family's quest in slaying Dracula. Anna, who is very bullheaded, didn't want to accept his help. However, before she had the chance to formally object, the village was viciously attacked by the three brides of Dracula: Aleera, Verona, and Marishka. Anna fled, knowing that the brides had come for her to finish killing off her family. This left Van Helsing fighting Marishka (the blonde bride), whom he shot with arrows with holy water on them and killed her. After that Van Helsing gains Anna's trust and she decides to work with him and Carl. As Van Helsing and Anna continue on working together they both realize the love they have for each other...I love the shipping between them.As I said many times, I don't have a favorite scene because I love the WHOLE film.",10,1,2,24 October 2008
Monsters vs. Aliens," Monster-ific DreamWorks classic
","I saw this movie in 3D, and after that I know that it's another DreamWorks classic. The film is about Susan Murphy, A young Californian woman, who got hit by a radioactive meteor (maded out of a substance called quantonium) on her wedding day, causing her to mutate and grow to a height of 49' 11 1/2'. Now she is immediately labeled a monster, renamed 'Ginormica,' and sent to a top-secret prison facility headed by General W.R. Monger and containing other monsters: B.O.B. , a brainless, indestructible gelatinous blob; Dr. Cockroach, Ph.D., a mad scientist with the head and abilities of a cockroach; the Missing Link, an amphibious fish-ape hybrid; and Insectosaurus, a colossal grub that is even larger than Susan. The monsters are forbidden to have any contact with the outside world; while the other monsters have been living contentedly with this lifestyle for the past 50 years. Poor Susan feels incredibly isolated and wishes to return to her old life; that is until an alien named Gallaxhar detects the quantonium radiation emanating from Earth and deploys a gigantic robotic probe to find it and extract it from its source - Susan. And so, General W.R. Monger (on a desperate order from the president), calls on the monster crew into action to combat the aliens and save the world from imminent destruction. I don't have a favorite scene (as I said many times), because I love the WHOLE film - from beginning to end, and I love the lovely, bad-a** Ginormica.",10,2,6,28 April 2009
Shrek Forever After," An excellent finish to the Shrek series.
","At first, I did not know there was going to be a new Shrek movie. So my mom and I went to see it in 3D, and we love it. And it was my mom's first 3D movie.The film starts where it left off from the 'The Third.' Shrek starts to adjust to domesticated life with his wife Fiona and their ogre triplets. But he started to miss the old days when ogres were feared and hunted. And things got out of hand at the triplets' first birthday party, when the famous ogre goes into a beastly rage. When walking home, Shrek encounters Rumpelstiltskin, who offers him a day to feel like a real ogre again, in exchange for a day from Shrek's childhood which Shrek wouldn't remember in the first place. Suspicious but happy at the prospect of a relaxing vacation, Shrek signs the contract, and abruptly lands in a world where he is still feared by villagers. Shrek enjoys causing ogreish mischief before he sees wanted signs for him and Fiona and discovers that his home has become a deserted tree stump.Shrek is attacked by a group of witches and knocked unconscious. Shrek wakes up in a cage being hauled by an ungroomed Donkey, who does not recognize Shrek. Shrek is brought to Rumpelstiltskin, now king of Far Far Away. Rumpelstiltskin reveals that the day Shrek traded away was the day he was born. Since he was never born, Fiona was never rescued, and Queen Lillian and King Harold had signed a contract (as they were about to do in the flashback in the film's beginning) that would make 'all of their problems disappear,' causing them to literally disappear; thus, Rumpelstiltskin took over, and has enslaved the ogre population. Rumpelstiltskin then reveals that when his day is up, Shrek will be erased from existence as well. Shrek then steals a broom and escapes with Donkey. Though Donkey is initially afraid of Shrek, he reveals to him the escape clause of Rumpelstiltskin's contract later: if Shrek receives 'True Love's First Kiss', the contract will be rendered null and void. And that is all I am telling you folks - you will have to see the film for yourself how it ends, and also, I think it is an excellent finish to the Shrek series.",10,3,5,5 July 2010

Harry runs away from the Dursleys, and is also afraid he might get expelled from Hogwarts for using magic outside the school.Harry took the 'Knight Bus' to the Leaky Cauldron pub/inn.

But he was a bit...miffed at Harry for running away, when a supposedly dangerous criminal named Sirius Black has escaped from Azkaban prison. Later on, Harry was also informed by Arthur Weasley that Black will likely come after him.Harry journeys to Hogwarts with his best friends Ron Weasley and Hermione Granger. On the train they share a compartment with the new Defence Against the Dark Arts teacher, Remus Lupin, who is sleeping when they enter it. Abruptly, the Hogwarts Express has stopped and a phantom creature called a Dementor boards, searching for Black. The creature has a profound effect on Harry, causing him to faint. Lupin awakens and repels the Dementor. At school, Headmaster Dumbledore informs the Hogwarts students that because Black has escaped, Dementors have been set up around the school as a protection. In addition to Lupin's appointment, Hagrid was also to be the new Care of Magical Creatures teacher. As lessons begin, Hermione frequently arrives at their various classes by appearing out of nowhere. Lupin's lessons prove enjoyable, as he teaches useful spells and helps less confident students like Neville Longbottom. However Hagrid's Care of Magical Creatures class does not go as planned, and on the first day, Draco Malfoy deliberately provokes the Hippogriff Buckbeak into attacking him. His father successfully has Buckbeak sentenced to death; those Malfoys really p*** me off! So that's all I could say. You'll have to watch the film and see how it ends. I loved watching Hermione giving Malfoy a slug in the face, and I think Lupin has to be the funnest D.A.D.A teacher. Anyway, the 'Prisoner of Azkaban' goes very well with the first two Harry Potter films; another great installment.",10,0,1,11 July 2011
Ratatouille," A very funny movie set in Paris
","Normally I would stick with good old-fashion 2D animation. But I will make an exception with this CGI animated film from Pixar along with 'The Incredibles'. Though the film is a Disney/Pixar collaboration, I still consider it a Pixar film. Also I love movies that are set in Paris like 'The Last Time I Saw Paris' starring Elizabeth Taylor (one of my favorite actresses) and Van Johnson; also the 1962 animated feline film 'Gay Purr-ee.' You know in real-life, I really hate rats. Not mice, RATS! But certainly not Remy. Also another reason I like this film because it's all about chasing a big dream, like what Remy is trying to do. That is something that I don't mind at all, because my big dream is to a fiction writer. So anyway, I love this film from beginning to end.",10,0,1,14 November 2007
Enchanted," A fantastic montage to the three Classic Disney Princess movies
","I have just saw Enchanted which was fantastic. I'm also glad that 2D is coming back to Disney, because as I said it, I grew up with the 2D Classics and I'll always love them for years to come. I mean 3D's great and all but it's fascinating as 2D. The animation for the scenes in Andalasia is beautifully done, and the characters (animated) are REAL dead-ringers to the actors in the film: Amy Adams, James Marsden and Susan Sarandon. I love Giselle, and I also love the pink dress in the beginning. You know, if she had wings she could have been a 'fairy' princess. Admittedly in a way, Giselle is kind of like me: I believe in 'Happily After Ever.' The film was a direct montage to the three Classic Disney Princess movies: Snow White,Cinderella, and Sleeping Beauty, and I love the Disney Princesses. I DO consider Giselle as one of them and Mrs. Adams has been getting rave reviews. I have also bought the new doll wearing the pink outfit of course. So I think she deserves to be added to the list of Disney princesses, though she's in between worlds - animated Andalasia and real-life New York. My favorite song from the soundtrack is 'True Love's Kiss,' just to let you know.",10,2,3,30 November 2007
Twilight," A awesome paranormal-romance movie
","I do have an interest in the occult as I said that many, many times. And also vampires (the key monster in this film) are starting now one of my favorite monsters. Based on the first novel of the best-selling series by Stephenie Meyer, the film has essence of another supernatural star-cross romance 'Blood and Chocolate.' In the film, seventeen-year-old Bella Swan moves to the small town of Forks, Washington after her mother and her boyfriend move to Jacksonville, to live with her police-chief father, Charlie. There, she finds herself drawn to a mysterious classmate Edward Cullen, who is really a 108-year-old vampire but is physically seventeen years old. Although Edward discourages the romance at first, they soon fall deeply in love. When the arrival of three nomadic vampires, James, Victoria, and Laurent, puts Bella's life in danger, Edward and his family Alice, Carlisle, Esm√©, Jasper, Emmett and Rosalie, put their lives at stake to save her.I had read the series, and now I had seen this film, I love both the book series and the film. I don't have a favorite scene, because I love the WHOLE film, and I would like to say that the acting for the film is absolutely top-notch.",10,0,6,3 December 2008
The Little Mermaid," Disney Adaptation of the Classic Hans Andersen Fairytale
","I love the fairy tales from Hans Christian Andersen, and 'The Little Mermaid' is one of my favorite fairy tales from him. Like I said I like a little twist in a fairy story now and then, like the ending: The little sea princess gets her prince; it is a change from Andersen's original ending.Yes, I love this film. The animation and backgrounds are very beautiful and the characters are appealing. Also I thought the casting is very good too. I love Ariel, she's one of my favorite Disney Princesses along with Aurora from 'Sleeping Beauty.' Ariel's voice actress Jodi Benson is an excellent singing voice for the film; also suits her character. And you know, it's kind of hard to choose which film version of the story is the best. But I would say that this version and the Japanese animated version made fourteen years ago are the best versions; I'm not one to take sides you know.",10,2,2,1 September 2007
The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers," The Quest Continues
","Tolkien's works were adapted into TV with animation by Rankin/Bass (1977 and 1979). In 1978, Ralph Bakshi had animated the first two books of the famous trilogy to the silver screen. And now, with today's technology, an all-star cast, and a fabulous music score, New Line Cinema has brought the trilogy to a new level in a live-action spectacle and one of the best film series of the 21st century. Each scene has heart,a bit of humour, heart-thumpin' action, and excellent effects. And I should like to tell you, that Rings is what got me to love four of the film's stars - Elijah Wood, Orlando Bloom, Viggo Mortensen and Liv Tyler.In 'The Two Towers' (where we left off), The Fellowship is broken. But the quest to destroy the One Ring continues as Frodo & Sam make their way to Mordor. But the creature Gollum had followed them. The two hobbits captured him, but the pitiful creature peals, and in return he will show the way through Mordor. Now Frodo & Sam must entrust their lives to him. As Sauron's (and his puppet-slave Saruman's) army approaches, the surviving members of The Fellowship, along with people (and creatures) from Middle Earth, prepares for battle. For the War of the Ring has begun. I kind of like how the Princess Eowyn develops a crush for Aragorn. I know she's a princess and her brother Eomer is a prince because the king of Rohan is their uncle. But he has someone else - Arwen, and during the scene when they're heading for Helm's Deep, it kind of shows Aragorn's feelings or Arwen between a dream and a flashback. And you know, I never like Wormtongue anyhow,and how he gawks at our Princess Eowyn...Ewww! he 'likes' likes her.I have a few favorite scenes: like when Gandalf returns as 'Gandalf The White' and with Aragorn, Legolas and Gimli rode off to Rohan. But the guard greets them and orders them to put down their weapons (except for Gandalf and his staff). On his throne, Theodan was under the control of Saruman (and his slave Grima Wormtongue). But Gandalf drew out Saruman 'like poison to a wound;' he did and the spell broken. And I also like it, when on the road to Helms Deep, Gimli was explaining to Eowyn about his kind (dwarves), but then the horse he was on bolted away and he fell off; that was funny. And, I love how Arwen convinced by her father Elrond that the age of Elves is ending, and she leaves for the West, truly a heart-tugging father/daughter moment; I have a thing for father/daughter relationships. But Elrond ponders whether the Elves should still help Men. You know, when I first seen it in the theatre,I was sure she (Arwen) was going to leave until...OOPS! That is all I am telling you, you will have to see the third film for yourself how it all ends.",10,0,2,5 April 2008
Stardust," A fantasy in the tradition of 'Howl's Moving Castle'
","As I said many,many times: I have a nack for literary films (movies that are based on books), and fantasy is my favorite genre. Stardust is truly a fantasy in the tradition of 'Howl's Moving Castle': a Victorian-style setting and with fairies and witches from another world. After I have seen the movie, I thought it was an excellent film, and I have even read the original book. You know, in the original book, Tristan's dad Dunstan, after his encounter with the lovely Una, he married a woman named Daisy Hempstock, and after Tristan was found on the door step, they had a daughter named Lousia. So that means in the book, Tristan had a stepmother and a stepsister.I love Yvaine, the star that fell from the sky because of the medallion of Stronghold. Claire Danes was perfectly cast as her, although it's kind of hard to pronounce the 'y' and 'v' together of her name. And It was so beautiful to watch her quite literally glow as she fell in love with Tristan; they are really a cute couple. I mean Victoria & Humphrey deserve each other; she (Victoria) really wasn't worth IT!",10,1,1,30 October 2007
Shrek the Third," The Third chapter of Shrek
","Here we come to the next chapter of Shrek. I went to see 'the Third' with my dad, and we love it; and it was the first time my dad ever went in a theatre.Where we left from the second film, Shrek and Fiona were taking on the temporary duties as king and queen - and each a disaster. And it gets worse when Shrek's 'frogger-in-law' passes away and feeling not up to the job of ruling Far,Far Away, he, Donkey and Puss set sail to find the true heir to the throne - Fiona's cousin Arthur Pendragon. Meanwhile, Prince Charming, joins forces with every fairy-tale villain to attack the kingdom, leaving the now-pregnant Fiona and the other princesses to form a underground Resistance movement. And that is all I could tell you, see the film for yourself.So, I love this film from beginning to end, and goes very well the first two Shrek films.",10,2,3,4 July 2010
The Twilight Saga: New Moon," Both Twilight and New Moon are both very good adaptations of the Stephanie books
","I had seen 'New Moon' on Friday, and I thought both 'Twilight' and 'New Moon' are both very good adaptations of the Stephenie Meyers books; I am not one to take sides. Of course, I did not like some of the negativity on the two films from some fans of the original novel series; nor on Kirsten Steward as Bella - she's alright.The film starts on Bella's 18th birthday, who had just woke up from a premonition-type dream of her and Edward Cullen: she came running out of the woods, and now she is in a clearing. Across from her is an old woman, whom she thought was her grandma. The Edward came out of the woods, and she tells him 'Don't she might see you.' But as she introduce 'grandma' to Edward, she kind of made a discovery - the old woman is her! The dream was telling her that Edward couldn't possibly love her as an old spinster. And despite her judgment at school, The Cullens throw Bella a birthday party that night. But when she cut herself unwrapping a birthday present, the smell of her blood drove newcomer Jasper crazy! And as a result of the danger Bella went through last night, the Cullen family decide to leave Forks.Bella tries to convince Edward that she couldn't live without him and she wants to go with him. But Edward wouldn't hear of it and he can't stay with her anymore, stating, 'You're not good for me.' Then he asks her to promise him that she will not do anything reckless, for Charlie's sake, and in return he promises her she will never see him again. Don't judge Edward too harshly, he is doing this for her own good.At first Bella feels her life is over and even tries to do adrenaline-rushing stunts to get Edward out of her mind, until she spends time with childhood friend, Jacob Black. But as usual for Bella, things aren't what they seem. Something is happening to Jacob that he can't explain to Bella, and their friendship starts to deteriorate. That's all I could tell you folks, you will have to see the film for yourself how it ends. My last word is that this film is awesome! and perfect to go with 'Twilight.'",10,1,11,9 December 2009
Nausica√§ of the Valley of the Wind," My top favorite Miyazaki film
","It was very hard to choose my top Miyazaki film, but I choose Nausica√§ of the Valley of the Wind. At first, I had never seen the film until I had bought the Disney 2-Disc DVD of the film. I thought the dub-casting was excellent with Alison Lohman as Nausicaa; Shia LaBeouf as Asbel; Patrick Stewart as Lord Yupa, and Uma Thurman as Kushana.The film is based on a manga made by Miyazaki himself. Set in the year 2984, a thousand years in the future, when global war had incinerate the Earth. The Earth has become an unrecognizable place. Large parts of the world have been swallowed up by forests of poisonous fungi. The remaining humans live near the fungus and it's monstrous insectoid inhabitants, trying to prevent it's spread. One of the human kingdoms, the peaceful Valley of Wind, loves its gentle Princess Nausica√§ and her father the king, but their peace is about to be broken, as they are swallowed up in the machinations of their larger, warmongering neighbours. However, Nausica√§ has hidden potential, and may yet change the fate of the world.It's truly Miyazaki's epic masterpiece, and also a great film to show us the seriousness of global war and our environment.",10,1,2,5 January 2010
Brave," My top favorite film from Pixar
","I had seen it at theaters, and now Brave is my top favorite film from Pixar because of it's beautiful soundtrack by Patrick Doyle (Quest for Camelot) and the film's leading lady. I really hated the 'bashing' I would see over the internet.The story is about the tomboyish Princess Merida, who grows tired of her daily life of restricting princess lessons from her queenly mother Elinor. Merida then decides to go against the royal traditions, which is refusing to take a husband from the oldest son of one of three lords from other clans. Seeking to change her fate, Merida receives a spell from a reclusive, eccentric forest witch, but by doing this, unleashes a terrible ancient curse. That is all I could tell you. And I don't favorite a scene (as I said many times), because I love the whole film from beginning to end.One thing I would like point out is that why would they at Pixar would choose the name 'Merida' because some Scottish names are hard for kids to pronounce. Another reason is that I thought since the film is set in the Dark Ages, in the pre-written times of a Celtic people known as the Pictish, predating the Roman era in Scotland's history, where Latin was still spoken; it is a Latin name. Also I had read it in 'The Art of Brave' book.",10,3,7,9 July 2012
Shrek 2," The Shrek story continues
","The story continues after 'happily ever after,' when Shrek and Fiona come back from their honeymoon, they find an invitation to a royal ball with Fiona's parents to celebrate their marriage, an event Shrek is reluctant to participate in. Fiona talks him into it, and along with Donkey, they travel to the kingdom of Far Far Away. They meet Fiona's parents, King Harold and Queen Lillian, who are surprised and repulsed by Fiona's choice of husband (particularly the King himself), since they had arranged that Prince Charming rescue her from the castle but now they see that her husband is an ogre.At a shared meal, Shrek and Harold get into a heated argument over how Shrek and Fiona will raise their family, and Fiona, disgusted at Shrek and her father's behavior, locks herself away in her room that evening, where she meets her Fairy Godmother, who is also surprised at Fiona's new looks. King Harold is later accosted by the Fairy Godmother and Charming, her son. The two retell the Prince's adventures and how he overcame many obstacles and climbed a high tower in order to rescue Fiona, finding instead the cross-dressing wolf. They reprimand Harold for breaking an old promise that Charming would be able to marry Fiona and demand that he find a way to get rid of Shrek. During the night, Shrek secretly reads Fiona's diary and pages containing the single phrase 'Mrs. Fiona Charming.' Then Harold arranges for Shrek and Donkey to join him on a fictitious hunting trip, which really is a trap to lure the two into the hands of an assassin, Puss in Boots. Puss is unable to defeat Shrek and, revealing that he was paid by Harold, asks to come along as a way to make amends. The three sneak into the Fairy Godmother's potion factory and steal a 'Happily Ever After' potion that Shrek believes will restore Fiona's love for him.And that is all I am telling you folks - you will have to see the film for yourself how it ends. I love Rupert Everett's (Prince Charming) narration for the storybook prologue. And also, I think it's good sequel to go with the original film.",10,1,2,3 July 2010
Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix," Dumbledore's Army rises!
","Right where we left off from the 'Goblet of Fire,' after Cedric Diggory's death the Ministry of Magic had scoffed the warnings of Harry and Professor Dumbledore that the enemy Voldemort is back, and they kept it hush-hush...OH BOY! So Minister Fudge had hired a new D.A.D.A teacher: Dolores Umbridge, a senior Ministry official who refuses to teach practical magic due to her belief that Dumbledore is forming a rebellion against the Ministry, what bull-s**t is that! At Hogwarts, Umbridge and Harry immediately clash, as she refuses to believe Harry's warning and forces him to carve 'I must not tell lies' into the skin on the back of his hand. When Ron and Hermione notice those scars, they were outraged and suggests that he should to go to Dumbledore; but Harry refuses. As Umbridge seize control over the school, Ron and Hermione aid Harry in forming a secret group to train students (including a young, eccentric witch name Luna Lovegood) in defensive spells. Therefore calling themselves 'Dumbledore's Army.' That is all I could tell you. And I don't favorite a scene (as I said many times), because I love the whole film from beginning to end; I thought Luna's cute.",10,0,3,22 July 2011
Pride & Prejudice," A great romance film based on Jane Austen's novel and starring Keira Knightley
","I had read the novel and I had seen this film version of this story of love and life among English gentility during the Georgian era. I thought it might be a great romance film starring Keira Knightley (one of my favorite actresses), and as I said before I love a good romance movie.The story starts (like in the original novel) when a wealthy bachelor named Mr. Bingley takes up residence in a nearby mansion, and the Bennet family were abuzz. Amongst the man's sophisticated circle of London friends and the influx of young militia officers, surely there will be no shortage of suitors for the Bennet sisters. Eldest daughter Jane, serene and beautiful, seems poised to win Mr. Bingley's heart. For her part, Lizzie meet with the handsome and ‚Äì it would seem ‚Äì snobbish Mr. Darcy, and the battle of the sexes is joined Their encounters are frequent and spirited yet far from encouraging. Lizzie finds herself even less inclined to accept a marriage proposal from a distant cousin, Mr. Collins, and ‚Äì supported by her father ‚Äì stuns her mother and Mr. Collins by declining. When the heretofore good-natured Mr. Bingley abruptly departs for London, devastating Jane, Lizzie holds Mr. Darcy culpable. I won't get you folks anymore details, you'll have to see the film for yourself.Admittedly speaking, I don't have a favorite scene because I love the whole film from beginning to end. The only characters that I hate are Ms. Bingley and Lizzie's mother, I mean god f***-it let the girls live their own lives. You know, I think Lizzie is close to her dad then mom.",10,2,5,9 February 2009
Alice in Wonderland," The best 'Wonderland' film I had seen
","Tim Burton is back! and along with his regular star Johnny Depp, they both concocted this extension of Lewis Carroll's novels Alice's Adventures in Wonderland and Through the Looking-Glass (few of my favorite stories), for Disney.I saw the movie in 3D with my Dad, and it was the second film my Dad had ever seen in a theatre. Also it was the 3rd 3D film I've seen. What I meant by extension of the story is that we get to see a 19-year-old Alice returning to Wonderland (or 'Underland' as it is called), after escaping an possible wedding engagement to some poop-a-doop-spoiled-brat snob; to end The Red Queen's reign of terror and restore the White Queen (who is sister to the Red Queen) to the throne.So anyway I really love this film, and I love the film's musical soundtrack that unites Burton's regular composer Danny Elfman. And it is truly the best 'Wonderland' film I had seen.",10,24,42,16 March 2010
Avatar," The first Sci-fi film I had ever review.
","I saw the movie in 3D on Friday with my twin sister and a couple of friends, and after that I love it! And you know, this is the first sci-fi film I had ever check.The film is in the year 2154 on the distant planet Pandora, Jake Sully unexpectedly got involve in a militant experiment because his twin brother was the applicant, but he got shot by a robber. Grace the scientist in charge of the 'Avatar' project thinks this is a joke, like a paralyzed 'jar-head reject' with no scientific experience what so ever is as part of this project. And about the Avatar experiment: it is basically a...neuro-DNA transference in which the consciousness is transfer in the body that looks like one the planet's natives known as the Na'vi. The Na'vi are humanoids aliens standing at 9 feet (2.7 m) tall, with tails, bones reinforced with naturally occurring carbon fiber, and bioluminescent blue skin. Of course I think the avatar bodies are fake.During his experience in the Avatar project, Jake (like a 'Wow! this is cool' kid) enjoys the experience in his Avatar shape; though it made the recovery crew nervous for him walking too fast, and for the first time in his life, Jake could run, walk and feel the soil between the toes. The next day, Colonel Miles Quaritch orders Jake to gain the trust of the Na'vi to convince them to abandon their 'Hometree,' which sits above a large deposit of unobtanium. And in return Quaritch would give Jake the money for his leg surgery. And while Jake is escorting Grace and a biologist named Norm Spellman, the group got attacked by a large predator. Jake becomes separated from the others and has to survive Pandora's dangerous wildlife, and saved by a female Na'vi named Neytiri. When some floating seeds attaching to himself she sees it as a spiritual sign from Eywa (their mother goddess) and takes him to the Na'vi Hometree, where her clan, the Omaticaya, live. And the Na'vi decide to teach Jake their ways. That's all I could tell you folks, you will have to see the film for yourself how it ends.Overall, I really love this film and its glowing, neon colors for the planet's forest at night; also for the 'Tree of Souls.'",10,3,7,23 December 2009
How to Train Your Dragon," Cressida Cowell's book, animated to the Big Screen
","I saw the movie in 3D last weekend, and after that I know that it's another DreamWorks animated classic. The film is based on the book by Cressida Cowell. I had read the book and I love it and this film too.Unlike the original book, the film starts as war between the Vikings of Berk and dragons. And during a dragon-attack, young Hiccup Horrendous Haddock III, bought down a legendary 'Night Fury' dragon with a bola-gun. Upon finding the dragon, Hiccup was about to kill the beast; but he couldn't bring himself to it. And Hiccup realize he couldn't kill a dragon, and it gets worse when his chieftain father enrolls him in dragon-slaying training classes. After training, Hiccup finds the Night Fury again trapped in a small canyon. Hiccup soon sees that one half of the dragon's tail wings was ripped off during his crash landing and has left him unable to fly. Trying to make things right, Hiccup slowly gains the dragon's trust and names him Toothless - though his teeth retract back into his gums when he's not eating, so he appears 'toothless.' As the two continue to learn about each other, Hiccup constructs an artificial tail and saddle for Toothless, enabling him to fly again, but only with Hiccup's aid.Though Toothless, Hiccup learns more about dragons and that they are not the monsters the villagers think they are. Will their friendship last? Well, you will have to see the film for yourself. So overall, I love really this film from beginning to end.",10,2,5,29 March 2010
Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone," Potter on film
","This film is what got into Harry Potter. After I had seen Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone, I had read the original novel and the rest of the series. I know that is a bit unorthodox, but that's me.As some of you know, Harry was an 11-year old, who had lived with his mean aunt and uncle and bratty cousin. He had no idea of what had happened to his parents. The Dursleys had always told him they had died in a car crash. Yes, it was a miserable life of Harry; until he had received a letter that will be attending Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry. He also found that he is wizard, and that his mom and dad were killed by Voldemort, an evil wizard so evil that every witch and wizard is afraid to speak his name. But Voldemort had failed to kill little Harry, so he had left a lightning-shaped scar on his forehand. Thus Harry became 'The Boy Who Lived.' So Harry is taken to Hogwarts, and there he meets the half-giant Rubeus Hagrid; fellow classmates Ronald Weasley and Hermione Granger. I know I would say this, but that is all I will tell you about the film, folks, you will have to see the film for yourself how it ends. As I said many times, I don't have any particular scene I like, because I love 'The Philosopher's Stone' from beginning to end. You know, I would have to agree with Minerva McGonagall: is it wise to leave Harry with those...people?!",10,0,1,5 July 2011

We are now at 'year #4,' and Hogwarts is hosting their annual 'Triwizard Tournament' with two other magical schools: Durmstrang Institute of Bulgaria and Beauxbatons Academy of Magic of France. But after the 'Goblet of Fire' had chosen the representatives, the goblet had mysteriously chosen a fourth competitor - Harry Potter! Now Harry is to compete in the dangerous competition in the Wizarding world. That is all I could tell you folks.Like I had said it is another awesome installment and perfect to go with the other 'Harry Potter' films. And just one note: I had added Rita Skeeter to my list of .H.P. characters that I really hate, GOD! she's f**kin' annoying.",10,0,1,20 July 2011
Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets," An excellent adaptation of the 2nd Harry Potter book
","I had seen this second installment of the Harry Potter films, and I thought it is an excellent adaptation of the 2nd book, and prefect to go with the first film. It is Harry's second year at Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry. But he did not heed the warnings of a house elf he met at the beginning of the film. At Hogwarts, strange things are happening: Harry starts hearing strange voices. Several school members have been petrified and bloody messages on the wall saying: 'The Chamber of Secrets has been opened. Enemies of the heir... beware!' What could happen? You folks will have find out for yourselves.You know I hate the Malfoys as well as Professor Snape, Mr. Filch and Professor Lockhart, GOD! he's annoying; I also hated the Malfoys' slander against Professor Dumbledore. Overall, I love the movie. It's funny and full of suspense and action. And I don't have a favorite scene as I said many times.",10,0,1,7 July 2011
Hercules," A Disney film for Mythology fans
","I have a nack for the Greek myths, and Hercules is another favorite Disney movie because of the amazing music by Alan Menken (composer of The Little Mermaid, Pocahontas, etc.) and colourful animation. The film is based on the myth of Greek hero Hercules who must become a true hero in order to reclaim immortality and entry to Mt. Olympus. The story has been altered in the Disney twist, so in the Greek myth, Hercules isn't the son of Zeus and his wife, Hera, but the product of Zeus cheating on his wife with a mortal woman, Alcmene (Hercules' mortal Foster Mother in the film) -- this was a fairly common practice for the king of the gods. Hera was really Hercules biggest nemesis and she hunted down and tried to destroy him many times, like she did with all of Zeus' illegitimate children. And, Hades doesn't appear in the tale except when Hercules traveled to Tartarus (the underworld) to retrieve his pet Cerberus. He wasn't a 'devil figure' but the hard-working guardian of Tartarus. So anyway, this film might 'cheese-off' mythology buffs like me...a little.I love the film really I do, it's just one thing that I am not to comfortable with, and it's the constant references to other things like: the jokes of a New Yorkish city that needs saving and the celebrity-product-endorsing; I mean it is getting old! I know it's family-orientated and I respect at what the animation staff (and Disney himself) are trying to do, really! So I am not going to complain about it. 'I Won't Say' is one of my favorite scenes from the movie. Also the 'Go The Distance' musical sequence, and when Herc and Megara go up to Mt. Olympus. So mythology fans, film fans and musical fans, I would advise you to over-look the flaws and enjoy this beautifully animated Disney classic.",9,0,2,9 October 2009
Bram Stoker's Dracula," A visually exhilarating version of Stoker's novel
","I get a nack for literary movies as I said many, many times. Even films based on the novels starring literature's famous monsters like Count Dracula. The film is based on the Victorian horror novel written by Bram Stoker in 1897 about the vampire Dracula, who travels from Transylvania to London to find the young woman Mina Murray, who is the double image of the love he lost centuries earlier. I do have an interest in the occult and vampires are starting to be my favorite monsters. And I love movies starring one of my favorite actresses Winona Ryder (Beetlejuice, Edward Scissorhands and Little Women).I don't have a favorite scene, because I love the whole film, Bram Stoker's Dracula is the most faithful film adaptation of the book and I am thinking of reading the novel. It is an engaging and visually exhilarating exercise in screen horror. Also I would like to say that the acting for this show is absolutely top notch.",10,0,3,23 October 2008
Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs," The film that started the Disney Princess franchise
","Even though I am now 25 years old, I love the Disney Princesses. But an animated princess (or a live action one) needs no certain fan age group, and this is the film that started it all - Snow White.Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs is based on the German fairy tale by the Brothers Grimm. It was the first full length animated feature made in the Walt Disney Studios, and also the first American animated feature film in movie history. The story is a familiar one: raised by a wicked and vain queen, after her royal parents died, beautiful Snow White is taken into the forest to be murdered. However, the huntsman cannot commit the horrible deed, so she flees and finds refuge in the home of seven diamond-mine workers/dwarfs - Doc, Happy, Bashful, Sneezy, Sleepy, Grumpy, and Dopey.My favorite musical scenes are the wishing well/balcony scene and the 'Bluddle-Uddle-Um-Dum' scene. To me that washing scene is like teaching cats to wash like humans instead of using their tongues. So overall, I love this beautifully animated film, from beginning to end.",10,2,2,3 March 2009
The Lion King," A another jungle classic from Disney
","Now first of all, I like to say that at first I wasn't into loving this film, because my brother and my twin sister would tease me for liking Timon the meerkat ('...sitting in a tree, K-I-S-S-I-N-G...'). After that I started to hate the film. Why even listening to the film's songs reminded me of the teasing of my brother and sister. But it wasn't until in 1995, that I 're-watch' the film when we got it on VHS that I love it.Anyway this film is a another jungle classic from Disney about a lion cub named Simba who is heir to the throne of the African savannah (aka 'The Pridelands'). But a tragedy forced him to flee, guilt-ridden, while his wicked uncle takes the throne. It would take some convincing and the courage to face his past to make Simba the king he destined. So that's all I could tell you folks, you will have to see the film for yourself how it ends.Overall, I really love this film, and I don't have any particular scene. And also I thought the musical soundtrack was excellent.",10,1,1,12 January 2010
The Secret Life of Pets," A great animated film for all pet lovers
","I got curious about this movie after seeing the trailers. Then my mom and I saw it in the theatre; I thought it is another great animated movie of the year. Also Max & Gidget are my favorite characters.The story is about Max living a good life in his New York apartment with his beloved owner Katie. That is until Katie brings home a big, shaggy stray name Duke, who Max thought is trying to muscle in on his happy home. One day during a walk with the dog-walker, the resentive Duke tricks Max into travelling far into the city, and they are attacked by a feral cat gang in an alley. The cats remove Max and Duke's collars and the dogs are caught by the city's Animal Control. Fortunately the two dogs were saved by a rogue band called 'The Flushed Pets'. That is all I could tell you folks.I don't have a favorite scene (as I said many times), because I love the whole film from beginning to end. I also love the movie's humor and great animation. One more thing to point out is that Max was so cute as a puppy! So overall, this is a great film for all pet lovers.",10,26,50,27 July 2016
Shrek," Great Fairy Tale movie
","Like I said I have loved fairy tales, even as an adult. And I even don't mind a fractured fairy tale like this great film...Though I never like parody.The film is about Shrek, an ogre who likes to be alone. Until his swamp is now overrun by all manner of fairy-tale creatures, driven from their homes by the obsessive, tyrannical Lord Farquaad. Determined to get his swamp back, Shrek is given a deal by Farquaad, that he will give back the swamp if he (Shrek) goes to save Princess Fiona from a dragon-guarded castle. So with a talking donkey-friend, Shrek sets out to the dragon-guarded castle to save the princess. That's all I am telling you, it would spoil things.I love it when Shrek yells : 'WHAT ARE YOU DOING IN MY SWAMP?!' And you know, Farquaad reminded me of Chronicles of Narnia's Miraz - ridding the land of all magical things. And that is all I could say about this film - it is awesome!",10,0,1,27 June 2010
Beowulf," An awesome CGI adaptation of the epic
","The epic story of Beowulf is one of the oldest epics in English Literature, now only TWO films adapted the adventure: 'Beowulf and Grendel' and now this awesome CGI animated film. To choose which is the best Beowulf film; I choose this one. This film is truly an adrenaline-rusher with great casting and visual effects. You know the CGI looked almost like live action, but I know it's CGI; it's in the hair.I love it when Beowulf gets enchanted by the strikingly beautiful Queen Weathlow. As I watched the film, I know they really do make a charming couple; though no else would think so. I also love it when she sings too.",10,3,8,20 November 2007
Fantastic Mr. Fox," Mr. Fox on film
","I had read this funny short story from Roald Dahl (author of The BFG, Charlie and The Chocolate Factory and other stories), about a very clever fox who steal poultry from farmer neighbours for his family; besides I love foxes. I had seen the new 'Mr. Fox' animated film two Fridays ago.In this film, Mr. Fox a newspaper columnist living in a den with his landscape-painter wife Felicity and son Ash, wanted to do something big - 'My father died at seven and a half. I don't want to live in a hole anymore, and I'm going to do something about it.' So he went and bought a tree-house. But his lawyer Mr. Badger warns him not to buy the tree property, because near the area, three very mean,rich farmers Mr. Boggis the chicken farmer as fat as a young male elephant seal because of eating chicken. Short and dumpy Mr. Bunce the goose/duck farmer who eats doughnuts stuffed with goose p√¢t√©. And lean Mr. Bean the turkey/apple farmer known also for his alcoholic Apple Cider. Now these farmers are so mean, that the local children would sing a limerick to taunt them : 'Boggis and Bunce and Bean One fat, one short, one lean These horrible crooks So different in looks Were none the less equally mean.' But despite the warnings, Mr. Fox and his family moved in the tree-house. Then (I think) a week after the move, Felicity's nephew Kristofferson, comes for a visit while his father is ill (with I don't know what). Of course for Ash, it becomes a rivalry issue in athletics and his father's praise. Meanwhile, Mr. Fox ponder over what Badger said. So despite the promise he had made to Felicity years ago (the beginning of the film), he and Kylie the opossum building superintendent, sneak out at night and steal various types of produce and poultry from one farm to another...without his wife knowing, and also three angry farmers out to get him.That's all I could tell you folks, you will have to see the film for yourself how it ends. Overall, I really enjoy this film.",10,0,2,20 December 2009
Cinderella," A sweet, enchanting masterpiece from Disney
","The story of Cinderella is one of my favorites from Charles Perrault, along with Sleeping Beauty which was also made into a Disney film in 1959. I thought this film is a sweet, enchanting masterpiece from Disney.The film has a great soundtrack and that's one I like in a movie is a very good soundtrack. Also I love the songs too, my favorite song is the romantic 'So This is Love.' I love the mice from the film too, they are cute. My favorite scene is the scene after the narration, the little birds tried to wake Cinderella up in the morning. And I also love it when Cinderella's animal friends (the mice and birds) fix up Cinderella's birth-mother's dress so she could go to the ball, until Drizella & Anastasia tore it to bits, the b****es!",10,0,1,11 October 2007
The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King," The adrenaline-rushing conclusion of the Epic
","Tolkien's works were adapted into TV with animation by Rankin/Bass (1977 and 1979). In 1978, Ralph Bakshi had animated the first two books of the famous trilogy to the silver screen. And now, with today's technology, an all-star cast, and a fabulous music score, New Line Cinema has brought the trilogy to a new level in a live-action spectacle and one of the best film series of the 21st century. Each scene has heart, a bit of humour, heart-thumpin' action, and excellent effects. And I should like to tell you, that Rings is what got me to love four of the film's stars - Elijah Wood, Orlando Bloom, Viggo Mortensen and Liv Tyler.In this adrenaline-rushing conclusion of our adventure, the War of the Ring has begun, and Frodo & Sam (who led by Gollum) continue their dangerous quest to destroy the One Ring. But they are unaware of the trap that set for them by Gollum. Meanwhile, Aragorn, Legolas, Gimli, and Gandalf united with Merry & Pippin at the now destroyed Isengard, thanks to them, Treebeard and the other Ents. Now the friends celebrated their victory; but Aragorn was worried of Frodo. And in the dead of the night, Pippin snuck out of bed to take a peek at Saruman's palantir, that was found and confiscated. But something happened, the palantir showed him The Eye of Sauron, and that he is planning to attack Minas Tirith; So Gandalf took Pippin, and rode to Minas Tirith. Meanwhile, on the road to the ships that will take elves away from Middle Earth, Arwen was thinking over her choice of path. Until a vision of her son convinces her to go home. So she rode home and plead her father to reforged the ancient blade of Narsil, and give it to her beloved Aragorn, so he can become the king he was born to be.So overall ALL three films are excellent. And you know, I do feel sorry for Faramir for being the unappreciated son, I mean it was his big brother Boromir who was their dad's favorite. I love the developing friendship between Merry & Eowyn. And I love the end-title song performed by Annie Lennox.",10,1,2,6 April 2008
A Nightmare on Elm Street," A film you shouldn't watch before bed
","I had never heard or seen this film before, except for The Simpsons' spoof of it. Then I find information on the film, and I finally watched on YouTube; I couldn't take my eyes off it. Of course I did get a little scare, but I know it is only a movie. Also to you Johnny Depp fans like I am, this is his first film.The film (as you all know) starts with 15-year-old Nancy Thompson who is suffering from violent nightmares about a badly burned man wearing a glove with knives on each finger. She quickly learns that this man is the demonic ghost of a child murderer named Freddy Krueger is also terrorizing the dreams of her friend Tina, her boyfriend Rod and her boyfriend, Glen. As they begin to die one by one in their sleep, Nancy learns from her mother that years ago the parents of Elm Street burned Krueger alive by leaving a trial of gasoline to the his boiler room; and splashing the gas around the place. Now Freddy's ghost is back to claim their children's lives as revenge! So Nancy must save herself by bringing Freddy out of her dreams and back into the real world to destroy him forever.The was film was a horror film success, that four sequels were made. But because of the negative reviews I had seen, I am not going to watch them. So my last word is that this film an excellent scare-fest, and I would recommend you of na√Øve nature like me NOT to watch it before bed (*evil laughter*).",10,1,2,30 October 2009
Star Wars: Episode IV - A New Hope," I love Star Wars!
","I had gotten curious about the 'Star Wars' saga. But I had bought the DVD collector's box-sets of both the original and the new prequel film trilogies. And after that, I love the 'Star Wars' saga.'...In a galaxy far, far away... ' The evil Galactic Empire rules the galaxy with an iron fist. Having the plans for the empire's deadly weapon the 'Death Star' space station, Princess Leia of the planet Alderaan hid them (as well as a distress message) in a droid (robot) called R2D2, when her ship was attacked by Darth Vadar. Luckily, R2 and another droid named C3PO escape with the plans to a desert planet called Tatooine.There the two droids got captured by creatures called Jawas, and sold to a moisture farmer named Owen and his nephew Luke Skywalker. Upon cleaning R2, Luke found Princess Leia's distress message; but it malfunctioned. The message was for a Obi-wan Kenobi, of course to Luke, it must be old Ben Kenobi who lives in the hills. That night, Luke discovered that R2 was gone! He and 3PO went out to look for him. Sure enough, they found R2, who was looking for Obi-wan. But they are in the territory of the dreaded Sand People! Luke and 3PO got attacked by them and little R2 hid. But luckily they were save by a cloaked figure, who happens to by Obi-wan. Obi led the three to his place and played the distress message. Obi-wan then tell Luke about the situation and about the Jedi Knights, that were wiped out long ago; then he asks Luke to come with him to Alderaan. But Luke wants out of it, on the count that he would be in big trouble from his uncle. But Storm-troopers that were looking for the droids, attacked and killed his uncle and aunt. So Luke eventually joins Obi-wan. They enlisted the aid of a smuggler called Han Solo and his Wookie mate Chewbacca, and their ship to save Princess Leia. That's all I could tell you folks, you will have to see the film for yourself how it ends.So I really love this film and I don't have any particular scene. Also I love the musical soundtrack by John Williams was excellent.",10,1,1,3 February 2010
The Twilight Saga: Eclipse," Perfect to go with the first two Twilight films
","I have waited to see the third film-adaptation of the 'Twilight' series. Now that I had, I thought it was AWESOME! and perfect to go with the first two 'Twilight' films.The film starts off where 'New Moon' left off: Victoria, still bent on revenge, is making an army of vampires to destroy Bella and the Cullens. And also, Bella is on the 'deciding' point of her choice to stay normal or become a vampire like Edward. Especially when he had just propose to her...in marriage! But for now, it will take a first-once-in-a-lifetime truce with Jacob's werewolf clan to stop the army of 'newborns.' So anyway, that is all I talk about and I really love this film.",10,2,10,15 July 2010
Star Wars: Episode V - The Empire Strikes Back," A great sequel to Episode IV : A New Hope
","I had gotten curious about the 'Star Wars' saga. But I had bought the DVD collector's box-sets of both the original and the new prequel film trilogies. And after that, I love the 'Star Wars' saga.Where we left off from the first film, Luke Skywalker and his rebel band had form a based on the frozen planet of Hoth. Luke was surveying the area, when suddenly he and his tauntaun got attacked and caught by a snow monster called a Wampa. At the rebel base, Han Solo was about to leave for Tatooine to pay back Jabba the Hut, when he heard that Luke hadn't come back; so he sets out to find him. Meanwhile, Luke manage to escape from the wampa; but he finds himself caught in a blizzard and collapses in the snow. Suddenly, he sees the Force ghost of Obi-Wan Kenobi appear before him. Ben tells Luke to go to Dagobah to undergo training under Yoda, a Jedi Grand Master. After the spirit disappears, Han rides up to an almost unconscious Luke, who is mumbling indistinctly about Ben, Yoda and Dagobah. At this point, the tauntaun that Han was riding on collapses and dies from the extreme cold. To keep Luke warm during the blizzard, Han uses Luke's lightsaber to cut open the dead tauntaun and places Luke in it. Han then sets about erecting a shelter that he and Luke will stay in during the night, until a search party found them.At the base, Luke was recovering well. But a probe droid that was spying on the band, had found the base! Darth Vadar attacked the base and the rebels scattered. Luke (along with R2) headed for Dagobah, remembering Obi-wan's word. And Han, Leia, Chewie and 3PO headed for Bespin the City in the Clouds. Meanwhile on Dagobah, after a...not so good start, Luke found Yoda and begins his Jedi training. But during his training, Luke senses his friends are in danger on Bespin.Now he must go and save them. But Yoda urges Luke not to go, because it is just what the Sith wants - to lure Luke into the Dark Side. But Luke must go! And he promises Yoda he will come back to complete his training.That's all I could tell you folks, watch it and see how it ends. I think it is a great sequel to 'Episode IV: A New Hope.' And also I am a Leia/Han shipper",10,1,2,4 February 2010
Braveheart," An awesome historical,action epic of a film
","As I said before, I love a historical film...hmm...because after watching the movie, you can research online or in a book, and compare differences between the film and what really happen back then. I had watched this film, and I thought it was an awesome historical,action epic of a film. And also the musical score is the best James Horner score I had ever heard since the animated film 'An American Tail.'This film about the historical, boyhood-to-manhood, account of the Scot William Wallace, who gained recognition when he came to the forefront of the First War of Scottish Independence by opposing Edward I of England (or Edward the Longshanks), befriend and abetted a claimant to the Scottish throne, Robert the Bruce. And later abetted (and enamored) by Edward's daughter-in-law Princess Isabelle...WHAT?! I always thought he's was always faithful to Murron MacClannough, even when she died! The film instantly became a favorite among people, and won 5 Oscars including Best Picture of 1995.",10,0,6,29 March 2009
Happy Feet," One of the best animated musicals
","This film I thought is one of the best animated musicals I had seen. This film is also about one's creativity, which I do not mind a bit. Now, this film is based on fact, since emperor penguin couples court each other and recognize one another by their unique calls or a 'Heartsong' as it was known in the film.Anyway, set in an emperor penguin colony, one female penguin, Norma Jean, sings the song 'Kiss,' whereupon a male penguin named Memphis sings 'Heartbreak Hotel.' Norma Jean chooses him as her mate. They couple and Norma Jean lays an egg. The egg is left in Memphis's care while Norma Jean and the other females leave to fish for several weeks. While the males are struggling through the harsh winter, Memphis drops the egg, briefly exposing it to the freezing Antarctic temperatures. The resulting chick (which is Mumble), has a terrible singing voice. However, Mumble has an astute talent for something that none of the penguins had ever seen before: tap dancing. This ability is frowned upon by the colony's elders, who don't tolerate deviance of any kind. As a result, poor Mumble is ostracized throughout his childhood, with only his mother and his friend Gloria to turn to for help.Mumble then grows to an adult, still half-covered in fluffy down. Through a series of mishaps - mainly getting chased by a hungry leopard seal - the penguin finds himself far from his home and within a carefree colony of adelie penguins. He quickly befriends a small group of bachelors who form a club of sorts called the Amigos: the leader, Ramon, the brothers Raul and Nestor, and twin brothers Rinaldo and Lombardo. The Amigos quickly embrace Mumble's dance moves and assimilate him into their misfit group. So that's all I am telling you, you will have to see it for yourself.Overall I love this movie. I don't have a favorite scene (as I said many times), and it does have excellent musical scenes and toe-tapping fun. Also Mumble & Gloria became one of my favorite animated couples.",10,1,1,4 December 2008
Pocahontas," Disney's adaptation of the historical story of the Native Princess
","Here is another underrated and also unappreciated classic from Disney, which became another favorite of mine. The film was based on the known facts of the historical story of the Indian princess Pocahontas and the folklore and legend that surround her. In particular, it presents a highly emotionally charged and dramatic account of the meeting between her and John Smith. This film is also the first Disney film to be based on a real historic character; although there are no suggestions in any of the historical records that Smith and Pocahontas were ever lovers, this romantic version of the story appears only in fictionalized versions of their relationship. But I do love Disney's take on them, and they had become one of my favorite Disney couples...though I don't want to change history.Admittedly speaking, I don't have a favorite scene, because I love the WHOLE film from beginning to end. And you know something isn't ironic that the gay servant actually knows why the natives attack the settlers.",10,10,17,22 May 2008
The Wizard of Oz," The film that got me to love the wonderful Judy Garland
","This is the film that got me to love the wonderful Judy Garland, and also the OZ books series by Frank L. Baum, from which the film is based on - particularly 'The Wonderful Wizard of OZ'. I don't have any particular scene I like, because I love this film. The movie begins when 12-year-old Dorothy was walking home from school with her dog Toto. But Toto had snuck into the yard of the irascible townswoman, Miss Almira Gulch. Then he chases her cat and bitten Miss Gluch on the leg. Dorothy was upset that Miss Gulch hit Toto over the back of the head with a rake. But the two ran all the way home unharmed. But whenever Dorothy tries to tell her aunt and uncle, as well as Hickory, Hunk and Zeke, the farmhands what happen, they are too busy to listen. Miss Gulch shows up with a sheriff's order and takes Toto away to be destroyed by euthanasia. Toto escapes and returns to Dorothy, who is momentarily elated. When she realizes that Miss Gulch will soon return, she decides to take Toto and run away. On their journey, Dorothy encounters a fortune teller named Professor Marvel. He is a kind and lovable man who guesses that Dorothy is running away and feels unappreciated at home and he tricks her into believing Aunt Em is ill, so that she will return home. As Dorothy leaves, there begin to appear signs of an oncoming storm. She rushes back to the farm's house just ahead of a sudden tornado. There, she takes shelter inside the house, where she is knocked unconscious by a loose window frame. Then Dorothy dreams that she, her dog Toto and the farmhouse are transported to the magical Land of Oz. There, the Good Witch of the North, Glinda, advises Dorothy to follow the yellow brick road to the Emerald City and meet the Wizard of Oz, who can return her to Kansas. During her journey, she meets a Scarecrow, a Tin Man and a Cowardly Lion, who join her, hoping to receive what they lack themselves (a brain, a heart and courage). All of this is done while also trying to avoid the Wicked Witch of the West and her attempt to get the ruby slippers from Dorothy, who received them from Glinda. The slippers of course originally belong to The Wicked Witch of The East who is squashed by Dorothy's house. I love 4 out of all the songs from the film, which are: 'Over the Rainbow,' 'Ding, Dong,' 'If I Only Had a Brain,' and... 'The Merry Old Land of Oz.' And I always like when the Cowardly Lion goes 'Ruff!' So overall, I would say this film is an excellent film for young and old alike.",10,3,4,19 October 2009
Atonement," An excellent WWII romance/unsolved mystery story
","Joe Wright (the BAFTA Award-winning director of Pride & Prejudice), has reunited with his film-making team and his Academy Award-nominated actress, Keira Knightley (one of my favorite actresses), for another classic British romance, starring James McAvoy as her leading man. I had read the original novel and I thought it is a good W.W.II romance/unsolved mystery story.I would quiver and twitch during the suspension in the film, like when Briony saw Robbie (her crush) and Cecilia (her older sister) by the fountain. And also when she read the letter written with sadistic-perverted undertones when in reality it was a second draft that Robbie deemed to silly to use. Briony assumes that Robbie is a nymphomaniac and it is with this notion that she accuses Robbie with the rape of Cecilia, but really they were making love...HEL-LO! she's only 13, she shouldn't see that! So overall, my last word is that this is an great film to see.",10,5,9,11 February 2008
