The Blair Witch Project," Isn't it a masterpiece?
","A ground - breaking film, which knows that true horror comes from the unknown. I really think it is one of the best films of the 90's. It is a shame that the Academy Awards didn't pay any attention to it, because it deserved nominations for Picture, Actress (Heather Donahue), Editing and Sound Editing... but of course, that would have happened in a fair world.",10,2,3,9 September 2001
