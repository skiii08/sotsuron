Scarface," Awesome!!!!!!!!
",This film superbly illustrates the American dream and one gangsters rise from the gutter all the way to the top. This film has you entranced from beginning to end and for those that say they cannot sympathies with Tony Montana i disagree. The man had values and morals(he didn't blow up that car with the wife and kids inside)and all the people he killed were all bad guys anyway. He did what had to be done period! It's sad when he dies at the end of the film. The last scene of the film depicting Tony Montana's demise is the best shootout scene in movie history. With the immortal line 'say hello to my little friend'. I give this film 5/5. Brilliant!!!!!!,9,1,2,9 December 2004
