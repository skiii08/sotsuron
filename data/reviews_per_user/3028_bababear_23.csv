Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," Made by machines for machines
","THE PHANTOM MENACE is one of the biggest disappointments in my memory. This is what Shakespeare meant by a tale told by an idiot, full of sound and fury, signifying nothing.  After watching this, I think we should take back all those unkind things we said about PLAN 9 FROM OUTER SPACE.Way back when, I saw the first STAR WARS at least seven times: that was just at the actual movies, we're not counting video or cable or anything.  It's structure was that of a classic western, but the way it created a whole new universe was bold and original.And if you saw the first one, you really needn't bother with any of the others.  Everything is pretty well laid out in the original, with the notable exception of the nature of the relationship between some of the characters that comes clear in RETURN OF THE JEDI.But now comes THE PHANTOM EMPIRE, which was so boring that I went sound asleep in the middle of it: not an easy thing in an auditorium equipped with DTS sound.  Maybe it's a case of my having become cynical in the twenty-some years since seeing the first STAR WARS, but I was amazed that so many fine actors could be hired for this project and then cast adrift.Did George Lucas even bother to be on the set when the scenes with live actors were filmed, or was he crouched over a monitor watching the special effects?  If there was a director on the set, he was sleeping more soundly than I was.One performer does stand out for special commendation.  Samuel L. Jackson, bless his heart, manages to say a line to the effect of 'Return with the queen to Naboo,' and he says this with a perfectly straight face.  He doesn't giggle or snicker or anything.  Although I'll bet that in the vaults there are hundreds of feet of unusable takes with him giggling, stammering, or just laughing his head off trying to say 'Naboo' with a straight face.This movie is garbage.  Boycott it, and don't buy any of the millions of products with images of the film on it.  Instead, go to the video store and check out STAR WARS and treat yourself to a movie that dares to be original.",1,7,14,5 July 1999
Unbreakable," People get paid for making stuff like this?
","I'd heard from friends how bad this movie was.  It was on Encore, I had the time.  Now I want my two hours back.When I watched THE SIXTH SENSE, I believed every second of it.  This is just the opposite.  There's hardly a minute, a scene or a character that rings true.The premise of the film is that Bruce Willis's character is actually a comic book superhero.  OK.  This could have been interesting.  But since Mr. Willis is forty-five years old here, it makes us wonder why his character didn't catch on to this a little sooner.  Like thirty years sooner.Samuel L. Jackson talks to Willis's character about how in working as a security guard at a university stadium he has gravitated to a job where he protects people.  OK.  But if this urge to protect and help people is so strong, why isn't he a policeman, fireman, or emergency medical technician? Working stadium security isn't a job that gives a guy a chance to be heroic all that often.  And since his character is a college graduate, this also casts the guy in the position of being an underachiever.  We suspect that it's his wife- a physical therapist- who largely supports the family.And Willis' poor son.  The boy is in some weird school that's in session on Saturday.  Think about it.  The boy gets in trouble at school, Willis is summoned from a football game.  When do universities play their games. Right.  So why is the boy in school on a Saturday afternoon?  And the idiotic scene where he holds his parents at gunpoint.  This gives the actors a chance to talk to him about how friends don't shoot friends, dialog that the actors must have been paid very handsomely to spit out of their mouths.I've read that UNBREAKABLE was supposed to be the first in a trilogy, but since audiences stayed away from it in droves the other two films will never be made.  Maybe they made sense of what happens in this one by expanding on these same themes.  We'll never know.But knowing that the same director/writer made CIRCLES which opens this week, I've already crossed that one off my list.  Fool me once, shame on you; fool me twice, shame on me.",Null,0,1,30 July 2002
L.A. Confidential," Is that all there is?
","This was just a well-photographed variation on CHINATOWN.  The story was too contrived and needlessly complicated.  Cleaning up the storyline would have cut forty-five minutes from the bloated running time.  And why wasn't James Cromwell nominated for Best Supporting Actor?  His work was the highlight of the whole film.  The low point was Kim Basinger's way over-rated performance.  There was more acting done by the excellent costumes than by Ms. B.  She was adequate, but didn't do anything with the part that a dozen other actresses could have done.",2,13,40,16 January 1999
Ocean's Twelve," European Vacations for Free
","The best swindle that goes on in this movie is the one behind the scenes. Not only do the cast and crew con the studio out of paying them salaries for a movie that makes PLAN 9 FROM OUTER SPACE look like a masterpiece but they get free trips to Europe as well. To top that they release the movie and con people into buying tickets. Sweet.Everything that can go wrong here does. Bad writing. Inept direction. The most annoying musical score since THE HOURS. Actors who seem bored and don't even attempt characterizations.Somehow the costume director and cinematographer didn't get the message that they weren't supposed to work too hard. The film is very well costumed and has good camera work.This is a sequel to OCEAN'S ELEVEN and presumes that the viewer saw that movie last night. I could only remember about half of the characters and many of them for the wrong reasons. George Clooney for being the ringleader. Don Cheadle for that dreadful attempt at a Cockney accent. The Asian guy for being Asian. Brad Pitt for being Brad Pitt. Elliot Gould for a bad haircut. Carl Reiner for being bald. The other five were just there.The first movie very carefully built up the characterizations and gave motivation for the big robbery. Here the characters are rounded up like cattle and thrown together, and these fine actors simply deserve better.The story literally skips all over the place. Various locations in the United States. Several cities in Europe. Of course that gave the actors more stops on their vacations, so it's understandable. It's just confusing for the viewer.The first movie's downfall was going on two minutes too long. If they had ended with the scenes in front of the fountains it would have been a classic in the genre. By tacking on the scene with George Clooney and Julia Roberts getting together at the end it ended on a flat note.This one goes to the bad early on in the game. And Julia Roberts is subjected to a plot twist (don't worry, no spoilers if you want to see it) that is probably the stupidest one ever seen on film. It was so stupid that I do hope the director released Julia's mother from the dungeon when she finished filming it.One of the worst moments in this involves a, well, dance number that's part of one of the heists. It's done in a room being constantly being swept by lasers in a random pattern. Let me repeat that: RANDOM pattern. What we see is interesting but your brain is telling you, sorry, this won't work. Not if the lasers are in a truly random pattern.Hopefully this one was bad enough that we'll be spared an OCEAN'S THIRTEEN, unless they want to have Jason Voorhes slaughter the cast, the writer, the director, and especially the composer on screen. I'd pay $7 to see that right now.",1,2,4,7 October 2005
Closer," Why Isn't Love Enough?
","The basic story behind CLOSER could have been used as the premise for a romantic comedy or even a farce. There are four main characters: two men, a writer and a doctor, and two women, a photographer and a waitress/stripper. First the writer and the waitress/stripper are a couple, then the doctor and the photographer meet and eventually marry, and then over the years the characters migrate back and forth.But this doesn't resolve itself with eternal fidelity in rose covered cottages. These characters are looking for something, and we don't know what it is because they don't.The four leads are awesome, especially Julia Roberts. This screenplay and Mike Nichols's direction bring out qualities in her that have remained hidden until this film.My only gripe was that it was hard to keep track of the passage of years as the story progressed. Maybe this was more concrete in the stage version. To a certain extent this could be measured by Natalie Portman's constantly changing styles and colors of hair.But that may be a good thing because it makes the viewer work to keep up with things.Some people have commented that the endless switching back and forth of mates would only take place in a big city: the film, except for a coda in New York, takes place in London. This implies that 'in our little town' relations aren't as complicated as this. If you say so, but my years of living tell me otherwise.A nice grownup movie, rare these days. I saw SUPERMAN RETURNS this afternoon, then watched CLOSER on video tonight. In a few days the man of steel's adventures will have faded from my mind, but CLOSER gives the viewer a lot to think about even after it's over.",8,1,2,4 July 2006
Shutter Island," Scorsese Lays a Very Large Rotten Egg
","The premise of SHUTTER ISLAND was fresh and original...the first dozen or times it was utilized in a story.MAJOR SPOILERS AHEAD.BE WARNED.The idea that the main character is really a patient at the mental hospital, not a federal marshal investigating a disappearance there, has been done countless times. Very early in the narrative I figured out that the story was being told from inside Teddy's mind and kept waiting for some reason that this much money was being spent and this talented a group of people working so hard to tell this story. There must be some other twist coming that will make this worthwhile.Nope. It just gets worse and worse, and sillier and sillier.This would provide great material for Mystery Science Theater 3000. Tonight people all over the theater were laughing out loud, and not at any points that were supposed to be funny.The screenplay, to be generous, stinks. Fine actors read dialog that is as stilted as can be. The musical score is equally bad, with shuddering, ominous strings underlying scenes and trying valiantly to drown out the awful lines those poor actors were forced to say.Because the story is being told through the eyes of an insane characters, the continuity lapses are understandable. A hurricane blows over the island, causing considerable damage. For whatever reason, though, the storm is selective. Huge trees are uprooted in some places but in other places there is no visible damage at all.In one scene near the end Teddy wakes up to find three supporting characters standing around his bed. It brought to mind the scene at the end of THE WIZARD OF OZ when Dorothy wakes up to find her friends have been watching over her while she sleeps. Did Scorsese not realize the similarity? There was one fascinating mystery that I hoped would be explained but wasn't. Teddy makes his way to a lighthouse and runs up the stairs to find one of the doctors from the mental hospital in a office.OK. It's a lighthouse. There's a spiral staircase running through the middle of it. How in the world did the doctor manage to get a desk, chairs, file cabinet, lamps, etc., three stories up a spiral staircase? And why? I'd ask the same question of Scorsese. You and some brilliant actors made this turd.Why?",1,148,310,20 February 2010
Armageddon," A great beginning, then rapidly downhill
","ARMAGEDDON starts off like a house afire.  After a pretentious prologue narrated by no less than Charlton Heston (but without plugs for the NRA) and showing the configuration of continents umpteen million years ago as being exactly the same as it is now, the movie pops the clutch and goes into high gear.New York City, the present day.  Under the opening titles, a young man rides his bicycle into Manhattan with his strange looking but still cute dog riding in the basket.  Once in Manhattan he comes into confilict with a street vendor selling Godzilla figures, which the dog promptly tries to eat.  Meanwhile an Asian couple is stuck in traffic, and the woman is complaining to the cab driver that she wants to go shopping.Without warning huge chunks of rock are streaking from the sky, buildings are exploding, vehicles are bursting into flames, the top of the Chrystler Building is sheared off and falls into the street below, crushing cars and pedestrians unlucky enough to be in its path.  A hole is blown in the street and the young man tries to rescue his dog.People are in motion, things are happening at a breakneck pace, adrenaline is pumping.And all too soon we cut away and never see these characters or New York City again.  Director Michael Bay starts all over again with a new setting (an offshore oil rig) and new characters who are neither fresh nor interesting.The rig is run by Harry Stamper (Bruce Willis).  His awesomely lovely daughter Grace (Liv Tyler) lives with him and a dozen or so men on the isolated rig.  Harry is amazed that Grace is deep in a romance with A. J. Frost (Ben Affleck), one of his crew members.  And Harry is the hero of this movie, the man whose job it will be to save the planet, but he's too dense to figure that his daughter would get in a situation like this on this rig in the middle of nowhere?Lord help us all!  Would someone go over to the auditorium where DEEP IMPACT is playing and see if they can talk Robert Duvall into coming back with them?  Now there's a man who can inspire confidence.DEEP IMPACT was a very good movie on its own.  Compared to what passes for entertainment here, DEEP IMPACT seems more like a latter day CITIZEN KANE.Really, there's noting wrong with Mr. Willis's performance here.  But the script (by a total of ten writers, always a bad sign) doesn't really give him anything to work with.  Late show fans will recall the situation with his daughter and Affleck as recycled from John Wayne's THE HELLFIGHTERS.Pretty soon Willis is in Houston at NASA and the big brass are telling him that he and his crew need to do the whole astronaut training bit in a period of days and then go blow up the asteroid roughly the size of Texas which threatens to crush the world.So he and his crew go through the training (lots of recycled material from THE DIRTY DOZEN HERE) and finally do blast off.  Before they leave Ms. Tyler and Affleck make goo-goo eyes at each other while songs by Aerosmith (featuring Liv's dad, Steve) play on the soundtrack.  If this had been directed by John Waters, he could have had some creepy fun with that.Paris blows up.  Singapore blows up.  But since we don't know any characters in either city, that's just so much special effects.  Oddly enough, it seems as if the killer chunks of rock will not strike anywhere with a population of less than several million people.There's one special effect worth noting, though.  It's a major conceit of this film that if the sun is shining on the U S of A, it's shining everywhere.  There's no nonsense about time zones or the earth's rotation or anything like that.There are two performances of note here.  Most amazingly, Steve Buscemi plays one of the drillers.  After all those independent films he's made, here he is in a big piece of mainstream crap to get a nice check so that he can go on making quirky independent films.  Way to go, Steve.  Cash those checks, hold your head up, and walk on.One of the big cheeses at NASA is played by Billy Bob Thornton.  Billy Bob hasn't made many movies like this, and he creates a three-dimensional and interesting character.  Since director Michael Bay doesn't seem very intersted in the actors, just the explosions, I guess there wasn't anyone to stop Billy Bob from doing good work.  He plays a man who would have been an astronaut were it not for physical limitations, and he's teriffic.The astronauts blast off and the story grinds to a screeching halt for an interlude on the Russian space station, which blows up very loudly as the astronauts make a hasty exit.  Then the astronauts try to plant a big bomb on the asteroid which, for whatever reason, has grass and water on it although there's no atmosphere.The finale involves self-sacrifice, probably because audiences responded so positively to the same element in DEEP IMPACT.  There's a scene that, oddly enough, builds to a point where it actually has emotional impact: if Michael Bay had known that, the scene probably would have been cut.More stuff blows up.The surviving astronauts return to Earth, and there's a wedding.  Nothing else blows up.  Except the audience, when they realize that they've blown $5 or more and a whopping two hours and twenty-four minutes.With any luck this will be the end of the current cycle of disaster movies. Anyway, I liked them better back in the 1970's when they featured actors whose tv shows had been cancelled but still had some recognition factor.Parents' note- the PG-13 rating is for some language and sexual innuendo and violence.  The violence mainly consists of stuff blowing up, with very little attention to those people who might be caught in the way.  And it's very, very loud.  The film might be disturbing to children under junior high age.On a five scale, Pops gives ARMAGEDDON 1.5 skyrockets.",Null,0,1,31 August 1998
Little Miss Sunshine," I'm Sore from Laughing
","Since this is an independent film (whatever that means) I really didn't expect the belly laughs that this delivers. And it's got heart. It's about a group of people related by blood and living together who learn to be a family.On the surface it would seem to be a spin off of The Simpsons. Dope sniffing foul mouthed grandpa. Dad who's trying to make it as a motivational speaker. Mom who's trying to hold the whole thing together. Brother who's an elective mute. Uncle who's a suicidal gay academic. And, at the heart of things, a kind and innocent little girl who dreams of winning the Little Miss Sunshine kiddie beauty contest.If you didn't know that these things are real, the beauty contest would make you think that the film's writers are on crack. There are eleven girls who look like Barbies and Bratz come to life. These children, who look like thirty year old midgets who've lived hard, are horrifying. Worse yet, the girls playing them really perform in these travesties. Chubby little Olive is the only one on the stage who looks like a human being. And her dance routine is, well, definitely different.Last weekend I saw and hugely enjoyed TALLADEGA NIGHTS. In the final analysis, LITTLE MISS SUNSHINE has even more laughs for your buck. This is a prize. Enjoy.",10,2,6,26 August 2006
American Beauty," This is a great movie- see it!
","The tagline for AMERICAN BEAUTY sums up the whole two hours in two words. Look closer.When we first see the suburb where most of the action takes place, the camera looks to be mounted on a helicopter.  It glides along the tree lined streets.There's one house in particular where most of the action takes place.  From the outside all is normal and nice.  This could be a neighborhood from OZZIE AND HARRIET or FATHER KNOWS BEST.  Look at the family living in the house with the red door.  A man who works in advertising.  His wife who sells real estate.  His beautiful daughter.  Look closer.These people are estranged from each other and, worst of all, from themselves.  At the risk of lapsing into jargon, their authentic selves have long since been abandoned.  Look closer.These are three desperately lonely people.  On the one hand, the movie is hilarious.  There is wild humor here that reminds you of WHO'S AFRAID OF VIRGINIA WOOLF and THE GRADUATE.  But these people are dying inside.The father becomes infatuated with a girl who's in the high school drill team with his daughter.  She's a blonde beauty who's got ambitions of being a model.  She seems tough as nails and ready to do anything to get what she wants.  Look closer.The family next door is even more bizarre.  The father is a homophobic, self-righteous retired military officer.  The mother seems terrified out of her wits and is in a zombie-like state.  Their son is involved with drugs. He keeps reality at a distance by videotaping everything.  He has a hauntingly beautiful tape of a plastic bag being blown by the wind that I could have watched for hours.  When he gets involved with the girl from next door, we're sure that we know what's going to happen next.  Look closer.If the movie has a fault, it's that it's too short.  There are about a dozen characters we'd like to see examined in more depth.Watching this, I marveled at how comparatively normal my own life really is. Teenagers can watch this movie and come away thinking that maybe their parents aren't really all that weird after all :-)An important point to ponder, though.  The characters in this story didn't come to these points in their lives overnight.  Everything that's gone wrong went wrong through a slow process over the years.Every person who sees AMERICAN BEAUTY will come away saying, well, that's not my life.  That was interesting but it couldn't happen in my state, my town, my neighborhood, my house.  Look closer.",3,1,1,10 October 1999
Bridesmaids," An Earnest Try by Talented Amateurs
","This is a perfect example of a script that needed a couple more rewrites before they started to roll the cameras. There are several hilarious short sketches here: Annie's bizarre interaction with customers in the jewelry store where she briefly works, a group of young women becoming ill with food poisoning in an awesomely pretentious bridal boutique where they try on overpriced and awesomely hideous dresses, and a falling out between friends that disrupts a vulgarly overdone bridal shower. Plus, this should push the issue of making Casting a category at the Oscars: the young women are all delightful in their own ways, and casting Jill Clayburgh as Annie's mother is an act of genius.The director should have watched some of the Marx Brothers movies, or those directed by Howard Hawks. They took off like racehorses and trusted the audience's intelligence to keep up. This needs at least thirty minutes cut out.There seems to have been directed to be watched on TV. There are numerous spots where viewers could fold laundry, get a snack, go to the bathroom, whatever, and it's easy to see where the dead spots are coming. It's as if the director ran out of breath. And when you know when a pop song comes on the soundtrack the action is going to screech to a halt.Also, this is proof of how unnecessary profanity is in films. At first there's the mild amusement, but too soon the ladies are turning the air blue: this has the unfortunate effect of making them sound as if they are women pushing forty who are still in the sixth grade.Still, I'd recommend BRIDESMAIDS to anyone because the parts that do work are greatness. And the wedding dress the bride wears to the tastelessly overdone wedding- which she mentions to Annie in passing her father can't afford- is a hilarious sight gag, looking like canned whip cream which has been sprayed on the unfortunate bride and somehow turned to fabric. Bridesmaids' dresses are supposed to be hideous- it's traditional- but her outfit is something no woman would wear to a dog fight.",5,4,13,14 May 2011
Meet the Fockers," A Waste of Their Talent and My Time and Money
","The first movie was fun. This one had only one big laugh, the scene with the cat and dog and the toilet, and a few chuckles. The photography was awful. It looked like it was made in somebody's back yard (possibly we just saw a poor quality print).I'll admit that people were laughing and I seemed to be the only one in our group who wasn't, but it just didn't strike me as funny. There was nothing original here. Barbra and Dustin had a good time working together and clearly knew they were better than the material, but they couldn't save this movie.And shame on Tim Blake Nelson for making crap like this. Is he that desperate for money? I hope not. At least his part was tiny: I doubt that he spent a whole day doing it.",1,8,15,31 December 2004
The Mist," A Brilliant Failure
","Although this film has its flaws, the good parts are so good that it still gets eight stars. Until the last two minutes I'd have given it only five or six, but the ending (I'll not breathe a word) is so powerful, so moving, and so human that it got up to eight without breaking a sweat.The best thing is the performances. Not just the leads- everyone. This is the kind of ensemble work that is usually found only in live theater. One reader compared this to TWELVE ANGRY MEN. Good simile.The great flaw is that there are moments where these characters do things you just can't believe, and to be generous it runs forty minutes too long. Someone thought it would be a good idea to take 127 minutes to adapt a novella that was only 131 pages. Bad, bad mistake.For this reason there were too many points where my interest completely drifted. Scenes would end with a fade-out, as if a commercial was going to be inserted at that point. There were two segments that were desperately in need of heavy cutting.Early in the story David (the main character) and several other characters have seen a store employee killed by a huge beast with many tentacles. Brent, David's next door neighbor, is a lawyer from out of town who owns a vacation home in Castle Rock. Brent refuses to believe their story and thinks that this is all an elaborate practical joke.OK. Here these people are barricaded in a grocery store. They heard sirens outside, military and emergency vehicles have been rushing by, a bloodied man came in shouting that there's 'something' in the mist, the building has been shaken as if by a massive earthquake.And a man spoken of as destined for the Supreme Court thinks that this is a prank? Yep, those folks in Castle Rock sure know how to pull a practical joke.Then there's Mrs. Carmody, the local fruitcake who's a nut on religion. The third day of the siege she has a scene that seems inspired by the last act of THE CRUCIBLE and generates giggles when the author/director hoped for gasps. There are points where her monologues seemed to be song cues. There are enough monsters outside in the mist. A little bit of psycho woman goes a long way.Other than that the special effects are awesome, the acting great, there's a powerful and yet subtle musical score, and Darabont should be proud of himself.Yes, there are differences between the book and the film. Artistic license.Since the novella was published, America has been through 9/11, Katrina, and war. These things most likely informed Darabont's decision to develop the story the way he did.By the way, this is a movie movie. See it in a theater the way the good Lord intended on a big screen and an awesome sound system. The use of stereo, especially in the scene in the drugstore, added a lot to the experience.",8,0,2,30 November 2007
I Am Legend," Spectacular, Amazing, but Just Not All That Interesting
","Maybe I AM LEGEND is just immune to being filmed. This is the third try, and once again close but no cigar.Visually it's truly amazing. I'm very glad I saw it in a theater and didn't wait for the DVD. The scenes in an abandoned and overgrown Manhattan will take your breath away. Every time the action moved to the streets I kept thinking, How in the world did they do that? And that's just the problem. I shouldn't have been so aware of what a technical achievement it was, and wouldn't if there had been any surprises in the plot.It's very possible that I just see too many movies (I write reviews for two websites) and that if I were a 'civilian' I might have been more impressed.Will Smith's performance is commendable. If he'd had a stronger script to work with, this would have been even better.One of the most amazing things about the film was its use of sound. More accurately, the lack of sound. The director wasn't afraid to use silence or just natural sounds like wind and birds to create an effective mood. There is a very sparse musical score. In scenes where it would have been easy to have bombastic music telling us how to feel and response the film's makers trust the audience to make their own connections.One of the weakest story elements is the flashbacks to the hero's attempts (failed, of course) to get his family to safety. The studio spent $5 million and hired an army of extras to show the chaos of the evacuation. Nope, sorry. Didn't work. The only thing the flashbacks do is break the forward development of the story.Something I really missed was Neville's relationship with the chief vampire/mutant/whatever, who had been his friend before getting sick. There's a character referred to as Alpha Male, but we know nothing about him before he changed over. The monsters- almost entirely computer generated- are just the fast moving zombies from SILENT HILL and 28 DAYS LATER and RESIDENT EVIL and goodness knows how many other films.To me one of the most interesting things about DAWN OF THE DEAD (both versions) was, oddly enough, the costuming for the zombies. Nurse, nun, football player, bride, cap and gown, work uniform, Hari Krishna robes, we had a sense of who these people were before the died and came back as mindless killers.People look down their noses at THE LAST MAN ON EARTH because it was made in Italy on such a low budget, but it is still the most faithful adaptation of the book in many ways. The scene where Neville's wife returns after she has died was hugely effective.Maybe, as I said earlier, I AM LEGEND really is unfilmable. Having tried with varying results three times, maybe Hollywood will finally give up and move on to other things.",6,1,2,2 January 2008
The Game," Good beginning and ending, too long a middle
","THE GAME starts out so well that it's a shame it bogs down in the middle.  But the ending more than makes up for it. At two hours and eight minutes it runs way, way too long. It needs at least half an hour cut out of it.  If fact, more than an hour and a half could be cut and it could be run as the most expensive episode ever of THE TWILIGHT ZONE.But, as I said, it starts well.  Nicholas is an investment banker, played by Michael Douglas with his WALL STREET characterization and wardrobe intact.  Nicholas makes money.  Nicholas has money.  Nicholas wants more money. He lives alone in a huge house in San Francisco, presumably spending his evenings alone counting his money.Of course, his life is going to change.  That's the film's whole thesis.  Instead of changing in an unusual way, though, what happens blends elements of SECRET CINEMA (and this year's THE TRUMAN SHOW), THE WIZARD OF OZ, and A CHRISTMAS CAROL into a meatloaf of a movie made with leftover ingredients.Nicholas's birthday comes along, and he gets together for dinner with his brother Conrad (Sean Penn).  Conrad is the loose cannon of the family.  In and out of trouble, in and out of rehab.  He and Nicholas were both traumatized by their father's suicide many years ago, an event which will be strangely echoed in elements of THE GAME's most excellent climax.Conrad has a gift for Nicholas: a gift certificate for a once in a lifetime experience.  Nicholas submits to a battery of psychological and physical tests, and soon the game begins in earnest.Driving home one night, Nicholas finds a wooden clown in the driveway.  He carries the clown into the house, and later finds an important key in the clown's mouth.  While Nicholas watches the news on tv, reporter Daniel Schorr talks to Nicholas, calling him by name and alerting him to at least one hidden tv camera and microphone in the room. Before long paranoia is building in Nicholas's mind as the events become more and more bizarre; there are signifigant questions about what is real and what is paranoid fantasy. And there's a beautiful woman named Christine (Deborah Kara Unger) who changes from ally to enemy as many times as Eva Marie Saint did in NORTH BY NORTHWEST.From here on the movie is a series of Chinese boxes, with plot revelations coming at ten minute intervals just like subway trains- and with the same predictability.  A big theme of the story is that the bad guys have figured Nicholas's mind out so well that they can predict his every move, and his every move gets him trapped deeper and deeper.  That same element of predictability adversely impacts the movies seemingly endless second act.Nicholas is told that the game can be stopped at any time he wants, but Conrad confirms that it can't.  There's a strange conversation with Conrad in which I'd swear that about ten seconds of dialog is played twice, which gives the scene the feel of a dream, but it isn't.Nicholas starts out with a life of luxury and comfort; the opening scene of the third act finds him having to hitch-hike from Mexico to San Francisco, and plead with patrons in a roadside diner to give him a ride.After making a false start with the third film in the ALIEN series, director David Fincher came back like a champ with SE7EN, which I felt was by far the best film to come out that year.  THE GAME is a small step back for him, one from which he'll probably recover; if SE7EN hadn't blown me away so completely, I might be more forgiving of THE GAME.  Counting uncredited ones, a total of at least four writers worked on this film.  It shows.Lord know he has a great cast to work with here.  Sure, Michael Douglas's character is familiar to us in the first act as he plays the ruthless captain of industry, but as the story progresses we see a more human side of Nicholas. Sean Penn is always a welcome sight, even if he does have a rather small part here.  And Deborah Kara Unger is a good actress who may well have great things ahead of her.And that ending.  Wow, that ending.  It's not often that I'm shouting advice to onscreen characters when I watch a film on cable, but this time I was yelling 'Look out!' and 'No!  No!  NO!!!' loud enough that even though Michael Douglas couldn't hear me, people driving by our house probably did; hey, my family already thinks I'm strange, what the heck.And a very important thing that I can assure readers of without spoiling anything: the story is NOT a dream nor is it a halucination brought on by any drug.  I was braced for it to end with Nicholas sitting bolt upright in bed drenched with sweat mumbling about what a weird dream he'd had; I didn't like that plot device in INVADERS FROM MARS or any other movie except THE WIZARD OF OZ.Parents' note: THE GAME's R rating is almost entirely for language.  There's very little violence and no nudity or sex.  The R rating is to trick teenagers into thinking they'll see more than they are going to.  A skilled editor could (and should) have cut it to a PG in an afternoon.On a scale of five, Pops gives THE GAME four birthday cakes.",Null,1,3,30 August 1998
Evil Dead," Another Tired Remake, Soon to Be Forgotten
","Let me admit up front that CABIN IN THE WOODS, one of my favorite movies ever, pretty well tainted the well for this project.The original THE EVIL DEAD has been described as The Three Stooges Go to Hell. That's why I and so many others flat out love it.The remake has the feel of a project written and directed by a junior high drama class that miraculously raised $17 million with a bake sale and hired some really talented performers to act in it.Major themes are developed and then get lost in the gore and hardware. Mia (the main character) and her brother and three friends travel to an isolated cabin where she is going to try to get over her drug habit.Mia and her brother, David, have issues. Mia was the one who stayed home to take care of their mother while David was away pursuing his own interests. Either of these is a perfectly valid dramatic theme. Neither is developed. Instead, these ideas are abandoned for a festival of blood, gore, recycled images from Japanese horror movies, a chainsaw, and other hardware.The other characters are cruelly underwritten. Eric is there because someone needs to read the ancient curse out loud for the plot to kick into gear. Olivia is a nurse, there to take care of Mia's medical needs. Natalie is there because the plot calls for a fifth person to be present to fit the contours of the script.There are lots of good things about the film. It's well photographed, and deserves special commendation because in the outdoor scenes where it's raining the light is appropriate to a rainy day. Even in the 21st century we still see films in which rain is pouring down out of a cloudless sky in brilliant daylight. The musical score is effective. And the actors seem to have a lot of natural talent that's going to waste.But the project falters in comparison to the original. The actors plow their way through this with perfectly straight faces. Not a wink, a nod, an arched eyebrow, a tilt of the head. I can imagine them before each scene thinking, 'This script is absolute crap, but Sony Picture is paying me to do this so I'll keep a straight face and soldier through.'If you do watch this, stay around for a brief clip at the very end of the closing credits that raised my rating from a 2 to a 5. When I saw it I thought, 'That's what I'm talking about.'",5,3,4,22 March 2014
The Dark Knight," Way Too Much of a Good Thing
","Honestly, I wouldn't have seen THE DARK KNIGHT at all except I'd read so much about Heath Ledger's performance. It didn't take long before I was sorely missing Michael Keaton and Jack Nicholson. After a while I was nostalgic for Adam West and Cesar Romero. At about the two hour mark I realized that I really should have seen MAMA MIA or MIRRORS.THE DARK KNIGHT is a good ninety minute movie that's bloated to over two and a half hours. Christian Bale is probably a nice guy, kind to children and old ladies, but his performance varies between bland (as Bruce Wayne) and rotten (as Batman). Bale's speaking voice isn't all that distinctive, so there's no reason for him to try to disguise it.Heath Ledger did well with what was on the page, but the character emerges full grown from a vacuum. This man has gone through life looking like this for however many years and nobody has noticed him until he bursts onto the scene in Gotham? Warner Brothers spent $185,000,000 on this. It would have been better if they'd handed Christopher Nolan $18,500,000 and patted him on the head and told him to go make his movie.Best performance in the whole film: Chicago playing Gotham City. The movie looks great. The Cinemark where we saw THE DARK KNIGHT has digital projection, and however bored I might have been when the story bogged down the movie looked great.",6,6,12,16 August 2008
Super 8," I liked the ending....but not too much more
","What I learned from this movie: 1. If you're the wife/mother major male characters you're doomed to an early, messy death, but it will happen off-screen the day before the story starts. 2. The state of Ohio will hire someone with a dishonorable discharge from the Air Force for a teaching job in a nice little town. 3. A man can drive his truck down the railroad track and deliberately have a head-on collision with a train and survive, and be conscious and able to talk afterward. 4. I'm concerned about the safety of my town as a train carrying a monster will be coming through. Therefore, I'll go downtown to the train station and derail the train right there instead of letting it be derailed somewhere nobody cares about (New Jersey?). 5. Children and important characters cannot die. Death is only for peripheral or unsympathetic characters who do not see the error of their ways. 6. A town can, after a cataclysmic explosion, be isolated from the outside world. In return, the outside world will take no notice of this as none of these people have friends or relatives outside of this one tiny town in Ohio. 7. A character played by Noah Emmerich (a very good actor who deserves better) will appear, at first, to be kind and helpful. That will not last forever. 8. The American military is evil. Uh, no, they're all very stupid. Oh, they're really nice people after all. 9. Monsters from space are only nasty on the surface. Once you get to know them they're really nice (as long as they don't eat you). Well, yes, they do eat people, but only older character actors or women who wind up in caves with curlers in their hair. 10. A spaceship can be built around a water tower if magnetism attracts the contents of what seems to be a junkyard to it. It cannot achieve critical mass and accomplish its transformation, though, without one piece of mass-produced costume jewelry. Pixie dust seems to be optional. 11. Cars will fly toward said magnet like paper airplanes. Tanks are immune to this. 12. Theater stereo systems (and this is from someone drove two hours to see THE DOORS in a theater with really great sound when it was playing locally in mono) are really distracting when vehicles drive across the screen. Stereo should be reserved for explosions of various kinds and music, and (like jalapenos) using sparingly.",4,3,6,20 June 2011
Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone," Full of Sound and Fury, Signifying Nothing
","Cut about an hour out of the middle of HARRY POTTER and you'll have a pretty decent little movie.  As is, it's a bloated mess.  There's no heart to this, no characterizations.  It's just a product reel for all the special effects companies that worked on it.Seeing actors of the caliber of Alan Rickman and Robbie Coltrane and Maggie Smith wading through this, I wondered what went through their minds while they were performing.  They have to eat and pay bills like the rest of us, but the last time I felt so sorry for actors was watching Dudley Moore in SANTA CLAUS.There's no need for viewers to feel any emotional reaction.  The goshawful musical score by John Williams telegraphs everything to us and makes sleeping during the dull parts nearly impossible.This made a bundle opening weekend and the studio has started work on the sequel.  I wonder if business will hold at the same rate as the opening. It's playing on three screens at our local theatre and we didn't have to wait at all for tickets to the 7 pm show tonight (Saturday) and there were plenty of seats empty.",1,7,16,24 November 2001
Mr. & Mrs. Smith," As Bad as It Gets
","Since I saw this for free (borrowed DVD) I shouldn't gripe. But this was a pathetic a piece of 'entertainment' as I could imagine.When I was looking at the listing on the IMDb I found what went wrong. The screenplay went through over 50 drafts and a mob of screenwriters. Under better circumstances the project would have been put out of its misery and a new project found.Doug Liman used to be a director. Watch GO! if you don't believe me. But with THE BOURNE IDENTITY and this he's gone to the dark side of the force. Now he's making assembley line prefabs. Sad.There was one surprise in the movie. Seeing Vince Vaughn working in a piece of crap like this. Shame on you, Vince. You should know better. Brad and Angelina are self absorbed creatures of publicity who together have (almost) the intelligence of a clam. Vince is way too smart for this.",1,15,29,17 January 2006
War of the Worlds," Better the Second Time Around
","We watched this on DVD tonight, and I enjoyed it even more than I did when I saw it the opening weekend.The sound and special effects are awesome. Too often what looks great on the screen at the theatre doesn't look as good when you see it on video. The special effects in THE DAY AFTER TOMORROW suffered on the small screen and it was all too obvious when miniatures were cut in.This looked REAL every minute.The analogy with 9/11 is clear: Tom Cruise coming into the house covered with white dust after running for his life through the streets, the walls of buildings plastered with pictures of missing people, the desperate attempts of people to locate their loved ones.Sure, the first half is way better than the second and the whole basement scene could have been cut, and Dakota way overacted. But it was a thrill ride, and a darned good one. If I want serious drama the video store has a whole section of it. The scene in the car is amazing. I'm pretty literate about film making, but throughout this all I could think was Wow! How in the world did they do that? I'm sure that they didn't destroy a whole neighborhood in New Jersey and an elevated highway. Well, I guess they didn't. But, boy, it looked like the real thing.There was a lot I admired about this movie, but the biggest thing is that Tom Cruise did not save the world singlehandedly. He takes out exactly one of the however many thousand warships the aliens have. The character is an average Joe trying to keep himself and his family alive against rough odds. Way to go, Tom. I'm sure the suits who run the studio suggested that the script be rewritten so that the high dollar leading man could wipe out the aliens himself. Mr. Spielberg, thank you.If this had been about twenty-five minutes shorter, it would have gotten those other two stars.",8,0,1,22 December 2005
There Will Be Blood," Tremendous
","I can't think of another movie I've seen in several years that had me in its grip so completely from beginning to end. We've heard about what great work Daniel Day Lewis does. He well deserves the Oscar. But when will there be an Oscar for casting? Every single person in every single scene with him rises to the occasion and matches Lewis pitch perfect note for pitch perfect note. Unlike historical dramas from other decades, the crowd scenes look as if Anderson took his camera back a hundred years. Someone coming upon stills from the film would think that they were just crowd photographs from the early 1900's.The one thing I found very peculiar is that this is rated R. Huh? I'm a Southern Baptist who regularly votes Republican. But if I'd come upon this film cold without knowing the rating I'd have guessed G or maybe PG because there's the mildest of profanity (damn is used a few times), no sex, no nudity, and the violence is appropriately handled for the situation and very restrained. That this should have the same rating as HOSTEL or THE HILLS HAVE EYES is worse than ridiculous.",10,3,7,1 March 2008
Music and Lyrics," Drew Really Needs to Grow Up
","This makes two stinkers in a row. Granted, it's not as nausea inducing as FEVER PITCH- which I actively hated. But Drew is making movies like this and the not all that great DUPLEX either because she has no judgment about what scripts will play well or because she knows there are enough people who will see a bad movie just because she's in it.MUSIC AND LYRICS has one of the worst screenplays in the hundred year history of movies. There's no relationship to human speech or human behavior. Characters spew vast chunks of exposition giving us background about characters and events we're really not all that interested in.The situation is, at best, odd. Drew plays a plant girl- she goes to people's apartments to water their plants, a job which I'm sure can support an adult in comfort in Manhattan- who gets involved with a washed up singer who was a big star...when she was ten years old. Her romance with a man sixteen years older than she is continues Hollywood's endless exploitation of younger woman/older man relationships.Characters appear and disappear with no logic. The script seems to have been rewritten about twenty times because there's no flow to it. There's a really good performance here that actually gets what few laughs are elicited from the audience. Kristen Johnson plays Drew's older sister with a manic energy and in the few scenes she's in almost brings the movie to life. Although this is billed as a comedy, the fairly large audience we saw it with sat in stony silence most of the time.The movie this is closest to in spirit is SAW. Instead of guilty people trapped in a torture chamber MUSIC AND LYRICS gives us hugely talented performers speaking dialog that sounds nothing like human speech in situations that strain credibility.Grow up, Drew. You can't get by on the audience's good will toward you much longer. You have a heart, a mind, and a soul, but you're being reduced to nothing but a mass of unkempt hair and irritating mannerisms.",1,4,13,24 February 2007
Final Destination," An honest to goodness thriller
","Goodness knows I'm not in the targeted demographic for FINAL DESTINATION: I'll turn 54 next July.  But I really enjoyed this movie because it had tremendous direction and a cast of talented young actors, and dealt with some weighty philosophical issues about destiny and free will.My wife and I were the only people over thirty that I could spot at tonight's screening; ads for this movie probably make it look like a teen slasher, which it certainly isn't.Hardcore horror fans will note that lots of the character names are also names of classic genre actors and directors.  This reminds us that the films creators (most of whom are involved in one way or another with tv's THE X-FILES) have a respect and reverence for those who came before them.I won't deal with any of the plot details, because I wouldn't want to spoil any of the surprises.  Because none of these actors got $20 million for being in this film, anything can happen to anyone at any point in time.Take a chance and check this one out.",Null,1,1,24 March 2000
