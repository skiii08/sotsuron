Kill Bill: Vol. 2," Oh, God... Yes.
","Sweet Jesus. The entire cast and crew did a GREAT JOB! The story lines, the background information on the Bride, as well as the other Vipers, answered so many *important* questions I had after seeing Vol. 1, that I..... I can't even describe this movie. Just... see it... now. Right now. We just got back about 10 minutes ago and I'm still giddy and lacking any vocabulary a normal functioning adult should possess. There are a few minor goofs, like the Bride's hair length and the calendar in the titty bar, but those are rather minor and just add to the enjoyment of watching this film. It is our considered opinion that the six step thing is not a goof, but rather a show of strength, so y'all can just hush right up about that. Quentin and Uma.... Thank You.",10,1,3,23 April 2004
50 First Dates," Sandler regains my favor!
","After Anger Management, Eight Crazy Nights, and Punch Drunk Love, I thought Sandler had gone the way of Carrey and Schneider...turning to movies that only played off their stereotypes.BUT, my sister and I watched this last night, and it was brilliant. It was the good parts of Big Daddy with the good parts of Wedding Singer, along with some other good parts that were pretty much all-new!The reasoning my be medically unsound, but the way they DEALT with it was extremely cool, which was my biggest skepticism about going into the movie.Its good, and makes one feel fuzzy inside. It's also hysterically funny (except maybe for Rob Schneider's Island-Cholo accent...which is just...odd).",10,0,0,14 February 2004
