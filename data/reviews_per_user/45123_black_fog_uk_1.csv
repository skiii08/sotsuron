Kill Bill: Vol. 2," Crap!
","The first Kill Bill was an original, high-octane offering and I was eagerly waiting for the second installment. What a disappointment. Kill Bill 2 is a very long film, to long in fact. Not enough action but more than enough meaningless dialogue. Uma Thurman is impressive as the Bride and Carradine is full of charisma, but the film is just boring. Tarantino should have left this material where it belongs - editing room floor. This film is basically a wimpy soap opera, with swords.. Crap!",Null,0,1,30 April 2004
