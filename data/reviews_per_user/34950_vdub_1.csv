Requiem for a Dream," Did Project D.A.R.E. sponsor this crap?
","I cannot believe the high ratings this movie has gotten. This is one of the most superficial and one-dimensional films I have ever seen. I grant you that Ellen Burstyn did a fine job, but what about the rest of the story? It seemed to me to be something Nancy Reagan might have written and produced. The seeming demise of Harry and Marion at the end showed how little the actors and Aronofsky know about the descent into drug addiction.What was really disappointing was that although Aronofsky demonstrated interesting techniques in 'Pi,' he never really developed them in this film.
I don't understand why everyone was so deeply affected by this film.",1,44,82,23 January 2003
