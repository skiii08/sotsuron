The Avengers," An entertaining movie, but waaaay over hyped !
","And so the most awaited movie of the year, the Avengers is released, and I went with the whole family to see it !! Not sure why anyone would come here and read some reviews about it, i mean let us face it, you already made your decisions to go and see it, you just want to make sure !! a hugely marketed movie like this will always attract people to go and see it, it is very hard to ignore all the big fuss and all those giant billboards and adds of it everywhere !! I went in with huge expectations, and it had to be said that the movie did not let me down,however, i believe it is way too overrated and over hyped ! the movie starts out very slowly, and for the first hour or so, i felt some boredom creeping in, or was it my exuberant mood and impatience for the action to starts ? there was just too much stretch of boring speech and slow scenes of the gathering of the Avengers in the first hour or so.I was expecting a roller coaster of action / adventure scenes from start to finish and i guess i was slammed in the face by the slow built up in the beginning. my two younger daughters ' 5 and 6 ' certainly got bored and fidgety, which added to my frustration.Having said that, the movie is a success in what its trying to do, which is gathering all those super heroes together in one film, it was entertaining and enjoyable over the whole run. I just thought that the plot was nothing special, just your average cartoonish plot of an evil villain who wants to rule the world, the serious dialog involving the main plot was boring and empty with no interest in it, however, when the funny scenes and dialog jump in, its really enjoyable and pure fun.Each of the characters had an almost equal screen time, although, the roles seems uneven with the highest importance going to Iron man, and a lot of time went into trying to explore the Black Widow and Hawkeye relationship but failing in adding any strong background about those two characters, did not feel or care much about them.the Hulk was also sort of put on the side, not clear what his involvement was into the team, supposedly he knows much about the Gama radiation, but i was puzzled with him, at times he was completely out of control and not distinguishing between the heroes and Villains, and other times, he was completely submissive to his fellow super heroes.It was clear that iron man was running the show, maybe the leader some how, which i liked since he is among my favorites, his quarrels with Captain America were fun and there seemed liked a power struggle between the two !!Thor was another character put on the side, did not have a big impact other than his brother being the villain !! Sameul L Jackson's character Nick Fury was the most annoying as the leader of the Avengers, his speeches and his overall role were useless and annoying, very frustrating and if i were a super hero, i wouldn't join a team that he leads. just an empty character.certain parts of the plot were lame and silly, like when a certain character in the movie was killed, and his death was the ultimate reason for the Avengers to finally join together was a bit too corny.Now the good parts !! because once the action starts, it really is brilliant !! some very impressive visuals and solid action scenes with the involvement of the Avengers, especially the final fight in the end, it was superb, although not entirely original ' some similarities to the last Transformers movie ', still very enjoyable and the kids certainly were impressed and glued to the big screen with excitement.So in Summary, the Avengers is not the best movie ever made, and not in anyway a masterpiece, however, it is entertaining and is original as the first film with multiple superheroes in it. the first half gets a 6.5 out of 10, but then the 2nd half of the movie gets a solid 9 !! my 8 year old son says its a 10 !! :)Moebardi.blogspot.com",7,3,10,6 May 2012
Sucker Punch," Phenomenal ..
","I came out of the theater thinking, WOW, what a visual treat that was. A definitely enjoyable movie to watch. the story in short is that of a young girl whom her mom dies early on, and she is sent to a mental institution, and it seems dark matters are taking place, she makes new friends quickly and decides to find a plan out.A simple story that Snyder managed to execute it with style. the editing stood out for me, there was a balanced mixture of music, action, special effects and sound effects here. and then there was the color gradient for the action sequences that gave a surreal feel to it. Im crazy about stop-motion action like the one from 300, so I loved seeing a lot of that here, the action was something like that of a video game or Animation. again, more mixing of fast paced action with slow motion sequences which was an adrenaline pumping experience.I was also impressed with the girls casted here, the lead role was played by a young actress that i have never known before, but she did an awesome job, and her fine facial features were perfect for the role, she looked innocent yet ready to kick ass. the rest of the cast were also pretty decent and good.even the art design, the fashion design and the CGI were top notch and looked so professional and real. the way the girls dressed during the action sequences were unique and the weapons they used were really awesome.So this was a really enjoyable movie for me, phenomenal in every way, however it felt a little short from becoming a masterpiece. and the reason is, the PG-13 rating. During the action scenes, i felt something was missing, and then i noticed it was missing blood splatter. Im not big fan of gore, but just adding a little blood splatter or organ dismemberment would have added more to this in my opinion. Another problem was, during the action scenes the took place in the dream like world, while it was amazing, it lacked intensity and depth. and they probably should have worked on the story more to make the transition to the dream world more realistic and hence more intensity, depth and care for the girls as they fought their way through. it was a bit too simple.In the end though, I thought this was a successful movie, original and a visual treat combined with a decent story done with style. I won't be surprised if this gets an Oscar nomination in the technical categories like Art design or Sound effects. go see it !",8,6,15,26 March 2011
John Wick," Brilliant Action film, one of my favorite Keanu Reeves' films
","This film is brilliant, none stop action from start to finish. Keanu Reeves is back here, proving that he has all it takes to compete with the best action film stars like Jason Statham and Liam Neeson.the movie has a simple revenge plot that is executed to perfection, your typical retired Hit-man forced back into action after a Russian mob kill his dog.the action scenes are out of this world, very well choreographed action sequences that resembles something out of a video game, think Call of Duty! the choreography of the scenes and the way John Wick handles a gun during gun fights are superb and very unique. Keanu deserves lots of credit for his talent in action scenes and delivering some of the stunts him self. his acting has improved, yes we all know he's not award winning actor, but he still delivers a lot in terms of charisma and character that he brings to the screen. this is definitely one of my favorite Keanu Reeves' films, and my best action film of the year. i strongly recommend this film to all action fans, Keanu fans, and any movie fans looking for some solid entertainment. i plan to go watch this a second time in the theaters!",10,6,19,28 October 2014
Megamind," An enjoyable animation for adults and kids alike
","I watched this movie tonight with my wife and kids, we really enjoyed this a lot, i found myself actually attached to the characters and intrigued by the plot. i also found myself entertained with the action scenes. my kids also enjoyed it, more so than they enjoyed the lame Alpha and Omega. I guess most of you know what the plot is, so i won't go into it. it is just fun and involves super powers and super heros battles. most of you are probably reading this to decide whether to go and see it or not, let me say, go ahead, it is worth it and enjoyable !! And i also like to add, we watched it in 2D, so im not sure how it is in 3D, but im assuming just as good if not better.",9,99,127,5 November 2010
Underworld Awakening," Action packed, a Roller-Coaster ride !!
","Just finished watching Underworld : the Awakening on Blu ray, it was much better than expected. I really don't understand the negative reviews, although, some of it where actually more of a praise than a criticism. for example : some negative reviewers were saying that it was like a video game !! well, i think that is a good thing !! the movie is action packed, and is only interrupted with few scenes of dialog, does not waste time on useless dialog like most action movies now do, we jump immediately into the action that never stops !! it was like a roller-coaster fun ride with continuous twists and turns, some very well executed action scenes, brilliant gun fights, slow motion action and even fist fights.you have giant monsters, werewolves and of course vampires !! Kate Beckinsale was amazing here as Selene, and here we find things have turned and humans are the enemy, a new twist added to the plot and new characters are brought in.for me, i really did enjoy this one more than all the previous ones, because this one does not waste time and jump into the action as i have already mentioned.i recently watched the Avengers as well in theaters, and i was hoping that film would have been as action packed as this one, but it wasn't and lots of time was wasted on boring dialog and slow build up.I really liked Underworld the Awakening, very enjoyable and entertaining. if you guys were expecting more of a story and lots of dialog, then you should go and watch a Drama and leave the action to its real fans !! a solid 9 out of 10, not to be missed by action fans.you can also check my Avengers review here : moebardi.blogspot.com",9,2,5,9 May 2012
Interstellar," Ahead of its time, and not in a good way
","Just came back from the Theater after watching Interstellar, wow what a ride. there are so many talking points, so many twist and turns and it has to be one of the toughest films to rate.let me start by saying, the film was excellent in terms of Cinematography, direction and Effects.It also had a brilliant twist at the end, a very unique concept of dimensions and time, however, that same concept was a bit of a stretch, it was all based on theories and is just way too difficult to comprehend and ultimately believe, which weakens the films in my opinion.I felt lost in the details and events happening in the film because most of it was based on too much scientific talk, so i was lost in translation so to speak! Had difficulty knowing what was actually going on at certain points.I guess Nolan was concentrating on the Drama here, on the emotions, however, i still think not paying attention to the details weakened the film. Another problem, was the dialog! several times during the film and at key moments, the dialog was not clear, making it even harder to understand key parts of the plot! not sure if it was a sound editing problem or the writing or was it the actor's delivery of the line!The movie does succeed in terms of the drama and the emotions, i particularly loved the relationship arch between Cooper and his Daughter Murphy. acting was superb from most involved.so to sum it all up, i thought the film was good and entertaining, but suffers from dialog problems and too much Science talk, it was like it was too much ahead of its time, in a bad way. perhaps, in the future, once we discover the 5-D physics, we might appreciate this film more.",7,1,3,19 November 2014
Star Wars: Episode IX - The Rise of Skywalker," A disappointed Star Wars fan
","Disappointing Star Wars film, possibly the weakest of the Franchise. The first two films of this new trilogy were very good, this one just falls short. Every Star Wars film usually adds something new, a character, a creature, a new villain or a unique scene, this one adds nothing. Its very predictable and many scenes are forced. Filled with ClichÃ©s and the final battle is a copy paste from Return of the Jedi.Even the characters are boring in this one, lacks tension and emotion that were present in the previous two. There are a few highlights here and there but generally underwhelming. Not even a decent light saber fight is in here.
A Star Wars film to forget !",4,17,29,20 December 2019
American Sniper," Weak film, average at best!
","I am really starting to believe that the Academy Awards are corrupt and they tend to nominate films and directors based on names and not based on the actual movie. still they do make some worthy nominations, but films like American Sniper being nominated really pisses me off!! OK, so i understand that its based on a real American hero, and that is nice, but telling the story was terrible here, the film fails as a motion picture to watch, yet it still gets the nomination for an Oscar for best picture. One thing i know for sure, it won't win!!the film is a series of clichés, one after the other, totally predictable from start to finish, and rips off many war films lacking in originality to the story. the whole film feels so familiar and you would seem to feel you have watched it before in countless movies and TV shows before, the whole American soldier struggling with emotions and effects of war, the PTSD, just lame and done soooo many times before, its old!I also understand that at times, you need to retell stories, and remake certain genres of movies and reintroduce them with a new twist or take, but here, the visions of Eastwood as director lacks big time and he does not add anything special or worthy to the film.Bradely Cooper does a good job, he is a good actor. but again, his role here was typical and the storyline did not help.some nice action sequences here and there, but nothing that tops a Call of duty game action scene.the whole film feels empty, it suffers from void. and despite the prolonged character development, you still don't get strongly attached to the characters, especially the wife who keeps complaining that Chris is always away, and when he is at home, he is not really there!! we really don't see her suffering, and so she ends up being a whining lame wife. A weak film, predictable, average at best.",4,34,80,19 January 2015
Bridesmaids," A cute Comedy movie that could have been a little a better
","Let me start by saying that I adore Rose Byrne, I just think she has grown into a really talented actress, and in Bridesmaid here, she played her role to perfection. I loved her in the Horror movie Insidious released just few months ago, and always been a fan in Damages.Bridesmaids tells the story of Annie, a single middle aged woman struggling with her own life when her best friend Lillian gets engaged and assigns Annie as her maid of honor. Worried about losing her best friend and pressured by leading the bridesmaid, things start to spiral out of control. And to make things worse, she has to compete with Lillian's new friend, the rich and always competitive Helen ( played by none other than Rose Byrne ) who seems to be trying to steal Lillian's friendship. The movie has plenty of laugh out loud moments, very hilarious, funny and at times disgusting scenes. It came out as a real fresh Comedy that I enjoyed most parts of. The characters were lovable, funny and interesting to follow, and the actresses playing them were very good. The problem I found with Bridesmaid was in the editing, it seems it was done in a rush and so appeared choppy and inappropriate. For example, in an early scene when Annie was making a speech, she was holding a wine glass, and in that same scene, the glass is quickly shifted from the right hand to the left hand then back to the right hand. And there were many other editing problems I noticed that I won't go through here, but it was obvious. Also I thought some scenes were a bit ridiculous and too long. The whole movie running time was a bit too long for me as they could have easily cut some unnecessary scenes.In summary, a pretty decent and fresh Comedy with laugh out loud moments and funny characters that falls just short from being great with some ridiculous scenes, it drags a bit and was a bit too long in my opinion.",7,2,5,17 May 2011
Insidious," Borrows a lot from other films, yet stands out on its own..enjoyable Horror movie
","Just came back from watching an advanced screening of ' Insidious ' tonight with my wife, we both liked it a lot. When it comes to Horror films, there are always the same Horror formulas which film makers really can't escape when making a Horror, because there aren't much they can work with and they are limited to that same formula. So Insidous borrows many of its ideas from other Horror films, one comes to mind is 1982 film ' Poltergeist ', but here we have a family of 5, Patrick Wilson and Rose Byrne play the parents of 2 boys and a little baby girl. after a slow build up, a small accident occur and their older son falls into comma or so it seems !! soon after, weird things start to happen at the house and the mother suspects evil spirits are in the house !! A simple story that as i said was done before, however, I thought it was done differently here, there was a better atmosphere and some elements of the plot stood out as being fresh that made this film unique somehow. As scares goes, this was definitely scary, there were several moments in the film that gave me goosebumps !! there were also the classic jump out of your seat moments too. Some scenes were creepy and the mixing of music and sounds were done superbly to add to the Horror. so the movie does deliver as far as scares are concerned.Acting was superb too, all cast involved did a very good job, particularly Rose Byrne whom I'm fond of after watching her in the excellent TV show ' Damages '. Patrick Wilson was also good here.the atmosphere was creepy, the director managed to catch nice footage of the house and other elements of the film. So in summary, get ready and grab your loved ones and go catch this movie this Friday, it entertains. very enjoyable and scary, and even though it borrows ideas from other Horror films, it never imitates, it stand out as a new and fresh take on traditional Horror !!",8,135,222,29 March 2011
The Hangover Part II," A better experience than the first ..
","Comedy is not one of my favorite movie genres, i am more of a Thriller or Drama type of guy. however, i like to watch Comdies every now and then. When i first watched the first Hangover movie, i was not impressed much and i thought that it was over hyped and over rated. I was really puzzled by the over praise the first movie got, i thought maybe it was ruined for me because i saw too many clips before i watched the movie itself, and the trailer really did give away a lot of key moments. So this time around, i avoided watching the trailer, and avoided reading or hearing anything of the new Hangover 2, and i guess it paid off, because i felt that i enjoyed this more than the first for sure.one of the things i liked about part 2 is that it takes place in Thailand, i thought that events happening in unfamiliar territory is always fun, and the director captured some very lovely scenes of the city adding a nice flavor to the film.I was also surprised with several scenes that were unexpected to me, ' again probably because i avoided the trailer ', the story was fun and of course similar to the first, but kept me interested enough. i liked the action scenes they added to the plot, made it a bit more lively.As i mentioned earlier, im not a big fan of comedy, and i thought many scenes that were suppose to be funny ended up being ridiculous and lame, but that is just me. however, there were some scenes that were actually funny and i laughed out loud at.I like Bradly Cooper, and Ed helms was funny. I however, find Zach Galifiankis a bit annoying, and he seems to play the same character in all his movies ' Due date ? ', but the Asian guy Jeong seems even more annoying, they both don't seem naturally funny to me. I loved the Monkey though !! :)to end up, i thought it was a better experience for me than the first, some funny scenes and a good enough plot. Loved the Thailand scenes, and the monkey. enjoyable, i would recommend this.",7,0,2,9 June 2011
Super 8," Boring and slow paced .. repeated story
","Wow, what a mess !! I was really expecting much much more from J.J Abrams and Spielberg, instead, i was slammed in the face with this awful film.So where do i begin ? the story ? nothing original here what so ever, and i understand that they meant to bring us back to the old days, but even then they should have had to invent something new to add to the story. some people in here are happy that it is so like E.T !! but does that really make it a good movie ? if we really want E.T, why not just make a sequel ? and if i really want to go back and enjoy the old movie days, i can always visit them on DVD, i could just watch E.T on DVD. Don't get me wrong, i would love to see something that brings back the old movie making style, but i want that to be executed better with a touch of originality.in short, a group of kids witness a train wreck, after which something mysterious is unleashed and is terrorizing the small town. meanwhile, we have the kids themselves struggling with their own family problems and relations..' Sigh ' .. very slow paced, boring for the most part and filled with cliché characters, moments and scenes. the kids do a decent job in acting, but i gotta blame the bad writing in making such cliché characters, and typical over-acted relations. I never connected with the Parent-child relationships here, i never felt it. however, i did feel for the love and admiration created between Joe and ALice.they tried to make an adventure type of film with thrills, something like the Goonies, but i just didn't feel the tension or thrills. typical tension arising scenes like when a trapped door won't open, or when a lighter is not igniting are a bit cheap for the smart movie goers nowadays. one scene where the kids running in the middle of the suburbia during a heavy military firing was meaningless, had no point other than trying to create and adventure type of scene, but really was ridiculous and out of context.classic jump of your seat moments were frequent here, and were pretty predictable and lame, however, i did see a couple of senior people watching jump during these scenes, but is that the target audience for this movie ? while i was watching, i tried to figure out who is this film meant to be for ? i guess they were probably thinking a Horror film for kids and seniors. Another big problem with this movie, was the sound effects, it was loud, a bit too loud !! i mean i love it when the movie theater shakes during action scenes and so on, but here, they seemed to have crossed the limits on how loud they can go, it was really too loud it was annoying and uncomfortable.there were also other problems involving the plot, but i won't go through them so i won't ruin or spoil the movie for others, although, i gotta say you are not missing anything if you give this one a skip.the fact that JJ Abrams and Spielberg are behind this movie was a shock to me, i really can't wrap my head around this fact, sorry guys but you really screwed up here, i was waiting for some surprise, a twist, something to shock me at the end..but it never happened and this ended up a slow paced, boring, familiar story with cliché characters, that I'm sorry to say, i won't recommend to anyone.",3,7,14,12 June 2011
Limitless," the ' Magic Pill ' ..
","In my line of work, I see a lot of people complaining of poor memory, low energy, inattention, poor concentration, etc.. And some of these people come to me and ask for some sort of ' pill ' to cure some or all of those symptoms, we in the medical field call such a fantasy pill, the Magic pill, that can magically treat and cure all these problems. I always reply to my clients, unfortunately, no such pill exists. the concept of this movie is just that, about that Magical pill, and what if it does exist, what would happen ? This is all I'm going to say about the plot, because I maintain the idea that giving so much about movie plots could ruin them.Let me go straight to answer the question that brought you here in the first place, should you see this movie or not ? the answer is : YES ! I highly recommend this, the execution of this ' Magic pill ' idea was brilliant here, the direction and cinematography were top notch, and I was surprised by Bradly Cooper's performance, it seems he is slowly improving and making a big name for himself in the entertainment business.I am a big fan of De niro, so it was one of the main reasons i went to see this, however, his role was relatively small here, and the real star is Cooper.the story moves in a very good pace, does not slow down or feel dull at any point. and there is also some cool action added to the mix making it a real joy.So there you go, stop reading other reviews about Limitless and just head to the theater and watch it this weekend, it is Awesome !!",8,0,1,23 March 2011
Thor," A mixed bag
","I went into Thor with high expectations, and i thought it was an enjoyable movie and a decent start to this summer movie lineup, however, Thor could have been much much better. It was sort of a mixed bag, a mishmash of positives and negatives. the acting for one was not perfect by most of the cast, apart from Anthony Hopkins who plays his role to perfection. the rest of the cast including Natalie Portman were average at best. I was specially surprised at Natalie Portman's character, which was very shallow and had no strong or solid presence on the plot or on screen.speaking of Natalie Portman, i thought her romance with Thor was rushed and did not sink in for me, i really did not feel the passion. the relationship between them was clichéd and typical. Did they really just add her to the cast for marketing purposes ? shame, shame !! Most characters did not develop enough, probably there were too many characters to go through in the movie's short running time, all felt rushed. I specially did not feel any emotions towards Thor friends, they were like strangers to me !!!the plot was simple, and moved in a some what good pace, though i did feel it dragged a bit midway, probably felt more during those supposedly romantic moments between Portman and Thor.the movie started with a big Roar, some very awesome action scenes with amazing special effects and sound effects, which made me think that i was in for an amazing ride for the rest of the movie, which was a false thought. but i gotta say, i was very impressed with that opening action sequence.I won't say too much about the ending, let's just say, it did not satisfy me, it lacked the big climax feelings and in action. the whole movie felt lacking in action, i mean other than that opening action sequence, action was minimal. which really made me feel like the movie was missing something, like it was a bit empty.So overall, it was worth the admission ticket for sure, some decent performances and decent plot, mixed with some very enjoyable moments and top notch special effects and big budget sets and CGI. but lacked in character development and had it's share of some cliché moments. watch it and judge yourself, but don't expect a perfect movie or a master piece.",7,0,2,6 May 2011
The Wolf of Wall Street," Poor over the top performance by Dicaprio, boring overlong movie
","So Dicaprio is nominated for an Oscar for his role here ? What rubbish, while his acting is about OK, he does carry his role over the top, he over acts in too many of his scenes, seemed unbelievable. Always over screaming, shouting out loud speeches with inflated neck veins that does not seem to look real or in context with the scene, I also did not like his performance in Great Gatsby, is he losing his touch ? The academy does not seem to think so! The same goes with Jonah Hill, ridiculous over the top acting made to be funny but ended up lame.The plot is nothing original, the rise and fall of a powerful man, have we not seen that so many times before ? Similar movies include Blow, Scarface and even the Spanish film starring Javier Bardem called Golden Balls. Overlong run time filled with lame rubbish over the top sex and drug scenes that seemed to take forever. I really cannot find anything good about this film, except a few laugh out loud scenes and a promising start that took a strong curve downwards as the movie progressed, 2 1/2 hours of torture.Still the movie gets Oscar nominations including best picture and best actor, what a disgrace!! Shame on you Academy !!Do not waste your money nor time on this.",3,27,48,26 January 2014
X-Men: First Class," X-men go Bond-esque ..
","I must admit, i am not a big fan of X-men, I never read the comics nor did i watch the old cartoons when i was a kid. I have always been a Batman fan. Even the first X-men movies i watched, i enjoyed but never turned into a hard core fan. But all that might change because of this movie, it is pretty good and all those other reviewers are spot on about how good this movie is.first of, the story and writing is top notch, the script is very good, unlike most comic book movies where the scripts are not usually executed right. and it is done with style, loved the whole Bond-esque feel to it, at times i felt like watching a James Bond movie with Mutants, a lot of Spy like elements and Villains wanting to destroy the world.Then comes the Cast, i must say one of the best group of actors picked in a movie, especially Michael Fassbender as Magneto and James Mcavoy as Professor X, both carried the movie and shined. Also, Rose Byrne was good here :) speaking of Bond, i believe Michael Fassbender would be perfect as the next James Bond !!the other younger actors were good too but overshadowed with the two main leads.Action was solid, and special effects were stunning, also sound effects were amazing and in certain scenes the whole theater was shaking. the movie however fell just short from being perfect because of the smaller characters and mutants, their mutations were a bit ridiculous for me. but that is just me ..In short, a very good movie, professionally written with a great script, wonderful cast and executed with style. very entertaining. go watch it.",8,0,2,5 June 2011
The Purge," Tense and enjoyable experience with a brilliant idea, has it weaknesses but generally a very good movie
","the idea of this movie is just brilliant, it takes the theory of ' Risk Reduction ', which is the method used in legalizing things like for example Cannabis or those pushing to legalize prostitution to reduce harm associated with not legalizing them. here the writers take Criminal acts in general and legalize them once a year for 12 hours, where all criminal acts are legalized, in the aim to reduce criminal behavior in general in society. a very interesting concept and one that could allow for several plot lines and several films could be made out of it, no wonder there is a sequel in the works ' according to IMDb '.Viewers seem to be split in terms of the idea and some think it is ridiculous, i do not see it that way, you never know with how policies are moving, something like this might happen. my only take, is that people tend to be impulsive, and waiting several months to a year to take things into their own hands is a long time, people cannot wait, i would say it would be more logical if they made the purge once every two months or even less.what ever you think of it, the idea is just brilliant and very interesting.now the script and characters seemed a bit extreme, and some characters seem to make very silly decisions, but nothing that would make this movie as awful as some on here are saying.Minor spoilersthe boyfriend of the daughter wants to take advantage of the Purge to kill her father just because he does not want them to be together was a bit too extreme, and why would that be a solution ? would the daughter approve of that or even want to be with him after killing her father ?a silly part for sure.END Spoileri continued watching because the idea was so intriguing and the director managed to create the right atmosphere to keep viewers interested despite the lack in certain areas in characters. and the movie did not let me down, was pretty good and kept getting more interesting as the plot moved forward and the family gets targeted by a group of Psychopaths.there were of course several plot holes, for example, allowing for a purge, criminals might use that to take down a whole city down and so after the purge, chaos would persist. for example : destroying police property or cutting down communications. another is people might kill outside the Purge hours and could still get away with it by lying about it that it was done during.the movie also concentrated on the social aspects and took away all psychological aspects of human behavior, people are aggressive generally and tend to turn into animals in the absence of civilization, but not all people are that way. certain individuals just cannot kill because it is not part of their genes to do so. the film pictures all people as killers, i thought it was a bit of an over generalization.Spoiler ahead for example, the neighbors are feeling envy and jealous of the family because they are making profit and showing it off, but is that enough to justify killing them ? maybe robbing their house, destroying their property, stealing, but Killing ? that was another example of extreme.END Spoilerthe movie does have many arguing points for discussion and you cannot find two people agreeing on it, but that is what is so good about it, it makes good for discussion and is interesting in many ways. the thrills, intrigue, and even some action and drama are all found here and gives and enjoyable experience.do not listen to the negative reviews here, watch this original film and judge yourself. i certainly enjoyed it with its weaknesses. recommended and i rate it 8 out of 10",8,0,0,4 November 2013
The Hunger Games: Catching Fire," Very good sequel, Lawrence is amazing
","Why are there so many people hating this movie ? when i first heard of the Hunger Games and the hype surrounding it, i was not at all excited or interest in it. However, being an avid movie fan, i had to watch the first one, and found it pretty good with good action and decent story, not to mention the excellent acting.Still, i did not become a fan of the series, and so when this second movie came out, i did not rush to watching it, until i watched the Blu ray, and i was just attached to the TV from start to finish, it was full of intrigue and visually stunning. the Character of Katnis played brilliantly by Jennifer Lawrence was interesting to follow as she developed from being the scared girl who follow rules to stronger girl.people here seems to miss the point of the movie, yes it might feel incomplete because it seems to be one part of the next upcoming movies and that is why people seem to rate it poorly. the point of the movie is actually focused on Katnis the character, as she develops and grow in so many ways.people seem to see it as a repetition of the first, but there were plenty of differences, this one was sharper and deeper, sorry to say some have failed to see that. this might come as a surprise to some, but i found this one to better than the first movie ! the Games were fun and though did seem rushed, again for the purpose of the bigger picture, however, decent action scenes, and an atmospheric game arena the resembles the tropic jungles.and everyone seems to rate the acting highly, which is exactly the case, each actor playing their roles perfectly, most seem comfortable to return back to their roles from the first film and seem to have grown into it.Visually it is also stunning to look at. OK so it is not a masterpiece, and this coming from a person who is not even a fan of the movies, but it is an excellent movie not to be missed. i thought the 2 hours and 26 minutes rushed by quickly.just like Star Wars or Lord of the Rings, this film is only part of a whole and cannot be rated accurately without seeing the whole series, it does manage to set up for the next one, and now im excited to see the next. Will i become a fan of the series ? i might as im not far out from that.check it out",9,0,14,22 February 2014
Transformers: Dark of the Moon," A Hollywood joke !
","So i read an article a couple of months ago about how Micheal Bay and Spielberg worked on improving this new movie over the atrocious film that was Revenge of the fallen. And while i have noticed some improvements over the sequel, this one still fell short from becoming a good movie in my eyes.So many wrong things about this movie that i don't know where to start, probably, the most thing that annoyed me, was the silly and lame humor. very silly and unrealistic characters that don't seem to take the events surrounding them seriously, especially Turturro's and Malkovic's characters, such jokes !! i don't get why someone like Malkovic agrees to do a character like that ?! And what about the embarrassing Ken Jeong ?! involved in a disaster scene that was meant to be funny !!!Then comes the typical cliché characters in the American military, all pumped up and Rambo like macho men with big huge guns and gear running around and kicking A** !! lame !!the Robots themselves are ridiculous with their multi English accents, some speak American accents while other speak Irish and British ! what is up with that ?So here, Sam has left his old connections with the Autobots and is starting a new life looking for a job, yet he still has two robot pets, that i have no idea why they are there with him ? and as expected they are clumsy and always goofing around him for no clear reason ?!No more Megan Fox, but now she is replaced with another hot model like actress, who's character is still annoying, was just casted here to be constantly saved by our hero. there was supposed to be a passionate drama like relationship between her and Sam, which was totally unrealistic and lacked in depth. She was hot undeniably, but why ? do we have to ingrain this hot image in our growing generations ? that this is what every guy should have and that this is what every girl should look like ?!?! another cheap Hollywood image that i wished they would have avoided in this film. sad !!Too long, too much unnecessary scenes that could have been easily cut out, the whole Sam struggling with his family issues have been done before and grown old.the Visuals and sound effects, however, were stunning, i really can't deny that, and i only saw this in 2D, people seem to like the 3D and highly praise it. definitely, very enjoyable visuals, and some of the action scenes were very brilliantly executed, but even the action lacked in certain areas and did seem unrealistic.Spoiler >> so when Sam is hanging by one arm to one of the Decepticans, there was so much big and violent movements and he was dragged around like a feather, yet his arm did not get broken or his shoulder dislocated, seriously ?!So to summarize, this was another Hollywood joke, lots of emphasis on visuals, which were brilliant, but no depth and no heart to it. but I'm pretty sure, a lot of people will be taken by the visuals and will think that this was the best movie ever made, the younger audience ' including my 7 years old son who actually liked this ', and it will make big bucks, but with no heart.",3,7,16,29 June 2011
The Great Gatsby," Shallow and empty
","With big names like Leanordo De Caprio and Tobey Maguire, one must expect an amazing movie experience based on a good book, sadly, this is not the case. the film was suppose to be a Romantic Drama, however, it lacked in both Romance and Drama. for starters, it failed to capture the love between Jay and Daisy, not a lot of light shed on their previous relationship, i really could not care less if she went back to Jay or not, in fact, i felt that Jay Gatsby is a wife stealing creep. the pace of the film was another problem, it was super slow, and dragged at times giving a feeling of boredom. there were also some technical problems with direction of the film, the sound editing was poor and several clips has poor synchronized sound to picture especially when characters are speaking.Leaonardo's acting was also below his usual in my opinion, i felt like he just didn't live the role, something was missing this time in his performance, every time he said ' Old Sport ' it felt fake and obvious acting !! Tobey Maguire was better, and Carey Mulligan was OK.the biggest problem is that the story seemed shallow and empty, mainly because of the lack of the sense of Drama and the feel of the spark or the obsessional love of Jay toward Daisy, i think the film failed to capture that. add to that a slow boring pace and it just failed to ignite. they even had to spell the words on the screen in certain clips to make the viewers understand,i mean literally they had words typed on the screen like some sort of stylish direction, if i wanted to read i would have bought book !some of the positives were the costumes and set designs were perfect for a 1920s period. the music was also energetic and fun.So to summarize, a slow, boring shallow and empty film with nice set designs and costume designs, nice music, decent acting.",3,3,7,21 May 2013
