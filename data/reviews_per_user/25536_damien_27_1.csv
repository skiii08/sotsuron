Alien 3," Drama Exemplified
","While Alien 3 did not continue with business as usual, the movie manages to make a statement leaving an indelible print on the franchise.The first two films were great and actually superior to the third installment. However, David Fincher defies expectations by bringing closure to the trilogy. (Note: the fourth Alien is an abomination and holds no place in one of the truly great franchises in film history, therefore making Alien a trilogy).While Alien 3 is not perfect the film presents a disillusioned and seasoned character in Ripley. In the first two films, Ripley battles the alien beast with tenacity where the third film shows Ripley coming to terms with her destiny. The alien creature will not leave her trail until she is destroyed. While this theme is somber and unappealing to most audiences, Alien 3 executes it very well. Sigourney Weaver in particular brings the perfect balance of emotion and complacency to master the tone of the film.Alien 3 is lacking in some moments in special effects but the emotional tone of the film remains solid. Ripley is doomed and the movie plays out her finale in solid fashion. Alien 3 may not have ended the franchise in a way most audiences agreed with, but no one can deny that Ripley faced her proverbial demons and faced her destiny for the good of humankind.",7,2,40,8 February 2008
