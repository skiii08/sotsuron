Kill Bill: Vol. 2," Juvenile Opus
","Once you've seen one Tarantino juvenile opus you've seen 'em all. Yaaaawwwwwwwwwwwwwnnnnnnnnnnn.  Quentin, you're following the wrong ethic: It's time to grow up.  Maybe you, Arnold, and Mel could get together for the next fest of empty violence and degradation?  'The Totally Recalled Passion of Bill'?  Wouldn't that be wonderful and uplifting!  How is this for a clever idea for your next film: a shootout in the world's largest mannequin factory!  Imagine the irony of the utterly empty body count!  Wait, has this been done before?  Oh, yes.  Kill Bill: Vol. 1 and nearly every other movie you've ever done!  Eric Harrises and Dylan Klebolds of this world and QT films?  Chicken and egg? Still, David Carradine was excellent.",8,3,6,19 May 2004
The Matrix Revolutions," Loud Thud
","Somewhere between the heights of The Matrix and the first scene in Zion, this series stumbled over the precipice.  The Matrix Revolutions is the loud thud at the bottom.Only a few minutes of insipid dialogue and derivative preadolescent male video game fantasy had me praying for yet another colored pill so that I could return to the Matrix.  All the interesting characters must have found this pill and returned to blissful ignorance.  The characters who stayed around for the Revolutions must have their minds on finding a pill of their own.So much promise, so little cohesion.",2,0,0,24 April 2004
Mystic River," Vapid Story Unredeemed by Fine Performances
",The mystery is lost early in the film when the murderer's identity is telegraphed.  Without a mystery the remainder of the story is vapid and is never redeemed by the excellent performances.  I'd like my money back.,2,2,5,18 October 2003
