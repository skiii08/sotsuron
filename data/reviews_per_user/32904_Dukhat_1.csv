Borat: Cultural Learnings of America for Make Benefit Glorious Nation of Kazakhstan," If you liked this movie ...
","... you are most likely a latte-drinking, C-minus student, Canadian studies major whose thoughts emanate not from an internal sense of reason but from a sense of what's popular as determined by your pot-smoking, anti-establishment friends; as well as hip celebrity idols like Jon Stewart and Kanye West.If you are in this group, in the interests of evolution, please do humanity a favor and kill or sterilize yourself.This is the most juvenile, over-rated comedy of this decade. Brain cells will die when watching this if you have any.On a positive note, the DVD on which this movie is printed makes a good coaster. Downloading this movie will teach you valuable skills on how to download and watch other movies which is certain to be better than this overblown tripe.",1,4,11,25 August 2008
