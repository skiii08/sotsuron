Skyfall," The Resurrection of a Legend
","An incredible cast brings Bond...'back to the future' in this 50th anniversary masterpiece. Daniel Craig certainly is the best Bond since the legendary Sean Connery , and there 's no skimping on action. Showing the frailties of age and a more human side to 007 makes one uncomfortable at first as one is not used to such 'mortal consequences' when watching a Bond film, however as the movie progresses confidence is quickly restored as the real action kicks in and one can't help but think, 'Bond is back!' The references to the long history of Bond are many but when the twang of the guitar from the original theme kicks in as the Master Spy's comeback materializes is probably the most energizing one of all, especially for those old enough to have lived through a good number of original releases.I would have loved to give the film a ten, but cannot as it does have a few shortcomings, but none that significantly impacts the film. A definite must see!",7,0,7,4 November 2012
