The Incredible Hulk," Idiotic disaster...
","I can't believe how mindless and foolish people are today saying this film is so great. The first film is spectacular and special and unlike other movies plus it has better actors and CGI effects. This movie is just another dull ultra-action movie like Transformers and Pearl Harbor. I almost cried when I walked out of the cinema. Feels like they are trying to kill the 2003 version and create a sell-out movie so stupid, so meaningless that every child in the entire universe loves it. And the actors, my god, Edward Norton is a brilliant actor, but in this movie he just can't act. And John Hurt is extremely poor too. The ending was also a total failure! What is Ironman doing there? And why the hell can the Hulk suddenly talk?! If you have waited long for an Edward Norton vs Tim Roth Movie, then it's finally here. If you disagree with this comment, you don't know anything about good movies...",5,3,7,16 July 2008
The Mist," I love it! Best Stephen King movie ever!
","I will start by how I found out of this movie. I talked to a friend at school who bought this movie cheap on a gas station. He said it was okay, but he really hated the ending. I just couldn't believe that an ending of a movie could be that a annoying. He nearly screamed till he turned red because of the ending. I will not spoil it, but the ending is just amazing. It makes this movie truly brilliant because it's no mainstream movie. Some people will say the ending sucks, but it doesn't. I can't believe why this movie has such a low rating. It should have been on the top list of IMDb.com.The movie starts out quite good and I think the monsters of the movie was not very good CGI, but they looked awesome like tentacles and big ugly flies and spiders, quite inventive monsters. There were some gore effects I loved and the actors were good too. The movie is really realistic and I think if the world was attacked by monsters like that, the people would have reacted the same way. This movie is for the Hollywood-American-guff haters.10/10, just amazing",10,3,7,7 January 2009
Grindhouse," Extremely good!
","Death Proof was really good, but you can't call it a Grindhouse movie. I don't think it is Quentin Tarantino's best movie, but hey, has Quentin Tarantino ever made a bad movie? I really liked the Stuntman Mike character and it was really fun to see Kurt Russel in a new movie instead of an old classic like The Thing. The ending was... Well... I won't spoil it, but either you love it or hate it, and I loved it! The special effects was really good and it was a really entertaining movie. If you haven't seen it, I suggest you see other Tarantino movies first like: Pulp Fiction and Kill Bill because you will notice things from those movies also including in Death Proof.Planet Terror was even better! I loved the zombie apocalypse theme in the movie and the extreme gore scenes just made the movie funny. The best character in this movie is no doubt Cherry Darling (Rose McGowan). She IS in fact hilarious. It was funny to also see Tom Savini back on the screen as a clumsy policeman. This movie is filled with though action scenes, graphic violence, hot babes, famous actors and a brilliant ending. Really worth watching! Must be Rodriguez' best movie ever.",8,0,1,10 May 2008
