The Ring," Stylish, Disturbing, and better than 'Ringu'- a lot better (no spoilers)
","First thing first, I saw 'Ringu' about the time I first heard they were shooting an American remake. I watched it and didn't find it bad at all, just- not that good (and I love subtitled movies, so that had nothing to do with it). So it was with some trepidation that I walked into the American version of the film directed by none other than the man who made 'The Mexican.'Well, my worries were unwarrented. This movie was great. I'm a huge movie buff, especially horror movies, and none of the classicly 'terrifying' films have ever really gotten to me. I have jumped during movies before, but I can honestly say that no film has ever really gotten under my skin until this one. I'm not sure what it was, it's not particularly scary, it just hit the right buttons I guess. After getting 'The Ring' on DVD, I rented 'Ringu' just to refresh my memory of it. I was immediately reminded of why I didn't like it very much, and the points were made even more blaring watching the two side by side. 'The Ring' is very stylish, and in certain scenes/shots rather graphic in visuals (the nail through the finger) or themes (Richard's abuse of Samara). The original, which did also have graphic bits, for me, just lacked intensity. After watching both films probably five times or so I still just can't be affected by 'Ringu', and I try. From what I've read and people I've talked to, it seems that people who saw 'Ringu' first prefer it and people who saw 'The Ring' first prefer it. I don't fit in either category, seeing 'Ringu' first but finding 'The Ring' vastly superior. The look, the actors, the storyline (the minor differences improve it a lot), and especially the score are all top notch on this one.
Even if you didn't like 'Ringu', or you did and don't think this could match up, at least give it a chance.",9,1,1,25 July 2003
Unbreakable," Better than 'The Sixth Sense'
","This movie has got to be the most misunderstood and underrated movies in recent memory. It is a well written, well acted, and excellently directed. I hate it when people complain about things like someone said that the camera not moving for a while annoyed them. That's because the Shyamalan values storytelling over camera tricks.Many people I recommended the movie to liked it, but hated the scene where Bruce Willis' son holds the gun on him- they didn't get it. His son holds the gun on him because he is desperate to believe Samuel L. Jackson's character. He wants to believe it so much that he doesn't care if it's true or not.This movie is one of the best films to come out recently if you understand it- if not, oh well.",Null,0,0,4 May 2001
Signs," A Happy Surprise (Minor Plot Spoilers)
","I'm a huge fan of M. Night Shyamalan's. I thought 'The Sixth Sense' was great and consider 'Unbreakable' one of the best movies I've ever seen, so I was obviously looking forward to 'Signs'. I wasn't disappointed.I went into 'Signs' expecting something completely different than what it was. I thought it would be more about the crop signs and aliens. Being a Shyamalan film, I expected it to be different, but I didn't expect anything like this. What surprised me was that this is not about an alien invasion or even crop circles. Yes, they are devices used to spark the story, but they could have been replaced with another setup and the film could have easily told the same story. More than aliens or crop circles, this is a film about faith, losing it and gaining it back.If I have a problem with the film, it's that I wanted to know more. More about what the aliens, more about how the rest of the world reacted. Ultimately, however, that is not what the movie is about. It is about Mel Gibson's character's search for his lost faith.I've read comments from this and other sites saying the aliens were too stupid with their strategies and they were weak and there weren't enough of them and other things the aliens should have done better if they were so advanced. The thing is, they explain that this is merely a small recon wave of them to check things out. That explains the small number of them and the lack of weapons.The movie is expertly executed, building up suspense, adding small character quirks and issues that seem insignificant- just minor character development, but in the climax come together perfectly without seeming contrived.
This is a great film. Possibly Shyamalan's best ('Unbreakable' may still be better) and easily one of the best (if not THE best) of the year so far. See it without any expectation about what is going to happen and just go where it takes you, you won't be disappointed- and if you are, you're wrong.
