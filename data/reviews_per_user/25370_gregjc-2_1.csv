Requiem for a Dream," Nonsensical nonsense that has no point.
","I was told by several people that this was an excellent movie. I watched the entire film (just to give it a fair chance) and it was a depressing view of drug culture. It gave non-junkies nothing to grasp on to. Often excellent movies do not have a easily definable message, but they seem to offer insight into the human condition. This movie had none. This movie is only 'cool' because someone somewhere said it was.",1,13,26,5 April 2002
