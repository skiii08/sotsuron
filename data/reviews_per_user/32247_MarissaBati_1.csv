First Man," Takes the joy out of space travel
","Im obsessed with anything about space, but this movie lit kills any joy you have for space. Its slow, boring, and even when he lands on the moon then make it a depressing feel. Im honestly pissed I spent money renting this lol.",4,2,4,23 January 2019
