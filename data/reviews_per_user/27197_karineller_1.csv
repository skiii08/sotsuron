United 93," Powerful and amazing
","This movie was incredible.I have to say, the most painful aspect of watching this movie was reliving the experience of 9/11. I was, at the time, home with my then-1-month-old child... watching all the events of the day unravel.This movie forced me to remember how I felt at the time. VERY tastefully, accurately done. I can't do anything but speak volumes for all the unnamed actors and actresses who portrayed the victims in this plane crash.The bureaucracy of this country is ... amazing. Watch, and feel.Feel your heart relive this time.",9,1,4,5 May 2006
