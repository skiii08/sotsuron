The Blair Witch Project," I hate hype!!!
","This movie could have been so much better had I not heard it hyped for the past three weeks. Instead, everyone has made such an effort to jam down my throat how creative an idea it was and offer all the details on exactly how the film was made that I was distracted from enjoying the story. Not really a dose of pure terror, but fun nonetheless.",7,1,1,31 July 1999
Being John Malkovich," Definitely a love it or hate it film
","This is one of those great films that leaves half the audience wanting to give Oscars to the whole cast and crew and the other half shaking their heads saying 'What the . . .' One of the best dark humor farces I've seen in years. It feels like it takes a while to get into the story of the film and the ending is a bit odd, but it's an odd movie. My advice -- bring out the warped side of your sense of humor and enjoy this way off-kilter view of the world, the human state of consciousness, relationships, the work environment, celebrity, etc.",9,0,0,12 November 1999
