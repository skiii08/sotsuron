Captain Phillips," One of the best movies I've ever seen... or maybe not!
","I truly don't understand the rating this movie has, nor that someone could have given 10 to it (or even 8, or ... 2!), nor the fantastic reviews I've read about it.All you get is 2 hours of bad acting, childish dialogs, childish plot (that we have to believe is true...) and a truly annoying shaky camera (nextt time try to hire a cameraman that does not have Parkinson).It's not even worth to watch on a rainy Sunday afternoon. A little nap will do you best;) (And why do I have to write a 10 lines for my review it to be accepted??? What if my opinion about a movie stick in only 2 lines?? Don't you think I should be able to express it anyway? Or do I always have to add some junk (fits whit the movie I just reviewed...LOL) to it?",1,4,16,8 May 2014
The Death of Stalin," Is this movie for real?
","What did I just watch?A comedy? Well, it didn't make me laugh. Not a little.
It almost made me cry; for wasting my time in watching it.
Every scene, every character, every dialogue is trying so hard to be funny that it becomes pathetic and dull...A historical recreation?
I'll let you be the judge of that. For me it is almost an insult to history itself. Wouldn't it be possible to make a comedy and still keep a little historical credibility?And what about all this swearing??? Is it really necessary? Or does it make it more 'funny'? It seamed to me that not a single sentence contained at least a 'bad word'.And what about the rating?
7.4 when I wrote these lines!!!

Drive," Did we all watch the same movie???
","An 8 rated movie is always one you start watching with big expectation.And so, there I was, waiting for this little something that turns a movie into an 8 rated masterpiece to happen. And I waited... And then I started reading the reviews (good ones at first) and I waited... Then I read the bad ones... And still, I waited...NOTHING HAPPENED!DID WE ALL WATCH THE SAME MOVIE???Thriller? Action? Suspense? Where did you see any of those in this movie? What I saw was plain boringness, where little happens and annoying acting (un-emotive, plain, BORING)...Someone compared this with Tarantino or Scorcese!?!... I would rather compare it's slow pace with Iñárritu's 21 grams, but in a (failed) try to be version of... And 21 grams is only rated 7,8! There must be something wrong!",1,1,4,5 February 2012
Star Wars: Episode VIII - The Last Jedi," PLEASE STOP MAKING STAR WARS SEQUELS!
","Seeing all the negative reviews, I wasn't going to write one, but I feel so betrayed by these 2 last episodes that I have to SHOUT IT LOUD.
Please don't do no more sequels. You have already done enough to disgrace the original series.This movie is pathetic, the all plot is pathetic. 
PLEASE STOP!And how about the rating???
Some people say that disney payed imdb.
I'm starting to believe that it is true...",1,12,19,14 March 2018
