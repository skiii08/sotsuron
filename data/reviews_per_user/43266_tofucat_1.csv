10 Cloverfield Lane," Breath-taking with Amazing Score
","I seriously enjoyed this movie. It combines mystery, thriller, and sci-fi all together in this blend of movie genres that is perfect. I didn't know what to expect going into the movie and how sci-fi it would be but honestly I was astonished at how much I enjoyed it.Mary Elizabeth Winstead's performance is spectacular and John Goodman's acting was bone-chillingly creepy. He portrayed Howard's bordering paranoia and maniacal mind in such a way that it truly makes him unpredictable. Another thing that I greatly enjoyed was the cinematography. The sepia tones sprinkled all throughout the film gave the trickling feeling of how Michelle began to become comfortable briefly just to have that shattered and the shots become dark and grey. Next, is the score, I believe it was done by Bear McCreary and what a great job he did! All throughout the film you could really gain the sense of emotion or tension from the score and that is exactly what you should what from the soundtrack. A particular piece I liked was the track that played when Michelle was walking up the stairs for the first time to see the pigs and the growing anxiousness and temptation that lies in that door. One thing that shocked me was the ending. It was un-pre-dictable! And that's what I love about a film. I did not know what was going to happen to Michelle and how she would escape the new antagonist that appears or if she would for that matter. I also loved the open ending and that after her ordeal she had become hardened and ready to fight for others. I would love a sequel!",9,0,0,2 July 2018
