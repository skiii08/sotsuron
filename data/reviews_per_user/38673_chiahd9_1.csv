Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," hello!!
","This presequel fits into the look and feel of the Star War Episodes so well that it is impossible to tell it was created after the originals apart from the stunning special effects. Set 'a long time ago in a galaxy far far away' , This film is another masterpiece of science fiction by George Lucas. It follows two young jedi nights in their mission to stop the evil Trade Federation. The majority of the film's vast amount of special effects are computer animated. I found this very pleasing to the eye and the fast pace at which it travels keeps the viewer interested and excited",Null,1,2,25 June 2001
