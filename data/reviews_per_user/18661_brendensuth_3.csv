Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," Sorry but I liked it
","Let me just start out by saying I am a huge Star Wars fan and I know how much of an atrocity this film is compared to the rest of the films, but the bar was set so high with the other ones. I know this is the worst one besides AOTC, but it was still very enjoyable. I may have even given this film a 9 had it not been for two particularly annoying characters (I'm sure you all know who I'm talking about). I'm a pretty big fan of Liam Neeson and Ewan Mcgregor and I thought they were good together, not as good as Finn and Rey or Han, Luke and Leia but not bad. Darth Maul, I thought, was a terrific villain. I wish he would've been utilized a little more in the film, but the battle at the end really highlighted how bad-ass he and his dual saber are, you know, until he dies. Not perfect by any stretch of the imagination and certainly a disappointment not worth the 2 decade wait, but still very enjoyable.",8,1,4,31 October 2017
Baby Driver," Awesome!
","I really liked this movie. The casting choices were great, particularly Ansel Elgort as Baby. Despite the lack of lines in the movie, I thought he did a terrific job and was a very convincing getaway driver. Kevin Spacey was great as always (sure, that's a little biased since he's one of my favorite actors), although I wish he had a little bit more screen time. Jon Hamm really nailed the bad-ass bank robber role. Lily James was amazing. I've never seen her in anything until this movie, but I thought she did very well. Eiza Gonzalez fit her role like a glove and did very well, especially with her Oscar-worthy diner speech. There was definitely some things that can be questioned in this movie like some of the decisions made by some characters as well as scenes that seemed rather pointless and had no contribution to the overall plot, but those things can be overlooked, especially by me. I also thought the second half or final third of the film was sped up a little just for the sake of making this film under 2 hours, which made things a little confusing, but still, I had little trouble overlooking this. Had the things I just covered been completely mopped up, 10/10. So 9/10. Great movie overall.",9,1,3,31 October 2017
Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice," I can see why everyone hated it, but I liked it
","Let me start by saying I am the biggest Batman fan in the entire world, so much so that I would give Batman & Robin a 6/10, which says a lot. This isn't a great start to post-Dark Knight trilogy era Batman films, but it's adequate, and I can't help but love it it Batman is in it. I'll start my review with the flaws. I thought Jesse Eisenberg as Lex Luther was an awful choice and he was way too over the top. He wasn't very intimidating at all and seemed to be spewing a bunch of irrelevant crap the entire movie. I also thought Amy Adams was utilized way too much in this movie. Yes, she's a great actor but if you insist on giving her so much screen time, make a superman spin off about Lois Lane (which I wouldn't watch). Most of what she did in the movie didn't seem to contribute much to anything and seemed like a pointless subplot that, if removed, would've shortened the movie by a lot, which would have been okay. Also, there's the obvious one: the misleading title. I was expecting a bunch of all out battle royales between Batman and Superman, but instead they fought for about 10 minutes and then immediately made up because Superman's foster mom was captured by Lex Luther (on a side note, I think it's really funny that Batman and superman both had mothers named Martha. Bob Kane and Jerry Siegel and Joe Shuster probably should've fixed that, since crossovers were pretty much inevitable from the get-go, whether it be on paper or on the big screen, making for a world of confusion). I also didn't like the design of Batman's costume all that much. Now the positives of the film: I loved how the movie was scattered with Easter eggs, like the Justice League members' cameos, the Riddler question mark and Jason Todd's murder by the hands of the Joker. I really liked Wonder Woman, and I think Gal Gadot portrayed her beautifully and made for a pretty bad-ass superhero. The movie was also littered with great, memorable moments among the many flaws and sub-par scenes, like the actual battle between batman and superman, Bruce Wayne's dream, the aforementioned cameos of the other Justice Leaguers, the introduction of batman with those two police officers, as well as the interactions between Alfred and Bruce. I also really liked the casting choice of Ben Affleck as batman. Unlike basically everybody, I wasn't skeptical and had a lot of high hopes and anticipation to see him don the bat suit. Overall, a pretty good movie. I guess the best way to describe this movie is that it's a sloppy and messy film with incredibly memorable moments",8,2,3,13 November 2017
