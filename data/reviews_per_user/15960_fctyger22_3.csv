It," Book + Movie= Bloody Terrifying
","I have never read any of the books and, until today, I had only seen 2 Stephen King movies; the 1990 release of IT (taken from an NBC television broadcast) and The Night Flyer on DVD. And neither one of them, or any of the scary scenes in all the movies I had ever seen, could've prepared me for this. From the trailers, to the premiere, to the final scene, this is truly one of Stephen King's finest works. The Bible speaks of the 4 Horsemen of the Apocalypse. I've come to regard and admire Stephen King, George Romero, Wes Craven, and Alfred Hitchcock as 'The Four Horsemen of Horror'.Give me Dracula, The Wolfman, Godzilla (classic and modern), The Blob, all the 8-legged freaks, and you still won't be able to hold your ground against, or your bladder, when faced with the works of Stephen King. I applaud the entire cast and crews and I am not ashamed to say that I am absolutely terrified of IT.In closing, and in the spirit of another one of the 4 horsemen of horror, let me take a page out of Wes Craven's book: We had chapter one. In chapter two, IT will be back for you.",10,6,15,8 September 2017
Star Wars: Episode VII - The Force Awakens," Old fashioned good vs. evil
","I wrote a review for the prequels saying that maybe George Lucas made a mistake using current world affairs as a means to tell how Star Wars came to be; trade negotiations, the war on terrorism, and the rise of imperialism in the government. But they were his mistakes to make in his legacy. But I accepted the prequels. I grew up with Star Wars. In fact, my family still has the home video recordings from when the originals aired on HBO in the 80's and I'm standing by those instead of the 2000 upgrades. As for TFA, I'm standing by it because I believe J.J. Abrams has gone back to the roots of Star Wars: good vs. evil. Before I went to see it, I asked my brother one question, 'Is there a preview scene after the credits?' I didn't want any spoilers or hints and he didn't have anything bad to say about it either.",10,13,43,28 December 2015
Godzilla," Long live the King of all monsters!
","I don't care if this is a remake of the original 1954 classic, a way to compensate for 1998, or if this was an attempt by Warner Bros. and Legendary to outshine and washout the legacy of Toho Co., Ltd. I went to see this movie in 3D-Imax, not like a regular movie broadcast, and I did whatever I could to keep my eyes on the whole screen. And I do not have a single solitary complaint about this movie. I was blown away by the historical details as well as the graphics. I grew up on Godzilla movies from Toho; from 'King of the Monsters' to 'Godzilla 1985'. It wasn't until 1994 that I found some newer movies that were setup to be like after 1985. I'll leave my opinions of them to myself and to their respective pages. As for this, my only problem is going to be whether to buy this on DVD or wait until it airs on TV and record it myself. For right now, I only have one thing to say......LONG LIVE THE KING!",10,19,31,16 May 2014
