Captain Phillips," Pretty Decent Thriller based upon Current Events
","I genuinely liked 'Captain Phillips.' It came across as a reasonably believable account of the incident that occurred. Of course, I'm sure that it wasn't entirely accurate, as few films of this nature are.There have been quite a few challenges by the crew members of the ship which is the subject of this film, contending that Phillips is not the hero which the film portrays him to be. Well... Those crew members were there, and I was not. It's just as likely that they are telling the truth as that they are lying, as far as most of us are concerned.So... On the merits of the film itself... It's a pretty good flick, and it's believable. It's tense. It's certainly not an 'Action Film'... definitely more of a drama. It's basically a broad character study of Captain Phillips and a couple of the Somali pirates. Why are they here? Why are they doing this? What are their true goals and motivations? That kind of stuff.These character studies do get interesting. The Somali characters let a few clues slip about the situation at hand... 'I have bosses, too' ... etc. One gets the feeling that the REAL antagonists in this film will never be seen... and, in fact, they are not. That fact, in and of itself, is disturbing.In the end, 'Captain Phillips' is the story of a brief confrontation between two cultures that are so vastly different that there is very little chance that they will understand each other in the near future.",7,0,2,29 November 2015
Star Trek Into Darkness," A Decent 'Reboot' of the Khan-Kirk story
","I was skeptical of the Reboot of the Star Trek universe, and I didn't much care for the first movie.However, I must say that the second movie really did a whole lot better at capturing the character personalities of the original Star Trek, while still retaining the originality of this new 'alternate reality' interpretation. I still don't like that the 'explorer' and 'new worlds' ideals of the original Star Trek have basically been thrown into the garbage, but the character studies of the central characters got a whole lot better in this 'episode.'Karl Urban, in particular, deserves a huge bonus/raise for interpreting the personality of the McCoy character far better than any other actor in the Reboot. His caustic, emotional interpretation is simultaneously hilarious and poignant.I also like the development of the Chekov and Uhura characters. That was rarely attempted in the original series.Benedict Cumberbatch has really made his mark playing the sullen anti-hero in many films lately. He was a GREAT choice for Khan...Seeing this film, especially if you're a Star Trek fan, is a good use of your time. A good, solid film.-----------EDIT:I felt the need to edit my review, after thinking about it for a couple of months...I say... and I Cannot Apologize for this... that J.J. Abrams and his predecessor... Rick Berman... are complete MORONS... who have not even the most miniscule understanding of Gene Roddenberry's vision for 'Star Trek.'Unfortunately, I am not enough of an IDIOT to earn millions of dollars in Hollywood... like Berman and Abrams.Chris Pine and Zachary Quinto are not even CLOSE to the level of acting needed to portray the characters of Kirk and Spock accurately and meaningfully.The only dude in the cast who is worthy of the character which he portrays is Karl Urban... who has f-in' OWNED the character of McCoy, every since he started playing it.Oh... and also...Bruce Greenwood as Pike...That guy OWNS it, too.Yeah... it's a reboot... but those guys OWN it...",8,2,4,11 March 2015
Shutter Island," Brilliant Psychological Thriller
","This little gem was worth an immediate Second Viewing, just to pick up on all of the 'little things' that I missed the first time.It's easy to just throw around the name 'Martin Scorsese', and assume that the movie is going to be good. But the truth is that... sometimes... Scorsese is absolutely brilliant.I haven't read the novel upon which this film is based, so all of my comments are based upon Scorsese's interpretation... not the novel, the Film.The beauty of 'Shutter Island' is that there really is no resolution at the end of the film. Was that really a guy deluding himself, trying to escape from the horrors of his own life, or was he still trapped inside of a drug-induced hallucination? Nobody knows.He obviously knew, at the very end of the film, that by speaking to his 'partner?', he was basically telling everyone that he had not been 'cured.' Was that a 'request' to be lobotomized, so that he would never have to remember the horrors of his life again, or was it an acceptance of the fact that he would never escape from the island? Everyone assumes the former, but Scorsese leaves the question open.",9,1,2,26 August 2016
Interstellar," It Has Been Far Too Long Since We Had a Great Space Epic
","It has been 17 years since 'Contact', the last great film about what might be 'Out There.' We've been teased with Interstellar for more than one year, and now the wait is over.In Four Words: I Was BLOWN AWAY!Although the film features many more space travel and other-worldly scenes than Contact did, it is the same type of story as Contact and that other great story, 2001: A Spaced Odyssey. Just as those two films were, the movie is not really about space travel -- It's about humans taking the next step in their physical, emotional, and spiritual evolution. There are quite a few technical inaccuracies in the spaceflight scenes, but this movie is not supposed to be a NASA Documentary. It's best just to let those details slide and concentrate instead on the story that is being told.Some audiences have complained about the loud soundtrack drowning out some the dialog. I was fortunate enough to see the film on the IMAX screen in Costa Rica, with Spanish subtitles (I can read Spanish), so this was not an issue for me. However, the soundtrack really, really, really MAKES this movie. When you buy the DVD next year, turn the subtitles on and crank up the volume. The music alone can bring you to tears.It is a bit of a tear-jerker, and the actors let the waterworks flow. The characters' reactions to being on a planet for little more than 3 hours, only to find out that 23 years have passed on their spaceship and on Earth, is heart-wrenching. Although the film gets dangerously close to it a couple of times, it always manages to fall just short of being overly-sappy or clichéd.The movie is not perfect. I personally found the scenes with Matt Damon's character to be a bit artificial and unbelievable, although I do understand that so many years alone could make a person a nonsensical lunatic. The character is a psychotic that somehow seems to be totally emotionless and lethally rational. It just didn't compute for me. Fortunately, this is a relatively brief portion of the film.I was ever so grateful to finally see a movie in which the robots weren't given stupid-sounding rhetoric and trite 'machine' voices. The voice actors for the robots were given some awesome lines, too. 'What will happen if he opens the inner airlock?' 'Nothing Good!' The robots do have kind of a stupid-looking design, but their ability to adapt to many different physical tasks, as made quite evident on their first alien planet landfall, makes the purpose of their design very clear.This is outstanding quality film-making, that will surely easily speed past the $500 Million Gross Income mark and become this generation's '2001.'If you do get a chance to see it in an IMAX cinema, I highly recommend it.",9,3,9,18 November 2014
Captain America: Civil War," A Nice Surprise -- A Very Intelligent Morality Film
","Nice timing for a film to highlight the moral dilemma facing the USA today: Liberty or Safety.On the one hand, we have Tony Stark/Iron Man, who values safety above liberty:1. He signs an international agreements that gives governments control over what individuals do with their individual talents.2. He indefinitely imprisons a minor girl who is accused of no crime, justifying it by stating that her prison is a luxury home.3. He believes that an individual forced to commit a crime is still responsible for that crime.4. He denies the right to legal representation (to Captain America) and imprisons him without due process.... and many other violations of the U.S. ConstitutionCaptain America, on the other hand, is disgusted by Stark, and of course the film ends in a metal-clad grudge match between the two.Additional characters (superheroes/antiheroes) are brought into the Avengers fold, and the action is pretty good, but I got the most enjoyment out of the morality side of the story.",8,3,6,10 October 2016
Saving Private Ryan," A Powerful Film with a Difficult Question
","'Saving Private Ryan' is, more or less, a character study, not of only one person, but of U.S. philosophy. Why send a squad to find one guy and send him home? The premise is that the mother had already lost 3 of her 4 sons to the War (World War II, or the Great Patriotic War), and that she should not be expected to lose her 4th and final son to the War. She had lost 75% of her children, and shouldn't have to lose 100% of her children.However, what about the mother who watches her only child go off to war? If he dies, she already lost 100% of her children to war. It's an issue that comes up many times in the film, and we get to see every man in the squad fight with this issue in his own mind during the film.The 'Private Ryan' character (Matt Damon) fights with this issue too. He's already been designated as an object of hatred and contempt by the entire squad, before they even meet him. He understands that the mission is both justified and ludicrous, at the same time. He didn't ask to be 'rescued', and he doesn't want to be rescued, but he seems to understand why he should be rescued. He represents the feeling that the USA shouldn't lose all of its children to the War.The main characters are a brilliant mix...The captain, who is fulfilling his duty to his country in its time of need.The sergeant... a crusty old lifetime war veteran... the kind of guy who actually eats MREs because he likes the taste.The sniper... a soldier who feels that his God gave him an amazing gift, specifically for the purpose of defeating the German army.The Jew... who joined the army specifically to fight against the anti-Jewish Nazis.The 'Tough Guy'... an almost Mafia-like character from New York City, who has no problem with getting in the face of his Sergeant, and even his Captain.The 'Good Guy'... who initially seems like a Tough Guy, but ends up being a soft-hearted guy who royally screws up by trying to save the life of a little girl in a war zone, at an inopportune moment.I didn't really care for Giovanni Ribisi's character in the film. The character just didn't seem realistic to me. However, the rest of the cast is a total Home Run.The film does a great job of capturing the horrors and realism of first-person warfare, and the story is awesome, too. Surely, one of Spielberg's finest films.",8,2,6,26 August 2016
Guardians of the Galaxy," Man! So Close! So Close!... To Perfect!
","First of all... I LOVED this movie. Indiana Jones meets Star Wars meets real everyday people. Loved it.Unfortunately... The clichés just went a bit over the edge. As touching as they were...1) Who didn't guess that he would open the gift at the end of the movie?2) Who didn't guess that his dad was an extraterrestrial?3) Who didn't guess that Groot would say and do something epic at the end?4) Who didn't guess that he would end up with Gamora at the end of the flick?10 minutes into the movie, all of that was pretty obvious.But, then again, maybe it was supposed to be. Lotsa Fun! Will definitely see the sequel!",9,3,9,17 November 2014
Jurassic World," Nothing Spectacular
","The movie was a disappointment but did have a few good action sequences. The CGI is stellar... Incredible, even.However, that can't make up for Zero character chemistry. Not one single character in this movie is believable. It all seems like that awkward high-school prom, when everyone is trying so hard to act cool and/or natural.The continuing 'Dis' on Costa Rica continues, with a shot at another airport masquerading as the Juan Santamaria airport in San José, and the use of the 'CR' prefix on aircraft (which is NOT Costa Rica's prefix). In addition, the pilot is shown flying the helicopter from the left side, which is the opposite of real-life.A pretty mundane script, Although the show was still enjoyable to watch, for the action sequences.",6,3,9,17 June 2015
Avengers: Age of Ultron," Good Action, 'Blah' storyline
","Spoilers Follow!This entire movie felt way over-the-top melodramatic, and like one big 2-hour set-up for the next 'Guardians of the Galaxy.'I miss Tom Hiddleston as Loki. He would certainly have been a huge boost over the trite dialog that permeates this film.There are some bright spots... We finally get to see Paul Bettany's face in an Avengers movie. In fact, Paul Bettany and James Spader pretty much steal the show, such as it is.Scarlett Johansson and Mark Ruffalo have a couple of really cool moments in the film... good acting... but then fall flat, later in the film.Jeremy Renner (Hawkeye) also has a couple of moments that fall flat... Just not in line with the Avengers theme.Almost all of the attempts at humor are just too manufactured and inappropriate to the story. Would 2 characters really quip about remodeling a house while riding on an entire city being elevated into the stratosphere and fighting an army of Self-Aware robots?Joss Whedon has done some awesome stuff in the past, but this script was just horrible. That being said, the actors did what they could to salvage the project, and the action is very good.",6,5,12,4 May 2015
Men in Black," The Cast Makes this Movie
","This is, by far, one of the best cast-driven movies I've ever seen. The plot itself is ridiculous and the visuals are even more so. However the combination of Will Smith and the not-so-subtle straight men -- Tommy Lee Jones and Rip Torn -- makes the movie work. This is a movie that makes 'Trite' work, exceptionally well. It's still my favorite MiB movie, closely followed by number 3. I do like sci-fi that doesn't take itself too seriously. If you're the same, this is a fun 2 hours.The one-liners are non-stop...'I AM half the man you are''We at the FBI do not have a sense of humor that we are aware of''I'm gonna come back and talk to you about them Rolexes'",7,0,0,16 February 2017
Man on Fire," Excellent Character Study and Love Story
","A solid movie that I have seen several times. Denzel Washington loves to go 'Hard-Core, Black-and-White' (not 'Black-and-White' racial, but moral standards).D.W. plays his standard type-cast, emotionless, remorseless character in this film -- and in my opinion, it's the best work he's ever done, in that respect.After he reads excerpts from the diary of the young girl that he is protecting, D.W. neither cracks a smile nor sheds a tear. He mercilessly tortures and guns down every person between himself and the child, until he is sure that she is safe.This kind of 'merciless martyrdom' is a trademark of D.W.'s acting, and this is the best instance of it.",8,2,3,28 December 2014
Arrival," Nice Discussion of Time and Moral Dilemma
","Right up front, this is not Star Wars or Star Trek. There is only one explosion in this film, and it only lasts for about one second. This is science fiction, not science fantasy, and it will be incredibly boring if you were waiting for Guardians of the Galaxy, Part II.Consider yourself lucky if you didn't see this one in the cinema, because about 75 minutes into the film, you hit that point where you think, 'Well, now I have to start watching again from the beginning.'If you liked Interstellar more than you liked Star Wars: Episode VII, then this is probably a good movie for you.I already checked the 'Spoilers' box, but this is an extra warning that will definitely spoil the movie...The movie is based upon a short story that discusses the subject of predestination and free will. If you could see your whole life from start to finish, would you change anything?",8,0,6,16 February 2017
The Terminal," A Wonderful Character Study
","The Terminal is a wonderful character study, which is something with which Tom Hanks seems to be intrigued... Forrest Gump, Cast Away, The Terminal, Bridge of Spies, etc. He does a very good job with it, for the most part.First of all... The premise of the film is unlikely. A person in the situation of Hanks' character -- Viktor -- would not be treated/ignored in the manner show in the film, especially post-9/11 (the film was released in 2004). I know -- I work in the travel and transportation industry. However, that is not really relevant to the point(s) that the film appears to be trying to make, so a little suspension of belief in this regard is acceptable.Just for the Record: In the real world, Viktor would swiftly have been removed from the airport, and probably would have been granted temporary asylum or somehow returned to his home or an intermediary location. At any rate, he wouldn't have been allowed to wander around the airport for weeks or months, when the authorities knew his situation from Day One. In that respect, the film is just a caricature of U.S. bureaucracy. That situation was necessary for the plot, so the filmmakers had to use a little 'artistic license' to create the situation which they wanted.So, then we see the Character Study. A foreign national, who doesn't know English, is suddenly trapped in an unusual situation in the USA. He's not an accused criminal, but he's trapped. How would he respond? According to the film, he does so by reverting to his own culture and personal morals. That makes sense. When we feel afraid and isolated, we almost always revert to our basic instincts and base culture. It helps us to feel safe and comfortable.Viktor does that. He looks for ways to sustain himself, he helps other people as he was (probably) taught to do as a child.The only real issue that I had with the film was the somewhat manufactured relationship between Viktor and Amelia (Catherine Zeta- Jones). That seemed to be a bit non-sequitur.Overall, a very good film that explores humanity and emotion very well.",8,0,0,24 August 2016
Star Wars: Episode VII - The Force Awakens," Not Bad... Certainly Not Extraordinary... Better than the Prequels
","The movie was fun to watch, especially after 10 years since the last film. The new leads, played by Boyega, Ridley, and Driver, are much better than Christensen and company. And... Thank Goodness... NO tag-along 'comic relief' aliens.The plot is so-so, but it does appear to be leading up to something which could make for an excellent sequel and finale in this trilogy. Kylo Ren is the most interesting character so far, so I hope that he sticks around for whole trilogy. Something happened between Ren, Leia, Han, and Luke... and I think it's going to be a lot of fun watching that story unfold. Plus, Adam Driver has the character 'Nailed'.The first two trilogies started off with a big 'We Won!' in the first film, but that was not the case in Episode VII. I like where that is going. This seems to be a big setup for a very 'Dark' Episode VIII, which would be awesome. The release date for VIII has already been pushed back, perhaps because the writers and director see an opportunity to really make it the darkest 'middle' episode of the whole saga.The acting by Driver is exceptional, and both Ridley and Boyega are above average, although Boyega was stuck in some places where the dialog didn't quite seem to meet the situation. Gleeson (General Hux) does some decent work, although he doesn't have many lines in the film. Word is that Gleeson and Isaac (Poe Dameron) will have bigger parts in VIII. I think that would be a good thing.I saw the film in IMAX, which was definitely worth it. If you haven't seen it yet, and don't have easy access to an IMAX cinema, I'd wait for the Blu-Ray.",5,4,24,31 January 2016
The Martian," Not Perfect, but a Solid, Enjoyable Story
","First of all... I really enjoyed The Martian, and I think that most people would. It's a long film, but it did manage to pick up the pace a bit, right when I was starting to get a little bored.Whenever a film like this, which tries to be accurate, is released... Everyone, including me, starts to pick apart the technical inaccuracies, and there are a few. The most commonly mentioned so far is the 'impossible' sandstorm at the beginning of the film. Such an event is, indeed, quite impossible on Mars, and even the author admits that it was merely a plot device. He should have thought of a better one.However, there is nothing in The Martian that just screams 'No Way!' to me. The author and the filmmakers did a very good job of trying to be as accurate as possible, while still allowing the story to proceed. There is some 'artistic license' but there is no 'deus ex machina' in The Martian. It's a good movie that doesn't betray anything that is science.Really, the most unbelievable thing that I saw in the whole movie was the gym on the Hermes -- Huge Windows and 5 times the space and gym equipment needed to accommodate 6 astronauts. It looked like the hotel gym at the Marriott. No Way would NASA or anyone else waste that kind of space, and build such an unrealistic section of the ship.As long as I'm doing my part in the nit-picking, we are once again faced, as in so many space-travel movies, with a centrifuge that is too small and/or doesn't rotate fast enough. And it doesn't feel like normal gravity either, as is readily apparent if you just gently toss a tennis ball into the air. OK, I'm done with my nit-picking.As many people already have stated, I was instantly reminded of the movie 'Cast Away', with Tom Hanks. I liked Cast Away, but it did get boring at times. The Martian solves this problem by injecting a bit more humor and action into the film. Rather than Hanks' downbeat character, Damon's character is far more upbeat and involved in his own rescue throughout the entire film. I definitely did not expect the humor that is present throughout the film. Whether it was script-writing, ad-libbing, or a combination of the two, it worked out quite well.As with most movies of this type, the ending is poor compared to the rest of the film. The climax is so over-the-top dramatic that I didn't get the least bit excited about it. The thing is... the film didn't even Need a climax. The climax was already built in. A guy has survived on Mars for well over one year. Just being rescued at all is a climax. Instead, we got a bomb set off aboard a spaceship -- intentionally -- and some kind of glove-thruster maneuver.I think that a much better ending would have been Watney passing out during the launch (which he did in the movie) and then waking up to slowly see the Hermes come into focus, nearby, slowly approaching, and a waiting Hermes crew-member with an outstretched hand. Add a few tears if you like that sort of thing.Too bad this film didn't get to show on IMAX.Overall, a great film. It's definitely worth it to see it in on the big screen.",8,5,12,7 October 2015
