Sucker Punch," Mentally ill whores are sexy?
","I really love action, scifi and fantasy movies. I also sometimes like pointless movies with just violence and hot dressed babes.I saw this sucker punch movie yesterday. From the beginning to the end i had a question mark floating over my head. I really do not get if there should be any lesson told with that flick. Or for which kind of audience it was made. I even did not got the movie genre.It surly has nothing to do with watching a popcorn movie with hot teenagers. Its just to sad for that. Are there really people out there who think that mentally ill women, which are hallucinating that they are whores are in any way sexy? Also the 'action' scene did not do there job. Well, yes it was common ninja, gunfire, dragon, Nazi zombie whatever stuff. This is normally fun. But it is not when you are aware, that this is only something like a last broken-hearted dream of a mental patient, one second before she is lobotomized.And finally the true story behind that dream scenes are not connected to the rest of the movie. Sure the dream scenes should be something like a reflection of what happens in real. But that is not a twist in the story or something. Everyone is aware of that from the beginning. This movie is sad and pointless in any way. And the sadest thing about it is, that so many people waisted 90 min of there lifetime to watch it.But i think there is one hidden joke in it. Maybe the whole story of the movie is not a reflection of the patient. What if the movie should be a reflection of the audience? That is the only thing which would make sense for me. If the message of the movie would be: Only lobotomized people are hallucinating sense and a message into a pointless movie. Even if it is noting more then a collage of uninteresting drivel combined with missing logic and a collection of random action sequences.",1,4,10,20 July 2011
