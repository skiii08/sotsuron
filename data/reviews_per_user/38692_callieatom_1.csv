Sucker Punch," SUCKER PUNCH: Quick review: (as it really doesn't warrant anymore of my energy)
","Zack Snyder is no misogynist he's clearly just dumb. This astonishingly boring mess is so weak it can't even manage to register let alone be offensive or even silly. Joyless and clunky, the action is drab, dated, repetitive and spineless, how the acting or dialogue were deemed acceptable by anyone involved is beyond me.It fails on an epic scale on every level, if this is supposed to make even the sweatiest of fan boys happy I think the director has the lowest opinion of them that borderlines contempt. No one should claim female empowerment when attempting to convey said message with cheaply made up mannequins who cower constantly in lolita dress-up and smudged mascara. And no matter how shallow your viewing standards this was just dull, where was the fun? Simply a pointless misjudgment by a gimmicky hack.",1,8,21,10 April 2011
