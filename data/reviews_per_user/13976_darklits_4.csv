Hereditary," 555?
","Ari Aster, why in the name of mother fu** would you put in the 555 number in a horror movie where you spend most of the movie building up tension? You made a great movie and I was all in and very excited and then the number 555 pops up and took me out of the entire movie and ruined it. Why would you put so much effort into a movie and then ruin it with this amateur stuff? If you want to show a number just smudge one number out or have something block a part of the number in this case like a mug. Or heres an idea, just dont show it. The 555 number appears twice in this movie. I would have given this movie a 9 but gave a 6 because of that number.",6,0,3,30 June 2018
Bohemian Rhapsody," Meh
","If Fincher would have made this staring Cohen it would have been a masterpiece!
Now it's just meh... I saw it and will never watch it again. Below average movie. I mean its not bad it's just meh, nothing special. Surviving members are said to dislike Fincher and Cohen because they wanted to make a Mercury movie but the members wanted a Queen movie. It's just that Bohemian Rhapsody is a mercury movie! He's in like 95%!",5,5,11,10 November 2018
The Bourne Legacy," Well done!
","I was really skeptical going in, but having seen it, I have to say it was frigging AWESOME! Loved every second of it! SO worth the money! Finally something taking Bourne back in business! Bourne Ultimatum was just OK because of the constant stupid camera shaking that just made me mad so I did not enjoy that movie. The camera shaking was just too much. It made it very hard to follow the movie. This one tho was just smooth and cool! Well done Tony! Having said that I would have liked that Matt would have made at least a cameo Its sad and unprofessional for Matt do take a stance like that. 'I will only do Bourne with Paul' What are you twelve?'. Matt you are the coolest guy on earth, but Tony made a better Bourne then Paul did with the last two.I really hope Renner and Damon will be in the next Bourne and Tony Gilroy directing!",10,45,66,28 September 2012
Taken 2," Very good
",I did enjoy watching this. Having said thatI had 4 issues with it.1. Why did Besson change directors after the huge success of the first one? That was a VERY BAD MOVE.2. Why don't the Albanians talk Albanian in the movie like they did in the first one. That was a huge mistake and took away of the reality for me.3. The movie was 7/104. Taken 1 had you hooked from the first second to the last second. This one had you tollerate it until the embassy and then just let you go.I gave it a seven because it was just OK all the way to the embassy.Besson made the biggest misstake of his life choosing Megaton (who chooses a name like that? There's your first clue) instead of Pierre Morel who did an incredible job on the first one.,7,2,6,5 October 2012
