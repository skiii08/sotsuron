Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," Yes, it really is that awful
","'A special effect without a story is a pretty boring thing.' If The Phantom Menace was one's only clue as to what sort of filmmaker George Lucas is, one would never guess that the above quote is attributable to him. The first episode of the Star Wars saga seems to be nothing but special effects, with no real story to speak of.One of the biggest problems with TPM is that none of the characters are in any way established. Who are these people? Why should we care about them? The only real glimpse we get into a character's psyche is a clumsy, 'I sense great (emotion) in you, (character).' It's a good thing those Jedi are around to tell us what everybody is thinking, because the writing sure doesn't convey it. Especially disappointing is Obi Wan Kenobi, who is completely unrecognizable from his later incarnation. He's just there, serving no apparent function.I've always felt that Jake Lloyd is unfairly criticized for his performance as Anakin. Sure, he was terrible, but who wasn't terrible in this movie? Whether it's the result of the extensive special effects giving the actors nothing to react to, or Lucas's notorious apathy in working with the cast, several actors who have proved their greatness time and again come across as flat and lifeless in this movie. We're talking actors the caliber of Liam Neeson, Ewan McGregor, and Natalie Portman. The only people who come out of this unscathed are Pernilla August and Ian McDiarmid, who actually give some depth and complexity to their woefully underdeveloped characters.Apart from possibly some advance in computer technology, the only real good thing that came from this movie is John Williams' faultless score, which is the only element that actually provides a believable bridge between this prequel and the original trilogy. The music brings life and meaning to all the things that the movie completely botches: the awe and beauty of the underwater city; the tension and excitement of the pod race; the dark underpinnings of Anakin's innocent character; the menace of Darth Maul; the epic bravura of the final duel. It's easy to see why John Williams has resided at the top of the composer heap for over thirty years--nobody can score a film like he can. And apart from the gorgeous locations and sets, that's really all I can muster by way of praise for this unfortunate film.",3,2,4,26 February 2008
The Mummy," Solid adventure film, one of my favorites
","The Mummy is definitely not a great film from an objective standpoint; there are an awful lot of plot holes and things that don't make a great deal of sense, and the characters often do things for no other reason than that the plot dictates they must. Still, Stephen Sommers hits the perfect balance of epic adventure, humor, and thrills to make the quintessential popcorn movie. The Mummy is sort of like those old creature features you used to stay up and watch on late night television, except that it's actually fun and silly and doesn't take itself seriously whatsoever.The cast is perfect, the photography is gorgeous (particularly in the desert sequences), the jokes are, if not hilarious, at least harmless enough, the special effects are decent but limited by the technology of the time, and the music is pretty good. This is a movie that knows what it's trying to do and achieves it perfectly. Too bad Sommers hasn't yet replicated the experience in his more recent duds.",8,0,0,17 March 2008
Sleepy Hollow," A love letter to the horror genre
","Sleepy Hollow runs a close second to Ed Wood as my favorite Tim Burton film so far, and represents perhaps the quintessential 'Tim Burton-as-brand-name' experience. To date it is his only genuine horror film, though it tends to run much closer to tongue-in-cheek black comedy, and as such serves as something of a coat rack onto which Burton hangs the dark fabrics of horror films stretching back a full century. The (rather obvious) use of sound stages and the economy of imagery reminds one of silent films such as Nosferatu or the John Barrymore version of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde, along with a visual scheme that is often almost monochromatic in its use of sepia tones, dark blues, and blacks and whites. The copious, and sometimes ludicrous, splattering of blood against pretty much every clean surface brings to mind the orgiastic excess of grue that characterized slasher films of the eighties. The lavish set design and the abundance of fog and mist, along with the 'inspector' element of the story (and the casting of Christopher Lee in a minor role), pay tribute to the Hammer films of the fifties and sixties, particularly those helmed by stylish Technicolor maven Terence Fisher.Probably the biggest influence on Burton's style, however, is the late Mario Bava, a cult figure whose visually sumptuous low-budget films of the sixties and seventies have been worshiped by filmmakers as diverse as John Landis, Dario Argento, Edgar Wright, Joe Dante, and Quentin Tarantino (but is otherwise relatively, and regrettably, unknown, even in his native Italy). Most apparently reflected in Sleepy Hollow are Bava's Gothic chillers, Black Sunday and Kill, Baby...Kill! Bava, often criticized as a 'style over substance' director who cared more about the way his films looked than about story or characterization (a charge often, and probably not coincidentally, leveled at Burton), was a master of mood, with the ability to charge even the most heinous act of murder with a psychosexual beauty, and the knack for soaking even the thinnest plot in an atmosphere that is erotic, gorgeous, and unnerving.Bava's sensibilities are also reflected in the film's quirky sense of humor as well, which makes use of a fantastic cast. Michael Gambon, Ian McDiarmid, Michael Gough, Jeffrey Jones, and Richard Griffiths, as key members of the community who have a connection with the mystery at the heart of the Headless Horseman murders, all turn up the eccentricity level to 11, with Johnny Depp fearlessly leading the way as the strangely effeminate inspector, Ichabod Crane, sent to investigate the rash of recent murders in a superstitious New England town. Crane is certainly an unconventional action hero--he faints no less than four times throughout the film--and yet his squeamish prissiness works superbly within the off-kilter execution of this dark fairy tale. Who else but Johnny Depp could have played this role? Katrina Van Tassel, as portrayed by Christina Ricci, is a somewhat underdeveloped love interest, but she's got enough courage and heart to keep from fading into the background, and her purity and virtue actually keep her sympathetic as opposed to boring or self-righteous. Another stand-out is Marc Pickering as Young Masbath, sort of the Robin to Ichabod's Batman. A preteen sidekick could have potentially become a desperate and annoying bid for the attention of the high school demographic, but the character both as written and as played by Pickering steers clear of the usual clichés to become just as interesting, funny, and worthwhile as everyone else. And, needless to say, Miranda Richardson and Christopher Walken are equally fascinating and fun to watch in their respective roles, and former Burton fiancée Lisa Marie has just the right 'Women of '60s Horror' look to her in a small but pivotal role as Ichabod's mother.Odds and ends: Kevin Yagher's special effects work here is astonishing. The decapitated heads, even when seen in close up, are phenomenally realistic, more so even than in many films that have come out in the decade since. (Yagher, incidentally, was on board to direct the project in its early stages.) Danny Elfman's score, as usual, is fantastic, hitting all the right notes of portent, eerie grandiosity, and excitement. The cinematography, by frequent Alfonso Cuaron collaborator Emmanuel Lubezki, is gorgeous, and Colleen Atwood does her usual stellar work as Costume Designer. Stunt coordinator Nick Gillard, most famous at the time for his choreography on The Phantom Menace, helps bring to life some fantastic action set pieces that somehow manage to stay within the boundaries of a Gothic horror piece. And of course, I would be remiss if I didn't mention the script by Seven scribe Andrew Kevin Walker. Of course, fans of Washington Irving's original short story may not share my enthusiasm, since Walker discards Irving's themes and decides that the Headless Horseman really is supernatural (and who can blame him, since most of us forget the bones of Irving's story anyway and only remember the ghostly apparition that didn't actually exist).All in all, Sleepy Hollow is a supreme fright flick, entirely appropriate for any rainy day or spooky night.",9,0,0,12 April 2009
Edward Scissorhands," Message to the movie's detractors...
","The first thing you have to understand about Edward Scissorhands is that it's meant as a modern day fairy tale, with a strong base in absurdism. Things happen here that would not or could not happen in real life. People do not react realistically. THIS IS INTENTIONAL. If you are the sort of person who takes everything literally (and it seems everyone I've encountered who doesn't like this movie is 'that' kind of person), don't watch this. You will only wonder why Edward's inventor gave him scissors for hands in the first place rather than actual hands, or why everybody takes his sudden appearance in stride, or why a Gothic castle shrouded in gloom is randomly situated on the edge of suburbia.I'm not trying to insult you. I'm just trying to tell you that, if you see this movie with somebody who loves it, all you're going to do is complain, and fans will get irritated because you don't 'get it', and then everybody involved will get in a big argument over whether or not this is a good film. So please, just take it on faith that you really need to stay away from this one if you can't accept the bizarre reality presented in the film.",9,0,1,9 October 2007
