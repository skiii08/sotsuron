Lucky Number Slevin," really enjoyable
","Lucky Number Slevin sees Josh Hartnett play Slevin in what appears to be a case of mistaken identity in a movie that easily skips between wry one liners and bloody violence that keeps you thinking until it's well-done conclusion.First off, the film looks great. It looks noir, complete with clever camera angles and smooth transitions, creating some very stylish cinematography and some brilliant scenes. The chess scene, which sees Slevin take on The Boss (Freeman), pretty much sums this up, using smart camera angles and stylish transitions while drawing the audience in and further complicating the story. The violence is well done, and the contrast it creates reminiscent of last year's Sin City (2005). The soundtrack also effectively contributes to the style, as it doesn't take over and you don't really notice it's there, but gets the job done.A film is however nothing without its cast, and Lucky Number Slevin is blessed with an amazing collection of actors and actresses. Hartnett pulls out a brilliant, if somewhat surprising performance, playing the wise-guy who cant keep his mouth shut who draws us in, before switching to the ruthless anti-hero who kills his way to the top at the film's conclusion. Morgan Freeman, The Boss, and Sir Ben Kingsley, The Rabbi, take to their roles perfectly, Freeman playing it with just the right amount of intelligence and cruelty, while Kingsley's role is more calculated and comic. Lucy Lui also does well as the girl-next-door/coroner, and her character moves the film along quickly with a touch of the film's more obvious humour. Bruce Willis' performance is probably the best out of the supporting cast. There doesn't seem to be much to it, but he dominates most of the scenes he's in (except that one where he's got a mullet) thanks to his understated cold-blooded killer acting mode.The plot keeps a hold of you throughout too, and prevents its audience getting lost as the conclusion explains it all for you, cleverly shifting from scene to scene as the pieces of the puzzle come together.There isn't really much more I can say. It looks great, the performances are great, the story is good, it's a bit violent, and it's still funny. I really enojyed it.",9,14,32,24 February 2006
Memento," Fantastic
","Memento sees Guy Pearce play Leonard Shelby, a man with no short term memory, on a search for his wife's killer in a film which is intelligent, engaging, well thought out, and sometimes, even funny. Memento demands your full concentration, and its backwards development is a stroke of genius, placing you in the same situation as Leonard; you see what he sees, and aside from small clues, very little else. This way of engaging its audience is what makes Memento special, as it draws you into the plot and Leonard's complex situation without leaving you lost amidst the chronology or bogged down in little clues. This is also helped by Guy Pearce's performance; he remains likable for most of the film, his little jokes and his honesty helping you side with him, but he also shows evidence of a darker side, especially towards the end (the beginning?), as Teddy (Pantoliano) plants the seed of doubt in his mind.Basically, Memento is a very good film, an intelligent, engaging storyline that keeps you interested even after it ends.",9,14,23,14 March 2006
Hot Fuzz," Awesome
","Hot Fuzz is the story of Sergeant Nicholas Angel (Simon Pegg), hardboiled super-cop. Intimidated by his arrest record, his cameo-appearance superior officers (Martin Freeman, Steven Coogan, and Bill Nighy) transfer him from the busy streets of London to the sleepy village of Sandford to keep him out of the way and balance the books, because, to be honest, he's making the rest of them look bad. A big cop in a small town, Angel sees murders and conspiracies where the cameo cast of cops and locals see accidents, but, with the help of his partner Danny Butterman (Nick Frost), it's not long before he discovers that not everything in Sandford is quite what it seems.Sound clichÃ©d? Good. That's the point. Once settled in Sandford, Hot Fuzz becomes a vehicle designed to send up every action film that has ever taken itself even slightly seriously from Police Story to Point Break, and it does this brilliantly by simply taking everything from these films and pushing them that bit further, making them appear both ridiculous and awesome at the same time. The characters are massively exaggerated (especially Pegg's super-cop and Timothy Dalton's fantastically over-the-top super-villain). The action sequences are outrageous, exciting, and feature a surprising degree of rough justice, perhaps most notably in the form of an old woman getting karate-kicked in the face (or maybe a pub landlord getting his head bear-trappedÂ…). The dialogue ranges from obvious parody ('Did you tell him to cool off?') to clever Pegg-Frost exchanges, and even the music is perfectly balanced between action-scene rock songs and mock-epic slow guitar pieces.However, that's not to say that Hot Fuzz is non-stop comic action. The first half an hour or so seems a little slow, but there's no reason to worry; the cast are simply setting up jokes to be knocked down later on, and it is definitely worth the brief wait for the well-paced comic-action masterpiece that's lying just around the corner. As with Shaun of the Dead, the people behind Hot Fuzz are affectionately poking fun at a genre that they clearly love, creating a film that embraces its genre's inherent ridiculousness, and is all the better for it.",9,191,243,28 March 2007
Constantine," Not a perfect balance, but entertaining nonetheless
","Constantine tells the story of John Constantine (Reeves), an anti-hero who plays the role of some sort of guardian, maintaining 'the balance' between the angels of Heaven and the demons of Hell in an action movie that is guilty of trying too hard to be stylish, slowing down what is otherwise an enjoyable action flick.The acting in Constantine is one thing that can't be faulted. Reeves, with his his hushed tones and anti-heroic mannerisms, puts in a decent performance, with his cruel but amusing character endearing the audience just enough to carry the film along. Weisz is similarly effective, as are the rest of the solid yet unspectacular supporting cast.For the most part, the CGI is pretty smooth too; it isn't exactly understated but it's not overused. However, I do have a problem with the needless art school camera angles and turns of pace. The introduction of Keanu is shot with such needless...lack of style. We get a slow motion shot of a cigarette dropped from the window, to the floor, we get a birds eye view of him exit a cab, and we are treated to an exorcism from the point of view of his cigarette, for no real reason. The overuse of the slow motion irritates me the most. Keanu's first descent into hell is a prime example of this; it takes poor Rachel something like thirty seconds to close the door, and this cheap attempt to play off the success of bullet-time sucks the pace out of what would otherwise be an enjoyable action movie.The plot isn't overly confusing, and it explains everything neatly enough. It could have perhaps played up the theology a bit more, but then it wouldn't really have been an action film anymore. Overall, it's good enough to be worth a look but sometimes feels a bit slow. Don't expect a classic and you shouldn't be too disappointed.",5,5,17,23 March 2006
Resident Evil: Extinction," entertaining but very average
","Is it good or bad things that always come in threes? It seems that in Hollywood these days, it doesn't really matter. So, after a decent zombie action movie and a terrible zombie/video game movie, we find ourselves with Resident Evil: Extinction.It picks up where 2 left off. The virus has spread, lots of people are mostly dead, and the remains of humanity find themselves travelling the open roads or holed up underground. Think Day of the Dead crossed with Mad Max, and you'll have an idea of the tone the movie's trying to set. The downfall of 2 was that it tried to be too much like the game, and 3 appears to have learnt from these mistakes. While there are lots of cute little nods to the source material, in the form of character names, little piano pieces, and claustrophobic corridors, the movie moves toward the standard zombie formula pretty quickly rather than going with the single character setup, although it does take a while for Milla to find another little gang of survivors and form our ragtag crew of zombie fodder; I guess the writers knew there really wasn't much material to work over in that respect.Meanwhile, there is the same sort of clichéd corporate menace from Umbrella, with their serums and their cloning (yes, cloning, in a zombie movie, obviously a great idea) and their plans to turn the zombies into a free workforce (another stellar plan). It's a subplot quite obviously lifted from Day of the Dead, but it just feels a bit redundant, although I suppose it does give you someone to boo and hiss at when they appear on screen. You know, as if the zombie hordes weren't menace enough. Having said that, some of the zombies look a bit...weak. I understand that there are fewer and fewer people milling about waiting to be eaten, but a lot of them just look thin and plastic, which isn't *really* all that menacing.Otherwise, Extinction features the same general ass-kickery from Milla, big action scenes, and mostly inept support from random stock characters. While Milla knows how to play this role, as do the other returning characters, but pretty much everybody else is just...bad. Check out the hospital scene near the start or the bit where that scientist guy 'domesticates' a zombie for a host of examples of bad acting; these are definitely not thespians at the top of their game. Oh, and for more amateur points, don't forget that generic nu-metal soundtrack!While it isn't great, or even good, it's okay, providing a reasonable amount of silly cliché-ridden entertainment thanks to its unashamed lifting of material from every zombie movie ever and attempts to come up with new and exciting ideas (clones! zombie birds!), but really it adds nothing new, and will hopefully mark the end of a relatively unsuccessful franchise, despite its somewhat open ending.",5,19,36,1 October 2007
Knocked Up," fantastic
","Knocked Up is a comedy about pregnancy, love, and marriage, that has far more intelligence and emotional depth to it than somewhat its flippant title would suggest. Ben (Rogen) is a layabout bum who lives with his stoner friends, 'working' on a celebrity porn movie website. Alison (Heigl) has just been promoted at E!, and when she heads out to celebrate, their worlds collide with disastrous and of course hilarious consequences.The comedy is clever and insightful, loaded with little self-referential moments and pop culture references (the Munich one is particularly awesome), and while it occasionally veers toward the puerile, the movie's subject matter ensures that the humour remains considered and intelligent for the most part. The performances are outstanding, but not just in terms of comic timing. Rogen appears built for this sort of balanced role as he realises that he has to grow up to meet the challenges of relationships and parenthood, and Heigl is just as effective as she learns to accommodate Ben's lifestyle and releases her grip on her career. The support from Paul Rudd and Leslie Mann is also brilliant. While their conflict-ridden marriage doesn't make them the greatest of role models for Ben and Alison, it certainly provides lots of laughs, and the clashes between Mann's overly paranoid Debbie and Rudd's laid-back Pete provide an interesting projection of how Ben & Alison's relationship could turn out.The Rudd & Rogen moments make for some of the movie's better lines, but their humour is finely balanced with that emotional depth that I mentioned before, making the characters far more than punchline machines, which benefits the movie immeasurably. The awkward intimacy of Ben & Alison's almost-forced relationship also provides touching and comic moments, as Apatow examines what happens 'when life doesn't care about your plan'. Even the serious, emotional scenes are laced with a sort of ironic, bittersweet humour, which again gives the characters a sense of realism but also makes the movie that bit more comfortable and reassuring.A subject that could have been treated with a crass touch, Apatow remains in tune with his previous effort, The 40 Year Old Virgin, and chooses to focus on the impact the pregnancy has on the lives of the characters, allowing their actions and interactions to create the comedy as they come to terms with their new situation. His light touch makes Knocked Up touching, insightful, and very, very, funny.",8,44,87,20 August 2007
Blades of Glory," Fantastically Overblown
","Blades of Glory is the story of Chazz Michael Michaels (Ferrel) and Jimmy MacElroy (Heder), two rival ice skaters banned from competition after a podium brawl at an 'Olympic' event. After Jimmy's stalker finds a loophole in the rulebook (yes, you read that right), the pair join forces to reclaim their rightful position at the top of the skating rankings.While it follows the predictable rise, fall, and rise again pattern of most comedies, Blades of Glory is different enough to be memorable. The costumes are ridiculous, the set-pieces are brilliant (including a very awkward chase sequence involving a crossbow and an unfortunate mascot), and the performances, what these films hinge on, are excellent.The Ferrel-Heder exchanges are drenched with homoeroticism, and their struggles to come to terms with each other's lifestyles (Ferrel: 'I'm a sex addict. It's my cross to bear' and Heder: 'If you can dream it, you can do it!') are funny enough to carry the film for large sections. The supporting performances of the Waldenbergs (Will Arnett, Amy Poelher, and Jenna Fischer) fill in the gaps successfully, their conversations charged with an unusual mix of villainy and incestuous desire. Then of course there are the skating scenes, which are quite a sight to behold, in all their spandex-and-diamonds splendour.Overall, Blades of Glory is hilarious. Pretty much every aspect of it is fantastically overblown, and it keeps you laughing quite steadily for its 90-minute running time. Boom!",8,150,247,12 April 2007
The Bourne Ultimatum," Edge of the seat stuff
","Jason Bourne sits in a dusty room in with blood on his hands, trying to make sense of what he's just done. Meanwhile, a CIA chief in NYC outlines the agency's response to what's just happened on screen. An American flag stands proudly on the centre of his desk in the foreground of the shot, but as he speaks, it slips out of focus as his plan veers into morally dubious territory, as if it doesn't want to be associated with the course of action the government man decides is necessary in the interests of national security.This shot effectively captures the mood of the film. As well as portraying Bourne's quest to find out how he became Jason Bourne, Ultimatum is also an examination of the human costs of the measures taken to protect us in the interests of stability and security.It is also probably the best film you'll see in the cinema this year. It's just so intense. Bourne says to Simon Ross (Considine) 'This isn't some newspaper story, this is real' and in the audience you almost believe him. The camera shakes, but remains steady enough for you to see everything and feel like you're there with Bourne as he tries to elude his pursuers, and the performances are so good that these guys seem as though they are the characters they're portraying, instead of just being actors performing well-written roles. The action scenes are so brutally fast-paced and well choreographed that they seem instinctive instead of planned to the minutest movement; the stunt-work is nothing short of amazing.The pacing is just incredible. It keeps driving forward towards its conclusion, but not so fast that it leaves you struggling to piece together the plot; the script delivers the information you need as quickly and clearly as possible before moving on to the next tense action set-piece. While they're often simple (the Waterloo sequence is essentially just a man on a phone being watched by a man on a phone) they're charged with such dramatic intensity that you can't take your eyes off them. The film is just so focused on powering forwards that you can't help being swept along by it.With its intense action set-pieces, brilliantly paced storyline, and intelligent examination of the decisions made in the name of national security, the Bourne series is one that accurately captures the ambiguities of our age. Ultimatum is its peak.",9,294,385,17 August 2007
Disturbia," a simple story well retold
","After the death of his father, Kale (LaBeouf) becomes angry and withdrawn. When he's failed in Spanish, he attacks his teacher, and is placed under house arrest for 3 months. Stripped of his mod cons (iTunes and xBox Live go out the window), he turns his attentions outside, and learns some disturbing truths about his suburban neighbourhood in a sinister take on the voyeuristic aspects of modern life.After making some loose connections between an ongoing missing persons case and one of his neighbours, Kale enlists his friends to help him find out what's going on. However, Kale is powerless to really influence events; if he leaves his garden, the police show up. It's a tool that works to great effect in terms of creating tension, placing him in the same position as the audience. He can only watch events as they play out outside his window and hope they turn out for the best, as we can only watch events on our screens and (presumably) hope for the same thing.There are obvious connections to Rear Window, the movie even being dubbed Rear Window for the MTV generation (although aren't we a bit past that now?), but while the original was a masterwork of suspense and doubt, Disturbia disposes of the subtlety and goes straight in for the kill with a surprisingly greasy David Morse and clichés aplenty (blood spatter, dark and stormy nights...).Of course, it requires some suspension of disbelief (where does an unemployed teen get the money for video home security systems?) but it is nonetheless an enjoyable, well-paced thriller. Good stuff.",7,54,87,21 August 2007
Saw III," More disgusting than involving
","A whimpering middle-aged man pulls against the chain around his leg that keeps him tied to the wall. Using his shoe, he desperately struggles to reach a torch inches out of his reach to shed some light on his situation. He reels it in, and we find ourselves looking at the remains of previous instalments of this horror trilogy; the hacksaw, a dead body, and of course, a severed ankle. Our whimpering middle-aged man looks at the ankle, at his chains, at his own ankle, and then his eyes rest upon the saw and I remember thinking 'No. Not again. Not again.' Not again indeed. He spies a concrete slab on the ground. After a period of consideration (which is clearly not long enough), he proceeds to crush his ankle, before twisting it out of the manacle with his bare hands. And to think I was relieved.Saw III throws you in the deep end. After a few more woefully graphic set-pieces (including a rather nasty ribcage removing machine), it calms down a bit to reveal a plot. Amanda (Shawnee Smith) kidnaps a nurse (Bahar Soomekh) in an attempt to prolong Jigsaw's (Tobin Bell) life, while simultaneously putting vengeful father Jeff (Angus Macfayden) through a series of grim trials, and while these plot lines are fairly detailed, you're given the impression that the plot and the actors only exist as an excuse for the writers to show the grotesque scenes that characterise the Saw trilogy.These moments crop up very often and are done very effectively. The quick cuts and close-ups reduce the audience to hiding behind their hands or wincing in a state of perpetual nervous discomfort, but they are thankfully well spaced out, allowing you some recovery time in between the film's more painful moments.However, they're more shocking than scary, and that's where this film falls flat. While the first film had the ability to shock and surprise you, the third appears to have given up on scares and just focuses on the repulsive. While Saw III is certainly good at what it does, in light of its predecessors what it does doesn't seem to be enough.",6,8,15,28 March 2007
The Number 23," Descends into absurdity
","Despite the critical negativity surrounding its initial release, I was quite excited when I heard that The Number 23 was coming out on DVD soon; I was strangely drawn to the promises of trashy, pseudo-intellectual entertainment made by the trailer and its absurd yet curiously intriguing plot. Such promises are unfortunately unfulfilled.Walter Sparrow (Jim Carrey) receives a book for his birthday. As he reads, he notices some parallels between the life of the novel's protagonist, Fingerling, and his own. Not an uncommon experience, many readers would argue. However, little details and numerical coincidences pop up more and more, and soon Walter's simple life is consumed by the novel.Soon, the lives of Walter and Fingerling blend together, allowing for some acting flourishes from Carrey as his typically oddball character descends into one of his typically neurotic characters at a questionably fast pace. His performance is well contrasted by Virginia Madsen, who takes on the role of his wife, and for the most part, the audience, as she criticises Walter's small revelations. Having read the book, she admits 'I didn't get it'. The idea is that by the end, we'll come around. But we don't.For some reason, at around the halfway point, it lunges forward as if the middle act has been left on the cutting room floor, perhaps in a bid to keep the running time at an ADD-friendly 90 minutes. Carrey is suddenly a lunatic, despite being a little over halfway through the novel at best, and 23 turns into a Scooby-Doo-ish murder mystery as the family jump in the van and track down an escaped murderer. It just falls apart and leaves you wondering what might have been.The expository ending ties up the loose ends re-establishes some coherency on the disorder, but nevertheless, the film ends with its biggest question left unanswered: if your surname was Sparrow, why would you name your son Robin?",3,46,91,8 August 2007
Ghost Rider," reasonably entertaining
","Nicolas Cage seems to have a random process for selecting movie roles. The man who won an Oscar for his self-destruction in Leaving Las Vegas has also taken on action movies such as Face/Off and Con Air with great success, and has even found the time to star in family films such as National Treasure. It's not with great surprise then that we find him as Johnny Blaze, a motorcycle stuntman by day who, via a clichéd twist of fate, becomes a fiery vigilante by night after selling his soul to the Devil. The plot was clearly not a priority, and it seems to have been overtaken by the CGI, which is successful in its attempt to adapt the comic book style to the big screen. While it never looks real (how real can a man with a flaming skull for a head look?), it's impressive, especially as computer-Cage rides down particularly tall buildings and jumps helicopters. Cage, ever the over-actor, takes to his role with a typical eccentric enthusiasm that effectively sums up the spirit of Ghost Rider: sit back, switch off, and enjoy the ride.",6,11,21,28 March 2007
Mulholland Drive," Contains mild mental anguish.
","Well well well. David Lynch's Mulholland Drive does, at first, appear all over the place. It appears relatively slow moving for the first quarter. It seems to be a mix of disconnected, poorly acted, irrelevant scenes (what *was* the psychiatrist in the diner scene about?) but unfortunately, it is far from that. From the outset Lynch riddles Mulholland Drive with clues as to what is really going on...it is just up to the viewer to play close attention.Suddenly things pick up. People get shot, there are laughs, there's a ridiculously over-the-top Mafia subplot, and there are lesbians. And then it all goes to Hell with Club Silencio. Just as you think you're starting to pick it up, Betty has a fit, and Lynch pulls his audience through a mentally devastating final quarter, complete with a maze of skipping timeframes, symbolism, and crazy old people.The end kills you. 'Silencio'. You know it's going to end like that (probably the only thing you can actually call before it happens) and then you sit there and try to wrap your head around it. Lynch leaves clues, literally (in the box), and metaphorically (in the film), and even with these, it's impossible to completely understand absolutely everything. I looked it up; there are loads of internet sites explaining what you've just witnessed (but none of them cover that blue box...) and you feel better for understanding it (although part of you wishes you got it yourself), and I think only then can you really appreciate it. Watching it without understanding it or trying to understand it results in dismissives ('what?' 'it's crap' and so on) but enjoying Mulholland Drive comes through understanding, be it self-deduced or taught.Unfortunately the complicated thematic workings somewhat overshadow what is a quite special performance from Naomi Watts, playing the roles of amateur small-town wannabe actress and jealous lover brilliantly, a performance complimented by the timid temptress of Laura Harring and Justin Theroux's arrogant yet cool director (jewellry in paint? awesome). It's difficult to keep up and notice anything else.If you put in the time to understand it, or at least find out about it, you'll enjoy it. If you don't, you won't. It's as simple as that.",8,5,11,1 February 2006
Saw," Who wins?
","Before I saw this film, I'd heard it was messed up, but I figured I'd probably seen worse. I'd sat through Se7en, with it's implied razor-dildo scene, the twitching and general creepiness of the original Ring films, and god knows what else.Saw is, however, something else.I'm not even sure if it's entertainment. I just sat on the edge of my seat for nearly two hours, waiting for it to be over and everything to be alright again. As a horror film it works fantastically well; it holds its audience, is next to unguessable, and frequently throws out scenes that make you jump. It also engages its audience really well and I don't think I've ever screamed so much at the screen watching a film; never have I wanted a bad guy to cop it in the most gruesome way so much and been left so consitently frustrated.In keeping with the recent trend in horror flms, the end leaves you with nothing. Nobody wins. Most of the characters end up dead. I suppose we can be glad the kid wasn't shot, but then some guy hacked off his own ankle, which kinda evens that out. It's frustrating because it's so well made but just...eats away at your soul for two hours. It causes no lasting damage, but you come away wondering what sort of mind could come up with something like this. And then make a sequel. And announce a third.Clever, well-made, exciting and scary, Saw is definitely worth watching and creates a lasting impression.",8,6,12,30 October 2005
Total Recall," Get your ass to Mars
","This movie is on TV in the UK on some sort of cycle, and I end up seeing parts of it every two months or so, and every time you see it you pick out new things. I think this was the third time I'd seen the start; they really didn't want him to go to Mars, did they? Fifteen years on the effects don't really look that dated, which is a bit of surprise. In honesty it doesn't use too many bar the mutant freakshow and the comic head-expanding at the end, but it's hard to recall other sci-fi's from the early nineties that haven't aged terribly. The storyline doesn't have a lot of depth and isn't going to inspire a new generation of science fiction writers, and the acting isn't particularly subtle, but it's great. After all, it's Arnie. He beats people up, some things explode, drops in a few hammed up one liners, and he keeps us entertained. What more can you ask for?",7,5,9,17 November 2005
The Descent," Slow to start but worth the wait
","The Descent is the tale of a group of girls who go caving. Naturally, things aren't quite what they seem, and things start to go very wrong very quickly. The first section of the film aims to provide us with some background, some character development, so that we can differentiate between the girls later, when they're alone in the dark. As a result, impaling aside, this section's quite slow and drags on a bit. Once they go caving and the film properly starts though, it gets a lot more exciting. The scares are well paced, and they're effective even when it's pretty obvious that they're coming up; credit to the claustrophobic atmosphere of the caves for this. A lot of the film is without music, the silence truly eerie, and the lighting is also very effective. The use of headlamps and night-vision in certain sections makes sudden movement almost impossible to track and therefore quite scary. Nonetheless, it's still a little slow until the ego's take over underground. As the girls argue, they are being tracked by something that's been living in the cave and is none too pleased with their intrusion. Being stalked underground by a highly developed hunter is quite a freaky premise, and as a result you're left in a perpetual state of unease for the rest of the film as it turns from a girls night out into an underground zombie movie. This is a good thing, and it rattles along at a high pace for the second half, which makes The Descent tense, uncomfortable but ultimately enjoyable viewing. Worth it!",8,7,15,5 April 2007
Inside Man," smart, interesting, and entertaining
","'Inside Man' tells the story of a bank robbery hostage situation that we've all seen done and done well many times before. However, the creators of 'Inside Man' (the Inside Man, surely?) know this, and as a result Spike Lee's take on the heist movie has a few tricks up its sleeve.The minute Dalton (Clive Owen) introduces the movie you know something's different, and his distant yet smug tone draws you in to his perfect crime. It's a role Clive plays well: he is smart but dark, violent and aggressive yet ironically emerges as the film's moral centre, evident by not only in his motive for the robbery, but in the prejudiced attitudes of everybody else. The attitudes, actions, and assumptions made by civilians and NYPD alike (especially when Vikram, the Sikh teller, is released from the bank to cries of 'Is it a bomb?') demonstrate the many small injustices that occur everyday, and these incidents shock the audience more than the larger scale injustice taking place in the form of a bank robbery just metres away. While the bank job is Clive's machine, most of the acting falls into Denzel Washington's lap, and he performs well as the cop trying to juggle the immense responsibility of hostage negotiation with his personal concerns. Jodie Foster also performs well as the prissy...whatever it is that she does.The plot thickens and unfolds until it would seem that no crime has taken place. Denzel is eventually told to 'bury it', and unfortunately the final half hour of the film suffers a similar fate as the plot disappears under an avalanche of over-morality in the meeting between Foster and the bank owner (Christopher Plummer). Earlier in the film Denzel asks a cop to cut down on the 'colour commentary' during a story, and you can't help but wonder why Spike didn't take this advice as the audience are provided with the tale of an old rich white man and his blood money while Denzel pursues his case till its closure and the film to its end. This is however all forgiven thanks to the very last minute of the film as Denzel cheekily grins at the screen, having worked it all out and come out on top.Moralizing aside, this is a smart, well-acted and entertaining film that is thoroughly enjoyable and well worth a look.",9,9,14,16 August 2006
Downfall," Powerful Stuff
","Downfall seeks to chart the final days of the Third Reich as both Germany and Adolf Hitler stand on the brink of collapse, as the Russians advance to the heart of Berlin.It is difficult to gauge whether or not Downfall is a great film or not. It seems that any film offering alternative insight to the Second World War is generally well received as either outstanding (Das Boot, 1981) or at worst, thought provoking and slightly unnerving (Max, 2002), and Downfall is a combination of all these factors.To a certain extent, it's well acted. Bruno Ganz puts in an intense performance as Hitler, his mood swaying from quiet mourning to the brutal ruthlessness we all know him for, as he visibly degenerates as the war takes its toll on his sanity. What is important is that he remains unlikeable. Ganz makes him a bit more human, without engaging the audience on terms of empathy. He isn't seeking sympathy for the Devil, but is creating an accurate portrait of a man with history watching his every move. I know very little about history and the films accuracy, making the other characters simple types for me. They do an effective job but I've got nothing to base them on.Downfall doesn't shy away from the more harrowing scenes of war either, focusing largely on the children drawn into it. Audiences are used to seeing soldiers and civilians die, largely thanks to Steven Spielberg, but seeing Nazi Youth soldiers executed by their superiors before they're killed by the Russians is more than what we're used to. The scene in which Magda Goebbels (Corinna Harfouch) poisons all of her children is the best (not quite the right word) example of this and is obviously chilling, as the innocents are punished for the crimes of their parents, in their sleep, no less. I was very relieved none of them woke up.However, there is no one to root for here. We all know how it ends (although not exactly how) and Traudl Junge (Alexandra Maria Lara) is perhaps too simple a character to really engage with. For this reason, Downfall is second best to character based efforts such as Spielberg's Schindler's List (1993) and Polanski's The Pianist (2002).While it is heavy stuff, and more than a little though provoking, there isn't enough emotional connection here for it to be a classic.",7,11,15,3 March 2006
Shooter," Honour. Duty. Betrayal. Cliché.
","Shooter opens with Swagger (Wahlberg) in the middle of a failing black-op in Ethiopia. His spotter is killed, and he's left for dead by the agency that sent him in, leaving him to somehow escape the situation on his own. Cut to 3 years later, and Marky Mark is set up in a ranch in the snowy mountains in a remote location, sporting an awful haircut, and owning perhaps the best dog in the world. His reclusive existence is interrupted by Colonel Johnson (Glover), who arrives with a mysterious offer that he just can't refuse...It sounds a bit...obvious, doesn't it? For a man who's been betrayed by his government once before, Wahlberg falls for Glover's dubious plan a little too easily. And it doesn't even seem like he's trying to conceal the duplicitous nature of the operation. Glover plays his role like Nosferatu in a suit; I half expected him to bite into Wahlberg's neck, although he obviously couldn't find the time in between his evil-caricature gestures and husky whispering. Taking the bait, Swagger sets himself up for quite a fall, and, luckily for us, quite an enjoyable film. Cue the government conspiracy and the one-man-killing-machine's mission to reveal the truth...During his quest to clear his name, Wahlberg finds allies in the form of rookie FBI Agent Nick Memphis (well played by Michael Pena) and his former spotters' girlfriend Sarah, played by Kate Mara, and these two partnerships affect the film in quite different ways. When Swagger is teamed up with Memphis, Shooter plays out like an action-heavy buddy movie, but when Swagger's placed in the care of Sarah and the movie's romantic dramatic sub-plot is gestured at, it slows down awkwardly. We know Marky Mark has to recover from his bullet-wounds somewhere, but perhaps it could have been the recovery that was suggested instead of the awkward forbidden romance scenes that this pairing generates. The rest of the supporting cast are generally good, although a special mention should go to Elias Koteas for his role as Glover's oversexed supervillain henchman, who provides a great deal of sex-fiend-caricature entertainment. That being said, Wahlberg's presence is missed and the film appears to jar awkwardly and slow down without him. Without his moral outrage and willingness to shoot his way through his problems, the movie loses its momentum. While it handles similar issues to the Bourne franchise (government hunter becomes hunted) and attempts to make the same sort of contemporary political statements, Shooter doesn't quite have the same sort of grittiness. Instead, its polished look, complete with lush landscapes and Fuqua's sun-soaked direction, seems to nod continuously in the direction of Michael Bay. However, that's not a bad thing. The movie is very set-piece oriented, and Swagger's gung-ho approach keeps things moving forward at a relatively exciting pace. The only problem is that it never really seems like Swagger's in any real danger, despite the fact that he's being chased by pretty much every law enforcement agency in America (social comment, perhaps?). This makes the film quite predictable, its sequences and dialogue clichéd, and its conclusion pretty much an obvious inevitability, but if you just sit back and accept it for what it is, you'll find Shooter an enjoyable, action-packed movie that's worth a look.",7,16,23,3 November 2007
1408," different, subtle, and very, very good
","Please note that this review refers to the theatrical version, and not the Director's Cut DVD release which features a completely different ending.Mike Enslin is a cynic. He is the author of books that detail and debunk popular ghost stories and haunted hot-spots, and it quickly becomes obvious that he is somewhat disenchanted with the life that he leads. That is, of course, until he receives an invitation to Room 1408 at the Dolphin Hotel, a room in which lies his and arguably John Cusack's biggest challenge yet.It soon becomes apparent that 1408 is not your standard horror movie, as what follows, after an enjoyably creepy encounter with hotel manager Gerald Olin (Samuel L Jackson), is essentially 90 minutes of John Cusack in a room. On his own. Save for, of course, whatever lurks inside 1408. It is a challenge that Cusack rises to expertly; we all know he's a good actor and a brilliant everyman (I don't remember a film in which I've wanted to see him crash and burn), but 1408 allows him to display his range to great effect as the room confronts him with the physical dangers of the present and the emotional tragedies of his past. While it's relatively light on big scares, 1408 instead creates a powerful sense of unease that combines wonderfully with Cusack's portrayal of a man enduring his own private hell. Each challenge thrown up by the room takes the movie somewhere new and unexpected, ensuring that the movie never really gets tired or repetitive, and as a result each scene in the room is tense, surprising, and very, very creepy. However, that's not to say that it doesn't lose its way occasionally. Some of the CGI usage is quite ineffective, and about two-thirds through the movie it feels like it's about to go the wrong way, but it recovers well for the final act, and its haunting ending ensures that you'll remember it long after you leave the theatre.A brilliantly acted, well developed version of King's short story, 1408 is a different type of horror movie, but in all the right ways. Very good!",9,151,190,4 September 2007
The Thin Red Line," War in Arcadia
","The Thin Red Line is not your typical World War Two film. Instead of focusing on battles and heroes, Malick's film looks at a group of soldiers fighting in the Guadalcanal, at their responses to the situations they've been put in.The best thing about the film is its (Oscar nominated) cinematography. Every shot looks like a work of art, and while this is largely helped out by it's tropical setting, you can tell a great deal of thought and care has gone into every scene. Some of the landscapes are amazing, and Malick even finds time to fit them into the battle scenes, the natural beauty of the island providing a stark contrast to the savagery of the battle it hosts. Hans Zimmer's (again Oscar nominated) score is also hugely effective, a fine example of this being when the Cusack-led attack on the bunker starts to go awry as it highlights the toll the battle takes on the psyche of the soldiers.Key performances come from the calculated, ruthless Colonel Tall (Nick Nolte), and the 'soft' Captain Staros (Elias Koteas), but the cast is a bit too big and indistinguishable to really note anyone else. Whilst Jim Caviezel has the biggest role, he doesn't so much as as philosophically muse his way through the film, until he daydreams into his death. Such philosophical musings and mental interludes are obviously the basis of the film, but in my opinion they're used too regularly to be genuinely effective. There are only so many flashbacks you can watch and 'gee, isn't nature beautiful' sentiments you can listen to before they grow old and hamper the film's progress.It's fantastically shot, but in my opinion too many philosophical ramblings hold back what could have been a better film.",7,7,14,5 March 2006
