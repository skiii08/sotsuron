Blade Runner 2049," I was drawn in by the visuals, graphics and women
","Blade Runner 2049 of course came with its own expectations and a bar that was set quite high. I was drawn in by the promise of that universe, the graphics and the giant holographic woman and was not disappointed. The CGI and the building, as well as the beautiful women were what I expected. I wish I had a 'wife' that pretty.Unfortunately, again the bar was set high, but this film did not deliver. There are too many loose ends and the film does not give the audience a conclusion. The major surprise regarding replicants and what they can do is also a bridge too far. I do agree that the film is slow, which coupled with the lack of a conclusion brings my rating down.6/10",6,146,250,23 October 2017
