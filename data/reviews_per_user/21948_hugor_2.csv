Blade Runner 2049," Not that great. Worth a watch though.
","I love the original, have watched it multiple times, and i still am impressed by Rutger Hauer on it to this day.As for Blade Runner 2049, it is a visual masterpiece, no doubt about it, but it's just not a great movie, sadly. Plot holes galore, no memorable character, weird decisions throughout, missed out on interesting aspects to explore about the world and certain events on it... it just has too many issues.Still worth a watch, absolutely, especially if you liked the original Blade Runner, but don't expect 'the best sci-fi movie ever' or other similar wild claims that people seem to be making.7/10, could have been great, but has too many issues.",7,0,3,6 January 2018
Star Wars: Episode IX - The Rise of Skywalker," The end of an era.
","To be fair, my rating is more related to the entire saga than this specific end episode, but it worked for me. It's the fitting end for the saga that over the span of decades lit my imagination.Yes, the latest trilogy has some issues, and some downs, but it's Star Wars, and i will always cherish it.Fantastic saga, in which i include the trilogies and the amazing Rogue One.I'm pretty sure i'll rewatch it all at least once a year.",10,5,12,23 December 2019
