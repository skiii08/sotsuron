The Sound of Music," A beloved classic for all time!
","This is indeed one of my most beloved films, ever! Yes, yes, yes. It may be somewhat saccahrine and a wee bit trite, but who cares! It's good clean family fun, which is what the world is seriously lacking when it comes to the cinema these days.I first saw this film when I was 7 yrs. old on television. My 2nd grade teacher recommended that my class watch it and that we would discuss it the following week. I instantly fell in love with this film. The scenery. The children. The puppet show. The songs. The music. Oooh, the music!! Unforgettable til this day.I was one of the 18,000 fans at the Hollywood Bowl Sound of Music Sing-a-long Festival back in 2005, and seeing this wonderful film with so many people who also really love this movie, was an incredible experience that I will never, ever forget. All of the actors were there at the event, except of course Ms. Andrews and Mr. Plummer. I got to meet most of the actors and took pictures with them, which was a thrill of a lifetime, I assure you.In any case, this movie means so much to me. It is and forever will be a classic for generations to come.",10,3,10,3 October 2008
Revolutionary Road," Not as powerful as the book, but definitely worth seeing.
","I read the novel by Richard Yates a little while ago, and I must say, Sam Mendes & Co., did an excellent job at paying an enormous tribute to this American masterpiece.I think Mr. Yates would've been very proud, even if much of the emotional wallop written so profoundly in the book, wasn't completely translated onto film. The novel left me gutted, raw, totally blown away by its shocking intensity and excruciating truths. I felt almost the same way after watching this incredible film, however, the experience wasn't nearly as visceral for me. But then, books have a way of gripping our senses much more palpably than cinema at times.This film was superbly acted. I cannot overstate this enough. However, the pace of the film left me feeling like I was reading 'cliff notes' of the novel. Like we were given only a skeleton of Yates' fleshy, meaty, gut-wrenching tale of 1950's suburbia. Kate and Leo are very much at the top of their game here. The fact that neither one of them got an Oscar nom for their respective roles in this heartrending film leaves me profoundly perplexed. They both acted their butts off! I am pleased that Michael Shannon got a nom for his amazing contribution, but the sheer audacious exclusion of a Best Picture, Best Director, Best Actor, Best Actress nomination leaves me fuming. The Academy needs to seriously (and quickly) buy a vowel.The novel stands the test of time. It is remarkable. A literary masterpiece in every single way. It's amazing how Mr. Yates' words continue to reverberate after all this time, and I'm certain he would have been very, very pleased with the powerful resonance of this film.",8,1,2,24 January 2009
The Dark Knight," Entertaining, but NOT a masterpiece. Uh-uh. Not by a longshot.
","Wow. Can't believe how high the rating is for this film on IMDb. Did we all see the SAME film?? Wow.Okay, just got back from seeing this, and I gotta say, I was very, very disappointed. Overall, the movie had its moments, but maaaan oh maaaan, was this movie WAY TOO LONG. And unnecessarily so. So far, Christian Bale has proved to be a satisfying Batman, but NO ONE has lived up to my vision of what Batman should truly be up on the big screen. That said, let's move on.THE VIEWING EXPERIENCE: The WORSE PART about this movie for me was the editing. It was unforgivably choppy. Too many scenes ended too abruptly and I guess a whole lot of stuff happened off camera because there were a considerable amount of 'GAPING PLOT HOLES'. THE ACTION: Very intense from the beginning which was great, but the movie peetered out toward the end. That whole scene with Harvey Dent holding Gordon's family hostage was just way too long and too over the top. Dent's transformation into evil happened too quickly, which made his descent into 'Bat-Villain' unconvincing. It was like he was having a very bad tantrum, that's all. He needed to be spanked or hugged. Nope. Despite what you may read, there wasn't ANYTHING poetic about it. Sorry, Freudians. COOLEST SCENES: I really liked the confrontation scene at the jail between Batman and The Joker. Great, great stuff. Batman was extremely close to 'losin' it' and I thought for a second he just may kill him, he just might snap and do it. But nah. Batman isn't nearly as amoral as ol' Clown Face. Another scene I liked was when Batman was in Hong Kong kickin' some baddies asses, then he grabs the head honcho Asian dude(can't remember his name, sorry), launches some balloon thingy in the sky, hooks himself and the baddie to an oncoming plane (which of course was all arranged...I wonder who was flying the thing? Lucius?) which takes off into the night sky. That scene was TIGHT. Executed brilliantly. MOST MEMORABLE SCENES: The Joker making that pencil 'disappear.' The Joker walking away in a nurse's uniform as bombs go off behind him. Classic. Those images will stay with me for a long, long time.COOLEST TOY: The Batpod. Geeks will cheer.PERFORMANCES: Heath Ledger was good, yes. Did he give me chills and simply blow me away? Sadly, no. But perhaps I was expecting WAY TOO MUCH. After all, the buzz on his performance as The Joker started way back in January. Does he deserve a posthumous Oscar? No. An Oscar nomination should more than suffice for the 'kudos' he's been getting. His death is what has swayed, or rather, 'manipulated' people to say this is the most incredible performance ever seen on screen. Don't be so gullible. It's a good performance, don't get me wrong. But it's not history making. However, Heath now makes Nicholson's Joker look as campy and as ridiculous as Cesar Romero. Christian Bale had his moments; so did Aaron Eckhart. Gary Oldman is always a pleasure to watch. Morgan Freeman and Michael Caine will always be veterans of their craft. Everyone else could have phoned it in.THE MUSIC: Not memorable. And in some scenes, shrill and annoying. Where or WHERE is Danny Elfman? WHAT BUGGED ME THE MOST: Batman's gravelly, and super LOUD voice. It sounded completely ridiculous and over-amplified. Not menacing. Just ridiculous. I thought the script tried too hard to send a message. What we got was sophomoric rhetoric which was overly 'preachy'.THE ENDING: A dud. Even though the movie was an agonizing 2.5 hours, I still felt something was missing. Batman being 'hunted down' by Gordon and the GCPD was lame. The Nolan brothers should've written a much more satisfying ending. I felt cheated. There was not enough of a satisfying denouement for The Joker. He was just left hanging there upside down, giggling like a school girl on crack. They should've given The Joker a much more satisfying final scene. Like that last shot of Anthony Perkins in 'Psycho', staring chillingly into the camera. Joker's exit should have been just as memorable and just as SCARY. What they gave us was WEAK. Pure and simple. And that really, really SUCKS since it was indeed Heath's final scene. His final image up on the big screen doing what he loved the most. They could've given him a better tribute than that. WHAT I'D LIKE TO HAVE SEEN: The Joker being FUNNY. Come on, people! That's what The Joker has ALWAYS been about. Not campy, but funny. Heath's interpretation of The Joker was nothing like in the comics. I understand the Nolan brothers wanting to be dark and all that, but let's get real and stick to story origins, okay? The Joker is a demented psychopath yes, but he's also supposed to be wickedly funny. You know, laughing at his own sick twisted humor. We got NONE OF THAT from Heath's portrayal. What he played was a character who should've been named The Sicko. Or The Money Burner. Or Chaos Man. In any case, the Nolan brothers, to me, failed to give us The Joker we all really wanted to see. Again, I liked Heath's performance. I did. But there was still so much missing. OVERALL REVIEW: I was entertained by this film, but was sadly disappointed with the pacing, the editing and some of the gaping plot holes. And what sucks is that I'm a HUGE Batman fan. HUGE!!! I SOOOO wanted this film to be a masterpiece, but it wasn't. Not by a longshot.I actually gave this movie a 6 out of 10 stars, but most of you made this movie's rating on IMDb just unforgivably TOO HIGH.",1,16,42,18 July 2008
