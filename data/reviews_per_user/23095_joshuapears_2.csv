Abraham Lincoln: Vampire Hunter," Bad movie of book
","For most people this would be an good or average movie, but for me it was just bad start to finish, just because, apart from the characters and places, nothing in the movie is like the book at all, and for this reason I think the movie ruined the book. One of Abe's first lovers, was missed out from the movie, which really makes a hole in the plot as she is supposed to change Abe as a character. Further more Abe's mother (in the movie) doesn't speak to Abe in her last moments, the words that compel Lincoln to do what he does.I know it is hard to show a characters thought in a movie, but it doesn't show his suicidal thoughts after each character's death!Overall it wasn't a bad movie, but it was a poor movie based on the book.",2,2,3,18 August 2014
Guardians of the Galaxy," Amazing!
","Words cannot explain the thoughts I have on this movie. Unlike the new X-Men, I think the more you think about it, the more you like it, although both movies were equally good. Guardians has a good humor vibe throughout the movie with a compelling plot and an ultimately brilliant outcome of a movie. I may even see it again! I have read the comics before the movie was thought of and let me tell you, it was very true to the characters, and let me say, I had doubts about Vin Diesel's talent between Groot's small role in speech, but now I don't think anybody else could have matched how well he performed. Marvel can surely be at the top of greatness at the moment with it's movies, however I highly doubt that and I cannot wait for the next installment of superhero action brought to us by Marvel. Roll on Josh Brolin and his take on Thanos!",10,15,23,26 August 2014
