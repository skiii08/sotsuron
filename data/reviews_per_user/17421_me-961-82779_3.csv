The Avengers," OK....for what it's trying to be.
","I appreciate this film for what it is. An all out action popcorn movie that aims to wow the audience with its cutting edge effects, fancy camera work and ability to not have to think, and just sit back. The plot was pretty simple and nothing new in terms of old clich√©d, alien guy tries to take over the world with his army and big doomsday device scenario with an ending we have seen a million times before with a 'Lets destroy a city with as much explosions and CGI as possible' chapter. Don't get me wrong, they did a great job with it. Some of the camera work was excellent, much better than Micheal Bay's close up and shake the camera around everywhere technique. But for me personally I don't like being overwhelmed with all the CGI and the camera taking me away from the characters involvement of the scene and scenario and focusing on the effects. The only thing that kept me going till the end was the humor. If it was not for that I would have rated this film as just another bland CGI bonanza. A good attempt, but for me, not as amazing as everyone is making it out to be. The effect's are amazing, the humor is good, but everything else..seen it before..bored of it.",6,7,20,29 April 2012
The Amazing Spider-Man," Could have been better - If it knew what it wanted to be.
","Yet another disappointing superhero 'blockbuster'. I don't think this film can quite work out what it wanted to be. At times there were elements of a darker more serious tone which worked well. But then these moments were spoiled with the usual fast camera editing style of the action scenes which at some points you could not work out what was going on (though I suppose if your of the Call of Duty & Transformers generation this will be appealing to you). Absolutely nothing new or interesting in the terms of plot , the same old good guy who accidentally turns himself bad and ends in a CGI city fight like almost all these Superhero action films endings. Convenient and predictable scenes (the crane scene at the end is just laughable). Good points - I like the new Spiderman, he really captures the 'Smart Ass' style Spiderman well and is a lot better than the Emo-Spiderman the other one was.",5,51,106,4 July 2012
The Dark Knight Rises," Batman overtakes the birth of my children on my 'Magic Moments' list.
","Nothing will ever come close to the birth of my first child. Well...that's what I thought anyway...and then Christopher Nolan got his hands on the Batman franchise...A brilliant ending to the trilogy. It's so refreshing and so worth the final result when a director chooses to use live action rather than CGI for all (well most) of the action scenes. The pacing was a lot better than The Dark Knight which I felt sometimes didn't really build well throughout and was unbalanced between action / character scenes. Though this time the bulk of the action is left towards the end with a great build up of character though the film which really leaves you actually caring about the characters at the end (unlike most CGI fest superhero films where you couldn't really care). Even though the plot resembles the first film a lot (which I suppose it connected to the 'full-circle' talk of the whole series) the new characters kept the film interesting. The only downside for me was Bane. Don't get me wrong, Tom did a great job and he was a great character. He just wasn't really as much as a terrifying character than The Joker and we only really had his eyes and voice to go on as far as emotion went (the latter was a slight disappointment as I spent half the time trying to work out what he was saying). BUT...don't worry there is a great twist to make up for this ;-) Once again Gotham looks great as does the cinematography as a whole. Like the characters the place feels real and somewhere we should really care about and not just another city to destroy in another CGI fest bonanza at the end. I'm not 100% sure if it was the projector at the cinema (which I think it may have been) but my only gripe was some of the scenes seemed a little too dark to the point that I couldn't work out what was happening.Overall a fantastic ending to a great trilogy. I appreciate films like Avengers for what they are, but for me, this approach to using live action and real characters just makes me care about the overall product a lot more.",8,2,6,20 July 2012
