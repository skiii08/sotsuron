First Man," Could have been better
",This film is no where near as good as it could have been. There is no focus on who Armstrong really was. He was a brilliant engineer and one of the best pilots to ever live. Ryan Gosling isn't the right actor to play such a diverse hero. The story didn't focus enough on the actual team like Apollo 13 did. It's almost like the only person that landed on the moon was Armstrong. I wouldn't waste your time with this film. Maybe watch it for free once it's released.,1,2,3,23 January 2019
