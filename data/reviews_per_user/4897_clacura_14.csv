Captain Phillips," Perfection...
","Tom Hanks post shooting scene was simply brilliant with the female officer with a perfect musical score. One of the best acting performances ever. These low scores are pathetic. People, this is not a video game, this was real life and comfortable liberal fools who take freedom for granted are a disgrace to this country. We have millennials who have watched more movies by the age of ten than those over 40 that cannot discern reality. What should be shocking is how thugs in a motorboat could take control of a massive shipping vessel. This is what was unbelievable. What dipshots would not have military protection going through known hostile waters but liberals who think they can talk their way out of evil? Again, real life verses video games. So when pirates get shot and killed some gripe? Really? Pathetic. You piss on American freedom because you can...and that is the core issue. In America you can be a liberal fool and still have a voice. Max Martini was perfectly cast and Yul Vazquez was excellent...remember him from Seinfeld? Yeah, same actor. Paul Greengrass directed a masterpiece. This was filmmaking at its best and if you dont get that, you dont get much. Made my point yes? Out.",10,0,2,24 September 2019
The Equalizer," Hollywood Version of Mentoring
","Take the action portion out from this movie and we see an older man who gains a sense of purpose defending and mentoring the young. If just for this message, this movie is worth viewing! There is a dignity Denzel's character gives to life. Whatever his true inner purpose, he is taking action to help those in need. Yes, it is the Hollywood version of a human with superhero skills. I guess it is simply too much to make a movie of just a normal guy or gal who gives to others. The subtext here is important--we need mentors, especially those who can defend the weak, innocent, and vulnerable! It gives hope and restores dignity from those who rob it.",8,1,3,20 February 2018
Deepwater Horizon," Deepwater is HOT as Hell
","I usually hate CGI, but the director and his team got it right on this one! WOW! Wahlburg keeps playing these hero characters and has taken below average talent as an actor to the limit. Evidently, he is box office gold because he works consistently.For those who want this to be Lone Survivor, guess what...it is a different movie! Yes, it played like so many other movies where the director lays the first thirty mins with backstory, hoping to develop identity. This played very similar to Ladder 49 years ago.I was surprised to see Nic Cage with such a small role. Same with John Malkovich, but we got to see some classic Malkovich'isms in his character. Kurt Russell never disappoints. He can become believable in a minute to his character.This movie was very emotional (again, credit to the director) and Wahlberg did a good job, especially when he broke down in the hotel room. The relationship he had with his wife laid the foundation that this was a man of character and that they were deeply in love with each other.The BP oil guys seemed clich√©, but if that really happened, and I believe it did, we see how; 'you cannot get a man to understand something when his career depends upon him NOT understanding.' Bottom line, one's loyalty to company blinds him/her of truth. We are all guilty of this in some manner.Watch this movie in the theater. It is very intense! That said, how many commercials can one take before the movie starts? Are you kidding me? No wonder people stay home. I paid the price of admission, leave the commercials to TV! Absolutely ridiculous.",7,0,0,12 October 2016
Public Enemies," Ummm, No!
","I just watched a ytube video of some session musicians covering a famous drummer who passed. First thought was, 'Oh boy...' and after 30 seconds of the first tune Gaucho, I knew the drummer did not do his homework and pissed all over the groove. How can this happen!Michael Mann is the same...he seems so into trying too hard to create art he misses the mark. Dillinger was boring, horribly boring. Watch Steve McQueen in The Great St Louise Robbery and it is a better movie than this! That is not saying much because that was basically a low-budget semi-documentary in 1958.Johnny Depp and Mann are a perfect match...guys that think too much. Christian Bale on the other hand knows how to act. Deep has become a personality more than actor over the past years. I looked forward to this movie but could not make it through. That has to be the worst reaction to a director's 2-3 years of planning and effort, your audience left early!",3,0,2,15 April 2018
Home Alone," The Willy Wonka of a New Generation!
","John Hughes hit every detail with this movie! it is a timeless classic of filmmaking every bit as significant as any dramatic movie. Why? Well, watch it. It has everything. This film should be studied by students and a class taught on how to make a great movie.The atmosphere is perfect. The house, the neighborhood...it all is perfection. The snow, the Santa Shop, the grocery store, it all works as the template or canvas for this Hughes painting.Casting. Mom and dad are perfect. They play their parts subdued to let the main characters shine. All the kids blend in. Even Santa Claus is played to perfection...guy is smoking and off to a card game, car won't start. The pizza kid...Casting the B and C roles is just as important as the A roles.Pace & tempo. The film builds well. Joe Pesci as the officer scouting the neighborhood with the gold tooth...not over done. By the time Kevin defends his house we are all in.Of course no 8yo would be able to pull off what Kevin did, but this is part of a movie and it works so well we believe it for two hours because the fun is so good. This is family entertainment...all ages will enjoy this. The old man is brilliant, again, the casting is perfection and the storyline very believable. We all knew that old guy in the neighborhood that had a scary story.Culkin should have been nominated for an Oscar his performance was that good. The church scene with the old man was a director's dream come true. There are so many detailed plot lines that merge together like the tarantula, hitting the house metal sculpture, the gold tooth, a John Candy cameo...the only other movie of this generation that hit all these marks was Back to the Future. Same brilliance and attention to detail. You can watch BTTF 10 times and catch something new each visit.The reason we don't have many of these movies is because it is hard to pull off. This was major effort and Hughes was the master of this style.",10,0,0,2 April 2020
Yes Man," If It's Mediocre, Blame the Director!
","The problem with Jim Carrey is not Jim Carrey...it is the mediocre directors that do not do their homework! This is a movie studio problem. Number one factor is identify what your star does better than anyone else, what makes them unique. Habit one: Begin with the end in mind. This is a thinking skill few seem to possess.What does Carrey do brilliantly? We saw a few Carreyisms which are littered throughout his film and Living Color performances. In Yes Man, it was the scene where he grabs the guitar and sings the guy off the ledge, but it was immediately after he pulls him into the office, he does a British accent of a rock musician. Totally unexpected addition to a scene. That is LOL stuff. That is where his magic takes place.Give him a story to grab hold of, that is a writer's job. Jim could play the role here similar to Norm MacDonald--a goofy guy that has a deeper soul underneath. Jim can stay on surface as Mr Silly, but as the story moves on, show a deeper side, a side that makes connections to soul most people miss and ignore in real life. Compare this to the shallow businessman focused on his portfolio using whomever along the way (the norm) and Jim is in this world, but not part of it--he is actually more courageous but it takes time to see this. That is a story people can connect with, the part that says, 'I really want to have more courage, but truth is, I am a conformist...like everyone else and afraid to take risks.'Look at Jim's life today...where has he gone? He has gone the metaphysical, seeker direction to the point of evangelist for his cause. How could Hollydumb not see this coming? There is nothing more powerful than a comedy with soul!",6,0,0,11 June 2018
Mission: Impossible - Ghost Protocol," Light Hearted MI
","Very different than the first MI...far less serious. I liked the humor and light hearted JJ Abrams feel but a few things would have made this far better...and they are simple fixes. 1. Much more Josh Holloway! He was coming from LOST and very popular...his role needed to be far greater.2. When you hit a prison guard with your hands who is wearing a full face guard he shouldn't fall to the ground like hand-to-hand combat! Come on...these details matter.3. When you go to the proverbial tape scene...'Will you accept this mission' have a guy with a deep resonating voice...distinct, unique, powerful, strong--not just any guy! These details matter JJ, you are projecting legacy here!4. The MI Theme needs to amazing! This was weak...much more effort! This needs to be over-the-top production with huge drums and bass...your audience should be singing the theme when they exit the theater...you are setting a template for the next generation JJ! Come on...again!I was living in the UAE when they filmed the tower scene...HUGE event...as in the greatest rock star visited your country...TC outside of the US in places like the UAE is like Michael Jackson...they LOVE stars there!The female lead was perfect...she is super hot but intelligent in looks...you believe she could be a school teacher, that her beauty is not her identity...she has a mind of her own. Jeremy Renner is gold...always. Not Hollywood Josh Holloway good looks, but like Tom Hardy, believable is everything he does.Tom Cruise: Do the nose experiment with him. Just stare at his nose and you will be stunned how huge it is. His features distract you because of his looks, but that nose grows by the second once you focus on it. He handled the comedy well...yet, with Mr C, his Scientology crazy will always be a stamp, a distraction to overlook. Leah Remini isn't doing him or his 'faith' any favors.Overall, a good installment. Take the franchise very seriously, but allow the movie to breath. Maybe the next time more intense drama, but this was a nice addition.",6,0,0,29 September 2017
Once Upon a Time... in Hollywood," Better Than the Lion King 2019!
","For those reading this review 20 years later (presumption IMBD is still around) let me record reality. The Lion King remake is in its second week and beat Once Upon A Time. The results are over 40 million for the weekend while the Lion King dropped 60% in one week. This is why weekend box office results are not reality. Once Upon A Time will still be seen 20 years from now and Disney's LK a mere burp that is gone! Tragically there was another shooting that is dominating the Sunday evening news tonight at the Gilroy, CA Garlic Festival. This is blocking out all coverage of Tarantino's movie and how well it did this weekend.",9,22,36,29 July 2019
Good Will Hunting," A Movie About Men: The Internal Fight Club
","Why another review? Well, for the few that might read this, I find this movie very accurate about the state of seeing a counselor. It is also very accurate about a man who carries deep toxic shame within keeping him from intimacy with others and living with massive defense mechanisms. Because of this, I understand why some do not like this movie, it taps a part of themselves they are still running from, and that is why this movie is so powerful.It is very hard to believe two 25yos wrote this script with such realistic relational depth. There are some very powerful emotional dynamics in this movie--the scene with Will & Skyler in her apartment when Will unpacks. The monumental scene with Will and Sean 'It's not your fault'--when a movie is a template for real life, this is an epic work of art! This movie allowed people to talk and relate when emotions were road blocks, to point to a scene in Good Will Hunting to establish a base for communication.Here's a point in real time. I was writing this review and a friend called. He ended up hanging up the phone on me because I questioned him about a project. He did a 'Will' in Skyler's room on me because I tapped a dark shadow in his life. His sensitivity to being questioned is such a part of his identity he is unconscious about, but something that causes him great conflict in his marriage which is now a divorce, his inability to stay employed, and history with addiction.This movie lays a template for men's issues!",10,3,4,23 October 2017
Snowden," Snowden WAS a white male...
","Some of these reviews are moronic. Very moronic. Snowden was a white male. Why would you cast anything else? If our culture is becoming so moronic, there is no critical thought left. Let's all just watch Adam Sandler movies and call this history lessons! This movie will play out better on DVD or at home because you can really look within. There was a lot of Mr Robot hangover (put tape over your laptop lens). We see the manifestation of what is becoming the best quote to summarize human nature; you can get someone to understand something when their career depends upon them not understanding.This sums up almost everything that is organized. People turn the other way to serve their selfish needs because most people are cowards. Simple as that.Joseph Gordon-Levitt is easily one of our most underrated actors. He was excellent in this portrayal. Yes, it was a slow burner, but he did not overact. That is much harder to do. Oliver Stone did his homework and did a fabulous job here.How many of us have the courage and integrity to count the cost of standing up against our peers? Most cannot even think of the logical consequences if the NSA had their free will. This movie is very relevant in this political age, almost to the point of ignoring the reality. We are the 'frog in water' and cannot react to corruption because it is common place. No attention span to react before the next blunder and it all melts into one depraved pot. But there will always be consequences. Always.If Snowden was righteous, he will be one of the great personalities of our generation. Usually, it takes a generation to recognize those who where a step ahead of the learning curve. Snowden just might be that man.",8,8,18,12 October 2016
The Disaster Artist," Authentic to My Experience
","Growing up in LA in the 80s, this movie really captured the essence of a young guy being sucked in the entertainment industry. Dave Franco was excellent if you can get past his young Tom Cruise look and energy. Anyone living in LA saw young people come and go. You meet someone who has dreams and connect and then their true motives are not revealed. You are both in and out of reality in one restaurant. Sitting next to you could be Tom Hanks, then a commercial actor the next table who did a Tide commercial, then a writer who did an episode of Bob's Burgers, then someone trying to get an agent, then a radiator mechanic. The aspiring actor is two feet from Tom Hanks but a million miles from him. Tom can play the role of an out of work actor while the out of work actor serves him a salad as a waiter. It is similar to a gardener working for a millionaire. They are on the same property but on different planets. Dave Franco really captured that enthusiasm of being naive great.",7,0,1,22 July 2019
Flight," Very Real Character Study of the Human Condition
","This is a movie folks and never tries not to be a movie. It must play like a movie otherwise it becomes a documentary or serves for some social or political cause. Yet within the lines are very realistic character studies of addiction and ego. Denzel portrays the bliss and blister of addiction or better yet the addict personality. Addicts take risks! They can be very smart in an unconventional way. Think about it, to get high is to lose control. It is to go way out from sober. Accept it or not, skills are developed. An addict can face being out of control (plane is crashing) and not lose control because they are familiar with loss of control. Maybe, often, they are drawn to careers that are high risk and walk a fine line. Sometimes they live straight as an arrow and when they are in the sky can feel that 'high' until they land. Pilots that can balance this are usually very good. Those who cannot cross boundaries like Whip Whitaker did. As for surprise performances, James Badge Dale did more with seven minutes of screen time than a lot of actors do in a career! It is one of the great performances in movie history! He had to lose 20 lbs for the role and worked at it for weeks before the one day shoot. He was instantly believable as a cancer patient. He should have won an award of some kind for this performance. It was a role that should have been forgotten, a filler role yet after the movie I thought about him. That is impact! John Goodman is on par with his performance as the savay drug dealer. It bordered over-the-top, but he got away with it and it was very entertaining. This movie needed some levity and I am sure Zemeckis allowed him to go for it to balance the ride out. This is a great movie to show with addicts and anyone wrestling with an addiction, pause for coffee break and open discussion in small group. It's just a matter of willingness to become vulnerable...the step that is the most difficult!",10,2,3,28 July 2019
Interview with the Vampire: The Vampire Chronicles," Lame Comes to Mind...
","This movie is horrid...what is the appeal of someone who drinks blood? Sexual arousal not for ample breasts, but the veins in the neck of a black servant girl. Really? Disgusting. Any human being that enjoys this is highly disturbed and cannot admit it. Brad Pitt is so bad as an actor and looks horrible. In Kalifornia, a movie or two earlier, he excelled, but in this flop, he sucks. No reason he should have been cast but the appeal to market as high popularity grew.Cruise (the was pre-Scientology nonsense and insanity came out) was too dedicated to this role. Gave him a way to shed the good-guy image and dive into darkness. Nobody can claim taking these roles does not impact one's life. Working on Eyes Wide Shut was occultish and a freak fest he loved. These are movies that reveal the sinful state of mankind, have no edifying factor, add nothing to the human experience, but say a lot about depravity.",1,2,12,16 November 2017
From Here to Eternity," Masterpiece...Burt is THE MAN!
","The casting department had to say, 'Look, we have loading this picture with some Hollywood hunks, maybe we went over the top?' Burt Lancaster and Montgomery Clift as run of the mill soldier boys? In scenes together you have more sexy man meat in one frame than in 3000 square miles from CA to NY!
There are so many up and comers in this movie, it's loaded with talent!Sinatra was playing Sinatra, and he was good. If you want better Frank, see his movie a few years later in Suddenly. It is bad Frank and more effective than hyper energy Frank in this movie.Burt Lancaster simply diminishes any other male actor in his scenes. There really has not been an actor with his magnetism, looks, power, and abilities. He was born to be a STAR. You know a good looking guy when he is in a scene with a beautiful woman and he is prettier. You can talk all you want about how believable this movie was, yeah, yeah...people do not go to the movies for a documentary, they go to be with people they never meet...and this movie is loaded with them!Sinatra was not in the same league and Montgomery, nor should he be, Clift dedicated his life to acting and here come Frank with his other qualities of power and charm, but not acting chops. Let's keep that clear, Sinatra is no Clift or Lancaster, nor a Borgnine, Warden or Harry Bellavar! I give a lot of credit to Frank for going after what he wanted, and he wanted this part bad! This is a classic movie that will never lose its influence. Best 1.6 million dollars spent in Hollywood! Think about that compared to the crap load of movies since...",10,2,2,1 March 2018
