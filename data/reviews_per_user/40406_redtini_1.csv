Blade Runner 2049," It's really mixed up!
","I was very distance to me ,the lack of warmth is so Notisable! ! I did like some of special effects . The musical score also did have any depth. I enjoy the apocalyptic and futuristic style movie to see how a director take it in what direction. Thanks my pleasure .",7,0,3,10 July 2018
