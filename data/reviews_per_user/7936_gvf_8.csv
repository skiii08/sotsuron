The Ring," didn't sleep too well for days after I watched it
","Thank God I now sleep tight again. This doesn't really happen to me much after scary movies, but boy did it happen with this one. As far as the scariness factor goes, this movie has it all. Creepy story about a dead girl's ghost seeking revenge, very disturbing special effects that make you want to crawl and hide under your blanket, split-second shock effects that will bring you close to cardiac arrest... and an overall mood that is very dark and eerie.Never mind the plot holes that some reviewers here have pointed out, this film has already become a modern classic for its unique attempt to leave the beaten path and try something not substantially new, but innovative enough.At least I'll never look the same again at white noise on a TV screen late at night.. who knows what's gonna come crawling out? ...you'll know what I mean once you've watched it. But be warned - the worst setting in which to enjoy this movie is home alone at night after a couple of beers. And I should know...",8,1,2,15 June 2006
Constantine," The Matrix meets End of Days... **yawn**
","I really expected more from this movie, what with all the hype it has been getting. Arguably one of Keanu Reeves's biggest mortal sins! It's kind of like a strange mix of key elements of The Matrix part one and the Schwarzenegger epic 'End of Days'. Also thrown in are some neat but not top-notch visuals (Adobe After Effects and the latest filter plug-ins still seem to go all the way) - and that's 'Constantine' for you.The storyline is paper thin and can be summed up in one or two sentences: Mammon, the son of Lucifer, wants to gain control of the earth and erect a kingdom of horror on the earth's surface. John Constantine, played by Reeves, tries to stop him, ultimately willing to sacrifice his own life. Where have we heard that one before? Everything else, the numerous sub-plots and unresolved threads of the story (like, whatever happened to the Mexican guy after he carried the Spear of Destiny all the way to L.A. and went for a swim in that pool? Was that even him right there? What really happened to that fat priest? Why exactly did he die on that supermarket floor?) are really beside the point and kind of look like they were just needed to blow up a story into a two-hour movie that could have been told in just under 45 minutes.Moreover, we all know that talent-wise, Keanu Reeves will never make a second Marlon Brando, but his acting (or lack thereof) in particular was a big disappointment here - just as unimaginative and unemotional as ever! Same with the other actors, maybe except for Peter Stormare with his brief, offbeat portrayal of the Devil himself towards the end of the movie.The ending scene however still tops it off - first we get a shot of Reeves and 'that girl' standing in front of a dark blue sky as if they are about to kiss (think of it as a poor adaption of your typical late 40's Hollywood ending - off color in more ways than one, at any rate). Then we get a real 'Matrix moment', where Reeves threatens to come back in a sequel, muttering the words 'I've got a lot of cleaning up to do!'Please, somebody talk some sense to the producers, and make it fast! The last thing we need is a sequel to this trashy pseudo-epic........4/10",4,0,6,1 July 2005
Ocean's Twelve," ...huh?!
","So here it is, another sequel to a well-done first part. First things first: Can it compete with Ocean's Eleven? No way, not at all.Danny Ocean and his partners in crime are at it again, they're planning another high-profile heist (two actually, as the movie evolves). This time they really need the money to pay back what they stole from Danny Ocean's arch-rival in the first movie. They have ten days, or they'll be dead. So much for the premise.While Ocean's Eleven was uniquely done as a sleek, glitzy, somewhat smart and really amusing tall-tale gangster story, Ocean's Twelve is really just your average gangster flick that doesn't even live up to its own promises. Plus, it is really confusing and I, for one, was lost. Too much stuff on the side, side plots that really have little to do with the storyline pop up throughout the movie. There are also many flashbacks and twists, so it skips back and forth and you really wonder what the heck is going on. Ocean's eleven was done in a similar way, but it all sort of worked well and only added to the film's ingenuity.Plus, during the first half hour of Ocean's 12, there's really nothing much happening. We meet the cast, they find out that the guy they stole the money from in the first movie wants it back... and that's basically it. The movie picks up speed after that just a little bit, but only to become really confusing.Of course it must have been difficult for the writers to come up with a similarly brilliant heist scene as the vault thing in Ocean's Eleven, but in the end, this time around they downright failed. The actual steal takes maybe thirty seconds, plus this time they do get caught on the spot. The biggest disappointment however is the stupid idea of distracting attention from the 'object of desire' during the steal by letting Julia Roberts' Tess character play a real-life Julia Roberts. What were the writers thinking? So, all in all, Ocean's Twelve is still a stylish movie in its own right, but for the most part, it is definitely more style than substance, plus, the makers of the sequel deeply misjudged the elements of the first movie that made it such a big box office hit. You don't impress audiences just by throwing glitzy, stylish characters at them as well as a nice scenery backdrop, side plots, flashbacks and whatnot. It takes a little more than that to blend those elements and turn them into a comprehensive work of art. Hopefully there won't be an Ocean's 13 as bad as this movie. (what's with that anyway? Who was the 12th guy in Ocean's Twelve?! Did I miss even more than I thought?) My vote: 5.5 out of 10",5,0,1,19 January 2005
Interstellar," In what universe is this a good movie??
","Honestly, I have no idea why other people, and everybody really, has been giving this movie such high ratings and rave reviews. To me, the entire film is poorly thought out, contrived drivel.It starts with the beginning of the story, where Cooper (Matthew McConaughey) more or less by accident tries to break and enter into government property by applying a bolt cutter to the gate of the secret government complex where the mission is being planned, and is subsequently enlisted as the mission head pilot, of all things. I don't care if we're told that he used to be an Air Force pilot and apparently a notable one at that with old acquaintances in high places; that was a big letdown in storytelling, erm, right out the gate for me. Just too lazy for a film of its (attempted) magnitude.With all the good reviews in mind, I thought I was at least going to be wowed by the rest of the film's plot and the imagery. Well, with the cheap availability (in film studio terms) of pretty much even the grandest CGI effects these days, there was nothing about the imagery that 'Elysium', 'Oblivion' and particularly 'Gravity' haven't already done in recent times, and better, and the whole plot not only disappointed with half-hearted but self-indulgently attempted forays into philosophy and some semi-spooky abnormal phenomena, but also by its ignorance of some quite basic natural laws. While the idea of time dilation within the gravitational field of a black hole was actually somewhat well explained, you just scratch you head at 500-foot monster waves on the water planet which suddenly rush across a vast expanse of otherwise knee-deep water that looks about as agitated as a reflecting pool (think Tsunamis back here on Earth). Also, there is no such thing as a more gentle black hole which won't spaghettify you as you approach it and therefore kill you dead. The list of errors goes on far beyond this.And finally, the last 20 minutes or so sucked worse than the black hole whose (imagined) innermost we get to see. It felt like a bad rehash on acid of the scene in the first 'Matrix' sequel where Neo meets the Architect. A culmination of all the things that make the plot of this movie so dreadfully banal.Again, like I said, I just can't understand why people would think that this is a good or even an outstanding movie. Yes, I know that this is a film which would like to get you to think more deeply about the issues it raises, and pick up on its whole philosophical angle. And I generally really like movies like that. But sorry, there are many films which have done a much better job at this, without falling flat on their face in the process.Long story short, after close to three hours, I felt about as robbed of my time as Cooper when he watched the video transmissions of his ageing kids from back on Earth.",2,8,16,10 May 2015
The Butterfly Effect," Michael Kelso shows us he's better than that!
","Every once in a while I pick up a movie from our neighborhood video store on my way home from work. So one night I really had no idea what I wanted to get and the girl at the store suggested 'The Butterfly Effect'. I looked at the cover and saw Ashton Kutcher's name on it. I said '...well I never heard of that one before - so is it a comedy?' - 'umm...no, uh.. not really, it's more like the Twilight Zone!' she replied.I took it home and wondered what the heck Ashton Kutcher was doing in a movie like that. I had spent countless hours laughing about his air-headed 'Kelso' character on the 70s show, but seeing him do well in a more serious role, in a mystery movie even, wasn't really something I would have had on my list of things to hope for. Simply put, he absolutely kicks butt! Given his resume as an actor so far, it looks like he is a lot more versatile than meets the eye! The movie itself gives you quite a few brain teasers to chew on. What if you found a way to switch back and forth between parallel universes? What if you had the chance to make whatever you did wrong in your past unhappen? However, what if things still wouldn't work out, and every time you threw yourself into another parallel universe, things would just become even more complicated and new problems would arise? This is pretty much the storyline of the movie. Ashton Kutcher plays a young college kid who has found a way to warp himself into many different parallel universes and even into the past; initially, in doing so he just tries to prevent the suicide death of his junior high crush. He then wakes up in an alternate universe and everything seems to be going great - he is a frat boy, and he is with her, now a sorority girl as opposed to being a greasy spoon waitress in the 'original' universe. But things take a turn for the worse, and he has to switch universes again and again - and so it goes on, like he says in that one scene: 'Everytime I try to help someone everything just goes to s**t'.This movie is really one of the greatest mystery movies I have seen in a long time, and since I'm a real mystery nut, it might tell you a little something. An interesting premise, wrapped into solid storytelling that still just every now and then keeps viewers guessing - and at the edge of their seats throughout, like any good mystery movie should. A painfully underrated gem of modern mainstream cinema, maybe because the audience and critics had the same doubts about Ashton Kutcher as I did.Just a few days ago I bought the DVD, and I strongly recommend you do the same. The 2-DVD version features the Director's Cut on the second disc. Do yourself a favor and go for the Director's Cut. Aside from being 25 minutes shorter, the theatrical version has an ending that probably earned the producers a few more dollars at the box office, but then again it's too much like your average 'hollywood ending' and therefore the movie's only true disappointment.Guess what I'm going to do tonight, now that I've finished writing this comment - I've already put the Director's Cut disc in my DVD player :-)",9,1,3,26 June 2005
The Transporter," Dumbish, no soul
","I watched this movie last night at a friend's birthday get-together, and I had never heard of it before (and hopefully I will forget about it again soon).**INTERMITTENT SPOILERS AHEAD**The whole movie is dripping with overused action clichés. So there we have the main character, the 'Transporter', basically just a slick, high-profile delivery boy in suit and tie who drives a black 7-series BMW. Whatever shady business you're in, he'll handle the driving part, from bank robberies to smuggling people. He also is a retired Marine with quite a past (dind't we see that one too many times? Even Steven Segal is probably tired of playing a character like this by now). He has a strict set of rules while he is doing business, such as 'no names', 'no questions', 'no plan alterations', blah blah blah....One day he breaks one of his own rules as he opens a big traveling bag he is supposed to deliver - and in it he finds a gagged and handcuffed young beautiful Asian woman. From then on, mayhem arises, people try to kill him, blow up his house with guided missiles and.... oh yeah, the Asian girl falls in love with him and they make out. He soon gets to the bottom of things as he finds out that the girl's father is smuggling illegal Chinese immigrants into the country by the hundreds.So much for the story, nothing new here, it's all been done before. With Luc Besson as the executive producer of this movie, your expectations are naturally high, especially after masterpieces such as 'The Fifth Element' or the highly acclaimed 'Leon'. But this time around, Besson is not being his usual ingenious self. Sure, he delivers in putting together a (somewhat sleek) action-rigged spectacular - you'll see explosions, cool weapons, shootouts, martial arts scenes, car chases, flying cars, a dramatic highway chase involving an 18-wheeler and a small airplane etc. But somehow, with this movie, the whole appears to be less than the sum of its parts. Despite their sleekness, many of these parts do look a bit like recycled scenes from your average, cheesy Hollywood action flick, and premise and storyline are ultra-thin.To get to the point: the movie has lots of (mostly visual) bells and whistles, but it has no soul. If you pick this one up from the video rental, be sure to also get a six pack on the way home.5.5 out of 10",Null,0,0,5 January 2005
High Fidelity," One of my all-tine favorites (may contain spoilers)
","This movie sums up a lot about failed relationships... especially about what it's like actually being the one who fails (i.e. gets dumped repeatedly).John Cusack plays Rob Gordon, an introspective college dropout in his early-to-mid 30s who just barely gets by, running his own record store called 'Championship Vinyl'. One day his girlfriend leaves him, throwing his whole world in chaos. So he sits back, digs up old, painful memories and starts to wonder why he is 'doomed to be left' - why he is always the one that gets dumped. He decides to get in touch with his 'top five' ex-girlfriends ('those were the ones that really hurt') to find answers and of course he also tries to get his now-ex girlfriend to go back out with him. Unfortunately, she is already 'otherwise involved'. So much for most of the story - I won't give away the ending here though, that's for you to find out ;-)To base a movie on a Nick Hornby novel, like this one, is surely a good place to start, depending of course on how well the novel is adapted to the big screen. In this case, it works quite well, although not-so-minor changes have been made. For one thing, the setting is downtown Chicago, and not London, as it was in the original novel. The casting is well done. First of all, anyone who appreciates Jack Black's abundant acting talent will LOVE the way he plays his freaked-out, neurotic 'Eric' character. John Cusack also does a good job in his lead role, especially in sad moments where you can really feel the pain in his character while he has that sinister, regretful look on his face.The film really is entertaining and offers a couple of great laughs alongside a somewhat deep and serious storyline. Maybe it lacks some pace every now and then, but instead you are rewarded with a few thought-provoking dialogs on the nature of relationships and why people fail at them. It makes this movie even more worthwhile. In fact, the first time I watched it, it did much to comfort me during a time when MY girlfriend had just left me... **spoiler ahead!!!** in my case, however, I wasn't lucky enough to get a happy ending like John Cusack does at the end of the movie... bummer :-/All in all: Absolutely recommended... not just for someone who likes to be deep in thoughts about relationships ;-)8/10",Null,2,5,30 August 2004
The Island," A movie about cloning that is a clone itself... sort of...
","Some of the reviewers have come up with the crazy notion that this movie has elements of and references to other movies in it... and boy does it have them! Let's start with a few basics - the main protagonist realizing that his world is just an illusion and that humans in his world are actually grown, not born (including a shot of humans in 'embryo pods') - The Matrix I Him and some pretty girl escaping from their confined underground world and glaring into the bright sunlight of the real world - Logan's Run Escapees in bright white overalls running through the desert, chased by (black!!) helicopters - Capricorn OneFuturistic-looking motorized vehicles that are actually fully badged current production models, only with PVC-augmented fenders (and one concept car that, even if briefly this time around, steals the show) - I, Robot One heck of an urban highway chase with demolition scenes agogo: The Matrix II The idea of the 'real' human and his clone meeting face to face - The 6th Day And let's not forget THE clone of all clones of scenes in this movie - towards the end, when Lincoln is about to be captured, he is lying on the floor, gradually pushes himself back up, and says 'My name is Lincoln!!' ... Keanu Reeves, eat your heart out! There are probably more 'references' or, simply put, knock-offs, but these are the most obvious. Now don't get me wrong, this is still a nice movie as far as action flicks and summer blockbusters go - lots of action, shooting, explosions and mayhem, but if you've watched the movies mentioned above, you can't help feeling a bit strange when you see the corresponding scenes in this one.Also notable: the barrage of product placements. Sure, a movie like this costs a lot of money to make, but those various well-known brand logos could have been presented a bit more subtly.I'll give it the 6 points it deserves, and please do rent/buy this movie if these elements I just mentioned are your type of thing - because for what it's worth, it delivers well in these departments... but that's where it ends.6/10",6,0,0,25 March 2006
