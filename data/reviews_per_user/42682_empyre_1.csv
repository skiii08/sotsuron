Requiem for a Dream," One of the most powerful films ever made
","Darren Aronofsky proves that 'Pi' was no fluke with this amazing sophomore effort. Requiem is not only the best 'drug movie' I have ever seen but one of the most emotionally involving films I've ever seen. Aronofsky makes you fall in love with his characters only to completely destroy them. This movie will shake you to your core and should be required viewing for every teenager who's ever thought about using drugs. With amazing visuals, a terrific score and brilliant acting (especially by Ellen Burstyn), Requiem for a Dream is at once disturbing and brilliant. Powerful cinema.",10,0,0,12 December 2000
