3:10 to Yuma," Worse than bad
","This is a stinker of the Nth order. Nothing in this movie rings true. From the moment when the McElroy character played by Peter Fonda is shot POINT BLANK in the stomach, and not only doesn't die, but lives on to lead the posse after cold-turkey surgery THE SAME DAY, this movie lost me. From then on, all I see are its flaws.They are countless.The story is muddled and confused. There is dialog that uses contemporary vernacular. The end is SO COMPLETELY unbelievable that it isn't even worth spoiling for you all.Smells like the old West, though. Like fresh road apples or cow pie.In short, this was a remake that should never have seen the light of day. James Mangold, director, clearly let everything get away from him, as he did in Walk The Line, a movie that ended up being a really bad film vehicle for Ocsar nominees, but started out being a really good biography of Johnny Cash that NEVER DELIVERED.Miss this train! The 3:10 to Yuma is garbage.",1,78,131,17 February 2008
Citizen Kane," The Best Drama Ever Filmed
","This is a great movie, the best drama ever made. Everything about it is perfect. And the test of it is that no one at the time of its release knew what to do with it, or what to make of the genius of Orson Welles. These two facts themselves engender a tragedy that should, but probably will never be, a film like Citizen Kane. Yes, it was nominated for all the right things. And son of a gun, the Academy ACTUALLY gave CK an Oscar for Best Original Screenplay.BEST ACTOR 1941 Sgt. York? I love Gary Cooper, but... BEST PICTURE, BEST DIRECTOR 1941 How Green Was My Valley, Best Picture, Best Director? A great film, and by my list of films, John Ford is a great director, but... BEST FILM EDITING 1941 Sgt. York again? Now, come on! Guys, didn't you see that newsreel mock-up stuff, splicing CFK next to Hitler etc? Sgt. York? MUSIC 1941 All That Money Can Buy...well, at least Bernard Hermann, music man for CK, won.The Academy is not an Oracle of Film Greatness, and sometimes they even get it right. But in 1941 they looked past the brilliant Jewel that is Citizen Kane and picked up, instead, a handful of shiny pebbles.",10,9,15,23 May 2005
L.A. Confidential," The trappings, but not the substance of greatness
","This film gets a six from me, largely because of the very strong acting by everyone.The story...is a cardboard sham of story, a 'Chinatown' wannabe, that has unsatisfactory twists and turns, painfully slow beginnings, and ridiculously stereotyped tinging. The heavy hand of 'period feel' is everywhere, a reek of over-exertion to make it 'sound' right, 'look' right. But, it 'isn't' right.A personal yutz of mine is Dudley Smith's referral in a press conference to 'DMV'. Small point perhaps, but I doubt you can return to that period and find one reference in any publication to DMV as an acronym for Division of Motor Vehicles. In a desire to 'make it feel real', I think, they all forgot to 'keep it real.'Screenwriter Helgeland credits include Conspiracy Theory, Bloodwork, this film, A Knight's Tale, Payback, The Postman, Mystic River, and Man on Fire. Mostly good, but you can't win them all. But his purposed use of the 'F' bomb over and over again, is, for me, out of bounds, for there is no added dramatic affect from it, and, while certainly used back in that period, wasn't used like we hear it used. Also, the constant referral to 'whores cut to look like film stars', followed by the somewhat humorous Lana Turner gag was, for me, a huge nothing. So what? The angle that was interesting is the BLACKMAIL (which connects immediately to the DeVito character), the GANGLAND rubouts, and, of course, the MISSING HEROIN. The plastic surgery angle is a total zero. Bud White's oh, so predictable relationship with the Madam, and the Exley character's pursuit of her was unsupportable and doesn't come off. But, it has to be there, or else the Beefeater Bud White won't see red enough to accept the truth about Exley-Vincennes' findings.Chinatown is one of the best examples of a period film that seems to have got it right. Perhaps because writer Robert Towne's father-in-law was actor John Payne, who acted in Noir Films under the direction of Phil Karlson (Kansas City Confidential, for one). And, then, too, there was world-class director Roman Polanski to steer the course, who was, at that time, on top of his game and not yet a convicted sex-offender.Direction in L.A. Confidential is not obvious, and it could have used some. This film wants strong direction, needed to cut out the fat in this screenplay, which I think was about 20 minutes of unnecessary scenes that add nothing to the plot or suspense of the finale.Six. Not one for the ages, but, again, memorable performances throughout.",6,4,12,11 August 2005
Closer," Effluent waste (of time and money)
","After writhing through Jude Law's absolutely awful Alfie several weeks ago, my wife and I thought we'd give Jude Law another chance...what a mistake.If only 'Closer' were JUST salacious and tawdry...the 'Closer' I get to it, the more it stinks. There is nothing in this film! Nothing! All right, the shots of London. Yes, Portman has a nice smile...Roberts' great misty looks...and Law is sooooo handsome (gag). But that, really, is it.One has to wonder why Nichols chose this...ah...flotsam of a film. After a glorious rich early career that features films like 'Silkwood', 'The Graduate' and 'Carnal Knowledge', Nichols seems to have lost his olfactory sense.Can't you hear the come on, though? 'Here's what we do, Mikey: Put a couple of headliners in London, lots of classical music, scenery, (one time) world-class director, sprinkle it with dirty language and sex...You have the newbie starlet Natalie Portman--(who has the acting depth of a kiddie pool)--you got a (fading) star Julia Roberts (with her Bambi-esquire doe-eyes masquerading as grand pathos). You got Jude Law...You got a smash hit! Almost an Art Film! Like Ocean's 11 the Remake! Happening! Cool! Yeah, Baby!' Jude Law. O Handsome Leading Actor and so full of himself on screen, Jude, you make Richard Burton seem like a shrinking violet.Jude hasn't done a creditable job in anything since Artificial Intelligence. Perhaps his choice of films is the culprit. I haven't seen Sky Captain (cringe I), and I got through all of 10 minutes of Cold MoleHill, but I'm thinking I don't have the stomach to watch this guy's work.I'm really, really beginning to wonder if Jude Law himself knows what a good film project is. I know, I know, they are trying to make money, and they go where the money is. But I don't see these absolutely wooden performances (there's a pun in there) as landing anywhere in the top 250 films of all time list that I keep.Jude, really, check out the filmography of British Film Giants like Cary Grant, Michael Caine, Peter Sellers, David Niven, Rex Harrison, Alec Guiness to name but a few. It wasn't all great, Jude, but you are on a clinker streak that those actors never saw.And brother and sister viewers, how how how could you give this...film sewage...anything as high as an 8? 6? 4? I give it a one, because this grading system won't take fractions.",1,3,6,29 May 2005
Pulp Fiction," A bandwagon-hype-faux-happening
","Sorry you QT worshippers. This film first of all was no Reservoir Dogs, and second of all, doesn't have the edge or guts of 'Fight Club' or 'American History X', for example.This is a 'tour-de-FORCED', 'I'm-so-full-of-my-self', pant-load of a movie. Calculated hit for the 'I'm-so-full-of-my-self' yuppie-money-punk crowd, who think they are 'HIP' and 'COOL' because they connect with 'The Street'.Analogy:'Pulp Fiction' is to 'Reservoir Dogs' as 'Oceans 11' is to The GetawayThis film is a Tarantino Ego Trip that merits no higher, in my humble though strong opinion, no higher than a '5'.",1,29,67,6 June 2005
War of the Worlds," drivel
","This movie is why I rarely go to the theater anymore. This is an insult to my intelligence.Steven Spielberg, how dare you present such a saccharine-coated load of guano? How could you do this? There is nothing here but Tom's excellent adventure. Nothing, nothing nothing! The only thing I question is, are you really that tasteless, or do you just believe your own BS to this extent? Where is the story here? What is up with that ending? Why did you need that Morgan Freeman voice-over at the end? This is awful cinema. I recently excoriated Armaggedon, and now, compared to this, that looked like a John Ford film! I mean, Steve Buscehmi singing 'On a Jet Plane' was a better film moment than most of this terrible terrible movie.The fact that so many people rated this highly frightens me.",1,1,2,22 January 2006
