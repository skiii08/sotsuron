Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," Quite good, despite what some people say.
","This film was actually really good, and I can't believe some of the reviews it got. While it's not my favorite Star Wars film(Return of the Jedi holds that title), it's still pretty high up there. First, let me just say that I don't get why so many people hated JarJar Binks. He didn't annoy me at all, and I found him to be a funny, worthwhile character who played an important role in helping to defeat the evil Trade Federation. I only had two big problems with this film: 1.Darth Maul was a wasted character, which is a real pity. He could have been an awesome villain if he had appeared in more scenes and been given more lines, instead of only being in a few scenes and having three or four lines. 2. Obi-Wan did not have as big of a part as he could have had, and he should have at least accompanied Qui-Gon to Tatooine. I just felt that Ewan Mcgregor's fine acting skills were wasted.Other than that, though, I liked this movie. The film's best performances came from Liam Neeson and Jake LLoyd. Ian McDiarmid also did quite well as the suave, sinister Senator Palpatine. John Williams did an excellent job composing the film's music. I particularly enjoyed Duel of the Fates(the intense, fast- paced composition played during the climactic lightsaber battle between Darth Maul and the two Jedi) and also the festive, light-hearted music played during the final victory parade.Basically, I just really liked Episode I, and I look forward to seeing Episode II next Spring!",8,21,30,29 June 2001
The Fifth Element," One of my favorite movies!!
","I have loved this film ever since I first saw it in theaters about four years ago. It is exciting and funny, with several great performances. I particularly liked Bruce Willis and Milla Jovovich. Chris Tucker's character was unbelievably funny, and for those people who were annoyed by how loud and whiny he was, well, that's why so many people thought he was funny. He was such an obvious parody of Prince(wussy, worshiped by ladies) that viewers couldn't help cracking up. The special effects were great, and I can't believe it didn't get an Oscar for the visual effects. I loved the exciting flying-car chase. However, my favorite part of the film would have to be the awesome fight scene between Leeloo and the ugly Mangalore aliens. This was filmed perfectly, and is one of the best movie fight scenes ever!Still, the rest of the movie is also really good, and I highly recommend it to anyone who enjoys action or sci-fi.",10,0,1,26 May 2001
Sleepy Hollow," excellent!!
","I consider this to be Tim Burton's best movie ever, except for maybe 'Batman'. It only had a couple of small flaws, which I will list now, so as to save the good stuff for last: 1. Many of the fine supporting actors should have been given more screen time, particularly Casper Van Dien and Richard Griffiths. Both of their characters should have been given bigger parts. 2. There is one part of the movie that I didn't get:In the scene when the Horseman goes after that family (a scene that offended many reviewers), why did Tim Burton feel the need to have him go after their young son as well? You find out later why he went after the parents, but he had no reason to try and kill that poor child. However, these two small problems are more than outweighed by the many strong points of this film, which I will now list: 1. Danny Elfman's score. I don't get why any reviewers could be put off by his excellent music. I love how he combined the various types of music which he used in Mr. Burton's other films. By this, I mean that he used scary, thrilling tunes like in 'Batman', 'Batman Returns', and 'Beetlejuice' during certain scenes (such as Ichabod's terrifying encounter with the Crone in the Western Woods, and during the final chase scene), yet in other scenes (like the flashback sequences and the film's final end scene) he made haunting, beautiful melodies like the kind you heard in 'Edward Scissorhands'. 2. The costumes/ makeup/set design. The costumes were beautifully accurate, and they should have won the Oscar for Costume Design instead of 'Topsy-Turvy'. The makeup was great, particularly for the scenes when you see the Horseman's real face. You almost couldn't tell that it was Christopher Walken, because the makeup made him look so scary. Tim Burton has created his own little world with the sets. He actually had the village completely constructed, and the Western Woods looked even better, with the dried leaves and the gnarled dead trees everywhere. I'm glad that this movie won at least one Oscar due to the set design. 3. Johnny Depp's performance. I LOVED what he did with Ichabod Crane, and he performed with complete perfection. During the scene when he questions the Notary, he reminded me of Sherlock Holmes. He should have won more awards for his performance. So, basically, if you have a strong stomach, I highly recommend that you see this great movie.",8,0,0,14 April 2001
The Mummy Returns," Pretty good
","I just saw 'The Mummy Returns' a few hours ago, and was pleasantly surprised with it. I actually consider it to be a little bit better than its predecessor. The graphics and creature effects were really good, with the exception of those used during the fight scene between Rick O'Connell and the Scorpion King. I particularly liked the funny pygmy monsters and the scary Anubis warriors. Freddie Boath was really good as the O'Connells' son Alex, and made me laugh in several scenes. Another character that I liked was Ardeth Bay, the mysterious nomad leader first seen in the original film (They should make a spinoff movie about him instead of one about the Scorpion King). I kind of liked the humorous hidden references that were made to the first film(Such as the scene in the first one when Jonathan has difficulty deciphering a certain hyroglyphic during a crucial moment). It was also pretty cool to finally see Evelyn really fighting in a few scenes.This movie was more exciting than the first one, and for the most part, more fun in general.",7,0,0,5 May 2001
Hercules," Not Disney's best, but still a wonderful film.
","Although it's not as good as 'The Lion King' or 'Beauty and the Beast,' I'd say 'Hercules' is still an excellent film, probably the last great Disney film that didn't involve Pixar. I'm just sorry I didn't see it while it was in theaters. There's so much to love about this movie, I don't know where to begin. OK, first, the story. The writers did a great job with Hercules. Most of the past movies about Hercules made him a macho, invincible brute, but Disney's 'Hercules' actually injects some soul into the character, and makes him a very deep, rather insecure, unlikely hero. The story of his quest to become a true hero is really moving and well- done. Next, I'll certainly need to discuss the equally great supporting characters. Danny DeVito is funny and likable as the grumpy Phil. Megara, played excellently by Susan Egan, is a very good female lead. She could have easily been just a flaky love interest for Hercules, but instead, they made her a strong, independent character. However, the character who really steals the show has to be Hades. He is one of the best Disney villains I've ever seen. He is unmistakeably evil, yet rather calm about it (Other than the few occasions when he loses his temper), and also very funny. The character design for him was quite well- done (Though my mom said he reminded her too much of Ursula from 'The Little Mermaid'), and James Woods is incredible at doing his voice, going from calm to menacing to completely enraged effortlessly. Next, I must talk about the songs. I loved all of the songs in it. The Muses add a sweet, Gospel feel to their songs, and my favorite song, 'Go the Distance,' is really beautiful. It should have won an Oscar. My favorite scene in the film would probably be when Hercules fights the Hydra. The computer animation for the Hydra works very well, it looks great. The fight itself is really exciting, too. Please, go see 'Hercules.' You won't be sorry that you did.",8,0,1,4 November 2005
Shrek," A great film in all aspects.
","This was truly a wonderful film, and it definitely belongs on the list of the top ten best movies of 2001! The animation was great, especially for the human characters, and it was also very funny for kids and adults. I loved the scene with the Gingerbread Man ('Eat me!'). The voice acting was superb. Mike Myers uses his famed Scottish accent to bring Shrek to life in a charming, amusing way. I also liked the suave, conceited tone John Lithgow gave to the evil Lord Farquaad. Cameron Diaz and Eddie Murphy also do very well as Princess Fiona and Donkey, respectively. The only SMALL problem I have with the voice acting is that I'm still not sure why Robin Hood had a French accent in the film. The actual scene with him is hilarious, but I just don't get why he didn't have an English accent.VERY SLIGHT SPOILER AHEAD! I thoroughly enjoyed every scene of 'Shrek'.Throughout the climax sequence in the church, I continuously had a smile on my face: first, a large grin as Lord Farquaad got his comeuppance, then a warm smile as Shrek sweetly tells Fiona how he really feels about her. Also, when I first saw 'Shrek' at the movie theater, during the end scene when Donkey sings 'I'm a Believer', a bunch of audience members were happily singing along, myself included.This film deserves to be nominated for several Academy Awards (At least for Best Music Score and Best Art Direction). Also, although the MTV Movie Awards don't usually nominate a lot of animated films,I could see 'Shrek' getting a bunch, such as Best Movie, Best Villain, Best Onscreen Team, and Best Fight(for either of the two fantastic fight scenes in it).So, whether you're nine, nineteen, or ninety, it would be hard not to love 'Shrek'.",8,0,0,21 January 2002
"O Brother, Where Art Thou?"," Forget Owen Gleiberman's review, this movie's great!
","First, for those of you who don't know who Owen Gleiberman is, he's one of Entertainment Weekly's movie critics. From what I remember reading in his review when 'O Brother Where Art Thou?' came out, he said it was just stupid stereotypes and gave it an F. Now that I've actually seen this movie (I got it for my birthday a few months ago), I realize how stupid I was to trust the opinions of a man who also had the nerve to give 'X- Men' a C.
'O Brother, Where Art Thou?' is an excellent film in all senses. I'm normally not a George Clooney fan (Until then, the only movie with him I liked was 'From Dusk Till Dawn'), but his performance in this film was perfect, and he truly deserved that Golden Globe he won for it. I also really liked the actor who played Delmar. His realistically amusing facial expressions and hilarious lines ('We thought...you was...a toad!')kept me happy all throughout the film. The frightening Sheriff  made an effective villain, and the equally intense scene with the KKK rally was really exciting to behold. The references to the Odyssey were charming and well- done, although I still don't get who George Nelson was supposed to resemble in the ancient Greek story. However, the Siren scene and its aftermath were quite funny, and John Goodman is creditable as the one- eyed Big Dan Teague. Easily one of the best scenes in the movie is when the Soggy Bottom Boys sing 'Man of Constant Sorrow'. That song quickly brought a smile to my face, and should have won that MTV Movie Award for Best Musical Performance. So, you can forget about what the 'professional' critics at Entertainment Weekly said about it, and just enjoy this hysterical, light- hearted and worthwhile film.",Null,5,6,4 May 2002
