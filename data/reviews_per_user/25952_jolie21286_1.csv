Marie Antoinette," Marie Anoinette-- beautiful, touching, and fun film
","I went into this film with a chip on my shoulder, expecting the worse of one of my favorite directors, Sofia Coppola. I saw the soundtrack and was immediately frustrated b/c i knew how good this film could be and i felt that the music would ruin it. But then I saw it. Marie Antoinette was beyond and above one of the most beautiful films i have ever seen, coming just behind GWTW. The music made the film so much fun and yet it was still very touching, uncomfortable and vulnerable. Dunst is absolutely perfect for this role and Schwartzman was surprisingly fantastic as Louis. As a history major, the film was not as historically accurate as i would have hoped for BUT the portrayal of the characters was perfect; Dunst was naive and heart-breakingly vulnerable, and Schwartzman was adorably uncomfortable and yet painfully pathetic. As far as the other characters go, Rip Torn and Asia A. were fantastic as Louis and Madame Du Barry and Molly Shannon could have been left out and replaced easily. I honestly think this movie could have not been any more perfect. I highly, highly recommend this movie, it's probably not a movie for everyone, but if you are a Coppola fan, see this movie.",9,3,6,23 October 2006
