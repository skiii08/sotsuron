Black Swan," Astonishing
","There is actually nothing that could be told using words. As a nerd I am; with all my obsessions about my own profession and my eager were shot in the heart while I was watching the film. I held my breathe, my shoulders up all the time. Quiet thrilling and impressive. I felt the obsession for perfection in my bone marrows. I think the soul of art impresses the audience more when it the vision is from a specific view, such as in 'movies' of course special effects and frame-cuts have strong effect too. As I love other films about branches of fine arts, Black Swan is at top of them so far. Such good choices of actors and actresses, combined by the story of Swan Lake Ballet it becomes almost alive.",10,0,3,12 January 2017
The Boy in the Striped Pajamas," Good movie
","A classic subject and an elaborated time period. All people have something they have heard/ watched about 2nd World War and the applications of the Nazi Germany. This time it was illuminated for both aspects, neither for the German soldiers nor the Jewish people back then only. Cast choice is definitely perfect and indeed reflects the national appearance of the people. The only part I didn't enjoy was that how people didn't speak German in the movie. It's really OK for a quality audience to watch a subtitled movie, I guess and thus national differences and the realistic atmosphere is conserved. Especially German people shouldn't have a British accent, NO. It really spoils the realistic atmosphere. Other than that the tragedy of the movie, the annihilation of childhoods and a dictator's pressure on people was shown very adequately.",8,0,0,11 March 2017
Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind," A fictional crisis that would make you think again about your loved ones.
",I know it was fictional but still couldn't help myself hold my tears. I actually experienced falling in love with someone and losing it memory by memory from my past. It is like the saddest imaginable thing I can think about. The cast fits just fine I think. I think it would be a good start for people who definitely hate 'Romantic films'. Film starts a bit like a thriller at first but then things start to happen. If you realize little details like Clementine's hair colors during some specific emotions transmitted through specific scenes. Reminded me of Mr. Nobody.,10,0,0,27 May 2017
Cloud Atlas," A spectacular aspect is given
","I clearly know that there are a lot of messages we can extract from this epic movie but the greatest of them all is an aspect of seeing the time and world as a whole with people's lives. As humans we can approach life from only 1 aspect. We suppose that the only results of our acts are bound to us and we are the only winners or sufferers of our acts, we are the only one who know them or gets effected by them. Reality is that time drags every single act and person with it. Bad, good or idealist no matter who or what kind of person we are, our kind will never ever extinct but only Will increase or decrease as numbers. But every individual is fighting for their survival, ideas, thoughts. For ideals (Hae Joo-Chang and son-mi) for the loved ones (Zachry) for work ethics Luisa Rey) for humanity (Moronym). No matter what we are fighting for, it is not for first time and it is not for last time. What we do and how we form our lives are in relation with people, people from past and future and their lives. As Sonmi says, 'Our lives are not our own, we are bounded to others, past and present. and by each crime and every kindness rebirth our future.' Even tough this is a reality there are very few people who are aware of it. Just like scientists and artists who bring this world new things and creations, they are never forgotten and they will always evolve from starts of their existences. The ones who are aware of this, know that not only one of them can achieve their ideals or the kindness they dream of, but with next generations and other people who act like them. As Adam Ewing says 'what is an ocean but a multitude of drops?'",10,1,2,20 July 2017
Annihilation," Time loss + some good special effects
","No logic, no science, no character development, no nothing. Doesn't even worth spending time to see it, most of the reviews before, explains why. I am writing this only to help people not to loose time&money.",1,5,9,31 December 2018
