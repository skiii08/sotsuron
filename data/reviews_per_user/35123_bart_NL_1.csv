Kill Bill: Vol. 2," Did not live up to my expectations
","After seeing Kill Bill 1, I was thrilled to see the sequel. When I finally saw it, I have to say I was a bit disappointed by it.I'll give a few reasons: In part I the person 'Bill' is a complete mystery, which makes the movie attractive till the end. In part 2 this mystery is directly unfolded in the opening scene; to my opinion this could have been done with a lot more tension and excitement to keep the viewer tight to the screen. The second thing is the plot which is to my opinion too predictable and has only a few weird twists and turns. Last point I have is the length of the movie. It takes 136 minutes to finish, while with this storyline it could be done in about an hour.I like Tarantino-movies, but this one certainly lacks quality.",4,2,6,10 November 2004
