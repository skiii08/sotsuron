Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," Could have been better with all that money
",Honestly I am more impressed by The Matrix as for the original visual fx.(bullet shadows etc.) Except the Race scene and underwater city it gave nothing to me. Too much animated character and enough Jar Jar talk!!!Almost like a cartoon. Also -sci-fi classic- one minute cuts bores already.,6,0,1,11 June 1999
The Usual Suspects," Best movie
","This is the best movie  I've ever seen along with the 'Shawshank Redemption'. I don't know how many times I've seen it and forced people to see it. I stopped counting after 50! Don't bother with the bad comments.See it,buy it.!!",10,0,1,11 June 1999
