Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," Great, yet disappointing at the same time
","After seeing Ep. I for the second time, I have formed the opinion that it is, in fact, an entertaining movie.  A classic?  Hardly.  But put it up against almost any recent Hollywood movie and it can compete.  The problem is only that it can't compete against Star Wars.  But don't forget one thing.  Star Wars (Ep. IV) was produced without necessarily knowing whether sequels would follow.  As such, it is a complete story unto itself. Ep. I is simply a set-up.  Its true value will not be known until after all three have been released.  My only real substantive complaint is that the writing was fairly lame.  Hopefully Lucas will put quality over secrecy and allow some more people to see and edit the script.",Null,0,1,25 May 1999
Memento," Get people to see this movie - IT WAS GREAT
","There is no reason why this film shouldn;t have a wider release - get people to see it and get it some publicity. I was reminded of Paul's (Will Smith) momologue in Six Degrees of Separation about imagination - that it does not need to be confined to the realm of science fiction - well HERE is a film with REAL inagination - one that uses its premise to tell a unique story and to put us into the mindset of the protagonist.Lots of people will debate some of the finer points of the story and the ending/beginning leaves a lot of questions (although, in the context of the story, could you expect any REAL certainty in the resolution?) - but the point was that it WORKED - here was a film that could easily have turned into an exercise a la TIME CODE, but instead, made the structure a key component of the storytelling.  Performances were great - Guy Pearce was the right man for this role - abloe to convince you that he understands even though he has no clue what you are talking about.THIS IS THE KIND OF MOVIE WE WANT TO HAVE MADE - it stretches the boundaries of cinema and shows us how to make entertaining and valuable cinema through creativity and innovation, rather than through millions in special effects.",Null,0,0,10 April 2001
