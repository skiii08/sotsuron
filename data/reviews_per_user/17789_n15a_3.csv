Lucky Number Slevin," Makes for unpleasant viewing
","Trying to get into a film with a partner or family is difficult to do when 20mins into the film there is a highly graphic sex scene which makes everyone uncomfortable. I mean we may as well of been watching porn. Unnecessary for anything like that to be in the film.It completely ruined the experience for myself and the others around me at the time.No self-respecting person would want to view this. Maybe if you're on your own, or maybe if you're immature men watching it with your friends.Completely Unnecessary for the indecent exposure of a womans' breast on the screen as well, what were they trying to achieve with this? Sexual arousal for the men and lesbians watching and making the film? Pathetic! This is what porn is for.I wouldn't suggest watching this with family or your partner.Also, the film wasn't even that great. This is my opinion.",1,1,12,29 January 2013
A Star Is Born," Stunning!
","Both Lady Gaga & Bradley Cooper were able to show of their creative talents in this with the stunning songs in the soundtrack, Bradley's directional skills & Gaga's acting! I would definitely consider this to be one of those movies which you HAVE to watch. This movie will definitely remain timeless and will move you to tears :)",10,4,6,18 November 2018
Ted," If you like Family Guy, then this film isn't for you
","Seth MacFarlane normally has a quick witted and clever sense of humour and any episode of Family Guy has a point to it.I think he sold out to make extra cash.The acting was poor.Using the same actors that play the voices of the characters in Family Guy may of seemed like a great idea but it didn't work.Film was generally boring and had no point, or no real story line worth anything.This movie belittles women and makes them out to be as objects for men.The main actress is made out to be some sort of prize for the men to win.Completely stereotypical and trashy.Very immature, it was a disappointment.",1,4,8,5 February 2013
