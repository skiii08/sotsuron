The Avengers," Absolutely Incredible
","The Avengers is one of the best films I have ever seen. It is action packed, thrilling and full of amazing special effects! The characters are developed throughout the movie as they learn to work as a team. The story line is excellent and the movie has you on the edge of your see throughout. I saw this is in 3D and 2D and I have to say; it is incredible in 2D, but unimaginable in 3D. I also liked the development of some of the less well known characters and links made to other Marvel Movies. There is also a great deal of humour to add another depth to this immense movie. All I can say is, very well done Joss Whedon! A very,very good movie, I cannot wait for Avengers 2 in 2015!",10,2,5,6 August 2013
