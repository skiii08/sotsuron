The Blair Witch Project," Found Footage Beginning
","It's likely that found footage films came before this movie.However, I felt like this movie really paved the way for future FF films, and now we have hundreds out.As for the movie I liked it.I remember seeing this one at the theater, and I was young enough to buy into the hype that it might be real.So I was glued to it and I was scared.A lot of people hate this genre and type of film. They will say nothing ever happens and it's just 'annoying cameras jumping.' I suppose that's true. I think what makes this movie a success if my eyes is they built up the suspenseful moments without revealing anything.That's the secret to successful FF films. You don't need a huge budget, big cast, or even great lines.If you can build up the suspense, keep people anxiously watching, and keep the mystery thrilling/scary, you can achieve FF success.And Blair Witch Project does all of the above. There's no real big payoff, but the movie will keep you at the edge of your seat and watching til the end. At least for me it did.",9,1,3,14 December 2015
Scream," Teen-High School Slasher / Mystery
","Wasn't bad, didn't blow me away.The cast was solid. Officer Dewey did well portraying the failure of a deputy.Neve Campbell started to annoy me by the end of this film though, I can't quite explain what it was. Her dramatic squinty face on screen just one too many times. Rose McGowen plays Neve's best friend and she is incredibly hot.As a typical slasher/mystery it had its moments, I wasn't terribly scared at all during the movie. I wouldn't even rate it as a horror film. I would call it a mystery/slasher.Worth watching one time through, after that it loses its charm.",7,1,1,14 December 2015
Gladiator," Epic Movie
","What more can be said that hasn't already been said?I think what I enjoyed most about this movie was the cinematography. The scenes in HD were just stunningly beautiful. The Coliseum looked so very crisp and the crowd with it. The cast deserves A+ all around.Joaquin Phoenix played the villain to absolute perfection. You will find yourself hating his character very early on. I hated him, and that's how you know he did his job.From the opening battle to the final scenes this movie is a masterpiece, one of my favorites..",10,0,0,14 December 2015
