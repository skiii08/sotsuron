Borat: Cultural Learnings of America for Make Benefit Glorious Nation of Kazakhstan," Total Garbage
","Firstly; I've never liked Borat, or Baron Cohens other creation Ali-G. Both characters are the dregs of the barrel as far as comedy goes relying on little more than winding up interviewees by exploiting peoples tendency not to want to offend others to get laughs. Anyone can raise a laugh through insulting others, it's just that most people don't try it because it's not very inventive comedy and basically just makes you look like a moron, quite frankly.It's interesting that many of the reviewers have commented on the fact that the movie relies on this type of humour in the main for it'a laughs but even that is a con. When you actually watch it, it's patently obvious that, in fact, most of the scenes which apparently involve winding people up are clearly scripted and well rehearsed. Obviously a few aren't but the majority are.I didn't like this movie one bit, it was just garbage beyond belief. I wouldn't go as far as some and say that it's was particularly offensive, although it was crude, it was just cringingly bad in places.JL.p.s. did anyone else notice that when Borat was in the gun shop attempting to buy a gun 'suitable for protection against Jews' he was actually shown an Israeli made pistol? Never did work out if that was just coincidence or some in-joke the producers were trying to make. If it was the latter, I didn't get it.",Null,1,4,2 March 2007
