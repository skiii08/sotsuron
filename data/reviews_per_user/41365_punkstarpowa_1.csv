10 Cloverfield Lane," The end ruins an excellent movie
","The entire movie is a 9 but the end drops it to a 7 (and I'm being nice). I'm not going to tell anything about the movie, if you haven't seen it yet you should because if I forget the last 15 minutes of the movie it's a perfect thriller. I was always doubting if what Howard was telling was the truth or not, it really was messing with my mind. But the last 15 minutes... I felt like I was watching a totally different movie! I just wanted to release my inner Steve Carrel and scream: 'NO, GOD! NO, GOD, PLEASE NO! NO! NO! NOOOOOO!' the movie was soooooo good but ended so stupidly bad, that's no the end I want for a thriller like that! The end is not bad but not in that movie!! And there are so many things left to explain... Honestly I feel really really pi***d! Congratulations 10 Cloverfield Lane, you made me angry!",7,0,2,10 April 2016
