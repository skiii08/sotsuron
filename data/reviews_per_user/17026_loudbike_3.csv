Borat: Cultural Learnings of America for Make Benefit Glorious Nation of Kazakhstan," Cretins Only . . . . Intelliget need not apply
","WITHOUT PREJUDICEWe were RECENTLY subjected to this pile of steaming waste (thankfully we had other diversions to keep the mind alive) and rejoiced that no money had been spent (wasted) in procuring a copy to watch. From the opening bathroom humor to the assault on Pam Anderson, there can be no movie more worthy of avoiding than this mindless attempt to insult just about everyone.To write any further would only attribute more wasted minutes to a film that deserves to be ignored, forgotten and destroyed.Those who think political correctness is a virtue now have their Antichrist. Those in favor of censorship now have a viable platform. We however support neither and those with more than 2 digit IQs will surely know better and rise above the stench created by another rude, self serving wannabe whose only intellectual match on earth is decaying in some toxic landfill. In case you were shallow enough to enjoy this bit of video crap, I mean this ALL in a nice way.",1,2,5,3 August 2008
Days of Thunder," Thanks to Robert Duvall
","A fair race movie with a winning performance by Robert Duvall.Kidmann is not believable as Cruise's Doctor, their are major continuity flaws in the race scenes, but Duvall's performance as a caring Builder and Pit Crew boss give the movie an endearing quality. And Cruise looks ridiculous on a Harley, even with a low seat and pull back bars, he can barely reach the controls or the ground. A Honda Rebel would have been more appropriate.As Driven is the all time worst race movie, watching Days Of Thunder after Driven will make Cruise and company  seem much better than watching 'Days' after a Classic like Grand Prix.Hey it could be a lot worse. Imagine this flick with the Baldwin brothers. UGH !",7,0,1,28 August 2004
The Greatest Game Ever Played," Much better than expected
","Rainy day with not much to do. We were surfing the movie network channels and found this one just starting, so we gave it a chance.The more we watched, the more we became engrossed in the story. Its the old story of working class underdog trying to make it in a sport which at the time (1913 I think) was usually played by the wealthy upper class but this movie was every bit as interesting as Seabiscuit and this is also based on a true story.The acting is believable and the casting is brilliant. AND . . . . we are NOT golfers, so please don't miss this one just because its about golf. Any individual sport would serve the plot, because it's about the people. Golf works well for this story because of the class distinction and snobbery that seem to involve some who play the game.Bottom line . . . . Its a feel good movie. It's well put together and isn't it always fun to see those who think they are better than others get taken down a peg or two.",8,0,1,9 January 2007
