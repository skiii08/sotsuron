Borat: Cultural Learnings of America for Make Benefit Glorious Nation of Kazakhstan," Outrageously funny
","I don't remember the last time I've had this much fun during a movie. It was kind of a surreal experience, since the audience had people from all age and gender groups - from youngsters to elderly couples and everyone were just bursting from laughter scene after scene.The climax for me - and for many else as well - was the scene at the hotel where Borat catches Azamat having .. erm, fun with the Baywatch magazine and the following scene with the fight and the eventual run into the conference room. Someone else used the term 'disturbingly funny' and I agree. It was disturbing but at the same time I nearly fell out of my seat laughing.There are comments on whether or not the movie and the encounters were scripted or not - it matters not. All that matters is that the movie puts Borat and us, the viewers into situations that are weird and hilariously painful to watch. And does it pretty damn well.",9,1,7,7 November 2006
