Requiem for a Dream," don't believe the hype!
","OK, so its pretty good. Anything based on a book by Selby would have to be worth watching on pedigree alone. But despite what you've read, it's certainly not the best movie ever made. I think that if you watch tons and tons of movies, as most IMDB users undoubtedly do, then of course 'Requiem' stands out from the usual, mindless dreck. But it's not all that. The performances are good, especially from Burstyn and Connolly, but I've seen this kind of thing done better, especially in 'Last Exit To Brooklyn', another movie based on a Hubert Selby Jr. novel. You want to talk riveting, check out Jennifer Jason Leigh in that film. Editing's good here, as it was in 'Pi'. Is it just me or is Aronofsky making his reputation more on images rather than content? Pretty to look at, this film. My friend has severe ADD/OCD and she was even able to sit through it. All in all, 'Requiem' is worth a look or two. Not a masterpiece, but I give it an 8.",7,0,1,2 May 2002
Fight Club," I may be paranoid, but not an android
","You know, I've resisted honestly commenting on this movie for quite some time, even though it's a favorite of mine. I suppose I wanted to wait out the firestorm to speak. And there's so many wonderful comments here! Guess there's nothing like good old fashioned sex and ultraviolence to bring out the critic in people. Perhaps it's simply the divisive nature of 'Fight Club' that will prove to be its' greatest contribution to the history of cinema.So where to begin? For sure, it's problematic. To use a cliche that just happens to be true for once, 'Fight Club' is a multi-layered film that works on a myriad of different levels. Consequently, this makes it somewhat difficult to encapsulate in just a few sentences, much less pigeonhole into a specific genre. In addition, the film is clearly directed at a rather narrow audience. And by 'narrow audience', perhaps I should say 'willfully invisible', at least until recently. See, it's important to realize that despite all the controversy surrounding it, 'Fight Club', and its' inherent yet hidden messages, appeal mainly to a so-called seething core of 'young people' (blah, blah, blah)that I propose we hereby rename 'the silent generation'. It's a GenX film, kids! High art for latchkeys. And within this restless, hyperaware, 'unsatisfied' group of individuals, there exists wildly divergent opinions about 'Fight Club'. Yet it really only boils down to one central argument: you either love it or you don't it. And if you love it, odds are it's because you get it, in one way or another. The film as a statement likely seems fairly obvious to you. But on the other hand, if you don't love this film, it's safe to assume that perhaps you might have missed the delivery of its' central themes. 'Fight Club' is about isolation, desperation, faceless (and helpless) automation, and above all, the endlessly creepy idea of oppressive consumerism as an ideal for living. Truly pathetic. So if this is your kind of movie, it's likely that you not only 'comprehend' it, but you are also luckily in possession of the black, spastic humor often required of one's self to coexist in harmony with today's modern, modern world. You're awake. You're aware. You're coping. Good for you.I love 'Fight Club', in case you couldn't guess. Not just the finished product, but the entire project. It's a brilliantly open-ended satire, with first-rate performances from all involved. Palahniuk writes like an angel (exterminating), Fincher directs with a keenly evil eye, and Norton's quickly becoming the finest actor of his generation, bar none. Helena Bonham Carter is great here too, deliciously playing it for all it's worth. Even Mr. Pitt-Aniston out does himself here. So is 'Fight Club' all about raging, unchecked egos? Sure. Is it about disillusionment and the disenfranchised? You betcha. Is it about fascism? Misogynism? Deadbeat dads? Rampant closeted homosexuality? Any of the stupid names we call ourselves each night? Well...do you want it to be? Like the film says, you determine your own level of involvement here. Get it? There's more than a few kernels of truth floating around in 'Fight Club' which, as we all know, shall set your a** free.A final note. If you're really into this movie (and you know who you are), I feel confident in saying that you're probably into darker, decidedly more intelligent things as well. You take 'Fight Club' for what it is, a cleverly executed joke. Which makes dissecting it over and over again, especially with the uninitiated, somewhat redundant. So I apologize for this lengthy diatribe. But may I smugly suggest one final rule? The ninth, if you will. The 9th rule of Fight Club is 'fights will only occur between those evolved enough to handle it'. Thank you.We are the dollars and cents.",9,0,1,2 October 2002
Crash," witness for the prosecution
","i rarely pan anything but i just have to say that if one truly wants to study the dumbing-down of America, look no further than this piece of tripe. 'crash' pretends to be some searing indictment of race in this country and just fails horribly at it. to begin with, it is a none too subtle rip-off of 'magnolia', 'traffic', and several other better-made films and it doesn't even steal from them all that well. there are at least four too many characters here, none of which are developed enough for you to care deeply about any of them, including the better-known players. shoddy b-list acting from b-list actors here, let's be honest. don cheadle probably should have known better, but i'm sure he was well compensated for his work. but perhaps the worst thing about this train wreck of a film is that the overwrought and all too convenient plot simply goes nowhere and does nothing. the entire point of using this type of storytellling is to take the magic realism that you have created in order to make some grand statement about your chosen subject and it fails to do even that. what's the point here? that racism is alive and well? that there is a class system? that America is essentially unjust? ummm....no duh? most people figure that out somewhere around the seventh grade. it's called capitalism. i mean, what is going on here? but perhaps the most depressing thing about 'crash' is how a film like this can now be hailed as visionary in today's society. FINGERS will be pointed! EARNEST DIALOGUES will be opened! GREAT DEBATES will rage! i mean, wtf? have we become so blinded and desensitized and beaten over the head with the constant idiocy in this country (particularly in our arts and letters) that a film like 'crash' is now considered high art? wake up people. it's nothing more than pop psychology. it's dramedy. it's dr. phil. it's tight easy answers dressed up in sugary hallmark sentiment. most of all, it's crap. i know it and deep down so do you. what happened to artistic conscience? to those of you that should know better but are still falling all over yourself about this picture (and you know who you are), i would just like to ask you what happened to standing by the courage of your convictions or even having any kind of conviction at all about ANYTHING? i mean, #55 ALL-TIME????????? are you kidding me with this? 'crash' is the very worst kind of film making, simply because it's pretending to be something it's not. 'crash' telegraphed its intentions right from the get go. underneath all of the gloss and artifice and putting on of airs, 'crash' is actually much closer to a film like 'training day', another movie that could have been said so much more than it did. but at least 'training day' wasn't screwing with its audience, selling them something other than what they paid for. to be fair, 'crash' is pretty to look at, but not much more. it's a gauzy pig wrapped in velvet and gussied up with all the bells and whistles that you would expect, but it's a pig nonetheless. it's 'urban realism' for the Saturday night date set. i could have just stayed home and watched music videos, so shallow and surface-y do i find the artistic statement presented here. and before you call foul, please know that i am of a minority background and that i do indeed live in a major urban center. i hate feeling that i have to provide a DISCLAIMER when stating my opinion on a film, but it feels like this is EXACTLY the case, so openly and irresponsibly does 'crash' play the race card. how ironic. and rarely does a movie provoke such a visceral response from me either and usually when it does, it's because it's GOOD and i just haven't realized it yet. i can't tell you just how much that's not the case here. sorry.",1,6,16,15 October 2005
2001: A Space Odyssey," Most ambitious movie ever made
","Here's the thing. A lot of people don't get 2001 because they are viewing it strictly as entertainment. Not to say that it is not entertaining in its own way, its just that the movie is meant to provoke you. It is meant to inspire you, to confuse you, to spark dialogues, to make you argue with others. This is a new kind of movie made by a visionary director, and human being, who understood where we are headed. This is film as philosophy. This is a film about ideas. This is Aristotle and Plato and Socrates holding cameras. 2001 is the most ambitious movie ever made and will not likely be duplicated anytime soon. The fact that it makes one cry, or another smile, or another one p***ed off is exactly the point. I truly believe that film is the greatest art form ever conceived by man thus far, and that it is our purest. Done well, film is a perfect blend of all the other forms that have gone before it. 2001 is what film could be, should be, and hopefully someday, will be. Not only is it prophetic fiction, it's a painting. Not only is it poetry, but there's even a symphony! If you don't like it, pick up a camera and make your own movie.
