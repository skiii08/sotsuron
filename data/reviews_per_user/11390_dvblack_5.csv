Catch Me If You Can," Brilliant re-creation of the '60s
","CATCH ME IF YOU CAN  <10> Leonardo DiCaprio, Tom Hanks, Martin Sheen Dir: Steven SpielbergBased on a true story, the FBI is on the trail of a young checkforger. The film is takes place in the 1960s, and is brilliantly donein the film style of era. The opening credits are animated, and setthe tone for the movie. While leisurely in its pacing, CATCH ME isby no means slow. I saw this with a full house, and there wasmuch outright, prolonged laughter!",10,0,1,3 January 2003
How to Lose a Guy in 10 Days," If you buy the premise, the story is mildly amusing.
","I love romantic comedies. I held high hopes for this one. But the setup is such a stretch that it's difficult to suspend disbelief. The IDEA sounds clever, but the writing does not deliver. At times I thought I was watching a Doris Day / Rock Hudson movie,or an episode of I LOVE LUCY.  In the end, either would have been a better choice.",5,0,0,8 February 2003
Insomnia," An intense psychological drama.
","INSOMNIA  **+_  Crime/Thriller Al Pacino, Robin Williams, Hilary SwankIn rural Alaska, a police detective attempts to catch a murder suspect, but mistakenly shoots his own partner. The detective constructs an ever more complex web of lies to hide it. Then the bad guy tries his hand at blackmail. The title derives from the detective's inability to sleep with the combination of Alaska's midnight sun and his guilt over killing his partner. An intense psychological drama.",6,0,0,12 June 2002
The Bourne Identity," Reminiscent of European secret agent films of the 1960s, but better done.
","BOURNE IDENTITY  ***_  Action/Adventure Matt Damon, Franka Potente, Clive OwenJason Bourne can't remember anything prior to two weeks ago, when he was pulled out of the sea by a fishing trawler. But the CIA remembers him -- and wants him dead (Why is it always the CIA?). BOURNE is reminiscent of European secret agent films of the 1960s, except this is better done. Matt Damon does a fine job in the lead role. Good performances all around. Fistfights, gunfire, and a long car chase.",7,0,1,14 June 2002
Windtalkers," Endless close combat, machine-gun fire, and explosions.
","WINDTALKERS  *+__  War/Action Nicolas Cage, Adam Beach, Peter StormareDuring WWII, a group of Navajo Indians enlist in the Marines to form a spoken code based on the Navajo language. Based on a true story. Unfortunately the details and story surrounding the Code Talkers is not nearly as well developed as one would have hoped. We see endless close combat, machine-gun fire, and explosions. Nicolas Cage and Adam Beach accomplish multiple John Wayne style acts of heroism. These were Marines on the very front lines, after all. Still, the filmmakers didn't need to include every explosion of every battle in this one film. If you've seen WE WERE SOLDIERS or the first reel of SAVING PRIVATE RYAN, you have an idea of the intensity we are talking about here. This genre of film, which seems to be popular right now, shows the violence and gore of war in way more detail than I require.",4,0,0,14 June 2002
