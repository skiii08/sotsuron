Borat: Cultural Learnings of America for Make Benefit Glorious Nation of Kazakhstan," Too Late now...
","I realize that it is too late now but, I am surprised that the filmmakers didn't film tons of extra material. They should have filmed at least enough footage to comprise a second feature length film. Although I am not as big a 'Bruno' fan, as I am 'Borat', I at least hope that they follow that line of logic. It would obviously take a while to comprise all of the necessary material but, had they done so with 'Borat', I'm sure that they would have been extremely relieved that they had done so, and they would have had the sequel that many people want 'in the can'.<ul><li>EDDIE WRETCH P.S. It is late at night and I am not proof reading this post, so please forgive me for all of the grammatical and spelling errors contained with-in.</li></ul>",10,0,23,24 December 2006
