The Ring," Uhm.. scariest movie ever? What are these people smoking?
","This movie was EXTREMELY average. *SPOILERS FOLLOW*How can anyone actually be scared by this? Oh god no, they watch a video tape and they'll be killed in 7 days! Can we say plot holes?As many other posts have mentioned, the girl had no motivation to do this? She was just plain evil? Anna Morgan wasn't meant to have a child? Uhm right. Makes sense.Then we have flies coming out of TVs. Ok maybe this is from the well - but a little more explanation?How was the video tape made? Why was it made? Who made it?And probably the funniest thing in the whole movie - the blurred faces? Where the hell's the explanation of that? They can't take a photo or video of their face because it's blurred? They used that idea in the first maybe 30 minutes of the movie and then dropped it completely?How was she able to kill them? How did she make their heart stop? Was it her soul? Was she a ghost? Did she have some real life contact who was committing all the murders?! WHAT WAS IT!This movie is so full of plot holes it's not even funny. I laughed at this movie where I should have been scared. It's a joke, The Sixth Sense walks ALL over this movie. They're incomparable.Yet another pathetic teen horror movie. *sigh*",Null,0,0,22 November 2002
Sin City," What the?
","Is it just me or are people stupid? 8.4?! TOP 250?! This story-less, grotesque piece of I don't know what? Ah yes, a movie about almost nothing done in black and white with an incredible amount of overdone gore should definitely by one of the greatest movies of all time.How about no? In fact, I knew this movie was going to be worthless the minute I saw 'Guest Director: Quentin Tarantino' in the opening credits. Has he produced ANYTHING decent? Let's look. Kill Bill - OK, it's about a blonde girl who was stabbed in the back hunting down her killer right? And instead of being a movie, it's like a video game! Kill as many people in the most overdone and bloody way possible. These are the kind of movies I used to invent when I was 8 years old.Reservoir Dogs? Ah yes! Let's chop off someone's ear and everyone will love it. What a joke! Quentin Tarantino is one of the worst directors I've ever come across, seriously. How anyone in their right mind could possibly rate this movie or any other of his 'works' above a 2 is just mind boggling.The scary thing is, no matter how bad the movie was, I knew that I'd jump on IMDb and it'd be sitting in the top 250 purely because it was one of Quention Tarantino's mind-numbing crap, AGAIN.A summary of IMDb ratings: if it's different, makes no sense and generally doesn't appeal to the masses, 7.5+. If it's funny, entertaining, and made to appeal the masses, NEVER more than 7.Bah!",2,3,7,14 July 2005
