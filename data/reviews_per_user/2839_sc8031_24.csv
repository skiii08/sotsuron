Scarface," Not someone I'd bring to dinner
","'Scarface' is a strangely alluring movie. The film is held together by Al Pacino's charismatic performance, the ostentatious '80s design and sets, and a dirge-like synthesizer soundtrack by Giorgio Moroder. Al Pacino's portrayal is really wonderful, giving an extreme amount of depth to an emotional, desperate character and helps the film redefine and brutally modernize the crime genre. Scarface chronicles the rise of Tony Montana, a Cuban criminal who immigrates to Miami in the early '80s and gradually attains influence in the drug trade. Tony's rise in the drug trade is interesting because it is the only avenue for his ambition. As a second-class citizen, an uneducated Cuban in 1980s America, Tony immediately realizes he will go nowhere working a 9-5 vending job. We watch him and his best friend work their way through gruesome early jobs and earn the respect of their coked-up drug boss. Of course, you can guess where the story goes since it has become so famous in modern film.There is a distinct contrast between Pacino's role here and in the Godfather films. This film is long, but the pacing is fairly continuous. There's even a montage (gotta have a montage!) at the beginning of the second half of the film to cover a long span of time really quickly. At times the film can feel draining because the drawn-out dialogs are often about such greedy, shallow, or heated personal topics -- or they just descend into Tony's uncanny ability to curse up a storm. Especially in the second half of the film, when Tony's personal vendettas and passive-aggressive traits become exacerbated by substance abuse. There are certainly a few twists in the plot, but they are somewhat predictable and simply have to do with Tony's bursts of anger. This is sometimes boring because the self-destructive nature of characters like Tony has been covered with greater depth by more succinct films ('Raging Bull', 'Aguirre: The Wrath of God'), so Scarface sometimes becomes something of an aesthetic experience. But then again, the aesthetics are so highly appealing: a flashy portrayal of Cuban subculture in early '80s Miami.I'm not sure if this film is quite as focused as the later Pacino/De Palma movie, 'Carlito's Way'. That one has a better sense of narration and features characters who are less distant. It gets to the point more quickly. But Scarface is completely unique. Scarface places the whole American dream within a newly interpreted context. Tony comes to America and works his way to the top through the only path that is open to him. It changed crime films forever and did something totally new with the classic rags-to-riches tale. Influential, ultra-violent, and interestingly admired in modern pop-culture.",8,2,5,14 September 2008
Borat: Cultural Learnings of America for Make Benefit Glorious Nation of Kazakhstan," Are YOU dumber than Sacha, too?
","I don't think this is as funny as the Borat sketches Sacha Baron Cohen did on his earlier series, 'Da Ali G Show'. Those, being limited to about 7 minutes, were much more digestible. The Borat movie is pretty funny for the first third or so, but becomes kind of tiresome after a while. It ends up feeling kinda mean-spirited.To me, this kind of candid humor is more like horror. You can argue that Sacha Baron Cohen, a borderline sociopath, is making some kind of statement about racism or elitism or the people in the US. Whatever. I don't buy it. I think he just gets a kick out of this stuff.There are certainly some funny scenes, but in the end it amounts to Sacha exploiting people who are dumber than him. Sure it's funny to the audience, but you're watching his movie and giving him money. You're dumber than him too.",5,2,3,25 June 2008
Mulan," Jerry Goldsmith and Donny Osmond failed to make a man out of me!
","'Mulan' is one of Disney's last 'hand-drawn' animated works from before it bought Pixar and started exclusively producing computer-animated films and pre-teen pop starlets. The animation here is certainly nice when compared to Disney's television shows, but like other Disney cartoons from this era (Pocahontas, The Emperor's New Groove) the lines are simple, the colors are a bit flat and the cast seems to be on auto-pilot. Yeah, Mulan isn't a Disney film that I would say was particularly 'inspired'.The musical numbers by Jerry Goldsmith are pretty droll and even offensive (for instance, the fat Chinese soldier character sings about how his ideal woman would know how to cook beef, chicken and pork; you know, like on a Chinese food menu?). Donny Osmond sings the main theme song for Mulan's training montage. I don't like Osmond, but the song is actually flawed by the weak and tepid songwriting, not the vocal performance. Most of the songs here are memorable because they're so laughably awful. I mean, compared to 'Beauty and the Beast', 'Aladdin' or 'The Lion King' the songs here are not even in the same ballpark.Eddie Murphy isn't laugh-out-loud hilarious, but he's the only saving grace of the film. He voices a sassy supporting role, Mulan's pet dragon and best friend, and is the only entertaining part of the film. He's a little miscast, but is also somehow the only substantial character. For instance, the villains (here it's the Mongolian Horde, ancient China's consistent historical adversary) have such little character depth -- not to mention humanity. I know Disney films paint the world in simplistic shades of good and evil, but good golly... the Mongolians are depicted here as a collective race of monsters! They're given no incentive or individual reason for existence. And I don't recall seeing any female Mongolians either. Their whole depiction is clumsy and comes across as ignorant. Also, it's kind of weird that Mulan falls in love with a tough guy who, well... beats her into shape. The film's not unwatchable, it's just really mediocre. The use of the CGI makes it clear that Disney was just about finished with their signature (historically significant) hand-drawn animated works. But Mulan comes nowhere close to any of Disney's back catalog. To any parents looking for a good Disney animated film to watch with their kids, go for anything before Pocahontas. Mulan is lackluster in the departments of charm, pacing, songwriting and memorability. I've heard the more recent animated Disney film 'Lilo & Stitch' was much better, so maybe I should check that out.",4,5,17,28 August 2008
Juno," More painful than having kids
","'Juno' feels like a movie churned out by irresponsible, incompetent corporate hipsters for up-and-coming ever-more-shallow teenage hipsters. It has nothing to say about pregnancy (though it seems to be pro-life, whatever that means to you), does not take the responsibility of teen pregnancy seriously, is not realistic in its character portrayals, the script does not function to transmit the story, and it is not ever funny (yes, it actually makes 'Knocked Up' look like a masterpiece). Of course, I was only watching 'Juno' to make sure I, uh... yeah I don't know why I watched it.Honestly, this movie felt like a big slap in the face. This won an Oscar for its screenplay? I don't have high hopes for Oscar ceremonies but good grief! Apparently this was written by a twenty-something ex-stripper, ex-blogger who goes by the name Diablo Cody. Not that I have anything against her past professions or hobbies, but this writing is vapid, jerky, amateur and betrays a nihilistic vanity that tries to trade dopey Suicide Girl/Indie-rock cuteness for cleverness. Most of the dialog consists of internet slang or currently hip things to say amongst white suburban indie-rock/punk-ish kids who go to college or live in a group-house. In other words, this is the pinnacle of corporate sludge being marketed as counter-culture. It's feeding regurgitated jokes to the same people who already use them.It's not just the dialog. The whole movie is emblazoned by this: the music is a constant barrage of Elliott Smith rip-off artists (who are exceptionally dopey and spoiled sounding) and the costumes and sets look like really grimy versions of a Wes Anderson movie, maybe combined with the aesthetic of that old MTV show, 'Daria' (although don't be confused by my assessment, since Daria was actually a decent show with a message -- it's just the aesthetic that has been copied). And Juno really relies on music to both indicate the emotional texture of the scenes (spoiled, whiny, fake cuteness) and to transition between them.By the time the movie is halfway finished, you're just praying for someone to shut Ellen Page's character up. I guess she's supposed to be spunky or wise or some other completely irrelevant fake adjective for her obviously insecure and depressing character. I really don't know or care. I do know that the most important relationship in the movie -- the one between her and Michael Cera (here playing a character that acts just like Michael Cera) -- is given the least amount of attention of any relationship in the movie. It's brushed-over, undynamic and undeveloped. What gives? Man, this movie actually seems malicious. It's like if someone made a nihilistic bubbly comedy about how having a baby is made of win. Yes, made of win. But unfortunately this movie is made of epic fail.",1,26,54,17 September 2008
Match Point," Woody Allen presents... a whole new kind of depressing film-making!
","Woody Allen himself has said this is perhaps the best film he has ever made. And surely, this is one of Woody Allen's more notable films, a stand-out entry in his canon if only for the fact that it is so much darker than anything else he previously directed (save for possibly his best work, 'Crimes and Misdemeanors'). The serious material and location also break the typical Woody Allen rhythm of bittersweet comedic romance in New York City. Instead, this film takes place amongst the elite upper classes of London (which Woody unfortunately does not have the background to explore or present with a local's expertise) and investigates social climbing, nepotist opportunism and impractical lustful obsession.The plot involves a mild-mannered amateur tennis pro named Chris (played by Jonathan Rhys Meyers, who looks like a splicing of Joaquin Phoenix and Ewan MacGregor) who works his way into the London upper classes by kindling a friendship with one of his male clients. The same client has a fiancée, Nola Rice (Scarlett Johannsen) with whom Chris develops an unhealthy obsession. Scarlett Johannsen seems to be Woody's current eye-candy muse, the clumsily acting starlet of his recent movies. This is the first Allen movie to feature Scarlett, and while she's much better cast here than in almost any other film she's been in, she is still a mediocre actress. The performances and dialog are all above average (again, save for Scarlett and the fact that I don't know what passes for quality English dialog, hee hee!) and the cinematography is clean and pristine. So are most of the locations actually, often bright, clean and spacious -- in vivid contrast to the nature of the plot. In fact, some of the interior locations of this movie are reminiscent of the futuristic, super-silly sets of Allen's early 'Sleeper'. The difference is that the sets here are create an ominous atmosphere (almost like a Poe story, sans the macabre decadence). As a film this holds together really well, but is incredibly depressing and somewhat self-important. There are some surprises and twists left open to interpretation, but the open-ended nature of some portions of it make it depressingly realistic. As a drama and suspense piece it is one of the best for it's professional inspiration, painless pacing (despite the slow plot development) and manages to be one of Woody's more notable films.",8,1,1,10 August 2008
Lost in Translation," The Film Equivalent of 'Coldplay'
","Although the pop-group, 'Coldplay' evokes supposed musical melancholy to a large mass of people, to me it evokes money-making nostalgia for a time when one wasn't such a money-making sellout. I.e. it sounds weak, not weepy; bored, not melancholic.Thus is my argument for this film and most of Sofia Coppola's work. Her movies are kitschy pop film pieces, masquerading behind the imagery of deeper film-makers before her. A la Coldplay versus Radiohead, post-punk or Elliott Smith.I, like every other dopey American, thinks night-time shots of Kyoto are mysterious and alluring and would like to be jaded and melancholy in a crazy Japanese metropolis. However, I don't know if this movie does much for me in painting that cheesy fantasy.I really don't know about the character developments here. Giovanni Ribisi's convenient photographer 'character', John, is unrealistically aloof from his mopey wife, Charlotte (Scarlett!). He's friends with this girl, Kelly (Anna Farina, famous from Scary Movie) who is freaking annoying on the deep end of the scale. She evokes the lowest-common-denominator of annoying, so that anyone seeing the film can understand how stupid she is in comparison to the lead characters. 'Course, John (Ribisi) doesn't notice this annoying twerp like Charlotte does! Zoinks! Now Charlotte feels soooo socially alienated!!! I mean, geez, could you spell it out any more clearly for us, Mme. Directeuse? With characters like these, this movie borders on social indoctrination! There are a bunch of moments like this. The wisdom Bill Murray's character Bob (What About Bob?) imparts to Charlotte in these situations is basically on the level of an older brother telling his younger sister not to care what stupid frat jocks think about her booty. If there's a reason this movie evokes emotions you can't quite put into words, it's because the movie doesn't know what it's trying to do. This movie is like some meandering indie-rock song that SOUNDS kind of melancholy, but is not concisely written with any theme or message that stands out. Highlights: --Scarlett Johannsen crying at the Buddhist-Shinto shrine --the see-thru underwear on her butt at the opening shot --scientologists in lead roles --Bill Murray crying (he's a tragic character on a level unbeknownst to himself)",3,3,7,18 June 2008
Little Miss Sunshine," The film that will turn you on to Proust
","Funny how any movie that doesn't completely suck gets put in IMDb's top 250 list right quick. 'The will of the people is strong, but their ability to forget is insurmountable' (or something or other paraphrased from Mein Kampf). Democracy! Yay! In other words: people rush out to vote for films based on fleeting emotional tangents which would be more strongly evoked by older movies that did it with more class.Not that this is necessarily the case here. Little Miss Sunshine is decent -- sufficiently heart-warming and bittersweet. You know, one of those movies about how we have to love the people we're with even if we don't like them or get along too well on a personal level. It demonstrates how these familial bonds are tested in stressful and depressing circumstances, but these are the only bonds that can survive such circumstances. I can jive with that message.Or maybe I'm just reading into it. REGARDLESS, the cast works well together and the pacing is good and there are some genuine laughs along the way. I didn't cry and call all my friends after watching it, but it is affecting.",7,1,2,17 July 2008
Spirited Away," Spirited Away (or, How Sen Got Her Groove Back)
","What is there to say about a film you give 10 stars? Only a few films fit the bill and this is one of them, featuring Miyazaki and his Ghibli crew at their very finest. Everything is in balance here, the Miyazaki-isms working at full charming blast. Spirited Away delves into a beautifully imagined world of mystical Shinto-like abstracts. It is a solid modern myth, with the spirit of folk-lore and fairy tales, the endearing, exploring nature found in RPG videogames, and the greatest tales of adventure and heroism.Miyazaki has mentioned that he doesn't think young girls have enough good role models in the media and in response he fashions his characters as upstanding paragons of virtue. As others have mentioned, every single character, every little dust mite and creature is given a fleshed out personality in this film. Everything on the screen has full life breathed into it; the whole affair borders on being genuine sorcery.And the pacing here is fantastic too. The film gradually unveils all the regions and character elements of Yubaba's mansion with appropriately shifting thematic events. Miyazaki's storyboard has the masterful crescendos and smooth resolutions of Kurosawa's finest moments -- a compliment not easily distributed. As such, the entire film is a breeze to sit through and you'll find yourself consistently curious as to what each scene will bring or how it will resolve itself. And the answer is always a delightful surprise.This is supposedly the highest-grossing film of all time in Japan and is probably the most famous Japanese animated film to be released in North America besides 'Akira'. This is with good reason, although I've heard other viewers complain of the abstract qualities of the tale. But I find that the abstract elements neatly tie together without necessitating any hindsight critique. Does that make sense to you? No? Too bad!",10,0,0,9 September 2008
No Country for Old Men," No Money For Old People
","This movie is weird because: the acting and casting is great, the characters are great, the cinematography and filming is gorgeous, the absence of a soundtrack works in the film's favor, and the dialog and writing are great too; and yet the film is not particularly rewarding.If you want clean conclusions or breathtaking innovation to enjoy a movie, look elsewhere because this movie doesn't have either of those. I found myself thinking of 'Way of the Gun' or even 'U-Turn' a little bit, for the locale, style, colors, and writing. Of course those movies didn't have the substance or character depth of this one, and maybe they were a little more openly violent, but this movie is obscenely violent too. This one's just more accessible because it's so minimalist, professional and easy on the eyes. Fair enough. Mondo points for environmental realism and aesthetic perfection found here.A weird thing in this one is how the violence is shown to be grotesque for its nonchalance, but then there's this odd dark sense of comedy that creeps into certain scenes; like the way the killer Chigurh is careful about getting blood on his boots/clothes or asks people for information. Maybe it was the film-maker's intent, but those little flashes of dark humor make the movie even more depressing.Chigurh started to seem way too much like the T-800 in 'The Terminator' (the first one). You know, he just logically does things that are useful and accessible to him, without any emotional feedback. It works and is scary, but when he goes and does the whole self-surgery thing after being injured, the parallel is too obvious (intentional?). Also, I know the absence of a background makes Chigurh mysterious, but where does his wealth of knowledge come from? Who let him accumulate medical knowledge so that he could operate on himself? That just seems kinda far-fetched. Like, he didn't just decide to go killing one day. He is a freaking emotionless drifter who goes from point A to point B with random incentives that mean nothing! Chigurh is an archetype of contrast to society in general. He's an outsider not just to the West Texas locale, but to human beings of all stripes. Still, I felt like he was a bit too cartoon-ish, not in his actions, but in his mannerisms and motivations.The other two male leads in this film are more interesting REAL characters. Haha, there certainly is a tough-guy, salt-of-the-earth, grizzled-badass theme going on here! Hence I suppose it is rather interesting that the directors do not play the character contrasts out as one typically sees them in westerns or crime films. In fact, many of the most climactic scenes here are not even shown. A Coen Bros. special twist!'No Country' is very good, but is typical of Coen brothers films, blending a few genres (typically crime, comedy and western) and doing it with substance and style. They do it here, but not with the same degree of success or originality of prior films. It's just masterful craftsmanship, rather than brilliant creativity. And I feel as if the open-ended nature of this movie makes people give it more artistic credibility than they should.7.5",8,1,4,23 June 2008
Batman Begins," The Scarecrow gave everybody 'shrooms
","I don't know if I didn't drink the kool-aid or eat the Scarecrow's mushrooms or what, but I was disappointed by this film.The movie is dark, which is appropriate to the comic adaption (Frank Miller comics are grimy and violent -- he's the Tarantino of comic books) but it is almost too much. The movie begins to feel grimy, with its dark green, brown and grey tones. The settings at Arkham Asylum made me feel like I was watching a snuff-porn movie.There is some pretty wacky casting. Katie Holmes as the DA? Sure, whatever. Gary Oldman as Commish Gordon? What gives?! We wait 20 years to get Oldman, one of the greatest film actors of our generation, in a Batman film and he plays the dry, uninteresting Commissioner Gordon? *cries* Even Christian Bale, normally pretty solid, is kinda stiff here.The camera-work is really a headache. Every time we see a fight scene, there are so many cuts and camera angles, you can't see what is going on. I suspect that this is to hide poorly choreographed fighting, but I suppose the actual fighting in Batman movies is always terrible. I do give them credit for making an effort to implement authentic martial arts into this one.The villains are pretty lousy, and I think this is a major pitfall. Liam Neeson was an unintimidating cheeseball, and the big revelations or threats to Batman towards the end of the film are so uninspired. The Scarecrow was such a pretty pony-boy (instead of a tragically insane doctor) who looked a lot like Bruce Wayne. What I would give for Oldman to play a villain in one of these films! It's definitely better than the last two Batman movies before this one, but the two directed by Tim Burton as well as the animated 'Batman: Mask of the Phantasm' overall are more enjoyable experiences for me. Maybe the next one'll clean up these problems, with a better villain. I'm looking forward to it.",6,0,2,27 May 2008
"Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon"," It's not really a martial arts flick
","Okay, this movie is decent, but it's not one of the best films of all time. It is certainly stylish, well thought-out, well acted and innovative in the elements that are combined in its execution, but the characters and story do not allow it to attain the status of masterpiece.My main problem is that the background is sort of a vague fantasy. It is a distinct period piece with generous creative liberties taken on behalf of the director. We know it is Qing China based on the family life of Jen (Ziyi Zhang) but nothing in the film is particularly historical. There are vague horde-like bandits, Wudang martial arts, random snippets of 'philosophy' that sound like they could possibly be Buddhist or Daoist, yet nothing is concrete. This kinda irked me when I watched the movie recently. Despite appearing as a religious or martial arts-themed film, the film doesn't investigate either of those things.I also didn't particularly care for any of the characters. No one had a real sense of humor and the love theme (THE theme) struck me as cliché and predictable. The main character, Jen, is supposed to be some kind of symbol of tortured feminism from this period (she can't be happy anywhere in this society) but it didn't come across very eloquently. I found her a real hassle to watch on-screen. Or maybe that's the point?The musical score was a bit much. I felt the film-makers were relying a bit too much on the music. Perhaps the film is indeed rather balanced, in making sure not to leave the viewer's attention on any one technical aspect, so in that regard it is a very good mainstream cinematic work. But the shots of the Gobi Desert 'contrasted' against Yo-Yo Ma's cello playing was just over-saturation and bordered on self-parody.I don't think this or anything else I've seen by Ang Lee is necessarily a masterpiece (although I should point out I have not seen Brokeback Mountain or Lust/Caution). But it is a very solid, entertaining film.",7,0,1,6 July 2008
Dog Day Afternoon," Anti-climatic, aged, but well-crafted and inspired
","'Dog Day Afternoon' is the famous (purportedly true) story of a bank heist gone wrong. Because its reputation precedes it, it lacks in flashy shoot-outs, and its social commentary tirades are a bit outdated, the movie may not deliver to modern audiences with the same gravity as it did when it was released. The film is a showcase for one of Pacino's most controlled, nuanced performances and the story has some interesting things to say about loyalty within relationships and friendships. There is some amusing dialog with regards to Vietnam veterans, transgender and homosexual romance and even smoking (maybe a touchy subject at the time).The film feels longer than it is and seems to build toward a surprise twist that never appears, but it is solidly crafted throughout and the climax itself is much more intoxicating for the masterful build-up. The tasteful camera cinematography (a staple of pre-80s films!) and the absence of a musical score both work to accentuate the character portraits and claustrophobic nature of the situation.While maybe not one of the greatest movies of all time, it's certainly one of the notable ones of its decade, expertly crafted with some stand-out performances by Pacino and John Cazale. And while influencing a number of films since its release, 'Dog Day Afternoon', also seems to have been the inspiration for the charming early '90s comedy, 'Airheads', about a band of metalheads who get trapped while holding up an LA radio station.",8,0,1,18 October 2008
Ghostbusters," So good it should be an intraveinous drug
","Les hommes, this is one of the best films you will ever see. I once talked to some Swedish girls who said they hated it, but they must've been eating too much lutefisk. This is a pinnacle in movie-making.For one thing, it has the absolute best ever pacing of almost anything I've ever seen ever in my whole life. There is not a slow moment. The whole dang movie feels like 30 seconds in length. I swear, it's freakin' sorcery! If you see someone watching it, I guarantee that you will blink and realize you've been there for 2 hours.I first saw this when it premiered on network television in the US (I was like 2 or 3) and then went on to become an official member of the Ghostbusters cult. Today as a grown, 'mature', individual, I own all 140 episodes of the cartoon series on DVD and I don't even have a DVD player! Amazing casting, amazing writing, amazing music, amazing amazing amazing. This movie is like a drug. Oh my god. I could just inject this movie into my veins! I would wither away in a sea of bliss, ignorant and impervious to the outside world...",9,1,2,28 May 2008
Transformers," Optimus Prime and co. save humans from the terrifying scourge of product placements
","As an old-school fan of Transformers, I can't say I was too excited about seeing it transition into a big-screen Michael Bay production. The results are actually not as bad as I had anticipated, but some of the characters' dialog is so downright awful, while watching it, I myself wanted to 'transform' -- by which I mean extend my limbs and transplant myself out of the room in which the film was playing. (Get it?!?!?) *tumbleweeds roll by* The special effects are good for the present moment and there are some pretty sweet action scenes. I do kind of love how they're badass robots but end up fighting with typical grappling martial arts. The music is adequate epic Hollywood action-adventure symphony stuff, but then interspersed with random segments of 'nu-metal' riffs during cheesy action sequences. And then for some reason the film ends with a Linkin Park song. Which is funny because the film already ends on such a cliché, sappy note and then gives you permanent low self-esteem with the song that plays during the end credits.Ah, I guess that's to be expected of a film that flashes Mountain Dew and Pepsi every 10 minutes and is one long commercial for GMC and the (then) new Chevy Camaro. From what I understand, enlightened cybernetic beings will one day be made from superior industrial products, which you should buy now. Oh yeah, and enlightened cybernetic beings also use dated American street slang, like 'roll out'. Natch.Pretty entertaining stuff, but so empty and cliché it's almost incredible. Everything in this movie is a macrocosm of Megan Fox's presence and role: really nice to look at, but with absolutely nothing to say at all. I mean, it's basically X-Men, but with Transformers: Blahblahblah, 'Transformers/XMen/Gargoyles/Spidermen are bad! Send in the military!' ...rabblerabblerabble... 'Stop! Those are the GOOD Transformers/XMen/Gargoyles!!' Blarbyblarblar... 'Humans are bad! You are friends with humans so you die!' blahblahblah 'No! Some are good so we should let them live!' And that's about it.",5,2,5,7 January 2009
Kill Bill: Vol. 1," It ain't no Fujisaku, but it has its own flavor
","I feel like Tarantino (kinda like Takashi Miike) likes to cast certain actors/actresses as B-movie-esquire novelties. I.e. the female roles in this one: Darryl Hannah, Lucy Liu, Vivica A. Fox and Uma Thurman are all laughably terrible actresses (particularly in these roles). Perhaps they DO actually accentuate the comical stripes of this movie, but I think a lot of people won't get this element. I think this is fair enough (movies are often exploitative by nature) but I thought the female lead should have been a better choice. The way these female leads are cast (as opposed to the male leads) makes this seem kind of chauvinistic. My main gripe was the presence of Uma Thurman. I don't think the woman can act or fight her way out of a paper bag -- and it shows. I know, this film is a fantasy. I'm not criticizing this from an 'academic' or professional perspective. It just made the whole experience kind of unenjoyable for me; it distorted the sense of immersion the experience was trying to fulfill.Tarantino left out several of the fundamental elements found in classic '70s martial arts and gangster movies that other fans like him really appreciate. Here I didn't find the characters to be remotely memorable or believable. I mean, I didn't really notice anyone but the repulsive but attractive character of Chiaki Kuriyama. Most of the other characters struck me as kinda uninteresting. What's weird is that his stuff is actually a little grimier than the earlier movies he takes inspiration from. I did appreciate the camera work during that epic battle scene, and the cinematography was pretty decent. The sets were impressive and the costumes and aesthetics all very distinct and colorful in the line of Yakuza and chambara flicks Tarantino likes. The choreography was not so much to my liking, but a lot of this was because Uma Thurman is the focal point of the camera and yet she cannot move efficiently enough for the scene to be convincing. Let's just say, it's not a display of athletic prowess, hee hee... Of course, that kind of swordplay is hard to do, it's just weird someone so clumsy would be doing it.I can't tell if it is cool or annoying that Sonny Chiba appears here. It's interesting that he appears not as an action star, but as a sword-maker. And why 'The Bride'/Beatrix needs a sword is beyond me, honestly. I guess it's just an excuse to provide a scene with sword-making? I found that whole scene to be a bit much - B-movie camp presented with the budget and lack of experience to make it pretentious. It's no 'Makai Tensho' sword-making scene, that's for sure! Ah, I guess the problem I have is that all criticism of this stuff can be written off by Tarantino and his advocates as being B-movie fun, or an homage to past flicks, or ironic, or intentionally un-serious, or just a fantasy universe he cooked up. Which all proves that this stuff is mean-spirited or gratuitous for the sake of gratuity. There is not much in the way of plot or likable characters to warrant watching this, but just a penchant for mindless violence and suffering. But I guess the characters aren't supposed to be real since their suffering is not necessarily supposed to be affecting? Here I didn't see the same level of substance hidden beneath the violence in stuff like 'Cops Vs. Thugs' or 'Lone Wolf and Cub' (hee hee presuming those had it). But I suppose this isn't entirely bad, since Tarantino has carved out a niche that is entirely his own: B-movie camp with an A-list production and hollow, hip dialog -- as well as the freedom to do whatever he wants with his artistic vision.",6,0,3,17 July 2008
The Dark Knight," A solid, exciting, chilling experience that needs some work with pacing
","This film is a significant step up from 'Batman Begins' as a captivating and exciting film in the franchise. The main reason this one is more intense than the previous film is because it establishes villains who are even more interesting than Batman. Here The Joker is disturbing as all hell, more so considering he was something channeled by Heath Ledger, who killed himself soon after filming finished. The Joker comes from nowhere, cares for nothing but his own brand of sadomasochistic chaos, and laughs with delight at every ugly moment of Batman's troubled quest for personal meaning. Thus, the best moments of the film are obviously the interactions between Batman and The Joker, scenes where Ledger steals the screen time. At this point I would safely conclude that no actor has ever been successfully cast as Batman/Bruce Wayne, and Christian Bale is no different. He's certainly one of the best ones, but as Bruce Wayne -- as this rich, handsome, playboy with the pointy chin (didn't Batman traditionally have a Kennedy-ish jowel-line?) -- he comes across as kind of unlikable. His role also is too dry and pales in comparison to Ledger's. This is a problem in this Batman movie: the most likable character is The Joker, who signals death and destruction for no reason other than self-amusement. But perhaps 'likable' isn't the proper description. The Joker isn't likable, but chilling and captivating. This is how one feels throughout the film and especially when Ledger is on the screen.The thing is, this would have been a masterpiece of action/horror had there been more careful casting and better pacing. The presence of Maggie Gyllenhaal, while superior to Katie Holmes, still leaves much to be desired. Aaron Eckhart is okay, but they did not develop his character as well as they should have. I attribute that to the writing, but he came off a little one-dimensional as Harvey Dent: too pristine to be believable in a world of villains! But aside from that, I am convinced at this point that director Christopher Nolan does not know how to pace a film. The action is still jerky, there are far too many abrupt cuts during the action, and there is a considerable lack of drawn-out panning shots. Although this Batman film is far more exciting, disturbing, captivating and scary than the two Tim Burton Batman films with Michael Keaton, those films had a better directorial sense for the pacing, characters and cinematography. As films they may be the better ones overall for those reasons alone.Still, it's the most exciting movie to have come out of Hollywood in a long, long time and probably the best one to see in the theaters in a long time too. It's worth the money if only for Ledger's frightening performance, the masterfully subtle presence of Gary Oldman, the new gadgets and the incredibly intense action sequences. The choppiness, grim aura and plethora of explosions means it probably won't appeal as much to the middle-age to senior audiences, but younger crowds will be (and are being) mesmerized.",8,2,7,6 August 2008
Inside Man," Spike Lee Phone Home
","This is 'a Spike Lee joint' that feels like a Hollywood film he was contractually obliged to make. The setup is interesting and the first third is pretty exciting, but the movie slows down and starts to putter around, prematurely revealing its conclusions. It includes a couple of twists, investigates potential Stockholm Syndrome, political corruption and war crimes, but ultimately fails in its predictability (and the fact that my own imagined outcomes were more entertaining that what transpired on the screen).It's not really a bad movie. It's just not nearly as substantial as people say it is. Denzel Washington and Jodie Foster are on autopilot the whole time, Willem Defoe is hardly even used, there are blatant product placements for the PSP and the iPod, the 'twist' to the robbery can be seen from a mile away, and Spike Lee's questionable morality jibe in the finale seems like a sensationalist afterthought. The morality tale came off as lazy and seemed indicative of weird subconscious prejudices Spike Lee has.In short, the set up is pretty decent and the rest of the movie is professional and slightly above-average. The plot is ultimately typical bank heist fare, though presented with the intent of being a crime mystery/thriller. But a few offensive jokes/products/themes, phoned-in performances, and predictable characters keep it from being necessary viewing.",5,1,3,17 September 2008
The Fountain," Aronofsky is such a funny guy
","I'll give this two stars for the beautiful set and the fact that there was actual effort involved, and one star for the fact that it is unique in presentation. However, this is one of the most unwatchable things I've ever seen.'Daronofsky' has a pretty poor track record at this point. His first flick, 'Pi', seemed watchable when I was a young, easily influenced, angsty teenager. Looking back on it today, even that film does not hold up so well, as Aronofsky movies parade style over substance while being totally oblivious to the fact. The next flick he did, 'Requiem For a Dream' (featuring Jennifer Connelly, yowza!) was the most glorified, pretentious movie about drug addiction put to film. I always knew drugs were bad (eh heh heh...) but I never knew they could be so stylish! His film editing in his first two films is like MTV-meets-Tarantino except without the 'Gilmore Girls'-on-steroids writing found in the latter. On the surface, his movies appear to be about profound things (Kabbalistic math, drug addiction, death and spirituality, Jennifer Connelly) but then you realize that he has nothing to say on these subjects. He just keeps flashing subject-related images with minimal, cryptic dialog and melancholic or ominous music. What sorcery! Which brings us to 'The Fountain' a film purportedly abandoned by production companies and so forth because they thought it was too risky. I think their assessment was still rather generous. I think it's just plain bad. Here, for the third time, Aronofsky has proved himself to be an exclusively aesthetic director. It's strange -- Aronofsky doesn't seem to understand that people have covered the same tragic/epic themes in better movies that also contained developed plots and characters. Someone here argued that the main characters are archetypes of the human experience. Whatever. I would say the same thing about the characters in Takashi Miike's 'Izo' (also unwatchable but much more complete in its grasp) or 'Children of Paradise', a film in which the characters manage to be simultaneously ridiculous, endearing and exaggerated and yet totally human. Children of Paradise is a masterful meditation on love and, unlike this one, has a sense of HUMOR. Considering the lack of jokes in his movies, I am convinced that Aronofsky is not only unprofound, but also a spiritual STATUE.An example of the ridiculous pomp in this film: for some reason, Hugh Jackman randomly does Yoga and Taijiquan (Tai Chi) for brief segments. What relevance does this have to the grand human experience? Seriously, what of it? This is only relevant to people (like Aronofsky) who don't actually know anything about Yoga or Tai Chi. People who actually practice these things wouldn't advertise them as the pinnacle of human achievement in a movie about love.'The Fountain' wants to be profound so very badly and yet just reeks of New Age yuppie pretense. You can critique anything and commend its artistic credibility and symbolism because: hind-sight is always 20-20! If you really thought this was deep, you just might be a New-Age yuppie. It's basically up there with 'Mindwalk', 'What the &($% Do We Know?' and any of the aforementioned films Aronofsky has done.Proof that Aronofsky is no great writing/directing talent? He has no sense of humor. He should direct other scripts and stories. Then he might have something.",3,6,12,6 July 2008
Mystic River," It's no Unforgiven, I tell you what
","It's a good movie, but it's no masterpiece. Clint Eastwood's movies are all so distinctly grim and devoid of humor. I wonder what his deal is? This is where the movie seems unrealistic to me, when it ceases to ever break the constant tension.I also didn't buy some of the character portraits, like Kevin Bacon's rocky marriage or Tim Robbins' tumultuous past. Some of these things were a little TOO convenient for the sake of the plot advancement. In other words, I could break apart the mechanics of the plot and see where it was pieced together. The performances are all very good. I guess it's nice to see Kevin Bacon in a major role again and Tim Robbins and Sean Penn are surprisingly capable here. It's funny because the way people are socially interwoven across generations in this movie reminded me of that crappy movie Sleepers (also with Kevin Bacon).This is a solid film, but it doesn't blow your mind or anything. A few jokes to replace the smart-alecky cop dialog every now and then wouldn't hurt. Incidentally, while it is interesting in theory, I was unimpressed by Clint Eastwood's efforts at musical scoring. The soundtrack lacked any real punch.A good effort, but Clint's recent films have not affected me very much because they're so serious and grim. They seem almost unrealistic.7.5",8,0,1,7 July 2008
There Will Be Blood," There Will Be Money
","What a crazy, creepy, memorable film experience! Daniel Day-Lewis, building on the role he played in 'Gangs of New York', is the scariest dude this side of the corporate machine! I don't know if this film is even giving a scathing criticism of oil or capitalism. Maybe it's just providing a super-exaggerated (or ultra-concentrated) archetype of the insane colonial-capitalist quest for power and wealth (in this case symbolized by oil). 'Coz what better symbolizes greed than the story of a hell-bent oil-man? Nuttin' else, that's what.Music is pretty good, by one of the dudes from Radiohead. So all you hipsters should be wetting your pants at the thought of the soundtrack. The music is pretty caustic and frenetic all throughout, very intense and consuming. Additionally, the font used on the film's box and poster art is totally metal, so all you metalheads should find something attractive as well! Very nice aesthetic choices all around.This film is like, 2.5 hours or something, but it never lets up. It is non-stop, smooth-flowing horror the whole way through. Not horror in the blatant, gory way. Horror as in, you are absolutely captivated in the built-up fear that the characters revel in. And there's hardly a likable one among them. And yet, they're all completely mesmerizing.8.5",9,2,4,23 June 2008
The Silence of the Lambs," Human cuisine could be more delicious
","I'm not downgrading 'Silence of the Lambs' for failing to live up to its hype, for no movie could deliver on the amount of praise this one has received. I think it is an entertaining film, but it is hardly realistic and breaks down in several clumsy scenes, ones which were excessively convenient moments to advance the plot.The movie functions as a capable FBI thriller (yet is still not quite as engrossing as something like 'L.A. Confidential'). What is engrossing about this film is kind of cheap: the fact that it is about a couple of very disgusting serial killers. These kinds of characters are absolute tabloid gold-mines. No wonder people are so mesmerized by this movie: it's a decent thriller that revolves around gruesome murders.I give Hopkins credit for doing a good acting performance, but the character of Hannibal Lecter, PhD, is too over-the-top to be convincing. I get it -- he's a genius and a sociopath. He's a classier version of Maguyver (so classy he even appreciates piano sonatas!) who has no empathy but loves riddles and tooling people around. Entertaining but not entirely convincing. Really brilliant killers don't wear their gifts on their sleeve.As I said, there were a few moments with supporting characters doing stupid, clumsy, unrealistic things to advance the plot. For one thing, nobody does their job clumsily when guarding super-brilliant cannibal serial killers. Sorry. And methodical serial killers (as deranged as they may be) are not clumsy when it comes to tracking someone in their own lair.The movie is entertaining and paces well. It is certainly engrossing, but the violence does seem over-the-top and unnecessary. Without the obscene gore factor, this movie would not be nearly as famous as it is, so it strikes me as a gimmick. The gore never carried any emotional resonance or impact on the storyline. It was at times almost comical for the way it suddenly shifted the tempo of the movie.I will say I did like the Appalachian, rust-belt, mining-town motif that was prevalent throughout the movie and tied Jodie Foster's character, Clarice, to the story. The contrast between Clarice, the victims of the killer Buffalo Bill, and the seasoned murderer, Lecter, was pretty decent. And Jodie Foster was pretty good, she's always been a capable actress.But let's face it: the kind of cinematic thrills the mainstream movie-going public desires cannot deliver realistic portrayals of sociopathic killers. I mean, 'No Country For Old Men' is a little closer to the mark here, and at the center I'm thinking along the lines of 'Henry' or the more humane and psychologically driven Fritz Lang classic, 'M'. Unfortunately, most movies about serial killers are all glossed up with shiny production and sensationalized fictitious qualities to the extent that they make these characters look glorious. (Even 'No Country' did that a little bit) The whole movie felt kinda like a Tom Clancy thriller, but with a couple of twisted serial killers as the focal point. But it was an archetype for both '90s films and serial killer films. So many movies copied this one in the '90s in pacing, aesthetic and so on. Pretty much every movie about some genius murderer is a take on this one.It's mainly worth watching for Anthony Hopkins. There are (unfortunately?) some laugh-out-loud moments but he's not on-screen for most of the film. Still, I didn't find the gore in this to be as convincingly disturbing as most new episodes of South Park. This was just grimier and less funny.",6,1,4,29 July 2008
Blade Runner," Hey, guess what movie rules?
","Movie has killer music, cinematography and scenery, mystique, characters whom develop without dialog and a really moving melancholic feel. There's almost no speaking in this movie, and some plot elements are simply inferred, leaving a lot open to interpretation.The real star here is Rutger Hauer, if you ask me. Guy plays a top-dog replicant. Harrison Ford is a pretty poor actor, and he's thankfully reduced to nothing but a handsome mug here. Sean Young and Daryl Hannah both have it going' on in this one too! This is a piece of film too sophisticated for the likes of Hollywood (or maybe just our current stagnant period of culture). The music by Vangelis carries the film and the romance of the imagery and environment here is super rad. Plus, it asks a lot of important existential questions in the wake of AI and cybernetic implants and cloning and other technological developments, all without sounding preachy or pretentious.Amazing that Ridley Scott made this and 'Alien' and then went on to make nastiness like '1492: CoP' and 'Gladiator'. Oh well.",8,1,2,27 May 2008
V for Vendetta," A 'Testament of Dr. Mabuse' for the new millennium
","'V For Vendetta' is a film 'The Dark Knight' could have been -- almost the other side of the same coin. It is marked by a similarly dark protagonist with a more impressive (and dangerous) sense of justice, yet he is an endearing and likable character to the end. Thus it is a true superhero film, for despite its deadpan serious tone, it also retains a variety of comic elements that make the characters and plot deeply engaging to the viewer. The setting is a totalitarian England of the near future, just after the collapse of the USA and their fumbled invasion in the Middle-East. England is now led by evangelical fascists who do not allow homosexuality, artistic expression, freedom of speech, late-night social activity, and all other kinds of 'luxuries.' The party henchmen all unquestioningly serve a crazed talking head played by John Hurt, who dictates to them through a giant television screen in an obvious reference to the movie adaptation of George Orwell's '1984'. In the midst of this unpleasant society lives Evey (Natalie Portman), a young woman who works a dead-end job as an assistant in one of the main propaganda TV news studios. The protagonist, freedom fighter 'V' (Hugo Weaving), accosts her in the streets one night (in typical superhero fashion) and takes their chance meeting to be more than just chance (he doesn't believe in coincidences, as everyone in the film eventually learns). What makes 'V for Vendetta' so intoxicating is the way it piles on the horrifying government indictments and heavy-handed polemics in obvious reference to the modern anti-terrorist party-line of the US/UK governments. But the main character repeatedly drives into our brains throughout the film, that as literal as these critiques may be, they (and the movie's entire story) exist merely as symbols, as ideas, which have no original form but continually reappear in contrast to control schemes. So to take everything involved here completely literally would be like taking the Matrix to be the actual hidden reality beneath our day-to-day lives.But then again, somewhat admirably and dangerously, as they did with 'The Matrix', here the Wachowski brothers have unveiled their own eccentric, courageous line of thinking -- one which is uncommonly seen delivered in Hollywood with such 'chutzpah' -- especially nowadays. V brings back some of the best elements of 'The Testament of Dr. Mabuse', 'Twelve Monkeys', 'Batman', '1984', and 'Brazil', and it's a welcome return in lieu of the stagnant soft-fascism of modern mass-consumer-product-ridden film culture. The film is not without its quirky flaws. By the end of the film, the villains are not quite as loathsome and sinister as they initially appeared to be; their dimensions are stretched a little thin over the 2+ hour movie. And for as much as V references 'Hamlet' and 'The Count of Monte Cristo' throughout the film, his tale of vengeance is never quite as fully resonant as anything in these aforementioned works. Additionally, there are some pacing problems about 2/3 of the way through the film, where the story is forced to go through a few montages to speed it up and actually conclude.But still, even if you think the blatant (almost insane) political tirades are ridiculous, cheesy, inauthentic, exaggerated or offensive, the movie is well-made with some quality perks. The protagonist V has some awesome (sometimes hysterical) lines, and there are a couple of good twists to the film's story. V's first appearance and lines early on are some of the best in the film and Hugo Weaving gives an incredibly enjoyable performance using an endearing method of dead-pan delivery and expressive, jerky body language. And watch for the fight scene where the film pokes fun at the choreography and special effects from 'The Matrix' (the director here was the Assistant Director for The Matrix series).Although the movie is by no means perfect, and certainly unrealistic and at times illogical, it is a fantastic action/suspense film and evokes 'The Matrix' and 'The Dark Knight' with its cohesive and immersing plot, likable protagonist, endearing performances and insanely bold message. The worst thing you could say is that it's unique, which is certainly no insult in today's movie market.",7,1,4,19 September 2008
Talladega Nights: The Ballad of Ricky Bobby," Get out of my brain, Will Ferrel!
","I have a hard time watching modern Hollywood comedies because they have no idea how to establish characters. Most modern Hollywood comedies and Will Ferrel movies feature ridiculous, unrealistic and unlikable characters. 'The 40-Year Old Virgin' was a bit more successful because the main characters were either likable or believable, even if the movie was paced poorly. But Ricky Bobby is forgettable, unlikable and full of drawn-out (improvised?) scenes which are often stupid and a chore to sit through.I don't think the movie's material is necessarily awful or the people involved are unfunny. It just isn't good enough for a feature-length movie. With a film made of this material, stretching it so thin over 90 minutes, there is nothing to hide the wheels of the corporate machine pushing it through the factory press.On the surface, the film appears to be making fun of NASCAR, but it also seems to be a tribute to that unbelievably popular past-time. There are no real jokes at the expense of NASCAR fans. And the success of the movie is probably because it is aimed at the NASCAR demographic. Most of the jokes are dirty and there are a lot of jokes about the implied homosexuality of the film's arch-rival, a French race-car driver played by Sacha Baron Cohen. Sacha Baron Cohen is (to me) a lot more fun than usual here, perhaps because his schtick only lasts for a few scenes in the movie.Will Ferrel is a pretty successful actor, to be sure. The number of cameos and leads he's done over the last decade is enormous. It surprises me, because while he's a funny and goofy guy, his range and depth and physical ability are not particularly deep. Yet he's much more interesting doing other roles. And with so much money, I don't know why he keeps doing movies like this. The more he makes like this, the more forgettable he makes himself.",3,0,0,28 June 2008
