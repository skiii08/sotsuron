Minority Report," Didn't impress me... much.
","I saw this movie with my friends this summer, and when we got out of theater, we all thought that it was a waste of money, the trailers promised so much more than the audience got. But somehow, it had parts which were very interesting, like you cannot rely everything on machines, humans have the possibility to choose their own destiny.Tom Cruise was actually quite good in this movie, maybe one of his greatest roles ever(?)I can't really say exactly what I didn't liked about this movie, but maybe it was the plot or the atmosphere, I don't know. The plot was both original and not so original, you have seen most of the things before, but the whole thing about getting arrested before you commit a crime was new to me. And I can't say I'd like a system like that in the future, what would happen if someone was wrongfully accused etc.?Oh well, some people say they liked this movie, I'd say that you shouldn't just watch the trailers before you see this movie, it's actually nothing really new, but still it's quite interesting to see how Mr. Cruise does his role.Rating: 06/10",7,0,0,1 November 2002
WALLÂ·E," Not as good as everyone claims it to be
","Since all hype and good critic around Wall-E, I thought it was time to see this Pixar/Disney movie. Said and done, I watched it the other night, and the first 10 minutes were pretty good, Wall-E and Eva are lovable characters, no doubt about it. But after that, it went downhill to become just okay, the 'supporting' characters in Wall-E are just so boring and don't have any personality at all, they aren't likable at all really. And the idea of having the main characters only, communicating with each other by their names and body language didn't make my day at least. No, this certainly wasn't as great as the IMDb users wanted it to be. It's definitely not worth an imdbtop250 place, that's for sure. However, it's an okay/good movie and you'll definitely laugh at Wall-E's wonders, but as for the script goes, I found it to be rather weak.",6,4,10,3 November 2008
