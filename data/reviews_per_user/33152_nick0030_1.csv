Pirates of the Caribbean: On Stranger Tides," Not what i expected
","I am kinda fan of POTC and can't really come to terms with this part. Not that this part was bad but it doesn't quite live up to the standards set by the previous movies. The fourth movie plus 3D factor set me to expect more. 3D effects were good and our favourite CAPTAIN Jack Sparrow is at his best. But this can't make up for otherwise slow story and weak characters. Their was not as much fun and enjoyment as could have been. Also, their is a confusion regarding the nature of characters which is most of the time self-contradictory. One can simply sense that something is missing. Plus, the movie keeps on moving away from the main plot. Disappointed yes but still it was a good time pass. Totally a one time watch.",6,0,0,21 May 2011
