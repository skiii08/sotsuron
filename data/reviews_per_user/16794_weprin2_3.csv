Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," Star Wars Episode I, The Force is Definitely With It!!!!
","After seeing the first 3 Star Wars Movies, I was more than impressed with this one! This film and it's story has a lot of action and plot! Who the hell cares what anybody else says, They don't know squat! Movie Goers nowadays don't even follow Star Wars at all! I think this film should have received several Oscars. It doesn't matter to me how different this movie is, Star Wars is Star Wars period. Enjoy it for what it is. This movie is a brilliant beginning! No doubt! If you don't like this movie then you don't like Star Wars. The Space Battle scenes were cool as well as everything else! What more do movie fans want? Didn't they even see the pod racing at all? That was awesome just as well! If you ask me, I think Jar Jar was a riot! The force is definitely with you George Lucas! Keep up the good work. We Star Wars fans owe it all to you. He is the master mind of Star Wars! Movie fans should not be judging this particular movie at all. It just isn't right.",10,11,15,29 July 2005
Star Wars: Episode II - Attack of the Clones," The Clone Wars Has Begun
","The force keeps getting better again and again. Movie goers just don't see the action in this movie, It has everything a true Star Wars fan can ever hope for! Even though I thought Episode I Was cool, this one is even better! We finally get to see R2 & 3PO get together. This truly goes in the Star Wars Category. Lucas has done it again! This is one of the greatest Star Wars Prequels to date. People shouldn't misjudge this film, They don't know whats good even if it jumped up and bit them! All they care about nowadays is mindless action flicks. Lucas is a genius when it comes to making the second Star Wars Trilogy. Star Wars Episode II Rules! I was more than impressed with this one, This movie has everything, Even for us Star Wars geeks and I'm proud of it! Only people who are not true Star Wars fans trash this movie. Who cares! Episode II deserves a lot more.",10,5,9,31 August 2005
Star Wars: Episode III - Revenge of the Sith," The Force Keeps Getting Better and Better!
","This is the best of the best! Nothing keeps getting better than George's exiting space opera. Star Wars Episode III is an excellent film. After the original trilogy, The Special Edition and Episodes I & II, This is the final chapter that has all the answers and everything else. It's the most enjoyable. Who cares what other movie goers like! American movie goers nowadays are very shallow if you ask me! I'm true Star Wars fan and I say it's excellent, Period! I just hope that two years from now that Lucas will celebrate the Star Wars 30th anniversary, And if so I'm hoping that Lucas would rerelease the original Star Wars trilogy on the big screens in special edition form again,or maybe he'll do it twelve years from now, Cause that would be awesome if he could do it one more time! Who knows? Anything's possible in the future.",10,5,10,18 August 2005
