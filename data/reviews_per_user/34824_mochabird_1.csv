The Ring," ok, wait.
","who can possibly say that this movie was bad?! you can say you didn't like it...that's ok. you can say it didn't scare you...i wouldn't believe you, but it would be ok. but to say that its BAD indicates that those of us who found it very entertaining are somehow wrong. lets just say i love horror movies. i have never not seen a movie because i thought it would be too scary. i have also never been THAT scared by a movie...till now. this movie caused me to stop breathing. im not kidding. please, if you are a horror movie fan and can handle scariness go see this movie and judge it for yourself. don't let any of the bad reviews stop you--because if i had, i wouldn't be sitting here in total shock and amazement right now.",10,0,0,18 October 2002
