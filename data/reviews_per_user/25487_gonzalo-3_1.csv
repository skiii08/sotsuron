The Blair Witch Project," I can't believe I paid for it
","I hear about 'the project' when I was in NYC and I thought I could enjoy a real horror movie. I'm afraid I can't say I enjoyed it at all since I didn't feel that fear I was looking for for one minute along the whole film. Moreover, I got so bored that the only thing I waited for was the end of the movie. Although I must accept that the idea was quite good and that the film did had the chance to become one of the most terrific ones in cinema history, to my opinion it hasn't reached its objective. The cause of my complaint is that I was promised fear and I couldn't find it in any moment. All I found was shouting and horror-like situations but actually there was no sequence that could justify the exaggerated publicity this film has got.",1,2,4,18 September 1999
