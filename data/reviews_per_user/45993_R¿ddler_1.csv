Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," Stunning movie, worth watching it...
","The Phantom Menace is a fun movie to watch, one of my all time top 5. Remember all, that this is a setup movie for the remaining 2 of the prequels trilogy.Still a good movie, with a nice story to begin the saga.  The Special effects are awesome, nice actors for the main characters. Liam Neeson and Natalie Portman were great in their roles.I liked the planets... Naboo, Tatooine and Coruscant looks fantastic and very real. The GunGans home, the city underwater was great and magical.Ok, Darth Maul was not a very decent villain, but he was still an apprentice and of course, he can't beat Darth Vader. The Siths were gone for millenniums and they were just back, so I expect the next villain to be more powerful.I don't think Jar Jar was that bad, but he could have had a smaller role.As the story ended, I expect an excellent Episode 2... can't hardly wait!",10,0,0,9 July 1999
