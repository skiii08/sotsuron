The Ring," Television sets within television sets- the brilliance explained.
","The brilliant concept of the movie is this...The fear is contained inside a television set within another television set.
It is a movie about a second t.v. within your own that contains a creature that is a girl of silent and demonic fear. And if ever that girl should come through and into the real world so help us....Here is the trick psychology-effect: If the demonic fear is able to transcend the boundaries of one television set, what will prevent it from transcending the second? 'Relax, its just a movie' we tell ourselves- or is it? You can see how it takes that old comfort-saying and rips it to shreds.Rent it on video to recieve the greatest effect- far more than watching it in theaters.Basically, the audience recieves a sense of safety and security by seeing how the source of fear is contained behind a television set and within a video tape. Then we are given this idea that looks can be deceiving when we buy into the chance that the little girl is not evil after all, but is only trying to find a way to rest in peace after death, 'hey! she's harmless!'... or is she? the twist gives us a hard-hitting blow to the head when we discover to our disappointment that this demonic evil has the ability to 'pretend to be nice like the rest of us.' This concept is brand new and fresh, unlike any horror film I have ever seen, and you have I bet.Another brilliant idea is the physical form of the evil itself- it came in those good old fashion electromagnetic waves that has entertained america and the rest of the world for decades. It should really mess up the mind and provoke the semi-intelligent viewer who I doubt would have picked up on these underlying concepts the way I did. But that is the intention which is too obvious to be recognized and the brilliance behind the movie.That is all I have to say for this.",Null,0,1,11 September 2003
Unbreakable," Unbreakable Is Like The Matrix Without The Far-fetchedness
","In a few ways this movie is reminiscent of The Matrix. Where David (Bruce Willis) discovers his 'potential' through Elijah (Samuel L. Jackson), similar to Neo and Morpheus. It likens us to the possibility that a 'sane man in an insane world' could be an 'insane man in a sane world' and vice versa.The story is about David, an ex-football star turned security guard with a wife and son who makes regular pay and wakes up every morning with an empty feeling. Elijah acknowledges this empty feeling to David as a sadness and then proceeds to tell him, '...maybe its because you are not doing what you are supposed to be doing.' David feels burdened by Elijah's theories as evident in not only his skepticism, but as well, his downright defensiveness. Gradually, he begins to accept them however.By the time David comes to his realization, he rekindles the broken contact between him and Elijah, and, as you might guess, comes to understand what he must do. The movie now takes a turn in a very different direction, when David, as a regular man with a genetic edge discovered only by Elijah, must now conquer his doubts and fears over Elijah's theories and any concern he might have over whether or not his actions undermine his sanity, to enter what the audience has all been waiting for to see, superhero territory. Remember, this is the same guy who eats french toast for breakfast with a glass of Tropicana.The movie basically centers around Elijah's theory, which is about the closest link between the superhero world of comic books and ours. We see the burdens David faces when he has to reconcile everything he knows about his basis in real life with that of Batman, Superman, Spiderman and other gods from the pages of panel-by-panel mythology. It makes us wonder about the possibility and explores the brightest and darkest aspects of the human psyche. This 'crossing over' aspect I found very reminiscent of The Matrix but without the farfetchedness. Which is what drives this movie much more closer to home than The Matrix could ever be.The movie ends on a note that leaves us to imagine the future to come. We are forced to question what we believe to be good and evil.",9,1,1,4 April 2006
The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring," A Geek Flick.
","This boring, childish display of another Medieval Times Dinner and Theater type of thing could not answer my question as to why so many people made it sound bigger than it really is. I thought that what it actually is, is nothing more than an artistic collaboration and effort to faithfully bring book to screen, but certainly far from, 'The best movie of the year,' it was certainly original in presentation and directing. But I still cannot for the life of me shake this impression of it being a Geek Flick. I'll give it a 3 out of 5 stars if someone asked me to. What really makes me want to divert from stepping foot into a theater to see this and that other waste-of-time Harry Potter, is witnessing the way adults go around parading themselves on trains and buses with those colorful novels and celebrating their 'return to childish innocence' which I call the 'return to childish freedom to be and do whatever one feels so as to convince oneself that the world is safer than the one they've known lately as adults'-a fantasy to bury themselves in, I think it is only appealing to those adults who haven't been getting any bedroom action. I am reminded of Comicbook Guy on the Simpsons, so is there a little bit of him in every adult? Not me, and not any other respectable adult. But unlike that visually beautiful filth known as Harry Potter, The Lord of the Rings doesn't try too hard, the plot (although cliche) is a representation of human/dwarf struggle at its very roots. Its about working together with our strengths combined by friendship in order to face the deadly unknown, being straight from the depths of the imagination are creatures of strange and clumsy form who may or may not threaten us. In that way I guess the movie brings people together by the common act of being human (I had not however noticed any diversity in the banding of the merry men). But I assume that anyone who knows what a real struggle is like knows that this is fantastic filth/garbage. A movie like this only appeals to those of us who are sheltered, suburbanites or are urban individuals caught in an urban struggle and want to escape through some loser's imagination (I forget the loser's name, nor would I ever care to have it). That is the whole movie right there, nothing more, nothing less, overall its a movie, that's right a movie, not a way of life.That is all I have to say for this.",Null,0,1,22 September 2003
Batman Begins," The Essence of the Batman Creation
","Bruce Wayne is the only one true human superhero.The reason for his triumphs as Batman are primarily due to his personal tragedy at the loss of his parents to a criminal, following the crucial decision to prevent such tragedies while faced with nothing else.During his self-destructive phase, Bruce Wayne sought training in the martial arts schools that could not be found in western civilization. By the age of twenty two, he acquired enough skill to take on six men at once. As Batman, he would later become the victor of nearly every battle with humans and non-humans alike, wherein, his own all-too-human flesh and blood vessel inevitably brushes death many times, saved mostly in part to his intellect and sagacity, as well as the care of a precious few. His much-too-close experience with victimization as a child, following the personal pain of his loss, has led him to make analytical observations and studies of the criminal element, thusly granting him the utmost awareness of their world. This is what primarily sets him apart from government officials and law-enforcement agents. It must be said that although he operates outside the bounds of the law, he remains within reason, which makes him different from the usual vigilante out for revenge. Hence, in his beginning years as the Batman, he is misunderstood by the law, which later becomes rectified through his friendship and trust in commissioner Gordon as well as his reputable actions. One of his greatest principles is that he will never take a life unless absolutely necessary or to save his own.An atypical missionary, Bruce Wayne's initiation of the Batman identity was for detective work above all else. At first, he lived to save the city he has always known and to honor the names of his late parents. In the later years of his career, he lives to fight injustice more so than ever. This brought him to assist in the fights alongside real superhumans (with a diverse array of superhuman genetic resources as opposed to simply being a physically healthy, financially wealthy pretty boy with a post dramatic stress disorder) when called to. But the near victimization he experienced as a child and other survivals of smaller life-threatening proportions are the primary motives of what he fights against today as it is written in the books. It can be said that the powers of this particular 'superhero' comes from within and manifests themselves physically and mentally.Batman Begins is the only comic book adaptation that has captured the essence of the origins of Batman.",10,0,1,3 July 2005
Good Will Hunting," Here I have explained the underlying ideas behind the movie (SPOILERS).
","This movie, like many others, has one or two characteristics that are quite questionable, but at the same time understandable. One of which is the possible impression that Hollywood intended to sell themselves to the general audience by taking the idea of a genius who does the unbelievable act of being cool... 'Oh my, look at that! He's just as smart as Steve Urkel (another fictional genius) but he is like, so cool.' If that was your take on the movie why should it be? This is where you went wrong, you compared Will Hunting to some stereotypical view of the genius. Does Will Hunting set a good example? Definitely not! He is a gigantic loser, but the message behind the movie is simple: 'No matter who you are or how intelligent, we always need to look to our fellow human beings (i.e. each other) for wisdom and guidance.' The movie is incredibly accurate in demonstrating how it is very possible for a genius of any caliber to lack wisdom. The movie is also heart-warming and easily delivers bundles of 'goodness'. Look at the way the movie concludes itself... with Robin Williams reading Will's letter saying,'Dear Shawn,If the professor calls about that job,tell him sorry,I had to go see about a girl,Will.'Shawn looks up again, 'Son of a bitch... he stole my line...'Scene changes to an empty highway with a beat-up old car driving on and on, inside steers Will, one of the greatest geniuses the world has ever seen, and although he has not quite gotten anywhere great in life, all the helping hands and friendships paid off, and there he is on his way to something better...The genius is the closest any human being can get to determining actions and decisions almost always without flaw, this movie united the genius with the unfortunate human beings you might see on the sidewalk when you take a stroll downtown.You can see how during the middle, before the climax of Will losing his ability to keep things inside, that one by one he loses those people who are his world and yet one by one, he shrugs off any care he has for each loss. First, Skylar, then, the Professor, then Chuckie (not really loses) who tells him basically, 'I don't really want you to be around...' this comes as a shock to Will, since he always though that if he loses someone new in his life, like Skylar, he can always fall back on his best friend...and then finally Shawn, who gives Will the idea that he had enough of his 'shit' because Will spoke to Shawn with very little respect after everyone else who was important dropped from his life as if like flies. 'Look at me Shawn, what the hell is the point? I lost everyone important to me, all of our sessions were a waste anyway, I might as well show you that I'm nobody you should be trying to help, so I'll test you to...'I think my explanation in the 'A Beautiful Mind' forum would help you understand what makes one genius behave a certain way, and another almost the complete opposite. I mean Will Hunting is on the opposite end of the personality pole to John Nash (a non-fictional genius) and Steve Urkel.",Null,1,3,13 September 2003
A Beautiful Mind," I love how it goes beyond the ordinary audience.
","I don't really watch movies often unless it relates to me or is 'beyond me' and this is almost never, but here is a movie that relates to me in almost every way, with a few good curiousities that are a bit beyond me and thus far beyond the mentally-ordinary audience. Its movies like this which opens public exchange forums up like this to gifted individuals and mathematical thinkers alike (usually one in the same), with a thing or two to say about these types of movies that are watched by all and only related to by few. I myself am a 'typical genius' according to the definition used by Hans Eysneck in his book, 'Genius', vis: he '...concludes that the typical genius has an IQ some three to four standard deviations above the mean.' There are two key elements that are significant in the material binding of the movie-to- audience via sight-to-sound processes: 1) the movie educates the general audience by demonstrating the vast differences between the ordinary man and the genius- Hollywood style, of course. Which is exactly the opposite to 'Good Will Hunting' a few years back that tends to trick the audience but in truth Will Hunting is an astoundingly deceptive genius. If he were not a janitor he would have shown his personality to have been more 'genius-like'. But obviously he is working an angle throughout the movie in order to keep his ordinary friends who he has nothing in common with except friendship and baseball- he is a complete mystery to the audience which is exactly the intended effect. Whereas, the intended effect of, 'A Beautiful Mind' gives the audience complete knowledge of the inner-workings of this particular (super) genius by giving them the impression of, 'He is beyond me...' using special effects and the like. It was assumed in some website by some psychologist, that the fictional character we know and love as Will Hunting, displays characteristics of someone with an IQ of around 190, a lot like Freidrich Gauss, 'The prince of mathematicians'. If I were to make an educated guess on John Nash's IQ I would say it is around 180. Einstein's was 160, surprisingly to many he was too a 'typical genius'. 2) The music of 'A Beautiful Mind' gives the audience musical insight into the inner-workings of John Nash- into his mind, heart and spirit. I do not wish to explain the movement of the music but the movement of the audience as it is much less complex and  appropiate for here: Basically, especially in the starting, various sound movements begin and gradually come into each other all at once, providing a parade of sound coming from all directions at once and into each audience member's ear. In short: it'll blow your mind man!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! Those on this list who claim to dislike the movie are insecure about the things they like and so deny it when they think that no one else should admit themselves to liking it. Why? Because although there are 'boring' details around the middle that get into the negative human aspects of the man behind the genius (as there is always one), then one who claims that the movie sucks is sayin that 'there is no man behind the genius' and thus are either, dumb (an understatement), or in denial of being let down after finding out that the genius can not only be a 'superman' but also human like themselves. Look at Sir Isaac Newton, a genius's genius who had a breakdown in middle age. That is all I have to say for this,",Null,0,1,8 September 2003
