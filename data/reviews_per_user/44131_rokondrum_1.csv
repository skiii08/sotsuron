First Man," So, so, so bad
","Personally, I expected much more from this movie. Doesn't matter that I don't like RG, this movie should represent victory of USA (I am not US citizen), and victory of whole World because this was huge thing in our history.
I know this isn't 90's movie such as Apollo 13, but this shouldn't be this much dark. Each person have some tragedy in their life, and we can all sympathies with Neil, but this is way too much. There is nothing emotional in this movie, no other emotion then Depression. We all know than many lives were lost during Gemini and Apollo program and this should be celebration for them as well.
I was bored most of the time and fell asleep twice.
The scene that made me angry was when he meets his wife upon return. She was angry when he left, and she was happy while she was leaving house to meet him again, but when they saw each other, there was no emotions at all. He was gone for several days, not years.
You are not gonna learn anything while watching this movie. They put two space programs in 2 hour movie. They wonted o cover everything but with this movie they didn't cover anything. I am disappointed and I wouldn't recommend tthis movie to anybody.",2,0,1,23 December 2018
