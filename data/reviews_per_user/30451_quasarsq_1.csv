Ford v Ferrari," Perfect !!!
","I watched the movie after knowing that James Mangold had directed it. It is one of those movies where after watching it you don't really feel that it was an 2.5 hr movie.It is difficult to compare it with 'Rush' as the premise is different. Even though the title suggests ' Ford v Ferrari ' but at the core it is really more about Shelby --Miles v Ford Executives.
The movie is able to capture the relation b/n Miles and Shelby as they build a car to race @ Le Mans . As you get to know what Le Mans is you realize the pace of the movie and at the end why is it that you really liked it.The movie is set with mild to Intense racing scenes which can be said as one of the trait of the movie as it doesn't let you on the edge of the seat but rather lets you enjoy sitting back. As to acting with Christian Bale, Matt Damon, Jon Bernthal and other brilliant supporting cast it is what you expect. Even though the screen time is less between Bale and Balfe (Wife ) you will love it.
At the end you will feel satisfied when you come out of the Hall and wish no more with the end and lingering feeling which will stay with you for some time.",9,2,3,19 November 2019
