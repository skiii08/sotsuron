Alien 3," Doesn't live up to its prequels
",When a movie starts by killing the child whose rescue was the main theme of the previous movie then the audience is already disappointed. And then its a downward spiral from there. Its hard to either sympathize or distinguish between the prisoners who are all bald and dressed same way. Its hard to sympathize with Ripley too. The blood thirsty aliens from previous movies are boring in this one. We all know the ritual by now... so no surprises. You can skip this one but Alien and Aliens are both very good!,3,0,2,25 June 2020
