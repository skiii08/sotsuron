The Ring," Tolerable movie, bad ending
","The major problem with the movie (other than the ending) was a lack of focus.  It wandered all over the place, picking up and dropping subplots without resolving them (particularly in relation to the Morgans).  Events occurred inexplicably, only to be forgotten thirty seconds later.The movie's central conceit never made sense - not even in the weird way nightmares make sense.  The final ending (as opposed to the first two endings) felt tacked onto the film for shock value;  it was disconnected from the rest of the movie and a pointless violation of audience expectation.Had they stopped at the first ending, it would have been an acceptable Halloween movie.  As it is, it's a mess.",Null,0,0,27 December 2002
