The Expendables 2," Awesome, Action Packed , Nostalgia Present
","First off id just like to say, this was better than the avengers and was full of blood and gore, second this movie was really good! Its great for people who love 80's action films, and for people who just want to have a good time at the movies, id have to say i loved everything about this movie besides when chuck Norris dies!! Haha just kidding, but overall it had a decent story and van damme was great as the villain. Chuck Norris was great in each scene he was in but he is probably only in the movie for about 5 minutes overall, Arnold seemed a bit rusty,and overused his famous 'ill be back quote.' But overall there are some great action scenes and everybody gets there time to shine. 10/10",10,3,16,17 August 2012
