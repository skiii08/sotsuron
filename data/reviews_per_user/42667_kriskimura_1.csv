Mission: Impossible III," Lies, to be expected but some are just lazy filmaking
","Goofs. Since when did Vatican guards dress like that? Aren't they the Swiss Guard in their traditional outfits of pantaloons and whatnot? another question I've lived in DC, where is that bridge that was blown up, looks more like the one out in San Francisco on the way to Oakland (forget the name) and no not Golden Gate Bridge. other than that, it was a kick-ass movie, the rest of the lies I could handle since they are blatant and outright but stuff like the above just gets to me because its laziness plain and simple, be somewhat accurate in locations. If I'm wrong, fine, but don't let this hold you back. If you want to see an action movie, go see it, if you're looking for a higher purpose and enlightenment. Sorry, this isn't it. But it delivers the action in spades. 7/10 coz of silly mistakes in location",7,1,2,9 May 2006
