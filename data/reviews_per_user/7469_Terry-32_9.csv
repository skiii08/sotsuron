Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," THERE WON'T BE A BETTER MOVIE ALL YEAR!
","I'm glad I saw 'Star Wars.' It's the best movie of 1999 and nothing else will be better. Not even the next nominated moviesat 'Oscar 2000.' To all the hypocrites of the public and movie reviwers who said bad things about this movie:SHUT UP!!!!!!!!!!!!!Sorry, but those people are movie haters and don't know anything about movies. They just go to movies for no reason and act like they're smart. They're not smart. Anyways, 'Episode 1' was great because it's the first chapter of one of the best stories in the world. It explains everything. Everyone was a great actor. I'm angry that people didn't like Anakin or Jar Jar Binks. THey were great. The people who didn't like them don't know what they talk about. Jar Jar was funny. He was like a creature version of Roberto Begnini. He provided great comedy for the movie. I wish people liked him as much as I did. Jake Lloyd was great as Anakin. The way he was, so energetic and ambitious. It's hard to believe that he's Darth Vader in the future. I don't want him to be Darth Vader. He was so innocent. Liam Neeson is one of our best actors in the world. He has never done a bad performance. He was great as Qui-Gon Jin. Ewan McGreggor was also great as Obi-Wan Kenobi. He acted so much like the later one you see in the later episodes. Darth Maul. He was scary. What's interesting about him is that he's a mystery character. You don't know anything about him other than he's a Sith Lord. His one expression appearence is really scary. You don't need to hear him say much because he already is a big part in the movie. Ray Park who played him of course like everyone else was great.Lightsaber fights were excellent. They were extremely intense with the music playing in the background. I was at the edge of my seat. I wouldn't want to be touched by those. The story was great. People can't say it wasn't good. You don't go to this movie to see a story made for you. It's not supposed to be like 'A New Hope.' or 'Empire Strikes Back.' It's immoral to not like this movie. You have to see it and call it EXCELLENT. No less than EXCELLENT. I love movies.",10,1,1,2 June 1999
Armageddon," Great movie, excellent movie.
","This movie was so great. It's another Bruce Willis classic thatneeds to go on the list. (Bruce is my favorite actor.)Armageddon made me care about what the theme was: The world isworth fighting for. This is not a cheap rip-off, or a stupidmovie, or an action flick, and it is NOT about special effectseven though they were fantastic. This movie is about saving theworld. There were great performances all around the cast. Goingback to a part in this review, Armageddon is not about specialeffects, and the other elements are not cheap excuses for that.Armageddon was about its story. Bruce played a man who feltthat he didn't raise his daughter right and didn't want her tomarry a person like him. Will Patton's story was also touchingabout how he's divorced and has a child that doesn't know who heis. Armageddon was a wonderful movie, and people should see it",10,1,1,20 October 1998
Armageddon," EXCELLENT! EXCELLENT! EXCELLENT! DON'T ANY OF YOU GET IT!?
","In school today, my classmates decided to talk bad stuff about this movie and 'Deep Impact.' 'Armageddon' and 'Deep Impact' are two extremely great movies, and nobody gets it. I'm gonna talk about this with 'Deep Impact' too on the other page, so look for that review. My classmates don't appreciate movies. They just get mad at movies, act like they know everything about movies, and continue to see them anyway. Here's what's wrong with them:1. They were in no mood to care about the characters. (I thought they were great! Bruce Willis gives another great performance in his career!. I loved the other cast too.) 2. They are obsessed with realism. They bash all over flames in space, explosions, and screaming, and they don't see how in movies, that you're allowed to do that. Movies were made to help you escape from reality. I wanted to believe there were flames in space, and sound after this movie. 3. They criticize the machineguns. The macineguns were there to shoot at the smaller asteroids. I thought the machineguns were cool. What are they wondering about why they're there for? 4. They make fun of the script, drama, and other meanings in this film. But they mean so much to me. I know I'm not crazy by saying this, because I compared myself with crazy people, and I'm sane. Armageddon was great. You have to see it from my point of view. You can't go and not care about anything. It just showshow insensitive you all are.",10,1,1,30 April 1999
Saving Private Ryan," What else can I say other than how excellent this movie was?
","I really, really, really, thought this was a great movie. Other people do too, but I don't think the ones I know like this movie the right way. My psychiatrist didn't think it held up too well, and my sick friends thought the gut-wretching violence was funny. I am very offended by their views and anybody else's views if they disagree with me. I want to see this movie in theater before I miss my chance. I will never watch this on video. You couldn't pay me. Back to the movie, Steven Spielberg is one of the world's greatest directors. Tom Hanks is also one of the best actors. All the actors were excellent in their roles. I also liked Jeremy Davies. He was a really good character. I think he should have gotten nominated for an Acadamy Award. The direction, every conceivable detail, the wonderful cinematography, the editing, the fact that humor could be fit in to a movie like this, the battle sequences from Omaha Beach to the final one in the destroyed German town, this is just some of the things I can mention. I don't have anything bad to say about this movie. I only have good things to say.",10,0,0,10 March 1999
Reservoir Dogs," GREAT! GREAT! GREAT!
","My uncle told me about this movie before I knew who Quentin Tarantino was. I watched it, and it is a totally different movie from other titles. I've never seen violence, swearing, and adult stuff dealt with in this sort of matter. (I'm 16, so I understand it exists.) After that, I'm now in a position where I think that violence and profanity are VERY essential elements. This movie changed the way I write my own movies. My characters talk like these guys do. And I show violence in the same manner. My movie is an action film entitled 'Hard Job.' Look out for it in the future. All the actors are great! My favorites are Harvey Keitel, Steve Buscemi, Tim Roth, and Michael Madsen. The torture scene, that was so outrageous. I now have a new view towards bad guys. I think all bad guys should be like Mr. Blonde. I liked every part of this movie. (Not when innocent people were killed. I thought those scenes were strong, but that's what happened in the story.) This is one of my personal favorites. I think everybody who can take swearing and violence, and doesn't critisize movies for being 'All talk' should go see this movie. All the people who say this is all talk, SHUT UP!!!Sorry about that. 
Bye!",10,0,1,11 March 1999
Die Hard," Bruce Willis Rules!
","I'm glad that people loved this movie as much as I did. Bruce Willis is my favorite actor. This is obviously a classic. Even though this movie did create more movies like it, I liked them too. (The Rock, Air Force One, Sudden Death, etc.) I don't care that this wasn't a John Woo movie. (Hmm. What would it have been like if he directed.) I still think American Action is cool. Besides Bruce, Alan Rickman is also one of the best villains on film, and I also liked the performances of Bonnie Bedellia, Rejinald Veljohnson, and Alexander Godunov was great as Alan Rickman's vicious henchman. He was scary, and the fight scene with Bruce Willis and him was great. You don't need me to tell you how good this movie was. The other loyal action fans already have",10,0,1,2 June 1999
Speed," Should be listed as another action classic
","'Speed' is another one of the best action movies ever made. It was original, action packed, and Keanu Reeves made himself the next action hero. People shouldn't hate Keanu Reeves. He's cool. Dennis Hopper was a classic villian. He was so cold as the bad guy. He didn't care about anything. He was totally crazy, and he was actually crazy enough to defend his sanity in this movie. The bus sequence was the one of the best action sequences ever filmed. From how it had to make sharp turns, jump, crash through stuff, it was great. Sandra Bullock provided good relief in this movie. She was sweet. I liked the relationship with her and Keanu Reeves. All the other characters were great too. They weren't dull or anything. (I've never seen dull characters though.) They were all comical. Like the elevator people. They had character. Jan De Bont is a great director. He isn't afraid of anything. I want him to do more movies. (I can't wait to see 'Haunting of Hill House.') Add 'Speed' to your action movie list.",10,0,1,6 May 1999
The Matrix," Super action, great story, what else do you need?
","I was waiting so long for this movie to come out. When I saw the preview during the Super Bowl, I knew I had to see this film. Finally on Wedsday, March 31st at 4:00 P.M. right after school, I went straight to the movies, and saw it. It was fantastic. The visual effects were amazing. The actors could do all these amazing moves. Keanu Reeves and Lawrence Fishburn do martial arts in this movie, and they were great at it. I've never seen them do such moves, and I was mesmorized. The story was amazing. Even if I was allowed to, and wanted to, I couldn't explain it. You have to see the movie in order to understand. All the actors and actresses were great. Keanu Reeves especially. I liked him before, but he was great in this movie. It's his 2nd best performance since 'The Devil's Advocate.' I can go on and on about saying how great this movie is, but I'll stop. There is no reason why one shouldn't like this movie. So, See it.",10,0,0,1 April 1999
Heat," This was a great movie.
","I saw this movie with my uncle and his friend. Three hours means nothing to me. What did mean a lot to me was the fact that this movie had a great cast of actors and actresses, the writing, directing, and cinematography was great, and well, yeah. Al Pacino and Robert DiNiro are obviously great actors. I knew this before I saw this movie, and I wanted to see these two guys pair up against each other. I loved the diologue. The way every character talks to each other is so great to hear. Diologue is one of my favorite things in movies. I thought that whole bank heist scene that lead to one of the best gun battles in movie history I just said it. I gave this movie a ten in the voting booth. Don't be surprised to see it changed.",10,0,0,9 March 1999
