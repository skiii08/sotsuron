Catch Me If You Can," Great! If you can handle it
","First time I saw it, I was twelve or thirteen with my boss and co-worker at a volunteering job. I didn't like it at first, but now I enjoy it. Leo Dicaprio plays sixteen year old Frank Abagnale Jr., a son of a French mother and an American father. He loves his parents dearly but can't stand the fact of his parents divorcing. The only thing he can do is run away from it. He imitates a school reporter, a pilot, a doctor, and then a lawyer which eventually gets himself caught with the biggest detectives of the United States. Tom Hanks plays the agent who chases him on the run knowing his true identity while the rest of the world thinks he's a thirty something thief.I'd give it a 9 out of 10.",9,1,2,20 May 2006
Dead Poets Society," Great Movie. A Must See!
","It's my all time favorite! When I first saw this movie, it was in my 9th grade English class (and it was an assignment). I didn't like it the first time, but as I watched it the second time, I fell in love with it. Now it's on DVD, and I can enjoy it even more. Robin Williams plays a dramatic English teacher guiding his students to explore new insights. Robert Leonard plays the passionate son of an unreasonable demanding father. Ethan Hawke plays his new best friend who dares not to speak in front of anybody for his fear of people not listening to his ideas. Norman Lyodd plays the heartless headmaster who believes the role of tradition is more important than the hopes and dreams of the students at Welton. When I went to the website that had scripts of deleted scenes, some I wished had stayed in the film. I loved this movie because I could imagine myself being a part of the film. Thumbs up to the actors and the directors.",10,3,4,20 May 2006
