Ford v Ferrari," Quality movie, with incredible actors
","I usually don't like racing movies, but this one is amazing, it is really intense, sad and alot of drama. This movie have 3 of my favorite actors of all time, Jon Berthal, Matt Damon and Christian Bale. Well written script and then when it said that it was a true story, I was blown away. Watch this film if you are a fan of amazing and emotional movies. Must watch for every movie lover!!!",9,2,4,23 November 2019

Avengers: Endgame," OMG!!! Im Speechless
","Omg, this movie could not have been a greater ending to this phase. All the epic moments like when Cap lifts Mjolnir and did get lighting powers. Profesor Hulk was also a great way to make hulk/Banner. Now i come to the end Battle (OMG). It was so epic when Wong and Dr Strange openee the portels, army of Wakanda, Asguardiens, Wizards and all the Avengers that went into dust in IW. In the end i cried when Tony died, he was after all the person that saved everyone and won over Thanos. I had also it coming when old man Cap appeared. The most chocking thing was Black Widow Death. This movie was the best ending and i am happy to have been a part of the marvel movies since Iron man 1 came. Thanks.",10,1,3,25 April 2019
It Chapter Two," Stephen King!!!!
","I really liked and enjoyed the prequel but when this second part was announced knew it would be better.I think this is more than a horror movie or at least more than the typical horror movie, the form to make a concept for all protagonist was amazing exploring their deep fears and feelings making sad, epic, romantic and terror moments giving each character their respective moment to shine.The horror parts probably don't scare the all watchers but have a good visuals and did a good job in the terror camp overall, the movie works great with another categorys too making some emotionals parts with a strong impact.I really loved this film, one of the best recent movies of this type in my opinion and why not of all time too",8,4,6,8 September 2019
