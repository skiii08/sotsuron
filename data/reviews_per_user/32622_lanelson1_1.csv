United 93," Well done movie
","Well, I went and saw it. There are no spoilers; we all know how the story ended. The movie itself was well made. The progression of events and the individuals' respective responses, while speculation, was reasonable and believable. The brutality of the terrorists was GRAPHIC. The behind the scenes events in the Air Traffic Control Centers and Military Command Posts were well done. This is the most realistic movie I have seen out of Hollywood on an actual event I have seen in a long time.There was some license taken, A passenger with a northern European accent (either Scandanavian or German) urged the other passengers to behave and be quiet. He even stood and attempted to warn the terrorists, but was dragged down and silenced by other passengers not in the assault team. What the 'assault team' did to the terrorists outside the cockpit was at least as gory as what was done to the flight crew, a flight attendant and a passenger by the terrorists.It showed the door to the cockpit being breached, but never showed the passengers reaching the controls although that was implied. The movie suddenly went to black. There were two slides of epilogue and the last slide before the credits was a dedication to all who were killed on 11 Septermber. The theater was silent, with the exception of some people crying. Leaving the theater was like leaving a funeral.I am glad I saw it. You may not want to; that is your privilege, or you might wait until it comes out on DVD. But, I encourage you to see it.",10,4,10,30 April 2006
