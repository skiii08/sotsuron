The Hunger Games: Mockingjay - Part 1," Save your money, avoid
","Awful film, could easily have been reduced down to about 10 minutes. Instead it drags on offering you nothing for entertainment, character development or intrigue.I love this franchise but they have left me feeling jaded by the ruthless money-grabbing approach of splitting the book up into 2 parts. Nothing happens. NOTHING HAPPENS, and it is full of deliberately long scenes and scene repetition. They then even had the gumption to tease the exciting scenes that will in the next film at the very end. Left wanting more but not in the good way 'that was amazing, I don't know how I will survive the next 12 months waiting for the conclusion' way. Its a bit more 'this Big Mac really doesn't look as exciting or delicious as it does in that poster'. Save your money, wait for part 2 (something will actually take place in that film)",1,31,46,1 December 2014
