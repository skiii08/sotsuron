Come and See," The best war film I've ever seen
","This is perhaps the most horrific, gripping movie I have ever seen and the best war movie I've ever seen. It painfully displays the harsh reality of war and is not afraid to shy away from every detail.This movie is not an easy watch but will keep you glued to the screen, even during the most disturbing parts.It has been more than a day since I watched the film and still hasn't left my mind, which has to justify exactly how impactful this movie has been to me, even as someone who does not particularly enjoy the majority of war films.To conclude, I definitely rank this among my top 10 movies of all time, although I most likely won't want to rewatch it any time soon.",10,5,6,9 December 2019
