The Blair Witch Project," Ho hum
","This movie would've been better as a fifteen-minute short.  As presented, at 90 minutes, it's a drawn out, occasionally scary movie with a cop-out ending.  If you rate movies by how much time passes before you start looking at your watch, I give this one a 'twenty-minute' rating.",7,1,1,31 July 1999
Requiem for a Dream," Traffic Part Deux, or Reefer Madness 2000
","WARNING: SPOILERSGod, what an overcooked, nauseating 'message' movie.  Until about halfway through, I was thinking 'jeez, this is briliant', great acting and innovative directing and editing, but after the umpteenth bing-bang-bong toke-snort-shoot sequence, I got bored.  Which must be why they had to bring on the hideous necrotic arm infection, live two-girl sex show, and electro-convulsive therapy for Mom.Otherwise the plot hacks were directly from the 'Traffic' template, with the inevitable Attractive White Junkie Girl selling herself to The Big Bad Negro Dope Dealer and The Cheezy Bald White Guy.  Who is financing these movies, anyway -- Barry McCaffrey?",6,0,0,28 May 2001
Fight Club," F* Club
","This movie was fun and offbeat, until it turned very stupid.  I'm not sure of the exact point, but it may have been when Brad Pitt, having just made fun of muscle-torsoed yuppie gym fanatics, pulls off his shirt to reveal... a muscled torsoe (oiled down, no less).  From then on, things got really silly and implausible.  Unless you feel like wasting your money on another Mall-ternative star vehicle, stay home and read a book.",6,1,4,18 October 1999
The Passion of Joan of Arc," The most powerful movie I've ever seen
","There is really nothing I can say about this movie other than to tell you to get a hold of a copy as soon as you can, and keep a few boxes of tissues nearby.  I've never seen any film, let alone another silent film, that sustains this level of emotional intensity for its entire duration.  The first ten seconds of this movie will show you why some directors chose to end their careers when talking-pictures became popular.  The expressions on the face of the incredible Maria Falconetti carry the drama in a way that no dialogue ever could hope to do.  My only warning is that this film is not entertainment; it is an overpowering work of artistic genius that could make a stone weep.  So make sure you are in the right frame of mind before watching it.",10,2,4,17 August 2003
Being John Malkovich," Not Being Terry Gilliam
","Okay, you're Adam Spiegel, and you've directed lots of Beastie Boys videos, and you want to go for something bigger.  So you borrow a name from a 1930's novelty music star, you watch a lot of Terry Gilliam movies, steal a bit from each one, throw together a lot of acting talent, and come up with a mean-spirited piece of garbage that, in this late-90's anything-offbeat-must-be-brilliant critical zeitgeist, gets rave reviews.Oh yeah, you also get once-brilliant, pop-sellout R.E.M. musician Michael Stipe to produce.  Voila, box office!",6,1,2,13 November 1999
"Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon"," Women kick butt: so what?
","I went to see this movie with a lot of expectations, based on the great press it had received.  True, it was a beautifully photographed, and perfectly-directed and -acted, as we've come to expect from Ang Lee. Unfortunately, the tired old plot (everyone has to avenge their master, father, sister, cousin, whatever) and silly supernatural effects put a huge damper on what would have otherwise been a decent adventure/love story.
It was kind of like opera, where all of a sudden two people will jump out of their conversation into a big aria; here, they literally jump off the ground and start flying around in a way that makes a complete mockery of the martial arts.  The fighting in this film has been compared to the fighting in The Matrix, but the comparison isn't really fair.  In The Matrix there was at least a sense of physics, even if it was an exaggerated physics, and the audience gasped with delight.  In this movie, the audience I was in just laughed, repeatedly, at the silliness of it.  This would have been tolerable if the actual combat was any good, but really, it's no more exciting than what we've come to expect from Jackie Chan and co., and here it ends up looking more like dancing.The only really compelling part of the film was the romance in the desert, and even that sequence stretched out well beyond the point of interest.
This is the only Ang Lee movie where I started looking at my watch an hour before the end.  I hope he'll go back to making brilliant, innovative masterpieces like The Ice Storm and Ride with the Devil, and avoid trendy set-pieces like Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon.",Null,0,0,9 January 2001
"O Brother, Where Art Thou?"," O Barf Bag, Where Art Thou?
","Oof! This terrible movie, which I regret having wasted any time on, is built around racist stereotyping of the lowest sort, except the characters are white Southerners, so I guess that makes it okay.  According to 'O Brother Where Art Thou', everyone in 1930's Mississippi was either a dancing Klansmen, a  dumb cracker, or a generic black victim (who gets virtually no lines in the film). I think the low point (and there were many in this horrible movie) had to be putting Ralph Stanley's sublime masterpiece 'O Death' into the mouth of the Klan Grand Dragon as the prelude to a lynching. For old-time music lovers, this is roughly the equivalent of what a Catholic would feel watching a porn actor belt out 'Ave Maria' right before a big sex scene.George Clooney proves once again that he can't act, John Turturro reminds everyone how well he can, Charles Durning gets a few laughs, and Gillian Welch, Emmylou Harris, and the rest of the singers get a paycheck at the expense of their immortal artistic souls.How could the Coen Brothers, makers of some of the best movies of the last 20 years, be responsible for this travesty?",6,0,2,17 June 2001
