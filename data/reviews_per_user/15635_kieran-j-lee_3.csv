Skyfall," Disappointing, the critics lied to me
","For their fiftieth anniversary outing the producers and writers of Skyfall have elected, without a hint of irony, to plagiarise from their progeny and the other films these have influenced. The plot line is lifted from the first Mission: Impossible, the tone and character arc from Bond devotee Christopher Nolan's Dark Knight Trilogy, and the framing device from the Bourne series. The set pieces are largely borrowed from the aforementioned films and a number of previous Bonds. They even take one of Bourne's stars in a barely recognisable Albert Finney, a role that should have had Bourne's Brian Cox written all over it. There are a couple good lines but most of them seem to have been produced using the random Bond line generator and are delivered exactly when anticipated. In short what we get is a lazily conceived film delivered by a committee of Hollywood pretenders. Unfortunately what we don't get is a Bond film, just another post Bourne Hollywood-style actioner, save for a few bones thrown to the fans in the third act (Bond's DB5 and the revealing of a key 'new' character). Other than M, female characters share about ten minutes of screen time and all Bond has to do is show up to get laid in stark contrast to Craig's previous two outings (in QoS he never gets laid at all). Which is astonishing given that here Craig has all the charisma of a sack of potatoes. These 'Bond girls' only serve as vehicles for exposition, one doesn't even get a line of dialogue, and one wears just the right amount of lipstick to make you wonder if she's really just a guy in drag. The introduction of Bardem's villain is the highlight of the movie but any promise this scene brings is then completely squandered. There is some particularly poor CGI in the rendering of Bardem's make up and two Komodo Dragons. As the end credits rolled I was left feeling this whole sorry exercise's sole purpose was to introduce three rather dull new actors / characters to the franchise. As a life long Bond aficionado I am deeply saddened and now resigned to the fact, save for another reboot, we'll never see another decent Bond film again.",5,32,65,29 November 2012
Knocked Up," An very humorous look at relationship dynamics at two very different stages of a relationship
","Obviously inspired at least in part by the hit Indian comedy Salaam Namaste, but taken to the limits of bad taste that only an American comedy can. This is better-acted and has a better portrayal of the dynamics of a married couple in crisis and some genuinely funny moments. Rather than just focus on the challenges faced in the relationship between Alison and Ben, it also gives a well-written insight into the interplay between individuals in a relationship that has matured, but the individuals within it are not fulfilled. A couple of the dialogues between Debbie and Pete are absolutely classic. Ben's friends provided some additional comic relief and its good to see that the likes of James Franco haven't forgotten their roots. However, I'm not so sure that it merits being listed in the top 250 movies of all time though.",8,0,3,27 June 2007
The Dark Knight," Excellent
","The leads in this movie shine and its an excellent balance of drama and action. It does stretch a little though, feeling a little like they've squeezed two films into one in order to give all the characters the room they need to develop until each one reaches their ultimate fate. An Australian reviewer recently commented it didn't feel that long despite being almost 3 hours long - guess what, it was only 2 hours and 20 minutes! Unfortunately, in Australia we tend to have to sit through half an hour of ads before the feature begins.I digress. Heath Ledger was excellent, channeling Jack Lemmon on demonic form with just a hint of surfer dude still there, particularly when in one scene late in the film he reveals a tanned arm. The only negative I would give is this film's hangover from the previous films in the series and the persistence of Batman's booming graveling voice. Christian Bale must have had such a sore throat by the time they finished making this film!",9,4,9,16 July 2008
