The Blair Witch Project," The Ghost and Mr. Chicken was more frightening!
","The Blair Witch Project is being called one of the scariest movies ever by more than one person I know.  Quite frankly, I was practically bored to sleep.  The story idea is really great but the photography (video camera bouncing all over the place), the 'effects' and the acting (I was praying the Witch would get the woman just to shut her up) certainly leave something to be desired.  I'd say the scariest part of the movie was trying to determine whether I should tell friends about it or not!",2,1,4,16 May 1999
U-571," WOW! What a ride!
","U-571 is definitely one of the best nail biters I've ever seen!  The acting is very good, the story great, and the suspense never stops! Claustrophobic - yes!  Tense - yes! This is one you will NOT want to miss seeing on the big screen.",9,0,4,20 July 2000
