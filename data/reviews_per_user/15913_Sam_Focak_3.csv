Ali," He just wasn't that interesting a guy
","In another stroke of good luck this past week, I was on my way to a movie that I didn't really want to see when I got handed a pass to a sneak preview for a movie I was looking forward to -- Michael Mann's Ali, starring Will Smith.It is clear that Smith worked hard for this role -- he trained for six months to become a boxer, not just to look like one.   He has the trademark Ali mannerisms, often times sounding just like him, and occasionally even looking like him.   It's too bad that it turns out Ali just wasn't that interesting a guy.   The performance itself was impressive, but the overall experience really wasn't that good.I usually enjoy Mann's directing style, I like the slow-paced detailed storytelling he did in The Insider, but it just didn't work in Ali. In three hours, I felt like I really didn't know much more about the man than I did going in, and that's not a whole lot of information. Either Mann didn't manage to delve inside Ali's 'head' or there just wasn't that much to say about his motivations.They seem to gloss over some of the most defining moments of Ali's life, like his involvement with Malcolm X, but then spend torturous amounts of time delving into the most insignificant events that really don't lend you any insight. I really wanted to like this movie, I remember growing up watching Ali on TV, and vaguely remember the controversy around him, I hoped Mann would really blow the cover off the stories and myths, but this time around, he fails to land the knockout punch.",6,0,0,25 December 2001
The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring," Movie Magic lives on
","Epic.   Instant classic.   Masterpiece.   Sweeping vision.   Stunning. Spectacular.   Breathtaking.   Amazing.   Wondrous.These terms are bandied about by reviewers for far too many movies, so much so that when it comes to discussing The Lord of the Rings: Fellowship of the Ring, they don't seem to do this movie justice.    And I'll admit, I've struggled with writing this review and how to quantify the appeal that's taken me back to see it four times in the first eight days it's been playing.I first heard about this film about 4 years ago, and met the news with equal parts anticipation and trepidation.  I could write for days about all the books that have been turned into movies with disastrous results.   Make it too complex and you alienate the casual movie-goer who can't spell Middle Earth.   Make it too simple, and you infuriate the readers who have embraced it for 50 years, scrutinizing even the smallest change.Director Peter Jackson (Heavenly Creatures, The Frighteners) has managed to walk that fine line and create a movie that approaches perfection.Does the movie follow the book verbatim?   Of course not.   You would need ten hours to re-tell every word of dialogue and convey every emotion in Fellowship.   Instead what Jackson has managed to do is capture the <i>spirit</i> of Tolkien's works.From the simple grasslands of the Shire to the depths of Moria, the majestic beauty of Rivendell to the darkest corners of Isengard and Mordor, they are all created in stunning detail.    The naive innocence of the Hobbits, the wisdom of the ancient races, the power of the wizards, the honour of the men of Gondor, the viciousness of the Orcs -- these things are all captured scene after scene.Jackson has managed to pull all of these things together into a story so well told that it becomes easily accessible to any viewer, without betraying his love for the original material -- the movie is filled with details that would mean nothing to the new viewer, but which are there for the sole enjoyment of the Tolkien fan.The casting is also superb.  The fastest road to ruin would have been to fill this movie with Hollywood's A-list, but this was never an issue -- it's clear that the concern lay purely with the talent, not the names.    Ian McKellan simply <b>becomes</b> Gandalf, Elijah Wood plays the role of reluctant hero to perfection while Viggo Mortenson excels as the dark, brooding Aragorn.    Top to bottom this cast embodies the heart and soul of Tolkien's characters.So take all the pieces...an epic story, a stellar cast, superb musical score, stunning scenery, a healthy mix of special effects and some terrific battle sequences, and you find yourself with an experience that approaches perfection.",10,0,0,25 December 2001
Black Hawk Down," A great *war* movie
","I recently took in Black Hawk Down, a film chronicling a US special forces mission in Somalia in 1993.   Originally scheduled for release in March of this year, the studio decided to try and capitalize on the recent peak of patriotism in the States and moved it to January.They also did something else unusual for a war movie, and opened it in LA and New York for Oscar consideration.   Having seen the movie now, I believe it truly raises the question 'What makes a great movie, rather than just a great genre movie?'There is no doubt that Black Hawk Down is a great war movie.    Hell, with Ridley Scott directing (Blade Runner, Gladiator) and Jerry Bruckheimer producing (Top Gun, The Rock, Pearl Harbor), you were almost guaranteed a great war movie.    After a brief 20-minute introduction to the situation in Somalia and the mission assigned to the soldiers, you are thrown right into the middle of war.   Not as a spectator, but as a participant.For the next two hours, your senses are assaulted by a barrage of automatic weapon fire, explosions, helicopters crashing and people dying, and you are right there along with them.   This is no small feat of directing.   Even Saving Private Ryan, which opens with one of the most incredible battle scenes ever put to film, never managed to draw you right into the fight -- there was always that feeling of being a horrified observer.Nor do you feel overwhelmed by flag-waving patriotism.  The film certainly chronicles some moments of true bravery and heroism, but the entire mission was a disaster, and the movie pulls no punches there either.  The efforts to retrieve two top henchmen of a Somali warlord quickly turns ugly when one of their Black Hawk helicopters gets shot down.  This small group of soldiers was grossly outnumbered and seriously got their asses kicked all over the screen.Filmed in Morocco, in and around a US military base, the movie maintains its' gritty third-world feel, and I'm certain Bruckheimer used *every* last ounce of pull he had to get the US government to lend four real Black Hawk helicopters to the production, and I'm certain that much of the cool technology we see on display was also straight from Uncle Sam's storehouses.Yet despite all the attention to detail, despite creating an incredibly intense movie-going experience, I still can't bring myself to call it a great movie.  A truly great movie would have done everything above, and still managed to teach me about the conflict in Somalia.   A truly great movie would have made me care about at least a few of the men who risked, and lost, their lives, rather than assuming I would empathize with them just because they are soldiers.  Quite simply, the movie lacked the heart it needed to be elevated to the next level of greatness.Then again, with the level of mediocrity in Hollywood these days, just being a great type of movie is still an impressive accomplishment.",7,0,0,26 January 2002
