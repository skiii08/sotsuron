Scarface," A Cuban Immigrant who takes over a drug empire.
","Al Pacino proved to be one of the best actors ever in Scarface. Al Pacino played as Toni Montana who was a Cuban Immigrant that took over a drug empire. The most heard line from everyone if they have seen this spectacular movie is 'Say Hello To My Little Friend!'. Another one of Toni Montana's famous words is 'Cockroach'. These are seen everywhere. As a Cuban myself, I felt that when he died in the last scene of the movie, I lost a person that I really cared about. Toni went through a lot of bad things in his life. Some of my family members have gone through a lot of bad things. Not as bad as Toni though. Scarface is a great movie and everyone who hasn't seen this is crazy and should.",Null,0,1,28 May 2005
