The Twilight Saga: Breaking Dawn - Part 1," Watch if you're a twilight fan
","I went to the premiere and I've read all of the books. First off, if you've hated the movies from the beginning then you're not going to like Breaking Dawn. I must admit, even if I am a fan of the books, I also disliked the first three movies. But this movie blew me away! The acting improved with Kristen Stewart and Robert Pattinson, and Taylor Lautner is exceptional. Bill Condon directed this perfectly, and took the series to the next level. And again, for all of the 'bad' messages people take from this move, you have to read the books! All the stuff that happens in Breaking Dawn makes a lot more sense, and you won't think you wasted two hours. So basically, Breaking Dawn is a dream come true for Twilight fans and it won't disappoint.",8,2,9,23 November 2011
