The Incredible Hulk," This Totally Makes Up For That Terrible 2003 Movie
","The Incredible HulkStarring: Edward Norton, Liv Tyler, William Hurt, Tim Blake Nelson and Tim Roth including a special appearance by Robert Downey Jr.Genre: Action/Sci-Fi/ThrillerRated PG-13I hated the 2003 Hulk movie, but I'm glad that this movie turned out better and made up for it and not to mention Edward Norton gets to play the title role and you can't go wrong with Edward Norton. Plus this movie got a chance to start the series over again from the right foot considering this movie is a reboot but yet a loose sequel. So basically, Bruce Banner (Edward Norton) is hiding out in Brazil trying to control his anger and finding a cure to get rid of his inner beast while General Ross (William Hurt) is still trying to capture him and trying to stop Emil Blonsky (Tim Roth) as he goes out of control and becomes Abomination. I liked it how this movie decided to take only a few minutes of the movie to show us how Bruce Banner became The Incredible Hulk unlike that 03 movie that took an hour to explain how Bruce became The Incredible Hulk. I also liked how they put in a lot of chase scenes in this movie like the chase scene in Brazil made it look like 'The Bourne Identity'. Plus the fight scenes were good too and they made a good choice to choose a villain that's more of The Hulk's size and strength. Edward Norton also did a good job writing this movie too, he never fails to do a good movie, I hope he does another Incredible Hulk movie or at least make an appearance in 'The Avengers' movie. Not to also mention that Tony Stark (Robert Downey Jr.) gets to make a special appearance. Overall this movie was totally better and made up for the damage that Ang Lee did.",10,11,20,17 September 2008
Miracle," Excellent Sports Movie!
","MiracleStarring: Kurt RussellGenre: DramaRated PGStar Rating: ***** out of 5Miracle is a very historical sports movie that is based on the true story about a hockey coach named Herb Brooks (Kurt Russell) who makes a difference in leading the United States Olympics Hockey team to it's first gold medal victory with using mostly hockey players from college meaning 18 and 19 year olds and some in their 20's. But with a great team, Herb Brooks won the 1980 Olympics against the invincible Russian hockey team! It was too bad that the real Herb Brooks died when this movie was in post-production. But this is something to honor him by saying thanks for one of the greatest moments in sports history.BOTTOM LINE: LOTS OF MIRACLES CAN HAPPEN!",10,1,1,11 June 2004

Jackson, Ian McDiarmid, Jake Lloyd and Ray ParkRated PG for Sci-Fi Action ViolenceGenre: Action/Sci-Fi/Adventure/Fantasy/WarStar Rating: ****1/2 out of 5This is the Star Wars beginning story and this is a little different from the three from the late 1970's to the early 1980's. In this episode, The evil Trade Federation plots to take over the peaceful planet of Naboo, Jedi Warrior Qui-Gon Jinn (Liam Neeson) and his apprentice Obi-Wan Kenobi (Ewan McGregor) travel to Naboo to warn Queen Amidala (Natalie Portman) about the attacks of the Trade Federation. Eventually, Naboo is invaded forcing the Jedis to evacuate the planet with the Queen and her court. They travel to the desert planet of Tatooine where they meet a slave boy called Anakin Skywalker (Jake Lloyd) who is evidently one with the Force. They enlist his help in fighting the war, while the Jedis confront one of the Dark Jedis behind the invasion, Darth Maul (Ray Park), while his master Darth Sidious (Ian McDiarmid) continues to lead the invasion. So now the freedom fighters must stop the Trade Federation from invading the planet of Naboo! The only original characters from the three Star Wars movies from the 70's and 80's were C-3PO (Anthony Daniels), R2-D2 (Kenny Baker), Obi-Wan Kenobi (well we get to see him in his younger days) and Yoda (Frank Oz).

Muhammad Ali got his bike stolen when he was a kid and so then he started taking some boxing lessons and started getting into boxing and decided to do that as a career. Muhammad Ali is pretty much like Michael Jordan but different. Muhammad Ali was became the world's greatest boxer ever! Especially with all those champions he win and didn't give up to get to them either and also famous for one of his sayings, 'I move like a butterfly but I sting like a bee!'.

The Longest Yard," The funniest Adam Sandler movie ever!
","The Longest YardStarring: Adam Sandler, Chris Rock, Nelly, Burt Reynolds, James Cromwell and Courtney Cox (brief appearance)Rated PG-13 for Crude and Sexual Humor, Violence, Language and Drug ReferencesGenre: ComedyStar Rating: ***** out of 5This is one of the funniest movies with Adam Sandler and Chris Rock and I think this is the first time we've seen Adam Sandler and Chris Rock working together since the 1990's Saturday Night Live cast! This movie was a remake from a 1970's film with the same title and Burt Reynolds was in the original movie. The movie is about a former NFL star Paul 'Wrecking' Crewe (Adam Sandler) who was a superstar back in his day since time has faded. Then one night he gets arrested for drunk driving in his girlfriend's new car and then goes to jail, Paul finds he was specifically requested by Warden Hazen (James Cromwell), a duplicitous prison official well aware of Paul's athletic skills. Paul has been assigned the task of assembling a team of convicts, to square off in a big football game against the sadistic guards. Paul assembles a football team with the help from Caretaker (Chris Rock) and an old legend Nate Scarborough (Burt Reynolds) to coach, Crewe is ready for what promises to be a very interesting game. It's only the warden and the guards who have no idea who or what they're up against, with Paul the driving force behind the new team. I laughed my ass off through out the entire movie! Plus Adam Sandler's stunt double was backup QB from the Los Angeles Avengers (an pro Arena Football team), Brian Mann! I would highly recommend this movie!BOTTOM LINE: A LAUGH OUT COMEDY WITH A TOUCHDOWN!",10,1,3,3 June 2005
50 First Dates," Another Funny Adam Sandler Movie!
","50 First DatesStarring: Adam Sandler, Drew Barrymore, Rob Schneider, Sean Astin and Dan AykroydGenre: Romance/ComedyRated PG-13Adam Sandler and Drew Barrymore reunite to do another comedy movie! The last movie they did together was The Wedding Singer. This movie is about a man named Henry Roth (Adam Sandler) who is a veterinarian living in Hawaii who enjoys the company of vacationing women. He leaves the playboy life behind after he falls for Lucy (Drew Barrymore), who suffers from short-term memory loss. Since she can never remember meeting him, Henry has to romance Lucy every single day and hope that she falls for him. Lucy lost her memory in a car crash and since then she thinks it is the very same day which is her dad's birthday until she finally finds out later on. One of my favorite parts was when Ula (Rob Schneider) is pretending to attack Henry so Henry can get Lucy's attention and it work and so Lucy keeps beating Ula with a metal baseball bat, that part just laughed my ass off! Another part I liked was when Lucy and Henry wake up the next morning and Lucy didn't remember Henry sleeping with her so then she hits him with a lacrosse stick and then later Dr. Keats (Dan Aykroyd) tells Henry that he wasn't going to suffer any memory lose but asked him that if his head was shaped like a melon before she hit him. This was funny just like Mr. Deeds and The Wedding Singer!",6,1,2,21 June 2004

","Wayne's WorldStarring: Mike Myers, Dana Carvey, Rob Lowe, Brian Doyle-Murray, Lara Flynn Boyle, Chris Farley (brief appearance) and special guest appearance by Alice Cooper Rated: PG-13 Genre: ComedyStar Rating: ***** out of 5Wayne's World is one of the funniest comedy movie classics of the 1990's! It is about these two guys named Wayne (Mike Myers) and Garth (Dana Carvey) have their own TV-show called Wayne's World. They film the TV-show in Wayne's basement but when someone wants to own the rights of the TV-show. The show becomes a big smash hit! One of the most funniest parts in Wayne's World is when they were discussing the contract with one of the guys and Wayne does hear what he said so Wayne said 'Ex-squeeze me? Baking Powder?'. Also in the movie this one guy named Ben Oliver who is a sleazy advertising guy tries to kill the show off the air. But fails of course! I thought Mike Myers and Dana Carvey made a pretty good comedy team in this one and in Wayne's World 2!BOTTOM LINE: VERY FUNNY!",8,0,2,17 February 2004

I think the reason why I say Underworld is better than Van Helsing is because there were better fight scenes, the way the movie was done was better than Van Helsing. Underworld is a movie about this war between werewolves and vampires that have been sworn enemies for more than 100 years and a death dealer named Selene (Kate Beckinsale) has an assignment to take down the last of the Lycan. When she comes across Michael Corvin (Scott Speedman) who holds the key to end the war she must decide where her alligances will lie.

Also after the movie had it's first weekend in the movie theaters, I was reading the entertainment section in the newspaper and saw that Disney announced that they were going to make a sequel to Pirates of the Caribbean and I thought that was fast especially since it made $46,630,690 million dollars on it's opening weekend! The movie is based on a theme park ride at Disneyland or Disney World. I think because I don't know which one. Pirates of the Caribbean is a sweeping action-adventure story set in an era when villainous pirates scavenged the Caribbean seas. There is a curse on this gold medallion for whenever it shines that is when Captain Barbossa (Geoffrey Rush) and his ghostly crew awake! When the Governor's daughter, Elizabeth Swan (Keira Knightley) is captured by these ghostly buccaneers, Will Turner (Orlando Bloom) teams up with an rogue pirate named Jack Sparrow (Johnny Depp) to fight these ghostly pirates!SPOILER WARNING: Will and Jack attempt to recapture The Black Pearl ship, save the British navy, and relinquish a fortune in forbidden treasure thereby lifting the curse of the Pirates of the Caribbean.I really liked how this movie had lots of action and funny parts! I thought Johnny Depp did a really good job has a pirate and plus he was also really funny! Orlando Bloom did a good job too! I also thought the beautiful Keira Knightley did a great job also! I think Keira Knightley is one of the most beautiful girls I have ever seen especially with her looks and her sexy English accent!BOTTOM LINE: GREAT MOVIE WITH ACTION, ADVENTURE, THRILLS AND HUMOR!",10,0,2,26 April 2004

As we follow up in the sequel we find mild-mannered, Peter Parker (Tobey Maguire) having a hard time in his life especially with the whole Spider-Man and fighting crime thing. With the Spider-Man thing going on, it was effecting Peter Parker's life and his grades, his jobs and his relationship with Mary Jane Watson (Kristen Dunst) and his friendship with his best friend Harry Osborn (James Franco) and Mary Jane was about to get married to J. Jonah Jameson's son, John Jameson (Daniel Gillies).

But when the system in the experiment overloads the mechanical arms start controlling Otto Octavius making him become Dr. Octopus! Dr. Octopus decides to restart the whole thing from scratch and go after Spider-Man! Peter realizes that only Spider-Man can stop him, but of course, problems arise. Mary Jane gets caught in the middle, and Harry Osborn, who still blames Spider-Man for the death of his father, Norman Osborn, also the Green Goblin, wants him dead. Spider-Man will have to push himself past his limits if he's going to survive. The ending to this movie gets this whole dark moment coming in for Spider-Man 3!

So this movie kicks off the X-Men story for when the President of the USA is thinking the mutants are threating the country even the good ones. But that is when Magneto, Sabretooth, Toad and Mystique are beginning to take over the world. But not if the Wolverine, Cyclops, Storm, Rogue and Professor X can stop him!

","Spider-Man 3Starring: Tobey Maguire, Kristen Dunst, James Franco, Thomas Haden Church, Topher Grace, J.K. Simmons, Bryce Dallas Howard and Dylan BakerGenre: Action/Adventure/Sci-Fi/ThrillerRated: PG-13It was 3 years after they released Spider-Man 2 and now there's Spider-Man 3. The first 2 Spider-Man movies were good and there were high expectations for this movie. So in this movie, Peter Parker (Tobey Maguire) has finally managed to balance his relationship with Mary Jane (Kristen Dunst) and his responsibility as Spider-Man while Harry Osborn (James Franco) is out for his revenge (with a new green goblin suit) on Peter for killing his father while Spider-Man is trying to take down Flint Marko/Sandman (Thomas Haden Church) for killing his uncle. Peter Parker loses all hope until his suit turns black and becomes stronger and faster but effects his behavior with a darker attitude. Also we finally get to see Venom (Topher Grace) on the big screen after long awaited! This movie is alright but not the best out of the whole series. I really think that putting Sandman in this movie wasn't necessary, I thought Venom should have had more screen time and I thought this movie had too many sub- plots to it. Plus I didn't like it how they made Peter Parker so emo to the point where he acted like a little whiny bitch. Other than those nit picks, I thought the movie was alright but if they're going to go for a fourth movie then they need to not make so many sub-plots and stick to the main story.",6,1,2,5 October 2008

As we left off from the first Scary Movie the survivors Cindy Campbell (Anna Faris), Ray Wilkins (Shawn Wayans), and Shorty (Marlon Wayans) and Brenda Meeks (Regina Hall), are at college, trying to forget the incidents that occurred last Halloween. Cindy is falling for Buddy (Christopher Kennedy Masterson), who loves to give wedgies, and Ray is still confused about his sexuality. Professor Oldman (Tim Curry) and his paralyzed assistant, Dwight (David Cross), have decided to do a research study at Hell House, the house where the bad exorcism took place, and disguise it as a sleep disorder study. Chaos starts as soon as Cindy arrives and meets the creepy caretaker (Chris Elliot) with the funny hand. But the house has some deep dark secrets that the group has to solve, even if they are scary or disgusting. So this movie spoofs 'Charlie's Angels', 'House on Haunted Hill', '13 Ghosts', 'Paulie', 'Dude, Where's My Car?' and 'The Poltergeist'. One of my favorite parts in the movie is where Cindy is driving in her car and listening to Vitamin C's song 'Graduation' and Cindy is singing along to the song very badly so Vitamin C on the radio tells her to shut up and let her sing! Another funny part I liked was when Anna, Theo and Brenda were going to fight Hanson the guy with the funny looking hand, the three girls where running down the stairs while changing into their Charlie's Angels costumes and then when they come down you at first see them with their underwear and then they run back to change into their costumes. Another part I liked was the part where the group was with Dwight and he was handing out their items to defeat the ghosts and Brenda asks if there where any communication systems like walkie-talkies but instead all he had was just a line of string with two dixie cups on both sides! Another funny part was Shorty was teaching Cindy how to be all ghetto. I like this as well as the first one! Another thing I liked about this movie is that Tim Curry is in this movie and I think Tim Curry is hilarious and a good actor.BOTTOM LINE: FUNNY AS WELL AS THE FIRST AND I'M STILL LAUGHING!",8,0,2,29 May 2004

There aren't enough Jedi to defend the Republic against the threat, so Chancellor Palpatine (Ian McDiarmid) enlists the aid of Jango Fett (Temuera Morrison), who promises that his army of clones will handle the situation. Meanwhile, Obi-Wan Kenobi (Ewan McGregor) continues to train Anakin Skywalker (Hayden Christensen) and then they discover the plans of the Sith Lord and Anakin Skywalker is assigned to protect Senator Padme Amidala but his protection to Padme leads to a romantic relationship between Anakin and Padme. But when Anakin finds his mother dead, he begins slipping away from the light side of the force and perhaps the force itself (but that's another story). I thought Episode 2 was good but still the plot was a little weak but still good like all the other Star Wars movies! But at least one good thing about this episode is that there is less Jar-Jar Banks (voiced by Ahmed Best) than in Episode 1 and as usual R2-D2 (Kenny Baker) and C-3PO (voiced by Anthony Daniels) tag along for the adventure like in the other Star Wars movies.

The film chronicles his accidental experiences with some of the most important people and events in America from the late 1950's through the 1970's including a meeting with Elvis Presley, John F.Kennedy, Lyndon Johnson, Richard Nixon, fighting in Vietnam, etc. The problem is, he's too stupid to realize the significance of his actions. Forrest becomes representative of the baby boomer generation having walked through life blindly and has the time went on he learned a whole lot more. The one thing I thought was pretty cool about Forrest Gump is the way he plays ping-pong (or sometimes called table tennis)! I was amazed during one part of the film where Forrest Gump ran all the way to Arizona!This movie won 6 Academy Awards for Best Picture, Best Actor in a Leading Role, Best Director, Best Effects/Visual Effects, Best Film Editing and Best Writing Screenplay.BOTTOM LINE: LIKE MY MOMMA ALWAYS SAYS LIFE IS LIKE A BOX OF CHOCOLATES, YOU NEVER KNOW WHICH ONE YOU'RE GOING TO GET.",10,1,2,29 November 2004

When they were just about to divide the shares out, one of the members of the group, Steve (Edward Norton) betrays the group and kills John Bridger (Donald Sutherland) who is the father of Stella Bridger (Charlize Theron) who is a master at picking locks and getting safes open. So then after Steve killed John, Charlie begins to set up a big plan to take down Steve. So then they create this huge traffic jam in downtown Los Angeles, CA to have them get away with the gold with the traffic light switching with the help of the computer-wiz Lyle (Seth Green). SPOILER WARNING: THIS IS A LITTLE DIFFERENT THAN THE 1969 VERSION! This movie also had some good funny parts to it like when Lyle was changing the traffic lights in the airport he stands up and yells and then the entire people in the airport look at him and then he says 'I got the Holy Spirit.' Also another funny part was in the end when they are showing the credits Lyle buys this big stero system that blows women's clothes off! My favorite part of the movie was the entire mini-cooper car chase and the part where Charlie is at the dinner table with Steve and says, 'You don't know how hard it is for me to reach across this table and punch you!' and then Steve says 'You blew the best thing you had going for you.

This movie kept shocking me out of my seat every time when there was a scary part coming up and you don't know what is going to strike! I thought some of the weapons the Van Helsing used were pretty cool like this one weapon that is a crossbow but it can shoot arrows like a machine gun!SPOILER WARNING: Van Helsing gets bitten by a werewolf and then he turns into a werewolf while he is fighting Dracula in the final battle!Another thing is that I thought Josie Maran was very sexy as a vampire when she was a vampire bat she didn't look good then but when she was back into a vampire she looked sexy. I also thought Hugh Jackman did a great job at Van Helsing because he plays a lot of good main role characters and I thought he was also good in the X-Men movies doing Wolverine! Also, can you believe that Kate Beckinsale was doing this movie while she was filming Underworld at the same time? I know I can't especially with having to be playing a vampire hunter in one movie and then switching to a human character in the other.BOTTOM LINE: HUGH JACKMAN HAS DONE ANOTHER GREAT ROLE AGAIN!",8,1,2,18 May 2004
Spider-Man," High Web Swinging Fun!
","SPIDER-MANStarring: Tobey Maguire, Kristen Dunst and James FrancoGenre: Action/Sci-Fi/Thriller Star Rating: ***** out of 5 PG-13 for Stylized Violence/ActionThis is one of my most favorite MARVEL Comic Book movies out of all of them! Spider-Man is one of my most favorite Marvel Superheroes because of all his web-slinging powers and plus his spider senses. This movie is pretty much the whole story of how the whole Spider-Man legacy started. A guy named Peter Parker (Maguire) is a school photographer and one time when going on a field trip he gets bitten by a new spider species and later he discovers it and gets all these fantastic super powers! Peter Parker then starts becoming Spider-Man and one of the first bad guys he stopped first was the guy who killed his uncle. Harry Osburn's father works for this one company and he later becomes the very first and memorable Spider-Man villain of all time, Green Goblin. The only one thing I thought that didn't seemed right was probably the Green Goblin's costume, it looked like nothing compared to the costume in the comics! The movie reminds me a whole lot of the 1994 Spider-Man cartoon that used to come on Fox Kids. The movie is just about how Spider-Man really started being a superhero really.BOTTOM LINE: BEST COMIC BOOK MOVIE EVER!",10,0,1,1 April 2004
The Fast and the Furious," Fast Cars and Furious Action!
","The Fast and the FuriousStarring: Paul Walker, Vin Diesel, Michelle Rodriguez and Jordana BrewsterGenre: Action/Crime/DramaRated: PG-13This movie was really cool! I liked all the action, thrills and I liked the car chasing scenes in this action packed adventure. The movie is about a guy named Brian (Paul Walker) who is a detective who is undercover and blinding in with street racer groups to catch the bad guys. So while he is on the case he joins up with Dominic (Vin Diesel) who is one the best street racers and together they bring the bad guys down! The best chasing scene is the one where after they are street racing Dominic gets chased by the cops and ditches them. I really thought the car the Vin Diesel drove was really cool. The one he drives at the end of the movie kind of look liked the car he drove in the movie XXX. But it was a big shame that Vin Diesel wasn't in the sequel but he wasn't able to be in the sequel due to the fact that he was busy with a different movie at the time when 2 Fast 2 Furious was in either pre-production or post-production. But at least Paul Walker returned for the sequel. This would be a movie I would recommend to car racing fans.",6,1,3,14 January 2004
Batman Begins," A Fresh Restart for the Batman franchise
","Batman BeginsStarring: Christian Bale, Katie Holmes, Michael Caine, Liam Neeson, Gary Oldman, Cillian Murphy and Morgan FreemanGenre: Action/Adventure/Crime/ThrillerRated: PG-13I thought the last Batman movie sucked and after that it was a while until one day I saw a poster for this movie and I wasn't sure if this movie had any connection to any of the Batman movies from the 90's until I found out it was a reboot. Anyway, the movie basically a darker story of how Bruce Wayne (Christian Bale) became Batman and brought justice to the corrupted Gotham City and takes down Scarecrow (Cillian Murphy). I like these newer Batman movies better than the 90's movies because these newer movies for these following reasons:1.) Darker story2.) Actually follows the comic books (for example, like in the Tim Burton movies, Bruce Wayne's parents were killed by The Joker when in the comic books Bruce Wayne's parents were really killed by some street thug)3.) These newer Batman movies make the 90's movies look like cartoons4.) Better cast (Christian Bale is excellent and so is Michael Caine)Christian Bale has to be the best Batman ever to this day and age! I'll definitely choose this newer Batman movie over any of the 90's movies anytime!",10,2,2,27 September 2008

The Transporter," One Hell Of A Ride!
","The TransporterStarring: Jason Statham, Shu Qi, Francois Berleand, Matt Schulze and Ric YoungGenre: Action/Crime/ThrillerRated: PG-13After a few supporting roles, Jason Statham finally gets lead role in The Transporter. In this movie, Jason Statham plays Frank Martin, a man who is a freelance transporter who is hired to deliver a package to an American gangster known as Darren 'Wall Street' Bettencourt (Matt Schulze). Frank has 4 rules when it comes to transporting and they are 'Never Change The Deal', 'No Names', Never Open The Package' and 'Never Make A Promise You Can't Keep'. He eventually breaks one of the rules by opening the package which turns out to be a kidnapped woman named Lai (Shu Qi). He eventually delivers the package to Wall Street but gets double crossed and now Frank must help Lai by rescuing enslaved people from China. Jason Statham does a great job in this movie and not to mention doing his own stunts as well. Also I like the car chase scenes and the cars placed in this movie. Overall good movie, I highly recommended if you're into stylized stunts and car chase scenes!",7,0,0,18 October 2008
Ghost Rider," A Great Thrill Ride
","Ghost RiderStarring: Nicolas Cage, Eva Mendes, Peter Fonda, Wes Bentley, Donal Logue and Sam ElliotGenre: Action/Fantasy/Drama/ThrillerRated: PG-13Ghost Rider is just one of those movies where you don't have to take it so seriously in order to like it. This movie is almost like the Blade movies in terms of how Ghost Rider fights evil that's from hell but this is way better than Blade. So anyway, Nicolas Cage plays the wild stunt biker, Johnny Blaze who makes a deal to Mephistopheles (Peter Fonda) in order to save his father and in return has to forget about his life and his love, Roxanne Simpson (Eva Mendes). A few years later, Johnny's path crosses again with Mephistopheles to give up his soul to have Johnny become the fiery bounty hunter of hell, Ghost Rider in order to take down Blackheart (Wes Bentley), a son and enemy of Mephistopheles. Nicolas Cage did a great job playing Ghost Rider and of course it's always nice to see Eva Mendes on screen of course. The only thing that I didn't like about this movie is how they decided to put in a villain who turned out to be an easy defeat instead of picking one that would be more of a challenge but then again it's an origin movie so everything has to start off easy i guess. But hopefully there will a more challenging villain if they do a Ghost Rider 2. Overall i'd recommend this movie and I hope they do a Ghost Rider 2.",8,5,6,11 October 2008

For the first time, mutants have a choice: retain their uniqueness, though it isolates and alienates them, or give up their powers and become human. The opposing viewpoints of mutant leaders Charles Xavier (Patrick Stewart), who preaches tolerance, and Magneto (Ian McKellen), who believes in the survival of the fittest, are put to the ultimate test triggering the war to end all wars. Jean Grey (Famke Janssen) becomes possessed with the power of the Dark Phoenix and the X-Men must stop her before her powers destroy the entire planet. This movie should have had some more fight scenes to make it a more interesting final battle but it was still good. The only new characters in this last X-Men movie are Juggernaut (Vinnie Jones), Hank McCoy/Beast (Kelsey Grammar) and Warren Washington/Angel (Ben Foster). Plus Colossus (Daniel Cudmore) and Shadowkat (Ellen Page) get some more time in the spotlight since they had little time in X-Men 2. But it was too bad that Cyclops (James Marsden) and some other characters had to be killed off. Plus I have always enjoyed Hugh Jackman's performances in the X-Men movies as Wolverine. All and all X-Men 3 was good but there some characters from the comic book that they forgot to include in the movie.BOTTOM LINE: A GOOD ENDING TO THE X-MEN TRILOGY",10,1,1,21 June 2006

He isn't even your average superhero. Brought forth by the Nazi's during a sacred ritual towards the end of World War II. Our hero was summoned by accident when the evil monk of Russian history/folklore,Grigori Rasputin was meddling with forces that lead to his undoing. With the twisted and evil monster trapped for another sixty years when things don't go as planned (US soldiers heroicly intervened). Hellboy is raised by Prof. Trevor 'Broom' Bruttenholm (John Hurt), an expert in the occult. Our demonic hero is initiated in to the Beureau of paranomal research were he joins the amphibious, kind hearted, and clever fellow 'Freak', Abe Sapien (voiced by David Hyde Pierce). When Rasputin returns once again with the aid of his minions the meniachal, undead asassin Kroenen (Ladislav Beran) and the monks faithful lover Ilsa (Biddy Hodson). Hellboy must unwillingly pair up with John Myers,(Rupert Evans) an idealistic, naive new agent of the Beaureu. Not only that but the big hunk of an evil basher becomes entangled in a love triangle with the pyro-telekinetic love of his life Liz (Selma Blair) and his new comrade. This movie I think was a combination of League of Extraordinary Gentlemen and X-Men and somewhat like Daredevil. I think Ron Perlman does a great job doing Hellboy! I never heard of the comic book Hellboy until I saw this movie. The only thing I wanted to know about this comic book is if it was a DC Comics hero or a Marvel Comics hero? I find out it was neither. I am glad that Guillermo Del Toro is going to do a sequel this movie and Ron Perlman will return to his leading role, Hellboy! I also thought all the special effects and all were really good!BOTTOM LINE: VERY COOL!",Null,0,1,3 October 2004

When their grant expires, the trio gets fired and start up their own business of ghost exterminators called Ghost Busters!

Overzealous Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) agent Walter Peck thinks the Ghostbusters are frauds, and he has the Ghostbusters put in jail. Walter Peck kind of reminds me of Commander Farrell (from Swat Kats) and J. Jonah Jameson (from Spider-Man) because they also think just because the hero they have now isn't protecting the city the way they want them to they want them in jail! Also in this movie we see Slimer and that Giant Pillsbury Dough Boy.

","Fantastic Four 2: Rise of the Silver SurferStarring: Ioan Gruffudd, Chris Evans, Jessica Alba, Michael Chiklis, Julian McMahon, Kerry Washington and Doug JonesGenre: Action/Adventure/Sci-Fi/FantasyRated PGAfter the so-so turnout of the first Fantastic Four movie, I was wondering how were they going to make the sequel better than the first movie? They brought in the Silver Surfer into the plot. So basically the movie picks up two years later from the last movie, Reed Richards (Ioan Gruffudd) and Sue Storm (Jessica Alba) are about to get married and things couldn't seem better. However, the Silver Surfer (Doug Jones) is sent from Galactus to destroy the earth and Doctor Doom returns to steal the powers of The Silver Surfer and now The Fantastic Four must save the Earth from disaster. Compared to the first movie, this one had a little more action and the addition of The Silver Surfer was a nice touch but still the Fantastic Four movies are not going to match up to the success of the 'X-Men' or 'Spider-Man' movies. Plus I also don't understand why they gave this movie a PG rating instead of keeping it PG-13? I didn't see a reason for them to lower the rating for this movie. I don't think there will be a Fantastic Four 3 because somehow I think it would only make it worse for the movies since they've turned out with two decent movies unless they can make it extremely better to blow our minds. But I would like to see a spin-off movie for The Silver Surfer. I also enjoyed some of the funny moments from Johnny Storm (Chris Evans) and Ben Grimm (Michael Chiklis). Overall it was decently better than the first but it still won't match up the high success to 'X-Men' or 'Spider-Man'.",7,8,13,21 September 2008

While investigating a seemingly routine crime, Jay uncovers a diabolical plot masterminded by Serleena (Lara Flynn Boyle), an evil Kylothian monster who disguises herself as a sexy lingerie model. It's a race against the clock as Jay must convince Kay--who not only has no memory of his time spent with the agency. One of the funny things about when Jay is trying to refresh Kay's memory from being with the MIB is when the car pulls up and Kay asks if he is the one that drives and Jay tries a little bit of reverse psychology on Kay by saying that he was the one that did all the driving! Plus another funny part was when Jay needed another partner, Frank the Pug volunteers and he walks out to the car with a little suit and tie on. Another funny part is when the car pulls up automatically and this one fake guy gets sucked into the air bag and then Kay says, 'Does that come standard?' and then Jay says, 'Actually it came with a black dude, but he kept getting pulled over.' I kind of liked this one a little better than the first Men In Black movie. Also I thought Lara Flynn Boyle was really sexy in this movie!BOTTOM LINE: ANOTHER EXCELLENT HIT SEQUEL!",7,1,2,13 May 2004

But when Shrek and Fiona are back from their honeymoon they head out at once again when they get an invite to the King (voiced by John Cleese) and Queen (voiced by Juile Andrews) of Far Far Away, aka Fiona's parents.

The King and Queen are shocked when they found out that their daughter had married an ogre! The Fairy Godmother (voiced by Jennifer Saunders) finds out that the King had forgotten about the deal he made with her about having Fiona marrying Prince Charming, the Fairy Godmother's son (voiced by Rupert Everett).

But later Puss-in-Boots later becomes good and helps Shrek and Donkey on their quest to help Shrek make Fiona happy because when Shrek and Fiona got to Far Far Away, Shrek and the king didn't really see each other eye to eye.

We get to see Fiona back in human also. Also in the end when they are showing the credits they show this one part where Dragon came back to Donkey and they had little dragon-donkey babies which I thought was funny and cute.My favorite parts was when the movie was spoofing Guess Who's Coming To Dinner and Mission Impossible when Shrek, Donkey and Puss-In-Boots were escaping the dungeon.

Batman, Harvey Dent (Aaron Eckhart) and Commissioner James Gordon (Gary Oldman) have successfully began rounding up criminals around Gotham City until The Joker (Heath Ledger) comes into town and starts making chaos around Gotham City. The movie plays a lot more of a darker tone than the first movie with the struggling relationship between Bruce Wayne and Rachel Dawes (now played by Maggie Gyllenhaal) and Bruce Wayne's confrontation with The Joker. Heath Ledger does a fantastic job at portraying The Joker and deserves an Oscar for his performance or at least an honorable mention since his death and all.

The best scene was the one on that lava planet where we see the ultimate showdown, Anakin vs. Obi-Wan! The climax to this movie was really cool! This end of this episode sets up the events for Episode 4: A New Hope (the 1977 Star Wars film) where Darth Vader goes to war against his children Luke & Leia. This episode also ends with Darth Vader starting his evil empire, Luke & Leia separated, Padme dead, C-3PO (Anthony Daniels) and R2-D2 (Kenny Baker) hidden way and for the Jedi leaving Yoda and Obi-Wan the only ones left alive. Plus this Star Wars film marks the debut of Chewbacca During the production making of this Star Wars movie, there were rumors about George Lucas making a third trilogy that would continue where 'Episode 6 - Return of the Jedi' picked up but later Lucas denied the rumor and said that this was the last Star Wars film. Can you even imagine if they did a third trilogy? I know I would have a hard time imaging that especially with all the replacements they would have to make. But everyone has to stop at the top of their game at some point. Thank you very much George Lucas for making this last Star Wars movie a great one!BOTTOM LINE: THE END (for the Star Wars prequel trilogy) and TO BE CONTINUED................ (into Episodes 4, 5 & 6)",10,2,7,29 June 2005
Ray," Wonderful Biography story!
","Ray Starring: Jamie Foxx Rated PG-13 for Depiction of Drug Addiction, Sexuality and Some Thematic Elements Genre: Biography/Drama/Music StarRating: ***** out of 5 Ray is the story and life about the legendary musician Ray Charles! Ray was born in a poor African American town in central Florida and he went blind at the age of 7. But with the help and support of his mother, he developed the fierce resolve, wit and incredible talent that would eventually enable him to overcome not only racism and the cruel prejudices against the blind, but also discover his own sound which revolutionized American popular music! Nonetheless, as Ray's unprecedented fame grew, so did his weakness for drugs and women, until they threatened to strip away the very things he held most dear. This little known story of Ray Charles' meteoric rise from humble beginnings, his successful struggle to excel in a sighted world and his eventual defeat of his own personal demons make for an inspiring and unforgettable true story of human triumph! This movie was made the year when Ray Charles died because of liver failure. Jamie Foxx did such a great job playing Ray Charles in this movie that he won the award for Best Performance from a leading actor in the 2005 Academy Awards and I think he deserved it! Plus this movie also helped me learn more about Ray Charles because I have heard about him but I just didn't know about him as much but I learned later.BOTTOM LINE: GREAT STORY!",10,3,5,21 July 2005
Shrek," Fun Movie!
","SHREKVoices: Mike Myers, Eddie Murphy, Cameron Diaz and John LithgowRated: PGGenre: Animation/Adventure/Comedy/Romance/Fantasy/FamilyStar Rating: ***** out of 5Shrek is one of the best animation movies ever next to the ones from Disney/Pixar!

So then when Shrek finds out that Fiona is in love with Shrek, Shrek goes to stop her from marrying Farquad, who just wanted to marry her just to become king. So then Shrek and Fiona are now married!

Iron Man," Excellent and Fun
","Iron ManStarring: Robert Downey Jr, Terrence Howard, Gwyneth Paltrow, Jeff Bridges, Paul Bettany, Leslie Bibb and a brief appearance by Samuel L. JacksonGenre: Action/Adventure/Drama/Sci-Fi/ThrillerRated: PG-13Iron Man has definitely matched up to the same amount of success as the 'X-Men' and 'Spider-Man' franchises. So basically this movie about billionaire playboy Tony Stark (Robert Downey Jr) who is known for designing weapons under Stark Industries. Tony Stark gets captured in Afghanistan while demonstrating a weapon and builds an iron suit to escape and later builds a new suit to fight crime becoming Iron Man and to stop Obadiah Stone/Iron Monger (Jeff Bridges). Robert Downey Jr does an excellent job as Tony Stark, I can't think of anyone else that would have done a better job for this role. Well at one point Tom Cruise was going to play Tony Stark until he turned it down, what a relief because if he went ahead did the movie it would've sucked which is why I think Robert Downey Jr was a better choice. At the end of the movie, if you may close attention you'll see Samuel L Jackson appear as Nick Fury. I definitely can't wait for Iron Man 2!",10,1,2,27 September 2008
The Emperor's New Groove," One of the most hilarious Disney movies!
","The Emperor's New GrooveVoices of David Spade, John Goodman, Wendie Malick, Eartha Kitt and Patrick WarburtonGenre: Animation/Family/ComedyRated: GThis is one of my most favorite animated Disney movies yet! The jokes were very funny! The movie is about a young emperor named Kuzco (voiced by David Spade) who is the big time ruler of the land and then one day when he catches Yzma (voiced by Eartha Kitt) sitting in his throne he fires her.So now Yzma is wanting to get revenge on Kuzco, along with Yzma's big and funny sidekick, Kronk (Warburton). So Yzma decides to make a poison for Kuzco and then when they give him the poison, she and Kronk find out it was llama potion! So then Kuzco gets turned into a llama and then later meets up with Pacha (John Goodman), who then helps him back to get back to his palace so he can get changed back. But Pacha and Kuzco didn't really see each other closely at first. Meaning they didn't get of on the right foot.So when Yzma finds out Kuzco is still alive, she and her sidekick, Kronk go of to find them. My most favorite part was when Kuzco gets chased by panthers and then Pacha saves him and then they get wrapped on a tree and then Pacha saids 'Don't worry were safe', and then the tree breaks and then when they land in the water Kuzco saids 'Don't tell me we are about to go down a big waterfall right?' 'Yep' 'Sharp rocks at the bottom?' 'Most likely' 'Bring it on!' The movie has good moral to it. The moral of the story is working together and friendship. This is a movie I would highly recommend!",10,3,5,12 February 2004
Bruce Almighty," Very Very Funny!
","Bruce AlmightyStarring: Jim Carrey, Morgan Freeman, Steve Carrell and Jennifer AnistonGenre: ComedyRated: PG-13Jim Carrey has done it again with this really funny and successful comedy!This movie is about a man named Bruce Nolan (Jim Carrey) who is a news-reporter for one of the news stations in the city of Buffalo, NY and he lives in his apartment with his girlfriend Grace, (Jennifer Aniston). One day, he has a very bad day because he didn't get promoted in his job, he lost his job and plus he got beaten up my some hoods and Bruce thinks the God (Morgan Freeman) is picking on him. So then the next day when Bruce visits God they discuss things and so Bruce was offered to be God for 1 week so Bruce got to have God's job which I think sounds really cool! So while Bruce is God, God is out taking a vacation. I thought this movie was just very clever with all the jokes and all. One of my favorite parts is where Bruce was in God's office and he opens the file cabinet and it was shooting out really long! Another one of my favorite parts is where Bruce was getting even with the hoods and one of them said the day that they apologized would be the day when a monkey came out of his butt and obviously it did! Another funny thing was that Bruce also used his powers to help the NHL team, the Buffalo Sabres win the Stanley Cup. The most hilarious part in the entire movie is when Bruce is missing up one of the other news casters when he was reading a report! This movie was just laugh-out loud hilarious! I would recommend this movie and that's the way the cookie crumbles.",10,0,2,9 May 2004
X2: X-Men United," Better than the 1st!
","X-Men 2: X-Men UnitedRated: PG-13Genre: Action/Sci-Fi/ThrillerStarring: Patrick Stewart, Hugh Jackman, James Marsden, Halle Berry, Ian McKellen, Famke Janssen, Anna Paquin, Rebecca Romijn-Stamos, Alan Cumming, Shawn Ashmore, Kelly Hu, Brian Cox and Aaron StanfordStar Rating: ****1/2 out of 5I thought this X-Men sequel was better than the very first one because in this one they finally put in more characters from the comic book. Not like I didn't like the first one. I liked the first one but this one was a little better! Already living in a society that mistrusts them, the mutants are faced with even more discrimination after an unforeseen enemy - who may be a mutant with extraordinary powers - launches a devastating attack. So now Professor X and his mutants most team up with Magneto and his mutants to fight William Stryker and stop to the Mutant Academy from being attacked by the military forces. Plus in this movie we also get to discover the origin of Wolverine (Hugh Jackman). The new mutants in this movie are Nightcrawler (Alan Cumming), Pyro (Aaron Stanford), Kitty Pryde, Jubilee, Colossus and Lady Deathstrike (Kelly Hu). I kind of miss Toad and Sabertooth, wishing they didn't die and were still with the other bad guys. Plus in this movie we start seeing a closer relationship between Iceman (Shawn Ashmore) and Rogue (Anna Paquin) and Cyclops (James Marsden) and Jean Grey (Famke Janssen). Plus another thing I like about this movie compared to the first is that there is more funny parts by Hugh Jackman has Wolverine!BOTTOM LINE: LIKE THE FIRST BUT THIS IS BETTER THAN THE FIRST ONE!",10,0,0,5 May 2004
The Matrix," Interesting! Also one of the best hit movies of 1999!
","The MatrixGenre: Action/Sci-Fi/ThrillerRated R for Sci-Fi Violence and Brief LanguageStarring: Keanu Reeves, Laurence Fishburne and Carie-Ann MossStar Rating: **** out of 5The Matrix I thought was a little weird but very interesting! The Matrix is about a guy named Neo who is a computer-hacker who gets chosen by a group of rebellious freedom fighters led by Morpheus (Laurence Fishburne) who wants Neo to help him and the Freedom Fighters battle the machines to overthrow them and save the Earth from technology disaster! What I thought was weird was the part when Neo was with those agent bad guys his mouth grows shut.I thought to myself how do all these people in this movie know exactly every next move that the enemy is pulling on the good guys? Part favorite part was when Neo and Trinity (Carie-Ann Moss) were on the roof battle scene and one of the bad guys is shooting Neo and it shows in slow-motion how Neo is dodging all those bullets without even a scratch on him! Can you believe that? I know I can. But this was just the beginning with Neo and the Freedom Fighters! But that is the sequel and then the sequel after that. I thought it was just cool on how they really made this movie!TO BE CONTINUED......... (In the other two Matrix movies that is)BOTTOM LINE: VERY INTERESTING!",9,0,1,9 May 2004

Fantastic Four," Decent but most of the time it felt like more of a comedy
","Fantastic Four Starring: Ioan Gruffudd, Jessica Alba, Chris Evans, Michael Chiklis and Juilan McMahon Genre: Action/Adventure/Sci-Fi/FantasyRated PG-13Fantastic Four is a pretty good movie but the X-Men and Spider-Man movies are a little better but this was better than The Hulk. I did like The Hulk but I still think that movie needed improvement. This movie is based on another well known Marvel comic book about 5 astronauts who go on a space mission and later get caught in a cosmic radiation exposure and they gain superpowers. But only 4 out of the 5 people used their powers to save the world and they are Mr. Fantastic/Reed Richards (Ioan Gruffudd), The Invisible Woman/Susan Storm (Jessica Alba), The Human Torch/Johnny Storm (Chris Evans) and The Thing/Ben Grimm (Michael Chiklis) who become the Fantastic Four! But for Victor Von Doom (Juilan McMahon) he uses his powers for evil and destruction when he loses his company and everything else and becomes Dr. Doom! I think this movie could have been a little longer and I think there could have been some more fight scenes and such. But the story of this movie went too fast like X-Men but all and all it was alright. I was glad to see Jessica Alba back on screen again in this movie and her movie before this one, Sin City, because I haven't seen her ever since 'Dark Angel' got canceled off FOX. Plus I'm glad in this movie, they didn't CGI-ed The Thing because that would have been stupid if they did. Before this movie came out in theaters, Jessica Alba already said that there is going to be a sequel to this movie! Decent overall.",6,3,7,11 July 2005

Dodgeball," One of the most funniest movies of 2004!
","Dodgeball: A True Underdog StoryStarring: Vince Vaughn, Ben Stiller, Christine Taylor, Rip Torn, Stephen Root, Justin Long, Chris Williams, Hank Azaria, Jason Bateman, Joel Moore, Missi Pyle, Gary Cole, Jamal Duff and Alan TudykGenre: ComedyRated: PG-13Dodgeball is one of my favorite movies of 2004! Also another one of my favorite sport movies too. This movie is about a guy named Peter LaFleur (Vince Vaughn) who is a charismatic underachiever and proprietor of a rundown gym called Average Joe's. The facility's eclectic client of decidedly less-than-average Joes is comprised of: a self-styled pirate; a scrawny nerd who dreams of impressing an unattainable cheerleader; an obsessive aficionado of obscure sports; a dim-witted young man; and a cocky know-it-all who, of course, really knows nothing. Peter's humble gym catches the eye of White Goodman (Ben Stiller), the power-mullet-sporting, Fu-Manchu-d, ego maniacal owner of Globo Gym, a gleaming monolith of fitness. White intends to take over Average Joe's, and Peter's non-existent bookkeeping is making it all too easy for him. A foreclosing bank has stationed attorney Kate Veatch (Christine Taylor) inside Average Joe's to finalize Globo's takeover of the gym. But Peter's boyish charms win her over and Kate joins his team of social rejects to beat the odds and save the Average Joes gym from going out of business and winning the $50 million dollars in a winner take all dodge-ball tournament in Las Vegas with the help from a senior dodge-ball player Patches O'Houlihan (older version played by Rip Torn and the younger version played by Hank Azaria). After this movie came out in theaters back in June 2004, adult dodge-ball leagues began to play all across the country and Gary Cole was even invited to a pro dodge-ball tournament in Chicago, IL. Hope they start doing a professional dodge-ball league to the point where it is being played in arenas where NBA/NHL teams play in! But who knows? If you can watch this movie then you can dodge a ball!",9,0,0,5 January 2005

","The Island Starring: Ewan McGregor, Scarlett Johansson, Sean Bean, Dijmon Hounsou and Michael Clarke Duncan Rated PG-13 for Intense Sequences of Violence and Action, Some Sexuality and Language Genre: Action/Sci-Fi/Drama/Thriller Star Rating: ** out of 5 The Island was okay but it needed some re-writes in this movie. But I think the acting was pretty good and Michael Bay did alright directing this movie. The Island is about a guy named Lincoln Six-Echo (Ewan McGregor) and a girl named Jordan Two-Delta (Scarlett Johansson) who are residents in a mid 21st century facility and all the inhabitants are all wanting to be the chosen ones to be sent to 'The Island' - reportedly the last uncontaminated spot on the planet. But Lincoln soon discovers that everything about his existence is a lie. He and all of the other inhabitants of the facility are actually human clones whose only purpose is to provide 'spare parts' for their original human counterparts. Now Lincoln and Jordan most out run Merrick (Sean Bean) and his crew from capturing them and taking them back! The plot to this movie looks more like a TV-show than a movie which makes it interesting. But I still think this movie need some rewriting! But it was okay.BOTTOM LINE: OKAY BUT NEEDS SOME RE-WRITING",5,3,5,26 July 2005
Semi-Pro," Hilarious But The Same Stuff
","Semi-ProStarring: Will Ferrell, Andre Benjamin, Woody Harrelson, Rob Corddry, Andy Richter, Maura Tierney, David Koechner and Will ArnettGenre: ComedyRated: RWill Ferrell stars in his fourth sports movie, Semi-Pro. Will Ferrell plays singer Jackie Moon who buys the ABA team, the Flint Tropics from the profits of his hit song, 'Love Me Sexy'. Jackie Moon is a player, owner and coach of the Flint Tropics as well. The ABA Commissioner (David Koechner) announces that the American Basketball Association would merge with the NBA (which did happen back in the 1970's in real life but it's not based off that entirely) but only four teams would go and now Jackie Moon must try to get his team to average over to 2,000 fans in order to get his team into the NBA merge with the help of acquiring Ed Monix (Woody Harrelson). The movie is hilarious even though most of it is basically recycled stuff from Will Ferrell's other sports movies and Anchorman. But I would assume that this is Will Ferrell's last sports comedy movie since he plays the exact same character as in 'Kicking & Screaming', 'Talladega Nights' and 'Blades of Glory'. I didn't like how the basketball game scene shots were too tight when they could've been a little wider. Pretty hilarious but I don't think I can see Will Ferrell doing another sports movie.",7,1,3,13 October 2008
