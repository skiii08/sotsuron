Requiem for a Dream," This is a movie that you MUST SEE only to realize that you shouldn't have seen it!
","I can agree with both types of comments - yes, you can say it's a sick movie that tears your heart and mind... or it's full of inconsistencies (in plot, in characters), you can say it's a piece of art or the best movie ever.But this is a movie that you MUST SEE only to realize that you shouldn't have seen it!You cannot simply trust somebody else on what impact it will have on you. You must see it for yourself and decide if you like it or not, if you like the technique Aronofsky used or if the plot and characters suits you or not...And here is the contradiction: if you have not seen it you've missed a one of a kind piece of (art)work which could change your life. After you've seen it... the effect could be so deep and the shock so great that you can fall in a depression (at worst) or you could see what and how big are the changes you should make inside of you.I've read comments saying it's bad because of the technique (the recurring pills, the dilating pupil) or because its message is lame (don't do drugs)... Yes, you can say that. But you can also say that about other classic movies, in fact no matter how good a movie is, if you separate the techniques and the subject you will always find flaws in it.Some comments also say it's bad because of the unrealistic ending... but wait a minute...it's not a reality TV show. And lets be honest: do you think it's possible to tell an important message, to reach to everybody's beliefs and shake them like hell without exaggerating a little?Then there are comments saying this movie is bad (and yet some of them give 10 points out of 10) because it made them feel bad, depressed after seeing it. Well... I think that that was its intention... To make people feel bad, to make people think again before doing something alike (and not only alike...to make people think of human condition).Well, I think it's a movie that you can like and dislike in the same time, a movie with a profound effect on you, whether in a good or bad manner and you are the only one to decide that, not your friends, nor some reviews or comments (like mine :-P ). Only you. And for that you must see it!",10,0,1,30 October 2005
