Lucky Number Slevin," A Disaster
","I laid down my $8.50 and grabbed my popcorn, ready for a good Willis movie, he rarely disappoints, but instead ended up with a movie that forced it's way through tricks and trades of clever movies like Pulp, The Usual Suspects, and alike. The dialog was in your face verbal warring; a who can top the next line battle. I found it very difficult to suspend my belief and I was very aware of the fact that I was watching people perform. I'm sorry, but no one is that clever, or at least, not everyone you come into contact with is that clever. The trick was that you knew you were watching a trick, a con, but how will it play out? If you have a small idea about cinema, you'll have the entire movie figured out by the second act. Willis was great, but not enough of his character to keep you satisfied. I was very disappointed and I blame the director in the end. He could have done better if he would have taken the time. Don't bother renting. Wait for cable.",2,6,21,24 April 2006
Skyfall," Skyfall and Craig Raising the Bar
","Skyfall is film number three for Craig. It is a film about aging, poor choices, diplomacy, revenge, and loyalty. It is also about nostalgia. Skyfall is the first film of the Craig series that introduces many of the Bond staples. This is the beginning of the James Bond we have grown to love. The first two movies, Casino Royale and Quantum of Solace, were mere back story. They were films that let us know why James Bond is the way he is. Skyfall shows us who he will be.Skyfall stars Daniel Craig (Bond), Judi Dench (M), and Javier Bardem (Silva, a.k.a. the bad guy). Craig is still rough around the edges, a brutal killer with a touch of necessary class. Whereas former Bond actors like Connery and Brosnan made some men think it possible to be like James Bond, Craig dispels that silly notion. He is built like a gymnast and fights like a mixed martial arts animal. Judi Dench is, well, she's Judi Dench. She's a Dame and superb actress. Javier Bardem is an unforgettable villain He's a throwback of the old Bond movies, way over the top, brilliant, and pure evil. However, his portrayal is grounded in realism, which makes him even better.The film is directed by Sam Mendes (American Beauty & Road to Perdition). Mendes's direction keeps the momentum going with Craig. It's written by Neal Purvis & Robert Wade and John Logan. They keep the legend alive. The film is action packed with very few slow moments. The story is rich, rounding out the Bond world well. We get a few surprises and back story on some Bond characters of old. Like I said, this is the beginning. It just might be the beginning of the end, though.I'm not sure how long Craig plans on making Bond films. I hope it's a couple more, at least. For years, actors had to try and fill Sean Connery's shoes. I'll go out on a limb here and say that from now on actors will need to try and fill Daniel Craig's shoes. He has raised the bar to a whole new level.",9,1,5,12 December 2012
Inglourious Basterds," Vintage Tarantino: YES!
","Not since his masterpiece, Pulp Fiction, has an audience had the chance to view cinematic originality, or at least the appearance of such.IB is exactly what you would expect from a Tarantino film and more. You get a great shots, fun music, high action, drama, great lines, and a spectacular story. Going in, I was hesitant, but within 10 seconds, I was thrilled. The audience is sucked in immediately. Loved it. Loved it. Loved it.Pitt's character is fantastic. The villain is evil as all get out. Everyone is just cool like New England breeze. If you dig Tarantino, but were disappointed with the Kill Bills, he's got you covered on this bad boy. Stop what you're doing and go see it - now!",10,5,12,24 August 2009
Public Enemies," Good Movie With A Sour Note
","I thought this movie was very well acted, shot, directed, and written. Johnny Depp can do no wrong these days it seems. The violence was brutal and Mann did a great job at making the audience sympathetic to Dillinger. For the record, I was not sympathetic, as I am fully aware of Dillinger's violent and murderous actions. He was a monster. Nevertheless, my wife was very sympathetic.The downside to this film was the horrendous sound mix. It was one of the worst I've ever heard. At first, I thought it was the theater's problem, but once I had the operator change the mix from surround to mono, I realized it was the film's problem. Too bad. I was amazed that the studio let the final print out in that condition. Thumbs down for the sound designer, editors, and producers.Overall, Public Enemies is a crowd pleaser and enjoyable movie that doesn't glorify the gangsters of that age, but portrays them in a very real and shocking way.",8,2,4,9 July 2009
Us," Symbolism doesn't translate to Masterpiece
","I get the message. I understood the allegory. It made sense. The symbolism was actually on the nose. It isn't difficult or deep. All that being said, the film was dull, a jumbled mess, took great leaps, and wanted to be so clever it forgot to actually entertain. The humor fell flat, was disingenuous, and awkward. The film tried to call back to so many classic horror films it started to get muddy.I didn't hate it, but I certainly don't think it's a masterpiece. And frankly, anyone declaring it so has probably never seen or read a masterpiece. Grow up. Jordan Peele isn't reading your IMDB review.",4,4,10,23 March 2019
The Irishman," Boring attempt at capturing lightning
","It's as if Oliver Stone took an Ambien and tried to make a Scorsese film. Irishman is an unnecessarily long, fantastical farce that has been wrongly casted. Pacino has his moments early on as Hoffa, and by early I mean an hour into it. He shines, but then turns into Pacino later on. Apart from the book the film was adapted from, there was little to no further research on the era, locations, even proper pronunciations. Everyone sounds like they're from New York. The CGI de-aging failed to account for turkey necks and old man postures. Overall, this film is lazy, cinematic sentimental hogwash. But the Scorcese fanboys will disagree vehemently. He is, after all, their pope.",5,2,10,28 November 2019
Shutter Island," Everything I look For
","Without a doubt, Shutter Island is a film I've been waiting for for so such a long time. This psychological thriller will leave you breathless at the end. Hitchcock is giggling like a schoolboy from the grave.I was hooked and reeled in ever-so-slowly with this story. The acting is top notch, the cinematography out of this world, the script is brilliant, and the directing is flawless. When watching any film, I am always trying to stay ahead of the story, figuring out the details, taking notice of the foreshadows, understanding payoffs are coming. Shutter Island teased me at every turn and just when I thought I knew the truth - BAM! Guess again, Bronco Billy! If you like movies like Vertigo, North By Northwest, and Psycho then you'll love Shutter Island. This is what a thriller is all about. Good show!",10,1,6,3 March 2010
Bohemian Rhapsody," The Queen is the Soundtrack
","Aside from the performances, which were wonderful, and the soundtrack, this film is a jumbled mess. Starting with a horrendous script, filled with questionable directing and mediocre cinematography, finally rounding out with some of the worst editing since Taken 3. Big ups to the editors for trying to save the film, no thanks to Singer, but ultimately it only compounded the garbage. Frankly, Malek deserves a nomination just for having to wade through that nightmare. Queen fans will like it for the soundtrack, as well will those unfamiliar with the band. However, this film will not stand the test of time.",3,1,2,16 February 2019
Bird Box," Lazy and tired story
","Nothing new here. Keep moving. Bird Box is a lazy film being passed off as a meaningful horror film. The premise is ridiculous and I'm all for ridiculous, but if you're going to establish rules in a fictional world, you better stick with those rules. There are as many holes in this film as my sock drawer. Hindsight is 20/20, but these problems could have been easily resolved if a little more time would have been spent on the script.
Acting is well done considering the poor character development and motivations. Unfortunately, that's all you get with this film - actors doing as well as they can regardless. Actors don't just make a move good. You need so much more. 10/10 reviewers are hyperbolic fanatics and 1/10 reviewers are Netflix sourpusses. Truth is, Bird Box is a good B movie, nothing more.",3,2,5,23 December 2018
Dunkirk," An Absolute Failure
","I've been disappointed with films before, but Dunkirk will top that list for a while. The movie is boring. Apart from a few spitfire scenes that are well done, this movie lacks any real imagination. The most glaring problem with the film is the story.Nolan fails to truly capture anything worth telling. Instead pulling the audience in with character development, he relies on the history of the moment. You won't care one bit about a single character. Either we're to believe that the English have the stiffest of upper lips in times of great harm, or these duds would't realize true danger even if it set them on fire first.There are many great moments in Dunkirk history Nolan could have built a story around. But he chose to try to tell everything about Dunkirk in a discombobulated manner, filled with pensive staring, unintelligible dialogue, and a roaring soundtrack. And even for the passive WWII history reader, this will stink of mistakes and inaccuracies.I cannot recommend this film. Wait for the DVD or prime cable viewing.",5,10,20,24 July 2017
Unknown," Bourne Again
","Unknown is good, but not great. It's worth a go at the theatre, but if you're expecting Taken, prepare for disappointment.Liam Neeson is on top, giving a spotless performance. He is becoming more iconic and, therefore, his characters are starting to look the same. Not a bad thing if you're an actor (because you'll get more work and more money), but it can get tiresome for the audience. Fortunately, I'm not one of them. I enjoy Neeson in just about everything I see him in. Good for me and good for him as I'm sure the majority of movie-goers would agree.Unknown is all three Bourne movies tied up in one. It's great for those that don't have the patience for a long wrap-up. There is a lot of detective work and very little action; however, when there is action, it is good, including a hair-raising car chase. The ending is weak, but hey, it's Hollywood. When was the last time you saw a great ending? Unknown is worth 8-9 bucks. Just be glad there isn't a 3D version for you to pay $15 for.",7,42,58,22 February 2011
1917," Technical Aspect is Good
","Nicely directed and edited. Fine acting and camera work. The set design was wonderful. The story was Swiss cheese.I enjoyed 1917, but I wasn't blown away by the film. Mendes is a wonderful director and I'll pay to see his work any day of the week. All that being said, he cheated. The one shot gimmick was used well. They managed to hide the cuts in post and in camera. I was impressed. Then Mendes cheated. He had the character lose consciousness, fade to black, fade into several hours later. This could have easily been avoided if the characters just left hours later in the day.As for the story, well, it's pretty straight forward - Guy must deliver a message before it's too late. Not much room for anything else. Yet, we still ended up with the usual war movie tropes. I found myself rolling my eyes at times. Additionally, there was a poor use of time and space in the film.It wasn't enough to make me dislike the film, but this is not a Best Picture or Best Director. Maybe Best Production Design. Maybe Best Editing. However, there are far more superior films nominated. 1917 is worth a look in the theater, but don't go in with big expectations. The 10 and 1 reviews are out of their minds.",7,3,5,28 January 2020
The Adjustment Bureau," Not Bad Then Bad
","The first act hooks you with the possibility of watching a charming couple battle fate. The second act almost grips your heart with fate putting up a good fight. The third act makes you shake your head in disbelief.The director/writer/producer missed the mark on this one. I can think of a couple ways to really bring this film home and make it a great thriller. It's a shame George Nolfi couldn't. He makes a great case against allowing one man to write, direct, and produce a film. Too bad, because I really enjoyed Matt Damon and Emily Blunt's performances, but it wasn't enough to save this film from pooping out in the end. At least the popcorn was good.",4,5,10,11 March 2011
The Departed," Departed From Good Film-making
","The Departed, a gangster flick with a twist, is one of the biggest disappointments to date. The film was overly laced with foul language that would make a sailor blush, extremely violent, and overly witty; something that I can look past if the story is there, but The Departed was all over the map. The dialog was forced and without life. The story was predictable. The direction was static. And the writing, well, let's just say I've read crossword puzzles that were more interesting. The only reason I can see why this movie was ever made, is that Jack, Leo, Matt, Alec, and Mark said they would do it. And the only reason they said they would do it is because Scorsese was directing and they trusted him. He let them down. This film has one thing going for it. It won't be in theaters too long. Don't bother renting the DVD either.",1,20,42,9 October 2006
Transformers: Revenge of the Fallen," A Poor Effort
","Michael Bay can shoot one heck of an action sequence. It is hard to beat his style when it comes to action. Nevertheless, I am convinced he cannot tell a story at all.Though there were some exciting moments in the movie, it fell flat for me. It was all over the place. The characters were one dimensional and uninspired. The comic relief was too much. Finally, the film was insulting on so many levels.(Insult #1) Correct me if I'm wrong, but isn't Transformers based on a Hasbro toy line. So, who are they marketing this film to? Not my kid! He's 10 and his mouth dropped when every four letter word save the 'F' bomb was spewing out every character like water from a broken sewer line.(Insult #2) The twins are an outrageous ghetto duo that even insulted me, a white man! Holy smokes, how they thought that these characters would fly, I don't know.(Insult #3) Again, my 10 year old isn't interested in seeing rear ends of bombshell blonde's hanging out of there thin little dresses. He wants to see robots fighting other robots and soldiers fighting robots.Final thought: a poor effort from a film maker with poor character as far as I'm concerned.",4,3,9,26 June 2009
Da 5 Bloods," Bottom of the Coaster
","Wow. There are brief moments, but they are so brief I can't even recall them. Da 5 Bloods plays as if a film student who really likes Spike Lee tried to make a Spike Lee film. There are shot call backs to every Lee film, even some familiar rhythm in editing. Moments of preachiness appear as with every Lee film, but this film handles them like a turkey playing checkers. As for production design and setting, it's rather cheap. Da 5 Bloods was made for Netflix and it shows. Not much care went into this film. Ultimately, as with every bad film, the problem begins with the screenplay. Even if Lee set out to make a meaningful film, he didn't stand a chance with the script. Spike Lee fans may forgive him for his ham handed film making here, but history will list Da 5 Bloods as Da Dud.",5,12,28,12 June 2020
