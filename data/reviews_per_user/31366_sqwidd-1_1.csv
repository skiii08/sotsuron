The Ring," Intoxicating
","I very rarely get wrapped up in a movie, but 'The Ring' will do that to you.This movie eats you up and spits you out like a rabid coyote eating a bunny rabbit.  The images that you will see will not go away when the lights come up and will haunt you for days to come.The visual effects and sound editing are the best that we have seen in a horror or psychotic thriller in a long time and should garner some award(s).I will own this movie when it comes to DVD, but I highly reccomend you see it in the theatre first.",9,0,0,21 October 2002
