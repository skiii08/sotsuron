Angels & Demons," Interesting and captivating
","If you enjoyed The Devinchi Code, you will most certainly enjoy Angels & Demons. The movie takes us into the Vatican to witness how it reacts when faced with perils.We are there as we follow Tom Hank's character as he once again chips away for clues and uncovers truths that although astonishing, can be painful as well.The movie does a good job at telling a story, while captivating us with exciting action scenes. Photography, acting, directing, all excellent!",8,0,0,30 November 2009
Cloverfield," s.t.u.p.i.d
","Silly Tacky Useless Pathetic Idiotic DumbWhen will Hollywood get it that folks don't like looking at their own home videos much less an imitation of one with bad acting?This could have been a GREAT movie with the special effects, if they had just used a regular camera. The 'home movie' angle just did not work. As indicated, acting was bad. Party scene at the beginning was unneeded. Multiple technical errors. Special effects were great. Too bad that could not had been captured on a regular format. Also did not like the 'America is evil' angle. Really tired of that!",1,6,7,22 April 2008
2012," Save your money!
","I was looking forward to this movie coming out. Went tonight, and what a let down. 1. Was very slow at that start. Took forever to get going. Yes, you have to supply an intro to get acquainted with the characters, and a base for the story. But it took forever! Needless useless dialog. Way too much information, and typical bs that can be found in all disaster movies. 2. Speaking of disaster movies, this one follows all the others in cheap storyline and thrills. a. Typical disorganized hero with an estranged wife and kids. b. Typical step-father (who ends up being left out) Remember the fianc√©e in Twister? c. Typical African-American President. In Hollywood ALL Presidents must be African-American... Unless they are evil... then they can be white. d. Bad guy turns good in the end... then is killed. e. Super smart scientist that convinces the world and saves the day. f. Government holding secrets from the populous. 3. VERY UNREAL storyline. Just some really... I mean really STUPID scenarios.4. How many times do you have to have a runway drop out from under you before you decide it is not a good idea to land?5. Take a few flying lessons and you can not only fly... but navigate a Queen Air! 6. A lot of coincidences that are just way too hard to believe!7. Story drags... and drags.... and drags and goes on dragging for 2.5 hours! After a while you just end up saying yourself... 'Just end the world... I need relief!'8. They just tried to jam too many (already done) disaster scenes. A combination of Poseidon Adventure, Deep Impact, Hard Rain, Airport, Armageddon, etc, etc, etc.Anything good??? Special effects were 'ok'. At least kept me awake. Whatever you do.... Save your money don't pay $10.00 to see it. Don't spend money on the DVD either. Don't even pay a $1.00 at the cubical to rent. Wait for it to come out on TV... then if you have nothing else to do... watch it for the special effects!",1,198,297,13 November 2009
Gran Torino," Fantastic!
","Acting, filming, directing, location, etc etc etc.... All Fantastic!When this movie came out... I was not interested. When it came out on DVD... I still was not interested... then talking with my Sister she told me about it, and how much she liked it. So I rented it at a 99 cent cube... liked it so much, bought it for my collection. It stays out to neighbors and friends more than any other movie that I have! (out right now)A very real movie for very real times. Eastwood plays a racist, bitter, old coot who, in a quirk of fate becomes friends with an Oriental family. Estranged from his own family, he finds more in common with his neighbors, and in the end sends that message very clearly! (my favorite part)Some may call it racist. I call it real. having lived in Southern California, and visited the Detroit area many times, I have seen how people interact in such environments. Right down to the last detail 'Stay off my lawn!' is all very real. Regardless of your disposition, I feel all will enjoy... or at least be captivated by this film.This comment will be placed on the forum for any that want to discuss.",10,1,7,15 July 2009
