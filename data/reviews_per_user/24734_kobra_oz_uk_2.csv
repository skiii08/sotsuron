The Incredible Hulk," Way better than the lame '03 movie
","OK some people probably aren't going to bother spending their time or money on this because of the previous hulk movie which was pretty dull and boring.This however is........... F**** WIIIILLLDD!!!1112345!!sorry loll kinda got excited but that's the thing, its so wild, crazy and action packed, Edward Norton gives a good performance as usual, nothing too special like the curb stomping , baldy headed, goatee wearing Nazi skin headed rape victim in American history X but still his acting is pretty sick....Tim Roth also stars as the competitive 'i don't give a F***' enthusiastic soldier, with an extreme passion on bringing the hulk down...he actually steps up to the hulk and asks 'is that all u got' resulting in the hulk performing an insane Muay Thai style push kick that sends the lame bastard into a f***** tree which breaks nearly every single bone in his body. Tim Roth's performance is nothing great like in 'reservoir dogs' but still acceptable.Liv Tyler is just plain lameness.Overall a surprisingly great movie, the special effects and action are well done and the fight scenes between abomination and hulk look like a f***** brutal cage match mixed with a dog fight.8/10.",8,3,9,12 June 2008
The Wolverine," One of the worst comic book movies to ever grace cinema.
","I would have loved to write a detailed and analytical review of this title but it is not worthy of my effort so i'll just explain how it is the worst movie I have ever viewed in cinema, here it goes.1.DREADFUL DIALOGUE, WOLVERINE IS LIKE 'ERR YH YH...SHUT UP I'VE HAD ENOUGH' 2. STUPID as F*** 'Villain' dumbass snake-woman shoots out venom, pthoop. 3. incoherent storyline, CHEEESY AS F*** 4. illogical action sequences ninjas mircously appear out of no where and start fighting. 5. WOLVERINE IS NOT A BADASS HE IS A BIG PU**Y IN THIS MOVIE HALF THE TIME HE GETS OWNED AND DOESN'T HEAL BECAUSE THAT DUMB VIPER WOMEN OWNED HIM",1,5,11,26 August 2013
