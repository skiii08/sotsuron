50 First Dates," Adam Sandler has to make Drew Barrymore fall in love with him over again each day
","The best film Adam Sandler has yet made. The on-screen chemistry between him and Drew Barrymore is compelling and very romantic.Lucy (Drew Barrymore) has a serious head injury in a car accident, and as a result, has no short term memory from after her accident. One year after the accident, enter Henry Roth (Adam Sandler),a man whose avocation is one night stands with lady tourists vacationing in the Hawaiian setting. Henry falls for Lucy one morning at an atmospheric cafe, only to discover she does not know him or remember anything about him, the following day. Beautifully shot on location in Hawaii, Lucy and Henry are quite the unusual couple. All Henry has to do it make Lucy fall for him all over again each day!Bravo supporting performances by Blake Clark as Lucy's dad and Sean Astin as her steroid slurping body builder brother. Their task each day is to make Lucy believe it is still the day of the accident, and they go to great lengths to achieve this-until one day the scheme backfires.Rob Schneider is hysterical as Ulla, Henry's ne'er do well best friend. Also great supporting parts by Dan Aykroyd as Lucy's doctor, and Lusia Strus as Sandler's gender bending assistant at the oceanarium where he is a vet/researcher.A great sweet romantic comedy with a great script that guides you gently through Henry's (Sandler's) attempts to work around Lucy's (Barrymore's) illness, rather than to confuse! A must see for all Sandler and Barrymore fans, and a class act in the romantic comedy genre, right up there with classics from years past.",10,0,1,3 January 2005
The Butterfly Effect," A supposed psychological thriller wasn't released, it escaped!
","My wife and I saw a pre-release screening the other night,  and walked out of it about 45 minutes in. The 'director' has taken every taboo and horror movie plot device, and crammed it into the same movie. In the first two reels we are treated to gratuitous violence, the inference of child pornography, incest, animal abuse and babies and mothers being blown up with dynamite. They all live in a special little town where everyone except the main character's mother and his therapist seem to be psychotic or sympathetic to the drek they are acting in. The scene of animal abuse drove us out, simulated or not, it did nothing to further the plot, and caused nothing but revulsion. Our film society sponsor was in tears.If Ashton Kutcher wants to be taken seriously as an actor, he should pay James Lipton a standard consulting fee, and stay out of tripe like this in the future. I wouldn't watch this movie again with my worst enemy's eyes.",Null,5,10,18 January 2004
