Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," So great,... you have to see it twice!
","This movie was so excellent. I cheered for the fight scene with Qui-Gon Jinn, Obi-Wan Kenobi and Darth Maul. All of the special effects and sound effects were so awesome. Many cheers and yells when the movie began. Rounds of applause as some of our favorite characters waled on, like Obi-Wan Kenobi, C3PO, and R2D2.Along with the sinister way Darth Maul looked and is a man of little words and a lot of action. Many Star Wars fans will love this movie and some who may not be.",10,0,0,19 May 1999
Fight Club," This was one of the greatest films of 1999!
","Fight Club, is a great story of the psyche of a man that is so bored of his life, he creates chaos in order to feel better. Edward Norton and Brad Pitt do an outstanding job as the Narrator and Tyler Durden. Norton is superb in his insanity as he loses his mind. Consoling in help groups for a good 'cry'. That is abruptly put to a hault by a woman who is also trying to make her life better. Helena Bonham Carter also makes this movie what it is. The ending spirals into a twist with one of the most shocking suprises I have ever seen. This is one of the best films of 1999! This movie is worth the wait and the $8.00",Null,0,1,4 November 1999
The Matrix," So great i saw it twice!!
","What is the Matrix? This film is the answer. The acting was so well thought out. The special effects were top notch. I have to hand it to the Wachowski brothers, they have a gold mine on their hands. The story was excellent and the characters were laid out perfectly. The ending was not as shocking as i thought it was going to be, but the ending was still really good.
There is nothing wrong with seeing this movie 3 0r 4 times. It is worth the money. Enjoy, andThe Matrix has you...",Null,0,0,4 November 1999
