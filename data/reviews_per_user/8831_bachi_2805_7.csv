E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial," Best movie ever made
","Let me start by saying that I didn't get to see this film as a kid nor as a teenager. However...
I've cried each and every time I saw it. No shame at all.A piece of art, as this is, wonders us with the beauty of its shape. There's not a single shot in E. T. that isn't absolutely heavenly and unforgettable. The scene of the mother reading to the little sister is beyond this world. I'm holding back the tears as I write this.Acting is unmatchable. The shots are pure art. Also, the little guy that came from space is perfect.I'd also like to bring up that for me this is a movie about growing up. How the keys change to a loving passionate person. A change of perspective.If you wanna know the difference between movies that were made for money and a movie that was made to stand as a human testament, this is it.",10,5,7,4 December 2019
Unbreakable," These are mediocre times, Mrs. Dunn
","Develop the important characters.
Raise the 'What if...?' questions.
Execute with heart.
(Get great graphic novel artists, great actors, great script, great directing and great cinematography).
After doing all of the above, you won't have to travel to another universe and watch the man of steel fighting the man in black for all eternity in order to see great superhero portraits.",10,1,2,13 August 2018
Green Room," First song of their set...
","Is the script quite unrealistic? Yes, it is fiction. Are the actors and actresses any good? Yes, they rock. Is it a serious film? Yes, it's a mixture between thriller and comedy (subtle).
Not every movie functions like Magnolia or Adaptation. I thought it was a good rush, smartly directed and edited.",8,1,2,6 April 2019
Spider-Man 2," The only superhero movie I'd buy
","Perhaps I'm writing this review in the time where there's too many blah blah superhero movies.I remember when it first came out and I was young and went to the cinema. I can quote it as one of the highlights of my life.Genres shouldn't define what an artist (in this case, filmmakers, actors and staff) wants to say.
When you see this film you're not watching a superhero bang bang-die, evil-cash in blockbuster; you're watching a very human story with scenes that'll stay in your heart and mind forever.",10,3,4,23 July 2019
Cast Away," Seen it a thousand times, now I get it
","Caught it today on cable halfway.
It draws you in.
Picture composition is astonishing, I guess that's just nature untouched.
Tom Hanks did a hell of a job going through all of the emotions of the character with nothing but his eyes and body language, not only on the island but back home too.It is to expect that poor movie goers will fall flat on the surface of the coconut and lack the patience and effort to crack it open and delight themselves with its heavenly waters. That is to say, to not see the island as a metaphor.
Isn't life an island, limited, physically?
Is Chuck crying for a ball or for a friend? Isn't a friend someone who is the object of our hopes and joys?The lose-lose monologue he has drinking with a friend, talking about his former girlfriend is perhaps the moment the character's deeper understanding of life occurs.There's also a very tasteful (for its subtleness) criticism to the run-market-money-global-news-no time to think-way of life ('the dream'). 'But it's a hell of an advertisement of FEx and Wilson!' Is it not mocking them?I also really like the end. 'Unknown this way. Unknown this way. Unknown this way. Home.'",10,2,3,29 October 2019
Mother!," Feast, critics...
","Take the burning body of this mother!
Drink her tears!
Eat every metaphor!
Let the actors overcrowd the stage and tear it down!
Let the eye of the beholder do the old trick!
But don't think for a second this book hasn't got words washed upon its pages...",10,0,5,12 March 2020
Alien: Covenant," A wink to the gods
","All of those crying and stamping single stars could set their lights to focus on at least the seed of a film as clever as this one...I'm loving the way in which the sci-fi side is expanding, still keeping the blood flowing. Love the ancient statues living alongside stunning future technology.
I just wish there'd be more butterflies and green meadows (in order to create contrast and heighten the darks that are already there).It's a well crafted sci-fi movie. Full of winks to the giants of the genre (film and literature). Funny characters included (stereotypes that are subtly criticized). There could be more depth though in the emotional and psychological level of the characters (a great acting hero, maybe?).I'm pretty sure the next one has the potential of becoming a classic.",8,3,5,28 November 2018
