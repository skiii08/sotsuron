Who Framed Roger Rabbit," Brilliant - for 15 minutes
","It is impossible not to enjoy Roger Rabbit for its inventiveness...but after that, what else is left? You certainly don't care about the characters. Roger himself is extremely annoying for the most part. In fact, the best part of the film for me was the beginning... about 5 full minutes of pure cartoon fun, between Roger and a baby - reminiscent of the kinds of situations that we usually see Wile E; Coyote getting himself into. It was a scream. Bu then the rest of the film takes over, an d after the first few minutes of being amazed at the technical slight of hand...it begins to go downhill. By two-thirds of the way through, I was barely paying attention any more. The only thing that kept me awake was trying to see how many different cartoon characters I could recognize and remember where they came from originally.So all in all, I couldn't find myself capable of giving it more than a 5... if I were voting on the first 5 minutes I would have given it a 9; if I were voting just on technical merit i would give it a 10... but as a whole? I much preferred Peter Pan or Mary Poppins or Ratatouille",5,14,26,12 October 2007
Training Day," major problem with this film
","Warning! SPOILERS galore!I was genuinely interested in this film to begin with... and I absolutely loved the acting of both Denzel Washington and Ethan Hawke.BUT - about three quarters of the way through this thing I could no longer suspend disbelief.There are just too many things that accumulate for this film to be taken as seriously as it could have been...Yes, there are rogue cops out there. That is not my problem with this film. It probably comes extremely close to the truth when showing how corrupt the cops can be - and also probably very close to what the streets and their scum are like.The problem is with what happens to Ethan Hawke during the day in the life ... First problem. He smokes some pot laced with crack. He is totally out of his head... but probably not long enough to be realistic. He should probably have been almost totally knocked out for several hours... but it seems like only an hour or so after being high he is charging down a street and capturing totally by himself two would-be rapists... Not bloody likely. (And while I'm at it, I can't imagine real cops walking away from the perps leaving them with their handcuffs on... they would have at least taken back their equipment!Please remember that one of the rapists kicks Ethan in the side at least two or three times during their scuffle. Second: Ethan gets beaten up a second time by the hoods in the house where he is left by Washington. Sorry, but anyone who has been beaten up once by rapists and then beaten up a second time by these hoods would have been barely able to walk or do anything for the rest of the night. But not Ethan... he goes after Washington, and not only gets into a tumbledown fight that should ALSO have left him totally unable to move - but he actually jumps off a roof onto the windshield of a moving car and is STILL able to walk and operate on a pretty high level. Sorry, but if anyone reading this has ever taken even a quarter of the punishment Ethan does in this film, they would know that he would have been inoperative for most of the day... and certainly not in any shape to get through the last quarter hour of this film; Like, who is this guy, anyway? Superman?Third: How many 4 year old kids do you know that would trust a guy he's never met more than his own father? How many women who greet their man the way Washington's girlfriend (wife?) does when they stop off for lunch - would abandon him so quickly near the end? She grabs up her kid but does nothing to help protect Washington... and there is no explanation of why.I could go on - but why bother? There are so many holes in this film that although I liked much of it - and could believe the angle of the rogue cops etc... there is just no way that someone like Ethan would have been able to physically make it through this day.Oh, and by the way - in a town of how many millions, what would the odds be that the ONE 14 year-old girl who Ethan saves from being raped would turn out to be related to one of the hoods who is supposed to have killed him for Washington? Oh, come on! That is the weakest part of the entire plot. Could anyone who took two seconds to THINK really accept such a corny device? One would have better odds trying to win the lottery!All of this means that the film is really pretty stupid - or taking its audience for dunces... The only reason I gave this film a 6 instead of a 4 is because it is well-shot and well- acted.",6,3,8,10 March 2008
Brokeback Mountain," Comparing the wonderful film Maurice to Brokeback Mountain
","Has anybody noticed that the film Maurice (198 by James Ivory) and Brokeback Mountain have basically the same theme? Clive is the Ennis character, and Maurice is the more daring Jack. Although Maurice (the film) concentrates more on Maurice (the person), Brokeback concentrates more on the Clive kind of figure in Ennis. Both Ennis and Clive (played by Hugh Grant!)are too afraid of breaking convention to really allow themselves to imagine living with the person they love. Both basically refuse the other. The coldness of Ennis for his wife is mirrored in Clive's for HIS wife. And so on. I personally think that despite all the hype about Brokeback, Maurice is really the better film. In fact, Ang Lee is as reticent in his film style as Ennis is in his life. Ang Lee (sort of) shows us sex, shows them hugging a lot...but the scene in college between Maurice and Clive where Maurice is slowly stroking Clive's hair and Clive slowly becomes aroused is far hotter and more sensual than anything in Brokeback. And the scene of Maurice and Clive in the hotel is more realistic and even includes (tasteful) full frontal nudity. Maurice was a big budget film that dared (in 1987) far more than Ang Lee does in 2005... Perhaps Ang Lee was afraid of scaring away the heterosexual males, but Maurice seems to have done all right at thebox office anyway. It was nominated for an Academy Award, and won Best Actor at the Venice Film Festival (where Brokeback won for Best Film).Watch the scene where Clive declares his love for Maurice and Maurice is shocked. There is more in the one look that Maurice gives Clive than in half of what Brokeback expresses. We never really get to understand in Brokeback how horrified Ennis or Jack might have felt about their feelings for each other. They seem more afraid of what OTHERS think rather than what they feel themselves. But that one extraordinary look of horror by Maurice when Clive says 'I love you' shows that Maurice has to come to grips with himself before he can begin to come to grips with the prejudices of the society around him. Ennis was afraid to let himself go, but I never got the sense that he was disgusted with his desire for Jack. And that is why I think Maurice is more interesting. The character of Maurice develops continually, adapting to the challenges presented, even if Clive doesn't. In Brokeback, in fact, nobody seems to move forward at all over 20 years of existence. Hard to believe, especially since much of it takes place after Stonewall, when the gay liberation movement was in full swing. But above all, I think Maurice is the better film because I believe the desire between Maurice and Clive, and later between Maurice and Scudder, to be more realistically portrayed than what I saw between Ennis and Jack in Brokeback. This does not surprise me, because, after all, Maurice is a gay film made by a gay director, whereas Ang Lee is straight. It seems normal to me that James Ivory was able to make Maurice more sensual and erotic, all the while being just as 'controlled' as Ang Lee, simply because he, as a gay man, was more tuned in to gay eroticism... Anybody else out there agree with me that Maurice is the better film?",Null,5,27,25 January 2006
Empire of the Sun," insufferable
","At one point in the film, an American says to the young Christian Bale 'You're beginning to get on my nerves'. Well, that just about sums it up. The kid babbles incessantly and all I wanted to do was stuff a sock in his mouth. Not only that but there is very little that is believable about this child. Yes, he likes planes, but how many kids, in the middle of a crowd hysteria scene are gonna be playing with a toy plane rather than trying to escape like everyone else? Or how about when he goes back to his home and finds it empty - he just takes up residence until all the canned food is gone before even thinking about trying to find help. There is something so insufferable about this child that, try as I might, I never cared about him at all. He seemed totally self-involved - even concerning his parents. I'm not putting down Christian Bale here as much as I am the script that he is forced to follow. Same problem in a sense with John Malkovitch. He is basically a scurrilous character - but it is difficult to decide exactly what we are supposed to think about him. At one point he just completely abandons the kid - but that doesn't stop the kid from thinking they are 'friends'... doesn't hold together at all. Children understand disloyalty... instead of mistrusting him the kid does everything he can to please him. He finds a far more suitable mentor in the doctor - but is continually drawn back to Malkovitch. Not very believable at all. In the end, I only watched half of the film before a glitch in my copy stopped me from seeing the second half. I was relieved rather than peeved.",Null,7,15,29 September 2007
28 Days Later...," stupid premise
","The problem with this film is that it isn't at all logical. First, if the infected people are all so ill and throwing up blood and not eating, where do they get all their energy to rampage like they do? More important, why are they always attacking those who are not infected, but never attacking each other? These two problems make this movie a totally ridiculous one, and what originally began as a tightly wound cautionary tale of the dangers and the results of scientific genetic manipulation degenerates into a remake of the Night Of The Living Dead. By the end it was just silly. Nevertheless the scenes of London devoid of people were extremely eerie and filled with atmosphere and horror; They were the best thing about the movie.",4,1,2,5 January 2006
Enemy at the Gates," realistic, believable, perfect
","The tension underlying this film begins with the opening sequence and is repeated over and over again. Of all the war films I have ever seen, I think this one captures the horror, the misery, the dangers, the surreal gravity and the relentlessness of war better than any other. The basic feeling is that no-one will get out of it alive, and if some of them do, it is not for cinematic but rather historical reasons.If I really force myself, I can probably come up with one or two criticisms of this film, but they would be minor in nature. The sets, the cinematography, the script, the performances are all so perfectly executed that I cannot think of anything that jars... it all seems totally inevitable and perfect. There is nothing more to say!",9,0,1,26 September 2006
Lord of War," Another Lord of the Flies
","This film caught me from the opening credits. Visually stunning and innovative, it is anchored in its cynical but all-too-true black humour... and is one of the best ensemble casts I've seen in a long time. I don't think there is a bad performance in the entire film: quite the contrary, you believe everyone. Yuri (Nicholas Cage) is from the very first a fraud... masquerading first as a Jew and then as a shipping magnate... he is in fact an arms dealer who is particularly good at his work. His brother (played by Jared Leto in one of his best performances ever) is a lost coke-head who, despite everything still manages to have a sense of humanity that has escaped his brother. Saddest of all is the 'good guy' - Ethan Hawke, who is trying to do some good in this horror story called reality; he is incessantly idealistic - but, as we see in the most cynical (and possibly true) final minutes ever put onto the screen, his idealism is shown to be totally ineffectual when faced with 'raison d'état' power and greed. Despite moments of almost flippant humour, the underlying feeling that runs through this film is the unrelenting desire for power, which as we all know corrupts. The jovial menace of an African warlord is one of the most chilling performances I've seen on film in decades... mainly because it is so underplayed but reeking with the banality of evil. Played by Eamann Walker - recently of OZ fame - they couldn't have found a better person to play this part.He has a charisma which makes him riveting and all too believable. Perhaps the most telling thing about this film is that it leaves you with a sinking feeling that not only are the events on screen pretty much true, but that there is no way to stop or improve the situation. We are all headed to oblivion with such men loose in the world - and this film makes it all too plain that it is only a matter of time before chaos will reign supreme, and that there will be not much hope left in the world for the future. Lord of the Flies, indeed!",8,0,1,21 May 2008
