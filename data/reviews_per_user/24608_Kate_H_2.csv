The Devil's Advocate," Has its good moments, but it mostly annoying
","(Possible spoilers)The idea/concept in itself was not bad, so this movie left me disappointed thinking how much better it could have been. As big a Matrix fan as I am, I have to say Keanu's acting kind of made the movie seem worse than it actually was. Lucky for Al Pacino, incredibly charismatic as always, or I might not have finished watching the movie at all.Mary-Ann's (Theron) nightmare about the baby was one of my favorite scenes, and I think if the whole movie would have had that dark/disturbing tone about it, it would have been much better and less forgettable. The ending mostly ruined the whole thing for me. What's up with all the flames and Milton (Pacino) screaming 'nooooooooo' at the top of his lungs?
Decent attempt, but kind of missed the point. 6/10",Null,0,1,13 March 2004
Finding Nemo," Heartwarming and beautifully animated, Finding Nemo is one of the best movies out there
","Finding Nemo is, as far as I know, the first animated movie that has real value for adults as well as kids. And not in the way that most kid films do, that are merely bearable and faintly amusing at best to anyone above the age of 14. Finding Nemo has a couple of essentials for all age groups: for kids, there is the moral of the story, the cute and funny characters (think the albatros and the turtle), and of course the happy ending. For adolescents and grown-ups, there are contemporary movie references, and more 'grown-up' jokes that might be hard to grasp for little kids. The amazing animation is always a huge added bonus for anyone who really pays attention to the movie, and would be worth going to the movies for even if the story was only so-so and the dialogue boring. I know this whole age-group thing because after finally convincing my cousins, who are both boys (ages 10 and 12), to go with me, they watched it and actually enjoyed it. So did a very large part of people my age (16) and my parents have actually seen it twice. Finding Nemo is a truly great move, and perfect to watch when you don't want to see something complicated, but are more in the mood for something uplifting yet still with substance.9/10",10,0,3,19 November 2004
