Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," Lucas has gone over to the dark side...
","Now before I start I want to make it clear that I am a huge Star Wars fan. I love the original trilogy and have seen it many times.  It is one of the classics of film history.  Not so with the first installment of the prequel trilogy...Why for the love of all that's good and pure did Lucas decide to direct the actors himself? The man may have many talents, but getting the best out of his actors aint one of them. 'The Empire Strikes Back', arguably the best movie of the trilogy, was not directed or even written entirely by Lucas. This also goes for 'Jedi'.  The only one of the original 3 that he wrote and directed by himself was the 'Star Wars' and the acting is a little stiffer then the other 2 (I know to some this is sacrilege, but watch it again and watch Mark Hamil closely and you'll know what I mean).
I don't know why Lucas would decide to direct and write these movies himself when the best ones were done with help from others. Lucas's talent was always the special effects. And with that lead in we get to the 5 big reasons why I absolutely HATED this movie:1. The ACTING (or lack there-of): Holy crap! This movie reminded me of a High School play.  Wait, that's not fair! I've seen some really good high school plays.  If you're gonna hire a kid to play a young Darth Vader MAKE SURE THEY CAN ACT!!!! I don't care how cute they are (By the way...Yippee!? What the hell is that?! No self respecting kid says Yippee!). Ewen McGreggor and Sammie L. were pretty much the only 2 who can claim the title of actor in this movie, and even they gave disappointing performances. Now I do feel sorry for the man who has to fill in Alec Guinness's shoes, but the best way to deal with it is to give your own performance and not an Obi Wan impersonation. I also feel sorry for Sammie L. cause he is a good actor, I just don't think he had a lot to work with...which brings me to my second point:2. The PLOT (or-again-lack there-of): This really bugged me about the story so I'll include it here: Why did they feel it necessary to explain where the force comes from? They didn't in the previous three and that was just fine. You set up rules for the Universe your story takes place in and the audience understands those rules.  The Force exists. It doesn't need a reason. Anyone who can't deal with it without an explanation probably wouldn't really enjoy the movie anyway. Anywho, end that rant for another one: Can we say NON EXISTENT plot?!? Can we say VIDEO GAME marketing?!? Can we say excuses for copious amounts of CGI?!? Oh look! A lead in to my third point...3. The SPECIAL EFFECTS: Yes they were cool, blah blah blah...does anyone else miss the days when people had to WORK to get cool special effects, not just type code into a computer? CGI looks really fake when not done properly.  It looks all shiny.  That was the problem with this movie.  The thing I find sad is that in the 70's, when the original 'Star Wars' came out they managed to put together cooler (and more convincing) special effects. Plus the aliens, while muppets, still held my attention longer.  Yay! It moves so neatly to my fourth point:4.The ALIENS: what the hell is the deal with the aliens with accents?!? In the original movies the aliens either spoke English or another language. They did not have TERRIBLE accents.  The trade guild/union (whatever) aliens I dubbed 'the French-Canadian Chinese Fish'. Man could my french teacher do a good impression of them. Why not just have subtitles? Does Lucas think we are unable to READ? I'll take subtitles over bad Jamaican accents any day. Which brings me to my fifth and final point...5. JAR-JAR: I hate him.  I despise him. I wanted to take a light saber and lop his head off.  I wish Obi Wan had. How could anyone think that Jar-Jar would be funny? You know what would have been funny?...His painful and agonizing death. He was too moronic to be a good character and destroyed a lot of the point of Star Wars.  In the original movies our heroes worked hard to achieve victory.  In Phantom Menace Jar-Jar falls on his ass to single-handedly win a battle. It's mind boggling. It hurts me. I hate you Jar-Jar. (I am reminded of 'the Simpsons' where the comic book guy is sleeping with a Jar-Jar doll and says, 'Oh Jar-Jar, everyone hates you but me.' So true, so true.)Despite this, the movie did really well.  I guess we were all so starved for move Star Wars that we attempted to ignore that overall crappyness of 'Phantom Menace', or perhaps its because this proved that obscene amounts of CGI can triumph over a thin, poorly written plot and bad acting any day.",2,0,1,4 September 2003
"South Park: Bigger, Longer & Uncut"," The vulgar and ridiculous sometimes get to the heart of matters...
","This is my comfort movie. When I'm sick, when I'm tired, when I've had a bad day, this movie makes me feel better. It's on my personal Top 10 List of Awesome, and I can't think of Juvenilian Satire done better.Yes, this movie is crude, and rude, and other words that end in 'ude'. That is kind of the point. South Park always has, and continues to, point out the ridiculousness of our world in a blunt and disgusting way. They point out, and play with, taboos and things we're not 'supposed' to joke about.I could go on about the parallels in this movie to the initial responses Stone and Parker received making South Park. I could talk about how the movie points out the ridiculous double-standard that Hollywood has regarding content; how the MPAA, and many others, believe that hearing profanity or seeing sexual content will have a greater damaging effect on the population than seeing glorified, gratuitous violence that dehumanizes the on-screen victims. I could even talk about the excellent use of the adults in South Park as representatives of the mob mentality, as well as a population that is complacent in allowing TV to raise their children until they hear something they don't like. I could write essays. I'm sure people already have. South Park is a smart show, and the movie is no exception. Many people can't get past the vulgarity, which is a real shame. They are truly missing out on excellent social commentary.What I will says is all this movie needed to win me over was Stan's opening ensemble number and Satan's insecure neediness and Disney Heroine-esque solo. And neither of those songs holds a candle to 'La Resistance.' If you're uninterested in reading too much into the message or purpose of your movies, this is a hilarious musical parody from start to finish. There is a ton of pay-off for fans of the series, which doesn't get in the way of new-comers enjoying the film.",9,0,0,27 February 2011
Star Wars: Episode II - Attack of the Clones," And now the darkside has claimed Lucas entirely...
","If you've read my review for 'Phantom Menace' you'll know I was not impressed.  As a Star Wars fan I feel cheated. If this movie was made for 'the audience of today' then can I be transported back in time or something? I'd rather wear bad 80's fashions then be told that 'Attack of the Clones' is what appeals to 'my generation'.Bad writing, bad acting, Jar-Jar (however briefly), all go to making this one of the worst movies ever(Phantom Menace still tops it).And on behalf of Vancouver I would like to apologise for Hayden Christianson.  I'm Sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry! I'm embarrassed for Vancouverites everywhere.My main problem with this movie was the dialouge. 'I've died a little every day since you came back' and 'I hate sand. I like it here where things are [strokes Amidala's arm] smooth' and 'I love you, truely, madly'(was anyone else expecting her to say 'deeply' and then see Savage Garden appear and start singing?).Who writes this drivel? Oh wait...Lucas! GET SOMEONE ELSE TO HELP WRITE THE THIRD MOVIE!!!!!!! *Ahem* I can't take anymore of this terrible terrible dialouge. I couldn't even pay attention to the plot cause the dialouge kept getting in the way so I honestly don't know if it was any good.I again must say that the special effects did not help the movie at all. We should rename this movie this movie 'Attack of the Bad CGI'. I detest poorly done, shiny CGI. It does NOT look more real.  Star Wars ANH is more convincing.The yoda fight scene in all of its cheesey glory could not save this movie (plus that scene gets really old really fast).All I have left to say is that I laughed so hard in theatres that everyone else stopped trying to be polite and was laughing too. Bad Dialouge people. Bad.",3,1,2,4 September 2003
Van Helsing," I almost died laughing...
","Yes, this movie is pure garbage. The plot makes no sense, they don't explain anything, they randomly travel around, and the acting is truly appalling. But.BUT.This movie rocks. I'm going to go buy it. It's funnier than most comedies. And there's so many games to play! Count the number of times Beckinsale is grabbed by the weird!flying!vampires. Count the times Beckinsale's bro falls in a river. Count the number of accent changes. Count the minutes until they finally put the movie's NAME on the screen.The costumes are ridiculous, with Beckinsale looking like some strange S&M fantasy and Jackman looking like he's trying to edge out Fabio for Haliquin poster boy. And the acting! Oh, the acting... someone read the definition of melodrama on set, and no one understood.And Dracula walks on the ceiling. All the time. Clearly floor is not good enough for this cat. And as far as Ham of the Year Awards, this guy takes the cake. He's the best part of the movie.I loved every nonsensical second of this movie. It should be shown in film classes. Here's what happens when people have a big budget, big actors, and big effort and yet still fail utterly. Amazing.",Null,1,3,11 September 2008
Transformers: Revenge of the Fallen," I seem to recall taking Transformers into sand was a bad idea...
","What an appalling piece of tripe.Michael Bay is a hack. If there is any justice in the world, he will one day be kidnapped by people with actual talent. They will force him to watch his movies over and over in a Clockwork Orange chair until they break the soul he clearly doesn't have.As someone who loves movies of all genres, Transformers 2 offends me on a deep personal level. Michael Bay's latest opus is a testament to the dark, greedy, soulless side of the movies. Anything for a buck, lowest common denominator, pandering to the base nature of humanity, crap.That bad? Oh yes. And its insidious. There were 2 things in this movie that were better than the first one. The transformers transformed more slowly so you could actually see it happen... well, you would be able to if it didn't also look like the movie was edited in a wood chipper. The Transformers also had more personality, which was an improvement over last movie where the only way to tell which giant robot was Optimus was to look for the Mac Truck.However, there is a dark side to these new personality-filled robots. The appearance of Amos and Andy in robot form was awful. Nothing like 2 buck-toothed, illiterate, bumbling, stereotypes to affirm that Michael Bay is either completely racist or completely naive. His comment that, 'they're robots,' is moronic. And Jar Jar is just an alien.There was so much action it was sort of like an assault which got increasingly tiring. Yeah, the special effects were pretty and the explosions were loud, but 2 hours and 40 minutes of straight Michael Bay action was incredibly boring. Part of that is his style. The aforementioned wood chipper editing does not help anything. You can barely see whats going on. Despite the loudness, I fell asleep. Twice. In a theatre seat. I've never been that bored in a movie in my life. And it was 2 hours and 40 friggin minutes long! Indulgent and vapid. There was not enough movie to justify it being that long.The problem is the movie is all surface. There is an overly complicated plot, which really doesn't need to be there at all. Why explain giant killer robots in such depth? To appease the fan boys? I doubt that'll happen. They're already angry. And the plot is not engrossing. The characters are irritating. All the humor is fart and testicle jokes. The dialog... I'm actually in the process of repressing it, but robots + declarative = bad news bears. Out of self defense Michael Bay has to rely on fiery explosives and robots hitting each other with trees. He is incapable of every part of making a movie that is not special effects.There was a love story, which mostly involved Megan Fox bending over and pouting and then her face spiraling around near the end in a completely mystifying moment. Of course, to show how epic the love was, Bay decides to spiral around our couple in 360 camera shots that directors don't generally use. They don't use them because they are disorienting for the audience and considered amateurish. So after 5 straight minutes of rotating cameras I was ready to vomit, and it wasn't entirely the revolting meditations on saying I wuv oo first from Shia and Fox.You know, I can't actually do this movie justice. It was that bad. It was everything I hate in a movie. Everything. I think I died a little inside last night.And Michael Bay? Please do not rape anymore of my childhood memories. I can't take it. You should be ashamed of yourself.",2,10,23,27 June 2009
Identity," Really good until the last 30 seconds...
","THIS REVIEW CONTAINS A SPOILERI was sitting in the movie theatre, incredibly pleased with Identity. Incredibly pleased, that is until Timmy, movie wrecker in 4 and a half feet, waltzed on scene and said, 'whores don't get a second chance.' To quote the comic book guy, 'worst ending ever.'  I was perfectly happy with the killer that was revealed earlier (who I won't reveal because to me that was the real end of the movie).  I was perfectly happy with the movie up until the point where the sole (or so u think) survivor is hanging washing on a line. It should have been cut there.  End scene.  Why the homicidal child? It's so overdone and in this case badly done.  One would think there would be some clue that little Timmy is daemon spawn, but no.  He seems to be a perfectly normal kid.  I'm all for surprise endings, but they need to be realistic. Other then that Identity was great. I loved all of the twists.  I supposed thats what makes me so mad.  The movie didn't need another plot twist.  It was twisty enough. It seems as though some hack writer was sitting there one day and though, 'Hey, lets make Timmy the murderer! No one'll see that coming!' Of course we won't. It doesn't make sense! So to all of you who haven't seen it (and are still reading this review with a spoiler) walk out when you see someone hanging washing on a line.  You'll be glad you did. You'll escape Timmy and his fantastic movie ruining powers.",6,1,1,29 April 2003
Dodgeball," Surprisingly hilarious...
","I have to admit, I was worried. C'mona movie about a dodge ball team? But my intense love of Alan Tudyk spurred me to see this movie. I was expecting Zoolander...but crappy. I was pleasantly surprised.This movie is actually more intelligent then it lets onthere were more than a few clever references (Deus ex Machina for oneMaginot line [sp?] for another) and not a small amount of Nazi-bashing sub-text.That being said, this is not an overall intelligent movie. It's about dodge ball. People get hit in the groin. A lot. There's a guy named Steve the Pirate. It has a cameo by William Shatner. Do not, DO NOT look for cinematic genius. However, I still loved it. It was hilarious. The random sports they made upsquirrel water skiing, midget tossing...*snicker* And that they weren't afraid to go to the disturbing place...with pizza...it was really quite funny.Why am I raving? I had ultra-low expectations. It made me laugh solidly from opening to closing credits. Good times.And now, to rave about my reason for attending the movie: Alan Tudyk. Yes, he played a man who thought he was a pirate. He played a character that the writers were clearly high when they thought up, but (SPOILERS AHEAD)****** ...when he was hurt and made fun of...well I actually felt bad. I felt bad for the freaking pirate-man! I was amazed that any actor could do anything with that part. That he could create an emotional connection impressed me. I mean, the guy was a freaking pirate-wannabe! ******END SPOILERSDon't think that I'm easily impressed by movies. I'm not. Normally a movie like Dodgeball would get nothing but scorn and derision from me...but I really enjoyed it. Definitely a great bad movie. Anyone who needs a laugh, go, don't expect too much, and enjoy!",8,0,0,19 June 2004
