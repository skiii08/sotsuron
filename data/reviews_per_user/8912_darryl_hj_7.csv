The King's Speech," A fantastic story, beautifully told
",Throughout the movie the acting was superb as the casting was flawless. These combine with considered to provide a tender insight into such a historic moment.Geoffrey Rush was every bit as good in this as Colin Firth.,8,1,1,10 September 2019
Juno," Such a great soundtrack
","The movie is good, but the whimsical, silly and offbeat soundtrack is just perfect for the movie.Ellen Page was very good too.",7,0,0,15 October 2019
Capote," Hoffman truly brilliant
","A story worthy of a movie, but I feel it was a bit too long, and despite the excellent acting from everyone - it just falls short due to the pacing.I think more of Trumans life could have been shared, rather than such a narrow period of what was also a complex man's life.",7,0,0,20 September 2019
"Three Billboards Outside Ebbing, Missouri"," Brilliant!
","Not much to fault; but the script is absolutely fantastic, the lines are realistic, believable - and more often than not hilarious.",8,1,3,21 September 2019
Get Out," Brilliant acting, pace and an original story
","Excellent acting by a well chosen cast. I thought everything from the direction, the dialogue through to the development of the story was almost flawless too.A modern thriller with light horror elements at the end and soft humour throughout.",9,1,5,19 July 2019
It Chapter Two," Disappointed
",The film was sadly much too long and relied way too much on CGI rather than the storyline.A few characters introduced who did nothing other than occupy time too.,4,1,1,20 September 2019
Vicky Cristina Barcelona," Barcelona is even more beautiful than the movie stars
","As a frequent visitor to Barcelona this movie reminds me of the charming aura of Barcelona, its flowered gardens and charming streets. Against this backdrop is some excellent acting from the three main actors (Who shared nominations between them) and a smooth, soft sense of direction.A few wasted scenes and I feel the ending was a bit lacking of real drama - but a smart, upmarket romantic movie with an unpinning of humour.",8,0,0,16 September 2019
