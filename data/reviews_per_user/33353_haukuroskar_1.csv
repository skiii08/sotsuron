Howl's Moving Castle," Best anime film I've seen... then again, the only anime film I've seen...
","The animation: (10/10)As usually I like the animation of all anime, it's just cool! What I liked specially in this movie is the 3-D effects which are very well done and blend in with the surroundings and look almost like they were drawn.The Plot: (10/10)Well when I saw the first glimpse I thought: 'Here we go again, Boy meets girl and quickly leaves, someone get's jealous, hurts girl, boy helps girl...' But It was more than that, there the twist with Calcifer, Madam Suliman's story, the war going on, Turnip and I can go on and on...The action: (9/10)I can't say there was very much action in the movie until the end but it sure wasn't lame! My personal favorite part was Howl in the black room (first time).That was my review on Hauru no ugoku shiro (Howl's moving castle). I saw the movie in Japanese with English subtitles.",10,2,3,3 October 2005
