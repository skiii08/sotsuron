Hereditary," BAD ENDING RUINS ENTIRE MOVIE
","It seems like a good movie, but when the ending is so hideously bad, nothing can excuse it. The ending is pitiful. It is a copout. The entire movie has NOTHING to do with uncovering secrets of heredity. It doesn't even deserve a 'It had potential' because it doesn't. There was nothing missing that would have fixed it which is required for such a statement. The only thing to fix it is to completely rewrite it. The ending (by ending, I mean both the explanation for all that we watched plus the ending itself) was such a stupid satanic piece of horse manure born straight out of the 70s satanic string of idiotic horror movies. Some were good back then, but they sure are trite now. If you want to invest your emotions into a movie which does not pay up, go for it.",4,1,4,29 June 2018
The Hunger Games," Great Adaptation
","Reading all the ratings here you would never know this was a great movie. I was curious after many years had passed and had a chuckle seeing only 7.2 score with hordes of haters complaining that it wasn't Battle Royale.You know why it wasn't Battle Royale?Because it is Hunger Games you freaking idiots.And if you wish it was even darker and more violent, go watch SAW. or Human Centipede..that's where your true souls reside.Meantime, this is a great movie that even certain kids can watch with parental guidance.. family viewing which is for kids who b benefit by early education into the complexities of social wars, without putting SAW or Human Centipedes in their faces, while being dark enough, colorful enough, complex enough to entertain the adult appetite.Highly recommended.",9,4,4,26 September 2019
Suicide Squad," Roller Coaster!
","This was great! Don't listen to the stupid nerdy comic book fanatics who wouldn't know how to read a real novel if their lives depended on it. This movie had dark and light, fun and drama, laughs and tears, suspense and comic relief. I loved every moment of it. If you love movies, adventures, action, and fantasy, enjoy it. If you are a diehard never got out of your mom's basement comic book fanatic, let go of your ego and you'll enjoy it too. The people who won't find this review helpful will be the ones who couldn't let go of their basement fostered egos.",8,0,0,20 January 2019
