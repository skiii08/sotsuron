The Devil's Advocate," The Devil as a firm executive!
","This film would have been much better without the introduction of the devil as a person and just concentrate in plain common human evil. Then the characters would've been more real and trustworthy and the film would've gain from it because then they would've had no specialization to be identified with. Like, Al Pacino has the role of the devil and acts like one as everyone is expecting, he is the devil and therefore he is evil, there is no surprise in that. But if he would've been a human being (an evil one), that would've been surprising and much more effective to the plot. And then the film would've jump up from horror to drama, a much better account from my point of view. It's a pity it was not like that, because otherwise the acting and directing was superb, but there is always the possibility of making a new film......",4,0,2,9 December 2014
A Star Is Born," AN INSULT TO THE BEAUTIFUL ENGLISH LANGUAGE
","I am aware that this is an appealing film for the most; other viewers with reason criticized the structure and mostly the plot of the film. I got confused, but now it is some time I have been in the USA, perhaps things have changed since the last time for the better. I saw this film hoping that it was going to be a clarifying experience. I have not seen the first two versions, but I saw the third with Streisand and Kristofferson and I thought it was great at the time, so I wanted to give this one a shot and compare mostly for the sake of the art of filming. You know like you have seen different versions of certain iconic themes in painting or hearing different versions of let's say the 5th of Beethoven or the Four Seasons of Vivaldi and you find interesting to appreciate the qualities of each of them, while some have certain faults or virtues in certain passages is often theme of discussion with other enthusiasts. While I find this version interesting is mostly because I wanted to find out what was wrong with it. There was something that bothered me and it was certainly not the story because in principle it was the same story as all the other versions, so after seeing it several times, eureka! I found that the script is wrong because it is repetitive, boring and full with clichés that unfortunately all in all give a negative result. I have nothing against the use of vulgarity in drama because that's what we usually do isn't it? At least that's what this film is trying desperately to convey at least among country, rock and pop musicians, and I mean desperately because of the constant use of the F word. I mean I have nothing against the use of the word in drama, but when in a sentence with let's say 20 words, 5 are the F word; that causes some kind of a degenerative effect in the language because it's misleading the real meaning of the plot. My conclusion, the version with Streisand and Kristofferson is still the best.",1,3,5,27 February 2019
Wind River," Beautiful winter landscape but missing in the details.
","This movie promised a lot. It had very good reviews and the trailer was exciting with beautiful snowy landscapes and nature. But after a few moments I realized that it wasn't what I had expected. The crime story is poorly developed where there is a clash of cultures who don't understand each other and as usual under the lines the Indians are the loosing part because in contrast to the whites they are emotional, erratic, vicious and full of strange believes. And even though there are a lot of potential criminals, the one that did it, you guessed right, it's the Indian! And women are portrayed also in a bad light, the female FBI investigator is naive, slow and clumsy, the two other ladies in the film are completely hopeless, both are self- destructive and the third just disappears from the film in an apparent accidental way. The hunter and hero of the film, kills wolves which obviously must be very old because instead of chasing wild animals as it's natural, they chase lams eating snow. And worst of all and this is the key and perhaps main theme of the whole film, our hero, this kind and warm man, when he catches the guilty murderer, instead of taking him to jail to be judged, he lets him freeze to death in the ice and snow, speak of personal vendetta!",1,2,8,12 November 2017
Dunkirk," It could've been better.
","I saw «Dunkirk» last night. I must say I was expecting something else, something more complete, something more complex, so actually I was disappointed. I was expecting to get to know more about Dunkirk like why it happened, the background, how come the French, Belgian and British armies got surrounded in that peculiar way and why the German army did not finished them off, after all, they only had to drive their tanks some miles forward and bomb them to pieces. Why did this not happen? What was the strategy that left the escaping armies completely defenseless to a powerful enemy? Were the Germans just being kind? I doubt it. Who in the end was responsible for this situation? They could've easily wiped out over 300000 troops. As anyone can see there are a lot of unanswered questions, and this film doesn't help, on the contrary. If the RAF was so infinitely superior to the Luftwaffe, how come the British were surrounded and trapped between enemy tanks and the sea? The film is short in answers and therefore I cannot put it in the category of Great War films. It falls merely as entertainment with shock effects. There are already a lot of critics that have mentioned the lack of character development, the problems with real-time following, and the sudden clipping from one scene to another without relation, so I will not stretch this anymore. But there is another thing that bothers me a bit and that is the lack of knowledge about the enemy. In most Great War films we get to know the enemy so we can be related to whom our film heroes are dealing with. Well in this film the enemy is practically anonymous. The Germans are completely non-existing! This film makes it very obvious the superiority of the great English Spitfire above the likes of the German Junkers-Stuka and Messerschmitt planes which makes it even more demanding to know more about why the British were defeated and pushed to escape in Dunkirk, this film does not make it easy in answers because Nolan insists to see things only from his own navel. This film could've been much better without breaking the budget too much with skipping repetitive scenes and making the enemy more visible. It seems that consequently the director of this film is avoiding getting to know the enemy. This mistake cuts the potential excitement that this film could've possessed. 'Stalag 17', 'The Great Escape' 'The Longest Day', 'Saving Private Ryan', 'A Bridge Too Far', 'Schindler's List', 'The Bridge on the River Kwai' all great war films precisely because we get to know the enemy and therefore increase the complexity and interest in the scope of the film. Unfortunately 'Dunkirk' is not one of these.",4,2,2,7 December 2017
Eyes Wide Shut," Bill is existing but not living, takes the world for granted.
","Unfortunately Kubrick didn't have the chance to finish this film. But if he had I'm sure we would've had a chance to grasp its meaning better. My guess, after having watched the film several times, is that Kubrick would've have wanted us to get the following message: Bill (Cruise) is living in a kind of virtual existence and doesn't appreciate what he has or better said what he has inherited as a member of the western civilization. Alice (Kidman) is portrayed as a victim in her role as a member of the woman gender. This comes clear as the film develops when we see how women are treated all along the film. If they are not nice, faithful and obedient housewives, they are hookers that can be bought and misused more or less like animals or slaves. It is their flesh we are interested in. Almost all of the main scenes in this film focus on these concepts. Bill ignores his wife until she confesses some thoughts and flirtations on other men. He reacts as if some of his possessions were about to be robbed and immediately tries to take revenge by being himself unfaithful to her. Suddenly she is real and exists but instead of giving her love, only tries to cheat on her in a miserable and in the end in a failed manner. Now, this is a very difficult theme for a film at any level and Kubrick as a perfectionist as he was, embarked it in an analytical level going slowly step by step, scene by scene systematically to make us understand the implications of the plot. Unfortunately this gives a rather theatric and passive feeling about the whole thing. It seems we are watching a heavy Ibsen theatric play from the 18th century and not a film that is supposed to be modern. This fact is also reflected on the end that is supposed to be a climax after all these steps. It is not, it is tame and disappointedly anticlimax. It is just showing us the indifference or the difficulty about solving the issues this film is dealing with. If just Kubrick had lived enough time to finish it properly.",7,1,2,2 January 2011
Sicario," Colombian Revenge Light
","This fictionalized story is surely based on events that have been press and news stuff, with more or less successful result from long time ago. And is probably based back in time when the war on drug-traffic supremacy was at its peak, when the Mexican kingpins took the lead in narco-traffic from the Colombian cartels, the traffic exploded in scope, volume and money value, and in consequence many cartels and narco groups were created to dominate each in their own region, with the unavoidable drug wars between these. It is also probable that it is based in more resent events when the Mexican police went tired of these wars and declared war on the cartels. It was a bold an daring action, but with not very good results because this new war actually developed even more crude and the number of deaths did not decrease, it went up on both sides and with negative consequences for the public. Unfortunately none of these issues are taken on the film even if the atmosphere and scenery superficially tells us about drugs and of course killings without even mentioning where and why they occur, they assume we have been reading the news. So in the end what is this film about? For me it was hard to tell, is it a film to show that chivalry and sense of justice among the arms of the law is in jeopardy? Is it a war between CIA and FBI? Or is it a story of revenge between Mexicans and Colombians? I must say it's all these things at the same time, and that's what in my opinion makes this film a little messy and hard to swallow. We see a lot of violence but in most scenes we don't know the motives or the reason for it, the film lacks to go in depth about this and without it, it just becomes another very violent film with some action. The dramatic scenes without action do not contribute to clarify what is going on, on the contrary. US squads are trying to get rid drug traffic from Mexico to USA but we really never know where the drugs are coming from or what kind of drugs. Is it marijuana? No because now it is allowed in many states in the USA and easily available. Is it cocaine from Peru or Bolivia? Is it heroin from Afghanistan? By whom and how came to Nogales? All these interesting questions remain unanswered and the film disintegrates in a personal family feud and vendetta. Which creates another controversy: a hit-man usually doesn't act with personal issues; otherwise the film should've been called 'Colombian Revenge Light' The scene when 'Sicario' dispatched a cartel boss is just not right these guys don't have 3 bodyguards they have dozens and dozens. The performances of the main actors are ambivalent. Emily Blunt is definitively miscast, and why is Josh Brolin laughing all the time? it doesn't have a reference of what is going on in the film or perhaps the script demanded a contrast figure from Benicio del Toro who is soooo serious all the time? It is a pity that with the resources used both material and human it could've become a good film to watch as long as it had resolved the above mentioned issues, but it's just another very dark, violent and eye shocking action film.",1,14,29,28 September 2015
Rear Window," It didn't work for me, the suspense was missing.
","I am aware that many people like this film a lot, and after many years it has indeed become a classic, and that's why I saw it for the first time yesterday. And I found it updated which is not very strange since we are talking about a film made in the early fifties. There is not much suspense in the plot mostly because as the story goes by, it is very obvious who the murderer is. The definition of suspense is: that the spectator should be guessing who the guilty person is, or even better: guessing who the bad guy is. In this film, we do know who the bad guy is, but we don't know if he really did it or not. Real suspense would have been that the guy that everyone thought that did it, in fact didn't, and that the one that looks innocent had done it. Now that would've been a twist! There are a couple of other things that killed the suspense in me. Why a man that is a photographer and tries to convince a policeman that his neighbour killed his wife and has no evidence and is looking through the window with a telephoto camera, doesn't take pictures of the scene of the crime and use them as evidence. And how come that a man that is going to murder his wife and cut her in small pieces doesn't draw down the window blinds so no one can see what he is doing and testify against him!?. But I have to admit, typically Hitchcock, delivers a proffesional job because he makes you see things that only a great director like him can. He will make you believe that Jeff and Lisa are absolutely right and everyone else is wrong just by watching this couple's attitude, created through their acting. And there is the strength of these actors; they are extremely reassuring in their personalities that as such, it impregnates the whole film. Just by the way they pose and sit and look you can almost smell that whatever they do is right. On the contrary, Thorwald hasn't a chance because from the very first scene he is doomed; he is the bad guy almost before the film has started. And I intuitively guessed it and killed all the suspense. I liked 'Vertigo' even if some scenes are a little bit slow and long and I liked 'Psycho', that's a masterpiece. But 'Rear Window' it's too obvious.",5,3,4,26 July 2015
Shall We Dance," Unintentionally funny.
","I know this film is from 2004, but it just happens that I have just seen it on TV. And it really made an impact on me, because first I thought it was extremely boring and I changed the channel several times, but there was nothing else worth seeing, I mean the alternative would've been the news! God help me, not on this time! So I had to continue watching the film and suddenly I thought it was very funny even though the film is not supposed to be funny, more like a light comedy. Some scenes were so ridiculous that I saw myself laughing both of the scene and the characters and the story. It's; you know like the middle aged professional lawyer that has an extremely boring family and job, he doesn't care for his wife but suddenly he sees a beautiful dance instructor through the train window which motivates him to change all his way of life. He just didn't know that he was a dancing talent like Fred Astaire or Gene Kelly! And this fabulous woman makes him see it just by swinging a little in the floor, and pang! he can dance Argentinian tango, American fox trot, waltz from Vienna, you name it; it was a miracle I was astonished. But I must admit it was a little frustrating that there is no real conclusion, I mean, like, there was this dancing contest that everybody was so interested inÂ….. and we never see the ending of it so we will never know who won the contest! Oh; I know, they are surely filming a 'Shall We Dance II' where we will know who won! So if you are bored go and look at it. Its surely worth the trouble to have your eyes open.",3,0,2,15 July 2017
