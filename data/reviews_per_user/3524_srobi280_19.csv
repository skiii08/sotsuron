Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," Why????
","Before this movie even came out, I already knew that it was going to have fancy computer-generated effects, and the technology in this movie will look more advanced than the original 3 episodes, even though this movie takes place way before. In other words, it makes it look like the technology has gotten more primitive. I thought I'd still give it a shot. When it came out on DVD, I rented it to see what it was like.The bad points: <ul><li>Anakin is an annoying little kid, and Jake Lloyd is a horrible actor in this movie </li></ul><ul><li>The special effects are way too fancy. Way too much computer animation. What ever happened to good old puppets? </li></ul><ul><li>The pod race scene is boring, even though it is supposed to be exciting </li></ul><ul><li>They call Anakin 'Annie' </li></ul><ul><li>The aliens aren't interesting at all </li></ul><ul><li>Jar Jar needs to be strangled </li></ul><ul><li>Darth Maul is only in the movie for a few minutes, and he hardly has any lines </li></ul><ul><li>The plot hardly makes any sense </li></ul><ul><li>I could continue this list for hours, but I think that about covers it.</li></ul>The good points: Wait, there aren't any! I seriously give myself lots of credit for being able to sit through this garbage even once, after which I said 'Never again'. I brought it back to Blockbuster and got a refund. I can't believe that this movie got 3 Oscar nominations, and another 11 wins and 48 nominations. This just shows how phony Hollywood really is. If you haven't seen it yet, do yourself a favor, and pop in one of the original 3 movies instead.",1,1,3,6 April 2006
Troy," Not historically accurate, but a great movie nonetheless
","Troy is not faithful to the Iliad, and is not historically accurate. However, it is a very enjoyable movie with excellent acting, great props and costumes, amazing cgi effects (did you really think they got that many people as extras in the armies?), and well-choreographed fight scenes. They only had 800 extras, and with the help of CGI, they got it to look like thousands of people. Brad Pitt puts in a great performance as Achilles. The casting in this movie couldn't have been better. The actors fit the characters they portray very well. The most stunning perhaps are the fight scenes. They are well choreographed, exciting, and action packed. The duel of Achilles against Hector was incredible. You can tell how angry Achilles is as he tries to slaughter him. You can feel his anger. Amazing performance. If you are a history buff, and it really bothers you if something is historically inaccurate, then by all means avoid this film. But if you are willing to see past that and enjoy this as the entertainment that it was meant to be, then watch it. You won't be disappointed.",10,6,12,12 April 2006
Brokeback Mountain," I thought it would be worse
","I actually thought this movie would be worse than it was. Its worth seeing once, but I must warn the viewer, it is intensely, extremely, and shockingly gay! And the scenes come with little to no warning. But I suppose thats the point, right? Basically two people herding sheep end up having a homosexual experience. They still claim 'I ain't queer.' But they end up becoming closer and closer to each other, and end up falling in love. Meanwhile, they both marry and have families, while seeing each other off and on. Since being gay is unacceptable in that time and place, they keep it a secret. Find out the rest for yourselves.",6,0,24,22 May 2006
The Terminator," Arnold's legendary performance
","I'm not going to go into detail about the plot, because most people know what it is. This is one of Arnold's best movies out there. This role was crafted to fit him perfectly. From the very beginning until the very end, the excitement and action don't let up. I watch this movie religiously. The plot is amazing, and the directing is incredible. I love the part where he punches right into the chest cavity of that punk. I also thought the part at the end where his skin melts off and he is coming after them was eerie. Perfect. This movie is a definite must-see!If you haven't seen it yet, do it now!",10,1,2,6 April 2006
Full Metal Jacket," Excellent movie, but...
","This movie is one of my favorites. I have never read the book, have never been to Vietnam, so I'm just gonna give you a review as I see it. The first half of the movie is so powerful, so well acted by Lee Ermey, that the entire second half of the movie pales in comparison. Ermey really pulls off the drill Sargent role, having been a former drill instructor in real life. Vincent D'Onofrio does an amazing job at being Gomer Pyle. These two actors put in such great performances that they easily outshine the rest of the entire cast, and steal the show. Therefore, after Gomer Pyle puts a bullet in the drill instructor and then his own head, the movie sort of goes downhill. Once in Vietnam, the movie goes somewhat dull. There are still a ton of great scenes, with a ton of great lines, and some quality acting, but it lacks the energy and the intensity that the first half has. Nonetheless, I would still highly recommend it. 10/10!",10,1,1,20 April 2006
Star Wars: Episode II - Attack of the Clones," Star Wars: Episode II - Attack of the Bad Casting
","First off, Hayden Christensen (however you spell his name) has emotional constipation, mixed in with some bi-polar attacks of over-acting. I think he is awful for the part of Anakin, soon to be Darth Vader. First of all, Darth Vader is bad-ass. Christensen is a pretty-boy. It just doesn't work. When Anakin and Padm√© are at her hidden place, and they're talking about why they can't be together, the way he acts it out is pitiful. On top of that, he whines throughout the whole movie. Minus 2 stars.Jar Jar is still alive, so that takes off 2 stars right away.Count Dooku is the least villainous villain yet to be placed in a star wars movie. He is a complete disappointment to the movie. Minus 2 stars.Samuel L. Jackson doesn't swear a single time throughout the whole movie, which creeps me out. Minus 2 stars.Darth Maul got killed in the last movie. Minus 1 star.And that leaves 1/10 stars. Enjoy the movie.",1,7,17,6 April 2006
Jarhead," Jughead was a horrible movie
","I have never been a marine, in the army, the airforce, or any sort of military of any country. I am just going to rate this as a movie, and not a measure of realism like many other people on here. This movie absolutely SUCKS. It is the worst war movie I have ever seen. The movie starts off with training, highly reminiscent of Full Metal Jacket (although it can't touch it). I can't help but to think of it as an 'updated' FMJ. Then, the marines go to Saudi Arabia. Here is where the action begins... or does it? It does, if you consider a bunch of naked little boys running around and humping each other 'action'. They sit around aimlessly, hump each other occasionally, and wander around doing nothing, complaining about faulty equipment and a lack of 'action', which is exactly what I was complaining about.This movie has ass. Male ass. Too much of it. I figured there HAS to be some kind of war. I waited until the end, and guess what? There wasn't ANYTHING. As a matter of fact, not one shot is fired out of anger in this movie. Not a single one! What kind of war movie has not one person killed in combat?? Jarhead. Thats what. The only time there are shots fired is during training when that moron gets killed, and at the end where they are shooting into the air. Thats it! No war, no fatalities, no action, and a whole lot of nothing. Great movie!",2,3,6,22 May 2006
The Fast and the Furious," The movie that started it all
","You've all seen them. Kids driving around in their 'souped up' cars... tinted windows, flashy decals, low profile tires, sweet rims, body kit, wing, and of course the noisy turbo blow-off valve and a few NOS stickers. This movie is basically filled with street-racers doing quarter miles. Meanwhile, Dom and his goons are also stealing car parts. There's a bunch of sub-plots going on here. The movie wasn't all that bad. I watch it from time to time.The bad points: <ul><li>The quarter miles take 5 minutes to complete </li></ul><ul><li>They manage to reach 160 mph in a quarter mile. Impossible - Not only that, they manage to use their NOS in the quarter miles </li></ul><ul><li>There are quite a few continuity/editing errors that are easily picked up by anyone who knows something about cars </li></ul><ul><li>Ja Rule shouldn't act... ever again! </li></ul><ul><li>The trend that it started. All of a sudden, everyone knows about customizing cars.</li></ul>The good points: <ul><li>The cars are pretty sweet </li></ul><ul><li>There is action </li></ul><ul><li>It is fast paced </li></ul><ul><li>Its watchable </li></ul><ul><li>They pump oil into a guy's mouth </li></ul>Watch it. But don't get caught up in the trend.",5,6,13,6 April 2006
Pearl Harbor," My turn to bomb 'Pearl Harbor' with a bad review
","This movie is in league with Titanic. It is a story of a tragedy, turned into a sappy love story, which seems to be a trend in Hollywood. First of all, this movie is historically incorrect in so many ways, that I'm not even going to use up my energy listing the inaccuracies. Then again, when is Hollywood ever historically accurate? The love story itself is totally unbelievable and stupid. Affleck gets shot down, survives, and his friend falls in love with his girlfriend. What a slut! What a stupid story! You got your typical hot-shot American pilots flying around like a bunch of idiots, the sappy love story, the 'USA wins the day' at the end, even though Pearl Harbor was far from a victory, the Japanese attacking and killing everybody they see, making the Japanese look like complete evil heartless bastards, etc.Why does Hollywood think that taking a tragedy and turning it into a love story is a good idea? What's next? The Hindenburg? TWA flight 800? The Lusitania? The WTC? Come on! Are people really running out of ideas this much? I'm being very lenient giving this movie 2 stars. The only reason I'm doing that is because I have seen worse.",2,20,37,11 April 2006
Independence Day," Decent invasion movie
","Aliens are once-again invading! This time they show up out of the blue with enormous spacecraft large enough to cover entire cities. People are welcoming towards them, up until they blow up a bunch of major cities in the world at the same time. How can these aliens be defeated? Watch the movie to find out.It was a decent movie. I own it. A few funny moments. Good explosions. Good action. Its enjoyable. However, it is way too 'America saves the world'. Nobody makes a move until the Americans take the lead. How about this quote: 'Hey! The Americans are planning a counter attack!''Well, its about bloody time!' Sickening! Like the entire world is sitting with a thumb up their ass waiting for the US to take the lead! Absolutely disgusting. You can tell it was made by Americans.",6,8,15,30 April 2006
Home Alone 2: Lost in New York," A bad version of the first
","This movie is so much like the first one. There is hardly any originality. Instead of being left at home, he gets lost in New York. It is the same thing, with slight variations. Same two burglars try to get him. He befriends someone he is afraid of, only this time it is a woman. They do the video-gag again (black and white movie) where they think it is a real person talking. The traps are the same more or less, with slight differences, along with a few extra ones, which are totally corny by the way. And so on and so forth. This movie is extremely predictable. Instead of a sequel, this movie should have been made as a 'Scenario B' to the first one. It would have been good, had the first one never came out, and we wouldn't realize what a blatant rip-off it is.",3,5,14,9 April 2006
Detroit Rock City," A whole lot of fun
","This is a movie about four teenagers, Hawk (Furlong), Jam (Huntington), Lex (Andrews), and Trip (Debello). They plan on seeing Kiss, but Jam accidentally takes Trip's jacket home, with the tickets inside. While Jam is at school, his mom, a complete bible-maniac, finds the tickets and burns them. She proceeds to take Jam to a boarding school. The boys are bummed out, but they hear on the radio that the 10th caller who can give the real names of the band members gets 4 front row tickets and 4 backstage passes to the Kiss concert. Trip wins the contest, and off they go to rescue Jam, and head for Detroit.I won't go into what happens there. All I'm gonna tell you is, this movie is hilarious. Go watch it for a great time.",10,14,23,12 April 2006
Titanic," More garbage... what a surprise!
","Let me start off by saying that there really can't be any spoilers about this movie, as anyone who knows anything about history already knows how this film will end. The Titanic is going to sink! What a surprise! There are three major reasons why I don't like this movie.Reason 1: We know how the film is going to end before we even see it. The ship is going to sink. If filmmakers want to make a movie in which the audience already knows what is going to happen, they need to do a better job than to simply turn it into a sappy love story. Which brings me to the second reason.Reason 2: This is another historical event turned into a sappy love story, blended in which a whole lot of Hollywood inaccuracy. The acting is terrible, and the characters are very uninteresting.Reason 3: Time. This movie is more than three hours long! Is that really necessary? No it isn't. It is a three hours of my life that I could have used way more productively. It is a three hours of my life, gone forever! Wasted! And I can never get it back! I was thankful when DiCaprio died, because I knew the movie was almost over. I can't believe this movie got so much praise. Its right there in the same league as 'Pearl Harbor'. Pure, un-adulterated junk. I gave it a 3/10, only because they did a pretty nice job 'reviving' the ship itself. Don't watch it. If you take my advice, you have just saved three hours of your life.",3,2,4,21 April 2006
Die Hard," An action movie for all to see
","This movie is one action-packed ride. Bruce Willis (John McClane) is a New York cop coming to see his wife who has moved to L.A. with their children, hoping for a relaxing Xmas vacation. Instead, he gets a bunch of bad guys who have taken over the Nakatomi building which he and his wife are located in. He hides out, and takes out the bad guys one by one, all while trying to get police attention from the outside world. This movie is tense and full of action. Bruce Willis and Alan Rickman put in outstanding performances. Willis manages to kill all of the bad guys and throw Rickman off the building. If you haven't seen it yet for whatever reason, now is the time to do so.",10,17,24,7 April 2006
Die Hard with a Vengeance," Not your average action movie
","This movie gets right to the point and starts off with an explosion. I love that. A crazy guy named Simon (played very well by Jeremy Irons) blows up a store, and asks to speak to John McClane, who is on suspension. The cops grab McClane, who is by now a heavy drinker, and put him on the phone with Simon. Simon makes him walk through Harlem with a very offensive sign. Just when he is about to get beat down, he is rescued by the racist Samuel L. Jackson, who plays Zeus. It seems as though Simon wants revenge on McClane for something, but nobody knows why. Now, Zeus and McClane are at the mercy of Simon, who meanwhile is committing a massive robbery.This movie is considerably different from the other two, which is probably a good thing. Who wants the same thing three times in a row? The plot has as many twists and turns as a snake, and the movie keeps the viewer involved. Watching Zeus and McClane bicker is amusing as well. Samuel L. Jackson pulls off the role of the 'racist black man' very well. I would highly recommend this movie.",10,97,116,10 April 2006
Star Wars: Episode III - Revenge of the Sith," Slight Improvement... But not much...
","Alright, Episode 3 of the new star wars trilogy.This whole trilogy does one thing right... it makes me see how much better episode IV through VI are, and it will make everyone who just started watching Star Wars watch those old, classic episodes.That having been said, let's discuss Episode 3, Revenge of the Sith.Scene 1: That battle is about as exciting as watching paint dry. It is so linear, you know what is going to happen. There are no sacrifices being made. They made death very impersonal to appeal to the 'family' viewing and the political-correctness of the USA. There is also a whole lot of unnecessary and unconnected dialog in this scene as well, sort of like Top Gun.Scene 2: The Ship - First disappointment was R2D2. HE'S ANIMATED! Thats not R2D2! Have they completely sold-out to CGI? The robots have a whiny little boy-voice. Even episode 1 and 2 had a decent voice for robots. The 'duel' between Anakin and Count Dooku is a complete bore, for the usual reasons: too short, not well acted, etc.Scenes 3 - 7: Nothing notable happens Scene 8: The Jedi try to arrest Palpatine. Samuel L. Jackson shocked me by actually putting on a stale performance.Scene 9: Oh no! Anakin chokes Padm√©! The big shocker! Christensen trying to look evil is worth a laugh. Padm√© dies after giving birth to Luke and Leia. Hmmm... funny... I thought Leia mentioned in episode VI that she slightly remembers her mother, and that she was always sad. She must have excellent memory to recall that information from when she was a newborn. In other words, they don't connect, and they screwed up this ending, like Lucas has screwed up so many other things.Scene 10: 3 seconds of Darth Vader. Movie ends.Conclusion - Nice try. But it still doesn't live up to the original 3.",3,0,2,6 April 2006
Signs," It was OK.
","Signs was an alright movie. It could have been spiced up a little more though. It would have been less dull. Personally, I don't like the aliens in this movie. You never even see anyone get killed. You just don't feel the danger. You don't feel the impending doom and invasion. You don't get that feeling at the bottom of your stomach when something bad is about to happen. Then, the aliens just suddenly decide to leave, and we find out that the aliens' weakness is water. In the end, all the pieces of the puzzle 'fit together', like the little girl only drinking half the glass of water, the guy playing baseball, etc. The ending was very disappointing. Also, if the aliens' weakness is water, why would they be interested in earth, which is 70% water? And what about the water vapor in the air? Exactly. The tin foil they put on their heads to keep the aliens from reading their thoughts was funny. I give this movie a 5/10",5,1,1,6 April 2006
Star Wars: Episode IV - A New Hope," A classic
","This is the first Star Wars movie ever made, and the best one in the series by far. This movie introduced us to breakthrough special effects, amazing and interesting aliens, memorable characters, and an excellent story line. I remember watching it over and over again as a kid and just totally being amazed and captivated by this film. It truly makes one's imagination run wild. The battle scenes are exciting and get the viewer involved. The tension during the attack of the Death Star is so intense that you can almost cut it with a knife. To anyone who has, for whatever reason, never seen this movie, I suggest you pick up the trilogy and watch all three of them back to back. 10/10 for sure.",10,0,0,21 April 2006
Fantastic Four," Fantastic
","This movie was a whole lot of fun. Interesting characters, good character development, exciting action, decent special effects, good story line, and it kept me involved and entertained. What more do you need? Oh, it also had some humorous parts. The big orange guy was really cool. And so was the guy with the fire. And the invisible chick. Rubber-man too. All four of them were, well, fantastic. I used to watch the cartoon when I was a little kid. The movie was at least as good. Marvel needs to make more movies like this one, and hopefully not crap like Spider Man 2. Well, I really have nothing else to say about this movie, but I need to write ten lines, and hopefully, by the time this sentence ends, I will have 10 lines.",9,0,1,22 May 2006
