The New World," I love this movie.
","The musical score, and the pacing of the story, constantly, and the actors repeatedly, capture for me the feeling that the British must have had for 'the new world' between 1607 and 1616. After watching it three times, the ending of the movie still seems too ambiguous, but this is a tiny negative. And after almost all of the movie demonstrated its director's artistic rendering of British feeling for the new world IN the new world, the last scenes in England demonstrated an equally artistic rendering of British feeling for the new world in London. Pocohantas in the Court of James among the exotic animals and birds brought back from her America was absolutely perfect. And all this is not to even mention the plot, with its bright and loving, innocent princess fallen and degraded only to endure, and prevail, and finally accept all for what it is, like she had at the beginning, but finally with a knowledge of two worlds.",9,1,3,15 December 2008
