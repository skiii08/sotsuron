The Blair Witch Project," Everyone and Their Brother Has Raved About This, But...
","As usual, I'm in the minority, but this was about THE WORST movie I've seen in a while. Spoofed now over the years by scores of other works, acclaimed by the Powers That Be, and praised to the heavens by the average movie goer, this work is THE single most overrated film in the history of film, second only to Suspira in this aspect.This film doesn't teach you anything, doesn't tell you anything, doesn't show you anything, and in the end, doesn't even finish its own story. And if you're stupid enough to think you'll get the rest of the story, or find out what happened at the end of the first one by watching the second? Don't bother, because you've been duped.Then why do they rave? Because most people don't WANT to think, they don't WANT to see intelligent film. Most people WANT crap like this which is so superficial and superfluous that it's completely and utterly pointless. Well, if you're one of those people, I'm sure you'll love this, and agree with all the ravings here at IMDb with the rest of the sheople who think this is brilliant art-house neuvo classic documentary stylized art. BLECH!This is crap and as such rates nothing.the Fiend :.",1,2,7,21 March 2007
The Mask," Clearly Carrey's Best
","Jim Carrey's style is considered by most fans to be over the top. So how do you cast a man like that? You give him a script like the Mask, that's how.This is by far Jim Carrey's best work. There are some that are AMONG his best, but this is THE best I've seen him do.A Cheezy but highly amusing storyline, great dialog, innovative dance routines, and great characters dominate this work, and Jim Carrey purely DELIVERS! You could do a LOT worse with 2 hours of your life.It rates a 8.7/10 from...the Fiend :.",9,0,0,9 March 2007
The Benchwarmers," Brainless Fun
","I didn't expect much from this one, but comically speaking, it did surprise me a bit. Just a bit, but ANY surprise from a movie like this is ... well, a surprise.I can't stand Rob Schneider, but here, he wasn't horrible. That's a first, trust me. Jon Lovitz was quite enjoyable as the diabolical megalomaniac. Frankly, this isn't anything but a baseball-centric feel-good movie, which minimally delivers the warm fuzzies, but does kick in a few Luke warm moments, overall.The laughs, however, are genuine, and while this work does fail in the heart department, it still manages to deliver good solid entertainment for SNL fans.It rates a 5.6/10 from...the Fiend :.",6,0,1,5 April 2007
National Treasure: Book of Secrets," Premise With Promise...But...
","We attended the first show, opening day in our small home town theater (Movies on the Parkway in Sevierville, TN), to a nearly sold out show.This adventure is not as fun this time around. The clues are less entrenched in symbology , lending less story, and more room for comical relief. That was a mistake, in my opinion; one which may prove to hurt it in the long run. Considering, however, how dismally the Golden Compass has fared, xmas movie goers are hungry for a good fantasy/actioner to sink their collective teeth into.Hopefully, some of those disappointed fans who brave the rains and windy wet cold to see NT2 will also give the Golden Compass a try, while they're at it. NT2 contains the same base formula as NT1, but this time it is far m ore watered down, with much less clues and less real action, but more development of the interpersonal relationships between Ben Gates (Nic Cage) and his parents (Helen Mirren and Jon Voight) and his lady. We also get a deeper look into the personal life (or lack thereof) of Riley Poole (Justin Bartha), Gates' Partner.Undoubtedly, due to a lessening of action and effects accompanying the deepening of character development and an almost total lack of substance, many will not think highly of this work. I, however, found it entertaining. Not as entertaining as the first, but it was still an enjoyable venture.Cage seems more comfortable in this incarnation of the character, without contributing a dialed-in performance. His comfort conveys an on-screen presence; a great charisma above and beyond the usual, and that's saying something.The premise has promise, but is not explored to its potential enough to flesh out the screenplay to actually give it a story. Unfortunately, this attempt fell far short in comparison to the rich story detail of the first. It left us wondering if there will be a third, for we are hoping for a return to a real adventure with a well-developed story as the first installment led us to expect.All in all? It's fun, but lacks the quality of the previous chapter. Here's hoping the 47th Page leads us back to a GOOD adventure.It rates a 5.2/10 from...the Fiend :.",5,11,24,24 December 2007
Angels & Demons," Fantastic Adaptation
","As a fan of the book, this work is fantastically adapted; remaining true to the source materials, and demonstrating an honest respect for the literary work. The intrigues translate well to film by virtue of Ron Howard's good eye for detail and sound devotion to authenticity.I like Hanks as Robert Langdon. His portrayal is genuine and earthy, with only the barest glint of the Kip we all knew and loved, back in 'the day.' He is a good dramatic actor and, while I miss his comedic efforts, I do enjoy his more serious performances.The subject matter is no less controversial than the DaVinci Code, and the Vatican seems to never learn their lesson. As with the aforementioned film, the Holy See issued a scathing rebuke and called for a global Catholic boycott of the film, which of course, generated millions in ticket sales.Although the story of the 'God Particle' was played down dramatically, and the science was written out of this piece of science fiction, the fiction that was left, was entertaining and extremely well done. And, the truth be known, people who have not read the book, will not notice any missing or lesser element to the story, as the screen version carries the main story well on its own.In fact, it is not necessary to have seen the first installment of this franchise, in order to enjoy this second, which should have been a prequel in all honesty, although that does not lessen the effectiveness, nor does it meddle with the continuity or flow of this second work.All in all, this is good for a Friday/Saturday night's viewing, although the execution may be a bit rough for the small ones.It rates an 8.8/10 from...the Fiend :.",9,4,9,17 May 2009
Kill Bill: Vol. 2," AKA KILL BILL VOL 2...One of the few worthy sequels
","This chapter of the 'Bride's' story picks up precisely where it left us, at the end of Kill Bill, Vol. 1, and seamlessly carries us forward through the second half of Tarantino's dark and twisted saga.This chapter was not nearly as sanguineous as the first, but was more treacherously deranged (if you can believe it). The execution of this screen play and the filming styles are inspired and simply breathtaking. As the stakes mount in the Bride's game of cat and mouse, the players find they must stop at nothing, in order to survive her rampage of unrelenting revenge. Tarantino took out all the stops and directed one of the most disturbing and dastardly sinister enterprises I've seen. I can't think of a single film which compares to the atmosphere and story, the depth of these characters, and the overall enjoyability of the work that is Kill Bill, Vol. 2.I wholeheartedly recommend this run to anyone who has a love of revenge movies, action flicks, and splatter fans (though splatter fans may prefer Kill Bill, Vol. 1, now that I think about it).It rates the exact same rating as the first at an 8.8/10 from...the Fiend :.",9,2,4,20 January 2005
Vertigo," Hitchcock was the master of suspense.
","Everything, the musical score, the performances, the story line, the dialog all felt right with this production. The attention to the finer details given by Hitchcock was what really set this movie to rights, but it did not hurt that there was real charisma there between Stewart and Novak.Stewart, who was Hitchcock's ideal for the 'average American guy,' was nothing less than stellar in his Vertigo performance. His range of talent shows an outright absence of inhibitory characteristics. He goes from the warm yet aloof 'Scotty' to the angry and downright mad 'Scotty' in such a pure believability that his performance alone is one of the major factors in My assessment of this film as one of Hitchcock's very best.But where would Stewart's performance be without the full-figured and capable talents of his leading lady? Kim Novak was arguably one of the best talents of this film era. She was perfectly cast in the role of the mysterious yet earthy type lady of wealth who had a slight...problem. But, while her performance here was nothing but pure perfection, I must say I liked her character more in 'Bell, Book and Candle.'This story is one for the arm-chair psychiatrists out there; fraught with twists and turns, switch-backs and double-meanings, you could easily find yourself lost if you look away only for a moment. This is definitely a movie for the thinkers, and not the busy-bodies who enjoy watching a movie while doing other things. This story deserves nothing less than your full attention.While not considered Hitchcock's best work, or even among his best work, while he was still working, this endeavor has come to be known as such since his demise. To look at this now, so many years after its making and see it for the brilliance it was takes only a couple of hours and an adult attention span. He was so far ahead of his time, that his audiences just did not 'get' the cruel irony of this attempt and as such, we nearly lost for all time one of the greatest masterpieces of suspense ever made. Only through the hard work and great dedication of those involved was this brilliant work restored. We are, indeed, fortunate as a society that this was even possible.IF YOU HAVE NOT WATCHED THIS MOVIE, THERE ARE MAJOR SPOILERS AHEAD!!I loved the cruel irony of the ending. The fact that she had played him so freaking well only to die as her predecessor had. I thought that Hitchcock tried his best to use a fear common to many people; IE: the fear of heights, in order to draw his audience in. I enjoyed watching Hitchcock's demonstration of Scotty's slow mental spiral as everything began weighing on his subconscious; all the little details, all the tiny pieces that were swimming around in his head. It really looked as though he would snap, when in reality, he was quietly placing each piece into the necessary slot to make the picture come together for him. I also must comment on the use of the gray suit used by Hitchcock and worn by Kovak. It was used, IMO to make her all the more stunning in the evening gown she wore when Scotty first laid eyes on her.Everything else she wore after that was black, white or grey, to heighten the beauty of her in that one scene. Grey is usually a bad color for blonds. It washes them out and makes them look like they're wearing green pan for a black and white oldie. But Hitchcock did that on purpose as effect. Speaking of effects, the camera work here is simply stunning.That and the whole movie was nothing more than a parable teaching us to face our fears rather than surrender to them. This was the best in his suspense line. I loved Psycho, too, but I always considered it more the first in the slasher sub-genre rather than suspense.This movie rates a solid 8.9/10 from...the Fiend :.",9,5,7,1 April 2004
Alien 3," Inferior, but enjoyable
","The 'Making of' documentary begins with these words by David Fincher...'I think that they knew that I had given my blood and my every milliliter of my sweat trying to make it work, but I guess that I just wasn't clever enough to come up with something that would really blow everybody away and be something completely different.''It was just set up wrong to begin with. It was a very sort of bad period for us, in this film, because we were fighting a losing battle all the time.'That, in a nutshell, sums up the general consensus surrounding this movie.Alcatraz in space, just did not work. It still offers some good moments, but this was clearly NOT the sequel James Cameron had intended. With Aliens (Alien 2), he clearly set it up for Ripley, Newt, and Hicks to return to Earth as a family. It should have been Ripley and Hicks from then on out. Instead, Ripley is alone among a penal space colony, Newt died in transit (a victim of a chestburster during the trip), and Hicks's life support had mysteriously given out.This script was quite bad. Jon Landau, Executive Producer of this project is quoted as having said, 'I always felt that Alien 3 was a movie that initially, as a studio, we set out to make a Release Date and not a movie. I think along the way that changed, but that really set us back.' They were more concerned with the release date than the story, and unfortunately, that is a glaring reality when viewing this installment behind the first two.All that having been said, however, Sigourney Weaver is no less realistically believable; no less professionally perfect in her performance than she was in both Alien and Aliens. In fact, the performances were lovely all around. It was the plot which was lacking. The story was not beneficial to the line, in any way. Especially in that they killed off Ripley, and thereby terminated their own franchise. This was sad, indeed, as the one to follow also lacked in depth and vision, but was a definite rise above this third attempt.It's the movie I wanted to love, but just couldn't.As such, it rates a 6.2/10 from...the Fiend :.",6,4,5,22 January 2005
Gremlins," Endearing Feel-Good Horror Comedy
","Gremlins is one of my favorite horror comedies in that it boasts some endearing characters, innovative ideas, and excellent execution of story.While this is definitely not for fans of all ages, the exception being younger children, most everyone else will enjoy this fast-paced, twisted romp into the netherworld of magickal, mystical beasties and their lore.Set in what was then contemporary America, and peopled with the popular young actors of the day, this work exhibits some of the same teenage appeal as did most 80's movies, but with the added draw of lovingly created monsters and characters.It is great fun, if somewhat darkling in consideration, although to watch it today, it is rather dated.It rates a 6.4/10 from...the Fiend :.",6,2,3,18 March 2007
Antz," Fun family film featuring Woody Allen and Sharon Stone.
","I thoroughly enjoy this animation/CGI production, although the quality is not up to par with what we have, today. The main characters are well developed and easy to adopt as focal interest points.The story is quite well-written and delivered, the colors are bright and crisp, and helped to sell the DVD media to the average civilian. Even today, the content is still better than that of, 'A Bug's Life,' which just basically has a few characters bouncing one-liners off each other. At least this movie has a STORY! Woody Allen's character is the star...and an Ant. He was classified 'worker' as larvae and he's having a few problems with that classification. He feels inadequately judged and pigeon-holed by this assignment, and lets the whole world know it via Allen's nasal whining. There is something better in the world for him, and he is sure he could find and attain it, if only he had the chance. Finally, he realizes that he has to take the chance; opportunity doesn't come on its own to the normal people.There is a nice sub-plot and a strong main plot; well developed characters and a star-studded cast of voice and likeness donors in this adventurous and entertaining story.All in all it earns an 8.2/10 from... the Fiend :.",8,1,2,9 October 2003
Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," Watch it for what it is, rather than what others expect it to be...
","It seems to be 'trendy' to have bad things to say about this work, but I found it largely captivating.As the first (or rather, the fourth, but we won't go into that) installment of the Star Wars saga, this was meant not as a climactic piece of cinematic art, but more as an introduction to the series. This chapter of the Star Wars space opera had no 'real' climactic center, no true 'ending.' This is why the studios chose chapter 4, the central climactic center of the story, to finance first. Of course, Lucas financed the rest, and 20th Century/Fox lost all rights to their share of the Lucas/Star Wars money machine when they lost their studio head, years ago. It was only due to Lucas's 'generosity' that they still retain distribution rights.This work was an opening chapter only and had it been the first to have been made, the audiences would have been left to say, 'WTF?! was that?' So chapter 4 was rewritten to contain a definite beginning, climactic center, and ending so that it more resembled a 'stand alone' feature. You know...just in case. But Lucas knew what he was doing, and Star Wars 1 (as it was known then) quickly became Star Wars: Episode 4 - A New Hope, and the progenitor of the Star Wars run.The action most critics seem to have missed, is covert. Duplicitious characters surreptitiously bargain behind closed doors, thereby setting up the story and the beautifully rich darkling sub-plots. And there IS actual action enough to keep even the die-hards entertained. But suspense, rather than action, is the element which fuels this fire. Action comes from the climactic build up, and is prevalent in Episodes 4-6 because they were the climax of the series. So don't be too disappointed if there is more story to these prequel installments, than action. The story is designed to bring about the action in the later episodes.Another issue with this work is the CGI. Fans are so accustomed to hearing the purists complain about the CGI from the Original Trilogy, that they've forgotten why there's an issue. That having been said, the CGI in this installment ultimately makes the final product as adventurous, exciting, and cohesive in story as it was. Lucas's Star Wars Universe is beautifully conceived, and wondrously executed as to be a treasure which is the fourth highest grossing film ever. Apparently, someone liked it.His characters are beautifully conceived and executed, and competently paint the world of Lucas in such a way as to endear, not repulse. All characters but one: Jar Jar Binks. He is more annoying than the Ewoks, and not half as amusing. He seems to be lacking cultural identity, but if you listen closely, his language and pronunciation closely resembles Mush Mouth from the Fat Albert show. He also, at times, sounds Jamaican. But it's on again, off again. I think this installment could have done well without him. Yes, he serves a purpose; that of comic relief. You can't help but laugh at his ineptitude, regardless of how you feel about his presence. Yes, he is key to the plot elements, but Lucas could have created a much better, more PC little guy than this Ebonics-speaking, long-eared, spotty-lipped, blunderbuss.Much has been said concerning 'stiff' performances. I can't help but laugh at that. Liam Neeson was characterized as a high-level Jedi, and he portrayed his part, as such, with dignity and sense of propriety. He was perfect as Qui-Gon Jinn and his bearing commanded respect. That was not stiff acting. That was an extraordinarily competent show of character acting. If that means he comes off as 'stiff,' so be it.We get to see the beginnings of C3PO and R2D2 at the very beginning of his involvement with the progenitors of the Rebellion. Anakin Skywalker is young (very young), and as good a child actor as you could ask. He is impressively portrayed by Jake Lloyd. I cannot wait to see where his life takes him. He is an incredible actor already. Natalie Portman was a complete surprise as Queen Amadala. She, too, has been described as 'stiff' by many critics. But I must interject that, as Queen, she presents a stately presence. If that's considered 'stiff,' fine. But I saw it as an incredibly accurate and apt characterization. Royalty can BE a bit 'stiff' at times. Ewan McGregor is perfectly cast as Obi-Wan Kenobi, as he represents the 'go get'em' attitude Sir Alec Guiness shows in his undertaking as Obi-Wan in Episodes 4 and 5. It is this Fiend's opinion that he was the epitome of a young Obi-Wan, and effectuated his role with a quality of poise for which I hadn't dared hope.This is an excellent introduction to the Star Wars Universe.It rates an 8.4/10 in appreciation for what it was, rather than what other critics expected it to be, from...the Fiend :.",8,4,8,18 March 2007
50 First Dates," Excellent Romantic Comedy. This Is Good Whether You're A Sandler Fan or Not!
","Let me begin this by stating that Drew IS the star of this work. Sandler is a mere detail, although I found his performance very enjoyable. What did NOT belong here was Rob Schneider. He should have been excised from this work in every way, shape, and form. He had no place here, but we all know Sandler WILL employ his friends who have a hard time getting a job otherwise. You just can't hate that about someone. It is a trait to be admired. But when your friend is as untalented as Rob, get him a job as a crew member, NOT a cast member! Okay, enough of that.This was only mildly funny, because the subject matter was too serious to actually rate outright comedy. The comedy is light, because it HAS to be light in order to sell the later premise.The later premise is presented beautifully, in sensitivity, and with a fair amount of awe. I thoroughly enjoyed it.It rates an 8.8/10 on the RomCom Scale from...the Fiend :.",9,2,4,23 March 2007
The Ring," Superior, Atmospheric, Twisted Little Creepfest
","The Ring did three things no film of late has done. It took the genre of Horror seriously without going over the top. It is derived from a superior story and translated to American film superbly, regardless of what the naysayers say. And, while it starts off typically, it ascends into a beautiful, darkling, twisted, genuinely creepy story, which holds you through to the end.Gore Verbinski's style is unmistakable. He has left this work well marked with his stylistic shots, and suspenseful progression.Actually, I found this far superior to most horrors done in the last thirty years or so. A lot has been said about Ringu, the work from which this was adapted for American cinema, and inevitable subsequent comparisons made, however, that is certainly NOT the case. That argument is moot, as this work was based on the novel, 'The Ring' by Koji Suzuki, so if you want something to which an honest comparison may be made, I would suggest you read the book, and leave Ringu where it belongs. Personally, I found the American adaptation much more to my liking than Ringu.This is one twisted little creep-fest! It rates an 8.7/10 from...the Fiend :.",9,77,104,15 April 2007
Raiders of the Lost Ark," Revolutionary cinema!
","Given that this movie is, at this writing, over twenty years old, I must say it has well withstood the tests of time. Every summer action 'blockbuster' thereafter has reached for the star that is 'Indiana Jones,' and for the most part, fallen flat. Harrison Ford, fresh out of the 'Star Wars' franchise, has done himself proud with the three Indiana Jones installments; each a bit better than the one before it. He is the embodiment of realistic acting. His character would have been completely unbelievable had it been played by anyone else, but Ford lends to it a certain quality of honesty and reality; the same admired traits he contributed to the Star Wars sagas. I feel safe in saying that had anyone else been cast as Indiana Jones, the franchise would not have been as successful as it was...and is.With the new release of the Indiana Jones Boxed Set on DVD, the popularity of this series has been rekindled. Collectors and fans alike are flocking to the video stores to stock up on the latest release of their best and dearest favorites. According to Yahoo.com, it is the second-highest top selling DVD collection in the Action/Adventure genre as of right now, what with having all three movies and an additional DVD full of extras. (01/01/04) The Raiders of the Lost Ark is all about the Ark of the Covenant, a religious artifact which is written a lot about in the old testament. It was reported to lay waste to vast armies and bring sure victory to any army which marched into war bearing this relic. It was old, even in the days of the Bible. What was built, was an elaborate case in which to house and carry it, fashioned by one of the twelve tribes of Israel and fought over every since.The infamous German dictator is in search of the ark, which puts the American Government into the holy relic business. They enlist Dr. Indiana Jones, famed archaeologist, to find the ark and bring it back to safety before Hitler's men can get their hands upon it.Not a bad premise, actually, and the Spielberg/Lucas team bring it to life for us. The story was fresh and edgy, with a wonderful cast and crew. Every aspect of this movie was action, fantasy, and an awe-inspiring creativity.While I did find Karen Allen a bit whiny, and wanted to see her beheaded by the fifth scene, she finally pulled through and delivered a stellar performance by the end of the movie. By any standards, this movie is still a huge success, and a goal for any aspiring actor/director/screenwriter/cinematographer to shoot for.What I liked most about this movie, was the feeling bestowed by Ford's character that you actually knew him. The character development was wonderful, but without Ford's down-to-earth performance, that character development would not have been nearly as effective. So honestly, what I liked best about this production was Harrison Ford. He does not play his character like he knows everything, has no flaws, and is the perfect ... anything. He is honest, in his portrayal, about his shortcomings, lack of knowledge in certain areas, and his physical vulnerabilities. Excellent performance. Simply excellent.It rates an 8.9/10 from...the Fiend :.",9,0,0,1 January 2004
Who Framed Roger Rabbit," A deserving hit
","What can I say? Four Academy awards, Steven Spielberg, Robert Zemeckis, Bob Hoskins, Christopher Lloyd, and Jessica Rabbit! (Kathleen Turner) this was a beautiful and rare collaboration between Disney and Warner Brothers; something I wish they would repeat.This film is hard to describe to those who have yet to see it. I hope I do it justice.First off, this is not mere animation. It is a combination of animation and live acting, which works wonderfully together here to weave a gritty, touching story.Also, this is not for younger audiences. There is quite a bit of harsh language, sexual referencing, and adult innuendo, not to mention some gruesome murders. While there is a total lack of gore, the implications are still there. There are murders, mysteries, twists, and some really strong performances. It is a really gritty story, yet sweet and endearing at the same time.You will enjoy cameos by Bugs Bunny, Tweety, Mickey Mouse, Bambi, Pluto, Donald & Daffy Duck, Goofy, Droopy, Porky Pig, Betty Boop, and countless others.Enjoy! It rates an 8.1/10 from...the Fiend :.",8,1,1,18 January 2004
Mulan," Brave and Magical.
","Witty, amusing little Disney movie, regardless of the horrid song element.I'm not a fan of the Disney musical formula. I do not like the made-for-five-year-old song element found in most Disney animations, so I tend to just ignore those sections except in movies such as 'Beauty and the Beast,' where that activity is just not possible. I therefore avoid the movie itself, as often as I can.This movie, has much of that Disney musical element, which for me, lowers the value of the movie.However, the animation is far better than that of other later Disney movies, and the backgrounds are well done, which is a delightful surprise.Disney has taken to ignoring detail, of late, which is a major disappointment for those of us who watch these movies for the animation quality.The story itself is really very compelling, innovative, and strong. I thoroughly enjoyed this Disney attempt, although I am sure, as with all Disney sequels, they will screw up the animation quality and background value in Mulan 2. And I fully appreciated the comedic element provided by Eddie Murphy.It rates an 8.2/10 from...the Fiend :.",8,4,4,28 October 2003
Se7en," Moody, atmospheric action/thriller
","Very good thriller, in spite of Gwyneth Paltrow's involvement.I generally detest Gwyneth Paltrow in everything she's done. I can't abide her presence and it is my personal opinion that she suffers from a total lack of talent. However, Morgan Freeman and Brad Pitt pull this one completely out of the wastebasket, dusts it off, and sets it back on the shelf.The story is very telling, the performances are completely professional, the set designs are inspired, and the whole production is darkly and eerily executed.You can, however, see Mr. Pitt's character from 12 Monkeys in his character in this movie, as they were filmed very close to one another.You can see some of the schizophrenic mannerisms exhibited here, which in no way draws from the character, nor does it draw from the finished product. I found it rather endearing, in fact, as I enjoyed 12 Monkeys very much.Freeman and Pitt work together quite well, after a slow and faltering acceptance of one another, to lead you down the road which takes you into the dark and noisome mind of a killer.All in all, not a bad movie. I'm very grateful that Ms. Paltrow's part was small and almost inconsequential.I've just one question, though. What is with the fascination with Christian legend, of late? There are thousands of ancient civilizations out there which worshiped thousands of gods/goddesses.What is with this Christian obsession? While this is an original screenplay, with creative and unique elements, due to its Christian elements, it gets thrown right in with about a hundred other movies of this type.It rates a 8.1/10 from...the Fiend :.",8,1,2,30 December 2003
Unbreakable," Intelligent Loser
","This film is called brilliant by some, but I can't agree. I understand the premise, that for each Superhero, there is a Villain, and for each Villain, there is a Superhero. Okay, we get that.This, however, was not entertaining, nor was it as clever as it thought it was. It takes itself far too seriously to allow suspension of disbelief required to enjoy this kind of work. It indicated that to be the villain, requires mental deficiencies, while at the same time, contradicting that concept by showing the humanity of the villain and attempting to endear him to the audience.This work clearly fails to achieve the desired effect. I couldn't really enjoy it, as it attempts to sell something I wasn't interested in buying.It rates a 4.8/10 from...the Fiend :.",5,4,7,29 March 2007
Star Trek," Contrived, Ripped Off, and Unworthy as a Star Trek film, but Great if You Like PopCorn Flix.
","The elements are so convoluted with the Star Wars universe in this latest installment, that I do not know where to start. We have Obi Wan (Pike) Luke SkyWalker (Jim Kirk), Darth Vader/Maul/Sidius (Nero), Leia (Uhura), Alderan (Vulcan), C3P0 (Young Spock) and Yoda (Old Spock) and the comparisons go on and on and on to the point of rip-off. Kirk (and Old Spock) are marooned on Hoth. I mean Seti-Alpha 5. I mean ANOTHER ice planet, not Hoth, but the brain biters from Seti-Alpha 5 are employed here, although not in the same way, and now they do different things, but they are the same 'indigenous life forms' from SA5.*sighs* I wanted to love this movie. I've waited anxiously for YEARS for this film, watching as the parts were cast, as the script was approved, as filming began and ended, and as the post production work was commenced. I have to say that as far as the cast is concerned, they were all cast beautifully. Unfortunately, the casting is the best element OF this film.We have an alternative reality, which means that Anton Chekhov is present in Star Fleet and on the Enterprise from the beginning, which we all know was not the case. It also means that all of the other 45 years' worth of Franchise History may be overlooked, and was SO overlooked as to be done with great relish.Also overlooked, is sound reason. The contrived element of 'Red Matter' was devised to create a black hole event when it contacts with matter. As lame as that sounds, it looks very good on the screen. What does not look good, is the vastly overlooked fact that it is held in a plasticine container, extracted through mundane methods involving a SYRINGE, and then injected into another mundane container before deliverance is initiated, with no black hole occurring within the syringe, nor within the secondary container. Even that not withstanding, the whole plot line does not stand up to the test.Nero is upset that Obi Wan could not save Alderan from annihilation, so when he is sucked forever into the past, instead of warning his home planet and extracting the populous into his huge Death Star to save them, he haunts the skies for Old Ben, sorry Old Spock, to come back so that he can kill him. No Intelligent Life Found. At least, not aboard the massive mining vessel Nero captains. But then again, what's going on aboard the Enterprise is hardly better. Spock (Young Spock, that is) maroons Kirk on Hoth (no, not Hoth, but who cares? It's Hoth) where Old Ben (Old Spock) is also marooned, but by Nero, and where Scotty has been stationed because he proved smarter than his instructors and it damaged their egos. But Old Ben knew that Han and Luke should be together, so he takes Luke to the sub station where Han is assigned and introduces him to Han and Chewy, while reminding Han that he's a first rate mathematician and demonstrates to him just how he changed the universe as it was then known. This entire work is riddled with contrivances and stolen elements from Star Wars. So much so, that I cannot love this film as I once desired. If all you seek is a good summer Popcorn Flick, then this is it. But if you're a fan, even a casual fan (meaning you don't know the ship types, classes, and configurations by heart), of Star Trek, you will be disappointed by the lack of intelligence demonstrated in the overall execution of this work.Star Wars has always been about the Human Condition, or if you prefer, the State of Heart. Star Trek has always been about the Human Psyche, or if you prefer State of Mind. This attempt betrays the entirety of 45 years of Star Trek history, and before you start telling me to get a life and stuffing me into my locker, you have to understand that for millions of franchise fans who spend billions of dollars on movies, merchandise, conventions, autograph collections, and signed memorabilia, this is serious business.And while there are seven new members in key Star Trek roles, will their work be sought after in 45 years? If so, will it only be because they are 'part of the set' or will it be because they were great at what they did? JJ Abrams, I have always loved your Bad Robot works, but I have to say that this was a vast disappointment, overall. The only part of me satisfied by this work is the part of me which needs huge, flashy, KABOOMy eye candy.All in all? It's for action/science fiction fans, and fans of popcorn movies, NOT fans of TOS, TNG, or DS9. It holds some great action, better effects, and brilliant casting...it just left the previous intelligence of Star Trek, at the door. But in spite of what I've written here, I did enjoy the film. It rates a 6.5/10 from...the Fiend :.",7,6,14,27 May 2009
As Good as It Gets," Seems to have missed its mark.
","Curmudgeonly Jack Nicholson softens to his world in this lovely piece of dramatic drivel. I'm not into dramas so I can't say I enjoyed this as much as most who would bother to review it. Aside from that, however, I find this well written, affectionate, and in possession of heart and soul. Helen Hunt is sweet and natural in her portrayal, but then again, I usually DO like her.This work is entirely story driven, and, as a result, spends a lot of time on character development, story enriching sub-plots, and an elevated overall execution of the dramatic element. Nicholson is as good in the dramatic roles as he ever was. His adroit dramatic talents are what make his horror/action attempts so good.This movie is supposed to teach you that love and matters of the heart should rule the day. For me, though, it seems to have missed its mark. It seems to me that without money, the 'miracles' of this film could not have taken place. So rather than teaching that heart is the answer, it teaches that money is the answer, for without money, nothing Nicholson's character wanted to do for ANYone would have been possible. Otherwise, it was moderately entertaining.It rates a 6.4/10 from...the Fiend :.",6,0,3,31 January 2009
Underworld," Underworld. A new legend is born.
","Let me start this review by saying that, while this work is NOT scary, it was not MEANT to be scary. This production was classed into the genre of 'Horror,' strictly due to the 'monster' factor. There are 'tense' moments, to be sure, but this is not a 'boo!' kind of movie. There is; however, plenty of action, lots of well enacted drama and wonderful realistic effects. I was actually amazed with the apparent lack of high-dollar effects, the almost Rice-ian Vampire clans lounging in the well designed lush and lavish 'mansion,' the gritty tension held throughout the movie, and the stunningly clever costume designs. But what held me mostly in thrall were the effects.The effects were so well done, they were believable. They explain that the older Lycan can change at will, regardless of the moon's cycle...with that in mind, the way the werewolves' mandible bones FORCED themselves out and into place was dead ON. Changing at will would BE like that, especially in times of anger or great stress. Someone (possibly Wiseman?) had heard (and correctly believed) that 'less is more,' because the effects were done in such a way as to appear REAL and not...simply more Hollywood 'Matrix' flash. These scenes were so well done; so well directed, filmed and portrayed that we could, even if for a short time, believe the things we were watching...were possible. The wonderfully unique bullets used by both sides are absolutely brilliant. It reminded me if the horribly campy western/vampire movie made about 10 or 15 years ago entitled, 'Sundown,' where the vampire hunters used wooden bullets.I am simply stunned to discover that this is Len Wiseman's first attempt in the field as Director. I eagerly look forward to more brilliance from this man. (He was also one of the writers of the original literary work.) If this is his first attempt, we may have just been introduced to the next Spielberg. Personally, I'm hoping he leans more towards being the next Hitchcock. The weaponry Selene (Kate Beckinsale) utilized was quite unique and completely interested the small audience in my hometown theater. When she drew her stars and threw them simultaneously at the Lycan; when the scene slowed to an almost stop just long enough to allow you to SEE the throwing stars as they CHANGED into much more deadly projectiles, was absolutely excellent. AND was also the ONLY scene in this entire movie which even remotely reminded me of 'The Matrix.' The other critics keep droning on and on with comparisons between these two movies, and frankly, I just don't see it. Also, 'Blade' has been used as a source of comparison. The only similarities between 'Blade' and 'Underworld' are that Viktor, the oldest and strongest of the Vampiric race of 'Pure Bloods,' uses a sword. Oh, and there are Vampires. Those were the ONLY common points, as far as I could tell. This is an original work; not a petty rip-off or a 'jumble of other movies.' This is a very creative and unique attempt; a successful one, if you ask me. While guns were used more than I would have liked, the additional weaponry chosen for this endeavor was not your standard action-flick fare. One of the vampire 'Death Dealers' uses a pair of 10' whips quite well. And don't forget about the bullets I mentioned...what an extraordinary intellectual and creative power. The costumes were kept simple, yet served the purpose of helping to set the mood. Two words...understated elegance. Absolutely brilliant. Some have said that the story line is hard to follow, or that there is no discernible plot. Let me be frank. This is not a movie for the squeamish, nor is it a movie for those who like to be able to NOT concentrate on the plot. Sure, there is enough visual eye candy to keep most casual fans of the genre entertained, but there is also a very complicated and beautifully sinister plot and subplots going on beneath the flying bullets and shots of Kate Beckinsale's butt in latex and leather. The Shakespearean relationship between Selene and Michael (Scott Speedman) is well written and pleasantly portrayed, in the midst of all that darkness and drama. A bit of candle-light to shine hope into the darkness of despair, as it were. The story is an upgraded spin on a timeless classic, with enough additional plot and sub-plot to keep even the most common movie-goer interested. The war between the Vampires and the Lycan has raged for more than a thousand years. The Lycan, once the serving class to the Vampire, had risen against their masters and won their freedom. But was that the real story? Was their freedom truly the motivating force which stoked the fires of this war for this long? In the center of this war are Selene (Vampire) and Michael (Lycan). Their love of one another is forbidden by every Vampire Covenant written, but will that be enough to stop them from falling in love? As one of the chosen 'Death Dealers,' an organization within the Vampire Clans trained and equipped to hunt and kill Lycans, Selene is faced with a decision most dire: sell out and live? or be true to herself and die? Will her loyalty to her ancient maker keep her from making the right choice? And that is where the sub-plot kicks into overdrive and makes you sit back and say, 'Oh wow! No kidding?!' at the darkling twists in the plot. I was thoroughly entertained by this work, and cannot wait to add the DVD to the Vampire section of my horror collection. Superb acting; rich depth of character; talented, creative directing; and realistic effects put this movie at the top of all other Vampyre movies, for me. It earns an ambitious 9.7/10 from...the Fiend :.",10,51,84,19 September 2003
Kickboxer," Responsible Martial Arts Flick Receives Bad Marks
","Van Damme wrote this story to demonstrate that it takes a long long time to achieve the level of expertise that one needs in order to compete in a contest such as featured herein. The lion's share of film time is devoted to the rigorous training Kurt (Van Damme) receives in preparation of the upcoming bout with Tong Po. The story begins in the beginning, takes a hiatus to demonstrate the instruction necessary to get to the climax, and then runs straight into the climax.The problem is that most casual martial arts fans don't CARE about the training or character development. They just want action action action and then in the ending finale, they want action, with maybe a little story thrown in. If that is what you're after, this isn't that kind of film. This also isn't an intelligent film or anything Oscar-worthy, but if you want your teenager to see what is required to hone those tai kwan do classes into something real and formidable, plug this one in and explain the level of dedication one must invest to achieve that goal.If for no other reason, watch it for that.I don't know. I can't really say this is the most enjoyable of Van Damme's work. Frankly, I liked Cyborg and Bloodsport much more.This rates a 4.6/10 on the movie scale.This rates a 5.8/10 on the martial arts scale from...the Fiend :.",5,1,2,2 February 2009
Dawn of the Dead," It's a Great Remake But Completely Unnecessary.
","I think I like the original better. I do NOT like fast moving zombies. They just freak, me right the heck out. This lacks the light easy comedic element found in the original, but has a harder, edgier feel. It is, therefore, more reflective of the new generation, but I'm not sure that's what's best for this franchise.Either way, If you are interested in this film, you should definitely watch the original and be your own judge. That's always the best way to go, don't you think? This bears some shocking elements, some sad, others unthinkable, so if you have a weak heart or a squeamish tummy, don't attempt it. This is a zombie movie unlike the rest of the line. This one gives its viewers a completely different take on the whole flesh-eating zombie thing.All in all, it's a great remake but I found it completely unnecessary. Go figure.It rates a 5.5/10 from...the Fiend :.",6,0,2,8 January 2009
Iron Man 2," Don't Listen! This Sequel Is FUN!!
","I read professional reviews citing an absence of sparks between Pepper Potts and Tony Stark, lack of story, and lack of meat in spite of its being a '...slick production...' So I was tempted to enter the theater with dampened expectations, but just couldn't muster the disappointment necessary. In spite of that, I was not disappointed. This film was not only serviceable as a sequel, but is a fine sequel with a great story, an awesome villain, and an aptly saucy Pepper Potts.Development of Stark's textbook narcissism cycles nicely, giving the on-screen version of this flawed comic book hero the adequate feeling of supposed superiority needed to further appropriate character development in this direction.So don't listen. This is a fun film, which we all enjoyed, and cannot wait to own. Hope you enjoy it, too.It rates an 8.3/10 from...the Fiend :.",8,1,4,12 May 2010
Alien: Resurrection," Superior to Alien 3
","While this is commonly thought of as the weaker installment of this line, personally, I believe it to be superior to Alien 3 in many important ways.200 years after Ripley's death, she is cloned and brought back to life. The cloning process, however, also involved the DNA of the Alien Queen, giving her superhuman powers and abilities. After several failed attempts, they finally make good with a humanoid Ripley/Queen with superior intelligence and talents.According to the Making of documentary, this installment was very unlike the disorganized mess which was Alien 3 in that this attempt was together and ready to go a year before they actually started shooting. The story was polished and perfected, and was a unique and creative story in comparison. It was a big script in Hollywood. The buzz about it was that it had elements which made it a worthwhile successor to the first two, completely ignoring the third installment all together.Alien: Resurrection takes the Alien franchise to places fans would never have dreamed, without compromising the key elements of the Alien world, and does it successfully.The studios did not want a typical Hollywood popcorn movie to be part of this franchise, and therefore hired Jean-Pierre Jeunet (City of Lost Children, if you can dig it) to bring in a unique interpretive eye to the direction of this project. His visual style is quite distinct and permeates this work in a pro-active way. It was, perhaps, the most shrewd move Fox could have made in that his unique perspective was the single-most saving factor of this attempt.The action sequences are quite rousing, the story here is once again solid and convincing, and the performances are still the top row quality you expected from this line. The fight sequences are well choreographed and executed; beautifully done, as is the rest of this movie. While I cannot rate it as high as I did the first two, it is obviously superior to Alien 3 in all ways that matter.It rates a 7.9/10 from...the Fiend :.",8,47,84,22 January 2005
12 Monkeys," Very compelling sci-fi/romance/action/adventure.
","Well, if this movie had decided at least by the first half which genre it was going to shoot for, it would have been phenomenal. It did not, however, and is therefore a good movie. It could have been great, but that chance for greatness was lost by the end of the first 45 minutes. The premise is an old one, though there are some good twists - predictable twists, but good, nonetheless.Willis has never been my favorite actor, but he puts forth the above-average effort here. This movie actually made him have to think; to consider what was happening both to himself, and to the world around him.For some of you, this movie may take several viewings to get the time line straight, but all in all, I'd say it would be worth the effort.However good anyone may think Willis is in this movie, it is my opinion, Brad Pitt steals the show. This movie is worth the viewing just to see Brad Pitt as a total spastic megalomaniac suffering from delusions of grandeur and extreme paranoid schizophrenia.I do enjoy this movie, in spite of the darkling feel it generates.The cinematography is quite good, and the story line is original even though the most general premise of saving the world by traveling back in time to prevent the onset of disaster, is not.It rates a 7.8/10 from...the Fiend :.",8,0,0,30 December 2003
The 13th Warrior," Occasionally gritty but boring throughout
","This is one of over-compensating attempts which tries so very hard, and goes over the top. It so wanted to be a blockbuster ticket-seller, but in its attempt, it really just left the audience feeling deflated, as if all the life had been sucked out of you just for having watched this long, boring mess.Now don't get me wrong, there is adequate grit and gore, but those moments are all too fleeting, as Banderas drones on ... and on in an almost hypnotizing way, which succeeds not where intended but in settling the audience into a nice, peaceful slumber.You notice right away that something does not set right. Banderas' narrative commences, and while you realize he is speaking in a normal pace, you also realize there is something missing, as you're suddenly in the thick of things, and are not sure how you got there.The story is therefore weak and forgettable. Let's face it, if a story has no rhythm, it grows boring. The second half of this work (the Norse half, we'll call it) was actually interesting. I wouldn't mind seeing a ~real~ movie surrounding this subject matter. But this just wasn't it. I must honestly say that this is John McTiernan's most useless attempt.It doesn't really even rate a rating, but since I must, I'll give it a 2/10 from...the Fiend :.",2,1,7,22 January 2005
Shaun of the Dead," Clever Irreverence
","Many fans view the Night of the Living Dead as one of the greatest horror films of all time. Because of that status, this irreverent take on the inside jokes, situations, and characters of NotLD, has brought this work to immediate cult status.Many reviewers have painfully detailed each and every reference to NotLD to be found in Shawn of the Dead, but the entire FILM is an homage to that which it spoofs; George Romero's low-budget sleeper hit film of the late 1960's. Why then, would anyone feel the need? Every scene, every detail, is homagic.If you love the zombie genre, this one is a definite must-see!It rates an 8.4/10 from...the Fiend :.",8,2,5,28 February 2006
Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Man's Chest," Darker story delivers a superior adventure...
","In reading the reviews written by the 'professional' critics prior to my initial viewing of this work, I entered the theater with greatly lessened expectations. I must say that I owe those naysayers a vote of thanks, as I was so anticipating this work, that it had no way of fulfilling my hopes. Thanks to their dire condemnations and overly enthusiastic tongue-clicking, I had a marvelous and unexpectedly thrilling movie-going experience.The best most well-done element of this movie? The WHOLE movie! I'm serious. There wasn't a moment of wasted film, there wasn't even one time when I was wondering what time it was, and there wasn't a single performance which was found lacking in any way. This was a 3 hour film which felt like it was over too soon. And, if you've been one of the millions of fans who have kept up with this work through its production, then you also know the original cast is back, including the nefarious Barbossa (NOT a spoiler, he's listed in the credits), in addition to an entire cast of new characters, thrilling action, mahogany storyline, superior sound, and stellar awards-quality effects.The Verbinski/Bruckheimer marriage seems to be a good one; a profitable one, but more importantly, a creative one. The story incorporates each and every element of a successful well-loved classic. There is romance, action, adventure, horror, fantasy, monsters, pirates, chases, betrayals, escapes, treacheries and deceits, honesty, and love. All set before breathtaking vistas, and finished with completely realistic, top quality effects.With the benefit of virtually no time taken to redevelop the principal characters, the story kicks in from the beginning, and the character development is devoted to the new cast of characters. What a twisted darkling lot they are!Make sure you stay for the bonus scene after end credits!I was most impressed with this work, and rate it slightly above the original for its story and a slightly superior adventure experience, at an 8.9/10 from...the Fiend :.",9,3,8,12 July 2006
Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl," Striking visuals, adventurous story, amazing execution.
","After years of enjoyable viewing of 21 Jump Street, some of us did not need this movie to appreciate Johnny Depp's talents and abilities as an actor. But for the rest of the world, this was the springboard for Depp's movie career.The movie begins with a hauntingly beautiful child singing of pirates on the misty bow of a ship. She is cautioned not to bring pirates down on them, by singing of them. Just after, a small boy is found floating on a piece of wreckage, and the young girl child immediately identifies him as a pirate, and hides his true nature/identity from her father the Governor and the captain of the ship upon which they sail.You then fade to the same little girl as a grown woman (Keira Knightly), dreaming of the day when she first found her William (Orlando Bloom) adrift in the sea. She's hidden his treasure in a secret compartment beneath one of the drawers in her bedside cabinet, and obviously treasures it, as she does him.The remainder of the movie, she attempts to find herself, discover whom she really is, and please her father at the same time. No easy task of ANY daughter.William has since become an apprentice to the blacksmith of the small seaside village in which they reside. He has learned his lessons so well, in fact, that his master sleeps in a peaceful but drunken slumber all the day while Will masters the work sent to their forge.These two are obviously in love, but Will knows his place, and refuses to be familiar with her in any way, in the presence of her father the Governor. Not quite the way to woo the lady's heart, there, Will.Enters now, Captain Jack Sparrow (Johnny Depp), in a sinking water-filled schooner. He himself bears no small resemblance to a bilge-rat, as he rides the main mast of the sinking ship right up to the harbor of the same village in which Elizabeth and William reside; Port Royal.His shenanigans will not be tolerated, as he soon learns, and he quickly finds himself in irons.We discover that Captain Jack Sparrow was once the captain of the Black Pearl; the most feared pirate's ship to sail the Caribbean Sea. This ship is rumored to have black sails, be crewed by the damned, and captained by an evil darker than any other.There has been some criticism of the vocabulary used by the pirates, but in reality, they did have quite the vocabulary. They had to trade in many different ports, using many different languages fluently in order to prevent themselves from being taken advantage of. These men were mostly self-educated, learning the hard way. And while most could not read and write, true enough, they could and would bargain with anyone which could uplift their situation.They sought fame and riches. Having been heard of was akin to the gunslingers of the US Western days having wanted posters of themselves jealously secreted away within their own saddlebags. They lived by a strict code of ethics, and experienced a very unstable lifestyle; feasting one day, while enduring famine the next.Also, the 'mascara' some critics have criticized, was usually Kohl, used commonly by sea-farers of the time to block the sun out of their eyes, much like football players use black stick, today. It does create a rather dramatic look, but was a common technique used in the days of such men as these.This story, while not wholly original, borrowed from every pirate movie I've ever seen, but uplifted and upgraded those old tales. It was extremely well told, convincingly executed, and brilliantly portrayed by Depp and Bloom. I've acquired a new respect for both of their work, of late, actually. And while this does not possess the epic qualities of some other recent productions, Bloom's talents were just as well exercised here as they were in his most recent success.As for the wardrobe of the pirates, they were in the Caribbean; an exotic place, populated by people of colorful cultures. Their dress, while basically British, was properly colored by the islands in which they prowled.Reportedly, having modeled his Jack Sparrow character closely after Keith Richards, Depp's flawless Cockney accent was quite believable and near perfect. He worked very hard on that portion of his character, as was obvious by his beautiful and colorfully wide use of the Cockney hyperbole. 'All by me onsie,' meaning all by myself, and so on.There was one element with which I had some qualms, however. That of the undead army. Having recently seen LotR: RotK, I could not help but compare the undead armies to one another, and found that this one was a tiny bit lacking. Their movements were sometimes choppy, hesitant, clumsy and not surreal as was Jackson's. These lacked the graceful, floating ghostly quality that was exhibited in Jackson's masterpiece. They ~looked~ real enough, but their movements were awkward and clumsy.Other than that, I was completely delighted with this endeavor, and cannot wait to see the next installment of this franchise. I hope it is a long-running one.It rates an 8.8/10 from...the Fiend :.",9,1,4,31 December 2003
Beauty and the Beast," Widely Loved Disney Adaptation of a Classic Love Story.
","As is Disney's way, this timeless classic has been adapted to animation complete with talking furniture, dancing dinner wear, and the most villainous villains. All wrapped up with a musical score worthy of the most highly funded Broadway show.This is one of the most endearing works Disney's animation crew has put out in years. As a romantic adventure, it's far above par, even for Disney, and rivals even Snow White in enchanting sweetness.While it's not my personal favorite, it is easily Disney's best animated romantic musical, and as such, it rates a 9.4/10 from...the Fiend :.",9,2,2,24 March 2007
"The Chronicles of Narnia: The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe"," Magickal
","This review is for the THEATRICAL VERSION.I must say the beginning of this endeavor brought the Lemony Snicket series immediately to mind. I do realize, of course, that the SoUE was written much later than the CoN; however, the casting choices for the parts of the children is more to what I refer. Naturally, there are four children here in the LW&W, where in SoUE there were three, but I think anyone could see the similarities quite easily. Indeed, in the opening moments of LW&W, I more than half expected to hear Jude Law's voice smoothing through the speakers to caution us that this would not be a happy tale.Many reviewers have (at this point) been quick to extol the striking similarities between the LW&W and the LotR, while others were more keen to demonstrate each detail of Christian symbolism Lewis found appropriately necessary to insert throughout his works, so I won't bore you with loads of those details. I have to point out a few, but that's only because the story is built around Christian myth and Tolkien's stolen ideas (reportedly alleged by Tolkien himself, not by this reviewer).I will, instead, attempt a different route and see where it leads us.*The introduction to our principal characters was an emotional one, setting up a small bit of character development, allowing you to 'know' them as well as a few minutes' insight into their lives will allow. *Edmond is the petulant one, Pete(r) is the responsible 'daddy-like' older brother. *Susan is 'just trying to be smart,' and Lucy's duty to the cast is to be adorable; a task which she performs beautifully.The comparison to the Baudelaire children is astounding. *Susan is darker haired, pouty-lipped, wannabe braniac very much like Violet. The physical and characterizational similarities are astounding. *Both Edmond and Pete(r) serve to give us Klaus. *The two characters combine to constitute the depth of character given us by Liam Aiken which says a great deal about the quality of his acting abilities. *And Lucy takes the place of the cutesy-kins, Sunny. Of course, Lucy is a bit older and therefore offers us a tad bit more than cute expressions, meaningless gurgles, and 'offered meanings' to her indiscriminate noises.*Their lives begin with startling parallel to the Baudelaires, in that their parents are absent from their lives, and they are sent to live with strangers. From there, the only resemblance to the cinematic SoUE work is the personalities of the characters, themselves. There are striking similarities between Count Olaf and the White Witch (portrayed brilliantly by Tilda Swinton who also was more than adequate in her role as the Archangel Gabriel in Constantine). As far as the Tolkien references/rip-offs/similarities, there are simply too many to detail, but to name a few...* the entrance to Mr. Tumnus's lair looks remarkably similar to the entrance to Bagg's End* the archetypal fiend was the 'White Witch,' whereas the LotR bears Saruman the White* beloved Gandalf sacrifices himself to save his friends, namely Frodo and dies at the hand of Magick used darkly and is 'reborn' even more powerful because he was not dark, himself...just as Aslan dies at the hands of those who use Magick darkly, and is reborn through the means of a Magickal sacred stone altar which will crack and negate a sacrifice made erroneously (Aslan gave his life in Edmond's stead so Aslan was not the traitor, but was sacrificed as one which activated the spell on the sacred stone.).* the battle scene build-up was very reminiscent of the larger, more involved Lord of the Rings battle at Helm's Deep, but not nearly as well done* the gryphons served the part of the Elves in that they were airborne in their assault...shredding beaks and rending talons rather than archer's arrows, but in the air none the less* ents* the maps were extremely Tolkien* Aslan returns from the grave like Gandalf, and for the same reason (the Laws of Magick)* the traveling party all received gifts from Santa Claus (also known as King of Elves)* right after Mr. Tumnus is released, the shot of the troupes marching across the rock bridge atop the mountains looked like it was straight out of LotR! Call it 'homage' if you will, but to Me, that was blatant...Now, I realize these Tolkien similarities (and there are more...many more) also involve the filming, direction, casting choices, location choices, DoP's choice of angles, etc. rather than what Tolkien and/or Lewis has written, hence My hesitation to sit here and go over any more of them. Those listed above are among the most obvious and blatant examples. There are more, to be sure.All in all, I found this movie more Pagan through its use of Nature and Sympathetic Magicks than Christian. Aslan did rise from the dead, but due to a Law of High Magick, rather than 'divine intervention,' thereby negating the Christian undertones completely. Honestly? I loved it. It was wonderful. It was the children's version of the Lord of the Rings saga.The CGI was decent, but Aslan was not as well done as he should have been, considering the staggering budget this movie was awarded, and the name 'Disney.' I always expect the very best from Disney. I am often disappointed. The CGI in no way failed. It just was not what it should have been. This one nearly lived up to its potential. It should have been epically filmed. At any rate, I found 'The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe' to be highly entertaining, heart-warming, and endearing.It rates an 8.5/10.",9,0,0,24 February 2006
"South Park: Bigger, Longer & Uncut"," Hugely Funny, Even If You're Not A Fan Of The Show!!
","Wild irreverence is the head liner here. There are many hilarious scenes, characters, story elements, and one-liners herein, which elevate this work above the television series.The charm is rich with potty humor, and standard South Park fare, but the culmination and execution of the movie is far richer and more intelligent in its execution than the series. Not to say that the series is unintelligent. It's not.Showing no respect for anyone or anything, including the standing cast of South Park, this work exalts itself IN its irreverence, if you can dig it.

Ice Age: The Meltdown," I Loved It!
","For some reason unknown to me, this second Ice Age installment is receiving lower ratings here at IMDb than the original. It is beyond me why that would be the case, as the second chapter is just as much fun.All four stars return for this second run (that's including Skrat), the story is just as compelling, the action is as uproarious as the comedic elements, and it wraps into a satisfying ending.For what more could you ask?

Prince of Persia: The Sands of Time," Not Dismal, But Weird
","This is a half of a beat off from beginning to end. The timing is off, but so is the cadence, the pace, and the plot. It feels behind itself by a half of a step throughout.Based on a video game, sometimes it is difficult to ink a believable storyline from the mindless game play, which seems to be one of the more serious issues herein.While Jake Gyllenhaal is made to closely resemble the game character he attempts to portray, he seems wholly out of place in his environ. Actually, I could not imagine where this interpretation of the character would belong. He is obviously not of Persian blood or descent, but moreover, his (clearly) Roman features stand out even more once he dons longer hair and infinite profile (and 2/3 and 3/4 profile) shots.The main problem I have with this film, I think, is Jake Gyllenhaal's presence as the lead character. I like his acting, and have no problem with him in general, but he was clearly not the one for this part.All in all?

","I'm sure this was supposed to be an art-house film featuring groups of people and their impromptu conversations over cigarettes and coffee. What it IS, is a contrived piece of crap that made me long for my two hours back! This is typical of Jarmusch and the trite, non-stylized crap he's passing off as art. There just aren't words for how boring, unintelligent, and devoid of intrigue I found this 'work.' It was reminiscent of something a six year old could film at nearly any Starbucks anywhere in the world. There's nothing 'artsy' about this, it's just total schlock. This is awful and bore no resemblance to anything with a script, direction, or talent.It rates a 1.2/10 from...the Fiend :.",1,4,11,18 March 2007
Spider-Man 2," Superior sequel that lacks vitality
","Before I start, let me say that I thought Spider-Man 2 was superior in every way to Spider-Man 1, but one.Honestly, I don't know what it was about Spider-Man 2 that I found lacking. While it was a better movie with excellent effects, great performances, well-conceived plot elements, and beautiful film shots, it still felt 'flat' in comparison to Spider-Man 1. Perhaps it was the fact that Peter had to surrender the mask this time. Or maybe it's that he wants to be with MJ so badly, but can't find the intestinal fortitude to be happy AND a super hero. Or it could be that I expected much more with a $61M budget increase. Whatever the dilemma, apparently it was felt by other movie-goers, since the return for that increased budget was down $23M from the first installment.This was like Superman 2 in that our hero chooses to be an earth-bound human to be with the gal he loves, discovers there's a new menace and immediately regrets his decision. Perhaps that was why it felt 'flat.' It's been done. But then again, what hasn't? This was a superior story with superior effects and action sequences that looked realistically played out rather than the CGI mess that was the first installment.Peter coming clean with Aune Mae was a difficult scene to watch. It was a courageous step on the character's part, and Aunt Mae reacted much the way I expected she would which lent a believable tone to the scene. The villain this time around is done extremely well. Gone is the camp of the first installment's treatment of the nemesis, and enters an age of superior CGI. After Spider-Man 1's Green Goblin, I was frankly reluctant in seeing this chapter. I'm glad, now, that I have. Doc Ock is malevolently beautiful in both design and execution. I thoroughly enjoyed his character.While the first Spider-Man rates a 7.4 (at IMDb) and received two Oscar nominations and Spider-Man 2 received none (but strangely, receives a 7.9 rating here at IMDb) the second installment was definitely above the original in every noticeable way. Yet it grossed less with a bigger budget and received no special effects Oscar nominations like the inferior Spider-Man 1 did, which leads me to believe that the lacking element, whatever that may be, affected more than just this movie Fiend.It rates an 8.2/10 from...the Fiend :.",8,14,24,17 January 2005
The Fifth Element," Amusing sci-fi/action/fantasy blockbuster fun-fare!
","Written, both screenplay and original literary work, and directed solely by Luc Besson, this movie (to me) is the epitome of his artistic genius.The storyline/plot being one of the most creative pieces of work in the sci-fi genre, is as follows:There have been many battles between those Beings who first populated our planet and their ancient enemy, the Dark Lord. Throughout the centuries, every 1000 years, the Fifth Element is reborn (Much like the Living Buddah of the religious system known as Buddaism) in time to go up against the Dark Lord and his minions, the Mangalore. Only every thousand years, can he attack the planet Earth, in his attempt to conquer the universe.Along with the dynamics of the storyline, there are some twists which have to be figured out, which makes the movie even more interesting and enjoyable in this almost Egyptian-styled science fiction action/comedy.The effects are good, though some of them are a bit hokey, such as the guy's 'mirror hat' in the first scene with Bruce Willis's character. On the whole, Joe and Yvonne Hobbs (wardrobe master/mistress) should be shot for the costumes they came up with in this movie. They are completely deplorable. There is NO sense of style, nothing even remotely believable was used, and the war gear belonging to the Mangalore warriors was flimsy as all h*ll and appeared to have come from a child's toy packet available at your local flea market for $4.99 + tax.Other than the costuming/wardrobing; however, this movie is one of the best in its class. The lines were well-delivered, the storyline flows nicely, with little or no stops, and the action and creatively crafted technological advances are quite thought-provoking, as well as highly entertaining.The stars of this movie are Bruce Willis as Major Korben Dallas, Gary Oldman as Jean-Baptiste Emanuel Zorg, Ian Holm as Priest Vito Cornelius, Milla Jovovich as Leeloo, Chris Tucker as DJ Ruby Rhod, the most colorful and inventive character of the movie. Without ruby Rhod, there would BE no 'Fifth Element,' the movie. His character is the most entertaining, brilliant and totally hilarious of the entire list of personalities in this production.Bruce Willis just shines as Korben Dallas. His character is very well developed, well portrayed and carries that classic Bruce Willis style we've come to love. His character is smiling, sweet, caring and sensitive, yet tough and rough and ready for action at any moment. Brilliant portrayal by Willis.Gary Oldman; however, stank UP the place. Sorry, but his performance as Zorg was about as believable as Miss Piggy as a lead newscaster on CNN. 'He's about dumb,' my cousin-in-law. 'Squiggy could've done a better job.'Ian Holm is convincing and genuine in his portrayal as Priest Vito Cornelius, the priest who was trained for his whole life, for the moment when the Fifth Element would walk through his door. But what else would you expect from Ian Holm?Even Vladimir McCrary shines in his brief but poignant role as the 'human' Aknot, the Mangalore leader.The wonders of fantasy instilled by Besson are genius: the flying Far Eastern restaurant, the ancient race of bardic Divas personified here by Diva Plavalaguna (portrayed convincingly and with sheer talent, style and grace by Besson's lover Maïwenn Le Besco) and so many other fantastical treats to grace the visual need for 'Eye Candy.'This movie gives you depth, fantasy, and science fiction at its best; love and action, action, action.Enters: Ruby Rhod, in a live broadcast throughout the universe. He's an overdressed, flamboyant bi-sexual drag queen with a wonderfully phallic hairstyle. His wonderful sense of humor and the sexuality of the character he portrays comes through loud and clear in what is possibly the best acting of Chris Tucker's career. And his screams of fright will send you into spasmodic fits of laughter.The starship jockeys smoke ganja as they change the plutonium cores of the ships; torching the fuzzy, somewhat (Star Trek's) tribble-esquire space parasites from the ships' underbellies; and rocking to a nice soft island beat. A nice addition which occurs just before the first explosion of the movie, taking you fully by surprise.This movie has a very good feeling about it, even though it was written by Besson when he was quite young. I've understood he was a teenager when he first wrote this story, but it got revamped when he directed it as an adult.If you liked 'Stargate,' the 'Lethal Weapon' (for the action/comedy combination) series of movies, or 'Total Recall,' you will like the 'Fifth Element.'I absolutely loved this movie. The fight scene during the Diva's performance personifies Besson's genius. The choreography and execution of these two combined scenes is simply magnificent. In watching the movie again, for this review, I will say that this scene is moving in some way I can't explain. It's in a good way, but I can't explain how or why.That scene is the climax of the movie, and in my opinion, it totally redeems anything else you don't like such as the wardrobe of the characters. After this scene, the movie rock and rolls to a very satisfying end.As an afternote, I would like to add that I highly recommend the High Definition digitally remastered Ultimate Edition which contains over 120 minutes of documentaries, featurettes, plus a feature-length trivia fact track, and more. It's well worth the money and the bother of replacing your old copy.It gets a 9.1/10 from...the Fiend :.",9,1,2,16 September 2003
Batman Returns," Disappointing but not dismal Burton sequel
","The campy, carnival-like atmosphere above ground, while utter insanity in the guise of the Penguin stalks the city, beneath. Sounds intriguing to watch, doesn't it?But Gotham City just isn't what it used to be. Gone, are the beautifully designed Gothic structures, replaced by gadgetry and standard, disappointing Hollywood fluff. There is plenty of eye candy, but that does not distract you from the fact that so much else is lacking. Has Burton lost his edge? I wouldn't think so. But in this attempt, he resorts to obvious fifth-grader tactics to amuse us; ie: the Penguin drooling black filth from his mouth throughout most of his scenes (what WAS that crap, anyway?), and killer clowns (which were oh so reminiscent of the detrital film, 'Killer Klowns from Outer Space' and the 60's camp of Adam West). While this production was still quite entertaining, it held none of the wondrous edge from the original masterpiece. I did, however, love the performances of the principal actors; Michael Keaton as Batman (Bruce Wayne), Danny DeVito as The Penguin/Oswald Cobblepot, Michelle Pfeiffer as Catwoman/Selina Kyle, Christopher Walken as Max Shreck, and that wonderful Michael Gough as Alfred Pennyworth. Their portrayals were quite professional; the character depth was well developed and everyone contributed what I feel was their very best. What lacked here, in my opinion, was that lovely darkling nightmarish feel from the first. The Dark Knight having been turned into the Light Grey Knight, Gotham (Gothic) City was dismayingly morphed into a Carnival Midway, and the allowance of the horrid 60's camp at which we all groaned and rolled our eyes to creep into this otherwise darkly amusing production was just purely wrong. Sorry, but I fail to find having my gag reflex triggered to be entertaining. Honestly, I was still amused by this flick. DiVito's talent for acting is above reproach, though I found his constant black drool to be completely repulsive and it turned me off of his character totally. Again, that falls into the area of directing, and in no way cheapens his performance. Michelle Pfeiffer's Catwoman was mildly reminiscent of Eartha Kitt's portrayal and thus endeared the character. While she delivered her own style and talents to the characters of Seline and Catwoman, she portrayed Catwoman beautifully as a witty, intelligent seductress. Hers was a wonderful performance and I loved the perpetuation of the romance between Batman and Catwoman. 'It's the so-called normal guys who always let you down. Sickos never scare me. At least they're committed.' Seline to Bruce Wayne. The attempt to humanize Bruce Wayne was a serious mistake. Gone is the edgy, almost sinister feel to the Gothic hero, the 'Dark Knight.' Enter, instead, the comedic equivalent; this reincarnation of a masterpiece. It didn't work for me on any level. Bruce Wayne, cracking jokes, forgetting his coat over some piece of fluff girl, and snapping off one-liners to the bad guys as he pretends to kick their butts. What a disappointment after the last Burton attempt.I found the change to be sad, rather than fresh or edgy. There were several points of this production that I found to be quite unoriginal. Penguin's plan to kidnap/kill the first born sons of Gotham was rather Biblesque and lame. The James Bondesque music during Shreck's party was rather tasteless. As I mentioned before, the whole movie had a 'Killer Klowns from Outer Space' feel to it beneath the failed attempt to be Gothic and dark as the original from which this spawned. The voice designated to Penguin's computer alert system at the climax of the movie was very V'ger-like (Star Trek: the Motion Picture), bordering on identical. And I've got one question. If the Penguin's army is penguins, and he himself identifies with penguins...WHY is he driving around in something as infantile as a rubber duck? Just another contrived and trashy element I found disturbing and unattractive. 'How outstanding! You're Beauty AND the Beast, in one luscious Christmas gift-pack.' Penguin.While this production fell short of the first, it was still a fun and enjoyable movie, if only for the performances of the main players. I am frankly glad that Burton will not be directing the next installment of this, the 'modern' Batman series. I am looking forward to Jim Carey and Tommy Lee Jones's performances. But Val Kilmer in the leading role? We'll just have to wait and see. This one rates a 8.1/10 from...the Fiend :.",8,1,2,1 October 2003
Finding Nemo," Great Disney fun! One of the best, of late.
","Finding Nemo was a sheer delight, comparable to Lilo and Stitch, but made more like Toy Story. Pixar has really accomplished a classic telling with this one.Nemo is a small clown fish who is the sole survivor of his clutch. His only living family is his father, as his mother was eaten while defending her clutch of eggs. As a result, his father is a complete almost non-functioning paranoid who would be happy to just live inside his anemone with his sun, and never venture out for anything.This, of course, does not set well with his son, who is your average, adventurous child in every way but one; he has a deformity which gives his paranoid father all the excuses he needs to closet his child and keep him from the world.Stolen from his father's loving and watchful eye by divers (probably American, one of the other fish proclaims) Nemo is taken into the world of humans and deposited inside an aquarium where he will be given as a present to Darla the Fish Killer.Meanwhile, his father races after the boat, loses the trail and must rely on the assistance of Dory, she of the short term memory loss. Ellen DeGeneres as Dory, literally steals the show with her dialog and lines which are hilariously funny. Marlin the clown fish hunts after his son for weeks, swimming hundreds of miles in search of his lost son.I highly recommend this movie to anyone who needs a good laugh, and a good shot of wholesome Disney. I was a bit taken aback by the anti-American line in this movie, considering it IS an American production AND Disney, to boot, but I suppose it is just Disney's little jibe at those who would blame America for everything, when it turns out an Australian was the one who stole Nemo, after all. *shrugs* I don't know, but it did not sit well with me. But it was just one line, and the rest of the movie was wonderful.It rates an 8.9/10 from...the Fiend :.",9,0,1,25 December 2003
Blade," Even If You're Not A Fan Of The Comic Book Series, This Is One GREAT Vampire Flick!
","This isn't the best vampire flick I've seen, but it is ONE of the best. The action is non-stop, serving up car chasing, head butting, bone crunching, heart staking pandemonium any vampire fan would be proud of. The acting is good enough to sell the plot and its few contrivances, and the story is exciting and involved enough to hold you throughout.Wesley Snipes is awesome as Blade. This is how a Comic Book movie SHOULD be made! I sincerely enjoyed this one, whereas most other comic book adaptations have left me cold. A few of the best have been made contemporarily: Blade, Spiderman 1&2, Batman Begins, and Ghost Rider.Blade definitely belongs on that list.It's awesome, and rates an 8.4/10 from...the Fiend :.",8,0,2,18 March 2007
X-Men Origins: Wolverine," Popcorn Fun For Casual Fans
","This was intended to be an emotionally gripping journey through Wolverine's past history, through the decades; centuries; from the angst of pre-pubescent man-cub-hood; through sibling bonding, rivalry, and the reunification which often occurs in healthy adults.It fails in that it lacks the emotionality for which it strives, and then drops the ball in its demonstration of his progression through the ages. Too much is missing, too much is glossed over, too much is simply left lying in the annals of Untold Story. Some time is devoted to character development, but as an Origins story, I have to say that this sadly lacked in the area of origins of the lead character.I won't go on and on as some others have. Suffice it to say that if you're a casual fan, you'll find more to love than avid fans will find. I enjoyed it, but on a purely popcorn level.It rates an 8.6/10 from...the Fiend :.",9,2,5,27 May 2009
The Mummy," Fun and entertaining modern rethinking of an old classic.
","What a wonderful adventure! This is one of my (many) favorite movies!!Let me start this by saying that badly done CGI, like bad acting, should be avoided at all costs and should NEVER be allowed to be included in the finished product of any production.Case and point: the Scorpion King from Mummy Returns. It was horrible; deplorable; and just downright nasty-looking. He was no better than the worst video game character ever drawn by an 8 year old in green crayon. Okay, that having been said, the argument in the industry is that CGI is taking jobs away from LIVE actors and giving them to computer nerds. That is simply NOT the case. Case and point: again, Mummy Returns. Do you honestly believe the producers would have paid two million extras the standard SAG fees and make up artists for these two million extras, or wardrobe for these two million extras to comprise the Army of Annubis? The answer is a resounding H*LL NO! My point is that before the diversity of CGI became known, movies lacked SO MUCH in detail. You either had the omission of the army all together, or about 20 shots of the same fifteen guys, all in different costumes, trying in vain to make it SEEM as though there was an army. Either way, what you got was deplorable. CGI definitely has its place in cinema. Another prime example of excellent CGI in use is in this production, 'The Mummy.' The opening sequence of the WORKING ancient Egyptian city of Thebes is one of the most awe-inspiring film sequences I've ever experienced, but Ancient History is a hobby of mine. The only time I have any problem at all with CGI is when it's badly done, as in the example I mentioned earlier. It greatly enhances our ability to enjoy the story when the eye-candy is well done and in place. Those shots of the Army of Annubis are simply staggering. They look realistic and they are so well done as to make you believe, if only for a moment, that they ARE real.The love story between Imhotep and Anck Su Namun is a classic, and is as historically correct as that of Isis and Osiris, and while this is classified as a 'remake,' I simply do not care to compare this epic to the original hit.How can you compare a true masterpiece of horror from 1932; a time when there were NO believable effects, no mastered technology of CGI, and the standard SAG fees for extras was around $6 a day. (It WAS the depression era, after all) Since the development of the technology used in 'Star Wars, Episode 4, A New Hope,' computer effects have evolved into a true state of art. I have absolutely no beef with CGI, its use, nor the use of it over live actors. As I have already stated above, my only problem with CGI is when it is badly done.In this movie, it was NOT badly done. I loved the 'Indiana Jones' adventure feel of this movie. I loved the fact that they took a dark and dreary (badly done, in my opinion) original campy old horror flick and turned it into an absolute feast for those of us who love the eye candy. I am also an Ancient History hobbyist, and this movie really sparked my imagination. As I've already stated, the opening scenes of Thebes were so inspiring, I was hooked from the very first moment this movie began to play on the big screen.Brendan Fraser, to me, demonstrates his acting abilities in this production, showing his agents and all those around him that he is SO much above frivolous drivel like 'Monkey Bone' and 'Encino Man.' I hope he never EVER has to resort to such a waste of his talents, again.Rachael Weisz is a sheer delight. Her character is totally believable, romantic, soft and lady-like while maintaining a tough interior personality. Not easily done. Bravo, Ms. Weisz! What an excellent performance!I will not detail the plot here, as there are hundreds of reviews already posted to this site about this movie, alone. It will suffice it to say that, in the Fiend's opinion, this movie is a wonderful adventure, featuring stellar performances and outstanding effects. I adore this movie.It's one of the Fiend's many favorites.It rates a 9.2/10 from...the Fiend :.",9,2,3,28 September 2003
Constantine," Not As Bad As Some Say
","This is another unfortunate jaunt into the world of Comic Book Land. I wasn't in a hurry to see this movie. I've seen the Matrix. This was not the Matrix; however. It is dark, stars Keanu Reeves, and even has some of the same 'feel' as the Matrix, but this story is completely different. Although I was disturbed by the not-so-latent homosexuality of Satan, I found it quite enjoyable. KR plays his part well and Rachael Weiss is excellent as the supporting female lead. I have no qualms about this adaptation, or this production as a whole.The art of adapting comic books is quite difficult and requires a real understanding of the universe from which you are creating a new work. This attempt left me feeling like well, at least they tried. While it lacks the dynamics of the X-Men franchise, it is far more bold than other substandard comic book/video game lines (Daredevil, Hulk, Doom, Streetfighter) and pulls itself up well with no support from anywhere except the DC comics upon which this is based; specifically, 'Dangerous Habits,' the edition in which John Constantine contracts lung cancer and then negotiates his way out of it.Check out the nod to Alien 3 with the 'dog-alien' face lick and what appears to be a little bit of the musical score from that same movie. I really enjoyed Constantine and can't wait to own it on DVD.It rates a 6/10 from...the Fiend :.",6,9,25,20 February 2005
Troy," Rousing, if historically inaccurate
","A lot of proselytizing and posturing has been done concerning this work, so I will not bore you with more of the same.What I will say is that this movie was entertaining. It was historically inaccurate, but otherwise well done as a means of entertainment. I thoroughly enjoyed this endeavor, the performances, and the story itself, although archeology.org has debunked most of the plot and even the situation of the lay out of the area. It would have been nice to have been handed a good bit of history along with this battle-torn work, but all in all, I have to say it was quite good.The story was quite inventive, all things considered, and the characters were developed well enough as to allow you to gain a small measure of kinship with them. The two Golden Boys of the Biz did well in the execution of their characters, as one would expect.Filmed in the opus of the epic, the climaxail battle was rousing, and the movie played out to a satisfying, if disturbing, end.It rates an 8.1/10 from...the Fiend :.",8,5,10,22 January 2005
Terminator Salvation," I liked it better than I expected, and was far less disappointed in comparison than other fans seem to have been.
","Wow, where do we start with a franchise film so rich in history...and so riddled with continuity errors? The time line problems began with the very first sequel, directed by Cameron himself, and perpetuated with T3. why then, is everyone so freaked by time line errors in T4? Depending on which line to which you subscribe, T4 still deviates vastly from BOTH sequels and begins a new alternative reality spin all its own.And then there was the highly publicized expletive-filled Bale rant broadcast over and over and over ad nauseum. Upon seeing the film, I can better understand why that happened...this is a GRITTY film, full of angst and dancing testosterone. As 'worked up' as Bale must have had to have been in order to pull off these angst-filled scenes (one after the other after the next), he exhibited amazing control in not HITTING the guy who blew the scene for him. I'm no longer upset or offended by his diatribe.That brings us to the movie. Well, yes, there are problems with it, and many state that this film brings little to the franchise history and instead contributes to the growing list of errors and problems with the franchise, but I have to disagree.This work, for me, demonstrates an intent to give us millions of machines marching en masse on human survivors in the attempt to quell a birthrate upsurge of the pestilence which has somehow managed to take control of its world...Mankind. The promise for something better is not only present due to how little this movie actually contributes, but by the actions and deeds therein.There are several contrivances, and truthfully they were rewriting the script as it was being filmed due to Bale's demands, but all in all (and all things considered), this is an enjoyable film that not only is better on second viewing, but manages to ingratiate itself into the library of Terminator franchise films (or will when it's out on DVD in an unrated, extended director's cut edition, that is).I liked it better than I expected, and was far less disappointed in comparison than I was with the Star Trek reboot.It rates a 7.8/10 from...the Fiend :.",8,240,387,27 May 2009
Insomnia," Effective cat and mouse.
","Very effective cat and mouse psychological thriller. Nice suspense even WITH Pacino.I'm not a fan of Al Pacino's work. I haven't really liked but 6 or so films he's ever done, so I didn't have high expectations of this movie. That, combined with my fore-knowledge that the copy I had skipped and fluttered, didn't have me on the edge of my seat to watch it.I watched this movie as a test study, actually. I watched this movie as a test study concerning the possible worth and watchability of the upcoming new release of Batman (Batman 5). Since Chris Nolan is listed as the director of this new undertaking, I thought I would check him out.I must say that I was delightfully surprised. This is a wonderful cat and mouse 'time is running out' suspense with twists and turns you never expect.I found it unpredictable and edgy. Williams always struck me as the type who would do this genre quite well. I'm happy to see him spreading his wings beyond comedic/character acting. This could be the beginning of a whole new career for him. Quite honestly, I hope so. I have felt for some time that his style of comedy had just about run its course. Way to go, Robin Williams! It must have taken great courage to try a movie like this, after all these years of comedy/dramas. Hats off.I will not outline the plot here. Everyone else does that and I find it tedious after a while. But I will say that if you like a good suspense, a dark quirky cat and mouse, this is the movie for you. Excellent remake, as well. That is indeed a rarity.And in conclusion, I feel that if Chris Nolan devotes the same level of darkness and atmosphere to Batman 5 that he did to this movie, he just may save the series and kick-start a whole new run of (hopefully) good Batman movies. Here's hoping.It rates a solid 8/10 from...the Fiend :.",8,0,0,1 October 2003
The Jungle Book," Genuinely Witty, Most Memorable Classic Disney Animation.
","This is not my very favorite, but it IS among the very best of Disney's animated classics. With unforgettable characters, endearing dialog, and an irascible wit that permeates throughout, Wolfgang Reitherman's The Jungle Book features some of the best animation, voice parts, and story in the Disney vaults.The original songs are still as enigmatic as ever, and so are the characters. This is one of my very favorites, although not the top. That position belongs to Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs, but the Jungle Book presses a very close second.If you have kids, are a kid at heart, or collect Disney features, this is a must have in the collection.

The Day After Tomorrow," Uneven But Entertaining Horror
","If this was supposed to deliver a warning, it failed. If it was intended to entertain, it hit its mark.Stunning visuals, compelling story, and gritty performances mark this Emerich tale from beginning to end. Graphically speaking, this film is amazing. The visuals are completely awesome; wholly realistic. The story line runs smoothly as possible, with gaping scientific holes reminiscent of Gore's alarmist presentation in An Inconvenient Truth. This is in no way what WILL happen. The story embraces the most unintelligent of popular tripe and capitalizes on the fears of the ignorant. But in an entertaining way. If you are intelligent enough to ignore the environmental posturing to enjoy the fictitious story presented, this can be a great way to spend a couple of hours.It rates a 7.8/10 from...the Fiend :.",8,1,2,18 March 2007

X-Men," Dazzling depth for a comic book movie
","I love this series of comic books, and I was not disappointed with the movie, although the character development I had hoped would be rich, was almost nonexistent, and there wasn't enough movie here to satisfy. It is 104 minutes long and needed to be at least two hours to enable some decent character development. While they tried, they fell short of what I would deem acceptable in this area.Other than that, this movie was very well done. The action sequences were rousing, the portrayals given were a good start in the right direction. The direction itself proved to be inspired, and the sets were creative.This whole production was executed in a manner which lent the darkling feel of mystery captured in the comic book, and some awe-inspiring CG-Eye Candy sequences made this film appear to be more than it should have been.The casting is one element which gave this movie its incredible success, but the effects and story were the products of a great and loving care devoted to the production of this movie, and it shows with each and every scene. This is a classic good vs. evil story with some romance, loads of action, a great story, and wonderful creative characters. It is pure sci-fi/action fan-boy delight.Let me also say that I highly recommend the X-Men 1.5 Edition. With over 5 hours of features, interviews and exclusive new extras, it is a bargain at the asking price!It rates an 8.2/10 from...the Fiend :.",8,0,0,26 November 2003
Spider-Man 3," Clearly the Best...and Hopefully the End
","When it comes to Spider-man, Raimi clearly knows his business! I was a bit apprehensive when I saw the black suit. I already knew that the Green Goblin 2 would be involved, there was the back story and sub-plotted love triangle romance between Parker, MJ, and Osborne, Sandman was cast, and the black Spidey-suit clearly indicated the Venom storyline (a fact highly debated here on the IMDb boards, but I KNEW ;) ) Subsequently, I was afraid Sam was going to try to do too much with this film.My worry was for naught. This movie skillfully meshes the complete, intricately woven web of intrigue, suspense, action, drama, and romance into one beautiful gossamer masterpiece, with the exception of the dysfunctional relationship element. I know much of the lure to Spiderman is that he is a regular guy who makes mistakes in the relationship department, can't hold a job, has an awkward relationship with his only living relative, and makes other mistakes too many to mention, but the dysfunctional aspects were too heightened here to garner appreciation and sympathy towards the lead character. In fact, they were a put off to this work.There IS one other aspect I can't say I loved: The CGI treatment was discernible. I think when CGI is prolifically used, it should be used well, and not be blatantly obvious to the untrained eye. In several places in this film, it was just that...not used well, and blatantly obvious to anyone looking...but again, it was only in places. It wasn't enough to bring down the whole movie. It DID serve to distract, however.I won't detail the plot as so many have done. Suffice it to say that this was the perfect ending to this franchise. End it now, before it can suffer franchise sickness and bad installments. This was pure perfection. Let's leave it to graze majestically.There has been some buzz around Hollywood concerning Spider-man 4. Frankly, this movie closes all the necessary gaps and winds things up in a satisfactory conclusion. I see no reason to continue this franchise. End it on a high note, and let it go in glory. Please. But, Raimi seems to have moved on to other projects. He has recently sold a M4TV movie idea to Terry Goodkind, concerning his widely popular series, 'The Sword of Truth Novels,' namely 'Wizard's First Rule.' And, if the rumors are true, Raimi has been approached by New Line's Bob Shaye concerning direction of the impending Peter Jacksonless Hobbit endeavor. Let's hope Raimi has the sense to pass on that one! Half the world would hate him! At least, Jackson fans would, and that equates many, many movie-goers to boycott that work.It rates a 9.4/10 from...the Fiend :.",9,2,6,8 May 2007
Resident Evil: Extinction," Deserving and Disturbing Sequel but NOT the Conclusion of a Trilogy
","We saw this at our local hometown theater, Movies on the Parkway in Sevierville, TN. I have to start this by saying that this installment is a bit reminiscent of George A. Romero's 1985 cult classic, 'Day of the Dead,' in one major plot element. I won't give it away, but if you're a Romero fan, you'll see it for yourself when you view this film.This work is wholly entertaining, whether you are a fan of the games, or not. There are new elements, old friends, and a plethora of great innovations - some of which I've never seen present anywhere, and a few which were reminders of former masterpieces. I would name them, but to do that would spoil these innovations for those of you who have yet to experience them.The acting, direction, and quality were above par, while the style was more that of the action flick with horror elements. The predecessors were horror movies with great action. The suspense, the intrigue, the atmosphere were all horror-oriented. This time, the horror elements were minimized and the action reigned. This is not a bad thing, fans. Without some change like this, the franchise will suffer franchise sickness! As it stands, there is no danger of that happening.All in all? We were totally entertained, enjoyed our movie experience, and were blown away by the wrap-up. See it for yourself to understand what I mean.It rates an 8.9/10 from...the Fiend :.",9,140,246,25 September 2007
Zodiac," Great Film!
","I have to start this review by saying if you want a slasher flick, this isn't it. This is more a light dramatization of the events surrounding the Zodiac slayings, and is not intended to satisfy your splatter needs. Additionally (and surprisingly) a survivor of a Zodiac attack, when interviewed on CNN live, proclaimed this movie to be 'chillingly accurate' in its depiction of his encounter with the Zodiac.With a real documentary-like feel, in an entertaining fashion, this story unfolds in a timely manner, and really delivers. As a docu-drama, it is surprisingly entertaining. If forensics, criminal histories, journalistic intrigues, or serial killers are of an interest to you, this movie will hold you in thrall.I thoroughly enjoyed this work, and can't wait to include it into my DVD collection.It rates an 8.6/10 from...the Fiend :.",9,4,14,7 March 2007
The Terminator," Some of the best of 80's sci-fi.
","Of all the 1980's science fiction movies to come out, I think this one was one of my favorites. It was so very unique and original a story as to fully capture the imagination. The animatronics they used for the Terminator was so realistic without ever coming off as contrived or phony. Even when they used the obvious dummy for Schwarzenegger's face right after he took out his eyeball, it looked good. If they had had the techniques in CGI we have now, it would have been much better, but alas! They did not.This was an excellent story which was well-executed, and was far greater than the sum of its parts. I loved it through and through. It's hard to believe they made this movie for less than 10M. Great acting, wonderful plot, good effects, and excellent direction make for a blockbuster hit for years to come.A definite must-have for all fans of the sci-fi/action genres.It rates an 8.0/10 from...the Fiend :.",8,0,1,7 January 2004
Sleepy Hollow," A gossamer darkling Gothic masterpiece!
","The Burton/Depp combination has really paid off with a truly chilling top notch production.This is by far Depp's best work (until the 2003 release of Pirates of the Caribbean: Curse of the Black Pearl, that is), and I have had to completely re-evaluate my opinion of his talent.This, the latest remake of the old classic, 'The Legend of Sleepy Hollow,' briefly entitled 'Sleepy Hollow' is a true masterpiece of Gothic horror. Burton showed us what sinister darkling treasures resided within himself with his initial production of 'Batman,' and his liberal use of Gothic architecture throughout the city of Gotham. I LOVED that single installment of the Batman franchise strictly because Burton knew what to DO with the Dark Knight. Well, he knew what to do with Sleepy Hollow, as well. The performances by all involved were wonderful, the sets and designs were awesomely constructed and executed; and the direction, camera angles, shots, film quality, and even dialog were absolute perfection.Overall, this is a marvelous endeavor which I have enjoyed watching over and over.Additionally, Johnny Depp 'adopted' Goldeneye, the one-eyed Andalusian horse who played Gunpowder, Ichabod Crane's steed, thereby saving him from the glue factory. Just thought I'd mention that. It raised my estimation of the man's character a bit, upon reading that here at IMDb.It rates a 9.2/10 from...the Fiend :.",9,0,1,30 December 2003
Silent Hill," I'm writing this as a NON-fan of the game.
","I have to begin this by saying that I don't understand the confusion. I followed the story line just fine, without benefit of ever having played the game. Other reviewers have declared this screenplay to be a convoluted mess, but I don't understand their perspective, as I had no trouble in following the storyline. Perhaps that was a 'perceived' storyline, as I do have enough imagination to answer my own questions, filling in the blanks as the movie goes along, but either way, the time was lacking for the type of character and story development most seem to need in order to enjoy this work.Silent Hill is a darkling wonder of twists and turns. It is one of the few contemporary horrors which caught me and moved me to the edge of my seat. I found it exhilarating and genuinely thrilling.It rates an 8.4/10 from...the Fiend :.",8,5,10,18 March 2007
Star Wars: Episode VI - Return of the Jedi," Good, But Not As Good As The First Two
","This time, directed by Richard Marquand with Lawrence Kasdan writing the screenplay once more based on Luca$'s original work.Well here we are. I must say that this is my least favorite of the Original Trilogy. It is a wonderful story, the great original cast from the first two (Episodes 4 & 5), and the story is excellent. The execution is superb, and the entertainment value is every bit as good as those before it.That having been said, I'll also say from the start, that the reason I like this installment much less was the addition of the child-friendly Ewoks and their subsequent marketability. It was a cheap and obvious ploy to market yet another Star Wars toy. It worked, but it was still cheap and common. I am very dissatisfied with this practice. If a character 'sells,' then fine. But do NOT create a character, or as in this case, a group of characters merely to up-sell the merchandise.Okay, I'm done with that.This third installment (which works out to be the sixth of the series) was fun, and spirited. The dark and suspenseful atmosphere built by the story is negated by too many 'light' and warm, fuzzy moments, thereby lessening the worth of this attempt. It was not the deeply pondering, mystically oriented, action-fest as were the previous two blockbusters.It was still fun, however. Enjoyable and entertaining, it was.In the 2004 DVD edition, there are superfluous additional scenes designed to distract you from the realization that there was a blatant waste of film time present, but that ploy fails to work if you are like me, and own the original original on VHS. That smoke screen is not evident, and these contrivances are thereby more obvious.This installment is colored with beautiful vistas, rousing action, and a quiet sentimentality which permeates all. Yoda is old, and he is sick. Skywalker is done with his training as a Jedi, save for one small final test: He must face Vader once and for all.There are some added scenes and characters in the background of this installment; edited in no doubt for the DVD release of the 2004 box set. These were undoubtedly designed to lead us into the third trilogy which Luca$ now says will never happen. If watching through that media, you will doubtless see clandestine meetings and furtive exchanges which lead no where in this work, leading one to only suppose that Luca$ intended something, we just were not supposed to know what. And yet, Luca$ neither directed, nor wrote this work, so we can only assume the writer was going off of the fact that there were three more Episodes for which to write tieins.As much as I disliked the Ewoks, I must say that I was delighted to discover that Warwick Davis, beloved Willow, was Wicket the Ewok. That makes them almost bearable.'Ewoks. They blow.' Scream 2 While this chapter does have a satisfying ending, it is obvious that it is not THE end. At least Howard the Duck was honest in its attempt.It rates an 8.8/10 from...the Fiend :.",9,0,1,18 March 2007
The Expendables," We really had fun.
","Was it cheesy? Yes. Was it nostalgic? Yes. But it never takes itself too seriously. There are some really nice one-liners, and a lot of reminiscing about the good old days (presumably the 1980's), but Micky Roarke manages a very nice serious scene which attempts to speak for the overall tonality of these types of films and the American audience's thirst for them. I found it completely enjoyable; cheesy without outright camp; an ultra-violent flick with no gratuitous sex to speak of; fun, funny, and ... did I mention fun? On the whole this is an actioner with enough camaraderie to make you wish you were there and with enough explosions and casual violence to make you glad you aren't.There is (surprisingly) a plot. Yes, there are holes big enough to drive a Schwarzenegger through, but there IS as plot. It remains simple enough so as not to lose the avid fans of these films, but complex enough to engage the average movie goer. Typically, those who seem to be the most disappointed by this film are the newer generations who really had no idea what to expect from these guys, or the avid fans for whom nothing would have been enough. I am a casual fan of actioners, so for me, this was great fun. This film delivers performances we expect from these seasoned pros, a better than expected story, and super hot action. We really had fun.It rates an 8.8/10 from...the Fiend :.",9,3,9,30 August 2010
Blade II," Great Style, Great Movie, But Doesn't Quite Match The First.
","This chapter of the Blade trilogy does not quite deliver the same atmosphere as the first installment, but still brings enjoyment, a capable cast, and a good story.I can't rate this one as high as the first, but it's still a great vampire film, which delivers some of the best elements. This delivers some gritty action from beginning to end.Wesley Snipes is awesome in this. I thoroughly enjoyed it, and that's saying a lot where horror sequels are concerned. They are seldom as fulfilling as this, although it is far from a masterpiece.I liked it, but didn't love it.It rates a 7.6/10 from...the Fiend :.",8,3,5,18 March 2007
Megamind," Has Heart and Entertains
","While this may not be as cute as 'Despicable Me' in my opinion, it contributes more to the entertainment of the masses than 'Cloudy With A Chance of Meatballs.' 'Megamind' is one of those 'superhero' films with every necessary element to insure its eventual place in the 'classic' category. This one has a rich story, a few twists, and a nice (although unexpected) resolution. The voice cast is most excellent, and I found the story to be compelling.I was surprised by how much I enjoyed Megamind. I particularly like the level of character development, which was nominal but enough to endear the characters, leaving more time for story and less time for wasted film. That's always a plus, in my book. As I said, the story is rich, well written, and smartly executed. I'll probably own this as no Will Ferrell collection could possibly be complete without it. ;) All in all, this is a good flick for the kids with a good overall morality. It's fun for adults, too, but probably not for Friday or Saturday night viewing unless you're into the new cartoon revolution (which I seem to be LOL).It rates a 7.8/10 from ...the Fiend :.",8,0,2,19 December 2010
Alien," Darkly atmospheric, if not downright terrifying
","I'll start this off by saying that this review is not for the theatrical version, but the extended Director's Cut from the Quadrilogy Collection.While this movie is some 25 years old, it hardly feels dated at all, aside from the actors appearing so young in comparison to now. Also, aside from 'Gorillas In The Mist,' this is some of the best work of Sigourney Weaver's career.Ridley Scott, although relatively new to the cinematic scene at this time with only two theatrical directions under his belt, was prolific in direction through the media of television. While these are two totally different animals, he demonstrated a thorough understanding of the way things should be done. He introduces his characters and builds their development in a nice, easy flow without boring his audience with what can sometimes be a tedious demonstration of humanity.He introduces his story, gives you a sketchy outline through dialog clever in that it does provide that outline and backdrop of the situation at hand while eluding to what will be coming up, without giving it to you on a silver platter. Obscurity (hiding things in the shadows) is a virtue when building suspense, and he proves with Alien that, even at this early stage of development in his career, he has mastered that phenomenon.As the tension builds, so the story deepens, providing you with highly suspenseful, edge-of-your-seat moments, and some really good scares, as the story itself is strong enough to draw you in.The 'monster' this time is, as the title would indicate, an Alien, but one the likes of which you've never seen. It is intelligent, bestial, brutal, and yet beautiful. The Alien is born of a pod lovingly laid by its Queen Mother, then reborn by way of a warm-blooded host. Reborn pregnant, it immediately seeks to impregnate another warm-blooded host with its spawn, thereby insuring the proliferation of the Alien species. Very clever writing, dramatic and carefully controlled performances, some excellent effects, and amazing camera work combine to make this a sure sci-fi/horror classic. We knew it would be, as soon as we saw it.It rates an 9/10 from...the Fiend :.",9,2,4,22 January 2005
Sweeney Todd: The Demon Barber of Fleet Street," Tragically Beautiful...Visceral.
","Tim Burton's 'Sweeney Todd The Demon Barber of Fleet Street' encourages its viewers to lick their lips at the prospect of this work as the ideal treat, and perhaps we should. In the remaking of this story, going half way will bring nothing to the work; nothing to the world, and Burton seems to realize this, as he goes nowhere if not all the way. He not only walks up to the theoretical bell, but he rings it, unabashedly.Hailed as the bloodiest musical in the history of the stage, it now becomes the bloodiest adaptation of a musical to film in history, and it isn't a joyful gambol. This is a dark telling of deeds driven by heartbreak, filled with a desperate chaos and (pardon the awful and probably often-used pun) bloody good meat pies. But fans of the work know all this from the start, and we feel endeared that Burton keeps the story close to the source; a fact which, for those hapless members of the viewing audience who have no prior exposure to this twisted historical story, promises no happy ending for our characters.In all actuality, the audience receives a much better ending than a mere banal happiness could convey; no cavorting romps through fields of wildflowers for them! It receives the only ending possible because Burton does not attempt to rewrite history in his telling. Contributing along this twisted Memory Lane are beautiful darkling performances by Johnny Depp, Helena Bonham Carter, Ed Sanders, and Alan Rickman, with the demented silhouettes of Dariusz Wolski's cinematography, and a diabolical (and slick) production style by Dante Ferretti. Each of these lovely elements comes together to allow Burton to conjure the visceral essence of a 19th century London reflected so aptly by Henry Mayhew's 'Labour and the London Poor,' a serious influence over famous Dickensian works, which assumed the sad and often disgusting job of reporting on London's more seedy 'Cheep Side.'The heart-beat of the story itself is so strong as to lend a palpable pulse to this work. The (anti-)heroes are forged of the heartbreak of life itself; its villains are made villainous by life itself, and they all waltz to the Death March played wistfully on the flute of that same life, which has forged their very beings. The acting is so poignant that it enrolls us as subscribers to this diabolical tale. And even as we gasp and cover our mouths in shock, there is the hint of a sardonic smile at the corner of our mouths, as the dark humor does not escape its target.Burton lovingly creates this musical with a near lover's touch, with vocal performances which are intimately offered, softly whispered, lovingly delivered. These darkly delicious Sondheims are filled with despair paired with a desperate longing for a world untouched by the evils of man. They are plot-driven and carry the story, rather than interrupting it.In reality, this film works as pseudo-history. It is not meant that we should take it as fact, but that it delivers the story without resorting to tongue-in-cheek camp. This is a completely beautiful balance; delicate and even fragrant, and Burton never fails to stop to point out its beauty in an incongruous way. This is a tragedy, in which Johnny Depp delivers a near-Biblical performance. The surprise is that instead of taking Helena Bonham Carter with him, she walks along beside him on her own tragic, but capable path.All in all? I loved this work. It is darkly wonderful, and our two stars never missed a mark. This is suitable for watching on Friday/Saturday nights, but NOT by an audience any younger than 18 without fear of mandatory life-long therapy. But I love it.It rates a 9.8/10 from...the Fiend :.",10,1,2,16 April 2008
Blades of Glory," Neuvo-Classic Comedy
","I have to say this was a complete surprise. I liked Will Farrell on SNL, but his movie attempts have fallen short due to his blustery baby-man style. He just didn't seem to mesh with anyone, until Anchorman. That was our first indication that he could do something better, and still remain within the comfortable confines of his realm.Bewitched, besides being a folded comedy with which I could not find total satisfaction, was entertaining, but mainly so due to Michael Caine and Nicole Kidman, but Farrell certainly can NOT take the credit for contributing much at all to that film, other than work and screen-time.Blades of Glory is the second. It is a story about redemption overlaying a strong comedic premise, which works on screen as well as it did on paper. Two hostile rival Olympic single skaters join forces to compete as a figure-skating duet. Both are men. And they hate one another.I had little hopes of the execution of this work, having been a somewhat disappointed Farrell fan for years, however, this work far surpassed my expectations (or lack thereof). Farrell hasn't found someone with which his quirky, blustery style meshes 100%, but it works well enough to be funny, instead of making you cringe and groan.I enjoyed this due to Heder's more toned-down pouty comedic style utilized herein. If only Farrell would turn to more intelligent comedy. His fans KNOW he has it in him, and it would be a great improvement. But this was still fun, and more importantly, it was highly entertaining and brings a moral, whether you look or not.All in all, this is one of the best Farrell movies out there, to date.It rates a 7.6/10 from...the Fiend :.",8,0,0,2 May 2007
Lost in Translation," This Is A Character Study, NOT A Comedy. Boy, Did SOMEONE Mess Up!
","I found the marketing completely off the mark for this work. This was billed as a comedy, but this is NOT a comedy. It is more a character study than anything else, and as such, I cannot say it was even well made, despite my understanding of the marketing problems, which occurred.Murray is way off his game here. They say he tried something new and did well at it. I say, regardless of his trying something new, he stunk UP the place, and should have been pulled from this project. I LIKE Murray, but his dialed-in performance did nothing to further endear, and did a lot in the way of putting me off him.There ARE a few elements which make this worth watching. Owen Wilson is great, and comes off more like the Bill Murray that Murray fans grew to love and have become disgruntled with in the past decade or so. Scarlett Johanssen was another element which made this viewable. She is a delight as a neglected newlywed who forms a weird bond with an egocentric aging actor (well, at least the typecasting worked for Murray). Anna Farris is also present, but you only see her for a few moments.All in all? I can not for the LIFE of me understand how this won an Oscar! I was bored, bored, bored. The performances were stilted, the dialog delivery was halting and unconnected, and the overall feeling of the film itself was like something out of the late 1970's, but perhaps that last item was the catalyst int hat Baby Boomers bought into it. I am not sure what happened to boost the overall appreciation for this crap, but I cannot say I enjoyed anything about it beyond Scarlett Johanssen and Owen Wilson, and then only marginally, as neither the script, nor the execution, was anything to crow about.It rates a 2.8/10 from...the Fiend :.",3,1,8,13 May 2007
Tangled," Mediocre
","I liked this work more than I did Disney's previous princess movie The Princess and the Frog, but only just. Tangled does not have what it takes to be an 'instant classic,' nor does it have enough quality content to become an eventual one. There are too many pop culture references, herein. It breaks the spell woven by the medieval setting and trappings, and leaves its viewer feeling unsettled and (if they are an older Disney fan) rather melancholy for the older pre-computerized hand-drawn animations like Snow White and Bambi. Ah, the details in THOSE films! But not in this one. Now I'm no elitist. I love Cars, and Finding Nemo, so I am not anti-CG. I am anti-lazy artists who pay no attention to detail, backgrounds, props, and settings. I am anti-lazy animators who really believe that four lines make a face, six lines make a horse, and shading and shadows are unnecessary evils.It was unremarkable, but not bad. It was mediocre for its lack of anything resembling heart.It rates a 5.7/10 from...the Fiend :.",6,3,12,26 December 2010
Star Wars: Episode II - Attack of the Clones," Better? Not Quite, But Still Enjoyable.
","Episode II is rated by other critics as superior to Episode I, but frankly I feel it is rather over-rated, as this is not quite the masterpiece for which I had hoped, upon reading those reviews. They've touted it as, '...a return to the old formula...' for which the Star Wars Money Machine is known. That seems rather ignorant to me, as this is the second prequel installment, so of course more familiar elements will be demonstrated here than were in the first, as there will be even more in Episode III. That is a given. For them to proclaim that this is somehow superior to the Introduction that was Episode I because of those more familiar elements, is just asinine. Episode I, as an introduction, was perfectly presented. This work, however, was more focused on Luca$'s obsession with teen love and an homagic tribute to his 'America Graffiti,' than any attempt at the actual meat of the Star Wars Saga.While there was lots of action and some brilliant effects, this chapter of the Star Wars saga ran more like your typical teenage angst-filled romance, than what I would expect from the Luca$ Star Wars money machine.Episode II is a literal sea of cameos by other well-known to fairly-known actors. Everyone wanted in on these movies - Check out Marton Csokas as Geonosian Archduke Poggle the Lesser (uncredited). You may remember him from Lord of the Rings trilogy as Celeborn !! .As most of you now know, the star is Hayden Christensen as Anakin Skywalker. Now, I've nothing against the lad, but Hayden Christensen?! The Star Wars money machine is a far cry from playing the Paper Boy in John Carpenter's 'In the Mouth of Madness,' and it shows. He plays the part unprofessionally. I was not impressed with this young man's talents in the least. His portrayal is stiff, as though he's been taped to a long pole which has been run up his back. He delivers his dialog as though he were reading cue cards while merely parroting the words.Anakin is full of the usual teenage angst; rebellion, outbursts of pious whining, given to fits of sulky anger and more whining. But his execution of this performance never quite rings the bell. He appears angry, but doesn't quite demonstrate it. He appears full of pain, but is not quite convincing. The story helps to convince, but Christensen falls short each and every time. Scene by scene, his actions are designed to demonstrate his leaning towards the dark side, but he's too normal a teen aged boy for this tool to be the least bit effective. He does not demonstrate the appropriate darkness necessary for him to pull it off the role of a would-be Vader. His unimpressive performance makes it completely unbelievable that he will ever BE Darth Vader. He's too...'average.' Some critics have declared that his murder of the entire village of sand people who captured and subsequently killed his mother, to be a sure indication that he is headed down the wrong path, but I daresay that were that any of OUR mothers, we might have behaved in much the same way without ever being classified at the level of evil one expects from he who will be Darth Vader. I guess this is just another one of those'wait and see' judgments I will have to make after the release of Episode III.Don't get me wrong; you get a great movie. This work is filled with exhilarating battles, good story development (as long as you don't think about it), great visual effects, and otherwise stellar performances. It's just replete with plot holes, Christensen stinking up the screen, and devotes more time to Padmé and Anakin than it does the saga, itself.Featured within are several great battles, including a rousing battle between Yoda and Dooku. It was rather endearing watching Yoda jump around in that battle like a little spider monkey on crack. It looked impossible that he didn't cut himself clean in half. I kept expecting to see his two, separate pieces fall individually; green blood spraying the Count.The story which takes a back seat, but is evident, surrounds the Clone Wars. A long-deceased Jedi Master has ordered an enormous clone army to be constructed on behalf of the Republic. The 'cloners' have secured the DNA of the very capable bounty hunter Jango Fett and have used his DNA to build the army. You later get to see Yoda take command of this army, though in a small way, to rescue the captured Jedi Knights and Masters from the clutches of evil.There is also a large sweeping epic story line which is somehow lost in what becomes nothing more than a trumped-up teen love story. For some reason, Luca$ seems unable to stay on the main plot, and keeps going back to Padmé and Anakin. We all know they both violated their vows and positions. We all know they are Luke and Leia's biological parents. We didn't need for half the screen time to go to their angst-filled teenage love story. This single factor, excluding all the questions and plot holes and/or continuity problems, weighed this movie down so far from The Phantom Menace, that I can scarcely work up any enthusiasm for Episode III. What enthusiasm I do have is surrounding the possibility of Luca$ actually filling in some of these gaping holes, seeing Wookies in battle, and uplifting the prequel trilogy back up to the level where we, as Star Wars fans, need it to be.I suppose something like a 7/10 is fair, but that will change after we see how well it introduces and sets up the story contained in Episode III, just as Episode III's rating will be determined with how well it was allowed to tie into Episode IV, so hopes are not high.the Fiend :.",7,0,1,18 March 2007
Corpse Bride," Probably My Favorite 2005 Film
","In rewatching this it feels like this may be the inspiration for the Twilight series, in some small way, but in a larger way, it bears a strong Victorian Romeo & Julietesque feeling that contradicts its own story, yet contributes to it at the same time. Depp and Bonham-Carter make for a lovely duo in spite of the origins and alignments of their characters, proving once again that Tim Burton knows what he's doing.This is one brave film maker. He exhibits no fear in conquering an ages-old story, a well-loved franchise, or in introducing something never seen before. He is fearless and uniquely creative, and everything (so far) with his name on it has been creatively different in its execution, with or without a slick production style, including this, the Corpse Bride. I LOVE it, and it has found its way into my collection.It plays much like a prequel to A Nightmare Before Christmas, although it is not. I love watching them back to back, as they play VERY well together.It rates an 8.4/10 from...the Fiend :.",8,0,1,22 February 2009
Gone Baby Gone," Solid and Compelling Twisty Thriller
","A surprise in the direction (Ben Affleck), and an equal surprise in the lead. My first introduction to Casey Affleck was in Drowning Mona featuring Bette Midler and William Fitchner, Neve Campbell, and Danny DeVito. His performance was less than impressive, but he did catch my attention. This is the first honest shot I have given his talents, and I must say I was completely surprised. Casey Affleck is simply stunning in this role, co-written and directed by his brother, and upheld by a fabulous supporting cast.Although this is based on Dennis Lehane's novel, this runs in the beginning like it could have been inspired rather by Caylee Anthony's disappearance, but the story quickly turns around and takes control of itself as its own work. This is really amazing, and is highly underrated, in my opinion.One thing is for sure, I'll not dismiss Casey Affleck's work ever again. That's for sure. This is fabulous.It rates an 8.4/10 from...the Fiend :.",8,1,2,3 February 2009
10 Things I Hate About You," OH, the best laid plans of mice and men
","This is another teenager movie demonstrating the depths to which boys will go in order to get what they want. At least on the surface, that's what this movie is about. What it is, beneath the surface, is a grand, bittersweet love story with some great execution and a fine story line.The performances were not typical of these types of movies, leading you into a superior teen love story experience. This was really quite sweet, beneath the intrigue and horseplay on the surface. I found it fun and touching, in spite of the teenager factor.It rates a 6.8/10 from...the Fiend :.",7,0,0,18 March 2007
Predator," Neo-classic creature feature
","While there is very little science in this science fiction/action/horror flick, it is one of the better monster/alien movies out there. As a neo-classic, it is a classic out of the 'classic' period, which generates the same kind of loyalty as does a 'true' classic.Riveting portrayals, realistic enactments within the most suspenseful setting I've ever experienced, and cast perfectly, this is one for the collection, regardless of your tastes.This movie relies heavily on the unknown. It leads you down a jungle-dark path into oblivion. It shoves you, step by step, into the awaiting maw of the enemy and only slowly begins to let you see what you are up against. Excellent direction which makes you live the experience of being hunted, marks and colors this production in such a way as to endear it to the audiences for all time. It keeps you glued to the screen until the final sequences play themselves through.I rate it a rousing 9/10.the Fiend :.",9,4,6,4 September 2004
Watchmen," Beautiful. Art-House Comic Book Gets Beautiful Cinematic Treatment.
","I was hesitant. The comic book is GENIUS. The movie will not be because the director and writers will either rewrite the thing to get it onto the screen, or be SO faithful as to render it moot, on screen. The sheer genius of the comic book makes it difficult, certainly, but to remain too faithful to the written word is typically the death knell to any visual work...except when the written word is a graphic novel (and/or comic book), it would seem.The film is genius, but (as others have pointed out) it's the genius of the comic book this movie holds and NOT directorial genius. As closely as this follows the graphic serial, it must have been pretty easy to alter the direction of the narrative, watch the ques, and insert visuals as dictated by the source materials, which were kept there on the set and used like a Watchman 'Bible,' according to news sources.The angles, the colors, lighting, all contribute as much to the overall work as the performances and film quality, but this is exactly what the comics set as axiom wherein these elements are concerned. There are no surprises as to the cinematic adaptation. The surprise would have been a creative attempt at an actual adaptation. This is (not merely, mind you) the graphic novels translated to film, rather than an actual adaptation. That all having been said, this is fantastic both fundamentally and in final execution! It is visceral, graphic, soulful, and visually stunning. But more importantly, it is beautiful, intellectual, and above all, human. Oh yes, it's the overall humanity of the work that renders it a must see, must experience, must HAVE film of the year.This is amazing, and my expectations were already running pretty high. That's saying something.On a parental note, however, this film features full male frontal nudity. It is done artistically and is a necessary and beautiful element of the film, but I thought there will be MANY parents out there who will not be expecting it.It rates a solid 8.9/10 from...the Fiend :.",9,18,36,10 March 2009
The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring," A Masterpiece!
","I wasn't going to review this movie. There are hundreds of reviews on it and I frankly wasn't going to waste my time repeating the same words of praise.When I first learned that they were doing these movies, I thought, 'Great! Another series of movies I'll hate, modeled after a trilogy of books that I love.' Stephen King's work, being a prime example. I love the literary works, and the movies all just die on the screen; be it big or little. Then I learned that Peter Jackson was directing it and I was even less eager to see the movies. I never liked the Frighteners and Meet the Feebles?! Wow, did that movie stink UP the place!And then I discovered they had no plans of making the prequel; 'The Hobbit,' and that was that. I wasn't going to like the movie, and I refused to be excited about it. Any of it. But then, I was GIVEN tickets as an early Yule present and so I begrudgingly attended its premier here in the Smokies. I was very pleasantly surprised. I ended up seeing this movie twice in the theaters, and have since bought the extended edition gift set of this work.The opening sequence was so well done, that I couldn't find any reason at all to not accept it. They didn't do 'The Hobbit,' true enough, but they filled in that time and gave the viewers enough of the beginning that I could thoroughly subscribe to the movie.Many critics have literally bashed Peter Jackson's omission of one of the characters in Frodo's party, but the character was hardly relevant to the plot, the storyline, or the story itself and was best left out. I didn't even miss old Tom 'what'shisname,' to tell you the truth.I do have a problem with Aragorn's character's emotionality in the movie. His character in the book was a seasoned Ranger. His emotional instability; ie: his crying openly scene after scene, is completely out of character. It lends to the storyline with Arwen, and furthers the movie along, true enough, and personally, I didn't mind it. It was just out of character. He's rough, he's tough; a seasoned ranger. He shouldn't have been as emotionally portrayed as Jackson did him, although the reasons are clearly due to time constraints. It would have taken forever to develop Aragorn properly, and they frankly did not have enough time, even with the three-plus hours of screen time.BUT, Jackson's characters were very well developed, the story was very well told. There was a LOT of dialog, but there was a lot of detail that would've been left out; many, many finer details that never would've been able to be expressed without the richness of dialogue and Jackson and his company saw that, thankfully.All in all, as a Tolkien fan from WAY back, I feel that Peter Jackson did a marvelous job with this, the opening edition of the Lord of the Rings trilogy. It rates so far above, 'The Godfather' trilogy (to which it has been compared), that there IS no comparison.The acting is exemplary. There is no stiffness, no badly delivered lines, no hesitation in performance. Sean Astin truly and greatly surprised me with his brilliant performance as SamWise. The scenery and cinematography is brilliant. The sets and scenes are so well done, I only spied a single flaw...and I was looking! There was a car in the background of one shot! But the car will be missing from the DVD release, I'm sure.The wardrobing and costumes were finely hand-made; treated to look worn and imperfect, as they should and the Shire was so well done, I was as delighted as any child on Yule morning. But the thing which captured me the most and held me spellbound was the casting. They put just the right people into just the right roles. I simply loved the characters.. Each and every one of them felt just like the book (except for the deviation I already mentioned about Aragorn's emotional state).First we had 'The Godfather,' then we were given the 'Star Wars' trilogy and now, we have the Lord of the Rings to love. I look forward with great anticipation to the rest of this series.Thank you, Peter Jackson, for giving of yourself to this extent. It is above and beyond all for which I could have hoped. This first installment rates a full 10/10 from...the Fiend :.",10,6,8,8 September 2003
Cast Away," Unintentional comedy
","This was one of those epic dramas that goes so far over the top, it ends up folding in on itself.We were supposed to be engrossed with his trials and tribulations, feeling empathy for his plight, but all we could do was laugh. Every thing which went awry just made it all the more amusing. And at the climax, when he's on the raft, and Wilson goes floating away and he cries out with all his heart, 'WIIIIIIILLLL-SOOOOOONN!' we nearly got kicked out of the theater. (A first, I assure you.)It utterly failed to generate any sympathy for this poor guy whatsoever. The ratings here at IMDb are above average, and the box office take was generous, but I, for one, was entertained and amused, however not in the way they intended.I've seen this afterwards, and while it was not AS funny, it was still funny. It surely was not dramatic or epic, or much of anything else. It's just a mediocre little movie that took itself WAY too seroiusly.It rates a 3.2/10 for unintentional comedic effect, from...the Fiend :.",3,7,19,17 January 2005
Lilo & Stitch," Lovable
","This is a masterpiece of graphics, textures and plots. Very very nice. I've grown up with Disney, as have most of us. And I've seen many of the Masterpiece collection, first hand on the big screen. I am also a fan of Disney's non-Christian views and presentations of the world. They make you use that imagination, whether you want to, or not. They have a way of making a person face the harsh realities of life, and realize that life will go on; regardless. They transport you, if only for a few moments, into another world, another place and/or another time. Not many movies really do that for you, but for me, Disney animations do. The good ones, that is.I've yet to see a sequel of a Disney movie that was worth a penny of my money or a moment of my time. But in all fairness, I have yet to see Cinderella 2 and Lion King 2.The graphics in this instant classic are absolutely beautiful, as are the textures and color blends. As someone who does computer graphics for my own site, I am truly in awe of the Disney animators who did Lilo and Stitch and dozens of other Disney animations. I have one question though. Where the heck were they when the sequel was being made? Stitch is beautifully expressive both in animation and in voice. That's something you totally lose in the sequel. Lilo's face is also expressively drawn and animated, something else totally obliterated in the sequel.Also, I was very pleased that there were no 'Disney originals' in the soundtrack. This soundtrack was dead ON for the movie. Thankfully, they didn't use the 'Beach Boys.' Wow! What a difference THAT would've made! (and for the worse, I do believe.)This movie is wonderful entertainment, and instills a feeling of family, even when that family is self-made; self-'adopted' people you just find and take into your life. Wonderful message.Wonderful movie.It gets a 9.98/10 from...the Fiend:.",10,2,3,5 September 2003
Pitch Black," I Was Surprised
","Let's face it. David Twohy has written some good screen plays, and he has also put out some real stinkers. I didn't know quite what to expect with this work, but what I didn't expect was this gritty, fresh science fiction work. I don't know that this will make 'cult classic' status, but in my opinion, it should.The characters, while vile-mouthed, are enigmatic; the story, which has been classified by some as a rip off to 'Alien,' has been done before, and done well, but that didn't detract from my enjoyment of this work. The aliens themselves more closely resembled those of Starship Troopers than Alien, but I believe those other critics were indicating the plot, rather than the creature effects themselves.All in all? It delivers. I found it highly enjoyable, and quite frankly, it caught me by surprise.It rates a 7.4/10 from...the Fiend :.",7,3,4,21 March 2007
Terminator 3: Rise of the Machines," I wanted to love this movie!!
","I waited in pure excitement to see this movie.I was a fool.Where is James Cameron?! He KNEW what to do with this movie!I was about the most disappointed creature on the planet when I left the theater after seeing this.Comparison. I OWN Killer Klowns from Outer Space. I do NOT own T3.Nuff said? No?It is the epitome of puerile. It is under-dramatized, the script is nothing more than cliché after cliché and the focus of the actor seems to be somewhere in the distance, rather than on the situations to which they are supposed to be subjected.The 'Terminatrix' was a cool idea, and she pulled it off with a bit of panache and talent. But the effects and function of the T-1000 (Played excellently by Robert Patrick in T2-Judgment Day), were far superior, as was the story line and the direction of the cast.It's amazing to me to sit in a theater after shelling out a load of money to see a star-studded cast walking around seemingly without any sense of purpose or direction.It was a sorry, slip-shod excuse for a sequel to the first two movies, which were excellently done and extremely well made, well written and directed by a Master; James Cameron.On the lighter side; however, the rumor going around the web concerning Mr. Schwarzenegger's having paid out of his own pocket to film the crane scene is a nice thought. I wonder if it's true? Does anyone know?And, I am looking forward with (only a small degree now of...) hope for the future run of War of the Machines movies which are now made possible by the storyline.I can only hope someone comes to their senses and brings back James Cameron to do them. And maybe they won't start the War of the Machines without Schwarzenegger.Let's all hope. Shall we?It rates a 3.2/10 from...the Fiend :.",3,1,2,13 August 2003
The Shining," Kubrick's Masterpiece of Horror Lives On!
","*!!- SPOILERS - !!*Before I begin this, let me say that I have had both the advantages of seeing this movie on the big screen and of having seen the 'Authorized Version' of this movie, remade by Stephen King, himself, in 1997.Both advantages made me appreciate this version of 'The Shining,' all the more.Also, let me say that I've read Mr. King's book, 'The Shining' on many occasions over the years, and while I love the book and am a huge fan of his work, Stanley Kubrick's retelling of this story is far more compelling ... and SCARY.Kubrick really knows how to convey the terror of the psyche straight to film.  In the direction of the movie AND the writing of the screenplay, itself, he acquired the title 'Magus' beyond question. Kubrick's genius is like magic.  The movie world lost a great director when he died in 1999.  Among his other outstanding credits are:  Eyes Wide Shut, 1999;  Full Metal Jacket, 1987; Barry Lyndon, 1975; A Clockwork Orange, 1971; 2001: A Space Odyssey, 1968; Spartacus, 1960 and many more.The Torrences (Jack, Wendy his wife and Danny, their son) are living in the Overlook Hotel for the winter; Jack has been hired as the caretaker.  It is his job to oversee the upkeep of the hotel during the several months of hard snow, until spring when the Overlook reopens its doors.  It seems there are many wealthy and jaded tourists who will flock to the Colorado Mountains for a snow-filled summer getaway.The Hotel was an impressive piece of architecture and staging.  It lent to the atmosphere, by having a dark, yet at the same time 'welcoming' atmosphere, itself.  The furnishings and furniture was all period (late 70's - early 80's), and the filmography of the landscape approaching the hotel in the opening scene is brilliant. It not only lets you enjoy the approach to the Overlook,  it also fixes in your mind how deserted and isolated the Hotel is from the rest of the world.The introduction of Wendy and Danny's characters was a stroke of genius.  You get the whole story of their past, Danny's 'imaginary friend,' Tony, and the story of Jack's alcoholism all rolled into this nice, neat introductory scene.  There was no need in stretching the past history out over two hours of the movie; obviously, Kubrick saw that from the beginning.Closing Day.  Again, the scenic drive up the mountains to the Hotel (this time, with family in tow), the interaction between Jack and Danny was hilarious while also portraying a very disturbing exchange.The initial tour through the Overlook is quite breathtaking, even as the 'staff' is moving things out, you get a chance to see the majestic fire places, the high cathedral ceilings and expensive furnishings, dormants and crown moldings in the architecture. 'They did a good job!  Pink and gold are my favorite colors.' (Wendy Torrence)  Even the 'staff wing' is well designed and beautifully built.The maze was a magnificent touch, reminiscent of the Labyrinth in which the Minotaur of Crete was Guardian.  When Jack Nicholson stands at the scaled model of the maze and stares into the center, seeing Wendy and Danny entering, it's a magickal moment; one that tells you right away, there are heavy energies in that house; there's something seriously wrong, already starting.  'I wouldn't want to go in there unless I had at least an hour to find my way out.' (The Hotel Manager)Scatman Cruthers, as Dick Halloran, was genuine and open in his performance.  His smiles were natural and his performance was wonderful.  You could actually believe you were there in the hotel, taking the tour of the kitchen with Wendy and 'Doc.'  His explanation of 'the shining' to Danny was very well delivered, as was his conversation with the child about Tony and the Hotel.  It was believable and sincere.The cut out and pan scan of the hotel itself, with the mountains looming behind, the cold air swirling about, mist coming up from the warm roof of the snowbound hotel, adds so MUCH to the atmosphere of the movie.  It also marks the 'half-way-to-hell' point, so to speak; the turning point in the movie.Shelley Duvall's portrayal of Wendy Torrence was masterful.  (So WHAT if she also played Olive Oyl?!  It just shows her marvelous diversity!)  Honestly, before I saw the movie on the big screen in 1980, I said,' What?  Olive Oyl?  *lol*  (Popeye was also released in 1980.)  But I took that back as soon as the movie started.  She's brilliant.   In this Fiend's opinion, this is her best performance, to date!  (Although I did love her in Steve Martin's 'Roxanne,' 1987.)Once Kubrick has established the pearly bits of information of which you, the viewer, need to be in possession:  the Torrence's past; Danny's broken arm; Tony;  the history of the Hotel itself; the fact that Danny is not 'mental,' but rather clairvoyant instead, and the general layout of the Hotel; all of which you get in the opening 3 sequences; the movie never stops scaring you.The two butchered daughters of the previous caretaker, Delbert Grady (the girls having appeared several times to Danny, first by way of Tony in the apartment before the family ever left for the hotel) were icons with which Danny could identify, and of which he was afraid, at the same time.  They were haunting (and haunted), themselves and showed Danny how and where they were killed, in a rather graphic and material way.Kubrick's Tony was written as an attendant spirit, like a spirit guide which he acquired as a result of his arm nearly being wrenched off his body by his own father.  He was...'the little boy who lives in my mouth.'  He would manifest in the end of Danny's finger and physically spoke through Danny in order to speak TO Danny.  NOT like in the book, I realize, where Tony was intended by Stephen King to be the projection of Danny as an older boy, trying to save his father.  Kubrick left out that little twist and it somehow made it more frightening when Tony 'took ... Danny ... over.'  The idea of Danny's older self projecting back to his younger self isn't...scary.The 'Woman in the Shower' scene, done by Lia Beldan (about whom I can find no other credits for having done anything before, or since) as the younger woman and Billie Gibson (who ALSO appears to suffer from a lack of credits for works before or since), was seductively obnoxious and thoroughly disgusting.  It was dramatic, and frightening.  Abhorrent and scary.  When Nicholson looks into the mirror and sees her decomposing flesh beneath his hands; the look of sheer terror on his face was so complete and REAL.Jack quickly embarks on his trek from  the 'jonesing' alcoholic to a certifiable insane person.  The degradation of his character's mental state is carefully and thoroughly documented by Kubrick. Jack's instant friendship with Lloyd the Bartender (as only alcoholics, would-be mental patients and drug addicts do) portrays his pressing NEED of the atmosphere to which Lloyd avails him; namely, alcohol ...'hair of the dog that bit me.' (Jack Torrence)  In Jack's case, it's bourbon on the rocks, at no charge to Jack.  'Orders from the house.'  (Lloyd the Bartender)  Nice play on words.When Wendy find's Jack's 'screenplay' is nothing more than page after page of the same line typed over and over, albeit in 8 or 9 different creative styles...when he asks from the shadows, 'How do you like it?' and Wendy whirls and screams with the baseball bat in her hand...is so poignant.  It's the point where she realizes how messed up the whole situation is...how messed up Jack is. It's very scary, dramatic and delivers a strong presence.  That coupled with Danny's visions of the hotel lobby filling with blood, imposed over the scene between Jack and Wendy, and with the confrontational ending to this scene, make this possibly THE strongest scene of the movie.The 'REDRUM' scene.  Wow.  What do I say?  What mother would not be totally freaked by awakening to find their young, troubled son standing over them with a huge knife, talking in that freaky little voice, exclaiming 'REDRUM' over and over?  Even if it HAD no meaning, it would still be as scary as the 7th level of HELL.  It was something everyone could (and has) remember(ed).  Speaking of memorable scenes...Nicholson's final assault on his family with an axe was perhaps one of the scariest scenes of movie history.  His ad-libbed line, 'Heeeeere's Johnny!' was a stroke of brilliance and is one of the most memorable scenes in the history of horror.  It also goes down in horror movie history.The ending..?  Kubrick's ending was perfection.  I felt it ended beautifully.  No smarm, no platitudinous whining, no tearfully idiotic ending for THIS movie.  Just epitomized perfection.  That's all I'll say on the subject of the ending.Who cares what was taken out?!  Look what Kubrick put IN.  Rent it, watch it, BUY IT.  It's a classic in the horror genre, and for good reason.  IT RAWKS!!*Me being Me* ... Take this movie, and sitck it in your Stephen King collection, and take the 1997 'Authorized' version done by King and stick it down in the kiddie section.  That's where it belongs. .: This movie rates a 9.98 from the Fiend :.",10,36,64,21 August 2003
Terminator 2: Judgment Day," Largely superior sequel
","By far, James Cameron's best work!! And the best of the Terminator Series.The first Terminator movie was made for 6.4M. This one got a 100M treatment, and brother, does it show! This is by far the best sequel in the history of sequels. This movie so far surpassed the original that it left it in the dirt.I am writing this post-T3, and I can safely say that this installment of the Terminator franchise is by far the best.The story was every bit as original as the first, without ever once coming off as a rip off. The effects were awesomely executed; you will not believe how much better this movie is than the first.This one has the same element of action and suspense and continues the story without making it seem old, tired, or recycled.I highly recommend the 2-disk Director's Cut.Don't rent it. Just go buy it.It rates an 8.9/10 from...the Fiend :.",9,1,2,7 January 2004
Van Helsing," VanHelsing; a Universal pleaser
","VanHelsing is a lovely, dark, atmospheric, action-packed, well written, brilliantly conceived, effects-tacular homage to Universal's classic Monsters of the 30's and the 40's.Now, this was definitely NOT high art, that's for sure. And it strayed from what I had expected, considering it was Universal. You would expect the characters to be based on the older Universal monsters; or at least...I did. The one thing which made me like this work so much was the treatment of the vampyres in flight. That was magnificent. I was so excited to see that on the big screen ... and I liked the treatment of Frankenstein's monster. He was much more like Shelly wrote him than Universal's first reincarnation of him. He was insightful, intelligent, and quoting Paradise Lost. He was brilliantly done. Popcorn flicks are seriously underrated, though. I love the big effects and the big, epic feeling of those blockbuster-y KABOOM pics. I'm an Eye Candy whore, yes, but that's not all I look for. I thought there WAS a nice story here. It was really rather sweet. Dracula wanted his children to live. Okay, yes, he also wanted to use them to dominate the world and destroy (or enslave) mankind, but other than that, it was quite sentimental. I was a bit disappointed, however, that we were not given the Gabriel/Abraham back-story. That is aggravating. Gabriel is called the 'right hand of God' in the movie. Does that mean that Gabriel VanHelsing is somehow the archangel Gabriel? I dunno. It left a lot of questions for me. The homagic sequences at the beginning, those filmed in an almost film noir style in the opening, did let me know right there at the door of this thing, that Sommers had tampered with the Universal formula. But even with the changes to the feel and the base story lines, I found this endeavor highly enjoyable. They cannot explain it away by saying that THIS Frankenstein's monster was another one, and not the first, because they have Frankenstein there, screaming, 'It's alive!' and not something else like, 'It's alive, again!' or 'GO ME!' Dracula clearly was not there in the original Universal installments to which this was supposed to be a continuation. However, as was pointed out by My mate, Dracula could have been there in the originals, but 'dimly present,' or downright invisible. He IS a master Vampyre, after all. But in this version, he was neither dim, invisible, nor absent. So...that leads us back to the beginning. Sommers tampered with the formula very deeply; I feel that's why this work struck such an errant note with most viewers. It just didn't feel quite right to the purists. But for me, Van Helsing was a very different experience from that.From time to time, there comes along a cinematic work which fills you with a sense of wonder and awe. For me, Van Helsing was the first one since the LotR trilogy to touch that place in my mind's eye. For open-minded fans of the old Universal classics, the use of black and white at the beginning gave a feeling of connection with the movie from the onset. Familiar characters, familiar settings, familiar stories; all with a fresh, new spin while maintaining the old familiarities. The audience is treated to the best eye candy while making the attempt to maintain the integrity of the classics. You get to see vampyres in flight, the caring (and loving) conceptual makeup of Frankenstein's Monster, and a delightfully fresh treatment of VanHelsing combined with stellar performances, painstaking direction, and brilliant post-production work make this one of my new absolute favorites. The werewolves were quite good. Of course, this work was also a Universal production, so they were able to use the Wolf Man words, 'Even a man who is good at heart and says his prayers by night...' We were in the theater and my love said to me (quietly of course), 'They can't use that!' 'Ah, but they can,' I answered. 'This is Universal, too.' 'No wonder it's so good,' was my love's only response.I really enjoyed the dialog. It was cleverly witty and delightfully fresh. As was the take on the whole enterprise. It was beautiful and dark, yet full of hope. I thoroughly enjoyed this attempt and hope they are amply successful with this work to warrant a sequel.On a final note: while I thoroughly enjoyed the theatrical DVD release ('making of' featurette, director's commentary and tons of extras for a theatrical version), I strongly suggest you get the Ultimate Edition available at amazon.com.It rates just beneath Underworld at a 9.4/10 from...the Fiend :.",9,12,23,9 January 2005
Spider-Man," Deserving but inferior blockbuster
","I have to say for a mainstream blockbuster this was really quite good.I usually try to avoid mainstream successes, but as a fan of Spiderman since early childhood, I simply had to go see this production. I figured that I would end up dogging it, but in fact, I found it to be a very effective adaptation of Stan Lee's work.The main (and only real) problem with this movie was the treatment of the villain, the Green Goblin. The make up effects, costume, and CGI were not what I call good. (For a perfect example of CGI at its best, check out the water-horses Arwen calls to save Frodo in 'Lord of the Rings: Fellowship of the Ring.') The action sequences of this work are really rather muddled and messy. The CGI is obvious and was not the effects work of art 2 Oscar nominations (one for best special effects) would indicate.Other than the arch-villain's being this campy old piece of crap (about as bad, but not quite, as the Scorpion King in 'Mummy Returns'), the rest of the movie was very good.But does that element alone ruin the feature? In some unimportant way, yes, as by far, it did not live up to its potential. But in the major way, no. The performances were realistic, believable, and solid; the story was faithful to the original comic book line first written by Stan Lee; and the sets and props were all meticulously detailed and crafted. All in all, still a very good production. The action elements were well placed (if somewhat sloppy), the comedic factors were delivered properly and timed perfectly, and the dramatic methodologies were carefully directed and enacted.The plot of this story was creatively written, and executed with a fondness, inspired by a thorough character development indicative of a director who loves this comic book legend.It rates an 8.0/10 from...the Fiend :.",8,0,1,28 October 2003
Dark City," Wonderfully 'dark' sci-fi/horror.
","While this was based on Metropolis, this attempt is ~much~ more entertaining. This is also probably Jennifer Connely's best attempts to date (this is being written after the Hulk and House of Sand and Fog, by the way), and William Hurt's most interesting role.This story is a beautiful, mysterious, darkling tale of deceit, intrigue, and murder. Even after the secrets are discovered, the whole story is not told until the very end. This movie is an ultimate ride on the mind twister train. Just sit back, and remember to employ your thinking cap as you enjoy the ride. I will not spoil this movie, as many others have. I will let my rating of this movie speak for itself. If you are a fan of dark tales, science-fiction, or psychological horror/thrillers, this is a definite must-see. It highlights stellar performances by Keifer Sutherland, William Hurt, Jennifer Connely, and Rufus Sewell (Lord Adamar from A Knight's Tale).I highly recommend the Platinum Series Collection edition which includes the Widescreen and Fullscreen versions, commentaries by film critic Roger Ebert, another by the Director, writers, DoP and production designer, the Find Shell Beach interactive Game, Cast and crew biographies, filmographies and Star Highlights, Comparisons to Fritz Lang's Metropolis, Theatrical Trailer, Set Designs and fully animated menus. I enjoy this version of the DVD immensely.It rates a 9.7/10 from...the Fiend :.",10,0,2,7 January 2004
Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban," Beautifully dark, but with holes
","This work is beautifully dark and lovingly done, but it does leave gaping holes in J. K. Rowling's magical world. The close relationship between Harry and Dumbledore is obliterated, as is Hermione's almost conspiratorial relationship with McGonagal. You are never told who Moony, Wormtail, Padfoot, and Prongs are (a necessary element). They completely avoid the fact that Snape has knowledge of Harry's Invisibility Cloak, and Harry received the Firebolt at the beginning of this work rather than the end. The whole incident at the Shrieking Shack was changed and lost too much in the translation. Crookshanks was calumniated from a beloved kneazle to a noisome feline who'd be more likely to pee in your shoes than help you, aside of course from his determination to eat Scabbers.Columbus's epic style is notably missing, as is the awe-inspiring score, and the magical feeling inspired by the first two. Hagrid's hut was reinvisioned (more a gripe with Columbus for not having read ahead and determining what was needed to begin with, than a grip with this movie), there is a pumpkin patch which wasn't there last year, and Hogwarts grounds seemed to have sprouted mountains and rocky hills which weren't previously there. And Dumbledore no longer bears the traits of a beloved, serenely all-knowing Headmaster who commands respect from all (the ONLY Wizard of whom He-Who-Must-Not-Be-Named is afraid), he is now a lesser man who barely commands notice much less great respect. It aggravated me that Columbus never felt it necessary to research his resource materials by reading ahead in order to make a solid determination as to where things were and how they were laid out. Negligance is never a desirable trait among any professional trade, and this single act of laziness could have cost the franchise dearly. Indeed, this attempt took a beating on DVD sales due to the lack of contentment with the finished product over the changes. Lapses in sales like this could adversely affect the studio's decision to make further films!However. Cuarón's style is superior in his use of light and color, and the lack of these elements. He is not afraid to approach the darkness of this work, and shows it as he rivals the power of the script, rifling through each line and page for ways to illuminate the scene through means other than mere lighting. Much has been said concerning the 'darker' script, etc. While this work IS darker, so was the literary work from which this was adapted. Even with all the changes (some of them barely noticeable and some of them contemptible) this attempt is the first Harry Potter film which, in my opinion, captured the true spirit and feeling of the novel which it attempts to document.I, for one, am happy to see Chris Columbus move from the director's chair to that of producer. I've wondered though, why he was not Executive Producer of this work, as he was the previous two and the upcoming GOF? Ah well. I must have missed something. His sweeping epic style is beautiful but his works never achieved the level of awe, mystery, and joy present in the first two novels. This third attempt, as I've said, succeeded in capturing all the necessary elements.Hagrid's hut is beautifully done and the audience has a much better feel for the grounds of Hogwarts due to Cuarón's talents. As much as I detested the fact that things had to be changed, I am very satisfied with how things looked and felt on the grounds. It felt much more magical, even with a lack of epic filming (of which I am a huge fan). Cuarón handled the maturing of our three protagonists quite well in that he had just finished a near-porn and, indeed, a nod is given to that work in this movie. If you've seen them both, then you know what I mean. Hermione's Emma Watson is maturing well so far, as are our other favorite Hogwarts students. They do not appear to be maturing so quickly as to warrant their replacement in this series; a situation about which much speculation has been made.This work was incredible in that the characters, creatures, and effects were all impeccably conceived and executed. The legendary hippogryph was incredibly realistic. Some critics have charged J. K. Rowling with making up these animals by 'taking one half of one animal and just sticking it onto another.' This is laughable, as the hippogryph is a mystical animal of legend, and not a Rowling creation. According to legend, the hippogryph, living far beyond the seas in the Rhiphaean Mountains, is the result of the rare breeding of a male gryphon and a filly. It has the head, wings and front legs of a gryphon, and the back and hind legs of a horse. It is a large powerful creature that can move through the air more swiftly than lightning. It figured in several of the legends of Charlemagne as a mount for some of the knights. And since many types of gryphons exist, including a variation involving an eagle head and forepaws, this rendition of this legendary creature is really quite realistic. I do wish people would research before criticizing.While this movie is far from Oscar-worthy, it is quite entertaining and does its best to follow the main theme of the literary work. While I was a bit put off by the changes, I must acquiesce that Cuarón did a most excellent job in adapting the largest and longest Harry Potter literary alteration so far with the lowest running time of any Harry Potter film yet. Thus far, this is my favorite for film style and maintaining the appropriate atmosphere in accordance with the novel, though I do hope Gambon can pull off the rigors of the next two attempts. A lot will ride on his ability to BE Dumbledore.It rates an 8.4/10 from...the Fiend :.",8,14,20,25 January 2005
Ratatouille," Fun Mediocrity
","This is not a home run in the Pixar/Disney Hall of Fame, but it IS enjoyable.RATATOULLE lacks soul, heart, and frivolities, which normally draw children and adults alike by the droves. This film is a romantic sort, as are most Disney animated features, with the Comedy factor omitted from the formula this time, and the movie suffers for it.It was only moderately interesting and somehow managed to be quaint without endearing itself to its target audience. Some adults will particularly like this due to the adult themes and elements, but the age group who are out there attempting to make it on their own like the lead character in this work, will not be attracted to this venue.This sad fact is negated; however, by the fact that this film did only marginally less at the box office, than the widely loved (and vastly superior) Cars. It is further negated by the fact that RATATOULLE receives a user rating here at IMDb.com, which surpasses Cars by laps. Deservedly so, in my opinion. RATATOULLE is a wonderful film, but it lacked the magic of the rest of its line.All in all? I sincerely hope this does not turn out to be the beginning of a trend into decline. It is fun at times, and interesting at times, but not ever both at the same time. You take your chances with this one.It rates a 6.3/10 from...the Fiend :.",6,4,9,27 September 2007
Aliens," Even better. Different, but better
","(This is concerning Aliens: Alien 2, Special Edition version from the Alien Quadrilogy Collector Set)Some 57 years later, Ripley is discovered on a deep salvage expedition. She is in stasis, but is alive, rescued, and brought back to Earth to face an inquiry as to what happened to her $42.5M M-class freighter and cargo, her crew, and her mission.James Cameron was one brave soul to attempt a follow up to Scott's horror classic. There were so many ways he could have screwed this up, and been loathed by literally millions of fans. It's been said that it's easy to take someone else's good idea and improve upon it, but were that the case, there would be loads of superior sequels out there, and very few of the quality we actually do have.What Cameron's done with Scott's vision is to expand upon it in such a way that the original is surpassed in almost every way. Understanding all too well that action is his best venue (Escape from New York, Rambo 2, The Terminator, etc), he chose in sheer wisdom, to stick with his forte rather than attempt to copy Scott's. Very shrewd of Mr. Cameron. So while the first chapter of the Alien saga is very much a science-fiction/horror, this second installment is just as much a science-fiction/action which expounds on Scott's story and ideas in such a way as to render this attempt superior to its forbearer. A rarity in cinematic attempts.The story is rich in detail and depth. Written by Cameron, it flows rather fluidly from the end of Alien, right on into the Aliens plot line with only a small seam (Ripley's inquest and subsequent time on Earth) interrupting the two separate pages of encounter. Once the action begins, it is not non-stop, but it is fluent in its execution. The non-action sequences are rich in character development and deepening the base story and sub-plots.The camaraderie of the military characters was beautifully realistic, giving us a sense of knowing them, caring about what happens to them, and having empathy for their plight. The ~only~ element in the entire endeavor I had any problem with whatsoever was the addition of the character Rebecca 'Newt' Jorden, brilliantly portrayed by Carrie Henn. While she was a delight, and a very capable actress at this age, she also felt like a token; a wild card character through which they hoped to endear a younger audience. But with an 'R' rating, that ploy did not necessarily fulfill their goal, and had the adverse effect of making some parents wonder how anyone could allow a child of that age to take part in a movie so gruesome. This is, after all, the stuff of nightmares. I, however, was not one of those people. I loved Newt and found her presence in this work necessary and desirable. Henn was nothing but professional in her portrayal, giving us an open and honest portrayal of real terror.This chapter of the Alien story gives you more Aliens, more gore, more action, more characters, more story, and more enjoyment. It is the best of the Quad, and that's saying a lot.It rates a 9.2/10 from...the Fiend :.",9,1,3,22 January 2005
The Exorcist," It scared me then, it scares me now.
","I was much too young to read this William Blatty novel. At the ripe old age of nine, I found it lying around and read it. I had to hide it. I instinctively knew that if my mom had found me with it, she would have been quite disturbed. But I had read more advanced works already, and understood most of what I read. What I did not understand, the dictionary was readily available to assist me in my quest.I didn't sleep for about ten days. I would go to sleep, but I would not stay there long. I finally had to confess my trespass to my mother, who countered the book's nightmare-like qualities with a 'good, healthy dose of Disney.' I honestly understood Joel, Wednesday, and Pugsly's horror in 'Addams Family Values' at receiving the same treatment. Somehow, my dreams went from Exorcist-like nightmares, to beloved Disney characters doing horrible, unthinkable things to me, and one another.But I digress.This is still one of the scariest movies I've ever seen. I recently purchased the Director's Cut on DVD and THIS is the movie I remember from the book...if that makes sense. The movie, until they re-added the lost footage, was NOT as scary as the book. This version very much IS.This movie also shows you where Dee Snyder got the idea for the name of his character in his movie 'Strangeland,' another very disturbing, if not scary, movie. Captain Howdy is the name of the entity with which Reagan speaks through the Ouija board. The Ouija board is the device which opened her to the possession in the first place, by the way.Very good movie; strong, solid performances by professional actors; excellent effects; and a story line which is unsurpassed in the genre of horror.Excellent work.It rates a 9.2/10 from...the Fiend :.",9,4,7,29 October 2003
Enchanted," Ever So Silly, But Sweet Overall
","The opening animation is shaky, at best. This is devoid of Disney Magick AND Disney talent. But once it goes live action, the Disney charm shines through, and holds you throughout.Medieval-Victorian Fairy Tale meets Aquarian-Age New York. I must admit, I was a bit turned off by this premise. Every Rom-Com endeavors to weave the Fairy Tale in a modern-day setting. Some succeed, but most fall flat. Enchanted does not attempt to weave a Fairy Tale, it IS a Fairy Tale, and a darned sweet and entertaining one, at that.All in all? This is definitely a Friday/Saturday night movie for the family, children worried about a 'wicked' stepmother, or dating couples, though probably not one for 'the guys.' I cannot say there is something here for everyone, because frankly, if you have a cynical eye for romance, this work will probably cause you to long for some Visine.It rates an 8.4/10 from...the Fiend :.",8,1,4,4 December 2007
Resident Evil," Resident Evil: A Project in Terror.
","To be honest, the first time I saw this, I didn't care for it. It did not follow the story line of the game, and that made me very unhappy with this endeavor.Upon realization that a video game is 'dumbed down' for the players to be able to concentrate, however, I opted for a second viewing and came to realize that this was not the waste of time I first believed. I was disappointed with how it played out because there were no cures along the way, they made little notice of records and files lying about, no matter how relevant they were or were not, and the sequence of things was not on par with that of the game. I realize that to do things that way would have severely hampered the flow of the movie itself and would have made it far less active. Considering this is first and foremost, an action movie (with horror elements), that would not be considered a good thing.The truth is that Milla Jovovich contributes a very capable and entertaining presence and performance to this work. Her supporting cast (every one) gave nothing but the best they had. The story itself flows quite well and was creatively written and executed. There is nothing wrong with this attempt. It just didn't live up to a fanboy's expectations. Unfortunately, that was their major principal audience; game fans, and that explains the lackluster box office payoff and the low IMDb user ratings for this attempt. The fanboys were disappointed; the casual fans casually attended this event; and the mainstream didn't understand the big deal, either way and so did not participate to a profitable level.With the release of the second installment and all the advertisement and hype Apocalypse received, it drew the mainstream fans a bit harder; the casual fans were less casual; and the fanboys were still disappointed, but resigned to the fact that this was just how it was going to be; take it or leave it. We took it and, in retrospect, embraced the first attempt, as well.It rates an 8.4/10 from...the Fiend :.",8,32,52,13 January 2005
Independence Day," Amazing Patriotic Popcorn Fare...
","Yes, the story has contradictions. Yes, the plot has holes. Yes, Will Smith is about the most over-rated actor on the planet. But this is still a terrific movie!I'm not about going with the mainstream on anything. Chances are, if it's loved in the mainstream, I avoid it like the plague. I've never seen 'Forest Gump,' because of that. I grew up near the Alabama Bayou town where part of that movie was filmed (Coden is one block from Bayou La Batre, AL), and I never felt the need or desire to see that movie. The more I heard how good it was, the less I wanted to see it, until I had built up a pretty good aversion to it which still persists, today. Same goes for Apollo 13. Never saw it. Never wanted to. I was alive back then, and remember the moon walk. I don't need a movie about it, to remind me how fantastic and awe-inspiring it was. It was like touching the face of a god.My point is, regardless of the plot holes, the obvious 'War of the Worlds' similarities, and the grandstanding done by both Smith and Goldblum, I found this movie to be highly entertaining. It's not the most intelligent production out there, but its entertainment value alone makes it well worth the time it takes to view it.Goldblum and Smith both ponied up professional (if at times hammy) performances in this production, and I thoroughly enjoyed this movie. I watch it often, in fact. Also, I am highly patriotic. I'm proud to be an American. My family has fought (and died) for America's rights and causes, and in America's wars, throughout history since they immigrated here from Scotland and Germany in the (very) early 1800's, and I am proud of my heritage as an American. This movie inspired me, uplifted me, and made me feel a stronger sense of pride for feeling the way that I do.Bash this movie if you will. Bash Americans and American ideals. For those of us who love our country and are proud of the rights and freedoms for which our families have lived and died, your words mean absolutely nothing.This movie rates a 9.0/10 from...the Fiend :.",9,3,8,27 October 2003
The Butterfly Effect," Donnie Darko Effect.
","This movie succeeds where the underdog Donnie Darko didn't hit at the box office like it should have. Although it does pretty much steal the base premise of DD, it seems to be much better received.Unfortunate, IMO. Donne Darko was a beautiful attempt with great style and an excellent dialog. The Butterfly Effect is a fully CGI-treated rendition of the same base story with pretty much the same outcome. I don't understand its success where DD is so vastly under-rated, but such is the way of things in Hollywood, I would imagine. The Butterfly Effect is an 'A' production while Donnie Darko was a 'B.' That just goes to show you that money and effects mean more than a really good movie.If you enjoy this on any level, do yourself a favor and check out the ~real~ movie which started this entire line including the 'Left Behind' series. The performances are much more realistic in DD, and the photography and effects, while not as well done, meant more to me, for the obvious budget differences. DD had to try harder, for lack of funding, if that makes sense to you. While the Butterfly Effect was quite good (very enjoyable), Donnie Darko was the first movie (of late) to do this.All the same, it rates a 7.2/10 from...the Fiend :.",7,7,19,12 January 2005
Alien vs. Predator," I had issues...but most of them were resolved with the UNRATED EDITION's release.
","I went into the theater with little in the way of expectations. I love both franchises and I frankly did not believe they could do this one properly.The performances were quite good, the effects were great (although they did something weird to the mandibles on the Predators that I found to be a poor incarnative device), and the sets and story were quite well done.The story. That's what blows you away in AvP.SPOILERS.This movie was rich in story without going back and explaining all the redundant boring trivial little details from both franchises. It depends on your subscribing to the theories of each franchise and is more a 'carrying on' endeavor than a 'win new viewers' one. I found that to be endearing in these days of repetition. Considering that this was an extension of two successful franchise components, why compound the repetition factor. The premise of ice after having said the Predators only come when it is unseasonably hot left me feeling a bit disturbed as to why they chose Antarctica. However. Given the theories concerning the shifting of the poles, the Ice Age theorems, and so on, I have accepted that the pyramid was built when what is now the North Pole/Antarctica, was in the deserts of what was the Old World's 'middle east.'I was disturbed that the Predators were less...predatory, and more 'touchy-feely' this time around. I seriously missed the action! Action! ACTION! of these franchises. So if it is action you are after, this movie is -not- the first choice. There were practically no hand-to-hand episodes, and what you did get was a bit weak probably due to the PG-13 component. Bah! Hopefully there will be an American 'R' release in the next year or so. I think I'll hold off on buying the 'theatrical release' when it comes out and wait a bit to see. I can't imagine there weren't more fight scenes shot and then extracted as a marketing ploy for later use. By 'touchy-feely,' I mean the love/team interest forged between Sanaa Lathan's character Alexa Woods and the surviving underground Predator. That was completely out of character for the Predators, in my opinion. Okay, I realize it is a carry-over from Predator 2 where the Predators acquire a respect for Danny Glover's character in the end. However, to quote 'Howard the Duck' ... 'This relationship defies all the laws of Nature!' Though it's hardly a romance, there are far too many cutesy moments in this endeavor to suit my Predator/Alien tastes. In fact, this feature alone lent a feeling of 'this is stupid' to this whole movie; a thought I had to keep pushing back during my theatrical viewing and detracted immensely from the final product.The premise, however, was quite well done, in spite of the obvious flaws. In Bishop's endeavor to live what is left of his extended 'life' to the fullest, he embarks upon this journey in the hopes of surviving one last grand adventure. Not a new element to the cinematic world, but still effective. I -wanted- him to go, and I -wanted- him to succeed. Perhaps, that is only because he was the only character from the original franchise to make this attempt. This attempt bore no other original members from either franchise, by the way.The idea of the pyramid bearing the three types of ancient civilizational writings, thoughts and designs was outstanding.Quite clever interpretation of the placement of the great pyramids on the Earth, and the origins of the Gods of mankind. Perhaps it was a Predator bomb that caused the Tunguska blast of 1908. The effects were well done, and the makeup artists surrendered their best, as expected. As I said before, the mandible adjustments on the Predator were a bit off-putting, but then again, they were never beautiful creatures to begin with. The pyramid was well done, the glyphs were realistic, the adornments were creatively and historically presented, and the aliens were expertly done.Just another small question...In all the years the Predators have been fighting the Aliens, -why- is their armor not acid-proofed?Just a thought.In an attempt to make this more attractive to 'arthouse' fans rather than fans of the original franchises, the story line was given more screen time than the action one would expect from a movie which carries these two franchises. Even with this distraction AVP was very watchable. The Unrated Director's Cut (which Anderson promised fans from the beginning, IF you will remember), is as the movie should have been. You are given eight more minutes. Now, I can already hear the cries of malcontent. 'Eight MINUTES?!' But I can tell you that 8 seconds added here, and 5 seconds added there, really do serve well to flesh out the story, give you the details previously missed, and extend the Alien/Predator fight adequately enough so that fans are, at last, appeased. The story is in the UNRATED EDITION. The action is in the UNRATED EDITION. The version which makes sense is the UNRATED EDITION. The PG-13 edition is the chopped up, convoluted crap-fest we saw at the theaters. Thanks to the studio for letting Anderson have this UNRATED EDITION. It goes a long way towards salvaging what we KNEW was NOT an inferior film. The PG-13 version just made it seem inferior. The Theatrical Version rates a 7.0/10.The UNRATED EDITION rates a 9.2/10 from...the Fiend :.",9,2,4,31 August 2004
Batman Begins," What Batman Was Supposed To Be!
","Quite possibly the movie of the year, but I have yet to see War of the Worlds. I went into this thinking, 'They've DONE the whole Batman thing. Why put us through it AGAIN?! The first Burton/Keaton Batman was da bomb. 'Returns' was decent, 'Forever' was entertaining but sadly lacking. Seriously, with a cast like Drew Barrymore, Jim Carrey, Tommy Lee Jones, Nicole Kidman, Val Kilmer, and Kevin Grevioux (Raze of Underworld fame), how could Schumacher screw that up? Well, he found a way, and with the release of 'Batman & Robin,' it became painfully obvious that the end of Batman was more than just 'in sight,' it was here. I grieved the death of what could have been a terrific franchise, and I moved on. Then along comes Goyer. He wrote 'Blade: Trinity,' and while I am NO fan of that movie, we'll blame the studio's cut and Parker Posey's horrible acting...for now. I will give him the benefit of the doubt because he has also written some great screenplays and stories. Blade, Blade 2, and Dark City are all his, but his writing abilities seem to be more hit-and-miss than substantially consistent talent. Christopher Nolan directs and kicks in his two cents' worth in the screenplay department... I'm not impressed with his body of work. I liked Insomnia, but let's face it: Nothing I'd seen so far said to me that Batman Begins would even be watchable, much less entertaining. To be honest, I didn't even WANT to like this movie for several reasons... * Michael Keaton did so well with Batman * Schumacher was so total in his obliteration of the franchise, I could not see any reason to beat the dead horse * A fan of the 'Dark Knight' I was tired of being disappointed at the cinema by the direction in which the franchise had goneI must say that I'm very glad I saw this in the theater (on the 'big screen'). Just think; I almost missed witnessing a true rebirth of this franchise! The casting was work of art in itself. Some unlikely choices really REALLY pay off. Two character actors were cast against type, but it seems to have been a brilliant choice! Also, Bale was excellent in his performance. His performance was so reminiscent of Michael Keaton's that you can not help but believe that his entire performance was an homage. It didn't come off leaving you feeling like he was attempting to 'copy' his performance, but rather it further cements in your mind that Keaton IS Batman, and Bale knows it. The effects were dynamic, and the sets and backgrounds were more than realistic. The stunts seemed to be more wire work than CGI (thankfully), lending a more believable and realistic feel to this endeavor. And gone (again, thankfully) are the hideous nipples from the Bat-Suit! (Curses Joel Schumacher for ever adding them in !!)The thing which most impressed me about this film was the story. It was fantastic! I've read reviews by the 'professional' reviewers, and one in particular claimed that the movie got lost in the beginning to find itself again only at the end. I'm learning NOT to listen to the 'professional' reviewers and to judge for myself. I have to say that by going through the changes in the beginning, you fully understand the motivations and abilities demonstrated by the Dark Knight. Because quite frankly, this isn't just Batman anymore. If the new franchise follows this first installment, it will literally BE the Dark Knight vein of the comic book series! THIS is the Batman I grew up with, not the campy, weak-@ss byotch who cracks off one-liners while feebly dealing justice to ineptly stupid criminal miscreants. Adam West was 'A' Batman. Michael Keaton was 'THE' Batman. Bale is the Dark Knight; it's a totally different animal. The nemeses in this one are Ra's Al Ghul and the Scarecrow, with a promise of meeting the Dark Knight's 'Joker' in the next installment!This movie exhibits perfect direction from start to finish, never loses itself, never loses the audience, and with great relish fights its way through to a superb and satisfying ending. I can't WAIT for the next one! It gets an 8.7/10 and yes, that's a big leap from the rating I gave Burton's Batman cuz let's face it: Bale isn't a better Batman, but the movie itself is LIGHTYEARS better!... from ... the Fiend :.",9,3,5,24 February 2006
Liar Liar," One of Carrey's best!
","The premise is simple. A heartbroken and often disappointed 5 year old boy makes a birth day wish that his father, a prominent and up-and-coming civil attorney, cannot lie for just one day.In this vehicle, through obvious wish magick, the wish is granted.In pique form of Jim Carrey's classic Dick Van Dyke-meets-Jerry Lewis style, the results of his son's wish wreaks total havoc on his life, and on the lives of those around him.With an all-star cast, fine direction, and expert screen writers, this production is top notch, classic Jim Carrey fare. IMHO, this is his best performance yet.There is not one millimeter of wasted film to this work. Every moment is either vital in the building of a principal character, or filled with side-splitting laughter.I highly recommend this movie to anyone who wants, enjoys or needs, a truly genuine belly laugh.It rates an 8.4/10 from...the Fiend :.",8,6,8,21 October 2003
The Princess Bride," One of the best.
","This is one of the Fiend's favorite movies. It has all the elements of a great fantasy, love story, action/comedy and rolls them all together with care, love, and talent.This was my introduction to Cary Elwess, and the shining star in Andre the Giant's life. I had occasion to meet Andre after his making of this film and before his death, and he literally carried a copy of this movie with him every where he went. This movie, to him, was more worthy of pride than his entire life's career as a pro-wrestler. Billy Crystal, who also starred in this production, became his closest friend, and later dedicated 'My Giant,' to his pal Andre.Just a little history from a buff.This movie contains swash-buckling action and sword play, strong-man elements, pirates, princesses, castles, revenge, and true love. For what more, could you ask.An all-star cast gives us all star performances. If you are a fan of fantasy, this is a definite must-see.It rates a 9.1/10 from...the Fiend :.",9,2,3,27 October 2003
The Lost World: Jurassic Park," Almost as good as the original!
","While this movie was not quite the same brilliant combination of effects, cast, characters and magic Spielberg delivered in the first production, I still found this sequel just as enjoyable as the first.The cast members are just as professional, and while they did not have the same original cast (a mistake most sequels make), Dr. Ian Malcolm (Jeff Goldblum) does return. That was fine by me. He as my favorite character from the first movie, anyway. Joined byJulianne Moore as Dr. Sarah Harding and Vanessa Lee Chester who brilliantly portrayed Malcolm's daughter, Kelly, they attempt to recreate the magic of 'Jurassic Park.'While they did not quite succeed in accomplishing the totality of the first, they did present the world with an excellent finished product which I found extremely fun to watch and highly entertaining.Plot: John Hammond is at it again, but this time, he is on the side of the environmentalist. InGen has been taken out of his control and he must stop his nephew from exploiting the dinosaurs kept as breeding stock for a possible second attempt at Jurassic Park's opening.Hammond already has a team on the island to observe and ensure that his nephew does not interfere with the island's inhabitants; ie: the dinosaurs created by Hammond and the InGen team of genetic scientists. During the course of his conversation with Dr. Malcolm, whose reputation is now ruined because of the controversy behind his tales of the disastrous trek to Isla Nebular, Hammond discloses that the new team is not on Isla Nebular, but on a secret island developed as 'Site B,' called Isla Sorna which is 87 miles south of the original site.Naturally, Malcolm refuses to go (who wouldn't!) and is on his way out when Hammond reveals that Malcolm's girlfriend, Dr. Sarah Harding, is already on the island as part of the research team.'This is no longer a research mission. It's a rescue mission, and it's leaving right NOW!' Dr. Ian Malcolm.The dinosaurs were done just as wonderfully in this fine sequel, as in the original; the dialogue was just as witty and clever; the characters were just as believable and well developed; and you honestly did not have to be witness to the first movie to fully enjoy this one. The only things that were lacking, for me, were (1) the wonderful cinematography; those excellent landscapes which were prevalent in the first. This one felt more deliberate; less spontaneous, than its predecessor. That was due to (2) one badly-developed, poorly portrayed character, and unfortunately, he was one of the leading characters in the script. Arliss Howard as Peter Ludlow, John Hammond's egocentric nephew. I am unsure as to whether his acting quality was trite and stiff, or his character was written that way, but whatever it was, it did disrupt the quality of the movie, in my opinion. These two things combined, lowers my opinion of the movie, but only in comparison to the original, and only a little bit.This is still a very good sequel which stands alone without depending on the first plot to carry it.It earns an 8.6/10 from...the Fiend :.",9,6,11,30 September 2003
Cars," Pixar Is Pure Magick! Who Would Have Believed It? 7 Smashes In A Row!
","This movie is pure enchantment. It features amazing animation, a good old-fashioned story, endearing characters, and a bit of American nostalgia for NASCAR, without alienating those who aren't into the race car scene. Baby Boomers, especially, will love this, but so will the general audience members.The most impressive aspects of this film are the stunning vistas, the perfectly synchronized mouth/lip movements with the voices, and the innovative substitutional elements in the world of Cars. I won't spoil anything, like so many others, so I won't detail any of these individual elements.This film is actually one of my favorite Pixar animations. They just keep getting better and better, sporting wholesome family fun everyone can enjoy.

The Little Mermaid," One of Disney's Best
","I understand why some do not like this work. It tends to be a bit preachy, and is completely about love. Therefore, even some Disney fans will turn their nose up at this one. In all honesty, I prefer Atlantis to this one, but that does not mean this was not a superior film.The story is a love story. Oh, there is adventure, betrayal, bravery, dancing, songs, high sea action, and some pivotal father/daughter moments, but all these elements come together to create one fine love story in pure Disney Romantic Comedy Adventure fashion.This film is probably one of the sweetest love stories in the Disney vaults, and a must have in any Disney collection.It rates an 8.4/10 from...the Fiend :.",8,3,4,23 March 2007
Ghost Rider," Perfect Capture of Characters
","I'm a comic book fan. Ghost Rider is one which many collectors and readers found obscure in comparison to many, but it was always one of my personal favorites.As such, I expected an effects-extravaganza, a good performance from Cage, and a barely palatable story line. You know...the usual.Well, I'm happy to say that I got more than I bargained for with Ghost Rider. The effects were beautiful-lovingly done, and the performances by all involved were exemplary...that was no surprise; with a cast like Sam Elliott and Nicolas Cage, I would never expect anything less. But the STORY. THAT was what caught me by surprise.You know, a comic book series-any comic book series-is constructed of a chronologically progressive story. Sure, there are prequels and spin-offs, flash-backs, flash-forwards, and even a few that flash sideways, but the base story line goes from beginning to end. Therefore, it has been difficult for many screenwriters, studio executives, directors, and producers to commit comic book lines to film. A few have done it successfully. Batman Begins, X-Men the Franchise, and Spiderman are about the best, in my opinion. I had serious issues with the new 'Super-'man, but that's for another review.In Ghost Rider, the story doesn't attempt to do too much, and thereby, does not contain the huge holes, missing chronological chunks, base characters, and/or supporting cast members. This story is about Johnny Blaze, what he was, and what he becomes.It is also a beautiful homage to the idea of 'Passing on the Torch,' in its inclusion of the Sam Elliott character.This movie was probably THE best comic book movie I've ever seen. It wasn't the flashiest. It didn't have the most KABOOM effects. It didn't give you the most kills, or the best splatter. This movie was a story-driven, graphically supported vehicle, which superbly entertains.Beyond that, however, is the fact that the writers here have epitomized Ghost Rider's principal characters; Blackheart and Blaze. This demonstrates more than the embodiment of the heart and fire of these characters-it captured their essence.My one gripe? Okay, I thought that Elliott should have ridden into the town with Cage. Okay, I said it.I absolutely loved this movie, and cannot WAIT for another.It rates an 8.9/10 from...the Fiend :.",9,4,6,7 March 2007
X-Men: The Last Stand," Bottom Line? This Isn't Fantastic, But Neither Is It Terrible.
","THIS REVIEW IS FULL OF SPOILERS!With a $210MUS budget compared to $110MUS for the 2nd and $75MUS for the first, I don't know why I expected more substance. The money obviously went for the effects, but I would not go so far as to say (as have many reviewers of this work) that the action overshadowed the characters. To an extent, that is true, but only to an extent.The action was great, and the character development was nonexistent, but in all fairness, the characters (for the most part) were previously developed, which precluded a need for extensive work in that area. What DID upset the Fiend was the long, laborious, and desperate contractual wrangling performed by Hale Berry. She saw to it that the entire movie was aimed at her character, was paid a ridiculous sum, and held out for a better script which would allow herself more screen time. The result? A lackluster performance dialed in by Berry, Xavier is killed to afford her screen time, and the more interesting characters were left on the sidelines.The action did not override the characters. Berry's contract did.The new X-Men looked wonderful, but the failure to give character exposition did little in the way of fostering love with the audience members. Angel was beautiful and, while he was only touched upon, that was more treatment than the other new additions received.Frankly, the casting of Kelsey Grammar made me stop and say, WHAT? But my misgivings were apparently unfounded, as he managed to wrangle a great performance from behind a cold, calculating, shroud of ineptitude woven by the would-be director. Beast shone through, and no amount of sidebar inadequacies could shake him from it. The makeup artistry did not hurt, either. He was huge. He was hairy. He was blue. He was irascible. He had a human heart. He WAS Beast! NICE JOB, Kelsey! I won't underestimate you next time. NOTE TO Bryan Singer: I hate that you did not continue to finish this series of works. You are an unfaithful lover, who has broken trust with your fans. Will you bail on the Superman franchise when the next 'new' franchise is introduced? Will you disappoint your fans like this AGAIN? Once a lover strays, they continue to do so until they are bitten. Unfortunately for them, by the time they realize the meaning of faith, no one else will trust them. It might serve you well to learn that now, rather than after it is too late.The Phoenix storyline I had greatly anticipated, was left to the comic books. This work was more geared to the Dark Phoenix saga, which meant a fast forwarding into a whole new X-Men sub-genre. I said it was 'geared to' the Dark Phoenix saga, because it certainly was not THE Dark Phoenix saga. There were no aliens, there was no Apocalypto to bring us the 'cure,' which wasn't a cure but a poison. There was only Jean Grey, and her inability to control the more dangerous aspects of her gift, and no storyline concerning the Phoenix Herself. None whatsoever. That, in itself, is enough to make fans of the comic book series (You know, those little books upon which this was supposed to be based? Those comic books?) detest the film.There WERE deaths. Or were there? We never saw Scott's body, and the 'bonus scene' shown at the back end of the ending credits clearly gave us Xavier's voice emanating from the mouth of the man who was born without a consciousness. The 'cure' turns out to be more of a 'fix' (disregarding the debate concerning whether mutants need to be cured or not), and is not as permanent as we were led to believe, as Magneto's powers appeared in the final scene to be returning; however minutely.That final scene, along with the bonus scene, indicates to me that there are, indeed, plans to go on with this franchise. If not, this entire movie was a waste of film, leading to nowhere. If so, they have broken my trust in their original claim to make the trilogy, and then stop. For this to be the 'final chapter' of the X-Men saga, it neither felt finished, nor WAS finished. It is completely open-ended. This was NOT the way to finish off a popular franchise.Oh, and just in case you were wondering? There was STILL no sign of Gambit.That brings us to the last. Is this movie entertaining? In spite of everything, I have to admit that I WAS entertained. While this work lacked any and all shreds of substance we came to expect from the X-Men franchise, it was still ... fun. I highly enjoyed the BlockBuster-y KABOOM factor of this work. But directors like Ratner need to learn that you can't replace style and substance with noise and effects, and expect serious fans to love it.It rates a 6.7/10 from...the Fiend :.",7,0,1,31 May 2006
Hellboy," Not as slick as they had hoped
","While this movie was more popcorn and cheese than I would have liked, Hellboy still presents us with some endearing character portrayals, outstanding effects, solid story line and good direction.The premise is ... that after having conjured a demonic imp-like being, the Nazis are disturbed and their small faction defeated by the US. The paranormal adviser who is aboard the US mission lures the lil guy to his side with Baby Ruth candy bars, and he therefore adopts him as his 'son' of sorts.Once grown, the imp - who is now on the side of good having been raised sixty years by a good-hearted and wise human - fights evil in all its forms.The imp is enamored with a firestarter who is also in the group, out of the group, back in the group, and so on. Good thing that the big red guy's flame retardant, or he could be singing the Doors from the other side. 'C'mon baby light my fire.' *chuckles* The meridian/merman was beautifully done, portrayed and executed. Great incarnation of a highly intelligent and sensitive race.The one-liners and zingers flying about were more likely to put an eye out than make anyone laugh. In that area, this movie tried too hard to be witty and just came off seeming a bit anorexic. Unfortunate, as this could have been much more enjoyable, had they pulled it off. However, all that taken into account, I was still amused and entertained by the premise and the actual story. Some critics have accused this attempt of having no story whatsoever, but that just is not the case.The story is of love, life, blind faith, imagination and intelligence, and ultimately loyalty both to family and friends. Even when delivered through a basely stereo-typical chauvinistic tough-guy personnae, these qualities do not fail to shine through.The action sequences were fun, with a strong accent on those one-liners. Nevertheless, they were still entertaining. Importantly, the effects were excellent and did manage to carry the movie through a couple of tough spots. A good thing, too, as I never even noticed the score.All in all, it still rates a 6.4/10 from...the Fiend :.",6,6,11,14 August 2004
The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers," A Masterpiece!
","The epic saga continues, picking up right where the first left off, complete with hand sewn banners hung throughout the Golden Hall of Rohan, hand-fashioned armor and elves!These works are perhaps the best I have ever seen. In the genre of fantasy, this series is seriously in danger of having replaced Star Wars as my all-time favorite movies.The direction was of the very best quality. The sets, designs, props and backdrops were realistic and without flaw.I highly recommend the extended edition, released in November 2003.The scenes fully restored to their original glory before having some of the detail and story line left on the cutting room floor, this production is as 'epic' as they come; far larger than life. A task this formidable requires dedication, staying focused - both on the task at hand and in the creativity department.Neither were lacking here. I honestly found not one moment of wasted film, not one single element which should have been edited out or omitted, not one performance which was lacking in any way.While there WERE adaptations made to Tolkien's original literary work, I stand behind the creative decisions made, allowing that there were contractual obligations to be met, and fully and thoroughly enjoyed this darkling fantasy-filled adventure.This work, with its story set at the edge of the fall of Man, was dark and twisted, yet leaving us with hope for Mankind's future. I thought Jackson's work to be frightfully clever and wholly engrossing.This movie (especially the extended version) is absolutely wonderful; a true credit to the whole industry. Too bad for us that Hollywood is not as bold.As did the Fellowship of the Ring, the Two Towers rates a full 10/10 from...the Fiend :.",10,1,1,23 December 2003
The Incredibles," Great Family Film
","Okay, by now, it's unanimous that Pixar's 'The Incredibles' is a great family film. So why add another review? It's not because I think I'll say anything that a plethora of other reviewers hasn't already said, but because I feel the ~need~ to say that this is a great family film.Too many movies barely pass for family films these days. They oftentimes contain elements and themes to which we do not wish to have our children exposed. They even, more often than not, contain messages or morals with which we do not agree and find awkward or inappropriate to explain to our children. They even promote lifestyle choices, hereditary and/or cultural differences, or unfortunate wardrobe malfunctions and still pass for family films.This is not one of those movies. The Incredibles is wholesome, witty, and clever, while appealing to all ages. You can't say that about many movies, especially today.All in all? This is a great movie, anytime you want a movie you don't mind your grandparents or young children watching. Plus, it's fun and does not fail to entertain.It rates a 9.2/10 from...the Fiend :.",9,3,4,27 April 2008
The Mist," Astounding.
","When King hits a home run, he knocks that ball outta da PARK! And that's what he's done with The Mist. Frank Darabont really knows his stuff, and after this work, I can't help but wonder if George Luca$ and Spielberg are regretting their earlier decisions regarding Darabont's script for IJ4? But, that not withstanding, this is one compelling piece of film. It teaches many lessons, should the movie-goer care to hear; lessons like: Don't cling to dogmatic prattlings out of desperation, Don't allow your government to conduct experiments that we, the people, are not aware of (it's OUR MONEY!), Don't go through life believing that friends are failed enemies, and Don't give up without a fight...we will endure if only we demonstrate positive resolve. This film demonstrates just what happens when we possess a firm dose of negative resolve. EEE GADS! All in all? This was dark, and wonderful. It runs a bit like Storm of the Century and Maximum Overdrive in the scenario, but does NOT end like either. This ending is fantastic. It shows us what Stephen King adaptations SHOULD be...and CAN be, with the right director and dramaturgist. This is suitable for Friday/Saturday night viewing, but NOT for the kiddies! OY Vey! It rates an easy 8.7/10 from...the Fiend :.",9,2,6,12 December 2007
I Am Legend," Excellent!!
","This is a modernization of the 1964 Ubaldo B. Ragona classic horror/sci-fi/drama, 'The Last Man On Earth,' starring Vincent Price. This features Will Smith in the lead (no, this isn't like the mistake that was Wild, Wild West) and his strongest co-star is a beautiful German Shepherd named 'Abby' who are both brilliant, by the way.Frankly, after the Pursuit of Happiness (even the title gets on my nerves), I was afraid Will Smith was about to head down the dark and dreadful path which has led Eddie Murphy into obscurity, but I'm happy to see this is not the case.The pacing, story, and execution are beautifully done, leaving behind no second thoughts or misgivings, in this reviewer's opinion. This version of the tale is properly constructed and executed. It is beautiful, witty, clever, and artfully suspenseful, with a most excellent execution of a much older story.Neville's descent into insanity is nothing graceful, and there is no attempt made to make it appear candy-coated. This came off as 'real,' due to the quality performances by Smith and Abby, the slick but still solid production style, and the quality CGI.All in all, this is definitely good for a Friday/Saturday night's viewing, though not one for the kiddies. This really does the original (AND the original remake 'Omega Man' proud). Wow! What a movie! Simply Beautiful in its Darkness.It rates a 9.2/10 from...the Fiend :.We saw this xmas Eve night at our local hometown theater, Movies on the Parkway in Sevierville, TN.",9,1,5,25 December 2007
The Game," Totally FREAKS you!
","If you are into the sub-genre of psychological horror/thrillers, this movie is a definite must-see. While I have never been wholly impressed by Michael Douglas's performances (he is most certainly NOT his father), this was, by far, the exception to that rule.I won't ruin any aspect of this movie by detailing the plot, but as I already said, if you are a fan of the genre, if you liked Identity, Phone Booth, Brainscan or just a good mind twister, see this movie!!I was completely impressed with the performances, the sets & designs, the story line, the quality of production, the marvelous suspense generated, and the direction. This was by far, one of the superior endeavors in this genre.It rates an 8.8/10 from...the Fiend :.",9,0,3,30 December 2003
Kick-Ass," Both Insidius AND Fiendish
","I love this film. I can see why some parents are going crazy about the content, but frankly, if a parent has done his/her job, some superhero/comic book movie can't jade the kiddies as badly as folks are saying this one will. Get over yourselves, and enjoy the film for the care-free fun flick it is.Slick production style, relatively low budget, with high quality action sequences, and some awesome characterizations make for some really great movie moments. Although this stars one of the kiddies, this movie may not be appropriate for all ages. The starlet uses some horrible language and perpetrates some horrible actions, but the film is richer for it.Nicolas Cage's role is below tertiary, but it is wholly enjoyable seeing him in this endeavor. As usual, he contributes a beautiful aspect to the story's emotionality.All in all? It's suitable for Friday/Saturday night viewing as long as your bff/gf isn't the churchy type.It rates an 8.2/10 from...the Fiend :.",8,5,11,3 August 2010
Ghostbusters," He slimed me!
","At the top of my list of favorite comedic actors, right next to Gene Wilder and Steve Martin, is Bill Murray. These three comprise over 1/2 of my entire comedy collection.This movie was beautiful. It was funny, not clever, but it was not intended to be an intellectual film. This is pure comedy with a little sci-fi and a bit more spirituality thrown into the mix, making for a great comedic effort. I was, and am, happy that their references to the Hebrew God were few. Far too often in films of this type, the dialog is riddled with too many references to religion. Here, they failed to do that, and made for a much better film, in my opinion.Dan Aykroyd is another of my favorites, and his performance in this production is one of the reasons why. I love his ability to portray a serious straight-man to the comedic efforts of the films in which he stars. He stands there, straight-faced, and allows the laughs to rebound off his lines, his facial expressions, and himself. He is a quality actor, and he demonstrated that quality in this work.The script was creative, the dialog was funny and endearing, and the performances were professional, top row comedy. I will refrain from detailing the story line here, as most everyone else has done that already, and I do hate to be redundant.So rent it, watch it, then buy it.It's definitely one for the collection.It rates a 7.6/10 from...the Fiend :.",8,0,0,31 December 2003
Hero," Not the 'arthouse' accomplishment it thinks it is
","This endeavor was loaded with visual Eye Candy that just wouldn't let you stop watching. But I wanted to. Believe me; I wanted to. You get the first story; a contrived lie told with insincerity. When it is discovered to be a lie by the Emperor, the same story is retold from the Emperor's deduction and reasoning. After the truth is out about the facts surrounding this story, it is told yet AGAIN as the 'true' story.I'm sorry, but even with the eye candy to keep the 'eye candy whore' inside me entertained, the story was still so dry and boring that I honestly wished I had gone to see AvP again, instead. This work, frankly, tried too hard to be stylish and 'artsy,' but as far as I'm concerned, it was neither.Perhaps it was my personal mood at the time, as everyone else here seems to have loved it. But, as usual, I find myself in the select few who disagree with the general consensus.While this movie was filmed in a beautiful style and bore some of the best costuming and performances of the year, having to sit through the same story three times was just too much for me. It rates a 4.3/10 from...the Fiend :.",4,0,1,28 August 2004
Shrek the Third," WAY Better Than The 'Professional' Critics Led Me To Expect!
","Being the third installment in a hugely successful franchise, this is usually where a run begins to show real franchise sickness. That, coupled with the horrid reviews submitted by the 'professional' critics, I really expected something so convoluted and largely unfunny, as to make this nigh unwatchable.What I got, was a beautiful story, charming characters, top notch animation, chases, escapes, announcements, voyages, captures, deceits, death, birth, King Arthur, the second ugly stepsister (of Cinderella), true love (of course), and a wonderful execution of the story.I was quite surprised, actually, with the high level of comedic and animation quality and large level of entertainment derived from this work. This was a genuinely GOOD film! Don't listen to those other guys. If you love Shrek, you will love him even more when this is over.In fact, this is SO well done, that it continues the progression of better films. The first rated an 8.1/10, the second rated an 8.4/10. This one rates an 8.9/10 from...the Fiend :.",9,28,51,18 May 2007
K-19: The Widowmaker," This was like dinner in a good restaurant, but with a bad server.
","This is a story well told. It does run overly long and is painfully dull at times, but the story itself is pretty interesting. Nixon is president and the Klan rules the times. George Wallace is governor of Alabama and the Soviet Russians have had enough of the American propaganda showing that every American has a car, every family has a house, and most people really have nice clothes. In the struggle for world nuclear supremacy, the (then) Soviet Union rushes to beat the US in the nuclear arms race.I won't detail the story as so many already have, but this is pretty compelling even in the slowest times, although there are an unfortunate number of those slow times. The principals herein carry off the accents well enough, although the overall feeling this story should have conveyed does not manifest itself until near the final act.All in all? This film is not for Friday or Saturday night viewing. This would serve better as an educational demonstration of Cold War attitudes, practices, and principles. For us, it felt more like a history lesson than entertainment.This wasn't fun and the drama doesn't work its way into suspense until just before the end, regardless of the sheer volume of the score. The movie runs slowly and dully until right at the end, and then it tries to win you over after all that abuse. It's like dinner in a good restaurant but with a bad server who comes along at the end of a good meal but having given horrid service, and then asks you if there was anything else they could do for you in an attempt to get an unearned tip. And just like I don't tip those servers, I can't say I enjoyed this film.I must also interject that I like to think that were this an American crew, they would have received the recognition they so deserved.This rates a 6/10 from...the Fiend :.",6,2,6,9 February 2009
Moulin Rouge!," Beautiful, Tragic, and Entertaining, If Somewhat Overdone.
","This production received SO much press and promotion that I almost passed on seeing it. In retrospect, I'm glad I didn't do that.This is one of those movies, which knows it's a movie. There are several scenes in which the characters look directly into the camera and pop off their one liner. It works well here, though.While this work is replete with clichés and the dialog is particularly trite in spots, the production itself is really quite lovely. As far as musicals go, this is one of my favorites, and this version of it is probably the best of the 6 versions I've seen.Nicole Kidman is, as usual, wonderful in this role. Even her movies I haven't liked, I've always thought she gave it her all, and the movie wasn't lacking because of her.All in all, this work was very enjoyable; tragic, but lovely.It rates an 8.4/10 from...the Fiend :.",8,3,4,9 March 2007
Back to the Future Part III," Not the best, but my favorite
","The intelligent script of the second installment is no longer in play, but these movies run seamlessly, one right after the other, with no discernible break.In my opinion, this is the most fun of the series, and grants a fond farewell to the franchise. Our favorite characters are back and are dealing with the problems of time travel once more.While the first installment had the virtue of being 'fresh and new,' and the second was 'dark and atmospheric,' this third chapter is just downright fun.The story here was developed as a way of saying, 'Goodbye' to the series. From start to finish, you feel it. While it is bittersweet for some, it plays out to a rousing and satisfying end. It is my favorite, though it is not considered to be the best of this run. Perhaps it is the flying locomotive, or maybe it's getting to see Doc Brown's sons, or suppose it's getting to watch Doc fall in love. Whatever the reason, this concluding chapter of the Back to the Future trilogy is my favorite of the bunch.It rates an 8.6/10 from...the Fiend :.",8,3,3,22 January 2005
Transformers," This is NOT the Transformers of your childhood!
","As a member of the group bearing the dubious distinction of the title, 'Baby Boomers,' I caught the animated Transformers series at the end of what I call 'My Belated Youth.' I was a fan. When I got to know the story line and the characters, I was hooked. Now, I'm not here to tell you that the old animated Transformers series was the best thing on television, because it clearly wasn't. But what I AM here to tell you is that it was ONE of the best things on television...at least as far as the story went. I tend to hold the Transformers in the same light as 'V', Battlestar Galactica, Dune, the Thundercats, Flight of the Navigator, the Last Starfighter, and the Masters of the Universe, all of vaguely the same period. These were the 'greats,' and still collectively hold a special place in my heart.There were other, larger, more successful events such as Star Wars, Close Encounters of the Third Kind, ET, and the X-Men animated series, the Dark Knight animated series, and the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtle phenomenon. And while these were hugely popular and imminently successful, the previously mentioned works are superior, in my opinion. They feature some of the same heart and some of the same style(s) but there is some element present, which connects to the humanity of me...oh, inimitable me...which none of the aforementioned works possess.Transformers carries with it the same hope for salvation most religions offer to us as a people. These are characters with a solid moral center, an other-worldly understanding of the cosmos and its implications/impact on the various life forms inhabiting it, and a sense of the greater good - salvation through redemption, redemption through action and personal responsibility. It carries non-human biological machines, which demonstrate individuality and presence of heart and such a strong moral center, as to render the mechanalities of their beings almost superfluous; cool, but unnecessary to the story.The present blockbuster counters that condition with even more humanity within the technological characters, which assists in creating more admirable characters, lends to the story a fluidity it may have otherwise lacked, and generates an appropriate level of suspense that was missing from the animated series.The visual effects are absolutely stupefying (that's a good thing) but of course they were...Spielberg knows how to put together some stunning visuals, which complement (rather than negate) the story itself. He is a Master of...Illusion (?). The pacing is great - we were never bored, even for a moment - and the story is richly executed.This is NOT the Transformers of my childhood. This is better - vastly better, and not due to the almost ethereal visuals, but because of the moral strength, the state of heart, and the gripping story to be found herein.Watch it. It will enamor you.It rates a 9.8/10 from...the Fiend :.",10,3,10,12 July 2007
Men in Black II," Inferior but fun in spite of itself
","I enjoy sequels in that it is always fun to watch people's reactions to them. What do they expect? They expect a good continuation of the original story. What do they get? They get a mindless monkey-making vehicle with little or no consideration given to the consumer.This was no different. However, it is a decent continuation of the original. Not good, but decent. I did enjoy the story, but the premise was over-used and a bit dog-eared (pun intended for those of you who have seen it). What I do enjoy about this movie is that when you play MIB 1 & 2, back-to-back, it plays like one long movie.The science in this installment is a bit better than in the original, but the comedic element gets a bit tired after a time. As I've said, in my opinion, Will Smith is highly over-rated, and should be replaced, if Barry Sonnenfeld decides to do another one of these.Other critics have declared their disdain for Frank the Pug having too much screen time, but compared to Smith, I think I preferred the little fur ball.When we left the MIB at the end of the first installment, K had resumed his normal, mundane life. But now, because K was the only agent with knowledge of a mysterious alien artifact, J has to recover K, restore his memory, and get him back in black. With the help of Frank the Pug (the scene in the car with 'Who Let the Dogs Out' and Frank is the most endearing scene IN the movie), J sets out on his mission, but he has very little time. If the artifact is not returned, Earth could be vaporized.We discover a few things about K's past of which we had no prior clues and it leads to a nice ending elemental twist.While it was not as enjoyable as the first, I was still entertained by this production, in spite of the obvious subtitle, '...2, The Quest for More Money.' Yogurt, 'Spaceballs.' It rates a 7.8/10 from...the Fiend :.",8,0,1,4 November 2003
Million Dollar Baby," Unforgettable
","This is easily one of the most unforgettable, heart-wrenching, bittersweet films I've ever seen. Eastwood not only directs a masterpiece, but directs himself - a feat which I'm told is rather difficult. Morgan Freeman's narration is hauntingly loving, even though the story he has to tell is quite dark, but the darkness is in the reality of the story, and not in the hearts of those involved. There are few obvious effects, car chases, bullets fired, or bodies burned, but this is quite beautiful in its story, grace, and execution.This is one movie which earned the kudos (and multiple awards) it earned. There are many award-winners which made me stop and say, 'Huh?' But this is definitely NOT one of them.Further, this is a movie for everyone. This is not a chick flick, but neither is it a guy flick. Literally all walks can love this work. It is simply amazing, and was a total surprise for this reviewer.It rates a 9.3/10 from...the Fiend :.",9,6,9,20 May 2007
The Nightmare Before Christmas," Enjoyable But Overrated Burton Animation
","While this story was creative, it was not original-there have been similar inter-dimensional/realm travel plots throughout cinematic history. The animation is not the masterpiece it is played up to be, the dark Disneyesque songs, and the Gothic Tim Burton theme combine to make this something we've never quite seen before, while it is still reminiscent of scores of other works...Beetle Juice for one, which is another well-received Tim Burton Gothic rom/com with the darkling edge.In my opinion, this is one of the more over-rated animations ever. James and the Giant Peach came out about the same time, and it was much better done, but without the Gothic story and setting.Enjoyable, but overrated. And the animation isn't all it's made out to be.It rates a 5.4/10 from...the Fiend :.",5,1,7,8 April 2007
Resident Evil: Apocalypse," Deserving sequel, better than the first installment.
","Now, I was not an immediate fan of the first movie. I didn't hate it! But I was not happy with it at first. But with an added budget (the studios actually LISTENED for once), and a better, more cohesive story, this second installment is quite entertaining! It combines top of the line CG-Eye Candy with natural dialog and some dark twists to bring you wonderfully dark story sequences and some bone-crunching action! It was practically non-stop action from start to finish and Milla Jovovich's tom-boy style really served her well this time around. The direction was superb! The shots and layouts; the sequences and colors! I could easily compare the use of color and cutting sequences with the over-touted Suspira, but .. I just did. This was a GOOD Resident Evil MOVIE!! Great action, great story, great portrayals. On the downside, the extras playing zombies must have all missed their mommies so much!! I'm telling' ya! Those in the background had that 'gotta wave cuz we're on camera' thing going on, and it almost distracted Me from this otherwise GREAT flick! I mean, put on the eggs cuz the ham's already DONE!The 'creepy kid sitting in a chair with his/her back turned who doesn't turn out to be a totally healthy lil kid anymore' device has been used and abused. In fact, this tactic should have been retired to a shoe box the second Scary Movie 3 parodied it so well.The fight between Nemesis and Alice was ... well, it looked GREAT on film, but... okay, there's NO WAY it would've gone like that. But okay. Just one small contrivance to help further the movie, and it can be forgiven because it really ~does~ look great on film.This is not a 'thinking man's movie,' nor is it classic horror fare. This attempt falls short in both of those departments because it is, above all, an action flick with horror ~elements~. It is not meant to be scary. It ~is~ meant to be suspenseful, which it certainly is. This production utilizes brilliantly choreographed fighting sequences and some great style, without taking itself too seriously. It is played straight from the vest, with little humor; just as it should be. The drama was a tangible entity.Some consider the cemetery scene in this movie to be a 'Plot Hole.' Their contention is that the T-Virus would not (or could not) affect those already dead and under ground. While I agree with this particular vein of thought, I must explain that this sequence was an attempt to romance the fanboys. Call it an 'homage,' if you will, to the cemetery segment of the wildly popular video game, 'Resident Evil 2.' The argument has also been made that Alice, being who and what she is, would never have led them through such a dangerous area ~as~ the cemetery. Again, I have to say that it was (however contrived) an attempt to win over the fanboys who all but killed box office receipts of the first installment of this line.IF you're a zombie fan, a fan of the game, or just like freaky deaky dark lil horror flix to snuggle your best girl by, this is the one for YOU!!! This is definitely an 'A' scale production which has surpassed its first installment and earned nearly three times the initial estimated budget!It rates an 8.8/10 from...the Fiend :.",9,8,17,13 January 2005
Dumb and Dumber," Funny For A While
","This is one of those films you can watch, and actually laugh at for a time or two, but after that, it's just not funny anymore.For a first viewing, this flick will deliver some genuine belly laughs, although you will feel your intelligence slip, as you enjoy it. Watch this one only for the chuckles. If you watch it for any other reason, you're watching the wrong movie.One of Carrey's better performances. His earlier works are far better, comedically, than are his later works. I like the genre change he seems to be experimenting with of late, and I hope it does something to rejuvenate the quality of his performances. Either way, this is quite entertaining, if only for a few run-throughs.It rates a 5.5/10 from...the Fiend :.",6,6,13,17 March 2007
Shrek 2," Less Cynical, More Endearing.
","The second installment of the Shrek franchise was less cynical, but more in your face than the first. The snide comments are still present, but they are presented this time in a family atmosphere, for the most part, and therefore were less sexual in nature. Mostly.The characters this time are more extravagant, less adventuresome, but at the same time, they cast a creative spin on older, more familiar storybook characters and reintroduced them into the Shrekiverse. I thought that was a smart move, considering the content and execution of this particular story line.I ultimately found this endeavor more enjoyable than the first. And, while the cynicism was still pervasive, it was less edgy and more family/child friendly than its predecessor.It rates an 8.4/10 from...the Fiend :.",8,0,0,9 March 2007
Kill Bill: Vol. 1," Disturbing but entertaining
","This movie has been criticized for having no substance; no meat, as it were. Now, I'm no great fan of Tarrantino (in fact, I hadn't liked a single of his productions before this one), so there are no feelings to be hurt on his behalf. There is no other reason for me to defend this film, than the very real fact that I loved it!The second issue is the 'violence against women' issue. It's been said that this movie is like 'A Clockwork Orange' in its demonstration of everything that is wrong with our society. Okay, as true as that may be, this film covers MANY societies, not just American. It also shows that the woman does NOT have to be the victim. She can (and should) stand on her own two feet and do something about her problems rather then waiting for some Prince Charming to come do it for her.This plot and story has been detailed so many times on IMDb, that I won't even bother laying out the plot except to say that this plot was so well-conceived and executed as to win it 10 awards and gross nearly 4 times its original budget.Every single artist involved in this attempt has surrendered a very compelling finished product in that it is a dark and lovely story (yes, it has a great story), that is embedded with some of the most synergistically graphic brutality I've ever witnessed on film. The action is unbelievable, the narrative is instrumental in moving the story along from scene to scene, and the score is as inspired as the screenplay.The choreography by Sonny Chiba (who also portrayed Hattori Hanzo) was excellent and, when viewing the final work, looked natural and brilliant. And I must say that the soundtrack of this work was inspired and more than competently highlighted each scene in which the chosen music was featured.If you haven't seen this, I highly recommend it. It's action, not horror or even drama. It's NOT for the squeamish.It rates an 8.8/10 from...the Fiend :.",9,0,2,20 January 2005
Charlie and the Chocolate Factory," Not dark...enough.
","This was somewhat of a disappointment for this movie goer. I expected all the hype to at least be marginally accurate. 'Darker,' 'Scarier,' 'more true to the book...' While it was more true to the original literary work, this director walked up to the bell, but did not have the wherewithal to ring it. His Michael Jackson imitation went a long way to give you a good feeling for the true nature of the character, but it fell short of accomplishing anything in the way of demonstrating the true darkness found within Wonka's heart.There were Oompa Loompas, yes. One. He was duplicated and layered over and over to a laughable effect. While all the other graphic effects were wonderful, their 'cast' of Oompa Loompas was just disgusting.I was disappointed.7/10",7,1,7,16 July 2005
Mission: Impossible II," Rides the coattails of MI1
","It's an odd phenomenon, that of the box office. I'm finding as I have reviewed literally hundreds of movies here at IMDb, that those which gross highest at the box office aren't necessarily the highest rated films. That in itself is peculiar, in my opinion.Take for example, Mission Impossible 2. It had an increased budget ($125M as compared to MI1 which had a budget of $75M) and took in $545M (as opposed to MI1's $452M worldwide estimate), yet MI2 rates a 5.7 while MI1 rated a 6.6 among users here at IMDb. Isn't that interesting? It made more money, sold more tickets, yet was an inferior movie.'Sequels, by definition alone, are inferior films.' Randy, Scream 2I found this work playful, innovative, and fun. It was not, however, as edgy or fresh as the first. MI2 tried too hard to be 'hip,' or cool, and it just came off as another ghetto flick in spite of the stellar performances, well choreographed and executed action sequences, and interesting plot turns.This sequel obviously rode the coattails of its original in the hopes that MI1 was strong enough to carry a weaker installment. Obviously that tactic worked. My question is, 'Will MI1 also be expected to carry MI3?' I surely hope not, or the next installment could be the death of the franchise.This rates a 6.2/10 from...the Fiend :.",6,1,2,17 January 2005
World Trade Center," Not What It Should Have Been
","I knew what to expect. I read the reviews before buying this, but it's Cage, so it goes in the collection, regardless. I have to say that this was not what it should have been.While this is a fantastic dramatization of what happens with four rescuers, it fails to tell anything about the actual event itself. Many movie goers were looking for an Oliver Stone's JFK-stylized World Trade Center type drama, and instead we got a look through the microscope rather than a look at the larger picture, as told by the evidence. I think that's what disappointed most audience members with this work.But it's not bad for what it is. It's well written, tense, and triumphant. Cage is completely believable...I wouldn't expect any less from him.It rates a 6.6/10 from...the Fiend :.",7,1,3,8 April 2007
A Bug's Life," Great Fun, But Not Pixar's Best.
","Considering how early into the CGI revolution this movie was made, it's amazing how good this movie really is. The animation is quite well dome for its time, and was revolutionary in the CGI animation processes.The story line is quite cute, simple enough for a child to follow, yet complex enough with subtext to entertain adults. The characters were developed well enough to allow them to endear themselves to the audience.I can't say this is a wonderful movie, but the kiddies will like it, and if you're into children's entertainment, you probably will, too.If you enjoy this work, you should watch James and the Giant Peach, a movie which was released 2 years prior, and is obviously the template for this one. It's also much better done. If you want a good ANT movie, check out Antz by DreamWorks. As usual, I'm in the minority...I liked it better.It rates a 6.8/10 from...the Fiend :.",7,1,1,9 March 2007
The Dark Knight," Don't get me wrong, I LOVED this movie...but some of the fanboys have GOT to gain some perspective...
","I won't go on and on about how good this movie is, nor will I detail each and every nuance of the film as others have. What I'm here to say is, 'Yes...this is a great film. Heath Ledger is the quintessential Joker. This is, quite possibly, the best performance of Ledger's illustrious (if shortened) career.' This film is beautiful, dark, wonderful, tragic...electric. It features breathtaking city elements (skyscrapers to beat all city monoliths), stellar performances, and beautiful darkling nemeses. Bale delivers as both Batman and Wayne, but no one expected him to fail in this role. Morgan Freeman's character {Fox) asserts himself this go around, and pulls it off beautifully. And I couldn't be happier about Sir Michael Caine's reprisal of his role as Alfred, and I hope he continues throughout the franchise. It's always nice to see Gary Oldman, regardless of the work, and Maggie Gyllenhaal was totally strong as Rachel Dawes. I was more than satisfied to see her assume that role, and she does not disappoint. The chemistry was far superior to that of the original...both between the characters and within the story itself.Honestly, I had not previously believed it would be possible to top the first of this run, 'Batman Begins,' but, 'The Dark Knight,' does so with little difficulty I must say, for posterity's sake, however, that the CGI job on Eckhart's Dent (post explosion) was ambitious, but the finished product was just nasty. Makeup effects along with a LITTLE CGI would have been beautiful, but what we got was more reminiscent of Imhotep's early incarnation in the first, 'The Mummy.' Well, half of it, anyway. (I won't explain that, you'll have to see the movie for yourself.) It messes with the suspension of belief, for me. It is like a book that keeps reminding you that it's a book. The CGI...was so impossible that it kept snapping me back out of the movie, and had me looking at the rest of the effects for the remainder of the film. It WAS effective, however, in shocking the audience, but once achieved, it was difficult to get back into the story flow.Otherwise, this is a most excellent piece of work, and I cannot wait for the next one. At least...I'm hoping above hope that there will BE a 'next one.' Considering that this movie has been billed as the most mistake-ridden film of the year so far, who knows. Personally, I don't care about the 16 'major mistakes' found in continuity. I love the story and would pay to see another one.But above a 9/10 here at IMDb? I think not. This film is not better than Schindler's List, Star Wars IV, Casablanca, or ANY installment of The Lord of the Rings. You fanboys have GOT to be kidding me. It's great, yes, but not THAT great.It rates an 8.5/10 from...the Fiend :.",8,1,12,4 August 2008
Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix," What Was Done, Was Done Well, But HP5 Does Not Even BEGIN To Live Up To Its Potential!!
","I wanted to love it. I have anticipated this movie for several years, now, but I have to say I was terribly disappointed by this installment of the blockbuster Harry Potter franchise. This was one rich novel, and one horribly chopped-up film! It's almost as if the director was handed a few sequences and told, 'Make a movie,' and the remaining 2/3 of the book were left unattended.If you have no emotional investment in the franchise, and are simply a fan of the movies and not the novels, then this movie will be adequate in propelling the story into the next installment.If you ARE a fan of the books; however, you will discover that 3/4 of the work is left to the book! This work is nothing more than a shadow of its literary self.While the children are growing into fine young adults, and their performances are growing with them, the peripheral characters in this chapter are nothing better than lackluster, at best. As far as the kids go, I do have to interject that Dan Radcliffe has grown exponentially as an actor. He will have a brilliant career ahead of him, should he decide to follow this course. I can't wait to see where life leads him once the HP series is done and done. Emma's performances have grown over the years, as well. She seems more comfortable within her own skin, as Hermione, and Rup is growing up nicely. Dan, the world is your plum...just reach out and pluck it.Bonnie Wright just can't seem to get a handle on Ginny Weasley. Her weak portrayal seems to make Ginny's character more and more superfluous, installment by installment. If it weren't for the known storyline and her momentary importance therein, I would say the movies would be better without her. Her performances when she was younger, were more convincing and felt more real.Matthew Lewis is adequate as Neville. Frankly, I can't imagine anyone else who could portray the vacant look, wordless emoting, and complete lack of charisma any better than Matthew Lewis. If he didn't have at least SOME bearing on the outcome of Book 7, we don't seem to need his character, either. His character's presence and on screen time seem to be dwindling, rather than building; contrary to the books. Hopefully, if/when the time comes, he will be able to draw upon his experience as a child actor and enunciate around those prosthetic teeth! You can barely make out what he says! I'm also hoping he gets a grip on those bug eyes, and finds the ability to rise to the occasion, because in my opinion, he was much better an actor, when he was a younger boy. The 'actor' he is now seems to be utterly out of place on the screen.Regrettably, Tom Felton had VERY little screen time, and I can't say I remember a single line, if he even had one. Evanna Lynch, on the other hand, had plenty of lines, lots of charm, and nailed Luna Lovegood's character quite well. Here's hoping she can keep up the pretense, long enough to finish out the necessity of her character. The Phelps twins got their shining moment, though not AS shining as one might expect due to the plethora of huge plot elements, etc. which were omitted, but it was adequate in its portrayal of the general feeling in Hogwarts at the time, though it did lack something, merely due to the writing, and in no way due to the twins themselves. They were awesome, as usual. I hope the next screenplay includes their presence, as the book did. Maggie Smith's screen time (as compared to her character's word time in the novel) was significantly less than what I felt it should have been. The best scene of the SERIES involving Minerva McGonagal was LEFT OUT/CUT! But okay. They 'had' to do that due to screen time obligations and contractual stipulations. I know. I know.All in all, it was the hatchet job done on this work that brings it down in my opinion. Performance -wise, you'll get about what we've come to expect from most everyone but the trio who are improved, installment by installment. Otherwise, the enjoyment factor was lessened by a lack of continuity, and the adaptational quality was zilch. Inconceivably, this installment enjoys a box office gross second only to the initial installment! Just goes to show you how few people read, and how there's no accounting for taste. Read the book. You'll enjoy that immensely more than this film editor's wet dream.ALTHOUGH, what it DID show, it showed well.It rates a 5.5/10 from...the Fiend :.",6,3,5,24 July 2007
2001: A Space Odyssey," The film you love, but hate to watch
","It seems to be trendy to have lovely things to say about Stanley Kubrick's Space Odessy. Like A Clockwork Orange, this is one of his films that I just cannot tolerate to watch. The story is beautiful, and the directing style is inspired and true genius at work. There, I said it. But the musical score seems to be the star, and frankly, it's nerve-wracking, unintelligent classical droning just totally put me off this film. It's a migraine generating cacophony which sincerely has your hand twitching involuntarily towards the remote.It does have a beautiful story, if you can wade through the noise to discover it. It does have wonderful performances, if you can hang in there that long. It does have some innovative ideas in the genre of science fiction, if you aren't brain dead by the time you get to them.Personally, I don't want to have to work that hard to enjoy a movie, no matter how good, it ultimately is.Based on content, it rates a 9.8/10.Based on musical score, it rates a 0.5/10.Based on performances, it receives a 7.8/10.Based on the watchability factor, it rates a 3.2/10.That's a combined average of 5.325/10 from...the Fiend :.",5,6,14,22 January 2005
Blood Diamond," Folded, but in a different way.
","Folded, but in a different way. A father/son drama is the central story, although surrounding that, we are given the gut-wrenching story of conflict diamonds, their mining, a few of the purposes they serve, the marketing of them, and how dramatically they change lives. This is story driven, with a little action (all of it violent), some gripping drama, and a compelling plot. The dialog is gritty and heartbreaking. I both loved and hated it. It is a tremendously well done movie, but it is on a short list of movies I love but never want to see again. This is depressingly poignant and real.All in all? This seemed extraordinarily long and sad, meaning I would resign this to a weekday/night movie and save something more uplifting/upbeat for the weekend.It was very well done, but I never want to see it again.It rates an 8.0/10 from...the Fiend :.",8,3,4,31 January 2009
Men in Black," Dark fun.
","From the director of 'Addams Family' and 'Addams Family Values,' comes a dark comedy/sci-fi featuring two of America's most loved actors.This movie is anything but a let down. The intelligent darkly comedic aspects of this movie are both clever and witty. While the science in this movie is a little lacking, the action and comedic elements are highly effective. I found the performances to be solid and well-delivered. Tommy Lee Jones could not give a bad performance, even if his director was Mick Garris! It simply is not IN him to do so. Will Smith...well, I'm not really a fan of Mr. Smith. In my opinion, he is the single-most over-rated, ego-inflated figure in the industry. I'm neither a fan of his work, nor his over-inflated pay checks. That not withstanding, his performance in this movie was quite good, and even I could enjoy it.The direction was wonderful, the creativity of the aliens was imaginative and astounding, and the plot was quite inspired. We found the finished product to be an instant and welcome addition to our 'comic book' collection.PLOT: A new 'bug' has come to town, and it's terrorizing Manhattan in a brand new Edgar suit. It is up to K and his unseasoned partner J to determine why he is here on Earth, and to foil his evil plan.It sounds far more campy than it is. The superior direction and ultimate polished execution never allowed this work to cross that line. And while it is delivered with tongue-in-cheek humor, the darker aspects cloak the levity in a fine darkling gossamer shroud.I highly enjoy this production, from all angles of a critical eye.It rates an 8.4/10 from...the Fiend :.",8,0,0,3 November 2003
Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind," A decent art-house psychodrama. Not what you expect from Carrey
","This movie was a surprise. I never expected it to be as compelling as it is. I don't really want to say too much about this work, because until you've seen it for yourself, I'd hate to ruin it for you. Suffice it to say that this has some wonderful darkling twists, coupled with superb (not brilliant, but very well done) performances, and marvelous direction. It lacks character development in the beginning, but you find out why that is, soon enough. I was genuinely surprised by this story and the execution of this production.It is WELL worth your time to check it out.It rates an 8.2/10 from...the Fiend :.",8,0,2,7 March 2007
Alice in Wonderland," NOT a movie for 'straights.'
","If you consider yourself 'normal,' have an extraordinarily complex mind for numbers, or find all things irrational a bore, this is NOT the movie for you. In fact, you should probably go find a nice copy of War and Peace and leave the cinematic venue to others more suited to it. If you expect a faithful adaptation of Through the Looking Glass, then again, this is not the movie for you. If you expect something written ages ago by some adored author long put in his grave - something reflecting the time period in which he lived, well, you're a bit closer.Or perhaps you can love it, even if you're a fuddy duddy. Because this work is beautiful. It is Magical. It is extraordinary. Regardless of the 3-D aspects; with or without iMax; irrespective of class, age, or breeding, this work is astoundingly complex in its simplicity. I know that seems like an enigma, but the Cheshire understands. Do you?This film rates an easy 8.8/10 from...the Fiend :.",9,6,12,8 March 2010
The Mummy Returns," An excellent sequel to a most wonderful adventure!
","I loved the Mummy, and I love the Mummy Returns!I adore the CGI-created Army of Annubis, the wonderful recreations of ancient Egypt and the various creative devices used in this movie.What I did NOT adore/love was the horridly thrown together awful, Awful AWFUL CGI monster, the Scorpion King.You know, an audience can TELL when the movie was nothing more than a 2-hour long advertisement for the video game! This wasn't, but it was oh so VERY close.The Scorpion King's character was so badly done, it nearly ruined the whole movie for me...kind of like the 'monster' at the end of 'Dreamcatcher.' This was HORRIBLE, and reminiscent of Atari's beginning video days, or claymation. Remember claymation? *coughs* lame *coughs*Now that I've said that, the story line was FUN, the characters were endearing, well presented and developed, and the direction was wonderful. I loved the cinematography quality of this production.As sequels go, this one picks up a few years from the end of the first, and while we, the viewers have missed a lot, there is not so much that we feel left out or completely out of the loop.Evie and Rick are now married and have an eight year old son. The Bamebridge Scholars are no longer turning Evie away, but are after her to work with them now, though she prefers the field.In the field, they discover the Bracelet of Annubis, and their precocious child slips it on. MISTAKE!I won't detail what happens after that. I LOVE this movie, the imagery scenes and sets. Absolutely wonderful production reminiscent of the Indiana Jones days. Everything was wonderful except for the horrible CGI treatment given to the Scorpion King. That really was awful!It gets an 8.2/10 from...the Fiend :.",8,1,1,28 September 2003
Avatar," Phenomenal
","Avatar is phenomenal! Nowhere else is the Pagan story told so clearly, lovingly, and well. This is a film for all time, all peoples; it resonates with the indigenous peoples throughout the world, with the lives of their ancestors, and the oral histories passed down by hundreds of cultures.Aside from that, we found Avatar to be entertaining, well made, creatively produced, and lovingly presented. There are many factors in this film one can love and designate as a 'favorite part,' well established characters, and a tight storyline with good pacing. There doesn't seem to be a second of wasted film in this lengthy epic tale.All in all? This is great viewing anytime, and sufficiently awesome for Friday/Saturday night viewing. We bought the Blu Ray and cannot wait to own the extended edition later next year, or so.It rates a 9.75/10 from...the Fiend :.",10,1,4,28 June 2010
Drag Me to Hell," Gruelling and Tedius
","I must admit I was categorically disappointed in Raimi's efforts herein. I have seldom walked out of a movie, but we left this about 45 minutes into it because it never got GOOD. All the best parts were in the trailers, and the effects were laughable. You can see wires, ill-timed stunts, and have your gag reflex triggered for free, so there's no reason to pay good money to see this. Our theater offered us rain-checks, which we gratefully accepted.I will say that the story is quite compelling, and if it is released on DVD in an extended R version I may give it another chance, because hopefully, they will clean up the final proof and make this something WORTH seeing. Honestly, though, I'm not sure that's even possible, as the acting was as bad as (if not worse than) the effects. I'm not sure an extended R version would actually save this.All in all? Spackling the mold-ridden ceiling in a friend's trailer has GOT to be more entertaining.It rates a 3.0/10 from...the Fiend :.",3,18,40,1 June 2009
Grindhouse," Grindhouse Tribute Pays Off
","Tarantino's films are a bit of an acquired taste. Frankly, most casual movie goers either love him or hate him. I'm one of the few who can take or leave him, but when Grindhouse was announced, I knew I would have to see it.As a tribute to the 'B' flicks of the 1970's, this 'Grindhouse' feature has been worked until the quality digital media closely resembled the scratched, hair-laden, ill-cut films of the era. I would imagine with today's technology, it took more work to rough it up that badly, than it would have to present a quality modern-day actioner.The idea of the Grindhouse Double Feature is not new, but this work stands as Tarantino's revivalist attempt, and both films were great fun.Planet Terror is a sci-fi horror gore-fest I found delightful. The story was prominent, but did take a back seat to the gore effects, which were mostly make up effects. This was great in that 'B' movie kind of way, and even serious movie goers can view this one comfortably as a guilty pleasure and rates a 7.7/10 on the 'B' scale.Death Proof was the one I was waiting for, personally. Kurt Russell again on the big screen as the tough-guy/bad boy? Yes! The stunts here were true stunts, without the use of CGI. The girls in this work were awesome, and it was heartwarming to see Russell back in the role in which the nation came to love him. This one was just plain good, in spite of the 'B' movie factor and rates an 8.9/10 on the 'B' scale.I'd say this attempt was a 'HIT.' Here's hoping for Grindhouse 2.Together, they rate an 8.3/10 on the 'B' Scale from...the Fiend :.",8,2,7,11 April 2007
Mission: Impossible," Entertaining, slick endeavor.
","DePalma's all about lighting, camera angles, the perfect details for the perfect scene. All this makes for a much better finished product, and helps set the mood and pacing of the story. The story for this enterprise centers around Tom Cruise and his character, Ethan Hunt. When his mission goes awry, the frame begins to tighten. Everywhere he turns, everyone around Ethan seems to be on the 'other' side, or operating in a duplicitous manner. It's up to our hero to fit together the pieces of this mental puzzle and figure out 'who dunnit?'An interesting (if unoriginal) plot which plays out well beneath DePalma's direction and Cruise's performance abilities.I'm not a fan of Cruise. I personally don't like him very much. I've never cared for the way he comes off as feeling superior. But I do have to admit that he's done few movies that I haven't liked. He is a talent unto himself, and as over-rated as he may appear to be, I think he's earned those ratings by delivering quality entertainment through quality performances.Nice action, good level of suspense, interesting characters, and a flexible yet solid plot.A very entertaining (if unremarkable), slick endeavor.It rates an 8.4/10 from...the Fiend :.",8,0,1,17 January 2005
Saw," The HellRaiser of This Decade
","Every now and then something comes along that is new and fresh. It catches the slasher/serial killer fan by surprise and gives us hope that there will be a good franchise run in the making.Hellraiser was one such film. Now, I'm not saying Saw is anything like Hellraiser, other than it also caught me by surprise. When I first saw the previews, I thought oh no! Not another '5 kids start off for a weekend and get stalked' kind of thing, which this is NOT. This is also NOT your typical slasher, serial killer, etc. movie! This work has the advantage of not only a fresh spin, but a fresh screenplay, compelling characters, and some awesome atmosphere. I thoroughly enjoyed this one, found myself on the edge of my seat a few times, and nearly breathless once or twice.I was delightfully surprised, as I did not expect this level of quality performances and direction. It was thoroughly enjoyable and rates an 8.4/10 from...the Fiend :.",8,0,2,11 April 2007
The Last Samurai," Beautiful, but still lacking
","I LOVE this movie! But it's not all that it's made out to be. In some ways, it's more, but in others, it's less. Let me explain.This film has been hyped as a masterpiece of cinematic art. It IS wonderfully filmed, with great effects, superior sound, and beautiful location shots. A masterpiece? Hardly. The plot line is too weak, Cruise's character so contrived, that there is little point to this movie.This film has been dogged as completely useless with too many slow spots. It DOES have slow spots. It is primarily a drama, actually, regardless of how it was billed, so there ARE slow areas where story- or character-development are given center stage.It seems viewers either love or hate this movie based on the two basic factors above; however, I find myself somewhere in the middle. I was genuinely surprised with the caliber of performance Tom Cruise turned in. I'm NOT a fan of his work, but this time, his portrayal was quite compelling. I found the story and all and details surrounding the way of life of Japan's past to be interesting, and the action sequences (what there was of them) were stunning. So was the cinematography of this picture. Astounding and the landscape shots were breath taking.All in all, I enjoyed this work, although I don't consider it as art house as the makers (or the Academy) did. It rates a 7.4/10 from...the Fiend :.",7,0,2,5 March 2006
A Clockwork Orange," Detestable Kubrick social commentary I hold in high disdain.
","It seems to be very en-vogue to like this movie and have favorable things to say about it, but I care not for such status labels or the opinions of others concerning my tastes in movies. Therefore, I will speak my true thoughts on the subject of theater, since I have a solid background where movies are concerned.This was a work of art, true enough. It was bold and insightful, if muddled and incoherent at times. Kubrick's genius will live long after he did. That having been said, this movie glamorizes wanton drug use, rape, and senseless violence; uses a language which the viewer has no hope of ever understanding; and epitomizes what's WRONG with our society. Some would say that's what makes it great. I say, it's 137 minutes wasted from my life that I will never get back, thanks to the 5-minute boyfriend of an ex nightmare-in-law, and his insistence that I watch this piece of garbage. Do yourself a favor. See it; just so you can say, 'Yes, I saw it. It was HORRIBLE and STUPID!' Other than that, there is no reason to bother with this film.I give it a 1.0/10.the Fiend :.",1,18,45,28 October 2003
The Fly," Excellent work. Excellent remake.
","As a remake, this movie is an excellent demonstration of the advancements of science and technology and how they influence the entertainment industry. While there is more science in the content of this production, there is also more science in its making.I found the on-screen chemistry between Goldblum and Davis to be delightful and it was portrayed on screen just as lovely as the world witnessed it off screen. The producers did well to capitalize on the relationship between these two very lovable and dynamic thespians while the relationship was still 'golden.' While there were omitted scenes, and the story line was somewhat altered, I found the newest story to be very compelling, tense, and fresh. The photography in this movie was excellent, as was the film quality, and I absolutely loved the dialog. It was intelligent and witty, dramatic and raw.The cinematography was creatively done, so as to give you the benefits of the best possible angles, the best of the shots and takes were selected. The set designs and layouts were obviously done with respect to the story in mind; the science IN the story. I found the whole idea, design, and execution of the transportation pods to be very well done, at the time; new and innovative. Now, of course, the excellent work done here, is a bit dated, but for the age and era in which it was done, it was done very well; with a creativity and expression seldom seen in the industry these days.And while this was a remake, it was in no way a cheapened version of the original; such as we have now with remake after remake being churned out of the gullets of Hollywood...watered down versions of the old classics, nothing but money making ventures which offer nothing in the way of intellect or entertainment to the masses. This was an intelligent, witty, creative, and inspired work on film. Hats off.Very nicely done.It rates a 9.1/10 from...the Fiend :.",9,3,6,6 November 2003
From Hell," Insightful and creative professional presentation.
","While I realize this is old news, the story's been done and done, and the Royal family has been implicated by more than a dozen sources in the Ripper run, but I still found this movie highly enjoyable. The depiction of the working class in turn of the century London adequately depicts the use of absinthe, opium, and wanton harlotry; from both angles of the later. I found this movie to be beautifully filmed, creatively directed and written from an inspired angle. And, while I do have a problem with the depiction of London streets as clean, freshly-washed cobblestones, I still thought the rendition of the city was quite remarkable and had great bearing on this almost Burton/Ridley Scott-esquire feature film.This story is believably portrayed by all involved, and is a brilliant introduction to those with little knowledge of the Jack the Ripper story. For those of us who have had some knowledge of this time-honored walking human disease, it was a beautiful and compelling work of art. The costumes and sets were all lavishly done, and the details were beautifully attended, with a care that is rare in the industry, of late.I rate it with an 8.9/10 from... the Fiend :.",9,0,1,26 October 2003
National Treasure," Piece together the puzzle.
","Fun and fast paced adventure that lets you, the viewer, figure out the riddles.I enjoyed almost every minute of this movie. There did not appear to be a second of wasted film, nor did it leave you with the feeling that half the movie (the good half, even) was left on the cutting room floor. Honestly, Nicholas Cage has never been a favorite of mine. His movies were always good, but the content he chooses tends to bounce between comedy and dark drama. I do not like him as a comedic actor, and I am not into any kind of drama. I prefer horror itself over the imitation that is dark drama; good comedy, adventure, or action. In this attempt, he delivers a quick and quirky sense of humor which he uses to great effect in this role as a hereditary 'treasure-protector.' SPOILERSThis vehicle begins in ancient Egypt (briefly), then quickly whisks you forward to the American Revolution (again touching briefly) before bringing you to Cage's character's childhood where he first hears the family legend. We are transported once more to the here and now to find Cage's character Gates following the clues, solving the riddles, and utilizing that superior intellect. But there is treachery afoot, and Gates's partner decides he could do better on his own. The only problem with that is that the partner is the one with the money, and Gates has all the answers. This premise is based heavily on the mythology of the Freemasons and the Knights Templar. In ancient times, the Knights Templar grew so wealthy that the Catholic church became fearful of being usurped as the heaviest influence over the principal lawmakers and ordered the Templar's wealth to be distributed (of course, the Roman Catholic church took a goodly sum, themselves, to administer this distribution) among other such organizations.In modern times, the Knights Templar sit at the top of the Freemason ladder. They are the sole members who are aware of the underlying agendas of the Masons. This work touches on this knowledge but throws a seriously pro-Mason slant on the entire work. Politically speaking, this movie was more a 100-minute political plug for anyone who is in the Skull and Bones Society than it was a movie for simple entertainment. That having been said, however, this was a very fun movie. Not only was it fun, it was fast and it was VERY funny. We thoroughly enjoyed our viewing of this work. Everyone in the theater was having a blast. Here in Redneck/hillbilly Eastern Tennessee, there is not a lot of laughing or booing going on in the small home town theater. Everyone is too uptight to just relax and enjoy themselves here, for some reason. We do not have that problem, being transplants rather than 'locals,' but of course that means we have to endure the strange stares which subsequently come when Phreaks venture out into the 'str8' world during the daylight hours.Now, it is a given that this is no Indiana Jones contender, and there were not even half the elaborate sets featured in the Laura Croft movies. But as is the way of good old-fashioned mysteries, this was great fun to puzzle out. Except for that first riddle, we stayed about 30 seconds ahead of Gates in solving everything else.This was, as I said, fun, fast, witty, and extremely entertaining.It rates a 8.4/10 from...the Fiend :.",8,0,0,9 January 2005
Total Recall," Action-filled sci-fi thinker
","In my honest opinion, this is the most intellectual of Arnold Schwarzenegger's movies.The screenplay and plot lines are so well written, coherent, imaginative and complex and cohesive. The performances of these stellar actors are absolutely professional, quality and believably portrayed. PLOTWhile his wife teasingly steers him clear of his obsession, Doug Quaid is obsessed with Mars and Earth's colonization of the Red Planet. In an attempt to realize his obsession without damaging his marriage, he goes to the much-touted 'Recall,' a memory implants vacation team to have at least the memory of having been to Mars. But something goes wrong, and before they can implant the 'secret agent' portion of his mental 'vacation,' they hit a memory cap which was already installed by an anonymous governmental bureau known only as 'the agency.' He freaks and begins screaming at the techies, 'YOU BLEW MY COVER!!' END PLOTFrom that point on, the action does not stop. But this is not your typical Schwarzenegger fare. This action is underlined and surrounded by intelligence, thoughtfulness and a main plot riddled with complicated sub-plots which are cleverly written and beautifully executed. The sets are creatively designed, the scenes are wonderfully constructed, and the landscapes of Mars are pure sci-fi/effects genius. The visual effects are some of the best I've ever seen ANYwhere, and the finished product leaves you feeling more enlightened and thoroughly entertained. For these reasons I say, this is one of the best of AS's movies. It tops T1 & T2. These three, are his absolute best in the genre of sci-fi/action. A definite 'Must See,' even if you are a fan of sci-fi alone and do not really care about the Schwarzenegger element. As a PS, I would like to add that the Special Edition DVD version of this movie is much more enjoyable with advanced digital sound, remastered Widescreen visuals and a commentary with AS and the director Paul Verhoeven. There is also a behind the scenes special that shows you why this movie won the Academy Awards for special achievement in visual effects. It rates a 9.1/10 from...the Fiend :.",9,0,1,6 October 2003
Pulp Fiction," Groovin to the Movin
","This film is far from the best film of the 1990's, but it DOES feature one of John Travolta's best performances. I'm talking about his performance, not his character, or the movie surrounding it.As far as Pulp Fiction the Movie, it is stylistic, quirky, evenly balanced in its chaos, and thoroughly enjoyable. It is not the instant classic many people have proclaimed it to be, but it IS fun, witty, clever, and entertaining in its Tarantinoisms and 'hip' stylizations, and makes for an entertaining 2 hours or so.It's worth a viewing or two, and rates a 7.8/10 from...the Fiend :.",8,0,3,15 March 2007
Detroit Rock City," Coming of Age in the 1980's
","Filmed as a retrospective, this production entertains, while also teaching its audience the lessons of friendship, manhood, love, family, parenting, money management, and how to win when the chips are down.Okay, that may be a weighty summation of this light-hearted love-fest devoted to KISS, but it is also apt, if heavy-handed.The quest can be substituted by anything other than KISS tickets, and the meaning and message are still there.Otherwise, if you're not into learning anything from your entertainment, it is still entertaining. I found it quite endearing, in fact. Proof you don't have to be a teenage boy to appreciate it.It rates a 7.6/10 from...the Fiend :.",8,0,4,15 March 2007
The Da Vinci Code," Solid, faithful adaptation, which presents some beautiful portrayals, a little gritty action, and a compelling story.
","WARNING: SPOILERS AT THE BOTTOM!First off, this review is concerning the movie, not the book itself. I will begin with the casting. There has been a lot said over the past year or so since the casting list was unveiled, expressing misgivings concerning what has been called the 'miscasting' of Tom Hanks in the role as Robert Langdon. I am happy to report that earlier misgivings were completely unfounded. Tom Hanks delivers a performance reminiscent of his earlier days when he was more relaxed in his execution, and seems to have rediscovered his remarkable talents.Ian McKellen contributes a believability to his performance, which is so strong, as to make you consider (if only for a brief while) whether or not he has personal interest in the Grail. He was remarkable as Leigh Teabing, but would you really expect anything less of him? Certainly not!Audrey Tautou gave a refreshingly capable performance as Agent Sophie Neveu. She portrayed her character with a polished professionalism one might not expect from a relative newcomer to the world of American films. Of course, people who think like that are in for a rude awakening, and Audrey Tautou is just the one to give it to them.Jean Reno enacted a character which goes through some heart-felt changes. He does so with a style and grace amid the action sequences involving French Police Captain Fache in a portrayal which is reminiscent of his riveting spot lit performance as the Professional. The principle difference between the two characters, and Reno's enactment of them, is that there is much more time for character development in the Professional wherein the audience may get to 'know' the character. In the DaVinci Code, Fache's (pronounced Fash, by the way) character was one of peripheral standing and, therefore, there was very little in the way of opening character development where his character was concerned. He manages quite succinctly, however, to give you enough of the back-story of his motivations and motives to allow you a brief window into the many-faceted man who is Captain Fache. His performance was possibly one of his best, to date.And that leaves Paul Bettany. I was concerned, never having seen him portray such a complex character as Silas. I am here to apologize for my earlier misgivings. He portrayed Silas dead on. The raw (and sometimes confused and clouded) emotion he exhibited was spot on and we, the audience, found a certain reality in his portrayal. He was brilliant.And after all that, I still feel the need to say that Ron Howard was the real star of this work. His choices of camera angles, filming techniques, effects, and overall direction shine through it all in such a way as to solidly cement his name into the list of top directors. Some would argue that he was already there, and he was. But he is affirmed, confirmed, and reaffirmed as one of the best directors in the world.The work itself was an extremely faithful adaptation. It was gritty, and had us completely involved in the story, even though we were all fans of the book, and already knew what to expect. The execution of the action was shockingly realistic. I would not take children under 16 to see this, personally, and would have to think a bit before subjecting a 16-year-old to it. Silas's use of the cilice (which, according to my dictionary, is a hair-coat much like Robbie Coltrane wears while filming Harry Potter) and self flagellation is quite graphic. However, if they have seen the Passion of the Christ, then they can most definitely handle this.As far as the subject matter goes, this is neither the time, nor the place for that discussion. I will say that this work of fiction fully utilizes the potential presented by the prior historical research upon which it was based; namely, 'Holy Blood, Holy Grail.' It is a work of fiction lovingly interwoven throughout some compelling historical hypotheses presented by Michael Baigent, Richard Leigh, and Henry Lincoln in their aforementioned published historical work.The Catholic Church has issued condemnation after condemnation of this work. They should know better than to condemn a movie, by now. All it does is raise the box office sales, by piquing the interest in people who normally would have no desire to see the work. It bestowed such a high level of exposure that many people who never would have even heard of it, are now going to see it. Opus Dei has also wrongly condemned the movie for portraying them in a less than favorable light. That is not the case. It is made quite clear that Silas's mental stability is not only in question, but is doubtful. I was obviously just an opportunistic grab for their fifteen minutes of fame, than any true objection they may have had to the film at large.SPOILERSBook fans may be interested in knowing that there were four scenes omitted from the cinematic version. These scenes had no determination or bearing to the outcome of the story, and were therefore not missed...merely noticed. Namely, Sophie never puts it together that her grandmother was the woman who was with her grandfather during the rite. And she is not told (at least not in our presence) that the gap-toothed boy who attends Roslyn Chapel is her brother. You are shown the photo of the boy as a child, and you realize (if you've read the book) that it is her brother, but they never say it. The Madonna on the Rocks sequences were omitted for time. The ending is different than the novelized version, but more enjoyable.END SPOILERS!!That not withstanding, The DaVinci Code is highly enjoyable, regardless of your religious views. It is a work of FICTION, and as such, was entertainingly engrossing.It rates a 9.8/10 from...the Fiend :.",10,6,11,23 May 2006
Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone," I like it very much, but there are good reasons why I can't love it
","There were many plot changes to accommodate the adaptation of this literary work to film. But what bothered me more were the obvious comparisons to the 1986 TV movie 'The Worst Witch,' in which many of the main characters of this work seem to have appeared. Professor Snape and Professor McGonagall are obviously different sides/aspects of Diana Rigg's Hardbroom. Professor Dumbledore, an obvious male version of Miss Cackle. Harry is Mildred, and Ronald Weasley is Maud. Furthermore, Draco Malfoy can be found in the Worst Witch, in the form of Ethel Hallow. Hardbroom gives Mildred nothing but a hard time in potions class, Miss Spellbinder (Madam Hooch to the HP fans) is trying to teach the first years how to fly, and they're all getting ready for a visit from Tim Curry's Grand Wizard (the HP's Minister of Magic). And, while this group of young witches plays 'terror tag' rather than Quittich, and it is an all girl school instead of going co-ed, the obvious comparisons are still staggering.But ah, well. No one has sued, so what are we to do?Harry Potter is a young survivor of a dark crusade to silence those in opposition to an ancient evil. As a baby in his crib, he was spared by the Grace of his mother's love. Although of 'Wizarding' blood, the attack on young Harry has left him with certain gifts and abilities he otherwise would not have had. As puberty strikes, so does Hogwarts in the guise of multiple invitations to attend Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry. Harry's subsequent shopping trip to Diagon Alley is very entertaining, and rich with detail to which you otherwise would not be privy, concerning the back-story and succeeds in accomplishing character depth and setting the mood for the rest of the story.The direction by Chris Columbus is creatively wonderful. The cinematography is outstanding as great attention has been paid to detail. Details, no matter how small or inconsequential, enrich any creative work, regardless of the medium. I just hate the fact that Columbus (as Exec. Producer of this and subsequent HP films) could not find the time to read ahead through the second book to determine that there was a pumpkin patch, rocky crags, and a second room on Hagrid's hut! How much more beautiful would the PoA have been without having to stomach the sudden changes to accommodate the 'TRUE' layout of Hogwarts grounds?!) The train ride to Hogwarts introduces the main supporting characters; Ronald Weasley (Rupert Grint) and Hermione Granger (Emma Watson).As the 'first years' (new students) arrive by boat to Hogwarts Castle, the look of wonder on all their faces is absolutely believable. When I first saw this production, I was a bit full of wonder myself. Hogwarts is beautifully done, every little component of architecture and design was perpetrated with an intense caring, and great eye for detail. The acting by these young thespians is honest and genuine; truly professional performances by all involved. Let me also add here that the casting was top row. They got just the right people for just the right parts. In my opinion, there was not a single character that was mis-cast. (I absolutely detest Tom Felton's character, Draco Malfoy...his acting is brilliant, to elicit such a gut reaction towards his character.) Maggie Smith is a joy as the hard-lined Professor McGonagall. I've always loved watching her demonstrate her talents, and her performance in this production was no exception. Her character is like a roasted marshmallow...hard and tough on the outside, but with a heart that can be soft and sweet on the inside. Her treatment of young Harry demonstrates the love her character felt for his parents, now deceased; murdered in the dark crusade waged by Voldemort, one of the darkest wizards ever produced by the House of Slytherin (one of the four Houses at Hogwarts), and his many followers. Emma Watson positively shines as Hermione Granger. Her performance is quite believable and lends so MUCH to the movie. Her character was one of my favorites from the book, and her personification lives up to my every expectation. She plays the well-(self-) educated neophyte Witchling VERY well. I cannot wait to see where life leads her in the future. Robbie Coltrain's character; however, was my favorite among the teachers. Rubius Hagrid, who says repeatedly, 'I shouldn't have said that,' has a heart of pure gold, and the demeanor of a true gentle giant. No one could've portrayed Hagrid, like Robbie Coltrain. The scenery and mountain footage shot and shown in abundance is absolutely breath-taking, the direction giving this effort the professional quality for which I had hoped it would possess. The effects were stunningly clever and extremely well perpetrated, brilliantly demonstrating Rowling's extraordinary imagination and creativity, and perpetuating the magic of her original literary work. I was pleased with this movie; though not as pleased as I was in reading the book.Jim Henson's Creature Shop did a marvelous job with the 'monsters' in this movie. Better than I would have expected from Brian (Jim's son) when you compare his 'Muppets From Space' to the earlier Muppet films done by his dad. Impressive work on Fluffy and Norbert, Brian. Jolly good show! 'There is no good and evil. There is only power, and those too weak to seek it.' Voldemort. The ending is both satisfying and heartwarming. I truly enjoyed this movie, its characters and its message: you can succeed, no matter your beginnings or misgivings about yourself. However, while it did not fail utterly in capturing the atmosphere and overall 'feeling' of the spirit of the first book, it did fall short.This effort earns a large 7.2/10 from...the Fiend :.",7,2,4,22 September 2003
Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire," Beautiful, But Disappointing.
","There was a lot of debate at the beginning of this project concerning the options of making this two separate films, going long (there was talk of a 3-hour film), or just trying to lump it all into one feature-length film and be done with it. I must say, I was hoping for 2 separate films. I don't think I would have minded that sacrifice just to have a comprehensive chapter of this saga.But before I start, let me say that all three main actors, Radcliffe, Watson, and Grint, have grown exponentially in their talents!There were many things left out, nuances from the novel which went unused, and whole ideas/parts of the original literary work which were entirely ignored.SPOILERS!! Fleur was not nearly as saucy as the novel portrayed her. There was no giant spider in the labyrinth. Neither was there a sphynx; a creature I was highly anticipating, by the way. After seeing the treatment of the hippogryph Buckbeak in the PoA, I was certain the sphynx would be completely AWESOME. No sphynx/sphinx. And also absent was Hermione's campaign against the abuse of house-elves known as 'SPEW.' And, I must add that I was a bit...disturbed by the wardrobe choice for the Death Eaters. They were dressed as KKK members, but in dark robes instead of white. I realize this style of dress far predates the Klan, but in this day and age, it's the first thing to be brought to mind by that headgear. Perhaps this is just an American phenomenon? Are the KKK not world-wide? Or was this intentionally done to demonstrate to the children that these are evil men?I thoroughly enjoyed Gambon's interpretation of Albus Dumbledore this time around. He put more of himself into the part, and stopped attempting to 'do' Richard Harris's Dumbledore. While it's NOT the Dumbledore from Rowling's work, I've come to admire his attempt in GoF. Whether by natural aging or a decent dye job, Radcliffe's hair is darker in this installment, but oddly enough his eyes seemed to change from blue to green, off and on again, throughout the movie. Radcliffe's acting is maturing with him, but crying on demand seems nigh impossible for the lad. It could be that he's led such a sheltered and/or protected life that he's nothing upon which to draw that instantaneous grief many actors use to perform this task.Fred (James) and George (Oliver Phelps) Weasley were suitably brought forward, marking their positioning for Movie 5 (OotP). Although Harry failed to hand over the gold coins won in the Tri-Wizard Tournament to the lads to begin their business, I'm sure the next director will make do with what set up was left for him, and find some way to incorporate that into the next installment. It's a necessary detail, in My opinion, which was totally left out of this chapter. It's needed, in order to maintain the continuous storyline between the cinematic attempts. Without that detail, there leaves a long, empty path which will remain untrodden in upcoming theatrical events. That would be highly disappointing.We're shown for the first time how Neville reacts to the Unforgivable Curses, but not told why, as is appropriate. You don't learn until Book 6 (HBP) exactly WHY his reaction to Mad-Eye Moody's demonstration, was so strong.Emma Watson (Hermione) was completely ready for this particular treatment. She was beautiful. Quite lovely and all grown up. I know her father must have felt SO proud to see her looking so lady-like, and without showing even the slightest hint of too much skin.The best scene? For Me, it's a toss-up between Draco-the-white-ferret being tossed about by Mad-Eye Moody and Harry's scenes with the Horntail. A CNN reviewer stated that this film 'tries to do too much.' Well, in my opinion, it didn't TRY, it succeeded! It started off well, ran well, and ended well. There was not one moment of wasted film. Not one bad cut, not one lost second. From start to finish, there was meat and potatoes, but that's not all it gives its viewers. There are lovely bits of wonderful pastries and a fine dessert as well.Aside from what was mentioned above, GoF was everything for which I had hoped. As promised, the dragons were superb!!! I would have loved to have laid eyes on the Chinese Fireball, but if you really want to see what it looks like check out The Noble Collection, where you can also purchase a sterling silver Time Turner!!The performances were beautifully directed, the cast was perfectly chosen, and the only complaint I had whatsoever concerning the performance executions was that of Fleur. Clemence Posey was the perfect actress for that part, but for some reason, Mike Newell traded in her sexuality and self-possession for a 'girl-next-door' persona. I don't know why he felt the need to alter that character in such a drastic way, but it just did not achieve what he meant to achieve unless that was to rewrite a whole new personality for one of the principle characters in this chapter.But for book lovers everywhere, take heart. The story IS here. While some of the details were left off due to time constraints, and some of the lines were moved around due to contractual obligations, the meat of the story (and there IS a LOT of story here) remains completely intact.The flying horses are so realistically layered, textured, executed, and presented! I couldn't take my eyes off of them! They were magnificent!I can't WAIT to own this on DVD!It rates an 8.7/10 and is, by far, the best HP movie to date.Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire Budget: $140M Opening 2-Day Weekend Box Office Ticket Sales: $101M Not bad, you guys. Not bad!",9,1,1,24 February 2006
A Beautiful Mind," Total Garbage!
","This is another hit for Bettany, and another dialed-in crapfest from Crowe. I do NOT GET the adulation awarded this film by critics. The screenwriters have completely bastardized a better story.Just for the sake of correctness, Nash didn't invent game theory as this work attempts to claim. He came up with a notion of equilibrium, which is simply brilliant and he more than deserves the Nobel. But Crowe does NOT. This was supposed to be a historical film, but due to Crowe's lackluster performance, backed up by his aggressive contractual negotiations, his character has been given credit for things he did not do! In a learned person's opinion, this is an irresponsible, and disgraceful film mainly due to Crowe's contractual screen time, which necessitated giving his character credit for things he should not have been portrayed as having done, and his totally crappy, dialed in performance.This was a typical Hollywood whitewash of the truth, and a typical Hollywood performance by Crowe. When will they just STOP handing this untalented hack roles like this?! It rates a 0.6/10 from...the Fiend :.",1,6,13,31 May 2007
Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets," Plodding but wonderful
","Don't you just HAAATE the Dursley's?!!After the outrageous neglect exhibited by the Dursleys in the first 'Harry Potter' movie, I thought it simply could not get any worse. But Dudley''s character, portrayed extremely well by Harry Melling, is more atrocious and hate-inspiring than ever.Dobby was a most endearing, if rather buggering, addition to the cast of characters this time around. We thoroughly enjoyed the 'Dobby effects' perpetrated by the CGI technicians. His character, while wholly non-human, was quite sincere and entertaining.I don't have the problems with CGI in the movie industry with which many seem to suffer...I see that some parts cannot be portrayed by human actors; therefore CGI enriches this final product in such a way that the lack of CGI actually would create a total loss of effect in the movie.This year is Ginny Weasley's first year and she has the crush of her young lifetime on Harry Potter.'She's been talking about you all summer. Rather annoying, really.' Ronald Weasley to Harry Potter.This time, Harry and Ron can't seem to get to the platform for Hogwarts Express, and time is quickly wasting. If they are late for the opening ceremony, it is entirely possible they will not be allowed to attend Howarts this year. What to do? What to do? Good thing for Harry that Mr. Weasley is a tinkerer, or Harry and Ron would be in a world of trouble. But wait...it seems their only way to school is the flying car created by Ron's dad. And when they get to the castle grounds, they discover they ARE in trouble. Big trouble.This movie is just as entertaining and well done as the first. Again directed by Chris Columbus (who STILL neglected to do his homework and put that pumpkin patch and such where they needed to be), the screenplay done as a joint collaboration between Rowlings and Steven Kloves as in the first, and the same, lovable (and hate-able) actors in our favorite 'Worst Witch' reincarnations.As sequels go, this production is quite wonderful; though not quite as excellent a sequel as was the original literary work. While there were as many changes in dialog and such, it is quite well adapted and extremely well perpetrated, although it does lose a bit in the process.There are secret whispers (unheard by all but Harry himself), mysterious magical books and a conjured beast of Dragonkind!This is a wonderful story, not just the piece of commercial sequellistic fluff I expected. More secrets of Harry Potter's mysterious past are revealed and you get a good rumination of the back story.The addition of some of new teachers was a wonderful step and as in the first, Rowlings creations are applied to this production with an inspired intelligence and creativity that it seems as though she, herself, is of magic. Absolutely wonderful.The message that prejudice is horrid comes through loud and clear in Malfoy's treatment Hermione. It made me want to tie his ears together and hang him up by the other end. While hatred itself is wrong, if you must hate someone, hate them for WHO they are (their personality and the choices they make), not for WHAT they are (their lineage, bloodline, race, or religion).Only when the heir of Slytherin house has returned to Hogwarts can the Chamber of Secrets be reopened and the evil within set loose.I was happy to see the inclusion of Dumbledore's Phoenix, Fawkes. We did not get enough of him in the first movie. I enjoyed this movie just as much as the first. This is awesome as a sequel, but it can also stand alone. It does not rely upon the first installment, yet does not repeat the same information we learned in the first. While it was as faithful as it could be, it (as did the first) failed to capture the atmospheric darkness and overall feeling of the novel. It was almost as if the faithfulness was more important than the ambiance, which is a common mistake made in this industry.I must also add that the trio has shown some great improvement over their initial forays (not that they needed it). It gets a 7/10 from...the Fiend :.",7,2,3,22 September 2003
Psycho," Much More a Psychological Thriller Than A Horror
","This is considered, and rightfully so, the grandfather of all slashers. It IS that. Period. Nothing I say hereafter is designed to lessen that fact.Psycho is a study of the higher end of the schizophrenic mind, when coupled with some of the more extreme examples of the Oedipus complex. In this example, Norman BECOMES his deceased mother; a mother he killed for bringing confliction and sexual repression into his psyche. Her addition of a new boyfriend into the already sexually muddled situation, added just enough aggression to the mix that it culminated in the murder of both the mother AND the boyfriend, leaving Norman to figure out his own place in the world.Once Norman decided that his mother was still alive and still instructing him in how to behave in life, dictating his actions, and deciding his fate by committing heinous acts of her own, Norman then adapted himself to fit his mother's teachings and instructions. He thereby molded himself into a serial killer who not only could, but required, the close intimate act of knife work, as that was the only intimacy he was allowed.And then once he killed, the confliction sets in. Everything is meticulously cleaned up, intimately inventoried, and utterly hidden. The crime scene is lovingly restored to its virginal state, and Normal resumes his otherwise lackluster life.As a movie, this is a masterpiece no matter what others would say. The pure psychology of the antagonist is case and study for countless students over the nearly fifty years since this hit the big screen. Hitchcock demonstrates a total understanding of the psychopathic mind, and translates that understanding brilliantly to the silver screen.His choice of Bosco (chocolate syrup) to serve as the blood in the shower scene shows a deeper understanding of the necessary visual dynamics required to propel this into the annals of 'classic,' regardless of what some naysayers would opine. Psycho IS a classic. It is a classic among Hitchcock's works, among the horror genre, the psychological thriller genre, and among the slasher sub-genre.No matter how old this is, it still generates a lovely suspense, and stands tall when compared to modern films of the same genre(s).All in all, this is a great watch, even for a Friday or Saturday night.It rates a 9.4/10 from...the Fiend :.",9,0,0,28 December 2008
Hercules," Jerkules
","Since Aladin and Atlantis, this has to be the best Disney animated feature length film in the vaults.They strayed far from the Hercules story and mythos, but that did nothing to detract from the beauty and wit of this work. I find it wholly enjoyable, endearing, and witty.

30 Days of Night," Lives Up To The Trailer
","I must admit that I have become a bit bored with the latest rash of Vampyre/Vampyrical cinematic attempts. I loved Underworld, but Underworld 2 led us somewhere so totally off the beaten path of the original, it left me cold. If you go all the way back to John Carpenter's Vampires, you'll delve right into some great Vampyre elements of the mythos, and some really creative innovations.There have been good-to-great Vampyre movies since, strewn here and there. But the idea of having only 30 days to feed, each year ... ? THAT is a cool idea. But it's not new. Jeepers Creepers comes to mind ... every 29 years, they get to feed for 29 days. And yet, this film was highly enjoyable.Action, suspense, tense (almost palpable) atmosphere, and believe it or not, believable performances by the cast! Hartnett surprises, but (unfortunately) part of his surprise is that he is the sheriff of this small Alaskan town. I do not know about anyone else, but I seem to have problems believing it. He gave an honest, realistic performance, but I could not buy him as the sheriff. I think it has more to do with his age and memories of him in other parts, than it does with his performance. As I said, his performance is believable ... more so than in anything else in which I have ever seen him, and that is a fact.The execution of the elements was classic. I will refrain from detailing any particular element, as I hate to read a review that spoils everything in a movie, so I rarely write them.I WILL, however, say that there were a few things with which I had a problem. Those things are enumerated below, so proceed at your own risk. They aren't spoilers outright, but a few could be POTENTIAL SPOILERS for someone who doesn't want ANYthing revealed.As I've said, Josh Hartnett did not fit in as the sheriff. I could have much more easily accepted him as a deputy than as the actual sheriff.He always looked too clean to meet the circumstances. They did give him a bit of grime, but nowhere near the amount of gore and dirt one would reasonably expect, under the circumstances.The Vampyres were so visceral. I personally prefer the more romanticized versions, though I could buy into the premise that 1500 years of evolution could/would cause such an animalization of these Beings.The filming during the kills is too 'busy.' The camera moves and the editing is so fast as to make you wonder if the camera man was having some sort of seizure during filming? The overall affect was to make me dizzy, without adding anything of substance to the film, itself. NOTE TO DIRECTORS: Slow it down and give us the graphic sequences you are too afraid to film! At least film alternate 'kills' for the 'Unrated Director's Cuts' if you MUST omit it for the PG-13 kiddies! But this was an 'R' and THIS was the best you could deliver?!The town itself had a 'canned' feeling, like they filmed this thing on the back lot of some studio, or in a large stadium somewhere. The feeling of isolation is necessary, true enough, but the sense that this was constructed and executed at a location secondary to the place to which we were first introduced, should give one pause. If Sam Raimi could make a mistake like that, no one is infallible.The use of the Infernal Promise, without going into the lore, or the mystery of the Infernal Promise, failed to please. (More on the IP in the next section.) I DID like that they included the Infernal Promise at all. It is used throughout the Vampyre genre with some great effect, but it was never better used than herein. The use of the IP also generated a secondary element I found delightful; that of the Stranger.The Stranger brought with it the sense of foreboding, sealed and personified. It engendered a betrayal on a level to which the average man needs to believe other men are not capable. From his introduction, the viewer knows there is something amiss on the pristine snow-strewn horizon.The use of the weather as a means of confounding the Vampyres' superior scenting abilities (done so subtly, as to negate this as a spoiler), and their method of covering the whole thing up, are both quite ingenious.All in all? I really enjoyed this superior work of thriller/suspense. It is a definite Friday/Saturday night movie, and belongs on the shelves of anyone who enjoys a good Vampyre movie. I categorize this as a thriller/suspense, as the kills are not as graphic as I expected, the blood (while there, laws yes!) is not as prolific as I anticipated, and the gore is at a bare minimum. I'd actually pay to see this again.It rates a 7.8/10 from...the Fiend :.",8,36,70,14 November 2007
Ice Age," Awesomely Sweet and Highly Enjoyable.
","Sweet. Now that's not a word I like to use, but it's THE word for Ice Age. The characters are cagey saber tooth lions, a sloth with a speech impediment, a curmudgeonly mammoth, and a human baby. See? It's already sweet.And it just gets cuter and sweeter, more zany, and absolutely FUN from there on out. There are some tense moments, so parents may wish to prescreen before allowing younger children to view it.This was easily the best animation of 2007, and is still highly enjoyable today.It rates an 8.4/10 from...the Fiend :.",8,0,0,24 March 2007
Scream 2," Wes Craven Does It Again! Only BETTER!!!
","The movie 'Stab' has just been released. Based on the actual events in Woodsboro, and the national best-selling book by Gail Weathers, the publicity and following of the movie are astounding. The movie-goers don the the costume distributed by the studio, and everyone looks like the killer. When a movie-goer is killed, no one knows who the actual killer is, as they are all dressed alike. Back with the original cast (YAY!), director (BIGGER YAY!), and complete with the same respect given to other horror films of our time, this movie even surpasses the original. The edge was still there, the suspense was brilliantly recaptured and the humor was dark and witty; clever and intelligent. All the successful key elements were present from the first installment of this series: the acknowledgment by the characters that they are still in a horror movie; the use and discussion of other real movies thereby perpetuating the homage factor of thees movies; and the well developed, believable, lovable characters.'You think someone is trying to make a real-life sequel?' dramaprofessor.PLOT: The killings have begun again. With the arrest(s) made in Woodsboro from the last rash of tragedies, everyone thought it was over. But Sidney's life just is not built that way. 'To think this fuss is all because of you. I mean, not directly, but in some 'Six-Degrees-of-Kevin-Bacon' way.'With the return of Gail Weathers and Dewey Riley, it hits both Sidney and Randy that this is really happening, again. 'Wow. Nothing like a funeral to bring the family together.' Randy.At the release of Cotton Weary from prison, Sidney is confronted with him face-to-face without warning or preparation. Needless to say, it doesn't go very well, and leaves Cotton standing there with his face hanging out, still waiting for his '10 minutes of fame.'Meanwhile, Gail's book has defamed Dewey and he is none too happy about it. His pride is wounded and he has an axe to grind; primarily over Gail's head. His role is expanded and he gets far more screen time in this installment, which I found refreshing and his character to be delightful.As hard as it is to make a good sequel, incredibly Wes Craven manages to surpass the original and manages to truly SCARE us without being repetitive, redundant, predictable or boring. Amazingly well done, highly entertaining and a classic in the genre of horror.The suspense element is never cheapened, the element of surprise is always present and the performances by all involved is completely professional, believable and creatively presented.This production has well earned its reputation as a masterpiece in the horror field.The first installment of this series got an 8.89/10. This one rates a 9.42/10 from...the Fiend :.",9,0,0,2 October 2003
Anchorman: The Legend of Ron Burgundy," So Terrible I Have To Like It.
","Farrell is an intelligent man, most gifted comedians are. Now, I'm not saying he's Robin Williams, but he is talented. But with one mediocre movie after another, we SNL/Farrell fans were wondering what was going on. How could he be so good on SNL and die on screen so badly? It seems the key was the screenplay. He needs a specific vehicle line in order to demonstrate his talents. Maybe it was the supporting cast. Maybe it was the combination of writing and the casting. I'm not sure exactly what that formula consists of, but Achorman has obviously nailed it. This is one funny movie, but if you're not a Baby Boomer, it might lie flat on the screen for you.It rates an 8.1/10 from...the Fiend :.",8,1,3,22 March 2007
Stranger Than Fiction," At Last! Will Farrell Has Found His Niche!
","Will Farrell is a talented actor, in my opinion. After a decade of meaningless, inane, and even stupid roles, he has finally found a proper vehicle by which to showcase his talents ... Stranger than Fiction is a beautifully blended, well-adapted chronicle of the life of a hapless victim-cum-quintessential hero.It has often been said that we all (humans) carry within us the traits to be a hero in times of darkness, via the character Harold Crick, this is demonstrated with a great style and panache. The plot is wonderful and the narration by Emma Thompson is inspired. This will touch your heart without leading you down the smarmy path of melancholy.It seems Mr. Farrell has gone the way of Steve Martin in that this time he chose the role of the 'straight man' (to use comedic vernacular) in a rather intelligent romantic comedy, and to let the story carry the comedy rather than his antics, pratfalls, and the like.While this is not your typical Will Farrell comedy, I sincerely (and without hesitation) hope to see him in more roles such as this one. He came off as thoughtful, intelligent, and sincere in his performance. I always knew Will had talent. I'm just glad the rest of the world got to see it...finally.All in all? This was great!

The Green Mile," A 'Shining' Example of What CAN be Done With a Stephen King Novel!!
","Unlike the unfortunate Made for TV version of Stephen King's 'The Shining,' the Green Mile really holds its own. Tom Hanks delivers a stellar performance, as we have come to expect nothing else from him. Michael Clarke Duncan, however, is the bright and shining star in this movie. He really steals your heart as John Coffey, a death row inmate with extraordinary powers and a heart to match.It is a bit reminiscent of the Shawshank Redemption (also done by the same director, go figure) in that it too is set in a prison, but the genuine depth of the characters is what completely delivers this movie.This movie just goes to show you that good movies CAN be made from Stephen King's marvelous literary works, after all.Loved the book. Love the movie.It gets a solid 8.8/10 from...the Fiend :.",9,1,3,28 August 2003
Jaws," Above Par Creature Feature
","Jaws is legendary, as the epitome of classic-modern horror. It is so wildly popular, as to have thoroughly permeated into the heart of American pop-culture. And while it wasn't his first, it was certainly Steven Spielberg's first large budget, and his first hit, propelling his career into the mega-success he is today...and with good reason.This work captured the fear of every movie goer for a decade. The atmosphere generated herein is downright Hitchcockian in essence, while the story is compellingly dead on for how a small business-minded town would handle this situation. The dialog is superb, and the performances are above par for this type of movie.This work went a long way towards re-legitimizing the horror genre among the average movie-goer and critics, alike.Although it IS a bit dated now, it still ranks up there in the highest echelon of creature features, right alongside Alien, Predator, and the old Universal Horrors.It rates a 9.4/10 from...the Fiend :.",9,0,1,23 March 2007
Dark Shadows," Almost Never Saw This
","I saw the trailers for this film, and sadly did not see it in the theater. I couldn't imagine WHAT Tim Burton was doing, but this was most certainly NOT 'my' Dark Shadows. The trailer made the film seem trivial and preposterous; a complete farce. Whomever was in charge of that trailer needs to be disposed of in a most visceral way.The actual FILM is quite fetching. Depp is a star in this role as in most. His recreation of Frid's original character is startling, while maintaining a continuity between the two renditions. The problem with the original soap opera is that it took itself WAY too seriously. It tried to scare us green, and it really DID entertain...while accidentally making us laugh from time to time. This film is fun and really took me back...in a good way. The comedy is campy and intended, where the original series had no intention ever of making one laugh, though it often did. The character development is sufficient without boring the audience into a long nap, and plot execution goes off seemingly without a hitch.Continuity has a few holes, but this was done for fun and in fun...so who cares about continuity? I didn't. I was entertained. That's what film-making is all about. And, if it makes money, that's a bonus. LOLOn a more personal note, I genuinely hope they make another. I know the plates of all the principals are full, but would still very much like to see a run of these. A plethora, if you will.Dark Shadows ala Tim Burton rates an 8.4/10 from....: the Fiend :.",8,1,3,15 October 2012
Kingpin," Not Much Of Anything, And Too Arrogant In What It Is.
","Woody Harrelson and Randy Quaid are tragically funny in this vehicle wherein a washed up, one-handed participant of the national bowling circuit recruits an Amish farm-boy nobody to help him pull various scams to get to a bowling tournament in Reno with a million dollar payoff, all unbeknownst to the Amish nobody.Harrelson is the star, with Bill Murray taking the part of his competitional nemesis. Harrelson actually surprised me with his performance herein. I do not know what I expected really, but his performance surpassed those unknown expectations. Randy Quaid is so not Amish that it was amusing watching him as a man who is not Amish, trying to pretend to be Amish, convincingly, and not. But he did not mean to be convincing. It's merely the tenor of his performance which makes you half buy into his Amishness (if you can dig it).The weakest element here was Bill Murray. I hate to say that, as I have been a fan for thirty years, or so, but he is not nearly as great as his ego makes him believe, and his arrogance in this vehicle lost its humor when the character's megalomania too closely approached his own, thereby rendering the character a non-character in my book, and negating his performance as a performance.All in all, this is amusing, but not highly so, and is seriously overrated by the users here at IMDb. 'The greatest comedy of the 90's' it isn't! It rates a 4.4/10 from...the Fiend :.",4,1,5,13 May 2007
Hitch," Totally Fun
","Will Smith is perfectly endearing as the 'Relationship Doctor,' here to heal all your relationship woes.I expected this to be a standard RomCom with little to amuse. I'm happy to report that I was wrong. Will Smith is delightful and unexpectedly 'fresh' in this Andy Tennant vehicle. Surrounded by a great supporting cast, an interesting story, and fed with witty dialog, I was thoroughly engaged.We found this one cute, quirky, and inspirational without being preachy.It rates a 7.4/10 from...the Fiend :.",7,0,0,18 March 2007
Star Wars: Episode III - Revenge of the Sith," Redemption.
","Hayden Christensen surpasses my early predictions surrounding the caliber of his expected performance. His performance wasn't the 'stuff of legends,' but, and face it, folks, that's exactly what it will become; however inferior. He DID; however, deliver JUST ENOUGH to pull this off.The story was what was expected, but the story telling itself was greatly contrived. I couldn't wholly buy what Luca$ was selling in this work. The reasons behind the transformation did not ring true, nor did it feel right. Skywalker must have been a seriously weak person to have turned to 'The Dark Side' that easily. Palpatine's seduction of Skywalker (what with his being a 'virgin birth' and all) was just a little too shallow for this Star Wars fan. Ani was Palpatine's puppet rather than the headstrong but capable child he was just a few short years ago. It seemed to me that Skywalker was portrayed as much stronger in his early youth than he was as a Jedi and at the peak of his power.SPOILERS FROM HERE ON OUT!!! Palpatine's face was disfigured during his battle with Mace Windu in order to make it match the wizened old troll we knew only as 'the Emperor' in 4, 5, & 6.Princess Leia, when remembering her mother in Episode V, speaks of her as being beautiful and very sad. We have always wondered how that was possible, and now we know she was speaking of Bail Organa's wife as her mother.Anakin Skywalker was a short little thing to properly and believably portray Darth Vader. I mean, let's face it...Vader was 6' 7' tall, while Christensen has only just made it to 6' 1'. We now know that he was extensively rebuilt by Emperor Palpatine, including metal extensions for both lower legs. *eye rolls*We now also understand R2D2's total dedication to Obi Wan and the Rebellion, more clearly.The Millennium Falcon is visible as Obi Wan and Anakin are just landing outside the Jedi Temple at the beginning of the movie. It can be seen in the lower right of the screen.The TIE Fighters are introduced here in their first incarnation.Padmé's body was made to appear still pregnant for her funeral in order to deceive those on the Dark Side into believing the babies had died with her. This action would prevent Vader from seeking out his child/ren.Obi Wan knew how to project himself to Luke and Yoda from beyond the grave due to Yoda asking Qui-Gon Jinn to return and teach Obi Wan the secret higher Jedi arts.* But all in all, and I'm not speaking for everyone here, as a Fan, I really hoped for more. I did not EXPECT more, but I dared hope for it.We got Chewbacca YAY!, but we got him for a second.We got Wookie soldiers and a Wookie battle, but not the huge effectstravaganza-filled Wookie War we were promised.We got Yoda in battle, but this time he looked more like a spider monkey on crack than ever before.We see Anakin changing into Vader, but the reasons were just stupid.We got Padme in childbirth, but she delivered 3 month old at least babies! Those were SO NOT newborns! C3P0 is full gold. His silver right front bottom leg piece is gold in this Episode. I'm sure that will be rectified with the DVD release.Also, no attempt is made to explain Obi Wan's aging 30 years in the 20 years it took Luke to take us to meet back up with him.Further, it takes no notice that Leia appears 10 years older than Luke in Episodes 4, 5, & 6. I'll also assume that this work was meant to indicate that Wookies live for an extraordinarily long period of time, as no attempt was made to make Chewbacca appear any younger than he did in Episodes 4, 5, & 6.The volcano planet where Vader literally becomes Vader and is confronted by Obi Wan was very reminiscent of Mordor. That whole scene bore some interesting parallels: Obi Wan was betrayed by someone he thought would help the Jedi cause, they fight, one is destroyed by fire while reveling in his moment, one way or the other, and both heroes in both situations were accompanied by trusted loved ones who could not help then in their moment of need. One had a magickal ring, the other had a wedding ring.I was happy, I must say, to see that there were no nipples on Bail Organa's Batman armor and that they chose to show the annihilation of the younglings on camera, rather than off. It made for a much more poignant moment that way.The crop circles in fire on the planet's surface in the opening scenes and shots were amusing to me in that they were so prominent yet placed in the background so as to attract the subliminal mind to think, 'Oh yeah, this is an alien space-scape, alright.' And R2D2 has some new tricks! He can jump, shoot laser fire, squirt out an oil slick, and he now has turbo fire rockets on the bottoms of his rolling casters. He can also laugh. (Check out the scene where Bail Organa orders C3P0's mind to be wiped!) For now, Star Wars, Episode III: Revenge of the Sith rates an 8.6/10.the Fiend :.",9,3,6,18 March 2007
Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs," Timeless? Classic.
","While this work is incredible and does still stand up to scrutiny (especially with the upcoming digital transfer DVD release from Disney), I can't say that it's timeless. In viewing, it is very much a retrospect, considering the setting, scene, backgrounds, costumes, etc. Does that lessen the effectiveness of this work? Absolutely not. This is NOT one of those Disney classics, which would benefit from a remake!Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs definitely belongs in your Disney collection, is suitable for all ages, and has some of the most endearing characters of any Disney movie, ever, while featuring some of the best animation in Disney's repertoire.This also features one of the best villains in the Disneyverse! This is my absolute favorite Disney Animated Classic.It rates a 9.9/10 from...the Fiend :.",10,2,2,18 March 2007
The Lion King," Instant Disney Classic
","Gods I love this movie!The soundtrack is exemplary as is every element of this beautiful Disney masterpiece.The Baboon, affectionately dubbed 'Bruce-Monkey' after Bruce Lee, is a scream! Jeremy Irons' voice as Scar is absolutely Shakesperean in its darkling malevolence. James Earl Jones's voice is a perfect Mufassa; it's commanding and brooding, just as it should be, turning playful when the mood arises. The graphics and artistry are some of the best ever produced by Disney, in this Fiend's opinion, and the eclectic spirituality of the movie; the circle of life, the wheel of the year, birth and rebirth, are moving and inspiring.As with all Disney movies, the movie has a message: make responsible choices and be responsible for the choices you make.I highly recommend the 2-disk Special Edition with added footage and an entire disk of extras.It gets a solid 9/10 from...the Fiend :.",9,3,4,1 September 2003
The Waterboy," Endearing, But Inferior
","This is NOT Adam Sandler's best work. Frankly, he has grown exponentially as an actor, as his later performances are far superior to this work. However, some of these older works also have a draw as entertainment, if not quality.This is based on Sandler's 'Cajun Man' SNL skit, but the character is developed enough to allow you to decide for yourself if you will allow this work to endear itself to you, or not. At least Rob Schneider has a bit part in this one.The story is not unique, but it is cute. Actually, 'cute' is about the best word to describe this film. It's not anything more than that. If you're a Sandler fan, you don't want to miss this, but if you're not, you may want to give it a pass. Try Sandler's remake of The Longest Yard, instead.It rates a 4.8/10 from...the Fiend :.",5,2,5,21 April 2007
The Cannonball Run," Like Smokey and the Bandit, But With Cars...And It May Be A Tad More Enjoyable Today
","This really is like Smokey and the Bandit in that there is a deadline, a great race, and an all-star cast, which makes this work like an unintentional (?) remake of 'It's a Mad, Mad, Mad, Mad World.' This was my very first glimpse of Jackie Chan on the big screen, too, as it was for many Americans.This flick stars Burt Reynolds, Roger Moore, Farrah Fawcett, Dom DeLuise, Dean Martin, Sammy Davis Jr., Jack Elam, Adrienne Barbeau, Terry Bradshaw, Jackie Chan, Bert Convy, Jamie Farr, Peter Fonda, and dozens more! The only one missing from this work was Sally Field, and she WAS sorely missed.This has been held in chronological remake order as 2 of 3 in the set; the set being 'It's a Mad, Mad, Mad, Mad World' , 'Cannonball Run' , and 'Rat Race,' but in the #3 spot in terms of popularity. Unbelievably, Rat Race is a tad better rated.This is still one of my favorites from the early 1980's, and as such, it rates a 7.3/10 from...the Fiend :.",7,0,0,20 May 2007
Scream," Above average for the slasher sub-genre
","This is NOT your average, mindless slasher flick. Scream: a real psychological breakthrough in the genre of slasher movies.This movie demonstrates a most excellent advancement in the genre of slasher flicks. Let me begin by saying this is NOT a flick; a flick being a fluffy little piece of nothing designed to make money and nothing more, OR a movie which is so low budget (or the acting is so bad) that it can't do anything but make you laugh, regardless of the subject matter. This is a quality production. The direction was wonderful and the acting was believable. The key to this movie, in my opinion, is three-fold.(1) The characters seem to realize they are in a horror movie. They quote movies, site movies and refer to movies all throughout the dialog. This, to me, adds to this production, and establishes it as an homage to the horror genre in general. This is a serious parody; not meant to be amusing, but rather, thought-provoking. Randy points out to his friends (and the audience) all the basic rules of surviving a horror movie, as if he knows the now-famous quote by John Lennon that 'Nothing is Real.'Randy's rules for Surviving a Horror Movie.1. You can never have sex.2. You can neither drink nor do drugs. It's a sin; an extension of Rule #1.3. Never EVER under any circumstances say, 'I'll be right back,' because you won't be back. You'll be dead.(2) The citing of actual movies and events by the characters lends a total reality to this production that lacks in others where they actually make UP movies to site and critique rather than being bold enough to work real movies into the script. ('You can only hear that Richard Gere/gerbil story so many times before you start to believe it.' Tatum) Perhaps they are afraid of being accused of endorsing certain movies, while slighting other directors'/actors' work.Regardless of the reasoning behind it, this movie grabs the bull by the horns and makes you believe the characters are real. You have the uncanny feeling that you are watching actual live footage of these people, rather than characters on a screen, that's how realistically these characters are portrayed.(3) The characters are SENTIENT. They realize there are consequences. They aren't mindless victims/killers. In a very poignant scene, the killer asks of the victim, 'Did you really call the police? My mom and dad are gonna be so mad at me!' in a tear-filled, pathetically whiny voice. It lends to the scene a certain reality that it would have otherwise lacked. The whole movie is blessed with these 'reality checks,' helping to make it more and more believable.Neve Campbell is completely believable; her character (Sidney Prescott) seems real and is so beautifully portrayed by Ms. Campbell that she has fully established her gift as a thespian. I do sincerely hope that she is not type-cast in horror movies for the duration of her career. Her talents could well be used in any leading role, in any genre. Her list of credits is already quite impressive, all things considered.Her character is not one of those horror movie heroines who falls down while running from the killer, who can't keep her head straight in a real crisis, or who proves inept and incapable of fending off an attacker. Her character is brave, and strong, and capable. I LOVE that!!The character development was so rich and deep, further lending credibility and reality to this production. Above the feeling of watching live footage, you feel as if you personally know the characters and care about what happens to them. This is key in ANY good movie.Henry Winkler was amazing in his role as the principal of Woodsboro high school. This is the first serious role in which I have admired his abilities. I hope it is not the last. He demonstrated a quality in this movie that I have never before seen in his performances. Even Wes Craven makes an appearance as 'Fred the Janitor' in Winkler's most poignant scenes.As this story unfolds, you will be blown away. This is one of the best movies of the genre of 'slasher,' and also rates with 'The Game,' 'Fallen,' 'Psycho,' and a much later movie, 'Identity,' in the psychological thriller Hall of Fame.A most excellent movie; totally awe-inspiring soundtrack that works with the movie SO WELL. It is endearing to see a director take so much care with every little detail of a work; so much so that this is a true work of art. It is believable, watchable (if from behind a pillow, your half-closed hands, or your knees), and downright SCARY. Truly, I find those movies which tap into the category of 'that which could actually happen' to be the scariest. This is definitely one of those movies. I have the whole trilogy right next to 'Halloween,' 'Halloween 2,' and 'Halloween H20' in my collection. I honestly think this movie tops 'Halloween,' if only by a small bit.The twists are so amazing they will leave you sitting there with your mouth wide open.It gets a full 8.89/10 from...the Fiend :.",9,0,0,2 October 2003
Halloween," Top Row Suspense.
","Introducing Jamie Lee Curtis as Laurie Strode. Wonderful. One of the best suspense/slasher flix ever made.Jamie Lee Curtis, daughter of veteran actress Janet Leigh and actor Tony Curtis (Bernard Schwartz), was a twenty-year old, unseasoned actress with only a two episodes of Operation Petticoat and a bit part in a 'Colombo' movie under her belt when she was cast in this, her first leading role. (As usual, 20 year olds playing high schoolers) While her acting is still a trifle fresh, she convincingly portrays her role as well as she would today, as a seasoned actress. She makes you smile, and later, makes you scream, squirm up into your chair and pull the blanket up to your chin.Laurie and her friends comprise a small group of 'teen-aged' girls who baby sit for weed money, and spend most of their time like many teen aged girls do; screwing their boyfriends and otherwise scheming on how to get out of the house in order to perpetrate their other plans...screwing their boyfriends. I won't outline the plot here, as this movie was done in 1978, but I will say that Donald Pleasence is very convincing as the psychiatrist, Dr. Samuel Loomis, who first treats Michael Audrey Myers. He seems genuinely concerned that he is loose and makes you believe that he cares. As he outlines Michael's past history with the cop, you get all the information you need in order to just sit back, follow the movie and enjoy being scared out of your wits.While the overuse of the word 'totally' is somewhat annoying, it's classic late '70's, early '80's jargon which Nancy Kyes (Annie) can't seem to do without. She's good and believable as a complete and total air head you can't wait to see butchered. She's also done The Fog (John Carpenter, 1980), Halloween 2, Halloween 3 (a movie they could have just never made), Not in Front of the Children and Lady Boss...nothing really spectacular, but she's entertaining in this.Wide screen had newly been introduced when Carpenter made this movie, and he excels in its use. View the wide screen edition of this movie to catch all the side action you missed in the full screen version. I understand it exhibits his abilities to give us excellent filmography and cinematography.What's also excellent is Jamie Lee Curtis's ability to exude tension, fright, concern, happiness and horror all within the same scene. She really spreads her wings in this movie and exhibits those traits we've now come to expect from her.Also I must comment on the story line/plot. I wasn't going to, but I simply must. I typically dislike 'slasher' flicks...mindless killing, puerile acting, hollow and empty plots...but the Halloween movies aren't like that. They definitely give us something besides mindless entertainment.As you may know, the endings of these movies are never really endings. They always come back. The ending of Halloween 1 is a classic in the field of Horror. Jamie is so natural here. I love this movie. It's one of my favorite horror flix.It gets a solid 9.2/10 from...the Fiend :.",9,1,3,14 September 2003
Despicable Me," 7.8 at IMDb ... ? Wow.
","While I agree with the rating, I'm sure I got there via other means. I have to ask if this is a fair rating of the movie, or if this film garnered a 7.8/10 due to flaccid choices at the box office? Either way, this is a deserving summer sleeper hit, which will find its way into my collection.Morals and life's lessons set aside, the movie is fun, witty, sweet, amusing, and entertains while still managing to maintain a coherent story. The lessons are pretty standard, the morals are slippery, and the animation is pretty decent, but the overall effect is greater than the individual components. No slick production style, just cute, cute, cute, which would normally have me hurling into the nearest trash receptacle but herein, it works.We actually laughed through 90% of this film, which is pretty amazing for us.Loved it.It rates a 7.7/10 from...the Fiend :.",8,3,7,27 July 2010
Back to the Future Part II," Darker, but just as good
","These movies play back to back as one long movie. That is a definite plus, in my book.This attempt does not hold the same charm and 'cutesy' factor of the first. It no longer feels like a mere teenager popcorn movie. This actually has some good drama, surprising twists, and a great script! It seems a bit muddled, if you don't have a good attention span, but if you just pay attention, you will find a depth that went heretofore unnoticed but it never fails to remember not to take itself too seriously..Of course, there are some campy moments as this entire body of work (the whole trilogy) is done with tongue firmly in cheek; however, the comedic deliveries are perfectly timed and executed. I found this endeavor to be quite enjoyable, a bit darker than the first, with good timing, a great flow, and a more intelligent script. It rates an 8.4/10 from...the Fiend :.",8,3,6,22 January 2005
Carrie," One of the few classics to be topped by its remake.
","As a Pagan, it's nice to see the christians portrayed as they sometimes are; pontificating zealots who believe no one is right but themselves; judgmental nose in the air types who have nothing for anyone outside their own closed-minded views; even their own family.The abuse Carrie suffers at her pious mother's hands is known throughout the country as rather a common occurrence, and it forever horribly altered poor little Carrie's persona.As a gifted teen in an oppressively religious setting, she doesn't stand a chance. Her mother's failings placed directly on the child's head; everything the mother went through; every failure, every weakness, blamed on the child. 'Satan will take you away just like he took your father!' 'Oh, Mama! Everybody KNOWS he left with another woman!'The scene where Carrie is dragged into the closet and locked inside by her mother is quite dramatic. It actually looks as though Carrie is being PULLED by her hair! It is also typical of a household in that precarious situation; living on donations made by those who'd rather pay money than listen to the zealot drone on.The effects were quite nice, but the religious connotations of the movie really just bash you in the head until you're in danger of a coma.Other than Sissy (Carrie)'s performance, the acting was stiff, the teenagers were portrayed by people closer to 30 and the movie really wasn't all that.For a compelling and faithful version of this movie, see the Made4TV remake with Angela Bettis. It's a subtly better work! This movie gets a 7.3/10 from...the Fiend :.",7,4,9,10 September 2003
1408," What King's 'Authorized: the Shining' SHOULD Have Done
","This movie was as surprise from start to finish. I was not highly anticipating a work based on Stephen King, and adapted by Larry Karaszewski, whose dubious 'credits' seem to lie flat on the page, as well as the screen. King's works are bastardized enough. I really saw no point to this new exercise in adulteration.I can say I am happy a fan brought me a copy of the DVD. I was bowled over. The innovatives were quite creative, and the work itself held a great fascination beneath the seeming infectious insanity if a house gone mad.I might find this an opportune time to interject that I may not have bought the execution of this work, without the beautifully tragic performance of John Cusak. He was this film's Jack Nicholson, and he pulled it off brilliantly.All in all? Stephen King likes a haunted house, and quite frankly, I highly enjoy haunted houses via King. 1408 is like the Shining on a steroid overdrive, and I highly recommend it. This is a GREAT Friday/Saturday night movie.It rates an 8.8/10 from...the Fiend :.",9,0,0,15 November 2007
Shrek," Sweetly cynical
","Sweet, yet cynical...beautiful landscapes and textures colored by Myers's 'If it's not Scottish, it's crap' skit from SNL (not a good thing). A faerie tale wrought with sarcasm and jaded one-liners.This movie is definitely for the adults in the family. The children should be spared this tired, jaded, and cynical view of the world presented by our hero and his side-kicking ass.While the story is typical, the characters are very well developed and the computer graphics are fantastic. The background textures and skin tones are beautifully realistic and you can tell there were many great talents devoted to this production. The textures of the trees, the characters, and even the facial hair growth of the characters was amazing. Too bad they did not put more into the story to rate this wonderful CGI treatment.Unfortunately, they did not, and it shows. The tritely delivered one liners, the cynical philosophies, and the jaded presentation of love and self esteem should probably not go directly into the minds of America's children. There are enough sources for this negative kind of thinking, in my opinion, and the children do understand what is being said. Never for a moment should you be under the misconception that they are ignorant of the underlying meanings of these adult-based jibes and insults.I love this movie, myself. But, having been a parent, I can safely say that were there small children about, they would not be watching Shrek very often; if at all, until they were old enough to understand that there is a difference between cynicism and sarcasm, and that what is funny is very seldom what is right.All that aside, as an adult, I love this movie. The story, as I have already stated, is a bit recycled, but nevertheless, it is classic. Unfortunately, the fairy tale portion of this production is more of a fairy tail.Though I loved the Donkey. This character (done well by Eddie Murphy) was the comedian, bouncing the one liners off of Shrek's 'straight-man' persona, leaving Eddie Murphy to get all the laughs while Myers's character (working from the murky depths of a horribly muddled accent) must remain in the dark and gloomy mode, as ogres are not known to be very social creatures.The messages here are plain and simple, right from the start: love yourself, friends have value, and be true to yourself. Good messages which do come through the sarcastic wit and cynical philosophies, regardless of the strong delivery of these devices, but perhaps a bit watered-down by the time it filters through into children's minds.This is nevertheless, a fun movie with good characters, a classic good vs. evil format, and strong visual effects generated by true artisans in the field of computer graphics interface. I love the inclusion of the Dragon as a non-evil entity. Dragons are far too often the symbol of evil incarnate; an erroneous and unfair convenience generated by the Catholic church of the first millennium. After the Druid priests were converted, their ties with Dragon kind had to be severed in order to fully control the followers of these priests. Thus the link between Dragons and evil was created, established, and used wrongfully in their persecution. I found it philosophically and theologically heartening.But I digress.This is a fun movie, if you can hear the soundtrack over the cheering of the executives behind this production, and can manage to feel uplifted by the love story as it filters past the cold-hearted jibes and cynicism found throughout.If you haven't seen it, do so. It's well worth the 93 minutes invested. Just screen it first, if you plan on allowing your kids to view it. As I said, some of the philosophies are a bit cold and hard to stomach.It rates a 8.1/10 from...the Fiend :.",8,1,2,11 December 2003
The Silence of the Lambs," Chillingly realistic
","For character development of Hannibal Lecter, please view Red Dragon, first.It is the prequel to this movie, and bestows the viewer with much needed information not gleaned from this production.The end of 'Red Dragon' tells us that Hannibal has an upcoming visit from another FBI agent to look forward to; a female agent. He asks for her name but due to the nature of prequels, we already have that information: Clarice Starling. This is one of those Oscars-dominating movies whose name was on the tip of everyone's tongue for a while. From time to time, a movie comes along which is so annoyingly popular as to make me wish to never see it. Mainstream popularity is not wholly attractive to me, and I tend to avoid it at all costs. However, I was forced to view this film as a class requirement in college. So I rented it, determined to hate it. First of all, the whole movie, although released in the early 90's, appears to be obsessed with the 1980's. The clothing, the hair styles, the clichés, the soundtrack, and the atmosphere seems to be wrapped in a time warp. Starling's (Jodie Foster) character in particular, seems to be a walking cliché. She is a hapless hick; an unfortunate who is, as Lecter put it, '...one generation away from poor white trash.' Secondly. I was born in the south, and I can tell you that her accent, though sometimes a decent reminiscing of poor West Virginia, is horrible. It comes and goes seemingly at whim. Third. The training and knowledge Starling exhibits, combined with the fact that she grew up poor, in a home where sewing was almost a certain necessity, the fact that she missed the obvious sewing patterns of skin removed from the victims just does not work for me. I grew up upper middle class, and I knew in the first 30 minutes what Buffalo Bill was up to. Her character should have been written to be more intelligent. She was able to puzzle out Lecter's riddles, but not see what was staring her right in the face? And lastly. While the film quality is horrible; grainy and low quality, the cinematography itself is startlingly good.All that having been said, the psychological aspects of this film are above reproach. Dr. Lecter's character, portrayed brilliantly by Anthony Hopkins, is the perfect portrayal of a psychopathic sycophant with a 'taste' for high society. As a slave to his own superiority, he is a thousand times more dangerous than those psychopaths who believe they are on a holy mission, or at the head of some spiritual metamorphosis into a higher state of being. Lecter is under no such delusion. He is the brilliant sociopath who can blend into society without casting even the briefest hesitation in our acceptance of his social graces and high society politeness. He does as he does, merely as a means to humor himself, and for no other reason. There are no outward clues or appearances of anything gone wrong within and therefore, is all the more deadly for it. He simply...is. His manipulation of Starling is on a high intellectual level. He is a sage of such devious management of others' minds. His knowledge of Buffalo Bill, the newest personification of sickness, brings Starling to his cell. As a brilliant psychiatrist turned 'Chesapeake Slasher,' Lecter has had the opportunity to touch many lives; to shape, mold, and guide others less fortunate than he. Indeed, his influence may very well have assisted Buffalo Bill in his crossing the stream between being a confused and needy individual, to that of a homicidal psychopath. Many researchers have agreed that offender profiling can be a useful tool in solving serial homicides (Egger, 1998; Stevens, 1997; Holmes, 1998; Canter, 1994; Douglas and Olshaker, 1995). However, the question remains as to whether the lack of ability the modern police department has in dealing with serial homicide has created a real need for this type of investigative practice. A lack of psychological training, limited resources, and an apparent rise in serial homicide rates may be creating the appearance that police need new investigative techniques, when in reality what may be more appropriate is a higher standard of psychological training among police investigators. The number of serial killers presently active in the United States has been estimated to be between 30 and 500, depending on the source (O'Reilly-Fleming, 1996). Just think. With the possibility of 500 serial killers who are 'active' in the US, how many of them are as educated and intelligent as the character of Hannibal Lecter? The statistics are chilling at an estimation of 80% (O'Reilly-Fleming, 1996). Many serial killers are professionals; doctors, lawyers, even law enforcement personnel or city employees. People who have passed the civil service tests, psychological evaluations, and thorough screenings. Sociopaths are such due to their ability to 'blend in' with our society without any obvious dysfunctions. How many people do you know who are a little 'quirky,' eccentric, or just plain freaky? Chances are, they are not the homicidal maniacs in your lives. Chances are, they are the very polite, nice, friendly and helpful person at the drug store where you go; the empathetic lab tech who is drawing your blood; the family physician with the terminal smile...think about this, and these movies, next time you encounter an overly-polite stranger. Just a thought. This movie rates a 9.8/10 from...the Fiend :.",10,1,1,21 October 2003
Iron Man," VERY well done! This is even GRITTY! Wow!
","I have to ask ... Who better to play a middle-aged, wrung-out, loser than Robert Downey, Jr.? I say that with the utmost fondness, however, as I loved the IronMan comics as a kid, and I've never minded Robert Downey, Jr. as an actor. But in this role, he seems to have found his niche. I hope this run lasts for YEARS and gives Downey the inner Zen he needs to finish out his career with some pride.Going back to the origins, as in 'Batman Begins,' and a plethora of other comic book-to-movie lines (Check out upcoming X-Men 'Origins' movies, 'Wolverine,' and 'Magneto.'), seems to be the best formula for launching a new franchise, or breathing new life into a dead one. It certainly worked for Batman and Spiderman, and I'm sure it will work with audiences this time, even though IronMan is a 'lesser' character who usually stands in the background vying for his 15 seconds of screen time. I am happy to say that Downey and a respectable budget resolves that condition and elevates this franchise to something more desirable and far more reverent than many other comic book attempts on film.Downey really seems to connect with this character, and Gwyneth Paltrow is so funny as Pepper Potts. Yes, she's sexy, too, but she's FUNNY and so is Downey. I do believe audiences the world over will subscribe to this newly resurrected Marvel superhero in that he is completely human. You get Tony Stark, warts and all, and Downey plays him that way. He comes off so at ease in this part that it seems he was engineered specifically for this role.All in all? It may be a little too risquÃ© (in places) and violent (in others) for the kiddies, but the rest of humanity should LOVE it. It is gritty and holds some thread of reality, which weaves itself throughout, although I must say that the finale is a bit tepid. It left something to be desired in the big finish and felt a tad anticlimactic. Still awesome, though.And the toys ... there are loads of gadgets, toys, and comfortably spun one-liners. This is a story-driven, blockbuster-y , KABOOM flick with very little popcorn-ery to be had, although this IS an effects BLOW OUT of a comic book flick! It features a slick production style, top notch film quality, and a superb screen play. This superhero endeavor seems to be the birth of a new (and great) franchise, and I certainly hope it will not be the last. Indeed, there are hints as to another story line for a possible sequel.

Tombstone," Cinema rarely gets any better than this!
","I found this movie moving, exciting, rousing, and imaginative. This is, in my opinion, the best modern western ever.The research done into the Wild, Wild Western days of the old United States simply blows One away. This was by far the best western of the 'Western Revival' era. Historically and on the level of the saga, this was the superior film. There are no better performances, anywhere. The direction is superb, the action is perfectly choreographed, the script is gritty yet touching, and the dialog demonstrates some of the best talent in Hollywood.There is something for everyone. If you're after pure action; however, this is not the movie for you. This is an action/drama; which documents love, life, friendship, and death. If you've come for nothing but the 'shoot-em-up factor,' then move on down to 'Young Guns,' which features loads of action and very little else. If you're after excellent cinema; wonderful direction, inspired performances, genuine costumes and creative set designs, then by all means...grab a smoke and pull up a Tombstone; have a seat and prepare to be entertained.Cinema rarely gets any better than this!

The Emperor's New Groove," Some of Spade's best work.
","My whole family LOVES this movie!David Spade and John Goodman's characters were hilarious. The whole production was excellent Disney fare; highly entertaining and, of course, containing the typical Disney lesson. This one teaches you not to be too big for your breeches, that the world does NOT revolve around that Center of the Universe that is YOU, and that not everyone you think are your friends can be trusted.Emperor Kuzco has been spoiled since birth. Having been raised to be Emperor, his every whim was immediately granted, causing him to become a spoiled rotten, greedy little tyrant around whom the universe revolves.In his aggravated state over his regent dealing with the kingdom anytime his back is turned, he forgets (or perhaps has yet to learn) that not everyone is going to bow to his every whim. He fires Yzma (his regent), and in his self-absorbed state of mind, does not stop to consider that there may be repercussions. Ah, but there are.Yzma has her assistant Kronk (Richard Warburton of 'Scream 3') poison and KILL Kuzco, but instead, he goofs and turns the petty little schmuck into a llama. The rest of the movie deals with Kuzco learning his lessons and trying to find his way back home to the palace. Not an easy feat when he's never been in the jungles of his kingdom, in his life.After treating the 'whiny peasant' Pacha like a red-headed step-child, he actually expects his help. Pacha, being a warm-hearted person, reluctantly gives it, but not without conditions. Conditions Kuzco breaks and breaks and breaks, of course, because he's still a SCHMUCK!This Disney production is quite amusing mainly because David Spade is such a complete and total @ss and he definitely gets what's coming to him. Nice to see that happen sometimes. You know? NO ONE likes a person who is THAT uncaring of others' feelings. Good movie, great story, decent animation and a lovely ending. The only thing I did not like about this movie was the animation. Disney's quality has gone down considerably in the last few years. They pay little or no attention to detail anymore. I hate that. For me, the visuals and the background details, can make a huge difference, and Disney doesn't seem to care much about that anymore.This should go straight into the Disney Classics collection.It gets an 8/10 from...the Fiend :.",8,1,3,4 October 2003
Blade Runner," Sci-fi/actioner cult classic
","As technology itself advances, movies based on technology become outdated. This movie is not SO outdated as to warrant a bad review at this late date, but it is beginning to show signs of wear about the edges, and fails to give you the science of the sci-fi genre. This endeavor attempts to show the prejudices of our society, and features a just-coming-out-of-retirement Blade Runner played by post Star Wars but pre-Indiana Jones's Harrison Ford; a hunter of humanoid AI, with Daryl Hannah and Rutger Hauer as the principle 'bad guys,' and Sean Young (Lois Einhorn of Ace Ventura: Pet Detective fame) as the hapless love interest. Not a bad mix for a film on 'social responsibility.'The score has a definite 'Fifth Element' feel to it, meaning Luc Beson's endeavor looked to Blade Runner for some of its inspiration. It sounded techno with a middle eastern influence and greatly helped move the story along when it hits a weak or slow spot. Some of the bar scenes held the flavor of Star Wars's Cantina on Moss Eisley, and some of the dialog was reminiscent of Fletch Lives. Now, this may sound like an uneven mess, but somehow, it works.This work has become a landmark 'cult classic' in the genre of sci-fi/action, and is a must have for any sci-fi fan or collector.This production earns a 7.2/10 from...the Fiend :.",7,7,13,9 January 2005
Bruce Almighty," Beats you over the head with dogmatic religious ramblings.
","Carrey vs. Stewart. Is this an attempt at a modernized remake of 'It's A Wonderful Life?'Bruce is a schmuck reporter who has blown every chance he's ever had, until he finally cracks and starts yelling at his deity of choice to do a better job. Since he feels he's got a good bead on what 'god' should do to make things better, he is given the chance to do it for himself.I found this movie to be entertaining...if you are of mainstreamchristianity. If you are not, then it will be a colossal waste of your time as most of the movie shows what NOT to do with supposed God-like powers, and the remainder shows what you should ... again, from a mainstreamchristian standpoint.There IS however, a very strong 'New Age-y' message in the theme of this movie, in spite of the obvious proselytization; to look to yourself for your own miracles.Other than that, if you are not mainstreamchristian, I suggest you absquatulate to the action section of your video rental store and pick up Laura Croft: Tomb Raider 2; the Cradle of Life. It is far superior to the first installment, and a fun adventure.Or...X-MEN United (X2). Again, better than the original, which was not a bad endeavor to begin with. The sequel gives you much more character development and a much better adventure than the first. There are a few new additions to the Mutant fold, as well. So have fun, and avoid this almost-reverent look at neochristianity at all costs. However...if you are of that persuasion, then you'll either love it or hate it. It promotes prayer, piety, and attempts to generate pity for an overworked, under-appreciated deity. It didn't work for me, but it may work for you.I would have rather rearranged my garage, frankly.If you are a die-hard Carrey fan, it rates a 6.7/10 for Carrey's great performance.If you are nonchristian, it rates a 2.1/10 only because Carrey IS good in this movie, but the content is 100% christianoriented and is an impudent promotion of those religious theologies.If you are a comedy fan, it rates a 3.2/10 for a couple of good laughs (don't miss Carrey's parting of the 'Red Sea.')If you are of the ranks of neochristianity, it rates a 7.2/10 for shameless monotheistic proselytization.As a whole, it rates a 3.1/10 from... the Fiend :.",3,5,12,27 November 2003
Signs," Quirky Sci-Fi Generates Good Atmosphere, But Falls Short.
","This work is compelling, I won't lie to you. It has some very tense moments, some well-generated characters, and delivers good performances all around. I didn't have a problem with any of these elements.The main problem with this work was the creature effects. As a creature feature, this one falls flat. As a sci-fi, it rates as a 'B' movie because of the hokey, ill-designed aliens. The story was quite compelling, but the effects left a LOT to be desired.It's still an entertaining work, but it could have been much, MUCH better.It rates a 6.6/10 from...the Fiend :.",7,0,5,23 March 2007
Identity," Toned Down and Cranked Up Rethinking of Sybil.
","I'll warn you right now, I'm telling the whole story, so if you don't want to know the ending, the twist and the inside details, then don't read this!!!I normally don't tell the whole story like this, but this movie is such a psychological mind game that I have total respect for it, and feel the need to share.Malcolm Rivers has been convicted of six murders. They show you the details and give you the basic information via news clippings and the like in the very beginning of the movie during the opening credits, so pay attention. He is clinically insane, and only twenty-four hours from his execution. The governor's office has granted him a last minute hearing by a judge who is none too happy to have been called out of bed in the middle of the night to hear a case upon which he has already ruled.Meanwhile, the cast of characters is introduced. It is pouring down rain, the phones are down, a prisoner in transport has escaped and a woman lies dying in the room off the motel office. There is friction from the very beginning, as one character causes an accident while another character runs over the wife of yet another character. And this is only the beginning.As the characters develop, you begin to get a feel for who they are and what they have been through; the development is really quite good.One by one, the motel visitors are found dead and one by one, your list of suspects begins to narrow.Jake Busey (the escaped prisoner) runs and runs away from the hotel, but when he spies a structure lying off in the distance, he crashes in to discover he's BACK at the hotel! A metaphor for John Lennon's 'Nothing is Real' theory. Jack Busey is really very good. They don't give him near enough work, in my opinion. He's every bit as good as his daddy.The survivors must determine the common factor which has led them all to the hotel. Amanda Peet begins this process, and it takes a while before the others join in. Meanwhile, they are trying as hard as they can to determine what is happening and why; who is killing these people off.As the guests realize that they all have the same birth day, you pan to Malcolm Rivers's hearing where you discover that he is a multiple personality with several distinct personalities.His personalities ARE the guests of the hotel. As each personality is exposed to Rivers's base identity, the alternate personality is 'murdered' in his own mind. The whole movie is a working metaphor for what is going on in Malcolm's mind. This part is presented as a 'twist,' and it definitely takes you by surprise.The writing and direction are absolutely brilliant. Awesomely presented and believably portrayed by all involved. This is a genuine work of art.But as everything seems to be winding down and the sidewalks are rolling up, you discover that the personality who committed the murders has indeed NOT been 'killed.' You don't discover until the end of the movie, what is going on or why. It was possibly one of the best psychological thrillers I have ever seen. It rates up there with 'The Game,' and 'Fallen.'I can't bring myself to tell you which personality is the murderer. But it will blow you away! This was a total masterpiece of psychology, horror and suspense.I give it an 8.6/10 from...The Fiend :.",9,0,0,1 October 2003
Beowulf," Tragically Lovely
","The tale of Beowulf was told in an epic poem by an unknown 8th-11th century author. It tells of Beowulf, a Geat (Goth) hero of what is now known as Sweden, and his three equally epic battles with Grendel, Grendel's mother (known here and there as the Black Queen of Midguard), and an unnamed Dragon (thought by some to be the Midguard Serpent).While this film tells the tale somewhat differently than the author's original interpretation (the author, for instance, lays the hero to rest beneath a sacred mound), it tells Beowulf's story in a way never before told...with an obvious love of the tale itself, a love of the medium in which it is delivered, and a love of the artistry herein employed.This is a lovely Friday/Saturday night's viewing, as there is something for everyone: While some scenes are not suitable for children, they will be drawn by the awesome animation quality, men will (no doubt) enjoy the raucous behavior of the men and the monsters, and women should identify with the plight and innate dignity (even in the face of what some would consider shame) of the Queen. There is ample action herein to keep most fan-boys happy, and enough story to make what CAN be dry reading, a great adventure.It rates an easy 9/10 from...the Fiend :.",9,1,5,4 December 2007
X2: X-Men United," Surpasses the first!
","The return of all the original cast members, the increased character development, the beautiful character development of Nightcrawler, and the addition of the newer characters, all contributed to the absolute success of this amazingly directed and executed production.The portrayals were pure talent, as was the writing of this story, the direction, the editing, the filmography, the sets and designs, the innovations surrounding the talents of the mutants, and everything else involved with this movie. I was stunned at the pure quality and creativity contained within this film. I am both inspired and delighted by this movie.It was twice as good as the first, and I can only look forward to the Special Edition of this chapter, and the third installment (the Phoenix line and a better interpretation of Rogue's coming into womanhood and her full powers) with a great anticipation. Absolutely amazing effects and an excellent story lend an enormous backdrop for these wonderful, creative and beautiful characters.It rates a 9.0/10 from...the Fiend :.",9,0,1,26 November 2003
The Producers," Enterprising and enjoyable
","While Zero Mostel is the lead, Gene Wilder is the star.This is a clever and slick production featuring two very unlikely comedic forces which work magically together. The chemistry created by these two stellar personages is undeniable and extremely entertaining. While this production is horribly dated, it almost seems timeless. You get the impression that it was made as a modern production and merely set back in a distant period. This is a very endearing venture which never fails to amuse in its crass and crude content, which presents itself as elegance personified.Although this attempt failed miserably upon its initial release (a $112K return from a $941K estimated budget) this is some of Mel Brooks' best work to date. Topped, in my opinion, only by 'Young Frankenstein,' I'm happy to see it running on Broadway, in London, and it is being given a new treatment due out later this year (2005). It's way overdue.This is a classic and rates an 8.3/10 from...the Fiend :.",8,2,2,25 January 2005

The characters here are well conceived, presented, and executed, as is the storyline, the premise, the tale, and the animation. This is among the oldest of Disney's animated feature-length films, and in my opinion, the older ones are the better ones.

RED," It Is Fun!
","Poking fun at the James Bond era will always be good fun. Austin Powers did it so irreverently, and if you didn't like that, you should like the more dignified comedic venture found here. This is a new favorite for me in the venue of action/comedy. The comedic tone is perfect. It does not draw away from the action, nor does it overshadow the story.Production style is smooth with a tongue-in-cheek look at the Cold War days, a paranoid view of the American government, and a hopeful view of the future. I did not know what to expect, so I had no preconceived notions surrounding this film, so my cold reaction is that it was totally enjoyable, and one I WILL own.This work features little character development, but it doesn't seem to need it. Investment in the characters is still easy and natural. The plot moves well, and the execution flows consistently to a satisfactory conclusion.All in all? Watch it.

The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King," A Masterpiece!
","This movie brought together everything the first two laid out, tied them into nice, neat little bundles, and concluded the whole trilogy just as it should. It does not conclude as you wish it to, but rather as Tolkien intended.The battle scenes were simply awesome this time around. With Helm's Deep, we were amazed, but Pelennor fields and Minas Tirith will leave you absolutely stunned; truly in awe of the mastery involved.'Mastery.' That is a good word, and very aptly describes this production; Masterful. The sets and props were again pure perfection.The performances were of the very best, most deliberate and heart-wrenching, uplifting realistic performances on film to date. The changes made in the story were small changes and not even note-worthy; the direction staff did a marvelous job rewriting this beloved classic with all the creativity, care and love they had to offer. LotR is now my favorite movie series to date. Star Wars held that position in my heart since its release, followed by the subsequent two installments, but this, the 'Return of the King,' is the most imaginatively creative work I have ever had the pleasure of witnessing.I simply cannot wait to own the third Extended Edition Gift Set featuring this masterpiece.I will not give away the details, as many here have (and without SPOILER warnings, I might add). I will leave that for someone else.EDIT: This was literally the very best movie I've ever seen! I cannot recommend the 4-disk Extended Collector's Edition Gift Set ENOUGH! Wow! There is SO much more movie here than there was in the theatrical version!As did the first two installments, this movie rates a full 10/10 from the Fiend.

","Based on a true story from the late 70's and published in the LA times were articles concerning young people were dying while in the grips of a nightmare. This is to be one of the freshest innovations of the horror genre of the 1980's. These articles detailed a particular young man who, after his death, was found to have hidden a coffee pot in his closet; utilizing caffeine as a means to keep him awake rather than facing his nightmares. He had even told his family that these nightmares did not 'feel real.' Written and directed by Horror Maven Wes Craven, this series took on a phenomenal success rate with this first installment in what later became the 'Freddy Franchise.' He incorporated a man from one of his early childhood memories in the characterization of his newest nemesis by giving Freddy the characteristics of this stranger who had frightened him as a child.As a risky endeavor, this film turned out to be one of the surprising innovations in the slasher sub-genre of Horror. Indeed, this film was extremely risky for New Line, as they had a credit limit of around $100,000.00 and was forbidden by the bank to use a dime of that in film production and had to raise the money to begin production on this endeavor.As a variation on the news paper articles, this attempt needed something which would bring in the ladies, to widen the target audience and give it a stronger feeling of reality. The element of 'Beauty and the Beast' was written in and played upon in such a darkling twisted way that this film was pivoted into the horror movie Hall of Fame, so to speak, by recreating the modern myth of the ultimate battle between good and evil.Another credit to this production is that it does not take itself too seriously. It pokes fun at the horror genre itself, thereby lending a solid reality base to the fantastical subject matter. Something which was also done in Craven's later slasher trilogy, 'Scream.' This vehicle does more than provide the element of humor, it also sets up the audience and commences the process of drawing them into the story by giving them various points with which they can relate to the lead characters. It also homages other horror greats, as many movies will later homage this one.The character development here was extravagantly done. You felt like you knew them and thereby it mattered what happened with them. The process was never slow, tedious or boring, always drawing you in and making you feel like you were a part of the 'team.' Starring Heather Langencamp and John Saxon, this movie has the distinction of introducing Johnny Depp in his first screen role at the age of 21. While these performances were nothing Oscar-worthy, they were way above and beyond what the average movie goer would expect from a low budget teen slasher movie. It seems that Johnny Depp was destined for stardom as his portrayal, even then, was that of a polished professional.The camera work here was creatively done, but the real achievement in this department goes to the lighting crew. The shadows and lighting choices here were an integral part of what created the incredible atmosphere of foreboding this movie held. Using split-mirror shots and an innovative eye for shadow and light, you never seem to notice the low budget aspects of this film. The liberal use of blood shows the audience that this villain is not afraid to get his hands dirty. Nay, he revels in it; hungers for it; exists for it.The sets were realistically designed; the Thompson house felt like a home; the police station felt authentic and that boiler room...Great sinister feel, it had.This movie had a beautiful element of suspense; dark and foreboding tension which builds with a rhythmic fretful crescendo to the climax.But does it scare? I have to admit there are several scenes which made me literally jump. Some were predictable, but most were honest thrills.All in all, while this is not THE best of the many horror franchises of the 1980's (That distinction goes to the Hellraiser run, in my opinion), it is definitely one OF the best, and second only to Hellraiser. (Some would class Halloween in here somewhere, but in all fairness, it was released in 1978 and therefore does not qualify as an '80's film.' This first installment rates an 8.4/10 from...the Fiend :.",8,0,2,2 April 2004
The Truman Show," Everyone raves over it, but I think this is where he started going down.
","This is one of those times when I must differ with other reviewers. I didn't like this one. I support Carrey's attempt to jump into another genre, and the work itself is awesome. Carrey's performance clearly rocks. But the whole premise was affronting. I, frankly, hated this movie. Carrey's performance makes it worth the hype, but the story itself was a cold, calculating, cashing-in of the talent, and I can not find anything enjoyable about that.This work was clearly intended to make you think. It endears you to the main character (Carrey), introduces its premise (which was refreshingly new), and then lowers the boom. It was the boom I couldn't swallow. I found this work horribly disturbing, and just plain sad.Frankly, in spite of the glowing reviews and excellent numbers this work received, I believe this is the pinpoint of the decline of Carrey's career. I hope he pulls out of it, or soon he'll just be another washed-up comedian.It rates a 4.6/10 from...the Fiend :.",5,1,7,17 March 2007
Heat," Great Crime/Cop Vehicle That's A Bit Underrated
","What do you say about a great script and inspired direction, which brings DeNiro and Pacino together on the same screen? It's every bit as great as it sounds like it would be. Directed by Michael Mann, this actioner carries a heavy story, along with fantastic action sequences, while building great suspense through marvellous direction and believable dialog, not to mention a great score by Elliot Goldenthal.All in all? I found this highly enjoyable, and can't wait to add it to my collection. I don't know how I missed this one, but I did. While this isn't a great big block-bustery KABOOM pic, it's close enough for a Friday night viewing, if cop/crime actioners are your thing. This would make great viewing anytime.I loved it and think it deserves better than the 8.1 it currently enjoys here at IMDb.COM.It rates a 9.2/10 from...the Fiend :.",9,0,1,28 June 2007
Star Wars: Episode IV - A New Hope," One of the most successful movies of all time (and I'm not talking about the Box Office take)
","What made this the hugely successful triumph it was? Was it casting, music, imagination, ingenuity, or luck?I remember opening day at the theaters. I was old enough to remember every scene, every character, every nuance of this film; having committed it to memory forever, as if I would never again be able to see this beloved, instantly loved masterpiece.I also remember that the HIT factor of this movie was so unexpected that you had to wait literal MONTHS to get the action figures promised on the cereal boxes. The pieces were still in the manufacturing process and we had to settle for coupons promising our toys in a few months. I wound up seeing this in the theaters a grand total of 36 times; much to my mother's dismay. She loved the movie as I did, but felt I was obsessed. Today, thirty years later, sitting here writing this review, I realize how right she was. I'm still obsessed with this movie, and with the subsequent movies which followed. I wait in great anticipation for Episode 3. I'm a fan, and I don't care what other people say about Episodes 1 & 2. I don't even mind the 'prequel' factor, as the situation at the time, dictated to Lucas which movies he would do first.See, I remember the studios saying to him that he had to choose from the three central climactic books, and trash the rest, or just trash the whole idea. He didn't exactly 'sell out,' he did what he had to do to get his movie...his vision...out there for us to see and experience. I admired his decision then, and I admire it now. Episodes 1-3 are being filmed now, because Lucas had the clout, the money, and the patience to give us his vision...his complete vision and not just the three center books of a 9-book series. I realize that now, there are dozens of books, but at the time, there were nine. And while most of us were happy with Episodes 4-6 and would not have missed 1-3 and 7-9, I personally am so very glad he has taken it upon himself to give us his full vision. I have enjoyed each and every installment with the same sense of awe and joy as I did this one.The casting was the first triumph for this cinematic milestone. Ford is a charismatic and magnetic personality and portrayed Han with a professionalism that you'd expect from more seasoned actors. Sir Alec Guiness is an absolute joy as Obi Wan. His casting was precise and excellent in that part. Carrie Fisher portrayed Leia in a way that, up until then, had never been experienced. Most 'princess' types before her were whining, whimpering, little snots who were incapable of anything beyond tripping and twisting their ankle in times of peril, while Fisher portrayed her character as a bold, brazen, yet sophisticated and educated woman who was aware of her surroundings and capable of defending herself and her realm with the utmost authority.And Mark Hamil. He was perfectly cast as the whining little boy who wanted more, but was afraid to reach for it. He grows up quite well on film in these three installments, and endears himself to the audience so much the more for it. But a cast member who is almost always left out of these reviews is Peter Mayhew. Chewbacca. His character, as a supporting character to Han's, was exemplary. It's not easy portraying a walking carpet, yet holding the attention, admiration, and love of virtual millions. I am VERY happy about his being cast as Chewy in Episode 3. Couldn't happen to a more deserving...or capable...fellow. Bravo! And James Earl Jones's voice being used as the voice of Darth Vader, was pure genius. His commanding voice haunted the dreams of countless thousands of star-struck children for generations to come. I also have to say that this movie would not have had the charm it does had it not been for Anthony Daniels' C3P0. He is a gift and a joy.The musical score by John Williams featured in this masterpiece was one of the contributing factors. But honestly, this movie's success was such a total surprise to everyone, including Lucas, that nothing could prepare the world for the aftermath of having witnessed this bona fide legend, first hand.The story itself; replete with sub-plot after sub-plot, rich in dialog and detail, was beyond anyone's greatest expectations. Everyone, including Lucas, expected this movie to fail. It is a timeless classic, which I will not repeat here. There are too many movie reviews giving full details of the plot, and I won't be redundant beyond what I have already said.However, that being said, there are a few points I would like to make concerning the symbolism of this endeavor. The Force is a metaphor for the psychic abilities with which we are all born. It was also a metaphor for hope and faith, dedication and commitment to the greater state of being. The Empire is said to have been a metaphor for the Germanic Nazi 'storm troopers.' While the Rebellion is said to have been symbolic of (what would later become) the NATO forces who defeated them.And then there are the effects. The effects were, in 1977, so awesome; so creative; so ahead of their time, as to ensure this movie's vast success for the next forty years. George Lucas enjoys an almost god-like status among sci-fi/fantasy fans worldwide.This movie does not rate a rating. Usually, when I say that, it is because the movie is so bad, or disappointing that I don't have the heart to rate it. But in this case, it far surpasses any 10/10 rating I could give it.The Fiend :.",10,532,678,26 October 2003
300," A Visually Stunning, Beautifully Written Bloodbath.
","I found 300 to be startling in its graphic portrayal of a battle of 300 against thousands. While it was reminiscent of both Helm's Deep and the battle on Pelennor Plains, it still retained a feeling all its own. Some critics have compared this work against Jackson's, but I don't think that's appropriate. This film stood alone and stood without assistance. I don't see any reason to make the comparison.This was a brilliant work of cinematic art...it was a visually stunning, beautifully written bloodbath. If you like loads of brilliant action, good writing, beautiful acting, and lots of gore, you not only could do worse than 300, but you probably already have, and loved it.But beneath all that, the timing for this movie seems political. Here, you have 300 Spartans standing against hundreds of thousands of terrifying invaders led by Xerxes who believes himself a God, while the Spartan senate refuses to send in the Spartan army to assist these brave warriors in their stand to defend all of Sparta. This clearly parallels the current Congressional position wherein they refuse to send in more troops or allocate appropriate funding to assist our soldiers already in the field. I think this is the most compelling draw this work has for American audiences, today. I also admire the marketing of this work, as a fine example of marketing genius.300 is a must see.It rates a 9.8/10 from...the Fiend :.",10,7,23,4 March 2007
Tarzan," Excellent Disney fare. One of the best.
","Okay. They rewrote the whole legend. But Disney has an unerring way of doing that. Anyone remember Pocahontas? They even changed Cinderella, Snow White, and every other Disney Masterpiece sitting on your shelves, so why does it matter that this, too, was changed?It matters on several different levels, but the most important reason it matters is because Disney, in their positioning among the children's entertainment market, is in the unique position to actually teach these legends, these snippets of history, these morals and ethics, to the children of their audiences, rather than proffering sugar-coated, merchandized over-glorifications in exchange for the great American dollar. That having been said, this is still an entertaining introduction to the legend, but I highly suggest 'Greystoke: The Legend of Tarzan, Lord of the Apes,' (1984), directed by Hugh Hudson. It is the most faithful adaptation I've ever seen, and a highly enjoyable adventure, which carries a PG rating and is safe for most ages to view.A lot has been said about the deep canvas effect used throughout the jungle scenes, and I must admit that I found the technique highly effective and extremely well done. I do computer graphics myself, and I was very impressed with the 3D effects throughout, including the water variants and textures used in the ship scenes, the fire effects used in the jungle, and the smoke effects from the guns used by the poachers. The textures and backgrounds were absolutely stunning, and for me, as a graphics artist, that's what I look for when I view a quality animation.Very good endeavor.It rates an 8/10 from...the Fiend :.",8,32,40,28 October 2003
Apollo 13," Good, But Flawed.
","Ron Howard is, without doubt, an excellent director. One of the best, in fact. And this film does go a long way towards showing subsequent generations what happened aboard the Apollo 13 in 1970. But while it does chronicle the events, it fails to show the political upheaval which took NASA by storm as a result of this failed mission and instead, chooses to focus on the heart-wrenching and sometimes played-to-death angst of the NASA wives.The arguments and disagreements which occur within that capsule are documented in the book written by Jim (Hanks's character), and are downplayed something fierce in order to allow Ron Howard his warm and fuzzy feeling; something he seems to need. While I haven't a problem with Ron's warm fuzzies, I do if they interfere with the story, and this time (Sorry Ron), they do.Other than these oversights (intentional or not), the film adequately depicts the actual events of the Apollo 13 mission. I know, because I was one of the millions who was alive, and remembers it. In spite of ignoring the (understandable and excused) virtual battle our three astronauts waged against one another in space, NASA fallout omissions, and errant warm fuzzies, I still enjoy this film.It rates a 7.8/10 from...the Fiend :.",8,0,1,28 March 2007
Fantastic Four," Not What I'd Hoped For
","This movie wasn't total let down. I had to say that at the onset. It wasn't as bad as some say. But it wasn't as good as it should have been, either. Jessica Alba. Unlike her curves, her performance was flat. That's all I have to say on it; it was lacking.The story was the classic story, with a few adulterations, but nothing uproariously radical. It unfolded well, and didn't begin to fall apart until towards the end, when the performances stood alone and most of the action was over.I won't talk about the direction, because there really isn't a lot to talk about here. I also won't talk about the performances, mainly because with a sole exception, there really weren't any performances worth commenting on.The one bright light? Ben. He was perfect in every detail. And the development and construction of his character and 'look' was the one I was most worried about! What a hoot, hunh? It rates a 5.8/10 from...the Fiend :.",6,0,1,9 March 2007
Click," Reflective Comedy/Drama Pays Off!
","To be honest, when this was first previewed, I had no interest in viewing it. It appeared to be a flick featuring Adam Sandler, portraying a manipulative and controlling moron. I wasn't interested. I LIKE Adam Sandler. I've been a fan since the first glimmerings of his career. I didn't want to see this.I know not to judge a book by its cover, now I've learned not to judge a movie by its previews.I just caught this against my will on the StarZ/Encore network, and it is extraordinary, but not in the ways one might expect. The story is not unique, but it IS innovative. The finished product only rates around a 7/10. But Sandler's performance drives this work, although it is geared to be story-driven.The work is reminiscent of A Christmas Carol by Dickens in that the main character has the opportunity to leap forward in time to see where his life is headed. Much like the Tarot, the remote he is given by the archangel Michael, only shows him what will happen if Sandler's character stays on the same path. It does not cause things to happen, but merely shows what will happen if changes are not made. This has nothing to do with Yule-time sentimentality's, yet it carries the same feeling of hope and love.I won't underestimate Sandler again. This was a delightful, if bittersweet, surprise.It rates a 7.6/10 from...the Fiend :.",8,1,3,8 April 2007
Monty Python and the Holy Grail," A Masterpiece.
","Monty Python takes a bit of getting used to, as their comedy company is somewhat of an acquired taste for most Americans who aren't accustomed to the dry British wit featured in these movies. However, they are absolute geniuses of comedy, as is demonstrated here in their first full-length feature film, 'Monty Python and the Holy Grail.' There are excellent and memorable lines, hilarious dialog, and intentionally cheesy acting, combined to give you the laugh of the Dark Ages.King Arthur and his lowest-budgeted knights set off on their legendary quest for the Holy Grail. What they find, instead, is series of mishaps, antics, and outright hilariously idiotic stumbling-blocks.I highly suggest seeing this on the Special Edition DVD (KILLER RABBIT-ON!). There are added features you will undoubtedly enjoy.'I...fart in your general direction! Your mother was a hamster and your father...smelt...of...ELDERBERRIES ~! Now go away, or I shall taunt you a second time!' (John Cleese as the French Taunter.) It rates a smooth 9.8/10 from...the Fiend :.",10,7,12,31 December 2003
Star Wars: Episode V - The Empire Strikes Back," AS Good !!
","Is it possible that this is even better than Star Wars: Episode IV? This chapter of the Star Wars saga is unique in that it is neither directed, nor written by Luca$. Irvin Kershner directs and Leigh Brackett & Lawrence Kasdan are the credited writers of this screenplay. I consider that is why it is widely thought of as the best of the OT: Luca$ neither directed, nor wrote it. This is perhaps one of the most successful sequels of all time. While it rates an 8.7/10 at the Internet Movie Database, and IV rated an 8.8/10, there is a large school of thought whereby the idea is expressed that this installment of the Luca$ Money Machine is superior to the original. I must say that I subscribe to this notion. The story featured is darker, while maintaining the same charm and enjoyability as Episode IV. There is less action and more story, and that is fine by me. I was as enchanted by the plot as I was roused by the action. There are no obvious plot holes (at least, not yet. Episode III has not yet been released); no contrivances. Everything fits nicely into its place and feels properly nestled within. There has been much speculation as to the meaning of Yoda's words to Obi-Wan concerning 'the other.' 'That boy is our last hope.' Obi-Wan 'No. There is another.' Yoda Most casual fans of this franchise, affectionately known as the Luca$ $tar War$ $aga or the Luca$ Money Machine, tend to believe that Yoda refers to Leia in that statement, and indeed, Obi-Wan does confirm that it was Leia about whom Yoda spoke. But I have always had another thought about that. Since there are further Star Wars stories, not to mention countless novels produced in the genre of 'fan fiction,' and an enormous Expanded Universe, I am a bit timid to discuss my feelings here, but will force myself to expound upon my thoughts as a means of catharsis, if for no other reason. I believe Yoda referred to Han Solo. I have two reasons. There are more, to be sure, but I will detail only two; the most poignant, in my opinion. First, to activate the light saber, one must possess the proper mindset; that of a Jedi. Whether it is because of metichlorine-filled blood, a state of heart, or a Gods-given gift, that ability belongs to a Jedi alone. Joe-Blow from down the road couldn't activate a light saber. But Han did, in this Episode, when cutting open the Ton-Ton to save Captain Solo's life in the frozen wastelands of Hoth.Second. Han Solo has the ability to navigate a rather large freighter through an asteroid belt, with the controls set to 'manual.' This type of ability was demonstrated in Episode IV to effectively demonstrate Luke's growing abilities as a Jedi.Han and Leia's relationship deepens, Chewy has a few pivotal scenes (his part is much more vocal and present in this chapter), and our favorite Droids are given the full star treatment. As I mentioned earlier, the theme here is much darker than was Episode IV. Lord Vader's copious presence goes a long way towards furthering that goal, as does the lighting, tone and mood of the musical score. The stormtroopers somehow seem more menacing, and Carrie Fisher's performance abilities seem to have doubled from her first Star Wars attempt. Mark Hamill's Luke Skywalker finally earns that battle scene with Vader which was promised in the first installment (or fourth, whatever), and we see the return of Obi-Wan (kind of).It is amusing to see Yoda play the part of a troublesome creature while testing Skywalker's demeanor and potential. Once he makes his determinations surrounding Skywlaker's training, his changes in tone and behavior back to that of the Jedi Master he is, were obvious. It was quite endearing to see him that way: Apparently made feral by the wild swampy jungle in which he dwells. And then to discover it was all just an act. Beautifully done. While this chapter appears at first viewing to depend completely upon the fourth and sixth Episodes for support, Episode V does have a noticeable beginning, climax, and ending. The elements of that beginning, climax, and ending; however, do depend upon those other Episodes to explain it and uplift it. You must subscribe to the mindset of the fourth chapter in order to comprehend the subtle meanings of what takes place. Without knowledge of Episode IV, this is just another popcorn movie. An incredibly done popcorn movie, but a popcorn movie, nonetheless. But with that knowledge, this movie is instantly elevated to that of the 'Superior Sequel' in that the story is far richer, the execution feels much more natural, and the conclusion is an excellent cliffhanger even though there is an obvious end.While it is superior, it lacks the level of newness the original possessed. It receives a well-earned 9.8/10 from... the Fiend :.",10,0,0,18 March 2007
Aladdin," One of Disney's Best Animated Features.
","I'll have to say that, although this work features lovingly created and developed characters, an excellent score with Disney music I actually didn't hate, and a prolific use of vivid colors, which I loved, the one factor that made this totally work for Disney was Robin Williams.I won't spoil this for you if you haven't seen it, but I will say that this is one GOOD Disney movie. It rates up there with the Lion King, Finding Nemo, Atlantis, Snow White, and Cinderella. If you are a fan of Disney's animated features, and haven't seen this one, you are missing out.This is one of Disney's best, and as such, rates an 8.8/10 from...the Fiend :.",9,1,2,21 March 2007
Gangs of New York," Too blustery and overblown to be entertaining
","This remake of the 1938 Cruze film of the same title, seems rather over-wrought, pondered too deeply, and executed with an epic stylization which this work frankly did not deserve.While it is entertaining for a while, about half way through, you realize that the story, while poignant, is grossly overdone. So much so, in fact, that it virtually falls apart right before your eyes. 'Those five points is a finger. When I close my hand, it becomes a fist.' Well duh! With 'winning' dialog like that, what ever made me think it was trite?!DiCaprio is more than adequate in his portrayal, but this film honestly did not rate his efforts. Anyone could have played the part of Amsterdam Vallon just as well. While I am not a fan of DiCaprio's, I find that I am a fan of his work. His style is honest and forthright, giving both fans and casual viewers a frank and easy avenue through which to appreciate his work.But as I said, this work did not rate his performance, as it was too blustery and overblown to be entertaining.It rates a 6.3/10 from...the Fiend :.",6,1,2,1 February 2005
The Breakfast Club," Another Over-rated 80's Feel Good Flick
","I can't say I hate this work, but I definitely think it's just another over-rated feel-good flick from a lost era. It has its cute elements, some good moments, and an overall entertaining story, but if you weren't in high school in the 1980's, or aren't in high school now with a longing for the 1980's, you'll find this one boring, dated, cliché as all heck, and a bit contrived, trite, and long-winded. It rambles in its sugar-coated sweetness, headed seemingly nowhere, going nowhere, and landing you nowhere for your trouble. It does have its entertaining moments, some sweet moments, and some good elements, but they deliver little pay off for your trouble.I can't say I love it, but I don't totally hate it, either.

Gladiator," Not Great, But Good, IN SPITE Of Crowe's Involvement!
","Let me begin by saying that I believe this movie deserved the awards it won, but not because of Russell Crowe. Mainly, this was a good movie because of Ridley Scott and Joaquin Phoenix, who had to work AROUND Crowe, and support his performance, in order for his 'work' to even be watchable, much less steal an Oscar for the best leading male role. He SO didn't deserve that.I also have to admit that I did NOT agree that Gladiator was the best movie of 2000. I thought that award should have gone to Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon. Now THAT was a film! Other than my misgivings surrounding Crowe's inept performance and the fact that he did not deserve the awards he won, Gladiator is still enjoyable; despite Crowe's involvement, however, NOT because of it.Joaquin Phoenix is GREAT in this film and makes it well worth watching.It rates a 6.6/10 from...the Fiend :.",7,2,6,31 May 2007
Contact," Enjoyable, though not for all ages.
","The controversy generated by this movie is astounding. Many claim that the ages-old battle between Church and Science, began with Carl Sagan; an outrageous lie of ignorance, at best. The fundamental differences in belief go back as far as the days of Constantine and court magicians. Alchemists were persecuted by the Church for heretical acts, and ... oh, but this is useless.This film goes a long way towards outlining the governmental interferences known to take place between ufologists and 'real' scientists who, infuriatingly, side with the Church where extraterrestrial life is concerned...or they did until the last few years. Now, it is considered acceptable to admit that there 'may be' other life out there, and many of Sagan's theories are considered an axiom today, such as his often-quoted philosophy, that '...if humans are the only life in the universe it would be a terrible waste of space.' At the heart of Contact, you are taken along one woman's journey to self-discovery, but all around her, others are making their own discoveries, even if they are too selfish and duplicitous to share them with her. Often, in real life, these people are just too self-involved to realize that they have HAD an epiphany and it soon goes away.But at any rate, Contact delivers awesome entertainment, some poignant drama, and a fluid and stylistic presentation from Sagan and Zemeckis. It's a bit dated, but not so much as to detract from one's enjoyment. This is a really good movie, with a decent budget, and it enjoys an impressive rating here at IMDb (to be so preachy). I would say it would be a decent Friday/Saturday night's viewing, as long as the subject matter is appealing to the audience.Foster delivers a genuine performance in which the viewer has no choice but to subscribe to her character, and become embroiled in her intrigue. A top row performance, but I have never seen Foster give any less, even as a child star.Fichtner is a tremendous talent as a character actor, and he does not fail herein to engage. You should check out some of his other, more flamboyant, performances. That man can ACT! It was lovely to see him again.I found it enjoyable, though not for all ages, as some portions and aspects of the story may confuse and/or distress younger viewers.It rates a 7.8/10 from...the Fiend :.",8,2,5,16 April 2008
Donnie Darko," More clever than the Butterfly Effect
","First, I want to know how a Drew Barrymore movie got past me. This is a very deep, intellectual demonstration of the inner workings of the human mind and imagination. This is a very good rendition of what happens to the gifted young who are not taught to keep their light hidden from the 'straights.' From time to time, one like Donnie Darko emerges from the primordial cesspool that is our genetic makeup; one who can see, hear and know of when's and where's which are not this reality.Children like him are invariably medicated and caged...or worse.While this is not the only movie to speak of children of this kind (Powder, Warlock 2, Firestarter, The Sixth Sense, and yes, even Harry Potter on some level), this has to be one of the most creative twists to this vein I've ever seen. This story is simply astounding.This movie shows the human condition within our society. Why people sometimes make the really bad choices. How sometimes that 'thing' in your head doesn't go off and scream 'BAD FREAKING IDEA!' Why suicide sometimes occurs. Why sometimes a person would stop fighting for a better life and just...surrender to the one that is.It also shows that by going back to undo the bad things in our lives, we will also undo the good, leave those who loved us feeling empty and alone, and somehow miss out on this reality and hopes of something better in the face of insurmountable odds.I won't spoil this by telling the end. But wow...if this does not leave you feeling 'disturbed,' nothing will. This is every bit as quirky and darkly startling as 'May.' That's all I can say, except that this was one of the best movies of this kind I have ever seen.On the B scale (which you don't notice, by the way), it rates a 9.1/10.On the A scale, it rates a 7.7/10 from...the Fiend :.",8,19,35,29 March 2004
The Wedding Singer," One of Adam's Best RomComs!
","Okay, I have to start by saying I really do enjoy 50 First Dates better, in spite of Rob Schneider, but The Wedding Singer is a very good Romantic Comedy. In fact, this is one of the best since the Meg Ryan RomCom run ended.I'm not typically one for romantic comedies, or at least I wasn't, but I still found this exceptional, especially for an Adam Sandler movie. But having said that, I must interject that Drew Barrymore is a dream. She brings joy to almost anything she's in.This one is above the norm for this type of movie, and was actually enjoyable, beyond what one would normally expect.It rates an 8.2/10 on the RomCom Scale from...the Fiend :.",8,1,1,23 March 2007
The Pursuit of Happyness," Great Father/Son Movie, but Not Much Else.
","As the Summary indicates, this work is a fantastic bonding work for fathers and sons, and some may find it uplifting or inspiring. For those people, I'm glad. I found it more or less depressingly disquieting. It left me, and those with me, wondering what was the point of the movie? The point, I'm sure, was to tell the story of the lead character. However, I didn't find it uplifting, inspiring, or entertaining.I felt like I'd wasted my time and money. I hope this does not portent Will Smith's future works, as I typically enjoy his endeavors. We certainly don't want what's happened to Eddie Murphy's career, to happen to Will's!It rates a 6.8/10 from...the Fiend :.",7,0,2,9 March 2007
Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade," Not as wonderful as the first two, but still enjoyable.
","This installment of an otherwise successful run of movies was the most contrived piece of garbage I've ever seen. They tried to explain the scar on Indiana's chin, his fear of snakes, his style of dress, and his love of all things arcane, in the first ten or fifteen minutes of the movie, and frankly, it just didn't work for me. As much as I loved the first two of these installments, this one just left me cold. After that ten minutes, however, things did get better..for a while.I found Sean Connery's character's need to debase our hero, to be trite and just wrong. I hated it, in fact. I cared not for his ramblings, considering his son had all this field experience, and he obviously was more at home in a museum. Heck, at his age, he could almost be an exhibit. I really detested the way they used Connery to lower our estimation of Ford's character. I would have liked it better had they worked together, rather than having been written to constantly go at one another. It devalued the whole franchise for me. The whole movie was not awful, but this was the first installment with which I had any issues whatsoever. The next thing I found wrong with this attempt was that they went back to the Germans again, rather than moving on to something new. The relic for which Indiana Jones is searching is new, but the story was more of an attempt to redeem themselves after the gore of The Temple of Doom. I frankly did not mind the gore; that story and execution of that story was excellently done.So, okay, it is the Germans again. Nothing we can do about that. And, again, the artifact is a Christian artifact. What with all the wonderful legendary relics of our richly documented mythological ancestries, why go back to something that has already been touched upon? This is more like a remaking of the Raiders of the Lost Ark, than a new installment.What about the lost library of Alexandria? What about Atlantis? What about the Bermuda Triangle? Stonehenge? The Isle of White? Easter Island? The literal thousands of mysteries in Carnac, Cairo, or Thebes, such as the Great Sphinx and the secret room which is supposed to be hidden there? The headpiece of Isis which was supposed to show the gateway to the heavens, and so on? Why go back to the same original formula of the first, only to end the franchise there? If they were setting up for a new run, then I could see going back to the beginning, but this was not the beginning of a new run. This was the end of the run. So I fail to conceive of why they would copy the first movie so closely in both specifics AND generalities. I can understand why they would feel the need, perhaps, for deeper character development with Jones and his father, hence their bringing in Connery to debase Indiana and make us view him in a lesser light. But again, that is in the case of the beginning of a new run, but as I said, this was the end of the run, so why DO that? We loved the character just fine, without the in-depth character development, and certainly without being made to feel sorry for his character by being subjected to an unappreciative father's constant haranguing. I simply do not see the reasoning behind it. It lowered my entire estimation of this movie, something fierce. Where this final chapter could have been great, it was simply...okay, and rather a disappointment. I was glad this was to be the last of the Indiana Jones movies, if that was what they were reduced to. There are some good elements here, please do not get me wrong. The movie was still moderately enjoyable. The mysteries and intrigues were craftily written, the dialog was witty and clever, and the effects were excellent Lucas/Spielberg fare. I just found Connery's noisome presence to be totally undesirable and unnecessary.But now, as of this writing, at any rate (01/01/04), there are plans to do another installment, with Ford, at the ripe old age of 62. I must really say, 'I have doubts.' If his latest film, 'Hollywood Homicide' is any indication, I will have to say that they will be much better off leaving him in the university, this time. It was truly sad to witness his performance in that movie. He ~fell down~ more than he pulled his gun! I was very disheartened to see him like that. With 'What Lies Beneath,' at least they had a new genre for him, something which would allow him to gracefully age into ultra-maturity. But no, they could not leave it at that. It will take over a year for them to film Indiana Jones 4, what with having to stop every few minutes, to let Ford catch his breath and freshen up. But with the problematic script and postponement after postponement, they may end up scrapping this movie all together. I DO hope so. But if I'm wrong, I hope they leave Connery out of this next one.Regardless of its short-comings, it still earns an 7.4 from...the Fiend :.",7,4,7,1 January 2004
Back to the Future," Charming cult classic
","This is one of the few cult classics which deserves its status. It is a fun popcorn movie which does not take itself too seriously. A teenager-oriented flick, as was the norm of the 1980's, which holds fond memories for many of that era.It's become trendy to point out all the discrepancies in the science of this sci-fi/comedy, but they do not matter one bit to the casual movie goer, who will plug in this flick with a bowl of popcorn and lean back in that recliner for an hour and a half of good, wholesome family fun. And, frankly, they don't matter to me, either. This is not one of those sci-fi movies which demands that the science be put into the story in order for it to work. This works beautifully for the ~lack~ of the science. There is nothing to muddle the pace, mess with the timing of the comedic delivery, nor throw off the dramatic sequences.It is a very satisfying 'coming of age' movie.All in all this is a very enjoyable and entertaining film which rates an 8.4/10 from...the Fiend :.",8,2,4,22 January 2005
The Birds," Creepy Little Flick
","This one starts out slowly, but that's just to get you in the mood to have yourself creeped out all the way. It'll be a little while before you can look to the skies and appreciate the birds for their beauty and song, rather than in suspicion and a certain level of wariness.The performances are riveting, the atmosphere is high, and the payoff is magnificent. Jessica Tandy, Tippi Hedron, Suzanne Pleshette, and Rod Taylor. If you're a fan of suspense, creature features, or Hitchcock, this is a must-see.It rates an 8.3/10 from...the Fiend :.",8,1,3,21 March 2007
Cinderella Man," Cinderella Man?
","This was a horrid, overdone, over-sentimentalized, over-written piece of garbage. Russell Crowe was terrible in this! He came off like he was trying to prove something, and in so doing seemed to swagger across the screen one minute, and drunkenly waltz back, the next.His delivery of dialog was as plastic as anything in the Barbie World, and he seemed to be lost and confused throughout much of his performance. Quite honestly, his screen time seems to be a total waste, this time around. This was a complete waste of time and resources, but I won't grieve the time it took for me to swallow this terrible film, nor the time I wasted writing this review.This was a REAL stinker.It rates a 1.0/10 from...the Fiend :.",1,10,30,21 March 2007
Jurassic Park," Horror hits the mainstream!!
","This movie has every known ingredient for a long-running, well-loved, top money-making cinematic success: a deeply developed, lovable cast of characters; a creatively written and very well developed script; sound, believable dialog; totally realistic, imaginative effects; an awe-inspiring soundtrack; superb direction; good, solid, workable CGI creations; wonderful sets which inspire the imagination; and an excellent group of professional, lovable actors.The first time I saw this movie, I was in absolute awe of the dinosaurs. I could not believe how well they were done. I felt like I was right there, in that clearing with Alan Grant and Ellie Sattler, seeing them live, for the first time. I was actually...moved.I must admit that I have not always loved everything Spielberg has directed, but this is definitely one of my all-time favorites. It inspires the imagination, boggles the mind, and teases the child in all of us with the wonderful creation of these magnificent creatures. In this Fiend's opinion, ILM is the very best effects company there is. I admire their founder, and the visual images they create, and these creations were certainly no exception.Plot: InGen has created clones of many species of extinct dinosaurs in an attempt to engineer the world's first dinosaur theme park ergo the movie's title, 'Jurassic Park.' In order to obtain approval from the investors for the park's opening, Hammond, the CEO, has to solicit the nod from a diverse team of outside experts. Dr. Ellie Sattler (Laura Dern), Dr. Alan Grant (Sam Neill), Dr. Ian Malcolm (Jeff Goldblum), accompanied by the 'blood-sucking' lawyer representing the board of investigators and Hammond's own grandchildren, take the official 'tour' of Jurassic Park, but nothing seems to go right.'So...eventually you're going to have DINOSAURS on your dinosaur tour? Right? Yes? Hello?' Ian Malcolm.'I do HATE that man!' John Hammond.Then, something goes decidedly wrong! Sabotaged by one of his own family, Hammond's security is down, and the electrified fences containing these creations is turned off. Before anyone can get them back online, chaos commences. But the party of experts, Hammond's grandchildren and the lawyer are caught behind enemy lines.The question now, is no longer will they endorse it, but will they survive Jurassic Park? I absolutely LOVE this movie. The close-ups of the details created by ILM on the dinosaurs were absolutely wonderful, believable and outright realistic.As far as adaptations go Michael Crichton wrote the screenplay himself, so regardless of my personal feelings, I accept the story to be as close as was workable to the original literary work, though it felt heavily like a 'Westworld' remake...with dinosaurs.It earns a 9.1/10 for actually making it feel real, from...the Fiend :.",9,7,11,30 September 2003
V for Vendetta," Perfection
","This Shakespearean-esquire instant classic gives you a world that appears to be the collaborated work of Edgar Allen Poe, Tim Burton, and Alfred Hitchcock, although it is not.It feels darkly uplifting, while offering you the light. I found this work to be the perfect reflection of a contemporary society (although contemporary time is NOT the setting for this production) on the brink of self destruction via their own attempts to better their existence through the forced sacrifice of others. The main plot demonstrates the vicarious venue of a velvety-voiced villain whose verve and victorious visions vie to vent the vastly varlotous valet of vipers.This work is not merely entertaining, it is thought-provoking and deeply disturbing in a way which almost calls for anarchy from the masses against a totalitarian regime which is run inside the freedoms of Democracy.More drama than anything else, this work delivers great performances, beautiful execution, and a lovely flowing, blood-soaked plot.It rates a 9.7/10 from...the Fiend :.",10,4,8,28 March 2006
Talladega Nights: The Ballad of Ricky Bobby," Redneck Humor At Its Best
","Of all the films Farrell has done, this is, by my estimate, the second good one. The first was Anchorman.Again surrounded by a fantastic supporting cast, Farrell makes good in this irreverent (but closer than some would like to admit) look at the wonderful world of NASCAR, and its top driver, Ricky Bobby.This work is not smart. It's not clever. It's not intelligent. It IS funny, in the base, crass, gutter kind of way most of the world will expect of the American Redneck way of life. There are no surprises, few effects.It IS tragically funny. The character of Rick Bobby, his life, his marriage, his career, and everything surrounding him is a train wreck that you just have to watch until it slams into the wall of Life and self-destructs into a million pieces...In that respect, this movie does not disappoint.It rates a 6.6/10 from...the Fiend :.",7,0,2,23 March 2007
