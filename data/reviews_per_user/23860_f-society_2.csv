Ghost," One ghost movie to rule them all!
","This movie has everything a ghost movie should have. There were no cheap sound effects or graphic effects that 'tries' to scare you when you are asleep during the movie (like cheap ghost movies nowadays).This movie has a good story, good special effects, good actors, good and haunting music, what more could you ask? Forever classic. One ghost movie to rule them all!I could easily say that this movie had built groundwork for movies like The Matrix and some. Patrick Swayze, Demi More and Whoopi Goldberg' DEFINING/BEST roles!A MUST FOR ALL GHOST MOVIE FANS!!Highly recommended!",10,6,9,29 August 2005
Cube," Instant Masterpiece
","This is very underrated movie! It deserves more good reviews than it has currently.The film is pretty intense and it holds your breath the whole time. You can't predict what is going to happen next. If you like The Matrix (1999) or Vertical Limit (year?), then you will definitely like this! But I should warn you that this is **strictly** SCI-FCI genre and if you are not willing to 'think' during the movie, this is NOT for you, just stay away.What more can I say? You have to see it for yourself to experience 'The Cube'!10/10",10,1,2,27 June 2004
