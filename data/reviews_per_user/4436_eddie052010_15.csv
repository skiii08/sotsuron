Kill Bill: Vol. 2," I'm going slightly mad.
","When sequels are usually released, they are often rubbish, as they are merely cash-ins on the original's success and while they often suck, they usually aren't abysmally bad, ad they are more often lazy than anything else. Sadly, this is a case when the sequel to an already dreadful original is so bad, it makes the original look like a masterpiece by comparison.The story is that The Bride is still on her bloody revenge, and is now after the head honcho, Bill. However, due to the many obstacles that get in her way, including Bill's bodyguards and the reunion with her daughter, will she be able to kill Bill? My problem with the story is that it is very badly written, from the constant plot holes (e.g. why does the Bride bring a sword with her everywhere she goes, despite facing potentially armed men), useless characters and even more pointless footage than last time. While it is nice to see her training montage or her wedding rehearsal before the massacre in theory, they serve to show things that either the audience already knows, or doesn't care to. Seriously, you could cut huge chunks out of both films, and lump them together as one, and it would be a better film because of it.Another huge problem is the unsympathetic main character, as despite her understandable motivations for her revenge, she is a sadistic sociopath who kills because it gives her pleasure rather than for revenge, and who doesn't have any remorse for her victims, which (despite what some feminists might have believe) isn't a good role model for the young women potentially watching this movie. What makes this worse however is the fact that when she reunites with her daughter after so long, you don't feel any sympathy, as not only do you feel that she would be an awful mother to the child (something she even admits to by saying that she can never live a normal life), but considering that she killed a mother in front of her 4- year old daughter in the previous film, it is even harder to swallow. It doesn't help that her character is never fully developed either, which makes the film hard to watch as a result.The main bad guy, Bill, is equally as dull, feeling constantly one- note throughout and gets rather boring because of it, despite David Carradine's great performance, and he often gets the movie's worst lines, including a theory that the Bride is a killer on the inside, and wears her more mature self as a disguise similar to Superman (because as we all know, people like soldiers are always destined to kill people, as they do it on the frontlines). One thing that is very annoying is that while some of the characters are completely pointless, they are the best ones in the film, in particular Michael Madsen's Bud, Gordon Liu's Samurai master or Deryl Hannah's Elle, who is easily the best thing about the film, as the character had the most personality, and Deryl's performance is both charismatic and sexy. You would wish the film was about them than some crazy sociopath, but that isn't the case, and sadly they are usually killed the quickest as well. The more personality you have in the film, the quicker you are killed. The rest of the script is completely lacklustre as well, as outside of all the plot problems, the film's dialogue is overdone and often ridiculous. While Tarantino's unique style of dialogue may have worked in Pulp Fiction or Reservoir Dogs, here it is utterly inane, as unlike the aforementioned films, it isn't funny, quirky or essential to the story, leading to a lot of long winded pointless scenes that make the film feel a lot longer than it is. This story clearly didn't need two parts to tell it, and Tarantino should actually edit his films before he releases them. It is also casually sadistic as well, as eyes are pulled out and stepped on, a man gets bitten by a snake over and over and a blind woman runs around screaming in agony. It feels very crass as a result, and you would wish Tarantino would grow up already. It also doesn't help that many of the film's major set pieces don't pay off, as they are either too brief or are interrupted by the boring story. This is especially true of the film's climax.While there are some good elements in the film (good acting and great cinematography for example), overall it is utter crud. Whether it would be the awful writing, unsympathetic characters, sadism, overlong and pointless bits or the utter anticlimax, Kill Bill Vol 2 is an abysmal movie-making experience, that everyone should avoid at all costs in order to stop letting Tarantino's Samurai fan-fics get millions of dollars and well known actors behind it, and to teach him to make proper, grown-up films next time. Complete and utter garbage.",1,2,4,26 February 2015
The Hunger Games: Mockingjay - Part 1," The best of the series so far.
","After watching a film, many people will have many different reactions to it, whether it be one of joy or one of hatred. Other times however, another reaction to a film could be one of disappointment. Whether it be the film not living up to its hype and potential or seeming like a film that was too big to fail, there are many films that while not overall bad, are considered major disappointments. Many would tell you that this film would be a continuation of this trend, due to being overlong, slow and not much payoff, as well as being a supposed weak follow-up to the previous films (which admittedly aren't great films to begin with). The film is a lot better than many give it credit for however, and is definitely the best of the series so far.The story is that after the events of the previous film, Katniss has gone into hiding along with her family and the rest of the rebels who are planning to overthrow the capital. One way they'll try to do this is through propaganda videos, using Katniss' image as the Mockingjay in order to inspire rebellion in the other districts. However, with her allies at risk and the closing in on the rebels, will she give in?The plot development is the best of the series yet, as despite not moving at the same quick pace as the previous films (mainly due to how the film is mostly set inside a bunker), in place of it, there is a lot more attention paid on character, story and themes that the other films lacked.Firstly, all of the characters are well developed. Katniss finally forms into a three dimensional character at this point, and is a lot more interesting this time round. We see her interact with her family, her close friends and the rebels, and because of the amount of time spent on her, we become more sympathetic towards her cause, as she is no longer the whiny and annoying character as seen before, but as a caring, bold and rebellious young woman with a lot of internal conflict to deal with, due to her struggles with her image as the Mockingjay and how it affects everyone around her. Her character is much more rounded this time round, and Jennifer Lawrence gives it her all, clearly showing that after her previous below par performances in the other films, she is fully comfortable in her role. The supporting cast are all around great as well.Another thing that is really well done is the themes, as they are delivered in a more subtle way this time round, in particular, the idea of the rebels being as bad as the Capitol, considering how they use propaganda and terrorist attacks to inspire rebellion, but arguably are no better than the Capitol, who use similar tactics against the rebels, and in the process, both sides take major losses. It's a very clever idea that's well handled that gives the series more depth than it did previously. The action in the film is also well done, as there is none of the shaky cam nonsense of the previous films, but now scenes which are well shot and paced and have a strong sense of tension throughout. This is helped by the fact that the villains this time around feel a lot more threatening, with many scenes showing how ruthless they can be, with the highlight of these scenes being Katniss returning to District 12 and finding the place to be completely in ruins, eventually stumbling across skulls and other body parts in the rubble. It is due to this that the villains feel much more intimidating this time round, which makes you even more invested and caring towards the main characters. However, despite many positive attributes, there are still some problems. Despite the increased threat that the villains have, Donald Sutherland still feels widely miscast as President Snow, delivers a goofy performance that would be more appropriate of the Adam West Batman show of the 60's, rather than a dark and gritty film like this. Luckily, he doesn't have much screen time, but kills the mood when on screen. There is also some really unfunny comic relief as well, particularly in the case of Katniss' cat and while humour is needed to calm the audience after so much action and dark moments, the comic relief sometimes goes too silly for its own good, and once again ruins the tone. But outside of that, this film was fantastic. After the below par efforts previously, this sequel finally gives the series the jab in the arm it needed in order to truly take off, with a great story, strong characters that you care about, subtle themes and humour and a lot of exciting action with a lot of tension throughout. While not succeeding in every area, this film is something everyone should see as it is truly great cinema. Ignore the naysayers and check this movie out.",8,0,10,10 February 2015
Inglourious Basterds," A slight return to form for Tarantino, but there are still problems.
","Quentin Tarantino. While the majority of people would tell you that he is a genius filmmaker who hasn't one bad film to his name, there is a small, but vocal minority who will tell you that while he is talented, he hasn't made anything fantastic for a while. Sure, Reservoir Dogs and Pulp Fiction are masterpieces and Jackie Brown is his most mature work, but his other work has been deeply disappointing to say the least. The Kill Bill movies were self- indulgent, badly written and overly sadistic, and Death Proof was just boring. So would Inglourious Basterds be a late return to form? Well, while good, it doesn't present Tarantino at his best, and the film is still problematic as a whole.The story is that during their occupation of France, the Nazis premiere a propaganda film at a theater to celebrate their achievements. When this is found out, many use this as a plan to kill the Nazis once and for all, including the British army, the theater's owner Shoshanna who has a vendetta against the Nazis and a group known as the Basterds, a bunch of American Jews who have traveled to France in order to kill Nazis. While the plot is non-linear like Tarantino's other films, it suffers from the fact that there is a lot of pointless material in the film. Many characters who have no effect on the story are killed off, some scenes go on for way too long & some of the protagonists are deeply unlikable. This mainly implies to the Basterds themselves, who despite their cause, are portrayed as sadistic psychopaths who kill and torture many Nazis, despite some of the Nazis having legitimate grievances (i.e. having a child, keeping quiet to protect their fellow men). I'm not expecting a film like this to portray Nazis with Downfall-esque sympathy, but considering that most of the Nazis in the film are shown to be more human than in other films, the constant sadism feels unnecessary, and you can't help but feel that the Basterds are no better than the Nazis themselves.The film's sadism is a major problem. Tarantino has a weird love for extreme violence, which would be fine provided that this was a more tongue in cheek context, but considering that the movie has a mostly straight face, you can't help but feel that the movie goes too far in places. This includes cutting the scalps off Nazis, beating them to death with baseball bats, torturing an innocent witness by sticking their fingers into a bullet wound and seeing someone get strangled to death, made even more disturbing by how it is partially real (Tarantino actually strangled one of his actresses to make the film look more real). Lovely. It's a shame that the film is bogged down by being overly long and overly sadistic, as there is some great stuff in there. As many others have pointed out, the opening scene is brilliant. Great acting, dialogue, cinematography and pacing. It's also a perfect example of how Tarantino should use his unique brand of dialogue, to be quirky and advance the story, instead of using it to ramble. It's definitely the best scene in the film, and continues 2009's tradition of having great opening scenes (i.e. Watchmen, Up) in films. On top of this, some of the characters are very well done. Shoshanna is the best character in the film, being the most three-dimensional and interesting, and her story arc in the film is the most compelling because of it, essentially being the brilliant female revenge story that Kill Bill should have been. You just wish the whole movie was focused on her, but still, her scenes are where the film reaches its peak, and Melanie Laurent delivers one of the best (and sadly underrated) performances in recent memory. It's also a very well- made film. The cinematography is gorgeous, the sets and production design are well done, and the acting is very good from everybody, even though I feel that some are wasted, mainly that of Brad Pitt and Christoph Waltz, the latter of whom does the absolute best with a weak character. If you want to see him at his best, watch The Zero Theorem instead. It's because of these things that I feel that while Inglourious Basterds is a slight return to form for Tarantino, it's still dragged down by many of Tarantino's usual faults. From the overly sadistic violence of the film, to the overlong running time, to the self-indulgent touches to the film (i.e. having a Mike Myers cameo, or Samuel L. Jackson as a narrator, clearly his easiest paycheck yet), the film's positive attributes, while present, are still balanced out by the film's many faults. It's definitely a step forward, but there's still some work to be done.",6,5,7,19 March 2015
The Hunger Games," Don't listen to the critics.
","Over the years, there have been many films that have been seen as classics of their genre, due to their critical and commercial success as well as fan support. However, this doesn't represent everybody, as there will inevitably be backlash against the film, and those people would feel that the film in question is overrated. Casein point, The Hunger Games, as while there are some good elements here and there, it seems surprising that a film so derivative, lazily written and overall quite weak would be praised as much as it has, and is one of the most overrated films over the past few years because of it. The plot is that after volunteering instead of her sister, Katniss Everdeen takes part in The Hunger Games, a show that consists of young people fighting each other to the death for the sake of entertainment. When at the games, Katniss will do anything in her power in order to survive. If you feel that that synopsis sounds familiar, that's because it has blatantly been recycled from films like Battle Royale and The Running Man. If the film wasn't derivative enough already by this point, it also rips off bits from other films (like the authoritarian city from 1984 or the chase scenes from Apocalypto) in order to tell its story.The writing is also undermined by other factors as well, like the multiple plot holes within the story, like why do the Capitol let two people live despite being intent on killing everyone else, or why Rue's district starts rioting, despite having their tributes killed for the past seven and half decades. It also lacks any sort of fundamental character development, leading to characters who are two-dimensional at best and at worst, quite boring and unsympathetic.The latter of that definitely applies to Katniss, partly due to her poor writing, and the other part due to Jennifer Lawrence's poor performance, as while her character is meant to a strong, independent young woman with a dark past, Lawrence acts like a bored, whiny teenager who's upset that her Ipod ran out of charge. It makes her completely disengaged from the audience, as since she doesn't seem to care about her predicament, it makes the viewer question why they should care either. Thankfully, the rest of the acting is perfectly fine, but their character writing is still quite weak. The most notable example of this is when a character called Rue is killed off, and despite the fact that she has only five minutes of screen time or so, the audience is supposed to be shocked and saddened by her death.It doesn't help that the film is constantly switching tone, and it becomes distracting after a while. At the beginning, the tone is serious and downbeat, and the setting of the film reflects this perfectly, with its muted colours and overall depressing mood. However, later scenes in the Capitol (where the Hunger Games takes place) are completely the opposite, with bright colours and people being dressed up like they had escaped from a Dr. Suess book. I understand that this is meant to be a juxtaposition on the rich and the poor, and how greedy the former truly are, but due to the film's serious tone, this part of the film feels overly cartoony and it becomes harder to take seriously as a result, something made even worse by the hugely unconvincing fire and attack dog special effects during the film's major set-pieces.Sure this film has positive attributes, as it is finely acted for the most part, has strong production values and has pretty good action scenes here and there, despite the overused shaky cam technique, but there's not much to recommend the film otherwise. From its unoriginal story, to its badly written script, to its unsympathetic lead, to its bizarre tonal shifts throughout, the Hunger Games is an overall bad film that is only recommended to die- hard fans of the books, but even then I feel that some fans might struggle(due to how superior the books are meant to be). Sure, the sequels are better, but that doesn't wash away the bad taste that the first film left in the mouth.",4,0,1,28 April 2015
Constantine," Devilishly boring.
","Comic book movies. Today, they are some of the most profitable movies around, with franchises like the Marvel Cinematic Universe, Spider- Man and Christopher Nolan's Dark Knight trilogy raking in their millions. Due to the success of these films, many companies want to have a slice of the comic book movie pie and therefore others start to appear, some good (Watchmen) others rubbish (Catwoman, Sin City). This is more on the latter side. While not being completely awful, Constantine is still a below par attempt to cash in on the comic book movie craze, with bad acting, an unoriginal plot and an achingly slow pace to boot.The plot is that cop Angela Dodson (played by Rachel Weisz) is investigating the suspicious death of her sister Isabel, and releases that it may have a more supernatural explanation. She gains the help of Constantine (played by Keanu Reeves), who has personal experience with the supernatural, as he is a demon hunter. Together, they discover a more sinister plot, which could lead to the apocalypse. The plot here is one of the big problems with the film, as it is blatantly unoriginal, and gets really tedious because of it. It steals from films like Alien, Pitch Black, The Prophecy and End of Days, and doesn't come up with enough original ideas to excuse this, especially due its clear intention as a franchise starter.It also doesn't help that the movie's pacing kills any sort of enjoyment you might have. For the majority of the running time, the plot is spoon fed to the audience with long, drawn-out exposition which instead of opening up this new world to the audience, making them feel like they've been lectured for 2 hours. This also means that there's very little action, and when it does come, its bland and really lame, with Keanu Reeves repeatedly shooting demons in slow motion. It's also disappointing that even though hell is brought up a lot in the film, it is barely in the film, not even being used as the setting for the climax, making the film feel more underwhelming. It's like this movie wasn't confident enough to show off its world and what it had to offer, so it just talked about it instead, which is an amateur writing mistake (not surprising, considering the writers previous credits include Suburban Commando and The Glimmer Man). This mistake is a more fatal one considering how this movie wants to be a franchise starter, but its tell don't show structure makes it hard for the audience to care about showing more of the world. Even Twilight, with its silly stories, at least showed off more of its world, making it more open to sequels and makes it more deserving as a franchise starter.Another thing to comment on is the dreadful acting. Keanu Reeves, unsurprisingly is as wooden as ever and Rachel Weisz seems to be more concerned with perfecting her American accent than trying to deliver a great performance. It's such a shame, seeing how the supporting actors, particularly Shia Laboeuf and Tilda Swindon have much more charisma and bring a lot more energy to the film, showing off how much fun they're having in their roles. The characters are also uninteresting as well, and are very two- dimensional at best. It's funny how the writers gave out so much exposition for the plot, that they couldn't give their characters and sorts of interests or any third dimensions in the process. Sure many of Christopher Nolan's films lack in character but at least make up for it with exciting stories and great set-pieces, something which this movie is sorely absent of. Considering its intention as a franchise starter and its huge budget ($100 million) this is flat out inexcusable, and makes the movie miss its mark completely. Overall, this is just a failed attempt as a comic book movie franchise, due to its many faults. If you are looking for a good action movie of biblical proportions, watch The Da Vinci Code or The Prophecy, as they are much more fun and are more worthy of your time. Just leave this boring mess to rot and burn in the fires of hell. After taking away two hours of your life, that is the treatment that it deserves.",4,0,3,21 February 2014
Divergent," Not very divergent, ironically.
","Over the past few years, the young adult novel adaptation has become a popular as shown with the box office success of franchises like Harry Potter, Twilight and The Hunger Games. However, despite the million dollar success of the aforementioned franchises, other attempts to create big franchises based on young adult novels, more often than not fall flat on their faces. This is due to either the fact that they aren't unique enough to stand out (and therefore doesn't get the box office popularity it needs to start a franchise) or are flat out rubbish. This is more of the former. While there is some bright sparks that suggest this franchise has more to offer in future installments, the first part is far too safe, predictable and formulaic to justify it's stance as a film that will lead on to a more interesting franchise.The plot of the film is that Beatrice Prior is living in a future-set dystopian Chicago, which is divided into five factions which are based on the various personalities of the people who live there. These are Abnegation (selfless), Amity (peaceful), Candor (truthful), Erudite (intelligent) and Dauntless (brave). Beatrice Prior, however, is a divergent, a group who are hunted down by the government in order to maintain the peace. In order to hide this, she joins Dauntless, a more militant faction under strict rule. Will she be able to cope by belonging to a single group or will she reveal her divergence.The plot is one of the film's more obvious flaws, seeing as it steals many of its major plot threads from another source. The faction system brings to mind The Hunger Games, but while watching the film you'll start to notice that the film seems to owe more to Philip K. Dick, with much of technology used in the film and the way that the mind is a running theme, seems to have come out from one of his stories. This isn't a huge gripe, seeing as how it is slightly more subtle about it's theft than other franchise starters (Constantine and The Hunger games for instance), but for a film called Divergent, it doesn't seem to be unique enough to truly stand out in order to interest audiences not familiar with the source material.That highlights the major flaw with this movie as a whole: it's far too bland and safe. It's a setup movie at it's worst, something that gladly sets up (some of) the world and characters but is lacking in confidence to truly spread it's wings and soar. The world isn't shown in high detail, the villains here are clearly pawns for a bigger power and on top of this, throughout the majority of the running time, nothing hugely important seems to happen. Sure we find out that the girl here is a divergent and a few major events in her life happen here and there, but for the most part, the movie consists of training segments and montages. Not very exciting stuff is it?It definitely isn't exciting, considering when the action consists of shaky cam, fast editing and close-ups, that ruin the action than make it more intense. It isn't just during the action though, as there are many parts which use gimmicky camera tricks in order to make the movie cooler than it actually is. Casein point, there is a dream section where the camera circles the characters, which could potentially make you feel nauseous.However, there are some good things, that gives this franchise some hope of improving. The acting for the most part is good, even if the main lead is bland, and Kate Winslet is wasted as the villain. The world definitely looks interesting, and the money ($85 million) is clearly on the screen. On top of this, excluding action and certain scenes, the direction is good, and proves that he is great at dramatic set pieces. Despite all of this, the film is clearly lacking in many areas to justify itself as the next big sci-fi franchise.Overall, despite a few high points here and there, the film lacks any punch. Even though things could improve in future entries, the film itself isn't divergent enough (pardon the pun) to stand out and have any staying power as a result.",5,8,15,15 April 2014
La Grande Illusion," Hasn't aged well.
","There are certain films that, due to their strong reputation and historical significance, are supposedly beyond criticism. Citizen Kane, Seven Samurai, 2001, The Godfather and many more are examples of films that despite not being necessarily perfect, many say that they are beyond criticism, and that if you do criticism them, you must discuss what masterpieces they are first. One of those films is Grand Illusion. Considered to be one of the first prison escape movies ever made, the film is meant to be one of the best ever made, for not only being the grand-daddy of prison escape films, but for having great characters, an engaging story and a strong anti-war message laying underneath its skin. However, while it does have many positive attributes, Grand Illusion isn't the masterpiece everyone believes it to be, due to poor narrative and being very overlong.The plot is that after being shot down during an aerial battle, a group of French soldiers are sent to a German prison. Here, they decide to escape, and use many cunning plans in order to do so. That's really all of the story there is here, and while its simple nature makes it seem impossible to screw up, the story is poorly told here. This is due to how there isn't much of a story throughout much of the film, and many scenes consist of characters talking about things not story related or utterly pointless scenes as well (i.e. a scene where the prisoners display a show to the Germans) that should have hit the cutting room floor. Because of this, the film feels very baggy and overlong as a result. It also doesn't help that the character development is quite inconsistent. While I understand that the film is essentially an ensemble piece, there are too many characters for the film to juggle, leading to few characters we care about or are interested in, and many we couldn't care less about. It also doesn't help that there isn't much threat from the villain characters, as they act very friendly towards the heroes and in a later scene when a protagonist dies, the villain tends to his need. Sure, the scene that this leads to is a wonderful moment (something the film sadly has too little of) and it does represent director Jean Renoir's pacifist views but it fails to create any tension or conflict within the story, and if the audience doesn't care about the events on screen, then what's the point of watching?The film isn't a complete disaster though. The film is clearly well made , some of the characters are at least interesting and the cast are excellent, with Jean Gabin, Marcel Dalio & Erich von Stroheim in particular giving standout performances. It is also at least an entertaining experience for the most part, and it is also an interesting watch, as it is compelling to see one of the first prison escape films and to see how it influenced later prison escape films as a whole.It is because of this that while Grand Illusion isn't a complete failure, it is very flawed and it hasn't aged very well, due to its overlong length, barrage of pointless material and lacking any tension or suspense for the most part. However, there are some great moments here and there and the acting is fantastic overall. So in conclusion, what you have is a mediocre film that despite its iconic status is quite problematic. However, it is worth checking out to see one of the forerunners of the prison escape genre, and is occasionally brilliant here and there. If you must get it, get the Criterion version above all others, as it goes into great detail about the film, it's history, cast biographies and Nazi ban. To be honest, the edition gives the film a better treatment than it perhaps deserves.",5,10,14,2 February 2015
Kill Bill: Vol. 1," A lod of self indulgent waffle.
","Vanity projects are usually made by people who, after receiving a lot of praise and support for their work, want to make something that is personal to them and therefore don't really care what anyone thinks of it in the process (usually because they wrongly believe that people will still eat it up due to the artist behind the project rather than the art itself). Sadly, this often means that they are terrible in every sense of the word, due to a lack of quality control. Due to a poor storyline, no character development and a lot of sadistic violence, this film is no exception to this rule.The story is that a woman only known as The Bride has been left in a coma after her old assassin posse knocked her unconscious and killed mostly everyone at her wedding day, including her husband to be and, potentially, her unborn daughter. After awakening from this coma, she seeks bloody revenge against them, killing them one by one. While the story is a simple revenge plot, it becomes overly convoluted as Tarintino adopts a non- linear structure to the film, but unlike his previous films that had a similar structure, some parts of the film lack context to the events on screen, and you feel very lost, as if there was a previous instalment to this that you missed.The rest of the writing is equally inept. None of the characters are very developed, and it is hard to care about anyone because of it. There are also a lot of plot holes throughout the story as well, including how the police never bother showing up despite the violent murders that the Bride commits (I.e killing a doctor but never bothering to hide his body, killing a mother in front of her own daughter, the massacre in the Japanese restaurant at the end) or how Lucy Liu got to the head of the Yazuka (the Japanese mafia) despite having awful bodyguards and fighting skills that are adequate at best. The fact that there are many pointless scenes here as well don't help as they often slow down the story and bore you, mainly the animated scene.Another major problem is how casually the film wallows in its sadistic violence. People are decapitated, eyes are pulled out, people see their families murdered and limps are often cut off. However the violence isn't displayed in an OTT manner, but rather in a more serious way with people screaming in agony and wriggling around like worms when their legs are chopped off. That isn't fun violence but rather deeply unpleasant and needless carnage. It strikes me as odd how the game Manhunt (released at a similar time) is yelled at for being too violent, but no-one bats an eye at this, despite it being perhaps worse, as unlike Manhunt it lacks any context and is just sadism for sadism's sake. Sadism also extends to other areas as well, like a doctor who rapes comatose patients and a guy getting his head slammed into a door for information. It's utterly grotesque and while not morally bankrupt like Natural Born Killers is per say, still makes you feel dirty after seeing it.There are some good things here to though, mainly that of the production design. Sets are gorgeous and are beautifully shot, and the HD version I saw makes them feel more alive and colourful. The soundtrack by Wu-Tang Clan rapper RZA is great too, and compliments the Asain influences of the film very well. The acting is also quite good, with all actors giving much better performances than the film deserves.Sadly however, those good things don't make a whole, as the film's flaws completely sink it, due to poor storytelling, characters and handling of violence, becoming sadistic for the sake of it. It is because of this that I would find it very hard to recommend Kill Bill to anyone, except die hard Tarantino fans and adolescents nitwits who don't know any better. Tarantino is a great filmmaker, and he can do so much better than this slock, but thanks to a complete lack of scrutiny and quality control, he wastes his talent on self indulgent vanity projects like this. Critics and audiences many continue to dump praise onto this based on the goodwill Tarantino earned through his early work, but the awfulness of work like this demonstrates that goodwill doesn't excuse dreadful dreck. Avoid at all costs.",2,6,9,25 February 2015
From Dusk Till Dawn," A perfect Friday night movie, but not much else.
","Vampire movies are very hit or miss, as for every Nosferatu or Blade, there is a Twilight: Breaking Dawn or Abraham Lincoln: Vampire Hunter rearing its ugly head around the corner. So, with a strong budget, cast and writing/directing team of Quentin Tarantino and Robert Rodriguez behind it, how does this one fare? To be honest, very averagly, as despite some great things, there isn't much that this movie had to offer that many others have done already.The story is that criminal brothers Seth and Richard Gecko have recently broken out of prison and are travelling to Mexico to give their fellow gangsters some money. However, they encounter some problems, including kidnapping some hostages, trying to get across the US-Mexico border and how their meeting point with the aforementioned gangsters turns out to be full of vampires. Can they survive until dawn? The plot is very simple, and works for a B-movie homage like this, despite occasional plot holes here and there (i.e. why the vampires kill lorry drivers specifically). The plot isn't the only thing that's very shallow. Most of the characters are two-dimensional at best, with the standouts being George Clooney's Seth Gecko, as the character and Clooney oozes cool, and Harvey Kietel's father character, a widow who is desperately trying to look after his kids and the criminals, to the point where he will sacrifice his life for them. This makes him the character with the most depth in the movie, and Kietel plays him very well with an equal amount of boldness and restraint. The rest of the characters are slightly dull, but the actors do their best with weak material. The only dud here is Juliette Lewis, acting so robotic and lifeless, bringing none of the talent and charisma she had in Cape Fear, What's Eating Gilbert Grape and even Natural Born Killers. But the film isn't really concerned with plot or characters, but rather the mindless vampire action. After a good half an hour of talking and build up, the film turns into a series of vampire fights, which to be fair are quite cool. Robert Rodriguez is a brilliant action director, and this movie shows that off in spades, as the action scenes have good choreography and a quick pace, which make them enjoyable and fun to watch. The effects are also quite good as well, as despite the fact that a lot of CGI is used, are very impressive. The vampires themselves are quite unique as well, combining influences from films like The Evil Dead and The Thing as well as original ideas to create a truly unique set of creatures. However, the despite what fun you have watching the film, there isn't enough substance to reward multiple viewings. It's essentially junk food: it's nice enough and satisfies you for what it is, but is isn't anything substantial. I understand that the movie has a strong cult following, but to be honest, this is just a forgettable vampire film that doesn't offer you much outside of fun action and some good acting. It may be very appealing to you if you were a teenage boy who didn't know any better, but to be honest, the film isn't very good, and while it's fine for one watch, it doesn't really warrant repeat viewings for those looking for more depth. So overall, this is just a mediocre vampire film with occasional moments of brilliant here and there. Nothing more, nothing less. Still, it's a better Tarantino/Rodriguez collaboration than Four Rooms, I guess.",6,0,1,23 January 2015
Reservoir Dogs," One of the best debuts of all time.
","A debut film is an important film in a director's career as not only can it introduce the film industry to a new talent, but also can give us an idea of what that director will later bring to the film industry's table. Whether it'll be a great career whose legacy will live on forever, or a frightening one that will give the industry a bad name, the debut can give us an idea of what we can expect from a newcomer. The former definitely applies to Reservoir Dogs. Made by a film geek with a tiny budget and a stellar cast, the film became a staple, not only of the independent cinema scene, but of the entire film industry in general. Critics and audiences raved and the film has gone down as one of the best films of all time. But is it worthy of that praise? Completely. While not being one of the best films ever made, the film is certainly a great one, with a great script, acting and direction.The plot is that a bunch of gangsters, only identified by colour, attempt to pull off the perfect heist, but it all goes horribly wrong, as the cops have been alerted. After regrouping at their rendezvous point, the gangsters, reduced in their numbers and extremely paranoid, try to figure out what went wrong. What follows is a complex plot involving tortured cops, betrayals, and bubblegum pop from the 70's. The plot works really well here, as it keeps you interested in to what's going on and the non-linear approach helps to do so by filling in the blanks of the plot, and it all gels together perfectly. It also helps that the plot has many surprises, twists and a lot of tension throughout. The rest of the writing is also very impressive. The dialogue may seem bizarre, considering that often the characters talk more about Pam Grier, tipping and Maddonna than anything else, but it is very clever and very quirky dialogue, which can often be very funny, and surprisingly, there are more laughs throughout the film (especially the opening scene) than you'd think, but the funny moments and the more suspenseful moments are balanced out perfectly, as each allows their own time to shine, and the film is smart enough to not veer too much into one genre or the other.Unfortunately though, the characters don't hold up as well. Outside of Mr. Blonde and Mr. Orange, none of the characters have much teeth to them, and aren't very different from one another in terms of how they speak and how their personalities are constructed, as the actors alone the only thing that differentiates these characters apart. That said, some of the characters are well rounded, particularly Mr. Blonde and Mr. Orange, especially the former as the writing and Michael Madsen combine to create a character who is charming and charismatic, despite being psychotic and he definitely leaves an impact even if he has limited screen time. Mr. Orange as well is pretty interesting, being a smart-ass who is overly confident and because of this, gets more than he bargained for. The style is also pretty cool as well. The film has a brilliant soundtrack, has great moments of exploitation violence and shows some smart ideas, particularly the ending, which is impressive for a first time director. The film may mostly take place in a warehouse, but there is more drama, excitement and hilarity in this one setting than many globe trotting summer blockbusters. Transformers, anyone?Overall, this is a great debut, and deserves all the praise it gets and more. Despite some missteps (ie flat characters and a few plot holes), this is a masterpiece that stands as a great work of art, and gave us a taste of what to come from the great mind of Quentin Tarantino.",9,0,0,5 July 2014
Pulp Fiction," One of the best films of the 90's.
","Pulp Fiction. What is there left to say about it? From it's countless reviews, accolades and the fact that it redefined cinema should already tell many how brilliant this movie is and how it's legacy has changed the face of cinema forever. With all of that praise, many have talked about it and analyzed it to death, so it would imply that there is simply nothing left to talk about. However, as I love this film so much and really like writing reviews, I will also discuss what a masterpiece this film is.Firstly, the way the story is told is fantastic, as it does it in a non- linear fashion, each focused on a certain bunch of characters and their actions, and how some of those actions affect the other stories. Sure the separate plots maybe simple on their own, but the way they mesh together in this film is quite beautiful. Sure, not all of the stories are great here, as there are one or two slow, boring ones that you have to sit through, but you will be rewarded with other great and exciting stories to make up for it. The fact that each story has about 20-40 minutes of screen time allows each story to breath and leave an impact, something which many of it's copycats (Snatch for example) fail to realize. As it is told in a non-linear fashion, meaning that certain stories happen after others, it allows for many surprises along the way. It is like 4-6 short films for the price of one and most of them are fantastic and offer you a different experience with each story.The first story is about a couple of gangsters, Vincent Vega and Jules Winfield who are going to carry out a hit for their boss, Marsellus Wallace. What follows is a hilarious mix of violence, comedy and Kahuna Burgers. The same thing can be said of their other stories one of which involves them accidentally killing a hostage and having to clean the car before time runs out as they have parked in a friend's garage whose wife is coming home. This is story is definitely the most comedic in the film as there are the most jokes and humiliations in it, particularly with Vincent and Jules being very humorlessly clumsy. Their most action packed story is the final one where a diner is held up and Vincent and Jules are caught right up in the middle of it, being held hostage by a gangster called Pumpkin and his loose cannon wife. While there is a lot of humour here, it is definitely the most tense due to the situation and how psychotic both Pumpkin and his wife are. It isn't the most violent however. This is where Bruce Willis, playing a boxer called Butch comes in. After killing another boxer in a fight that he was meant to lose, Butch quickly escapes with his girlfriend and intend on leaving the country. There is one problem however, he left his gold watch behind, an item that has been in his family for generations. So he has to go back in order to reclaim the watch. This is definitely both the most violent and the most surprising story, seeing as how it takes a turn into the exploitation and samurai genres. However, the transition of genres is a smooth one considering how it keeps with the tone of the film and is played more over the top, which considering how this film is partly a black comedy fits.The only dud here is when Vincent has to look after Marsellus Wallace's wife, Mia. It is such a slow story, and there is barely any sort of excitement in the story despite plot points like an overdose. There is hardly any chemistry between Vincent and Mia and Mia herself is quite a boring character. She's just a bland party girl. Uma Thurman does her best, but even she can't rescue the story from blandness.However, that is my only compliant with the film. Another good thing about it is the dialogue. Sure, like Reservoir Dogs, it discusses hardly interesting things, but it works and can often times be really funny. There is also a lot more character development in this than Reservoir Dogs, with most of the characters at least having a different personality to them, and as in these stories there are many duos, there is much chemistry between the characters. Vincent for example, is a calm quiet man who really doesn't want to screw up meanwhile Jules is a much more psychotic, religious and dangerous character who is thinking of retiring soon. Butch is a paranoid person who only manages to get through life with his wit and often by the skin of his teeth. Marsellus is a very though person who while a person who shouldn't be double- crossed does care about his wife and what happens to himself, and not even he can protect himself all the time. There are also some stylistic choices I really like as well. The soundtrack is great (if not as good as Reservoir Dogs), the film has a great loose tone which allows for a lot of fun and there is even some ambiguity as well, which I won't spoil for you here. Overall, this is by far one of the best films of the 90's and of all time. It is a mixture of many things and many genres which all mesh together to give us a spectacular experience. Despite some problems here and there, this a complete masterpiece that improves on Reservoir Dogs while being great on it's own. If you haven't seen it already, go and see it, because you are missing out on great cinema otherwise.",9,0,3,8 July 2014
The Woman in Black," Not as scary as you've been lead to believe.
","The state of horror films these days is quite poor, as nowadays horror films are less about build-up, good characters and true scares and rather hateful teenagers, jump scares and poor plotting. Would this film, with it's healthy budget, acclaimed source material and the newly reformed Hammer backing it, break this mold? Unfortunately no, as despite positive critic reviews and great box office, this film is quite poor with poor production and nothing vaguely scary. The plot is that a young lawyer called Arthur Kipps has a new assignment: to try to sell a house that has been abandoned for some time. The problem is that the village around the house starts acting strangely when he arrives and the house is haunted by a ghost who curses those who enter with a terrible fate. While the plot does sound creepy initially and there are occasional moments in the film that take advantage of this (mainly the brilliant opening scene), these moments are few and far between, and there isn't much interesting material in between these moments that make the film worth watching. One of the reasons for this is the lack of any originality in the film's setting. I understand that both the film and the book that it was based on is meant to be told in a manner similar to a traditional Gothic tale, and I can respect that. The problem is that it sticks too close to these roots and because of this offers nothing new to this genre. This is highlighted with how the aforementioned haunted house is literally an amalgamation of every haunted house cliché in existence. You have the chairs rocking on their own, family pictures with the eyes scratched out, very dark rooms, a graveyard containing the villain's coffin, the list goes on and on. It honestly feels very derivative, and it ruins any atmosphere that the film wanted to make.Other reasons for this are in the screenplay itself. Outside of the haunted house clichés, there are many other problems. One of these are the major plot holes which undermine the story's serious tone, with the main ones being why no-one is leaving this town if it is cursed by a ghost who kills their children and how Arthur doesn't depart also, despite how everyone is acting weirdly towards him and acting like they've got something to hide, similarly to how the people of Summerisle act towards Police Sergeant Neil Howie in the original Wicker Man. However there it made sense why Howie didn't leave: he was a police officer on a murder investigation, however Kipps is a lawyer trying to sell a house. Not very comparable is it? It also isn't very scary, as the title villain isn't in the movie much , and even when she is, her moments of glory are very brief to the point that if you blink, you'll miss it. For most of the time, exposition tells you about her and what she can do, which isn't very scary at all. I understand that what you don't see is scarier , but in order to make her somewhat threatening, show us what see can do, don't keep telling us, as after a while, it gets pretty boring as you're essentially being lectured about the monster rather than being terrified by it. It is honestly one step away from reading the bleeding book.It isn't enough to say that this is build up either, as good horror films may not show much of the monster through a lot of the running time, but they gave you enough to reward your patience but still keep you curious, and at least showed you the monsters by the end in their full glory, whereas this film doesn't even give you that luxury. At least in Alien and Cloverfield, the monsters at least had an original and interesting design, which made you feel rewarded for your pateince. This film's villain on the other hand is a woman in a black wedding veil. Fail. All of this reduces any menace that the villain has. Considering that it's victims are mainly children, that is quite an astonishing feat. All of these script problems are surprising, considering how great a writer Jane Goldman is as shown by films like X-Men First Class and Kick-Ass. It does show a lack of experience for her, which is excusable considering that this is her first horror film. This inexperience is shared by director James Watkins, which is far less excusable considering that he has worked in the horror genre (director of Eden Lake, writer of The Descent Part 2) before. Sure, he gets good performances from his actors but the film is poorly directed, from the lack of menace from the villain, the fact that the kills get less and less scary as the film goes on, poor atmosphere and the fact that many scenes are very poorly lit (I know the film has black in the title, but this is just ridiculous). Sure, it's not as bad as Monsters, where vital scenes are shot in pitch blackness, but it does recall Spinal Tap, as you ask yourself: 'How much more black could this be?' And the answer is none. It is honestly a horror film so shoddily made that it makes the low budget horror film Creep look like a professional job by comparison. Overall, this is just a badly made & badly written horror film. Sure it isn't as poisonously bad as The Village and Paranormal Activity, but it is still pretty poor and gives the British film industry a bad name. If this is one of the newly reformed Hammer Studio's tent-poles, then they have clearly lost their way from their much better 50's-70's days of horror.",4,1,2,10 August 2014
Trainspotting," 20 years on, choose something else.
","This is it. One of the big ones. One of the biggest films in both British cinema and culture, as well as general cinema. It took a glimpse at and captured late 90s British culture, has garnered endless praise by critics and audiences alike, has influenced many films and filmmakers since, got nominated for numerous awards and even has a cult following to boot. But after 20 years, does it still hold up?The plot is Renton among his various heroin junkie friends wander around life in late 1990s Scotland and England, experiencing addiction, drug withdrawal, employment, theft and the changing culture of the time. If I'm sounding like I'm making the film look weak in terms of plot, that is how the film presents itself, and is rather the fault of the film than of my own. One of my biggest problems with the film is its utter lack of a coherent plot and/or structure. There is no overreaching story arc whatsoever throughout the entire film, sans the occasional subplot, and as such, it makes the film hard to connect with due to a lack of a strong narrative to pull the viewer in. This sort of style can work; Five Easy Pieces for example is a wonderful demonstration of how to do a wandering movie correctly.However, the big difference between Five Easy Pieces and Trainspotting is that while both have major douchebags in the leads, the former's was at least sympathetic, the latter isn't. And that is my main problem with the film; the characters are too unlikable to engage with. Far too nasty, narcissistic and selfish to really attach onto. Only Spud seems like a legitimately good guy, and even he is too pathetic and easily manipulated to support. The rest of them are just horrible and self-indulgent narcissists perfectly happy to stab each other in the back when the plot serves that need, most notably Renton's betrayal of both Spud in the courtroom early on and then his ultimate back stab at the end. It doesn't make a for a bunch of likable protagonists, of which makes the viewer wonder why are they bothering to watch? In comparison, someone like Five Easy Pieces' Bobby Dupea may be for many an unlikable guy (being moody, spoilt and generally selfish), but at least he is charming, and cares enough for people for people around him to make him a likable enough guy with some sense of a moral compass. Trainspotting has none of this. The characters seem to care little for one another beyond anything superficial, they have no likable character traits, and given the fact that they range from stupid losers to borderline psychopaths (hi, Begbie), they aren't pleasant people to be around either. Of which makes watching an hour and a half movie with these fools as the lead somewhat problematic, given that I don't enjoy their company at all. Meanwhile, they don't have the excuse films like Sweet Smell Of Success, Fight Club and even Boyle's own Shallow Grave do in that the characters in those movies are similarly rotten to the core, but they were also charming, had some moral compass and got their comeuppance in the end, even if it is somewhat minimal for say Fight Club, none of which happens in Trainspotting, especially given that the 'comeuppance' that happens at the end of the film is benefitting another unlikable character and making another more likable character in Spud worse off so it means nothing. And at least in those movies, when they were backstabbing one another, those affected were at least ready to take the heat and fight back as opposed to Trainspotting where innocent or unlucky victims are often in the firing line for the main characters' antics (like getting an innocent dog owner attacked by his own dog, one guy unknowingly sleeping with a minor of whom then blackmails him to keep up the relationship and pretty much everything that happens to Spud from having his job interviews messed up by friends to being sent down while friends who helped him in crime walk free). So here's my underlying problem; there is no substantial enough plot to get the viewer engaged and the characters are too unlikable to make you care enough for the situation. As such, why am I watching in the first place?After all this, you probably think I hate this movie, but I don't, as I think it's OK. The acting is terrific, it's very stylish and it is entertaining at the least. The film can be funny at points (especially some of movie references thrown about and narration parts) and it does have a wonderful soundtrack. The film's production values are very good for the most part (sans some embarrassingly fake effects like the crawling baby during one of Renton's hallucinations) in terms of cinematography, location shooting and editing (even on a low budget), of which helps to create Trainspotting's unique tone of both bleakness and weird sense of hope, especially towards the end and in certain scenes (like the Worst Toilet In Scotland scene). And even if it potentially dates it somewhat, I do like how it is a great reflection of late 1990s Britain, celebrating both the highs and lows of said culture, making a great historical document in that sense.But despite this, I'm not a huge fan. Between the lack of a strong plot and any likable characters, Trainspotting may be an easy film to admire, but a very, very hard one to like. It may look very nice and is very well made, but unfortunately has nothing to grab the viewer in terms of anything emotionally driven, a big failing for a drama like this one. So overall, it is OK, but it doesn't hold up as well as it does over 20 years ago. Choose your future, choose life and just choose a better film to watch.",6,1,4,9 November 2017
The Hunger Games: Catching Fire," Better than the first... but still very problematic.
","Expectations is something that everyone succumbs to when doing a lot of things, especially when viewing a piece of art for the first time, in particular movies, as due to the film's marketing, cast, director and (in some cases) potential production mishaps, everybody has expectations when seeing a film for the first time, whether it be good or bad. However, it is always important to keep an open mind when watching and not let your expectations dictate your overall judgement of the film. This is what I did when seeing this film. I wasn't the biggest fan of the first, feeling it was badly plotted, poorly written, was obvious in its social commentary and had a main character who I didn't care for. That said, I kept an open mind while watching and overall, while it is better than the first, that isn't saying very much, considering that not only are many of the first film's problems still present, some of them have gotten worse.The first problem is that the film is that is less a sequel but more of a remake of its predecessor, which was already technically a remake of films like The Running Man and Battle Royale. This is highlighted with the amount of plot points that are recycled from the first film. Both films start in Katniss' District of District 12. Both films have an incident which gets the heroes involved with the Hunger Games. Both films have a similarly paced and underwhelming Hunger Games. Both films involve a sequence with obviously fake fire effects. The fact that both films are as similar as they are demonstrates how the lazy the writing is, as it seems that they thought that repeating material would be easier than to create new material.Another example of lazy writing is the obvious social commentary. Like the first film, we are spoon-fed social commentary, but this time it is about the media and celebrity culture, rather than the rich and poor. It discusses how the media (symbolised by the Capitol) form celebrities (symbolised by Katniss and Peeta) personalities and controls their every move, even forcing them to marry, in order to satisfy the public. In a better and more subtle film, this may have been a subtle and interesting commentary on Rupert Murdoch-media and how corrupt it is, but instead due to how painfully obvious it is, it becomes quite boring after a while.I wouldn't mind this lack of subtly if the film was good in other areas. Unfortunately, the film also lacks in characterization, acting and tension. While most of the acting is top-notch, the leads are (like in the first film) lacking with Jennifer Lawrence, despite being slightly better in this film, still sounds more like a bored, whiny and lazy teenager than a tortured, distressed and rebellious young woman and Josh Hutcherson is about as wooden as a tree trunk. It doesn't help that Donald Sutherland is a weak bad guy. Don't get me wrong, he's a brilliant actor, but he isn't an intimidating presence. In scenes when he is threatening Katniss that he'll destroy her District if she doesn't obey the Capitol, he comes off less as an evil dictator, and more of a grandfather who is telling off his granddaughter for behaving badly. In the hands of someone like Tobin Bell or Brian Cox, the role could have been salvaged, but instead Sutherland phones in his performance.The characters are also poorly drawn. Sure there are hints at development, but the film never has the courage to run with them. For example, Katniss has bad dreams about the previous Hunger Games and the violence that happened, but this only happens once. Another example is an attempt to create more chemistry between Katniss and Peeta, but this only happens in 2 or 3 scenes, whose credibility is reduced with corny lines about what Katniss' favourite colour is.It also doesn't help that by the time the Hunger Games begins, they're a major disappointment as the characters fight no humans, but rather baboons, poisonous gases, a rotating island at high speed and crows. Yay. It isn't helped by how easily these enemies are evaded. How are the baboons evaded? They point spears at them, which scares them. How do they fight off the effects of poisonous gases? They roll around in water. How do they stop falling off the quickly rotating island? They just hold onto it. How do they fight off the crows? They don't, as they eventually fly away. There is no tension because of this, and with not threat, bad writing and poor social commentary, what are we left with?Some redeeming features, luckily. The ending for example contains a really good, unexpected twist that makes the rest of the film seem worthwhile (and shows potential for the rest of the franchise, despite the ending feeling a bit abrupt) and many of the other actors are great and the production values (special effects & set design) are improved from the first (albeit the fire effects), showing the signs of a bigger budget. However, when the style of the movie, great performances from the supporting cast rather than the main stars & one twist at the end of the movie are the best parts of this film, it doesn't bode well for the rest of the series. Overall, while the film is better than the first, that doesn't say much. Sure, the ending and production values are great and the supporting cast are fantastic, but the film also has many of the first film's problems (i.e. poor characterization, lack of subtly and bland leads just to name a few) and many of the those problems have gotten worse. Hopefully, Mockingjay parts 1 & 2 will fix this, but for now, this is a huge disappointment that has been over-hyped by critics and audiences alike. Similar to director Francis Lawrence's other films (Constantine, I Am Legend) I guess.",6,1,10,20 November 2014
Jackie Brown," Tarantino's most mature (and arguably best) movie to date.
","The late 90's weren't the best time to be a Tarantino fan. While peaking in the early 90's with masterpieces like Reservoir Dogs & Pulp Fiction, the mid 90's didn't show him the best light, as Four Rooms was a huge waste of potential (and Tarantino's segment was the most pointless in the film) & while From Dusk Til Dawn was a fun B-movie homage, that's all it was, and it was very forgettable in the process. And let's not even start on his horrible attempts at acting. Because of this, many felt that by this point, Tarantino was a two-trick pony and had to make something truly special in order to say otherwise. This is where Jackie Brown comes in. Despite being his least stylistic film, Jackie Brown makes up for it with strong character development, an engaging story and a great script, creating Tarantino's most mature film to date.The story is that Jackie Brown, a flight attendant, smuggles money from Mexico to the US for Ordell Robbie, a black-market gun runner in order to make extra income for herself. However, when she is arrested for smuggling drugs that she was unaware were in her bag, she decides in order to avoid jail time to help the law get Ordell in jail. However, she finds it difficult to find where her loyalties lie. The story for the most part is very engaging, as it keeps you guessing as to what is going to happen all throughout the film. While the large amount of subplots can make the film overly complicated and hard to follow at times, it is still interesting and keeps you on the edge throughout the film's duration.The characters are also very well written and demonstrate Tarantino's best character writing to date. All of the characters are three dimensional and very compelling. It also helps that all the acting is fantastic, with Pam Grier being the standout, delivering an Oscar worthy performance as someone who is struggling with what to do with her life, and will go to extreme lengths in order to have a peaceful life. Samuel L. Jackson, Robert Forester, Robert De Niro, Michael Keaton among others are very good as well and Chris Tucker actually isn't annoying for once. The script is also very good as well, with great dialogue & interesting themes relating to the ideas of aging, gun violence, betrayal and many more that keep the film utterly engrossing throughout. The biggest problem for many is that this is Tarantino's least stylistic film to date. The dialogue isn't as Tarantino-esque as before, there isn't much action & the story is for the most part (except for an outstanding sequence set in a mall where a scenario happens from multiple perspectives) told in a linear fashion. To be fair, the film does feel slower than his previous films and isn't as enjoyable as them because of it (not helped by he film's overlong two and a half hour running time), but it is still engaging nonetheless, due to it's story and characters, which due to the lack of action the film has more time for. The film also has some style, as particularly highlighted with the aforementioned mall and the marvelous soundtrack, which oozes funk and soul, and is fits with the film perfectly. Overall, this is a great film. While not as good as Tarantino's previous efforts, it still is quite outstanding, due to its characters, story and acting. Too long and potentially hard to follow sometimes it may be, but it still is worthwhile viewing for any Tarantino fan, who want to see him at his most mature, and arguably best, era of film-making.",8,1,3,24 January 2015
