Skyfall," Bond Is Back
","Bond is back. Was there ever any doubt about it? Skyfall is a magnificent return to form for Bond and in the franchise's 50th year anniversary is almost certainly going to be considered one of the best Bond movies ever.Skyfall is brilliantly acted, well paced, with some touches of dry humour and some great references to Bond movies past. Visually, the movie is stunning with some beautiful locations Shanghai and Macau being the standout places.Sam Mendes has made his name through excellent art house movies, yet this is the British director's first British movie. An accomplished theatre director, Mendes is a real actors director and has got great performances out of his cast. Mendes is a rare director who rarely does a bad movie, and although Jarhead was perhaps a little misjudged, American Beauty, Revolutionary Road and Road to Perdition are masterpieces.Craig is the best Bond and the best actor to play Bond. He is an experienced, rough around the edges and dangerous Bond who is entirely believable. Judi Dench has more to do than ever in this movie and her stunning performance should surely receive recognition. Bardem impresses and chews scenery as a very interesting villain whilst Naomi Harris and Bernice Marlohe are gorgeous as two very important characters. The cast is rounded off with a hugely effective role for Ralph Fiennes and Ben Whishaw as the new Q. Even Albert Finney pops up to lend hugely experienced support in the gripping finale.Bond is back, and I cannot recommend it highly enough.",10,6,21,28 October 2012
