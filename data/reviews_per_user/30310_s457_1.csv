Changeling," Seriously ?! I totally hate it
","this movie was disturbing on so many different levels i'm glad at least they had decency not to show how they actually killed those kids. I didn't like the movie at all. Also Angelina didn't look very good in this one, ha ha. Got to have kind of a sick mind to create something like this. I wouldn't recommend this to anyone, not sure why I even watched it. That was 2 hours 20 minutes waste of my life. There's one thing I didn't really understand that happened in the asylum, the part where they told Angelina to spread her legs and did... yeah... I'd like to know what's up with that. Anyway i hope this review stops some of you wasting your time on something as bad as this.",2,7,22,15 March 2010
