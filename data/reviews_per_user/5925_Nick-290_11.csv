Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," boring remake
","I saw a great movie the other day. A SF movie. Let me quickly tell you the story: (minor spoiler!)There is this planet of the good guys. The bad guys are after them, they have huge space ships and they land an invasion army of robot like marines, the good guys (a princess among them) manage to escape, barely though, their little space ship gets damaged. So they have to repair it, the scene changes, there is a dessert planent and some irrelevant action, then we are on a planet with lots of forrests, there is a pseudo primitive and cute species on it, first they do not want, but then they help the good guys. But they are in trouble, the good guy's fighter ships have to destroy the power station of a huge space station, so we see lots of dogfighting, also there is a laser sword duel between the good knight and the dark knight, in a modern looking setting with an abyss,  and the good knight gets killed. But the good ones destroy the space station and this stops the action of the bad guys. So they celebrate a victory party.Sorry, I should have told you the movie was not Empire Strikes Back or Return of the Yedi. It was a new one, a sort of Remake with modern computer graphics. I enjoyed the visuals, but I was bored by the action, since I knew it from the original movie, where the actors infused some life into the plot. I just wonder, why they call a remake Episode I?",Null,0,1,9 September 1999
Minority Report," How Spielberg spoiled Dick's Minority Report
","***MILD SPOILERS*** There are some good things to this movie. It is probably the most realistic SF movie ever made, with a lot of effort put in the design and functionality of future everyday items. Also the acting is convincing, the cinematography is kept in a surrealistic colourless grey, most likely to resemble the film noir it is supposed to be.Unfortunately, all this could have been made for just any SF movie and does not have to do anything with the short story by Philip K. Dick. As so often, the screen adaptation throws away a nice, conclusive plot, and comes up with a stupid and ridiculous replacement.The film has almost nothing to do with the original story, except for two main characters (Anderton and Witwer) and the pre-crime department with the three precogs. The only character remotely true to the story is Witwer, whilst the Anderton of the story has nothing to do with the guy played by Tom Cruise. He is more like the charcter of Burgess, played by Max von Sydow, an aged founder of precrime, close to retirement, whose only intention is to keep the system going.*spoiler ahead* I could accept all this, ignore the Philip K Dick title, and watch the movie as a sort of film noir in the future. But there is such a major flaw in the plot, which makes it impossible for me to enjoy it. It is the framing of Anderton by his mentor and friend Burgess. This set-up is the main plot of the movie and neither the motive (stopping Anderton from digging up some dirt in Burgess past) nor the whole set-up has anything to do with Philip K Dick. Frankly, Dick would never have come up with such a inconclusive and implausible idea.How can you frame somebody in the future? Unless of course you can travel through time or you are god. The whole set-up is a closed loop, which can never be started in the presence. But let us not talk about this any more. Let us instead have a lock at what Dick actually wanted to tell in his story:There is one crucial thing, which lacks in the movie despite the catchy title. In the book there is actually a minority report (even three to be precise). The point of Dicks story is that your knowledge of the future might allow you to change it (the same way as the police change the future by arresting the criminal before he commits the crime). The future is not set but under constant flow and subject to alterations and changes.Dick's Anderton is also accused by the precogs of killing a man within the next week. He has never heard of the man before. The point here is, that with this knowledge at his hand, Anderton tries to avoid killing him. This changes the future, and is correctly predicted by the second precog as a minority report, who included into his prediction the prior knowledge of Anderton of the accusation. But during the whole affair, Anderton learns that the man he is supposed to kill and who he does not want to kill is in fact trying to bring down the whole precrime system by publishing the minority report. The only way to save his life's work is to actually kill him anyway, so that the majority report is proven correct. So he has to sacrifice himself for the system he created. He kills the man and accepts his punishment, but precrime survives.The clue at the end: His final action was predicted by the third precog, who had also an alternate vision of the future, but this vision included prior knowledge of the minority report by Anderton. So all three precoqs saw a different future of Anderton, based on increasing amount of information available to Anderton to act. Since two of the precogs predicted murder (one and three, but under totally different circumstances), the murder (not the way how it is supposed to happen!) was the majority report released to Anderton at the beginning.Dick points out that this situation is pretty unique and could only happen to the head of precrime (the first reader of the future), not to the `common criminal'.  In the book this disagreement of the precogs is in their three minority reports is downplayed and the justification of the precrime as a correct prediction is maintained.So what has this to do with the Spielberg movie? Nothing of course, except the title.",Null,0,0,9 June 2003
The Mummy," Silly movie with great effects
","If this movie was planned as a scary horror film, it would be a disastrous failure. The only reason the silly plot is just about bearable is the funny aspect of this horror comedy. But let's face it. The stars in this movie are the special effects done by ILM. So if we add up: 10 for the effects, 0 for historical accuracy (as in how America imagines the egypts might have lived, minus 10 for Star Gate in this category...), 5 for the plot and 7 for the actors.Just found out they are doing a sequel. This is a bit too much, minus 3 for this greedy idea. Which leaves us with what total score of what?",7,1,1,26 February 2001
X-Men," One of the weakest Super Hero Movies
","A good Director and good Actors, even Oscar Winners, cannot help this weak plot. I find it almost boring. I just watched it for a second time on DVD, and I had difficulties finishing it (which hardly ever happens even with movies I have seen lots of times...).There is absolutely nothing special about this movie, even the last Batman sequel was more entertaining. I was told this is the first in a series, and special care was taken to build up all the individual characters. What characters? Except Wolverine and Mystique, who have some depth and are admittedly cool, all the other superheroes are pathetic (Cyclops, Storm), or just ridiculous (Toad). Even Mr Xavier himself is not much of a superhero, and Patrick Stewart bends backwards to give him some life. Waste of an actor!The story line is utterly predictable, silly, and one more time a waste of resources, like so many other movie versions of comic heroes. (Why not just take some of the original comic story lines and turn them into a movie. Frank Miller's Return of the Dark Knight outclasses the combined production of all the screenplays for the Batman movies. Where is the daring genius to turn Neil Gaiman's Sandman into a decent movie?)I like comics, I like movies, and sometimes I like them both put together, but X men is one of these movies I would like to unwatch and get back my money, and more important my time.",6,0,0,8 June 2001
Star Wars: Episode II - Attack of the Clones," Trivial convolution, wooden acting, but the effects!!!
","One of the problems of Episode II (and Episode I) is George Lucas struggle to support the simple story of the original trilogy with a history. The weak plot  did not bother twenty years ago (the attention was on the effects), since the original Star Wars trilogy was only one step up from other trivial SF movies like Battle Star Galactica. But if you try to give a trivial story a convoluted background, the outcome is trivial convolution. Also, by trying to tie up loose ends, Lucas raises as many questions as he answers.I just read the synopsis on the history of George Lucas Star Wars World, starting several thousand years before the story of Episode I (Origin of the Sith, famous battles between Sith and Yedis etc). I was surprised how simple, banal and totally repetitive the motives of this so called universe are. Although Lucas had decades of time, his universe reaches but a fraction of other fictitious worlds like Lord of the Rings or Neil Gaiman's Sandman Universe. In fact it is about as original and convincing as the background information you will find on any second class PC game like Heroes of Might and Magic or Diablo. The main motive is the constant fight between the good and the bad Yedis. The second motive is the constant conversion of a famous aspiring Yedi to the dark side of the force. So Anakin Skywalker stands in a long tradition of Yedis, and if Yoda is only half as clever as we are to believe he is, the most important lesson to learn at the Yedi school would be how to avoid the temptations of the dark side.The present controversy here and elsewhere, where people like me criticise the acting and story telling can be explained. We are the thirty- or forty year old fans of the original trilogy, who forgot about the lousy acting and trivial story of Leia, Han and Luke. Let's face it, Harrison Ford is a good actor now, but was he a good actor in Star Wars? Mark Hamill disappeared entirely from the screen. Surely not because he was such a brilliant actor.As for G. Lucas, instead of telling a simple story with a good pace (like for instance Kershner in Empire Strikes Back), he indulges in trivial details of his simple universe. I found the first half often boring and repeatedly checked my watch. Can't remember having done that 20 years ago. Did the characters gain any depth by dragging it out? I doubt it. The acting between Portman and Christensen is wooden and poor. Both remind me of early evening soap opera teeny stars. Anakin Skywalker behaving as such a spoiled brat after ten years of Yedi training? Maybe after ten days The guy grew up as a slave. In his present position he should be the happiest adolescent in the galaxy. He does not show a trace of his mentor Obi Wan, nor a trace of the great, dangerous Darth Vader we are to believe he will become in the next episode. Darth Vader is the prototype of efficiency and loyalty (to his emperor). He is  focused on what is important and what is not. Skywalker behaves like an American teenage boy with a light sabre, who thinks having fun` is the reason to be a Yedi. The computer generated Yoda has more screen presence than Portman and Christensen together. If it wasn't for Ewan McGregor, who IS the young Obi Wan, down to copying the expression of Alec Guiness, you could replace all the actors in the next Episode III by computer animation. After all, Final Fantasy had a similar convincing plot and in movies like this the actors seem to be more and more redundant.Episode II is (like the other Star Wars movies) just a brilliant special effects show. Nothing more, but this is still worth while watching (if you are a fan) and you get value for money in the second half of the movie. If you forget all the Lucas hype and concentrate on the special effects you are in for a roller coaster ride. Let us hope Lucas will be more modest in the final episode. He should not try to make a movie with real acting and with differentiated characters (for that you need a proper script and proper actors). Instead tie up the loose ends (like why can't C3PO remember Tatooine? Why doesn't any Yedi sense the presence of the Force in Senator Palpatine?), and get it over and done with. 8/10",7,0,0,3 June 2002
The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring," Darker than the book, read it, read it, read it!
","As a veteran LOTR fan (last 30 years!) I waited for this movie for decades. Worth every minute of it! It is as good as it gets. The shortcomings are due to the medium film and not changeable. Due to cutting out all the jolly and merry bits of the book (Tom Bomdadil, I miss you!), and subscribing to action movie pace, the movie is much darker than the book. However, without the background of the book, you will miss a lot. It may not be popular to read in the USA (at least among some people), but maybe you should give it a try. Definitely better than Harry 'the Plagiator' Potter. (Neil Gaiman, I hope you sued her for every penny of her hundred million pounds...)",10,0,1,27 December 2001
Pitch Black," Excellent B picture Alien Clone
","See other comments for the plot. It is a simple Alien Clone, but during the movie you forget you ever saw Alien. It is a clear B picture, but you hardly notice it. Superb characters (Ripley who?) and good effects. No need for big stars. Like to watch more movies like Pitch Black!The Science is a little bit stressed (What do those beasts eat, when no stranded space travelers are around, since they seem to have killed everything alive on the planet. The eclipse, though a stunning effect, is hardly possible in real), but who cares?",9,0,0,12 September 2000
"Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon"," Beautiful movie
","This beautiful movie is the essence of Chinese martial arts. If you expect a realistic fist fight, better watch the mainstream Kung Fu stuff. This here is in the tradition of A touch of Zen with people flying or running up walls. Some people are irritated by this and there was lots of annoying laughter in the audience. Remarkable that the same people do not laugh when Mel Gibson flies with his car from house to house, or Tom Cruise flies from a train to a helicopter and back in the channel tunnel. Take it as an inspiring trip through China, relax, enjoy the language, the music by Yo Yo Ma and the grand cinematography. I hope there will be other movies like this in the future. 10 Points from me.",10,0,0,2 February 2001
The Matrix Reloaded," Not much new, I'm afraid...
","All together clearly disappointing. Maybe I expected too much, but while the first movie was original and advanced the genre of action or SciFi movies, this sequel is just a repetition of the same themes with an overdose of special effects.Do we need this sequel? No we don't. Who felt in wont of more information after part one? Let us be frank. Who gives anything about Zion? Who cares if mankind or the machines will win? In a virtual world with virtual heroes and virtual reality, the story line becomes almost irrelevant. Therefore most people watch the sequel because of the special effects, the action, the fighting, the outfit etc. However, I found myself looking at my watch in the middle of the car chase, and after the first twenty seconds of Neo fighting Mr Smith times hundred, I got bored. There is just not much new. Neo flies like Superman (which he did already at the end of part one), he stops bullets in slow motion (which he did already...) and he shows again a lot of martial arts. Yes, this is all better done than before, but the whole point of Matrix is THE IDEA. And here the movie fails to deliver anything new.Even the so called cliff hanger ending does not leave me in eager anticipation of part three. If I happen to go to the cinema at the time of its release and nothing better is on, I might even spend the money to see it. If not, I will wait for the DVD.Bottom line: If you are a Matrix freak, nothing in the world will stop you to blow your money anyway. If you are already sceptical in the first place, do not bother with this sequel.",Null,0,0,31 May 2003
The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King," Not a bad movie, but not as good as the other two
","I read LOTR for the first time about 25 years ago, at a time when you had to look for the book in the darkest corner of your local bookstore. It was a time when reading SF or Fantasy resulted in funny looks from your pals, and raised eyebrows from your teachers.Now Peter Jackson turned this book into a mass phenomenon, and it is suddenly very trendy to out yourself as a LOTR fan. I have watched the directors cut of the first two parts at least ten times on DVD. Both extended versions are very good, and I do not know which one to prefer. My expectations for the third part were of course very high. After all, Peter Jackson liked it best, so it should be the best part of the trilogy.However, I do not think it is better than the first two parts. It is certainly a very good movie, but there are parts, which I did not like. This review contains spoilers, is more a nit picker's comment, and may also not be very helpful for people without a certain background knowledge of the books of Tolkien.1. Intro: Each of the three parts starts with an intro. In the first we see and here the background story on the war against Sauron with Gil Galad and Elendil. Brilliant. In the second, we see Gandalfs fight with the Balrog to a wonderful soundtrack. Brilliant. And in the third? Smeagols transformation into Gollum, mainly pretty disgusting...and not necessary for the understanding of the plot (we heard all about that already in the second part). Also, I found the acting not convincing. All together a week start, and not in the same league as the first parts.2. Isengard scene: Where was Saruman? What was that scene for? Just for Pippin to find the Palanthir in the muck? I surely hope that we get to see more on the DVD.3. To much of weary, dirty hobbits in the mud. The pacing is pretty slow, Gollum's schizophrenia was well established in part II. Not necessary for the plot and the movie.4. Arwen: My most loathed character of all three movies. Named third in the credits for a few unnecessary scenes. She acts like a young American girl (what she is) and not like a three thousand year old grand-grand-grand-grand-grand-grand-grand-grand-aunt of Aragorn. What a difference in the few scenes we see with Galadriel!5. Aragorn: The title is the Return of the king. However, Aragorn does not get much to play this role. In the book, he challenges Sauron in the Palanthir and announces his return, whilst in the movie, he can barely hold the thing, and gets unconscious looking at it. I look forward to the DVD to hear Jacksons explanation of this unnecessary change. Also the path of the death story line is not convincing. If you read this in the book, it has a different flavour to it. The Death never fought in Minas Tirith, but for the movie it may have been useful, since it allowed to clean Minas Tirith of Orcs within a few seconds (Orcs, who had no business being there in the first place!). The unforgivable omission in Aragorn's character is that they did not show him as a healer. The Hands of the King are the Hands of a Healer. This is one of the most important parts of the third book, because it establishes Aragorn's right to the throne of Gondor, and gives him almost God like powers. To leave that out whilst wasting so much time on other redundant parts is very sad.6. Battle scenes: I must admit that the attack of the Rohirim is one of the best scenes in all three movies. (and Theoden a much better king than Aragorn, it was the other way round in the Two Towers! So Aragorn did not develop whilst Theoden did). But there is too much fighting. Too many lovely details of Orc gimmicks. From a story tellers point of few, the siege of Minas Tirith (saved by the cavalry!) is a larger copy of the siege of Helm's deep (saved by...the cavalry). In the book, the focus is not so much on this battle. It is a small part of the Return of the King (albeit a highlight), but in the movie, the battle seems to never end, the Orcs conquer almost the entire city (they do not even enter in the book), and Gandalf has lost his superior, god like powers of the book (after all, he is a Maiar, a sort of lesser angel), except in his lonely charge to help the returning Faramir.7. Denethor: What a caricature of the figure in the book! The steward is portrayed as a Shakespearean Richard III type villain, who is totally mad. Nobody bothers to explain, that he is fighting with Sauron in his personal Palanthir (just to have the power to look into such a thing repeatedly and NOT betray his people is something in his favour...)8. The fight with the Witch king: Very good movie adaptation, but still one of Tolkien's inconclusive scenes. At Amon Sul in the first movie, Aragorn chases away the witch king and four other wraiths with a burning stick and a lesser sword (although the ONE Ring was within inches of their grasp!). On the Pellenor field, the same Witch King is almost as powerful as Sauron himself, and no man can kill or defeat him. Why and where has he gained so much power?9. In the trailer we see Theoden knighting Merry on the top of Edoras. Did I miss this in the movie?10. Shelop's Lair. All together a very good adaptation, three nit picking comments: Shelop smells strongly in the book, so it is unlikely she could sneak up on Frodo like in the movie. In the movie she stings him in the chest or back (clearly in the middle of his body). But there he should be protected by his Mithril chain mail! Also, Sam could not get the ring out without destroying the cocoon.11. Finally, why on Middle earth did they not use the eagles in the first place for this quest? I am sure Gwaihir, or what his name is, would be understanding enough to fly Frodo from Rivendell to Mordor, if this would save Middle Earth. But this is of course a question, I should have asked Tolkien 25 years ago...Bottom line: I will wait eagerly for the extended DVD. Hopefully (as before with Lorien in part I and Treebeard in part II), this will add the much needed depths to the movie.",9,6,9,6 January 2004
Gladiator," So far the most realistic historical movie on Romans
","This movie is the most realistic historical movie on Romans produced so far. The first 10 minutes (battle in Germania) are so real that you feel like you just did a time travel. The computer work on ancient Rome is beautiful and pretty much correct. Although the plot is simple, acting is superb. The violence is disturbing, but that only adds to the realism of the movie. Nothing for weak stomachs, but if you can stand the violence, you are in for a treat. One of Ridley Scotts best movies, maybe the best since Alien and Blade Runner.",10,1,3,3 July 2000
