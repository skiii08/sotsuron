E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial," ET....
","What can you say about ET? It's a classic. It's a great movie. The older it gets, the better it gets. I think almost everyone has seen ET and if they didn't, they should. I mean what do you get when you take an alien, feed him Reese's pieces and     , put him on a flying bike, with greats like Drew Barrymore and Steven Spielberg? You get ET of course! I give it a......10/10",Null,0,1,12 November 2002
Spider-Man," One of the Bests!
","This movie is awesome, and I think has a lot of awards in it's future. This movie had good acting, a good plot and a good script. Maguire and Dunst did really good together, and I also have to say the special effects were spectacular. For going from a comic to a cartoon to a big-screen movie, Spider-Man was awesome!I give this movie a complete 10/10!",10,0,0,16 November 2002
Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone," Well....
","The Harry Potter books are very good and enjoyable but the movie wasn't all that great. It wasn't horrible (remember this is the first time acting for a lot of them),but I think the later ones (like the 3-7th movie) will be better because the actors and actresses will be used to acting. The movie did not have the suspense that the book had, but it tried. The best part of this movie had to be Hermeione's free will to talk back to anyone who messed with her. All in all it was OK.I give this movie an 8/10.",Null,0,0,14 November 2002
Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets," Much Better Than The First
","Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets was much better than first one. It matched the book more, the cast had a better idea what they were doing, and it began to get into the better par of the series. This movie held my attention the whole time... where in The Sorcerers Stone... I grew bored after a while. I enjoyed this movie completley and it deserves no less than a 10/10!",10,0,0,17 November 2002
Bring It On," Bring It On...
","is one of the best movies I've seen in a while (along with Legally and Spiderman). It had a good plot, good actors, and good humor. I think this is one of the best movies of 2000. Even if you are not a (I'm not)... you'll still find this movie funny and enjoyable. Bring It On, I think is for pre-teens and teenagers, but      s could like it to. Check it out!I give this movie a 10/10!",10,1,1,16 November 2002
Shrek," Quite Possibly The Best Animated Movie of It's Time...
","Shrek had everything, humor, adventure, romance, and it was also good for all ages. Little kids could enjoy this along with teens and      s. Some of the humor was above the younger viewers head and the      s found these parts funny. Shrek (while many aren't) was a good animated film, and you don't find a lot of good animated movies. Classics like this come once every couple of years. (Some animated classics include Beauty and the Beast and Monsters Inc.)     The only thing I have against Shrek is the fact they are making a sequel. The first one was very, very good, but many movies that were good the sequels... well they sucked. This does not happen in all cases though. Some (i.e. Spy Kids 2: The Island of Lost Dreams and The Godfather 2) pulled of a box office hit sequel.     If you have never seen this movie you should check it out. I give it a whole hearted 9.5/10!",10,1,2,18 November 2002
Back to the Future," A Complete 10/10!
","This movie was great! Michael J Fox is a great actor, and made this movie what it is! I enjoyed the good plot, the acting, and the script. This is one of Michael's best projects and Back To The Future is enjoyable for anyone of any age. If you haven't seen this movie(I don't know anyone who actually hasn't) watch it! You will be pleased. Back to the Future is great!This movie deserves a 10/10... and if possible, I would give it more! Check this movie out.",Null,0,1,16 November 2002
