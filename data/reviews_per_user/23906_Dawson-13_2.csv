E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial," Classic
","No Matter What Anyone Tells Me E.T. Will Always Stand As My Favorite Movie. From The First Time I saw It To Today It Remains Just As Great. Spielberg Defined Himself With This Movie. Everything Was Perfect, The Plot, The Characters, The Setting, Which Equals Up To The Best Movie Ever. The Movie Brings Out The Kid In All Of Us. Such Lines As 'E.T. Phone Home' and 'I'll Be Right Here' Will Never Be Forgotten, if I Had To Give This A Letter Grade Its Very Simply Put. A+",10,1,2,26 June 1999
Star Wars: Episode II - Attack of the Clones," 'Laugh it up, Fuzzball'
","Star Wars has lost its edge. The fantasy, the excitement, the anticipation seems to be in a galaxy far far away. Attack of The Clones was Lucas showing off his CGI muscles and forgetting completely about the characters that many have grown to love.Naturally Star Wars fanboys will attack my criticism and say that Lucas has produced another masterpiece. Unfortunately, Lucas has lost interest in his characters and now enjoys filming battle sequences. The dialogue is horribly cliche'ed and horribly acted.Redeeming values are few and far between in this over blown popcorn movie that lacks a heart.",1,0,1,16 May 2002
