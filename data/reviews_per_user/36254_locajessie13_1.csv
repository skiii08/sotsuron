Scarface," Why is this a classic?
","This is a good story but come on..... they have a bunch of Italians playing the roles of Latinos! Al Pacino's awful accent grates on your nerves throughout the film! I'm all for the gangster/mobster/drug-lord flicks but this one could have been SO much better! I loved looking at the clothes and wardrobe of these rich drug dealers from the 80's and I think that's the best part of the film. Al Pacino is a great actor but he can only do so much for a character that was designed for someone else to play. The movie drags on in places and you find yourself wondering why you sat down to watch it in the first place. Like I said, this is a good story that was cast all wrong. I'm sure many people disagree, but that's because they were told they had to like it. It's a classic! Why?",5,0,1,25 November 2005
