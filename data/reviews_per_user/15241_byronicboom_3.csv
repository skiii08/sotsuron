Requiem for a Dream," Hard Core. Depressing. Great acting!
","I knew this was a heroin movie prior to watching it, however I must warn this is not for the faint at heart.I've always been a fan of Jennifer Connely, however have never seen her in a role like this.Jared Leto is good. Marlon Wayans put in a great performance. I hate to say it, but this was surprising to me. I guess I was narrow minded enough to think of him as a comedian only.Ellen Burstyn (spelling?) was outstanding. In fact, I can't believe she wasn't nominated for an Academy award.The movie covers simple junkies going nowhere, and working together to develop a business/plan on how they can better themselves, however ultimately they fall victim to the drug.Ellen Burstyn gets hooked on uppers prescribed by a non-caring Dr., and ends up enduring shock therapy. BRUTAL!!!",9,0,1,20 October 2005
Life Is Beautiful," Brilliant!
","I don't know how he did it, however Roberto managed to successfully blend tragic drama (The Holocaust) with tasteful comedy. My only complaint is waiting so long to see it.By the way, everyone will be committing a dis-service by watching this in English. Please watch in the spoken Italian language. You will truly get a better feel for the emotions. I assure you after 5 minutes you will not find the subtitles hard to follow.I look forward to viewing other movies by Roberto Benigni. I understand he recently released a movie covering the war in Iraq.",10,1,4,20 October 2005
Trainspotting," Should have been a contender!
","It's a shame the US press blasted this movie as 'glorifying' heroin use. Absolutely not true! This film shows friends some addicts others with different problems all together go through a few journeys.Ewen MacGreggor (spelling?) is great. His withdrawal attempts are both funny, and dramatic. This movie is not a comedy, however does have a few well timed creative humor moments. This is another flick not meant for the faint at heart. There is a death due to feline fecal poisoning, and a baby death due to severe neglect.Robert Caryle also does a great job portraying a non heroin addicted madman.",9,1,1,20 October 2005
