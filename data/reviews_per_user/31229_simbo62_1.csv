Kill Bill: Vol. 2," Why make references?
","I quite liked this movie, not as much as the 1st, but there you go, anyway, Tarantino skillfully and stylishly made SUBTLE references in Pulp Fiction (e.g. the milkshake thing), Reservoir Dogs and his screenplay to True Romance, but when they're so open, where's the fun? It sort of ruins it, and looks like he's simply making an 'Ode to '60s westerns' or an ode to 70s samurai movies. There really was no point in overloading it with these (i'm sure there were a whole lot more i didn't get as well!); he's shown that he's a cinephile (to say the least), why not stop all these references which have been the substance of the downfall of his worst movie to date?",Null,3,5,20 April 2004
