Star Wars: Episode IX - The Rise of Skywalker," Corny dialogue, predictable, simplistic
","One of the worst star wars. The dialog was so corny people cringed in the audience. No one clapped in any point. No laugh out loud moments. So predictable.
The first ever star wars was best..then since then it seems to be going downhill with each one. Even the acting was just bad.",1,21,35,25 December 2019
Star Wars: Episode IX - The Rise of Skywalker," bad CORNY dialog, not hilarious, simplistic, worst star wars
",The dialog was boring and so corny. In the cinemas (partly empty cinema) no one clapped and many scenes people were rolling their eyes thinking how corny and cringeworthy.The acting was just over-acting gone bad.Even the way Luke skywalker raises his jet from ocean looked not believable and silly. People laughed instead of being in awe.Many scenes were literally taken out of the1960s HK magic kung fu movies. The scene where Kylo Ren and Rey have their hands in air trying to manipulate a craft in the air is almost same as the old Hong kong Black and white movies. People laughed.and the scene where Kylo saves Rey healing her and he dies is almost same as the old HK kung fu movies. And they didnt even make it convincing. The old Chow Yun Fat kung fu movies where he did same use hand to heal then die while saving girl fighter was more convincing.The show script was bad. They suddenly find a dagger with the code where to find the gps thing was just silly.The whole snake scene was so fake and ridixulous it looked like it was from the bad movie Anacondas or whatever. Just so ridiculous.The ending was just nothing. No one clapped. Just everyone saying..'was that it'?The jokes were not funny.I was just thinking when is the good part coming?The big wave scenes were ok only because the CGI team literally copied that big wave in Portugal.The fight scenes were like from a B rated bad HK movie...even the Crouching Tiger Hidden Dragon fight scenes had way better and more realistic effects.In beginning when Rey is training she jumps or runs across a big gap looked so unrealistic that her foot steps werent even in sync with her motion. So bad. Even The Matrix had more realistic actions.The whole.story was bad. No tear jerking moments.In the end her grandad says you kill me and my spirit will goto to you. She still kills him but somehow his spirit doesnt goto her anymore because Kylo is there??Also since the first ever star wars its gone downhill with each one. I remember watching the first ever star wars in cinema and people were on their feet at the end clapping.This new and last movie just sucked. I was wondering why the cinema was half empty.I would give minus stars if I could.Whole movie was so predictable.,1,22,37,25 December 2019
The Mist," spectacilar tense brilliant
",I have watched this over 20 times and it never gets boring. Great story and script.,9,1,1,10 January 2020
Parasite," totally overrated
",Good but definitely not worth an Oscar for best movie or best director.,5,11,16,26 February 2020
Black Panther," its ok but so overrated
",Its good but I felt it was so overrated. I prefer the Welsey Snipes black superhero movies. Much more authentic.,1,3,8,19 May 2019
