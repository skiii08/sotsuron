Requiem for a Dream," Bone-chilling...in a good way.
","Let's just start by saying that this movie is dark. It does not really care about the people watching it, it'll just go on with it's own stuff.The story of this movie is excellent, honestly fantastic. It kept me on the edge of my seat all the time watching it (even though it is not a thriller, but a drama). The story honestly scared me, and I usually don't get scared by movies. It was even scarier then all horror movies out there. IT's scary because of how realistic it is, the consequences in this movie can happen in real life (DO NOT DO DRUGS, PEOPLE!). The characters are perfectly portrayed in this movie by their respective actors. Fun fact: Jared Leto who played Harry in this movie actually befriended a couple junkies for this movie just so he could get an idea of how the drug problems were...he also lost a lot of weight. And let's not forget that beautiful theme tune that I am surprised didn't get an Oscar for best soundtrack.Requiem For A Dream is one of the scariest non-horror movies of all time and will to me be one of the greatest movies ever.",10,0,1,4 December 2013
Fight Club," How could I not love it?
","This movie has everything I want in a movie. An intriguing and original story, great acting, good music, amazing camera work and cinematography and one of the best endings in movie history. This movie also happens to be one of the (most surprisingly) funniest movies ever made. This movie really test what kind of humor you like. The humor in this movie is incredibly dark and make you doubt if you're a bad person or not... I am a bad person. David Fincher's direction is so meticulous and amazing that the movie becomes a visual spectacle. The scenes look so dark and excellent that it just enhances the experience. I know people will call this movie a 'Testosterone filled man- movie'. Not having any contrast at all. I have to gently disagree. Did you notice any of the homo-erotic undertones. It also got a lot of great philosophy throughout. I am not condoning the actions of badass Tyler Durden. But I see where he's coming from with a lot of stuff. This movie is a f***ing masterpiece. I love it and it is my favorite movie of all time, not changing my mind now. 10/10.",10,0,2,17 November 2014
The Hunger Games," Hunger Games...
","Let's start by mentioning that I don't hate every teen book ever made. I don't even hate every adaptation (Mainly because I haven't seen them yet or read the books). So my expectations for this movie were... nowhere to be found. This movie is littered with great actors (Jennifer Lawrence, Woody Harrelson, Donald Sutherland, etc.) who don't get to show their best. I am not saying their performances are bad but they are rather not as good as they could be. This movie also has Lenny Kravitz for whatever reason... that's odd. The camera work (While not the worst I have seen) is not good. I know you studios want more money and therefore want to keep a PG-13 rating... but don't put the shaky-cam in every f***ing scene. It is annoying and not well done. If you wanted it to be good you should have gotten Paul Greengrass who is a master of shaky-cam usage.The music is generic (But good).The story is a blatant rip off of 'Battle Royale' (Which I for the record haven't seen but I am familiar with the story). The execution isn't that bad but I would rather call it sloppy than masterful. Also, what the hell is up with the movie taking like and hour and a half to get to the games themselves? I know you need build-up but the pacing in this movie is so awkward and inconsistent that it annoys me.And why does every dystopian future thing need crazy hair and clothing... it is getting annoying. And they managed to make Elizabeth Banks unattractive... thanks... ass-hats.Overall the movie isn't very good but it is at least worth a rental.",6,0,2,17 November 2014
Terminator 2: Judgment Day," Dun Dun Dun Dun Dun
","'Terminator 2: Judgment Day' is one of the single handedly greatest action movies of all time. Not only in a sci-fi way, but as an action movie in general. Arnold travels back in time to protect young John Connor (Edward Furlong) from the intimidating and awesome villain, T-1000 (Robert Patrick). The story is more complex in it's entirety than that, but just that plot line sounds interesting in general. The story is great, the performances are overall great, the score by Brad Fiedel is awesome, the visual effects are really good and the action is fast-paced and visceral. I also love the inclusion of the Guns 'n' Roses song 'You Could be mine' simply because I love Guns 'n' Roses.This movie is one of the best action movies ever and just one of the best movies in general. I highly recommend this to everyone. DISCLAIMER: I think that this is one of the few times where the sequel surpasses the original.",10,2,4,4 December 2014
American History X," Complex and Amazing.
","By complex I do not mean mindf***, I mean that it got a lot of layers of story and character. The story of how Derek Vinyard (Edward Norton) tries to get his younger brother Danny (Edward Furlong) out of the neo-Nazi life is multi-layered, intelligent and emotional. It kept me interested throughout the entirety of the runtime and it even made me a little heavy on emotions. Not only is the story great, the performances in the movie are phenomenal, especially Edward Norton. The guy should've won the Academy Award for Best Leading Actor back then. The dark and haunting score helps lift the atmosphere of the movie to new heights. And the way it is directed (cinematography and such) just adds to everything. The way they use grey scale for Flashbacks is something I just simply adore.This movie is fantastic in every way possible. It is definitely one of my favorite movies and I highly recommend it. DISCLAIMER: This movie isn't always easy to watch.",10,3,6,4 December 2014
The Pianist," Want to get depressed? Here you go!
","This movie is sad. But not in a bad way. If you feel bad after watching this movie, you do have a soul. The awful things the titular character went through are terrible and it makes me feel depressed... in the right way.The story is incredibly well-crafted and heartbreaking, the acting is superb, the music is fantastic and the sets are fantastically real. There are parts in the story that really make me feel terrible on the inside and that not only means the movie does a good job, but it also shows I have a soul.This is not a feelgood flick, not by any chance. So this isn't something you want to show your date if you wanna get a little action. This is a beautiful and incredible biography about one of the greatest musicians ever. This definitely gets the seal of approval from me.",10,0,0,1 December 2014
Gone Girl," Fincher at his finest
","I had not heard about 'Gone Girl' before September 2014. I discovered it when I decided to check David Fincher's filmography one day. 'A new Fincher movie!? Awesome!' were the thoughts that flew through me. Unfortunately I didn't get to see it in theatres, but I did get to see it after a while.The story is dark and superbly crafted. It is rare to find a story with such a simple premise yet such a complex execution. You'll second guess yourself every scene to what is going on yet you will always be wrong. The acting is also really great with Affleck and Pike giving truly great performances. And yes, I had no problem with Tyler Perry. The score by Trent Reznor & Atticus Ross was great as always. And of course, the direction by David Fincher is superb. It is rare to find a director as great as him working today. Overall this movie is great and should not be missed. But be warned, this movie is quite disturbing.",10,2,8,5 February 2015
Inception," Bwaaaaah
","I am sorry, putting the horn in the title just amuses me. 'Inception' is not only incredibly ambitious and a bit of a gamble but it is also one of the most intelligent movies ever created. But you know what the gambling gave us? One of the most intelligent, visually striking and coolest movies ever made. I love this movie in every way that you could love it. The story is intriguing and well-crafted, the performances are great, the score by Hans Zimmer is unforgettable and the visual effects are tremendous. The ending also leaves A LOT to interpretation, which I adore. The action in this movie is also really well done, especially in the parts where they utilize the different rules and physics of the dream. 'Inception' is a well-crafted masterpiece and is definitely one of my favorite movies. It definitely gets the seal of approval.",10,1,2,1 December 2014
The Emperor's New Groove," Instant classic
","When I saw the trailer on the VHS tapes for other Disney movies I was a bit skeptical. Then at the age of 8 it went on TV and I thought of giving it a chance...and that was a great idea. The story itself is nice and easy enough to follow and had a great dose of great Disney comedy (before Disney went complete *beep* with it's terrible sitcoms). The characters are not just characters, they have great personalities even if Kuzco is a bit of a dick in the beginning. The characters are also excellently voiced.This movie became an instant classic to me when I saw it even though it is still one of the shorter Disney movies (77 minutes). If you find this for a decent enough price or in a bargain bin, I recommend you to pick it up.",9,1,2,4 December 2013
