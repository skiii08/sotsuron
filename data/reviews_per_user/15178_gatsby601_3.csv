Blade Runner 2049," When a Blade Loses It's Edge.
","Beautiful and empty Bladerunner 2049 is the needless squeal to the 1980s classic.Set 30+ years after the events of the first film we meet Ryan Gosling continuing in the Bladerunner tradition of shooting robots. Along the way, he discovers a great secret that might change the social order of a world that is made up of humans and they're purpose built slaves.All of that was covered in the first 20 minutes of the film by the way. Skip ahead to the 3rd act, grumpy Harrison Ford shows up and, well, that's about it.Leaving the theatre my wife and I tried to decide just why Bladerunner left us both feeling so indifferent to it's existence. She had never seen the first film, I had, but our feelings were the same. Bladerunner is great to look at and I appreciated the nods to the original, but, it became quickly apparent our apathy stemmed from the fact nothing much happens in this movie.Office K's (Gosling) investigation into a missing person moves at snails pace and none of the people we meet along the way are as interesting as the scenery around them. One example is Wallace (Jared Leto) the new Tyrell and the main villain of the film. His speeches are dull and only go to serve the plot, he leaves all of his serious evilness to his sidekick while he stays home sporting a handicap which must be a desired physical affectation considering how easily it could be treated in his time.The main theme in both Bladerunner movies is one day the slaves will cast off their chains and be free. Sure, there's stuff about love and self-awareness but these are side issues that have been explored elsewhere to better effect. The main focus of 2049 is humanity needs an indentured underclass to do its heavy lifting and either you are for it or against it and that is a pretty thin premise for a movie this long.Late in the film Officer K sits on a deck chair staring out over an irradiated city. He looks like a man lost, not knowing where to go next. This moment is the perfect metaphor for Bladerunner 2049. All of it's surprises are revealed too early on leaving both the audience and characters to mull over the same obvious of choices for the rest of the movie.A wasted opportunity.",7,91,200,14 October 2017
Aquaman," Soggy THOR Clone Reverts to Camp Over Quality
","Two brothers fight over a throne that will allow the winner to guide the destiny of multiple kingdoms/worlds etc. The younger brother is an usurper who lies and murders his way to the crown while the older brother is reluctant to accept the responsibility of the office.Sound familiar?Aquaman is very familiar from the 'sky bridge' needed to enter Atlantis to the quest to be worthy of a signature weapon we've seen this all of this before only done much better.And with Loki. No Loki here. Only lots of CGI fish.I don't mean to pick on Aquaman the character, I didn't expect much from the Wonder Woman film and I came away very impressed and I was willing to give this outing a chance but, God, from the corny dialogue to the idiotic aquatic theme - sharks with lasers strapped to them? - Aquaman is hard to watch after Marvel has raised the bar so high over the last 15+ years.Aquaman starts taking on water early on, with far too many gosh darn earnest speeches about uniting two worlds, a remarkably clumsy origin story designed to explain how Atlantis went from being, you know, up there to down below and worst of all, a main villain so bland the writers added a SECOND supporting villain who pops up every now and again for the odd inconclusive battle.Finally, all of this 1970s Saturday morning cartoon level idiocy drags on for a good two plus hours so be sure to set your wake up call for the 68th minute because that's how long you'll have to wait for the first bit of action that doesn't involve talking to fish.Pixar elevated animated films from kids only dribble to mainstream entertainment because they created interesting characters and thoughtful stories. Richard Donner, Tim Burton and later Marvel would do the same with the superhero films. Basically, they made them better then they had to be. Aquaman is a huge step backwards. Uninspired and dumb I was reminded more of the 1980 Flash Gordon film then anything from recent years. Another bit of evidence that DC is throwing stuff at the wall hoping something will stick.",4,4,14,19 December 2018
Knowing," Knowing It's A Dumb Movie
","Knowing is the latest Nicolas Cage film that seems to be following a theme that started with his National Treasure movies - an educated teacher discovering a great secret before time runs out. Sort of 'The Da Vinci Code' light.This time out Cage is an MIT professor whose son is given a sealed envelope recently recovered from a 30 year old time capsule at the boys school. Unlike a drawing of a spaceship or some other 50s inspired doodle his letter is a series of numbers written by a child with a troubled past.What follows is Cage deciphering the number pattern (rather easily) and racing to avoid disaster, save lives and warn the rest of us idiots who just won't listen.This journey is o.k. as long as you don't take a moment and question the premise. Basically, if this child could see the future why didn't she tell someone at the time instead of locking the information away for 30 years? Maybe so Nick Cage could discover it in the future and for fill his destiny. But then, if 'the strangers' gave the little girl 'the knowing' in the first place why didn't they just clue in Cage directly instead of being needlessly elaborate? I mention destiny because the films final act is very much about this subject. There is a plan for us all, can't escape our fate, cosmic order in the universe and all that sort of thing. Comforting on one level perhaps but it doesn't give Cages character much to do except keep an appointment and hug it out with his estranged father the pastor.If you dig Nicolas Cage this will make a decent rental, there are explosions and the film doesn't run to long. Like the National Treasure movies however it aspires for a depth that just isn't there, it wants to be an insightful thinking mans adventure but in the end is little more then a shallow idea produced only as well as it needs to be.",2,1,3,8 December 2009
