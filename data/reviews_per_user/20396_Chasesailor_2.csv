The New World," this movie blows
",I was able to see this movie back in December for the aspen film fest and was sad to say it was the biggest piece of crap Terrance mallick has ever directed. Mallick is a great cinamotographer but is mentally retarded when it comes to directing. this is something he should not be able to do to anyone ever again. if you read this and think I'm dumb and decide to see the movie anyway don't say i didn't warn you. this movie wasted two and a half hours of my life that i can never get back. If you have any common since you will take my advice and not waste your money on this junky movie. if you absolutely must see it wait till this piece of crap comes out on DVD. if you hated thin red line you will absolutely hate this piece of crap.,1,4,10,3 March 2006
The Hills Have Eyes," IT Was OK
",This movie was OK but it got kinda slow in the middle. I'm not saying it wasn't freakin sweet in some points but i am saying it sure as hell wasn't the best movie i have ever seen.Now when i saw the previews for this movie i thought well hell finally a good scary movie. that kinda backfired on me. this movie had you on the edge of your seat a couple of times and sure a couple of times you jumped but all in all it really wasn't the frightfest i had expected to see. now if you have yet to see the movie let me tell you this is one of the goriest I've seen in a while. now i don't know if you remember that movie Wrong Turn that came out a few years back. you know the one about those guys who get chased through the Forrest in Virginia trying not to get eaten by mutants. this is damn near the exact same story. except in this movie you have an explanation to why there are some mutants trying to kill and eat people. But what I'm trying to say is that this is basically the exact same movie but with a different title and location. If you liked wrong turn you are bound to enjoy this kill fest.,7,1,2,14 March 2006
