Creed," 'Old School meets New School'
","Adonis Johnson (Michael B. Johnson – Fruitvale Station) is an angry young man that quits his comfortable West Coast life with a top finance management job, gated mansions and classic cars to follow his passion and dreams in the footsteps of legends. Showing how people progress within the American Dream, with champ Apollo Creed fighting himself to glory leaving a financial security and leaving no need for his children to follow him in the ring where death is at risk. But how some times you just got to follow your heart, to be independent, and build your own strong bonds. As in all Rocky films director and writer Ryan Coogler (Fruitvale Station) and producer Sylvester 'Sly' Stallone showcase the everyday struggle in life where everyone has their own challengers and where everyday is a fight. In this tribute to the streets of Philly with the score by Swedish composer Ludwig Göransson who explored the city's rich music scene together with Tessa Thompson to create nine original songs for this motion picture, as well as the famous Philly steaks, dirt bikes, icon Kobe Bryant and the classic Rocky films with story lines, characters and places like Mickey's Gym, the stairs, they show awareness to these issues and health issues such as cancer and hearing problems. Meet the seducing Bianca (Tessa Thompson) who Donnie meets after moving to area of the famous Rocky Balboa to find the man who once beat his father and shortly after disappeared from the family and scene. With a tight knitted team Adonis 'Donnie' Johnson-Creed advances quick and lands a dream fight in Liverpool, England, to make show everyone he is not a mistake. The film is pretty predictable like all Rocky films and lacks the build up and excitement the previous first four films achieved. The beginning is pretty fresh and leads you to think it would be more fight and grit than just the drama that takes place. It does follow in the footsteps of Rocky in a lot of ways, and you do miss legendary characters Paulie and Adrian without anyone reaching out to grab their place but it sure has set-up for a new Rocky legacy with the new tag-team Creed and Balboa in many sequels to follow.",5,9,17,25 January 2016
Black Mass," BLACK MASS - 'Don't read everything it says in the papers'
","Told through the right hand men of FBI's Most Wanted for 12 years, only being second to Osama Bin Laden and with a capture reward that is as high as it gets. Director Scott Cooper's (Out of the Furnace + Crazy Heart) crime-drama biopic tells the story about three boys of the streets of South Boston that grow up to become the main men that changed the landscape of the city forever. In particular one person, the man that became the most notorious gangster in Americas history, James 'Whitey' Bulger (Johnny Depp). The ice-cold ruthless killer that led the Irish Mob from South Boston known as 'Southie' develops from a small time crook to become the true Kingpin of Boston while his brother William 'Billy Boy' Bulger (Benedict Cumberbatch) becomes the other most powerful person of the city as State Senator. John Connolly (Joel Edgerton) returns in 1981 to Boston as the top FBI agent with a mission to bring down the Cosa Nostra led by the Italian Mafia brothers Angiulo in Boston's North End. Allying with the boy that once saved him out of a fight during their childhood years, and helping his brother Billy run for office years later, while staying loyal to the law of the streets built on trust honor and blood, his respect towards the brothers together with their bond from their younger years creates an unbreakable pack. As Whitey tells it, ' We will get the FBI to fight our wars!'.After Whitey's son dies in 1982 and his mother in 1985 he truly looses it all and with nothing else to cherish apart from his crime syndicate he becomes the true drug lord of Boston and his alliance with the FBI makes him untouchable. The Irish psychopath was involved in everything from drugs, racketeering, inciting, and killing to joining forces with IRA supporting them in the fight against the English in Northern Ireland. When the real truth gets out exposing how deep and wide spread it was, it all starts spinning out of control and the people involved can't handle the heat when the people high up want answers. To protect themselves they start spilling the beans on everything and everyone. The American government want people held responsible and someone has to pay for it. Can the loyalty towards Whitey and between the three stay true or do they all loose out in the end?'You were just saying? 'Just saying' gets people sent away. 'Just saying' got me a nine-year stretch in Alcatraz, you understand? So, 'just saying' can get you buried real quick.'Both Johnny Depp and Joel Edgerton do great comebacks with impressive Oscar- nomination performances based on the New York Times Best Seller 'Black Mass: The True Story of an Unholy Alliance Between the FBI and the Irish Mob' written by Dick Lehr and Gerard O'Neill. Dakota Johnson returns as Whitey's wife Lindsey Cyr since her latest blockbuster movie Fifty Shades of Grey. Benedict Cumberbatch (The Imitation Game), Peter Sarsgaard (Pawn Sacrifice), Kevin Bacon, Jesse Plemons, Julianne Nicholson, Rory Cochrane, Adam Scott and Corey Stoll also feature.I am no big fan of the praised The Departed which is another story based on Whitey with Jack Nicholson playing the James 'Whitey' Bulger character and Leonardo Di Caprio with Matt Damon in the other lead roles. While Black Mass doesn't reach its true potential for me it still delivers a dark and grim true reality completed with good performances by the entire cast. I will definitely be watching this one again though when it is released on Bluray. Black Mass is a great film with some chilling scenes that gets you off your seat, though it lacks the natural flow and speed to hit the status of a true iconic gangster film. Saying that would Martin Scorsese(Goodfellas, Casino, The Departed) have made an even better film out of it?'Don't read everything it says in the papers' – James 'Whitey' BulgurFor more on James 'Whitey' Bulgur and the biggest crime case of Boston checkout Joe Berlingers (The Paradise Lost films): WHITEY: UNITED STATES OF America VS JAMES J. BULGER from 2014.",8,1,9,22 September 2015
Interstellar," Gravity Saves The World!
","The last feature film ever to be projected on 15/70mm IMAX film with breath-taking and eye- catching cinematography composed with a reinvented Hans Zimmer soundtrack. Christopher Nolan's 9th feature film is a modern sci-fi blockbuster about time travel (the relative theory), humanity, society, evolution, nature, science, life, history and the future of The Planet Earth. Physicist Kip Thorne whose work the screenplay is based on describes the story as 'based on warped space-time – the most exotic events in the universe suddenly becoming accessible to humans'. Texas native Matthew McConaughey outshines most of the cast as he usually does as Cooper, an NASA educated southern farmer in this epic space journey about saving the world. Some of the impressive shots were right up there with when watching Star Wars for the first time as a young boy. I found myself gobsmacked and just starring at the incredible work cinematographer Hoyte Van Hoytema produced for this master piece of art. Not to be so surprised as Christopher Nolan used Star Wars: Episode IV – A New Hope (1977) as well as 2001: A Space Odyssey (1968) and Blade Runner (1982) for inspiration for this modern day adventurous science fiction movie. A very intelligent produced film that entertains you, asks questions and will probably make you shed a tear. Interstellar should rake in the Oscars at the up coming Academy Awards (The Oscars 2015), and is also set up so it can be continued, I sure hope a film series is made out of it. / Peter A Eldon. 2014-11-03.",10,0,3,10 November 2014
American Sniper," An insight to the life of the extraordinary American Sniper Chris Kyle, North America's most lethal sniper throughout the U.S. military history by Director Clint Eastwood.

Bradley Cooper, a two-time Oscar nominee for his work in 'Silver Linings Playbook' and 'American Hustle,' Cooper heads the cast with yet another very good performance, which also includes Sienna Miller (HBO's 'The Girl') as Chris Kyle's wife Taya Kyle, Navid Negahban, Jake McDorman, Keir O'Donnell, and Luke Grimes.

Foxcatcher," True story portraying the tragic Blue Collar VS Billionaire story of The Schultz Brothers & John DuPont
","Written by Oscar-nominee Dan Futterman and E. Max Frye, Foxcatcher is based on the true-story about the odd disturbed billionaire John DuPont and Olympic winning brothers Marc and Dave Schultz. DuPont uses all his wealth and position in society to gain huge success and acknowledgement from his follow Americans, Sport Federations and Mother. In very smart and touching ways Foxcatcher shows and describes the true mentality and daily challenges everyone in society has. With subjects like loneliness, society, family, wealth, hierarchy and various social- classes Director Bennet Miller has combined it all together and shows how and why the fateful actions happen. Do the extremely wealthy such as the DuPont's have more pressure to succeed than the Schultz's? Who is more trapped? Sometimes the film feels just to slow with really nothing happening while the camera captures the stillness of the nature and events developing in front of it, but at the same time that is exactly what Foxcatcher is portraying. Excellent acting by the whole leading cast (Channing Tatum, Mark Ruffalo, Sienna Miller) with a never before seen acting performance by Steve Carrell as the odd billionaire John DuPont. He will definitely be competing against Benedict Cumberbatch (The Imitation Game) and Matthew McConaughey (Interstellar) for an Oscar. / Peter A Eldon. 2014-10-24.",8,11,22,10 November 2014

Pawn Sacrifice," Pawn Sacrifice - Who is the true pawn in this game?
","Welcome to the complex, neurotic and paranoid mind of the quirky and tragic Bobby Fischer, played by the impressive Toby Maguire. In this true story you see the young chess prodigy become a pawn for the American government during the Cold War against the Russians while battling his own madness. The tensions that made this genius believe that the Jews and Russians conspired in consistently trying to make him fail that led to his true fall and his anti-semitic views. Director Ed Zwick's Pawn Sacrifice gives a snapshot of time in this Cold War clash set during the 1972 World Chess Championship in Iceland. Following the build up and actual game to what is known as the worlds best ever played chess match* between the one and only American chess world champion Bobby Fischer and his Russian counterpart Boris Spassky.Liev Schreiber plays the very cool and reigning chess champion Spassky, speaking every word of his dialogue in Russian, a language he didn't know at all before taking on this role. Schreiber and other supporting roles by Peter Sarsgaard his (Fischer) confidante and 'chess whisperer' and Fischers lawyer played by Michael Stuhlbarg should all be thought of for an Oscar nomination for Best Supporting Actor. As in earlier roles Toby Maguire delivers a well executed performance that should could lead to an Oscar as well. He also produced the film together with director Ed Zwick and Gail Katz after spending the better part of a decade developing the film for his production company, Material Pictures. The only real little down-side about the movie was that it tended to be a bit repetitive leaving it a bit to long.'It's really the free world against the lying, cheating, hypocritical Russians,' - Bobby FischerRobert James 'Bobby' Fischer born in Brooklyn was the man who won everything and achieved the highest price becoming world champion and a super star of his time. After all that success he derailed severely with his illness retiring from chess the same year he became world champion saying no to millions in commercial endorsements, loosing his world champion title and following legal trouble in his homeland of America because he violated U.S. restrictions on participating in chess events in Yugoslavia he got asylum in Iceland and died on January 17th 2008.* The match was played over 26 games with game 6 known as the best ever chess match played.",6,2,6,15 September 2015
The Imitation Game," 'Sometimes it is the people no one imagines anything of who do the things that no one can imagine.'
","Based on the book: Alan Turing – The Enigma, this is a very touching drama film about the genius man 'who made the single biggest contribution to winning the war' (Winston Churchill) by breaking the Engima code and in the aftermath was treated so badly by the British Government. The cast and the chemistry between them are electrifying with an extraordinary good authentic performance by Benedict Cumberbatch that could lead to an Oscar. With a quick witty sense of humour and dialogue Morten Tydlum's first English speaking motion picture starts very exiting like a real classic espionage thriller but looses it's excitement and only has some peaks throughout the film. It doesn't reach a masterwork piece like other classic nerve biting films, but is not far off from the modern classic Tinker Tailor Toy Soldier by Tomas Alfredson. In the film they show how peoples and societies fears, lack of knowledge and opinions took and keep taking away innocent people and heroes! The Imitation Game is a very well made film that will be awarded and remembered for the quality, the story and the awareness of history and individuality of people it brings up. / Peter A Eldon. 2014-11-05.",8,4,9,10 November 2014

Jurassic World has got some good casting with the likes of the entertaining Chris Pratt, the charming Omar Sy, funny guy Jake Johnson, Judy Greer, Bryce Dallas Howard, Irrfan Khan, and with the original Jurassic Park BD Wong as Dr Henry Wu. Unfortunately the script and dialogue don't really make it happen for them to succeed.

I believe a lot of people can say they know somebody similar to the characters of Ana and Christian. Fifty Shades of Grey also gives you the impression that everyone is a product of his or her own experiences and society. They also get it right with the casting, the editing, parts of the soundtrack and cinematography, especially while showing the more dramatised intimate scenes and the ' seductive glamour of the high-end rich city swagger life'.A lot of people will be leaving the cinema with a secret crush on either or both Dakota Johnson and Jamie Dornan while feeling they want in on some action!
