Resident Evil: Afterlife," Sigh...Just play the game. Seriously.
","Horrible. Simply put. Anderson say's that he's a fan of Resident Evil. I bet you the only bit of the game he got was walking past some family members who was playing the game; stopped and was like 'Ooh that's cool! I'm gonna put that in my movie, DERP!' I'm happy that Capcom switched things up with Resident Evil 4 and 5 with the whole Las Plagas thing and stopped with the whole T-Virus bull crap that's been done over to death by Anderson. And why was The Executioner from Resident Evil 5 in the game? As cool as he looked...I just did not understand it. And the Majini. They made them into...tunneling zombies. WHAT THE FLIP.Crappy 3-D. Even when using James Cameron's new 3-D cameras; it doesn't reach the caliber of Avatar. You need to give those cameras to someone who can do it better. Another gripe was the never ending bullet time! The Matrix was how many years ago? And guess what Anderson? The Wachowski Brothers still do it better. Even Zack Snyder does it better.Also Milla Jovovich. I know you can act. I seen you in the movie Dummy and loved you! Just because Anderson is your husband doesn't mean you have to be his cash-cow. Please go back to indie films and movies that have meaning or you can go back to making music. Anything but shitty movies. PLEASE.*sighs heavily* If you want a true Resident Evil experience...Get Resident Evil 0-5...and pull an all-nighter. Seriously. Get the depends and the mountain dew, order some pizza, turn off the lights and go for it. You'll get more suspense and atmosphere in these games than these movies ever will give you.I hope this helped.",2,21,44,10 September 2010
