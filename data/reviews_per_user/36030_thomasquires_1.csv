The Benchwarmers," You Have To Love It
","I think everybody did an excellent job in this movie. It was a little fast but it was great. Some cheesy parts but a good family comedy and an all around comedy for nerds, baseball players, and pretty much anybody. Go see it while it is out you will laugh cry and laugh a lot more. Give it up for Jon Heeder. Great performance if i do say so myself. All actors were perfect except for a few kids. Bottom line go see the movie you will love it. The movie was full of awesome jokes, one liners and it couldn't of been funnier. If you go and see it you will be laughing the whole time. By the time you stop laughing at one part you will be laughing at the next part. Where can you go wrong.",10,1,3,14 April 2006
