I liked this film but I still cannot spot the main theme of the story.I think there are several of them such as love, difficult childhood , taking drugs and so on...It is very bright and vibrant thanks to awesome actors' outfits and wonderful music.
Such films are always interesting to watch and learn about the lives of famous people. People who influenced the history of music and the lives of many people.To sum it up, I can say that the film 'Walk the Line' is an excellent biography of a famous person, and even those who do not know him, I advise you to watch this film, because it's interesting and informative. And the movie itself will bring a great mood and pleasure while watching . Definately I recommend it",10,0,0,9 March 2018
