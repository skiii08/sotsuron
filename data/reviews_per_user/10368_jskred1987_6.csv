Catch Me If You Can," if the wasnt a real story - you wouldnt believe it could happen
","i went to see this movie thinking that leonardo dicaprio was a lame assed, boyish wimp and that hank played, well, hanks.But now i am making a public apology.This film has style, will make you laugh out loud and make you wish that you had the guts to do what frank abignail did.(i mean the classroom insedent!!!). leonardo played the age ranges extremely well, i dont know of many actors that can portray a 15 year to 25 year old in the space of three hours.even though he was a decieving con man,i found myself routing for him.He and tom Hanks complimented each other well, without trying to out act.Hanks also told some great knock knock jokes!Christopher walken was also excellent, as were the rest of the cast and backed by great directing. May not be a repeat watch , but definatly not to be missed.SEE IT NOW!",Null,0,1,16 February 2003
The Ring," if u dont find this film scary u are very disturbed or i lier.
","Becca: Have you heard the story about this weird videotape that kills you when you watch it? When you watch it, it looks like someone's nightmare. After you watch it, your phone rings. You pick it up and the voice on the other line says ' YOU WILL DIE IN SEVEN DAYS.' (I wont tell you the plot or cast because hell movie data base. So, this is just my opinion.) 
At the start the ring looks and sounds very urban legend teen horror you know the deal hyped up teen running around in reveling out fits screaming and swearing. But this is not the ring it deeper darker and terrifying. The ring makes you think the ring made me shake the ring nearly made me cry. It a horror film that brings back the art of film making instead of resorting to predictable shock scares every second of screen time is chilling. Yule be calling for your mum by the time the credits roll. Ps. I'm throwing away my VCR.",Null,0,0,21 February 2003
The Bourne Identity," whos better? Bourne V Bond
","Jason Bourne: I can tell you the license numbers of all six cars outside. I can tell you the waitress is left-handed. I can tell you the guy sitting at the bar weighs two hundred fifteen pounds and knows how to handle himself, I know the best place to look for a gun is the cab of the gray truck outside, and I know that at this altitude, I can run flat out for a half a mile before my hands start shaking. Now why would I know that? How can I know that and not know who I am?This is a great spy movie it sheik and stylish. However, bond it is not (thank god). There are no stupid gadgets and no point less puns, they are repacked with style and thought Bourne is an intelligent spy who use his brains instead of jumping into a situation headfirst. For example looking at a map before a car chase how many times have you seen bond do that huh. 
The fact that this film is set entirely in Europe makes it individual and gives it a little something extra, which is always good. The great cast grip your attention add Damon is a brilliant he shows Bourne strengths and weakness and give him a human quality. Over all the film is great and defiantly worth watching. So I'm biest but give me Bourne over Bond any day.",Null,1,2,21 February 2003
Ocean's Eleven," cool as a cucumber
",".This is a slicker than slick film .a catchy sound track feathering inspired original compositions, cool imagery a great heist and elegant performances for the entire cast the classiest film in years an over night classic reminiscent of old Hollywood glamour and sophistication. Soderbergh is a true filmmaker and artist. Resist the urge to strut. Watch enjoy and love.",10,0,0,16 February 2003
Saving Private Ryan," O what a bloody war.
","Captain John Miller: James... I'm here to tell you your brothers were killed in combat. They're dead. Private Ryan: Which one, sir? Captain John Miller: All of them.This is the most realistic war film I have ever seen it relay shows the horror and point less ness of all wars not just world war II.People say that it is hared to sit though the first hour but I think that if you don't sit though the first hour you are missing the point. The first hour is war. War is death blood and murder and the rest of the film is the aftermath the affect war has on inveigles.Every single member of cast and crew should be commended on the quality of this film.Ps. I also think that George Bush and Tony Blair should be treated to a private screening.",7,0,0,22 February 2003
Donnie Darko," if you are diffent this is the film for you
","I had wanted to see this film since September 2002 and I finally got to see it in January 2003 when I cault one of only two showings at Gloucester's guild hall and it was worth the wait. This is the most brilliant and most confusing film I have ever seen and it is not like any other film I have seen. it stretches the bonders of fantasy and reality as well as dealing with teenage confession, love, life ,fear, and death. Written and directed by Richard Kelly and crated with an outstanding cast in 28 days with a tiny budget . Ultimately the story is about 15 year old Donnie darko played by Jake Gyllenhaal. Donnie is a complex, frightened and disturbed wacko ? Donnie also knows that in Twenty-eight days... six hours... forty-two minutes... twelve seconds the world will come to an end, he knows this because he was told by a six foot bunny rabbit called frank. Now you begin to understand the madness of this film but it is only after you have watched it do you begin to under stand the brilliants. If you see one film this decade please make it Donnie Darko .",10,0,1,20 February 2003
