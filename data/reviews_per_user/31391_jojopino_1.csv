Hereditary," Baffled.
",By far one of the most disjointed movies I have ever seen. Just horrible. The acting was the only redeemable part. I can only hope for the writer and cast sake that the editing ruined the storyline. It makes no sense. I'm smart enough to connect the dots but if I were a director I would not have seen the end product and released it as it was. I don't recommend this as a rental or even as a late night TNT movie when nothing else is on. Infomercials are better constructed. I am going directly to have a stiff drink and hope to erase all memory or this atrocity.,1,4,8,6 July 2018
