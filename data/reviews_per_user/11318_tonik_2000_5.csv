Changeling," Angie's bad in this one.
","I just want to say that I think Angie must have been surrounded by too many Yes Men during the filming of this who wanted to make her think they appreciated her showing up for their movie so intensely that they were too timid to tell her to furthermore ACT during it. She's horrible in this. She doesn't even begin to fit the part and acts like a walking corpse throughout the entire film. Or maybe walking lips? In this movie we're watching Angelina Jolie in bad makeup and a flapper costume, not Christine Collins who lost a son. And someone needs to advise her to eat or at least hydrate more, she's looking exceptionally gaunt which was not the desired appearance of women in the 20's. Probably another thing her Yes Men dared not suggest, that she put on a little weight for the movie. This movie could have been good. Maybe Mr. Eastwood just wanted to 'work with' Angelina and take her out for dinner afterward, who knows.",6,1,4,1 July 2014
Lords of Dogtown," Everyone is just so sassy
","The only thing I came here to say after watching this movie repeatedly for a couple days is... the characters are a bunch of unkind, sassy, aloof bullies. I get that maybe that's what they are going for as it is kind of a rough town and therefore... but it's very tiresome, and the only one who didn't behave like an embittered child was the guy who played Stacy, he seemed like a sweet kid. The characters could be so much more than the sorta mean, goofy brat formula they all stick to. That alone makes the plot as weak and predictable as it is. But, I like the movie, because I find California in general fascinating, and it definitely takes you there. But I have a hard time liking the one-sided characters. Let me put it this way, almost EVERYONE in this movie is sort of an a-hole. It's hard to want to be a part of this group of, let me just say self-centered arrogant kids, I gave that up entirely by 8th grade. I like Hardwicke's Thirteen VERY much, but that was because there was a lot of emotion and substance to its plot, (and I love the California atmosphere throughout) and it was relatable. This movie isn't what I would call very relatable unless you're a skater or surfer with some kind of chip on your shoulder. But it is OK entertainment, and not too bad a movie. Nice to see Heath Ledger again. And it really brought to life how skating became as popular as it is, which was interesting.",7,0,0,29 February 2020
American Hustle," Shameless wannabe Scorcese
","Was this one directed by Scorcese? My first question, which was answered pretty quickly by the next of my questions: Was it instead a shameless imitation of all things Scorcese? Including the repeated drawn-out, starting from a far-away point, closeups, and camera follows, which happened every other scene segue, and the dated rock n' roll fed into the soundtrack. Also, THE ACTING WAS HORRIBLE IN THIS MOVIE! Everyone just half-ass mumbled their way through the unintelligible script with bad accents and every clich√© imaginable! I get it... America steps back and takes a look at itself in all its evil glory. TOPIC DONE TO DEATH! I only gave it 2 stars instead of one because an effort was made in wardrobe and cast. Although... if I were one of the actors in this movie I'd hide my head in shame somewhere. No effort was made to turn the actors into actual people living a story! I hated all of them and had no sympathy even for Bale who could have saved this one. All I saw was Jennifer Lawrence, Christian Bale, and the rest dressed up in retro and mumbling for the duration. What the hell happened to this movie and why did it fail so awfully? Maybe the director was too intimidated by the A-listers and didn't have the guts to direct them and just left them to mutter and mumble through the whole thing all by their lonesomes. Awful!",2,1,2,1 December 2014
Jackie," Bad.
","This movie was pretty awful. It painted Jackie as a complete doofus. The continually subtle condescending attitude of the journalist Billy Crudup did everything to keep that a constant theme of this movie. You can see a smug smile in his eyes with almost every question he asks her... as if he's talking to one of the dumbest people on the planet, not the wife of a fallen beloved-by-the-entire-nation, renowned president. Nothing in this movie empowers this poor woman, even her repeated salty remarks to the journalist aren't given respect by him. She is portrayed as vain, boring, predictable. I was expecting a movie that bears her name to show her full complexities, instead it simplifies her. There really isn't a plot, it's extremely straight linear, no falls, no lifts. This whole movie is basically closeups of sad face and crying. Nothing happens that we aren't already aware of, it deals with drawn-out moments before the assassination, the assassination, and the burial. Also, the soundtrack is a minor form of torture. Portman's accent is like a train wreck you can't look away from. Boring. I'm trying to watch a second time to make sure I don't fully dislike it but it's not working.",2,4,7,14 March 2017
Bridesmaids," Demeaning. No one really behaves this way.
","Written by men, obviously. But the part that is sickening is seeing these actresses, a group of intellectually funny women, absorb and accept this script and regurgitate it for the men who wrote it - they may have just bent over for the male writers and the same effect would have been achieved. It makes me sad to see women so subservient to men this way - undignified, brainless. There's a trend going on lately where women are being made to go along with dick and fart humor and act like 'one of the guys.' This is a manipulation of women by men to further men's various appetites and it's disgusting. The writers seemed to think they had some kind of understanding of women and how women relate to each other when all it resulted in was sounding like what a perverted man wants to hear a group of women talking about. Whatever. You know now that I think of it I don't even know if only men wrote this movie, but that just furthers my point, in my opinion. If women wrote this it is the same as if they took direction and acted in the film. Either way it is male-oriented sick humor and females are not generally involved in this nor do they behave this way unless prompted by someone who is mentally manipulative. This has bothered me since I saw this one so I had to say something.",3,1,2,9 January 2015
