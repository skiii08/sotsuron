The Blair Witch Project," If you go down to the woods, PLEASE take more than one camera
","After seeing this film way back when it was released I came out of the theatre struck dumb and feeling rather nauseous. Not due to anything horrifying up on the screen - if only there had been - but simply down to the jerky and repetitive camera-work.Blair Witch is an admirable idea, yet the directors stick too rigidly to their premise. By using one camera they induced seasickness in me, and no doubt a good many other people going by the comments at IMDb. To provoke fear you often have to create a sense of scale and movement - think Jaws, Texas Chainsaw Massacre and Psycho to name but three. Fear is just as much about open spaces and a sense of isolation as it is about dark corners and close-ups. Clearly the premise of the film - three film students, missing for five years - demanded certain limits on the storytelling, yet sometimes you have more to play with than you realise. If the story is that compelling, and in fairness the Blair Witch idea was good, no matter what the vengeful critics say, then you wonder how much better this film might have been had suddenly a second camera appeared, tracking the threesome through the woods. Told lucidly enough, the audience would probably not even question it.Some of the reviewers of this film have been harsh to put it mildly. No, it's not a great horror film, but it is an important one if for no other reason than it shows what can be done with basic equipment and a few thousand dollars.As I write this review, some ten years or so after seeing Blair Witch for the first time, we are in the middle of a recession, yet what d'you know, James Cameron has just spent $300million making Avatar, some ten years after spending $180million to make Titanic.Perhaps what's really bugged the film industry, and even some of the audience, is that two young film-makers found a way to dwarf the mega budget releases of Hollywood with a film that made more money than 90% of Hollywood, yet for no more than thirty thousand dollars.Blair Witch is not great, but it does have something important to say; namely that you don't HAVE to have a $300million budget in order to make a hit film these days. That surely, is reason to be hopeful.",6,1,2,30 May 2010
The Terminator," The other Six Million Dollar Man!
","$100million or more may have been spent to make the much celebrated sequel, but this, the original, stays longest in my mind, and I suspect a good many other people's too.For all the hype about T2, that film simply does not have the narrative drive which is on show here. Fusing the concept of time travel with the theme of assassination, James Cameron's picture has echoes of such classics as Day of the Jackal; the extra twist here of course is that the Terminator would appear to be indestructible. It's as though Steve Austin (TV's Bionic Man) had transformed into Mr Hyde.By creating a tightly written thriller, with an almost claustrophobic sense of tension to it, Cameron proved right at the start of his career he does not need a mega budget to make a great film. Indeed, it's significant to note that the two finest pictures of Cameron's career, critically at least, The Terminator and Aliens, are also the two films with the smallest budgets.T2, Titanic and Avatar have reaped over $4 billion, but hand on heart, can anyone honestly claim those pictures, in regard to writing, direction, and a compelling storyline come anywhere close to the tension and sense of drama which he manages to evoke here in less than a couple of hours? I seriously doubt it.",10,8,11,9 June 2010
The Descent," Have we been here before . . . ?
","Neil Marshall comes up with an idea for a horror film, and once again it smacks of everything from Deliverance to Alien, with more than a little Hammer horror for good measure.The Descent is not a bad film, it's just completely unoriginal as, it seems, are all Marshall's films. The film starts with a clip of an accident, which I think involves a child dying. A year later the narrative picks up with six women uniting for a bonding trip as they go potholing. The mother of the dead child is on board, as well as one of the women who is, I think, subconsciously blamed for the accident. Either way, one of these women has 'issues' which you just know are going to come to a head at some point in a 'big scene' involving a confrontation and a few home truths.Talking of truths, whenever I watch a Marshall movie I always get the sense I am watching a soap opera. Something like EastEnders. In other words something that tends to repeat itself over and over again.After watching Dog Soldiers it confirmed my suspicion that Marshall, not unlike Wes Craven, is a man who can take an interesting premise and absolutely slaughter it up on the screen; and no, that's not a compliment, even though a horror director might take it as one.Put simply The Descent is merely a mishmash of other horror films. There is a little of Deliverance in here - city types lost amid the wilderness - and a little bit of Alien - a group of people picked off one by one by a largely unseen monstrous entity, but The Descent never gets anywhere near the emotional impact of either of those two films. After watching Alien for an hour I felt like I knew the crew of the Nostromo; sadly, after watching this particular film I couldn't even SEE who was down in the cave, much less care about whether they lived or not.Going by the other reviews on IMDb it seems Neil Marshall has his fair share of fans. Good luck to him, but on this evidence I simply can't see what the fuss is about. Perhaps next time someone should switch the lights on.",4,2,7,23 August 2010
Pulp Fiction," Are we supposed to be laughing?
","If Pulp Fiction were meant to be a comedy I'd be tempted to give it 7/10 for sheer effort. It's got John Travolta in a wig (check out that ponytail!) Uma Thurman pretending to be a dancer, and Mr Quentin Tarantino himself in yet another cameo trying to prove he can act, and proving beyond all doubt that he can't.Amid the farce and supposedly knowing humour of this film there is one shining light. The performance of Samuel L Jackson as a hit-man stands out as one of the performances of the 1990s. It's a shame the director got his hit men mixed up and put Travolta at the heart of this film; with Jackson front and centre this could have been a first-rate crime drama, with the added intrigue of a man atoning for some truly wicked sins.Travolta is miscast as Vincent. He plays a hit-man who talks about hamburgers on the way to murdering his victims. Not because this is what hit men do, but because Tarantino is so desperate to be seen as cool his hit men simply MUST do something different.It gets worse. Vincent is assigned to look after his boss's wife and duly ends up on the dance floor. Quite why this is supposed to be so iconic I have absolutely no idea. John Travolta moves like a bored polar bear at times, and Uma Thurman may as well be on heavy medication for all the good she is. Rarely do you have sympathy for Hollywood superstars, but watching these two I did wonder whether the pair of them might consider early retirement. If nothing else, I guess this scene offers a cautionary warning to anyone fond of a hamburger; eat too many of 'em and you too could end up like John Travolta.Throw in Bruce Willis as a disillusioned boxer, Harvey Keitel as Wolf, Tim Roth and Amanda Plummer as a pair of hold-up artists, and, well, you've got a film not a million miles away from a Robert Altman picture of the Seventies. Or indeed a John Cassavetes film.This is my problem with Tarantino; you watch his films and wonder if you've seen it somewhere before. Reservoir Dogs was a deserved success - critically, at least - but with Pulp Fiction we've been here before many times.Its rating on this website suggests it is up there with The Godfather, and that, frankly, is the biggest laugh of the lot. Come to think of it, maybe I was right all along; maybe it IS a comedy after all.",5,8,15,29 April 2010
Scream," Great opening . . . then I fell asleep
","Amazing. I honestly don't know how Wes Craven does it. He takes another genuinely interesting premise and absolutely slaughters it on screen - and I'm not referring to the body count here.The opening ten minutes are admittedly great. Drew Barrymore reaching for the phone, only to find herself in conversation with a stalker is inspired. What a pity then about the rest of the film.Back in the mists of time when horror movies used to scare people - The Texas Chainsaw Massacre, The Omen, Psycho - Scream would probably have passed without notice. But since The Evil Dead, it seems you don't have to scare people anymore, you simply have to amuse them.Quite honestly, I don't care about Jason's mum, nor about Jason, nor about who was hiding behind the curtain with a machete in their hand and wearing a stocking over their head halfway through Prom Night III.The genre of horror lost its teeth some time ago. Just occasionally a modern day classic will rear its head. If you want to see real true horror, watch Wolf Creek from about 2005.For those of a less demanding taste watch this drivel, masquerading as a horror film and stuffed full of characters straight out of any number of American sitcoms. Which brings me back to my earlier point: how does Wes Craven manage to slaughter so many genuinely good ideas?I recently saw his New Nightmare aka Nightmare On Elm Street Part 7, and it was virtually identical to Scream. The same sets, the same characters, the same supposed shocks you can see coming from a mile off. The only difference of course was in place of the tiresome Freddy, we have some tiresome bloke in a mask waving a fake knife.Fake just about sums it up.",3,6,18,20 April 2010
