Borat: Cultural Learnings of America for Make Benefit Glorious Nation of Kazakhstan," Absolutely Histarical
","I saw this movie at the sneak peek showing at the University of Michigan. My friends were absolutely astonished that, while seeing and loving the preview, I had never seen Da Ali G show. They prepped me a little bit, but I was incredibly surprised and amused with what I saw. We were all jammed into one of the auditoria and the film projector started to the vast applause of all the students. The plot line reminded me a lot of Seth MacFarlane's writing style, with randomness and plenty of goofy antics that were staples in Da Ali G show (or the few episodes that I saw of it). Having known quite a few Eastern European immigrants and gauging their reactions in the theater was quite funny; interspersed with all of Cohen's antics and comedy, I was laughing so much that it hurt; I honestly did not stop laughing throughout the whole movie from start to finish. I would definitely see this movie again when it comes out.",10,5,17,22 October 2006

","All I can say about this movie is that it is great, splendid, magnificent, (insert superlative adjective of your choice here). Though there were a few minor discrepancies from the account found in Herodotus' Histories, this account was extremely vivid and graphic. A word of warning to the squeamish, if you hate blood, guts, violent death scenes, this movie is definitely intimidating, despite the excellent plot lines, ever-so-many superb one-liners, a tremendously powerful conclusion and resolution, and raw emotions that the characters and actors convey oh-so-well. My hat's off to the exquisite writing, cinematography, computer graphics, and acting.",10,4,13,6 March 2007
