The Blair Witch Project," Artistically Interesting, otherwise blah
","After seeing a couple of glowing reviews of the movie, my wife and myself, and a close friend of ours were looking forward to seeing this movie.My wife hated it, my friend fell asleep during it, and while I found it artistically interesting, nothing in it particulary scared me.I do not as a rule watch thrillers or horror films, but this one sounded interesting, and I was looking forward to a good scare without the blood gore and violence associated with most of todays horror/thriller's.Maybe I read too much into the reviews.  Maybe I  built the movie up in my mind to something it wasn't.  Nevertheless, I really was disappointed and don't understand all the hype about this movie. If not for concept it would be otherwise totally boring and dull.",4,0,1,9 August 1999
