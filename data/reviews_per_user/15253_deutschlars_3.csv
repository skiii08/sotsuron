Abraham Lincoln: Vampire Hunter," Boring and looks like it has been shot on an iPhone 3
","This movies has a number of shortcomings, I would like to focus on one. The look.There are movies that benefit from a digital look and then there are movies that were shot on digital and look OK. This movie does not fall in either category. It looks really bad. So much so that I was constantly aware of technical aspects of filmmaking. Luckily there is neither much story nor excitement that I could have missed. It seems we are trapped in a close up of Mexican soap opera for most of the movie. Somebody must have thought that 'iMovie preset color-grading' would help the film. Most of the film is so sepia or so blue that there is not much other color left. What really puzzles me is how this movie changes between 'super sepia' and 'super blue' in the same room at the same time for no dramatic reason. For many years 'Hollywood movie' was a guarantee for a great looking cinematic experience. Regardless of problems with story or script there was a look that made up for other shortcomings. Battleship (2012) is far from a great movie, but it is an example how great a modern Hollywood movie can look. Unfortunately Abraham Lincoln Vampire Hunter is a low point of the cheap digital TV aesthetic. I hope this look does not become acceptable as this has nothing to do with a cinematic experience.To sum it up: A movie called Abraham Lincoln Vampire Hunter that is neither fun, ironic, cool nor looks good is a wasted opportunity.",3,3,7,24 June 2012
Prometheus," Ridley Scott celebrates himself in this pointless movie
","This is a terrible self indulgent pointless 'origin story'. If you haven't seen it, just ask someone who had to mate with what to create the original alien... Sure there is a lot of great stuff visually and the 3D is excellent. Unfortunately the rest is very poor. Be it the re-cycled robot who is all to human, a space ship that is started by playing the flute or the fact that all of the scientist exclusively make bad decisions. The actions of all the characters are not very credible and the driving chaos force of the easily insulted robot is just the cheapest plot device. Which is bad, as the overall plot is pretty much the thinnest possible premise / excuse for an origin story. If you will a lame two hour prelude to ridiculously lame origin 'punch line'. The whole film feels forced and stiff. Very staged and wooden, there is no flow, no chemistry, no character to connect to. Without Ridley Scotts name on it would probably have much worse reviews. I cannot remember seeing a movie where I cared less about the outcome this year.",5,5,11,11 June 2012
Madagascar 3: Europe's Most Wanted," Beautiful animation, amazing 3D and full of energy
","This is by far my favorite film of the Madagascar series.It is insanely fast and very energetic. Very often movies have a great opening scene and then they settle into a slower pace or opt for a more grounded feel. In this movie every scene is snappy, every character is over the top, everything is always theatrical and it is fun beginning to end. It is clever and it clearly makes a decision not to be heavy, not even for a moment. There is no moralizing and it totally disregards (even animation) 'reality' for more fun, more stunning animation or more stunning 3D. It has a great tone and the lemur / bear on tricycle love story is just one of many great little extras that make you smile from beginning to end of this movie.",8,0,1,10 June 2012
