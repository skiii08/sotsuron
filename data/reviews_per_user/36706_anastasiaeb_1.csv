Abraham Lincoln: Vampire Hunter," So disappointing...
","If you've read the book, you'll be completely disappointed with this movie. I've read articles about the movie (after reading the book) and knew they were adding characters, but I had no idea they would change EVERYTHING. I understand shortening the story to fit into a movie, but more than that has been done and now the movie is just stupid! I can't even say there's more action in the movie than the book, EVERY action scene had the super-fast-with-the-hands/weapons-dance-but-slow-down- just-when-a-blow-connects/misses; and the 'bass drop' or BRAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAÂ­AAAAWM sound (like Inception) during all the action scenes didn't help. Oh yeah, the excessive CGI and most of the acting sucked. It was like some of the actors just walked in front of the camera and said the lines like they really didn't want to be there. When I first heard about this movie I thought it was the dumbest thing ever, but then I read the book thoroughly enjoyed it and became excited about the movie...only to be let down and forced to stick with my initial thought. If someone else hadn't paid for the tickets I would've walked out and demanded a refund, even the person who took me thought it sucked and he never read the book but was also excited about the movie. Save your money and wait until it comes out on cable.",1,41,83,26 June 2012
