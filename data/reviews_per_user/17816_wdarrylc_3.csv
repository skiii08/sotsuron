Marie Antoinette," Big Budget Boring Beyond Belief
","1st off let me state, until this film I had not seen anything that Kirsten Dunst has been in that I did not at least leave the theater having enjoyed most of the film. Her movies are for the most part at the very least enjoyable....while the costumes were great, and Kirsten Dunst was interesting in the title lead, the movie never took off, after a very boring and uninteresting first 45 minutes. I spent the majority of the rest of movie wondering if the screen editor would ever work again after the poor editing job I counted at least 50 drops of the sound mike into view during the course of the film. I expected a lot more from director Sofia Coppola and I hope that that this film is given a quick trip to the better forgotten vault and locked away forever and both Sofia Coppola and Kirsten Dunst put this turkey way way behind them.",1,1,4,24 December 2006
The Assassination of Jesse James by the Coward Robert Ford," Guess I'm to Old to Enjoy Great Cinema.
","First off with Positive I really enjoyed Brad Pitts in the roll as Jesse James I found it effortless, dark and brooding. I would not be surprise with an Oscar nod for Mr. Pitt. I cannot say the same for Casey Affleck as Bob Ford I found him whinny, irritating and almost un-watchable. The supporting cast was good and for the most part I thought well cast in their rolls I especially liked Jeremy Renner and Paul Schneider. I must give hats off to Garret Dillahunt I honestly felt he was terrified in a later scene with Brad Pitt his fear looked genuine. However the Movie seemed to just carry on for too long and minor details that did not need a depth to them, were carried on for just to long. Trimming this movie to a respectable 100 minutes might do wonders. It's still a movie worth a look just not at today's ticket prices. My rating is a 2 worth a look but wait until its trimmed for network TV.",2,14,46,30 September 2007
Tenacious D in the Pick of Destiny," Simply AWFUL!!!
","This film is classic example of a star (Jack Black) thinking that what ever he does the fans will embrace. I like Jack Black, he was great in the Jackal, the first time I notice him. He was great in Shallow Hale and very entertaining in King Kong. He has made some other films that I personally did not like as much, but were still good movies. That brings me to this film, what was he thinking the Movie is a disaster from start to finish. The plot is really non-existent, the singing is terrible, the characters are undeveloped, the dialog what there is of it is right out of a bad nightmare, I'm sure there are people out there who consider the F word great dialog. I don't have a problem with the word but is it really good writing when it is used in every sentence at least once and some times multiple times.My rating for this movie is a zero; it's not even worth watching as a time filler until something else comes on",1,1,15,11 May 2008
