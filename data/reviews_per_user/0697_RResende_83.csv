The King's Speech," the voice against the wall
","This is more or less what i was expecting, for good and for bad, and that's now actually a very good complement. When i go to a movie, i always go with an open mind, expecting to be surprised.This is a film for and about actors from root to leaves. The main plot is about an unimportant man who has to learn how to act, in order to be convincing in front of an audience, and in order to disguise his stammerer condition. The device they use to show this is a common thing in drama: the personal quest of one man to overcome his handicap is mapped onto the collective aspirations of a group, in this case a nation on the verge of a war. So, by focusing on the personal drama of a number of people; the future king, his stammering brother, his wife, the voice coach; while being given a glimpse of what's going on in the world, the imminent conflict between uk and Germany, we are given the sensation that what will happen to the world depends on whether the king will be able to talk clearly to his people or not. It's an usual device, normally used in epics or war films. In this case i don't think that the 'speech' is a strong enough alibi to make credible the whole story, but still i suppose it is OK as a dramatic device. Within that drama, the main point is the relation between the voice coach and the king. So, here it is a film about a friendship, a whole different genre on its own, that we've seen many times before. This gets interesting here, because the actors are apt, and the script helps. Colin Firth does fine, he has become a good actor, he knows how to merge into the fabric of the film and be a part of it. But Geoffrey Rush is something to watch, no matter what he does. He is a very fine actor, and his multiple layers of acting here are really interesting to watch: he acts an incredibly good voice coach, who hides his other side of a frustrated actor, constantly being rejected in theatre castings. He is able to correct the others' speeches, but not to deliver the lines convincingly enough. He transports his undelivered performance to the king, and projects his frustration as an actor unable to convince an audience to the success of the king as he convincingly incites his nation into resistance. Radio is the chosen medium, and it is perfect for this plot because its magic resides uniquely on the words, and how they're delivered.Oh and there is an element that comes from There is one very interesting set, worth mentioning: Rush's office. The environment is fine, the old furniture, gadgets of those days, the turntable, the mic, etc. But what is really well picked is the texture of the wall behind the patient's couch. All those multi colored dots, placed on the background of a face fighting to overcome his difficulty. The wall has great visual power, and supports the drama well enough. I enjoyed it.My opinion: 3/5http://www.7eyes.wordpress.com",Null,0,1,24 February 2011
Blade Runner 2049," Maybe Kafka also dreamed of electric flowers
","The possibilities were great: here we have a film about memories which, like all memories, no one knows just how 'real' or 'constructed' they are. At the same time, the film is a sequel (more of an emotional remake in my opinion) of another film which had to do with constructed ambiguities and is by now itself a well established cinematic memory for so many serious film goers. That first film loosely adapted a story by a writer who was himself a master of ambiguous realities, that interplay, overlap, insinuate. It was fascinating just to think about that: a new film that's like a transparent sheet of paper that loosely follows the previous layers, just like the fantastic love- making between K., his virtual girlfriend, and the prostitute she hires to 'make it real'. That's one of the scenes i'll take with me.I thought they had it for the first half of the film: this LA is the same of 2019, but it evolved, Wallace's headquarters follow Tyrell's. The music uses the same colours of Vangelis' pallet to create a different but somehow recognizable painting (until the end when we actually get to hear the original melody). All throughout the film there are hints at the old one: 2 pianos (one of which hides something important), graphic references, etc. Kind of a visual deja-vu, where you recognize things without necessarily knowing where from. That's ambiguous, that's fine.But here's a challenge and a trap with working with a source material that is grounded on ambiguities: there is a very thin narrative depth of field which you must use in order to keep the ambiguities, while not alienating the viewer from the storytelling. Very little must be in focus, and the out-of-focus parts must be seductive on their own, tease you into the thing. Such a film can't be made by either a preacher (someone who wants to teach you something) nor a puzzle maker (someone who won't be satisfied until all pieces fit together). Unfortunately i think Villeneuve belongs to the second group. The man has real visual talent, but he always tries to do 2 things at the same time which are to my view contradictory. He builds images, some very strong (and with Deakins helping they really are something...) and let you be driven by them, the way Tarkovsky would (albeit much less inspired). When you are already into the thing, meditating, absorbing, he screws the mood, and tries to impose some story on you. So after he introduces you to the universe of the film, teases you, seduces you, in a couple of masterful ways, he cuts your mood and focus on the story facts, thus killing the third act. **SPOILERS** The ending of the film is the perfect example: Deckard meets his daughter and kind of redeems a life of longing and absence, Joe K. dies (?) outside and we suffer with it. Who wants to know? I dreamed my whole life in films about what was made of Deckard and Rachel. Why won't they let me do the same here? Why close everything so perfectly? Why make perfect sense, perfect puzzle? And why did they have to bring a 3D version of Rachel, and shoot her in the head 2 minutes later? We had it! The voice clips that we hear through out, the mere mention of her name, what else was needed? Why would they bring her? Just to show off their 3D rendering powers? Shameless, the anti-origami... The other lame moment is Olmo's cameo, where his origami (a horse or a sheep?) is there for the sake of itself, as a wink to the past, with not consequences to the future.In the middle of it, they loose the chance to develop one of the most interesting characters i've seen sketched in cinema: the girl, physically and emotionally isolated from the world, whose job is to create memories. Kind of a goddess, whose masterpiece is a memory that is real... but of course who knows what memories are real and what aren't? How could they come up with such a character and not explore the possibilities? Was she deliberately creating the whole film? manipulating the whole cosmology with her gadget? And if so, why do they mess this up by having Wallace drop a hint at Deckard that he was somehow designed to fall in love with Rachel? That's just fireworks, distractions, show-off like much of what Leto does as an actor.But this Horse is no Unicorn, Wood is not Paper. Both unicorn and paper are human constructs, dreams that derive from horses and wood. The bad, unforgivable thing about this film is not in how something doesn't make sense, but in how everything, in the end, makes perfect sense.The title of the comment is a reference to Coleridge and his dream.",Null,4,10,8 October 2017
Angels & Demons," hercule
","I don't expect much of a Ron Howard film. His films are bloodless and unappealing to me, despite the effects that are applied. His cinematic ideas are as basic and uninteresting as those annoying camera effects we have in his Dan Brown based films - cameras that move through walls as if to show us the 'hidden truth' behind what's apparent. Dull. The biggest disaster was the 'daVinci Code', because that was made when the book was incredibly consensual throughout the world, consensual even in its supposed revolutionary revelations. The film was so poor it couldn't even serve as a proper illustration for the book like, say, the Harry Potter films do with the books.This one was a predictable failure. If they weren't able to break any rules of the genre with the first one that was already loved by the public before it was even shot, this wouldn't be where they'd make it. This had to maintain the viewers that kept following Langdon even after the cinematic code disaster. So this film uses the skeleton of the first one, and places different flesh over it. Now it's not about the grail, or the blood of Christ, instead it's about some political plot inside the Vatican. The Code was a far more interesting story, as far as the book goes, but both stories are uncinematic to me, because they only tease when you get into the details that Brown cleverly chooses to use to build his intended narrative. What he presents are narratives, versions, stories that might be true. This is done by the association of facts, not through images. That's suited for a book, not so much for a film.The only significant switch here is that, more than in the Code, Langdon is more of a detective here than a researcher. In the Code, the fun was for you to understand the narrative that was being told to you, in the historical plan, by joining the puzzle pieces that were being thrown at you. Here it was about getting the 'insider', finding who was manipulating things. Underneath the historical heavy display of facts there is a simple detective story, in the Agatha Christie tradition. And underneath that tradition is a whole heritage that American noir left us to enjoy and explore. If Ron Howard and the other people involved had got this, they might have made a decent film. This way, they didn't.My opinion: 1/5http://www.7eyes.wordpress.com",Null,0,0,9 January 2011
Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," Darth Lucas
","I must say i was much more satisfied with this now than when i first saw it, at the time of its release. That's probably because i was then still enough naive to believe there could be something as thrilling as the original films that coloured part of my childhood dreams. Also because the gap between the old ones and this i was seeing was so huge that the disappointment wouldn't allow me to put this in its place.About Star Wars: it's impossible for me to look at the old films as coldly as i would look at a film without that charge of nostalgia. Thinking about it, i think this is a complement to the old series. Looking back, seeing this and thinking about the old features, i think George Lucas is not a good director, he is quite ordinary and he understood that when he chose not to direct episodes 5 and 6. He doesn't have any special angle, he does everything like anyone else would do; he watched the masters but couldn't extract what they were really aiming that. But he is a great storyteller, and was absolutely masterful in the way he created this franchising.He created a new cosmology and fed the dry minds of a mythless society with stories that placed superior forces (Force) beyond the control of ordinary beings, something that 'surrounds' them (here he killed the mystique with the useless midclorian explanation). The way audiences evolved to appreciate such stories based on supernatural and the idea of finding forces and events that exceed us proved Lucas right, and at the same time underline the role the original Star Wars had in molding pop thinking for the last 30 years. Indiana Jones, Lord of the Rings (refished for cinema), Harry Potter, and a number of equivalent series. People have a tendency to look for religion, and wanting to rely on it. That's what positive 'cause effect' thinking wouldn't consider, and the extreme marxist societies would help hide. To me that's the key to the success of all this.A decade ago Lucas felt it was the time to come back. He had a lot of story blanks to fill, a lot of promises from the old movies, a whole galaxy of untold events. That's rich, he created the universe, and he wanted to explore it. But the problem is, he wasn't competent to do that. Here he doesn't have the angle and the innovation quality he ha in 1977, when his effects were breathtaking, they would still amaze me when i first saw the films, in the late 80'. Here the special effects are just of medium quality in the middle of what's been done lately (to which his exploration post Star Wars contributed a lot). So, because we don't have that innovative side, and the story is already known (who knows the old films knows what to expect from this one), the magic is partially gone, and the flaws of Lucas-director show up, vivid as never. Of course there are the hard-core fans who won't abandon the boat and will blindly vote negative on this comment because it 'insults' their beliefs, but even those penalized these new films (6.4 rating in IMDb as i write).It's a beautiful story, that of Star Wars, but Lucas, either burnt out and with no new approaches to use, or influenced by money fetchers around him (or both previous), messed up with this. It's as if Lucas had become Anakin: he was a curious intelligent brilliant little boy, protected by the Force and who was supposed to bring peace and prosperity to the Republic, but in the end turned to the dark side.My opinion: 3/5 http://www.7eyes.wordpress.com",Null,2,5,27 October 2008
3:10 to Yuma," (not) subverting, and a pair
","What an interesting and effective film.This is a remake of a western originally made before Leone laughed with at the western genre. But this film is made in 2007, 43 years after that injection of irony and subversion of the genre took place. This film takes itself seriously, or at least, picks the key elements of the genre before Leone twisted them, and assumes them in the Ford vision. I think that's a dangerous approach, because the audiences, in the meanwhile, updated their old conceptions to what Leone proposed (to me, born in the 80', 'classic' are the Leone films, the others are 'old'). But the overcome is successful.So, we have extreme characters populating the whole thing. Crowe is ambiguous, so intelligently mean that we like him, so he grows on us as Bale's character grows on him. The men are in the game for clear reasons. Bale for self transcendence (to grow on his sun), Crowes uses a mask of meanness as a revenge for child rejection (the Bible as an expiatory element), Bale's son as a form of self-imposition. Reaching one's goals as a cross through the desert. Honour is a key element, dying for it is worthy and admirable. That's something Leone mocked at. But than, we have visual sequences which owe more to Leone than to anything before him, and more to recent action films than to old Ford or Hawks' westerns gunfight. So, this is a miscellaneous, a real product of this time, when genres are all subverted, and even trying to make a genre film totally in the line of old notions is a subversion in itself.Why this one is so watchable, and effective, is for Bale/Crowe. They both are intelligent actors, Bale more flexible and someone who adapts to what it takes, Crowe a more internal, meditative and imposing figure. So, they are as actors the mirrors of what they're characters are. And that's something really well done. The narrative arcs are classic, but so well built...My opinion: 4/5 http://www.7eyes.wordpress.com",Null,0,0,19 December 2008
The Hangover," puzzle
","Comedy is a hard genre. It's really hard to find talented comedy actors that make us laugh without feeling empty in doing it. I'm not talking about the easy laugh of an arranged false situation where you just laugh at the awkwardness of the scene. True comedy is closer to true drama than to anything else. That's what i think. But once in a while, one can find a decent comedy, that succeeds in the performances. More rare is to watch something that does something interesting on the narrative level. This is the case.The performances are standard routine in what concerns today's physical acting and word timing. This is the part of the thing that usually gets outdated so soon, so i suspect that in 15 years we'll no longer laugh at the phrasing, timing, or even most of the written jokes. Zach Galifianakis is the exception. He acts really funny because he's the only character who doesn't act to be funny. He doesn't force his comic act into the audiences. He stands outside the comic forces of the film, quite literally, as his character is an alien forced upon the well acquainted group. So he just stands there, and there resides the fun of his performance.The nice thing here is done on the narrative structure of the thing. The story is about a group of guys who don't remember what happened the night before (drugs, booze, etc.). They are given clues (the baby, the tiger, the police car) which are the links to those unremembered events. Following those leads, in a sort of a twisted detective story mechanics, they will be able to retell the events they don't remember. So, the narrative structure is that these characters will reveal a story that has already happened, to Them! This is a fun concept, and a clever device. And it is really rare to find clever structures applied to mainstream comedy.Well the unveiling of the missing puzzle pieces of their night is not as great as it might have been. The Mike Tyson episode is forced upon the narrative, probably there to include Tyson and sell some more tickets with his presence, but it just feels out of place, a scene from another movie. But overall, this is OK.My opinion: 3/5http://www.7eyes.wordpress.com",Null,0,2,17 February 2011
Minority Report," noisy Kubrick
","I always appreciate Spielberg's efforts to make real films, those that go beyond the simple entertainment that permeates his career. He gave us and still gives, from time to time, joyful moments. He is anchored in stories, and he has a visual shape to his own world, and that's something not that common in the work of directors who so often aim at massive diffusion. But he also wants to make good work, and indeed he knows what molds the great films. He knows it as a spectator, and he understands it as a filmmaker. But in this field, he is an incomplete creator, because he is never able that film selling mundane golden rule of giving the public what the public wants.Here he tackles Kubrick. He had done it the year before with the disastrous Artificial Intelligence, which was a project Kubrick himself was apparently cherishing at the time of his death. Spielberg couldn't handle it, and made one of his worst films, which is not at least watchable. He tries to make it up here, and he partially does it. He chooses Cruise, who had been in Kubrick's final effort. Cruise is relatively weak, or at least not suited for adventurous flights, he is straightforward and what he does as an actor doesn't reflect any kind of understanding of the rules of the game he is supposed to be playing. Kubrick didn't took him, he took a couple who was it already for the publics eyes. Besides, Tom's character there is supposed to be clueless. Well, here as well, but he is allowed to take the lead of the narrative. That is one of the flaws in this film: to allow Cruise to be the action figure everyone expects him to be blurs the emphasis the images and how they build realities should have. Also, the useless branches in the narrative main course deviate from the interesting potential this film had. Why do we need the revival of the romance between Anderton and his former wife? Or underlining so much the sorrow for his past losses? Well, because that reduces the risk that the audience would be put away by the film, and the producers wouldn't want that, and Spielberg wouldn't say no. Moralizing about how apparently perfect and fair systems are usually corrupted and their highest hierarchies is a minor flaw.But there are very good things in this film, and Spielberg is as well to be granted its strong points. He picks a Phil Dick story, which means he will work with memories, possible worlds, provisional realities. Dick's stuff is highly cinematic in its roots, because it is usually visual (literally here) and explores narrative: stories about storytelling. Also, that is the stuff that permeates some of Kubrick's most deep works. So that is table were Spielberg lays his skills, and he knows that. And he builds the skeleton well enough. We have a cop whose work is to interpret images. Those images are provided by three beings with a divine aura (the ability to provide us with images is sacrate!). The cop concludes the reality of the film through the images within the film. Because the validity of those images is unquestioned in the world of the film, the power to bend those images is limitless. So the story is a quest for being able to distinguish between truth and lies, but, and that is the real trick, truth and lies told by the images. Some bits are precious, like how the images that foresee Anderton as a murderer match the real events, or the footage of the drowned lady. But we don't watch these images long enough, and the images themselves are not powerful enough most of the times, and the outcome of everything is done in the fields of common, now outdated action films, not in the films of the images, like it would (and was) perfectly done by Kubrick, Antonioni, Wenders or de Palma.If i hit hard on Spielberg is because i treasure his imagination and his ambitions. I wish he'll do really well some day.My opinion: 3/5http://www.7eyes.wordpress.com",Null,1,1,3 May 2009
In Bruges," Bosch, midgets
","About 2 years ago, i watched and commented on a belgian film, called Moscow, Belgium (Aanrijding in Moscou). It came to me out of the blue, at a film festival, and it pleased me so much in how different it was as a film experience. Somehow, it was a film detached from conventions, relatively away from the genre rules of that type of film, at least Hollywood rules. But it had the appeal of the audiences, and had it been spoken in English or Spanish, and it certainly might have had a different impact. Unpretentiousness was how i named my comment. No i watch this film, and it produces a similar effect. And it takes place in Belgium as well. And because this one is spoken in English, and has well known faces, it falls in the sweet spot that i thought Moscow might have fit in. I wonder if Belgium, as a place, has anything to do with that.Now this is quite a different film. It has a very tight strong writing, as controlled as the environment where the whole film takes place. It all takes place within that environment, and the first really interesting thing is how, with one (important) exception, all the important plot points that happen along the story are mapped into the places of the city that we'd been introduced early, when the hit men were simply sightseeing. The tower, the hotel, the film set. We get to the city with the characters, and we see it through their eyes. The fundamental plot point that is told to us through flashbacks is what allows for the story to derive into the other world of the noir genre where the film ends. The killing of the child is what we learn. What that fact does is to trigger all the events that make the characters meet what they are supposed to meet. So, the great thing here is how the film derives from genre to genre. From the laws of comedy (f***ing Brugges) to the point of hard men hunt. The dramatic shift is subtle and really rare to watch, and it magnifies the power of the ending.The crucial element that allows this is, of course, the film within, the film being shot in Brugges. It intersects the narrative several times throughout the film, and we even have actors from that film (the midget) interacting with our main actors. The midget aspect is very talked about. We pass through the set, Farrell even meets the girl on it, and we are told the film has something to do with Bosch. And of course, at the end, the larger film, the one we're watching moves literally to the set of the inner film, at the time when we no longer live in the comedy world, and the two remaining characters meet their fate in a totally different dramatic world, on the set of the inner film, taking the midget with them.This is remarkable writing which, nevertheless, is only allowed by a solid direction which allows the actors to freely express, under a controlled environment.My opinion: 4/5",Null,0,3,26 January 2011
Kung Fu Panda," it's all in the faces
","The latest years have been busy and interesting in the field of animation. The full transition to digital creation (at least in a main stream context) is a reality, and in the middle of it, the competition between Dreamworks and Pixar/Disney is bringing benefits to us, viewers, all. So far, i've been enjoying Pixar's projects better. They are working in their specific corner of film exploration, which has to do with the use of space. The kind of freedom a virtual camera gives to animation is something they've been working properly, at a world class level in Ratatouille. That's the top of it, so far, to my taste. But here, these guys embrace a research on something that had been somehow neglected until now: the faces.The camera is virtual, the sets are virtual, but so are the actors (except of course for the voices). So they can be worked in a sort of exaggerated more than real way. That's done here. So far it's the best digital faces characterization i've seen. Every expression is intended, has a purpose, and is fully enjoyable. Certain subtleties are really intelligent, because in the middle of a great technological capacity, they used quite simple devices (it comes to my mind that eye movement in the monkeys face when the panda is making fun of the master without knowing he is behind him).The motion in space and throughout the space was not specially interesting, specially if you look at what Pixar has been doing. And this story had potential in that field. Kung Fu, in cinematic terms, is about a dance between the eye and the performer, and the way he fills the space he's occupying. Here we have a temple in the top of a mountain, with a village at its feet. The only thing they use is the stairs, so the panda can get tired. Could be more. But the faces make up for all this My opinion: 4/5 http://www.7eyes.wordpress.com",Null,2,3,11 July 2008
Gravity," the infinity of the womb
","I've been absent. Not only from writing about films, but from watching them with the frequency of past days as well. Part of it was life-driven, as i don't have the time i used to have. Part of it is because from time to time i feel the need to step a little back from whatever i'm doing more intensely and reevaluate things. Passions are better enhanced through fasting. I've had 6 or 7 very intense years where my life mixed a great deal with the lives of the films i've watched. That's the beauty of films, when you approach the films that change you by allowing then to become a part of your life, by blending them into you - as if you had a choice... Cuarón had changed me before, he's so intense because his narrative is always in the eye. His films are bits intimacies that arise from the magic of the relation between character, space, and camera. That's the basis of his dramatic construction, that's where the story lies. That's what allows him to spin and make beautiful free yet coordinated movements, like a planet circling the sun. Children of men changed me because of that. When i heard that Cuarón decided to go to space and enhance even more that special relation between space and camera, i knew he was going for something even bigger. He changes me now, once againNothing is more powerful, and as such more difficult to bend as space. It's infinite in its possibilities (like desert), it is totally spatial and it is the opposite of architecture, which is also all about space. Children of men mastered the built space, as this one masters the infinite. Intimacy of a space capsule as opposed to the possibilities of gravity zero. The camera as the ultimate non-animated disembodied character, as chaotic as space itself, yet as emotional as any of the 2 characters in the film. Cuarón ranks at the highest point, together with Kalatozov, in that so dear (to me) theme of space manipulation and film.Both actors do what was expected. Clooney plays Clooney's character, and becomes a useful wheel in the mechanism, allowing with his persona to make the audiences enter easily this otherwise strange unexplored film frame. Sandra tries hard, as she always does, perhaps harder than she should, and also as always, she seats uneasily in the role, but again that works in favor of the narrative, as her character also does not belong to the world where she moves. Than comes the magic. And world, from the moment it starts to shake, is always a sequence of total stillness followed by spatial chaos. Meteo rain vs the silence inside a capsule, breaking cranes (again the cranes are flying...) vs the sight of Earth framed by a window. We get the most powerful womb representation that i can think of in my whole life in films, and the metaphor of poles, of touching extremes is complete, as the intimacy of the uterus kisses the intimacy of the infinite, where Clooney is allowed to sing while he sees the sunset, or rise.This is the second film in 2 years that: -really changed me; -was compared by a great deal of people to 2001; -which i find has nothing to do with it. Is it the fact that he films planets and black space? That the actors are dressed as astronauts? That we have scenes in zero gravity? The other film was Malick's Tree of Life.This is the best 3D i've seen. Nowhere else have i seen such a meaningful use of the possibilities.My opinion: 5/5",Null,2,4,30 November 2013
Erin Brockovich," chemical cinema
","I think that what made the success of this film was a combination of two elements:-an engaging story (at least for the 'masses'), one where an 'underdog' defeats higher powers, out of dedication, lots of courage, lots of humanity, and ignoring threats and personal private life to achieve them. Oh, and that story is real; -the fact that some 'stars' of the system of stars were in this, and one of them (Roberts) took it as a personal project, something she specifically chose to do;Starting with these two premises, anything could be done and the film would sell. In this ride, we have Soderbergh, who is a great director. But he doesn't show. The directing is mechanical. In fact every aspect of the film is mechanical, lighting, editing, narrative dynamics. Last week i went to see his new, personal, and very good 'Che'. Maybe that was partially paid for or supported by money raised here. If that's true, this film was worth it. Julia Roberts is OK here, but the part is born, cut, and tailored to her. Her range is small and here she is at the perfect center of it. I think it's intelligent of her to choose what she can do.The bottom line is that this is a film about lives that transcend the ordinary curse, and make interesting things, but itself is one in a million. It's ordinary, it goes with the flow, and it will be forgotten. In fact it is practically now, despite the awards and the success in its moment.My opinion: 2/5 http://www.7eyes.wordpress.com",Null,1,2,21 October 2008
Inglourious Basterds," It works, but NOT in the eye
","I gave this film a much greater amount of reflexion than i usually give to any film before commenting on it. Some of the things in it are puzzling, not so much because of the film itself, but to the way people react to it.This film has qualities, to me Tarantino deserves some credit for some good things, but there are fundamental issues that are important to me and certainly other film goers. The thing is, film is rooted in images, there was a time, if you'll dig 8 decades, in which image was the only thing filmmakers could rely on, in order to give us a story. That's pure visual story telling, that's what Chaplin and Keaton did, Meliés, the incredible Pabst, which Tarantino talks about in this film. This means that the images, either for the way they were sequenced, either for the way they were shown, told us something. Maybe we could sum it up in a few words to anyone who hadn't seen the film, but that wouldn't mean anything, because 'Seeing' was what it was all about. Remember 'City Lights'' last sequence? The tramp, beaten up, defeated, is mocked at by some street kids, the ex-blind flower girl, now with vision (thanks to the Tramp), sees the scene, laughs at it but than takes pity on the poor tramp. She gives him a flower and a quarter, only to find out, through the tact of his hand which she recognized, that he was the man who helped her while she was blind. They look at each other, we cry. These words mean absolutely nothing if you haven't seen the film, because the images ARE the film. Now, Tarantino knows this, that's the thing, he knows how to Watch films, he claims as his references some of the filmmakers i care more about. Most of them are pure visual storytellers: Leone, Pabst, Hitchcock, Kar Wai. Tarantino knows this, and it must hurt him deeply that he can't do their thing. He can be (i believe) deeply moved by the preciousness of the Bye bye Babs shot, or the initial ever lasting 15 minutes of Once upon a time in West, which Quentin quotes in the first sequence of this film. But he can't do anything that is remotely as visual (or visual at all) like these scenes. There is a number of tools and bricks that build a sequence, build a film, which Tarantino simply doesn't master. Framing, timing, editing. On the pure visual field, Tarantino simply shoots, and has a special talent to adequate songs to his scenes. Now i wouldn't give that so much attention, if Tarantino would be considered for what he is, a clever dialog writer, with some clever narrative ideas, but basically an ordinary director. It seems dangerous that the collective consciousness takes Tarantino as the big thins, the follower to his masters. He does Do what the masters did, so he Talks about it, and Talks us into believing he is doing the masters' thing.It took me a few weeks to get to this point. I had to turn to Tarkovsky and Kalatozov so they would confirm me i was thinking right. They did.Having said this, i think this film is the strongest Tarantino has made since Pulp Fiction, because he dedicates a lot of time to the 2 things he does best: building tense dialogs, and finding a narrative structure that fits. In Pulp Fiction he borrowed that from Kar Wai, here he sticks to the episodic chapters. The dialogs are great, they build tension and little times have i seen such cleverness in how different languages are alternated. Tarantino collects from his previous experiences in using chit chat to advance a scene, and does it well. So notice that in the first scene it is not what you see that makes the scene, it's what it's said. In my book, that is good writing, not good film-making, and it is precisely the opposite of the assumed reference, Sergio Leone. The same applies to the shooting scene in the bar. It's the dialog that leads us to the final short shooting. And that's my point.There is a very interesting thing done on the narrative level. We are led throughout the film, by 3 characters, to a final stage, a film theatre: Lada, Raine, and Dreyfuss. Each plans their own film, and the external film we watch is a mix of all those others. On the lower level we have the dumb Nazis, who believe they go to the theater to watch the film they made, but they are the meal to 3 different blood seekers. In the very end, Raine stands on top, despite everything, but of course the line that matters and impresses is Landa's. It's rooted on the detective story, with him always on top all the way, until almost the very end. Christoph Waltz's performance is excellent but the writing is very clever, in all respects, in all the twists. Visually, the best sequences are the ones in the theatre, and of course it's dear that all goes around films, even the fire is started by film, literally.The other great thing is the awkwardness of hearing David Bowie or Morricone driven themes in the middle of occupied France. It's like Alban Berg's music, which always gives us the impression to hear something tonal and classical, only to deceive us later. That pastiche is makes this film slide into ambiguous fields of undetermined genres. Great.Brad Pitt is a funny guy, because now he plays making fun of his public image, while giving us a totally different thing. That's something Clooney has already done for a while now (see them together in the Coen's project for that).I really loved the theatre building, the hall was a clear beautiful space, and well shot.My opinion: 4/5http://www.7eyes.wordpress.com",Null,1,8,28 September 2009
Public Enemies," avenging hats
","Some genres are constantly renewing, because they appeal to pieces and bits of our imagination that never wither, despite the political context or the ideological moment we live in. Such are the cases of the date movies, horror, or mystery. Others come and go, and every come back depends largely, to my view, on what the public demands in the specific moment of the movie. Those are the cases of the western and the gangster film. This is, i think, because both genres always deal with extreme heroic (or anti-hero) characters. Those characters always stand for something, usually selfless, usually en formed by a superior concept of moral, that exceeds the 'law', and digs into what really matters. Right now we are living through something the media calls crisis, and which, apparently, has to do with mismanagement, corruption, something about those who have some (or a lot of) power using their superior position to take away from the blind people, those who right now struggle to keep the few they have, while the powerful get away with it. This is the story line that common people accept as the summary of what is happening right now. That's why it is highly desirable to make now a film about a man like Dilinger, something who in other times, of deeper depression, became the hero for the unhappy people. Again, today as in those days, people feel unsatisfied, and need guiding lights, not coming from the upper unworthy classes, but from next door. That's when we have such guys portrayed as heroes, and the cops being the bad guys. Twenty years ago, Untouchables presented quite a different view. Cinema reflects life, without being life.Now, there's more to this film than the mere pertinence of its story. Michael Mann is an interesting director, one who really knows how to create spectacles through which we can look at his worlds like he wanted us to. He builds his films not on the narrative devices, which are always linear and usually predictable. Instead he makes an interesting mix of working characters, and building a mood out of them. In his films the characters do not exist as pieces of the world within. Instead they set the ton of that world. They don't exist in a world, the world exists within them. We, as audience, are wrapped by that world, as if caught by a snowing ball, that started rolling much before we started watching it. Mann uses, for this effect, the careful framing of details, the detachment from the establishing shots, which exist but do not drive the mood. That's why we have car mirror details, reflections, carefully photographed hats. We have that because John Dilinger tells us we live there.Two powerful scenes to be noticed. One is when Dilinger sneaks into the police department investigating him. It clearly sounds as an inserted piece of invention into a real story line, and so the scene gives us nothing new in terms of narrative development. But it is a great piece of visual/sound adequation. The other scene is the final sequence, starting in the theatre and going to the very end. Dilinger gets in, sided by two prostitutes whom we know squealed on him. They watch a gangster film, starring Clark Gable. From than on we inter cut between scenes of that film, Depp's gazing at it, with a premonitory look, and the police outside the theatre getting ready to get him. All this is en formed by the music. There is a game of Gable's film, projected onto Dilinger's feelings at the moment, and there is the police, leaded by Bale's character, projected into us, viewers, who gaze at Dilinger knowing what will happen, while he looks back at us, announcing that he also guesses what will happen, for the film 'told' him. This simple game of correspondence, competently hampered by the music fills the tension. Great. The ending, with no music, and the directness with which the policeman reports Dilinger's death to his lover is as contrasting as it is wrecking. This final sequence is precious.One major complaint, however. Mann shoots HD, and he is really exploring the medium. But because hd captures so much image detail, it is harder to elude the viewer, every editing or camera or actors minor flaw is enhanced to much bigger proportion than it used to be with film or dv. This film is filled with moments which just look poorly edited. I think this is only noticeable if you watch it on the big screen, so the film will probably gain something distributed for home viewing. Anyway, it distracts.My opinion: 4/5http://www.7eyes.wordpress.com",Null,0,0,2 September 2009
X-Men Origins: Wolverine," just claws
","Writing this now, 7 years after this film was made, gives a better insight into what Marvel has been doing. They have their set of superheroes, long embedded in pop imagination, mostly through comic books and animation TV series. Now they talk about 'fictional universe' which is a way to say they will explore each of those characters within their original specific family of characters, as well as mix them with other families and, as in this case, zoom in on certain individual characters.The biggest problem is that these decisions are based on popularity, ratings, market decisions. And Hollywood is today hostage to bigger and louder, more than ever. So there is no real narrative exploration, no filling of the spaces between the main branches. They just produce action stuff which is ordinary by any standard (visual, narrative etc.). Sometimes the film will be mildly interesting because of someone interesting they employ (Downey Jr, Swinton, Branagh...) but even there we just fill that each one could be doing something more interesting (and less lucrative). Other times they use what Downey Jr taught them in how he worked the Iron Man character: irony, winks, poking fun at the character, by deliberately stepping out of it. They learned the lesson and since than pretty much every film is conceived in such a way as not to take itself very seriously. So we have Dr.Strange, Guardians of the Galaxy, Deadpool... this last one actually has a cameo in this Wolverine mess.What they did here was simple take a character (with whom Jackman is strongly associated) and just give it to us in high doses, more intense, more screen-time, more... Hugh Jackman has a strong enough presence to carry the thin character alone so they did it.Because they have not much to say, nothing inventive to fill the narrative with, they copied the framework, and the mood from the first Rambo: the retired hero, who tries to live anonymously, away from the world, someone to whom unhappiness is ever denied and who will eventually get pulled back to the action painful world he is escaping.But this Rambo has no Vietnam, no drive, no reason to be, no real pain. Even the pain of brutally loosing a loved one is replaced by the mere rage for being betrayed. Just claws and rage. So, nothing to see here. Adamatium claws are still just claws.",Null,0,1,11 November 2016
How to Lose a Guy in 10 Days," fading diamonds
","It probably can be very ungrateful for someone with any artistic ambition in film to make a romantic comedy that appeals to a large audience (here's a pleonasm). That's because this is probably the genre with more rules to be followed. The thing is fully tailored for the audiences to believe they are watching something fresh, while seeming to be new, and never seen before. As far as my personal experience in these films goes, there are 2 things that can redeem such projects: either the comedy lines and moments are exceptionally well done and catchy, or the protagonist actors/public characters are soaked on an aura of glamour and interesting personalities, like Cary Grant, Audrey Hepburn throughout their careers or Roberts in Pretty Woman. There is a third option, which is to try and shake the genre, like say, the Coens did in Intolerable Cruelty, but that's some hard stuff to do, and hardly tried.This film doesn't work well to me on any of the 3 options above, so it fades, and fails. This is a film where both the protagonists act their characters. Both are faking to each other, and that's the fun. It's actually an interesting starting point, but the actors have to play along. the thing is McConaughey is an absolute disaster in every respect. He simply can't act, and he tries to disguise that under his over the top accent and his own sense of public personality, which is simply vacuous to me. Kate Hudson has a few poses, and knows how to smile and show her pretty face. Other than that, there's not much more we can count on as well. We are left with a few interesting funny bits, allowed by the writing of the scenes, by the very situations characters are in.Some bits work well enough as space fillers, but this is not worth an extra look.My opinion: 1/5 http://www.7eyes.wordpress.com",Null,1,1,19 February 2010
About Time," spotless sunshine
","This is very clearly a writer's film, with strong self-reference to more than one writing issue.The most obvious and extensively used device is the time quirk that literally creates the whole story: the main character (and all the males in his family) have the ability to go back in time, revisit scenes of their own lives, and change them. This means that every scene in the film does not have a definitive script. Everything can be changed, all the time. So the film flows as an ever provisional reality, the way a writer works on a script, or for those matters, the way any creative artist works. The girl works as a book publisher, reading books from people, commenting, choosing, changing them. That's a wink.The other, more clever device, is the inversion of the genre rules that come with the time travel trick. The film presents itself apparently as a romantic comedy that evolves into a light drama. The drama is born from the natural course of life - people die, life goes on, kids are born there are no tensions brought upon the relation between the romantic couple exactly to emphasize how normal life is what drives the fate of these characters. There is a moment when the possibility of adultery presents itself to the male character, but he drives it away, and this underlines again how definitive is the relationship between the couple. But he can travel in time, which means that even the facts of life are editable. So he goes back in time, and tries to change things like the poor love choices of his sister. The tension is all put on the struggle between the main character and his ever changeable fate It's an inversion of the rules, in which pawn and queen are brought to the same game level, one fighting the other. Imagine Gone in the wind if Scarlett could prevent the beginning of the war, or move away before it came to them, or something like that.The acting is solid here, and I always love the comical timing and acting of Bill Nighy. This film won't change your life or affect it in significant ways, but some parts of it will maybe stay with you, and the honesty in the portrait of romantic couple and father/son intimacy is truly remarkable from Gleeson/McAdams and Gleeson/Nighy. I trust Curtis, I always expect and know that he will always think about the structure of the film in terms of writing, and that means that he cares about storytelling conceived specifically for the screen, and I cherish that.",Null,1,1,25 April 2016
Juno," simplicity
","I've just commented on Aronofsky/Rourke's 'The Wrestler'. Also, i've seen recently a great simple Belgian film, 'Moscow, Belgium'. The reason why it matters to connect these 2 films to this 'Juno' is one: all of them are what you see, none of them pretends to be more than it is. They are honest, visceral, and straight-forward pieces of cinema. The 3 films caught the sympathy of the audiences (though the Belgian obviously didn't have the distribution of the other 2). Is this important? Maybe not, or maybe it's the sign of a tendency. Maybe the audiences are expecting to be more touched and less impressed. To be led to feel, instead of being forced to rationalize. I think that recent years have brought beautiful intellectual developments to cinema, but there is a counter-point necessary to keep films on the entertainment level, to make them invite people to watch them. Something someone like, say, Medem, did a few times. (even though his ambitious Caótica Ana was so misunderstood by the public). This Juno is a non-intellectual, visceral piece of film. It's simplistic for better and worse. Why it had so much success is, i suppose, because it took heavy themes lightly. It avoided connecting teenager pregnancy to social breakdown, to personal lives limitations. Ellen Paige was a good cast having that in mind, as well as Simmons.Does a film like this make my day? Does it fully satisfies me? No it doesn't, i look for more, i want to find more in a film than what there is at first sight. I want to wake up in the middle of the night, wondering about certain things, finding out more about what the director meant with certain things. I want to carry images with me, i want the sensation that i met someone, that a director, or an actor, or a cinematographer showed something of what he has inside. But this is good enough for what it is. It's unpretentious in the way that it is what we see. It's intellectually honest because it doesn't moralize. I sometimes am tired of seeing films that are totally the opposite of what they stand for, films that pretend to encourage free-thinking but themselves are all part of a big mounting-line, all the same, all boring and made following formulas. I admit, and even welcome a film as this one, for it refreshes things. But i hope this doesn't become a rule. I hope we can still count in the future with the developments of Medem, Iñarritu or Kar-Wai.But this IS entertaining and honest, and that was its point.My opinion: 3/5 http://www.7eyes.wordpress.com",Null,0,2,25 February 2009
Midnight in Paris," empty deepness
","Maybe because it is one of the most recent narrative creating devices, cinema is probably the most powerful we've ever invented. Certainly the one that still flashes in people's minds more easily these days. We know storytelling is probably as old as language, and language in our very peculiar human sense is as old as Humans themselves. Some filmmakers, out of the blue, constantly remind us how still little explored are the narrative power of cinema as a medium. Méliès, Welles, Kurosawa, Hitchcock, Kar Wai, Park, Tarkovsky and a handful of others, each gave us invaluable break-throughs, new ways to tell things, new forms to feel. But few have questions the limits of narrative as the structured soul of a film as Woody. Many accuse him of repeating himself. Always the same pseudo-intellectual characters, babbling empty people with trifle lives, nothing serious to say or do. Broken marriages, adultery, and so on. That's all true because those are the superficial elements on which Woody builds most of his films. But in everyone of them, he tries something he hasn't tried before, sometimes repeating some other filmmakers experiences, other times trying stuff no one has ever tried before. He misses some chances, he hits a few more, but i know he always tries. And for that reason i'll always want to see his films, made or to be made. Here he makes something that superficially resembles his celebrated Purple Rose of Cairo. But this is quite a different breed. What he tries is a highly complex experience in parallel inter-related worlds. Parallel realities where where (or when!) what happens in one, affects the other. The film begins in a recognizable present, establishes itself on other fantasy level, and finds its resolution in yet another deeper layer. Each layer is nested on the previous one, all of them rooted in Paris, and its clichés for each moment. Same space, same character, different dynamics of it. A solid triangular structure, where the same typical Allen elements find a new place to breath. In the way we find Marion Cotillard, whom we have seen in Inception, a similarly structured film about finding realities buried deep in the previous level, there mapped into dreams, and who knows, maybe here this is all mapped into the dreams of Owen's character. Inception also rooted the whole thing in Paris, one of the most filmed places ever, and one of those whose clichés are more built by films. And there also, Marion was the invented subconscious lover, who's very existence as a character was questionable.By now, its a perfectly assumed and natural thing that every film is in one way or another a blink of eye to the audiences via the reference to other films or to cinema in general. The french new wavers introduced that in film vocabulary as a common practice, so natural that you almost can't live without it today. Woody starts here with a character who Is a film writer trying to move into literature fiction. He goes to Paris, he gives us an initial montage of Paris and its recognizable places, less vigorous but much in the way of the initial sequence in Manhattan. And he places his layers, his 'golden ages' in similarly cinematic moments in time. The intellectuals and artist celebrities are there more than anything to color the human landscape, although the joke on Buñuel's film is great.If you need to find another self-referential 'meaning' to all this, than i suppose woody himself observes his new-york high empty class of intellectuals and sees it as he puts Sheen's character here: full of words but ultimately empty, boring, and utterly uninteresting. It's as if he had lived all his life trying to move up (or down) to his personal golden age, he the nostalgic for the new orleans big bands (which he uses in the initial soundtrack). You can go there and explore it like that. I like to contemplate the structure.Among the people i went to see this with, there was some discussion about why the main poster would reference Van Gogh without him even showing up in the film. I would say, maybe in a superficial way, that Van Gogh had similar aspirations to most of his paintings than Woody had for this film: painting what he saw, and layering on it a distorted vision of it, many times tormented, but always rooted in some inexistent world. In doing so he gave us transcendental figurative art (in his case fueled by absinthe and his own madness). Colors were Vincent's narrative tools. Narrative structure itself is Woody's very fabric for his films.My opinion: 3/5 another tile in woody's mosaic. What's next?",Null,2,4,3 October 2011
Sleepy Hollow," Headless world
","The engineering of any Tim Burton starts on the visual side. He is a master in creating his own specific and special vision for the stories he illustrates. And the word is quite correct, i think, he is fundamentally an illustrator. Most of the times he picks up stories, popular tales, slighted reinvented popular myths, and he embodies them in the creation of worlds the characters can inhabit. In a way, his mind works pretty much like that of a child, and i say it in the best way, there are few things better than a child's mind. This specific mind is interesting to visit, quirky, dark, sometimes weird, but worth the look.The problem is that most of the times, that specific vision, materialized on sets, and characterizations, is all there is to it. Many times he can't make that world really live and move once he magnificently designed it. In this matter, Burton's work is close to that of a designer, or an architect, who design spaces and objects, only for others to put life into them.The problem of this film is that. The world is darkly good to visit, everything is finely built, from a visual perspective, worth the visit. But the narrative dynamics function mostly like any ordinary commercial production, and that ruins partially the experience. There's no real mystery behind the story, and the interest in the headless knight is purely in his visual appearance (apparently the tale is quite known in the US, i didn't know it so i didn't expect anything in advance from it).Depp is a great actor, one of the best these days, and i think one of his greatest qualities is to know how to place himself in advance. To understand that as an actor, his first and most important decision is to know how his specific character should play along with the context of the film so that he allows things to flow around him and through him. So notice how, despite being a protagonist, his performance always gives space to the side characters, making us analyse and 'investigate' them, in the same measure that Depp's character is doing. We act with him. That's great. Christina Ricci plays this game with him, and successful looks 'just' a side character with an emotional angle until the right moment in the story comes. This is hard to do, i think. I appreciated it.My opinion: 3/5 check the acting, and visit the world Burton proposes.http://www.7eyes.wordpress.com",Null,1,2,21 October 2008
Once," not touching
","Several interesting comments on this film have already remarked many of the good things you can get from this film. Something to do with the mood of the suggested love story, the power of its simplicity, indeed of the simplicity of the whole production, from acting to sets. The story moves you, because you can relate to it and there are not sophisticated apparent devices nor worn out conventions that these guys use to get to us. So this is ultimately a direct honest film. It's not real, and while in Linklater's similar experiments one might wonder whether the film is sprinkling out of real life, here the musical insertions don't allow you to think so. But this is incredibly direct and honest storytelling, and that's rare and rewarding.There are a few things worth noticing beyond that. One has to do with the love relation we see on screen. We know it to be implicit, and never assumed all the way. Different languages. The closest we get to an effective conventional date relation is when the girl assumes her love in Czech, a language the boy doesn't understand, and which the filmmakers assume the majority of the spectators won't either. That's the sublimation of the story, more than any musical number, it's that moment. On the other end of the stick, we have the boy's attempt at a one night stand. The good thing is how the two different personalities, cultural differences, and postures, are mirrored in their musical backgrounds, and how that merges on screen. The love is in the music, is in what they come up with, how they work around their artistic differences towards a common end. This is truly a beautiful concept. That's why it was so important that the facts of the story didn't stop you to appreciate the beauty of the underlying concept. So powerful that these actors (who actually created the songs!) became lovers off screen, in real life. This is a very good case of an on screen relation: it hasn't happened yet, we see it coming, we are witnesses to it.Dublin is a witness as well, it's a great place to film, one where suitably music is an important wheel in its spiritual routine. The sense of place is strong and well achieved here, despite relatively average production values. The best films, indeed the best art is that connected to powerful ideas, the kind that runs underneath your skin. This is such a film, if the music was truly powerful instead of merely engaging, this might have proved an explosive experience.My opinion: 4/5http://www.7eyes.wordpress.com",Null,1,1,17 June 2011
The Adventures of Tintin," the hawk's point of view.
","Animation is taking interesting courses these days. Technology is being conquered by creative thinking, and that is giving us new ways to see. I suppose it's always been like that throughout history.There are several nice things about this film, I was really pleased with it, in what it does well. First, we have Spielberg back. The good one. There is one S. with an uncontrollable will to entertain, and be clever about it. That's great, the guy who gave us Indiana Jones, ET, Minority Report, etc. Than, there's the S. who wants to put his name in the book of serious filmmakers. The guy from Schindler's list, and the disastrous AI. I don't like that director. And than you have the million dollar making producer, who sometimes directs what he was only supposed to produce. That's a business, i'm OK with that one. This film is great in how it revives the 1st Spielberg, the one i've grown up loving. He's here, with no prejudice or failure, brilliant in his visual conception of the grand arch of action. Now, he's together with Peter Jackson, who's been building a world of interesting toys for the creation of cinematic visual worlds, something he began doing in LOTR. These 2 guys do fine here.Than we have Tintin. I'm totally into the books, I know everyone by heart. I don't have the personality to become a geek about anything, but I do know a lot about the books, its contexts, the author, etc. I understand there will be a number of hardcore fans who will dismiss any changes made to the original stories, as well as the blended elements from several albums. I'm fine with that, because mostly I think the changes were made to favour the visual ideas that were to be fulfilled in the minds of the makers. From the first half-hour or so on, this film is conceived as a succession of grand action sequences. These required different sets. So they include the Karaboudjan bits to take us first to the sea, than to the desert, and finally to the Moroccan city. There we have the less believable sequence of the film in terms of actual physical depictions, but also the one where the possibilities of the virtual eye are more pushed forward as far as this film goes: we have an extended chase sequence, using several transportation mediums, crossing several sets. The character being chased is a hawk, who obviously is free in terms of motion. Vertical space, multiple points of view (he is not grounded), that's the stuff that makes this sequence, where the camera and edition choose to change stance and pov multiple times, and where the spatial conception of the place reveals to us. I personally would have like to have had more of the hawk's point of view, but i was pleased. That and the other action sequences are why the film is built as it is.The first half hour of the film actually looks from another film universe. It's a tense, noir sequence, of clues and allusions, shadows and mystery. That's actually much more what Tintin is about, in terms of its dramatic core. He is a character of adventures, but hardly an action figure. I'll keep this first half hour as what the film should have been about, if there wasn't a world of visual opportunities to be got from the animation according to WETA.The need for the 3D, apart from the possible (but arguable) commercial appeal of it, eludes me here. I'd like to review this on a 2D version, just to make sure the 3D brings nothing new to it. And that's a pity.Of course there is also a possible line of argument, on whether the visual flat representation of Tintin's drawings in the comics would be fairly transposed to the screen. I actually think it is, as the dynamics of the drawings are aptly maintained even if using a different visual personality. The old Tintin cartoons that tried the transition to television are far less successful, although they try hard to be like the books.The initial credits are an incredible bit on their own, Pink Panther like.My opinion: 4/5 good news, we have a new director called Spielberg back.",Null,2,6,30 October 2011
The Expendables," tough guys
","Generally speaking, this was what was expected of it. It is a film about tough guys, properly old and old fashioned, according to today's standards. It follows every cliché of the older films, and even the action scenes of each actor mirror what we remember seeing them do. We can even see which character was supposed to be performed by Van Damme!, based on his action sequences (the flying kick, out of the fire). We have the love-driven motivations that were quite common in every breed of the 80's action, from Chuck Norris to Sly. But that was what everybody was expecting, right? Those who went to see this one wanted to see the fake toughness of this now old guys. It was a time travel, we were not watching the old guys, instead we were watching the memory of them, a cartoon of them. And having this kind of 'old glories' casting was like seeing Batman, Spiderman and Superman in the same story.But apart from that, there were interesting things going on here. One of them, the less remarkable, was the adaptation of old fashioned action styles (big muscles, physical poses, hard punches) to a modern eye to catch action, in which we are taken to the middle of the fight. In a way it was a kind of Statham vs Stallone thing. This was well done, i guess, but it's quite impossible to stitch the two together. It's like placing Chaplin on a Monthy Pyton film. But it's interesting how Stallone, the director, is in touch with what's being done.Mickey Rourke is the only true actor here. Everybody does what's expected, and risks nothing outside what everybody expects them to be. But Rourke has a true life hanging on his bones, and his bits are the best of the film, the ones where we feel we are watching a film, and not a collection of punch clips. That's why he was here, to through acting dimension to the film. That's also why they didn't put his character on the fights, nor made him killed by some stupid revenge. I enjoyed that they did this.Stallone+Willis+Arnold. It works, because it is what we know it is: the folding of the real world of the politician Schwarzenegger, who invades the space of the former actor Schwarzenegger, clicks something in the audiences that causes irresistible and stupid laughs (i laughed). The film can take, as a short isolated clip.If this could have had Van Damme, Seagal, Snipes... and someone else i'm forgetting, it would probably have been a better cartoon, but a worse film. As it is, it's well leveraged.My opinion: 2/5 http://www.7eyes.wordpress.com",Null,0,3,12 October 2010
Pan's Labyrinth," Good and Evil
","This was an ambitious project. The director was really aiming at producing something remarkable. And it does have beautiful moments, filled with intensity and visual poetry, something which warms a viewer but it is not immediately synonym to good cinema. Direct to it, i didn't really like this film, despite the overwhelming good reviews and sympathy of the audience. The narrative structure is clear and simple: we have a story that goes on in a 'real' historical time, and we have another line which is 'magical' and runs (maybe) in the head and vision of a little girl. The first thread should represent the cruelness and violence of the real world, right in the middle of a brutal war context; the second thread is the escape for those who are able to 'see' magic, here impersonated by our little girl. She reads books, lots of them, story books, and those stories leak into the world she creates, representing this in fact the leaking del Toro intentionally wanted to make, crossing his own references and creating a magical world which is in fact a mist of several 'children' stories. Well, the problem is here, to my view. Fernando Pessoa stated the paradox that a children's story should never be written for children. He meant that it should give juice to the minds of adult thinking as well. So, good children stories always include paradoxes, ambiguities and difficult decisions, remember Alice, remember Andersen, remember the Grimm, remember Sophia Mello Breyner... A good children's story, magical or not, is most of the times a synthesis of complex principles that exist in a grey world, beyond black and white. Well, here everything is black or white. You know, from beginning to the end what is good and what is bad, even the 'flaw' of our little girl comes from disobeying, not through temptation. And this is a poor vision, to me, one that doesn't live up to the way all this was executed. Because there are very very strong moments here. The fantasy characters are really engaging, the Fauno is really engaging, the way its evolution is made as the film moves along, the character with eyes in his hands is a fantastic character, all that scene is brilliantly executed. And some references are really tender. The performances are good as well. But something just doesn't go well here, and that is what i mentioned. It's as if the winner of the war in the film was the captain, and who made this film thinks one sided, good-bad, by extremes, the way he would have taught his children... spooky.My opinion: 2/5 this will be a good visual experience, if you can forget the weaknesses i pointed out. i couldn't",Null,3,7,25 December 2007
Sweeney Todd: The Demon Barber of Fleet Street," (too much) classic
","This is made out of a clear line which is perverted, and twisted, according to Burton's own visual way to put things together. In other words, we have a classical musical and a classical Burton. We get music as 'numbers' in the sort of construction the classic American musicals used, borrowed from Italian opera (bel canto, mainly). This structure uses songs where opera used arias (reflection moments), and dialogs where opera placed recitation (action moving further). Burton doesn't try to change a bit of this. I'm OK with this. Despite the musical genre has been getting some interesting new additions in recent years (Moulin Rouge stands out here), i think it's plausible to recover the classic form. Over that fully developed (and recognizable) structure, Burton places his personal vision. His concerns have much to do with image, the power of a vision, an environment, than it has to do with space. When he is able to pull off that vision with power (Batman, Ed Wood, Edward...) he creates a truly deep, visual, and lasting experience. Batman was specially well done, because it is spatially deep, as well as visually.This film is minor work, in the big picture of Burton's work. I think that happens because none of it is fresh. The base form, i mentioned it, is classic, and this Burton is also classic. the breaks he introduces were fresh once, and because they were fresh they were spontaneous. Here, things are more predictable. I supposed the pretended effect would be something of a contrast between what we are accustomed to get from a musical with Gene Kelly or Fred Astaire, and the gore/Burton imagery which includes blood in great amounts, dark environment, twisted characters (here they are all twisted, except the 'old' woman and the young lover). That contrast is felt in some spaces, it works out as something funny, rooted on a comedy sense of absurd, strange things and the way we react to them.Depp with Bonham Carter is a good team, here i think it is more effective than the more media-tic Depp/Burton. Johnny Depp is someone who is beyond the 'method', and to my view, he is adding new steps to the path Brando walked in his artistic life. I suspect something about him, but i need confirmation, that may come with a future important film he makes. He started his career on the footsteps of Brando, someone who eliminated from his characters the overly dramatic, distracting kind of acting, more suited to theatre than to cinema. He understood cinema acting as 3dimensional acting, meaning that he represents some characters, but over that he layers other meanings, personal annotations, a kind of deepness impossible to achieve with theatre (John Malkovich and Bruce Willis created personal versions of this kind of way to act). Now, i suspect, Depp is somehow coming back to those theatrical roots. He is getting 'stagy' on purpose, he is allowing for the audience to understand in many moments that he is really acting, performing, standing on a stage. I don't know where he may be getting to with this, it may even be a wrong impression based on recent parts, but i'm really interested in following this possible thread Depp is building. Buy now i don't dislike what he is doing, but i want to check where this goes.My opinion: 3/5 you have better rides to try from Burton, and from Burton/Depphttp://www.7eyes.wordpress.com",Null,0,2,23 February 2008
Burn After Reading," Genre: Coens
","It's good to watch a film by the Coens, no matter what they do. They are clever filmmakers, who have their creations always embedded in cinematic reflections, which is to say, their films exist because other films exist to support them, and for us to fully appreciate a film by these brothers, we must have a knowledge of previous creations. So far, with that work of deconstruction of genres and previous films, they have created very strong and important films, like 'Miller's Crossing' or 'Big Lebowsky'.Other times, they're just not so incisive, and they just make films to amuse themselves, and the audience. This is the case. We can understand how their previous 'serious work' influences this one, but this was made out of pure fun, and says nothing they haven't said before. But it is still fun to watch: We have a story about people who follow people, plots and subplots. Everything twists around infidelities which cause chain reaction events. Each character thinks he controls the game he is trying to play, but everybody has somebody tailing him and something he doesn't know. These lives are observed, from an upper level, by someone who has the access to all the information but simply doesn't know what to make of it. This is epitomized by the initial and ending images, satellite captured images, 'google earth' type. It gives you the whole world, but it tells you nothing about what happens down to earth.This is probably a money raiser project, something in which the brothers had a lot of fun, but in the whole body of their filmography, it is not important work.My opinion: 3/5 http://www.7eyes.wordpress.com",Null,1,3,20 October 2008
The Revenant," Blood and Snow. Bear and Flesh.
","It's wonderful to follow the path of people who are never afraid to try, no matter how comfortable and applauded they already are in whatever they are doing.So here we have Iñarritu who has been working on story layering from the beginning of his career, first with the wonderful Arriaga as a partner. Together they have created 3 films with some of the best writing ever in the history of cinema, layered writing, stuff that is now kicking in and becoming the standard of film (and TV!) stories; the kind of bricks we use to remember our own lives.After their collaboration Iñarritu did Biutiful, which almost as strong in its territory as you can get, but almost intentionally stripped of any of the layers that had been so masterfully built in the trilogy. Somehow it looked as though Iñarritu (and Lubezki) was actually 'just' the visual vessel to which Arriaga poured his dreams. But Birdman tells otherwise, and indeed builds a whole new version of layered stories, meta-narrative and ways to dream.Now Iñarritu gets into Herzog's territory, using the Biutiful approach: to have the story as quiet and simple as possible, here nearly absent, and get you to enter the journey by means of visual enchantment. Something like cinematic hypnosis. You're simply enticed to follow it, move along, survive with the character, suffer with him. The trick is simple: we are always with Dicaprio, we are him, we suffer what he does, and we aim at the same things that he does. So here we get the concept of classical hero revived and recovered, supported by the , as usual, brilliant photography of Lubezki (what a master...).This is a wonderful experience, which in my opinion balances the graphic violence as the conductor of the story as Wook Park does in his trilogy of revenge. But it falls a little short of what Herzog did in the 70', and i suppose the reasons are relatively easy to identify. Leonardo is no Klaus, not as crazy as him, and not as ready to travel to Madnessland with a one way ticket as Kinski was willing to do (and did). And the whole production is not about a bunch of guys living the madness they are trying to film. This is probably as risky a film as you can get from Hollywood, but it is still Hollywood. This is an almost extreme film about an extreme (real) story, which is unbelievable, except for the fact that it actually happened.I'm guessing that if he keeps doing what he has done after Babel, next time Iñarritu will reward us with a multi-layered narrative complex gem like Birdman. But the time after that maybe he will loose his mind, Coppola-style, and maybe he will really go up the river where this time he only washed his feet. Maybe he will actually spill the blood over the snow, instead of just enacting it. Someday maybe he will complete an opera house in the middle of some jungle, although i don't think Iñarritu is the type of artist who needs to leave his writing table to change our lives.Dicaprio will probably get an Oscar for this one. I think he is a clever actor who senses where talent is and goes with it, in the tradition of Brad Pitt. But i don't think this is superlative acting, merely competent moaning. He has had more demanding roles already.4.",Null,1,1,30 January 2016
Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows: Part 1," Rootless
","One has to face it; it's not that hard to carry a franchise like this. The books are best-sellers, and teenagers are among some of the resistant hardcore fans for whatever pop phenomena they choose to embrace. The books hit a sweet corner of contemporary souls: the lack of magic in the way they conduct their lives, driven by a vision of the world that has been excluding the power of mysticism, true mysticism, born from the most basic connections between humans and their environment, humans and themselves. The books revolve around bits of old mythologies, and deliver them with a fashionable package, filled with visual and metaphorical elements that ring a bell in our western collective consciousness. Phoenixes, wands, potions, spells...But i only care for the series because they were made into films, these books don't appeal to me, the films may appeal. And the main option in the building of the 8 (which after all will be 9) films that translate the books was that they would evolve like their main characters, which were at the beginning children. So we started as children's films, evolved to adolescent 'highschool' films, and know the films have been mapped onto a kind of a hybrid genre, oscillating between the detective story and the action film. This 8th installment falls on this category, as the previous one had. I guess the last one will get closer to the 'return of the king': epic and visceral. Apart from that evolution of the films, in some of them we have cinematic concepts that get explored, with more or less success. This is where things get interesting to me. The 3rd film was the best to me: it dealt with an coupling of time and space (that the story of the book supported) and cleverly relied on one of the best explorers of space (through camera) we have today to direct it. So we have the deepest shots in the series, the best Hogwarts, the most magic environment of the series. The Half-blood prince relied on similar principles, but instead of exploring the space, the architecture was cleverly staged, it depended on point of view, framing and mise-en-scéne. It was clever and the best film of the series post- Columbus. This gets us here, to this film, which represents a radical shift in what has been done before. Again, the story provides the clues for the visual materialization of the film: our main characters are stranded, wandering between multiple worlds, multiple realities, all of them devoid of human elements to anchor the action: snow, woods, rocks. So the rug is pulled on us, and the relatively frantic rhythm of the movie has to do with us failing to anchor our eyes on the expected sets that do Not show: we don't get to see Hogwarts. That may have been a somewhat risky decision, but i believe that at this moment, the fans only want to see the illustration on-screen of the facts they know will happen, so these guys can almost literally do anything they want.Again, as in the previous film, i appreciated the visual hint: linear time, but rootless sets. But the sets are just not interesting enough, and the effect fades with the multiplication of sets.My opinion: 3/5Http://www.7eyes.wordpress.com",Null,2,3,7 January 2011
North by Northwest," James 'Hitch/Grant' Bond
","I think it's fantastic the attitude some artists have towards their activity. I speak about those who, in a lifetime of creation go after several objectives, several different ideas, many times undefined and blurred in the beginning, and when they are able to focus them with precision, and create important stuff from there, they move along to explore new ideas leaving a lot of other artists taking their conclusions about what has happened. Hitchcock suffered influences, obviously, but what he allowed to happen after him place him among the most memorable inventors in the history of cinema. So, Hitchcock was influent through several of his works:. Rope - and following it the very notable 'Dial M for Murder' and the absolute masterpiece 'Rear Window'; this was where he exploited to maximum potential his camera eye, so influent in years to come, i really love this phase. Vertigo - the work where Hitch reflects on the role the actor can have and the over layering of roles (role inside role, actor inside the actor, and the way the observer deals with it) as well as the way a set can influence an action or a mood just by existing. North by Northwest - the first James Bond movie, Hitch and Grant are the parents of the character in cinema, it's interesting how, years later, Hitch would use Connery, the first entitled Bond actor, in his late 'Marnie'.I am a fan of James Bond, he was part of my childhood and adolescence, and he still has a place in my imagination, however, from a cinematic point of view, this last 'revolution' is, to me, the less interesting. Nevertheless, what a great film this is. Hitchcock introduced here with a cinematic quality never seen before it the chase movie theme, where every next day is undefined in location and actions, where sexual issues always show up embedded in a beautiful woman with uncertain objectives (That Hitch's blond!). Cary Grant was already the first Bond before Fleming created the character so, in a way, this film is probably the first Hitch did in which what really matters is style. The story is filled with problems and incoherences, doesn't make sense in many points... but that happens to 90% of the movies (specially action ones). Herrmann achieves here one of his most subtle and good soundtracks for Hitchcock, and everything has an irresistible good taste, even if filled with 'Hitchcockian' clichés (the iconic place for the important action moment, in this case Rushmore, Hitch showing up at the beginning, the blond woman...)Many times, loving a director's work or not has to do with personal issues, in that sense, i really love the work of Hitchcock, but apart from that, all the enormous merits he ad ought to be recognized and, to my point of view, this is one of his (in this case not so brilliant) achievements.My evaluation: 4/5 its watchability has to do, i suppose, with its pace and rhythmhttp://www.7eyes.wordpress.com",Null,0,2,14 July 2007
Save the Last Dance," external ballet
","This is a teen movie. This means it works under strict formulas, ruled by market and by what the big bosses of Hollywood think teenagers want. There is a big contradiction behind the majority of these teens movies.: In most cases (this is no exception) these films tell stories of people who try to outdo themselves. These characters try to make special things, to get over the underdeveloped environments (socially, culturally, economically) from which they come from. So, ordinary people trying to reach special goals, trying to be special people. But than, all these films are perfectly ordinary, made massively, one copying the other, with absolutely nothing special beyond any of them. This one doesn't totally enter that kind of film for one redeeming element, but it practically does it.Here, the female character is someone whose attempt to grab her personal dreams led her (in her view) to a personal downfall, her male match is someone who fits perfectly the stereotype i described above. The matching of one against the other and the conflict this generates is mildly interesting, though not enough to take the film out of its vulgarity. The redeeming element is how dance is used to illustrate this contradiction. Ballet vs hip-hop, internal vs external forms of expression. I frankly thought Julia Stiles didn't go well in this part. She was strangely stiff and uneasy. She has a sober way of acting, but here it sounds like if she wasn't quite sure of how to express, like if she couldn't 'dance'. Yet the idea of placing dance as a displayer of characters attitudes towards their reality and what happened/may happen to them was interesting. The overall product was quite flawed.My opinion: 2/5 interesting concepthttp://www.7eyes.wordpress.com",Null,1,2,2 October 2008
Being John Malkovich," voyage to your (other) self
","Some films define what your dreams will become. Others help you understand what your dreams are made of. Maybe these two ideas are more close to each other than i'm willing to admit. Anyway, this film is the second type. At least to me. I am a romantic, incurable. I cry over love, uncorresponded love, true love. More and more, these last months have been a difficult hard period in my life, a time of change, indecision, not about love, but everything else. So i feel immediately like Cusack's character, someone who is not allowed to puppeteer. All i said so far would make this film special for me.But this is cinema, and that's what breaks things for me here. So, in what concerns cinema, what we have here is the mix between an inspired and competent director, two of the best actors working these days (Cusack and Keener), one really interesting mind, which actually borrows himself to be the film stage, quite literally (Malkovich), and one of the best screenwriters ever.Kaufman's writing is, to some extent close to that of Medem. Both envision the world as a black sky filled with shiny star dots. Than, out of that sky, they take a magic marker and unite dots, until they shaped their own personal constellations, until they've put their souls into the sky. If you are willing to track down what they mean with every dot they choose to make their own, you will know that you are in a different world, not at all separated from our own, because it intersects it, but truly, you'll be 'inside' someone's head. You will not control it, you will not puppeteer it, but you'll be blessed. The difference, though, between Medem and Kaufman, is that the first one directs what he writes, always. So we have always a coordinated vision, that strikes every bit of what we see. Kaufman collaborates, and in the process gains what the directors have to give, but takes the chance of being misunderstood. In this film, all the compensations and personal interpretations by the main creative intervenients seem perfectly balanced to me. This is a sweet experience, something you will not forget.Spike Jonze has a career as a video clip director, and that shows, he takes the visual representation of Cusack's dramatizations to a high level, and that's a fundamental piece of the metaphor. Puppeteering, the illusion of a created life on stage, taken to staged lives, in the real world. How Schwartz has to become another person in order to become himself, in order to freely express. In order to get the illusion of true love! What a true drama that is. How Maxine bends the benders, deceives the deceivers, manipulates everybody, even those who are supposed to be the manipulators; only to find out she shouldn't. How Lotte is the ultimate manipulated woman, and because of that is the only uncorrupted. How Malkovich, ultimately, doesn't exist. How Lester is the closest to God that we have on film.Undecisions, half way between places, half floors. Channels between people, people as vessels which can contain multiple selfs. Creating literally your own reality, by blurring the definitions of self. This is as much about love as it is about the process of living that love. This is as much about truth as it is about what truth means. This is as much about a story as it is about how to tell stories. This is as much a film as it is an essay about making films, about cinema. This is a master piece of self-reference.My opinion: 5/5 probably 'eternal sunshine..' tops this, but this will be a part of you, if you'll allow it.http://www.7eyes.wordpress.com",Null,0,0,25 October 2009
Shrek Forever After," recycling
","They had to take this tale a few steps back in order to make a 4th version of it. The first one sounded fresh in how it reused popular cosmologies borrowed from the sweet corner of children's oriented stories. The second one floated over that and played an interesting game of twisted self-reference(s). That was the best. The comedy was in the out references and how the filmmakers played with them. The form itself was funny, more than the jokes or the characters.Now this 4th version needs to make a story about how the romantic story involving the ogre and the princess has to happen again. So the story is literally reset to the very start, before Shrek knew Fiona, or the donkey, or before the cat was a recognizable character.I admit the device works to revive the freshness of the first film, after the disaster of the third one. If you play along and want to get nostalgic about that one, made 10 years ago, you can enter the game and have a few laughs. The cleverness of the device allows you to do that. But there's not much happening here, apart from that.The characters are as tired by now as poor Shrek at the beginning of the film when he punches the table.My opinion: 2/5http://www.7eyes.wordpress.com",Null,0,0,28 January 2011
Ratatouille," Welles cooking!
","This is very good work. Pixar is by now a solid bet, and they have brilliant minds who are working their ways in new cinematic adventures. Here is another.The principle of the thing is a being (mouse) who is able to control another being (human) and thus create his art (gastronomy). This is announced before the beginning of the film with the short 'Lifted', i commented on it and there placed my view on the subject.The way the story develops is fully Disney anchored, some bad people, lots of great beings, some trouble in the middle and a happy ending. We're used to it.The reason why this is adventurous is because of the movement and placement of the virtual camera. This is really well done. I suspect the reason why a mouse was chosen was because being such a small animal, which at the same time can move around easily, it was perfect for being climbing up shelves, going inside walls with rusty pipes, being on the floor looking up, being inside a cooker's hat (and there you get the transparency of that hat, another theme to work visually) and moving quickly between all those places. So they have that point of view, the one of the mouse, and layered on that, they shift constantly and go to the point of view of the humans around, other animals. This is very well paced, of course, and the editing is superb. The camera works as Welles might have done it, it understands virtual space, and explores it.This is much much better in these concerns than 'finding Nemo' (which was sort of a disappointment to me) and i suspect i know why. There we had an immense space (the ocean) which we were free to explore. But that wasn't well done there probably because there were lacking physical references, objects that could stay still while the characters were moving around (great work exploring the possibilities of deep space is the one Besson does, while filming directly the ocean in Atlantis but also in practically the rest of his work).My evaluation: 4/5 http://www.7eyes.wordpress.com",Null,1,1,11 September 2007
Tropic Thunder," Acting actors who act actors
","I must confess i'm not a great admirer of Ben Stiller. Even though sometimes he finds interest concepts to explore in the films in which he is more actively involved (as writer above all), his own performances strike as relatively ordinary, despite effective, and that passes me the impression of being watching a minor actor.Well, not here. Not at all. Here he embraces a reflection and a deconstruction of what an actor does, and essential what may mean to be an actor. A film about acting, where actors act several roles, one over the other in some cases. I like this material. In this ride to the jungle of actor constructions, he takes Downey Jr. Casting him is one of the most intelligent things here.So we have a group of actors who move to the jungle to shoot a film. Along the way, due to a series of events, they eventually take 'real' locations for sets, and 'real' people for actors. They keep on acting, even when they know they're no longer in the reality of the film within the film we are watching. Maybe they're acting for us.The writer of the film within the film is himself an actor performing a role he invented for himself. We come to know that as we find out he is a fake, and invented the whole plot of the film within. What everybody in the film we're watching takes as real events is in fact fiction the fake supposedly handless writer creates. So he also creates the places every actor on the film within will perform. In that film everybody acts differently and over posed roles: Stiller is trying to outdo himself, so he tries to grab the main role which would naturally (in the reality we are given) belong to the 'star' Downey Jr. Eventually he comes to find a star role in an improvised stage. Stardom is his theme, and the motivator of his acting.Downey Jr is the most interesting and more complex character, for the own construction in the screenplay and for his own deepness as an actor. He is an Australian actor, blond and blue-eyed. We know Downey Jr as a public figure and he is not like that at all, so we get him acting right here. In the film he dies is skin black, changes his hair and eye color to look black, afro-American urban black. This is another role, representing a certain stereotype who actually acts all the way, whenever they perform they're urban character. The plot also has a real black guy who has frictions with Downey Jr for him to act like a black guy without being one when in fact they both act that part, latter on we'll have a glimpse at the real sensitive gay personality of the real black guy. The comedy is in this contradiction between both characters.Jack Black is the most straightforward character. Also the most uninteresting to me. That's because his acting is only as a 'public' personality in the reality of the film we are watching. An idol to child and teen audiences who actually is an addict to drugs, and a fully uninteresting character in his real life. It's a version of Groening's Krusty, the clown. Black has a great potential for comedy and for playing interesting games with it, petty that couldn't come out here.A discreet yet interesting character is the one Baruchel performs. That's because he is the only one who doesn't perform in the mad reality of the jungle. He knows where he stands, he doesn't enter the hallucinating world the others embrace to the point of mixing they're own personalities, and probably that's why he is, in the film, the weakest actor. He acts to get laid, no special relation to it.All this mad, beautiful playing with actors who play characters who play characters who... is well framed in the beginning and in the end by the 'celebrity' reality of those actors. This is underlined by the Oscar ceremony where the film we watch ends, and for all the gossip and past lives of those actors we come to enter to a certain extent. The beginning gives us a number of false trailers of films where the actors have starred. Cameos like that of Tobey Maguire establish the credibility of this. The film starts with no credits, and we are given those trailers as if they were in fact part of the trailers we see in theaters always before the film we're expecting. I loved the detail.For the first time since Magnolia, Tom Cruise acts. He was not announced, or very little mentioned in the promotion of this tropic thunder, and that was intended for us to be surprised. Double surprise. Not only he is there, he is also 'not' there. He is acting... that's a surprising little account on the 'actors who act' theme. He is vibrant, he really is funny because we wouldn't expect him to do everything he does. It was a pearl.I suppose American audiences will appreciate the fun made around goofing with australians and English characters. i'm out of it.I mark this with my higher mark, though it may change based on future viewings of the film and, mostly, how it will accommodate in my mind. I just found it so intelligent and well executed, i think it deserves the place.My opinion: 5/5 http://www.7eyes.wordpress.com",Null,1,3,14 October 2008
The Commitments," hard tenderness
","Alan Parker is a generous filmmaker, in the sense that he allows himself to merge into the fabric of his themes, to allow the film to have its own life. That's something i wouldn't appreciate in Kar Wai or Welles, whose personal way to bend stories is the very reason why i go to their films. But Parker seems to have his biggest strength in understanding what the film needs, and allowing it to breath. That's a great quality.Here he tackles soul music appropriated by irish workers, and Dublin, as tokens for the irish spirit. The mere quality and expression in the execution of the songs justifies the cult this film as grown around it since it came out. The music is not original, everything we hear are covers of songs for the masters of soul, but the interpretations are so engaging that you can hardly not be driven by them. It worked so well, that a band composed by several actors from this film, performing under the name of the band in the film still has a career today, still performs live gigs. Among all the good things there is to say about the musical performances, i'll mention the lead singer's face. Andrew Strong's voice delivers all the passion necessary for these songs to work. But his face, apparently so unappealing, forms a series of otherworld expressions, shapes, painful phrases coming out of some upper fantastic world. Parker understood it, and that's why he frames it so often when he sings, in close-up. He engages us in ways hard to understand. Of course than we have a funny plot that surrounds the musical moments, but that's a mere support. The music is the main character, not the supporting bits to a central story.Irish jokes and the black soul of America. That has proved a powerful mix. This film deserves credit, it's a fine moment.My opinion: 4/5http://www.7eyes.wordpress.com",Null,1,2,10 September 2011
Quantum of Solace," Bond after Bond
","I've always followed the Bond series in my film life. First by tracing the old ones, and than by following the Brosnan flicks as they got out, and now watching these new Craig phase. The Bond franchising, for the options it always took, stylistic and commercial, as well as for the longevity it has by now, is perfect for us to trace how the notions of action for grand masses tastes have evolved. The Bond films probably never invented the notions which wrapped all the films, instead they've always stick to the popular conventions in its moment. Sometimes, though, they created great films in their own moment. So, someone interested in 'archeaolgy' of action films, will necessary have to go through the Bond films, and maybe intersect them with important groundbreaking films (from North by Northwest to the Bourne franchise).This film clearly corresponds to what i described above. It is an action film fully in the mood of what action-film goers seek these days. The roughness and cruelty in the fights (a certain 'realism'), the editing as a confusing yet engaging element, which does not allow us to see the whole thing from the outside, instead brings us closer to the film. The inner depths of the main characters matter these days, and so we have Bond finding himself.We have all that here. Is it competently done? To my eyes, yes. Is it enough for the film to be 'good'? To the same eyes, no.Why? The whole Bond series is so diverse in terms of the stylistic approach, personality of the Bond actor, political and social context of that moment's 'real' world, that all the films would sound just disconnected if it wasn't for something that would bind them together. That thing was the elements of the character, Bond, and the surrounding elements that would support the whole constant mood of the thing (the gadgets, Q, the girls, the globe trotting stories...). In Casino Royale those elements were absent or distorted, and that was OK because the film was about digging and (re)inventing those elements, something like what 'Batman Begins' had done the year before. So we played along that game, wanting to find out. Bond was visceral, unsophisticated, but finding himself. No decided step forward was taken in this film. It lingers between the Bond film we know will come, with the 'real' Bond everybody knows, and the previous Casino Royale where we accepted the roughness of the character as part of a process. There could have been a transition, but i should have felt that something had evolved from 'casino..' to this one. I didn't.My opinion: 3/5 http://www.7eyes.wordpress.com",Null,2,2,19 December 2008
No Country for Old Men," the children who got out of the sandbox
","This film is a great experiment in many levels, it is one of the best uses of widescreen i've seen in recent productions. The photography is enviable, and i call attention to all the scenes taking place at the slaughter location. Day, night, down up, up down, all the situations and angles are tried, they all mean different things in different moments of the narration. It's really good work. But there are questions to be reckoned, i think.I'm convinced that most of the enjoyment one can take out of a film (or other creative work) is a matter of personal decision. Basically you have two choices: get superficial, or think/feel. The vast majority of the average cinema crowds work in the first case which basically translates into 'did i like the story', 'did i like the performances' (on the basic level of convincing/artificial), and the prettiness of the images. For that kind of crowd, this film will work perfectly, because it is built with already seen situations/plots/characters. None of this is unusual, drug dealers, money, sheriffs, and the border with Mexico, Oh and the psychopat. With this lines, i'm not taking myself out of that average crowd. I work my ways in trying to understand what might be behind what i've seen. In this case, i don't believe the Coens would simply go with the flow, and make what would be expected from other competent directors. But indeed, apparently they do... i suspect it was on purpose.I like to check for self-reference in films, or metaphors to the real world machinery of things. I tried to make my one interpretation of the world i watched in this film and establish a possible relation that may have some logic, or none at all. It is important to say that i didn't read the book, nor am acquainted to McCormack's writing, but i think the influence of it may be felt in the narrative structure, of episodes which are parallel which from time to time intersect and connect (the Coens don't often work this way). Anyway, i decided to watch this: we have a film starting in the aftermath of a slaughter. Several bodies, dispute over drug in a border territory, and a use amount of money. This is staged for us, it is the section in the film where we are more forced to really see the set and be placed there. We have someone who is totally clueless about anything that has occurred, and fate/fortune takes him to find the money. And we have him being hunted for that. Check the hunter. Everybody thinks he is crazy, that 'you (he) don't have to do this'. But he never gives in a little bit. He has his own moral, he creates his rules, and he even gives fate a chance, when he uses a coin to decide on life or death. All and all he just seeks exactly the same as everybody else, the 'macguffin' (money), but somehow we know he has other motivations, though we really can't tell what. This was made by two brothers, who are proud of being the ones who play in sandbox of the corner of Hollywood, make their games and don't get annoyed by those who are 'just' after the money. But hey, they also play the big game, they also produce in the context of the Moss and the Wells, and they are under the jurisdiction of the Bell. They are not independent in the bankrupt European vision, they are not even low cost filmmakers. They are stars, and the mediatic success of this film made them even more like stars. So I think i watched a game. The Coens putting crowds, investors, producers watching themselves running and fearing the Coens, and laughing. Undercovered irony. But i'll add a catch to this possible game. The film filled many pockets, it is watched, and its success may turn it into some kind of a paradigm, of a style to be chased, copied, and recognizable. So who won the game? And by the way, i think this is one the most 'conventional' Coens films ever, conventional in relation to the Coens films as much as in relation to conventional films.My opinion: 4/5, it's playful to watch Joel and Ethan, but i think they've done better. But this is a good filmhttp://www.7eyes.wordpress.com",Null,1,3,4 March 2008
Batman Begins," Getting into the film
","Nolan and Bale are two of the director - actor whom i follow with more interest nowadays. Right now they make a good pair, and besides the two renewed Batman films (of which i'v only seen this one), they made the very good Prestige. This, on its own, makes me interested in this project.It was ambitious, serious, and not totally flawed what was made here. Apparently Nolan really wanted to be part of this, and approached Warner Bro. to get the job. He knew he could bring something to the the superhero film, and probably Batman suited best what he likes to do. It's a self-made superhero, he's not created by accident, and in the process of the creation of his mask (which is Batman or Wayne?) there is a quest for an inner self, unlike say, IronMan, who plays science with his body. So, in Nolan's vision, we need an actor that can act, and we need several cinematic and design devices that work. We have all of them sketched here, though not totally successful. Taking IMDb top 250 films, which as i write puts Dark Knight in 4th place, he probably solved the problems there. But than again, Shawshank Redemption is in number 1.city: The conception of this has a lot to do with the city itself. There is clearly the intention to create something detached from previous films - 'realistic', in Nolan's words. So this is modeled after Chicago, something we can recognize, and has a dark cloth falling over it, of decadence, social bankruptcy, corruption. The places are well explored, and used for the cinematic trick i'll talk about.A complaint: Gotham City used to be The world, in Batman. We didn't even feel that there was a world outside it, it was self sufficient, and balanced, as a closed world where all is born. I'm sorry it couldn't be kept like that.cinema: Besides the Hollywoodian sequences of Wayne training, Wayne learning, Wayne building costumes, and finding places, there is something great, on the cinematic side. The main plot is played around fighting a 'league of Shadows' which tries to spread an hallucinogenic gas for the city. That poison makes people see everything become their worst fears. They loose sense of reality, and start to fraction they're own vision, and misunderstand/exaggerate what they see. The editing and pace of the film are built in accordance, so in the more active bits, we feel the film as the people of Gotham probably feel what they see. We become active viewers, and that's great. It was only felt in some pieces, and that's the flaw. Most of the time is spent on building the Bat's world, and Wayne's inner self. I wish we could have more, but i'd choose some of the sequences of this film to watch many more times. Christian Bale is in this ride, he knows what's happening, and allows it to happen. Great work. This is what cinema is bringing new now and for a while. Making us part of the game.My opinion: 4/5http://www.7eyes.wordpress.com",Null,0,0,28 October 2008
Twilight," romanticism
","This was actually a very good surprise. I was prepared to hate this film. The books appeared as half-baked teen stuff, empty and just made to capitalize on the doors to otherworldliness as Harry Potter defined it to the XXI century: strange beings, odd variations on our real world, and a link to this same world, that makes the story and characters appear as if they could really exist, thus engaging more the audiences to whom this is intended. This Twilight series had an extra dullness that put me away: it revolved on the 'fantasy' clichés, and to that, added the vampire film world. So it was playing safe twice.The one thing that truly fails is the male character casting. Robert Pattinson is a stain here, he has no presence whatsoever. He throws his lines as if he was sitting in a toilet, his facial expression is bloodless, but not in a vampiresque fashion, his pose is artificial, although that works for his character (lucky there). I think they wanted to capitalize the actor who had had a short yet emotional character in the Potter series, and thus attract even more of the audiences of Potter. On the other hand, Kristen Stewart was a nice surprise. I don't know if she'll get out well of the teen movie world, but i'll be wanting to watch new things from her. She was tense in an unstressed way that usually we don't have in such young actresses.But what i did like was the general mood chosen to this film. There is a very sweet and tense sense of romanticism that goes through the film, and that's what really caught my attention. It's a genuinely not corny melancholy, where the growing adolescent feelings between vampire and human take a sweet place at the center of the narrative. Regular readers of my comments know and appreciate such films which can convincingly build and sustain a mood, like an invisible glow which surrounds every element of the film. Wong Kar-Wai is the all-time master of this. So i care about trying to understand what produces such effect. Here i think the first anchor of this mood is Stewart and her controlled, intense performance (i wonder if she learned it from Foster). The second anchor is the cinematography and the very well succeeded choice of colors and sets. But the most important thing is the camera work. The hand held camera in the closeups while the lovers have dialogs are really something of superior class. Editing helps, but how the shots were conceived really works well. Some dialog moments are worthy of some bits of some Lumet's films. That is saying a lot.My opinion: 3/5 http://www.7eyes.wordpress.com",Null,2,5,6 November 2010
The Transporter," dry powder
","This is based on nothing. Everything explodes, but it blows nothing. The elements that were used on this film will be regarded, i suppose, as the main characteristics in action films from this first decade of the century. We have a specific cinematography, based on blue tones which in the end work as a kind of sober image, tough, hard. This is supposed to set the tone for the action, which will be choreographed, but also hard, heavy, sometimes violent. Editing has a fundamental part in all this, many times we, spectators, won't be allowed to understand exactly everything that happens. The Bourne features started this, i think, Casino Royale successfully exploited the notion, as well as several other films. Not this one. This is a collection of useless tricks, which don't work in any situation, in any part of the movie. There's nothing here. It emulates badly its references, it lives on a certain style, but that style is corrupted and it is incompetently used here.My opinion: 1/5 stay away.http://www.7eyes.wordpress.com",Null,0,1,11 March 2008
Revolutionary Road," filling with emptiness
","Sam Mendes can do little wrong in my book. He envisions things cinematically, and he is always able to propose a mood, and transcribing it into film. So his films are always about a mood, and what he tries to do is something i value a lot: basically, the film, as a medium, should reflect the film, as a content. The film passes its characters urges, expectations, disillusions, onto us.That's what we have here: emptiness. The film is about shallow characters, ridiculous hypocritical lives, unhappy people, afraid of facing their unhappiness ('no one ever forgets the truth, you only learn to lie better'). The story is meaningless for the facts in themselves (maybe the novel had a social impact in its days), what makes it worthy is the mood it suggests, that the film completes.So the set up is quite simple. Mediocrity, middle class useless life-styles. Assumed and accepted lack of ambition. Paris as the synonym for self-superation ('it didn't have to be Paris'). Kate's character learns about her own frustrations, and that triggers the whole drama. Now, watch how this simplicity is transcribed to visual terms: -very few sets; the house, the woods, the working place, and a few more with little screen time. -the stupidity and shallowness underlined in every dialog, except for the lines of Winslet's character and Shannon's. -the simplicity in the cinematography choices. And the outcome of that, so effective. Watch the film, and check what you have of it in you, just a few hours after... nothing, just a sense of uneasiness, restlessness, frustration for something is missing in the film. Just like Kate's character was feeling. Get it? Kate is one of the finest actresses these days, the role here was a struggle between personality and submission, will to transcend and routine. She understood it so well.Two interesting things:Kate and Sam: actress/director couple. Both are interesting as artists. There is love. We can check it, frame by frame. Ted Goranson always remarks on husbands directing their wives, and i get it. It's a sort of extra motivation. Beyond the artistic urges and intentions that triggered the need in the director to create this film, we have a layer of extra-passion for he wants to bound his art to his love. It's a beautiful concept, truly.We don't have Conrad Hall here. I missed that. OK, the intention was to make a highly simplified film, so strong iconic images were not so much the kind of game Mendes wanted to play here. But i miss the poetry of light, the poetry of understanding bodies, and body placement, and faces that Hall had. We have much to appreciate from what he left, but He and Mendes were so perfectly connected in the two projects where they worked together, that i get the sensation that some pages were not written as they should. Pity. Roger Deakins made a competent work here, me referencing C.Hall is not a depreciation of this film's cinematography.My opinion: 4/5http://www.7eyes.wordpress.com",Null,0,0,17 February 2009
X-Men: The Last Stand," zero content, worse effect
","it's a sad thing when a franchise like this scrambles the foundations of the comic mythology to the point of making it unrecognizable in its general elements. I feel comfortable writing about this because i never followed the comics, my contact with x-men always came from TV animated series, or the films.The x-men were based on a basic metaphor of being different. because you have a different characteristic, that doesn't mean it is bad. You have to learn who you are, and live with it. Ultimately, we're all mutants, who just have to acknowledge who we are. Understand our 'difference', and our weaknesses, and explore them. So, the ordinary human being in the series, is the guy who normally won't cope with the difference. They simply won't understand it. That's where the mutant vs human thing comes up. And of course, mutant vs mutant, because some mutants won't understand and deal with rejection. Along the way, we'd get lots of effect, different characteristics, wings, adamantium, weather controlling powers, psychic mutants, magnetic ones, etc etc. the possibilities were endless.But here, everything is messed up. mutants manipulate mutants, and apparently every faction is 'just' covering their own ass. There is no larger aspiration, no grander intentions. We are even taken away the mentor of the 'ideology of difference' early at the beginning, Xavier. It's turned into a simple action flick, emptied in its original cosmology content, rather poor in terms of visual sequences, but still so expensive that one can not see it as the honest work of some b series lovers. So, we're left with nothing.My opinion: 1/5 http://www.7eyes.wordpress.com",Null,1,2,22 February 2010
The Lives of Others," reasons to be Human
","One of the living thinking minds i most admire is George Steiner. He is a man of great intelligence in the way he knows why knowledge is meaningful, and why it is important to Know. Among the many issues that have been a constant concern in his thinking life, one has been with me all the way since Steiner showed it to me: the brutal contradiction between human actions, or how he would put it; how can someone cry over night deeply moved by a Schubert Sonata, and in the next morning coldly order the killing of thousands of people.This fundamental issue was vivid in my mind all the way, throughout this happily depressing film. There even is a direct reference to this question in it. So the theme here is how the meanings of art, or the simple reference to it can influence a mind trained to not be influenced and mechanically not behave humanly. Minds trained to trust what they're taught.The way this is put together is with one of the most subtle cinematic constructions i have (ever?) seen. The focus is on the artists, repressed artists, subjugated by a repressive regime. In the world framed in this film everything moves around them. Those artists are watched, constantly. We watch them, and in that watching we have the company of someone whose job is literally to watch. He starts with cold inhumanity (the first scene establishes that), obsessive watching, which that regime would probably consider simply 'professional'.In the way he gets involved with the subject of his watching (artistically modeled lives). Several things underline this: Art bends his mind to the point in which he plays double and starts writing an invented story to protect the real story the play writer is writing; He steals a book from the subject he's watching, and secretly reads it at home; he asks a prostitute to stay with him longer than the deal would require, basically to be more than sex. Ultimately, he rewrites the ending of the whole story by hiding a forbidden object (a typewriter!) and thus secretly entering and changing the life of the artist.This is a perfect expression of the dangerous of true commitment to true art, the art which embraces ideas that matter.The camera is subtle, it moves most of the time, its movement doesn't call attention, but always add up to the tension, mostly with subtle travelings. And watch the use of space. See how the interior of the apartment is used, how the cinematography carefully captures all the nuances and how they enlarge and diminish the inner space, in accordance with what the characters feel. Than notice how the humanity of that coloured environment is contrasted with the attic where the watcher stands, and even how he abstractly recreates the space below, from the sound of it. Ulrich Mühe really had a deeply moving and intelligent performance. Very sad that he left us so early, here he really is something to look at, and performs fully in the field that most impresses me: that of subtlety, that kind of acting of great expression out of imperceptible moves. Most of it is in his face, so many times carefully framed.The aftermath of the thing is when the artist writes a book, supposedly about the story we just saw. As if the film we had just seen was in fact made from the book. I was lucky to watch such a film. what a privilege.Most of the times, i appreciate a film for its qualities as a vehicle for new/interesting ways to pass a story, or for how its visual quality/presentations gives me themes to dream about. This one works on the both previous aspects, but does it in a theme that matters. That's so rare.My opinion: 5/5, watch it if you want to feel more human.http://www.7eyes.wordpress.com",Null,1,2,15 October 2008
Driven," nascar, not F1
","Car racing and films. Sports and films. Of you let go your imagination, these are powerful mixtures. Sport is about movement, it's like a dance, and that's cinematic, indeed it is one of the most rich cinematic fields. It has live emotion, which means you will not no what to expect, despite taking sides. There is a strong aspect of suspense that surrounds every game, every sport, and racing isn't an exception. But than there is a huge catch: no one (supposedly) knows where it will go. Anything can happen in sports, it lives on the moment, more than any live or filmed performance, musical theatrical or any other else. So, this means that in order to keep the fuel of sports emotion true and alive, you can't stage it. And you can't make a feature film without having nearly everything staged. So that's the difference. Dance, music, theatre, it's all a performance, it's all about delivering something that has been preestablished. Cinema inherited this. That's why we need interesting minds to have interesting art, where the most talented of the sportsmen can perfectly be an intellectual schmuck. And it's also because of this that i personally find it impossible, at least with the tools we have so far, to successfully create a film (not documentary) that binds together sports (any sport) and film. That's probably why the Wachovsky explored racing relying on technology, because they knew the ordinary tools were useless (i haven't seen 'speed racer' yet). And yes, we have Chariots of Fire, but sport is only incidental there, and works as a frozen performance, which the music enhances. Pure sports films, i don't know any that is remotely interesting.Even less when we have the attitude of this film. This is such a mess, way beyond the problems of sports and film together. So here we have Reynolds, playing a crippled ex macho racing hero, which is probably the only role he ever played. We have Stallone, playing the old war hero, coming back to action, to save the day where he is needed. And we have a couple of other cliché characters, uprising stars, guys struggling to be themselves, and to feel free. Anyway, check this: every pseudo dramatic arc that is intended here exists in a different world of relationships. Love over Success, Pride, personal affirmation. Dull, vulgar, done below the watchable. Not even a single try at filming the races in an interesting way. All explosion and injuries, coins grabbed by the tires, spectacular collisions, boring, useless.Oh, the rescuing scene by the two leaders of the championship still can look ridiculous in the middle of this ridiculous film My opinion: 1/5http://www.7eyes.wordpress.com",Null,0,1,30 October 2009
I Am Legend," Wayne meets Harry Potter
","I confess i had put some expectations on this. I haven't seen the old films that supposedly this one references, but still i have a great sympathy for films constrained in space and characters. This one had a great set up: New York, completely abandoned, regained by Nature after the collapse of mankind, and used by one single man! The visual possibilities of this are great, and the dramatic arc as well, even though here the success would depend greatly on what the actor did. Will Smith is a craftsman, not an artist, and what might be done with such a character is way out of his league. It was also out of Tom Hanks possibilities, and even Nicholson only came close to doing it right.I admit, the visual result was satisfying, they resisted the temptation of exaggerating in the special effects and creating a wilder city than it deserved. Some pieces of city were really nicely imagined. But than again, they might just have done that, show us in an exhibition, and they needn't wrap it around the crap plot, story, so on...The major problem is the goofiness of a half-crazy character, who starts alone, and ends up the hero of all mankind. In they way he (1)finds out the cure for the virus, all alone! and (2)physically saves that discovery so that the remaining humanity might live on and learn from his example. What a hero! He suffers, he survives, he has moral, he is a scientist, he is a martyr. I think this might sound a little bit exaggerated if placed in a pre-Leone western, but right here, right now, it aches. It is a kind of straight forwardness that i may put up with in old films that have other qualities, but i just won't take here.So, the virus not only kills, but in reduced percentages turns humans into vampires, so that we can have the city free during the day, and so that we can have scary faces and physical challenges for Smith, as well as exploding numbers. It's just too forced, and out of focus.Mike Patton sounds for the vampires are nice (i read somewhere he made their sounds).My opinion: 1/5 http://www.7eyes.wordpress.com",Null,1,2,22 August 2009
School of Rock," B(l)ack to the past
","I have to watch to Jack Black's recent Tenacious D feature to choose where i like to see Black in 'related to music' projects more: the two options for me are either 'tenacious d, the pick of destiny' or 'High Fidelity'. This 'school of rock' is not running for it. Definitely not.I give great credit to Black, for his complete comedy skills, he successfully joins physical, verbal and gimmick comedy. As important as hearing is seeing him. In High Fidelity he was perfectly adapted and integrated in a correct crew (actors, producers, directors) and was serving a rather intelligent construction, great writing. Here he is prima donna. And he delivers it. If there is one good reason to watch this, is for Black's performance. And that's about it. All the rest is just lazy.The biggest disappointment is definitely Linklater. Apparently, with this one, he moves one step towards uselessness through 'blockbusterization' of his once clever and personal film-making style. It happened before, Frankenheimer comes to my mind. His youth work (not that he is old now) was serious, by someone talented, and very pertinent. Than he had 'before sunrise' where he came out as fresh as ever, with all the quality and spontaneity of the low budget features. 'Before sunset' had none of that, but it was still competent and had some elements. This completely blows it. I have to see his 'Fast food nation' to understand if this is to Linklater as a number of films (Jack, The rainmaker, etc) are to Coppola (fund raiser projects, basically) or if he's really giving up trying to do what he once did well.My evaluation: 1/5 You don't have to watch it, unless for Black.http://www.7eyes.wordpress.com",2,2,8,2 July 2007
Gran Torino," twilight
","You can watch this film as it is, as it presents before you; which is to say, with the audience appeal package that the story carries with it: -immigration in a contemporary view, facing western societies as an institution in transition, to the point that the once American way of life quite neighborhoods are occupied and relived by the families from once enemy countries. -The tense action promise that never unfolds but which carries the film. As entertainment, this is worth the ticket because we wonder about what's happening next, even if nothing ever really happens (in a physical graphic meaning). So it's a tense promise of action, that never ceases to be a drama in the end. Good genre play.You can place the film within the political views of Clint Eastwood, within the place that racial and gang conflicts assume in such suburban areas as the one in the film. one might want to see this as a 'political' film, or as a 'socially concerned' film.You can choose to watch the above, and consider other layers you may feel right. I want to see this film as a solid step in the work of Clint, the director. To me, this film is clearly one of the twilight of his career. Not because he's no longer young, but because this film is about clint's career as an actor as it is about his own cinema. That's why we have his own character as a parody of all his tough, intolerable cops and cowboys, from Leone to Siegel. The fun thing is how his character becomes his own anti character in the end. How the tough 'feel lucky punk' guy ends up not being violent in order to beat the bad guys. That's certainly a twist which has more than the simple surprise of us getting the deceit while watching the film. I hope Eastwood lives on to make a dozen new films, but this film has the flavour of a quiet conversation between a filmmaker and his audience, like the late Kurosawa's or Welles, although Eastwood is pretty far from the magnitude of what those 2 achieved. But Clint's career sure is a vintage car, worth being driven and seen. It's not about performance, it's about commitment.My opinion: 4/5 http://www.7eyes.wordpress.com",Null,0,4,18 June 2010
Ex Machina," Rachael is a grown up now.
","Sci-fi is a fertile land for narrative experimentation. Where normally a viewer tries to relate to a certain world that he reads as 'real', in sci-fi driven stories, the extra-level of abstraction (it's a fiction and reads as such) makes the viewer focus on the abstractions of the narrative layers.That is, of course, if those layers are well set up, and that demands a good writer, and a good director.Apparently we have both in Alex Garland. I had never paid special attention to his previous work (as a writer) but i will look it up, and check again. Here he gives an interesting essay on narrative, and the relation between viewer and screen. He draws on what has been done before in sci-fi, but he throws in an interesting package.He builds the story as a set of relations between 3 characters (plus Kyoko) who observe each other and ultimately try to control and bend the narrative. Behind the fourth wall we observe them all and everything, or so we think. You can thus look at this one as a variation on 2001, with 3 players each trying to control and bend the course of the narrative.Or you can look at it as a variation on Dick's electric sheep. In that case Nathan plays Tyrell, Caleb is Deckard and Ava is, of course, Rachael. Nathan is the God who ultimately looses control of his creation, Caleb tests the creation in order to find its flaws, and Ava is the creation, around whom the plot develops.If you look at it from the 2001 point of view, you'll be, i think, disappointed. There is no Monolith at the beginning to lead you through the game, and the ending is certainly many galaxies away from the ambiguity that Kubrick left us to deal with until today.**spoilers here**But if you check it with the Blade Runner glasses, than things become interesting. He twists the character from Caleb, not by making him a replicant, but by revealing his character as a pawn manipulated by Nathan. He rebels against this domination, and makes a move, joining forces with the apparently underwhelmed Ava. In a somehow predictable twist she outplays him, aided by Kyoko, the other 'replicant'. So the plot revolves around the 2 human characters, who are the whole time both overplayed by the artificially intelligent one.I was a bit disappointed with the ending. It's clumsy and not powerful when compared to the rest. If it had worked, this would have another effect. But i did enjoy the cinematic frame that Garland used: architecture. The house, ostensibly defined as an isolated world, technology in the middle of nature, cut out from the whole world, So we know there are no external interference in the game our characters play. The building is interesting, as it is its framing. It's not groundbreaking, nor is it deep as what you find in Welles or Kalatozov. If it were, oh this might have been something else...Sonoya Mizuno has an incredible presence. Her face is amazing, and i wish they could have used her character as something more than a tool for Ava to use in her escape plan.",Null,0,1,26 September 2016
Back to the Future Part III," dry powder
","This is an unnecessary film. It carries a dose of nostalgia and emotions for fans of the previous back to the future films, in which i include myself, but that's its only edge. You'd need to know and relate to the characters from the other films in other to mildly appreciate this one, and that is not a very good sign.Zemeckis/Gale are not genius, or masters of their craft. They started in the shadow of Spielberg fantasy business. But the first two Bttf were novel in the pace they gave to their comedy development. It's how everything juxtaposes that the fun lies. The second film does something even better, and unseen, which is to literally place a film over another. That was great, and the best narrative achievement these guys did.This one brings nothing new or interesting. Yes we still have the energy and amazing vitality of Michael J. Fox and Chris Lloyd, and, even due to more shared screen time, they probably pair better here than on the previous two. But there is no catch, the related characters (Biff, the McFlys) are just direct mirrors to the future ones. The edge is gone. They probably had studio pressure to do this, but they knew they didn't have much more to say. And the prove is that i've recently re seen the trilogy and this one is old and worn out and not funny anymore, unlike the other two.My opinion: 2/5 http://www.7eyes.wordpress.com",Null,0,1,4 November 2008
The Curious Case of Benjamin Button," back in time
","David Fincher is a worthy mind. From previous adventures i knew he cares about form, about the shape of his films, about creating a structure, coherent with the intended narrative. With Seven, Fight Club and Zodiac, i felt that structure existed before the narrative line was leaked into it. That is his playground, and it is interesting because there is more to his films than the structure which support them. So we have visual ideas, that convey emotional intentions.Here he tries something new. Well, he still is worried about making a solid structure in which to insert the story. In fact this is his longest form, not so much for the time the film lasts, but for the kind of development in takes. A film that follows a lifetime has to be one of the most difficult things to do in cinema. Why is that? Because that kind of story is totally rooted in literature, not in cinema. It's hard to compress one's emotional evolution over a lifetime into images. Literature has the ability to create instant channels to one's mind. You try to do that in film, and it's usually a disaster. That's why it's so hard to find good films that convey biographies (the so called biopic).Having said this, i think this film is successful because it deals with the disadvantages i referred above. It deals with avoiding the predictabilities, the laziness and consequent failure of placing words as the subtitles for uninteresting images. It's not a perfect film and there is yet to come (or at least i haven't seen) a film that depicts one's lifetime and changes my life.Here there is one beautiful concept that makes it for me. This is a love story, all right. But it deals with time and space as adversities for the lovers to meet. It's a matter of two people who have to fight to find their own common space, the conditions to be together, whether fighting against war or social prejudice (the Titanic model). But, much more interesting, fighting for the right time. The opposite life lines (one getting older, the other getting younger) allow this. For a few years, for a certain period in time, the lovers are allowed to share their love. What a beautiful idea, that a couple has to live in proximity without touching, knowing all the way that they are seeing the love of their lives and yet they have to wait for the right time to come, and than having the courage to separate again. That's the heart breaking idea that moves this Benjamin Button. Fincher had never made such a film, so based on conveying emotions, a film built with a clear structure which we can discard because what matters is what's inside it. In his other films, structure and content were one.This is a love story, remarkable, sensitive tail, that shows in an anti-romantic time. Maybe that's why it grasps the sympathy of the audience so much. Winds of change? Reversed time? My opinion: 3/5http://www.7eyes.wordpress.com",Null,0,2,25 February 2009
Men in Black II," no roots
","Well, some things were fixed here. The filmmakers understood the huge wholes of the first one. Despite that one was celebrated (right now it's more highly rated in IMDb than this one).Among other things, what improved here was the attachment we feel to the alien world. There are more situations that makes us mildly care for what the mib are after. The aliens enter the action, and sometimes that's funny, the talking dog has moments, and so do the worms.Also, the partnership Smith-Jones is much more effective here. That's because here they create the gags together, whereas in the first one the production relied totally on Will Smith to deliver it while Tommy Lee was in the back to state how Smith is funny even in the world of the film.But above all, one thing takes this one to other dimension: Lara Flynn Boyle's character, efficiently supported by her. That's bringing sex to the equation. The first one depicted a totally undeveloped and uninteresting bad guy (the one performed by d'Onofrio). Here that totally supporting part is really supporting, and made by Knoxville two-headed character. The center is occupied by Boyle, and her presence affects everything, she spreads roots as the ones her character master. She was a good cast, and makes it mildly work; she has screen presence and knows how to pose to make it work.Is this enough for a film to be good? Has the word 'entertainment' narrowed in the cinema industry that it's possible for the mentors of projects like this to get away with it? Think that despite being 'classics' today, films like 'City Lights' were actually entertainment upon their release. No film could match that one in its specific corner, but see how attitudes towards cinematic creation changed? My opinion: 3/5 http://www.7eyes.wordpress.com",Null,0,0,31 October 2008
Children of Men," Referencial cinema
","This is one of the most engaging experiences i had in film world lately. Cuarón is already responsible for some strong creations, including 'Y tu mama también' or the best Harry Potter feature, to my view, which was the third one (Azkaban). Nevertheless this is, to my view, his most successful accomplishment to this point. That had to do, as far as i know, with knowing the masters, the guide lights in the visual world of cinema, i mean really knowing what was the strength in their movies (more than copying the style like, say, Tarantino often does to his 'references') and using that knowledge in a personal project.I am not such an expert in the world of films, but for what i do know, i got to 'see' four masters here. So, back to the basics: . start with Hitchcock. In his wide-known book-interview with Truffaut, Hitch praised above all the capacity for his movies to engage the audiences; in order to do that he always played with elements of the story, surprises, turn-backs, unpredictable happenings, etc. and more important, he placed his vision in filming the scenes in a way that made them fascinatingly engaging: Watch Psycho and you'll see the death of our Julianne Moore coming at this one which is to say, much sooner than one would expect even more when we have a 'star' which was 'supposed' to live until the end (or close). Watch Hitch's films especially from the 'rope phase', 'dial m...' 'rear window', and you'll find where Cuarón got much of the ideas for much of the shots, including the final idea for a 'one shot sequence', or at least, it strikes you as that.. than we have Welles. This one, in Cuarón's vision, completes the structure he got from Hitchcock. Watch Welles's work when he is more clearly aims at exploring space, finding reasons to move the camera, go around the set, unknown places, in and out, etc. In other words, watch 'Touch of Evil' where his reflexions on cinematic space exploration come more vivid than ever. Compare the longest shots in that project (the first sequence, and the last ones, bridge persecution, etc), and than come to this again, watch the final very long sequence, inside the prisoners camp, and observe how brilliantly Cuarón understands the possibilities Welles opened, and how well he explores those possibilities.Than we have the reflexion portions. Cuarón gets more clumsy here, and shows a smaller perception of the masters he seeks. But it still is worth watching, and i personally understand the fact that he 'rushes' things where his references would have taken longer for matters of general coherence, and pace. So here we have: . Tarkovsky, who could as no one in film-history, place the idea of memory in front of his camera. All his work is a big, beautiful, delightful, almost orgasmic reflexion on meditation. Cuarón doesn't get halfway through in getting to Tarkovsky in deepness and meaning (visually speaking) but there is one shot which is worth attention, the one in which the camera explores an old abandoned school and we get to here the jingle from an old rusty swinging toy where our pregnant miracle mother thinks about her life, and represents at the same time the memory she never lived in, but in which Owen's character lived good (and happy) portions of his life; . Leone/Morricone: the musical vocal theme is here for the same reasons the main theme from 'once upon a time in the west' is there and that is to provide the audience with the same emotion and inner feelings the characters are supposed to be feeling in that moment. Leone was a genius, an absolute master in getting this effect, and his collaboration with Morricone probably has lots to do with this. Anyway, Cuarón understands Leone; so check the moments in which this theme shows up, after reviewing 'once upon a time...' and you'll understand.The power of this film is that you are able to enjoy it as a piece on its own, and still, afterwards (and during it) identify the references. I admire people who can dignify the masters they admire. Watch this.Trivia: Oh and i couldn't stop noticing. One more use in cinema of the Battersea Power Station, London. This case has two particular aspects: . It is used as an Art Ark, place for gathering works of art that survive the chaos. We see one of them through the window while Owen's character is inside and that is the flying pig from Pink Floyd's animals, which was at the cover of that album exactly in that position. Animals was loosely based in Orwell's work Animal Farm. Orwell also wrote 1984, which, when adapted to cinema, was partly shot in the same Battersea station. 1984 described a world of oppression, hopeless future, partly close to this one (oh and when Owen gets in that ark the space is in fact Tate Modern, reconstruction of another factory by the same architect of Battersea) . The other aspect is that in a street shot we get as soundtrack King Crimsons famous progressive song. This is a band from that 70's period, of which Pink FLyod came out the most famous and successful. This is, to my view, interesting triviaMy evaluation: 4/5http://www.7eyes.wordpress.com",Null,1,9,13 September 2007
The Nightmare Before Christmas," Danny Claus
","I really appreciated the effort made to produce such a film as this one. This is remarkable, a film made in a moment of change, when digital mediums start to invade the animation (and not only animation). So in a way, this is a kind of a milestone, and the end of a decade. It's probably the biggest effort (and money) put into producing a stop-motion animation. It's world class work, the characters have levels of expression which probably are close to its limits in a kind of animation like this one (if you check the making of you'll see the number of heads with different expressions for each character).But what make this a rather unique and superior experience is the presence Burton and Elfman, a common mixture, but which here has a special flavour, maybe because Burton is 'only' in the production. The visual mood is, of course, Burton's, but here i felt a little bit more freedom by Elfman to work freely with the music. He's one the best current film composer's, because he can carry the movie through the songs, which last long after the film is finished. So he leads the moves here (he even sings the lead voice), and in the way he creates a soundtrack which dominates the movie, unlike what happens in films directed by Burton (including his musicals).Visually, my only complaint is in the lack of contrast between the Halloween world and that of Christmas, could have been more marked. Except for that it's delicious, probably less gore than what Burton probably would have done if was fully in control of the operations.This is top class work, and once more the writer Tim Burton takes a relatively common Christmas theme (the being who tries to destroy it) and switches something on that common subject and creates a new mood out of it, familiar, yet novel (the pumpkin king who tries to improve Christmas and in the way ends up almost ruining it).The Oogie Boogie musical acts are memorable.My opinion: 4/5 worth watching http://www.7eyes.wordpress.com",Null,0,0,2 October 2008
Star Wars: Episode VIII - The Last Jedi," the last stage, according to Joseph Campbell
","This is a mess, born in a messy time, i suppose.A lot is already being written about how much failed in terms of keeping the internal coherence of the franchise, the interest in the old characters, and what is perceived as the 'depth' of the story. I'd like to comment on two things:Every Star Wars film is one of the most important films ever. It doesn't mean it's a good or a bad film. But so many people all invest time and passion into the thing, that whatever comes out is influential. The first film (ep.IV) was completed extended backwards and beyond, the universe drilled, explored, (i)matured. It has become sort of a cycle of stories that live in the collective consciousness of the society, as reflected by its pop culture. Of the 9 films so far (counting Rogue One), I personally don't think there's more than 2 that actually matter as cinema, and probably none has the ability to change how you think visually (how you dream?), but they do reflect how society sees itself, their collective urges and voids. So this disaster of a film does it: broken pieces of narrative, of broken souls looking for hope, and never being able to find it, running away from the dark side while always being caught up with. Old idols, burnt and wasted, failing to fulfil their last step in the story.Myth and Irony. Here are some thoughts. I believe that irony destroys myth, at least the kind of marvel hero irony that has invaded films since Iron Man. That's the cheapest kind of irony, the one used in this film. Myth is a powerful depictions of abstraction, Urges and Voids represented through Story-telling. Irony is, in myth, the ultimate boon, the mirror placed in front of our eyes. Myth, as synthesized by Campbell (using a Jungian lens), formed the basis of the whole thing, at the beginning. That thing about force that surrounds us and penetrates us. The hero completing epic cycles. The franchise made the story more complex, and intersected several cycles, several circles. Yoda, Obi-wan, Anakin, Luke, Kilo, Rey... This new trilogy was to be the last stages of Luke's cycle, the returning of the hero, passing what he has learned. The previous film replaced the environment at the heart of that, because they used the guy who wrote the best Star Wars film. But here they gave writing and directing (!) to someone who has no clue. So the cycles are only superficially shown, mechanically, kind of 'painting by numbers', and the irony is displaced to the dialogues, inner jokes, winks at the older films. So this is basically television with an infinite budget. Everybody knows it, i think. We know even Hamill is not so happy with what was done to Luke. We know this director only landed on the job because Kennedy fought with every other possibility. We know JJ Abrams will direct the next one, but apparently Kasdan won't write it. Who will take the boon now? Who will pass on knowledge? Who will teach new kids with the potencial to become Jedis? I really think they should burn this temple and see what grows under it. But this is Disney, so the dark side has already won.",Null,0,0,15 December 2017
Brave," red past
","When you are a child, you seldom choose the films you watch. In a normal free world environment, a child will probably fall victim to the laws of the moment, to whatever is on. Of course over that there is the influence the educators may have on you, but that will profoundly vary from child to child, and every child will still see and contact the trends of his moment. I was lucky enough, i suppose, to be partly fed by Pixar as i grew up. The Toy Story thing was a part of my upbringing. Later when i started watching films seriously, and specially when i started mapping my living in the space (as an architectural student), i understood the importance of the cinematic stakes that Pixar was playing all along. The space, the movement the camera.Well, that seems to be suspended, at least for the moment. PIxar is now Disney, and that shows. The themes are aligned with what Disney knows that sells, and that contrives the whole creative process that used to be groundbreaking for each Pixar project.The space narrative is abandoned, and i can understand that specially in this film, because the space had potential. We had the castle, we had the highlands. Outside and inside, and infinite possibilities. But the framing, the movement of the camera, the quality of the cinematic space, all that is gone, sacrificed so that we can have the repented child trying to mend the wrong she has made to her mother, trying to put the world to the happy end that Disney requires to keep their ticket buyers tuned in, satisfied, and with the sense that they took their children to see a film with a 'moral', with something to think about.Everything creative seems to have been invested in the main character, the girl, who Is interesting. She lives on her hair, and the scene where she receives the claimants to her hand is remarkable in how much of the character is gone by the covering of her hair. The slipping hank is a wink, i suppose.That redness, and the expression of the character through it may be the one redeeming feature of this film. But i feel deceived, i feel that a person i used to visit since i was a child is no longer there to give wisdom. Well, let's hope for better chapters.My opinion: 2/5http://www.7eyes.wordpress.com",Null,1,2,10 March 2013
The Dark Knight," what it is, and what i dreamed of
","Strange, curious, and interesting thing that happened to me here. Well, i was a bit disappointed with the film. Not that it is a bad film. It is a solid work, and a good ride with someone who has some interesting things to say in narrative construction.Basically: Joker is a pivot to a complex narration device, where everybody, bad guys, or good guys, is completely clueless about what will happen with them or in Gotham. The Joker plays the game, he is the central key to this plot. He defines the rules, and the rules are incidental even in his thinking, he acts randomly, kills by chance. Chaos through unpredictability. It's great. Everybody has the job to survive, except to characters: Batman, who follows Joker and tries to 'unmask' the plan (without unmasking himself), and Dent, who tries directly to attack Joker, also to unmask him, but in a more direct, straightforward, 'honest' way. That's why he is looked upon as the true hero of Gotham, even by the Batman. That's why he is turned over and twisted to become the 'good' enemy. It's a game of oppositions, clear sides, the two faces of everybody. The unfolding of the game is, of course, when Joker looses guidance over the unguided destinies of the facts.So this is actually phenomenal cinematic story-telling. It's not visual, it doesn't even attempt at being fully visual as, for example, 'Batman Begins' tried (and partially achieved), but it's a great structure in the line of recent works like the life-altering 'Oldboy'.What made me disappointed was the high expectations made by an unbelievable #4th place in IMDb top 250, and the smashing positive reviews by almost everybody i read. OK, i should have seen it coming, the reason for this was the effect of Ledger's premature death. He really shows skill and true talent here, and his character is involved in an aura of darkness that exists because Ledger deals with the contradictions of this character, the constant smile versus the darkness of spirit. He is conscious about his own acting, so he 'laughs' at his character, and his role. It's very hard to do that, at least rare to watch. So everything in this film is solid. But it isn't ambitious enough to make me dream beyond certain horizons which, in my view, stay way below the '4th best film ever'.So, i have to place reviews and general opinions into perspective. If i had seen this in the theatre when it came out, before the avalanche of empowering reviews around Ledger's performance, i might have taken it for what it is. Like this, i was unfairly disappointed with this powerful film.My opinion: 4/5 http://www.7eyes.wordpress.com",Null,2,4,1 January 2009
Blood Diamond," Opening the window
","I think this is worth watching because something new happened here. Not related to film-making, storytelling or any of those cinematic issues, but because of light and capturing Africa, something the manuals call photography.Cinematography:. I'm trying to get to as much of the work of Eduardo Serra as i can. I do believe we are in the presence of one of the most competent and surprising cinematographer's of current times. And here he exceeded my expectations, for a film vastly filmed in Africa: the continent always represented a challenge for artists, above all for the matters of light, color and landscape, unique there. In cinema concerns, 'Out of Africa' was a bold approach, but in the end very 'washed out' and empty of emotion. Riefenstahl, herself a master in film debated herself with this fascination in part of her photographer work. None of these or other work was able to become, to my point of view, interesting enough, comparing to what Africa can offer. Recently, 'the constant gardener' raised the challenge and got closer, but it went too much over top (the cinematographer was south American, he mixed the two continents, i supposed). In the end it sounds pretty much fake. Every cinema photography is by definition fake, but it should strike you as genuine.Serra is Portuguese. Portugal was all over Africa and South America at certain points of history and in the first case until very recently. Maybe that would give a Portuguese cinematographer the balance and distance he needs. Recently, in an interview, Serra was asked, regarding 'Girl with a Pearl Earring', how could he have got that light, so natural, so genuine. He simply answered: 'i opened the window.' That's what he made here. He understood the light in Africa, and put all the artificial means he had to bring that light, as untouched as possible, to cinema. So, the merit of this film is, in this sense, to have opened the window to Africa. It's not perfect, but it's the best we have, to this point. Until something better comes out, this is Africa.My evaluation: 4/5 - just photography (and Conelly, great presence, fills her scenes and in addition is beautiful), for all the rest this is a common, even vulgar experience in mass cinema, not worth more than 2 in my scale. If you want something more clever, by someone who cares about film-making, camera-work and storytelling issues, watch 'the constant gardener'.P.S. This one is inserted in the recent tendency for commercial movies to look at humanitarian issues, using entertainment as a channel for 'serious things'. I think that's worth of applause only to the point when this becomes another capitalism global product. this 'bono voxization' of humanitarian issues may kill the hole principle of the thing.",7,3,4,20 February 2007
Men in Black," Forgettable style
","This is an empty film. 11 years is not that much time, but it seems ages on this film. Looking at it now, makes me understand it has nothing inside.This is yet another film that develops around a certain idea of style. If you start counting them, it's incredible the amount of films made on that basis. Well, it's huge but understandable: style is something appealing for the crowds in the moment the film is released (though it gets easily dated) and something that doesn't require much skill to bring out. Just the right guy, in this case Will Smith who represents the top of coolness for a certain percentage of the population.The Guggenheim Museum was apparently a good choice, but misused. I wanted to see what they'd make of it, but in after all they just wanted to use the long ramp to show how Will Smith was able to run fast to the top of the building.If you see the extras on the DVD, check how Barry Sonnenfeld sounds like a nitwit. Completely clueless about what his job is about. He just remarks technical curiosity, he has nothing to say.My opinion: 1/5 http://www.7eyes.wordpress.com",Null,2,4,29 October 2008
Avatar," expectations
","Milestones in cinema can be fabricated products, tailored by huge, complex, and wide spread corporations, fighting for gaining attentions, and selling a product. So, now we have this Avatar, which has been announced as the next big thing, for several months, years perhaps. On those matters alone, that means this is a fabricated groundbreaking product, it is not Citizen Kane, nor even Jazz Singer. It probably is more of a Gone with the Wind.But there is a film here. And it matters to watch it, beyond the package of marketing and brainless mass opposed opinions.There are several evident strong things here. One is how Cameron outdid Zemeckis in achieving a certain realism that grows out of real people, abstracted into animation, only to be delivered to us again as realistic animated characters. That game Zemeckis played on Polar Express. This film tops what has been done so far. I don't know whether this business of emulating reality through purely digital medium will have an interesting future, how much is there to explore with interest? But this is our high point so far.Another thing is how this film cements what Peter Jackson had done with King Kong, and several action features have worked since: action films are spatial pieces nowadays. That is already and will become more a common place. It will look dated and wobbly any grand scale action/epic/war(?) film which won't consider space occupation. That is where the 3d will take its place. On my few remarks on 3d cinema, i noted how its biggest possibilities are precisely in how the 3d enhances and creates the space, physical space, built with distances, where the action will happen. So, Pandora, the forest, is built to be spatially explored. Right from the beginning, on the waterfall, the battle to destroy the big tree, and pretty much all the action that takes place there. 3d is an interesting addition to what a concerned mind (or a group of minds) can do. I hope it becomes a usable tool for the beautiful author minds we have around the world (i wish Welles was here to use it).Risks where brought down to a very minimum here. The story is just as cliché, recognizable, and thus acceptable as it could be without being shouting unbearable. Well, again it follows a Selznick logic of marketing products which are like what has been done and accepted by the audience, only bigger and better sold.But surrounding this thin good-evil story, there are pieces of reflexivity, self aware or unintended, which make the process of post-reflection over the film delicious. The more visible one, and assumed, is how the film is to us as the avatar is to its owner. We dig into the reality of the film as the 3 avatar users dig into the reality of Pandora. Fake bodies, inner realities, as if moving down each level was the equivalent of climbing up the big tree. One intended thing is when we consider the commentary in the film (social, ecological, moral) against the contradictions the film itself displays. It turns the wheel of bad guy good guy. At last, it assumes the 'american general' as the sadist destruction oriented bad guy, perpetrating the same kind of terrorist crimes he was once commissioned to pursue. But than, the tools the film uses to achieve the desired happy ending, which respects the 'alternative' of the native culture are exactly the tools the overthrown terrorists were using. The film itself is a story of good-evil, not a vessel for layered knowledge, like a tree of souls which uploads the lives of every past human being.take it for the visual experience. It's not groundbreaking but it is the current status of the best tools we have these days, to explore the emerging worlds of digital animation and 3d cinema. Enjoy the self reference if you appreciate it, but don't be driven away by the useless safe options.My opinion: 3/5http://www.7eyes.wordpress.com",Null,1,3,30 December 2009
Victory," boring dance
","This film mixes sports with ideology, meaning that the game (football in this case) stands for moral and human issues. The one who wins the game, proves the righteousness of his attitudes. Nazis against the allies, the Nazis cheat. Apart from some ambiguity in von Sydow's character, there are no concessions to the evilness of the Nazis. They is no possibility for redemption among them, no worthy character. So, for the way it handles the public's perspective of nazi Germany (not the top hierarchies but the others) this moves nothing forward when compared to, say, Casablanca. It's a matter of pride winning over evilness, justice prevailing over cheating.The film starts with the scheduling of a football game, and ends with that game, so the whole film is a preparation for it. The game is a staged event, it takes place in Paris so we can have the audience supporting the 'right' side. In terms of drama, this has the same effect as if the event would have been a theatre performance, or a public speech (it's as if the final allie victory in the game was the equivalent to Chaplin's speech in Great Dictator). So why does this fail where both Casablanca and The Great Dictator worked? Well, simply because this is made in 1981, the war is long over, the Soviet regime was living its final true years, and the context is totally different. It no longer mattered to have desperate declarations of honour against a by than historical regime. I don't think ww2 related films is a dead theme, we still get them today, renewed and fresh. But this is a straightforward simplistic approach that was only justifiable during the war, when the nazi horror was still being perpetrated. This one, where it stands and how it is shaped is as simplistic and ordinary as a propaganda film.The film depicts football. I think football is as hard to film as dancing. But football has been less used, so we have (even) less interesting solutions to film it. The thing is, both dancing and football implied movement, the most graceful football players are themselves dancers, entangling the ball, the direct opponent, and the general situation in the field. To capture this movement interestingly you have to rely on a certain fluidity of the camera. It can be done two ways: -still framing, where the player's movement has to be worth the shot (safe and boring option); -the camera plays with the player, and the other elements, and thus enters the 'dance'. Frankly, i've never seen the second option done well. This film misses an incredible opportunity to try it. That's because it casts one of the more graceful players ever. Someone who danced like no one before or since, not as fluid as Maradona (or Messi), but eventually more thrilling in the 'one on one' moments. He does some nice tricks for the camera, but none is properly used by the camera, and they are lost in the general boredom of the film. I wish this would be properly done some day.This would be only a minor disappointment, but the thing is this film was directed by someone who used to think about cinema, besides merely directing. Huston made important things. But than again, his insight was on the narrative side, in how the story is shaped, and how it is told. Also, it is reported that by the end of his career he was sometimes only a worker collecting the pay check. Pity.My opinion: 2/5 http://www.7eyes.wordpress.com",Null,1,2,12 September 2009
The Artist," the smile
","We've seen things like this before, haven't we? Films that are not about films, but instead a love letter to other films. I'm not nearly as fascinated about such incursions as i am for anything really new that comes out. As far as i know, the most fascinating referenced cinema is the one that captures the lessons of great previous films, and extends its notions a little bit. Or break them. You have people, like the Coens or de Palma, who made a career twisting the ideas of people before them. If we talk about silent films, than Guy Maddin is someone who really picked up what we stopped caring about with The Jazz singer, and twisted every notion to create something new. That's the kind of reference that i'm looking at with passion.This one enters the Cinema Paradiso drawer: expansive genuine passion for a certain type or moment of cinema history, poured into a vessel of nostalgia. You will understand these films if you understand that nostalgia, not necessarily the films that it addresses. Unashamed sweetness tops these attitude. You decide to play in that world or not. I've entered it several times. But i don't stay there more than a few moments without feeling that i'm bypassing something really important, in other films being made.That said, this one is a pretty good homage, in that flat sense. Some elements work amazingly well here, and one is even interesting from a cinematic point of view:the one thing that works incredibly well is the main male actor: Whoever chose him understood his potential, he understood what it took for a silent actor to live on screen, and the director definitely understood his face, every angle of it. He smiles in a way that i've seen very few times. That smile carries the film, when he doesn't smile, we easily enter the depressive mood of the character represented by the absence of its actor's smile. Actors representing actors is something always interesting. To do it pretty much with a smile alone, makes him worthy of the Oscar. By the way, he is always an actor on the film. When he is acting for the silent films in the film, he has a similarly camera aware attitude as when he is in the real world of the film.The narrative unfolds around and is finished with films, of course. That's why our on screen lovers get together making a film, and his love for her is reaffirmed by the scenes of another film they made together. It's the necessary self-reference, required for films like this to work.And there is one remarkable scene. The 'sound' dream. Our silent character dreams the world gains sound, objects, everything starts to produce sounds, except his own voice. This is remarkable because nothing is explained, everything is in the eye. The mere editing of simple sounds in an other than that silent scene makes us understand the drama of this character on verge of extinction. That was a cinematic moment.My opinion: 4/5",Null,0,1,23 March 2012
La La Land," Marsalis, not Miles
","Once in a while this happens: a film that does everything well enough to avoid major criticism. The perfect blockbuster according to the book of David O.Selznick. A few things are required:-a pair of lovable and bankable stars (girl and boy) that have the sympathy of a majority of the film-goers, even some people who don't go so often to films but recognize them as stars. They have to be given roles that fit their mold, where they can act as lovable as everyone expect them to be;-give the film a story-line as easy to follow as possible, a simple romance that holds all the plot points that will make it look as something big and breath-taking. Aquaitance, fall in love, crisis, redemption...-put that story-line in the context of a bigger theme and twist it in a way that will ultimately prevent the lovers from the desired happy- end. This is melodrama, where the bigger context affects the smaller lives (war in Gone with the wind; religious prejudice and politics in Ben-Hur; the shipwreck in Titanic...). In this case we have Hollywood and a simple dynamic of love vs the pursuit of dreams;-produce the whole thing as lush as you can and as likable as the pair of stars: colorful saturated photography, songs everyone can easily hum, dance numbers that tap into the memory of older loved musicals. Competent and safe craftsmanship.-Sell the whole thing, invest as much or more selling the thing as in producing it.The self-reference here is obvious and falls along two lines, both equally safe and obvious:-the movie is set in movieland, she even serves coffee in a movie studio. it works the most ostensibly artificial film genre of them all, and in the way makes obvious and safe quotes of classical musicals (plus the Rebel even more obvious bits). Among those quotes is one where they walk through the 4th wall and we get to see the whole film crew, equipment, lights, etc.-the jazz bits. Our boy is a conservative jazz fan, the bop guy who thinks Miles's fusion is rock or pop, or whatever. So are the people behind this film, or so they show themselves to be. This film is supposed to stand for the 'new films' as old jazz stands for 'new jazz': genuine and 'true' by comparison.The by now very celebrated ending, with the alternative version where the two lovers stay together is the ultimate safety device employed. They sink the ship, and kill Jack, but just think that maybe the viewers will be put away and so they relive an alternative version of the last third of the movie and film in a few minutes, crammed with music and narrative information, the script draft that was thrown in the garbage for the sake of the 'tragic' element of grand love themed blockbuster.If you want a film that is well crafted escapism while seeming more than that, this is it. This is being canonized by Hollywood, and for years to come you will hear bits of the music in academy awards ceremonies and see it in lists of best of, etc. But if you want adventure, if you want risk, than this is the total opposite. It's obscenely safe, and ultimately pointless. This is the cinematic version of Marsalis, sailing competently and expertly through the Seas that others have charted long ago, kind of a cinematic version of a tribute band. I think I'm going to hear a Miles record after writing this.PS – this rather conservative effort is, as I write, ranked 57th on the top250 list in IMDb! At the same time Trump is sitting in the White House. Birdman is now past, its adventure over. In a few decades America (and the world by default) will observe this, and maybe process how mainstream poor/conservative storytelling habits correlates to political manipulation of the masses.",Null,1,4,20 February 2017
Up," break the screen
","I had some expectations regarding this one. I didn't sense it would be as meditative as Wall.E, but i look forward to see what Pixar does. They are leading the sport of digital animation, and nearly all of their films have pushed something (or a lot) ahead, regarding the previous experience. Here, i wasn't expecting that the film, as a whole, would be as grasping as their past 2, but i really thought i might be positively surprised by the 3d. The set up pleased me: this was their first 3d film, and the basic plot seemed to announce the challenge they would take: a flying house, travelling a good portion of the globe, flying over cities, landing on a huge and deep waterfall. Already, by the description, it is spacial. Since we have had Ratatouille just 2 years ago, i thought and longed that the approach would be on the spacial exploration, enhanced by the possibilities of the 3d. Well, i was wrong. In the end this film is the flattest of all Pixar films of the last 6 years, even more than Nemo (which i thought had similar possibilities and failed in similar ways). 3D is merely an enhancement of flat scenes, mundane compositions, and camera work that wouldn't impress if the camera was real. I may have put my expectations out of focus, in relation to what the studio intended, but i really was expecting more on that side. I mean, in the theatre where i watched this, i saw a commercial, in 3D, of Vodafone, playing with that their spherical logo. At a certain moment, we got many spheres on screen, and the 3d made them 'get out' of the screen, and look like they were going to hit me. That 10 seconds bit was more of what i thought 3D can do than the whole film.Well, other things are appealing, the introducing short film is, as usual, quite meaningful, in this case having to do with the act of creation, as a synonym for giving birth. We have clouds, who create, and storks, who deliver. One specific cloud molds what none other does, always dangerous beings, and the stork suffers in the way. Interpret it your own way, but i found it significant if you consider artists (creators) and the relation with an audience and the answer to the publics expectations.The film is visually beautiful, not texture in the sublime fashion of Wall.E, but quite adventurous in how it uses colours. I still think Dreamworks is some steps ahead in face modelling, but these characters are more and more alive.I think you'll find it funny, if that's what you want. I miss some wittiness of other films.My opinion: 3/5 http://www.7eyes.wordpress.com",Null,0,1,23 August 2009
Snowden," narrative wars
","Our lives are sustained by narratives, in which we believe, versions of the facts in which we trust. Most of that we acquire through upbringing, social environment, education. Where you are born (country) determines a great deal of what you are likely to believe in throughout your life.What Snowden did was not so much shocking in terms of the revelations themselves: the idea that the American government spies on us, all over the world, no matter where. I believe every regime always uses everything in their power to monitor their faithful subjects. We are all American subjects right now in a way or another. So if, say, the Roman Empire or the Nazis had that kind of technology and ruled over a world where pretty much everybody carries a Geo-located device with camera and mic in their pocket, they certainly would have made use of that. What Snowden did is important not because of what he reveals, but because he did reveal it and proved it. He defeated an accepted and implemented narrative - that that the USA government is always 'the good guy', and uses its infinite powers only for good and just causes; has a constitution which is as sacred as the Bible and which prevails above everything else, and so on. That Snowden was able to flip that story inside out with all the personal risks within is remarkable. He revealed the American superficial narrative to be mainly false, as the American government exercises all kinds of brutalities that equal and exceed those of the oppressive regimes in countries they claim to liberate. Along comes Oliver Stone, and does his take of the known facts. We can see the self-reference at the beginning: Snowden starts as a young typical conservative, willing to 'serve the country', going to war for it. This mirrors Stone, the Vietnam veteran, who willingly enlisted to 'protect' whatever lies somebody was feeding America with at the time. As the story progresses, Snowden questions the ends, and the means to them. So did Stone. In the end Snowden comes out as a kind of an also typical American hero, who risks everything, his life included, to 'do the right thing'.He maps the Snowden story onto the 1984 metaphor, thus the 'O'Brien' character, which is obvious but adequate. Along the way he drops a few hints (intended or not) that he himself is driven by internal affairs concerns, and not so much by a general sense of justice: there is a scene in the NSA headquarters in Hawaii where Snowden shows his colleagues a world map and all the emails intercepted in every country. Apparently there was no special concern that, for example, individuals from Germany or Brazil are being illegally spied, only that Americans are At least he aptly edits real clips of real people (Obama included) telling their own narrative, proved a lie when layered over the Snowden story we're being told.The difference between this narrative and others that Stone has already explored (Vietnam, Nixon, JFK) is that this one is still going on, we don't know what will be of Snowden, and what real impact his leaking will really have. I hope it will be huge, but I doubt it. We know how the American establishment reacted to them, how they, again, flipped the narrative: it's really not that huge that it was revealed that the NSA spies on individual unsuspected citizens, Americans or not: Snowden is a villain because he threatened 'American security' and that's much more important than any minor constitution related incidents. Apparently this version stuck, as we are a month away of having either Clinton or Trump sitting on the receiver side of the NSA bug So the 'security threat' story is probably accepted by most Americans as true.I think there is nothing ordinary about Snowden and what he did and because of that it struck me as a moderate insult that Stone would have him as a pretty standard American hero, the kind of stock character that has been feeding American mythology for decades and keeping the people (not only Americans) from looking under the rug, which is precisely what Snowden had us doing with his leaking. I mostly don't share many of Stone's political believes, but I've always respected his integrity, and sincere take on the important subjects he tackles. Check this film, it's honest. But base your narrative in more than one source. The breaking of the fiction, at the end, as the real Snowden speaks directly to us, is a good device to validate the narrative that we had so far been fed. Honesty.",Null,0,2,12 October 2016
How to Train Your Dragon," motion - under, above, through
","I've seen this film almost a month ago. I'm commenting on it now, as a preface to the viewing of Spielberg/Jackson's Tintin. I want to see that film, because I think Spielberg is a valuable filmmaker when he moves inside is native area, that of energetic electrifying adventure films, being 'adventure' a wide term. I want to see what's his word on motion capture, the concept he so willingly defends, and that his long time friend Zemeckis began to explore a few years ago. Watching films is, as many things in life, a matter of personal choices. You choose what you are looking for in a film. Animation is subject to those decisions as well. I made my choices. I go to animation because a virtual camera can do things that a real one can't so easily do. Of course we than watch Soy Cuba and this statement becomes pretty much useless. But that film is an alien.As an architect I care about space. Built space, integrated or not, but always built. In an animation, everything is built space. Even mountains and landscapes, the sea and the caves. It's all chosen and designed to appear as we see it. And it is built to look as it does depending on the also freely chosen framing, and movement of characters in the space. So, it's total freedom. Of course this is a several million dollar project, and it has to appeal to a certain crowd, so you hang the thing in a story, and this one is well put. But I don't come to films like this for the characters, although the black dragon does seduce me, as well as a number of other characters. This film is rich in its textures, and character construction, within the constraints of the genre. But I don't want to talk about that.The really good things here for me come from the motion scenes. In the sky, and in the cave. One uses fluid motion, following the path of the dragons or inventing a virtual path for the camera that dances with that of the dragons. In the cave, the camera use is more conventional, but the design of the space is intelligent. Pixar has made the biggest progress in recent years, but this has a specific vision of its own, maybe a consequence, or even an iteration of Avatar. Worth watching on those terms.My opinion: 3/5http://www.7eyes.wordpress.com",Null,0,0,27 October 2011
The Departed," Martin looking back to himself
","Scorcese went back to his past as a filmmaker. In his latest projects he had been exploring the possibilities of moving his camera around, in my view fundamentally in two directions: - exploring space, architecture, the surroundings; - provoking sensations, in this case attached to a character (or several) and transmitting those sensations to us, audience. In this case, i'm naturally speaking of 'Gangs of New York' and 'The Aviator'. The first one was more bold in this concerns, the second was more thought up, maybe more refined and multi layered (it introduced colors, the evolution of time and revived the character centered camera moments). I valued those projects because Scorcese took some risks and tried to make an evolution as a director. He didn't arrive at 'safe land' or real conclusions. But that is the meaning of experimenting. trying solutions.With this one, he put some of those experiments aside. That apparently, i mean. In this picture, Scorecese turns back to his character exploitation. It's all about characters. The actions moves along based on the character's mental state, fears. I talk, of course, about Damon and DiCaprio. Nicholson is no long the fear provoker of The shining, nor the sharp detective of Chinatown (and specially Two Jakes). He brought here some of the comedic kind of performance he developed in his last years lesser projects (this is a side note). So, the over layering of main characters allows Scorcese to make more complex his previously quite simple (and many times uninteresting) game of Goodfellas or Casino. It's a refreshing of his 'formula', based, i believe, on trying to extend to the way he ordinarily developed his characters the experimental attitude of his latest projects. I suppose this was to be a side project on his newest tendencies, but i hope the high success this one had doesn't make Martin give up the experiments he had been conducting... Anyway, to this point, The Departed follows the kind construction Scorcese masters the best: the character driven one.For every technical aspect, this is obviously nearly flawless; and i wanted to watch this without having watched the one which this remakes. I didn't want to base my comment on that other film.My evaluation: 4/5, nevertheless i hope Scorcese continues his last 5 years tendency, he may get somewhere new to his standards.http://www.7eyes.wordpress.com",7,1,2,8 July 2007
Die Hard with a Vengeance," lethal willis, with a help
","in the beginning there was Willis. He has qualities as an actor that don't match any 'action actor' before him. He talked to you, the viewer. Remember the first two die hard? he was complaining, cursing, all that alone. That wasn't a monologue, that was a dialogue, with the audience, with you. It was a dialogue because there was a response, the audience got in touch, the audience cared. So in that respect, i think no one has ever came any close to matching Willis' abilities, and we have some really messy attempts, Nicolas Cage would come first here. Anyway, there were films which attempted already the more direct approach of actor touching the audience, such as High Fidelity (Cusack) or Alfie (Law). Die Hard 1 was a trademark in acting for cinema for this matter alone. Together with that first film, we had the first Lethal Weapon. Another approach, another mark. This was more easy, because it didn't depend that much on the quality of the actor performing, but on the fun two actors could have acknowledging their differences and fighting them. Because it was easier, and because no one could make the things Willis did as well as he did them, this second formula came to be the most used one. And here we see this Die Hard trust on the idea that 2 is better than one. So we have Glover impersonated by Jackson, most of the 'fun' coming from him messing with McClane. Die Hard becomes Lethal Weapon, maybe because Willis wanted to try, but most probably because the producers thought it was 'saffer' this way.However, the plot saves some things. The bad guy is more clever than athletic, he controls, and the story is all about the good guy trying to catch up for the clever plan the bad guy has. The twists between revenge-robbery and the understanding of who's in control are well worked out, all and all, this comes to be a positive experience. It helps setting some standards for what today we expect from an action movie (that notion is right now being questioned by the super heroes flicks) but it's not influential or good as the first two die hard.My opinion: 3/5",Null,0,0,25 December 2007
The Wrestler," honesty
","This is a disappointing Aronofsky experience and a great Mickey Rourke performance.What we have is a film about a performer. Wrestling has all to do with physical acting abilities, as well as striptease. So Rourke and Tomei act performers. Actors who play actors, that's where we stand.About Rourke: his character mirrors his personal life, that's probably why he was cast, and certainly why he was so enthusiastic about it, as he himself admitted. A former star, someone who created lasting impressions on the minds of those who saw him in golden years, but who eventually becomes a burnt down star, performing low gigs, with a ruined personal life. This trivia is probably the key to the success of this performance. Mickey Rourke is not as sophisticated as an actor as other ones. Because he spend most of the 90's doing other stuff and living a late childhood, he didn't progress as an artist as other actors did. But in the meanwhile he probably lived sad and terrible facts in his life. So now we have this. The reason why we trust so much in his acting here is because it sound so sadly honest. Here he is guts and heart, he is as much committed to the job as the wrestler he performs, whose life is on the ring. Rourke has a straight forward mind - you only have to read his political commentary to get that - but so does the wrestler he performs. So, what we have here is perfect casting, and true commitment. Such honest acting should and must be enhanced, it is rare to watch. Watch the first scene after the meaningful condensed credits, with Rourke sitting alone in an empty room, in the backstage of a performance. It's a perfect synthesis of what this is all about.Now, this would make a simple film by some lesser director good enough. But this was directed by the man who gave us 'Pi' and 'Requiem for a Dream'. So it's not good enough. OK, it's a character study, the way the camera constantly and ostensibly follows Rourke's back shows it. This was to be a film about Rourke, and i even admire Aronofsky having erased himself to enhance Rourke. But on and on, there's not many things to admire here. So, as many times happens, it's not a matter of what Aronofsky does here, it's about what i know he could have done, because i saw his other films. Some wrestling scenes are good, because he denounces the fakery of the whole thing, and at the same time puts her inside the scenes, contributing for making it real for our eyes.My opinion: 3/5 for Rourke.http://www.7eyes.wordpress.com(FantasPorto 2009)",Null,0,2,25 February 2009
Kong: Skull Island," the river and the dinosaur
","I suppose this works as entertainment and it fails utterly as something more, although if you look a bit into it, you will see how this island is full with the bones of potential creative richness.The core concept was the overlapping of two ideas. You have Conrad's metaphor of going up the river, not directly through Conrad but with the Vietnam filter Coppola put on it (his interest was in turn triggered by an abandoned first project by Welles). And you have the obvious exotic lost paradise location full of dangerous otherworldly creatures, who exist in the cinematic world of Jurassic Park, not of the previous Kong films.The first concept was, i think, a creative choice. The second was a producers requirement. The rest of the film, with the required references, jokes, etc. follows these two guidelines and becomes literally a battle between these two visions, a battle obviously won by the producers vision. We are left with nothing at the end. But it's still fun to try and guess where and how the studio twisted the vision of the writers - not knowing any other work of this director, i don't know on which side he was. Anyway:-Sam Jackson plays Kurtz, but he channels his Jurassic Park mad performance;-the boat made of scraps from the crashed planes was the prop with more potential. It's visual, it's interesting, and could work in a Herzog way. Yet it is rendered to near uselessness, because Sam Jackson wants to blow up Kong instead of going down the river (get it?)-Marlow is merely supporting here. He has lived in the island for 28 years, but calls none of the shots (not even the mad ones). Eventually he leaves the tribe of natives, another nod to Conrad, and goes back to his former world;-Where they screwed this up the worst, in my opinion, was in how the Hiddleston/Larson characters were handled. He is named 'Conrad', but She is the photographer/reporter, the one designated writer/storyteller on screen. We even 'see' many of the photos she takes, get the world through her lenses. SHE should be Conrad, not him. But again the producer's vision prevails, and they needed a 'girl in distress to be saved' and in the process produce the 2 visually obvious references to the previous Kong films.Go on, and place here the references that you can find: helicopters against an orange sky, the forced Vietnam bits, the Full Metal Jacket nods, Bowie vs Doors references, and whatever you feel like finding out and filling in. In our age of irony, filtered through nostalgia, i supposed this film will have its place, and the nodding head of Nixon may be read under recent political events in America (although it was most certainly filmed before the last American election). This viewer had fun, but in the end has left the island with nothing more than the memory of a few skulls that could have been kings.",Null,2,3,23 March 2017
Inception," eternal sunshine, with a kick
","This is a page turn, an important statement by an important director of our days. It is also the peak (so far) of whatever interesting things Nolan has been exploring so far. Di Caprio is in this ride and this is probably his best effort into becoming a serious actor in the film world. He won me here.I am a perfectly defined film viewer. I care for emotions, for feelings (love or others), and for their visual depiction. And i really really care for storytelling devices and the narrative building of a film. I really despise any film that banalizes simple and real emotions. So i appreciate more the films that conceive a coherent narrative structure even if they don't hit so hard on the emotional tension, than films that depict love or friendship or empathy as sentimental pornography. So, the top of the game for me in what concerns cinema is sensitive and honest stories, backed up but intelligent narrative structures.That's what we have here, shiny and beautiful as i have seen very few times. The very abstract concept of what is being told merges with the fabric of the film. The film itself builds the content we are supposed to have in the story. The structure of the film Is the story. How we enter those sub structures mimics how the characters do it. It is as simple as that to explain, and as complex as the film is to understand.There are several notions, dear to me, that moved me. We have Obvious layers (dreams within dreams) that are literally and constantly explained to us by many characters in the film. Moving from one layer to the other is literally moving deeper, in a spatial sense. Each layer has autonomy, but is severely affected by how the other layers progress. So a sneeze in a layer is an earthquake in the other.The most beautiful notion is that we have people on the inside of people. We have people bending the soul of other people, intimately touching each other, touching in a sense deeper than what we have ever seen in cinema. Nolan nearly leverages literature in how we can reach the inside of a character beyond what we can see. For those matters alone, the best sequence is probably the visit to Paris. Di Caprio and Page. How she bends his memories of Paris, how she literally bends the set. And the final sequence, the collapsing city, a reinvention of di Caprio's memories of his memories. One of the greatest things here is how emotion is mapped into space. Every set is the very portrait of a memory, of a sensation. It's an original way (for how it's done) to associate film with the visual use of space. I'll mark this.Marion Cotillard as the character who, from where we can see, is merely a memory (invented or not) and hardly the real person. Her performance is great, eventually the greatest in this film. We play the game of invented/shared memories, that happen over reality, and we move deeper into the layer where we can bend and change those memories, thus creating new ones, or inventing them. That's the Inception. Can you create the memory of this film? Can you co-create its layers while you dream it? And more important, can you induce it into the layers of your own life as naturally as if it had grown out of you?My opinion: 5/5 experience it.http://www.7eyes.wordpress.com",Null,0,6,20 September 2010
Sherlock Holmes," Actor, and Placement
","Somehow, i've always avoided the cinematic (or TV) presentations of Sherlock Holmes. I find the character fascinating, but i always felt it was more invested in literature, not cinema. His deductions, the way he surrounds the worlds he investigates are a feast for thinking minds. Even when the deductions are over the top (which happens often!) one can't stop smiling at the cleverness. More than that, the character is a perfect piece invested in a clever, irresistible and fascinating world. London. That part is visual, and a good ground to invest a cinematic world. But, unlike for example anything by Agatha Christie, Doyle's cleverness is rooted in pure deductive logic, not on the mechanics of the world. Notice that Christie's crimes are many times a matter of understanding how things happened, spatially (murder on the orient express is the zenith of that). I suppose Doyle formed his mind before cinema had any significant impact on how our minds work.So the challenge for any modern filmmaker, and actor, who wants to update Holmes, is to make the character more cinematic, more appealing. Several tricks are used here, most of them successful, even if straightforward. One is the most obvious, making Holmes an action character (which actually is in its original dna, even though TV productions usually ignore that). This might be a flop, and make the version laughable, but by now there is a sense of irony and self awareness in Ritchie's films (sincer Lock Stock) that allows him to support a xxi century action figure in Holmes clothing that actually is watchable. A minor trick here is the association of the deduction with the very process of physical fighting, which creates some Matrix moments. Well, their watchable, though not particularly interesting. In the greater arc, there are good action sequences, because, as any competent action these days, considers the elements of the surrounding space, and uses them.But there are two big things in this film, which take it to new levels of interest.One is the acting. Jude Law is a clever guy, an interesting actor whose greatest quality is how he merges anonymously with the context he is intended to integrate. He willingly becomes a piece of a larger tapestry, and that really is something to look upon. There are not many actors who can claim they can do this competently. But the king of the game is Downey Jr. He is the gold piece in the puzzle of updating Holmes. There certainly will be a before-after Holmes character, with this film. The man is capable to work his performances on several directions, and each of them is a perfect link to its surroundings. So he gives in to Ritchie's demands, and introduces humour, irony, and self-awareness in the character, to make it usable for the director's winks at ironic action. He invests totally on the creation of a character who merges with the textures of the context, while being distinct from it. And while doing it, he folds us into his game, so we do everything with him, side by side. We deduce, we smile, we run, all with him. So, if the film hadn't other qualities, Downey Jr would still make it worthy, because he, alone, solves one the most basic problems with any film: to find a channel audiences can safely cross into the game someone (director) proposes. He is one of the best ever.But there is another great thing here, which i suspect has a lot to do with several guys involved in the process of making the film. The result is an incredible sense of placement. London, XIXth century. All those dirty muddy streets, all the dirt. The fascination of the inner locations, namely the midget's laboratory. How those sets are usable, in the action scenes. That's all competent, more than competent. It's perfectly rendered, carefully photographed, it sounds overly artificial, but it's a matter of taste, i suppose. But what was really striking was the use of the London bridge. Notice how it is announced, early in the film, with a similar perspective to the one we'll get in the end. Than, the great sequence, when Irene Adler goes through the sewage, goes up, and we end up with a close up of her, in an unidentified location. The angle opens, we move away, and we are set up in the location for the final fight scene, which in its own merits is interesting enough. So, this was a unique way to actually use an establishing location, instead of merely showing it. I mean, how many films have shown the Eiffel towers? countless. How many actually use it? not so many. This is one of the best London cities we've seen lately.My opinion: 4/5http://www.7eyes.wordpress.com",Null,152,224,4 January 2010
WALL·E," Animated Antonioni
","What a great thing happened here. Once again a Pixar film brings something different from what they'd done before, and which exploits with intelligence interesting and important aspects of film creation.Three things made this film to me. Two of them where interesting and had class, the third thing may, in the future depending on other films after this one, be regarded as the beginning of something new.-The 'animation' in its pure form is world-class in a minimalistic point of view. Wall.E, the character, is a master-piece of taking a lot out of very few elements. After all it's a box, with associated gadgets, there is not the expressive possibilities of something like a skin. Everything is made out of small movements, expression details, things that analyze to a great extent the limits of what it takes to make something expressive. It was not so successful with the female white robot or with any other character, namely humans.-The self-ironic commentary. Pixar has the same roots of Apple (Steve Jobs), and it's interesting and self mocking that in a time when Apple is trying to revolutionize to a global extent the concepts of interface, that they criticize the very 'white world' they propose, by bringing out the potential negative effects of its dissemination at a global scale. The 'whitness' of feelings, the world where humans are taught where to look at, taught by the gadgets, and by the computers, like the one which emulates Kubrick/Clarke's 2001. In this film, people see the film they are told to see. That's much more remarkable to me than the so talked about ecological concerns.-For last, and more important to me is the bold statement that it is possible to inject the fluids of the most deep kinds of visual meditation in the content of a commercial 'family' film. The boldness of creating a product such as this with hardly any dialog, and the capacity to elevate the quality of a fully artificial image to a level which allows our visual imagination to work emotionally. Something Tarkovsky or Antonioni taught us how to do. This film was bold and it is important for that, but it still isn't a masterpiece in those concerns. I want to see more. I hope this thread will be followed.My opinion: 4/5 See it.http://www.7eyes.wordpress.com",Null,0,1,1 October 2008
Blow," unworthy of Depp
","I was expecting something different here. I think i was deceived by the key image associated with this film, one that has Depp and Penelope lying down side by side, looking at us, over a red bottom. It told me i was going to see a film about people, about two people, eventually bound together, eventually in love. Eventually i was going to watch a love story, a film centered on a relation.It was a much better promise than the mess this film is. It is absolutely worthless, it takes you time and gives nothing in return. It's absolutely incompetent in everything, except for the redeeming elements of watching Depp and Franka Potente acting.The film fully follows the Scorcese gangster film model, the one he flourished in Goodfellas. It's a mixture of style, a certain idea of the coolness of the mob world, associated with the violence that comes with it. In practical terms, we follow a certain character, and get into the various aspects of his life. Literally into his head, as the voice off is an important element to make this work. We get into the head of the character as much as we get into the mechanics of the world we are shown. A clear reference to that is that here we have Liotta playing Depp's dad, the same Liotta who was Depp's character in Goodfellas. See that? The thing is, with Goodfellas, that world was shiny, brilliant, it was seductive as much as it was decadent. Characters there were reluctant pieces of an inevitable chess game. And we were one of them. The film was visceral, violence was inevitable. Here everything is lazy. It's not worth being here, i don't care about any of what i've seen. The world of the film is incomplete, we don't feel the true pulse of anything that is given to us. We don't have love or friendship, just sex and friendly words. Not violence, just punches and tricks, we don't have commitment, things just happen.But, in the middle of this, we have Depp, and a very interesting and underexposed Potente. That's the only pure moments of the film are those when the screen is shared by them two. There is a mutual understanding among them, that goes beyond the script, or the rubbish lines they have to perform. It goes beyond the short sight of the produces. Sadly, Potente is underexposed, and very soon taken away from the screen. Depp struggles to exist as an artist for the rest of the film. The contrast between him and the others shows me i'd like to be watching another film, where someone actually cares about what Depp can do. Not this one. This is the wrong film. Penélope Cruz here is all about screaming, her looks (unflatteringly used), and the contrast to Potente's character, 2 of the 3 women that define Jung's life (the other is his daughter). Penélope essentially does what she feels should be done, that's good when the director knows where he's going (Almodóvar or even Woody). Not here. We needed to have a film with Depp and Potente lying down side by side, and that image had to matter.My opinion: 2/5 http://www.7eyes.wordpress.com",Null,0,1,10 November 2009
Blade Runner," Impressionism in dystopic contours
","First of all, Blade Runner is not about a story, it's not about, characters, it's not about being concrete. It's about landscape, it's about city, as reflex of civilization. It's about correcting our present, knowing what happened in the past. And so, the future is used, so the sci-fi mood is brought. Paradoxal it may be, the future tense gives the viewer the necessary distance towards what he is supposed to 'see'. And what you see is in here fundamental, not because of the spectacular sets, not because the astonishing prediction of what city will be in years to come but because it only shows what's already in front of us. Practically every sci-fi film that tries to predict an entirely new city is based on what is 'futuristic' in the time of its idealization, from visual power masterpieces like Metropolis, to franchised versions of a future world like Demolition Man. Ridley Scott proposes a city that exists already, today, now. We get to the future through present, our present and that links us to it where the future tense gave us distance. Everything is deliberately thrown in a dystopic, chaos like package, that shakes, not because it's dark and rainy, but because it's in a city that exists now, and in buildings older than a century now. Sebastian lives in a neoclassic building from probably end of XIXth century, the routs of everything clearly bad and distorted and perverse in this Scott's future are clearly anchored on our present. Obviously every sci-fi director is before anything else, an earth inhabitant, so his base is his reality as a earthier, but in here, he makes the effort to through that at the viewer.So, everything is classical, Sean Young, a replicant that doesn't know it, has a classical beauty, the characterization, the way she moves, the way she talks. She plays the piano. She has a memory. She is human, except for the fact she is a replicant, created by men and that's where man is elevated to the category of god in the exact measure that he creates with the same perfection as Him. The camera is Deckard, the camera is the observer and this observer works in the top of the buildings, works above humanity, works on the last floor of Tyrell's Olympus like industrial complex. What is made in here is a change in time scale notion in order to get us, as viewers, down to earth. If god is eternity, and men's life is a second in eternity; what we see here is Men's life becoming the possible eternity and the replicants' 4 years life just a small passage in reality. Whenever replicants are referred in Blade Runner it is in fact me who is being referred. Ultimately, this may be about falling to earth with the notion that time is precious, and 4 years can be a long time, if well used. 'all those moments will be lost in time like tears in rain', says Rutger Hauer's character.This is about keeping memory for eternity, whatever that is.Men is reflected on his creation, his imperfections, but also his qualities, show up in what he creates. So, throughout the film, we come to change our view of the replicants, from menace to empathy, from desire to eliminate (as survival instinct) to desire to embrace and consequent emptiness for their disappearance. That's when replicants become men, that's when we know he's not talking about robots, but us. 'petty she won't live, but again, who will?' this is bottom line, nothing lasts forever, creator or creation. Still, facing the inevitability of death doesn't stop Deckard from running for life, or replicants from trying to live.Another aspect is that there is no 'soundtrack', there is no 'music' in this one, only 'soundscapes', as dystopic as the city, as dark as this future, as empty as no future. Those sounds are the story of that city, are the story of our past, as told in our present, where there is no memory, where memories are forgotten, or made up as, once more, a survival device. Memory is a pillow for emotions, says Tyrell, he is god, he knows emotions are needed in order to exist, but he also knows he can't perpetuate lies about it, he knows he will die.Ultimately this may be a film noir anchored sci-fi film which, if well explored, could become a genre in itself. Checking it, you will find practically every aspect of film noir in it. For every aspect I referred, i believe this to be the essential sci-fi film, fulfilling completely the role that sci-fi was always supposed to have, but hardly ever had. Between 1979 with Alien and 1982 with this one, Ridley Scott moved definitely forward in understanding what science fiction is, and how it should leak into film making. Every artist has his limits in innovation and creation, apparently Scott's limit was defined here. His post work never got to be as influential or good as these two films, but, what he gave was more than enough.No rating needed, what i said should be enough.",10,3,6,21 December 2006
Toy Story 3," Totoro
","The first 10 years of Pixar's exploration of feature animations were the preparation for some great results. Ratatouille and Wall.E were a glossary of narrative and visual accomplishments by the studio. But Up was a failure, i think, some would speculate because of the 3D, preferred by money making Disney, others would argue that Disney itself its pulling the strings now, and the creative minds in Pixar are constrained now. Some applaud that turn to the codes of Disney reference, others remark on the loss of creative power. And those opinions fall positive or negative, over this Toy Story. And although i am concerned about the 'disneyzation' of pixar, i think this specific film is a different case in their filmography, and it actually exceeds Up in many respects.The 3D is a waste. Unless i feel they have something to say in these respect, i'm not sure whether i'll try to see a Pixar film in 3d again. It's a mere executive decision with no visual consequences other than the traditional loss of light. The short film that precedes the film, that is something well done here.We don't have a completely absorbing environment, like in Wall.E (although the garbage scene does report to that film), instead we live on the memory of the older Toy Story films. Indeed that nostalgic component of this film (specially for guys of my age) counts a great deal here, and indeed may cloud my own vision of this film. But i admit it's nice to see Buzz and Woody live through to see our days. That's why this film is a special case within Pixar (although i know that this Toy Story 3 was a pressure by Disney due to the value of the brand with the ticket buyers).We do not have an enervative spatial exploration and camera moves, but i think they synthesize some of the lessons learned in Ratatouille, which was all about cranking virtual cameras under tables and between dishes. So this film, in those matters, works like a recap of previous episodes.The story itself is a disappointment. The temptation to the self-reference of the previous TS was to great for them to deny it. What we get is the memory of old characters. I do like how we get into this film, the western episode of the train crash, it's an efficient device, and it also tells us that we will have film references through out the film. Indeed we do, countless references to countless genres, as far as i could tell all of them audience friendly. Ken and Barbie work in their own acts, although they lack integration to a larger structure which, anyway, is not meaningful enough to make them stretch the script to include Ken and Barbie as important characters, instead of circus numbers.What Pixar Has been getting via Dreamworks, is the rendering of characters facial expressions. But i which next time we have these guys back to the innovation trails.P.S. a remarkable detail that i truly appreciated, which remarks on the proximity Pixar-Disney is the inclusion of a Miyazaki character with the other toys in the nursery. it's well known the recent proximity between Disney and Ghibli, so i really smiled at this wink they were giving us.My opinion: 3/5 http://www.7eyes.wordpress.com",Null,0,0,26 August 2010
Vicky Cristina Barcelona," Vicky Cristina Wherever
","What a mess. So flawed, with such little substance, no narrative interest at all (as Woody used to give) and the total misreading/generalization of a city.. the love triangles, with Bardem as the common vortex. This is neither in the comedy inclined, narrative exploitive sense Woody Allen used to give it back in Annie Hall days nor in the sexual tension exploitation of, say, Henry and June. He places cardboards and makes them swing around (badly chosen) sets, making them seem dorks with useless dialogs, which underline how such a story of dangerous love/sex balance could never happen with such superficial mundane people;. the voice over: what an insult. Woody Allen was a truly sensitive filmmaker when he was at his best, he built narratives which invite the spectator to find out, make us part of the process, make us follow them, he would give us a peach, and let us peal it. How could he think we needed an annoying fellow literally retelling absolutely every useless action or obvious thought of every character. What was the point? Didn't he trust his ability for visual narrative enough to let us find for ourselves?. Barcelona, or whatever city he filmed in. I'm glad i watched this in Barcelona, because i could get out of the theatre and check that i had just saw a city woody wanted to place in the film, not the real thing. He was so good in embedding New York in the fluids of his kind of narrative, his kind of story, his kind of character, that it truly disappointed me, more than anything else, that e failed so miserably here. Barcelona is not tuned to flamenco. The very definition of 'Spanish city' may be something controversial (in fact, any real city is an unity on its own, that's another discussion) but if any definition for that can be found, Barcelona will for sure be out of it. How could he place such an amount of ordinary touristic Spanish clichés into it? He even places a character who studies 'Catalan identity'. Where was that? She is learning Spanish, not Catalan, and the life she took in the city (not the phony life with her phony husband, but the life she chose to have) is something she could have elsewhere, no need to be in Barcelona necessarily. Th prostitutes Johanson photographs are probably the closest thing we have to a real city in this film. Gaudi shows as a mere highlight of assumed clichés, he is shot so superficially as he is in any touristic selling film. It's a shame, it's not good to see an intelligent, yet intuitive filmmaker fall to the pits of vulgarity like this. The only mildly interesting aspect i found here is how he neglects and opposes to the high-class futile chit-chat of American culture that once once the juice that flavoured all his dialogs, in his New York based work.My opinion: 1/5http://www.7eyes.wordpress.com",Null,8,19,20 September 2008
Live Free or Die Hard," New action, old memories
","There are interesting elements here.. This film is inserted in a recent tendency for action movies, which i believe started with the first Bourne (but i may be mistaken, i'm always checking for the origins and many times i find routs in older projects i didn't know). That tendency (influence) has much to do with style, and it features usually a kind of blue toned photography, i an apparently hard way to perform action/fight scenes. It has also to do with camera work, which is most of the time hand held and chooses not to make the whole action completely clear to us, as if we were intervenients, and makes us look elsewhere even when the action is not there. This 'style' has been used (with more or less similar elements) in recent features such as the Bourne series, Syriana, even Casino Royale and this fourth Die Hard. . The funny thing here is: The original Die Hard was very original in the way the audience related to the hero (Willis is responsible for this) but also in the way he performed his (apparently) uncoreographed action scenes (though this kind of fight probably started with Harrison Ford's Indiana). So here in this one, after so many years of degeneration of action fights (badly) interpreting oriental moves, we have Willis fighting in his 'clumsy' way the girl very 'kung fu' oriented. This is a turn of the page. Interesting. The theme was well chose in this logic of producing a new film starring an old hero. This computer dependent world is what changed in practical terms in the last 20 years. So, beyond the basic idea of the 'old hero in a new world' we have another interesting device which is how the 'bad guy' fights the good one, no physical action. Did anyone found strange that our PC physically developed geek didn't die after a hard core body fight with our McClane? This is just curious but it becomes interesting when from here we get to understand that our mind changed in the way we expect the action to develop. Oh and this paranoid about terrorist global incursions is not new, but gained new forms after September 11th, obviously, in real life and film (film not also follows life, but also helps creating the paranoid, power institutions use these mechanisms, especially among Americans, so that sequence with American presidents talking and being edited is ironic in the sense that even though we think they are being manipulated, it is in fact us, the audience, specially the American audience, who is being manipulated).. Anyway, the film is not without flaws, and i really miss the internal dialog that the 'old' McClane used to establish with the audience. This old man who calls himself MacClane is almost a cartoon of the other one. We get the flavour (that's the basic demand for most of the die hard 'fans', but it's very far from the type of device that established new patterns for action actors, so fully appreciated by action flicks since then (Cage repeatedly copied this, watch the 'comedy' Con Air).My evaluation: 3/5http://www.7eyes.wordpress.com",Null,0,1,7 October 2007
Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows: Part 2," to go, to drift, to arrive
","This was an interesting series of film to follow. I don't share any of the excitement that brought hard core fans of the books into these films for the last 10 years. I never read any complete book, although i did have a very close contact with some very freak fans of the series, so i know what their motivations are. The discussion of these harder fans moves around how each knew film was or not able to grasp all the contents of the book, and produce the image(s) that the book suggested to each reader. Or was it acceptable to leave certain elements of the story that a film Always has to leave behind. I never cared about those arguments, because the films create a universe of their own, slightly close to the one in the books, which can even coincide at some moment, but still autonomous. So in a way, the books are to the films, as Hogwarts is to the real world In the films. Rooted in it, but no It. What kept me coming to the franchise was the fairly interesting idea of seeing how these films would follow a story than span over 7 years, using the same (teenager) actors, that would grow up with their characters. The main interesting idea was this: the films grow as the characters in it, as the actors that represent those characters And as the target public grows with them. We see the films mature in content, we see the actors get older, we see the fabric of the cinematic world change before our eyes. That was an interesting path, mapped into my own evolution as a viewer in the last 8 years (when i started to watch the films). This was not a linear obstacle free course. The owners of the franchise messed up a lot in the way, but they were trying something never done for those matters, so we'll have to give them a break.So they chose Columbus for the first 2, a master of children's films, someone whose mind specifically works to understand how children's heads function, visually, and narratively. Both his films had a theme, visual, cinematic. Than the third one, probably the best, added notions of time and space as one, and called to do it a master in that cinematic kingdom, Cuarón, the best director to work on this franchise. Azkaban was a maturing film, evolved like a teenager would, and added cinematic deepness into the seducing yet flat world of the first 2. Cuarón gave us the best Hogwarts and the best cinematic use of the story. The dramatic shift came after that one. Numbers 4 and 5 were absolute disasters, suffering from the same mistakes that any bad teenager movie suffers, pretending to be special and appealing to the uniqueness of each one's personality while being itself a boring copy paste sub product. This was bad, i was really sorry that Yates wouldn't follow the leads of the first 3 films, he broke a chain. But he redeemed himself in the 6th installment, and he did that rooting once again the series on space. Hogwarts again, but with a new vision. That was a fascinating film which, coupled with Azkaban, gives us 2 great visions of cinematic space. After that the story required that the next film would be disembodied, and it was. I talked about that one elsewhere. It was an interesting move, though not specially powerful in the end. And we get to this film. As it was expected, this would be merely a conclusion. It had to be grand, it had to have fireworks, flashy scenes, dramatic kills, suffering, pain, redemption. It had a battle, central to the film, where all the forces collide, all the tensions are released, all the schemes come to an end. It's modeled after the third lord of the rings, and it doesn't bring much to the table, a mere conclusion, certainly required, but not so much interesting.One thing is interesting though. We have a great number of loose ends that are tied up in this film. Dumbledore's brother, Snape's past, Harry's 'half death'. How each of this knots is tied up to the larger narrative uses interesting narrative cinematic devices. Dumbledore whose image is reflected in a piece of mirror Harry carries with him. Snape through the pensatorium, which basically creates a film inside Harry's head. And Harry's death, although lame on the way the set has been taken care, which slides two characters (one of them already dead) into a 3rd abstraction, over the abstraction which is Hogwarts and the magical world, in relation to the 'real' non magical world of the film, in relation to our real world as viewers. I'm sorry that the film had to spend so much time in battles and grandeur to allow itself to explore these devices.I wouldn't call it essential nor even close. But i won't harm to spend to spend time with this franchise, and watch it as a whole, in its context.My opinion: 3/5 (for this film)http://www.7eyes.wordpress.com",Null,0,0,23 August 2011
Kagemusha," film as canvas
","I watched my first Kurosawa 7 years ago. I'm 24 so that's a relevant amount of time. Still, i feel i'm a beginner, also because i only have a couple years of seriously watching films, learning them and from them. So i'll comment more like an approach, for sure naive, but to fix some ideas i got from this first watching of Kagemusha.24.10.2008 -Kurosawa works like a painter. It is well known that he painted most of what he shot, and that helped him create in the mind what he would bring to the eye. The paintings are in themselves worth seeing; an extra in the DVD had an editing with dialogs in the film over posing the storyboard, in the order they show in the film. It's a good experience just by itself. So we have shots perfectly and exquisitely taken care. The composition is great, balanced as only a good artist would make;-in a way, this is the first Kurosawa film in colour, because it is the first one in which he truly works with it and makes it part of the composition. The previous experiences in color could work as well in b&w. Not here. I noticed how the colours carry the actions, how the perfectly balanced frames get alive because of the colours. The skies are amazing, of course, and the dream in the clouds as well. The artificial environment of it makes the film look sketchy, as it was in fact, for it is known that Kurosawa was preparing the big project (Ran)-The editing was great; The framing he gives is mostly still, his eye works like that of a painter, but the editing sequences all shots perfectly and it makes us believe that after one certain shot, the only possible shot that makes the thing work is the next one. It's a sublime structure, solid as a rock, and if you work mentally you'll see you wouldn't take anything or put anything. Kurosawa might. I guess that the editing was a mental process for him, he would beautifully paint the storyboard, but in his mind he would also build the editing scheme. That's why he could edit by night what he'd shot during the day-the story is, as many, about actors acting. The role of a leader has in itself lots to do with acting. That need to seat in battle, not moving, not showing fear, is showing something to the surrogates, and to the enemies, which may not correspond to the truth. Here we have a double pretending to be that leader.-Coppola and Lucas deserve being thanked for allowing this to happen. However, when they speak it's clear that Coppola is much more aware of what the film and the work of Kurosawa is about, while Lucas is bedazzled but the visible effects. This is meaningful. I never made a film, i which i could, but i don't think creating one has so much to do with what lenses you use, or how you manage multiple cameras shots as much as it has to do with what you want to say (and how). The first issue is technical. The second moves with your soul. That's why, of the both, Coppola was the one who recognized the global flaws of this good film - breathtaking if you think of it as a table of experiences, the canvas of a painter.My opinion: 4/5http://www.7eyes.wordpress.com",Null,1,2,24 October 2008
Click," contrast
","Another simple and highly used formula for Hollywood comedy: a simple, supposedly deep, honest sincere, moral issue: you have to seize the journey, living is the most important thing, don't choose work and success over your family.Than you add a device that allows you to move further and explain the morals, in this case a remote which controls time development, and which allows you to move forward and back in time, and eventually making you loose control (he uses preferences). Than, Sandler, who is supposed to make it work. Well, i don't give much for his comedy skills, with few exceptions. But even for those who enjoy his best performances, i think this may stay a couple meters below what he can deliver.Comedy and Drama can be a very powerful mixture in the right hands. Chaplin may have invented the notion, and is probably the absolute master of the genre to these days. It's something that is based in high contrasts, therefore enhancing the drama bits. If it is well driven, it can tear you a part: the filmmaker makes you laugh out loud, enjoy yourself with the 'frivolities' of life, and than, suddenly, or gradually, you're pushed into a narrow abyss of sadness, which is enhanced by your previous state of joy. Contrast. Well, these guys didn't do it, they weren't close to it.My opinion: 1/5 http://www.7eyes.wordpress.com",Null,4,7,2 January 2009
Moon," mind drilling
","I'm convinced that no genre is more connected to the reality of our lives than science fiction. The levels of visual and contextual abstraction demanded by the genre are so high that you can only do good science fiction if you root its essence on what we are, outside the life of the film. You take out the comfort of recognizing places (most of the times), of understanding moods, contexts, ways to live. But you're still left with people, or beings that stand for people (planet of apes) or better still, moodiness, and context that suggest people's state of being. That's our link, that's our portal to any interesting sci fi built world. Méliès. 2001. Blade Runner. Now this. It is a great addition to the filmography of 2009, and eventually the greatest achievement in sci fi of this finishing decade.This is a sort of 2001 meets Blade Runner, two threads of science fiction which i hadn't seen mixed ever, and doubted it could be done. It's better than that. It doesn't mix. It just makes you believe it mixes. The film deceives you all the way, puts you in the same sort of unawareness Sam Bell is supposed to feel. So the film is what it is telling.1 - This is where we start; Minimalistic, 2001 based imagery of the space. Open spaces, emptiness, isolation, meditation. That's the starting ground. the man and the machine (Sam and GERTY). We're led into believing we'll watch the battle for control, who wins, who's in charge? who deceives who?. What is the machine hiding, Is it hiding anything? The power over narrative control of the story, that's what it is.2 - But than, we're included Sam's doubles in the story. True or false? are We being deceived? Are the doubles real or a product of Sam's imagination? Is any of what we see any real depiction of what's going on, or are we left already into the delusional imagination of a homesick isolated man? 3 - the unfolding of the previous point. Yes, the doubles are real, physically real, at least everything indicates so. So, if every clone is Sam Bell, if every clone has the same past, who is Sam Bell? Who is any of those human beings, who can share among them the same emotions, the same feelings, the same remembrances. Here it invades completely Dick/Blade Runner territory. replicants. here we have the reversed story of Blade Runner, the world according to the replicants. Not a dubious depiction of whether Harrison Ford was a replicant himself, instead a hard exploration of what being one means. Invented memory, stuffed emotions. And all that those things mean to us, as human beings.All the visual work has a coherence to what is being told. There is not a visual reference that outdoes the others, and that's actually a good thing. We may have a great new filmmaker here. We certainly have a worthy film here.My opinion: 4/5 http://www.7eyes.wordpress.com",Null,1,2,24 December 2009
Slumdog Millionaire," transatlantic cinema
","I think there are two layers of observations from where we can watch this film.One way is to look at the film as a small part of something bigger. That bigger thing would be the possibility of making this experience become a certain rule in film world. The growing proximity between bolly and Hollywood, the possibility that we might start getting films bounded financially and thematically (and culturally) by this proximity. If we consider this approach, than the fact that this film would become so celebrated by the key agents of promotion of American films (awards) would be a kind of signal for this new age. I think the other layer of approach i propose may confirm this one: this is a kind of film i catalog as 'ascending', which basically means that we start off in hell, and we climb stairs of suffering throughout the film until we arrive at heaven. A sort of inverted dynamics, that we've seen in Cidade de Deus, Blindness, Irreversible (where the arc is literally inverted). In this case, Danny Boyle picks up the experiments Meirelles made in the slums of Brazil, and produces his own version. Boyle relies more on framing and camera work/positioning (he always has). Meirelles' films are, before anything, brilliant pieces of editing. So, on the visual side, we have different approaches, but which convey the same objective of moving into the slum, of exploring with a frantic eye the darkness of those daily lives. This film is brilliant in that respect. Yet, as it progresses, it moves away from the slum, and the cinematic choices answer to that, so the pace slows down, and little by little we end with a bollywood romantic ending. Love is the reward for the suffering, in this world that we now know to be, after all, a fantasy one. So Bollywood meets certain ideas of dark cinema. Remember my first approach?

Beetlejuice," Damaged world
","I've been spending some time with Burton. I like him, i feel strangely attracted to what he purposes, though i can't help recognizing the highly recognizable flaws.In summary: he creates worlds, sometimes he is thrilling on that alone, others not so much. But everyone of his films is a true vision of its creator, and that's something i value a lot. But he is not a good director. Planely as a director, he can't be more than just competent, because he doesn't work on the specific issues of direction (editing, camera-work, actor-direction...) with the same passion and special angle as he does with molding the world he gives us.So look at this. He was still a relatively young director (this was, i believe, his second long form). He didn't craft the world of this film as exquisitely as he did with later works. And the film is a relative failure to me because, once that rich notion of being side a quirky mind is gone, the rest doesn't hold.Oh, one thing that saves it: Michael Keaton's performance. I've never seen him act like he did here. He holds this as his best performance ever and i support it. It's a great physical and verbal acting, that engages the audience as well as the characters of the film, so the plot develops around the idea of one trying (and failing) to resist paying attention to him. Great.The animations are tender in some points, it has the flavor of old animations, that look artificial, but which we are willing to believe.

Valkyrie," illustrations
","I didn't find anything here that i wasn't expecting, and nothing i expected to be here was absent. This is a bad premise to commenting on a movie. The thing is, i don't expect much of Bryan Singer. Yes, he gave us 'usual suspects' which has some narrative interest in how the flashbacks are used and in how we redefine all that we'd seen with the final twist. But even there the direction was stylish, which means he chose effect over meaning, appearance over flesh. But clearly he is one of those guys who gets carried away by his immense enthusiasm, but than doesn't have the brain to bend his emotions to a coherent structure. Like him, so do think most of the common film goers, especially those who would flock to a movie like this. So, we have a box office success.But if you want to go further, you'll find very little to interest you here. The one thing that matters is the story itself. What these guys tried to make was big, not because of the act in itself (certainly many Germans would want to do the same if they could) but because they were privileged Germans, who could just play the Nazi game. Of course by than the end of the war was close and they felt that, so killing Hitler might also be a way to protect the future of those who were around him. In any case, it was a brave attempt. But that can be told by a simple documentary, like the one in the extras of this DVD. The film is a mere illustration of the events. It's like those re enactments of historical facts in the History channel docs, with a (much) higher budget. But apart from that it is pretty useless, except for a minor entertainment value.Well, the writers tried to build on the tension by not allowing us to understand or check Hitler after the bomb exploded. That tension is mildly well done, because it elects a narrator, it makes us live the lives of the dissidents. But we knew what had happened, so even that fails.After the incredible participation of Cruise in Tropic Thunder, i would expect he would keep redeeming his career, but here he goes back to his usual numb thing. Pity.If you go for 'realistic' sets and good illustrations, i think this will do it perfectly for you. If not, i think you can skip it.My opinion: 2/5 http://www.7eyes.wordpress.com",Null,0,0,21 July 2009
