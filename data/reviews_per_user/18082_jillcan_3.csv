Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," Very interesting
","Let me start of by saying that this is the first STAR WARS movie that I have seen in its entirety. I never bothered to watch more than a few minutes each of the other ones. And, to tell you the truth, the only reason I saw this one was because my nine-year-old brother wasn't allowed to see it and I wanted to make him jealous. But then I ended up tacking a poster of Anakin Skywalker to my door and buying the movie novelization of this. Why? Because it turned out to be a decent movie after all! Jake Lloyd is what makes this movie good. That kid is so cute and irresistably charming. It's sad to think that Anakin will grow up to be Darth Vader. I didn't exactly get WHY this movie was happening but I guess I did get the general plot. ANAKIN! ANAKIN! ANAKIN! Go Anakin! I LOVE that kid. I hope he returns for episodes 2 and 3. And Jar Jar was, um, an interesting character, although I couldn't understand half of what he was saying. I guess I would give this movie two and a half stars out of four. Of course, based on Jake Lloyd's performance I would probably give that a three and a half out of four. So, see this movie if ya want some entertainment. It's very decent, and even if you don't like STAR WARS you might find this enjoyable. I don't think kids aged nine and under would really understand it, but there is nothing inappropriate. The only things little kids would like about it would probably be the lightsabers and the fights and the funny computer-animated characters. But, anyway, I recommend this to, well, anyone, basically. Don't expect the best, but don't expect the worst either.",Null,0,0,1 June 1999
Flashdance," Two Thumbs Up...Way Up!
","This movie was excellent. My dad is obsessed with the end part. Did you know a man was actually doing that twirly move? Jennifer Beals didn't dance at all, actually. They used about four stunt doubles. The acting in this movie is good, the dancing is good, the moral is good, the script seems well-written. To sum it up, see it!",Null,0,1,16 March 1999
2001: A Space Odyssey," Somebody be trippin'
","No offense, this movie is good, and I'd recommend it. But what the he** is supposed to be happening in the scene where Dave is landing on Jupiter? We get, like, ten straight minutes of shooting colors. It looks like the man's tripping, for God's sake, man! Geez, ya find yourself wondering if the planet's crust contains high dosages of crack, marijuana, and possibly some laughing gas here and there...",Null,0,1,16 March 1999
