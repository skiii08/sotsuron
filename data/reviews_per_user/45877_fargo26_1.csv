The Blair Witch Project," The Blair witch effect
","Ok, time to add my 2 cents about the 'Blair witch project phenomena' ... and I have to say that I reallllllly loved this movie ... This was indeed an original film with lots of scary moments that are quite effective even if nothing *really* scary is ever shown on screen (Use your imagination folks... geesh !)I understand how some people (most people ??) would dislike it though ... harsh language, minimal plot, shaky camera ... etc. etc.  But for me all those elements are waht make it really intriguing and believable.People in this movie talk as ordinary people ... not like they are reciting lines of dialogues from a script written by someone else.  The plot is really not so important either as the documentary aspect of the project is only a way to get those 3 in the woods and show what happened to them in a realistic way, without some phony twists and turns ... and the shaky camera aspect is the icing on the cake ... making it look even more 'real' ...
The acting is top notch, especially by Heather in the lead ... some really good scene especially the one where she 'apologizes' to her mother and the mothers of her friends ... extreme close up of her face in the middle of the night, brilliant !This is the kind of movie that you either love or hate and I am certainly in the 1st category.  It is also a movie that would appeal more to people who see a lot of movies I think ... People who watch a movie per month will probably hate it ... but if you have a little more 'experience' it will probably be a better experience.Some really chilling scenes and tension building up all the time make this movie one of the scariest of all times, if you are willing to 'think' a little of course because it is not really what you see on screen that is frightening .. it is what you imagine seeing the situation those people are in.4.5/5",Null,0,1,4 November 1999
