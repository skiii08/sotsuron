50 First Dates," Brilliantness!
","This is such a cute film! Although, i wasn't convinced at first. Once the it all gets going, it's pretty damn good!Both actors done an amazing job. They were pretty much perfect for the characters. I can def see how it would make people cry. It shows what people do for love/the one they love. It took you through a whole range of emotions and yes, it does make you laugh. If it doesn't, what's wrong with you?! Things don't always go to plan and this shows that but things will work out in the end! Especially if you fight for what you want!I found it to be a really original storyline and I would recommend this to anyone!",9,0,1,21 July 2007
