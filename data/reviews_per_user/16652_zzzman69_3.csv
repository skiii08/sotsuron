The Equalizer," Et tu, Denzel?
","I am writing this review just to do what I can in my small way to lower the viewer rating for this movie (if that is what it was). I can only speculate that the majority of viewers saw another movie, certainly not the one that I tried to watch. I did not stay to the end but that is because the older I get the less inclined I am to torture myself. I simply refuse to believe that somewhere in this country that there are not writers who could actually write a screenplay for Denzel Washington that would at least rise to the level of mediocrity. The writing in this movie could only have been dreamed up by a social deviant during a root canal. It scares me to think that anyone around me might find such violent moronic tripe to be entertainment. The only saving grace is that apparently it only takes one ex-CIA agent to dismantle the best that Russian mobsters can throw at him, and boy did they try to! GO USA!",Null,1,3,5 January 2015
Interstellar," Where do I even begin?
","Having just seen this with my fellow movie buff friend, I can only speculate as to how anyone would give this movie such rave reviews. Have the studios hired an army of sycophants or is North Korea hacking movie review sites as well? Perhaps I have been spoiled in the past when I have watched movies that are not only visually arresting but thought provoking and exhibiting some respect for the audience. This movie is lacking any such saving graces. It takes far too long to tell a story that doesn't begin to hold together and does not even succeed as eye candy, which is all that Hollywood is about in this modern age of trying to rescue meaningless tripe with copious amounts of computer generated fluff. So to those of you were dazzled by this drivel, please let me know when the next blockbuster is due. Meantime I will go back to I Love Lucy reruns.",3,6,11,11 December 2014
The Theory of Everything," Thank you
","Having read a sampling of the reviews for this movie, it appears that there are viewers out there who thought it was going to be a physics lesson and are sorely disappointed. For those viewers, might I suggest reading A Brief History of Time. A marvelous book written by a man with a titanic intellect. Most of the rest of us were mesmerized by a great cast presenting not one but two love stories. Eddie Redmayne, in particular, gave a subtle, nuanced performance of a man who defied tremendous odds and daunting physical ailments to let his mind soar where few can go. Felicity Jones gave a great counterpoint portrait of the woman who stood by him and helped him climb that mountain. My hat is off to all of the cast and crew for making me proud to be human, for at least a few brief moments.",10,1,3,30 January 2015
