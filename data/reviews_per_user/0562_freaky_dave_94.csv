Alien 3," Not as good as the first two
","Alien 3 was a letdown of a sort when compared to both Alien and Aliens, classics in their own right. Sigourney Weaver returns as does Lance Hendriksen in two different roles. But even though Weaver is there, the movie just doesn't have the same power as the first two films.Ripley (Weaver) crash lands on a prison planet and is taken in by a doctor (Charles Dance). But the Alien has followed her again in a different way, and goes about destroying the inhabitants of the planet. Once again its up to Ripley to destroy the monster.The acting in this film was pretty good, and the visuals are amazing, but this movie, as directed by David Fincher, is way too dark and depressing when compared to the first and second films. This film leaves us with no real hope for anyone. Yes there are some genuine scares to be found here, and like I said the film has a good look to go with quality acting. Too bad that the director took it down this despairing road with a horrible ending that I never could accept.When compared to the first two movies, this film is second rate. However, it is still much better than Alien Resurrection which followed. That movie, to me, was a waste of time and money.",6,320,335,15 March 2006
It," It was a good movie. Well worth seeing.
","It was well acted, and had a lot of creepy scenes. THe guy playing the clown (Bill Skarsgard) was creepier than the one in the mini-series (Tim Curry). I enjoyed the comedy and the chemistry between all the leads. However, I read the book as well, and thought that some other scenes from the novel were cut that shouldn't have been. I believe the movie could've been scarier, and maybe the second half will be, since it will involve the kids as adults. I give it and 8 out of 10. By the way, I did enjoy the mini-series as well, but it wasn't as good as this movie.",8,5,10,18 September 2017
Hereditary," One of the most disturbing horror movies in years
","A family is torn asunder when the oldest matriarch dies, leaving the living to deal with dark secrets and disturbing and tragic occurrences that follow after her death. THat's the simplest way I can explain the plot without giving away spoilers.I've seen a lot of horror movies, and recently, following movies like A Quiet Place, Get Out, Don't Breath, It, and It follows among others, I've noticed that horror films have come back in a big way. All of the movies I've mentioned above were good films in their own right, showing that horror films are still as strong as ever, but none of those mentioned films disturbed me in the way that Hereditary did. From the very first scene in Hereditary you are uncomfortable, and that feeling only becomes worse as the movie progresses in a slow burn. THere is a creeping dread throughout the film's entire run, which only increases and explodes in some shocking scenes that you might think you're ready for, but you are not. THis film is still on my mind after seeing it days ago, and that is a sure sign of a classic horror film in the making.THe performances are all excellent, so they all stand out in their own ways. I can't say that any one was better than the other. THe actors gave it their awe, and you can't ask for more than that.Some people will wonder why I've given it a 9 instead of a 10, and the reason for that is this movie takes a turn towards the climax which might not fit in this day and age. I understand it, but in an age of electronics it might not work for most people unless they are willing to think back in times when technology didn't exist as it does now. THis movie was a lot like 2017s The Witch, and takes themes from past horror films of the 60s and 70s as well. I'm looking forward to seeing this director do more films.",9,71,145,17 June 2018
Se7en," Depressing yet shockingly real
","A depressing yet effective thriller with a completely shocking and disturbing ending that will have you thinking about it for a long time. Yes that is the simplest way to explain David Fincher's Seven.Seven is a thinking film that will have one questioning society and life in general. Kevin Spacey plays John Doe, a serial killer, and he is perfect in the role. He chooses each one of the victims because they are guilty of each one of the seven deadly sins which include gluttony, sloth, pride, greed, lust, envy, and wrath. What he does to these people is downright horrible and utterly disgusting, but he believes that he is doing God's work by using passages out of books like Dante's Inferno and others. We as the viewers are disgusted by what he does, but during his long monoloque near the end we can't help but wonder that what he's doing seems justifiable in a lot of ways.The detectives on the case are Detective Somerset (Morgan Freeman) and Detective Mills (Brad Pitt). Both are also great in their roles. They are hot on John Doe's trail. One, Mills, the new kid on the block, does his job because he wants to improve things to make the world a safer place. The other, Somerset, is much older and has a very cynical outlook on life. Somerset's opinion is that he just wants to retire and escape from all the madness because he feels nothing will ever get better. Both of their personalities collide, but they continue to work together to solve the case.Gwneth Paltrow plays Tracy Mills. She is Mill's wife and hates that they have moved to the city. Her part in the movie is a small one and a minor role, but it becomes much more important then anybody could've ever suspected.This movie, splendidly directed by David Fincher, is dreary, dark, and depressing, but it is a very well made film which has some very strong points that it wants to make. It is well paced and filled with subtle moments that will lead to a very strong impact at the end. I didn't care to much for Fincher's Alien 3 because of how depressing it was, but that was a franchise that had already been started and was never really expected, in my opinion anyway, to take the darker turn that it does. With Seven we are not making a sequel, so it is a whole new ball game, and this time Fincher's skill shines through.The ending, as I said above is completely appalling, but it is never completely unexpected, and that is because of the smaller subtleties during the movie's running time which helps prepare us for what happens. I was never caught off guard by what finally happens, and that is why this film doesn't quite get a perfect rating. However, if anybody was to ask me if they should see this movie I would say hell yes. I would also tell them to be prepared for some very nasty scenes which will make your blood run cold.",9,0,0,16 October 2006
Star Trek," Very good movie. One of the best in awhile now.
","Star Trek was a fun movie. THe casting was well done, and the adventure and special effects just as well. Like with his popular TV series Lost, J.J. Abrams uses the time travel gimmick to start the new Star Trek series from scratch by using a time loop that changes all the events that occurred in the earlier TV show and films. In this way, he doesn't have to follow the older Star Trek which was becoming long in tooth anyway, but of course all of the same characters from the series and movies do indeed return. It's a clever idea that works.After an extended and well done prologue which gives the new series reboot its own beginning, the main characters are introduced and the action quickly begins. You see an angry ROmulan (Eric Bana) from the future, whose ship was forced through a black hole which brought him back in time, is seeking vengeance on Starfleet and Spock for not being able to help save his planet from being destroyed. He is hell bent on destroying all of Starfleet and Vulcan because of this, and so it is up to the USS Enterprise and its much younger crew to stop this from happening. On top of this, SPock and Kirk do not see eye to eye this time because the the future has been changed from what it should've been.THe cast was perfectly selected. CHris Pine as Kirk is funny, witty, and a rebel of a sort. He also looks a little bit like a young William Shatner. Zachary Quinto as Spock was right on target as well. I sort of like him more in this role then as the evil Syler from the TV series Heroes. Karl Urban was perfectly cast as Doctor McCoy and has a lot of fun dialoque which showed that he enjoyed this role. Simon Pegg plays Scotty, and he has the voice and mannerisms down to a T. ROunding out the cast of the USS Enterprise is Zoe Saldana as Nyota Uhura, John CHo (from Harold and Kumar) who plays Zulu, and ANton Yelchin who plays Pavel Chekov. THe last three don't get much time, but Yelchin uses his Russian accent to the extreme to make his scenes funny and a riot. CHo gets and action scene where he gets to wield a nasty blade, and Saldana gets a little bit of dialoque to show what she has. All the characters are never overdone by the fantastic special effects, which is a very good thing. I only wish they could've done more with Eric Bana's part as the avenging Romulan because it really could've been a more interesting role.Now lets talk about those special effects. They blew me away. THe Romulan ship was one nasty looking thing, and the Enterprise itself looked fantastic among many other things. Of course, like I said above, the special effects never out do the characters and story, and that always makes for a much better movie.Other than not giving the Eric Bana character much to do but shout and be angry, Star Trek is a very intense experience. I enjoyed it immensely and would suggest you see it in IMAx now before it is gone because that is the best way to see it. I grade this movie as a B+ or a high 8 out of 10.",8,0,7,18 May 2009
Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Man's Chest," Better than expected
","My first screening of Pirates of The Caribbean Dead Man's Chest came on a very long day. I went into the movie very tired and not in the right mood. Knowing that I couldn't review a movie correctly after a tired day I went and saw Pirates again on a better day. I was glad I did. This movie was actually fun to watch, and though it is not quite as good as the first film, it is still very watchable.Captain Jack Sparrow (Johnny Depp in one of the roles that will soon be one of his best) owes a blood debt to Davey Jones after Davey Jones helped him become Captain of the Black Pearl. Sparrow of course is not ready to fall into Davey Jones servitude as one of the ghastly sea creatures of the Flying Dutchmen, so he finds a way to avoid it, and this means trouble for poor Will Turner(Orlando Bloom) and Elizabeth Swann(Keira Knightley).Of course both Elizabeth and Will already have their own troubles for when they allowed Jack Sparrow to escape in the first film, and their wedding is interrupted and Elizabeth put in prison. Now Will must find Sparrow and make a bargain to get his compass, which leads the way to the heart of the same Davey Jones mentioned above. If not, poor Elizabeth will face the gallows for the rest of her life. Of course Elizabeth herself has other plans, and so the story continues in the second part of what is to be a three part series.The story in the second film is more confusing then the first because there are so many plot threads. That was probably why I had such a hard time seeing it the first time, however upon seeing a second screening it was much clearer. I was able to relax back and watch the entire movie without being distracted and found it to be quite an experience.Just about all the actors and actresses return in the second film, and then their are some surprise appearances that nobody, well those who haven't seen it, will suspect. All the performances were pretty good once again, and Johnny Depp is as great as ever as the pirate with the very bad hygiene. He really is enjoying this character he created, and by the profits that this movie has already made, so is everybody else.The special effects are top notch, and the scenery was quite enjoyable as well, but it is still not quite as good as the first film. I think it was because the first film had a feeling of mystery about it, whereas this film doesn't. The tale of Davey Jones and the Flying Dutchman just isn't as spooky as the undead crew from the Black Pearl, even though Bill Nighty gives a bravo performance as the villain just as Geoffrey Rush did in the first film.",8,3,6,24 July 2006
Hostel," Hostel is a good horror movie that makes a strong point
","I think I enjoyed Hostel not because of the gore, which this movie has loads of, or even the sex scenes which are pretty shallow and take up the first part of the movie. What I liked about this movie was the story and the point that director Eli Roth was trying to get across. That point is that most people outside of America do not like Americans very much. In their opinion, Americans are rude, inconsiderate, selfish and think they are better than everyone. Not only are they all these things, they are also naive, and it is this last point that leads our young protagonists into doing something they are never quite ready for. But how could they be?Eli Roth pulls no punches with this movie. It is in fact gorier and probably more disturbing then Saw. He sets the movie up as a soft porn flick which soon changes into a terrific horror movie involving torture and other nasty things.What really makes this film work is that deep down we as viewers know that things like this are possible. We assume that we are so safe in our own country and believe that we will be just as safe going into other countries. All we have to do is think about what's happening over in Iraq to see that security is not always possible when you are so far away from your own country and exploring cultures that you really know nothing about.Hostel is not a great film, the acting was pretty weak, and I found it hard to even care for the characters. But then I believe this is part of what Eli Roth was trying to say. After all, how can you care for such obnoxious people who care only about themselves and show nothing for others. However at the end of the film, I do believe that one of the main characters finally understands this and looks as if he's going to change his ways. I think maybe a lot of us should.",7,1,1,28 February 2006
Spider-Man 2," Far superior to the first film
","Spiderman 2 is by far a much better film than the first. The storyline is better, and some other important characters, besides the three main characters, are given some of the spotlight this time around. I liked it a lot.This time around Spiderman (Tobey Maguire)has to fight with Doctor Octopus and face up to some of his own personal demons while battling the man with six arms. Is he up to it? Well if you haven't seen it yet (if that's even possible) I'm not about to tell you. Let just say that the villain Doc Ock (played beautifully by Alfred Molina) is much better than the Green Goblin from the first film.We also have the usual supporting characters with Mary Jane (Kirsten Dunst), Aunt May (Rosemary Harris), Harry Osbourne (James Franco), and of course good old J. Jonah Jameson (J.K. Simmons). All of which are great for this movie. Both Aunt May and Jameson are given more to work with in the second film, and they do perfectly. They are one of the reasons why part 2 is the better film. Of course the special effects are an improvement over the first one as well, and Dunst, Maguire, and Franco are just as good as they were last time. And lets not forget the story, a big improvement.Spiderman 2 is one of those few times where the sequel is better than the original. It is in fact in my top five list of comic book adaptations, just behind the first Superman way back in 1978. I know some people wouldn't agree with this, but than everybody has their own favorite. I'm cool with that.",10,0,2,19 April 2006
Superbad," Vulgar yet hilarious
","Superbad is another one of those crude comedies in the tradition of Knocked Up, The 40 Year old Virgin, and American Pie. The story was written by Seth Rogen (yep that guy from Knocked Up) and his friend Evan Golberg. By all accounts it seems based on their lives in high school, and yes it is very vulgar, but that doesn't stop the movie from still being hilarious.Two teenagers Seth and Evan (Jonah Hill and Michael Cera) who have been friends forever are finally graduating from high school. After Seth is invited to a graduation party by Jules (Emma Stone) the girl he's been wanting to get with for a long time, both he and Evan are suddenly on a mission to provide alcohol for the party. Evan is of course not sure at first, but when Becca (Martha Maclsasc) the girl of his dreams tells him she's going to be there, he gladly accepts.With the help of their nerdy friend Fogell (Christopher Mintz-Plasse), who's getting a fake ID that will make it possible to get the alcohol, the plan is set. However, things quickly start to go wrong when Fogell returns with the fake ID with the hilarious one word name McLovin, and an absurd date of birth. It gets even worse when Fogell goes in to buy the alcohol and is assaulted by a robber who punches him and robs the store. The troubles just escalate when Fogell finds himself suddenly hanging out with two goofy police officers (Seth Rogen and Bill Hader in two hilarious roles) who were called to the crime scene and are glad to take Fogell where he needs to go, but maybe just not right away. Seth and Evan, who believe that Fogell is about to be arrested, panic and take a ride with some sinister individual who takes them to some seedy house party where some dangerous individuals are at. Do the three finally get to their destination? Do Seth and Evan hook up with the girls of their dreams and lose their virginity? I'll not spoil it.Of course the story isn't just about the three guys troubles with getting the alcohol for the party. It is also a story about the friendship between Seth and Evan. You see the two have been friends forever, and after graduation, Evan will be going to some big out of state college whereas Seth will be going to a local school. Both have issues on the subject, and both are frightened of what life will now be like without the other. The movie may be profane, and there are a lot of vulgarities to back this up, but it also has a heart. The underlining theme though, through all the crudeness, still falls back on true friendship.The acting was very well done, and the story, though unbelievably over the top, never lags. Both the writers (Seth Rogen and Evan Goldberg) and the director (Greg Mottola) manage to make this one of the better comedies of the year. I found that I liked it a little more than Knocked Up (another good comedy), but that is just one person's opinion.",8,0,5,19 August 2007
X-Men Origins: Wolverine," Rushed and not well thought out, but it has some good points
","Overall, X-Men origins Wolverine moves too fast and never establishes a main theme. THe story is overridden with many mutants, but other then Wolverine himself, we don't learn much about any of the other characters. Even Wolverine's story, the main character of the film, felt like it was missing a lot of information. I guess I could've accepted some of that if the action sequences were better, but even they seemed to not carry enough weight for the movie.I can't say I really disliked the movie. I enjoyed watching both WOlverine (Jackman) and Saber TOoth (Schreiber) chew up the scenery with one liners and some of their scenes, but this film could've been oh so much better. THe action scenes should've been more exciting, and the special effects weren't that great either. I know this movie cost a lot to make, and I found myself wondering where they spent the money at.My grade will be a 6 out of 10, and I think maybe I'm being a little easy on the film. For all those who liked the X-Men, X-2 is still the best of all four films. I even go as far as saying that X-Men Last Stand was better than Wolverine because the action scenes were much better.",6,2,6,2 May 2009
Terminator Salvation," Slightly disappointed with this (Spoilers only if you haven't seen Terminator 3)
","I was a little unhappy with Salvation for a few reasons, but there were some good things about the movie. THe action scenes were top notch. THe special effects had a gritty look, probably to give us the look of a world destroyed and overrun with machines, and that was a good thing as well. T4 is definitely a wonderful action epic, and Sam Worthington gives a good performance, but I still felt underwhelmed by the movie for the simple fact that the story had little substance. The other actors besides Worthington were rather shallow as well. Let's talk about the story first and why it was weak. I get that the world has ended, and the first three films gave us a lot of plot leading up to this. WHat I would've liked T4 to do was give us more of a story about Worthington's character and how he came to be what he is. I also would've liked to see a little back story that led to the point where JOhn COnnor (Bale) ends up being when we first see him is this bleak future. If you remember the ending in T3 the world was destroyed while COnnor and his girlfriend were saved in a bunker. T4 starts off with COnnor already pretty famous, as if he'd been doing this for years. What happened between T3 and the time before the events in T4? I would've liked to see more of this and maybe a little less special effects. The new Star Trek did this well. Now onto the acting. As I said above, with the exception of WOrthington, the rest of the acting was shallow and disappointing. Bale does not escape criticism here. He does a lot of shouting, but little else. THere's an excellent fight sequence involving him and a Terminator at the end, but nothing else he does really stands out. After Dark Knight, and his turn in other films, I know he can do better. Anton Yelchin plays Kyle Reese. Some people like his acting here, but like Bale, he did a lot of shouting and not much else. I liked his character in Star Trek a lot more. THe real hero of this film is Sam Worthington as Marcus Wright. A character who has some of his own secrets, and brings a lot to the table with his performance here.Good action scenes and good special effects are all to be found in T4. However if you're looking for a story of some kind and a little better acting from more than just one character, well you will be disappointed. Otherwise, knock yourself out.",6,0,1,30 May 2009
Pirates of the Caribbean: At World's End," About on the same par as the second film
","Pirates of The Caribbean, At Worlds End was a pretty good follow up to Dead Man's Chest. Both films were long and loaded with special effects, and all the same characters, including one from the first film, return for the third chapter in the Pirate series. Black Pearl was still my favorite of the three, but Worlds End and Dead Man's Chest were fitting sequels in their own right.Both Will and Elizabeth, with the help of Barbarossa from the first film, must travel to the ends of the world to release Jack Sparrow from his death and captivity in Davey Jones Locker. They must do this so they can bring Jack back because he holds one of the pieces of eight of the pirate kings. This is needed in order for the pirates to convene to a meeting in which they will decide if they should go to battle with Lord Beckett who has taken control of Davey Jones and the Flying Dutchmen. You see Lord Beckett wants to rule the seas, and in order to do this he must wipe out all the pirates. Of course the pirates don't want this, but they must find a way to get past all their backstabbing and work together. They must also decide if they want to release the water goddess Calypso from her human bonds and hope she helps them with beating Lord Beckett and Davey Jones. Of course the pirates have betrayed her just as Davey Jones has. So will she help them or just let them all try and kill each other?Confusing isn't it. I know, but Dead Mans Chest was pretty convoluted as well. There are so many plots and subplots with this third film, that it is hard to see everything clearly. Still the acting by the cast was well done, and the story, as confusing as it was, was still interesting for summer action fare. Add to this top notch special effects, and a final battle scene that was incredible, and you get a decent third film to one of the most famous trilogies ever.I must also remind you to stay after the credits have rolled because like the second film, this movie has a final scene which is a lot more interesting, and this one scene may just lead to a new chapter in the Pirate series. Oh I almost forgot, their is also a certain Rolling Stone that makes a cameo appearance. Watch out for that one as well.",7,0,2,29 May 2007
X-Men," X-Men had some enjoyable moments, but the storyline SUNK IT. No big spoilers here either, but just in case.
","I don't know what I can say about X-Men. I liked most of the performances and really enjoyed Hugh Jackman as Wolverine. There were a lot of exciting action sequences and the picture looked good visually, but what lowered my expectations about it was the weak storyline involving Magneto (Ian McKellen) using Rogue(Anna Paquin) and her mutant ability of absorption.His plan was to let Rogue absorb his magnetic powers in order to change many of the world leaders into mutants so then they wouldn't pass the Mutant Registration Act. This would then likely kill Rogue, which was one of the reasons why Magneto wouldn't do it himself. He did it earlier in the movie to someone and was nearly killed doing so. I don't know how his magnetic powers, with the help of the machine he built, would be able to do this. It was never really explained, and the ending was over too abruptly. I was expecting more an never got it.X-Men still had some good moments though. I just wish the story could've been done better. It was almost like it was just thrown together because the writers were running out of time or something. The sequel was much better and even more entertaining.",6,2,4,20 April 2006
Spider-Man 3," Compared to 2, this sequel was weak
","Yeah I know. Some people are going to say that this is the best Spiderman yet. I know for certain it will beat out the first two films at the box office, but that still doesn't make it as good as Spiderman 2, and it's not quite on the same par as the first film either.The problem this time around is that there are entirely too many sub-plots and villains. The last two films dealt with only one villain, and that made it possible for character development. Doc Ock was still the best villain, but with this film we have three separate villains, and in a movie that was 2 and a half hours long, that still wasn't enough time to make them interesting.The main stars suffer a little bit here as well. The performance by Tobey Maquire wasn't as strong, and both Kirsten Dunst and James Franco were simply one note. I could tell that their performances were strained, and that only proves that the rumors may be true about the main stars not returning for part 4 if there is one.However, I must give kudos to the special effects. They were by far some of the best yet, and with a budget at over 250 million dollars, I can see why. But special effects alone do not make good movies. Character development and interesting story lines will always beat them out, and that is the part of the movie that rings a little hollow. There were also some nice action scenes, but even then there was nothing that really jumped out at you. Some of the scenes in Spiderman 3 were reminiscent of part 1 and 2. There was nothing original, and there were no wow scenes like the way Spiderman stopped the speeding train in part 2, or how he seemed to almost fly down the street on his web lines trying to catch the man who was thought to have killed his uncle in part 1.Sadly, Spidermen 3 doesn't quite make the grade, but I have no doubt it will still break box office records once its theater run is over.",6,3,6,8 May 2007
Resident Evil: Extinction," Somewhat better than #2, but my favorite is still the first
","None of the Resident Evil films have been great. Part 1 was interesting and caught my attention, part 2 was boring with some nice scenes, but nothing good enough to recommend. Now we have part 3. I would say the third is somewhat better than the second movie, but not as good as the first film.In the finale in the series, mankind is mostly extinct except for a few survivors. Some of the survivors are living in the world and continue to exist by not staying in one area for too long. Other survivors include the last of the Umbrella Corporation which caused the T-virus to escape in the first place. They live underground and continue to plot how to continue living in a world over run by the undead. The Umbrella group's plan is to control the undead and train them in ways that will domesticate them and make them easily controlled, but to hell with the human survivors. This is something I don't understand. Why try to domesticate flesh craving zombies? Why not help the human survivors to extinguish the zombies once and for all and try to start a new world? That's one problem with this movie.Alice (Milla Jovovich in the role for the third time in the series)is the wild card. She wants to wipe out the zombies and help the human survivors, and now she has psionic powers to go with her fighting skills. She can suddenly create forcefields as well, but never seems to use these powers as she should. With her powers, she should be able to rid the world of the zombies, but she instead uses her battling skills with nasty blades and guns to kill them when using her powers would be more effective. I know, she doesn't seem to have good control over the new abilities, but you would think she would be willing to learn. After all, these psionic powers would make it much easier and more effective to deal with the zombie plaque, but then we wouldn't be able to see blood spray as she chops off heads and other limbs. Sigh.The story is not real strong either, and the secondary characters are never really given any depth whatsoever. The action is nice and there are several shocks and surprises along the way, but it is never enough to keep the flow of the almost nonexistent story moving along in an interesting way. The story has something to do with heading to Alaska which may still be free of the zombie plaque. However, it is never given much thought.Overall, Resident Evil Extinction is slightly better than the second film, but it still fails to match the first film. The story is weak and the characters, with the exception of Alice whom we've gotten to know in the two films previously, are also flawed. Of course Ali Larter as Claire, the leader of the band of survivors outside of Alice, offers something interesting to the story, but it is never enough. We wonder how she became this leader, but her story, like so much else in this movie, is never explored. I recommended the first film just barely, but I still cannot recommend this film even though it is slightly better than the second film.",5,5,11,22 September 2007
Zodiac," A good fact-based mystery
","Based on Robert Graysmith's novel, this was a really good mystery involving detectives from different districts, a reporter, and a cartoonist. In fact is wasn't really about the killer at all, but more about the obsession of the four main characters as they took years to try an solve the mystery of the infamous Zodiac killer, only to never find enough evidence to ever capture him.In the late 1960s, a killer calling himself only the Zodiac went on a rampage killing from between six to a possible 100 people through the years. Four men, a cartoonist (Jake Gyllenhaal) a reporter (Robert Downey Junior) and two FBI agents (Mark Ruffalo and Anthony Edwards) took years to discover who the killer was, but he never was caught. There were suspects, but there was never enough evidence to prove anything.Jake Gyllenhaal played Robert Graysmith. At the beginning of the movie he is more like a secondary character as the story focuses mainly on the two detectives and the reporter as they try to solve the case in their own ways. After years of trying and never able to capture the Zodiac killer, they all let the case fade out. It is during the last half of the movie that Gyllenhaal's character suddenly takes center stage and the other three become secondary. It was a clever trick and one that worked beautifully.This movie is more about obsession than anything else. It shows how obsession can ruin lives and lead to eminent disaster for those involved. It also shows what some people will do to try and prove something that might not be worth the time anymore.Zodiac is not the perfect mystery though. It never did explain those calls that Gyllenhaal's character was getting when he was still working on the case in those later years. Were they calls from the Zodiac killer or not? Also I couldn't accept the somewhat upbeat ending which explained what the characters were doing presently after the movie ended. Otherwise, it was a good movie.",8,1,5,5 March 2007
The Terminator," The Terminator is a great science fiction film that crosses into other genres as well
","The Terminator, one of James Cameron's greatest films, has everything that you could look for in a movie. It has romance, science fiction, horror, and action all rolled into one fantastic film. There isn't much let up, much like Aliens, a film made two years later and also one of his best.Sarah Connor (Linda Hamilton in one of her best roles) has no idea what's in store for her. She a waitress just trying to get by, but her life's about to be turned upside down. Unknown to her in the present she is, in the not too distant future, going to give birth to a son named John Connor who will be an influential leader in the year 2029 and help the rebels defeat the machines and the super computer Skynet.Skynet knows this and sends one of it's virtually indestructible cyborgs (Arnold Swarzennegger in his greatest role) back to Sarah Connor's present to kill her before she can conceive. However the rebels have sent one of their own back to protect her, a man named Reese (Michael Biehn). What follows is one of the most creative concepts for a movie. This movie is filled with almost non-stop action, and on top of all that it is a romance as well as a science fiction or horror movie. Take your pick.The acting in this film is great, and Cameron's pacing is perfect in that he knows when to slow down and when to pick it back up. My only problem with the movie was some of the special effects now seem dated. However, you got to realize that this movie was made back in 1984, so I can forgive it that much.This is one of my favorite films, and it is probably Swarzennegger's best movie to date. Yes I like Terminator 2, but it wasn't quite as good as the original even though the special effects had, of course, improved.Some of the concepts of time seem a little much. But you have to realize that this is, at its heart, mainly a science fiction film, and one of the best ever made. I loved it and would recommend it to anybody.",10,1,2,1 March 2006
Cloverfield," Godzilla meets the Blair Witch in a surreal experience
","Note: To anybody complaining about motion sickness, you all knew months in advance from the trailers what kind of movie this was going to be, so I don't get the complaints. Now on with the review.Cloverfield was a surreal experience told from the point of view of a movie camera. It is a cross between The Blair Witch Project and Godzilla. I found the movie very effective and did not once feel sick because I knew what to expect.A group of friends are throwing a going away party for their friend Rob who is going to Japan for a job. WHile enjoying the party a creature the size of Godzilla attacks New York City. During all this time and beyond one of the characters, his name is Hud Platt (TJ Miller) films everything from the beginning of the attack and on into the next day. During this time him and four friends go on a trek through a demolished New York to save a girl who is wounded. ALong the way they come up against several obstacles which include the giant creature, mini-monsters which are falling off of it, and all kinds of destruction which include the Brooklyn Bridge, two skyscrapers which have collapsed on each other, and of course the head of the Statue of Liberty which is the first scene of destruction in the movie.Some will wonder why these five people risk their lives to save one girl who will most likely be dead by the time they get there? I'm not going to say if she's dead or not, that will be up to you to see the movie. WHat I will say is that Rob (Michael Stahl David), who had an affair with the wounded girl, is in love with her and let her leave his party on a bad note and feels guilty. The others follow him because he is their friend and they don't want him to go off by himself on such a dangerous mission.From the point of view of the movie camera, the movie has a nice frantic pace that fits in perfectly with reality TV. The character filming everything also makes it more interesting because he has a sense of humor which helps us to get involved with their plight through the devastation. There are quite a few surprises along the way, and some that you won't be expecting when they happen.Cloverfield, like Blair Witch, is a memorable movie. Like Blair Witch, it makes you feel like you are a part of the action and right there with them as they struggle onward. There are questions that I have about the movie though? One in particular would have to do with injured characters who are able to continue moving forward after sustaining some devastating injuries that would make it impossible for them to even move a little without passing out. Also, there is no way the battery in that movie camera would've lasted seven hours. It is these moments that take away from the reality that the writer and director were going for, but I can forgive it somewhat.And for those of you wondering if you see the creature or not. Yes you do. There aren't a lot of scenes though, and even the scenes you do get are somewhat blurred. The director's approach of less being better holds true. This movie is also rated PG-13, proving once again that you don't need a whole lot of gore to make an effective horror film.",8,0,5,21 January 2008
Silent Hill," Starts out well only to fall apart near the end
","I enjoyed the atmosphere of Silent Hill and the visuals. It starts off as a mystery that keeps us in suspense for a long while. It works well when keeping us in the dark, making us second guess what's going on. I liked it a lot up until the point where it suddenly starts giving us answers. After that, the movie starts to unravel into a very gory conclusion that simply takes away from the movie's finer points. I didn't mind the ending, but I think this movie would've worked better if it had not given us so many answers. Granted, I have never played the game, so maybe I'm being a little too harsh.Still on to the plot. Rose (Radha Mitchell) is the mother of Sharon (Jodelle Ferland). Sharon has been going into trances and sleepwalking and muttering things about a town called Silent Hill. Rose, refusing to accept that her daughter needs to see a psychiatrist, decides to take off with Sharon to the town of Silent Hill to get answers, leaving her husband Christopher (Sean Bean)in the dark. Christopher, once he finds out where they are going, goes after them, but neither he nor Rose knows what terrible events transpired at the town of Silent Hill.Soon Rose is looking for her daughter in the town of Silent Hill after an accident in which Sharon disappears. She is soon joined by a traffic cop (Laurie Holden) who while pursuing Rose on a high speed chase up to Silent Hill was in an accident herself. At first the traffic cop doesn't believe what Rose has to say, but together they discover that Silent Hill is not your average town, and suddenly the officer is helping Rose to find Sharon.I do believe this movie was a little overlong, and I still can't accept the answers we are finally given. But other than that, Silent Hill had a lot of good things going for it. Still can I recommend it after seeing it? Not quite because I think it would've worked better if it had remained more mysterious and less gory. In fact, the last few minutes of the movie would've had more impact had the movie left us more in the dark.",6,0,0,4 September 2006
Crash," A dose of Reality.
","Crash is definitely a strong dose of reality. There is no subtlety about this movie. It is so in your face that you can't help but think about it and remember it for a very long time.Crash tells the interconnecting stories of a group of people from different ethnic groups who live in LA and have there different stereotypes about each other. In the next 36 hours they are all about to collide in a way that will change them forever. There is no holding back with these people. Many of them are very blatant about how they feel, and the opinions they have about one another will have us, as viewers, thinking that we aren't that much different with our own feelings.The acting is the best part of Crash. Everybody is given depth and we learn to understand why they feel the way they do. But once we think we have the characters figured out, we are thrown a curve ball, and our opinions are suddenly changed about them.The movie also contains some very powerful scenes. Two in particular stand out in my mind. One involves and overturned SUV where a victim has to be saved before the SUVs leaking gas catches fire. The other involves a father and his daughter which begins at the movie's earliest proceedings as a tender moment that will eventually lead to a big payoff near the film's end.Even though Crash is a well done film, it still contains some predictable scenes which take away from it's power. It also becomes a little too preachy, but none of this really makes the film boring or too overwhelming. Definitely recommended.",9,0,5,25 March 2006
Pan's Labyrinth," An incredible film
","One of the best movies that I've seen all year. It has wonderful artistic scenery, excellent acting, and for a fairy tale like story mixing with the reality of the Spanish Civil War, it works wonderfully.The story involves a little girl who goes with her pregnant mother to live with her new father. Unknown to both of them, the new father is Captain Vidal(Sergi Lopez), a ruthless man in charge of destroying the rebellion which surrounds them in the forest. The first scenes involving him are all that is needed to show what evil lurks inside him, but we eventually see more as the movie goes on.Ofelia(Ivana Baquero), is the young girl now living a life she is not happy with. She seems to create another world for herself where she is looked at as a princess who must complete three tasks in order to join the Faun(Doug Jones) who gives her these tasks in order to live this happier existence. We, as the viewers, find ourselves wondering if maybe the fairy tale is real. Near the end we will see the truth, but I am not about to divulge that secret.As Ofelia lives in this other world, which could be true or not, we learn more about the other story. That story involves the rebels in the surrounding forest, a maid named Mercedes (Maribel Verdu), and Captain Vidal. There are secrets involving some of the characters, but as I stated above, I will not give any of them away.Overall, this is probably one of the best movies I've seen all year. The director Guillermo del Toro, is wonderful with his cast and all his art designs. The Pale man (Doug Jones again) is definitely one of the scariest creations ever made. The acting is excellent, and the pacing fantastic. The only slight I had with the movie was some of the over the top violence, but other than that, this movie is incredible.",9,1,3,28 January 2007
Knocked Up," A little over-hyped but good
","Knocked up ended up being a better movie then I thought it was going to be. But when I compare it to the best comedies, it would be middle of the road. I'm surprised the average movie critic grade is an A-. To me it is more of a B and nothing better than that.I think a lot of critics liked it because of the cast, and they were quite good. Katherine Heigl, Seth Rogen, Paul Rudd and Leslie Mann give very good performances, and the supporting cast is just as well, including the Seth Rogen character's loser buddies. They were all interesting in their own right.The gags and gross out jokes, along with the cast, manage to keep the movie interesting for a comedy that is over two hours long. Yes I'll admit I was never bored with the movie, but I did not crack up in guffaws of laughter like some of the better comedies use to make me do.The plot is simple, a guy and girl meet, get drunk, have sex without a condom, and a few months later girl discover's she's pregnant. She wants to raise the baby and loser boy dad decides that he's on board with her. The story goes from there, and you can fill in the usual plot details.I liked the movie. Like I said it was entertaining and the cast was incredible, but the story was nothing new. I also liked the dialoque and some of the inside jokes, but an average grade of A- by critics, and 8.4 out of 10 on IMDb? No, that's a little too high. 7 out of 10.",7,1,3,11 June 2007
Alien," The beginning of a memorable series
","Alien was the first film that started it all. It gave us Aliens in 1986 and then two lesser sequels in the proceeding years. One can not review Aliens and not review Alien because both films go together so perfectly. Even though both films had their different styles, they both had Sigourney Weaver and one of the most fearsome creatures to ever grace the big screen. It's also my second most favorite horror movie of all time behind Jaws, a film I saw when I was just a wee lad.The crew of the Nostromo, a large space freighter that looks immense and incredibly scary thanks to director Ridley Scott's camera work, is awaken early from hyper sleep to investigate what seems to be a distress signal coming from a nearby planet. After a rough landing on the desolate planet, three of the crew members go out to investigate and find a large spaceship. However this is not all they find. Soon one of the crew members, who gets a little too curious, finds himself in a coma-like state with something attached to his face. He is soon brought back to the Nostromo by his shipmates, where they go about analyzing him to see what has happened. But this crew of working men and women have no clue what grisly horrors soon await them because they are no longer alone. Something dark and dangerous with no remorse for humankind will soon be stalking them one by one, and there seems to be nothing on board that is able to stop it.This movie was fantastic in every way. Ridley Scott uses mood and shadows as well as size to make the Nostromo look like the biggest, scariest haunted house ever. He also uses fabulous camera work to get his points across as well.The suspense in this movie builds and builds, and the creature is kept mostly in the shadows until when it attacks. And it attacks with a lethal efficiency. It is never seen for long periods of time, and this works perfectly. Like Spielberg with Jaws, Scott realizes that what is unseen is always more terrifying. One of the most effective murder scenes in this film is unseen, but we clearly hear the horrifying screams and panting of the victim and know that something horrible is happening.I can go on in on about this movie. I can talk about the music score which adds more dread to this film, and I can talk about the acting which was superb, but it would take up way too much space. I can also go on about the Oscar worthy special effects which are probably the best ever for 1979, but I won't. Lets just say this. If you like horror movies that build suspense and are not filled with senseless gore that looks unrealistic, then you are in for a treat. By the way this film does have some bloody scenes. One of the best involves sitting around a dinner table while everybody is eating. Yuk.Many people always compare Alien and Aliens. Some like Aliens the most and some like Alien the most. Both are classic sci-fi horror films by two different directors, and both get my highest marks, but if I had to chose, Alien would be my first choice, followed closely by Aliens.",10,10,17,2 March 2006
Shutter Island," Scorsese delivers again
","Though not a masterpiece, Shutter Island delivers the goods and left me pretty much satisfied with what I witnessed on the screen. I don't believe Martin Scorsese has ever done a bad movie. I even enjoyed Cape Fear, which seems to be the movie which most critic's believe is his weakest film, and Shutter Island gives you what you want in a suspenseful thriller.It's 1954 and Teddy Daniels (Leonardo DiCaprio) and Chuck Aule (Mark Ruffalo) are detectives investigating the disappearance of one of the inmates on Shutter Island, which is an asylum for the violent and criminally insane. THe problem is that Teddy has skeletons of his own in the closet, and it is these same skeletons that hinder his investigation somewhat because he has nightmares of World War 2 when he was involved with liberating a concentration camp in Germany. He also has dreams of his dead wife who was seemingly killed in a fire set by a person who might or might not be an inmate on Shutter Island as well. WHat is real, and what is not? THese are questions that Teddy asks himself and make him feel as if maybe he is becoming a little unhinged. THe final act comes as somewhat of a surprise, but it was something that I saw coming nearly a half hour in when the first walking nightmare, as another character mentions, appears. Still, after the movie, I found myself asking some more questions, and they are questions I won't mention because I don't want to give any secrets away for those who haven't seen it. I'll just say that as a thriller filled with mysteries, this film works real well.Shutter Island is a movie packed with suspense, and it delivers the shocks as well, keeping you on the edge of your seat. The score worked well with the suspense, and the acting, including two key roles by Ben Kingsley and Max Von Sydow as the doctors on Shutter Island, were all well done. Even the minor roles worked effectively to keep the pace and suspense of the film strong throughout the movie's entire run time.With the exception of the finale being a little expected, I still found Shutter Island to be a very well made movie. It ratchets up the suspense and then shocks you even more. THat is the way thrillers involving mystery should always be handled. Not Scorsese's greatest film, but not a weak movie either and better than many other movies of the same caliber. THis is one that is definitely recommended.",8,2,6,28 February 2010
The Godfather: Part II," A very good sequel, but I still prefer the first film
","Both The Godfather and The Godfather part II are really good films. Both have excellent performances, and both films move at that same leisurely pace that never becomes boring. But the film I prefer is the first, even though the second is more detailed about what the Corleone family does. I guess I prefer it because it was more original, and Marlon Brando, who doesn't appear in the second even though Francis Ford Coppola tried getting him to reprise his role at the end of the movie, isn't there.With The Godfather part II we have two stories going on. And that is the other weakness of the second film. One involves Michael Corleone (Pacino)as the new Don maintaining his power and pushing to keep his control. The second involves the early life of Vito Corleone and how he became the Godfather of the first film. Robert DeNiro, in an exceptional performance, plays the part of the young Vito Corleone. Both stories are played back and forth, and as big events happen in one the plot shifts to the other, which is a little distracting. I would've preferred that Copolla stuck with one story instead because it would've worked a lot better. Of course I can understand why he did it. He wanted to get two of the biggest stars of their generation together in one film, and both Pacino and DeNiro were up to the challenge even though Brando was still irreplaceable.DeNiro looks really young, and Al Pacino looks much older than in the first, even though both films were only separated by two years. I don't know if it was clever make-up or just Pacino's phenomenal acting that made it so.The ending of The Godfather part II is incredibly strong though as it shifts back to a time when Michael was certain he was never going to be part of the family business, only to shift back to the present as he sits by himself in his home after key events have happened. It was like a realization as Pacino's character completely accepts what he has become. Strong movie definitely, but the first film, in my opinion, is still better. However both films still should be seen. You can't just watch one and not the other. Godfather part II may not be the greatest sequel ever, but it is still one incredible experience.",8,1,3,14 April 2006
The Bourne Ultimatum," One of the best films of the summer so far
","The Bourne Ultimatum is an intense thriller. It is action packed, well acted, and moves at a brisk pace that never slows down for very long. It is definitely one of the best movies of the summer so far. Matt Damon returns to his role as Jason Bourne. He is still running from the government and even more dangerous assassins. All of which are out to kill him. He is also still searching for information on his past for which he only remembers bits and pieces in hazy flashbacks. This has been the point of all three movies, and the conclusion to this fine trilogy left me very satisfied, especially the final scenes of which I will say no more.Matt Damon has made the role of Jason Bourne his own. I couldn't see anybody else in the role. Joan Allen also returns as Pamela Landy, the same person who had been searching for Bourne through the first two movies. There are some twists on her character this time around, but I will not spoil it for anybody who wants to see the movie. Julia Stiles also returns as Nicky Parsons. The acting was very good all around, including the smaller roles. David Strathaim in particular has a good part as the slimy CIA agent Noah Vosen who wants Bourne dead.Like I said above, this movie is all out action with great fight scenes and car chases. The director Paul Greengrass keeps the pace moving. It rarely slows down, and when it does it is only for a short period before the action starts up again. His use of steady cam for many scenes was incredible, and I know there are some people who will say the use of the steady cam was headache inducing, but to me I think it worked perfectly. It added to the frenetic pace and made the movie seem more realistic. The fight scenes and the car chases where the steady cam was used the most worked splendidly. The final car chase scene is one of the best put to celluloid.The Bourne Ultimatum is not quite perfect, and I think it's because there was no witty dialog and it lacked a sense of humor. Most action films usually have these things, but then again none of the Bourne films have ever had anything that resembled that. It also fumbled a little near the end. However, putting these tiny flaws to the side, I would still say that The Bourne Ultimatum is one of the best films of the summer, and you can't go wrong there.",8,0,2,4 August 2007
28 Weeks Later," A fine sequel to a fine 1st film
","28 weeks Later was a fine sequel to an equally good 28 Days Later. It is not too often that a sequel matches the first film, but I would say 28 Weeks does just that.A portion of London, with help from the American military, has been quarantined off from the rest of the world. It has been cleaned of all the infected, and is a place where normal people can adjust to somewhat normal lives again. However something happens, you will have to see the movie to find out, and a mistake leads to the once clean area being overrun again by those infected with the Rage Virus which started it all in the first movie.Where 28 Days Later moved slowly and built tension with interesting characters, 28 Weeks Later starts out fast with one of the best scenes in the entire movie, and never really lets up for its duration. The acting was well done and the pacing phenomenal. I actually cared about the characters this time around as well, and this will usually lead to good things.Some people have complained that the rapid moving camera angles were a little nauseating, but I found that these scenes added to the chaos of the film and helped the quick fire pace that, among many others things, was one of this movie's strong points. The beginning of the film used this the most effectively, but the other scenes weren't bad either.28 Days Later was not the perfect horror film, but it was one of the best of its kind. 28 Weeks Later, in my opinion, was its equal. Yeah there were some things I found hard to believe. Like how the two teenagers managed to escape the quarantine, and how the infection was finally able to spread, but I can forgive the movie these small things because the bigger and better things far outweigh them. Go see it. It's well worth it.",8,0,2,15 May 2007
The Thing," Truly Terrifying but has a few flaws
","John Carpenter's 'The Thing' is my second favorite movie by him with the original 'Halloween' being my favorite. The movie is filled with paranoia and isolation. The pace is a little slow sometime, but for the most part it moves effectively, starting at the beginning with a scene of nothing but white snow and mountains. After a moment you hear a helicopter and shooting, and suddenly a Husky comes into view, running from the people in the helicopter who are trying to kill it. I watched this movie when I was young, and seeing any kind of dog being shot at made me dislike the people in the helicopter. The dog runs to another base where he is immediately saved and the Norwegians in the helicopter meet there demise with the helicopter blowing up and one of them being shot between the eyes. I almost cheered at seeing this. However, not long after, the dog is found creeping around the base as if stalking, and suddenly alarm bells went off in my head. Something was definitely not right with this innocent looking dog, and I began to understand why those Norwegians might have been trying to kill it. Soon after we find out why, and suddenly all heck breaks loose because that innocent looking dog was really an imitation of something much worse. A thing from outer space that could imitate any living creature. I really don't have to say more, but this movie, which scared the crap out of me as a child, has some of the most gut wrenching and horrifying special effects ever. They still hold up well today and out do much of the CGI which now dominates films. Carpenter has once again shown how good he is at directing horror films, and Rob Bottin shows us more horrifying make-up effects then what he gave us in 'The Howling.' The sad thing though is I could never warm to any of the characters. MacCready, as played by Kurt Russel, was the only one I ever really cared about. The others were very cold, almost robotic. And the way they all seemed to go off so easily knowing that they could be imitated made them a little implausible as well. Other than that, I would put this movie in my top 15 horror films. It would be in top 5 easily if the characters had all been more interesting, but the 1982 version of 'The Thing' is, in my opinion, still a better movie than the 1951 original.",8,0,1,16 April 2005
The Hills Have Eyes," A Good Remake
","I enjoyed the remake of Hills Have Eyes. I thought the acting was above average and enjoyed the way director Alexander Aja built the suspense in the film. I can't remember the original real well, but this movie was much better than some of the more recent horror films. I was way better than The Fog, and much better than Cursed, another Wes Craven film.The most surprising part about this movie was the acting. I actually felt sympathy for all the members of the family, and was glad to see them fight back against the mutants. I've actually grown sick of movies where the characters are simply put in a film only to be hacked to bits. However there are deaths of course, but I will not give any of that information away.I also enjoyed Alexander Aja's camera work in this film. I enjoyed the various angles he employed to make the film more disturbing. The movie also had a gritty quality about it, which only added to the films overall creepiness. In fact it kind of reminded me of the original Texas Chainsaw Massacre, and The Hitcher. I never saw the remake of Texas Chainsaw Massacre though.The plot of course is simple. A family is crossing the New Mexico desert on vacation and stops at a gas station where they get directions on how to get to California. The weird gas station attendant at first gives them the safe direction to go, but changes his mind when he discovers that maybe one of the members of the family has learn his little secret. We already know what that secret is when we are first introduced to this strange person. They follow the shortcut he gives them and mayhem en shews from there as they become stranded in the middle of nowhere. The vacationing family soon discovers that they are not alone and are being stalked by a murderous mutated family that lives in the hills surrounding them.Very effective film with many gruesome scenes, Hills Have Eyes is definitely a movie that horror movie buffs should enjoy. Its starts with some very violent scenes and then builds from there into one of the better horror movies to come around in a long while. It also gives us a back story about the mutated family which deals with the nuclear bomb testing that went on around the area and how the bomb testing is what caused the mutations, making them what they are today.",7,0,0,12 March 2006
Knowing," An enjoyable movie
","When I saw Knowing, I wasn't expecting much more than a sort of popcorn film like Day After Tomorrow. With Alex Proyas directing, the same director who brought us the wonderful Dark CIty as well as THe Crow, I should've known better. Knowing is not just a simple popcorn movie, it goes much deeper, just as Dark City did.Nicholas Cage plays John Koestler, a professor at a college and also a widowed father who is taking care of his young son Caleb (Chandler Canterbury). Fifty years ago a little girl, after hearing whispering voices, wrote random numbers on a sheet of paper which were buried in a time capsule. As you know, it is John's son who ends up with those numbers after the time capsule is pulled up in present day. Caleb takes the sheet of paper home with him and lets his father see it to see what those numbers might mean. John at first is upset with his son for not returning the sheet of numbers back to the school, but soon after while in a drinking binge, something he does a lot, he comes across certain familiar numbers and begins and investigation. WHat he discovers is that the numbers are actually dates of natural disasters as well as how many died and where they all happened. What's surprising is that all these events were prophesized by that little girl named Lucinda(Lara RObinson) fifty years before any of the events took place. THere are a few left on the list, which haven't occurred yet, and this leads to JOhn making an effort to stop them from happening. He enlists the aid of Lucinda's daughter Diana(Rose Byrne) to try and understand it all. Diana also has a daughter named Abby (Lara Robinson again) who seems to connect with Caleb in very important ways. This eventually leads all four down a path headed for a surprising conclusion. I will say no more for fear of spoiling what's to come.THe acting in this movie was very well done. ALl the characters, including the two children, pulled their parts off well. SOme people complain about Cage, but he strikes the right notes here as a widowed father drowning himself in alcohol because of the death of his wife, only to improve once he realizes where everything is leading. THere are of course mysterious figures, just like the strangers in Dark City, who are more then what they seem.Knowing has a lot of religious undertones. THis may be one of the reasons why people might be turned off by it. As I've read some critics reviews, I am already seeing a lot of negativity. It's a shame because Knowing goes much deeper than a lot of science fiction movies ever do. It is thoughtful and engaging, and I think that a lot of people will be talking about this movie for a long time.SOme will read this review and wonder why I didn't give it a 10. Here's the reason why, and it involves the conclusion and the special effects. I had no problem with the religious undertones at all, but at the same time I think knowing less about the mysterious figures might've had more of an impact on viewers. THe final reveal becomes a little distracting. Of course none of this can really take a way from an otherwise good movie.On a final note, even though some of the visuals were weak, the sound effects were quite awesome.",8,1,7,23 March 2009
The Shining," Good but not one of the greatest horror films ever
","I enjoyed The SHining to a point. The imagery was well done, especially the beginning when you see and aerial view of the car climbing ominous mountains that seem to want to swallow it whole, and also the scenes in the Overlook Hotel itself. All these things lend great atmosphere to the movie, as well as the musical score, but other than that, this movie didn't terrify me like the best horror films do. THere are just long points in the movie where nothing really happens. THere is dread, I'll agree, but there are also other scenes that just don't go anywhere. THe interview itself in the beginning seems too drawn out, taking up entirely too much of the movie if you ask me.Some people want to talk about the acting, but it seemed entirely too wooden. Shelly Duvall as Wendy is weak and dull, and Jack Nicholson as Jack Torrance doesn't become interesting until he starts going crazy and acting like he does in most of his movies. Danny Lloyd, who plays the son Danny, has a telepathic ability called the Shining and has daily conversations with an imaginary friend named Tony. THis could've been a little more interesting, but never goes far enough to really catch your interest.THe plot is simple enough. Jack Torrance is offered a job as caretaker of the Overlook Hotel, and brings his wife and son with him because it will be many months of seclusion with just the three of them in a large ominous hotel. THe set-up is great, and Stanley Kubrick uses the steady cam to perfection in this movie to show us how spooky this large hotel is. As Jack slowly goes insane he starts seeing the ghosts that haunt this large hotel which comes first in the form of one ghostly bartender and then transforms into a whole ballroom of spooks. It is only Danny though, with THe Shining, who sees the twin girls. Many of you already know what happened to them, but I will not spoil it for those who haven't. THere is also the telepathic link that Danny has with the hotel's cook named Dick Halloran and played by Scathman Crothers. Once again not much is given about this special ability shared between the two. It is glanced over while Dick and Danny talk alone for the first time at the beginning of the movie, but otherwise goes nowhere else, except to bring Dick back from Florida when things go very bad closer to the end.As I've said, the setting is great, the visuals are wondrous at building dread and atmosphere, but the acting and script are rather weak because nothing is ever explained and the actors, other than Nicholson's character, really never change. Then again, upon first seeing Jack Torrance, I thought he was a little loopy then and just becomes way more loopy as the long drawn out story pushes to the end. In my opinion The SHining has enough good points to be recommended, but can not quite match the perfection of a movie like Alien which also starts out slowly, but becomes much more fast paced and terrifying as it leads to its conclusion, and it also has better acting.",7,0,1,13 November 2009
Wanted," Totally ridiculous movie but still fun
","Wanted is one of the most over the top films I've seen in a good long time. There is no real logic to it, but the director Timur Bekmambetor, who did the Day Watch and Night Watch films, never tries to take his movie seriously. The characters don't either, and seem to be enjoying themselves immensely, so I decided I would watch this movie and not take it seriously either. The three main stars, James McAvoy, Morgan Freeman, and Angelina Jolie do well with their roles, but it is McAvoy who really steals the show from the rest. I enjoyed it.Wesley Gibson (McAvoy) is an account manager at an office. He is neurotic and allows his boss, girlfriend, and best friend to walk all over him. His life changes however when he meets Fox (Jolie), and he soon discovers that he has superhuman abilities. It isn't long before he is recruited as an assassin into the 'Fraternity' which is a secret society led by Sloan (Freeman) and has been around for 1000 years. All the other people in this society have the same abilities as Wesley, and they use their abilities to make life better for normal people. There are also a couple more surprises which I will not reveal.This movie is nonstop action with some snappy dialogue, especially from Wesley. The other's have their time in the sun as well, but like I said earlier, McAvoy, who has never starred in an action movie with such intensity, shines the brightest. The stunts are unbelievable and mostly CGI, but they work well in a movie like this. I was never bored, and really loved the final scene at the end of the movie.If you are stressed at work and have always wanted to get even with co-workers that you don't like and know you never could, watch Wanted and you will feel much better. I must also insist that you do not take this movie seriously. If you do you will most likely hate it. Have fun.",7,2,7,30 June 2008
Terminator 2: Judgment Day," Another splendid film by Cameron
","James Cameron just keeps putting out hit after hit. After the success of 1984s The Terminator, and 1986s Aliens, Cameron brings us another hit film with the sequel to The Terminator.Back in 1984 Skynet sent a cyborg back from the future to kill Sarah Connor before she conceived a son that would grow up to lead the resistance and defeat the machines. It failed. Now Skynet has sent back a more advanced and even deadlier Terminator, called the T-1000, to kill Sarah's son John (Edward Furlong), who is now a young teenager with an attitude and living with foster parents. However the rebels were once again able to send someone back to protect John Connor. What follows is one of the most action packed films to ever hit the screen.The special effects in T2 are much improved over the old 1984 film, and the pacing, classic Cameron, is just as well as in the earlier film. However this time around the acting by Linda Hamilton seems a little too forced, and the storyline doesn't resonate as well as in the earlier film. What would, since the earlier film had such a unique story. The only thing T2 could do, as a sequel, is follow the story and keep us interested. It does all those things, but it can never quite match the ideas that were brought forth in the original film because after all it is just a second part to that movie.Arnold Swarzennegger's role in this film can't quite reach the pinnacle of success of the first film either because here he is made into a good guy as protector of John. Since the new Terminator is so much more advanced, Arnold is kind of made to look a little weak here, and that takes some of the edge away from his character. After all, in the original he was made into this almost indestructible machine that kept coming at you and never stopped. It was fearsome and incredibly scary. He no longer has that now as the good guy. But Robert Patrick, as the advanced T-1000, was perfect for the role. He is just as cold and unforgiving as Arnold was in the first film, but he can morph into anything, including family and friends, and that makes him even more deadly because you never know who or what he could be.I thoroughly enjoyed Terminator 2. It was a fantastic film, and I saw it more than once, so that tells you how much I liked it. The visuals were stunning for 1991, but I can't quite give it classic status like The Terminator and Aliens for reasons mentioned above. Still this is a thrilling experience, and many people did indeed like it more than the first film. I guess it depends on what you're looking for in a sci-fi action adventure. And this one delivers the goods.",8,2,2,3 March 2006
Apocalypse Now," One of the Greatest War Films ever made
","There is not much more you can say about Apocalypse Now. Some people on the message boards are talking about which scenes in the movie affected them the most. Me, I can't name just one scene because there were so many. I'll name a few though. The first scene with Kurtz was memorable, the helicopters coming in to attack while Flight of The Valkeryes is playing is another. The Vietnamize boat where Willard ends up killing a wounded Vientnam woman after everybody on the boat with her has been shot by his group. The bridge scene and the utter chaos when we learn that there is no leader for those guys protecting the bridge. The tiger, the scenery. I can go on and on. That's because Apocalypse Now is one of those rare war movies that just sweeps you into the plot with its epic storyline and doesn't let go.The story involves Captain Willard (Martin Sheen) who is given the duty of going into the jungles of Cambodia to kill one Lieutenant Kurtz (Marlon Brando) because the U.S. military believe that he has gone totally insane and is not looking out for his country's best interests anymore. Willard takes the job, and along the way runs into all kinds of trouble and horror. His mission, on a boat, leads him deeper and deeper into darkness until eventually he finds Kurtz.Francis Ford Coppola based his story of the Vietnam war on the novel Heart of Darkness which was written by Joseph Conrad. His own story follows that novel rather closely, and just as the novel becomes darker as the story goes on, so does Apocalypse Now. It all leads up to a very chilling and gripping ending which will never be forgotten even years from now. Apocalypse Now affected the conscious of everybody who watched it.The movie is magnificent. Francis Ford Coppola, who also directed the Godfather Trilogy, has created another masterpiece here. The acting was superb by everyone. Some of the other familiar faces besides Brando and Sheen would include Robert Duvall, Laurence Fishburne, Frederic Forrest, Harrison Ford in a minor role, Dennis Hopper, and Scott Glenn. Great scenes, superb pacing, and epic storytelling make Apocalypse Now one of the greatest movies ever made.",10,0,1,22 March 2007
Disturbia," A Terrific PG13 Horror thriller
","Disturbia is one of the best PG13 thrillers that I've seen in a long time. After all the other rated PG13 thrillers that have come out in the past six years or so, DJ Caruso, who directed, proves that it has always been possible to make a good suspenseful thriller these days without all the gore.Shia Labeouf plays Kale Brecht. After witnessing the death of his father in a car accident, he becomes sullen and withdrawn. This leads to him being put under house arrest after he punches out an unsympathetic teacher. Imprisoned in his own house, and unable to go beyond 100 yards, he finds himself turning into a peeping tom and spying on all the neighbors. One of them is the attractive new girl in town named Ashley (Sarah Roemer) and another may be a killer named Mr. Turner (David Morse). With the help of the new girl Ashley, his friend Ronnie (a great comedic turn by Aaron Yoo), Kale goes about investigating Mr. Turner to see if he is the killer or not. The three teenagers use cell phones and the internet as well as video cameras in the investigation, and DJ Caruso shows some of his sly wit by using these same devices in the film to not only investigate the spooky neighbor, but also to create some humor to go along with everything else.The plot is a familiar one. That would be because the great Alfred Hitchcock used it first with his famous suspense thriller Rear Window. Yes Disturbia is a blatant rip-off of that movie, but it is done with skill, and the acting by all, including Carrie Anne Moss as Kale's mother, was very good. All the characters are likable, and David Morse's turn as the creepy Mr. Turner was well done as well.Disturbia may not be a great movie, but it is definitely one of the best PG13 thrillers in years. It outshines such horror thrillers as Cursed and Pulse, as well as the recent horror thriller The Messengers. Disturbia also once again proves that you don't need a bunch of gore to make an effective horror thriller. Horror directors take note.",8,243,346,15 April 2007
Spider-Man," A fun film, but could've been better
","Spiderman was a fun movie. It had some good action scenes, and good performances by both Kirsten Dunst and Tobey Maguire, but I think it could've been better for a couple reasons.One reason is the special effects. I mean Spiderman looks like a bouncing ball as he jumps around and soars through the sky on his web. It just looked corny to me, and you could tell it was all CGI, except for one scene at night where he protects Mary Jane.The other part was the Green Goblin character. William Dafoe is a good actor, and he has a couple scenes here that were all right, but there were also some scenes where he appeared just as corny as the special effects.Also what about Aunt May and J Jonah Jameson. They appeared in the movie but had very little to do. That of course was improved in the second film, which is much better than this one.I'm not trashing the movie. I liked it enough to give it a 7 out of 10, but so much more could've been done to make it better. With the second one it was.",7,2,4,19 April 2006
Dark City," An Incredible film and one where the Matrix got many of its ideas
","Dark City was a phenomenal film that very few people know about. It is a dark surreal film from which the Matrix took many of its ideas.Yes people, Dark City, released in 1998, came out before The Matrix, and it is, in my opinion, a somewhat better film also. Don't get me wrong. I enjoyed the Matrix just about as much as everybody else, but the concepts for the Matrix came from this gem of a film which involves a group of creatures dressed in leather who are able to stop time and bend and shape reality as they want to.Human beings are used as experiments during these changes as these creatures, called The Strangers, put them to sleep with their special abilities. Afterward they shift reality and the humans sometimes wake up unknowingly as somebody else or remain the same with only there memories erased from previous times.Of course one day and experiment goes wrong with one of the subjects as he wakes up before he is supposed to. His name is John Murdoch (Rufus Sewell)and he wakes up without knowing who he is in a bathtub. He is soon seeking to unravel the mystery of his life, and soon discovers that he also has abilities just like The Strangers, and quickly realizes after that that things aren't always what they seem in this strange world of illusion.Also starring Jennifer Connelly, Keifer Sutherland, and William Hurt, Dark City is a truly magnificent visual experience that will have you completely stunned as the hero unravels the mystery of The Strangers, and the dark gloomy world that comprises them all. The ending fight scene is the only thing that takes away from the movies appeal because it seems a little contrived, but other than that, this film is definitely one of the best science fiction films of the modern era.",9,1,3,13 May 2006
Aliens," Another Cameron Classic
","Like Terminator, Cameron's breakthrough film, Aliens is another classic directed by him that mixes the genres of horror and science-fiction as well as action. Its also one of my favorite movies like Terminator, and because of this Cameron gets a lot of respect from me. Two classics by the same director? You just can't go wrong with that.Ripley (Sigourney Weaver in a role that never quite type cast her) is found 57 years after the first Alien film. She is picked up by a salvage team and sent back to Earth, where things have changed quite a bit during her very long sleep. She also discovers that she has outlived her daughter, but the edited version doesn't give her anytime to mourn. I've never seen the director's cut, but I heard it goes into more detail about this.Not long after this she is sent to some sort of board meeting where she has to explain what happen. Her story is of course meant with skepticism, but it is at this meeting that she finds out that LV-426, the planet where she first discovered the hostile Alien with her Nostromo Crew, has now been occupied by colonists who are now able to live on the harsh planet because of Atmosphere Processors.The skepticism proves false though when transmissions with the colonists are suddenly lost. So Ripley, with a high-tech combat team of marines to back her up, returns to the planet to destroy the vicious creatures forever and put an end to her nightmares. Of course the Aliens, now way more than one, aren't going to be beaten so easily. And the only help they have is one little girl named Newt (Carrie Henn) who is the only colony survivor and knows a little bit about the creepy monsters. Newt also taps into Ripley's motherly instincts and strengthens her for her final meeting with the hateful Queen alien and leads to the thrilling climax.I don't really have to summarize the plot anymore. Let's just say that the acting in this film was superb. Michael Biehn, Lance Hendricksen, Jenette Goldstein, and Bill Paxton give great performances, and what can I say about Sigourney Weaver. She is just one of the best female action heroes that ever crossed the screen.The visuals were remarkable and still hold up today, and the pacing was classic Cameron. This guy knows how to make and action film, and he also knows how to cross genres like horror and sci-fi as well as drama. He did the same thing with 1984s Terminator, and he doesn't slip at all with Aliens. A great film.",10,4,6,1 March 2006
Independence Day," Good Special Effects and humor equals a fun movie
","This is perhaps Roland Emmerich's best film to date. It's not a great film, but it was fun to watch and had me feeling a little patriotic after seeing it on Independence Day of 1996.Like The Day After Tomorrow, another Emmerich film, Independence Day draws a good line between popcorn fun and quirky enough characters that kept me smiling. If I had to compare the two though, Independence Day would fall on top. It is also Roland Emmerich's best film so far.Aliens from another planet are bent on taking over our world with huge ships that block out the sunlight. Using smaller one manned ships, they decide to do battle with our air force. We use atomic bombs as well, and neither one has any real effect on the monstrous ships that loom over major cities to lay waist to everything. All hope seems lost until a simple Cable technician (Jeff Goldblum) finds a way to make the fight more fair for mankind. With help from a cocky air force pilot (Will Smith in one of his better and more famous roles) the two set out to attack the alien mother ship with a computer virus. Will it work? Well if you haven't seen the movie you'll have to.Independence Day was a phenomenal success. It helped make Will Smith a superstar and paved the way to become the biggest blockbuster of 1996. It was one of those movies you couldn't help but enjoy no matter how flawed it may have been. Like many other summer films, Independence Day was pure popcorn entertainment. I enjoyed it a lot.",8,2,5,5 July 2006
No Country for Old Men," A wonderful film with a weak ten minutes or so near the end
","I enjoyed this movie. I thought it was one of the best films of this year. Hands down I would give it the same grade I gave The Departed last year. It would've been a 10 and therefore better than The Departed, which I also gave a 9, if the final confrontation involving Josh Brolin's character hadn't felt rushed and sort of anti-climatic. I won't talk about that scene because it would be a spoiler for those who haven't seen it yet, but I can still give a quick synopsis of the story.A man named Llewelyn Moss (Josh Brolin) is out hunting when he stumbles upon a massacre. We soon discover that the massacre was caused by a drug deal gone wrong. While doing a search he discovers a satchel of money and takes it home. Not long after he is hunted by several different parties who have been hired by the real owner of the money. Their job is to return the money and kill whoever has taken it. One of these men is the ruthless and psychotic Anton Chigurh (Javier Bardem) who is relentless in his pursuit of Moss and the stolen money.Most of the story is a cat and mouse game involving the two people above, but there is a third party who is out searching for these two as well and he was not hired by any drug dealer. He is the local sheriff named Ed Tom Bell (Tommy Lee Jones) and you can see by the creases in his face and the sadness in his expression that he has lived a hard existence as a sheriff who has come up against way too much evil in the world. This character is used in a sort of minor role which helps the narration of the story and allows us to understand how much harder life has become in a world filled with corruption, greed, and murder. Some people might have found it a little distracting because of how the plot absorbs you into the two main characters only to pull you away whenever Bell takes center stage, but I found it to be a major addition to the story. Bell may not be the main character, but his role adds structure to the depth of the plot and helps explain why the movie was titled as it was. This is a depressing and sad movie, but that is what it was meant to be.The acting in the movie is top notch, and the pacing is frantic and moves relentlessly forward just like both Moss and Chigurh. One does everything he can to save his family and protect his self, while the other pursues menacingly and seems completely unstoppable. One thing that bothered me a little about all this is that nobody ever seemed to hear anything while all this violence is going on, but that is only a minor complaint that probably can be explained to the point that people really don't want to get involved anyway. It fits the profile of the storyline so I'll let it go. However something I cannot let go is the final showdown as stated above. I was expecting to see more than what was given, and the film didn't seem to offer a closure. As I left the theater I thought of another movie that I liked that had and ending that offered no closure as well. That would be the fantasy drama/science fiction film Donnie Darko. The scene with the Bell character at the conclusion was fine because it helped to explain what the movie was hinting at all along, but I couldn't accept that last confrontation involving Moss. After all the fantastic build up and great suspense which glued me in my seat for most of the film, I just couldn't accept the final battle as it was. So yes I felt a little cheated, but I will still give this movie very high marks for being creative and making itself feel genuine even though there have been many other movies just like it. I will also add that Javier Bardem as Anton Chigurh gives us perhaps one of the greatest villains ever created since Hannibal Lecter from Silence of The Lambs. Also the lack of a music soundtrack is perfect for this movie. Natural sounds are the only thing needed because they make the film seem more realistic. A soundtrack for a film like this would've just been a distraction.",9,1,3,1 January 2008
Remember the Titans," An okay football movie in my book
","With the Superbowl coming up, I decided to watch Remember The Titans. I knew it was about high school football and dealt with race. It was based on a true story in 1971 which involved integration of both black and white students into one school. I found it quite interesting.Denzel Washington plays Herman Boone. He is brought into the school to replace Bill Yoast (Will Patton) as head coach of the high school football team the Titans. Yoast is upset at first, but then he decides to stay on as defensive coordinator of the Titans, and together these two men find away to get through their differences and bring a football team of both black and white students together as winners. Both give very good performances The young cast is also splendid, especially Wood Harris as Julius and Ryan Hurst as Gerry Bertier. These two are the team captains of the Titans, and they are the first to break through their discrimination against one another and become fast friends. Honorable mention should also be given to Hayden Panettiere as Bill Yoast's young daughter Sheryl.What makes this film work though is how race is not one sided. You see the good and bad from all sides. A recent movie that did just this same thing was Crash from 2005.Now for the bad. There were some things in Remember the Titans that just never quite fit. The character of Ronnie 'Sunshine' Bass (even though it was a decent performance by Kip Pardue) was one, and all the singing was another. Was Sunshine gay or not? There's one moment where you think it's true, but then afterward it's never really explained. The singing that was used in the movie also went a little too far and distracted somewhat from the movie. Other than that, this was a pretty good film.",7,1,2,2 February 2007
Twilight," I would say so so
","Not the worst movie I've seen at all, but I think it could've been better in some aspects. Some of the dialoque seemed wooden, the special effects seemed a little cheesy, but I do believe the director created a storyline which was somewhat good but just missing a couple pieces. I believe the sequel will be better. THe look of the characters seemed right for the roles. THe character of Bella was rather well played, and the character who played Edward wasn't bad, but still could've been better. I enjoyed the character that played Bella's father as well.Like I said, not that bad of a movie, but the story will likely be better in the sequel now that we got what I guess you would say was the origin story out of the way. By the way, I did not read the books.",6,2,4,27 November 2008
Saving Private Ryan," An Incredible film
","Saving Private Ryan is one one of Spielberg's best movies, and that's saying a lot. It was an incredible experience and the first twenty minutes or so was intense, graphic, and completely realistic. It is known as probably one of the greatest scenes in cinema history ever. It was a great beginning to an incredible movie.Tom Hanks plays Captain John H. Miller. After surviving the attack at Omaha Beach (known now as D-Day) he and his platoon are given new orders to search for a private Ryan and bring him back home. You see, all of Ryan's brothers have been killed in combat, and since he is the last survivor, the higher ups in the U.S. military want him returned safely to his grieving mother who has already lost three of her boys.Miller of course takes the job. He doesn't much like it, but he is just following the orders of his superiors. When he tells his platoon about it, they are all against it. After all, why should they risk all their lives for one person. They gripe about it, but ultimately they followed their leader and go on the search mission behind enemy lines where Ryan's squadron was parachuted in.Along the way we learn about the characters, yet the pace never was drawn out. As the action is happening we are also learning a little bit about the characters. Vin Diesel had and early roll with this movie, and other actors include Tom Sizemore as Sergeant Mike Horvath, Edward Burns as Private Richard Reiben, Barry Pepper as Private Daniel Jackson, Adam Goldberg as Private Stanley Mellish, and Henry Thomas. All were good in their roles.This movie had excellent cinematography and editing as well as great sound. It was no wonder it won the academy awards for all of these, and I also believe that Spielberg's Oscar for Best Director was the right choice. Tom Hanks was the main star, but Spielberg's directing made all the characters seem just as important, and kept the pace of the moving going without any real slow up.My only question would be about the story which is told form a soldier's view. I have know problem with the story being told from that view, but what I do have a problem with is believing that our leaders would create a mission that would risk eight of their men to save one. I know that the grieving mother lost three of her boys, but would our military really go through all this for one man? I don't think so. But then it is just a movie. Overall I enjoyed it, and would highly recommend it to anybody.",9,3,6,26 February 2007
2012," Roland Emmerich destroys the world again
","Using the basis of a Mayan prophecy that says the world will end in December of 2012, Roland Emmerich brings us another mega special effects extravaganza that is about as good as most of his other movies, excluding Godzilla of course. The special effects are grand, as always, and the characters have their own humor which makes them more interesting. THis movie actually comes close to and reminds me of Michael Bay's first Transformers movie because it uses the same kind of sense of humor to keep your interest, and gives you a lot of special effects to chew on.THe plot is simple. December 2012 comes and the entire world is suddenly being wiped out by major earthquakes, volcanoes, and very gigantic waves that manage to reach the highest peaks in the world. A radio deejay, played lovingly by Woody Harrelson who we last saw in the humorous Zombieland, of course stated that all of this would happen. Most didn't believe, and those that did died, so that the secret would never be let out of the bag and cause major panic. Yep, you got it, the government assassinated them all, especially the US Government. Old Roland doesn't seem to much care for our government, as he has made the US Government look bad in just about every single movie he's ever made.2012 is mad fun, and the effects out do all the ones that the director has done before. THe characters have their own tics and are made likable for the most part, except for a couple here and there, but most of those couple die by the end of the movie anyway. Nothing surprising there, but there are millions upon millions of innocents that die as well since the entire movie is based around the entire world being destroyed and all. Just like all of his other films, Emmerich's latest movie ends with a feeling of hope even after the end has come and gone.THe build up to the film was nice, and when the disaster's finally hit there is no let down. The movie impresses in its own way, but it's a shame that we couldn't get much of a real story out of it, The ending does seem to drag on a little too long, but hey, the director does with the movie what was expected, and for that, it's a success",7,0,0,27 November 2009
Ghost Rider," Good popcorn fun
","Ghost Rider is better than I expected. After all the complaints about the movie, I found myself pleasantly surprised with it. This is not a movie to be taken seriously. It is just simple popcorn fun.Nicholas Cage plays stunt motorcyclist Johnny Blaze who years ago as a teenager sold his soul to the devil in order to save his father from the cancer that was killing him. Jump to the present and we discover that the devil has come to collect on the bargain they made. You see Blackheart(Wes Bentley), who is the son of the devil, has escaped from Hell. He has come to Earth to collect a document which will give him the power to create hell on Earth. The devil of course doesn't want him to have it, and so he gets Johnny, giving him the power of the fiery Ghost Rider, to bring him back to Hell. Of course Blackheart isn't ready to go back and so a battle ensues between the two.I enjoyed the story, and enjoyed Sam Elliot in his role as a cemetery worker who tells Johnny about the curse and explains all the information we need to know. Of course Sam Elliot's character has a few secrets of his own, even though they were not really too surprising. I sort of knew where the story of Sam Elliots character was going when he first appeared on the scene. Enough of that though.Ghost Rider is not the greatest comic book movie ever made. It has its flaws, but it was purely entertaining and has its place among other comic book adaptations. I would give it about the same rating as the Fantastic Four from 2005. And to those people who are trashing it, maybe you should all lighten up and enjoy the movie for what it is, a fun paced thriller that is much better than some of the lame movies I've seen so far this year. By the way, the special effects were really good too.",7,3,4,18 February 2007
X-Men: The Last Stand," Almost as enjoyable as the second film, though there is no time for character development.
","I thoroughly enjoyed X-Men the Last Stand. It was a fun film that moved at a break neck pace, and even though it was rather short for a comic book movie, it was never boring.A millionaire has discovered a cure for the mutant gene. We have Charles Xavier's group on one side and Magneto's group on the other. Magneto wants to destroy the mutant cure, and Xavier is trying to come to an agreeable conclusion that would help mutants and humans alike. On top of this all we have the return of Jean Grey (Famke Janssen) as her alter ego The Phoenix, and she's not so nice this time around. In fact she's damn powerful and scary as well, and has an even bigger role to play then she had in the second film.Most of the same characters return from X2 with the addition of many others on both sides for mutants, including Ben Foster as the Angel, Kelsey Grammar as The Beast, Vinnie Jones as the Juggernaut, and Dania Ramirez as Calysto. Mystique returns as well, but she doesn't have the same screen time as she did in the first two films. That's a shame because I enjoyed her character, but what time she does get was still fun.We also have some more surprises in this latest installment as some mutants die that you would never suspect, but I'm not about to give that information away and spoil the film. Lets just say you'll have to see the film and accept what happens. Some people might not like it too much, but I was genuinely surprised with some of the ones that were killed.Brett Ratner has development a fast paced action film that moves much like a comic book would. There isn't much character development, but the movie is really too short to go into details about each mutant. Lets just say that X-Men 3 The Last Stand is a compelling adventure that never becomes boring for even a second. I liked it almost as much as the second film but not quite. It's still better than the first film which was another film that had it moments, but just not enough of them.",7,0,1,26 May 2006
The Mist," Very disturbing with a shocker of an ending that was surprising to say the least
","Based on Stephen King's short novel from his Skeleton Crew collection of stories, The Mist, as directed by Frank Darabont, follows Stephen King's story very closely and was a very good adaption. It was not the greatest King story brought to the screen, that would likely be the Shawshank Redemption by this same director and Carrie back in 1976 by Brian DePalma, but it does the job it set out to do with a twist on the original story's ending which will surprise a few and likely disappoint others. I kind of liked the ending a little, but I will not spoil it for anybody who will see it.After a freak storm, which knocks out all power and phone lines and destroys some things, a strange Mist follows in it's wake. Looking at this Mist you would see that there is nothing normal about it. David Drayton (Thomas Jayne) takes his young son and a neighbor into town for supplies. During this time they hear sirens going off and see Military trucks driving passed. Soon after this, a man comes running into the store yelling that 'there's something in the mist' and explains how something in the mist took his friend. People start to panic, and it is around this time that the mist sweeps into the parking lot and quickly envelops everything. The build up is perfect as the human element begins to break down slowly. The first creature is seen only by a few who are doubted at first, but then when some doubters decide to walk out into the mist for help, it is not long after before other people realize that there really is something out there, and it's more than just one thing, and these things are all bloodthirsty.I loved the pacing of this film and the way Darabont ups the ante by showing us what happens to people when they no longer feel safe. You see the creatures are scary themselves, especially some nasty creatures in the next door pharmacy, but the behavior of mankind when not in control of their surroundings is much worse. Mrs. Carmody (in an over the top but excellent performance by Marcia Gay Harden) as the religious fanatic is quite effective, and the way she draws followers to her as things start spiraling out of control is utterly terrifying because it is likely the way many people would react in such circumstances.The acting for the most part was pretty good, but there were times when I felt as if the actors were forcing it. Thomas Jayne has a scene or two like this, but otherwise he did pretty good as the lead. Besides Marcia Gay Harden, I was also impressed with Laurie Holden who played Amanda Dumfries, and Toby Jones who played the heroic Ollie. However there were a few scenes, mostly in the beginning, where the dialoque seemed a little hokey. For the most part this improved as the movie went on.The special effects were quite effective as well. I was impressed with all of them, but the scene in the pharmacy next door was to me the scariest and queasiest of them all. I talked about it above already. Also, most of the creations in this movie would fit in any H.P. Lovecraft story. I believe that was where King got the inspiration for writing this story anyway.Of course there are deaths, some will come as surprises and some you will know coming before they actually do. The gore factor is not over the top like in the Saw movies or Hostel. This is more a scary film then a gross out film, and I found it to be better then all the Saw and Hostel movies.I will not discuss the ending much. It will come as a shocker, and like I stated earlier, some will be disappointed and some won't. I thought it was rather ballsy for a director, and I commend him for not leaving it ambiguous like the King story, which I felt was also good. That's all I have to say about the ending though.Overall the movie is very effective and will have you thinking about it after you leave the theater. It's not up their with Alien, ALiens, The Exorcist, or Halloween (the original Carpenter version), but it comes close to matching 2005s The Descent as one of the better horror films to come out in the past couple of years. Enjoy it at your own risk.",8,34,67,25 November 2007
I Am Legend," Strong film that falls a little short near the end
","I Am Legend, based on the Richard Matheson novelette of the same name, is quite good. I loved the pacing and never felt bored with the film even though almost the entire film focuses on just one character and his dog. It falls a little short at the end, but is still a worthwhile experience.In a world where most of humanity has been transformed into zombies or killed off by a man made plaque that was suppose to cure cancer, one man, the lone survivor of New York City, struggles to find a cure and somehow save humanity. His name is Robert Neville, and as played by Will Smith, he gives the character depth. That is something that not all actors can do, and with a film which follows just one character and his dog for about ninety percent of the film's length, I'd have to say Will Smith does a splendid job. We sense his fear, his anger, and his struggles with loneliness since his only companion is an animal that is unable to carry on a conversation.There were some things in the film which made me feel a little leery. One would have to be Neville's confrontations with mannequins. I'm not sure what would happen in real life if someone was left alone for such a long time, but would they actually do what Neville does? And I'm not talking sexual either. If anybody saw Castaway with Tom Hanks which involved a soccer ball, you might know what I mean. Tom Hanks had a character that was alone for a long period as well, but he made it feel a little more convincing then Will Smith does. With Smith, it just felt a little awkward, with Tom Hanks it was a little more natural I guess.Now onto the CGI and the sets and special effects. The director Francis Lawrence did great things with all the New York scenes. New York felt quite desolate, and it had to be hard to get and effect like that in the city that never sleeps. It makes you wonder how long it took to get those scenes to work so well. The creature effects were okay but could've been better, and it was the CGI that weakened the last third or so of the movie. A creature here and there was okay, but then you have a bunch all at once and it was just not as effective.The finale was different from the novel, but it still left and impression after it was over. It gave us more hope for humankind. Overall I liked the movie and would recommend it to anybody who's a fan of such movies.",7,0,2,29 December 2007
A Quiet Place," A creative imagined little horror movie.
","I watched a quiet place with high expectations. I was not disappointed. The movie is clever, and reminded me a lot of Signs. It's clever in its creepiness and the acting from all involved was strong, especially for a movie where there is very little dialogue. The actors and actresses involved show us a lot with just facial features and gestures to get their points across without making a sound. The special effects were pretty good as well. The director, who also plays the father with his real life wife acting along side him, shows a lot of promise, and I hope to see more movies from him in the future.Now you would wonder why I only give this movie and 8 star rating out of 10, and my answer would be that the movie contain some holes in logic. WHy have a baby in a world where the slightest sound can get you killed, without at least preparing yourself for that possibility? If it was a mistake, maybe explain it in someway like how you explained the creatures being their in the first place when you show newspaper clippings. Other holes in logic involved having things around you that are accidents waiting to happen, a lit lantern, wooden steps that could creak, leading the monsters right to you, along with other things involving wooden steps, as well as other things. Overall I enjoyed this movie. It was clever in a time where many movies have become repetitive. It's nice to see someone try something knew, even though it still contains many of the normal horror tropes from other horror movies. I strongly recommend it, but want to warn anyone who sees it, the movie is a slow burn. However, at an hour and a half running time, it never warms out its welcome.",8,2,4,8 April 2018
Kick-Ass," Bloody fun
","I've heard some people complaining about this movie because it involves a little girl who curses and kills bad guys at random. We have to take into consideration that this is a comic book satire, and is not meant to be taken seriously. It is rated R for a reason because little kids are not suppose to be watching it. The only problem I have with any of this is the parents that would take their small children to see this. That is completely wrong. Now here's my review.I found Kick Ass to be hysterical and over the top. It reminded me a lot of Kill Bill 1 and 2, and I enjoyed those two movies as well. The killings in Kick Ass are graphic and appalling, but that's what the film is meant to be, a graphic description of a comic book series. I can include the movie Sin City, another good film, in this as well, and I can tell you that both Kill Bill films and Sin City are much more bloodier than Kick Ass. I don't understand the opinions from critics, most of whom enjoyed the Kill Bill movies and Sin City, who find that Kick Ass is a little too much for their tastes. That is being hypocritical, and that is not the way a critic should review any movies.THe acting for the most part was well done. Nicolas Cage hams it up and does a good job while not taking the material seriously. I got a sense that he was copying Adam West from the old Batman series in the 60s, and he does a fine job. Aaron Johnson, who plays Kick Ass, reminded me a lot of Tobey Maguire in the Spider-Man movies in the way he handled his part. Both Mark Strong (Frank D'Amico) and Christopher Mintz-Plasse (Chris D'Amico/Red Mist) have good supporting roles, but the person that real grabbed most of my interest was Chloe Moretz, who play Hit Girl. Whenever she appears, no matter if she is just talking or kicking ass, she takes the role and runs with it, and just about takes over the movie where we nearly forget about the character of Kick Ass.Kick Ass is an entertaining movie that grabbed my interest from the beginning, and never grows dull. THe humor is there along with all the blood shed. It is an insane film that keeps you watching until the end. It is not a great film, but I wasn't expecting it to be. It was just the type of action movie that we don't see much of anymore, even if the killer, most of the time, is an eleven year old girl.",8,2,11,18 April 2010
The Twilight Saga: New Moon," Not as bad as some say ( Mild Spoilers only if you haven't read the books)
","New Moon is the second in a series based on four books by Stephanie Meyer. For the most part, the fan base is teenage girls because that is who Stephanie Meyer was really writing for. Now I will agree that some of things that Bella does would be a bad influence, but lets realize that this is all a work of fiction and that normal girls wouldn't do such things knowing this is fiction. After all, vampires and werewolves do not exist. This review is based on what I read of the books and how the movies themselves are bringing this story together on the screen. I have seen both Twilight and New Moon, and found that the movie New Moon worked much better than the movie Twilight if you go by the books. Now I will explain why.As in the first film, this film had some hokey dialoque, but when I compare it to the Twilight movie, I found it wasn't as bad. Maybe it's because the actors have gotten a little more experience and can show more emotion. It just didn't come off as awkward.Now involving the chemistry between the actors, i still believe there is room for improvement, but once again it came off much better in New Moon. Maybe it's because of the new director, I'm not sure, or maybe its the experience issue again. Whatever it might be, it didn't have me wanting to throw up like in Twilight. Taylor Lautner, who plays the werewolf Jacob, had a lot more to do this time, and he pulled it off better than I though he would. THere was still some clumsiness between Robert Pattison and Kristen Stewart, but they also improved as the movie went on. And was it me or did they use some kind of special effect to make Lautner taller. He really looked over six foot tall even though he is only about 5'10 or 5'11 in real life. But I guess, packing on muscle like he did for this part would make anybody seem physically bigger.Putting dialoque and chemistry aside, the biggest improvement however was in the action and special effects. The wolves looked pretty good, and by bringing the Quilette tribe into the story, that helped with the pacing and made this second more interesting. Even the effects for the Vampires were much better, probably because they had more of a budget this time. I still think there could've been more action, but I think will get a lot more in Eclipse. THe other good thing about this movie was the VOlturi, they seemed threatening enough and those actors pulled their parts off well enough.I've come to realize that the Twilight Series, which was targeted towards younger teen aged girls when first written, should be looked at as a group of movies in much the same way. I've seen better and I've seen worse, but this movie isn't half as bad as some people think. It is not an academy award winner in anyway, but it does what it set out to do, and for that it gets a pass from me.",7,2,6,23 November 2009
Fantastic 4: Rise of the Silver Surfer," Nothing Special but still entertaining
","Fantastic Four Rise of The Silver Surfer wasn't bad. Like its predecessor, it was more of a fun popcorn film. The story was also improved from the first movie, though some of the dialoque was worse.I'm not going to go into plot details because I'm sure most Marvel Comic fans know the story about Galactus and The Silver Surfer from the FF comics back in the sixties titled The Coming of Galactus. Granted there was no Watcher like in those comics, but the origin story of both Galactus and The Silver Surfer was pretty much accurate, with the exception of Sue taking the place of Alicia on a major plot detail. We also have the return of Doctor Doom as well.I'm sure many have seen the previews and trailers for the movie, so it's no spoiler when I say the scenes where Johnny switches powers with the other members of the team aren't as goofy as I thought they would be. In fact it goes hand in hand with the ending, but I won't share those details.Fantastic Four 2 is about on the same par as the first film. With the exception of Chris Evans who has all the good lines again, the acting still seemed off. It's most likely because of the horrendous dialoque. There also was no real chemistry between the Reed and Sue characters, but Ioan Gruffudd was pretty good playing the quirky scientist that is Reed Richards. Mike Chiklis was also somewhat okay, but Jessica Alba still needs to improve her acting.And for those who didn't like the way Galactus was portrayed, I can understand your point, but it wasn't really that bad because Galactus can take on different forms. However, there is a scene in the movie which kind of does give and image of what Galactus looks like in the comics. It is not a clear image, but it is there.On one final note, the ending of Fantastic Four 2 was superior to the ending we got with Spider Man 3, and I found FF 2 more entertaining as well. Maybe it was because of its short 92 minute running time, whereas Spiderman 3 was just too long with too much going on at once.",7,1,3,15 June 2007
Transformers," Action Packed and fun to watch
","Transformers is one of those summer blockbuster movies that you can't miss. It was action packed and loads of fun. Sure the story was confusing and some of the actors only secondary to all the transforming alien robot clans, but it all seemed to work because the film never takes itself too seriously.Two alien robot clans land on Earth and do battle over an Allspark which is a magic cube of some kind which grants unlimited power to whoever possesses it. You have the heroic Autobots and their leader Optimus Prime, and then you have the evil Decepticons and their leader Megatron. I could go into more detail about how this Allspark ended up on earth, but it would take way too long. If you go and see the movie, it is explained in detail anyway, so I don't believe I need to explain it here.Anyway our main star in the film, outside the special effects and the robots, is none other then Shia Labeouf who was the lead man in the suspense thriller Disturbia which was out earlier this year. He plays Sam Witwicky, and like he did with Disturbia brings a lot of humor and wit to Transformers as well. His costar is the hot and sexy Megan Fox who becomes his love interest and also knows a thing or two about car engines. There is also support from big actors Jon Voight, John Torturro, and Tyrese Gibson as well as comic relief from Kevin Dunn and Julie White who play parents Ron and Judy Witwicky. What these other actors offer may not be great, but it helps to keep the movie from ever being just a one dimensional action packed thriller loaded with special effects and nothing else.The special effects are in fact the best I've ever seen. They even rival those of Spiderman 3, and may even go beyond that early summer blockbuster which I was disappointed with. Michael Bay keeps the action moving and only slows down in his attempts for humor which actually work. Bumblebee, the Camaro that Sam actually buys, is comic relief in itself as one of the Autobots which seems to play classic rock songs at just the right time to mirror what Sam is actually thinking.If you were a fan of the Transformer toys back in the 80s, I think you'll like the movie. Even if you weren't a fan, I still suggest you see the film because it is quite entertaining. I will give it an 8 out of 10.",8,1,5,9 July 2007
Children of Men," Disturbing and incredibly well made
","Children of Men was a wonderful film. Alfonso Cuaron delivers another intelligent thriller here. It's a movie that is disguised as an action film but contains science fiction elements as well.It's the year 2027. For the past 18 years, mankind has been unable to reproduce. This of course has led to a lot of terrorism and violence. Only Britain has any kind of government left. The rest of the world is in chaos. This film reminded me a lot of V For Vendetta in creating what seems to be the final days that must be changed for the better. This time however we don't have a vigilante trying to get the people to step up against their corrupt government. Instead we have one Theo Faron (Clive Owen), who seems to be no real hero at first. He is given the assignment by his former lover (Julianne Moore) to help get the only pregnant girl left in the world to the safety of a sanctuary on a boat where scientists can study her pregnancy and find away to save mankind. Of course there are obstacles along the way, including betrayal that I won't discuss here, and that is the plot of the story. Will Theo, with the help of certain rebels, manage to get the pregnant girl to the boat safely, or will he fail. You have to watch it and see what happens.The acting in this film was phenomenal. Clive Owen looks scrappy at first and not like somebody that can help get a pregnant girl to safety. He pulls his part off quite nicely. Michael Caine, as an old bearded friend of Theo's, and looking much like a 60s hippie here, also manages to steal every scene that he is in. The other actors were good as well.Children of Men is a gritty looking film with some great editing sequences, and some terrifying images that will stay with you for awhile. It also contains some haunting images of a future that might be closer to the truth then we realize. A great film all around, with a pace that never becomes boring, Children Of Men is highly recommended. I would also consider it one of the best films of the year.",10,2,6,20 April 2007
Star Wars: Episode VIII - The Last Jedi," A horrible mess of a movie
","I am appalled with this movie. There were a lot of unnecessary jokes that did not work. One single character, the biggest character in the series by the way, does things that go against everything his character would've done. A lot of the movie was padded with boring material, and the big bad villain is made into a weak an useless character that dies mid way through the movie. The storyline was weak, and a lot of things that happened made no sense. I understand why many people are down about this movie, but what I really don't understand is how this still has a 7.5 rating on Imdb. Maybe some writers were paid off to give this movie high marks as some other reviewers have said. I will say the special effects weren't bad, and the actors did a pretty good job with the material they had to work with. That's why it will get a rating of 3 stars out of 10 from me. Overall, it is a poor film that is way worse than even the prequel films.",3,3,4,23 January 2018
Paranormal Activity," Pretty good movie for Halloween
","I enjoyed Paranormal Activity, but I would not say that it is the scariest film of all time. However, it was creepy and had quite a few jump scares.A young couple moves into a house where they are having nightly visits by something ghastly. THe guy Micah decides to tape it and see what is happening, and Katie (the girl) agrees at first, but as the events become worse she becomes more disagreeable. THe events escalate as the movie goes on, and everything leads to a disturbing ending which was a little too predictable given the circumstances, but it still worked pretty good. I of course will not give anything away.Made on a budget of only 15,000 dollars, the movie surprises. Once again the less you see is always much scarier then when you see too much. It is a lot like THe Blair Witch Project without the nauseating feel of a moving camera that some people complained about with that film. THe camera does move some, but not enough to cause any stomach problems associated with movies like this which have a documentary style.THe two actors, who have barely any experience as actors, are pretty good and actually have chemistry. I enjoyed it, and it is a real good movie to see during Halloween which is only two weeks away. It is definitely much better than any of the Saw sequels which are basically the same exact thing with lots of gore minus the scares.It may not be the scariest movie of all time, there are quite a few other films scarier, but it was creepy and disturbing in its own right. I would recommend it to anybody who wants to be scared, and when I say scared I don't me just grossed out.",8,0,2,17 October 2009
Logan," Violent dark movie, but good. Not for children under 17
","I enjoyed this movie. It is an extremely different change from the other X-men movies with it R rating. It is a very gory, with some pretty harsh language thrown in. THis is not a feel good film, but I enjoyed it nonetheless. The acting was top notch, and the characters were handled well. THis movie was more like a western then a super hero movie. THe tonal change is surprising, but it was a fitting end to Hugh Jackman's run as Wolverine. BOth him and Patrick Stewart were exceptional in their roles. I recommend it.",8,0,3,4 March 2017
The Dark Knight," Yes folks. This is the best Batman movie ever.
","I don't believe that The Dark Knight is the top movie of all time on IMDb's top 250 list, but the movie should be there and pretty high. The acting was incredible by all. Even the smaller performances were great. THe storyline is one of the best in years for a comic book adaption. It's convoluted and makes us all think about the world around us and how things have changed since 9-11. The direction by Nolan is precise on getting these points across. I saw the movie two nights ago, and find myself still thinking about it. That's the sign of a top movie folks, and yes I think this movie deserves a 10 rating.Batman (Christian Bale) is back and still cleaning up crime in Gotham City with the help of Lieutenant Gordon (Gary Oldman). Harvey Dent (Aaron Eckhart) is the new district attorney, and he believes in what Batman is doing and is serious about cleaning up the streets as well. Of course when you start pushing criminals who have been in charge for so long, there is bound to be someone who will step up to try and bring Gotham back down. This would be the Joker (Heath Ledger). In an Oscar worthy performance that steals the show, Ledger's joker is totally deranged and extremely convincing in the role. Some have compared it to Anthony Hopkins performance in Silence Of THe Lambs, and that is not too far of a stretch. He believes in total anarchy, and a lot of what he says in The Dark Knight has a ring of truth to it. That makes him even scarier, and made me think a lot about our world and how it has become a much darker place. Christopher Nolan who directed and co-wrote the movie with his brother Jonathan, has to be given a lot of credit for The Dark Knight. He has created a sequel that is superior to Batman Begins and blows all the other Batman movies out of the water. You can't find too many sequels that are better than the first film, but The Dark Knight definitely is one of them. With Batman Begins, Nolan created a dark universe of corruption where good isn't always easy to find, but with The Dark Knight he goes even deeper into this strange fictional world that almost mirrors our own. He has a lot to say, and it isn't always pretty folks.Both Michael Caine and Morgan Freeman reprise their roles as Alfred and Lucius Fox, and are just as good as ever. Maggie Gyllenhaal replaces Katie Holmes as Rachael Dawes, and does fine in the part. In fact I found her portrayal of Rachael to be even better.The Dark Knight is full of surprises and twists. There is even the death of a main character, but I won't spoil it for anyone. Everything about The Dark Knight is top-notch. THere were many great films over the years, as I said above, so I wouldn't put The Dark Knight at the top of IMDb's 250 list, but it belongs on that list. Maybe not #1 or even top 10, but top 50 may not be too far off. And it is definitely one of the top 5 comic book adaption's ever. Highly recommended.",10,6,13,21 July 2008
Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix," Still Passable fun but not as good as the other four films
","Harry Potter and The Order of the Phoenix is still passable fun, but I found myself slightly disappointed with the movie. I know that a lot in the book was kept out of the film, but I believe all the main points were covered, so that is not my problem with the movie. My problem with the movie is that it has lost a little of the magic that made the first four films very good. In my opinion, it's become more of a drama and has lost some of the fantasy touches. Even the teachers, which helped to make the first films so good, have simple cameo parts that last only a few seconds or so. However the three main stars, Radcliffe, Watson, and Grint are still very good.It's Harry's fifth year in Hogwarts, and many things have changed. Nobody in the ministry believes that Voldemort has returned. In fact Cornelius Fudge, the minister, thinks it is all a plot by Dumbledore to overthrow him and take control of the ministry. So the ministry appoints Dolores Umbridge (Imelda Staunton) as Defense Against The Dark Arts teacher to watch over things at Hogwarts. She is perhaps one of the best villains to ever wear pink, and uses her influence to try and take control of Hogwarts herself.On the other side you have the members of The Order of The Phoenix who support Dumbledore and have gotten together as support in defense of Voldemort's growing influence and his own army. These members include Harry's uncle Serious BLack, Mad Eyed Mooney, and Professor Lumas as well as others. You can see how things are getting darker with each movie just as they do with each book.During all this Harry is having nightmares about Voldemort and is becoming so angry with the way things are happening, that he finds himself lashing out at his friends who only want to help him. Both Ron and Hermione accept him still.Order of the Phoenix is still worth seeing. The special effects are as good as ever, and the film moves at a pretty good pace, but with the exception of a major magic battle at the end of the film, the movie doesn't have much else magical to offer. However, I will still recommend it if just barely, and hope the next two films are an improvement.",7,0,0,14 July 2007
2001: A Space Odyssey," An Intelligent Sci Fi experience
","I know that some people don't like 2001 because of the slow pacing, and I can understand their opinion because 2001 is slow at getting to its meaning. Upon watching the film I had those same opinions as well, but as it moved on I found a deeper understanding of the movie and was glad that it didn't rush to its conclusion. This really is a movie about these dark fascinating arrows (the monoliths) which lead mankind on a path to higher evolution. In order to understand the meaning better, one only has to watch this movie in its entirety and be prepared to think deeply. Yes it is a thinking man's movie, unlike something like Armaggeddon.Along the way Stanley Kubrick give us fantastic special effects and also uses music. There is very little dialogue, but that is the point of the movie. In fact the thing that has the most dialogue is the Hal computer, and Hal himself seems more human then the two astronauts he must protect on the voyage in space. Since this is a movie about evolution, that is quite understandable.Some movies are slow and can be a real bore if they have no strong points to make. 2001 is not like that at all. The pacing was perfect because it draws you deeper into the movie to make you think, and that was the point. I loved this movie and would recommend it to everybody who likes movies with deeper meaning. If you are looking for a movie filled with intense violence and wall to wall action, well then 2001 is not for you.",10,1,3,20 August 2006
Men in Black," Another quirky but fun sci-fi adventure film
","Men In Black was a fun goofy film. Using Will Smith's stardom, which he got from Independence Day the year before, and adding another interesting character played by Tommy Lee Jones, we end up with a hilarious spoof on all sci-fi films.The Men In Black are a secret government agency that watches over extra terrestrial activity. Both agent J (Smith) and agent K (Jones) are like a dynamic duo who must work together to stop a monstrous bug from stealing something called a Galaxy. They are given one hour, an intergalactic week, to return it to the Arquillian's or earth will face destruction.This movie had me cracking up. Will Smith was hysterical as the obnoxious J and Tommy Lee Jones was even better as K. His deadpan style of acting was just perfect for this movie, and both him and Smith have great chemistry as partners in fighting alien crime. Linda Fiorentino and Rip Torn were also very good.Men In Black does not have the greatest special effects, but the characters are so fun to watch, that you don't even care how cheesy the special effects are. In fact the characters alone put this far above many of the other trashy films of the same genre.The story was also very creative in coming up with an idea to explain why there are some unusual people in the world. I know it's only fiction, but it made me wonder still. In fact if it was true, it sure would explain a lot.This movie offers spoof after spoof, and it does so in such a deadpan style that you can't help but break out in laughter upon viewing it. I mean all of this in a good way. It never takes itself seriously, and neither do the characters. Everybody involved seemed to enjoy making this movie. Thumbs up.",8,0,0,6 July 2006
Avatar," Not as great as expected but good nonetheless
","Avatar is a fascinating special effects film which gets just about everything right. THe only problems I have with it were a one dimensional character and an average story line that gives us nothing special. Still, people will be awed by the look of this film, and will talk about the effects for a long time to come. It's a shame they won't talk much about the storyline though, or a certain one note character.The Story of Avatar is set in the future. Earth is dying and their is a moon called Pandora which harbors a mineral that Earth needs to survive. This moon is inhabited by many weird and dangerous creatures, the most important of which is a race of giant blue skinned creatures called the Na'vi. The Na'vi live atop this important substance which is buried in the ground beneath them, and American forces are sent to try and drive the Na'vi off the land so they can mine this element. One person, a scientist by the name of Dr. Grace Augustine (Sigourney Weaver who is best known as the female hero in the Alien movies) thinks that they can come to a peaceful compromise with the Na'vi and get what they need. Another, Colonel Miles Quaritch (Stephen Lang), believes otherwise and thinks that force is the only answer. He recruits a paraplegic ex-marine named Jake Sully, (Sam Worthington who we last saw in Terminator Salvation) and offers him his legs back in return for some information on the Na'vi which will give the military forces the tactical advantage. Jake agrees.Since humans can not survive the atmosphere of Pandora, they go in through organic Avatar identities in the form of the Na'vi, while there real bodies sleep peacefully in special machines. Using their brains while sleeping, they are able to control these second bodies and interact with the Na'vi. It is through this new form, that Jake learns about the Na'vi and their ways and falls in love with one of the Na'vi named Neytiri (Zoe Saldana last seen in Star Trek 2009). After nearly three months of living with the Na'vi, he has second thoughts about going to war with these creatures and soon has to choose sides. I will not say whose side he chooses.THe acting was good, and the pacing was also pretty good for a movie almost three hours long. My only complaint would be with Stephen Lang who plays Colonel Miles Quaritch. His acting wasn't bad at all, but the character itself was too one dimensional, which is also what led to the less than perfect rating.The plot seems complex, and it is not bad, but it is not an original idea. However, that is not the biggest reason why I only give it an 8 out of 10. Besides the one dimensional character Miles Quaritch mentioned above, the other reason I give it and 8 is because some of the dialoque is lame and corny and seems to take away from what is an excellent special effects extravaganza. If I could rate it on special effects only it would get a 10, but as I've said about movies before, special effects alone don't make a movie great. THe story in Avatar gets about a 6-7 rating which evens the total grade out to and 8. Still not bad, but I was still a little bit let down because of the hype. Recommended, but not a great movie.",8,1,3,23 December 2009
Grindhouse," Not Bad at all. But the first movie is better than the second.
","With Grindhouse, I enjoyed both segments of the movie. I also enjoyed the false previews and all the scratchy lines that were added to make it look more like the old grind-house films that these two movies copied. Out of both films, I found Planet Terror by Robert Rodriquez to be my favorite. It's all out action and gore. Death Proof, the second segment by Quentin Taratino was okay, but the first half of that segment was pretty dull. It was mostly uninteresting dialog in a bar, but the last half of that act and the second act following it were well worth it.We start with Planet Terror. In this story we discover that some sort of chemical is released and soon turns people into the walking dead. Like Romero's zombies (the movie that this film follows) these zombies also enjoy eating people. It is up to a ragtag bunch of people who seem to be immune to stop the disaster before it takes over the world. The dialog was hysterical and I enjoyed all the characters because they were all stereotypes of other characters in other horror movies. One of the characters, who loses a leg, even gets a automatic rifle which becomes her new leg. She uses the new weapon to wipe out hordes of the zombies. Hysterical and intentionally so. The whole movie was.This is followed by Death Proof. The first half of this segment has a group of girlfriends meeting in a bar to celebrate one of their friend's birthdays. This part of the movie, like I said above, was boring because of a lot of lame dialog. Maybe I didn't get it and am missing something, but I didn't find any of the dialog to be interesting at all. It does help in letting us know a little about the characters before things take a very serious and horrifying turn in the second half which was the best part of this half of Death Proof. This all leads into the second act of Death Proof which was incredible. Robert Rodriquez in Planet Terror celebrated all the zombie movies and George Romero, and this time around Quentin Taratino celebrates movies like Vanishing Point. Movies where muscle cars ruled and were involved in high speed car chases. This was a wonderful second act.Grindhouse is the type of movie that will work for both the older generation and the younger generation of moviegoers. Many of the older people who were teenagers in the fifties and sixties will probably find this movie wonderful and nostalgic. Those from the younger generation of movie goers will find it to be fun, and give them a sense of something new to talk about. Those in between will like it as well.",7,3,5,12 April 2007
Saw," Gruesome but effective horror film
","Saw was a disturbing film with some really gruesome scenes. This movie was definitely a psychological beat down in my experience of watching it. The over the top acting was a little too much, but it got its point across.This is a movie about a serial killer named Jigsaw. He wants to teach certain amoral people how to value life, but he does so in such a horrifying way that his victims must overcome vicious tests where they either do what they need to survive or die because they didn't try hard enough. With his tests there is always a way out, but it is up to the victims to show how far they will go to survive.Dark and disturbing, with very little hope for it characters, this was one of the most depressing horror movies I've ever seen. Nothing more to say. I may not have liked this movie very much, but I mean that in a good way. When you see the movie you will know why.",7,0,1,28 February 2006
Total Recall," An Exciting film
","Total Recall was a fun film. It was loaded with action, typical of any Swarzenegger film. It was also pretty bloody, but compared to some films nowadays, the violence seems rather tame.Douq Quaid (Arnold Swarzenegger) has a loving wife named Lori (Sharon Stone) and a good job as a construction worker on Earth. It would seem his life is good, but he is having strange vivid dreams about Mars and being part of the resistance group there that is battling the evil dictator Vilos Cohaagen (Ronny Cox). You see, Cohaagen has control of the colony and all the air which allows the colonists to inhabit the planet. Also in these dreams, Quaid has a relationship with one of the resistance fighters named Melina (Rachel Ticotin), who is a brunette, unlike his wife.Wanting to understand these dreams, Quaid goes to a memory implant service to get a trip to Mars. Afterward everything seems to spiral out of control as Doug finds that many people he knew before aren't the same, including himself. Once on Mars things get even crazier as he finds himself being chased by a guy named Ricter (Michael Ironside). He also discovers some startling truths, but he also discovers more lies as well.Though not on the same par as the Terminator films, director Paul Verhoeven (who did Robocop and Starship Troopers) has given us an exciting film with some unusual and funny characters that pop up on the screen at different times. The special effects were good for their time, but now would seem a little dated. I liked it and would recommend it as an enjoyable pop-corn flick.",7,0,0,5 March 2006
The Descent," A terrifying movie that draws comparisons to Alien
","The Descent is so far the best horror movie of 2006, and one of the best in a long time. It draws comparisons to Alien and understandably so, but it is still not quite on the same par as that excellent horror film. But it is an intense engaging thriller nonetheless.The movie starts out with three female friends on a white water rafting trip. They are about to finish their trip while the husband of one of them stands on the side with their daughter. This would be Sarah's (Shauna MacDonald) husband. The sense of doom starts from the beginning, and continues onward into a big shocking scene which works perfectly.It is now a year later and the same friends are meeting to go on a caving expedition. Sarah is still having nightmares about that shocking scene earlier in the film involving her husband and daughter, but she goes on the trip anyway. She meets up with the two friends that were with her on the rafting trip as well as three others. One of those two girls who had been on the rafting trip is Juno (Natalie Mendoza) and we already know from one of the beginning scenes that Juno had an affair with Sarah's husband, yet Sarah doesn't know it yet. This is where the suspense starts and only increases as these girls soon find themselves struggling to survive at first a cave-in which makes things more difficult, and then something even worse as they discover they are not alone in that cave.Neil Jordan, who directed Dog Soldiers a few years ago, directs this film with an outstanding touch. He uses different shades of light as well as shadows to make this film even more claustrophobic,that by the time the monsters come around 50 minutes into the film, your nerves are already on edge. So when the monsters appear and the blood and gore starts, you are swallowed up by the carnage.There is not a lot of character development in this movie, but that is not the point. This is one effective horror film that will have you thinking after you've seen it. I know it will be on my mind for awhile.The film is not perfect. It does not have the same effect as Alien did, but it does come close. With the exception of one scene near the end involving two of the characters that I just couldn't quite accept as something that one of them would do, this film works by making all of the characters believable. The performances were very well done, and maybe that's why I couldn't quite accept what happens between those two characters. Maybe others will see it differently, but I'm not about to give that little spoiler away. You'll have to see the movie and understand what I mean.Overall this was an effective horror movie and well worth seeing. It has suspense, believable characters, and gore. All the things that make up what I think a horror movie should have. And on one final note, parents please do not bring young children to see this movie. It's R rated for a reason. I say this because I saw some parents with children under six watching this film.",8,3,7,4 August 2006
Pulp Fiction," Holy Cow. One of the best movies of the 90s
","I'm not kidding about any of this. Pulp Fiction is indeed one of the best movies ever made. There are so many scenes in this movie that are memorable, I couldn't talk about them all without taking up way too much space.The dialogue in this film is magnificent. Samuel Jackson and John Travolta as hit men have most of the best lines, but they are not the only ones with incredible lines. We have Uma Thurman, Bruce Willis, Christopher Walken who has a small part but has dialogue which is just as good as Travolta's and Jackson's, Ving Rhames, Tim Roth, Amanda Plummer. You get the idea.The plot revolves around a number of people, many mentioned above but not all, and how their paths cross in different ways. Each story, I think there are about three but there might be more, is mixed up, but everything comes together in a finale at a diner which makes complete sense and wouldn't have worked better any other way. Pulp Fiction begins and ends in almost the same time period, but we as the viewers know much more about the characters at the end that we didn't know when the movie first started. It was a clever idea which breathed new life into the gangster picture. Pulp Fiction's time twist was one that many other films followed with moderate success. The most recent being 2005s Sin City, another incredible film.Great scenes, Great dialogue, great characters, and a great story. This movie has it all and as directed by Quentin Tarantino is one of the best movies made in the 90s. It is definitely Tarantino's greatest achievement and should've won best picture in 1994.",10,1,3,6 April 2006
Titanic," An excellent movie
","I know there are some out there who snicker at this movie when it is mentioned, yet if so many people hated it, why is it the biggest selling movie of all time in America. It sold more than Star Wars, and George Lucas released that movie more than once. I found this shocking, but it happened. Ticket sales don't lie, and for those who laugh at this movie now, they are probably some of the same ones that saw it in the theater. Hypocrites.My own experience with Titanic was a good one and yes I am a guy. I enjoyed the back story that followed before the sinking, and this is probably Cameron's best film to date. Yes it's even better than the first two Terminator films and Aliens, and they are all movies that I appreciated.Many didn't like this film because of Leonardo DiCaprio. Yes he's given better acting performances in other movies (What's Eating Gilbert Grape), but in Titantic he was still very good. Of course I don't think people dislike DiCaprio because of his acting. They just don't like him for some reason. Yet I never heard anything bad about him before Titanic made him a mega superstar.In my opinion, Titanic is a great film. It was one of the best in 1997 and was still popular in the summer of 1998 when it was still being shown in the theaters. That alone is a fantastic achievement. So all you hypocrites can laugh all you want. The fact is that this movie is still well liked by many, and is still the biggest selling movie of all time in 2006. Update, very late I know. Avatar surpassed this movie in sales directed by who else, James Cameron again. Incredible.",10,5,10,13 January 2006
The Happening," Good premise, but very poor follow through
","All of Shylaman's older works were his best, but with this film, he brings us a poorly drawn story with some very bad dialoque and acting. I loved the premise, but the movie itself doesn't deliver.THe story starts off in Central Park, where we find the average people doing their average routine. Than there's the ominous wind blowing through the trees, and suddenly people freeze in time it seems and suddenly start to do uncharacteristic things like walking backwards, talking as if disoriented and then, well you will know if you see the movie. Other events start happening as well. One of the more important scenes happens at a construction sight, but I will offer no spoilers here.Cut to a teacher (Mark Wahlberg) talking about the disappearance of Honey Bees with his class where he is soon interrupted by the vice principal, who leads him from the class to the auditorium where all other teachers have gathered and are discussing what has happened. Of course school is dismissed, and Elliot Moore (Wahlberg) is soon leaving town with his wife Alma (Zooey Deschanel) his friend Julian (John Leguizamo) and Julian's daughter Jess (Ashlyn Sanchez) to escape what is happening. They are soon confronted with the fact that whatever is happening is now spreading from bigger cities into the smaller towns and on. WHat happens along the way? I will say no more. I will say though that you do learn what is causing the problem. At least Shylaman doesn't leave us hanging.I loved the idea. THe plot is preachy but I think it could've worked much better if Shylaman had let someone else write the story. Like I said above the dialogue in this movie is really bad, and the actors seem embarrassed or just not sure what to do. THe Happening suffers from some of the same things that hurt The VIllage a couple years ago. Shylaman is good with building suspense and making things ominous and spooky as he always has been. I also loved the score to the movie, but none of these things can save this movie from being anything but below average. Sorry, but this movie cannot be recommended.",4,1,4,18 June 2008
The Departed," Unbelievable film
","The Departed was one of the best movies I've seen in awhile. The characters, including the minor roles, were spectacular an humorous. The story itself was well done and for a movie over two hours long, it sure wasn't boring.Martin Scorsese is one of the premiere directors of his generation. He helped make Robert DeNiro one of the greatest movie actors ever, and with the Departed he shows that he still has what it takes to make a clever movie. With movies like Taxi Driver, Raging Bull, and Mean Streets to his credit, The Departed fits rather well in that great selection of movies.The plot is not real complex. Jack Nicholson plays Frank Costello, the leader of the Irish Mafia in Boston. The police department is trying to find hard evidence on him so they can finally arrest him. They use a spy of their own named Billy Costigan(Lenardo DeCaprio) to try and get the information they need too finally catch the man. However unknown to the police department, Costello has his own mole planted in the FBI. His name is Colin Sullivan (Matt Damon), and he always lets Costello know what's going down before the police can ever catch him. This cat and mouse game is played throughout the entire movie and has the audience wondering how both characters, Costigan, and Sullivan, are going to manage this all without being caught themselves.This all leads to a violent conclusion which had everybody in shock. Some people were disappointed and some were just plain surprised. I was one of those that was surprised by what went down because it happens so quickly that the audience of the film has no time to react. The final scene on the other hand is somewhat predictable and that alone is probably the only weakness of this film.Overall this film is probably one of the best I've seen all year. All the characters were great, even the minor ones. Mark Wahlberg in particular has a hilarious role, and I mean that in a good way. Martin Sheen and Alec Baldwin were also very good as was Vera Farmiga who plays a clinic psychologist for the police department. Very well made movie and worth the ticket price.",9,1,1,11 October 2006
Die Hard," The first is still the best of the four
","I liked Die Hard with a Vengeance, and Die Hard 2, and I also enjoyed the fourth film in the series, but the original Die Hard is still the best of the four movies. It introduced us to John McClane, a role that would become Bruce Willis' most successful character, and gave us one of the best action films of all time.John McClane (Willis), a New York police officer, flies to LA to meet his wife Holly (Bonnie Bedalia) who has transferred there because of a job. Their marriage is strained, and this is McClane's attempt at trying to mend the problems between them and keep the marriage working. Enter a group of terrorists led by Hans Gruber (Alan Rickman in a much earlier role before Harry Potter). The terrorists quickly cease control of the Nakatomi Tower where Holly works, and suddenly there is a hostage situation. McClane manages to escape and becomes the only salvation for the hostages and himself in a standoff which pits him alone against all the terrorists. Die Hard is one fantastic action film. The story is very well done, and the action and pacing is incredible, as it moves at breakneck speed. John McTeirnan, the director, not only gives us great action, but he gives us believable characters. Casting Alan Rickman as the lead villain was smart because with a film like Die Hard, you need a villain who is as good as the hero, and Rickman is up to the task with Willis. Between all the gun play and furious battle sequences, we have some minor roles that are also given some time. Reggie Johnson as Sgt. Al Powell is wonderful in a role as the first officer of the law that McClane comes in contact with over the radio. Bonnie Bedalia, as McClane's wife Holly, also plays a good role.In fact just about everything in this movie works until we get to meet Police Chief Dwayne Robinson (Paul Gleason). His role in this movie should've been cut, since he really has nothing at all to do except be wrong all the time in every situation. He even has a few one-liners which fail miserably because his character is so completely incompetent, you find yourself wondering how he got the job of police chief in the first place. It is because of this one character that Die Hard loses a star.Overall Die Hard was fast, ferocious, fast paced, and offered some great stunt sequences and explosions. It's too bad that we had to have one annoying and useless character as a big flaw in and otherwise superb action thriller.",9,1,2,6 August 2007
Psycho," The Ultimate Horror movie
","Psycho was one of Alfred Hitchcock's most famous works. It gave us a killer that looks like the rest of us. He could be living next door to you and you wouldn't know he's a killer unless you became one of his victims.Norman Bates (Anthony Perkins) runs a motel. One day Marion Crane (Janet Leigh) stops overnight to rent one of the rooms. She has a secret, and that secret is that she just stoled 40 thousand dollars in an attempt to get her boyfriend Sam Loomis (John Gavin) to leave his wife an marry her. She finds more then she bargained for at the motel however.Soon after her sister (Vera Miles) and a friend come looking for her, only to find a little mystery themselves involving Bates and his mother. Bates' mother is never seen clearly on screen, but we do hear her horrible voice a number of times. The mystery surrounding Bates and his mother is now known as one of the biggest shocks in cinematic history, along with a certain shower scene that just about everybody remembers.Alfred Hitchcock uses lighting and camera angles, along with creepy atmosphere, to give us one of the best horror movies ever. The movie is black and white, but this only adds to the scariness of the film. This movie also contains one of the best musical scores of any horror film. I'd say only the Halloween theme matches it for scariest ever.Psycho is, without a doubt, one of the best horror movies ever made, and it deserves its high rating on IMDb. It's in my top five list of greatest horror films and rightfully so.",10,1,3,8 March 2006
Transformers: Revenge of the Fallen," Not as horrible as some say, but not as good as the first either
","I listened to all the critics and some of the people who trashed this film. I still went to see it anyway, and was stunned why it was getting such negativity. I mean some people are making this out to be the worst movie ever, and it's definitely not that horrible. I'll admit it could've been better, which is why I can't quite recommend it, but I'm telling you this is not a piece of trash by a long shot.SOme people are complaining about the twins and how racist they were, but I don't here many people talking about how sexist the movie was against women, and what about the nerdy white FBI guy who was made out to look like a complete idiot, and weak. SO the racism and sexism go more then just one way. In fact if I had to complain about either one of these, I would say it was worse against women then anything. All the women are made out to look like nothing more than sex symbols. Let's see, we had a robot humping the leg of Megan Fox, and the other women in this film do little or nothing but look gorgeous.On top of all this, the parents of Sam weren't used properly in this movie like in the first. In the first movie they helped to make the movie more fun, but this time they offer no humor other than the mother getting high on drugs and going around making a fool of herself on a college campus showing everybody Sam's baby booty's. THis was in bad taste in my opinion and not funny at all.Other points that bothered me about this movie were that there were scenes that went on forever and never seemed to want to end. THe final half hour or so was probably the most tedious I ever sat through, but the action scenes before that and the special effects throughout made it a little more bearable. I also like that they made Optimus Prime more of a bad ass. In the first film he was getting whipped by Megatron, but they changed that around with this movie. In fact, Optimus gets some of the better lines in the movie.I've given some factors why this movie was bad, but I also have to applaud the action sequences, as stated above, and the special effects which were great. Transformers is not the type of movie where you go in looking for a good story. Given these facts, to go with the lack of humor from the cast, I give it an average grade of 6 out of 10. Not the trash that people are calling it, but not quite up there where it needs to be a good movie. THats all.",6,0,4,28 June 2009
Rosemary's Baby," For 1968, this movie is a riveting shocker
","In reviewing Rosemary's Baby, a movie that pretty much led to movies like The Exorcist, I have to think back to the year it was released. And upon realizing this, I must say that Rosemary's Baby is a horror movie in the psychological sense. There is no gore whatsoever, but none of that makes this film any less a horror movie.I'm not even sure todays generation of horror movie goers would be able to watch a movie like Rosemary's Baby. It moves very slow and builds tension subtly, leading to the horrifying climax. There are a few shocking scenes, but nothing that would sicken anybody. Today's generation of horror movie buffs might even find Rosemary's Baby to be rather boring, but then things have changed since 1968. You do not have the same audience in 2006 that you had back then. But in watching movies, particularly horror films, for years, I can accept the horrors that Rosemary's Baby brings to the table.Director Roman Polanski directs this movie perfectly and gets incredible performances from his cast, especially Mia Farrow (Rosemary) and Ruth Gordon (Minnie Castavet). From the beginning, this film starts with a gnawing horror that slowly builds throughout, leading to the surprising ending. It is the acting by all the participants as well as clever direction that makes all of this work wonderfully, and like I said above, it does not use gore at all to get its point across.I see that I have not summarize the plot, but if I did, I believe it would only lessen some of the movie's surprises. Let's just say that if you are a horror movie buff, and enjoy slow build-up in your horror movies which leads to a surprising conclusion, then Rosemary's Baby is the movie for you. As I've emphasized above, this film has no explicit gore whatsoever. There are some mild violent scenes but nothing that would gross anybody out. You've got to realize this movie was released in the late 60s, and that was five years before The Exorcist. If you can accept that, and watch this movie, then maybe you will see why this movie is a cult favorite among many horror movie buffs.",9,2,5,13 August 2006
War of the Worlds," One of Spielberg's worst
","War of The Worlds is full of fantastic special effects, but where it lacks is in story and poor direction. Let me explain.The movie starts out very well. We learn about the characters, nothing surprising because they are the usual stereotypes. An uncaring father, and his two children who are angry with him for being that way. We soon see a lightning storm which causes everything to shut down, cars, electricity, watches, you name it. Soon after a large tripod comes exploding up out of the earth and quickly proceeds to disintegrate everybody. I liked these scenes and was finding myself getting into the film. I even ignored some of the implausibilities, like someone using a camcorder to film even though everything is supposed to be dead. But after this scene the film starts to slowly get worse and finally disintegrates into and ending so unbelievable that I found myself staring at the screen and going what the ****. However, I'm not finished with my summary yet.Well the Tom Cruise character, and his two annoying kids, take a van that seems to be the only automobile still running and race away from the scene. Later they stop in another house and manage to survive a plane wreck and also find a convenient path around the plane wreckage to make there way towards Boston where the mother and step father have gone. Yeah right.They soon take a ferry, which is attacked by the tripods, and manage to get safely away from its capsizing, only to swim onto the opposite shore where they see the US army fighting against the tripods and losing. The son decides he has to see what's going on and tells his father 'If you love me you'll let me go.' I'm not sure I quoted that completely right but you have the idea.Well Cruise's character lets the son go and together him and the daughter go into the basement of some crazy guy, played by Tim Robbins. This is where the movie really goes downhill as more time is spent in that basement then on anything going on outside. The Tim Robbins character is totally useless to this film and so is an annoying scene when the snakelike eye comes searching in the basement looking to see if anybody's in there. This was done much better in the original and was not so drawn out. We even have the aliens come down into the basement where the characters are hiding to do nothing but play with a bicycle? Come on. And even they are not that impressive. I think it would've been much better if we had only gotten glimpses of them, like in the original and more superior film.And now onto this movie's biggest problem, the pacing and the overall storyline. The pacing is extremely choppy and the story itself gives us little to understand. Like why did they come and don't you think they would've learned if the germs on our planet would kill them? When the aliens do attack it is superb, yeah I'll grant it this, but then we have the interaction with the characters. Let me tell you, the scenes involving the characters only succeeded in making me yawn. And since most of the movie was about the Cruise character and his family, well you have my answer to that already.After all this, we get the inexplicable ending. It was and ending that was so horribly done and so utterly unbelievable, that I almost threw something at the screen before realizing that I was in a movie theater and would probably get in trouble if I did that. I will go no farther with explaining it.Let me say that this is probably the worse movie that I've seen all summer. The special effects though are very good, but the movie itself has no real heart. Jaws, Duel, and the Indiana Jones movies were all much better as was Minority Report, Spielberg and Cruise's last collaboration.",4,7,13,4 July 2005
30 Days of Night," Some cool scenes and good acting, but still not one of the best vampire movies
","Based on the graphic novel, which I haven't read, 30 days of Night has some effective moments, good acting, intense scenes and great visuals, but it still isn't quite up there with the better vampire movies.Barrow, Alaska, the northern most town in the US, is plunged into 30 days of darkness. Taking advantage of the lack of sunlight for 30 days, a gang of lethal and nasty vampires descend upon the town to feast on the living. It is up to the local sheriff Eben Oleson (Josh Hartnett) and his estranged wife Stella (Melissa George) to protect the town's dwindling populace against certain destruction.There are quite a lot of effective moments in 30 Days of Night. I like the look of the film as well as the look of the vampires. There are quite a few good scenes as well, but one of the best, and many have stated it here already, is the aerial view of the vampires attacking many of the town's folk who try to fight back with weapons that just don't work on vampires.The acting for a horror movie is also quite good. I actually cared about the good guys. Both Josh Harnett and Melissa George were very effective in their roles, as were the secondary characters. I also have to give the lead villain his due as well. Danny Huston, as the lead vampire Marlow was good. Ben Foster also appears in the movie. He is only known as the Stranger, but he comes to Barrow with a mission as well, which I won't disclose for it may be a minor spoiler.30 Days of night has a lot of good points, but I felt as if some scenes moved a little to slow, and there were some points in the movie that went nowhere. I think if the film had been shorter it would've been better, but these weren't the points that really bothered me as much as two of the characters that do things that make little sense. I can see why they did what they did, but why do things that make it easier for the vampires to get you. One character does something that was a little crazy, but not as disappointing as that of another character. The latter character does something even more far fetched at the end, which leads to a fight sequence which I found hard to swallow. Yes I've heard that this scene is in the graphic novel. Maybe it works in there, but what always works in a graphic comic doesn't always work in a movie. Still, 30 Days of Night was better then most horror films. At least it wasn't just torture porn like so many other films. I think if you are a horror fan you will enjoy this movie. I will award it a C+.",6,2,5,20 October 2007
One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest," A very disturbing yet incredible movie going experience
","One Flew Over the Cukoos Nest had a deep impact on me, especially the ending which of course I will not reveal.Randall Patrick McMurphy (Jack Nicholson) pretends to be crazy in order to get out of prison and work. He is sent to a mental institution instead, and this is where we meet the other patients in the ward. This movie had a lot of actors that would go onto long careers in film. Danny Devito, Christopher Lloyd, and Brad Dourif were all a part of this phenomenal movie, and they all gave incredible performances.McMurphy soon becomes a hero of sorts for the patients and helps them to improve their psychological well being. Of course soft spoken Nurse Ratched (Louise Fletcher) doesn't like this as it starts to affect her domineering control over the patients. She is truly one of the most evil villains of all time and deserved her Oscar just as much as Nicholson deserved his.This movie was well directed and well acted. I don't think any other movie actors could've made it even half as good. The movie's pacing was excellent, and it also contained some funny moments, but the one thing I didn't like about the movie was that it was one sided towards the patients. With the exception of Scatman Crothers as the night orderly, all the workers, doctors, and nurses seemed inhuman and hateful in this film. We never got any other sort of view of them. Maybe that was the point of the movie, but it still left me a little uncomfortable. After seeing this movie, I don't think I would ever want to be committed to a mental institution ever. So I'll give it a solid 9 out of 10.",9,1,2,11 March 2007
American Gangster," This film leaves an impact
","American Gangster was an interesting film which was never boring even though it was nearly three hours long. THe performances were pretty good as were the surprise acts of violence. I wouldn't consider it a great film, but it is definitely worth seeing if you want to see how drug empires are built.It is the 1970s, and detective Richie Roberts (Crowe) believes that there is a new Kingpin in town dealing heroin. The new Kingpin is Frank Lucas (Washington), and he has built an empire through payoffs and crooked deals. He quickly moves up in the ranks to become one of the most powerful American crime lords which rivals that of the mafia.Roberts, and outcast cop in his own precinct because of his complete honesty and belief in the judicial system, works painstakingly to bring the empire of Frank Lucas down. In his efforts he has to deal with plenty of corruption. One man in particular gives him the biggest trouble, and that would be detective Trupo (Brolin in a fine performance) who makes it as difficult for Roberts as he can.So here we have a battle of wills, and though Roberts and Lucas don't meet until near the end of the movie, each still remains an integral part of the plot. You can't really understand the movie unless you are able to see both men for who they are. It makes the ending even more powerful.Ridley Scott, as usual, shows that he can still direct. The pacing was fantastic and not once did I think the movie dragged. The only small plot that I had a problem with was Richie and his wife's custody battle over their son. It just didn't seem to fit into this movie for some reason, but the rest of the movie is fantastic. I wouldn't say it was the greatest performance for Crowe or Washington, but what they brought to the table was well above average. I highly recommend this movie because it went into details about how corruption can destroy true justice if given the chance. It gives us a side of life that isn't so pleasant and throws it in our faces. A very good movie.",8,0,4,11 November 2007
Hancock," Not your typical superhero movie
","Hancock had a good idea on making a superhero not so perfect. For the first 45 minutes or so it works, but then there is the surprise twist which didn't quite do it for me. On top of this there is no real strong villain to complement the hero. THe acting was pretty good, but otherwise this movie is just a little better than average.Hancock (Will SMith) is a drunken superhero who is the total anti-thesis of your typical hero. He swears, insults people, and uses his powers in a destructive manner, but you can see that deep down he wants to help people and doesn't know the exact way to make himself look better in the eyes of the people. Enter Ray (Justin Bateman) as a PR guy who wants to change Hancock's image for the better. On top of this we have Ray's wife Mary (Charlize THeron) who we can tell by the way she acts around Hancock that they have some type of history together that Hancock is not sure of. I 'll go no farther into the plot, but I will say that with Ray's help, Hancock does change his image for the better, and near the end of the film starts becoming mortal for reasons I can not tell without spoiling the movie.The acting is rather well done, but the special effects do not look as if 150 million was spent. I can accept cheesy special effects if the story works, but with Hancock the story never takes off because he has no real strong villain to face off against. The ending is rather weak, but the acting is well enough to carry it somewhat though not enough for me to recommend it.",6,2,7,7 July 2008
Star Wars: Episode III - Revenge of the Sith," The best of the final 3 films, but Stars Wars and Empire still rule
","Revenge of the Sith was the best of the final three movies, but when I compare it to Star Wars and Empire Strikes Back, it doesn't quite match those two films. I believe most people will agree with me on that assessment, but Revenge still delivers some goodies.The action scenes are incredible and the visuals are stunning. With computer graphics, special effects have come a long way, and there's and ultimate feast of them in this movie. The action sequences are also top rate and some of the best I've seen.Still where this movie slips is in the chemistry between Padme and Anakin (Christensen, and Portman). A lot of this probably has to do with some cheesy dialogue when the two are on screen together. I'm not sure, but neither one showed that love they share, which is what ultimately leads to Anakin's turn to the dark side.The supporting cast was much better. Yoda is on screen much more this time, and with computer animation, he looks as real as the actors surrounding him. He is even given some character development that matches that of Empire when he was just a puppet. Ewan MacGregor, as Obi-Wan, gives his best performance of all the films, and seems to have enjoyed making it. Senator Palpatine (Ian McDiarmid) is also strikingly creepy as the Sith Lord.Overall, Revenge of The Sith was a very memorable film. It may not be as good as Empire or Star Wars, but it's slightly better than Return of The Jedi, the third film in that series, and that's saying something.",8,0,0,28 February 2006
The Shawshank Redemption," Not your usual Stephen King story
","The Shawshank Redemption is based on a story by Stephen King, but if you know what King usually writes about, you will be totally surprised by this film. There are no monsters or creepy crawlies at all. No, instead we are given a story about prison life that involves our two central characters, Andy Dufresne (Tim Robbins) and Ellis Boyd 'Red' Redding (Morgan Freeman), both of whom are convicted of multiple life sentences in Shawshank Prison.Andy is a banker whose life is turned upside down when he is convicted of murdering both his wife and her lover. Sentenced to 2 life prisons, Andy does his best to survive by using his skills as a banker and accountant to move up in the prison world. He soon gains respect from his fellow inmates, especially Red, and not long after both he and Red become good friends. I was never sure what Red was imprisoned for, and though the story is mainly about Andy, Red's role is just as important. Kudos to Morgan Freeman, who gives one of his best performances ever.The movie is well over two hours long, but I was never bored. Frank Darabont, the director and writer of the screenplay, keeps things interesting throughout. The pacing is perfect, and the actors, all of them, kept me engaged in the story. The movie also has some twists and turns which when finally revealed are perfect and add to the film's excitement.The dialog is one of the most important aspects of the film and one of the films strongest points. We may have never learned much about the prison guards or the warden, but we got enough of an idea about them to be satisfied because of the dialog and because of the actors who played those parts. Also dialog is vital in Andy and Red's friendship. Without it, and the great work by the two actors, the film wouldn't have been quite as strong.The only flaw I could find in the story would be in the prison terms for both men. If they are both imprisoned for multiple life sentences, how come they never seem to age over the years? It is a small problem, but it takes away some of the reality of the movie, and so I can't quite give it the perfect rating. Other than that, this is still and incredible movie going experience.Note: I see that Shawshank Redemption is sitting pretty at #2 on IMDb's top 250. I'm not sure it deserves to be that high, but that doesn't stop it from still being superior to many other films on that list.",9,0,2,7 September 2007
Halloween," The father of all slasher movies that include an unstoppable killer
","What else can I say about John Carpenter's Halloween that hasn't been said before. Let's give it a go. Halloween is perhaps the best of all the slasher horror films that gives us the unkillable menace. John Carpenter works his magic by using point of view shots, spooky locations, atmosphere, lighting and darkness, a fantastic musical score and panning camera shots to give us the scariest but not goriest of all films of this kind. Halloween is far superior to the Friday the 13th movies which imitated it. Sean Cunningham does not have Carpenter's skill and went the cheap route by using more gore with Friday the 13th instead. This brings me to the point that gore itself does not make a great horror movie but suspense included with the occasional gory scene does.Back in 1963 on Halloween night a young six-year-old Michael Myers kills his sister after she has sex with her boyfriend. Cut to 15 years later on the night before Halloween 1978, Michael Myers escapes from the institution where he has been kept and returns to Haddonfield on Halloween to continue his murderous rampage on three unsuspecting teenagers who are babysitting for the night. One of the babysitters is of course Jamie Lee Curtis in her first role. Her name in the movie is Laurie Strode.Hot on Michael Myers tail is his doctor Sam Loomis, (Donald Pleasance in his most famous role) who wants to find him and return him to the institution before he kills again. Containing some of Donald Pleasance's most famous lines of dialog, Sam Loomis explains to the police, who are working with him to find Michael Myers, why he has to be found and returned.In this movie, Michael Myers is known as the shape. This of course is the perfect description for what Michael Myers really is, a specter of evil that is unable to be stopped because, as John Carpenter said in one conversation about the movie, you can't destroy evil. This is actually a great explanation because Michael Myers seems to appear out of nowhere like an evil phantom, kills, and then appears elsewhere to create more carnage. He does all of this while wearing a white William Shatner mask that is itself ghostly in appearance.Now to explain some of the technique Carpenter used to make one of the best and most famous slasher movies of all time. Using washed out colors for daylight and deep in-penetrable blackness for night, this adds to the spooky atmosphere of Halloween, making it look like fall even though I believe this movie's setting was done in California in the summertime. Other things used include panning camera shots which have things loom up in front of you almost out of nowhere. Sometimes it is a tree or some other distraction, but than sometimes it is the killer himself, usually the point of view shot when the killer is involved is from the back of his head and over to the left or right. This all adds to making the viewer uncomfortable, and that is the idea. And if all that wasn't enough, who can forget the fantastic musical score which is one of the most famous horror musical scores of all time along with Psycho's.Man I could go on and on about this movie. If anybody is ever a student of film and wants to do a paper on a slasher movie, Halloween would be a great movie to do it on. I'm surprised however that this movie is only rated a 7.8 on IMDP's score. It is a much better film than that. I know that the acting isn''t that great, but is is still better than the acting in the countless imitations that were spawned by it.",10,0,1,23 July 2006
1408," Not bad, but I was expecting more
","1408, based on a short story by Stephen King, has a lot of creeps and chills, but I found myself wishing for more. The film offers some nifty spooks, and is more of a cerebral horror film than anything, but it still felt lacking.John Cusack plays Mike Enslin. He is a writer of ghost stories, but since his daughter has died, he has lost faith and believes that there are no real haunted places to write about. He goes all over the country to stay in haunted rooms to prove that spooky places and ghosts do not exist. One day someone sends him a postcard about the Dolphin Motel in New York and tells him not to go in to room 1408. Seeing a chance to prove another haunt false, he decides to go to the Dolphin Motel and stay in 1408.Once at the hotel, he is accosted by the hotel manager named Gerald Olin, played by Samuel Jackson, who pleads with him not to go into that room. Gerald Olin explains about the deaths that have occurred in there, but Mike Enslin is insistent, and so Gerald Olin reluctantly gives him the key to the room.Once inside the room a few moments pass and Mike is ready to call this another fake haunting, but then a The Carpenters 'We've Only Just Begun' comes blasting out of the radio which he had not turned on, and then strange things start to happen as the clock radio is suddenly counting down the hour. I will say no more about the plot.Mikhael Hafstrum, the director, offers up some genuine chills, and the scenes in the room will feel like a weird mind warp, but I was still expecting him to go farther with the film's clever ideas. He never does, and then the film is over.The acting was well done. John Cusack as usual is good, and Samuel Jackson wasn't bad either. In fact, Cusack's performance helps raise the film to a higher level, and that is one of the biggest reasons why I find myself recommending it even though it needed some more pizazz.",7,3,7,24 June 2007
Iron Man," He's Iron Man
","Iron man is an interesting film in the fact that it deals more with the character and less with the action. DOn't get me wrong, the movie has action, but with Robert Downey Jr. in the title role of TOny Stark/Iron Man, he steals the show and makes Iron Man a pleasant surprise for fans of the character and the comic book. I enjoyed this movie.THe movie starts with Stark (Downey Jr.) talking with American troops in a Hummer in the Middle East. THese first scenes set the character perfectly and lead to the goods that follow. He is at once humorous and likable, and this continues throughout the film's running length. THey are of course attacked. All the troops are killed and Stark, who is a weapon's expert, is taken prisoner by a terrorist group who has used his own weapons against him and America. THe group forces him to build a weapon they can use against their enemies, but he instead creates a suit of armor which he then uses to attack his captures and escape.Once back in America, Stark realizes that the weapons he thought he was developing to help America are being sold to America's enemies. He decides that he must create a suit of armor, like the one he created in the Middle East, to help America and stop the enemy from harming more people. THat is how Iron Man is created, and it goes through two more upgrades before he finally gets the armor to where he wants it.THis movie hits on a lot of issues that are effecting the world today. One of them, and probably the biggest one in the movie, is the corruption that factors into everything. A strong jab is made at the US weapon's industry, and it had a profound effect on me. THe movie makes some strong points about why America is probably struggling, and it all factors into the corruption of the corporate elite and how they will sell their souls to make a buck. It sickening but oh so true.THe director, Jon Favereau, never preaches this, but just lets the viewer know, with subtle hints, that not everything is the rest of the world's fault. It's good, great even, but it's too bad he can't do action as well, which brings me to my next point.The action in Iron Man is there, but it is never in your face like many other blockbuster action films. It is more of a drama than anything. If Downey Jr. didn't pull off the part so well, as well as the rest of the supporting cast which includes Terence Howard as Jim Rhodes, Gwneth Paltrow as Pepper Potts, and Jeff Bridges as Obadiah Stane, this movie might not have made the money it has so far. THey hold the movie together and keep you focused on the characters, and you never really notice how very little action there is. Of course this is an origin story, so maybe the director will do better with the sequel, that is if he comes back to do the sequel.I liked the movie, I liked the performances by all, but Iron Man could've used a little bit more of a kick-ass sense that would of made it an instant classic. Still, it's hard to argue with what we get with Iron Man. It is definitely one of the best Super Hero movies since Spider Man 2, and Batman Begins. And on a final note, make sure you stay until the end credits to see something special and very interesting.",8,1,2,14 May 2008
Beowulf," Good visuals and a decent enough story make this worth watching
","Beowulf is not the greatest film ever made. In fact, it is probably not the best 3D film ever made, but it sure was entertaining. The acting for the most part was rather good, and the 3D visuals were a pleasant surprise.Based very loosely on the ancient poem, Beowulf (Ray Winstone) must fight the monster Grendel who has been terrorizing a town and murdering people. Afterward, he must face Grendel's mother (Angelina Jolie in an enticing role) and years later a dragon. This movie can be taken as a metaphor on life and many of the things we all go through at some point in our lives. One of the most prevalent involves the sins of the father and how those sins can lead to more dangerous things in the future.The story in the movie is not great, but it works well enough in a movie like Beowulf that is 100 percent computer graphic, and actually looks good. The characters, especially Anthony Hopkins as Hrothgar and Angelina Jolie as Grendel's mother, were almost identical to the people playing them in real life. The scenery surrounding the characters was also splendid, and the creation of Grendel almost tops that of Gollum in Lord of The Rings. I really felt for Grendel (played perfectly by Crispin Glover). Instead of making Grendel the horrible beast that he was in the poem, the writers and director made him into a sort of tragic creature that we all pitied.Not much else to say. Beowulf is definitely a movie that entertains until the end. It may not be the best movie you'll see all year, but it definitely isn't the worst.",7,1,3,2 December 2007
Live Free or Die Hard," John McClane is BAAAAck
","It's been so long since I've seen a good action movie outside the comic book stories and Harry Potter, and here is one of the first action movies which brings back and old hero that we all loved. It's been a long time since we saw John McClane (Bruce Willis) in his most famous role, but even after 20 years since his debut in the first Die Hard, the character still works. He may be older, and he may have taken on different roles since Die Hard With A Vengeance, but he hasn't lost his touch as everybody's beloved hero in one of the most famous action series ever.It's July 4th, and suddenly there is an attack on the United States infrastructure through computers which begins shutting the entire country down. The person behind it is a man by the name of Thomas Gabriel (Timothy Olyphant). He is working with a group of people which also includes his Kung-Fu kicking girlfriend (Maggie Q). They are so certain they have control of the country, but they didn't count on our scruffy hero (McClane) who with the assistance of a young computer hacker, will stop at nothing to bring them to justice. That's the plot in simple terms.Like all the Die Hard films, this film is loaded with extraordinary stunts and explosions as well as almost non-stop action which keeps the film moving at a brisk pace. The director Len Wiseman never seems to let up for long, and though some scenes make McClane look like an indestructible machine that keeps coming, they work because of the dialoque and Willis himself. Justin Long, who plays the young computer hacker helping McClane, even has a few of his own snappy lines which never sound lame and seem to mix well with McClane's.Live Free or Die Hard has helped me to once again embrace all the old action films that starred Swarzenegger, Gibson, and Willis himself as well as others which became so popular in the eighties and on into the nineties. It's good to see that Hollywood is still capable of giving us real action films that aren't all CGI like todays action films are. I gladly recommend it even if some of the scenes are way over the top and are borderline impossible for a human being to survive. After all, it is fiction.",8,0,1,30 June 2007
X2: X-Men United," Very entertaining. Better than the first film.
","X-Men 2 was better than the first film. There were more action scenes, and the storyline was also a lot better.X2 starts with an intense sequence in the White House involving the mutant Nightcrawler (Alan Cumming). He is sent to attack the president in order to start trouble for mutants everywhere. He was under the influence of a government official named Stryker(Brian Cox) who has a special serum that allows him to control any mutant's actions. He is the antagonist that all the mutants, including Magneto(Ian McKellen) and his group, have to deal with in order to stop from using Professor Xavier (Patrick Stewart)as a tool to kill all mutants with his great mental powers.All the main characters from the last X-Men film return, with the exception of Sabertooth and Toad, for the sequel which had a more thought out storyline than last time. We also get a new mutant called Deathstrike (Kelly Hu) whose mutant ability is almost the same as Wolverine's. It was fun watching the two of them do battle.X2 was incredibly fun to watch. Most of the performances were right on, but there were a few that still could've used some work just like in the first film. However none of those weaker performances detract from the movies overall appeal. I'm sure most people will enjoy it.",8,0,0,20 April 2006
A Nightmare on Elm Street," Unique Story to go with everybody's favorite bad guy Freddy
","Nightmare on Elm Street was a clever story idea involving dreams and death. I believe the movie got some of its ideas from Phantasm, a movie released in 1979 that many probably don't remember. Nightmare also has Freddy Krueger(Robert Englund), a wisecracking killer who invades teenagers dreams and does very bad things. This movie and the Scream films are Wes Craven's most popular films.A group of teenagers who live on the same street begin to have dreams about a scarred killer who wears a blue and red sweater and a hat. He also has a razor glove on his hand. The dreams prove to be more than just dreams when some of the teenagers begin dying in their sleep with razor cuts caused by the razor glove the killer wears.But Freddy Krueger is not just any ordinary killer. He also has the ability to play with any dream reality, which makes it easier for him to get his victims while they dream and murder them. Of course one teen-aged girl named Nancy (Heather Langenkamp) is determined to fight back and get rid of the grisly fiend once in for all. Of course there is a reason Freddy is killing these particular teenagers, but for those who haven't seen any of the Nightmare films and know very little about them (which I doubt) I will not give that little secret away.This movie also starred Johnny Depp in his first movie role, as well as John Saxon and Ronee Blakely. It boasts very good special effects and gave us one of the most infamous undead villains in Freddy Krueger, putting him up their with Jason Vorhees from the Friday the 13th films and Michael Myers from the Halloween films.Like the Alien movies, one and two in particular, many people compare Friday the 13th, Halloween, and Nightmare on Elm Street. I found that though the first Halloween is better than all of these films put together, Nightmare on Elm Street contains the better sequels, and some of them weren't all that great either. Goes to show you what happens when you make sequels that end up just being gore films without any real suspense.",8,2,2,7 March 2006
300," Fantastic visuals and stunning battle sequences
","300 is based on history and deals with the Battle of Thermopylae which took place in 480 B.C. During this battle the King of Sparta led an army of 300 against over 100,000 Persians led by Xerxes. It was a battle that was said to have inspired all of Greece to band together against the Persians and defeat them. Enough with the history lesson. Lets talk about the movie shall we.The story comes from the graphic novel by Frank Miller (Sin City fame) and is filled with violence and fueled by testosterone. Gerard Butler plays the King of Sparta and leads 300 of his best into battle against the Persians whose overwhelming odds were stopped for three days and probably more if not for a betrayal which led to the death of all 300 Spartans, including King Leonidas himself. There is no real spoiler here because everybody knows how it turned out, after all it is based on history.The story is not as memorable as the visuals and battle sequences though which show limbs being hacked off and blood spraying. Most of the violence is done by computer graphics though, so it is not too horrific. It is the action and gore which kept me glued to my seat the whole entire 2 hour run. It also proves that an R rated movie can still raked in the millions as this movie has done for the past two weeks.The film is not great, but it was entertaining and kept your interest. I'm not sure this movie will be one of those that sticks with you for years, but it sure was gruesomely entertaining.",8,4,10,20 March 2007
Fantastic Four," A decent filmgoing experience
","The Fantastic Four will win no awards. It has a lot of flaws which include too little action and an ending that was over much too quickly. Jessica Alba, though very attractive, does not act well in this film, but the other three, especially Chiklis and Evans, do well enough.In the script, Tim story captured a lot of what made the comic so charming. One thing was the way the four always fought among each other, almost as much as they fought their enemies. He also went for comedy more so then sincerity, and it works for the most part. If marvel fans remember the comic, they will notice these scenes and get a chuckle out of them. The Human Torch was always a prankster, and he always teased the Thing. They were the two that fought one another most of the time as well, and you will see that clearly with this film.A lot of people who have given this movie bad reviews probably never read the comic. I just can't understand all the hate that this movie is getting even though it is much better than War of The Worlds, a film that many people seemed to like, but I found to be rather dull and boring. True the special effects could've been better, but Tim Story did not have the budget that Steven Spielberg was given, so I can forgive him that.Overall I would say that Fantastic Four should've been a little more serious than it was. There were entirely too many jokes and not enough science that could've made it better. I didn't quite accept how they changed Doom's origins from the comic, but it didn't bother me too much. Fantastic Four, to me, was just light hearted fun, and it is not on the same par as Spiderman 2, Superman 1 and 2, or X-men 2. However, it was a whole lot better than The Hulk and Daredevil, and in my opinion better than the first X-men movie.",7,1,3,21 July 2005
John Wick: Chapter 2," John Wick is good.
","I enjoyed the first John Wick, and I enjoyed this one just as much. It more detailed with some world building not seen as much in the first film, which introduced us to this character. THe violence is more graphic. It's like an onslaught that starts from the beginning and never lets up. THis is larger, grittier, and badder, and all in a good way. Keanu Reeves plays his part just as he should, and lo to anybody that gets in his way. THis film is intense, with action scenes that seem more realistic than some of the CGI that takes over other action films. Recommended.",8,1,3,4 March 2017
Star Wars: Episode V - The Empire Strikes Back," Empire Strikes Back and Star Wars
","The Empire Strikes Back and Star Wars. They are two of the best Science Fiction Films of all time, so I found it hard to decide which was the better film. Upon reviewing both for the umpteenth time, I discovered that The Empire Strikes Back had a more rounded storyline. We also found out the mystery of Darth Vader along with better development of all the other characters in the movie. And lets not forget that we were introduced to Yoda as well. I give both films a 10, but if I had to decide, The Empire Strikes Back would win hands down. It was too bad that George Lucas sold out a little with Return Of The Jedi, but I still found that the entire trilogy is one of the best in Science Fiction. Yes, The Empire Strikes Back was much darker, but that was likely why it was the better movie, and Return Of The Jedi the lesser of the three. Still, all three are better than the newer films, but Revenge of The Sith hasn't been released yet, and it sounds real good. So I'm on wait and see mode for the final film. Here's hoping it's better than Phantom Menace and Attack of The Clones. Two films that I still enjoyed, but not as much as the earlier ones.",10,0,1,23 March 2005
V for Vendetta," A thought provoking movie that'll have people asking questions
","V for Vendetta was a well made film with quality acting. It was also thought provoking and will make you wonder about your own government.V stars Hugo Weaving as a vigilante that wears a Fawkes mask and uses tactics which resemble terrorism to fight back against the totalitarian government that controls Britain. He also uses television to let the country's population understand that the government they allow to control them is wrong. He wants people to know that it was their fear which created this dictatorship government that has taken away their rights, and now he wants them to stop being afraid.He is not alone however. For a young woman (Natalie Portman), whom he saves from imprisonment, becomes a sort of ally in his quest to destroy the government so that people will no longer live in fear an oppression. She doubts him at first, and it takes awhile for her to ally with him, but she finally does, and the story goes from there.It's been awhile since I've seen a movie as thought provoking as this one. Mind you I haven't seen Crash or any of the other Oscar nominated films, but I digress. Let's just say that V for Vendetta will have viewers questioning authority and maybe open some eyes to what is going on around them. I'm sure many will think that this movie is a bashing of the Bush administration, but don't let that fool you. It's talking about the possibility that any government, no matter what country, can become out of control if its people allow it.Besides quality acting, V moves at a good pace. I did not once get bored watching it. The director James McTeigue never allows the movie to get dull even during the more quiet scenes.The Wachowski brothers, who created another future world with the extremely popular Matrix trilogy, have themselves another winner here. They really know how to get an audience thinking about the real world around them and start questioning the way things are being done. You really can't ask for more.The visuals are pretty hard to comment on. They were decent enough, but sometimes things moved so fast, that it made it hard to really give an opinion about them. But I was not disappointed with what I saw.V for Vendetta is definitely a very good movie. It is one I would highly recommend to anybody who has ever questioned the way things are done when it comes to those governing them.",8,1,3,18 March 2006
The Godfather," One of the Greatest Movies of all time
","Yes I'm talking about The Godfather. It's one of the best motion pictures out there. I don't know if it should be at #1 on IMDPs top 250, but it definitely belongs in the top 10.So many stars. Al Pacino looks so young in this picture, as does James Caan with all the dark hair. They are two of three brothers in the Corleone family. Michael (Pacino) is the youngest and wants nothing to do with the family business, but Sonny (Caan) is easily angered and flies off the handle a lot, especially when it involves the abuse of his sister Connie (Talia Shire). They have another brother named Fredo (John Casale), but he does not have the leadership ability of the other two.Seeing over all of this is the late great Marlon Brando as Don Corleone. He is father too all the Corleone children and is also known as the Godfather by everybody else. He wields the most power, but that power is tested by four other powerful families who are also vying for what the Don has. This leads too much deceit and murder as the leaders of the other four families look to unseat Don Corleone from the top.This movie is 175 minutes long. Usually when I watch a drama that long, I am unable to get through it. Not so with the Godfather. Francis Ford Coppola, who directed, manages to keep you're interest throughout. Yes the film moves at a leisurely pace, but it is never boring. His directing is helped greatly by the actors who give some of their greatest performances ever. Marlon Brando definitely deserved the Oscar for Best Actor.It is also interesting to watch how Pacino's character Michael changes as the film goes on through to the end. The sequence during the baptism is one of the best ever. I could say more about that, but I don't want to spoil it for those who haven't seen this great great film.Is this the single greatest movie of all time? I don't know about that, but it is definitely ONE of the best films of all time and deserved the Oscar for Best Picture in 1972. How can anybody think this movie is dull is beyond me.",10,1,4,12 April 2006
