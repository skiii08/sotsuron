First Man," Pores in shaky-cam and some exiting landings
","This movie is prime example of how to spoil a decent film with cheap trick called shaky cam use. I had to keep my eyes closed when I got too fed up of seeing close ups of shaking faces, so close I can see the pores, even though this was filmed with some grainy filter. I guess they were trying to make it look 'old'. There is lots of slow stone-face dialogue, that was quite opposite that I was expecting of a film like this. When this stone-faced dialogue or long silences are 'enhanced' with shaky-cam, it becomes a tedious experience to watch.
This movie has some exiting landings, but that is about it. Actors are decent, but they cannot really show their best emotional finesses, because of the damn shaky-cam use. Script is not very exiting, it makes Neil Armstrong look like a boring man.
This movie left me feeling disengaged and bored too. I do not recommend seeing in a big screen, it is a waste of money. Wait until it comes to Netflix and scroll through the boring bits.
With the attitude of the makers of this movie, we would never have landed of the moon. They did not put even mediocre effort to this one.",4,0,3,4 December 2018
