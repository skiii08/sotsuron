Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," Run!-Do Not Walk! to see this film
","Simply put-this film has universal appeal-universal across genders, ages, races, and so on. George Lucas, as usual, resets the standard as far as pushing the envelope for creative film-making.One caveat-in order to completely enjoy the film, it must be viewed a second time to appreciate the nuances of characters, plot points, and, of course, to see the incredible effects.Thank you, George-Keep up the excellent work!",Null,0,0,22 May 1999
