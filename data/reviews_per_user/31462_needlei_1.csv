Blade Runner 2049," Good atmosphere but unlikely future.
",The movie has an interesting atmosphere but it describes a very unlikely future which really spoils the movie for me. 'No trees in 2049' is not something we would believe in 2017. I understand that it is a sequel and so it happens in 2049 but the issue is that we are watching it in 2017 and not in 1982 and we no longer believe in the possibility of such 'future'. This makes the movie more of a fantasy than of a science fiction.,7,0,2,23 March 2018
