The Blair Witch Project," don´t blow this one by watching it with friends in daylight!
","Anyone that ever was in a forest would probably get scared. The idea of setting it up as a documentary is great. The friends really gets scared as the movie runs on and you can feel their desperation. Not showing the witch, the enemy is also great. The signs that the three friends find in the forest build up the tension. See this one when it´s dark, at night. And you should be alone to, if yaou dare. Then if it works for you, you will probably have a hard time to fall asleep when you go to bed, and you will not want to sleep in the forest thats for sure.",8,0,1,24 January 2002
Memento," A very great idea turns into a good film
","The idea of the film is great. But after a while, it seems like this could have turned out better. The film tries to be smart, and it surelly is. But it should be moore important to get some substance in it than just trying to be smart all the time. This is a film that you can see more that one time. You will probabbly like it if you are into Quentin Tarantinos films or a film like The usual suspects. However, I don´t think that this one can match films like that one or Reservoir Dogs in te end.",7,0,1,24 January 2002
Rear Window," Hitchcocks best movie!
","I think this one is the mans best film ever. If you like this film, there is a fiml called somebody´s watching me that is quite similar to this one. That´s pretty good to so se it if you like Rear Window. I won´t take time to tell you moore. Just see this Hitchcock movie now!",10,0,2,24 January 2002
Gladiator," Pretty cool fights but the political dialog sucks big time
","Talking about overrated movies, this one probably takes the Oscar. Seems like the creators thought that just because they had the money to do what they wanted in the artificial wat, they could skip the story and the dialog. Only worth seeing for the pretty impressive fights.Highly overrated movie, try Spartacus instead!",6,0,1,24 January 2002
