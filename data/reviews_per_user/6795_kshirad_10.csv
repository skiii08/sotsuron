Insidious: Chapter 2," A rare achievement!
","I was not ready for this sequel. I thought this is going to be bad or lacking in scares and suspense, after the release of 'The Conjuring'. Well, i was entirely wrong. Right from the very start, my eyes were frozen to the screen. I can't take my eyes off of it.The story continues directly from the first one, with a little flashback about Josh Lambert. There's something wrong after the events occurred in the first movie proceeded. It's not finished yet with the family. I really cannot spoil the plot because you will have to see it for yourself, and experience it.There's so much element that's better than the first. Technically, it is very crafty. You won't suspect it coming. When some of the situation went over-the-top, there's more comic relief to cool down the tension. But, over-the-top never mean it's laughable. The tension it got was very unnerving and got under my skin. I don't get easily scared at horror movies. Yet, I screamed involuntarily.This is what a horror movie should be like. James Wan has a talent for directing. It never feels derivative or predictable. You just have to hang on with the ride. Horror geeks will love this movie. It's what a sequel should be, and it is a total blast.Note: Patrick Wilson's performance here is excellent. And I hope Insidious: Chapter 3 will not suck.",10,1,2,18 January 2014
The Equalizer," Violent... and monotonous!
","Don't get me wrong, i love Denzel Washington. I love every action flick he plays in 'cause he brought such charisma on the big screen. This one is an exception. I was ready to get pumped up by all the gore galore and crazy fight choreographs... and it's not what i am expecting, at all! The story is about a man named Bob McCall, a mysterious man i might add, who stumbles upon the world of Russian gangster. He met a girl named Teri, who is one of their prostitute, that one day got beaten. Bob got furious and goes for vengeance against them.The movie got me all right, but i've never been so bored in my life. Let's start from the action. It didn't work. It supposed to give me any impact, yet i felt nothing. Blood are spurting everywhere, all right. But, why do they have to make it so bland?The actors done all their things the script requires... nothing evoked emotions from me. I blame the screenwriters for giving no depth and not a single twist. Bad move!Although, there are several things i'm going to highlight, like the camera-work. I loved Antoine Fuqua's style and it gives the movie more dignity than it was. And some scene involving Chl√∂e Grace Moretz with Denzel gave me a little bit interest for the dynamic they showed. I know Denzel Washington fans are going to love it, but just a fair warning; it's not really fun to watch even if the violence pushes your button. In the end, it's a bit of a dud.",4,12,23,27 September 2014
The Babadook," A one-of-a-kind masterpiece!
","Seeing the title, i was hesitant with the movie. I mean, it's a little ridiculous and it got me thinking it's some kind of throwaway comedy/horror. But, NO! This movie blew my expectations out of the water. I was trying to close my ears and eyes when the scares started yet i can't miss a scene of this gem.It is a story about a grieving mother with a single child after the death of the father seven years later. Coping from her grief, one day her son found a storybook named 'Mister Babadook'. And then... I just can't tell you 'cause it would only ruin the surprise!I gotta tell you i was not expecting much. But, everything seems to be running smoothly. From its' cinematography to its' acting. The actors did an excellent job portraying the bleak family, bringing tension to the highest level possible. And the Babadook... I just can't believe this is just a low budget movie. It's flawless!",10,11,25,6 August 2014
The Lego Movie," One of the most dazzling movies i've seen so far!
","Don't get me wrong, but this is the most dazzling movie i've seen. The animation was perfectly staged and drawn, you just can't believe what you've just seen.I can't throw away the plot (except if you've seen the trailer) because it will diminish the fun. I'm just going to tell you this, you will laugh just as much as you've hit the treadmill. And there's an unexpected twist towards the end that will surprise and blow you away. Trust me, it will not disappoint you.All the way through, a start-to-finish delight, an incredible and original movie, a marvelous experience!",10,7,18,7 February 2014
Avengers: Endgame," Second chances and swan songs (sort of)
","By the time I'm reviewing this, I've already booked a ticket for a second watch. I've may not watched the entire MCU films yet, but I've been following the series since IRON MAN 2, so I'm more or less a fanboy (and I'm eager to watch the other ones later). But, I will try to remain as unbiased as possible and not spoil the story. In the case of this movie, I've already prepared for what's going to happen... or so I thought?Man oh man, where do I begin?By this point, (almost) everyone has watched 'Infinity War' and been anticipating the next big thing. The movie started with the heroes feeling scattered and somewhat hopeless. All kinds of emotions are stirring inside them as they are desperate to fix what's happening around them. One way or another, they found hope and a possibility to restore what has been lost and unjustly taken. But, it also comes with a price, and it ain't cheap.That's the best way I could describe the film without going into spoiler territory. The other thing I would say about it is that it takes inspiration from other films and pay tribute to them in a way that feels fresh and exciting. Most importantly is how they put their whole heart on their sleeves. It's really hard to go through this movie without trying to hold back tears, and not laughing. It's also appropriate as it is the culmination of what came before in the MCU and astoundingly achieves a balance of emotional catharsis and genuine humor throughout.I can't deny how uniformly strong the performances are, most notably Robert Downey Jr. Since he started in Iron Man, we've been seeing him grow as a character and it is a career-defining role. He almost stole the entire film with his tour de force acting. He really caught me by surprise by how nuanced and heartbreaking his story has been taking him through. I doubt the Oscars would consider a nomination for him for the second time, but it's still well-deserved. Other standouts are Chris Evans and Scarlet Johansson, even Chis Hemsworth. Captain America has been a really stoic character, but now he gets to flex his emotions a bit more and my lord, how satisfying it is. Black Widow wasn't given a lot of character arc before but now is put into the forefront, not only she radiates sadness through her eyes, but also desperation and longing which is rare to see in the MCU. Thor grew on me more and more since THOR:RAGNAROK, and he balances humor and drama with aplomb, especially in showing his emotions. Honorable mentions goes to Mark Ruffalo, Jeremy Renner, Paul Rudd and Karen Gillan. I've never seen Hulk as this balanced and neutral character. Hawkeye has never been grittier. Ant-Man is always the comic relief but here also provides as a ray of light in the darkness with his wit and dry humor. Surprisingly, Nebula is the character I've never seemed to care about, only to shred her layers of toughness and see her sad vulnerability.There's still so much to unpack and unload in this unbelievable 3-hour movie and yet, it doesn't feel like one. Granted, it does get a bit long and messy at times, but that's part of the story and it somewhat enhanced my involvement in it. Even great movies tend to drag sometimes, and this one has such a clear-cut vision so it's forgivable. Again, nothing's perfect.Narratively speaking, it's as satisfying as a finale can be. Just when you think it would go this way, the movie goes to another. There's still so much surprises in store and I thought it sticks the landing. The overarching theme speaks volumes and struck a chord in me.I cheered, I laughed and I (almost) cried. Basically, an emotional rollercoaster and easily one of the most unforgettable movie-going experience I've ever had and I can't wait to watch it again to soak it all in (maybe the second time I'll cry haha).They ended the era with a bang, and I'm looking forward for what they still have in store for us.",10,0,3,26 April 2019
Avengers: Age of Ultron," 'Avengers: Age of Ultron' is yet to be one of the best blockbusters of 2015!
","One of the strengths of its' predecessor, 'The Avengers', is how the makers managed to blend characters and action together, giving either excitement and emotional satisfaction. This time around, it is more ambitious than ever. So, does it work? Yes, it does.Telling the plot would only spoil the experience. When I first watched the trailer, I knew nothing about it. All I know is there is a talking robot and mass destruction. Going in unprepared was totally the right choice that I made.All I'm going to say is this; A:AOU is going to be one of the best movies in 2015. From the exciting opening to the thrilling finale, this bad boy will leave you breathless. Talking about breathless, the action was spectacular. It is on par with the first one. The star-studded casts are amazing, as always. What I admire most is the screenplay. It makes the characters more... human. They are relatable than ever. The movie has some psychological depth that was not really fleshed out before. Conclusion: It was a satisfying experience. Go watch it!",10,8,22,22 April 2015
Joker," Hard to watch, hard to look away.
","By the time the roll credits started to show up, I was still not prepared to properly rate this movie. I would say it's one of the most overwhelming experience I've had in the cinema. After letting it simmer for a while, I'm definitely confident to say that it's one of the best movies this year thus far.The story of 'Joker' shows us the downward spiral of Arthur Fleck, a down-on-his-luck comedian and a mentally unstable man with a disorder that prompts him to laugh uncontrollably at any situation that causes stress.That's enough of a plot description, because what you are about to see is a harrowing journey that at some point will make you so uncomfortable you almost can't bear it. Not saying that it went too far, violence-wise, but it's almost too depressing to be entertaining.Joaquin Phoenix embodies the character so well and convincing that you can't help but be in awe of what he has achieved here. It's almost a one-man show, to be honest. The side characters are sidelined (pun intended) just so we could witness his transformation from this meek, nice guy to the titular Joker. Still, Robert DeNiro as the talk show host also served as a highlight.I'd also say that I was never bored throughout the 2-hour runtime, given the grim and oppressive nature of the story. The slow-burn pacing is top notch and contrasted with some gruesome violence. Yes, it has visual cues from Scorcese classics (the aforementioned 'Taxi Driver' is one of them) but there's nothing to distract me as unoriginal or something of a copy and paste. Some developments are really surprising and managed to bring some intrigue that will bring viewers to question what's really true or not, most importantly how it ties with a particular character (you could guess who it is).I gotta say that this has the best third act any movie could offer. My jaw dropped right at the climax for how audacious and sharp the way things were handled in it. There are powerful messages on how society works and how we should treat people with mental illness, especially to people like Arthur in this day and age that will resonate with me long after I watched it.Overall, I do think it has a staying power to be an essential movie or a classic outside the comic-book genre. Despite the controversy and the polarizing reviews, I'd recommend seeing it for how it pushes the boundary in commercial and mainstream filmmaking.",10,3,5,3 October 2019
Edge of Tomorrow," Why bother on originality when the execution is so well-handed?
","There are multiple plot strands from other films gathered into a union. I won't give you any hint but you'll get it when you see it. Nowadays, movies are short on originality. But, in this case, you won't give a thing about it. Premise: An inexperience military officer was sent to war to fight an alien race invading the earth. In the middle of the battlefield, he got into an accident which causes him to go into time- loop that repeats each moment when he dies.The basis of the plot looks familiar... That could be a big problem. On the contrary, it succeeded to provide a big summer blockbuster satisfaction. The pacing is perfect, the acting is perfect. Oh, and did i mention the effects? It was ragin'!See this movie with low expectations (2D or 3D doesn't matter)...",9,216,304,28 May 2014
Lucy," Call me crazy...
","...but i can't help raving enough on this movie. A lot of action movies fall out short on brains, yet this is top of the line. Whether you like it or not, you have to be attentive and focused to understand. Oh, but don't worry, you won't need to, 'cause you will be pinned down to your seat the whole ride.The story actually starts simple, but gets complicated as it goes. A girl named Lucy gets kidnapped in drug deal and something goes on about some discussion about how people's brains work and that we only use 10% of it, and some drug that could make people use their brains to 100%, and... you'll know where it's going at. Simply put, this is one of the best action movies i've ever seen. It tries to merge science-fiction and action, and i think that it's very ambitious. But, sometimes it could come out as a misfire. This one in particular, is not the case. I found every aspect of this movie perfect. From its' opening shot to the final. Character developments aside, it runs briskly and fast-paced at a rate of 89 minutes. Thrills are on the way from one scene to another. Scarlett Johansson runs the show. She gives Lucy's character to life. I don't even notice that it's even her anymore as the movie plays. The other cast done well with their given characters and although they don't give the movie more seasoning, they don't go down to be obnoxious. I heard some people really love and trash the movie at the same time. I understand why. Some will dismiss it as downright silly for the everything-is-possible way the movie goes and all the philosophy is total bull***t. But, that's not the reason to go to movies for pure logic and plausibility, right?. You go to them for entertainment. I think this movie is pure entertainment.Luc Besson has brewed a magnificent, thought-provoking, fun, silly, and sometimes weird and creepy movie. i'm hoping for more like this to come",10,15,32,26 August 2014
The Hunger Games: Catching Fire," There's only one word to describe this film: SPECTACULAR!
","Sequels rarely live up to its predecessor. But in this case, aside from the fact that it's adapted from the book, it's expanded. It's a start-to-finish entertainment. With a gap only for one year and eight months from the first one, This is a solid fare.The movie continues the events from the first movie. Katniss Everdeen (the remarkable Jennifer Lawrence) is still struggling from her trauma of the 74th Hunger Games. She and Peeta (Josh Hutcherson), are presented to each district of Panem as the sole survivors. Katniss became a symbol to the people and causing them to start a rebellion. The president (Donald Sutherland) is conducting the 75th Hunger Games, named Quatrell Quell, and it's all up to Katniss on how to survive from it.What's interesting is in the script. It is so unpredictable that it keeps your heart racing waiting for what happens next. It never goes downhill. Everything is slick and unpretentious, never boring. You'll see it. I recommend you to see the first one because a lot of reference will be needed to watch this spectacle.",10,1,24,23 November 2013
