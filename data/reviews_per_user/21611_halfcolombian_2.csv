Requiem for a Dream," Pretentious and overrated
","I really can't see what's so great about this movie. It was a big disappointment to me. I really tried to like it but I just couldn't. I think after seeing the reviews on here my expectations of the movie was way too high. The first 20-30 minutes of this movie was incredibly boring, I thought that maybe it was just to make us get to know the characters so I gave it some more time. Then after an hour had passed I realized that this wasn't going to get any better. (somehow the same feeling the characters have about their own lives in the movie) It seems like the moviemakers didn't want to make a movie, they wanted to make a masterpiece. It's like the movie is saying 'hey look at me, have u seen anything better?!? Look at these cool camera-angles and these amazing close-ups. And I don't only look good I'm deep too.' Anyway I don't buy it. Just because you show close-ups of an eye and pills thrown into mouths it's not automatically a great movie. I'm not impressed. Anyway I've noticed that with IMDB the newer the movie is the higher ratings it gets. If you want to see a movie about drugadiction watch 'panic in needle park' or the german movie 'christiane f' both those movies are far better than this one (and rated lower). I don't hate this movie but I can't for my life understand how so many people can love it. I'm giving this a 1. That might be unfair but it's just as unfair as the 8.5 that it has on here. If I see it again I sure hope I discover something new since it feels like I'm the only one in the world who's not impressed with this. Over 40% voted a 10 for this.",1,126,227,9 September 2002
Minority Report," routine sci-fi
","(*** WARNING  SPOILERS COMING BELOW*****) Don't read this unless you've seen the movie. I didn't enjoy this movie as much as I thought I would. It had its moments and was entertaining in the end. But it showed very few new ideas. Almost everything you had already seen in other movies. It reminded me a lot about '12 monkeys' with Bruce Willis (among other movies). That movie I liked, this one I only half-liked. I predicted parts of the ending and was never really surprised. One of many things I couldn't understand was how Mr Sydows character could get away with his murder. He must have planned his murder BEFORE he hired that other guy to do the murder so Sydows murder must have been the first vision and his name must have come up on the 'ball', so if they would have erased a vision for 'deja vu' they would have erased the vision of the guy sydow set up and not the vision of the real murder. And what about the time? Supposedly they could see the exact time of the murder, the two murders occured at different times so they could easily separate them. I can take 'fantastic', totally unreal plots as long as they have logic. But if they put logic aside as well it's not very entertaining ** out of ****",Null,0,1,18 August 2002
