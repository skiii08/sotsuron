The Equalizer," Good acting but turns into Steven Seagal movie
","The characters develop, the story unfolds..then after 40 minutes it turns into a Steven Seagal movie..played with Denzel Washington !! This is not as good as heat/ training day . I think I prefer Kevin's Costners' 3 days to Kill about 10 times over this. I hope he is the good uncle in the next movie!The movie is not original at all, the ending is pathetic, careless,.. the characters become inconsistent and careless! I should have left after 60 minutes..Did the script writers/ directors get impatient half way through ? did somebody tell them we need more Steven Seagal?Disappointed, I still give it a 5 ***** . 3 * for the first 40 minutes. and because the villain was also a good actor and 1* for Denzel ..It could have been 8 * easy had the middle to end of story been more believable, the characters more consistent/ careful.",5,39,81,28 September 2014
Resident Evil: Extinction," The story and the characters are a disgrace.
","Resident Evil 1 to 3 are by no means art or the best sci-fi ever written, but at least they were entertaining, watchable and the plot was somewhat interesting. In this movie none of the characters actions or the story line makes any sense ..this can be seen within 3 minutes of the movie..when a lead character puts her live at risk completely unnecessary..as is revealed only a minute later.. future actions just get more stupid and the story only gets worse from there..Even the bad guys are awful to watch..Take all irritating 1 dimensional evil characters/ monsters of all the worst movies you have ever seen..and you will find them all again in here..The heros are no better.The only reason I give it 2 stars is as a result of the cinemtogrophy . However the characters and the details of the story are so bad that even in 4D this movie would only get 3 stars.. since it is 'only in 3D' I will give it 2 ..I need to quote somebody else: 'The movie is a disgrace even for resident evil.' I feel embarrassed for the people that made this movie....heck even for people that acted in this movie... they surely need to be desperate for money...",2,1,4,26 September 2010
Life of Pi," Visually appealing but story dwells too long on irrelevant detail
","The book might be very good but as a movie it is just a story that could have been told in a short movie( 20 minutes) with the same effect and the same beauty and same message and same option for debate and thought about it. I do not like movies that are there to carry a message, e.g. Contact and the message become more important then the characters and the story moving forward.The movie is visually very appealing, if it were not for CGI effects would get a much lower rating, I am sure. I expected more and can give it only a 6/10. Perhaps if you do not mind movies that are there to carry a message, more so than tell a story and love CGI you will enjoy this movie and find it very beautiful.",6,0,6,3 March 2013
Dunkirk," The movie is 3d the story telling is one dimensional .
","This movie is about the British and French soldiers trapped on a beach by the German soldiers. It is a movie with very good visuals and camera work and CGI. It lacks dialogue and character development. Even less so than super hero movies. In Dunkirk you will be riveted to the seats by the action scenes, boats sinking, airplanes, air-gun fights for a good 30-40 minutes, but then you start to wonder if this is what the movie is all about. At the end you just realize you wasted 2h of your life. However, if this movie were not based on an historic event - which could be summarized into perhaps 3-4 sentences, it would not get a vote of 8.5 Somehow people are scared to vote down boring historic movies. Historic movies can have beautiful character development, this one did not. The movie is 3d, the story is one dimensional. Don't give it a high vote just because it is based on WWII..",4,5,9,6 August 2017
District 9," Men in black meets alien nation.
","The first hour of the movie was meant to be funny. I was a funny mockumentary. The accents are very thick..of everyone. (Not all south Africans have such a thick accent, just some.) Vicus was not the brightest...etc.I think a lot of people are missing the satire/ irony of aliens living in District 9 in South Africa until 17 years ago. Non-white South Africans were forcefully moved from one districts. e.g. district 6 to another district until the 1980s.These apartheid laws etc. were mostly implemented and followed through by afrikaans people ( white people with the thick accent, Vicus van der Merwe is such a very typical Afrikaans name the other one is Kobus.) The awkward scenes are really funny and meant to be funny. Also the scenes where he gives candies to aliens / pops their eggs is very funny dark humor.Comedy needs to be added to genre! so make it: Action <> Drama <> Sci-Fi <> Thriller AND comedyIf you don;t get this you might miss a * or ** from the movie and the first half might seem a bit boring. I find it is much more funny then Men in black actually. I could have watched 3h of the first part.Please don;t expect another THE MATRIX / TERMINATOR / YOUR SCIFI MOVIE HERE experience. It will NOT WOW you in that way. I think it was also not that rounded off with the best sound tracks, best cast etc. But since it was so different to anything I have seen before, had no famous stars to support it, I still give it 9 stars.",9,1,3,10 September 2009
Bridesmaids," as a guy ..only watch this if you are forced to
","Althouth this movie has some real jokes..most of the movie consists of boring chick stuff and old clich√© jokes...so as a guy don't think you will enjoy this. you can pretend to but only watch it if you have to.. :)The chick moments are too long and too annoying.. I personally prefer most romantic comedies to this movie, girl fights are just terrible to watch on screen. Besides the movie is offensive and discriminates against Germans. USA and Saudi Arabia are the police state these days not Germany. .writers of this movie..travel a bit please..create some original humor.",2,17,35,28 June 2011
The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey," Un unexpected boredom
","..yes the characters and the settings are good and Lord of the rings was riveting, but this . I am sorry Muppet Show in a big cave ... The action scenes are like Tom and Jerry.. come on they are not funny, Tom and Jerry is at least funny ..and they are not full of suspense either because the story is just lacking. and the characters are not attractive because they are all hobbits and dwarfs, so why do I need to watch 45 minutes of that. I am not in admiring CGI for the sake of it. And the opening scene is just way too long..25 minutes for a breakfast??As for the story. all this gold we are shown that the dwarfs had.. what's the point if a quarter of the worlds population swims in Gold..and all it does it attract Dragons? Surely it is as valuable as iron then. So trying to look past that I was looking forward to a suspenseful film but I could predict almost everything.. and Golem was not as good as last time. The story is just too simple and too drawn out. Leave it for your kids under the age of 12.",4,11,18,14 July 2013
Avengers: Infinity War," Not as good and not as bad as many write
","This movie is actually better than I expected but not in the top 100 movies of all time nor in the top 10 of this year.
Don't expect much or any character development in this movie. 
95% of all the characters were already introduced in previous Marvel movies.
You would have had to have seen at least ten others marvel movies to get any joy out of this movie . So this one goes straight to the action .The super heroes are in groups and they fight separate fights and the movie seems scattered . The obvious plot does not make up for it, the characters do not develop further , it often feels more like a good computer game then a movie. 
So cannot give it more than a 7 * . It is not as bad as you might expect from such a movie and the plot does get a bit more interesting, however simplistic it is... 
Super heros are no longer invincible , unfortunately many of them are still far from human . We cannot really identify with them or estimate if any of their actions actually make any sense - we are a spectators, like spectators of a video game we have never seen before..
 For example how much punishment can a super hero or super villain take before he dies, we have no idea and there is no gauge. Sometimes they just get up again other times not.. The movie does have some interesting sub plots and parts to it , yes even the villains have a human side. Nevertheless the main villains motive for wanting to destroy half the universe is unsatisfactory, at best . The good part is that it is not too predictable, the movie has good CGI and well actually good actors in most of the roles.",7,1,1,29 May 2018
Vanilla Sky," Excellent movie. great sound track
","o.k. it is a remake, but a good one. If it was an original I would have given it a 10. I think it is slightly better than the original. This is open for debate. I prefer the music of Vanilla Sky and that made it greater pleasure to watch. So if I had to watch Vanilla Sky 3 times in a year or OPen your eyes I would much rather watch Vanilla Sky. ( maybe the subtitles of OPen your eyes also put it at an unfair disadvantage.This is a movie about so many things and they are all so true to human nature and yes also not. I don't want to spoil it.I maybe a IQ snob but I use this movie to judge peoples intelligence. If they don't like it I have always found they did not get it... regardless of their sophistication. (bugger of spell checker) Cheers",9,2,3,1 August 2005
Godzilla," Mostly boring -unless you are into monsters.....does not add up ,
","Besides being mostly boring, story seems to repeat itself over and over ,not enough build up, humans and characters are mostly left as spectators ..so why watch it? A movie should always be a story of a human .. unless you are into monsters.. ( your 12 year old kid might be but adults should not..) So about 3/4 in I had yawning about 4 times already.. Then comes the --not so exiting ending-- and now huge plot holes surfaced . Unfortunately these are at critical to the whole outcome of the movie, not going to write spoilers.So 8 (for a perfect entertaining movie but nothing too novel) +1 for CGI +1 for slightly original story on the theme. -3 the story needs to involve humans more or intelligent beings or we need to know what the hell they are thinking..! -1 no real characters to follow that are entertaining. -2 for major plot holesSo cannot give it more than 4.",4,1,5,25 May 2014
Fast Five," unoriginal. full of plot holes and just totally over the top
","over the top: if jumping buses in 'speed' bother us compare to speed, the action in this movie is a jump over the empire state building.. with a bus.Secondly it is full of plot holes in peoples action and what they say ..right at the ending..go through what people did just 10 minutes ago in the movie.. makes no sense.!..u got to start asking yourself was i dreaming or in a different movie ten minutes ago? The movie starts well, but ..the tension between Brian oConner and Dominuq Toretto is just not there anymore and this makes the whole movie bland.. soon u find yourself in a completely unoriginal plot..aka almost identical to the plot from 'the Losers' , 'The expendabels' and so many others..just with the plot holes as above and a worse story and more boring....when the action starts it gets ridiculous quickly...I like fast and furious I and IV..this one was the worst of the serious.",2,27,58,18 May 2011
