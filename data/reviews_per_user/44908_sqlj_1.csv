Catch Me If You Can," Excellent Film!
",This is no doubt one of the best movies of 2002. It is funny and entertaining yet heart-wrenching. Top grade performances from DiCaprio and Hanks made it CMIYC a wonderfully exciting journey through the life of Frank Abagnale. Hats off to the screenplay writers who adapted the book to film! I also loved the music and cartoon graphics at the opening of the movie. Excellent .. would definitely see it again! 9/10,9,1,2,22 February 2003
