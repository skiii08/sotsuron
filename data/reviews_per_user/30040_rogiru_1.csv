Borat: Cultural Learnings of America for Make Benefit Glorious Nation of Kazakhstan," Don't waste the time
","This is a very bad movie full of 'toilet' humor. It is waste of time and doesn't deserve 1/100 of hype it got. The director specifically appeals to the 'toilet' side of a man and the jokes are terrible. I'm really surprised that so many people like it, because it scores 0 as comedy, 0 as performance and 0 for humor. This is antisemitic movie made by a Jew. People that are trying to explain what this movie is about fool themselves. There are no deep ideas behind this movie - only 'toilet' humor. I was feeling that I'm going to throw up while watching this film. Don't waste your time and money. If you are not into 'toilet' humor skip this disgusting film.",1,6,13,3 December 2006
