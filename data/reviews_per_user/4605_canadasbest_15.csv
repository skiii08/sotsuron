United 93," Moving, terrifying, surreal
","We all know the story here.United 93 offers great tension and drama all centered around a very real event. The fact this is based on a real life attack which most remember vividly makes it far more powerful than any fiction could be.One of the constant themes of the film is confusion. So many times throughout the characters on screen are asking 'what the hell is going on?' or some variant there of. Different agencies getting different information from different sources, with so much uncertainty it's not surprising the response was so slow.The film's pacing is slow, but methodical, peaking every few minutes with another major event (one plane hits tower, second plane hits tower, plane hits Pentagon, air traffic grounded).Sadly, you can't help cheering a little bit for the passengers of United 93. You know they won't succeed but it's hard not to find yourself hoping they will.The filmmakers made a very wise choice I think by using almost no background music throughout the film, this made it seem much more realistic to the viewer.There are also a couple of interesting 9/11 facts revealed at the films conclusion. Perhaps most disturbing of all, the authorities didn't know United 93 had been hijacked until four minutes after it crashed.See it if you can handle it, it will tug at your heartstrings the whole way through.",8,0,2,10 September 2006
Spider-Man 2," Entertaining and enjoyable...but not perfect
","Spider-Man 2 is a very respectable follow-up to the 2002 original. The sequel stays true to its roots and even does some good foreshadowing of the third chapter. I wouldn't say it's better than the original, I'd rate the two about equally.On the positive side, the movie looks very sleek, the CGI has been updated and polished compared to the first film and the Doc Ock effects are excellent. The movie flows well and although you don't have to have seen the original to 'get' this film, it does help tremendously.On the negative side, it seems like Raimi has rehashed a lot of ideas from the original film. Without spoiling anything, let me just comment that there are a couple of familiar 'damsel in distress' scenes and a familiar feel to the ending (at least, the first part of the ending. I loved the Dafoe cameo in the latter part). While I understand that superhero movies are somewhat formulaic by nature, I was disappointed that there were so many plot similarities here.One other comment, I also felt the Alfred Molina was a great Doc Ock, but he should have been given more screen time, I wasn't able to connect with the character as much as I thought I would.All in all a good film, this will most certainly be one of the best of the summer and far better than the upcoming 'Catwoman'. If you enjoyed the original, you'll enjoy this. If you didn't like original, you may not want to bother with this one.It'll be interesting to see what happens in part 3.",9,0,1,30 June 2004
The Day After Tomorrow," It's SUPPOSED to be mindless entertainment!
","Ok come on people, if you've watched Emmerich films before you know that the man is big on visual effects and small on science and TDAT is no exception. Don't go expecting Oscar level acting or deep character development.Having said that, if you turn your brain off, sit back and enjoy it, you are in for a hell of a ride. I admit I'm a sucker for large scale destruction and well, it doesn't get much larger than this!There aren't many movies that can sell on visuals alone but this movie is eye candy at its finest. Seeing New York frozen over and Los Angeles destroyed by tornadoes is actually very enjoyable. The Dennis Quaid character is pretty stereotypical of these movies, although he doesn't do a terrible job with it.But really, you don't go to movies like this for the characters, you go for the big bangs and this film has plenty of them. Like I said, it's supposed to be mindless fun, but in this case there is a message behind it all. Global warming is a real threat and, although extreme, this movie puts the spotlight on the human impact on the environment.If you aren't keen on shelling out to see this movie at the theatres (the visuals play really well on the big screen) at least consider renting it on DVD because it's one of the better B-movies out there.",Null,0,0,29 May 2004
Spider-Man 3," Could've been great, but doesn't quite make it.
","Spider-Man 3 seems to follow the same basic blueprint of Spider-Man 2. Peter and MJ start to have relationship troubles, he begins to consider what Spider-Man means to him and how it's changed his life, all while a new villain is created and hatches a plot to get spidey.But where it was done so wonderfully in Spider-Man 2, it suffers in this film. This is due mainly to two things. Firstly, we've already seen it before so it doesn't feel fresh as it did in #2. Secondly, Spider-Man 2 had only one villain so the story focused completely on Doc Ock and as a result he became a very multidimensional and compelling character. In this installment, the villain duties are shared between Venom and Sandman, and neither character is developed anywhere near the level Doc Ock was. Venom in particular is presented almost as an afterthought, though Topher Grace does do a good job as Eddie Brock.There's a sequence in the film where Peter, possessed by the symbiote (the thing that gives him his black suit) starts doing some crazy things behaviour-wise. Although it's meant to be serious, they seem to go way over the top with it and it comes off seeming like little more than comedy relief. This particular sequence doesn't really seem to fit in the film very well.The Harry Osborn story gets mixed up here too as he takes not one, not two, but THREE character turns in the course of the movie and the subplot involving him seems underdeveloped and rushed.On the plus side, the special and visual effects are spectacular, save for one particularly cheesy scene where Spidey just happens to jump right in front of an American flag. The main actors do a passable job, Kirsten Dunst likely gives the strongest performance as MJ, also Rosemary Harris delivers another sweet yet strong performance as Aunt Mae.The other bright spots acting wise were J.K. Simmons as J. Jonah Jameson and the incomparable Bruce Campbell as an extremely funny french maitre'd in one particularly memorable scene.In conclusion, the film is a bit of a letdown, but the disappointment is compounded by the fact that all the pieces were here for a great story, but it just didn't pull together like it could've. Definitely worth the price of admission though, even an average Spiderman movie is a pretty darned good superhero flick.",7,1,2,4 May 2007
Hotel Rwanda," Moving, Powerful, Magnificent...a film that is beyond words.
","Having just seen this movie a few hours ago I still can't fully put into words how much this movie touches the heart. Don Cheadle turns in a masterful performance as Paul Rusesabagina. Sophia Okonedo gives a solid performance as his wife Tatiana.I was only 12 when these incidents were happening and I do not remember them well, but I do remember all the coverage here in Canada because of Lt. Gen. Romeo Dallaire's constant pleas for international help in Rwanda. Dallaire I'm pretty sure is the basis for the Nick Nolte character in the film (the character wore a Canadian Flag patch on his uniform).Cheadle's performance combined with the terrific direction of Terry George works wonders in helping the audience sympathize and feel for Paul who really was a reluctant hero type, but in the end did what he had to do.This movie is about a genocide and there are some disturbing images, including one scene that takes place on a roadway. I won't reveal what happens, but it will be hard not to look away when you see it. This film is PG-13 and the violence is limited, but powerful enough that it still tugs on the heartstrings of the viewer. There are many real-life videos of the genocide much more gruesome than the movie depicted.Hotel Rwanda worked great on two levels, first it displayed just how cold and destructive hatred can be and secondly it powerfully demonstrated that the rest of the World refused to help when it should have. How could all that killing be ignored? It just baffles me to know so many people could have done something and so few did.It's rare I review a film that I can find no flaws in, but Hotel Rwanda is an exception, the film is very well done. Some have said Cheadle's accent comes of as a little corny, but it didn't bother me at all.Hotel Rwanda has few explosions, no lengthy martial arts fights, no car chases and no scantily clad women. If you want to see that, you know where to go. However, if you want to see an excellent movie about how destructive human nature can be, see this film.I guarantee you won't be disappointed.",9,0,0,25 January 2005
Star Wars: Episode VI - Return of the Jedi," A great DVD experience...but where's the movie I loved as a kid??
","I watched the just released DVD version of Return of the Jedi last night and I must say I enjoyed it. This is Star Wars after all, three of the most entertaining movies ever made.Since about everyone over the age of 12 knows the plot of the saga, I'm not going to restate it here, what I will talk about is why I was disappointed with the DVD.Let me say that I don't mind the special edition of 'Jedi', the changes aren't extensive, save for the ending sequence and most of the alterations exist simply of some added visual effects or sharper appearances on FX elements like ships and lightsabers.Sadly though, I do miss the ORIGINAL Return of the Jedi, the version I watched probably too many times as a kid. The DVD version is great, but it's just not the same. It's too bad the original theatre versions weren't included in the release. I know many a message board are dedicated to this debate right now so I won't go in to a long tirade.I think the one thing that I dislike most about this version of 'Jedi' and the special edition was the drastic change to the celebration song at the end. I much preferred the original song to the more syrupy tune in the new releases. Well, at least I still have my VHS copy of this film...which likely WON'T find its way to my trash bin simply because this has now been released.Take it for what it is...but it is ISN'T the original.",Null,1,2,26 September 2004
"I, Robot"," Enjoy it for what it is, don't worry about what it isn't
","Let me start of by addressing the Asimov fans who have cried foul because this movie 'desecrates' the legendary original stories: This was not meant to be a direct adaptation of Asimov's ideas, it is rather a blend of some of Asimov's ideas with an original story, though the title could have been changed to reflect the lesser connection.On to the film...I'm an SF enthusiast, many of the films in my collection fall into that realm and so I probably judge films like this more harshly than others.Having said that, I enjoyed it.This was a fun way to spend a couple of hours. The film seemed to have a good balance of story and entertainment, but I liked how it left some questions unanswered.Others have said that Will Smith has become pretty much the same character in ID4/MIB/Enemy of the State etc., but I disagree. I think Smith has added just enough uniqueness to each character to make them interesting and appropriate to the film.I believe the future shown in this film will be accurate to the point that AI will become a very integral part of everyday life. I was surprised however, that virtually no one shared Smith's suspicions about the Robots. I myself don't really like the idea of turning over too many key tasks in our societies to machines and could easily relate to what Spooner was going through, but certainly I'm not alone in how I feel??The CGI and visuals were slick and very well done, but be forewarned. It seemed to me that the trailers for this movie made it sound like the 'Robot invasion' would be a more integral part of the story, it's really not so don't go if you are expecting a long drawn out 'Cyber war'. There are some cool fight scenes though.This movie gives you a fun ride and a few things to think about at the same time. A solid popcorn flick. 8/10",Null,0,0,21 July 2004
Ghostbusters," After more than 20 years, this movie is still fun to watch
","One of my favourite movies as a kid was this one, as it both made me laugh and scared me at the same time. I recently picked up a special DVD set of both Ghostbusters films and I still love watching them.As a child of the 80s, I had all the Ghostbuster toys, the GB action figures, Ecto mobile, Firehouse. I only wish I'd kept them. My brother and I even dressed up as Ghostbusters one Halloween.The film itself is very entertaining and really makes me miss good, intelligent comedies. There is not one single fart or sex joke in this entire movie and yet it's still really funny in some parts. I often wonder if good comedy movies like this still exist, one can only watch so many fart jokes until they get lame and boring.Although some of the effects to seem dated, they hold up pretty well considering over two decades have passed since the production of this movie. The Stay Puft man is still one of the coolest bad guys ever.If there's something strange in the neighbourhood...who you still gonna call?",8,0,0,24 April 2006
Hero," Take note Hollywood, THIS is what a great movie looks like...
","This film was an incredible breath of fresh air from most of the so-called 'summer blockbusters'. Unlike the usual brainless popcorn flick, 'Hero' actually makes you think about the story and draw some of your own conclusions from it.If you don't like eastern style films, this is not recommended, but if you're free minded about movies (as I am), you may enjoy this.
First off, the movie is visually spectacular and not because of any large explosions or tidal waves wiping out cities. In every scene is it is apparent that what we are watching has been meticulously laid out beforehand for maximum beauty and effect. Let me put it this way, you could take almost ANY frame from this movie, and confidently put it on your wall, it really looks THAT GOOD.Early in the film, I thought the story was pretty simple considering the scope this movie seemed to have. What appear to be several simple flashback sequences actually go on to tell the same story from three different angles and it's very interesting to see how each version develops.The fight scenes are not realistic, but if you're a fan of these movies, you know that's to be expected. Having said that, the fights are not stupid to the point where they turn you off the film. Usually when you watch a fight you pick a winner and root for him to kick ass. In 'Hero' you'll be caught up in the moment, focusing only on the swiftness and beauty of the sword work. 'Hero' is not a film for everyone, but if you are put off by the blockbusters hollywood throws at us these days and don't mind a subtitled film, check this one out. I challenge you to watch it and not be touched in some way.",Null,0,0,1 September 2004
The Da Vinci Code," Entertaining but disappointing at the same time...
","It's hard to say for certain if this movie lived up to the hype. It provides a good two plus hours of entertainment, but doesn't leave much of a lasting impression and you probably won't want to see it again.In my places the movie plays it too safe, it's almost as if Ron Howard is terrified of doing anything that might offend the Catholic Church. As a result, the film does not push the envelope as much as the book does.Tom Hanks does a decent job as Robert Langdon although he seems to be without emotion for much of the performance. There also seems to be a lack of chemistry between his character and that of Audrey Tatou.The best performances in the film come not from Hanks but from the supporting cast. Ian Mckellen, Jean Reno, Paul Bettany and to a lesser extent Alfred Molina account for most of the films more dramatic moments.Yes there are many changes from the book, but the central plot twist revealed at the end is the same in both. In the movie though, savvy viewers will probably figure it out about an hour before it is revealed as it seems to be pretty well telegraphed through most of the films second half.The film also seems to suffer from lack of comedy relief. There are perhaps two chuckles in the whole film. Granted, this is a serious subject, but even a serious film needs a bit of humor.Is it worth the price of admission? Probably. Is it one of the best films ever made? Definitely not.",6,0,2,20 May 2006
The Matrix Reloaded," You aren't supposed to understand yet...
","That line may have shades of the Oracle in there, but it describes the movie perfectly. 'Reloaded' is a movie that will not be understood quickly. I saw it last night and I am still pondering it today. I believe though that the movie will make far more sense after Revolutions is released. The one thing that bugged me about this movie was the way it just stops at the end. At least the first movie had a definitive ending, this ones uses a spin on the 'to be continued' ending of a TV cliffhanger.Having said that, the movie rocks. Plenty of action and big explosions for those looking for it and there are some very interesting dialogue scenes as well (Neo and the Architect). This movie equals the first, but does not outdo it, which is what I think the directors were after. The new additions to the cast add a little extra as well (Zee is extremely underrated in my opinion).Some reviews written by others have criticized this film for leaving open too many 'loose ends' and not providing solid answers to all the questions. That's the point of it all. Some of the questions are there so the audience can answer them and perhaps there are multiple answers for these questions (why was a certain decision made near the end of the movie? for example).
The thing I appreciated most about this film is that it keeps you thinking long after you leave the theatre.",Null,0,0,17 May 2003
Mystic River," Pretty Solid...but with a critical flaw.
","In terms of skillful camera work and top production values, it doesn't get much better than this. Clint Eastwood has done a masterful job as director in creating moments of intense drama, tension and emotion throughout this film.The Sean Penn-Tim Robbins-Kevin Bacon trio gives terrific performances (with Penn and Robbins especially solid). Laurence Fishburne of 'Matrix' fame makes a nice turn here as Bacon's detective partner.The story centers around the loss of Penn's daughter Katie. Katie is seen only briefly in the film, which is a bit of shame because I would have liked to have established a little more connection to the character before she died. But the 'whodunit?' element is only part of the story here, the main story is the now twisted relationship between three former childhood friends and their paranoid and distrust of one another.For all it's strengths, there is one plot hole that to me really hurts this film. *minor spoiler* The police seize Dave Boyle's(Robbins) car and discover blood in the back seat that is not his, furthering their theory that Dave killed Katie. Now the police could have easily run a DNA test comparing the blood in the car to Katie's blood (as they had access to her body) to determine if she really WAS in Dave's car that night, but there is not even a mention of such a test. *end spoiler*Despite this, this move is so well done that it still managed to impress me. Usually I get put off by a movie which has skipped/ignored very important facts, but not this time. It may be because I was more interested in the developing backstory of Penn's character Jimmy than in the truth about Katie. Mystic River is a terrific, emotional and a times disturbing trip into the human psyche. Enjoy it, because they don't make many like this.",Null,0,0,25 July 2004
X2: X-Men United," A movie for X-men fans more than action fans
","I've read some of the other user comments with people complaining there wasn't enough action in this movie. Setting aside the fact that there were some action packed scenes, this movie foremost about storytelling. Any true comic book fan knows the stories of the X-men and in order for this movie to advance the overall story, those stories must be told. I liked the fact that this movie provided more insight to certain characters than the first. Although I do agree some characters were underused (Cyclops, Rogue). The only other thing I would've liked to see is a few more opportunities for Wolverine to get in wisecracks (Hugh Jackman plays the role so well). If you are looking for non-stop action, you won't find it here. But if you want a solid, compelling story intermixed with some action, then look no further. X3 should be interesting.",8,0,0,3 May 2003
The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King," All good things must come to an end...
","...but what a way to go out!Having watched all three LOTR films in the last 24 hours, I can honestly say that this trilogy marks a milestone in filmmaking. As other reviewers have mentioned, this installment seems to go by quickly, despite being over three hours long.I am thankful the scriptwriters left the comedy out of this. It would have been easy to toss in a funny line here or there but thankfully there are virtually none, although I always get a kick out of Gimli and Legolas keeping track of their battlefield kills. The battle sequences in this movie were masterfully done (the army of the dead is something to behold) and although some may argue the movie has five separate endings, each serves a purpose and by the time we are all done, every plot thread has been tied up.Yes, the films don't exactly match the books, but the same is true of every book based movie. Considering the monumental task that lay before him when he took on this project, I think Peter Jackson should be commended for taking a much beloved literary work and transforming it into a spectacular film trilogy.",10,0,0,20 December 2003
V for Vendetta," Conform or Rebel...
","No matter how much control a government may wish to exert on its citizens, there will always be resistors, those who simply will not allow their own minds to be taken from the. This was the base theme in 1984 and it's the base theme here.V for Vendetta is not a straight up action movie, but if you are into politics and history to an extent, you'll find a lot to think about in here. The film really addresses a number of issues all to prevalent in the post 9/11 world: spying, government monitoring, controlled release of information/misinformation (spin).The character of V is given a good deal of personality despite the fact he never takes the mask off, which will no doubt disappoint some. Natalie Portman, despite the forced accent is probably one of a select group of women who look about as good with a shaved head as they do with full hair. She wasn't overwhelming here, but she was certainly adequate.V for Vendetta is a great film for anyone who is looking for a good story wrapped around some very cool action film fight sequences. Yes, the Alan Moore purists have come out in force pointing out all the problems with this movie, but the same thing happens with any other adaptation (remember Asimov fans tearing up 'I, Robot'? The best advice is to treat the movie and book as two separate entities and judge each on its own merit.",Null,1,5,20 March 2006
