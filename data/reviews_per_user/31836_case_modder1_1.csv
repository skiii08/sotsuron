United 93," Typical!
","Over it was a good movie, but i just think it was awful that some one decided to make an entertainment piece out the whole ordeal, movies like this make me sick (pearl harbor). the acting was decent and well thought out. no necessary special effects were needed so thats a place i cant comment on. I found it honorable that they donated a percentage to the flight 93 fund, which was only for the opening weekend though. other than the fact that the making of the movie was too soon i cant say much of anything else. Who knew those heartless, shameless, money grubbing bastards in Hollywood could make such a sensitive and fabulous moving film? United 93 is a very straightforward, stripped down retailing of the events on that fateful day. How much of it is true or fabricated, I don't know, but I don't think that's as important as the love and care that went into creating this. It's almost never too soon to see such an excellent and stunning piece of film-making as this. This is clearly the first great movie of 2006.",7,4,8,23 October 2006
