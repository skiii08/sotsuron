Deja Vu," Great Roller Coaster
","One might say that the movie is a bit far fetched but my gosh....nothing can prepare you for how fantastic this movie is. It is so realistic that you actually second guess what you believe in. Excellent casting, thrills galore. The action is non stop and nothing is what it seems.Denzil Washington is in fine style as usual and his co stars are equally talented. This is a movie as a chick flick, action night ...whatever. Great plot, a bit of sci fi, a bit of action, there is comedy, the drama...how much more can you ask for. Brilliant movie! I would get the DVD when it comes out!",8,2,4,15 January 2007
Hostel," After seeing, seek therapy!!!
","This movie was amazing!!! It has a plot, it has the right actors, it has everything that is needed for you to be at the edge of your seat, blocking your eyes, hoping that you need to use the loo just when the gore starts..just so you don't look like a punk in front of your mates! I had to leave one or two times during this movie. It was some heavy stuff. Very well done though. Beautiful. The movie stays with you days after you have seen it. This has ushered in a new era of horror....I am sure that eventually one or two producers are going to want to attempt to emulate this film. It is truly a hard act to follow. Some would say that it had too much gore, but hey..that is the movie. It all has a point and it illustrates the character involved perfectly. Well put together",7,2,3,15 January 2007
