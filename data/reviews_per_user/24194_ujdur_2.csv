Kill Bill: Vol. 2," Tarantino's worst = still a decent movie
","I am reviewing both the volume one and volume two with this review as Kill Bill was meant to be a one 4 hour long movie. So when I give it a 6 out of 10, I am judging both the volumes as a whole. First I will say that I am one of Tarantino's biggest fans, I watched all his movies, I look for Tarantino's interviews online, etc. I think Jackie Brown is a masterpiece, as is Pulp Fiction, as is Reservoir dogs. But Jackie Brown was met with mixed reviews, some fans thought the movie was too mild for Tarantino, some were disappointed. This most likely hurt Tarantino on a personal level, ergo after a long pause from movie making he delivers the Kill Bill(s), the most childish of all his works. That is right, no question that Tarantino enjoyed himself making the movies, and no question that he made what he wanted to make. But, I have a feeling he decided to bend over to the masses with this one. Everything to please. And the masses loved it, I loved it (when I was 16). Kill Bill is still a decent movie, and if someone else made it I'd have given it 7, 8 or 9. But Tarantino can do better, he should do better. Luckily, he made Inglorious basterds which carried a true message in it, delivered with skill of an artist. Now he is making Django unchained, a controversial movie that may break his career. That is what the artist has to do if he wants to call himself an artist. To conclude with what I think Kill Bill is about. It is Tarantino's fantasy of what it would be like if the Blondie was a female in a relationship with Lee van Cleef working together in a band of assassins. Pretty infantile. There is a deeper theme of how revenge is a sin, and who has the right to decide who lives or dies, and who is really clean and good (no one) and who is evil. But I think he did this theme better in his other works. I think the movie that inspired Tarantino, Death rides a horse, is a better movie than Kill Bill. Tarantino is a genius, I love him.",6,0,3,19 August 2012
Once Upon a Time... in Hollywood," Not Tarantino's best
","This movie is not Pulp fiction, Reservoir dogs. It's not even Death proof. When I say this movie is not Tarantino's best, I mean it's Tarantino's worst movie he made. That still makes it an ok movie to go and see, an average movie. Five out of ten stars. I could say that Brad Pitt and Leonardo have no chemistry like Travolta and Sam Jackson. But they really did the best they could with an average script. Yes, I said average. An average script from the genius himself.
The pace of the movie is horrendous, the movie moves very slowly while absolutely nothing is happening except for the classic Tarantino's ultra violence in the last 5 min of the movie.
Now, don't think I am all about the violence. I like Tarantino for his dialogue and characters. Not in this film, like I said the script is average. The characters forgettable, it is Tarantino's fault.",5,3,7,16 August 2019
