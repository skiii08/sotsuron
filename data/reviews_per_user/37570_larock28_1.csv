The Twilight Saga: Breaking Dawn - Part 1," Disappointed........and I really wanted to like this movie.
","I loved the books and all the movies, except this one. I think the problem is the director. This guy was clueless when it came to vampires and wolfs. He did a good job with the honeymoon and with Bella's scenes after she returns from the honeymoon, but everything else was not good. The wolfs seemed average size and the wolfs communicating was a disaster, and where's the Cullen family and the interaction between Jacob and his pack? If this movie had been directed by the one who did New Mood, you would have seen a really good movie, but with this director, we are just seeing an OK movie. I'm almost afraid too see what he's done with part II......",Null,7,10,21 November 2011
