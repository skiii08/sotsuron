Casablanca," My all-time favorite movie!
","My first introduction to this movie was when it was purchased as a Christmas gift for me from my brother James, a career marine at the time whose favorite movies include Full Metal Jacket and Evil Dead....needless to say I was surprised when I open the package to see a copy of the old, black-and-white Casablanca, a film I had no interest in seeing.  'Its my favorite movie,' he told me, 'watch it or I'll pound you good.'  Well, I delayed for a while but I finally got around to watching it and MAN WAS I SURPRISED!  This was by far the best movie I had ever seen!  Action, humor, romance...this one REALLY has it all.  Since the first time I have seen it, it replaced Star Wars as my all time-favorite film!",10,1,1,26 November 1998
