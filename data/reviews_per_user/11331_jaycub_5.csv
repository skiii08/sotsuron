The Ring," Good, but don't buy the hype
","This was a very well done movie, though I disagree that it was the 'scariest movie ever made.'  in fact, I would say that it really wasn't scary, rather it was tense and disturbing; while there are horror genre movies out there that are extremely morbid, and huge fans of those movies would probably finds this film rather pale in comparison.  This movie is much closer to being a dramatic thriller rather than being a horror flick.  For what it is, it's very well composed; though you'll find a more frightening movie in classics like 'Silence of the Lambs,' or 'Jaws.'For being the scariest movie ever made, I think that's a tough title to earn.  This certainly didn't out do 'The Exorcist' or the original 'Haunting.'All in all, it was definately worth seeing, but don't expect to be scared out of your wits.",Null,0,1,18 March 2003
Citizen Kane," Well Deserving of it's superior status!
","I'm not going to spend a long time pouring over details of this movie.  I just have to say that this is easily one of the 3 best movies that has ever been made!  The film is a visual and acting masterpiece.  I was encouraged to watch this film in my multi-media art history class, and I've been a fan ever since.I must add that this movie has inspired more movies, television shows, and animated films than you can imagine.I rate-*****",Null,0,1,29 November 2002
Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Man's Chest," You can't top Pirates with Pirates, but this is a worthy attempt...
","Captain Jack Sparrow sets sail again, this time with the notorious Davey Jones looming over his head, leaving the usually imperturbable Captain Jack fleeing for his soul.The Curse of the Black Pearl was an anomaly that set the bar to a height that may well be unattainable. How often does one find a movie that has so much going against it, and it still remains a success. Originally, when executives discussed the plan of making a movie based on the beloved theme-park attraction, they conceived a made-for-video movie that would attempt to make a low-budget story out of a ride without a clear story.The first film worked because they didn't try to make sense of the ride (which as much as I love it, the story of the ride would make a very dull pirate movie) Rather they tried to create a swashbuckling pirate movie that would rejuvenate the franchise for generations to come, and with the amazing talent of Johnny Depp in their corner, create one of the most memorable characters to ever hit the silver screen.The first movie could stand alone as a complete story, without need for further delving into the legends of Captain Jack, but where would be the fun (and profit) of that? Dead Man's Chest suffers from the trilogy syndrome, much in the same way that Back to the Future and Lord of the Rings suffered: The second movie will inevitably remain the weakest of the three, and during it's initial release, will become the whipping-boy for the franchise. Because the public is mostly aware that the third movie is in the works, the story is created as a bridge between the first and second movie, and will always result in a cliff-hanger of sorts. Those who are unaware of the impending third movie will scorn the directors for leaving it so open at the end, and the more informed viewers will overlook the film to keep their eye focused on the conclusion of the story.Sadly, the studio themselves seemingly do the same thing. Production values on Dead Man's Chest were not as high as they were for the Curse of the Black Pearl, and it's likely that the studio is more focused on part 3, making part 2 more of a necessary evil rather than an important piece of the puzzle.That notwithstanding, the movie itself is fun. The action sequences are exciting, the jokes (although not as witty and original as they were in the first) are great, and Captain Jack is just as lovable a rogue as ever. The blending of CGI in this film compared to the first is not as smooth, and there are some design issues for several of the creatures that ILM created this time around.Walt Disney hated sequels, and when asked why he wouldn't do a sequel to the Three Little Pigs, he simply stated that 'you can't top pigs with pigs.' In this case, you can't do it with Pirates either.Overall, it's still a fun and exciting movie, and it leads into what promises to be an equally fun and exciting third installment. As long as you don't expect it to surpass the first film, you should enjoy this adventure with Captain Jack",8,1,2,10 July 2006
Pulp Fiction," This film was a waste of time!
","I love film, and the magic of being transferred into another place and/or another time.  I like being able to see life through the eyes of someone else.  Everyone has their own interpretation, and this film is Quentin Tarintino's view on life.  There are a large group of people out there who follow Tarintino's career and praise his genious and mastery at story-telling.  I am not one of them!To me, Pulp Fiction was a horrible film!  I thought the plots were boring, I thought that the movie was a waste of time, and I feel that way about everything that Tarintino has put out!  All he does is recycle the same garbage over and over, and the public praises him for it.  From my perspective, the only thing that I see in the film that I would consider an original idea about this film is the manner in which the story was presented (ie the sequence of events being presented as they were.)  However, if you really want to see a great and unique approach at story-telling, watch Memento!What it all boils down to is that I don't believe that Quentin Tarintino is any better a director than Britney Spears is an actress; but that's just my opinion!I Rate - * 1/2",Null,8,18,30 November 2002
The Bourne Supremacy," A decent follow-up to a great film!
","It seem that movie sequels being awful became such a joke that Hollywood is starting to fight back.  In that respect, the Bourne Supremacy is a worthy follow-up to it's Predecessor.  The story takes place 2 years after the conclusion of the Bourne Identity, and life for Jason has started to quiet down.  But a botched operation in the CIA brings up his name, and Jason finds himself once again hunting to keep his peace.Matt Damon once again gives an excellent performance as Jason Bourne.  The story feels more like a continuation of the previous story, rather than a 'let's throw more into it and blow the audience away' sequel that we've become accustomed to expect (Batman Forever/and Robin, Charlie's Angels: Full Throttle, Star Wars Episode II, etc.)The only major difference in continuity is that Brian Liman isn't directing this one, and it shows.  The camera work is very shaky, which tends to be more of a distraction during the fight sequences and car chases.  Often times it was unclear what was going on during these scenes, which made them far less entertaining to watch.  Jason comes off being more human and less superman in this film, which was a major plus.  This is easily one of the few spy/espionage thrillers that you see that doesn't insult your intelligence.The whole revenge plot is somewhat old hat, but it adds to the intricate plot of this film.  On the whole, Supremacy is a well done film, but it isn't as grand as Identity.7 out of 10",Null,0,1,24 July 2004
