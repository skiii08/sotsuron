Miracle," Inspirational and really good, but not great.
","MiracleThe story of the 1980 U.S. Olympic Hockey Team is one the greatest and most inspirational chapters of American sports history.  My feelings were a little mixed when I heard Disney was going to turn the story into one of their now trademark inspirational sports docudramas.  However, I came out of the film very impressed with the treatment and as clich√© as it sounds, I was proud to be an American. The main anchor of this film is Kurt Russell as stoic U.S coach, Herb Brooks.  Russell delivers, arguably one the strongest performances of his career.  The other main stronghold of the film is in its montages.  The significance of the U.S. win to the country as a whole is made very evident by the use of stock news footage.  One of the only problems with Miracle is that you cannot help but feel manipulated while watching it.  Music comes in at just the right times and you get the mean eye from a Russian as soon as you need it.  It is not one of the all time great sports movies . . . (Rocky, Hoosiers, Raging Bull) but it is really good and I would recommend checking it out this weekend.Overall Grade B+",6,0,2,2 February 2004
50 First Dates," Sweet story stuffed behind puke and Rob Schnieder
","50 First Dates50 First Dates marks the on screen reunion of Drew Barrymore and Adam Sandler who co-starred in The Wedding Singer.  In this one, Sandler plays a Hawaiian aquarium worker who has a propensity for showing single female tourists a good time during their visits.  Barrymore is a local who has no short term memory.  They fall in love, but with one catch, it has to happen for the first time every day.I am somewhat split on my opinion of this one.  The problem is that the story is sweet and almost compelling, but is veiled behind a combination of toilet humor, sex jokes and Rob Schneider.  The only thing that got a legitimate laugh out of me was the character of Sean Astin.  Both Barrymore and Sandler are in fine form and do a good job of making the love story authentic, but in my opinion cannot save this film from its far from effective juvenile comedy.    Over all grade: 5",5,1,2,15 February 2004
