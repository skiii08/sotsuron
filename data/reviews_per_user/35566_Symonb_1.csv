The Expendables 2," Awful, terrible, so bad it is laughable
","Lets be honest none of these actors pretend to be other than action heroes and that is fine all of them have plenty of good quality action movies to their credit this isn't one. It is so bad, so utterly corny I almost couldn't believe it. Expendables 1 was pretty bad this one excelled.... Script 0 out of 10, continuity 0 out of 10, acting 0 out of 10...action OK give it 2 out of 10 - over the top and unbelievable.Last line...'that thing belongs in a museum' says Bruce Willis referring to a helicopter 'we all do responds' Sly.Ne're a truer word my man, the most honest line in 103 minutes of complete and utter crap!!!!",1,0,3,27 June 2013
