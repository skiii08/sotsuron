The Legend of Bagger Vance," Why does everyone think this movie is about golf?
","I think this is a great movie for the person who is able to look past the game of golf, and see the game of life.  Redford and writers, et. al., are not saying that life is like a golf course, they are saying that life is a game, and more specifically, your life is your game, and it is what you make it.  Junuh's game just happened to be golf.  Baggar, who I believe represents God, has to gain Junuh's trust, as his caddie, so that he can deliver one simple message, 'I'm here, and I've always been here.'  That's it, that's what it's all about.",Null,0,1,10 March 2002
