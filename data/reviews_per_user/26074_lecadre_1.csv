Borat: Cultural Learnings of America for Make Benefit Glorious Nation of Kazakhstan," Social Jackass
","The resemblance of the movie Borat with the movie Jackass is striking. Jackass and Borat is the same kind of humor - to behave like a pubescent 'retard'. I had my laugh! This movie is rock bottom stupid. Hence, rating 0. Of course it requires some balls to make an idiot out of yourself - rating 10. However, I'm not sure if it is good that people that do not want get involved are involved (Borat) - subtract 2. Finally, this makes a (0+10)/2-2 = 3 rating. That's fine! But people it is not and never will be the best comedy of the year. I bet that over the next few weeks the rating of the movie will drop fast. This is not a good Comedy!The difference between Jackass and Borat is: who get's involved in the jokes. In Jackass the actors only harm themselves ( and eventually some mindless copyist! And this is very good very good that the copyists harming themselves). In Borat, Cohen is harming not only himself but also other people which as it seems to me do not want to get involved. I wish Cohen and the production company a lot, a lot of lawsuits! It is the reason why I would rate Borat lower than Jackass.",5,2,8,12 November 2006
