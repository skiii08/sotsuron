The Blair Witch Project," Disappointed
","Audience anticipation was high for this movie, and the ushers handed out barf-bags as (so they said) some 20 earlier viewers had thrown up from motion sickness.  For me and my brother though, this movie was pretty much a shoulder-shrugger.  I was simply not drawn into the action at all -- perhaps a teenage level of experience is required to identify with the characters -- and the camera movement had no effect on me, being an experienced 3D gamer. In any case, a yawner.rms rsquires@flash.net",5,1,2,1 August 1999
Constantine," Keanu Reeves in a successful Dark Comedy !
","Some of the scathing comments for Constantine are laughably imperceptive, much worse than the movie.People should take a step back and compare this to the likes of Van Helsing, and it will be apparent how much better it is. The plot is *much* richer, the special effects are equal, and the acting is certainly better.Keanu in particular does an excellent job. His down-beat portrayal of the depressed, chain-smoking, wise-cracking, cynical tool-of-god character is spot on. This is meant to be tongue-in-cheek, people! Almost every scene has a touch of dark humor that makes it clear the movie (and Keanu) are not taking themselves too seriously. It appears reviewers have completely ignored this, and want to see it as a standard horror film, which it is not.I was very pleasantly surprised at how watchable the film (DVD) was, chuckled many times at the dark Catholic humor, and enjoyed Keanu's performance. This is good stuff. Recommended.",7,0,4,20 July 2005
