Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," Excellent Beginning To The Star Wars Saga
",Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace (1999) George Lucas has done it again!!! He's allowed us to take a look at how the Star Wars Saga has started in a galaxy far far away.... The movie starts off with some brilliant visual effects and then it shifts into a story with adventure and danger around every corner. The characters in TPM gives an added element to the story by showing their struggle against an attacking force while many answers to the Star Wars galaxy are being laid out before us. TPM uses these characters to slow some elements of the story and block other elements completely. The mixture of characters and story allow the plot to be given to us at a reasonable pace and adds to our desire to see the next movie(Episode II). 5 out of 5 stars,10,0,1,24 May 1999
