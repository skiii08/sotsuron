The Blair Witch Project," Probably the most overhyped film of all time ( apart from Star Wars episode 1)
",Very disappointing film after all the hype. It wasn't very scary or orginal. I think as everybody in Britain knew that it wasn't real the effect was a bit lost.If people want to be scared they should watch the Texas chainsaw massacre instead. That is probably the most disturbing film I've ever seen.,5,0,2,20 July 2000
