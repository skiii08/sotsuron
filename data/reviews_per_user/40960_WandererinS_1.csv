Your Name.," Really disappointing
","I really watch the film with high expectation,but rather than the gorgeous animation I can't find anything else to talk about,the music was impressive but that's not something to put higher. The story and the characters were so mixed up and felt out of place,in the beginning, i enjoy a bit but as soon it progressed,everything was out of logic and I was like what I'm supposed to enjoy in this,I agree there was some force emotional moment but that doesn't make my outlook for the story any different,in short, it begin with comedic way turn into an illogical roller coastal and ended in the same manner. The characters weren't even developed. Doesn't matter how good is the animation,it can never have the upper hand over something vital like the main story.",Null,23,104,11 September 2016
