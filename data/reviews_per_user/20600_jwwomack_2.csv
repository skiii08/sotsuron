The Monuments Men," It's basically the Fast and the Furious but they steal art instead of cars
","First off, let's get something straight, the art in this film, isn't the real paintings/sculptures/etc. George Clooney is basically lying his @ss off the entire film. Not only are they taking replicas from the Nazis people are actually risking their lives to save the fakes. I mentioned this earlier on the Clooney forums I frequent and I was called a 'Nitwit' and 'basement dwelling butt troll' and they tried to enable this movie fakering by saying 'it's just a movie' and 'of course they aren't real, do you think they're gonna let a bunch of actors use the real art in a movie with explosions and Matt Damon around?' I mean come on guys, John Goodman is in this movie and he doesn't even eat corn. I'm pretty sure that's a staple for him, because he's always eating corn. I also didn't like how at the 1 hour 34 minute mark you clearly see Captain America in the background. I get that movie making is expensive and sometimes they have to reuse sets, but come on, they can at least film separate movies at different times. I also waited after the credits and saw a preview for the sequel where they steal art from a casino, you know like Ocean's 11.",6,0,0,7 April 2014
Braveheart," Bravo, Heart
","Yo lemme be honest here, I didn't even watch this movie, but I'm already started on this review and I've seen close to a dozen movies in my lifetime so I feel I'm qualified to review this film for this Website of Film Academia (IMDB). Alright, let's do this. So first things first, how even the h*ck can a heart be brave? What gives? Hearts I'm pretty sure are inanimate objects and therefore cannot possess human traits and/or characteristics. Wow. Boom. Roasted. Also, why did the makers of this movie feel the need to invent a new country just to have a setting for this film? I'm pretty sure the world is full of countries. Scottland doesn't even sound like a legitimate country. I mean like what even is it a place full of Scotts, like Scott from Accounting? I couldn't imagine a place named after him, much less an entire nation devoted to the Douche. In closing, I give it a 9/10 because it's the prequel to Lethal Weapon.",9,2,4,14 November 2013
