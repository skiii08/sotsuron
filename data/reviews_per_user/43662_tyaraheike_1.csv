The Perks of Being a Wallflower," Infinite in these Moments
","I completely underestimated this movie! I had absolutely no idea what it was about going into it. I actually decided to watch it because it was the only thing available on TV that particular day. This movie was released in 2012, the same year I graduated high school and after I watched The Perks of Being a Wall Flower, I had such an optimistic outlook. This amazing movie made me a so much more thankful for the fact that everyone is different, everyone comes from a different background, and everyone has their own beliefs because of situations they've lived through. People should be who they truly are and shouldn't feel the need to live up to standards of not only others but, society as a whole. I recall a few friends in high school that went out of their way to make it in with the 'cool kids' and ended up embarrassing themselves trying to impress the wrong people and pushing actual friends aside. I was one of those friends pushed aside and honestly, I'm glad because when they realized who was who, I was still there for them. I believe that's what counts in a friendship. I seen this situation in The Perks of Being a Wall Flower and seeing it displayed made me so grateful for this movie! The Perks of Being a Wall Flower depicts the story of a boy coming of age, if you will. The main characters, with a few not mentioned, come together and help each other to conquer heartaches and headaches. The main character Charlie, played by Logan Lerman, is going into his freshman year of high school. He strives to find peace due to a tragedy that happened to him as a child. Someone that would assume the role as a protector betrayed him in one of the worst ways. Charlie keeps this confusing secret to himself and it causes him to act out without really realizing. His whole family undergoes what seems like problems until Charlie reveals the truth. The character Sam, played by Emma Watson, is going into her senior year as Charlie begins high school. Charlie helps Sam improve in her schooling and Sam provides encouragement and shows Charlie happiness. Sam encountered some drama that many girls face going through their high school career. Sam takes her situation and makes the best out of it and I personally think many girls should look up to her - not for the acts she's committed – but, to her attitude after overcoming. Another big character is played by Ezra Miller, Patrick, who is also a senior and Sam's step-brother. Patrick has a secret that shouldn't really be a secret. His over spoken, outgoing, and over jolly personality distracts you, but makes complete sense when the whole story is laid out.In the movie there is a scene where Charlie is taken to his first high school party and ends up eating a brownie, little did he know it wasn't your average brownie he ends up pretty high and speaks his opinions about school, letterman jackets and how the marching band isn't really a sport.., even tells his soon to be girlfriend that she will grow up and regret her current hair-do. On this night Charlie also shares with Sam that he lost his best friend. Sam and her step-brother, Patrick, then welcome Charlie into their circle of friends 'Welcome to the island of misfit toys' and they toast to him. Charlie is now a wall flower – he see's things and understands. I'm such a fan of Logan Lerman (Charlie) because his acting during this scene really shows how touched his character was that not only did people notice him, but accepted and liked him! I think a lot of people, not just teens in high school can relate to at least one of these characters in one way or another. I think this movie brings light to a lot of controversial issues that are often not spoken of due to the seriousness of the acts, it makes this movie that much more brilliant. It reaches thousands of people through a story of a couple of high school kids. Some may see the cover or read the summary on the back of the DVD case and think, 'Meh... just another high school drama movie like The Lizzie McGuire Movie.' This movie offers so much more than ridiculous and over-rated chick drama or a love story that everyone knows the end too. I think every youngster should watch this movie to see how compassion, love, and understanding can affect someone. Over all, I give this movie 10 stars and I highly doubt any disappointment if you watch it.",10,0,1,3 May 2014
