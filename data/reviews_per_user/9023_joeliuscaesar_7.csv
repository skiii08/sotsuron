Requiem for a Dream," All in all an almost perfect modern film
","Normally I don't like to be slapped in the face, however on that rare occasion a slap in the face is needed to awaken your senses from a stupor for which only Hollywood manufactured films can lull you into. Indeed, by the end of the film you, as I did, will feel like your soul has been dragged through the gutter. However, it is not until you truly return to your senses that you finally realise that what you have just experienced is a deliberate act by a talented director (Darren Aronofsky) who is fulfilling his boundless potential.The story is deceptively complex but neatly symmetrical: four New Yorkers find solace in drugs but inevitably fall short of what they hope to achieve. First, Harry Goldfarb (Jared Leto) with his girlfriend Marion (Jennifer Connelly) and best-friend (Marlon Wayanes) are twenty-something junkies who seek to get rich quick from selling their chosen drug. Second, Harry's mother becomes addicted to the dream of appearing on television and diet pills. Although each find what they dream of in the short-term their addictions engulf and replace reality to point where their lives are utterly destroyed.The prominent theme and script is beautifully backed up by a brilliant cast. Despite the pretty boy looks Jared Leto as Harry is exceptional. Jennifer Connelly has had an odd career (Labrynth, Rocketeer and Dark City), her rare beauty could have placed her at the top of the Hollywood name of names, yet she has chosen a challenging movie that highlights not her looks but her talent as an actress.  Marlon Wayans is an under-rated actor who I hope will continue to take on serious roles rather than brainless cliche roles like his performance in Scary Movie. Lastly, the outstanding performance of the movie is Ellyn Burstyn as the ill-fated lonely mother. I watched the re-released version of the Excorcist and wondered what happened to that type of actress and amazingly I find it again in the same actress some twenty years later. She should have been showered in awards.The most pleasing factor to come out of this film is the coming of age for the director Darren Aronofsky. His previous film Pie was a daring debut but Requiem has cemented his place as a director for the future. His style is modern: fast paced editing with the use of experimental camera-work. Yet his greatest attribute is his perception and intellect. This is demonstrated with his clear understanding and commitment to a theme that is expressed in simple but imaginative ways.A final footnote to this film is the music. It seems as though John Williams has created a monopoly in Hollywood. Admittedly Williams is good but Clint Mansell has delivered a score that rivals any of Williams blockbuster soundtracksAll in all an almost perfect movie.",10,0,1,28 December 2001
The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring," Strangers from distant lands, you shall unite to see this brilliant film, or you shall fall.
","WARNING SPOILERSThis movie trilogy better be good for the amount of money being pumped into it. And to a certain extent you can see where the money has gone. As an avid fan of the book I can only say that it's a pretty damn good adaptation. The reason why this book has taken forever to reach Hollywood was pretty obvious; it was always too hard a project. With Peter Jackson (who I can see as a LOTR nerd) as the director he has delivered an admirable film.The hapless Frodo is given a magical ring by his adopted father, and when Gandalf (a wizard) finds out that this is the one ring that the evil lord Sauron once owned, Frodo is charged by Gandalf to make his way to and Elven stronghold: Rivendel. On his way Frodo and his companions are chased by the servants of Sauron, the nine black riders of Mordor. When Frodo makes it to Rivendel the Elf Lord, Elrond, makes it clear that the ring must be destroyed at Mount Doom in Mordor. A fellowship is created,with Frodo as the ring bearer, to enter the dark lands of Mordor and destroy the ring. The final part of the movie is the obstacles they encounter from their enemies including Saruman, a wizard, who has succumbed to the evil of Sauron. For those who have not read any of Tolkein's books they will find that the story is not hard to grasp but the setting will be. The different races and different lands can become confusing but Jackson has done it as simply as he could.Firstly, I'll compare the movie to the book. The movie follows the book very closely with only few admissions. The most obvious omission is the Tom Bombadil sequence, and I don't think I am the only one who thinks that this was an excellent move. Jackson also greatly shortened the Counsel of Elrond which was a must for in the book it is extremely detailed complex. In addition, the sequence in Lorien where the fellowship meets Galadriel was shortened, and I think this was to the detriment of the movie. A couple of scenes where needed elaborate the Galadriel character.There were two major sequences where the movie added to the book, the first was done brilliantly. I am talking of the introduction where Galadriel socialises the audience to the history of the One Ring in middle earth. The scene where the humans are battling Sauron's army was breathtaking and is a good sign of things to come. The second was of course the extension of the Arwen character. I like many other LOTR nerds were skeptical, but I was delighted when I eventually saw it.However, can the movie stand on its own two feet? It most certainly can. The story was exciting and beautifully told, the characters were fully introduced, and the movie was visually spectacular. Although I don't rate it as one of the greatest movies of all-time it is certainly a commendable achievement.",9,0,0,29 December 2001
Mulholland Drive," What a nightmare, what a masterpiece!
","**WARNING**SPOILERS**Was I awake during the movie or was it a dream. Or was it a dream of a nightmare where I watched Mulholland Drive. These are the types of comments I thought to myself as I left the cinema. Yes in parts it is a nightmare to watch, but this is the beauty of David Lynch. Mulholland Drive is a masterpiece of art cinema and an instant cult classic.Like all of his previous movies David Lynch takes the viewer into the realm of the subconscious where reality is blurred with the surreal. In Twin Peaks, for example, we are taken into a seemingly idyllic country town but if we take a closer look we find that that this `reality' is blurred by murder, corruption, prostitution and even a deeper nightmarish evil that lurks in our subconscious. Similarly, Mulholland Drive provides this juxtaposition of the reality and surreal in the context of tinseltown, the dream factory known as Hollywood.Key to understanding this film is a scene at the beginning from the point of view of (a yet to be revealed) Diane Selwyn falling face first into a pillow. Henceforth we enter the dream-world of Diane Selwyn.And a dream-world it is. It is Diane's retrospection of how her life should have played out. Naming herself Betty she steps off a plane full of high hopes of success in a city where dreams come true. Everything is given to her on a plate: a comfortable apartment given to her by an Aunt; a seductive, vulnerable love interest (Rita a.k.a. Chamilla Rhodes) enters her life; her big break in Hollywood is achieved in her first audition; and, a director falls in love with her at first glance. However, even this idyllic dream-world hides an underbelly of dirty-dealings, corruption and murder. Betty's (Diane) love interest, the famous Chamilla Rhodes, was meant to be executed. A car crash allows the now amnesic Chamilla (carrying only money and an odd looking blue key), now naming herself Rita, to wander into the helpful arms of Betty. Adam Kesher, the director of Chamilla Rhodes' latest movie must now replace the missing starlet. However, Adam's choice conflicts with the choice of the corporate studio but stands his ground, to his own demise. The director loses his job, the film is cancelled and even loses his wife. Adam is then given one opportunity by the corporate studio (represented by a ridiculous looking, straight talking cowboy) to get his life and job back. And of course, Adam takes the opportunity and is lured into one of Hollywood's many folds of corruption.The growing love between Rita and Betty, and Betty's continuing endeavours to help Rita regain her memory consume the rest of Diane's dream. Rita is only able to remember one name from her past, none other than a Diane Selwyn. The two women follow this lead and it brings Betty and Rita to Diane's shabby apartment where a corpse of the real Diane Selwyn lays on a bed. Finally, the two women enter a surreal theatre where a blue box is found by Betty. In this box lies the truth, Rita unlocks the blue Pandora's box with her strange key and the dream ends. The corpse in Diane's shabby apartment is told to wake up, we leave the dream and enter the nightmare reality of Diane Selwyn.And a nightmare it is. It is the reality of Diane's life in Hollywood. All of Diane's dreams are fake: she lives in a shabby apartment with unfriendly neighbours; her big break never comes and can only get work in movies Chamilla can get for her; the director is ignorant of her existence; the woman she loves, Chamilla Rhodes, is marrying the director Adam Kesher. And it is this final shocking truth that finally sends the ill-fated Diane into insanity: her jealous rage compels Diane to pay a hit-man to murder Chamilla Rhodes.The dream becomes an abstract parody of her nightmarish reality and of Hollywood. Like Rita in the dream, for example, the blue key is extremely important to unlocking the truth for the audience. The strange blue key in her dream is a normal blue key in her reality. According to the killer in Dianes reality, Diane will know when Chamilla is dead when she sees a blue key. In the dream, Rita finds the key and unlocks the blue box of truth revealing that Diane wanted her killed. Thus the ideal dream ends there. In addition, the idea of the blue box as the keeper of secrets and truths was again seen in Diane's reality in the hands of the scary looking hobo. This could imply that truths in Hollywood are like a piece of rubbish easily discarded and forgotten, like the homeless. A final note, the cowboy, who represents everything corrupt in Hollywood, is taken from a quick glance of a man in costume at a Hollywood party.There are two great features to this film. Firstly, the endless layering of David Lynch's themes will provide multitudes of interpretations and many talking points for years to come. Secondly, Lynch's directorial skill is shown to be second to none. Admittedly, Lynch's trademarks reappear again: fire and flames; red curtains; and that strange looking dwarf. Each of which provide the Lynchian atmosphere' (eerie to say the least). His camera work was imaginative while effectively adding the necessary effects for the surreal world of Mulhollund Drive. If you're open-minded and up for the task it will be a 10/10 film.",10,3,5,22 February 2002
Black Hawk Down," I might have enjoyed it if it wasn't for that damn American flag that was waving in front of the picture.
","**WARNING**SPOILERS**Riddley Scott again baffles me with his new film Black Hawk Down. Scott has shown time and again that he is an extremely talented filmmaker and director. Alien and Bladerunner are masterpieces of the science fiction genre, and in each of his other films (including Thelma & Louise, Hannibal and Gladiator) his expertise as a director shine through. But, and this is a very big but, his choice of subject matter is rather baffling and disappointing. For example, Hannibal although very interesting in that it is an attempt to bring a form of opera-style story to the big-screen, fails to do justice to the original. Gladiator effectively revived the epic genre. However, Hannibal and Gladiator fail in that they have thin plots and, dare I say, seem very corny at times. This isn't necessarily Scott's fault (no it is the writers fault), but a defining characteristic of a brilliant director is their choice of films (such as Lynch or Kubrick).Black Hawk Down is another example of Scott's poor judgement. It is a very simple story made very complicated by a large number of characters that look alike. In essence, the story is so: it is 1992 in Somalia where the U.N. (lead by the U.S military) try to `help' the starving Somalian civilian population by preventing local warlords from controlling the food supply. Hence, the U.S decide that the best method to achieve such an objective is by using their military might to arrest the leaders of the local militia. A plan is conceived but the practical outcomes are disastrous. Some, or should I say a lot of the Somalians didn't like the American's actions and they fight back.  A Black Hawk helicopter crashes, the ground forces get stranded and separated, and rescue missions become difficult as resistance continues.
Scott probably chose this movie to show off his skill behind the camera, and admittedly it is impressive. The urban battle sequences are first-rate (if you like that sort of thing); this was helped by the fact he had a whopping eight camera's to use for each scene. The result is we, the audience, are placed in the middle of the horror of urban warfare. This is an admirable achievement.However, Black Hawk Down has many traits that are less than admirable and even offensive. Principally, the sickening American patriotism was distracting, which completely ruined the movie. A laughable and ludicrous example is when the last of the soldier's get back to safety and the locals applaud them. Additionally offensive is the final listing of the 19 killed U.S soldiers while only mentioning on the side that over 1000 Somalians were killed while not even attempting to name any of the Somalian victims. The movie ventures close to the borderline of racism: I almost left the cinema when the Somalian implied that the gun is their way of life; and why is there only one token African American in this movie? All of these factors utterly destroy this film as an intelligent remaking of an historical event.
So why does Riddley Scott, who I have to assume is an intelligent person since he can be talented as a director, choose such stupid movies? Is it money? A probable answer, you can't help but wonder about the timing of this film so soon after the tragic incident of September 11 and the distressing actions by the U.S government (and its military) consequently following. Or is he so stupid that he believes in what he makes? I hope not.3/10, 3 marks for Scott's skill as a director.",3,2,5,22 February 2002
Vanilla Sky," The movie was mediocre buy I want Aames' flat screen television.
","**Warning*Spoilers**A number of films in recent history have been released concerningwarped realities, dreams and mental illness - Fight ClubAmerican Psycho and Mulholland Drive to name just three - whichattempt to undermine the viewers belief in the protagonists realitythereby providing an entertaining plot twist. The hitherto mentionedfilms did this with varying degrees of success. Mulholland Drivedid this strategy brilliantly since the viewer is left to work it out bythemselves while leaving some level of doubt. American Psycho(especially in the book) was able to achieve this as well. FightClub had one failing: every aspect about this warped reality twistwas revealed and in so doing the audience was treated like achild. Vanilla Sky, like Fight Club, destroys a reasonably goodconcept film by demystifying the story. The first words in the dialogue  Open Your Eyes' spoken bySophia (Penelope Cruz) in the first instance are a link to theoriginal movie and, in the second instance a clue to unravellingthe twist. With these soft words we are awoken to the extravagances of David Aames' life. Aames (Tom Cruise) is filthyrich, handsome and charming; his life seems like a dream to therest of us proletariat. Aames is having what he believes is acasual affair with Julie (Cameron Diaz) but he falls, immediately,in love with Sophia at his own party. Heart broken and desperateJulie commits suicide by driving her car over a bridge with Aamesinside of it. Consequently, Aames is disfigured and almost losesthe three things that made his life a dream: his good looks, thecompany left to him by his father and the woman he loves.
Miraculously, his dream life returns: his face is reconstructed; heretains ownership of his company and; Sophia loves him not forhis looks but for who he really is. However, his life once againbecomes a surreal nightmare when the dead Julie seems to bealive and acting as Sophia  did that sentence make sense?   
This story is told from the point of view of Aames in a prison cellwho is accused of murder. To prepare a defence he tells his storyto a psychiatrist who finally forces Aames to remember theincident where he murders Sophia when he thought she wasJulie. Is that the end? Of course its not. Aames also remembers afreaky incident in a bar where a dorky guy in a suit convinces himthat he is some sort of God. No no he is not a God but only in adream induced by cryogenics. That's right, he killed himself afterwas disfigured and began a dream while cryogenically frozen.Yawn. (I just reread what I just wrote and it sounds really silly. Waita minute maybe it's not my writing but the movie itself.)Okay, so the plot is disappointing. However Cameron Crowe isundoubtedly a talented director who proved his worth with hisprevious film Almost Famous. One scene in Vanilla Sky demonstrates his talent. The nightclub scene showed his talentwith lighting and camera work. It also showed his talent withactors which is poignantly demonstrated by the extremelyawkward moment where a drunk Aames, in a desperate move torenew their relationship, forces Sophia to reminisce their firstflirtatious encounter. Lastly, and most importantly, this scenedemonstrates his knowledge and awareness of music as anecessary tool to convey the emotions of the characters to theaudience. There are few directors who use music as effectively asCrowe. Throughout this movie he uses the music to not onlyconvey the emotions but also to mock them, which is reminiscentof the great Kubrick.In the end this is a hard move to judge because you have atalented director and a mildly interesting story but ruined by a poorending. 6/10  6 for Crowe's performance.",6,0,0,12 July 2002
Monty Python and the Holy Grail," Not just non-stop hilarity
","WARNING `Spoilers'Probably the greatest comedy of all-time (up there with my personal favorites of Annie Hall and Dr. Strangelove) not simply because I have to stop it ten minutes into the film because my abdominals are aching from laughter. No, its because like all good movies it offers more than just two hours of entertainment. It is simple yet complex, stupid but quite intelligent. Let me elaborate: like all Monty Python production their comedy is always abstract and willing to push the boundaries of the absurd.The premise is simple: it is satire of the Arthurian legend where King Arthur bands together the knights of the round table to go on a quest to seek the holy grail. We are therefore introduced to a range of unlikely looking knights who each encounter various obstacles on their quest.The absurdity begins automatically when we see that the knights do not actually ride horses but only skip along holding an imaginary reign with the squire behind the knight making the noise of horses hooves with coconut shells! I mean come on, only the insane Monty Python can come up with something so silly. However, the absurdity does no end there, others include the knights who say Ni, the killer rabbit, and what is with that scene where the guards keep seeing repeats of a charging knight? These are just some of the crazy examples.It becomes complex when it enters the multi-spatial realm. For example, when they enter the cave and encounter the beast it turns to animation, but then the animator dies and we see vision of the actual animator have a heart attack. What's even more complex is the ending where a the host of a 20th century documentary is killed by one of the knights, then the cops arrest King Arthur, what the ... ? This mix of fiction, myth, and reality is very hard to mould together and is done superbly. This can only be done in an intelligent way, and is helped by the fact they are using a comedy genre.All in all a fantastic comedy.",10,0,0,29 December 2001
Donnie Darko," Where would you place Donnie Darko on the Fear-Love spectrum?
","**Warning Many Useful Spoilers**I honestly don't remember puberty being so emotionally orpsychologically distressing. And it wasn't but Donnie Darko is afilm that effectively uses hyperbole and metaphor to tell a storyabout the coming of age of a suburban teenager. Donnie (Gyllenhaal) is a seemingly disturbed individual withemotional problems  he sees a therapist and takes medication.One night a menacing voice of an imaginary rabbit commandsDonnie to get out of bed and leave his house. The rabbit tells himthat the world will end in less than a month's time. When hereturns home he finds his room destroyed by a jet engine.
Donnie believes the imaginary rabbit  named frank  saved hislife and now feels obligated to obey his will. As such the Rabbittells him to commit destructive but imaginative crimes, but thesecrimes have positive consequences. After flooding the school hemeets the love of his life, Gretchen (Malone). The theme of the main plot in this movie is elaborated in theCunningham (Swayze) sub plot. Cunningham is a cheesy self- help spokesperson who preaches that one can only be happy andfulfilled if we overcome our fears and embrace love. This is thedilemma that faces Donnie and it is his true test of maturity.Donnie's emotional problems, which blow-out into paranoidschizophrenia, is simply an exaggeration for the confusing anddifficult emotional hurdles of puberty. Donnie is in denial of thefinal hurdle: the choice of love over fear. In so doing, his fearsswell, which become personified by Frank the evil Rabbit.   
The story becomes convoluted and circular with the integration oftime-travel. Yes I did say time travel. Donnie becomes convincedthat not only can one travel through time but that one can also seeinto the future. This plot seems completely ridiculous but itbecomes instrumental to understanding the ending and, indeed,the whole movie. Professor Monnitoff (Wyle), Donnie's scienceteacher, makes the point clearly: we do not have a set path ordestiny, rather we are given a choice of many paths to take.
Thus, Donnie is given two paths. The first, to be ruled by fear andlet fear destroy everything dear to him. This is the path that isshown by the film. That is, his fear, personified by Frank theRabbit, rules his life and inevitably leads to the death of the twomain loves of his life: his girlfriend and his family. Or he canchoose to die alone in his bedroom by a stray jet engine. ButDonnie is not alone and never was. It is once he realises this thathe comes of age, faces his fears and chooses death. Donnie Darko is magnificent film driven by a strong theme andcomplicated plot. But lets not forget the superb cast. In particular,Gylenhaal, as the emotionally confused and troubled teenager,and Malone, as the depressing and vulnerable love interest, arecompletely convincing. McDonnell after her stint in ER is now firmlyentrenched in the superficially pretentious mother typecast. It iscertainly an impressive supporting cast with Barrymore and Wyleplaying teachers at Donnie's school.Richard Kelly must be considered a writer/director for the futureconsidering this is his debut. It is certainly a slick film withinteresting camera angles and effective editing. What is thegreatest achievement of this skilled director is his ability to createan appropriate brooding mood. The scenes with the rabbit particularly the cinema scene  is eerie and tense. I can't fault this film but it is not for all to see  an inevitable cultclassic. It is esoteric, complicated and thematically driven. Thecast is and direction is brilliant. A cocktail of ingredients rare toHollywood.All in all 10/10.",Null,0,0,24 October 2002
