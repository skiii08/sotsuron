The Ring," The blair witch project 3
","The resemblance with the blair witch was most significant, the same plot the same movie structure... I didn't find it that scary, but the actress Naomi Watts did a good job! I find no structure in the film what so ever, what's up with does horses all of a sudden? Who's voice do you hear on the telephone that says 7 days? How is it that you copy the TAPE that you will not die? Who made the tape, when, why? Although I was not bored while watching, let's say it's a good weekend t.v. film.",Null,1,2,4 October 2003
American Psycho," A story by Bret Easton Ellis
",First off I like to commend that everyone who wants to watch the movie should take some effort in reading the book. This is a great story and it's unlike the movie pretty scary and fascinating at the same time. The book really goes in to detail of the facts 'till you go mad. Now that is something I miss in this film; details. Although there is one great scene with the business-cards exchange. Patrick Bateman is excellently played by Christian Bale thank God they didn't went for Mr. Dicaprio! But what I really want to say is that the film COMPLETELY different is from the book!! So why call it American Psycho?,Null,0,1,4 October 2003
