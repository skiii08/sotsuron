The Blair Witch Project," Good, sweet Lord...
","It's now 2:12am, and I have to leave for work in 2 hours. I'm up, with ALL the lights on. I laugh at 'scary' movies costing tens of millions of dollars, but a couple of kids spent $75,000, and now I cannot turn out the lights. Sure, you've seen 'The Shining,' 'Nosferatu,' and 'The Exorcist,' but you haven't seen anything like this. How am I ever going to sleep again? You can bet I won't be camping anytime soon.",10,1,2,18 July 1999
