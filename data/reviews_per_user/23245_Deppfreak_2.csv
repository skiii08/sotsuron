The New World," Beauty Is Not Always In Words
","This is a BEAUTIFUL film. There are moments in this film when I felt so connected on a completely different level that I almost forgot I was watching a movie. I was distraught emotionally by the story and the powerful, moving narrative. This film is one full of silence, fleeting images, partial sequences, and gorgeously simple moments in time. This is one of the most interestingly edited films because of the juxtaposition of images and the way that the images and earth are allowed to speak for themselves. This film is truly about nature and the voice that it has.Yes, there were moments when I felt that this was a long movie. Yes, there were moments when I was so discouraged by the emotional and physical hardships the characters had to endure that I almost didn't want to continue. But this movie blew me away. It is indescribable in beauty and innocence, and the loss of that innocence is heart wrenching.See it. Feel it. Love it.",8,3,7,21 February 2006
