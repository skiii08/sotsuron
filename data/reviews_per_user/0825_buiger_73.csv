Ali," This could and should have been much better...
","Average movie. What was best in this film (and that was really good) was the Sound, The Soundtrack and the Camera. All of these where at least worthy of a nomination, if not more.On the contrary, the screenplay was totally lacking (I think the Director knew this, hence the very frequent and prolonged musical interludes...) and the dialogs empty, somehow incomplete. In spite of another great performance by Will Smith, the characterization is also sketchy to say the least, we never really get to understand the main characters, their motivations, the reasons for their actions, and therefore can never really identify. All in all, the movie feels superficial, there is no real 'depth' to it. Younger audiences who are not familiar with the actual occurrences 30 years ago will be totally at a loss watching this film. I must say that even I was lost at times (and I actually lived during the period).",6,49,60,16 September 2007
Skyfall," Bitterly disappointed...
","What where the critics thinking?
It really amazes me to read the accolades they poured over this really below average movie, probably the worst Bond film ever...
The only decent (but only decent) part of this movie is the sound and sound editing. Everything else is really, really bad.
Worst of all are the special f/x. Really? A Bond movie with bad special effects? Unfortunately yes. The CGI effects on Silva's 'island' and those at Skyfall mansion are so bad they are ridiculous. In the 21st century we have gotten used to much, much better. I dare to say that the special effects in the Roger Moore movies of the seventies where much better... and they had no computers back then!
Then we come to the screenplay... Oh my god, I do not even know where to begin!
The plot is so full of holes and inconsistencies it is not even funny...
It makes no sense whatsoever. In the beginning the issue is retrieving a stolen list of MI6 agents, but this is completely 'forgotten' half way through the movie...
The villain (Silva, who by the way is so unconvincing it hurts) wants to kill 'M' because of an alleged past betrayal, but basically does everything else but. He could have killed 'M' in a hundred different ways in a dozen situations in the film, but somehow he always chooses 'the hard way'...
In the second half of the film, Bond drags 'M', a frail old lady half way across Britain in order to get away from the villain, with no backup, no outside support (apart from an old and also frail Scottish gamekeeper), only to get her killed at the end of the film... Give me a break!In my opinion, the main problem with all the recent Bond films (especially those of the 'Daniel Craig era') is that the authors have tried to make the movies 'realistic' which is in antithesis to what Bond is supposed to be.
Bond is supposed to drive cars that double as submarines, he never gets shot, he is never dirty, unshaven or sweating. He is a superhero, not a common mortal. Well, in the new Bond movies, this is all gone, he is dirty, unshaven, ill behaved, etc. All for the sake of 'realism'.
But then, very 'realistically', he gets shot in the chest and subsequently falls of a bridge plunging into a 500 ft. gorge, landing in a river... and survives! Really? How realistic is that?
In this film, the only 'gadgets' Bond gets from the new 'Q' (who by the way is outright laughable in the role) is a Beretta handgun and a radio transmitter. Really? Nowadays, we can all buy those items anywhere for a couple of hundred bucks!
Another major issue with the new Bond films is Daniel Craig.
I think he is the worst Bond in history (even worse than pierce Brosnan). He would probably be better in a 'Die Hard' movie, but not as James Bond!
He does not have any of the Bond stile, the 'Savoir Faire', the charisma...
He doesn't even even have a decent British accent for Christ sake!To sum it up (but i could really go on for ever), a pitiful plot, horrible special f/x, below par cinematography and a cast of for the most part horribly miscast actors make for one of the worst Bond films ever!
Lets hope the next one is better.",3,3,6,27 May 2019
Marie Antoinette," Boring...
","What to say..., I found this movie essentially boring, ill-conceived, badly scripted, wrongly cast, etc. The only thing that actually worked well (and it rightly received an Oscar) was the Costume design. The film is actually a picture postcard of 18th century Versailles, nothing more...The main problem with this movie is that it never gets us involved, there is no plot, nothing we can actually come to care for. Nothing ever really happens during the over 2 hours the movie goes on for.While watching the movie, I basically found myself all the time waiting for it to start... The relationship between the two main characters is a mystery, an analysis is never attempted, and the viewer is therefore left stranded, not caring about what happens next. In other, I found Coppola's choice of music obnoxious, absolutely unfit for the movie. Last but not least, the ending is to say the least, ridiculous! All in all, there are much better ways to spend 2 hours, and judging by the cost of the film, various millions of dollars.",4,3,6,16 April 2007
Minority Report," Very Good!
","Spielberg really can make a movie. Very good, well paced, good plot, original idea, and good suspense.If I have to find a point to criticize, I have to say the script does have some small flaws in my opinion, and one or two of the action scenes are a little overdone for my taste. Otherwise I mostly agree with the critics, especially on the fact that the f/x have been masterfully used yet not overdone so as to keep everything realistic. Very realistic is also the overall depiction of the future in fifty years. I really think it is really going to be very similar to what is portrayed, and yes, it does remind me a little of Blade Runner, probably because the author of the original story is the same. Very good entertainment.",8,0,0,14 March 2012
Captain Corelli's Mandolin," Very Good!
","I found it to be a good movie, well written, acted and directed. This film has wonderfully developed characters and is based on a true story (at least the historical part). I agree with James Berardinelli that John Hurt was awesome as Dr. Iannis.This film proves that a movie can have a strong impact even (or especially) without utilizing any special effects. If only more of such character-driven dramas would be produced nowadays. On a slightly negative note: it would have been much more effective if it had been filmed in the original languages (greek, Italian and German) with subtitles, ...but the box office would probably not allow it.",8,1,2,24 March 2012
The English Patient," Average...
","I beg to disagree with the critics. All things considered, I found this film to be no more than average. Yes, the cinematography is good (allbeit no more than a copy of David Lean's technique and style), the acting is excellent, and the story is good, but...But, the film is badly structured (here I agree with Berardinelli) and way, way too long... In essence, I would say that the first two thirds of the film are rather bad and essentially boring, whereas the ending is excellent, and manages to partially redeem the rest. This however is not nearly enough to justify all the hype that the film has created and all the Oscars it has received. I am sure there have been better and more deserving films made in 1996.",6,4,6,30 July 2006
Blade," Good visuals are not enough...
","Now, first I must say that I am not a fan of vampires, vampire movies, etc., which probably places me in a strict minority. Having said that, 'Blade' just goes to prove my point: A rather boring, totally predictable movie full of far too many choreographed ballet scenes (read: fights), which does absolutely nothing to make us develop any feeling whatsoever for the characters. Consequently, we couldn't care less who lives, who dies, or how. The acting is sub-par in my opinion, but this may also be due to the non- existent screenplay. On a positive note, the cinematography, special f/x, costumes and soundtrack where all very good. Unfortunately, that is all this film really is: an over-sized, extremely expensive video clip.",5,1,4,10 April 2015
Alexander," Not a masterpiece, but a good movie...
","Most critics have valid points when commenting on this film, especially Ebert when he sums up the film with 'It says too much, and yet leaves too much unsaid'. Having said this, I think the critics are far tougher on this film than they should be.Yes, the movie does seem a little 'incomplete', but for that to be fixed, it should probably have lasted over 10 hours! Other than that, this is a very well directed film (as usual, Oliver Stone's action scenes are amazingly realistic and well made), a relatively accurate, honest historical reconstruction with some excellent cinematography, special f/x, soundtrack and some great acting! This is a hell of a lot more than most recent Hollywood productions can claim for themselves.To sum up, yes, the film has many flaws, which if fixed would have made it into a masterpiece, but we cannot denigrate it because it is 'only' a good movie instead.",8,0,5,23 February 2006
Troy," Not great, but worth watching...
","A decent, standard Hollywood epic with excellent special effects, but nothing special. I am a sucker for Hollywood epics though...I tend to agree with most critics this time in what they had to say about the motion picture, especially regarding Brad Pitt. He is so far away from being Achilles it almost hurts. Eric Bana as Hector and Peter o'Toole as Priam deliver memorable performances though. They could (should) have been considered at least for nominations by the academy for the Oscar as supporting actors, together with the creators of the special effects.Otherwise Petersen was far from creating even part of the drama he has proved to be capable of in 'Das Boot'. I suppose you can't always get it right...",7,3,7,10 April 2007
Brokeback Mountain," Good movie, but...
","This is definitely a good movie, but not as good as the critics and all the awards would want to make you think.So why all the hype? Simple, the movie deals with a subject that is 'in' and is also very politically correct. Nowadays, that is all that matters. If this movie was made 40 years ago, it would have been shunned by the mainstream and branded as one of those eccentric 'art' films (because at that time it would have been politically incorrect). If it was made 20 years ago, I don't think many people (or critics) would even have noticed it's presence....Anyway, a good movie about an interesting topic that I can recommend. Just don't expect too much.",7,2,15,16 September 2007
Match Point," I love Woody Allen films, but...
","First of all, let me state for the record that I am a big Woody Allen fan, and that I totally disagree with the critics who have highly praised this film. Maybe this is just me 'not able to understand', but this was in my opinion just an ordinary film that any decent director could have made, not something worthy of Woody Allen.I think that for Woody Allen to be filming outside urban New York is like Samson going into a fight with his hair cut. It just isn't there, that something that has made most Woody Allen movies so exceptional. In general I believe that it has been a while since Woody Allen has made a film worthy of his greatness. What a pity...",6,1,2,8 September 2006
Zodiac," Not nearly as good as they say...
","I beg to respectfully disagree with Ebert on this one (and for once, I seem to be in agreement with the Academy, which didn't even give this movie a single nomination). I tend to agree with Berardinelli's review, but I think he rated the movie far too high... I found this movie to be nothing more than average, not gripping at all, and far, far too long. This coming from someone who normally likes very long movies (none of my favorite films are shorter than two hours), but in order to sustain a long duration, you need plot, dialog, etc. In other words, you need quality... Unfortunately this film doesn't have it, or better, doesn't have nearly enough.Having said that, the film also has one major disadvantage, and that is the topic itself, it is totally anticlimactic. By the time this movie was made, almost everybody already knew the story of the Zodiac killer and its ending (or lack thereof), which takes away a large portion (if not all) of the suspense. Under such circumstances it is very difficult to make a movie that will keep the viewers' attention for 160 minutes...",5,0,3,9 April 2010
The Prestige," The magic isn't there...
","I totally agree with Berardinelli on this one. He sums the movie up marvelously when he describes it as: 'The Prestige is cold, and Nolan crafts a storyline that is more complicated than necessary'. And that is exactly the point, the film is so complicated it is almost impossible to follow, it doesn't make much sense, and is therefore not interesting for the viewer. It is also cold, without feelings, thus leaving the spectator indifferent to the proceedings or the final outcome.Subsequently, it doesn't matter any more that the movie is well crafted, in some instances well acted (especially Michael Caine), none of these things can change the viewers' overall sensation of disappointment in watching this film. On a last note, I do not believe the picture deserved any of the two nominations it received; just think about it, this film received a Nomination for best Cinematography and 'Curse of the Golden Flower' didn't...? I really fail to understand what they are thinking over at the Academy sometimes...",3,7,14,6 January 2008
Silent Hill," Bad, bad, bad...
","First things first: I have never played the game and do not know anything about it. Secondly, I am not a fan of computer games... Having said that, i sat down to watch 'Silent Hill'...I have to say it beats me why and how large swaths of humanity can find such a movie (or game for that matter) enjoyable. It rates over 6.6 on IMDb, but there is no sense to it whatsoever, there is no fun in it, and it isn't even scary. In my eyes, it is simply stupid! There is one plus to this motion picture, and that is excellent special effects. But that is about it, there is nothing else worth mentioning, and it is nowhere near enough to make this movie even passable. A total flop!",3,1,3,7 May 2015
Hotel Rwanda," A great anti-war film, maybe one of the greatest...
","A very powerful film. This movie is one of the strongest anti-war testimonies of our time, without hardly ever showing the actual fighting itself. It shows the pain of the victims instead...It possesses the kind of emotional power only true stories have and unfortunately, all that is portrayed in this film really happened. Even though the film doesn't actually show very much of the killing and bloodletting directly, it is still more painful to the viewer than a strong punch to the stomach...The characters are real, earthly creatures like any one of us, you can feel their pain and you don't sympathize with them, you hurt together with them while watching this film. Well done, a great film, a film that really needed to be made!",9,0,0,14 March 2006
We Were Soldiers," Excellent!
","Excellent, very powerful film, well written, directed and filmed. The special effects are great, especially because you never actually notice them as such. The resulting scenes are impressive, as realistic as can be short of going onto the battlefield yourself, and in many instances, this film makes you feel as if you were really there. It actually hurts to watch this movie in certain moments.This movie is all the way up there with Apocalypse Now, Full Metal Jacket, The Deer Hunter and Platoon, with one big plus point: it is not politically motivated! It is shameful that the academy didn't find this film worthy of even one Oscar Nomination (I could think of at least 6 categories where it should have won an Oscar)... But then again, we all know you do have to be politically oriented (to the far left) in order to be accepted in Hollywood. What a shame!Thumbs up! This is one great movie.",9,3,6,16 January 2007
Blade II," If you love Ballet...
","I found it slightly better and more entertaining than the original 'Blade', albeit not by much. The special effects here are really great, but there is far too much blood, too many long and unnecessary 'ballet' scenes and generally far too much 'shoot-em-up' footage for my taste. When you think of it, in order to kill the vampires, you don't really need all those weapons, martial arts knowledge, etc. All you need is a flashlight with a good battery! Maybe I am being overly pragmatic here, but even as I wish for films that go over the top (surely, the movies are and remain a 'dream factory'), I would also like them try to make some sense at the same time. Otherwise it can get to be annoying.",5,1,4,28 May 2015
The Devil Wears Prada," A Hollywood lecture...
","A Hollywood lecture on Moral and Ethics... Give me a break! - Working hard is 'out', your boss is the devil, having a successful career is wrong, or at least immoral... Things that are 'in' include being sloppy, average, unsuccessful, going back to your boring, loser boyfriend, quitting a dream job because it is demanding ('...because hell, a job mustn't be demanding at all to be considered worth keeping nowadays...'), etc.These are just some of the messages this movie passes on to the audience... How much more 'political correctness' can a decent human being take all at once... What a load of contemporary liberal Hollywood Bu****it! Berardinelli hits the mark when in his review he asks: 'Whatever happened to hard-edged endings in satires?' Yes, exactly, what happened to them? Well, the answer is: We invented political correctness...Having said that, on a positive note, the performances of Meryl Streep and Stanley Tucci are by far the best thing in this movie, the only thing that makes this film worth watching. Again I will borrow from Berardinelli's review where he says: 'When Streep, Blunt, and Tucci are together, the scene crackles with energy. When none of them are present, The Devil Wears Prada slips into a black hole'. In other, I agree with the nomination the movie received for the costume design, which was really good. Otherwise, this was a mediocre film.",4,1,2,10 March 2007
Bridget Jones's Diary," Excellent!
","Excellent. This is as good as romantic comedies come. It is witty, intelligent and funny. I rarely give such high marks (especially for this type of movies), but this film really deserves it. This film has to be something exceptional as it is one of those increasingly rare occasions on which both I and the critics all seem to be in total agreement (only the Academy is conspicuously absent, as usual)My compliments for the screenplay. It certainly deserved an Oscar together with Renée Zellweger who's mere Oscar Nomination doesn't do justice to the great performance she made in this movie. Great direction, soundtrack, acting, etc. Congratulations to all involved.",9,1,1,10 July 2009
Top Secret!," Bad...
","I could not disagree more with Roger Ebert this time. He claims that his friend (who according to him, apparently has no sense of humor) only laughed five times during this movie. Well, I didn't even manage that... There have been before and after much better movies in this sub-genre, Airplane! and Police Academy, to name just two. This one is a meaningless assembly of gags, most of which aren't even good. If you are looking for a good parody of WWII movies, then go and watch the TV series 'Allo, Allo' which was also filmed in the 80-ies. Now that is what I call a good parody, and it is hilarious!All in all, Top Secret! is a waste of time. A pity that the Airplane creators couldn't manage anything even close to the quality of their first picture.",3,4,19,24 July 2006
Fargo," Good movie, but...
","I totally agree with the critic James Berardinelli, especially when he says in the conclusion: 'The absence of viable characters limits any dramatic impact, making this more of a laid back, lightly entertaining experience than a fully immersive one.' This more or less sums it up.Otherwise a very good depiction of 'inside America', its contradictions and the simplicity of it's people (the police interview with the two hookers is memorable). A good film, excellent story (reality always beats fiction, it is amazing what can happen in real life), but the simplistic, one-sided characters depicted diminish the overall effect of the picture.",7,0,0,1 April 2012
The Aviator," Not bad, but...
","I didn't find this film to be anything more than a solid piece of work, definitely not one of the great movies of our time.Scorsese just can't seem to get it right any more! After the total catastrophe with 'Gangs of New York' he now tries again with Di Caprio in The Aviator. One major flaw in this film in my opinion is the casting of Di Caprio for the role of H.Hughes. He just isn't right for the part, which cannot be said for Cate Blanchett and Kate Beckinsale both of whom do a great job impersonating respectively K.Hepburn and A.Gardner.The second and to me most important flaw is in the script. The characters are not well developed and the storyline is somehow discontinuous. As a result, we never really understand who Howard Hughes really was, what he felt, what the relationship between him and the women in his life really was, and ultimately as a consequence, we cannot feel for him. To be great, a movie has to generate some kind of emotional response in the viewer, and this one doesn't, it leaves us cold. It would have been different if the film had spent much more time in showing Hughes' feelings, his doubts, his financial troubles and how he risked to overcome them. Instead, in the film it seems that he was just an eccentric genius who had some great ideas and who needed only to order his people to 'fix it' in order to have them realized. Nobody's life is that simple, and I cannot imagine Hughe's was either.In other, camera and special effects where rather good and not exaggerated, the sound average. The overall large amount of Oscars and Nominations the film received is in my opinion, undeserved. All in all, The Aviator is a mediocre to good, but not great, filmed biography that will probably soon be forgotten.",7,1,2,1 January 2006
The Bourne Identity," What a pity...
","What a pity... To waste such a good literary premise by completely uprooting the original and turning the movie into a collage of video spots of various action scenes that make no sense whatsoever and in many cases are totally unrealistic (especially the ending scene). Furthermore, and most importantly, Matt Damon is one of the worst casting choices that I have seen in decades. He has less to do with Jason Bourne than Mickey Mouse or Goofy do. He stars in this film playing a seasoned CIA murderer looking like a confused high school kid on prom night! Finally, as a consequence of not following the book at all, the movie ends up without a storyline to follow, the characters are shallow, empty and therefore the viewer cannot identify and ends up not caring as to what happens to them. Action in itself is not enough to justify the making of a film, certainly not a successful one. Unfortunately, it seems that in Hollywood nowadays, they think it is.",6,0,1,11 January 2006
"I, Robot"," A pleasant surprise
","I found this to be a very entertaining, but in many ways also 'smart' film. Yes there are flaws, and yes the plot is overly simplistic, but in my view the positive aspects by far outweigh the negative ones. To list just a few:<ul><li>Excellent special f/x, worthy of an Oscar, not just a nomination</li></ul><ul><li>Very Good camera and sound</li></ul><ul><li>Good acting by Will Smith (yet again...)</li></ul><ul><li>A very detailed, plausible vision of the near future</li></ul><ul><li>Last but not least, while never ceasing to be rather simple and entertaining, the movie asks a few very interesting philosophical, moral and ethical questions, without pretending to shove any answers down our collective throats.</li></ul>Here is a science fiction action movie well done!

Jarhead," Not entirely my thing...
","I was not as impressed as the critics by this totally-politically-correct movie. Not all wars are meaningless, not all people in this modern world of ours are without a sense of what is good, what is right and worth fighting for. Furthermore, I refuse to buy in to the overt simplification and to believe that all US Marines are basically retarded morons.I have read the book, and even though it is not one of my favorites, it is very much different from the film, as books usually are. To me, this was not much more than an average film, one that leaves many problems untouched, many questions unanswered.",6,0,1,16 July 2006
Ratatouille," Excellent!
","Well done! It is truly incredible how good computer animation can be nowadays. There are countless scenes in this film which are so good, they are jaw-dropping. Helping the overall experience are awesome sound effects which make this movie so realistic, you can almost feel the rats as if they where passing through your living room, you could almost smell them... I really hope the Academy will honor this come February...To top it all off, a nice story (which could have been a little 'deeper' though, especially for the adults), a very realistic representation of life in a top-rated restaurant (kitchen) and some great action scenes, make this an excellent film. Definitely worth watching, a real treat!",8,1,2,3 January 2008
Pearl Harbor," Entertaining
","I didn't think the movie was as bad as most of the critics did.Yes, the story is overly simplistic, there is little historical perspective and attention to detail, but what's the big deal? The movie is what it was intended to be: a high-budget, typical Hollywood blockbuster, to be taken all-at-once with a good dose of popcorn and beer.What's wrong with that? Not all films can or should be artistic masterpieces! The camera and sound is excellent (the Oscar for sound f/x was well deserved), the acting is good to very good (Kate Beckinsale is gorgeous in the 40's look) and overall, the movie is fun to watch, it provides for 3 hours of very decent entertainment.Just don't expect any metaphysical musings and you'll be alright.",8,1,4,10 May 2006
Underground," If only he had stuck to making films, and not gone into politics...
","This is a very difficult movie to judge. It is definitely a very powerful film, well photographed, acted and directed, but in my opinion also with some major flaws. The main problem is that Kusturica cannot make up his mind whose side he is on, and this, for someone coming from the ex-Yugoslavia and who has witnessed the happenings, is unbelievable. Apart from being nostalgic for the 'good old days when all the people where united, happy and carefree' (even though he does in a way, condemn communism), at the same time he is condoning almost every atrocity by telling us that 'it is simply human nature'... For me, this is not enough.When I heard during the civil war that he had left Sarajevo for Belgrade I found it to be strange, but only before having seen this film. Now all is clear. For a great secular Muslim director from Sarajevo (that is at least what he was before he became a Serb nationalist...) to make a Serbian propaganda film in the middle of a civil war involving these two ethnic groups, is simply too much. To make it even worse, in the film there is also a scene at the beginning (subtle but definitely there) where he pictures the entire Slovenian and Croatian nations as blatantly pro-Nazi, which is not only historically incorrect, but simply offensive to those peoples (after all, he seems to forget that his beloved Tito who fought and finally defeated the Nazis in Yugoslavia during WW2 was not a Serb, but a Croat). Last but not least, he conveniently forgets in the film how and why the whole mess in Yugoslavia started in 1991...Kusturica is definitely a great artist (or should I say was), but since he has politicized himself, I am sorry to say, he has lost it. Trust the French to be the only ones to give him an award for this film.",6,13,36,21 January 2006
Quantum of Solace," This is not Bond...
","I totally agree with Ebert. James Bond is definitely not an action hero, he is a myth, a state of mind. Therefore, Quantum of Solace is not a Bond movie, it is something else. Something I don't like at all. I didn't like Casino Royale, and I like Quantum of Solace even less. Call me old-fashioned, call me nostalgic, but I do long for the times when Bond had style, class (Craig does wear immaculately tailored suits, but in essence is nothing but a thug when compared to Connery or Moore), had time to talk, have sex, dry martinis, etc.And then there is the action... Less (much less) would have been more. The movie is basically nothing else but a series of ridiculous, over the top action scenes which are totally incomprehensible, unbelievable and unrealistic. To top it off, the sound in the movie is so bad, you can barely discern the dialog (the little that is there) and the action scenes are yes, deafening but that is all they are. How could they have produced such bad sound in a major, high budget production in the 21st century is a mystery to me (I saw the movie with DTS sound on blu-ray and a top-notch audio system, so there is no excuse there...).All in all, in my eyes a total flop; This is not Bond, this is something else.",5,13,18,21 January 2010
Alien vs. Predator," Very decent, unpretentious Entertainment...
","Once again, I beg to disagree with the critics. Yes, this film is surely not a quintessential milestone in the history of cinematography, but it is simple, well made, ordinary popcorn-and-beer type entertainment. What's so wrong with that? Films are supposed to entertain, distract from the problems of everyday life or aren't they?I found the idea behind the story to be original and even though things are kept essentially simple and neither the story or the characters are very much developed, I didn't find it boring at all, there is more than enough tension involved. Yes, I know most of the story doesn't make sense, that it isn't realistic. I am usually the first person to complain about that in other movies, but when you go to watch a movie like AVP, you must expect this. Such movies are not even supposed to make sense... And then, then there is the most important and best thing about this film - the special effects. They where really excellent. I have seen many a big budget film with much less realistic scenes than the ones in this movie (the 'dinosaur stampede' in the recent 'King Kong' just to name one). What else do you need in a movie like this? I have seen much much worse in the past than AVP, which to say the truth, actually delivered much more than I expected.On a final note, I do agree with most critics that the last scene is lame and predictable, but come on, one has to prep the ground for a sequel..., doesn't one?",5,2,4,3 March 2007
Batman Begins," A movie well made, but...
","Good film, but not as good as most of the critics are saying, in my opinion. There are several minor setbacks that make this movie slightly less than what it could have been and therefore allow Spiderman 2 to still remain the best motion picture in recent memory in this particular category. Some of these negative points are:<ul><li>In the beginning, during the 'training' of Batman, the film borrows heavily from Star Wars, which is unacceptable, especially considering that the scenes include Liam Neeson whom we very well remember from those great films.</li></ul><ul><li>The car chase is totally over the top and doesn't fit in with the rest of the film.</li></ul><ul><li>The chemistry between Christian Bale and Katie Holmes doesn't work</li></ul><ul><li>The plot doesn't tie all of the loose ends together (for example, the extent of the involvement of Wayne Enterprises in the criminal plot to poison Gotham city with hallucinogens)</li></ul>Having said that, the movie has also many positive points:<ul><li>First and foremost, Michael Caine and Morgan Freeman who are both excellent as always</li></ul><ul><li>The film is generally well acted and the script is believable (for a comic book)</li></ul><ul><li>The camera is very good (I therefore agree with the Oscar Nomination, even though I think the sound was even better and would have merited a Nomination as well)</li></ul><ul><li>The special effects are also very good</li></ul>All in all, a movie well made, definitely worth watching, but not a masterpiece.",7,1,3,26 February 2007
Blue Crush," Senseless...
","To me this was just a senseless 86 minutes of cinematography, and a total waste of time. I fail to understand why and how people manage to get funding for such projects, and how it comes that nobody notices how lame the production they are making really is. How can a Director (who obviously isn't incompetent, considering the good surfing scenes in the movie) not see that the story that he is filming is stupid, that it makes no sense, that the acting sucks, etc., and if he does notice, why doesn't he do anything about it? Why doesn't the Producer do anything about it? Why doesn't anyone do anything about it?The story is a clichÃ©' (it is so 'interesting' I didn't even notice when the movie had ended...), the screenplay and dialogs are on the level of a 5-year old, and the acting... let's better not talk about the acting. If it wasn't for some decent cinematography, the scenery in Hawaii and the pretty girls, this film would not even have deserved 1 star...",3,1,2,10 January 2010
Meet the Fockers," Entertaining
","I beg to disagree with most of the critics on this one. I actually liked this movie a little better than 'Meet the Parents', and it is very rare for me to prefer a sequel to the original. There was some good acting in this movie, which is no wonder given the caliber of the cast. Make no mistake, this was definitely not a masterpiece, the script could have been better and the last 20 minutes of the film are a little overdone and cheesy, but all in all a decent, entertaining movie.One thing I found to be a little disturbing about this film is the message it sends, especially to the younger audience: 'It is wrong to be straight, to have strong principles and self-discipline (the Byrnes), whereas it is proper to have no inhibitions, no discipline, no job (somehow everybody is rich anyway) and the world is just a happy merry-go-round (the Fockers). Even coming from liberal Hollywood, this is still wrong.",6,19,39,10 September 2006
Saving Private Ryan," Spielberg has done it again!
","I agree with almost everybody on this one: this is definitely a very good film. The first part is excellent and is almost certainly destined to become part of cinematic history. The original music score and the special effects are uniformly excellent and the cinematography very good.Having said all the above however, I did also find some faults (albeit small) hence the rating of (only) 8/10. Let's try to explore some briefly: I think the story was a bit lacking, slightly oversimplified. More in- depth characterization would have improved the movie in my opinion. Apart from this, I also think (and i am well aware that most will disagree with me here) that Tom Hanks was completely miscast here. To me (even though he is undoubtedly a great actor), he never even remotely resembles the tough, no-nonsense, war hero he is supposed to be playing. Just think of John Wayne in a very similar role in 'The Longest Day' and you will probably see what I mean.Havind said the above though, this is and remains an excellent film. Spielberg has done it again!",8,0,0,17 October 2015
City of God," Not nearly as good as advertised...
","I saw this movie with a couple of friends, and none of us had any prior knowledge of the film. Interestingly enough, none of us where overly impressed... I only realized afterwards, when I went on to IMDb to write my review, that this is considered by many to be one of the best motion pictures ever made! I was shocked. Not to say that it is a bad movie, because it isn't, but it is nowhere near being very good, let alone a masterpiece.What is it missing? Well, in my opinion, a lot. For starters, the script is very weak. We hardly get to know any of the characters well enough, and consequently do not care what happens to them. This is a major flaw, a 'conditio sine qua non', I cannot imagine a good movie that does not transmit emotions. The same is with the cinematography... The camera is too hectic, the cuts too frequent, the movie looks too much like a video spot or a commercial. I know it is modern, but I find it unfit for a full length motion pictures.So why then all the hype? In my opinion, most people living in the developed world nowadays are so far removed from the harsh realities of life, so used to living their comfortable, politically correct, protected, cuddly lifestyles that seeing something like this is so far from their understanding that it 'shocks' them and they believe they are experiencing something metaphysical, highly artistic... Consequently, they praise these movies in the belief that by doing so, it also makes them more 'artistic', because they can 'understand'. How sad.",7,4,6,28 May 2017
Cars," The story is missing...
","A good, solid production from Pixar, as usual. Great design, computer animation, special f/x, soundtrack, etc. But, having said that, I have to say I expected much more from this film and was slightly disappointed in the end. This mostly due to an overly simplistic script and a story that fails to engage the viewer and 'capture' him at any point.If it wasn't for the great animation, especially the landscapes, this film could even be described as boring at times. We can always foresee the next scene from the beginning to the end, there are no real relationships developed, no real characters (cars) we can come to care for, hardly any real emotions involved, all of which is very strange for a Disney motion picture which usually thrives on emotions. The only 'real' character in the film and therefore in my opinion it's best part is Mater, whose human actor, 'Larry the Cable Guy' gives an impressive performance. If only more of the characters in this film where like that...",6,1,2,10 September 2006
Frozen," Not impressed
","I was not as impressed as everybody else. I found this to be yet another well done, professionally made Disney product, nothing more, nothing less. I fail to see any signs of greatness in it, other than perhaps the soundtrack. I found the story to be rather shallow, appealing only to kids (but I suppose it was made for them in the first place), the animation rather 'fake' looking for today's standards, geared only toward 3D viewing. You could see it was all computer animated, and while we know that all animated movies nowadays are made that way, it shouldn't be that obvious. It almost looked like a Japanese Manga at times...All in all, a decent movie kids will surely like, but otherwise nothing special.",6,5,13,9 May 2014
The Lives of Others," Totally overrated...
","I think this is a film which (for some to me mysterious reason) was loved by the critics, and has then been pumped up to the status of a masterpiece through the media by those same critics (someone once said: 'repeat a lie long enough and everybody will believe it eventually'). This is one of those films where if you dare say anything negative about it, you cannot call yourself an intellectual any more in most 'well to do circles'. The problem is, this film isn't a masterpiece. It's a slightly-above-average film, telling a compelling story that could have been told so much better.What is missing is that there is no 'feeling' in this film, the viewer is in no way transported into the atmosphere of those dark times, the oppressive society that once was (to better understand what I mean, you should watch 'Goodbye Lenin' which although essentially a comedy (satire), is immeasurably better in depicting those times in East Berlin). There is no real feeling of danger, the characters seem unreal, and consequently we don't care what happens to them. Even the most dramatic scene in the film when one of the main characters commits suicide, I don't think anyone is really moved!Last but not least, the 'main issue' of the film, the transformation of a fanatic communist and secret agent of the infamous Stasi into a sentimental, self-destructive, pathetic traitor is totally unbelievable (but maybe politically correct nowadays). Unfortunately, that is not the way things work in real life. No, This film is definitely not a masterpiece...",5,40,82,28 March 2007
Coyote Ugly," Good!
","I strongly disagree with most of the critics on this one.This is a very solidly made romantic comedy. It is fun, entertaining and sports an excellent musical score. The story is clichéd yes, but remains believable and above all, with a completely original premise. The scenes at the bar are really well made, the atmosphere that transpires is electrifying. Everything is above par, the sound, the cinematography and the acting. Oh, and I almost forgot; the girls are fabulous...What else does one need for an entertaining afternoon at the movies? Well done.",7,2,3,12 April 2015
Million Dollar Baby," Great movie!
","I basically agree with Ebert's and Berardinelli's reviews here. This was a very well made film about life, populated with real, flesh and blood characters. Apart from a regular, well developed 'boxing plot', the movie also poses a very difficult question about euthanasia, especially considering that this is a major US release. Eastwood answers it bravely and in a manner that will not be seen everywhere as being politically correct.Oscar level performances by all three main characters, but especially Hilary Swank and Morgan Freeman (so the Academy and I finally agree, for once). The camera was also very good. One of the all time great movies! Well done Clint!",9,1,2,4 April 2012
The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo," Not bad, but somewhat disappointing...
","Contrary to most, I have to say that I expected much more from this movie. Having read the book(s), which I believe all to be masterpieces of their genre (especially this one, the first one of the series) I was really looking forward to seeing this film. Alas, I was somewhat disappointed... Not that this was a bad, poorly made film, because it isn't. It is however, nowhere near in bringing to the viewer the plot, the atmosphere and the emotions of the book (which is often the case with the filming of great books). Having said that, I must also say that the filmmakers eventually 'found their way' when making the second and third installments of the series, which where much, much better than this first movie in the trilogy.Now I am looking forward to seeing the Hollywood version of this book, hoping for the best...",5,0,0,29 November 2014
Black Hawk Down," Good, but not excellent
","Basically I agree with the majority of the critics, a good movie, but I didn't find it to be as outstanding as most claim.I missed the background information at the beginning, then a lot of necessary info regarding to the why's and how's of the various battlefield decisions and situations. The movie was sometimes difficult to follow. Another thing that puzzled me, and I don't know if this is true, but the film portrays the Rangers as a bunch of idiots, or better said a bunch of ordinary soldiers, 'cannon food' as the Germans would put it, not in any way the elite troops they are supposed to be. Only Delta is portrayed as an elite force, it's members are seen as self confident, knowledgeable and experienced, and the difference between the two in the movie is mind-boggling.Furthermore, I found a lot of scenes, dialogs and ideas (especially at the beginning of the film) have been 'borrowed' from films like 'Apocalypse Now' and other Vietnam classics. On a positive note, the camera and sound effects where excellent. Once again, good, but not excellent.",7,0,0,25 June 2006
The Insider," Very Good!
","Finally, now here is a movie where everybody seems to agree on the same verdict. It is a very rare occasion that most of the major critics, the Academy and myself all agree on the judgment of the quality of a motion picture. This only goes to say that this film really has to be good. It also goes to show that the best movies are almost always based on true stories. Truth always trumps fiction.This movie was very well directed and well filmed, but above all it was well acted. Both Crowe and Pacino deliver memorable, believable performances, creating characters for which we can feel for, with whom we can identify. I agree on most of the Oscar Nominations, but I also feel that maybe an Oscar was warranted for best screenplay which is probably the best part of this motion picture.Thumbs up!",8,9,11,18 March 2009
"Girl, Interrupted"," Now this is what I call acting...
","Nice, introspective movie, with no action scenes or special effects for a change. Instead, with good dialog, character building and some great acting. What Angelina Jolie has done in this film is awesome. It is one of the best acting I have seen in years! Winona Ryder is convincing as Susanna, and I would also like to mention Elisabeth Moss ('The West Wing') who did a good job in a difficult role as Polly. I was surprised how low key Whoopi Golberg's role was and how little she stands out in this motion picture.What ruins the overall judgment a little is the ending with it's typically 'Hollywoodian' basement scene climax which was totally unnecessary. Otherwise a very nice 'actors' film, definitely worth watching.",7,3,5,11 April 2007
Blood Diamond," Reality always works...
","Good film. This movie has all the ingredients a film of its kind needs: Action, drama, romance, and a real historical base on which to build. It is therefore no wonder that it succeeds in providing more than two hours of very good entertainment. Could it have been better? Of course, but then again what couldn't?I found myself in agreement also with the Academy on this one (a rare occasion). All five Nominations are well deserved, even though none of them may have been quite good enough to actually receive an Oscar award. I was positively surprised by DiCaprio (who never was a favorite of mine anyway). His performance was very good, he is really starting to mature now (finally). In other I believe the strongest aspect of this film is that it deals with the African reality with eyes wide open, no compromises, no wholes barred. It shows it like it is, and it paints a very powerful picture in doing so.Not a masterpiece, but highly recommended.",8,0,0,16 September 2007
The Mummy Returns," A waste of time and money...
","This is one of those classic cases in which the sequel is nowhere near as good as the original. Then, when you consider that the original wasn't all that good to start off with, what you are left with is rather little. The story is so preposterous, it isn't even funny any more.Universal just had to make a sequel for financial reasons, but the filmmakers didn't have any ideas left on how to make one. So they put together whatever came to mind and forged it into a movie hoping that a ton of special effects will make it watchable... It didn't. The result is a mess not even a 5-year old kid will find plausible. This is in my opinion all that 'The Mummy Returns' really is.",3,0,0,11 January 2008
Toy Story 2," Good, solid entertainment...
","Good film, but nothing extraordinary.The animation was as good (if not better, due to the advance of technology) as in the first movie and this is a solid movie, good entertainment. I however do not share the enthusiasm of most critics. I think that (same as in the first Toy Story) the screenplay lacks 'depth' and witty dialog. 'Nemo' and especially 'Shark Tale' have later proved how good an animated film can really be... In my opinion, the only characters that are actually fun to watch and do have some character development are Mr. Potato Head and Rex the Dinosaur. This also thanks to excellent acting (voices) by respectively Don Rickles and Wallace Shawn whose performances are far better than those of the two stars, Hanks and Allen. One of the two (if not both) would definitely have deserved at least an Oscar Nomination for their performances in both films.",7,0,1,15 August 2006
The Last Samurai," Very Good!
","Finally a movie that depicts the wright values, in the best of Hollywood traditions of times now long gone. This film is about friendship, honor and pride, all of whom unfortunately look so archaic today, almost as if they do not (and according to many, shouldn't) exist any more. Luckily, there are still some of us who believe in such principles and try to live by them. As the movie shows, they may be old fashioned, but some human values are timeless as well as priceless.I am not a great fan of Tom Cruise, but in this film I think he did a very good job. His acting was very good, never over the top, very believable. For an actor so well known and identified by the public with a completely different image, this must not have been easy. Ken Watanabe's performance was amazing, incredibly powerful, definitely worthy of at least an Oscar Nomination. I cannot imagine anybody could have portrayed this for us alien culture any better that he did. My compliments go also to the Director, this film was very well directed and filmed. The sound, camera and costumes should also all receive at least a nomination (amazing, the Academy and I almost completely agree this time). All in all, very good, quality entertainment. Well done.",8,3,6,12 March 2007
Pulp Fiction," What's the big deal?
","I really don't know what the big deal is. This is obviously another one of those 'highly intellectual' movies I am too stupid to understand. The critics compare it to 'The Godfather'... I find that to be sacrilegious! I agree with one critic only when he states that the film 'presents meaningless issues in an intensely-fascinating and almost lyrical fashion', and I would like to put a big emphasis on MEANINGLESS!!! How can something meaningless be good?Another famous critic, Roger Ebert, claims 'Seeing this movie last May at the Cannes Film Festival, I knew it was either one of the year's best films, or one of the worst. Tarantino is too gifted a filmmaker to make a boring movie, but he could possibly make a bad one...' That is amazing! One of the world's most acclaimed film critics watches a 'masterpiece', and right after that cannot decide whether it is really a masterpiece or garbage? Then he goes on to say, 'oh, but it can't be garbage if such an in-director made it, so it must be a masterpiece'. So much for competent individual judgment... I suppose you would not be able to call yourself a critic if you wrote that Tarantino simply screwed up this time...In my opinion, the film has a ton of famous actors, an 'in' director, and nothing else. The plot is practically non-existent, there is no message, no 'higher' meaning, nothing but violence for the sake of violence..., and above all, it does not entertain either! If this is art nowadays, I want to go back to the past!",4,15,32,14 March 2012
It's a Wonderful Life," I beg to disagree...
","Now, here is one movie where I will have to disagree with almost everybody. I do not care that this film has become a Christmas staple, and notwithstanding my love and admiration for Frank Capra and James Stewart, this movie is far from even being particularly good, let alone a masterpiece. This is a movie that somehow got hyped up with the passing of time, and now exists in a universe of its own. It is telling that at the time of its making, it did not even receive a single Oscar. Apparently, at the time, nobody thought it to be so special...Now, if you look at this picture objectively and without the typically 'small-town-America do-good pink-shaded sunglasses', you will find a very simple, obvious and at times boring story. The characters are so simplified, that most are just caricatures of real people (just look at the local villain). Technically, there is nothing to write home about either. The sound, as a matter of fact is terrible, one can barely discern the (sometimes confusing) dialog.And then we come to (according to the masses, and not only) the most important part of the movie: the message. Here is where I have another major problem... I may be cynical or stupid, but I do not see what this all-important transcendental message is; If it is simply 'be a good person', this could have been (and has been) done much better. This movie is a mix of slapstick Hollywood 'feel good' and of political correctness '1947 style'. No wonder it fares so good in our modern times...",5,12,25,9 May 2014
Enemy at the Gates," It could have been so much better...
","This is a difficult movie to rate, especially because it is so full of contradictions.The film has a powerful story, great, incredibly realistic cinematography and excellent special effects. On the other hand, while trying to be realistic in the cinematic sense, it completely fails to be that with regard to the story, and above all, attention to details: First and foremost, the shooting accuracy shown in the film is simply impossible, it cannot be done. Secondly, the depiction of life in the city outside of the 'shooting duel' is totally unbelievable, it has a semblance of normality, as if the war in that city didn't exist, as if only the duel seems to be happening... Furthermore, the characters... the depicting of Nikita Khruschov is so cartoonesque, it isn't even funny any more... no, no, no! The sharpshooter Maj. Koenig, his character would have been depicted in a more believable manner in any average comic book!Nevertheless, the sheer potential of the story, the camera and the special effects make this film worth watching and elevate it to slightly above average.",7,1,2,2 April 2006

There is absolutely nothing in this movie worth mentioning positively.The Script - nonexistentThe Plot - nonexistentThe dialogs - nonexistentThe camera - HorribleThe sound - BadThe soundtrack - nonexistentThe acting - Horrible (The chemistry between Jolie and Pitt is equal to that of 'Na' and 'Cl' when they get together to form a molecule of salt...).What else is there to say...

","It seems it is absolutely forbidden to criticize Hollywood's 'holy cows' nowadays, hence all the positive reviews for this film. Well, thank god for Ebert this time! He seems to be (almost) the only one with enough guts to say the truth about this film, which is simply: this movie sucks! If I hadn't seen it for myself, I would never have believed that Spielberg is capable of making such a bad movie (after having made 'Minority Report' to make something like this...).The only thing that was good in this film was Dakota Fanning's performance together with (partly) Tim Robbins. Everything else will very soon be forgotten. The plot is preposterous, the storyline impossible, completely unbelievable, and the ending even more so. Tom Cruise is, like the movie itself, very close to the realm of the ridiculous (he was rightly nominated for a Razzie award as worst actor, but on the contrary of course, the Academy had the bad taste to nominate the film for three Oscar awards...). I have read comic books much more complex and believable than this film!",4,2,4,5 June 2007
Love Actually," It starts off well, but...
","This is yet another film on which the critics (as well as most of the viewing public for that matter) and I completely disagree. Not that I think that this was a bad film, but it surely wasn't a good one either.The movie starts of fine, but then soon enough spins off into the realm of the ridiculous, childish and impossible without even being funny. In essence, this film ends up not being romantic, dramatic, funny (except for one or two scenes with Rowan Atkinson) or anything else for that matter. For example, just figure the probability of a British PM knocking on doors in the middle of the night looking for a lost girlfriend (and by the way, Hugh Grant is pathetic and totally unbelievable as the PM), or a kid simply running through airport security virtually unhindered (whith his father encouraging him to do so), etc. This list could go on and on... It's a pity, it could have easily been so much better, especially considering all the acting talent involved.Average.",5,0,2,26 February 2007
Downfall," Definitely worth watching
","I find the greatest assets of the film to be its total historic accuracy and complete realism. It is absolutely believable, some scenes are even hard to watch, but this is what it was like. The depiction of the moral decay that overwhelms doomed men and women is awesome in its cruel veracity. In other, I think that Bruno Ganz did a fantastic job in physically impersonating Hitler, but lacked in the oral interpretation (I watched the original German version). Also, I found some of the schizophrenic aspects of Hitler's character to be a little overblown, as well as the characterization of Eva Braun a little superficial. All in all though, a very good film worth sitting in for 2 1/2 hours.",8,2,6,8 April 2005
The Last King of Scotland," A Fantastic performance by Whitaker, but...
","Good, solid film with some excellent acting by Forest Whitaker (I totally agree with the Academy this time, his performance was well worthy of an Oscar).If the screenplay didn't sway away all too much from reality, and tried to use some more historical background and facts, the movie could have been much better though. If only the film had focused more on Idi Amin rather than the fictional Scottish doctor character who with his boyish looks and stupid behavior looked often completely out of place, highly unbelievable in the context of the film, and quite frankly, highly improbable too. Why do Hollywood movies about Africa seem to think that they must have a lead character who is white in them in order to succeed? How ridiculous...In the end, in spite of all its flaws, this was an enjoyable movie and I was even tempted to give it a slightly higher mark, but then I remembered that 'Hotel Rwanda' was so much better...",7,1,4,28 March 2007
Ray," This is to keep!
","Excellent, especially Jamie Foxx, who is breathtaking as Ray! It seems as if the man himself has come back from the grave! Definitely an Oscar performance.The Music soundtrack is of course great, and I liked the way the movie tried to portray Charles as realistically as possible, not in a typically Hollywoodian way, as a saint. Reminded me of Tina... I definitely disagree with Berardinelli this time. Yes, the story could have been developed a little better, and yes, the pace could have been a little faster, but all things considered this is a very good film. Something to keep.",8,1,2,2 April 2012
Rango," Good, but...
","It's hard for me to review this movie. I have mixed feelings about much of the film. Yes, the visual experience is fascinating, the movie has flashes of pure genius, some of the dialog is witty and entertaining, etc...But, then there is the nonsensical story, the absence of anything resembling a real plot, and... the sickeningly politically correct last part of the motion picture. I will not explain further what it is about in order to avoid any possible spoilers, but it is typically 'green dogooder' Hollywood, inserted into the movie without any plausible reason whatsoever other than to subtly impress upon the viewer a political opinion without seeming to be openly doing so. This is what I call 'brainwashing', and it is despicable, the worst sort of propaganda.So there you have it, certainly a good movie, but also one that leaves a (very) sour taste in the mouth (at least for me).",6,2,3,29 September 2015
The Queen," I was not impressed...
","I don't know. I was not as awed by this film as most of the critics where. Not that there is anything essentially wrong with it, but I simply did not find it to be anything special. Except for most of the acting performances. Not only Hellen Mirren who won the Oscar, but also Michael Sheen as a very believable Tony Blair, James Cromwell as Prince Philip and Alex Jennings as Prince Charles (in spite of almost no physical resemblance to the real Prince Charles). Other than these performances, I found nothing compelling about the film, there was nothing there that we didn't know already simply by having watched the news during those days in 1997.Maybe I expected too much, maybe I am just being difficult, but I was not impressed, not at all.P.S. One day after watching 'The Queen' I saw 'Spanglish'. What a difference! It was absolutely clear to me then how overblown 'The Queen' actually was by the media, the critics and the publicity. 'Spanglish', an almost completely anonymous film is vastly superior in almost all aspects that supposedly make 'The Queen' such a great movie, namely characterization and dialog. There is no comparison!",5,1,3,2 March 2009
Blow," Above average...
","Not a bad movie, above average, but nothing extraordinary, nothing that could even remotely be compared with for example, Scarface.In my opinion the main 'problem' with this motion picture is that Depp is never really believable as a hardened drug dealer, there is no way that the real George Jung was ever even remotely like that. The proof of this is in the last frame of the movie where we see the real George's face staring at us from the screen. At that precise moment we know: the real George Jung was very, very different, his face tells us that.On the other hand, Paul Reubens is excellent as Derek Foreal and the very good soundtrack is also worthy of mention. All in all, a good movie definitely worth watching, but also a movie that could have been much much better.",6,13,20,4 March 2007
Iron Man," A good movie (only) for kids...
","In my opinion, not nearly as good as everybody says. In a nutshell, a very good movie, but suitable only for kids (but rated PG13...?)Why, one would ask? Well, for starters because of its moronic plot and one-dimensional characters. Granted, I am not a fan of superhero pictures (I think that they are much better printed in comic books, where they belong), but having said that, there are some outstanding movies based on comic books out there that are far, far better than Iron Man (the Batman and Spiderman franchises come to mind). Iron Man's story is so simple, so childish, I am certain even many kids will find it uninteresting.But then again, what do I know? The majority of the critics and an overwhelming part of the viewing public loves the movie! It's probably just me again, I just don't get it... As usual.",6,2,3,8 May 2016
Casino Royale," Not bad, but this isn't Bond any more...
","Well, they have decided to 'modernize' Bond, to adapt the series to the new century..., and everybody seems to love it! Unfortunately for me, I don't.They have made the Bond character into something human, real, almost your regular every day guy. And (how very politically correct, in pace with the times) he is vulnerable, he has feelings, he falls in love and even resigns from MI-5...! (M's reactions to this - also very politically correct - is literally a motherly: 'Don't worry about it, we can talk about this later'... Give me a break! James Bond should not be a 'regular' human being, James Bond is a mythological animal, and it would have been so much better if they had kept it that way. At least for me. Even the girls are not what they used to be. Now they are all over 30, are called 'women' and have PhD's instead of bikinis! Once again, how very politically correct... What have we come to as a society if even James Bond has to be politically correct? Think about it. Isn't it sad?Not that this is a bad movie, because it isn't (even though it also has many shortcomings - for example, Montenegro looks more like MonteCarlo, while the reality in that young country couldn't be more different, at least for now), it's just that it isn't a Bond movie any more. A scene that illustrates this best is one in which at a certain point, when asked the proverbial question 'shaken or stirred?' Daniel Craig answers literally 'Do I look as though I give a damn?'. Call me a nostalgic, but no, this definitely isn't Bond any more.",6,5,8,2 May 2007
Toy Story 3," Excellent!

The story this time is much more involving, which is what separates it from the two previous movies of the series. This is story is much more interesting, emotionally involving, while the dialogs are punctuated with frequent witty one-liners. The video and audio are both also as good as you can expect them to be. Well done! Highly recommended for all ages.",8,0,1,5 June 2015
Identity," Average...
","Contrary to most, I didn't find this movie to be anything more than average.I do agree with Ebert when he says 'a movie that seems to be on autopilot for the first two acts and then reveals that it was not, with a third act that causes us to rethink everything that has gone before'. The problem is, he sees this as an asset to the film, something that makes it good, while I see in this the core problem of this motion picture. Namely, in my opinion, for the first two thirds this movie is only slightly better (due to a good cast of actors) than your average horror / slasher flick... Yes, then it makes it's 'intellectual twist' for the better, but that is not nearly enough to redeem it and raise it above average. All in all, nothing special.",5,2,5,11 October 2009
Munich," Politically Correct...
","I have to disagree with most of the critics. This film is not a masterpiece, but nothing more than a propaganda manifesto of political correctness, currently very much 'in vogue' in 'developped western societies'. I rarely mix politics and films, but considering the aim and message of this movie, I cannot help myself from doing so in this case. I will therefore refrain from commenting on the technical and artistic aspects of the film and concentrate on the essence, which is highly politicized (to avoid any misunderstandings, I would like to clarify I am not Jewish, nor do I have any affiliation whatsoever with Jews or Israel).This is a typical case of a film praised by all only because it has been made by a great director, and it carries a message almost everybody nowadays wants to hear: hear no evil, see no evil... It is far too simple to sit and preach peace on earth for all from a quiet place and at a safe distance, totally out of contact with reality, the harshness of the real world. Unfortunately, the reality is very much different from the one seen by looking out of a window of a multi-million dollar Villa in Hollywood. Life is a brutal game of survival; always has been, always will be. No matter how much we would like to think that the world is now a better place, that humans have evolved to being a non-aggressive, peace-loving species, the truth is nothing has ever changed since the dawn of time. We are still the same power-thirsty animals, fighting for dominance and survival. Only the means and the form of that fight have changed. We are fooling ourselves if we think that after the end of the cold war, now the world will quietly settle down and cuddle into an eternal period of universal peace. How blindsided can one get? There are wars everywhere, massacres perpetrated daily...Notwithstanding the end of the cold war, the Russians still like to think of themselves as a superpower, they still see themselves as the 'anti-western' power, they still fear us and hate us, nothing has changed. The Chinese, very much the same. Do we honestly think they are our friends? Or do we prefer to do so because it is good business? The 'Islamic nation' on the other hand, is a story to itself. Do we really think we can simply sit together with the fundamentalists and talk it over? 'Talk it over' with people whose major ambition is to blow themselves up in order to try to kill one of us? Do we really think that they will be content with any kind of agreement? It hurts to think that so many people can be so foolish to believe such nonsense nowadays. Have we already forgotten the scenes of jubilation on the 'arab street' after 9/11? Mark my words: they will not stop before either they destroy us, or we destroy them..., whether we like it or not!Freedom and peace are not a given, they have always come at a price. If we want to continue being free and to live in peace, we will have to fight for it. Just wishing for it to happen is not good enough! That is an important lesson we must never forget and remember to teach our children. This is why I consider the message that the film bears not only to be bad, incorrect or unrealistic; I consider it dangerous.",6,1,5,16 August 2006
Hart's War," Unrealistic to the very end...
","To me the movie was average, probably because I don't find it so mind shattering that it pictures racism in the US military during WW2. It was there, that is an accepted historic fact so I do not think the film should win too much praise for 'boldly going where no one has gone before'. The plot was OK in the beginning but after the first 30 minutes it started to become less and less believable. The life in the camp is unreal, the Germans, the German colonel, etc.The culmination comes (and there I agree with the critic) at the end when all of a sudden almost everybody is competing in order to be the first to be executed, to die as a hero. Then Bruce Willis suddenly returns in a sudden change of mind, just in time to save everybody by getting executed himself... Nonsense, this just doesn't happen.",6,7,7,18 March 2012
Sin City," Now, this is what I call an Art film with a capital 'A'
","I will be very blunt in my initial comment on this film: It is a Scandal that this film has been totally overlooked by the Academy. If ever there was a movie more deserving of an Oscar for the cinematography, make up, set decoration and special effects than Sin City, then I haven't seen it!The 'feel' of the film is absolutely extraordinary, the style incomparable, never seen before, totally out of this world (which is exactly the point). I don't give a 9 lightly, and if the screenplay had been up to par with the rest, this would have been a pure 10/10. This motion picture is pure cinematic art at it's best.My compliments to all involved!",9,0,0,28 March 2007
Gangs of New York," A waste of almost 180 min of celluloid...
","To me the film was a total flop. Sitting through almost three hours of this movie was not easy. For starters, the story is practically non-existent, especially for a film lasting almost 3 hours. It is overly simplistic, the dialogs are only basic, there is nothing of substance there. All this could have been easily made to fit into a 90-minute film and would probably have been much more effective. In addition, the characters, the set and the filming are more like a cartoon than a film trying to depict reality, totally unbelievable. If it wasn't for all the blood and butchery that is omni-present, one would think this is a 'cartoonesque' adaptation of an 18th century child novel aimed at semi-retarded kids. Finally, as mentioned above, there are far too many gory scenes of gratuitous violence (and I am really not one to shun violent scenes if they serve a purpose). All in all, I don't know what Scorcese had in mind when he was making this movie. To me it just doesn't make any sense at all.",3,4,11,9 January 2005
Happy Feet," Very good, but...
","'Happy Feet' could have been (should have been?) an all-time classic if it wasn't for the last 40 or-so minutes. Had the writer/director/producer stuck to the basics of the misfit-integrating-into-society part, and had accentuated this issue going a little deeper into it rather than trying to squeeze in an inappropriate environmentalist message which totally messes up the ending and leaves a sour taste in the spectators mouth, it would have been a great movie rather than just a good one.On the positive side, the cinematography and sound are phenomenal (the Academy should have taken notice here) and the computer animations too. The human acting (voices) where also excellent, especially Robin Williams and Brittany Murphy, who is also responsible for the vocals in a large number of awesome singing numbers. This girl might be a good actress, but I think she should have been a singer!All in all, very good entertainment but also a movie left with a lot of unrealized potential.",7,0,1,29 December 2007
Donnie Darko," I just don't get it!
","Well made movie, well directed, well acted, good soundtrack, etc. There is nothing terribly wrong with this film, but I just don't get it. I also 'don't get' why the majority of moviegoers rated this movie so highly...Maybe I have no 'sensibility' for such matters, or maybe the makers of this movie weren't sure themselves what they wanted to convey. Throughout the movie there are several occurrences which make no sense with the movie itself and confuse the viewer, then there are subplots started but never explained, and the very strange ending only adds to an overall sense of dismay. I just don't get it!",5,3,4,1 June 2015
The Bourne Supremacy," Another disappointment...
","The plot is non-existent, the film doesn't make any sense whatsoever... We never understand why things are happening the way they are, what are the motivations behind the characters' actions, etc. This is just your average action flick, absolutely filled with action for the sake of action!Regarding the casting, I can only repeat what I mentioned while commenting on 'The Bourne Identity': I have never, never seen a worst casting choice for a lead actor in an action thriller. If you can believe that Damon is a seasoned CIA black ops murderer, then you can believe anything! Another disappointment.",5,0,2,2 April 2012
Cinderella Man," Very, very good
","Ron Howard has done it again!What a great movie. I was ecstatic to see they can still make movies that move you nowadays! Realistic, heartbreaking, romantic, tragic while constantly filled with action at the same time.The acting was outstanding overall, but especially Russell Crowe, Renée Zellweger and Paul Giamatti in the lead roles deliver great performances. The camera is also fantastic, partly by doing a great job in immersing us into the atmosphere and 'feel' of the 1930-ies and then (and especially) for the authenticity of the boxing scenes. I have never seen boxing filmed any better; every punch literally hurt! If this cinematography does not deserve an Oscar, I do not know what does.All in all, great entertainment.",9,1,1,6 June 2006
The Island," Great potential, but...
","A great premise, some good questions posed on moral, ethics, and the future of mankind in general. Add to this a good plot, a believable love story and truly fantastic special f/x's (both audio and video), and you have all the ingredients for one great movie... But that's where the producers and the Hollywood establishment in general step in.., and most of what is good goes down the drain in the name of sales at the box office and/or 'political correctness'. It could have been a great movie, but for the exaggerated chases and the 'Hollywoodian' happy-end... What a pity, why do all movies nowadays have to obey the same worn out clichés?",7,0,0,30 October 2005
