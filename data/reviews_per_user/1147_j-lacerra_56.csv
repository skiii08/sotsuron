Walk the Line," Walk the Thin Line
","I watched and enjoyed this movie at home, from DVD. But, while watching, I was glad I had not seen it in the theater. Frankly, it was simply not captivating enough to hold my attention. This is odd, because in the true and larger sense of the word, I am a lifelong Johnny Cash fan, a FANATIC! The thin-voiced spastically moving performer depicted here would not have made a fanatic of me or anyone. Since Phoenix can't get believability when the character is on stage performing, he is bound to make Cash an uninteresting clod off stage. Nothing of the very special nature of Cash's talent comes through.The audition scene was embarrassing. No record producer would indulge this garage band singer another note after hearing him hack up the gospel songs he'd sung all his life. How do you make a mega-star like Johnny Cash seem to be a trivial jerk? Apparently, you hire Joachin Phoenix to play him. How do you make a lifetime of music seem a silly mistake? You get Phoenix to sing it.All this disappointment with Cash helps to point out the extremely high quality performance of Reese Witherspoon as June Carter. Her accents, manner, presence, and yes, her singing all add up to a boffo tour de force that even further diminishes Phoenix's futile attempt ape the icon.Dabbling with Jerry Lee Lewis, Elvis Presley, Roy Orbison, and mentioning Bob Dylan all fail to validate this actor's attempt at showing Cash in his natural origins. We never get to know the real man. And Phoenix sees to it that we don't even want to. I just hope those who are not familiar with the real Johnny go out and listen to the real stuff. 'Cause if they don't, and this is all they see and hear, they'll wonder what all the fuss was about.",7,2,4,22 April 2006
Miracle," A Miracle for Disney
","Don't let the fact that this is a Disney movie deter you from watching a thoroughly enjoyable and adult-level sports movie for two-plus hours. Kurt Russell does an excellent job portraying coach Herb Brooks as a complex and sometimes ruthless and inscrutable leader. Very UN-Disney-like indeed. I am not a hockey fan - in fact I dislike the game intensely - yet I enjoyed the well-crafted scenes of competitive team play. Knowing the outcome of the BIG GAME did not detract at all from the excitement and suspense surrounding it. Sort of like the suspense Ron Howard achieved in Apollo 13 (where we knew in advance the outcome, but were worried about and later relieved for our astronauts). A must-see for sports fans and non-fans alike.",8,42,50,13 May 2005
3:10 to Yuma," Three Hours Til Yuma?
","This basically could have been a good movie but that it stretches our belief at every turn. So much so that it becomes really absurd and, in the end, just plain too dumb for words.Christian Bale plays a down-on-his-luck rancher who happens upon a bloody robbery, and later identifies bandit chief Russell Crowe, and volunteers to help the authorities escort the criminal to the far off train station. Bale's character is a crack shot and an acrobatically tough customer for a man with only one foot! Crowe tries his best to corrupt Bale, but to no avail. The ever-thinning group plods on to the train station, with the help of Bale's son, apparently the Superboy of the rancher set.Crowe's gang is in pursuit in order to set him free. They are led by Ben Foster, excellent here in a variant of the Gene Wilder role in Blazing Saddles. Foster does a great job as a diminutive Doc Holiday-esq gunslinger who may have more than just gang loyalty for boss Crowe.The movie ends with an Old West version of The Gauntlet, in which every gun in town is firing at Bale, and missing. Then, incredibly, in one of the worst motion picture endings in memory, Bale is shot dead, Crowe pays off his gang's loyalty by killing each of them, turns himself in, and leaves, but not before summoning his horse to follow the train. The assumption being, I guess, that having impressed everyone with his goodness, he will again escape on the animal after the train goes round a turn.Well shot, well acted, poorly written twaddle.",5,2,5,20 July 2008
Wind River," Excellent
","While Wind River is on its surface a murder mystery/police procedural, it transcends these things due to an excellent tight script, first-rate performances, starkly beautiful visuals, and an approach that does not given in to worn out Hollywood tropes. Jeremy Renner is so believable as Cory as to make one forget there is any acting going on and to believe the character is the real deal. Elizabeth Olsen never once plays the vulnerable female card, and manages the tough cop role without falling into silly heroics or unrealistic butchdom. Of course, Graham Greene is the consummate pro. The story remains adult, and never falls prey to the super-imposed romance one might expect. All in all, an excellent motion picture by director Taylor Sheridan.",10,12,16,9 November 2018
I'm Not There," He's NOT There
","I am perhaps the biggest Dylan fan on the planet. I took this movie as an insult to his talent, his genius, and his legacy. Dylan is soiled by this movie. If anyone is unfamiliar with Dylan and sees only this, they will run for cover, missing the genuine treat of his achievements.Julianne Moore mimicking Joan Baez' interview from No Direction Home was an insult to Baez (and Scorsese). Christian Bale's talentless renditions of Dylan works was an insult to Dylan and me. And, sorry, I can't tolerate a dykelike Cate Blanchett (who I love) mugging her way about as Dylan. She looks no more like a man than ... Charo! They don't use Dylan's name in this slimy film; were they afraid of being sued for defamation? I need a shower.",1,32,47,11 October 2008
The Big Lebowski," A Total Waste of Time
","Browsing through the other reviews here on this movie, I am astounded to find that a seeming majority think it is some sort of masterpiece. I may be obtuse, but I found little to recommend it.Jeff Bridges does a credible job portraying 'The Dude', a shiftless wastrel obsessed with bowling and avoidance of responsibility. Despite his considerable talents and efforts, Bridges never quite succeeds in evoking any interest in this lame character from the viewer. John Goodman is obnoxious playing the John Goodman character, the aggressive supposedly lovable slob. Steve Buscemi is wasted as Donny, an apparent moron with attention span problems. Then we have Hollywood's most overrated actress, Julianne Moore, who assaults our eyes with her grotesque naked form right from the door. David Huddleston, usually a reliable character actor, is here reduced to a whiney old fart.The movie still had a shot. But the Coens decided that it would be nice to have no plot, no humor, and no compelling reason to watch the screen.This is the kind of movie that makes one desire to reach into the screen and just smack them! A thorough waste of time with apparently no redeeming qualities whatsoever.",1,27,76,3 January 2005
Star Trek," Star Drek
","I actually have no problem with Hollywood creating these empty action movies with an explosion every 2 seconds and sort of a mind-numbing MTV boom-boom mentality. I just wish they didn't label it Star Trek. This movie is many things, but Star Trek it is not. The ship is true to the original Enterprise, and that seems to be where the similarity to Star Trek ends. Oh, and the guy who plays the young Spock is good, as is Bruce Greenwood.This Jim Kirk is not a likable sort, nor is this Dr. McCoy, or this Sulu, Chekov, or Uhura. These Romulans seem to enjoy tattoos. Interesting.I was not predisposed to like this movie. And it did absolutely nothing to win me over. It actually irritated me to run into these plastic imitations of old friends (the Star Trek characters).I suppose the producers made a barrel of money here. But the movie is a steaming turd.",1,14,25,2 September 2010
Fight Club," Slight Club
","Having seen this movie over a year ago, all I can remember about it is thinking it one of the worst movies I have ever seen (and I've seen a LOT of movies). I was quite surprised to see it in the Top 250, and thought of so highly by reviewers on this site. It made so little an impression on me that I cannot remember one solitary scene or player in it, although I read here that Brad Pitt participated with someone called Ed Norton (Honeymooners?). All I remember is that it pained me to watch the whole thing, but I did. I don't know why. But just in case many of you are holding back your true dislike of this piece of trash because it is just sooo PC to like it, well now the ice is broken.There is no accounting for taste!",3,1,5,7 May 2005
Troy," Horsing Around With Troy
","Like the Trogan horse itself, this movie sort of sneaks into your psyche and helps you suspend your belief and enjoy. Oh, I feel for the outraged scholars out there who want a literal performance of the Iliad. But this is the 21st century and folks neither understand nor will tolerate the rather boring and incomprehensible devotion the ancients felt toward their deities. The film makers made the right choice and concentrated on human (sort of) characters, and human themes: love, war, grief, honor, cowardice, greed, etc.The film is visually stunning. For those who say good CGI is now routine, please look at the messes of the new King Kong, and the totally idiotic remake of Godzilla. These battle scenes may be inaccurate in costume or tactic, but they are visually well done.And then there is the acting. Well, Brad Pitt does a wonderful job playing THIS Achilles. The camera loves him and he has clearly worked very hard on conditioning and his movements. I thought him terrific, and I am not a big fan. The camera also loves Eric Bana; who dominates almost every scene he is in. Orlando Bloom is despicable as Paris, the seeming cause of all the trouble (although there are political shadings far beyond his silly abduction). Bloom is despicable in every role he is in, so the film makers cast well here. Kruger is quite the astonishing looking Helen, one does not notice if she acts. Peter O'Toole is the consummate professional as always, here in the role of the sympathetic yet ultimately foolish Priam. No one really does poorly in this picture.So, folks, get a grip! It's a movie! If you want the whole schmeer, read the Iliad, take a course, join a study group. Here, with this version of Troy, you'll get your nine bucks worth of pure movie entertainment!",9,3,5,19 January 2008
Juno," Junebugged
","Perhaps it is just me, but Ellen Page is a great actress only if her intention was to make her character superficial and irritating. The incessant stream of hipsterbabble that rolls off her supposedly 16-year-old tongue is a bit much to take, or believe. She finds she is pregnant and views it as if she had broken a nail (well, maybe two nails). The bewildered father of the unwanted child takes the news as if his girlfriend had developed a large pimple that wouldn't go away for awhile.Yes, there is a somewhat interesting story here at the core, but everyone is so busy being glibly hip that they do their level best to conceal it and deny us any true movie enjoyment.Jason Bateman and Jennifer Garner do a creditable job as the well-to-do potential adoptive couple, with a smoldering hostility underneath. But the real scene stealer here is J.K. Simmons as Juno's dad, looking like a middle-aged Dwight Eisenhower, and coming off very human and daddish. Again the writers and director do their level best to screw this character up, but Simmons perseveres.The movie features an extremely annoying soundtrack of cutesy-poo non-rhyming gibberish designed to sound hip and now. It also features one of the worst endings in recent memory. It teaches us that any behavior is OK, responsibility is overrated, and things will always work out if you're cool. How this oversweet pastry of a movie was nominated for Best Picture is a puzzle. Not terribly bad, just not overly good.",4,20,37,6 March 2008
The Prestige," Make It Disappear
","This well-mounted production is a study in waste. Waste of a great cast. Scarlett Johanssen is given nothing to do but look pretty and be mean. Her character is not developed enough for us to know why she is as treacherous as she is. Michael Caine is excellent and steals every scene he's in. But he is not in enough scenes to save the movie. Piper Perabo is not given enough screen time to establish her character before she is killed off.Hugh Jackman is wooden and mildly comical as one of the two obsessed competing magicians (looking very much like comic Joe Flahrety). Christian Bale does his usual imitation of a stick. These two seem to have taught David Bowie how to play a stick as well.The story should be engaging, but is not. It bores one with its trite little clumsy plot twists. Actual, the director could have saved some time and footage by just flashing 'PLOT TWIST' on the screen each time.The surprise ending (could have just flashed 'SURPRISE ENDING' on the screen) is no surprise. But it is a relief. At long last this turkey ends! Oh, yeah, and only we the audience know the real secret! How remarkable.I've given Prestige four stars; for its high production values and for Michael Caine.",4,1,4,21 December 2008
Hotel Rwanda," Schindler's Guestlist?
","I am a bit surprised that those who write here have not seen how this film is reminiscent of Schindler's List, but rightly portrayed as current and urgent, as opposed to the safety of a long gaze and reflection back in history. I am not a Don Cheadle fan, but if he continues to turn in performances like this (and 'Crash'), I may become one.The brutality and greed of chaotic modern Africa are aptly addressed here, and realities of circumstance make the main character's courage all the more palpable than, say, silly Hollywood action flicks might have us believe the nature of courage to be.The only reasons I did not give that tenth star were that I thought Nolte a bit long in the tooth for the role he was given, and the fact that many scenes are dark and hard to discern. I believe that both of these were intentional; the aging struggling colonel, and the sweaty dank feel of breaking news. But, I might have enjoyed it more if they would have been moderated in degree.",10,0,1,24 April 2006
Pan's Labyrinth," Deadly Dull, Deadly Stupid
","Filmed well, but darkly, Pan's Labyrinth is a nonsensical tale of a little girl's adventures through a fantasy world of grotesque creatures and places as she escapes the equally grotesque reality of her worldly situation. Ofelia is step-daughter to a sadistic captain of the guards of an area of Franco's Spain still under guerrilla threat of the residual partisan opposition. The fantasy elements of the movie are pointless and shockingly boring. They are full of unexplained sickening creatures, insects, fairies, and FX hamming.The stupid insurrection fleshes out scenes of the real world. But the picture is reasonably interesting when the Captain is pursuing his cruel regime and investigations. A servant and some others are sympathizers with the Resistance while working in the Captain's own household. Ofelia's pregnant mother is carrying the Captain's child. The Captain himself is compelling and is clearly no coward. The movie is at it's meager best when he is on screen.Why is the insurrection 'stupid'? Well, we know, of course, that the Franco regime survived and the insurrection did not. So, we cannot hope to see the rebels prevailing in the long run. This makes their cause and their actions meaningless.The movie commits the cardinal sin that a movie can commit: the death of a child by violence. Try though they might to dress that up with a scene of Ofelia's reunification with her (by that time dead) mother and natural father in the hereafter, the fact remains that this child has been killed.The movie is well-shot and well-acted. It is relentlessly dark and depressing. And worst of all, it makes no sense whatsoever. Nor is it interesting. Despite all the fantasy and harsh reality, this is basically an extremely overlong and boring movie. A true waste of two hours.",3,28,57,23 May 2010
Taxi Driver," Taxi Drivel
","I delayed for many, many years my watching of this film, and finally did so due to its reputation as a classic. I am not much of a Scorcese fan, and Taxi Driver merely reinforces that opinion. I found the movie to be boring and meandering. There were times when I wanted to just reach down DeNiro's throat and drag the words out; so inarticulate is his character (I don't blame the actor).The movie is relentlessly depressing, as the main character drives and walks through the seamy underbelly of society. And yet it is so boring that I was constantly looking at my watch, hoping it was close to being over.I gave three stars: one because it is the minimum, one for DeNiro's performance, and one for Foster's performance.Despite TD's hype, I cannot recommend it.",3,9,20,22 August 2010
Capote," The Truman No-Show
","This is one of the most boring movies I have ever seen that can still be extremely obnoxious and uninteresting at the same time. This, perhaps is its achievement. A well-mounted and expensive piece of crap.The main character, author Truman Capote, comes off as a self-applauding intellectual twit verging on flaming queen, albeit a talented one. Played by Hoffman with all the depth of two-line obituary, Capote leaves us wondering just what on earth he sees redeeming in this murderer. Hoffman resembles Capote, but does not sound like anything more than a lounge comic doing a poor impression.The movie is lovingly filmed with extreme attention to detail, and emulates The Shawshank Redemption right down to the tinkly piano notes and camera angles. The director clearly thinks that good cinema is found in actionless long shots, held for excruciatingly long periods of time.I must confess to having watched only 3/4 of the picture, not being able to withstand another moment of my life lost on this dreck and its completely uninteresting subject matter. Perhaps Mr. Capote was a brilliant writer (the movie pounds that down our throats), but as the subject of a movie he fails to excite. That is odd, as the real Truman Capote was rather fun to watch, animated and witty. This guy comes off as the gay reaper.I rated it a five for its good production values and cinematography.",5,3,4,3 May 2006
The Aviator," Billion Dollar Baby
","This is a truly lavish and wonderful movie about a large portion of the life of American original, Howard Hughes. I am not a big fan of Leonardo DiCaprio, but I must admit that here he does his subject proud. It is hard to imagine anyone else in this role; DiCaprio becomes Hughes, and, especially toward the close of the film, is an eerie Hughes double.The period settings and wardrobe are perfect to the least detail. The actual color used in the movie emulates color processes used during the times depicted. This type of loving handling is what we have come to expect of Scorcese, and he does not disappoint.The picture has a sterling and quite watchable supporting cast, all of whom, save one, perform wonderfully . Kate Beckinsale is a fine Ava Gardiner, Alec Baldwin is suavely evil as the insidious Juan Trippe, Alan Alda exudes slime as Sen. Brewster, and small appearances, almost cameos, by Brent Spiner, Willem Dafoe, Ian Holm, and others all bring home the class nature of this production.Only one failure in the the cast: the performance of Cate Blanchett as Katharine Hepburn. Blanchett handles Hepburn as ham-handedly as hammy. It is as if she never saw a Kate Hepburn movie or interview and had no knowledge at all of how Hepburn looked, sounded, or acted. One is relieved once Blanchett is off screen, not blemishing what is otherwise a great production.Like so many biopics, this one tells us little of Hughes' motivations or character. By and large, this omission does not prevent us from enjoying the movie. Hughes insanity is a bit overplayed and many of his accomplishments are overshadowed by the picture's obsession with his mental breakdown. The director even borrows a bit from A Beautiful Mind, inviting us to question whether certain characters Hughes sees on screen are really there.I give this picture 8 stars out of 10; it would have captured 9 but for Blanchett's embarrassing 'performance'.",8,0,0,5 June 2005
Léon: The Professional," Let's Have a Sequel!
","Last night I re-watched this wonderful movie for the seventh or eighth time. It still captures my attention and I sit rapt, awaiting every familiar bit, and the inevitable new things I will see. Jean Reno is GRReat, as is Gary Oldman and and Tony Aiello. But it is Natalie Portman who shines so brightly as to make one feel almost guilty in becoming so attached, if only cinematically, to a 12-year old girl. She exudes vulnerability, toughness, and yes, sexuality in ample measures.It occurs to me after looking at the current bland and boring Hollywood fare of remakes and sequels, that now is the time to pick up Mathilda's life in a sequel (let's call it 'Mathilda'). Now a young woman, out of school and perhaps in her own 'cleaning' business! I'd sure like to see her deal with Old Tony. Luc Besson must direct.Ah, but this makes too much sense. Hollywood would never go for it!!!",10,1,2,4 July 2005
American Psycho," Did Not Get It
","I guess I just did not get it. I did not realize this took place in the eighties, did not find any satire in it, did not find any humor in it, did not like or dislike the protagonist, and was bored much of the running time. Also, I was unsure of whether or not the main character was actually killing people or just imagining it. His name is Patrick Bateman - probably - but some doubt is supposed to be planted about that as well. But his secretary calls him by that name and other people seem to recognize him. He travels a New York City oddly devoid of people. At the end of the day, even as a psycho he is not that interesting, nor is anyone else in the film.",3,1,6,2 September 2019
The Men Who Stare at Goats," Mind-numbingly Boring!
","A mind-numbingly boring and dull movie full of sight gags that are not a bit funny and seem forced. Clooney plays Clooney, and Bridges does his Lebowski again (the only role I actually hated of Bridges'). After thirty minutes I could not keep my eyes open any longer and let this terrible movie go - and gladly. As far as I can tell, there is absolutely nothing to recommend this awful movie.",1,4,7,22 June 2019
No Country for Old Men," The Right Country for this Old Man
","This is a terrific movie, which has almost everything going for it: great performances, mesmerizing characters, suspense, gore, humor, philosophy, great cinematics. Josh Brolin is perfect as everyman given opportunity to rise above his lot in life, Javier Barden is the best conscienceless assassin seen in years, Tommy Lee Jones as the aging sheriff tired of his job and humanity in general, and even Woody Harrelson as a cock-sure tracker given his comeuppance.The story weaves a web around these characters, who are developed well enough for one to care about them, and, while not overly complex, demands your full attention. We are rooting for Moss to carry off his scheme to keep the money. We want to see Barden get his. We want Jones to do it. In this the Coen brothers do not let us have our way. They opt for an ending more consistent with some other classics that allow us to wonder.I will take a chance and make a few odd connections that most reviewers here seem to have missed. I think the Coens borrow from some other great movies in putting together this wonderful pic: Clearly, the Peckinpah influence of the Getaway (Steve McQueen and Ali McGraw) is overwhelming. In fact, the hotel in El Paso appears to be the very same one as that used in the Getaway (presided over by Dub Taylor then). And then it's out the window and into a beige pickup on the way to the border, just like the Getaway. The oft hidden bag of money is also a Getaway touch, as are the gun store visit and the fire outside the drugstore.The Terminator is present in many scenes and themes regarding the relentless assassin. Even the girl's mother contributing to tipping off the baddies about the whereabouts of the hero is right out of T1. See also the murder of the young cop in the station, and the hijacking of several cars, including a police cruiser.Of course, Scarface contributes the drug premise and one motel room massacre. And there is even a bit of Easy Rider in the windy desert dope scenes. Several nods to Crash: trying to save the injured person in a vehicle, and several well done auto collisions.With the Coen brother's skill and this cast, it is all woven into a unique and great movie. I accept the ending, but would have preferred another ... no biggie.",10,0,2,27 January 2008
District 9," Deep Six
","I watched this junk for about an hour before I finally gave up. I found no redeeming qualities whatsoever in the film. It plays like an unfunny gross-out comedy done on the cheap by amateurs. There is nothing here to keep you watching the screen. The aliens are actually first-rate CGI, but are completely wasted due to their sickening looks, slavish actions, and general lack of any apparent purpose than to shock and disgust. We may be shocked at first appearance, but that wears off in about 15 seconds. The disgust does not wear off.There does not seem to be any plot, any decent camera-work, any acting, any direction, any reason to care about anything on the screen. It is as if a middle school film project to create the worst movie possible was responsible for this mess. Actually, that insults middle-schoolers.I had been warned by every friend that saw this steaming pile of reptile excrement that it was absolutely awful. I decided to see for myself --- how awful it could be? My friends were actually very kind. Mankind has not yet invented adjectives to describe this level of terrible.Suffice it to say that no one in the movie even deserves mentioning, nor does the 'director', but knowing that Peter Jackson was in some way involved tells volumes, and the fact that critic Roger Ebert liked D9 clinches it. No wonder it is bad, really bad, really really really bad. Worse, the worst, horrible, despicable, nauseatingly bad. And I am being quite charitable!",1,32,64,16 September 2010
The Assassination of Jesse James by the Coward Robert Ford," The Assassination of Cinema in the Name of Jesse James
","It is truly amazing how a first rate cast and wonderful cinematography can combine to provide two and a half hours of absolute boredom, and contribute nothing to one's knowledge of the story which it is purportedly about. Not a moment of enjoyment exists in this film! First, none of the characters are discernible from each other, except for Jesse and Bob. This includes the women, who are easily confused with each other. Casey Affleck's Bob Ford is a sniveling dolt, with no redeeming qualities. Perhaps that is how it should be, but it makes for dull cinema. Affleck's annoying voice and lack of acting ability make it painful whenever he is on screen.We are never informed why anyone is doing anything or what that anything might be. We don't know why they are shooting each other, or why they are not shooting each other. It is the director who should be shot.Brad Pitt turns in the only performance of note, with Sam Shepard also making a brief attempt to help the movie with his taciturn presence. Neither Brad or Sam can save this moldering turkey. The movie is at least a half hour too long, maybe an hour (or maybe two and a half hours!).All I was thinking for the whole time I watched it was, Gee, I'm glad I didn't pay $10 to see this crap.",1,39,74,15 November 2008
The Pianist," The Hollow-caust
","As a lifelong fan of movies and of Roman Polanski, I approached this movie with high expectations. I have seen a number of Holocaust movies, of varying quality: the great Schindler's List, the very good Triumph of the Spirit, and the absolutely despicable Life is Beautiful to name a few. I would have to place The Pianist in the middle somewhere.This beautifully shot and produced film unfortunately has no plot or story. The main character is a bland person in every way, with the exception of his musical abilities. And it is clearly due to these musical abilities that others are constantly helping him in the movie. Certainly not due to his personality or character, of which he has none. Adrien Brody stumbles through this picture like some carrot-beaked scarecrow, evoking no compassion from the audience for his fate, a fate that is considerably more fortunate than millions of other Jews in the period.Polanski created a wonderfully visual and accurate portrait of the time and place, but Brody created a mere shadow of a human being as its central character.",6,1,6,3 August 2010
The Theory of Everything," Astrophysical Soap
","I would not for one moment take anything away from Eddie Redmayne's excellent performance as Stephen Hawking, or, for that matter Felicity Jones' fine performance as Hawking's first wife, Jane. But the movie presents their romance and struggle more as a well-mounted soap opera than as a biopic of one of the world's foremost scientists. It sometimes comes off as a cheesy disease-of-the-week movie tempered by a rather tawdry love triangle, or quadrangle ((Stephen:Jane:Choirmaster:Penthouse) If you want any knowledge of the professional life and works of Stephen Hawking, you will not find it here. And that is a shame. Because his professional life and work are infinitely more interesting than that of his occasional interest in eyeing a Penthouse magazine or her struggle with her libido. Medmayne deserved his Oscar. But the script let both him and Hawking (and the viewer) down.",7,1,2,24 December 2018
2012," Wild and Crazy Ride!
","Despite all the negative reviews here, or maybe because of them, I really enjoyed this movie. If I had not known what to expect I might not have enjoyed it so. But, going in, I was prepared for a suspend-your-disbelief special effects extravaganza. And that is what I got.When watching the Poseidon Adventure, did you really care about the individual stories and acting performances? Of course not! It was the action that kept you watching. Such is the case here. And all the coincidence that allowed the main characters to prevail over cataclysmic odds - well that's part of the deal.The special effects are excellent, and have really grown up since this director's terrible special effects in Independence Day, with its exploding matchstick White House. I only really spotted one glaring mistake: a dreadful mismatch of scale between the aircraft carrier John F. Kennedy and the White House. The ship is not six times the length of the building!Cusack was good, Peet was pretty, the kids were, well, kids. The scientist was honorable, as we know they all are (in the movies). This movie borrowed from many other disaster flicks, not least from the Poseidon Adventure and When Worlds Collide. It's just a lot of fun!",8,2,6,12 August 2010
I Am Legend," Recurring Legend
","Here we have Will Smith in a role previously played by Vincent Price, and Charlton Heston. Heston's turn in Omega Man is the one I remember well and must compare to. He was a swaggering macho techie Great White Hunter type; a scientist who apparently had discovered the cure and inoculated himself prior to the world's population either succumbing to the virus or mutating to leprous light-sensitive zombies.So, if we haven't seen Omega Man we really don't know why Smith's character is immune. This movie has several omissions of that nature, which is why I give it only 8 stars. I thought Smith carried the role extremely well. His acting is believable and provoking. He is macho, astute, and possibly going mad. In the scene where he is lured by a mannequin into a complex trap, we are left to wonder if the seemingly mindless mutants could have set it, or perhaps Neville (Smith) set it and they are simply using it to ambush him, or perhaps they merely mimic his techniques. It's an open question.Now, much has been said of the poor CG. But I must wonder if it is the CG that is poor or the filmmakers are just trying to tell us that the mutation endows its victims with superhuman strength and agility. What is their nutritional source. One might think it blood, or even wood. The movie is not specific, or cannot seem to decide. But these mutants are quite menacing.All in all, this was an enjoyable film. Smith's performance was great. Alice Braga is a mere shadow of her more famous aunt, but was adequate. And I give it second place honors in this franchise, after Omega Man. This is possibly because of Heston's several scenes mourning the loss of humanity in a darkened theater, watching Woodstock while sobbing for them and himself.",8,0,3,25 January 2008
The Hurt Locker," The Hurt Schlocker
","I was really looking forward to a great war movie, the Hurt Locker having won a pallet of Oscars, I figured I had just the right one. Boy was I wrong! The movie stunk from the opening moments in which one of the bomb squad team the movie follows is killed by a bomb that not only is detonated pretty far from him, but we see not a bit of shrapnel or debris come anywhere near the guy. The movie proceeds from one boring encounter with explosives and Iraquis to the next tedious and unbelievable encounter. The acting was just passable, but no member of the cast is even mildly interesting or compelling.Boring, and stretching belief at every turn, Hurt Locker continues to try to top itself in boring tedium as it progresses. This movie does not just want you to suspend your disbelief, it wants you to explode it at the door. Stupid and remorselessly trite situation after stupid and remorselessly trite situation are unfolded, but by this time the viewer is indifferent to its bland characters and their acts of foolishness.David Morse appears to have what amounts to a cameo as a loony American colonel, the obligatory ditsy and unfeeling brass that Hollywood feels obliged to insert in every war movie depicting Americans. Robert Duvall was infinitely better with his Lt. Col. Kilgore in Apocalypse Now.With about 40 minutes left to run, I shut this crap off. I didn't care what happened to any of the characters, nor did I care how it ended. It has no real story, so I would not have to wonder how a story terminates.What the heck happened to Oscar? This award used to mean something, but lavishing so many on this piece of dung devalues Oscar beyond redemption, IMO. A real piece of trash!",1,8,13,15 January 2011
The Curious Case of Benjamin Button," Benjamin Gump
","This is a movie with a kind of hokey premise: a man whose life cycle is reversed, being born old and getting younger. The production values are as high as can be possibly achieved, and the acting by all the players, both starring and supporting, is excellent. The movie 'feels' like Forrest Gump in many ways. The hummingbird is the feather, the frame story being in essence narrated by a major character, love passing in and out of the player's lives, encounters with historical events, and on and on.CCBB tells its story without humor, but humor is not really called for, and would no doubt be out of place. Neither is it a tragedy, as one of its themes, that of life running its course, regardless of which aging direction, is not tragic, but merely inevitable. It is a great film visually. The encounter between the tugboat and the U-boat is wonderfully done, as are all the period aspects of the film.Brad Pitt, a favorite of mine, gives an even and convincing, yet understated performance as the title character. He is clearly well-directed and up to the task without any hint of hamming or emoting. Cate Blanchett is excellent, as usual, as is Tilda Swinton. But despite individually excellent performances, the movie is cohesive and a pleasure to watch.I defend the long length of the film on the grounds that a)it seemed to fly by, and b)I did not want it to end. Highly recommended!",10,1,3,10 August 2010
Children of Men," What Was This About?
","Just finished watching this movie and am astounded at the fact that I have no idea what it was about, what was happening, or why I should care. Is it about the mysterious world-wide infertility? Well, it does not seem to be, even though that theme is established, it does not seem to bear on the (non-existent) plot.Who are the various groups incessantly shooting at each other? What are their motivations? The movie gives us not a clue! And, is this not the easiest childbirth in recorded history? What is the significance of the baby? Who knows! The movie never even implies what will happen once the main character's escape is achieved.Acting: There isn't any. Even old pro Michael Caine is really just doing Michael Caine. It just so happens that any Michael Caine is a relief in this depressing and inept chase movie. Hollywood's most over-rated actress, Julianne Moore, graces the picture for a short time, until she is mercifully assassinated. Clive Owen does not act, but rather wanders through the story trying to smoke a complete cigarette and have a swig of whiskey. If Mr. Owen has any acting chops, this script effectively prevents him from showing them.Visuals: The picture is unrelentingly dark, dirty, and depressing.I have no idea what this picture was about, and it provides no incentive whatsoever to find out. Avoid this one!",1,11,20,6 March 2009
Jerry Maguire," What's it all about, Jerry?
","Jerry Maguire is a movie about a sports agent who tries to go it alone by injecting heart into his relationship with his clients. To do this he needs fewer clients. His employer complies by firing him for his 'subversive' ideas. The title character, played by Tom Cruise, is not the most sympathetic of guys, and Cruise does not seem to know how to play him. He alternates from sentimental calm to over the top wild.Cruise's remaining client, a footballer played by Cuba Gooding, Jr., is an unlikeable and also over the top character. Gooding, Jr. plays him as a greed-driven, wild and noisy moron-jock. Gooding, Jr. is actually quite repulsive here, extremely annoying when on the screen (Oscar for what?).I am not a football fan (don't even understand it), so the scenes of the game were no boost for me. I do know enough to notice that Gooding, Jr. seems way too small to play a pro. It is hard to understand what this story is about, and the movie does nothing to clue us in. I found Jerry Maguire to be marginally entertaining, mostly due to Renee Zellweger and a host of cameos by the likes of Beau Bridges, Eric Stoltz, etc. JM is worth a look on a rainy Sunday afternoon when there is nothing better available and no game on.",6,1,2,16 June 2010
Paranormal Activity," Gold Medal Dreadful!
","Far from the promise of its puzzling hype, Paranormal Activity is not scary, suspenseful, or even particularly interesting. It's just a really bad movie, boring us to near death for 1.5 hours (seemed like 4), watching a rather unpleasant couple bicker and banter in front of a nausea-inducing hand-held camera . Since I had an old gift card for the admission, I could sit back and watch a truly rare example of pointless and bad cinema.This movie was quite funny in parts, although I doubt the makers intended to keep the audience laughing, as the one in my theater did throughout the picture. The fairly annoying main characters mouth the humdrum script unenthusiastically, never managing an iota of development, and without establishing a modicum of concern for their fate, which is fairly obvious early in the game. The ending gives a small amount of pleasure in that one of these annoying people is dispatched. From this event comes my second star.I can only recommend Paranormal Activity to those interested in seeing the object of an enormous scam upon film lovers. Don't believe the hype!",2,15,29,30 October 2009
The Dark Knight," Dark Nought
","I rented this movie to see Heath Ledger's Oscar-winning performance. I endured about an hour of this dreck, and, finding nothing compelling in Ledger's work (or anyone else's), turned it off before my mind turned to jelly. Admittedly, the film is well-produced, if somewhat dark and foreboding. I would have continued watching if the film was less stilted, and took itself a bit less seriously, campy and ridiculous as the material intrinsically is. But it does not go for laughs, and therefore becomes laughable.I found Christian Bale annoying, as usual, and was surprised at just how annoying Maggie Gyllenhaal (with whom I was not familiar) came across. One word kept pummeling my consciousness as I watched: STUPID! But I guess these kinds of flicks thrive on stupid. So, despite the big budget, big names, expensive CGI, positive reviews, and all-around high production values, there is still no remedy for stupid.Miss it and save your brain cells.",3,5,9,18 September 2010
Life Is Beautiful," Robin Williams Where Are You?
","This is really two movies: the first an awful slapstick comedy, the second an insulting fantasy.In the first half we are treated to Roberto Begnini (whatever) doing a really bad Italian Robin Williams impression. Boring us with poor comic timing, annoying screen presence, and thoroughly obnoxious rapid-fire dialog that just grates on one's nerves. His clown-like appearance only emphasizing how unfunny he really is. At this point I was ready to turn it off. But lo and behold, the movie then totally shifts into some sort of Italian Hogan's Heros (not to be confused with Stalag 17).We are treated to the mystifying insistence of the wife, apparently a non-Jew, demanding going to the concentration camp where her husband and son are being taken. Guido, the main character, mugs and clowns unmolested all around the camp, which is oddly squeaky clean. He manages to caper about, while semi-hiding his small son, and only has to carry an endless supply of obviously fake anvils from point A to point B.This is not a concentration camp, not a work camp, it's more a summer camp. Everyone plays hard, but stays clean and reasonably well fed. This is a bad movie. Because its funny parts are not funny, its gritty parts are not gritty, and it demands no emotional connection to its poorly acted characters.Oscar? Puleeze!!!",2,6,15,16 May 2008
Zombieland," Dreadful!
","Was there really a reason to make this steaming pile of zombie-doo? Here is a movie that is consistently disgusting while providing no laughs or reasons to continue watching. The character of Columbus is really annoying, but no more so than the usually talented Abigail Breslin, whose despicable ignorant teen character should be smacked. The Tallahassee character has become what Woody Harrelson does in movies nowadays, and it gets less tolerable each outing. Bill Murray's long cameo was no less disgusting and no less dreadful than the rest of this disgusting and dreadful movie. Glad I did not pay to see this stinking wreck.I should have known better than to watch a movie that Roger Ebert liked. After watching about half of this mess I really felt like I needed a long shower. Avoid Zombieland at all costs!",1,4,12,19 August 2010
The Departed," The Disappointed
","Despite all the hype, the Oscars, and the good reviews on this site, I found the Departed a great disappointment. The story never for one moment captured my interest. There was not one character that I cared what happened to. And, as it seemed that most the actors were doing their jobs quite well, I assumed it was either story or direction that was the problem with the movie, or maybe both.I found that the Departed suffers from Tough Talkitis. That is when all the characters speak to each other with such tough, rude, arrogant attitudes, it becomes unreal (like a cop show on Fox). Why? Because no people anywhere interact with each other that way in real life. It's a synthetic movie-acting manner that actors take on to project toughness into their roles. It is too fake.DiCaprio and Damon do reasonably well in their over-tough parts, DiCaprio especially. Sheen is restrained. Wahlberg is particularly annoying as the police sergeant who never is for one moment human. He is smug and coarse. No doubt the director shaped that characterization. Worse than all is the outrageous hamming of Nicholson, a lifelong favorite of mine. I never believed him for a second in this role as some sort of serious Joker gangster. Alec Baldwin is very good in one of his small roles, which he seems to specialize in these days.The story is humdrum and boring. I began looking at my watch about 15 minutes into this epic. There is no humor, even less character development, annoying side shows (the shrink girlfriend), and no real tension in the tale. After one hour and forty-five minutes of this, I realized that I did not care about what happened to any of these characters, nor did I care how the 'story' turned out. So I shut it off.Three stars for a good try (stretching it!).",3,9,16,25 November 2008
Nick and Norah's Infinite Playlist," Meh!
","This is not a bad teen movie if you can get past the two unattractive leads who have no chemistry together at all. These New York teens apparently have an endless supply of money to propel them around that disgusting city without end, seeking some stupid reclusive band at an unknown location. The supporting players are all non-entities, characters who never gel. The story is skectchy at best and there is little in the way of closure. All in all, one to miss.",3,0,0,23 July 2019
There Will Be Blood," It Will Be Over (Someday)
","The stars are for Daniel Day-Lewis' excellent performance, and for the captivating cinematography. There is essentially no story.The movie meanders on about the creation of an oil prospecting business and the colorless men who form it. We have Plainview, the Day-Lewis character. A focused but depraved drunkard who is a crackerjack wildcatter and businessman. There is nothing to like about Plainview, nor is he very interesting.The young preacher, Eli, who apparently never ages past his teens, and is about as obnoxious as can be. A stranger who claims to be Plainview's lackluster brother turns out to be a fraud, as is the handicapped 'son', albeit a more tolerable soul.The score or soundtrack seems truly inappropriate and overbearing at times, and some scenes are allowed to go on long past their relevance. The story, if it can be said to actually be a story, goes nowhere for hours, and then on to one of the most absurd endings seen in a major movie.Disappointing!",5,3,7,27 February 2009
Die Hard with a Vengeance," Died Hard: What a Clunker!
","After reading some of the enthusiastic reviews on this site, I was looking forward to watching this picture tonight. As it turns out, this clunker is not even in the same league with the first of the series, and is not even half as good as the second, which was itself an irretrievable clunker.Here we have Willis clunking (sorry about the repetition, but variations of this word keep coming to mind) through the role of the remains of John McClane, Jackson an argumentative whiney racist, and Jeremy Irons smirking the part of the inevitable criminal mastermind.If you enjoy the game of guessing what the next plot turn is going to be, you'll find no challenges here. The only unpredictable element of this movie is how bad it can get. There is no chemistry between Willis and Jackson, no interesting bad guys, no diverting back story, and no humor. Oh, the action scenes are boring and the pacing is choppy. One to avoid.",1,4,15,8 June 2008
American Gangster," American Boom Mike
","This is a difficult movie to review. It is such a panorama that there are bound to be good and bad parts, good and bad performances. But first, there must be Razzies going to the Director and the Boom Mike Man, and maybe the film editor. The boom mike appears so prominently and so often in this picture that a regular laugh went up from the audience in the theater I was in each time it appeared! Now, this in not some college film school project ... this is Ridley Scott for crying out loud! Both leads did a creditable job, but poor Russell Crowe's character is so annoying that one winced each time the movie switched to him. He also gets in a gratuitous sex scene with his pretty young lawyer that actually detracts from the movie. Denzel carries aloofness to new heights with his stoic portrayal of Frank Lucas. But he is effective, where Crowe could not do a thing to help his Richie Roberts.The only time we are reminded of Lucas' humanity is when he inexplicably shows an attraction to Eva, whom he later marries, played by the somewhat homely Lymari Nadal. Fortunately, Ms. Nadal is not asked to deliver too many lines, but to just stand around and look pretty; she is capable of neither.Josh Brolin steals every scene he is in, he has here a sinister screen presence, and we need to see more of him. Armand Assante tries vainly to mimic a Mafia don. Ruby Dee annoyingly and cloyingly turns in the obligatory unknowing gangster's mother routine. Cuba Gooding Jr does what he can with the 20 or so seconds he is on screen (actually, the boom mike got more screen time).Yet, despite all of the above, the aggregate turns out to be a pretty fair movie, albeit about 30 minutes too long. It's a tough call, but I would advise waiting for the DVD, as it pales in comparison with similar movies of this genre, such as Scarface or King of New York.",4,3,5,1 December 2007
Hancock," Super-Comic-Tragic Smith
","I do not like superhero movies, and avoid them like the plague. I do like Will Smith, and went to see Hancock figuring Smith would have some spin to add to the genre to make it worthwhile. I was right. This is a very risky venture for Smith and Peter Berg. Basically the ideas and realizations of 'SUPERHERO' are dissected and studied, while at the same time the movie is entertaining us with cinematic skill.Smith is dead-on with his uncaring and probably self-pitying super guy, who is also not particularly skilled at his role and is often drunk. It sort of examines the question (one I've always related to Superman) of if you can't feel anything bad then you also can't feel anything good, right? Where is the pleasure? Hancock also examines a host of other superhero issues, such as how can a superhero shave? It makes sense that when one of these last remaining super-folks (Charlize Theron is the other) get together, their powers wane. How else could they enjoy each other, love each other? Of course, this is where they are vulnerable and also where this super-comedy becomes a super-tragedy.There is so much beneath the surface of this picture that it is not really a big superhero extravaganza at heart, but it capably entertains on that level. Congrats to Will Smith and Peter Berg for this already unappreciated and misunderstood gem.",9,0,1,14 July 2008
Ray," Tell Me, What I Say?
","This lavish and overlong story of the (arguably) most productive portion of R & B legend Ray Charles' life scores in a big way on many levels. A top flight almost Oscar-worthy performance by Jamie Foxx in the title role, perfect period settings and a good feel for those times, and a totally unbiased view of the subject.On the minus side, the music comes off a bit flat, and the picture is, as stated above, too long; perhaps by about one-half hour. There is also an absence of any memorable supporting players or performances. In fact the two women in Charles' life, his wife and his mistress, are so similar as to be hard to distinguish at times. The very watchable Bokeem Woodbine is seriously underutilized (again!).Charles himself is not examined in any great detail. We are told nothing of his creative processes, but are allowed to witness his business sense, in which he is loyal to no one and nothing but the almighty dollar; sensible but not sensitive. Charles is seen not to have any friends. We are shown how his sainted mother made him tough, a cruel regimen that would be the envy of any Marine Corps DI.The best thing this movie offers is Foxx's performance and its unerring feel for the times in which it takes place. A worthwhile watch for any evening.",3,1,8,10 May 2005
The Good Shepherd," The Good Damon
","This is a complex and demanding movie. The twists and turns of the plot and events are very hard to follow, making it seek your undivided attention. It succeeds in gaining that attention through high production values and excellent acting. And never slipping into anything close to Bondian glamorization of the intelligence business.Matt Damon is first-rate as Edward Wilson, the main character, and almost all of the supporting players do wonderfully. William Hurt, Joe Pesci, Robert DeNiro, John Torturro, and Timothy Hutton are great, but without a lot of screen time. Names escape me, but the actors who play Laura, Edward, Jr.,the English spies, and all the Soviet operatives are excellent.Like the true intelligence game, not all mini-plots are resolved and some are incomprehensible. Somehow, this adds to the appeal of the movie.I gave the picture 9 out of 10 stars due to the miscast and flat performance of Angelina Jolie, who manages to be unattractive and barely professional in her portrayal of Margaret Wilson. Also, it is unclear as to why Edward never questions his paternity of her child, as she is clearly promiscuous and bent on entrapment.A must-see!",9,1,3,21 November 2008
The Terminal," Squirminal
","This is clearly one of the worst movies you will ever have the misfortune to see that stars a masterful actor (Tom Hanks) and was turned out by a respected and fantastically successful director (Steven Spielberg).Here the ridiculous premise is populated with the usual suspects: government officials that are either evil, incompetent, or both; workers who are just too stupid to be believed; spoiled and uncaring Americans. The only exception is the pretty immigration clerk (someone Saltana), whose pretty brightness shines through Spielberg's attempt to make her a mindless bureaucrat. The Indian janitor is just annoying in his stupid suspiciousness, and his luggage and food handling buddies make Cro-Magnons seem like geniuses.No, not a single character to like or identify with. Even Hanks, at his skillful best, cannot breath any sympathy into the character of the moronic Navorsky.Why, when the Feds find Navorsky cannot understand English do they communicate with him exclusively in that language? Why are they trying to starve him into breaking the law? Why was Catherine Zeta-Jones even in the picture? Why is every person walking through the airport so uniformly ignorant? Does Spielberg really think so poorly of his fellow Americans? After the first five minutes, I was looking at my watch and wondering if the movie was ever going to end. I squirmed through the entire first hour and finally said to myself, I don't care about any of these people, and life is too darn short to waste on this piece of garbage!",1,8,17,27 January 2005
Music and Lyrics," Music, Lyrics, and Lots of Smiles
","This familiar romcom with music does not depart from formula in any major way. However, the two leads and supporting players turn it into something quite a bit above and beyond the usual. Hugh Grant is at his well-timed comedic best as the once-famous pop star, delivering his barbs with understated Brit skill. Drew Barrymore, playing the fledgling lyricist, comes across endearingly klutzy and manic, but in the manner of a real person who demands attention. The chemistry between these two is obvious and strong. It is this that supports the premise that they really do care for each other and are right for each other. You root for them right away.Backing them up is Brad Garrett as Grant's manager, playing it as both a good friend and nice guy. Haley Bennett as the sexy pubescent pop star, a la Shakirah, is the perfectly oblique foil for the leads and also serves up some eye candy in her flawless portrayal of a pop diva.No, its not Citizen Kane, or even close. But Music and Lyrics provides a feel-good 95 minutes of escapist charm and pleasant enjoyment.",9,0,0,20 February 2010
The Silence of the Lambs," Wonderful
","This is a wonderful movie. So well acted, well constructed, and perfectly directed that it is a joy to watch over and over again. Jodie Foster, Scott Glenn, and Anthony Hopkins are all excellent, as is Ted Levine and all of the supporting players. That said, I must also say that I was never even slightly disturbed by the character of Hannibal Lector or Hopkins' portrayal of him. Actually, Lechter's character is the only point in the movie that I felt leaned just a bit to unbelievability and silliness. Fortunately, Hopkins is such a good actor that he manages to pull it off without being laughable. Great movie. See it!",10,0,0,9 May 2019
Vicky Cristina Barcelona," Where's the Beef?
","I had very high hopes for this movie. Directed and written by Woody Allen, starring some of my favorite actors, Javier Bardem and Scarlett Johansson, and located in exotic Barcelona, how could it miss? It almost doesn't miss at all. But, ultimately, it fails in a number of ways.First, labeled as a romantic comedy, it is in no way funny. And it is not particularly heart-warming to make up for its lack of humor. It is also not dramatic. While the characters are charming and attractive, they do not connect with the viewer at all. There is essentially no story, and there is absolutely no ending. Everyone just goes away, holiday over, to reluctantly live their real lives. Here, I agree with Allen, VCB is a sad movie.Javier Bardem is excellent in his role as the artist-love interest of almost everyone. His understated performance is quite compelling. Scarlett Johansson is very good as the confused and vivacious Christina. Rebecca Hall does not convince as the tortured lover married to another. She simply is not very interesting.I continue to fail to see the cinema world's fascination with Penelope Cruz. Moderately attractive in an urchin sort of way, she evokes only annoyance when she is on screen. But, I am not sure if that is due to the VCB non-story with Allen's direction (which is otherwise very sure-footed here), or to her alone; I always seem to have that annoyed reaction to her. An Oscar for what!? The film is beautiful, Allen's Spain is very photogenic, and the music is very well-chosen. But, at the end of the movie, I just sort of asked myself, 'Why did I watch this?' It will neither hurt nor please you to view this pic. Just don't expect much more than tourist eye-candy.",6,2,6,19 January 2010
Kagemusha," Stunning!
","This fantastic Kurosawa effort finds a lowly social outcast playing double to a great and beloved warlord. The director's scene composition is wonderful and his use of color is absolutely stunning. The opening scene of the warlord, his brother, and the double, or Kagamusha (Shadow Warrior) offers a clinic on compositional excellence and acting nuance. In this scene also lies embedded one of the films minor (and seemingly unavoidable) problems: a difficulty in telling the characters apart.As can be seen from my high rating of the film, this review is not by any means a pan of the movie. However, I would like to examine the few fine points that prevented it from receiving that tenth star.As stated above, there is a difficulty, at least for these American eyes, of telling who is who on screen, making the story hard to follow.Further, it is never explained as to WHY Lord Shingen wants his death kept secret (and the double used) for three years. The three years is not long enough for his heir to reach maturity. Nor is it adequate to educate his passed-over son to be a wise regent.In the end, it is not apparent as to why the Takeda engage in an ultimate battle with the most idiotic and suicidal attack plan possible.On a minor note, the camera dwells too long on the death throes of cavalry horses.All in all, a great feast for the eyes and test of the perception of the viewer. The story is at once empty and timeless, with a premise that holds promise for other treatments. Perhaps this is why I also love Moon Over Parador",9,0,2,9 September 2005
Heat," Boring
","I found this movie to be extremely unbelievable and boring. I did not for a minute believe that either the crooks or the police were as sharp as portrayed here. What was even more boring was the women, who merely slowed down and dragged out an already slow and overlong movie. I am not a big DeNiro fan, but I think he comes off best in this movie. Pacino is over the top, Kilmer is a stick, all the black actors are caricatures, and Jon Voight is fairly decent. I must qualify my remarks by admitting that I have not finished the movie. I stopped it with about 45 minutes to go. I am not sure if I will go back to it or not. If not, it will not bother me a bit.",4,3,11,16 October 2018
300," Dreadful
","300 is about as close to the actual story of the valiant 300 Spartans as a video game is to real life. Its incessant slo-mo and flowing robes, hair, blood, and fire is distracting from the story. But, no matter, there is no story beyond all that. We are treated to sabre-toothed wolves, a bridled charging rhinoceros, war elephants, and a giant Xerxes who is way too enrapt with piercings and chains.The acting is not a problem, as there is none. Just various players posing their bulging muscles and mindless arrogant defiance. For some reason, the film places black actors in some of the more villainous roles on the Persian side, so the lily-white Spartans can slaughter them.The fast-mo/slo-mo CGI encrusted battle scenes, where blood flies freely in all directions, are oddly uncompelling, even boring. The movie does play out like a video game being played by someone else (as another reviewer has said), and is not nearly as interesting. Every opportunity is taken to reveal female anatomy, apparently for tittering sake.I was quite shocked as to the low threshold this movies aspires to; I would say the 'tween' boy crowd was the target. If you are over thirteen, find a book on this conflict and read the real thing. 300 will not show you anything but the lowest hip-hop history of an ancient gang fight in the dark.",1,3,8,18 May 2010
The Thin Red Line," Retreat!
","When embarking to watch a film with the reputation and star power this one purports to employ, you expect to enjoy, or at least respect it. So, one questions oneself when viewing and absolutely abhorring the picture - there must be something wrong with ME. Not so, friends. The movie is just dreadful! How can this be? A movie boasting Sean Penn, John Travolta, Nick Nolte, John Cusak, George Clooney, Woody Harrelson, and a host of others should be good, right? Well, one way to ruin it is to have most of this power cast appear on screen in little more than cameos. Another is to have no script or coherent story. Then, have nearly all the characters either appear as trembling hysterical cowards, or carrying out insane heroics. Also, use plenty of pseudo-profound narrations and express lots of anti-war sentiments. For good measure, throw in many silent flashback scenes of one GI intimately interacting with his attractive and compliant wife.And when you do have dialog, make it inane and entirely nonsensical (Sgt: 'I'm gonna make you a stretcher-bearer.' Soldier: 'I can take anything you can throw at me.' --- Huh?) You should also have the 'tropical' terrain look like the hay-fields of Iowa.The Thin Red Line is a tapestry of snooty artsy intentions and battle-babble that runs on seemingly longer than the Guadalcanal campaign itself, and is no less painful to endure. I am more than halfway through it, and I am withdrawing from this beachhead and leaving it to its occupiers. Be kind to yourself and skip this one altogether!",1,7,13,4 June 2010
Coach Carter," To Sir With Hoosiers
","Some reviewer here wrote that this movie was not about basketball, but about discipline, respect, etc. Well, I got news for ya, it's about basketball! Samuel L. Jackson, despite his considerable gifts, is no Sidney Poitier. Nor is he a Gene Hackman. Yet, this movie combines 'To Sir With Love' with 'Hoosiers' with blatant banditry. Jackson is never quite sympathetic enough, quite human enough, for the viewer to care about, and the boys on the team come off like a gang of thug wannabees.The movie seems to play fast and loose with time. Grades are brought up in, apparently, a day or so, thousands of push-ups are done in brief hours. There is a tawdry back-story about the inevitable pregnancy of a player's girlfriend, idiotic and unreasonable parents and school officials (Carter bears a lot of resemblance to Joe Clark, 'Lean On Me'). There was (for me) a lot of difficulty telling the boys apart or connecting them with their names.An irritating undercurrent in this movie is the understanding that one one either goes to college or to prison. There is apparently no room in this society for plumbers, electricians, chefs, soldiers, ... just grads and inmates.All in all, this is not a terrible movie. However, had I paid $9.00 to see it in a theater, I'd have felt robbed.",4,3,7,10 March 2007
Slumdog Millionaire," Slam Dunk Millionaire
","Beautifully shot and composed, this fast moving tale is also very well-acted by players unfamiliar to Americans. Distilled, the script is patently simple and has been done many times. But, it is the treatment here that makes SM different and compelling. Danny Boyle handles his directing chores to turn in a tightly woven story of rags-to-rags-to-riches.The child actors are wonderful and expressive. The adult Jamal, played by Dev Patel, comes off a little wooden. Freida Pinto as the adult Latika does a bit better, but all she is really asked to do is look beautiful, which she does effortlessly.This movie is relentlessly depressing, living in a world of a nearly sub-human subsistence struggle. India is presented as a filthy, corrupt, and thoroughly disgusting place; one spends much of the movie thanking God for allowing you to not have been born there. There is the occasional inappropriate background song. And there are some elements that simply do not work, such as the child diving into a pit of excrement and then obtaining a celebrity's autograph. For these things, I gave it nine rather than ten stars.Well worth a viewing.",9,0,6,13 June 2009
The Runaways," Kristen & Dakota Run Away With It
","I must admit that I was not aware of the girl group, the Runaways, before hearing about this movie. However, I was very familiar with Joan Jett. The movie's two young stars are both excellent in their roles, and I can tell that Kristen especially nailed Jett. Dakota's portrayal of Cherie may have nailed it, but I am not in a position to know for sure. Kristen and Dakota are both child stars who are now beginning to make their names as adults (or close). Both clearly have the chops.Stewart, a special favorite of mine, need not constantly be associated with the Twilight movies, as she is creating a body of work that far surpasses that type of role. It is time to stop being surprised when Kristen Stewart turns in a top-notch performance -- top-notch is now the norm for this talented actress.The Runaways does suffer from a routine 'rock idol' script, and in my opinion, concentrates too heavily on the Cherie character. I'd have given Stewart more lines and screen time. Hence, my nine instead of ten stars.",9,2,6,24 September 2010
The Soloist," Not a Duet
","First thing, let's get out of the way the alleged genius of Jamie Foxx. This is the second time we see Foxx playing a gifted musician with an affliction. As Ray (Charles), Foxx was barely adequate. Here, as the mentally challenged Nathaniel Ayers, he is almost just annoying. Foxx makes the movie frustrating by engendering not one iota of caring or sympathy for his character. He also has virtually no chemistry at all with his co-star, Robert Downey, Jr.Downey, Jr. does a fine job with the character of Steve Lopez, a newsman trying to help Foxx, while using him in a series of articles. Downey steals every scene he is in, which is no small feat, as he is not the 'extraordinary' character here. Alas, Downey cannot carry this picture alone. And, since there is no real progress in Nathaniel Ayers' life or condition, the movie drags and depresses.Adding to the depression is the long graphic looks at the plight of LA's homeless, with the unspoken caveat that their lot will not improve either. Here, we are slumming, as Downey is, but with less incentive to do so. Oddly, if perhaps metaphorically, the director has Downey fall in urine twice during the movie! All in all, without any explanation of schizophrenia, without any information as to how Ayers developed it, and without any upbeat tales of Ayers' overcoming (or just contending with) it, the movie is just one long not too convincing diatribe on the lot of the homeless.Downey makes this picture tolerable. It is worth a look, if only for his performance.",6,0,0,8 May 2010
Law Abiding Citizen," Law Reviling Citizen
","As a Philadelphian, I watched Law Abiding Citizen with great interest. The film does exert extreme care to accurately portray our town. The story begins with great promise, and one almost thinks that it will avoid the worn out clichÃ©s of the 'out for vengeance' and 'super criminal' genres. In the final analysis, however, it stretches our suspension of belief too far.Borrowing a page from Shawshank Redemption, LAC takes what was in that great film a moderate suspension of belief regarding tunneling out of a prison to a totally unbelievable one about tunneling into one. In the end, Hollywood could just not resist the outrageous action film stunts, and the good cast of Jamie Foxx, Gerard Butler, and Colm Meaney are helpless to make us feel as if we are watching anything other than a gory and violent cartoon. If you watch, leave your mind at the door.Many reviewers here have commented that our 'hero', Clyde, would have been held in a county jail rather than a fortress-like prison, as shown. First off, Philadelphia IS a county (unto itself), and DOES have at least two fortress-like county jails that look exactly like the prison shown: the one I think it shows most often is called House of Correction (aka Pennypack House). Second, these jails have solitary confinement blocks and do house inmates awaiting trial.If you are from Philly, this movie is a must-see. Otherwise, it is strictly for fans of mindless action films.",6,2,3,20 July 2010
Atonement," Almost Great
","By all accounts, including mine, this is a beautiful movie. The astonishing attention to period detail, the beautiful cinematography, and the great panoramic embracing of the chaos of war make it a joy to watch. The acting is almost without exception perfect in all characters. Completely believable and without undue affectation.Why not 10 stars instead of 8? This good movie suffers from a pacing that is sometimes too slow, and some initially confusing time shifts; where a key scene is played over from another perspective, we are unsure if Knightley is jumping into the (incredibly deep) fountain for a 2nd time, or the scene is being replayed. It is clarified quickly, but blows ones concentration on the plot. That's one star deducted.And then there is the cadaverous Keira Knightly, who looks just terrible, like a victim of several famines. Her performance is fair, but she has all the sex appeal of a white stick, and thus makes it difficult to sympathize with her character, or even mildly understand McAvoy's desire for her. Another star deducted.All in all a very worthwhile production and an enjoyable two hours.",8,0,1,10 February 2008
