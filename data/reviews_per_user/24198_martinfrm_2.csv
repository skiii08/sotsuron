It," A lot of waiting for an almost disappointment
","A lot of waiting for an almost disappointment.... I loved Stephen King, his work marked my childhood and keeps marking me, I wait a lot of time for a remake of this movie (to me, the best book ever) but I had another disappointment, I'm wondering if the director read the book...This last movie is about an assassin clown style of A nightmare on elm street.. NO THATS WRONG!!! the book is about the fear and how IT play with the fear of the childs in Derry. Well I can talk a lot about for example, the misuse of special effects but don't have any sense....I'm going to keep on my mind the excellent piece of work that he wrote..",7,1,1,13 November 2017
