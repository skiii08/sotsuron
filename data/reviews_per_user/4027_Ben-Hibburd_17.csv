Sucker Punch," Sucker Punch Review.
","Did I just watch a film or a music Video?After giving this film some time sync in, I still find myself highly conflicted towards Sucker Punch. On one hand it's a well made action fantasy film. On the other I have serious issues with the story and it's blatant, poorly conceived foreshadowing that constantly took me out of the film.Sucker Punch tells the story of a young woman(Babydoll the name given to her) played by Emily Browning whose father has recently passed. She and her sister have inherited his fortune, much to the anger and jealousy of her abusive stepfather. After a fatal accident she is blamed for her sisters death and put into an asylum where she is scheduled to have a lobotomy in five days time at the behest of her stepfather, who's trying to cover up what really happened.The opening ten minutes where all this plays out like a video game cut scene was frustrating. Whilst I appreciate dialogue free visual storytelling it's filled with every annoying visual motif in Zack Snyders locker. Slow motion, crane shots, colourless pallet and rock music that was distracting and didn't fit the tone of what was happening on-screen.As the film progresses to the asylum we are Introduced to Oscar issac who plays Blue Jones the head guard, and the one that's essentially running the asylum. I burst out laughing when I initially saw him. He essentially looks like a pimp that has escaped from a 1970's Roger Corman film. After getting myself accustomed to his unique costume design, he's one of the strongest parts of the film. He gives a terrific menacing performance filled intensity and a certain amount of instability.Emily Browning plays the lead character of Babydoll in the film. Once she's at the asylum, she is sent to what is essentially a brothel section of the asylum. Here she has to learn to dance for the patrons of the establishment. We are then introduced to Dr. Gorski whose the madame of the brothel, played by Carla Gugino. With five days till her lobotomy and the horrors of the asylum, she decides to plan an escape with help of a group of other inmates.The first thirty minutes of the film I found to be Incredibly dull and infuriating. The story plods along without much interest, except for when the camera spends extra long time on what will be key items for the escape, that will then be revealed later in the film. No prizes for guessing what they are when you watch the film, as Snyder makes sure to insult the audiences intelligence, and make sure that everyone knows what they need to know without giving any credence to subtlety.At this point of the film I had lost most of patience and was getting close to turning the film off. However when Babydoll goes into her first dance routine, the film completely changes gear. She mentally transports herself to other worlds/settings. When this happens the film springs into life, and becomes an utter joy to watch. The best part of this film is the second dance sequence where Babydoll and her friends are transported to steampunk version of World War 2. The girls have to fight through trenches filled with steampunk Nazis that look like a cross between mad max and Wolfenstein. This set piece is really well shot and edited. Zack Snyder knows how to frame and execute excellent, choreographed action sequences. There are also many great nods and tributes to fantasy cinema in this film.This makes the film all the more Infuriating. There are moments of cinematic magic filled with breathtaking set pieces, that are engaging and a joy to behold. When the film is focused On these moments it works brilliantly. However there are long periods of this film, especially the first half that are dull and fall flat. This is an original film which I'm always happy to see Hollywood produce. The execution however let this film down. Some of Snyder's choices left me scratching my head, the music in this film is terrible save for the one original song, it's all made up of pre-existing rock music that clashes tonally with the film. Plus another issue I had with the film, was the poorly thought-out juxtaposition between the grey dull hospital scenes and the colourful fantasy world, and leaves little to the imagination as to where the film is heading.There's a lot of fun to be had with Sucker Punch. I went into it with no expectations, and I was pleasantly surprised by the film. It has excellent action set pieces, and the film shines when it's focused on these sequences. Unfortunately it doesn't out-weigh the dull and poorly executed first act, and the ill-conceived tonal shifts. Despite the films flaws there is a fun time to be had with this film, which in time has cult classic written all over it.",7,2,3,19 June 2017
Shaun of the Dead," Shaun of the Dead Review.
","Shaun of the Dead is one of only a handful of films, where no matter how far it is into its runtime, if I see it on TV i'll stop what i'm doing and watch it until its credits. This is one of the funniest films I've ever seen, and one that gets better upon repeat viewings. It's an Incredibly fun film that is endlessly quotable. Edgar Wright directs this film with a high level of energy and stylish panache. Shaun of the Dead has one of the best scripts written for a comedy, it rivals classics like Young Frankenstein, it's one of the most thought out, intelligent genre comedies around.Simon Pegg plays your average every-man Shaun. Shaun is lazy, carefree and floating through life like a figurative zombie. He's some-one that's constantly taking the easy option, much to the annoyance of his girlfriend Liz(Kate Ashfield). So when a Zombie outbreak occurs, Shaun and his equally oafish roommate Ed(Nick Frost) are completely oblivious to the chaos encompassing them.This leads to some truly hilarious situations such-as when Shaun is walking to his local convince store. He's completely disconnected on his everyday route to the local convenience shop, he Ignores a crashed car, a woman running away, an approaching zombie that he assumes is a beggar wanting change. Even when he slips on a pool of blood he's not attune to his surroundings. Being an Edgar Wright film, there are tons of visual gags and Easter eggs that accompany the situation, and the film as a whole. This makes re-watching the film just as fun and engaging as the first time, if not more-so.There's even interesting social commentary to be gained from the film as- well. Much like George A. Romero's Dead trilogy it looks at how oblivious society has become, and how mundane our daily lives are, that not only does a Zombie apocalypse come and go without any notice being taken, but also how much real people act like Zombies, doing the same jobs and tasks day after day, becoming increasingly disconnected with society and each other. Whilst this aspect is explored in greater detail in Romero's Dead films, there's still a healthy serving of satire in this film to be gained. The fact that Wright can extract gags from some of the most mundane scenarios like a pen leaking on a shirt is a testament to his wonderfully creative writing and directing skills.However once Shaun and Ed come to realise the situation they're in, the film really kicks Into gear. After Shaun and Ed fend off an assault from two zombies in hysterical fashion, by sorting through their un-wanted vinyl records, and trying to lob them at their heads. Though when that failed they have to resort to a spade and a cricket bat. They then devise a plan to take Shaun's mum and his girlfriend Liz as-well as her two roommates, and hide-out at their local pub. In Shaun's words 'Go to the Winchester, have a pint, and wait for all this to blow over.'Naturally during the course of the film things don't go smoothly, and despite being a comedy, it is after all a Zombie film. There are moments with lots of gore, as-well as brilliantly timed Zombie kills to the beat of Queens - Don't Stop Me Now. Shaun of the Dead manages to converge these two tones, and deliver one of the best genre mash ups of all-time.Shaun of the Dead was my first exposure to the Incredible talent that is Edgar Wright. His writing and directing, and especially the way his films are edited to the beat of a drum show how confident and creative of a director that he is. Despite this being his debut film(no i'm not counting A Fistful of Fingers), he is like a puppet master that is in full control of every frame. I can't find a bad word to say about Shaun of the Dead, for me this Is the pinnacle of comedic film-making.",10,0,1,5 August 2017
The Babadook," The Babadook Review.
","The Babadook(2014) is an Australian film by first time writer/director Jennifer Kent. The film Is about a recently widowed single mother Amelia(Essie Davis), who is struggling with controlling her out of control six year old son Sam(Noah Wiseman), who is convinced monsters exist. His behaviour becomes more and more erratic to the point she's forced to take him out of school and look after him by herself. One night Amelia reads him a story of The Babadook, that mysteriously appears on Sams bookshelf. As she begins to read the disturbing book of Mr.Babadook, who torments victims when they become aware of it's existence. Amelia rips up and throws out the book, but the book re- assembles, and is left on her front door. Then strange and more violent acts start happening, as she starts having visions of her deceased husband.Jennifer Kent, directs the film with a very claustrophobic feel, so that the main characters are always feeling trapped and unable to escape from their environment. The Babadook is filled with intelligent symbolism, and metaphors for the viewer think about during the film, and long after it's ended. The film deals with Issues about how fear attracts fear, and how not dealing with our problems, can bring the deepest parts of our subconscious to life. The film is boosted by two strong performances from the lead actors. Davis portrays a grieving mother who is at the end of her rope, with her son, as she begins to lose sight of reality. Wiseman gives a star making performance in his first film. He does a fantastic job of showing both strength and vulnerability, whilst dealing with paranormal monsters, and his increasingly dangerous and destructive home life.The Babadook Is a film that focuses on style, subtext and atmosphere, whilst rarely using jump scares to terrify it's audience. This film has all the right ingredients that makes it one of the best Horror films in recent years.",9,4,6,12 January 2016
The Great Dictator," The Great Dictator Review.
","The Great Dictator Is written and directed by Charlie Chaplin. It also sees him play duel roles. In the primary role he plays Dictator Adenoid Hynkel of a fictional country called Tomainia. Who over the course of the film tries to expand his empire by trying to borrow money from a Jewish banker In order to Invade his neighbouring country of Osterlich. After being refused the loan he orders the purge of Jewish community which was already being subjugated under his orders.Chaplins second role Is juxtaposed against Hynkel, he plays a Jewish barber(his name is never given) and Is a WW1 veteran. Who In the process of saving the life of a wounded pilot, loses his own memory. Twenty years later returns to the ghetto where he falls In love with Hannah(Paulette Goddard), and tries to go back to being a barber. However after being constantly harassed by Hynkels stormtroopers, finds himself on the run.The set up and story of this film is fairly basic, and offers no surprises, but the film never Intends to. Instead this Is a platform for Chaplin to voice a larger message. The film was made In 1940, at the time the USA hadn't entered the war yet. Whilst the horrors and persecution of the Jewish people hadn't been fully realised yet at that point In time. If It had of been know, I think this would've been a very different film, It probably wouldn't of even been made.This if one of only a couple of films In which Chaplin spoke In, and It's this reason why the film feels more powerful then It would've been had someone else starred In It. This is personified In what many people would agree to be the finest speech In film history at the end of the film. The last five minutes of the film are by far and away the most famous aspect of the film, and for good reason. It's a rousing and profound speech, that comes straight from Chaplins heart. It's a speech that speaks too the very goodness of humanity. It's also made all the more effective coming from a man known for his silence.Whilst the last few minutes of the film has a very serious tone and message. The film contains the usual levity and slapstick humour that Is associated with Chaplins work. There are many moments of excellent satire peppered all throughout the film. my personal favourite being when the Barber meets up with the pilot he saved twenty years later(Schultz). Schultz saves him from being taken by the Stormtroopers. He says to the barber 'Strange, and I always thought of you as an Aryan' To which Chaplins barber responds 'I'm a vegetarian' In a deadpan manner. There are a few jokes that do feel a little dated. The majority however hit their mark, and feel fresh and contemporary In todays current climate.The Great Dictator came out at an Important time not just film history, but human history. Whilst some of the satire Is a little too on the nose. The film did what it needed too do with flying colours, It's a beautiful film to watch and the editing and direction is on point. The Great Dictator maybe arguably one of the most important films ever made. It's a film that everyone should watch at-least once In their life-time.",9,1,1,29 June 2017
The Terminator," The Terminator Review
","I'm going to preface this review by saying that The Terminator is one of my favourite films of all-time. And a film i consider to be a near faultless action/horror masterpiece!I think by now pop culture and anyone who considers themselves a film buff knows what this story is about. So i'm not going to go into a long winded jaunt into the finer plot elements as they've been done to death already. However I wanted too highlight one area of the film that I don't think gets enough credit. And that would be the phenomenal pacing and editing. In my opinion The Terminator has the best pacing in a film that I've seen, and perhaps one of the best of all-time.The film starts with a small amount of exposition which is needed. But as soon as the film shifts to the present day the film moves at a thunderous pace and never slows down. Even in the quieter character building scenes the plot is constantly being propelled towards the films endgame.From the assault on the Police precinct onward the film maintains a constant fluidity of pure action intertwined with deep character motivations. There's not a single dull frame in this film, even after my thirtieth odd watch i'm constantly engaged and sucked into the film, and a-lot of this down to brilliant editing.The action scenes are also expertly shot and choreographed. The transitions from one set piece to other flow smoothly, never feeling out of place. It's a truly remarkable achievement James Cameron was able to accomplish on such a small budget.With exception to Mad Max: The Road Warrior I can't think of another action film that's paced to perfection. There are very few films that are able to balance action, character development and world building with as much depth as The Terminator. Editor Mark Goldblatt deserves just as much credit as Cameron got for crafting a flawless action masterpiece.",10,2,4,19 December 2017
The Thing," John Carpenter's The Thing(1982)
","John Carpenter's The Thing, is a film about an ice station research team in the Antarctic during the first week of Winter. The film opens with a Dog being chased by a Norwegian Helicopter pilot and a passenger shooting at it. After accidentally blowing up the helicopter, the last surviving Norwegian begins to follow the dog into the American base until the dog is saved by the American group, who believe the Norwegian team have gone crazy. Upon being moved into the kennel, the dog begins to mutate into a disturbing creature that attacks the other dogs. We soon find out that this 'dog' is in-fact an Alien that has the ability to change it's appearance of anyone it assimilates.As the Alien begins wreck havoc amongst the crew this leaves us with a group of characters unable to trust each other. As they are being picked off one by one, and replaced by the Thing. When the group begins to learn that this creature is of Alien origin the doubt and mistrust begins to further set in. The group is lead by McCready(Kurt Russell), who takes charge of the situation. His unwillingness to let the Thing go free, and suspicion towards the group begins to breed mistrust and paranoia. Whilst on the other hand the group aren't sure whether he could be the Thing, and trying to deliberately fracture the group.The film is directed by John Carpenter and was his first big studio film after having previous critical and commercial success with Halloween(1978), and Escape From New York(1981). The film ended up doing badly at the box office not even making it's budget back. The film also received critical backlash, which wasn't aided at the time by going up against Steven Spielberg's family friendly E.T.Carpenter directs this film with expert craftsmanship, the film is incredibly well shot, with scenes that are genuinely horrific and scary. It's also helped by the cinematography of long time collaborator Dean Cundey(Halloween). The film is shot on location which gives the filman authentic isolated setting. This exacerbates the film sense of dread and paranoia which seeps through the film, from the opening shot too it's hauntingly ambiguous ending.The film should also be praised for it's excellent use practical effects, that still hold up incredibly well today. Carpenter and his team create some of the most disturbing creature designs in cinema history. The score by Ennio Morricone is brooding and filled with tension that adds another layer of depth to the film.John Carpenter's The Thing Is a stripped down thrill ride that pulls no punches. It asks us to keep our eyes open at all times for even the slightest clue as to who may or may not be The Thing. It's also a film filled With characters that we genuinely care about, they're fleshed out and have fully developed personalities. Something which Horror films have forgotten to do in the last decade. The Thing is a film that will be remembered as a classic in the Horror genre for decades to come.",10,2,6,11 January 2016
Mission: Impossible - Rogue Nation," Mission: Impossible Rouge Nation Review
","2015 was a prolific year for spy films, we had The Man From Uncle, Spy, Spectre, and of course Mission: Impossible - Rouge Nation which is the best of the bunch. Rouge Nation is Tom Cruise's fifth outing as IMF super spy Ethan Hunt. Mission: Impossible is a franchise that has constantly changed and evolved with every incarnation. This is mostly down to the franchise having different directors that have their own take on the story.I watched this film upon its initial release in the cinema, and whilst I liked the film then, I didn't think it was particularly memorable. Whilst I still find that true to some degree, upon my re-watch it's definitely a whole lot more fun and engaging then I initially gave it credit for.The opening scene is the obvious go to argument for the best set piece of the film. It's a fantastic sequence, which is perpetuated by the fact that Tom Cruise is literally hanging off the side of a plane as it's taking off. It's a piece of film-making that solidifies Tom Cruise's position as one of the most dedicated actors of his generation. The film is worth watching just for the opening five minutes. Thankfully though the film doesn't rest on its laurels as it could quite easily of done.The best sequence of the film, in this humble reviewers opinion is the Opera scene. As Ethan Hunt and partner Benji(played with fantastic comedic enthusiasm by Simon Pegg.) race against time as they try to prevent the assassination of the Austrian chancellor, by a shadowy criminal organisation only known as the Syndicate. The Syndicate is lead by an ex British secret agent called Solomon Lane. Sean Harris tries his best to be a menacing figure as Lane, but fails to convince as a legitimate omnipresent villain in the film. His character is poorly thought out and given very little depth. He becomes yet another throwaway villain in the Mission: Impossible canon.Whilst on the other hand newcomer to the series, and the female lead of the film Rebecca Ferguson feels like a breath of fresh air for the franchise. She plays a British double agent Ilsa Faust. She does a fantastic job of portraying a complete bad-ass that can beat up anyone in her way, or through her alluring sensuality. She's given the most depth and made the most sympathetic character as a turncoat agent whose loyalties are never trusted, at-least until she no longer requires certain characters expertise.Christopher McQuarie does a terrific job directing the film. The editing, and action scenes are top notch. They are well put together and the action flows seamlessly, they are coherent unlike a-lot of big budget action films. The film does have issues in the script department, especially with the main villain. It's also fairly predictable in some areas. Whilst this does slightly detract from the film, it's made up for by a fantastic female lead, and a great supporting cast. Overall Rouge Nation is a lot of fun, and one of the better action films from 2015.",7,1,1,29 July 2017
Pi," Pi Review.
","I didn't really want to review this film as there's not a great deal to say about it that people haven't already. Darren Aronofsky's debut film is a bizarre, surreal, intelligent, paranoia fuelled film about a mathematician who's trying to uncover the patterns of the universe.The main reason I wanted to talk about this film, is that Clint Mansell's incredible score is in my opinion one of the best scores I've heard in any film. It's an expertly constructed piece of work that helps to elevate every aspect of this film. The score is perfectly intertwined with the central character of the film, and works as his inner monologue to reflect his different mental states throughout the film. From being eerie to panic ridden to sheer mania it's a bold piece of work. That when I found myself drifting from the film it was the score that kept sucking me back in with it's intoxicating atmosphere.The film on the whole is pretty good, but without the score I don't think this film would've worked nearly as well as it did. I would recommend watching this film for the soundtrack alone.",7,0,1,19 December 2017
Star Wars: Episode VIII - The Last Jedi," Star Wars: Episode VIII - The Last Jedi Review/thoughts
","I can't remember the last time Iv'e left a screening of a film and been so conflicted about the events I've witnessed. This review is going to be more of a general thoughts and feelings as I'm still trying to digest the film. I'll keep this as spoiler free as possible.<ul><li>Firstly I thought the first act was the weakest, whilst the space battles were thrilling and engaging, the plot was essentially a rip-off of the the first season of the rebooted Battlestar Galatica. Whilst I loved the show, I wish that the 'story group' came up with a better story.</li></ul><ul><li>Another issue in the first act was the comedic clashes in the tone of the film. There were way too many jokes, a couple garnered a chuckle, but the majority were cringe worthy.</li></ul><ul><li>I was happy to see Poe get a larger role in this film, he is given a proper fleshed out character arc, unlike a-lot of characters. He brings charm and likeability to the story without it ever feeling exaggerated. I'm looking forward too seeing where his character will go in the next film.</li></ul><ul><li>Pretty much everything with Kylo Ren was brilliant, he really is the the standout MVP in this trilogy. His character is given extra layers of depth and turmoil, expanding on the great foundation he was given in The Force Awakens.</li></ul><ul><li>Kylo Ren and Rey's dynamic was the highlight of the film, anytime the film cutaway I wanted it to go back to them.</li></ul><ul><li>The cinematography, editing, score etc were all well done. Rian Johnson does a good job of capturing the Star Wars feel visually. There are a couple of standout moments the are just beautiful to witness. I won't elaborate further as I don't want to spoil anything, but when you see the film you'll know straight away.</li></ul><ul><li>One of the biggest issues I had was the poorly plotted scenes involving Finn, Rose and Canto Bight. It felt like it came from another film, when I was in the cinema I thought to myself that it played out more like Guardians of the Galaxy. I was really perplexed about why they went down this route. And that's not even mentioning the ridiculously on the nose politicising about animal cruelty. I mean WTF did PETA part fund this film? I'm all for subtext but this was badly misjudged.</li></ul><ul><li>The final act of the film was fantastic and it felt more like a Star Wars film. Crait is an excellent addition to the Star Wars universe. However the final battle felt slightly rushed. </li></ul>All in all there were some great things in this film, however I felt like they misjudge a few plot/lore elements that I really didn't like. I'm going to talk about light spoilers in this next section so be warned!!!_____________________________________________________________________________________SPOILERS!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

SPOILERS!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

<ul><li>I want to mention that i'm a big fan of the whole Star Wars universe, whether that's watching Clone Wars, Rebels, reading all the new Disney canon from the Aftermath books to Guardians of the Whills. Reading all the Marvel canon comics. Heck even the now defunct legends books like Heir to the Empire, Crimson Empire, The New Republic etc.</li></ul>This film let me done in one major area. And that's Luke Skywalker. Whist iv'e started to come to terms with his 'arc'. In the end it felt like a character assassination. They took everything I loved about Luke Skywalker when I was growing up and stomped it into the ground. To be honest I can see why people say that it feels like a slap in the face to fans of the extended universe.<ul><li>I get that Disney want and in fact need to move away from the original trilogy but this felt wrong to me. The Luke Skywalker I remember would NEVER, NEVER try and kill his nephew even in a moment of weakness. He helped bring Vader back who was so far gone, and this felt like a complete cop-out. In the EU he made mistakes, but was still revered as the greatest Jedi that ever lived, he was a hero and an inspiration. In thi this film he's a crusty old hermit that milks cows.....sigh!</li></ul><ul><li>I must say I wasn't to bothered about the changes to the lore about the Jedi and force powers. I actually think it opens up some interesting directions in future films. I also really like that they brought up the contradictions of the Jedi order which was expanded in depth in the Clone Wars.</li></ul><ul><li>Another issue I had was how this film essentially made the Force Awakens completely irrelevant. Everything J.J set up has been thrown out of the window, and that left a bad taste in my mouth. I guess I can't wait to see what Snoke's origins will be in a new novel next year by Greg Rucka or someone.</li></ul><ul><li>Don't even get me started on Phasma.</li></ul>In the end iv'e given this film a 3/5. I really feel like I need too re-watch this film as there was a-lot too absorb. Actually this film would of been better if it was episode 9, as it felt more like a finale then a middle film. I hope a re-watch will improve upon my initial complaints, but something the first time round just felt a bit off. Either way I hope they don't bring back Lando in 9 and then just kill him off.",5,0,0,19 December 2017
Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind," Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind Review.
","I think it goes without saying amongst fellow film aficionados, that we all love films, especially the great ones. However over the years watching films I've noticed there seems to be that one film that is hugely popular, but when you sit down to watch it, you can't understand why it's held in such high regard. For me it's only happened a couple of times, but I unfortunately have to add Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind to the list.Whilst I appreciated the original screenplay from Charlie Kaufman(whose work I usually love), it felt completely flat. I was never engaged at any moment in the film, the characters were extremely unlikable and had horrible personalities. Other then one emotional scene towards the end with Kirsten Dunst's character, the film felt dull and lifeless. At no point did I feel invested in the story. I was unable to buy into Joel(Jim Carrey) and Clementine's(Kate Winslet) impromptu relationship, which dissolved just as quickly as it began, giving me no time with their characters to care about their eventual fate.Both Jim Carrey and Kate Winslet give excellent performances, as do the entire cast. I just disliked their characters. The technical aspects of the film were well done. The way the film showcases memories, and the way they subsequently disappeared/folded into each other was expertly crafted and brilliantly edited. The only issue is the story and the characters didn't work for me. No matter how good the direction and editing is, the majority of the the time a film lives or dies by the strength of it's story and it's characters, and here it ultimately failed.",4,31,62,28 September 2017
The Witch," Rapid Fire Review of The Witch.
","This is going to be a quick review, usually I like to go more in-depth in my reviews, but everything that can be said about The Witch has been said. So these are my quick thoughts.The Witch is a masterpiece. It's what true horror is all about, it has a fantastic story alongside amazing acting. the film is accompanied with a brilliant brooding atmosphere, that is filled with absolute dread, that seeps into your very bones. This for me is the best Horror film in the last twenty years. It's far beyond the offerings of today's 'Horror' the Blumhouse type jump scare, poorly edited assembly line of crap films.The biggest problem with this film, is the audience, people tend to go into this film not understanding what type of film to expect. Most people I know thought it was going to be a Conjuring type film. It's so much more then that, this is the type of horror that belongs in the 1970s. Robert Eggers had full creative control to do what he wanted. You just don't get that sort of freedom today, and despite it being his debut feature he absolutely knocked it out of the park. The Witch is a far cry from the usual copy and paste, play it safe jump scare horror, which in my opinion isn't at all scary. This film reminded me of Horror classics like Rosemary's Baby, Don't Look Now and even Ken Russell's The Devils. Like those classics this is true horror that gets under your skin and stays there. The Witch is a wonderful piece of pure cinema!",10,1,4,29 July 2017
Arrival," Arrival Review.
","What do you get with a director at the top of his game, mixed with the endless possibilities afforded to the Sci-Fi genre? The answer is Arrival. Arrival is a powerful film about the fluidity of time, and the power of language. The film is directed by Denis Villeneuve, who at the moment can do no wrong. As with all Villeneuve it goes without saying that the cinematography looks incredible. Where the film truly shines is in it's brilliant, wholly original screenplay.Amy Adams plays Louise Banks, a linguistics professor. We learn at the start of the film she is a grieving mother going through the motions, that is until 12 oval ships land across the world. Louise is tasked alongside mathematician Ian Donnelly(Jeremy Renner) to try and communicate with the visitors. Every actor is on top of their game here, especially Amy Adams, who becomes increasingly weary and desperate to communicate with the aliens, as tensions rise between global superpowers, over how to handle the situation.There is not one aspect of this film i can fault, it's one of the best Sci-Fi films ever made. It is full of wonderful ideas, and it explores them in great detail. Just like the best Sci-Fi story's it's also a human story, that is both emotional and powerful. Arrival delivers it's message without it ever feeling condescending, and it's a film that raises the bar in the the Sci-Fi genre.",10,0,4,10 September 2017
Blow," Blow review.
","Blow is directed by Ted Demme and stars Johnny Depp as real life drug smuggler George Jung, who was part of the Medellin cartel run by Pablo Escobar that at one point had an 85% market share of all cocaine imported into America in the late 70s early 80s. Blow is a fairly inspired biopic with some flashy moments sprinkled throughout. Watching this film I kept asking myself what was the film trying to achieve? Because I struggled to find anything that retained my interest in the film. That's not too say this is a flat out bad film, which it isn't, it's just with a plethora of quality crime biopics such-as: Goodfellas, Donnie Brasco, Serpico, Scarface etc this film falls by the wayside.The film is technically well constructed and the soundtrack was a joy. The film also contains terrific performances across the board. Johnny Depp gives one of his better performances, he does a terrific job of making a thoroughly unlikable character somewhat sympathetic and relatable. The star of the show for me was Jordi Mollà, Jung's unhinged business partner Diego Delgado. During a short stint in prison Jung and Delgado team together alongside Escobar to flood the American market with cocaine. Also in this time Jung meets and marries Mirtha (Penelope Cruz). Demme does a good job of juxtaposing their relationship against Jung's own parents which adds a nice dynamic to the film.The film is rounded out by excellent supporting performances from Ray Liotta, Rachel Griffiths and Paul Reubens. The entire cast give a committed performance. It's just a shame that for such an interesting time in history the screenplay was so dull. You almost get a sense that the creators were trying to make their own version of Goodfellas, rather than expressing their own vision, and in doing so the film came off as being disingenuous. Ted Demme does not have the same kinetic editing or free-flowing, stylish camera movements that Martin Scorsese does. Which he then tries to over-compensate with, using a high-energy soundtrack and voice-over character exposition. The problem is this only works when the pacing is rapid and the audience needs quick-fire exposition to understand what's happening. The pacing in this film is lethargic, and the voice-over became increasingly tedious.In the end Blow is a disappointing film, it had so much potential that wasn't fully realised. There are fun moments to be found in the film, and the engaging performances more than make up for a dull script. The biggest issue with Blow is that it's a film that is more interested in following the footsteps of past genre classics, rather than carving out its own path.",5,1,3,27 October 2017
Star Wars: Episode VII - The Force Awakens," Star Wars: The Force Awakens Review(re-upload)
","Star Wars: The Force Awakens Is a newest chapter in the long running Space opera saga, taking place 30 years after the events of Return of the Jedi. We learn from the opening text crawl that in the absence of Luke Skywalker, the sinister First Order has risen into power led by the menacing Kylo Ren(Adam Driver), who is on the hunt for the last Jedi Knight Luke Skywalker. He is introduced into the film in an explosive sequence setting the tone for the remainder of the film. Driver brings a lot of raw emotion to the part of Ren, who's being tormented by his feelings, and lure to the Light and Dark side. During the opening scene Ren comes into contact with newcomer Poe Dameron(Oscar Issac) a rebel fighter pilot regarded as the best in the resistance. Who is handed a vital piece of information, that could lead to the whereabouts of Luke Skywalker, and thus sets off a chain of events bringing in old and new characters alike. Issac brings a-lot of likability as Poe to the film, and was reminiscent of Han Solo(Harrison Ford) In the original trilogy. Whilst on the Planet of Jakku we're introduced to Finn(John Boyega) a disillusioned stormtrooper, who wants out of the First Order. Boyega plays the part with a lot enthusiasm, and joy he brings a lot of laughs to the story whilst maintaining his own dramatic moments through out the story. He eventually comes into contact with a scavenger named Rey(Daisy Ridley) on the planet Jakku. Who struggles to make a living finding scraps/relics for food, she is also torn between waiting for her family to come back, and realising that her journey is much more then salvaging parts, when She crosses paths with Finn and a lovable new droid named BB8. After a thrilling escape from the First Order our heroes come across veterans of the original series Han Solo(Ford) and the Wookie Chewbacca(Peter Mayhew). Ford does a good job of tying the mythos of the original trilogy, and connecting us with the newcomers, without ever leaving old viewers feeling cold and new viewers guessing as too what is happening.From the moment the film begins it maintains a breakneck pace, that hardly allows the viewer to stop and reflect what's happening with the plot of the film, which Is a good thing, because there are a-lot of plot holes In the film. We are also given enough information sprinkled throughout the film so that all the new characters feel fleshed out enough, to make us care about them.The film spends most of the first half on a desert planet named Jakku, The cinematography Is beautiful to look at, the screen Is filled with sweeping landscapes that gives the world a vast feeling of isolation and hopelessness. Disney brought In director JJ Abrams, who recently came off of rebooting the successful Star Trek franchise. He's the perfect choice to re-invigorate this franchise, his use of practical effects give this film a weight that all the prequels were sorely missing. We feel the size and scope of Starkiller Base, the heaviness of the Lightsabers, you feel the impact of the blaster rifles. The use of real locations and sets also give the film a-lot of natural colour which bursts onto the screen. Where-as the prequel trilogy which was all shot on digital, and Used a lot of CGI characters and effects. CGI in the film is used to a minimum and only used when needed. There were however a couple of characters, Unkar Plutt and Maz Kanata which felt like they could of been done better. In a couple scenes they look out place when surrounded by practical effects and actors in costumes and make up. Overall the film is visually stunning to look at because of this it gives the film(and series) a fresh vibrancy that has been lacking since Return of the Jedi. There are also just the right amount of callbacks, without it becoming crowd-pleasing, there is a plenty of nostalgia and references to the original films that fans of the series will recognise. John Williams also creates a new score with him that feels a little lacklustre when compared to original and prequel films. The only memorable theme being Kylo Rens.There were on the other hand certain aspects of the film which felt like it was treading old water from A New Hope, especially Starkiller Base, which is essentially a third Deathstar that feels like it's only part of the film so there's a third act, for all our heroes too band together and fight. It's hard not too notice certain similarities from the A New Hope, and at times feels like It's been done to play things safe after the backlash of the Prequels. The film is also filled a lot of humorous moments as-well, which helps to lighten up some of the darker aspects of the film, although not every joke hits the mark, and occasionally they feel out of place, especially during the the last act of the film.Star Wars the: The Force Awakens is filled with excellent set pieces which immerses the audience back into the universe. We're given enough plot information, and character development to draw us into the the new generation of characters. Whilst some areas feel familiar, there Is a lot too love about this film, watching this In the Cinema was an Incredibly exciting and engaging experience, which had me feeling like a kid watching the original films for the first time and being swept away into a galaxy far, far away. This film has resurrected the Star Wars franchise, and made it one of the must see film experiences of the year.",8,79,115,22 August 2017
John Wick: Chapter 2," John Wick Chapter 2 Review.
","It pains me to write this review. After the brilliant surprise hit of the first film, i was highly anticipating where the series would go next. Instead i found John Wick chapter 2 to be Incredibly disappointing. This film is a shining example that more doesn't equate to being better.Despite the multiple amounts of gun fights and action sequences, they all blend from one set piece to another. There's no real fluidity or stand out moments except for the pencil scene, but even that felt more like fan service then originality. This is an Issue that crops up multiple times in the film. The action scenes in this film are again well shot and choreographed. They're also edited better then most action films of the last decade. Chad Stahelski and his stunt team deserve credit for delivering a competent, well shot action film.The problem however is that it's nothing we haven't all ready seen from the first film. There's not a whole lot of difference other then the fact there are far too many action sequences that felt over the top in this film. They were so frequent the audience is barley given any time to process the moment. Whereas The first film had three main set pieces which all felt unique, with the first film building itself up to the central set piece of the film, the nightclub scene which was exhilarating and a joy to watch. There aren't any moments like that in this film, it just moves from one action scene to the next, and most action scenes aren't as engaging or given any payoff. The film also retains none of the humour or levity from it's predecessor, instead the film felt nastier and cynical.The biggest complaint i have with this film though, was there was too much plot exposition and focus on the underworld element. The fact that nearly everyone in the city is somehow connected with the underworld was bordering on the ludicrous. This was a really cool element in the first film because it was kept in the background. The underworld felt mysterious and somewhat alluring, in this film it takes centre stage and takes a lot of focus away from the characterisation of John Wick.The film was also missing any form of emotional attachment to John Wick. In the first film we were given a clear and precise emotional hook, that allowed the audience to feel guilt free and root for John, when he goes on his murderous quest for vengeance. In this film he's given no choice by the main antagonist that is played by Riccardo Scamarcio. Who's given no character development and felt incredibly dull. The side characters in the film, Ares(Ruby Rose) and Cassian(Common) are given more to do, and do a better job feeling like an actual threat to John. They both give terrific physical performances, and the film would of benefited far more if they were made the primary antagonists.I went into this film with a lot of excitement after being blown away by how much fun i had with the first film. Unfortunately the director was unable to catch lightning in a bottle twice. There are good sequences in the film. Overall the film felt too self-indulgent. Whilst i respect the films ambition to be more then the sum of it parts, and blossom into a franchise that can go in many different directions with It's underworld development. This film felt too much of a set up for future films, TV series, spin-offs etc.",5,4,8,18 June 2017
Sully," Sully Review
","Sully is directed by Clint Eastwood and it's the most generic film I've seen this year. The film is neither amazing nor terrible, it lies slap bang in the middle. The film is a dramatisation of the 2009 emergency plane landing on the Hudson river. The film stars Tom Hanks as Captain Chesley 'Sully' Sullenberger. Hanks is the highlight of the film, he turns in a classy performance as usual. It's also clear to see though, that he didn't have much to work with.The film feels uninspired, maybe it's because there's not a-lot of dramatic tension in the real life events, save for the plane landing. However because the events are so fresh in everyone's mind, it's hard to forget what the outcome is. This means the film lacks any dramatic tension whatsoever.So now that we all know what were getting with the film what does it do to pull us in? The answers is nothing. Other then Tom Hanks the film has no punch. There are a couple scenes where Hanks is exhibiting PTSD. Rather then explore this subplot it's quickly swept under the rug, never to be brought up again.The other actors in the film are just there. The cinematography is bland. Nothing in the film really stands out. In the end the film is competently made, but it's played too safe. It almost feels like a quick cash grab before the story is forgotten about and stored away in the history books.",6,0,1,18 September 2017
Draft Day," Draft Day Review.
","Draft Day is a quaint, feel good sports drama, that focuses on the more mundane backroom elements that go into running a professional sports team. The film stars Kevin Costner as Sonny Weaver Jr. the general manager of the Cleveland Browns. At the start of the film Sonny is given an opportunity to trade his number 1 pick for three consecutive years, to have the ability to sign a highly rated Quarterback in this years draft. After getting cold feet upon accepting the deal, he spends the rest of the day wheeling and dealing with other GM's to get the best deal for his team and come out on top by days end.Right away it's safe to say that this film will alienate a large chuck of its audience. Especially those outside the U.S or those that don't follow the NFL. Ivan Reitman who directs this film understands this, so to compensate for this he uses a-lot of exposition to educate his audience. This is a useful tool for some, but for me, as someone that is a fan of American football I found it ear-gratingly cheesy. The fact that a GM needs reminding what number Tom Brady was picked at, felt silly. There were a couple of exposition heavy scenes like this that had me rolling my eyes.Whilst the exposition at times was irritating, I do understand why it was needed. The fact that Ivan Reitman was able to make a sports film that contained no sporting action, as fun and engaging as this film was, is a fantastic achievement. The screenplay whilst fairly standard manages to run along at a decent pace. Never at any moment did Draft day feel boring or dull, even if it was predictable in it's resolutions.Where the film triumphs is in Kevin Costners performance. Costner is at his charismatic best in this film. He brings warmth and empathy to his character that makes you root for him to come out on top by days end. He's also surrounded by terrific performances from a great supporting cast that features Jennifer Garner, Dennis Leary, Frank Langella to name but a few.Draft Day may be lacking in dramatic tension that most sports films have, but what it does do is shine a spotlight on an aspect of sport that isn't as sexy or cool to talk about. The fact that Reitman was able to have me root for the backroom staff is a wonderful achievement in my book.",7,0,0,27 September 2017
