Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," To the Die-Hard Fans...
","To the die-hard Star Wars fans, Phantom Menace is a disgrace. I am only 15, but I grew up with a VERY die-hard Star Wars fan for a father. I've SEEN the newer editions of 4, 5, and 6, I've seen the original editions! and I've seen Episodes 1, 2, and 3. I've seen the whole thing. Heck, my seven-year old brother owns the Ewok Adventures! Now, to discuss the arguable points of Phantom Menace.1. The acting of Jake Lloyd. He was nine when it was made! Even though he did acting jobs before this, he was still nine. What kind of attention span did YOU have at nine?2. The direction of George Lucas.WHAT THE HECK ARE YOU SAYING? He is excellent. This wasn't his best, but it certainly wasn't his worst. His worst was Episode 2: Attack of the Clones. It was 2 hours of CG effects, and 30 minutes of plot. And why do I have to feeling that after I submit this, I'm going to go to the Attack of the Clones page and find the TPM haters LOVING AOTC?3. The fact that a lot of this is CG effects, SO? Lucas is using modern technology to his advantage! When was the last time yo saw a sci-fi movie (original trilogy excluded) that WASN'T 50% CG, at least? Give me ONE movie, and I'll concede defeat on this subject.4. The plot. Now, I'll agree that while they're on the ship, we get ZERO plot, or at least very little. But, the first few scenes after that are a LITTLE better. But not much. I'll agree that most of the plot is started when we go to Tatooine. But, when people question how well displayed the 'Phantom Menace', I get ticked. They showed it well. I picked up almost instantly that Sidious was Palpatine.5. Jar Jar. He was SUPPOSED to be annoying! That's why he was!Got it, Star Wars fans? Not the best but not the worst. So shut up already!",8,1,3,29 September 2007
