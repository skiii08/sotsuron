The Blair Witch Project," Really, really bad
","This movie sucks, if you planning to see it. Don´t rent it, don´t buy it and don´t spend your money on it. It is more scarier to look in the mirror, the morning after the big party. If you want a really really bad movie, rent it. Or else run!!",1,15,28,31 October 2001
Army of Darkness," Hail to Bruce Campbell, king of the oneliners
","First of all i want to make warning, if you have a weak heart or brokens ribs. Don´t see this one, because you will laugh so much that it hurts in your ribcage. But hey, if you wanna die with a smile on your lips, see this movie. I haven´t seen the first one yet, but the second film was a really funny movie. Didn´t think that the third one, should come up with any surprises. Oh god, how wrong i was. From the very first scene, a feel great feeling is starting to bubble inside you. Bruce Campbell is just great in his role, no one could done it better. Not even Bruce Willis could done the oneliners better, Bruce is the king. Sam Raimi is one hell of director, the guy must have a very odd fantasy. But why complain, this movie is great. One more thing, after this movie i have one new favourite actor, his name....Bruce Campbell of course, well the man isn´t Robert De Niro or John Malcowitch(how do u spell his name?) but when it comes to oneliners then he´s the man. And by the way, give me some sugar, baby....8,5/10",8,1,1,20 June 2002
