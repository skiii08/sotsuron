Iron Man 3," I really like this movie
","I must say that I believe that this is the best film in the Iron Man franchise. Downey was on top of his game once again as Stark. Saw this in 3D and should say that should be the only way that this movie is viewed. An epic movie experience for an epic movie. I would really like to say that Guy Pierce's character was very convincing. Sir Ben Kingsley's Mandarin was very surprising. Other then that, I would definitely see this movie again. It was bigger then life and the action scenes really had my on the edge of my seat for the most part. If you haven't seen this movie, then go. If you have seen if and liked it, see it one more time.",10,25,42,12 September 2013
