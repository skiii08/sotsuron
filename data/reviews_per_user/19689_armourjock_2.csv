The Sound of Music," No comments can do this film complete justice
",This is certainly one of the finest family movies ever filmed. I have viewed this film in it's entirety many times and never fail to be impressed with the wonderful acting abilities of Julie Andrews and Christopher Plummer.  The children and the music have also contributed greatly to ensure that this movie will never lose it's appeal to all age groups. Number one on the 'family movie' hit parade.,10,1,7,19 May 2000
Pearl Harbor," A real Pearl
","This is a real love-story with the events of Pearl Harbor providing a fascinating back-drop. The acting of Ben Affleck and Josh Hartnett was excellent, however the portrayal by Kate Beckinsale as the nurse torn between her love for two war-time pilots is truly exceptional. Special mention for Jon Voigt as President Roosevelt.  The scene from the White House in front of all his military aides and advisors is enough on its own to recommend compulsory viewing. The actual attack on Pearl Harbor has to be seen to be believed. It just went on and on as I feel sure it did in the actual event.  It was really like being there. Although not historically accurate, I give this movie 9 out of ten.",9,0,1,8 July 2001
