Blade Runner 2049," A boring long movie
",I go to watch this movie to prove that the rating is not a lie. A very big sound and great picture are just pop out in front of my eyes. I was like 'woooaa it's cool' and the movie just begin. It is a good movie with a good storyline bad a bad execution i guess. I was sleep about 45minutes from the movie start to play. A deep sleep. And wake up because that big sound from the movie. This is the first time where i watch a movie and always checking on my watch every 5minutes just to see how long this movie will end. A boring 3hours movie.,6,1,3,25 December 2017

The Greatest Showman," I fall in love with this movie
","Actually i have been waiting for this movie since the first time seeing it in 'coming soon list'. My friend said this movie was not that spectacular to watch and it came to my curiosity. I cane to watch this and boom. I am just amaze. I don't really into musical actually but this movie have much more than just a musical. Well they sing, in every situation they facing. But still i am amaze. Been a long time seen i've seen something like circus. Where you can see the great wolverine singing and dancing and in fact with a good voice and don't forget the handsome zac efeon. I am in love with hugh jackman, again. I am in love with this movie, from the very first minute it started.",9,1,3,6 January 2018
