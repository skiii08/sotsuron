Hereditary," Great!
","I loved this movie. It doesn't rely on jumpscares witch trust me, that is REALLY REAFRESHING! Tony Colet conveys so much in her character and gives an amazing performance. The cinematography is beautiful and is incredibly unique. Peter Wolf is about the only actor I didn't like in this movie. I'm sure he is a good actor in other movies, he just wasn't good in this one. I don't want to spoil the movie for you but let's just say I highly recommend it and you should go and watch it.",8,0,1,16 April 2019
