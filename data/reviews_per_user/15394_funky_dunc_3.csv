Ali," Nothing like the real thing
","Its right to say that this film is underrated but there is a good reason for the disappointment many felt with it.  This problem is that though Smith is excellent in the role, thoroughly deserving his Oscar nomination, there's nobody on Earth who can ever be as interesting as the real Ali.For instance, the way in which the Rumble in the Jungle affair is recreated is highly impressive but watch 'When We Were Kings' and you realise that the reality was so much better.Overall then a good film hampered by the fact that it deals with living-legend subject matter.",Null,0,0,8 April 2004
A Bridge Too Far," A film too good
","A Bridge Too Far tells the story of Operation Market Garden, a campaign dreamed up by Montgomery to take a series of bridges over the Rhine that would allow the Allies to invade Germany's industrial zone and thus end World War Two by Christmas 1944.Suffice to say the mission failed and A Bridge Too Far deals mainly with the failed attempt to take the bridge in Arnhem, Holland.The film is typical Richard Attenbourgh. It has the feel of David Lean: long shots, dazzling cinematography and an epic length (over four hours). The film also features one of the most stellar casts ever. A virtual who's who of 'seventies cinema, plus a few of Dickie's luvvie mates (Olivier, Bogarde). Admittedly most are not in the film for very long but all make an impact. This is especially true of Robert Redford as he crosses the Rhine shouting 'Hail Mary, full of grace!' The two standouts though are Sean Connery and Anthony Hopkins. Connery fully convinces us that he is Roy Urquart, a battle hardened general, a million miles from 007. Hopkins is truly outstanding as a stereotypical British colonel fighting a losing battle. He shows the arrogance and self belief of the officer class and its hard to believe that he went onto be Hannibal Lector.The film offers an unrelenting view of war. Attenborough pulls no punches. The film has no Saving Private Ryan style effects but somehow is more powerful for having less gore. He also makes sure everyone involved, British, Americans, Poles and Germans, gets an equal amount of treatment. There is none of the trite patriotism that exists in other war films here.A Bridge Too Far is perhaps the ultimate World War Two film. No glorious victories, no petty heroism, just a clear document of the reality of warfare.",9,11,16,5 October 2005
Lost in Translation," A masterpiece
","Lost in Translation tells the story of two lost souls, one an aging film star played by Bill Murray and the other a newly-married graduate played by Scarlett Johansson. Both are stuck in emotional torture because of neglect by their respective spouses and both are suffering from insomnia in a Japanese five-star hotel. These common-bonds result in the two of them forming an unlikely, but electric, connection in the hotel bar. The pair then take in Tokyo together, their friendship developing brilliantly but they are never being able to take it one step further.This is perhaps the best 'indie' film of the 21st century so far. The acting is superb and Coppolla's smart script and even smarter direction put the characters across brilliantly. Ultimately the film's biggest asset is the subtlety of its stars' performances and the subtlety of its direction. This subtlety made it a let down for many people. The film was marketed as a kind of slapstick, lighthearted rom-com and admittedly the moments with the Japanese ad-men are utterly hilarious but the film is a character study. I remember expecting the former but being surprised, and delighted, when I found it to be the latter.Its a triumph for all involved. Anyone who doesn't feel moved by the 'goodbye' scene clearly has no heart, the acting is outstanding. Coppola's tight direction, and good use of music, ensures that the film never drifts into schmaltz and that real emotion is what carries us through the film.I feel sorry for all involved that Return of the King came out in the same year. If the Acadamy knew their arse from their elbow The Two Towers would have got the trilogy's Oscars, allowing this to clean up in 2003.",10,6,11,15 January 2005
