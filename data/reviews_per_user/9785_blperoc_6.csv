Minority Report," The almost perfect Sci-Fi Movie
","It is the perfect Sci-Fi movie because.....This movie has great special effects.The story is great.It is a great mystery.It has only one minor Spielbergesque weakness: That is when the guy is flying in the apartment and the flames from his jet pack cook the burgers. That was pretty lame and made me roll my eyes a bit, but other than that minor weakness it is great.I think many people who don't normally like sci-fi will still like this movie. The story is good and the sci-fi is not intrusive and only used to further the story.",9,0,0,26 July 2012
Fight Club," 13 years later, still the best movie ever made
","I have watched this movie more than a dozen times over the years. I watched it the first time in the theater. I stumbled out amazed and in awe of this incredible movie.The acting is perfect and it is a crime no Oscars were handed out to these actors. The movie has many messages, is philosophic, and yes, over the top as well.The people who only saw the violence, and nothing else, have no clue about this movie and missed the whole point.1999 was one awesome year for movies with both Fight Club and the Original Matrix movie in one year.",10,0,1,28 April 2012
The Girl Next Door," We can all change...
","That's what I like about this movie, no matter what has happened or how low you feel, you can become something better you can change and you can even find opportunity where you least expect it. If you let go of any preconceptions or judgments you'll walk away from this movie feeling good and hopeful. Yeah, Danielle was a porn star, but she was also a person. This movie deserves at least an 8.0. 6.7 IMDB rating is a crime. Watched it several times over the years.",10,2,3,14 March 2019
Interstellar," Good Movie, Worth the money, but not Great
","I was really looking forward to watching some decent sci-fi and when I was this was on at the local regal cinemas I decided to check it out. Jumped on IMDb quick and was shocked to see it had a 9.3 rating at that time...maybe it was a mistake to look at the rating, it may have pushed my expectations too high.I was expecting something 'over the top' good, and it just wasn't. The movie could have used more technology and more serious thinking and dialog. The revelation at the end I saw coming probably in the first 30 minutes of this nearly 3 hour movie.There are some good and exciting moments, and there are definitely scenes that have the cool factor, but it is not a 9.0+ movie. I give it a solid 7. It seems a lot of people enjoyed the movie a lot more than me and that is great, but this is my opinion of it.",7,5,11,10 November 2014
Silver Linings Playbook," An old school gem
","This movie has the same emotional tension that you would feel when watching 'Breakfast at Tiffany's.' The acting is fantastic. Jennifer Lawrence continues her rise as probably the best actress of this age. She may not win the Oscar this year as Jessica Chastain also had a fantastic performance in Zero Dark Thirty and I expect her to win, but I expect Jennifer to be at the top nearly every year for the next 40 years or so.The supporting cast is as good as you would expect from the known and unknown members.This movie seems to get better and better as the minutes tick by right up until the end.George and Audrey could have done no better.",9,1,4,12 January 2013
Centurion," Entertaining
","6.4 is too low for this movie. In my opinion it is easily a solid 7 if not a tad higher.I had never heard of this movie so I watched it with no expectations on netflix.If you like the sword and sandals genre you will love this movie.It is very violent. The action scenes are great and very gruesome. I would imagine though that war is always gruesome and especially so in this time.It also interesting that Neal Marshall is responsible for this. Just found out about that aspect of it. He also brought us 'The Descent' which was another very good movie that surprised me. I see he also made 'Dog Soldiers' which I'm going to watch in a bit.If the review seems thin, well I don't like spoilers, and while I will talk about a movie in general I normally refuse to give away any movie details.",7,1,4,27 July 2012
