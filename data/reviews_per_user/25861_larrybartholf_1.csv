Hereditary," Not a scary moment in the entire film
","When hearing about the movie and seeing the the trailer for the first time I was excited to be able to finally see it. When the movie started it was a little slow paced but enough to keep me interested but after about 45 minutes I started to lose interest and didn't care about the story or any of the characters. The only reason I didn't leave the theater was for the desperation of one good scare in the movie. At some point someone behind me took a phone call in the theater which I was more interested in than the movie. By the end of the movie with about 20 minutes until the end the movie sterted to get ''scary'' but at that point no one in the theater cared about the story anymore and began laughing and began laughing at the scariest parts in the movie including me and the two 8 year old behind me. By the end of the movie I heard the girl next to me say 'wtf was that' as everyone ran out of the theater as fast as they could to avoid seeing that movie ever again. The only part that I felt was traumatizing or disturbing was the naked people at the end and how much people get paid to rate this so highly. Other than escaping the early summer heatwave in an air conditioned theater, there was nothing worth paying money to be a part of....how do I get this 2 hours of my life back?",1,5,11,20 June 2018
