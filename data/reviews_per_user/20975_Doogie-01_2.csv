The Blair Witch Project," Thrilled I saw it
","Legally, I can't tell you that I saw this film in the woods - that would indicate (falsely, of course - ahem) that I had stumbled upon a bootleg CD copy.If I HAD taken it to the woods on a camping trip, I would have expected to have been frightened.  The running scene scared me a lot - I'll admit.  The crying scene has been so horribly pillaged at this point that it did nothing for me.  But overall, this didn't do for my blood pressure what I'd been looking for it to do for months.The ending was awful.  The video quality was shoddy, although this did add to the experience of the picture.  The language led this viewer to believe that much of the dialogue was unscripted and unrehearsed.  I'd give an 'A' in drama class, but the theater (or woods) experience gets a 'D.'My dish:  4/10 but I couldn't have survived without seeing it.  I'm glad I did.",Null,1,1,6 September 1999
Tombstone," No more comparisons
","I've read every comment on the Web about this film, and a disturbing majority of them compare it to 'Wyatt Earp' starring Kevin Costner.  Let's get past the comparison.Tombstone, although released in approximately the same time frame as the other, was not intended to compete.  The acting by such mega-stars as Val Kilmer, Kurt Russell, Dana Delaney, in addition to a brilliant display of direction and production led this movie to the fame it deserves and continues to receive.This movie would get the Doug Alderman '10' rating without the following: -romance between Wyatt and Josephine could've been better -Closed-captioning on the video uses the word 'nerv-i-ous-' when it actually does not appear in the script. -The three-shot shotgun messed me up in the OK Corral scene.Other than that?  No problems.  The directing during the horse battle scene near the end was UNMATCHED.  What I don't know is whether or not production directors were changed at this point, but I suspect they were.My vote:  9.98",10,0,0,5 June 1999
