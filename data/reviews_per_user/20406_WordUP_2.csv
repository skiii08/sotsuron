The Devil's Advocate," One of the ten best movies I've ever seen
","This is one of those movies that make you THINK. Not easy to digest, not serving up every conclusion on a silver platter. Not jumping to stereotypes (except maybe in the case of trial lawyers).*** Possible spoilers ahead ***Nobody but Al Pacino could have played the devil with so much subtlety and believability. He is not the all-powerful demon who can make things happen, but rather is omnipresent in the way we lead our lives. He works through seduction and his 'victims'' own will. He is suave and street-wise. A perfect cast.Not being a native of the US, I can't really comment on the accuracy of Reeves' and Theron's accents (as many posters blasted them for being unrealistic), but their acting is to the point.The semi-monologue by Pacino near the end, complete with Frankie-Boy's crooning (what a choice, eh?) was one of the best parts of this movie, and possibly of any one. If you really care to listen and understand, instead of turn off your brains and wait for more juicy bits, there is a tremendous amount of wisdom and humor in what Milton has to say.Throughout the movie, there are many wonderful subtleties in the sets, props and musical score, some of which the director will point you at in his DVD commentary.All in all, if you have half a brain and like to use it when watching a movie, go for this masterpiece (on a big screen, if possible). Just don't count on going to sleep straight afterwards. It will keep you awake - and not for the gory bits.",10,1,2,26 December 2001
Alien 3," Return to the roots
","It is beyond me why so many reviewers highly praise Cameron's Aliens and bash this one. I liked the set design of Aliens, but that is about it. Otherwise, it took away the most interesting premise of Alien, namely the fact that the creature is indestructible by conventional means and leaves everyone pit against it utterly hopeless. In Aliens a burst from a Marine's M16 (woo hoo, go USA) kills half a dozen of them. It felt like 'Dumbed-down Alien meets Arnold Schwarzenegger'. In Alien 3 we're back to the original idea of one single, nearly indestructible creature against the fears of a group of people. I much prefer this approach which allows for a type of heroism that doesn't look like a caricature of the Gulf War(s).",Null,0,2,8 May 2003
