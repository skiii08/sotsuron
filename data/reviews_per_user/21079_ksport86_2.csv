Alien 3," The most underrated and misunderstood film of all time
","I like 'Alien 3.' I really do. I can confidently say that is on my top 5 list for my favorite films.  I think that there is a specific list of reasons why people don't like the film. Since I have a limited word count, I will only explore a few. -Their gripe: the entire film is cold, dark, and depressing...too depressing for most Alien fans. =My response: What were you expecting? Bunny rabbits and candy canes? Please! The universe that this trilogy is a very dark and depressing place. Fincher (the director of Alien 3) perfectly captures it! -Their gripe: There is little action. =My response: I can understand that fans were hungry for another shoot-em-up film like 'Aliens', but the point of a sequel is to explore new ground and give the viewer something fresh and new! Why was 'Resurrection' so bad? Because it tried to combine all of the previous films into one and the result was a giant s*** ball! Alien 3 does play out like a drama, but what the hell is wrong with that? It is, by far, the most bloody and violent of the 4 films. -Their gripe: Character development sucks. =My response: Ok, first watch the new 'assembly cut' that just came out, it should stop some of your bitching. Second, the majority of the characters are convicts, and, as you will find out in the film, they are expendable, so once you know one, you basically know them all. I mean they're convicts for Christ's sakes! They're violent, loud, dirty, and crude (even though they are trying not to be). What more could you possibly want from them? The 'Assembly Cut' does give more insight to their characters, though. I really don't understand why 'Alien 3' is the most bashed film in the series, while 'Resurrection' was accepted as the finale. I know that the reason why 'Alien 3' was hard to accept was the fact that the fans were expecting another gun/marine movie and not something bold, daring, and different, which is exactly what 'Alien 3' is. If you have not seen 'Alien 3' you really should. Don't take other people opinions. Watch it with an open mind, and make your own decision.",8,178,289,15 February 2004
Collateral," Best in 2004 -- Top 5
","'Collateral' is not your average summer film. Tom Cruise and Jamie Foxx give stellar performances as Vincent the contract killer and as Max the cabbie (respectively). Can't forget Jada Pinkett-Smith as Annie! Michael Mann (one of my favorite directors) is at his top form. The story is original, the characters are very well developed and complex as is the story. The Stuart Beattie screenplay is simply awesome and it never lags at any point in time. The best part of the film is that the dialogue and action is perfectly balanced. This film doesn't have too much action or too much dialogue. Like I said before, the balance is perfect. The characters have real conversations that exposes who they truly are and what their lives really are. Tom Cruise is (again) simply perfect, but Jamie Foxx is a real surprise. He's kind of the 'it' guy of 2004. Mann shot the film in hi-def, which has a huge payoff, making the image crisp and clear (considering the entire film takes place at night). The city of L.A. seems to come alive and looks vibrant as ever (remember 'Heat?'), thanks to the hi-def. Don't miss out on this one, it is truly a masterpiece.***** out of ***** This film is stunning.",10,0,1,3 January 2005
