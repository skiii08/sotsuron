The Rock," Another sort of mission film
","Honestly, there is no surprise, no suspense, no heartbeat moment for me at all. Just like the other million of gun movies showing on every year, two agents here become our heroes.When I saw Sean Connely, there were some feeling that am I seeing 007 series. After knowing that he plays a British agent in the movie, I am definitely sure that the director shows us the prisoned James Bond. However, if you want to see the acute fight scene of him in this pic, it will be a little disappointed, after all he is an old man, how can we expect him to do well in the things belonging to youngsters. I think he has already done his best in this performance, gets to the level where an old actor should be.Here I do not want to talk about the plot, as it is a stereotype, gets nothing to tell. There are some words for our main male actor Nicol, his performance is not as good as our old man. Sometimes you can see the scary he expressed in this film seems like not real enough. Of course, some deficiency of the film can not be his responsibility, such as a professional biological chemistry expert can unexpectedly put the most toxic weapon in the sewer. Maybe I can understand if I were in his situation, but I am still feel bad about some details. To my surprise, a platoon of marine can be easily killed by an old man spending half of life in prison and just coming out.Anyway, if I get time and want to see some movies without brainstorms, this one would on my list.",7,2,2,6 July 2013
Lucky Number Slevin," 'It is never late to revenge ten years later'
","Actually, the secret behind the story is not so hard to guess. So it is not very impressive to me. However, maybe the last thing I can talk about is the story. All the gang films have the same feature I mean almost all, there will be always a guy who can draw nobody's eyes putting the trigger, and every time they will plot a perfect revenge plan, of course some of them will fail. The reason why I said the story is not good enough is because I guess the whole trick the boy plays, the only thing I missed is Bruce Willice is on his side. After that I made my mind clear and found that actually the guy Bruce plays can be anyone, even he can stand on the opposite side against the boy, it is acceptable. If the plot was like that we can just watch one more gun fight. However when I took a second thinking about it I found I destroyed the integrity of the story. Here we go, if it is not Bruce, Selvin would not get a chance meeting the boss of the gangs, so he cannot get close to his foes. So thinking like this everything makes sense.I don't know why, it is just a feeling that something is not perfect, I mean I cannot find where making me feel that this film is not a perfect one. Usually, when i saw a master piece, I can feel a strong exciting making me emotional even feel shivering or burst into tears sometime. But for this one it just finished nothing special nothing familiar happened. Also I found the leading actress is totally unnecessary in this movie, maybe without her we can feel more tense moment which I think can make this film better. Anyway, actors in the movie did a good job, also they are all very famous. One more thing this is still a creative story although I got almost everything before the truth told. LOL cheers",8,1,1,6 September 2013
As Good as It Gets," Jack you makes my 20 bucks valuable!
","Honestly at beginning I spent my 20 bucks for Helen, she is beautiful, elegant and adorable. In addition, Hunt got Oscar via this movie. However, after watching it, I think I am more lucky than before when I only went for Hunt but Jack. It is perfect for me to pay money getting a film of which both the leading actor and actress make me excited.Initially, I don't like Jack, as the most time I saw him is not in movies but on the first row of Staples Center where is the host court of L.A. Lakers. His crazy applause for Kobe Bryant annoyed as I don't like the showoffer - No.24 of Lakers. However after this movie one thing I clearly understand is you can't ignore the merits by the defects of a person. Also the guy Jack playing also make me sick, but this guy gets something making me feel good as well. Once again, it gets proof that the annoying guy also gets merits.The movie helps the communities create a harmony neighbourhood. How can you image that an annoying neighbour like Mr Udall can find his true love and the precious friendship. That's it people must get some merits no matter how badass they are. And another important thing is people are changing, so please do not judge them with your old prejudice.",10,3,4,14 September 2013
World War Z," Kind of new concept in Zombie world
","We all know Zombie comes from virus. No cure, no medicine to reduce, people who turns to a Zombie can only be killed by destroy the head (It seems Zombies respect the theory that only brain death is really died). In this new Zombie movie, the turning process is still so quick which only needs 10 seconds, even faster than this in Resident Evil. Now here not exactly same as Alice, Gerry is a normal person but with Seal training, retiring at home enjoying his family happiness. He was reluctantly convinced to take part in the action looking for the cure of the virus. He is kind of stupid, so does his wife, they tried to not go, but any guy who can brainstorm will see why they are rescued and allowed to stay in the ship. So I have to say the director waste nearly 3 minutes to explain a plot which supposed to be an obvious thing. However, from the three minutes if we consider it from the direction of Peter, maybe it makes sense. Maybe it is what the real Peter wants to say. He wants to company with his family but he could hardly let his career go. Finally he has to get back again.It is possible that this movie will have several continuations, because of Darwin's Evolution Theory. But if so, it probably will be as same as Resident Evil. So my suggestion, making some differences or let it go.",7,1,2,10 October 2013
Star Trek Into Darkness," A continue of a new Star Trek era
","I can see that the Star Trek series will get their pride back. Since the early 70's last century Star Trek has already brought us a lot of fun. Although I have to admit that it can not compare with Star War in the last century, it has already beat Star War in this new era. If you ask me to recommend a movie talking about space war or adventure, definitely I will name these two. By the way, Serenity 2005 is also pretty attractive for uni-fans.This is the second one in the new Star Trek series, there are some connection between the new era master piece and the old ones. For example, the memory about Khan will be taken back, instead of the old ugly Khan, this is a handsome vivid Khan. Also continuing the story line, some actions keep the relationship with the last episode making the series consistent rather than once a story which is sort of boring.The story is also awesome, as it not very easy to tell who is the real bad guy, at least don't worry it is not our heroes. That makes the story meaningful and attractive, and if you are a movie junkie it is impossible for you to feel tired or something else negative during the movie. The proof to support me separating the recent two episodes from the previous ones is in the end. It is also a struggling and heart pulling ending. But the hero this time is no more other species but human ourselves, it seems that the director has realised that it is only human ourselves can solve the problem perplex ourselves.",8,1,2,24 September 2013
"Crazy, Stupid, Love"," Too many issues can not be judged by ethic
","Is that right if 99 out of 100 people said it is right? Not really. Does having sex without your partner means you are not commit to your marriage? Absolutely. But does this mean you do not love your partner anymore? Obviously no. Is that possible a man sleeping with 100 women cannot find his true love? Ignorance. Believe or not, these are what this movie tells us. Please don't watch it with bias. It is a lovely film, just relax and laugh during the projecting if you don't take it seriously.I believe 90% of individuals in our communities are like Cal, going through their own small life, only struggling within office and home, never having sex with other women but the partner, still dreaming to try something beyond the red line especially when feeling unfair in daily life. However I don't believe there are many people like Jacob who can successfully sleep with different girls every couple of days. At least if these people were exist they are the very minority, I mean maybe 1 out of 10000 or less than that. After trying to think over the real life again I found actually Jacobs are not definite minority as the lost individuals are not minority. The reasons why they are lost are diversity, such as a failure of marriage like our Cal, bankrupt, getting hurt in love like Hannah and so on. Anyway they find an excuse to abuse their life, trying something new, something dreamed but never got a chance to go and something makes feel cool or can release themselves.After experiencing the fantastic new life, someone maybe turn back and plug into their life with a new and mature attitude, others maybe keep enjoying their new life without ending. In the end we see the aim of this movie of course is appealing to get ourselves back, stand in a new level to think about our life. It doesn't matter whether it is the result for everyone, it is at least a direction we should approach.",9,0,1,1 October 2013
Fast & Furious 6," As brilliant as the 5th
","Here the brilliant means many things, the pictures, the driving, the pretty girls, the cars, and the friendship.Following the last one of this series, the 6th shows us a new competition which will be the conflict between two professional criminal team rather than our drivers and the police. The plots of the 6th are awesome but also not perfect just like its brothers, however, this kind of movies aim at showing us the dazzled cars and driving skills. There is not a big flaw I can easily find during the whole projecting, maybe it is because I paid most of my attention to the sexy girls, the cars and the extremely cool driving.At least, one thing I am sure is that this kind of film would not step into the academic awards, but it can be popular among the world, can attract plenty of fans following the series year by year. That's it, no need for anything else.For the last point I mentioned at the beginning - friendship, it is the most valuable element in this kind of movie, it's not surprise that the film like this can also teach us something important. It can be a inspiration for those directors struggling in making junk every day. So, just ust think about it dude.",8,0,1,7 July 2013
Pacific Rim," Quite a fair rate by now
","7.2 out of 10 by now with one fifth million users it is a predictable rate for this movie.Unfortunately this movie didn't earn their budget back leaving a nearly 10 million deficit. It is also foreseeable as using the similar technique as Transformer but as awesome fighting scenes as its, the only consequence is paying back in box. The plot is quite simple fighting the monsters which is quite like a Japanese series used to be seen in childhood, in other words, maybe only children like it and only people want to relax without thinking too munch of movies would like pick this one. Obviously it has some plots aiming to touch the audience but it seems the effects are not very impressive.In terms of the good aspects, at least it gives a happy ending. The giant robots maybe satisfy the geeks. Also I like the perform Rinko did in this film it is definitely a Japanese performing which is very cute. She can be very serious very tough but behind that she is fragile needing a shoulder to rely on. That is also the reason why Japanese girls are good wives they are melt LOL.In conclusion it is fit for children but not for the ones too small maybe 10 years old and above. Apparently it is for box but failed. Well nothing to say but good luck to the next one.",7,11,17,7 December 2013
Now You See Me," just so so
","it's a movie not very impressive but not boring neither. From beginning to the end it successfully attracts the attentions, also the appropriate using of couple of magical shows do contributes a little bit. The only thing maybe impressed is the end that the stupid cop is the guy behind. It has some attractive scene like car chasing run cool etc. The main line seems reasonable as well. And one thing I have to say is the Franch blondy acts very well although her character has little chance to express. Comparing with these old famous Freeman and Tressler the youth do a better job, but I'm not here suspecting there acting skill maybe it is because the wrong character. Especially that I have to say Morgan you are too calm sometimes, you can't be that peaceful all the time for this character and the only moment you are dismayed is apparently pretend. Mark did a pretty good job at least in my opinion it is as till the most end I still can't say he is the guy behind. The other thing is for Isla she is still like 20 that's amazing.",7,1,2,7 December 2013
The Butterfly Effect," Nearly perfect connection!
","It seems like a movie of narration from the beginning, but I get the real line very soon and I have to say it is a master piece.Several scenes, from Evan was a little boy to he moved away with his mother, really makes me curious. The only thing I know is that Evan is a poor boy who always loses his pieces of memories now and then. I can spot that the moment he lost the memory is the time can be used by him to change his whole life. Obviously, it is not psychosis, it is kind of super power. When he get into the real things about his childhood memory, like diary or video, he can pass through the time space. And the reason why he can not remember anything sometimes before is that the future him comes back to make changes. In other words, those moments when he lost memories is the time he can come back to make changes affecting the future.The interesting thing is that not every time he comes back to childhood can change the future, it depends on what he has done. Is it amazing, incredible reasonable, and perfect connected. During the first hour, audiences will carry with many suspenses, and the last half hour, they will be shocked.Furthmore, only the perfect plot can not make this film so popular, there are also something worth to think over in this movie. Evan has changed his life for no less than one or two times, every time the consequence is not satisfied, even the last time, he need make a great sacrifice to put a stop. This makes people to think if they were Evan what should they do and what Evan did is right. In the end, at least Evan found the best way to change his life, of course,it also includes others' lives. Love in this film is no doubt the main line, everything Evan did is for that words 'I'll come back for you', and yes he did it.However, the only thing seeming like not perfect enough is that the plot is so similar with 'Back to future' (1985) that I have to suspect whether it is sort of plagiarism.Anyway, we should show respect to this film regardless of the so called plagiarism, maybe it is just a inspiration from its predecessor.",8,1,2,29 June 2013
Wreck-It Ralph," It's not only a game any more
","It is approximately 15 years ago I played the game first time. I have to say time flies. Fix-It Felix now could not be a popular game among the children but it's still in our hearts. I say this movie is amazing because it turns a sort of old boring (comparing with today's games) game into a vivid animation. In this film the game is never inferior than those new games like Sugar Rush and Hero's Duty. And it made the roles much more lovely than they originally are, especially Ralph. A bad fierce guy in the game surprisingly got a mild personality. Game is just a game, people never got a deeply thinking about it, about what could happen if the characters gain different personalities. This film did, and made them cute.The motivation for Ralph to leave his own game is very simple 'to be a hero, to get a medal'. So there is nothing perfect than Hero's Duty. However accidence happened which also gave Ralph a chance to be a real hero. Although it is only a animation, it gets not a few things deserving adult to think about. Like being reckless with greed, the ending of competing in illegal ways, what the attitude to the honesty and responsibility and so on.The whole story is complete and consistent, the plots are reasonable and creative, the roles and the voice are awesome, the picture and animation are vivid, and the emotions come from the characters are real and overwhelming. Anyway, you will not regret for your time.",8,1,2,1 October 2013
Stardust," The most emotional movie about the most fantastic love story I have ever seen for now!
","The first time I saw this movie is in 2007, when it released as well as I was still a freshman in Uni. It is an English class, not as usual, I didn't escape from the class that day, and I am sure that was the most wisdom decision I made about running away from the classes or not. Maybe for attracting students to come back to class, our English teacher surprisingly projected a movie for the rest of us. Only less than 20 of us got the opportunity to appreciate the movie (You can image how unpopular his classes are), unfortunately I was late so missing the name of the movie......One thing I can clearly remember is that it is the most attractive English class I've ever attended in that age, and I was never distracted for only a minute. The reason why I fell in love with this film, I think is because that I was still a freshman on love and I was thirst to find a true lover. However, I found I was wrong about myself when I finally found this movie and watched it for a second time three years later. I was still a undergraduated student, still single, but I had been refused by two girls, the thirsty turned a little bit to desperation. This time the more feeling I got from this movie is admiring, touchable and disappointed of myself.Our poor Tristan is the same as me at the beginning, swearing to bring the girl happiness but being played by her. It seems like I am the Tristan at the first 10 minutes, which made me strongly identify with him. I carefully watched and wanted to find some moments I can learn from to break my curse. Honestly, after watching this movie that time, I was disappointed and concluded that it is the bloodline making our poor Tristan become a prince and helping him get every thing a man fights for.Very soon, I forgot the name of the movie. Fortunately, I can hardly believe that I didn't delete this movie three years ago after it disappointed me. It is maybe my potential personality functioned and kept it for the future me. I opened the player without aware of it is that one, and this time I felt a new life come out of my mind. I finally understand that our prince Tristan is not happened to be the prince and not totally depends on the luck to get Yvaine. There are willpower and sacrifice when he steps into the unknown world to bring the star back; responsibility and loyalty when he insists to fulfill the promise; kindness and courage when he decides to save the girl, twice, once for a recognise girl and another for his true lover. Although the luck can't be overlooked, it is Tristan the young man with quite many good qualities can take the luck to happy ending.I am not disappointed, not thirsty to make a girlfriend, and I exactly know what I want and what I should do now. I will not be a lost young man any more. It is this movie help me commit to my heart, find a example learning from and teach me so many bright characteristics that I should occupy in my long rest of lifetime. Abusolutely happy ending for everyone, in the movie and in front of the screen.",10,2,3,20 July 2013
Hotel Transylvania," Your children will like it!
","The reason why I say that your children will like it is that my ten year old little friend really loves it. He is just like a ordinary boy who like to play games like to watch comics and like to talk as the curiosity of everything. We became friend because of talking, due to my poor English I can only have a wonderful chat with little kid like him, so sometimes I feel like I went back to my childhood. For this movie, I am sure he loves it as usually he probably has fallen asleep at 22:30. However that day we projected this animation for him, he stayed up to the end which is 23:30. And he was still very excited talking about the plot in the picture.It is undeniable that this is a interesting animation no matter from the way the characters talk or the story. I think each successful animation cannot be there without those good voices of characters. For this one I would vote it a perfect voice play, the voices are all what they exactly are, what their personalities exactly are and they really touch your heart. Lots of conversations are so funny that even adult like me can be moved by them.In addition, it doesn't forget to beg some tears from audiences, of course, it's because of movement rather than sadness. There are some plays can make me burst into teas, it is really overwhelming. At least, if you will cry when you see a athlete flies the flag for your country in Olympic, you will must be moved by this one.Anyway, it to some extent worth you to spend time and money to have a look.",8,0,2,12 September 2013
Taken," You'd better get a spy father
","It seems a impossible rescue at the beginning, only 72 hours against a local woman trafficking gang. The thing is you get no idea about any information about them and you need to cross the ocean which takes time as well. What I say is this success of the mission depends on too many special objective factors, in other words, the director provides the mission too many sort of lucky factors to make it successful.The girl gets a millionaire stepfather, who has a private plane. So it doesn't take too long to cross the ocean. Then it's her spy father's turn. I'm not sure if it is too lucky for Bryan or it is too stupid of the criminals that the girls phone is still there. And then what a lucky guy Bryan is again that he catches the trafficker in the airport. Or maybe they are there everyday if it is positive I have nothing to say but feeling surprise that what a dangerous world it is, keep your girls safe......What's more, another thing is the jacket. So lucky hur! Hundreds of girls there, how can he just found the girl with the jacket. And also what a special jacket it is, is that the only one in the world? The following plots are possible, only when the spy is as good as 007.In conclusion, if you just watch it as a movie, I mean just enjoy it without too much judgements, it is a pretty good one.",8,1,2,26 September 2013
Grindhouse," Surprising combination
","I have to make an apology for my voting, as telling the truth, there is no idea about what this movie is going to talk about and why the directors put them together.From the first one - Planet Terror, it is immediately recognised a 'Quentin Tarantino style'. Looking like ridiculous and mess, fulling of disgusting scenes and exaggerated blood plasma blasting. Quentin himself even performed a funny character in the film just like he always did in other movies directed by him.To the second one, actually, I don't like this type of movies. Talking too much junk without any relationship with the main idea the movie wants to express. Too many dirty words, which I don't believe is the style of American speaking. The only thing I like here is the punishment for the murder, and the performance of the Australian girl. The familiar accent made me excited, 'I tell you mate' this is very lovely, especially spoken by a girl.The last thing I want to tell is a positive comment. It is really worth to watch in the cinema. One ticket, two pictures, so why not.",7,1,4,15 July 2013
Man on Fire," Hope or no hope
","Some see hope from the movie while the others suggest that if you think deeply you will find it is actually hopeless rather than hope. In my opinion regardless of the original expectation of the director what I see from the movie regarding hope subject is hopeless.Start with the issue high frequent kidnapping, it depends on nothing but the corrupted society, only reform the regime can help. Along with the development of the drama it is found that the cops is helping and the officers are not helping but filling their own pockets. The only force citizens depending on to against crime is part of crime, so where is hope, there is only hopelessness left.Then Pita's successful rescue is due to a well trained agent in other word luck the possibility of which is one in thousand or much less. It is typical American film tie all the hope on a hero then the hero saves the world. If you come out of the film facing the realistic world, well you put you hope into wrong bank. You are gambling as stupid as gambler.Finally it seems this society has hope. There are people representing justice like the journalist and the special department officer. However after watching the sexual trade between them it needs to rethink about the justicial side. As if the justice can be bribed by sex this time it cannot make sure it cannot be bought by money or power next time.In conclusion, the emphasis of this film is not hope or justice but the heroic action. However under a dim background like this this film not only fails to show the audience hope but owe they a happy ending as well. But it is great movie it performs this way with its own reason, what is that it your turn now to see the film.",9,1,2,23 November 2013
The Iron Giant," Small animation, Big inspiration.
","Firstly, I want to say this is a beautiful story, a interesting animation, a deep thinking with its lovely dubbing. The outline of this story is clear and ordinary, but it will not let you down at any moment. Due to its almost perfect continuity and obvious but not boring plot, it is easy for children to follow and to wet their eyes, especially when our iron giant said 'Superman' and then took care the bomb; just like the plot in 'How to Train Your Dragon' (2010), it is a sacrifice in the end, however, everything will be fine at the final end.Furthermore, with this simple story which is logical but not novel, 'The Iron Giant' really teaches us something. The unknown things are always considered dangerous and scared, it is absurd and what the author wants to throw down by this film. When Hogarth helped the iron giant to get rid of the electric cable, the next day our giant show him the friendly. 'Him, not it', said by a little boy shows us a warm world although it is frozen winter in the film. 'He is like a baby', when he is hungry, he has only iron in his mind, when he find it is interesting to jump into the water, he plays like a children; 'You are not him (the machine killer), you are like superman', just like teaching a child, good teaching grows up a reasonable boy.Finally, the most worth thinking about is 'guns kill', is this a enlightenment telling giant you are a gun of killing, wake up, or a word to tell him do not be the gun killing innocence, even though you possess the power. Actually, clues for both of them can be found, but of course, the later one is what the film wants to say.Just an cute animation, too much thinking for it...... LoL!",8,0,0,14 June 2013
Identity," Role play?
","It's really a little bit weird at the beginning. I thought it is the murder transferred passing the motel. However it is and all of them are. I heard a little about this movie from my friend before, so I'm not very confused or surprised to this created story. I doubt if a man can have so many identity. Also I don't really know what the movie want to say......But I have to admit that I was tricked, as I failed to find out the real killer. I even didn't suspect the little boy. Although I was quite sure that all the guys getting together in the motel are the criminal's identities, I forget the boy, I didn't count it in. I don't know how the doctor treated him, he surprisingly makes the 10 identities together and makes them kill each other until one left.I think Rivers loves acting too much so that he puts himself into his role play too deep, I'm sure he can win an award maybe in Hollywood, but for the best director, impossible as the story is too weak, even weaker than the American scary stories.Fine get go, a quick conclusion: just so so.",7,0,0,27 September 2013
Cloud Atlas," toast to its originality!
","I have to say that it is a kind of movie easily making people confused. It is true that even to the end there are still some guys can not figure out what is going on here. Do not laugh at them unless you are brave to say you never got a piece of confused during the whole three hours. I admit that I haven't got any idea about the whole development of the story until I went through the first and half hours. Maybe that's why it gets a not so impressive score here. At least a master piece should get most of the audiences touched.For this beautiful picture, I am impressed by its small stories. I like stories in different ages, in other words, actually I love history to some extent. Especially when the plots continue in different eras and have some kind of relationship in between. Of course, that is one reason why I spent more than one hour to get clear on this movie.I can hardly remember how many stories are there, but one thing I will not forget is that those actors and actresses are same in each one. I have to say what a brilliant way to save money, LOL. Also what a incredible skill of making up. Even some small roles I can't recognise by their appearances until I saw the casting list. That's amazing, isn't it? Last thing I want to say is that something I learn from this movie, in other words the thought it wants to pass to audiences. Obviously, this one believes the other lives as well as people are changeable. I don't want to talk much about the religion things as it totally depends on individual and has nothing to debate. But the changeable person is an attitude of living, here I mean we should remember it and see others with a changing sight. So face changes bravely and live with changing every moment.",8,1,2,1 September 2013
Aladdin," A great sense of educational!
","This is a film fulling of educational information.Brave, it should be the first, without brave Aladdin cannot play the guardians as fools, he would not bring the lamp out of the hole. Of course, the prince saving the kingdom would not exist.Honest, which is also very indispensable, the second main point in this animation. Abu didn't obey the word and touch a diamond, then they almost died in the hole. Forgetting the promise, Aladdin went to doom and nearly lost everything. Being honest, as the return, it is the forgiveness we see at the end of the story.Contentment, also can be seen from the movie. The fool Jafar failed to learn this, waiting for him is the depriving of freedom the most precious thing to a life.Kindness, which I thought is the first main point showing here makes this film a awesome one. Aladdin is the one who possesses this kind of quality, feeding the street children, making justice for them, saving the princess from blade, and did not be beaten by desire. That is what I thought the most significant quality individual should have.Finally, I want to say, although it is a little bit old animation, please let your children watch it, learn from it, that's the worth of a film like this.",8,1,2,6 July 2013
The Pursuit of Happyness," No excuse to mess your life!
","It is really a hard life, and it is the struggling in this hard life makes this movie sense of tensity. Not everyone living in refuge fates to gloom for the whole life. The thing I saw from the film is a tough man, a responsible father and a clever working guy makes his every effort to survive. I kind of sympathize him at first, however after giving another thought, damn it, I was the man who should be sympathized. No matter how hard life he was suffering, how mess situation he experienced, what he is doing is nothing else but keeping going. He is really battling with the time and the life itself. What's more, he cannot only concern himself. Normal guys maybe have already go mad due to the hopeless life, but for Chris he can not lose hope, because he is the hope for his son.The picture described how a man compete with his life, change his fate, and be a real admired man. He gets a little son, fortunately, the little man is not naughty at most time. What I want to say is, for most people who under pressure like him, they are probably irritable. Maybe some of them will give up the life the family even themselves. So it doesn't matter to say you even get a child to take care. Chris makes me memorise another father who gives his son happiness even they are on the edge of death everyday, it's really a great paternal love. Here is a little hint, the movie is made in 1997 Italy.I think the emphasis of this movie is to cheer people up, maybe the director has already predicted the economic recession happening two years later. It's really helpful to hopeless people, to pessimistic individuals to cheer them up. Telling them calm down and carry on.",9,1,2,21 September 2013
