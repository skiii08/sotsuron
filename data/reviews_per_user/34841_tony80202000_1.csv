The Benchwarmers," What a great film!
","1st off, before you take my review too seriously you should know that I love Rob Schneider films, plain and simple I think the man is a comedy genius, even when he plays small parts in Adam Sandler led movies he steals the show for me.That said I wasn't a huge fan of European Gigalo, so it says something when I rate this film as funny as the likes of Dumb and Dumber and See no Evil, Hear no Evil.I literally laughed out loud at several parts of this film and Schneider wasn't even the funniest part of it, Jon Lovitz was as usual superb as were Spade and Heder, and so what if Heder played a similar role to Napoleon Dynamite, he was superb in that also! The film is essentially about 3 guys who start a baseball team to take on the local bullies, anyone who dislikes this film either has a very dry sense of humour or no sense of humour whatsoever and are better off watching a film outside of the comedy genre.If you love a laugh and don't take films too seriously then I urge you to watch this film, you wont regret it!",9,0,0,26 April 2006
