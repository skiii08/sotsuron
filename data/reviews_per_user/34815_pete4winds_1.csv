The Blair Witch Project," Well worth the hype...review may contain spoilers.
","I'm a huge fan of thrillers, to the point that I'm virtually immune from being scared at movies. Gore movies and slashers don't really do it for me, unless there's a major psychological element included. That being said, the whole Blair Witch phenomenon (specifically relating to the original movie) floored me, even long after it was revealed as a staged film.
By far one of the best movies I've ever seen, not to mention THE BEST marketing program I've ever seen or heard about. To enhance my experience, I forced myself to stay in the 'found documentary footage' mindset, and religiously followed the entire marketing package, including the Blair Witch website and 'Curse of the Blair Witch.'There are many great movies made, and many great filmmakers around, but there are very few 'true geniuses' in the film industry. The Blair Witch Project is an example of pure genius and brilliance. A truly rare treat.",Null,0,2,7 November 2001
