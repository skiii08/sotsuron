First Man," Intense and Dark, but a Solid Period Piece
","A dark and gritty look at the lives of the men and women behind NASA during the space race and what they sacrificed in the name of space travel. Shot on film and with sound design so carefully crafted that you feel the rocket will fall apart at any second, it's an intense experience that truly makes you feel like you're a witness to these event. It's not as 'fun' as I think audiences expected, but it will stand the test of time as a classic period piece.",9,1,3,28 November 2018
A Star Is Born," Great in All Aspects...Except the One That Really Matters...
","Great acting. Great directing. Great cinematography. Great editing.
BUT!
(Deep breath...)
A movie can only be as good as it's story. I don't buy their initial flirtation. I don't feel that they learn anything or grow as people. There are a few logic issues as well.
Furthermore, I find that the film leans too heavily on music for manipulating audiences emotions. Put a powerful Lady Gaga song at the end of any film and people will be moved to tears, regardless of genre.",6,1,2,28 November 2018
A Star Is Born," An Expertly-Crafted Okay Story.
","The directing, cinematography, music, and, especially, acting are flawless in this modern update of the classic story. There's a nice infusion of humor in there as well. But a movie can only be as good as its script.And therein lies the problem: the story isn't very good. It's engaging and fast-paced, but one question lingers in the mind of the viewer once the credits roll: 'What was the point?'Nobody learns anything in this film. No one grows as a character. Is there commentary on society? Yeah, a little bit.The ending is emotional, but I believe the overabundance of music is manipulative in that sense. I would have preferred stronger character arcs.",6,2,7,16 November 2018
Se7en," No Masterpiece, But a Good Ol'-fashioned Mystery
","The mystery genre has died out of late, so 'Se7en' remains unchallenged as one of the top mystery films of the last 25 years.Its twist is good, but does not rank amongst cinema's best (where I would place 'Ghost' and 'The Usual Suspects').My biggest qualm is that Pitt and Freeman are terrible detectives! They fail to accomplish anything of note in the film, which makes one wonder why they are being given the hardest case in the precinct.",8,0,0,16 November 2018
Aquaman," A Visual Marvel
","This film is worth watching for the remarkable production design alone. It is not an easy feat to make a film where half of the action takes place underwater, but here Aquaman excels. Gorgeous visuals, incredible underwater battle sequences, and well-choreographed fights make this film impossible to look away from.That said, the plot is fairly basic. Reluctant hero, doomed mentor, unexpected love interest, bad guy who wants to take over the world, etc. Aquaman is surprisingly likable, much different from his closed-off Justice League persona, but he's not particularly clever. He kind of just goes with the flow, punching bad guys as he goes. There are various attempts at injecting humor into the script, but its not very smart - especially compared with the witty comic brilliance of the recent Deadpool, Guardians and Ant-Man films.One aspect of the film that was done surprisingly well was Black Manta's origin story. Not that he has much competition, but he's the best DCEU villain we've met thus far.",7,7,12,4 January 2019
Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse," Will Blow You Away
","Wow. This was a feat on multiple levels.
(1) The animation style - I've never seen anything like it. While it takes a bit getting used to, the animation makes you feel like you're reading a comic book.
(2) The story - My biggest concern going in was how the filmmakers would explain the concept of multiple parallel universes to audiences without bogging down the plot. Somehow...they did it
(3) Honoring Spider-Man - despite none of the spider-people being the Peter Parker shown in other films, there was an element to each character that made one feel that they were, indeed a Spider-person. The cameos and references to Spider-Man canon made the film especially fun for longtime fans.
(4) A Good Movie - It's a refreshing take on not only Spider-Man, but the superhero genre as a whole. It's got comedy, drama, action and heart.Lord & Miller have done it again!",10,1,2,28 December 2018
Incredibles 2," Funny, Relatable, but Weak Antagonist
","The second installment of The Incredibles is full of the laughs and relatable moments which made the first so good, but struggles to find a worthy antagonist.",8,2,4,29 November 2018
