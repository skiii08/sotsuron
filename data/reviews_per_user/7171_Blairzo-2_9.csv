Ali," good, but not great
","first off....too long. Period.  40 minutes should be taken off to bring it in at an even 2 hours. As pragmatic a person (and star) as Ali was...the ongoing saga of his life between the years 1964 to 1974..often left me bored, waiting for and wanting some adrenalin to set in.  It just couldn't hold my interest throughout...which is why I thought it would be more entertaining if it was 2 hours long and not 2 hr. 40 minutes.  That being said..I thought Will Smith did a good job in the role, although at times I found it hard to imagine him on screen, as the character he was portraying.",6,0,0,28 December 2001
Closer," negative and disturbing
","if you're into movies that concentrate on the intricacies of infidelity, guilt manipulation, human fealty, disrespect for and lack of commitment in a marriage...then this film is for you. I found the whole theme very negative and disturbing, promoting infidelity and lack of respect and commitment in marriages..just what we need to view more of in our current era and generation of high divorce rates and adultery. Just about everyone reaction around me was negative upon the movies conclusion..one woman commenting that the only good thing about the whole film was the soundtrack. The acting overall was pretty good and as bizarre as the story plot was...each of the four were very believable in how they would describe their emotions. However, if I had known ahead of time that the entire content of this story revolved around cheating and guilt manipulation...I would have passed. You certainly won't leave the theatre uplifted. many I'm sure, leave filling a lot of guilt of their own..which maybe was the intent of it all.",3,0,1,29 December 2004
Terminator 3: Rise of the Machines," A Total Blast!!
","This film will blow you away; the sound, the effects...total action plus a bit of comic relief here and there, make for a fabulous sci-fi movie experience..even if you haven't seen Terminator 1 or 2. Highly recommended..kids and adults alike (or those that can get into this sort of thing). I rate it a 9 out of 10",9,0,0,5 July 2003
School of Rock," Jack Black Rocks!!!!
","just great entertainment!! If you're from that era when good hard rock was king (70's early 80's)...you'll love the reminising!! Not to mention the 'passion' that Jack Black puts into this role!  He's a rock and roll maniac! Reminds me of a part I could imagine Jim Carry in...Black is that good and that wild and crazy! A definite 9 out of 10...for shear fun, laughs and entertainment",9,0,0,19 October 2003
Where Eagles Dare," 'Unrealistc'
","Frankly....other than the fabulous on location shooting of this film, I found the whole thing to be overly long and slow moving and with somewhat of a weak script (considering the acting talent of those involved).  Most of all though for a war/espionage type movie it just didn't come across as very convincing or realistic to me.  It all looked too easy or staged.  I'd rate this a 6...at the VERY most",6,4,9,18 March 2000
Any Given Sunday," On any given Sunday....there's got to be film better than this!
","I found the whole premise of this movie to be somewhat predictable and contrived, from the get-go. I also did not find Pacino looking very comfortable in this role as a head coach. Although (as he always does), he demonstrates his  usual 'intensity' into the part..it just wasn't convincing for me. Cameron Diaz as the owner??...come on! Overall...I gave this movie a 6, which in hindsight is overly generous.",6,0,0,8 October 2000
The Sixth Sense," good...but not great
","Overall, I found this film to be slow moving throughout. However, the plot is intriging and the film has a most definite 'errie' feeling and this was telegraphed well to the audience.  Perhaps my expectations were higher than the delivered product. That being said though, the ending is a good one; quite surprising and thought provoking, which saved my vote from being any lower. I gave this movie 7 votes.",Null,0,0,8 August 1999
Munich," a drab somewhat slow moving account
","...of what I'm sure is a good adaptation of events that occurred specifically after this horrific event. So in that sense, I'm sure our famous director deserves praise for his efforts in bringing 'Munich' all together in realistic fashion and with no 'embroidery' to it's content. I just found there was not enough dramatics, suspense or excitement in the aftermath plan, to hold me in my seat with anticipation of things to come. The men involved certainly wern't technical marvels nor did they appear overly confident in following through their mission..all which lost the spark for me in recreating the events. I guess one goes in to these pictures thinking the way Hollywood makes spy and intrigue movies with all it's special effects, huge dramatic action sequences twists and turns etc. etc. You won't find a lot of this in Munich...nor probably should you. It's an interpretation of events that took place after wards..and I'm sure this is realistically how it was. Just don't go in to the movie expecting a 'Black Hawk Down' or 'Mission Impossible III'. You'll be quite disappointed. If it moved a bit quicker and, was 30 - 40 minutes shorter, I'd of given it a higher score than 5.",5,3,13,28 December 2005
The Thin Red Line," 'Saving Private Ryan' it isn't!
","Great scenery and some decent battle scenes (albeit, somewhat long and drawn out ones)...I gave this film a '6' I found the movie overall, too long and draggy, with so many useless cameo appearances by some decent actors...why even bother!  I mean, one scene for George Clooney in a nearly 3 hour film??  It simply can't compare to Saving Private Ryan in any department...too bad, I had hoped for so much more but instead...found myself on 2 or 3 occasions nearly falling asleep!",6,0,0,15 January 1999
