The Lobster," Worst one ever
","Maybe it's because I did not understand the idea of the film, but come on. What a waste.Horrible film and boring like hell. I even watched the whole film. I won't get these two hours again.I think the film started in a very strange matter. Okay, film's have started strange before and still been good, but this one. Not in a hundred years.I wanted to see the whole film, because it just had to become better. There had to be a finish. Nonetheless it's another film where you have to think yourself. What will happen next? 1/10.",1,5,7,25 December 2016
