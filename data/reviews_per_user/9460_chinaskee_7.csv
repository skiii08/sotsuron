Catch Me If You Can," Entertaining, but hard to believe
","If this wasn't based on a true story I would have thought it was just the figment of some screenwriter's imagination but it is based on a true story so it obviously must have happened.  The real Frank Abagnale, Jr. must have been 10 times slicker than Leonardo because the character as he portrays him wouldn't have been able to con me out of so much as a dollar bill and the FBI agent that Tom Hanks plays isn't too bright. How he ever let Abagnale get away from him as many times as he did is beyond me, but then again, based on recent news the FBI appears to be about as bright as Barney Fife so I guess they really did let this kid slip through their fingers on more than one occasion and make fools out of them all.",5,0,7,15 August 2003
Fight Club," One of the Stupidest Films Ever Made
","I saw this film at a free preview about a week before it was released and two years later I can still remember how angry I was wasting an evening on this drivel.The whole premise that these guys can't feel any emotion unless they're beating the hell out of each other is ridiculous and boring.I can't remember one thing I liked about this movie.Not the script,none of the performances,the editing or cinematography,nothing.Maybe this film taps into the current anarchist views and aspirations  of whatever generation we're up to,but who cares?If there was a  score lower than one,I wouldn't hesitate to mark it on my ballot.",1,28,63,10 June 2001
The Rookie," Standard Baseball movie
","If you're easily inspired or you're a couch potato who's too lazy to live out your own dream and would rather live vicariously through somebody elses dream then I guess this is your movie. This is the kind of film that Hollywood excels in these days- well shot, well-acted and utterly predictable. For those of you who think this is one of the greatest baseball movies of all time do yourself a favor and rent a copy of ' The Pride of the Yankees' starring Gary Cooper. It is the greatest baseball movie of all time and nothing before or since has even come close.",5,0,3,28 August 2003
Ocean's Eleven," Doesn't work
","How you can shoot a movie on location in Las Vegas and not even come close to capturing the feel of the town is beyond me, but Steven Soderbergh and company have managed to do just that. I know I'm in the minority here but this is mediocre filmmaking at best. It's badly cast with lousy dialogue and a score that doesn't fit the story. The leisurly pacing of this movie is all wrong for Las Vegas. This film is just plain bad.",1,13,25,23 December 2001
Mulholland Drive," An Enigma Wrapped in a Enigma that ultimately leads nowhere.
","Although this movie revolves around the characters of Betty Elms and Rita,there is also the character of the director Adam Kesher,whom I think David Lynch has modeled on himself,who plays an important role here.This entire film is an indictment of what is wrong with Hollywood;the vultures that Adam Kesher has to deal with in order to get his work produced, and the whole illusion of Hollywood that swallows up young innocents like Betty Elms, who end up not even knowing who they are anymore after a few weeks in town.All in all this a fun movie to watch, with some very dark elements.Certainly not Lynch's best work; he has tackled the battle between good and evil to better effect in films like 'Blue Velvet',but still an interesting mystery that sort of kind of resolves itself at the end,except it really doesn't.",6,0,0,14 October 2001
Life Is Beautiful," A Triumph of The Human Spirit *Possible Spoiler
","I was reluctant to see this film as for the life of me,I couldn't see how anyone could find anything funny about the Holocaust.But this film is much more than a comedy.It is probably one of the finest films ever made.Yes,there are moments of humor,but the humor is Begnini's way of dealing with the horrors that have befallen him and his son.The ending when the little boy finally wins his tank will break your heart.If you missed this film in the theaters,by all means rent the video and watch it.You won't be disappointed.",10,1,3,9 June 2001
All Quiet on the Western Front," Greatest anti-war film of all time
","Although made over 70 years ago, Lewis Milestone's ' All Quiet on the Western Front' is the greatest anti-war film of all time. There isn't a single false moment in this entire film.  This is the quintessential film that shows the idiocy of war. War is all about a group of old men sending their youth to die for a cause that has nothing to do with anything. None of these young German soldiers have the foggiest idea why they're being sent to fight and this film captures that  spirit. War sucks and 'All Quiet on the Western Front' conveys that feeling in a way that no war film has captured since. 100 years from now (if man is still alive) this film will still be the greatest anti-war story of all time. It should be required viewing of everybody.",10,2,3,21 May 2002
