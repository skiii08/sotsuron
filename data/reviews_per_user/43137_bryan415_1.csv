The Hangover," Hands down one of the funniest movies I've ever seen!
","This movie is hands down the raunchiest and one of the funniest movies i have ever seen. From the beginning of the movie right up to the end it is consistently funny, there really are not any slow parts to this movie because they are on a constant journey and race against time. And just when you thought the movie couldn't get any funnier the last 30 seconds of the movie slaps you across the face. I literally was laughing so hard I cried.. I walked out of the theater feeling hungover from an overdose of laughter, great time! Nothing more to say, spend the money to see this and you won't regret it!",10,23,42,7 June 2009
