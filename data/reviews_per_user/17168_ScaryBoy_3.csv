The Blair Witch Project," The best horror movie ever made
","The above statement is no lie. The Blair Witch Project was absolutely magnificent from start to finish. It replaces Scream as my favorite horror movie, even though they are too totally different to compare to one another. The performances in Blair Witch are totally convincing and amazing. I have always heard the phrase 'Just keep telling yourself it's only a movie . ..', but I never really knew what that felt like -- until now. Seeing the looks on the actors' faces, it felt like you were there with them and you could totally identify with them. The three actors were excellent, with emotions ranging from humor to sorrow to sadness to fear to utmost horror. Heather Donahue especially does well with her character undergoing the most significant change, but Mike Williams and Josh Leonard are good too. The scares are more subtle in this film than in your usual thriller - there is no clanging musical score to let you know when the scares are coming. The uneasiness starts off slow, with the film throwing us off-balance early on with a great deal of humor. But gradually the terror becomes more and more apparent, and you feel more and more like grabbing hold of the nearest person and not letting go until it's all over. And what an ending - several people have said it's not clear enough what happens, but I disagree. I think it is good just the way it is. By the finale you are totally run ragged, and it ends perfectly. I think everyone should see this movie. Forget about the cliches of I Still Know What You Did Last Summer; the real deal in horror movies is this amazing film. 11/10",10,2,3,1 August 1999
Scream 2," What's YOUR favorite scary movie sequel?
","Scream 2 is unfortunately not as good as Scream, but then again how could it be? It's a sequel, and of course, sequels by their nature are inferior films, as Randy says. But anyway, it tries very hard and mostly succeeds. It is very good, and parts of it are as good as Scream, just none are better. (Gale's chase scene in the recording studio, and the cop car scene, are almost there, but not quite.) The new members of the cast are less entertaining as their predecessors, but the focus is on Sidney, Gale, Dewey and Randy for the most part, leaving the others with smaller parts. But they are still good: Jerry O'Connell in particular overshadows Skeet Ulrich, who for some reason girls find attractive and talented. Elise Neal (Hallie) can't beat Rose McGowan, but she is still delightfully spunky. Timothy Olyphant is downright bland as Mickey, compared to the over-the-top Matthew Lillard. Anyway, the in-jokes have increased, and they are still funny, but the tone doesn't hold out through the whole movie. Late in the film, the plot weighs it down and it forgets to be funny. The scares are still there though. The only other complaint is that the killer(s) is underwhelming and doesn't live up to the shocking ending to the first one. But oh well. There's always Scream 3. . . 9/10",Null,0,0,16 March 1999
Scream," What's YOUR favorite scary movie?
","Oh my God. Words cannot describe how wonderful this movie is. Everything about it is top-notch: the acting is three-dimensional, convincing, and charming; the scares are potent and chilling; the laughs are hilarious and common. Neve Campbell turns in a star-making performance as Sidney Prescott, who is not your typical 'big-breasted girl who can't act who's always running up the stairs when she should be running out the front door'; Sid is a tough cookie, and she faces off against the killer with admirable strength. Likewise her friends are not typically bland oversexed teens who merely exist to be butchered in all sorts of gory ways. Jamie Kennedy plays Randy the film geek, who has one of the largest followings in all of filmdom; the character is an amazing, wonderful creation. Rose McGowan is now more commonly known as Marilyn Manson's better (if not more normal-looking) half, but before that, she was known as Tatum, the perky blond sidekick to Sid with a sassy mouth, a saucy wit, and a bod for sin. Yummy. And Matthew Lillard is maniacally perfect as Stu; his wild eyes, goofy face, and squealy voice make him a memorable addition to the Scream family. Then of course there's Gale and Dewey, played by now real-life sweethearts Courteney Cox and David Arquette; Cox is awesomely bitchy as the backstabbing reporter with a knack for ticking people off, and Arquette is sincere and charming as Gale's total opposite, a small-town deputy with an aw-shucks attitude. But enough about the characters - the in-joke references are great too. Everything from Halloween to The Town that Dreaded Sundown is mentioned and/or made fun of in this film; it's like the end-all, be-all for every horror movie ever made. But the best part is that it is completely scary and completely funny at the same time. What other movie do you know that can do that? Well, other than Scream 2, of course . . . I give this movie 10/10.",10,0,0,16 March 1999
