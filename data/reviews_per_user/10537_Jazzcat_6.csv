The Devil's Advocate," A Journey Into Primal Terror
","Devil's Advocate kept me awake. I mention this because it is so  unusual. I find that most of what people call 'horror' on film to be  laughable. I did not laugh at Devil's Advocate. It was disturbing.  The subject of evil and terror is so well handled. This movie preys  upon your deep, primal fears. The shadow that has no source. The noise  with no explanation. The sense of evil that flickers at the edge of  your awareness, but is gone before you can identify it.  The Devil is not your typical 'horns and pitchfork' caricature. Al Pacino portrays him masterfully as suave, witty, sophisticated, and  utterly evil. He plays with the minds of men for his amusement, and has  them killed without hesitation.  . But the movie is still well worth watching. Make no mistake, this  movie will have an impact.  Just be prepared to leave the lights on when you go to bed.",Null,2,4,30 October 1999
Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," C'mon George! You can do better than *this*!
","Phantom Menace was so sad.  To see the great George Lucas fall from glory, and hit bottom hard enough to write this pointless, sorry movie.  What happened to the humor of the original series?  The clever one liners?  What happened to the vibrant characters, the tight plotting.  What happened to the *love* that George put into the first and third movies?!  Where did that soaring imagination go??  It seems that George just lost heart when making this Star Wars.  He didn't seem to care enough to do it right.  Phantom Menace should have been buried before it ever saw the light of day.",4,0,1,1 November 1999
The Shining," Be seduced by The Shining
","Stanley Kubrick wants to seduce you.  He wants you to get real close, drop your defenses, so he can SCARE THE LIVING HELL OUT OF YOU!That's what Shining does so well.  It seduces you.  If you let it, it will envelope you in pure psychological terror.  Some have missed this point, and instead have been caught up with technical flaws (it wasn't faithful to the novel, the acting was overdone, cliched, or just awful, etc)  These people were not willing to be seduced by Kubrick's vision.Put aside your rational mind.  Be seduced by the dark side of The Shining.The Shining is first and foremost cinematic art.  If you look too closely at individual details, you will see flaws.  But like a work of great abstract art, the beauty isn't in the details, it's in the entire picture.  In The Shining, the moments of Kubrick genius far outshine (forgive me :) the minor flaws.*Warning* The following paragraph contains a spoiler from one scene in the movie.Everyone seems to have their favorite moment of terror.  For me, it was when the young boy turns the corner in his Big Wheel and runs right into the twin girls standing in the hallway.  They look so solemn.  They start chanting 'Come and play with us Danny....' then the screen flashes with scenes of these girls lying in that same hallway, 'forever....', you see the axe, 'and ever....' blood is splattered on the walls, 'and ever....'  and parts of their dismembered bodies lay on the floor.**SHUDDER**!!!",Null,0,0,8 July 2000
Amadeus," A Stunning Achievement.
","Amadeus is simply one of the best movies of all time.The music of Amadeus Wolfgang Mozart overshadows the entire production.  It blends perfectly.  The acting is superb.  The direction is flawless.  The sets and period costumes, stunning.Amadeus is nearly Shakespearian in it's deft portrayal of the Royal Viennese Court Composer, Soliare, who descends into a jealously so intense, it leads him to ruthless betrayal, murder and madness.  Then there is Mozart, the object of Soliare's all-consuming envy.  A brilliant musical genius who is haunted by guilt and insecurity driven into him by his father.  In the end, Soliare plays on Mozart's deepest fears, orchestrates his doom, and composes his untimely demise.  His most ambitious work, by far.  I think he would agree.",10,3,7,30 October 1999
Where Eagles Dare," The Nazi's were blind, deaf, and totally incompetent.
","At least, they were if you believe this movie.  The premise for Where Eagles Dare has real potential.  But this is pure Hollywood stupidity folks. 
The two main Allied agents waltz through their mission, killing Nazis with ridiculous ease, while casually strolling through a hail-storm of bullets. Never once do you get the impression that the heros of this movie are in any danger of death or of failing to complete their mission, despite the supposedly incredible odds against their success.  This makes for a painfully boring movie, completely lacking in suspense, but abounding in absurdity.For me, the worst crime of this movie is the way it trivialises the Allies' bloody struggles and hard won victories over the Germans during WWII.  The final verdict?  Even Colonel Klink would have been insulted.  Nuff said. 
But if you want the dirty details... (Warning! Possible spoilers and (definite) rants follow.) 
Where else but in Hollywood could a group of British covert agents openly and casually discuss their plans for infiltrating the most heavily guarded Nazi fortress in Germany while sitting in a German pub filled wall to wall with Nazis? (Hello?!) Where but Hollywood could a British and American agent stand unconcealed atop a trolley hundreds of feet above the ground, travelling into the heart of this very fortress, and *not* be seen by the trolley guards, who seemed to be determined to look in every direction except the one from where the trolley is approaching?  Where else would a Nazi guard, *knowing* that Clint Eastwood is an American agent, fall for his extremely lame 'I need to tie my shoelace' (!?!) line, while travelling in a car!  (Germans know the importance of properly tied shoelaces while sitting in an automobile!) Where else can a single Allied agent (Clint Eastwood, of course) hold off hordes of Nazi soldiers single-handedly?  Not only that, but casually pick up a Nazi grenade tossed at him, and throw it back at the Nazis, taking his time in doing so, whereupon it promptly explodes?  (Were these German grenades designed only to kill Nazis?)  Then, when the plot demands it, a single Gestapo officer orders both of our heros to drop their guns, and they do so promptly, despite the fact that they both have two machine guns to his one Luger and Nazi officers as hostages to boot. 
I'm sure there is more of this incredible stupidity to report, but I couldn't bring myself to watch more than half of this absurd movie.",3,31,60,3 March 2000
The Matrix," Thank You, Wachowski Brothers!!
","After so many dreary, campy, B grade sci-fi movies, I am so thankful that the Wachowski brothers came out with The Matrix.  It is a futuristic cyber-thriller that is smart, sophisticated, stylish, dark, and moody.  The cutting-edge visual effects are awesome!  The story is gripping!  The pacing flawless!  The acting excellent! Whoa.See it!  It's the best thing since Blade Runner.  The Wachowski brothers are the ones to watch!",Null,0,0,30 October 1999
