Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," Great Start To A New Trilogy
","The Phantom Menace has set up the next two films very nicely. This is the first film in a series of three that will focus on Anakin Skywalker; later known as Darth Vader. Our first glimpse of Anakin shows us that he is a very daring boy, yet has some fear inside of him. Can I see the dark side coming on? Fans of Star Wars may say this movie is too childish with characters like Jar Jar Binks populating it, but George Lucas did this in order to contrast the other two movies with this one. (Possible Spoiler Coming Up) This one was meant to be cheerful, while the other two will be a lot darker as Anakin turns to the Dark side and the fall of the Republic takes place. The Phantom Menace is another great addition to the Star Wars epic series, and has captured the souls once again of the old, and of the young.",Null,1,2,19 May 2002
Friday Night Lights," Hits Home
","Friday Night Lights is a movie about a High School football team located in Permian, Texas. In Texas football is not just a sport, it is life. From the first day of pre-season everyone knows that anything short of bringing back the state championship will be viewed as a failure. The acting in this movie is good and brings a lot of emotion to the story. It is heartbreaking to see how the players lives are affected by the pressures put on them every day because they play for Permian. This could be on of the best sports stories ever told; I highly suggest checking it out. It will suit everyone's fancy. The soundtrack is great, with the music fitting every moment of the film. The football scenes are also fantastic. I gave the film eight stars.",8,0,1,19 October 2004
Black Hawk Down," Good Film For A Horrible Event
","Black Hawk Down was one of the first to jump back into the know worn-out War Genre. Over the past year their has been a flurry of war movies and more to come. It's like John Wayne is back! Black Hawk Down did a good job conveying the sense of urgency and sadness of war, but what it did not do was tell us much about the enemy. All the watcher gets is that the Somalian's are evil and that they want to kill the good old G.I's. However, Black Hawk Down did a tremendous job putting that real-time crisis onto the silver screen. They filmed it as war is seen and got across the honor of war, not just the horror's. Overall this film was a nice break from the trend and a good patriotic boost after September 11th.",Null,0,0,19 May 2002
The Matrix Reloaded," 'Free your mind'?
","You enter the movie theater on wendsday night looking around the crowd. Everyone is excited. There is even some guy in a trenchcoat trying to look like Neo. As the movie starts you can not help but feel amazingly excited for this movie. Then it starts.Do not worry 'The Matrix Reloaded' does not dissapoint. Yet it somehow doesn't give you what you want. The brothers throw so much action and CGI at you that you begin to wonder why they are doing this. The movie keeps on talking about freeing your mind, and all it does is show you the same thing over and over again like you are in Plato's cave allegory.Do not get me wrong. 'The Matrix Reloaded' will be viewed as an amazing film just because it follows 'The Matrix.' Yet some people will say it doesn't give you that sense of awe as the first one did. You must see it more than once to fully appreciate.",6,0,0,15 May 2003
