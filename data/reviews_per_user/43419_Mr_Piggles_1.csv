The Avengers," Very fun, but overall - just more 'fluff'
","So i finally got to see this earlier today after weeks of hearing about how great it is and how its breaking box office records... blah blah blah. I watched the trailer (several times) and thought it looked like 'fun', then it opened and people were saying how much of a 'great film' it actually is - so my interest started to grow from 'will watch it at some point' to 'i need to see what the fuss is about' - and thats what i did this morning.All the characters work out great, especially the sparring relationship between Thor and The Hulk, as well the bickering between Captain America and Iron Man.Direction wise... meh... by the numbers with a budget this big and the resources available with that sort of money. However it's the films script that really shines. So tightly written there's no throw-away dialogue.I think what people have gotten so excited about is the 'eye candy' over anything else and this film is beautiful to look at - but looks fade very quickly and this will soon be added to the pile of CGI heavy films that look kinda dated and hammy compared to the 'next big thing' Overall. Nice to look and a great script, but lacks the weight and enduring impact it should have. I understand Iron Man 3 comes out next year and that will no doubt eclipse the memory of this. Like i said in the title. It's just more 'fluff'.6/10",6,2,6,23 May 2012
