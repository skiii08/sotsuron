The Ring," A very well-crafted supernatural scare!
","I watched the movie and I got to say, HOLY S--T!! It was a great Ghost Story, which actually involved thinking, cause of the mysteries behind the video tape. Naomi Watts held my interest through out the movie, she did a good job, trying not to lose her mind with her spooky kid. I don't want to give the whole movie away, but just when you think everything is all right with the world, WRONG!! something changes, and throws you off, BIG TIME!! Everyone go and see this movie, you won't be disappointed. 10 out 10 stars.",10,0,0,2 November 2002
