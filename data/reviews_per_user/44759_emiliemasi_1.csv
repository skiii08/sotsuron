Hereditary," Hmm not a fan
","I love my horror movies/ psychological thrillers, however I was a bit disappointed with this one. Although the acting from collet was AMAZING, I walked out thinking how disappointed I was and was expecting something more. I'd still r commend seeing it as I see others have given 10/10 stars, however, this just wasn't for me.",2,5,12,16 June 2018
