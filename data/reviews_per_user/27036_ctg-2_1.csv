The Blair Witch Project," A lotta hype, no fright
","Before I saw this movie, I read the reviews posted by fellow IMDB users. Since reviews were mixed, I sat down and watched this movie with an open mind.I should've just gone to bed.I didn't find this movie the least bit frightening.  It dragged on and on for what seemed like an eternity, culminating into a supposedly tense last 10 minutes.  Nationwide critics have reported this movie as:'..Creepier than...the Exorcist'...Uh, no'Absolutely terrifying'....Nope, wrong againAbsolutely terrible?  Well, that's a bit warmer.  The acting was unremarkable, though I've read that most of it was improvised.  The plot foundation was good, though the implementation sadly falls short of what it could've been.Overall, I give this movie 2 stars out of a possible 10.  It would've been better if Jason Vorhees (Friday the 13th) had jumped out of the woods and slashed them to death.",Null,0,1,9 December 1999
