The Hangover," Over hyped and over rated.
","After the reaction that this film created I thought that it was about time I watched it - two years after its release. The name of the film made me believe the humour would be entirely predictable and probably a bit too crude. I was expecting to see the best comedy of the past decade because of people's amazement when I could say 'I have never seen 'The Hangover' and I can now say that I don't regret my rather late viewing of the film.I was disappointed by the film's humour, there were too few 'laugh out loud' moments and I thought that because of this the film just seemed to drag on and on. I would not call it boring, but I would certainly call it mediocre.The acting was of a fairly decent quality, Bradley Cooper seems to have come out of nowhere, although I seem to be the only person who remembers him from 'Wedding Crashers'. I have never particularly liked him as an actor, partially because of his arrogant presence on the screen, and this, for me, it a problem in the film. I found the other two of the main characters to be fairly sound, and seeing Heather Graham was a breath of fresh air. It was nice to see her in a major(ish) film, her first since 'Austin Powers: The Spy Who Shagged Me' over ten years ago.While the above is for the most part fairly negative, it was still a film that you could watch from start to finish while not feeling bored at its end. My particular part was a certain cameo appearance which was probably the highlight of the film, as this made the fairly crude humour to be more ridiculous and entertaining, which was definitely needed.All in all, 'The Hangover' is worth a watch, but don't expect to see the best comedy of your life, because realistically it is not better than most of the other comedies coming out at the moment.",Null,3,6,20 July 2011
Iron Man 2," Action scenes are good, and that is just about it...
","Everyone likes action in a film, in fact, many people dislike films with no action. Therefore, Iron Man 2 takes full advantage of how much people like action in films (as Transformers 2 did). But, if I am honest, the action was the only good part of the film.For a start, if anything there is too little action, it is almost as if, the film makers were in a rush to get through them, the final action scene for example, did let the film down a bit. Mickey Rourke (who potentially could have been excellent) was not taken to full advantage in the film, in the final scene, he is killed in a matter of seconds, the fight was almost effortless.And this 'effortless' fighting seems to continue throughout the film, the viewer never gets the impression that Iron Man can die, and when he was closest (the power source thing in his chest that was slowly killing him)to death, he quickly finds a solution preventing it.And so, the highlights of the film were the action scenes (even though they were limited), the scenes with Mickey Rourke and the scenes with Scarlet Johansson (come on, we all know why she was given a role).And so, the film was quite disappointing, however, it did have its moments, it is worth a watch.",6,1,2,8 May 2010
Barry Lyndon," A Hidden Gem from Kubrick
","It is a shame that Kubrick is only remembered for Eyes Wide Shut, A Clockwork Orange and the Shining to name a few. While more 'die hard' film fans will be more aware of his other films, Barry Lyndon is a fantastic film.From what I know, it is relatively historically accurate. I am not going to be pedantic and study every last detail and then announce 'wait a minute, in the 18th Century a soldier would not have been awarded that medal' because that is not the point. The basics are right, and that is all that is needed. The way in which the armies march forward in lines is entirely correct, and how while individual men are shot down, the rest stay in perfect formation. The battle scenes are certainly a highlight. Purely because of the vivid costumes and the scale, Kubrick really makes a spectacle.The decadence of the society that Lyndon has been able to become a part of is also really emphasised the the costumes, the film won various awards for the quality of the costumes in 1975. The elaborate dresses worn by the women to the tail coats of the men are all so finely detailed, there is always something to be in awe of.The acting is also as good as the costumes. Michael Hordern is flawless in his role as the narrator. Which is a good thing too - considering that the film is well over three hours in length! Horderns clear, yet powerful voice keeps you on the ball with the plot if you struggle with films that are any longer than two hours. Ryan O'Neal, despite being American does not struggle to put on the rugged Irish accent of Barry Lyndon, making the film even more believable.This is truly a marvellous historical drama. Don't expect battle scenes that are comparable to the scenes in Zulu, but watching a film from this period was a breath of fresh air considering that nearly all war films in the seventies and eighties were based on Vietnam!",8,2,4,4 July 2011
Apocalypse Now," Not your typical war movie.
","If you are looking for a film with a huge, muscular topless guy with a chain gun mowing down hundreds of men, then this movie is not for you, I would recommend that you watch Rambo instead.Anyway, the only other war films that I have seen that I would believe relate to 'Apocalypse Now' would be 'Full Metal Jacket' (1987) and 'Platoon' (1986).Firstly, what struck me about this film is the lack of the typical exaggerated, ultra-violent battle scenes which have become the norm for many war films. Instead, to capture the viewer, the mental effects of the war are highlighted by showing how the war in Vietnam has mentally broken and damaged the soldiers, and we can see how they almost deteriorate during the progression of the film, the two scenes that especially capture that are the first five or ten minutes were we can see Martin Sheen, pacing around his room in Saigon, and the scene where Colonel Kurtz speaks of the mutilation of Vietnamese children. This film is truly chilling and allows you to see the Vietnam War from a more realistic, dark perspective. This film is certainly worth a watch, but if your idea of a war film is two hours of violence, you may not appreciate 'Apocalypse Now'and what it aims to get across to you, the viewer.",8,1,2,8 March 2010
Scott Pilgrim vs. the World," Childish and Predictable
","'Scott Pilgrim vs. The World.' In the past five or so years a string of films have been created that have been inspired by the growing popularity of graphic novels. 'Watchmen', 'Sin City' and 'Kick-Ass' to name a few successful ones, but for me 'Scott Pilgrim' has to be one of the most irritating pieces of cinema I have ever watched.First of all, the film has tried far too hard to appear to literally be like watching a comic scroll across the screen. The screen is often cut in sections to show windows of animation, while the use of onomatopoeia as a part of this wears thin. It is a nice idea, and can make things a lot more light-hearted, as it was effectively used throughout the 'Batman and Robin' series with Adam West. But in 'Scott Pilgrim' it is used probably at least once a minute. This is a film! Not a comic, or a television show. One of the main parts of watching a film is also to enjoy the sound effects throughout, we do not need it to be spelled out constantly for us!And now to what I found to be the most awful part of the film. Michael Cera. His voice is listening to a cat that is being run over a a steam roller. A horrible whiny moan, it really drills into your skull as the film progresses. I always thought that there was a fairly wide selection of young actors at the moment - so why choose the worst?Admittedly, the film has probably a couple of laugh out loud moments, but not many. Too few for a comedy. Perhaps I have mistaken the viewing age, and maybe it has been aimed at younger teens, or maybe the new 'tween' generation who seem to have some bizarre love for skinny boys with odd haircuts. And maybe that is why this film has become popular, despite it not being especially viewable.",4,9,17,2 July 2011
A Clockwork Orange," A Cult Film Masterpiece
","Kubrick has been renowned for movies that have been viewed as highly controversial, the most notorious being A Clockwork Orange (1971) and Lolita (1962). What makes the movie appear so controversial to watch is how the worst crimes committed by Alex and his gang or 'drogues' as he calls them are conveyed. For example, while Alex and his masked companions break and entry into a couples home, the cripple the husband by kicking him in the Dr Martens boots(a fashion icon from this time)while then moving on to cutting the wife's jumpsuit off with scissors while Alex happily sings 'I'm Singing in the Rain'. He then rapes her of which we o not see. As well as this, the movies most energetic fight scene is done in an almost elegant style, via the use of classical music, of which is used for Alex's love of Beethoven.A Clockwork Orange vividly captures violence, rape, and sex in an almost disturbing way yet you still remain glued to the screen, it was groundbreaking because of the taboos broken and how far you can go in term so what is simply suitable to be shown in cinema.An absolute masterpiece.",10,1,4,13 August 2009
Psycho," The first and best 'slasher suspense' film ever created.
","I watched this fairly recently, it stood out to me, for I already appreciated that this is THE HORROR film, the one that comes to mind (shower scene with high pitched music). But for me, what is so marvellous about this film, is that it has not been ruined by adding pointless sex scenes or having countless 'stereotypical blonds' being slaughtered by the thousand, for that is all one will typically see in the slasher movies of the past 20 years. It gave me some relief to see a film that was pure genius in terms of acting, directing (Hitchcock, the best) and how the camera is shot from what was originally seen as and still is seen as rather unusual angles. Instead of the naked blonde teen being killed by the lakeside in the height of summer or in bed with her lover straight into the film, Psycho has some background to it. Lila Crane (Vera Miles)is on the run after stealing a large sum of money, and we see her for the fist 10 or 15 minutes of the film driving anxiously out of the city with the constant fear of being caught or tracked down. She then stops of for a rest at the Bates Motel, and from there the story slowly unfolds at a rate that is not so fast the film just gets far to unreal, but at a rate that allows you to get a good idea of the persona's of the characters, especially Norman Bates (Anthony Perkins) and it gives you time to wonder, why does him mother sit by the window for such long periods of time without moving an inch? I will leave that for you to find out.",9,0,0,26 August 2009
Inception," Worst Film of 2010
","This film should have been awarded a Razzie for having the worst plot, that is if such an award exists. The plot was immensely difficult to follow. I remember reading one of a free cinema magazines while watching it at the cinema. The plot is in a dream, that is in another dream that is in a dream while he is dreaming, or something along those lines. For the first half an hour or so I was engaged with the film's plot. Who wouldn't be interested in the idea that Nolan was playing with? But he took his ideas too far in the case of 'Inception.' The whole thing just became ridiculous. The bizarre plot had an effect on the other aspects of the film. The otherwise brilliant action scenes became surprisingly dull. As I often had little idea of what was going on, to me the action scenes just seemed pointless as I did not know what the characters motives were.Despite this, the action scenes and the cinematography did offer a real spectacle.Again, one of the positives was that the acting was, admittedly of a good quality. DiCaprio, Page, Caine and Postlewaite all had good performances. But is was such a shame that I was not able to follow the development of the characters because of the plot.Overall, if you enjoy a mind-boggling plot then 'Inception' will be for you. If you want a film that you will enjoy from start to finish without having to get into it, 'Inception' will not be for you.",3,14,24,8 January 2012
