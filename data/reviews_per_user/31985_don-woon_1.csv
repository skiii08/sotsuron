Walk the Line," Dad gum, that man could sang
","Best dang movie I seen since Coal Miner's Daughter!Between you and me, this is one of them movies that you leave feeling like if that man could sang like that, then who knows what we might be able to do to heal some suffering between the races.Makes you wonder.Now when are they gonna make a picture show about George Jones or Boxcar Willie? I'd bet you a Buffalo Nickel that one of them movies would be good to.Yours truly, Don Woon",10,1,3,4 December 2005
