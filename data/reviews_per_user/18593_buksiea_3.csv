E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial," One of my best childhood memories ever!!
",There's honestly nothing bad I can say about this movie. I loved ET when I was a little child and now at 39 I still love the movie!! Everytime I watch this MOVIE it makes me feel like a little kid again. It's very entertaining sweet and cool. Still there is one thing I have to mention. Steven Spielberg brought out a special DVD version of this movie. Which is called ET the special edition. It's still the same fabulous movie we all know. They just improved on 12% of the special effects and also included a never-before-seen fun and interesting scene where you learn ET can breathe underwater. It is an absolute must buy if you are a big fan of this movie. I will love this movie till the day I die. I always wished Spielberg had made a very emotional and cool sequel.,8,7,9,15 November 2019
Spider-Man: Homecoming," Not to bad
",It was entertaining but I expected much more. There wasn't enough comedy to my taste and there was very little amazing scenes. The acting was good but the movie brought nothing new to the table.,6,1,4,18 May 2019
