Moneyball," Only fair in my book...
","While I thought the movie was well made, I just didn't enjoy it as much as I would have if it had been more 'fun.' I found it a bit slow at times and then when going through the statistical models in the trade, it went too fast... purposeful choppiness that some find entertaining, but I don't (kind of like the 'shaky camera' or average shot times of less than five seconds effects. Some folks like them, I do not).Also, Brad Pitt's constant under-bite and messy eating (which seem to have become his attempt at a trademark look) I find annoying and now a distraction. And why Jonah Hill's character isn't given nearly the credit he got in real life as AGM I think is a big miss for this movie.Overall, I was disappointed.",6,0,1,21 April 2012
Apocalypse Now," They say either you love it or hate it...
","I am not a big fan of this movie. I understand that its disjointedness and melancholy feel is supposed to be representative of the war, but I found it absurd in many ways. I remember my response when my wife asked me what I was watching and, when I told her, she asked if it was as good as they say. I told her that the cinematography was phenomenal, but the story line was not believable and most of the characters were not accurate representations of 90% of the people who served in Vietnam.In my opinion, Vietnam is the war in which film makers still want to use to push a pacifist or leftist agenda. There were hundreds of thousands of Vietnam veterans who served their country proudly and loyally who have yet to have their story told. And this film's artistic blend of the worst of the worst did not sit well with me.",5,3,6,6 March 2019
