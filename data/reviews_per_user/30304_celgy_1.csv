Hereditary," Don't get sucked into the hype
","I created this account just to leave this review. It's not the films directors fault that this has been GROSSLY overrated by all the luvvies. It's a decent drama on the subject of loss, that's all I can say about the film. As a horror? The Exorcist of our generation? Not a chance. If you're coming into this like I did ready to get your horror socks blown off then don't worry, your feet will remained untouched. I get what kind of horror it was trying to be and like I say as a solid drama on loss it's not bad but do not expect to be scared. Infact it all becomes rather stupid towards the end.",6,0,1,31 October 2018
