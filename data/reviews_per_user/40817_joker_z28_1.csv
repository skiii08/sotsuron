Blade Runner 2049," high hopes dashes
","boring, slow, long movie that feels long in a bad way, bad payoff, unless you're a og fan who wants nostalgia it may be fine. the theatre i was in most movie goes i asked did not enjoy it. Jared Letos character wasn't needed unless its for a sequel, his side kick was only needed at the end, honestly 30-45 minutes could have been cut and nothing would really changed film wise. Harrison ford stated and im paraphrasing, you can watch the movie as a sequel or stand alone, I don't agree with that. ending was a let down, Deckard finally sees his daughter hand on glass, end..... really wouldn't recommend to anyone but thats my opinion. If you enjoyed it, happy for you.",2,23,47,10 October 2017
