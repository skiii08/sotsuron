First Man," Bad soundtrack, shaky handheld camera, no drama or suspense
",I was hoping for a movie similar to Apollo-13 but First Man isn't even close. I just saw it at the Imax and was very disappointed. First Man isn't even about the science involved with putting a man on the moon but rather about the discontentment and difficulties between Armstrong and his wife. There is very little drama or suspense throughout the entire movie. The movie has zero humor and is basicly very dark portrayal of Armstrong. The camera is shaky throughout and always on extreme closeup shots. The worst thing was that the soundtrack was terrible which to me and makes the difference between a good or mediocre movie. First Man could easily have been a made for TV movie in my humble opinion.,5,87,164,12 October 2018
