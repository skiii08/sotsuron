"Run, Fat Boy, Run"," Spaced is but a distant memory...
","I think the most telling thing is I'm writing this before the movie has even finished. The ending is so predictable that I felt no need to actually devote myself to it fully. It's on in the background just in case something happens I really need to see, but so far that hasn't happened.Spaced and Black Books, sitcoms starring this film's stars Simon Pegg and Dylan Moran, arrived about a decade ago now and offered something completely new to the usual fare. Both had fairly wry humour but with hearts of gold. Since then Pegg and Moran have been playing the same characters repeatedly, arriving at this tired film that offers absolutely nothing new, simply cashing in on Pegg's previous successes. Directed by an American Friend, it's almost a parody of 'real' British comedy. I can only assume the cast were handsomely rewarded; they certainly weren't in it for the art.Spaced and Shaun of the Dead were brilliant. Hot Fuzz was okay. After seeing this, I'm not going to even bother with How to Lose Friends and Alienate People.",4,1,2,19 October 2008
