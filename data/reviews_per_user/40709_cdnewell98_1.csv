The Avengers," Short Version: Go out and Watch it!
",I can't really say anything that anyone else hasn't said about this film. Go out and watch it and you'll love it. Best film of the year so far. That's all I really have to say about this movie. Basic Details to mention would be that the CGI is pretty good but can still stick out a bit easily. Another thing to mention is that it can be a little long for people under the age of 13. Also I don't care how old your kid is or how much they would want to see this film. Do not take them to it or rent it (when it's released on DVD and Blu-ray) until they're thirteen. I've seen enough people take them to this movie ignoring the ratings and then getting p*ss*d off that their child is only 8 1/2 years old.,10,5,9,28 August 2012
