Requiem for a Dream," The strongest, saddest film I've ever seen.
","A bit of background: I'm 16 years old and I've seen around 350 films in my lifetime, and several weeks ago, was looking to see another. Having been recommended this film, I checked a few reviews here on IMDb, all of which claimed that the viewer would be in tears by the end. I was very doubtful; I've never cried for a movie before that I can remember, and I didn't expect to be moved that much by this film. Nevertheless, I sat down to watch it.By the end, I was sobbing so hard I couldn't believe it - for around ten minutes after the film ended. The haunting score and miserable outcome would not leave my head for a moment the rest of the day, and lingered in my mind for the next few days at least. This film is brutal, tragic and relentless, and you will not forget it remotely soon after viewing it. I certainly won't, and I don't think I'll ever be able to watch it again - not within the next few years, at least.Everybody should and must see this film, which simply cannot be described accurately in text. This is, hands-down, the best film I've ever seen.",10,2,4,26 June 2006
