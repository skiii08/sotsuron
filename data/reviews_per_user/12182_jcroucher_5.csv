Raiders of the Lost Ark," One word: Magic
","Raiders of the Lost Ark is a film which reminds me of why I watch movies, and why I love any movie with the name Spielberg in the credits.  The movie is pure magic.  It has a timeless quality that makes it as enjoyable the tenth time as it was the first.What gives the film this magic?  It is very hard to define.  Technically it is flawless, but there is more to it than that.  The music, the story, the homage to matinee cliffhangers, the understated humour, Harrison Ford.  All of these things are combined with something that reminds you of childhood, of home, of seeing your first shooting star.  Magic.",10,0,0,12 June 2000
X-Men," That's how to make a movie!
","I was very impressed with X-Men.  I had nothing but positive comments about the movie, I had enjoyed the comic book series and my friends who have similar tastes recommended it.  So I was expecting to be disappointed.  I wasn't.  The film is great entertainment, the ensemble cast does an excellent job.  I was particularly impressed with the way that the excellent special effects were used to advance the plot and the characters and did not completely take over the film's humanity.  There was great adventure, good character development and the film even dealt with issues in a way that was stimulating to the intellect (okay, it's not Shakespeare, but for an action/adventure/sci-fi it was much better than most).  You would have to be trying to dislike the movie not to find something to enjoy.  A special note on actor Hugh Jackman.  For an Australian I was a bit worried that he was given the part of Wolverine.  I had previously known Hugh Jackman as a guy who sang the national anthem at football grand finals, so I wasn't sure that he would be able to do justice to a disturbed character like Wolverine.  He did an excellent job, almost stealing the show.  I look forward to X-Men 2 and 3.",10,0,0,4 August 2000
The Patriot," Interesting and entertaining for 3 hours!
","The really gives audiences what they would want to see for their money. It is a three hour film filled with glorious scenery, action, special effects, Mel Gibson pulling some wonderful faces and a whole cast of likeable rogues.  It had echoes of the director's previous film, Independence Day and the writer's previous film, Saving Private Ryan.  If you could imagine these two films melted down together and then taken to the lowest common denominator you would have The Patriot. The film is too exaggerated to take the history as more than a backdrop to the human drama.  It mixes humour with tragedy, never taking the audience down into the darkness too deeply.  Mel Gibson's character has some depth and complexity, but I felt that this was never really explored, which was a pity. It did however, keep me interested for 3 hours, which is quite an accomplishment.  I put this down to the very professional technical merits of the film and a series of watchable stars inhabiting interesting characters. Just out of interest, it was one of the few films that actually uses the Dolby Surround Sound to service the plot.",8,2,4,11 August 2000
Moulin Rouge!," A word of warning
","I would wholeheartedly recommend this film.  However, I feel I must warn people to go to see it with the right expectations.  If you have the right frame of mind it will make the difference between enjoying or loathing the movie.  Do not go expecting a deep plot, original characters or important themes.  Also, do not go expecting a movie aimed at teenagers even though it occasionally looks like a video clip.  Go with the expectation that you will be seeing an amazing, dazzling, almost overwhelming theatrical musical. Expect to get major sensory overload in the first 20 minutes.  Expect Luhrman's trademarks: extreme close-ups, over the top caricatures, simplistic messages and lavish set design.  If you keep these things in mind, you'll find the whole film original, surprising and breathtaking in the most cliched way.",9,0,0,1 June 2001
Mission: Impossible II," Some exhilaration, but unsatisfying
","I was expecting to be satisfied seeing a polished John Woo action movie.  It was certainly polished, and there was a lot of action, but the movie was strangely unsatisfying.  Sydney was a strange choice for international genetic terrorism.  The relationship between the two leads lacked chemistry. The chief evil-doer was not really that evil.  The fight scenes and Woo's trademark choreographed action were impressive in the trailers but seemed to go on a few punches and explosions too long.  The film certainly had its moments, some of it was quite exhilarating, but most of it left me unmoved, and that helicopter pilot left me annoyed.  My recommendation: see the trailer three times.",6,0,0,10 July 2000
