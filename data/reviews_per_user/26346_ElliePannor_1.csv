Come and See," Wonderful, Moving, Thought Provoking
","A perfectly realistic depiction of the horrible pain and sorrow of the past. An undoubtedly thought provoking film. Viewers are plunged into the world of a young boy named Florya who has been thrust very suddenly into living the life of a Russian soldier during World War 2. We travel through his world, observing his life and the changes he undergoes both inwardly and outwardly as he becomes more and more familiar with the very authentic violence and cruelty of war which begin to surround him. From beginning to end, both you (the viewer) and Florya transform from having an almost naive state of mind, to a mind that can understand just how real death and brutality can truly be when you are forced to become acquainted with them head-on.Though this movie has no actual special effects, Klimov's interesting directorial approach may compel you to question your sanity by the time you've finished watching. A must see, however, quite a lot to take in in one sitting.",9,1,1,7 February 2011
