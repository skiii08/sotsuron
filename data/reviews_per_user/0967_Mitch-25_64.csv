The Blair Witch Project," One LOUSY movie
","I will NEVER understand why anybody liked this movie.  It had the WORST premise I have ever seen for any movie.  I didn't mind the low-quality movie making, or the fact that it was a small movie on purpose.  Even the hype was good.  If the movie had been worth the hype, and had had a better story, these things would have made it better.  The story was VERY unbelievable, and the acting didn't make it any better.  Skip this terrible movie at all costs.",1,2,4,30 July 2000
The Mask," PART.....Y? Because I GOTTA!
","I am a really big fan of Jim Carey and this movie is one of the reasons why. He has such a kinetic energy in all his 'funny' movies.  And, that is especially true in this movie.  The story is a little overdone, but that is the point, it's supposed to be.  Another thing about Carey, that green mask is very nice.  It really allows Carey to show his face. 
Now on to Diaz.  She is a KNOCKOUT in this movie.  I have rarely seen anybody so beautiful.  She was even more beautiful in There's Something About Marry.  But, this was her debut.  That long red dress in the first scene is just outstanding.",8,0,0,29 August 2003
Walk the Line," Walk the Line
","I must tell you, I am not a country music fan nor am I a fan of Cash. But still, this movie was Excellent. Johnny Cash had a very distinctive style of singing and acting on stage ('Hello, I'm Johnny Cash'). Phoenix BECOMES Cash in this movie. I know it's been said many times before, but he really does become Cash. His singing style is the same, he has the same low singing voice, his mannerisms are the same, everything. Very impressive.As for Reese, I am not familiar with June Cash's singing so I can't really make a comparison. However, I have heard she like Phoenix was very close to how June acted and sang on stage. Oh, and Reese has a GREAT voice.For two people who have never sung before or played any of the instruments Johnny and June did and to have performed like they did is just AWESOME.Also, Witherspoon and Phoenix looked VERY good together. They looked like they were having a lot of fun making this movie. This is especially true during the concert scenes. They just work so well together.I can't help but compare this with another recent music bio-pic...Ray. Is this as good or better? I'd have to say no. But it is really close. I felt Ray had a bit more story to it. And I the music Ray Charles made more than Cash's. But, that being said, this movie makes me want to get some of his music from Itunes as I did when I saw Ray.",9,1,2,24 March 2006
Alien 3," High on looks, low on story
","Although not quite as bad as most critics thought, this was a pretty bad movie.  It looked great.  All the cool camera angles, and style shots were very good.  However, the story really sucked.  I usually like Weaver.  She is a very good actress.  But, in this one, she just seemed to sleep through the movie.If you want to see a GOOD Alien movie, see the second one, Aliens.  If you want to see a good David Fincher movie, see either Se7en or Fight Club. Both are much better.",6,522,591,3 April 2002
Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," The worst of the best
","This movie is the worst of the 4 current Star Wars movies.  However, I have seen some comments here saying it is the worst movie EVER.  That is certainly NOT the case.For anybody who grew up with the original Star Wars trilogy (as I did) it is hard to put aside your expectations for a movie like this.  We EXPECTED this movie to be as good or better than the original.  Well, sorry folks, it is almost NEVER that way.  This is a movie that is involved in getting us familiar with the characters that are going to be in Episodes 2 and 3.  Star Wars was also a movie that did that.  We CANNOT expect more than that for this movie.I do hope that Lucas does better on Episode 2 and 3 than this one.  I think he will.  Let's all remember that Empire Strikes Back is commonly thought to be the BEST of the original series.  I think that will be same here.One more thing.  Let me ask Lucas to do ONE thing (although I am sure he will NOT read this).  Please get rid of JAR JAR!  He is the most ANNOYING character EVER created.  He has NO personality other than being a FOOL, and he is COMPLETELY useless as far as I am concerned.  He is simply an excuse to use CGI.",9,1,2,3 November 2001
Minority Report," A 'minority' will not like this movie
","This is a truly inspired peace of work by a master.  Spielberg has given us such a sprawling complex story.  The acting by Cruise was perfect, the visuals were just awesome, and the CGI special effects are spectacular. This is a great sci-fi movie.  But more than that it is also an excelent story.  The twists and turns in the movie were great.  I will also mirror what Roger Ebert said in his review because it is correct.  Spielberg is one of the few sci-fi directors who uses the special effects as a tool.  Instead of making the CGI effects the who point of the movie, he makes the story the most important part, and uses the special effects to serve the story.  He is such a master at his art because he does this.  He has done it ever since Jaws, and continues to do so.BTW, I rate this fourth in my list of Spielberg movies.  1. Schindler's List 2. Close Encounters 3. Jaws 4. Minority Report.A big 10 out of 10.",9,0,0,22 June 2002
Se7en," Best Brad Pitt movie
","This is a gritty mind-bending thiller.  It is by far my favorite Brad Pitt movie.  The movie is about a killer who uses the seven deadly sins as a method to kill, and the two cops (played by Pitt and Freeman) who are destined to meet up with him.  All of them involve turning the sin against the sinner, and ALL of the murders are pretty gruesome.A word to the wise: DO NOT let your kids see this movie.  It is without a doubt one of the most gruesome movies I have EVER seen.  But, the gruesomeness of the murders just adds to the movie.  The terrific acting of Brad Pitt and Moran Freeman (one of my favorite actors) just adds to the overall feel.  Kevin Spacey's much talked about roll is small, but VERY good and VERY important to understand the movie.Overall, this movie is just about the best horror/suspense movie I have seen.",10,0,0,15 October 2000
12 Monkeys," Bruce Willis at his best
","This is most certainly one of Bruce's best movies.  It is EXTREMELY dark, and EXTREMELY twisted.  I also happened to like Brad Pitt's performance. This is one movie that needs to be seen multiple times to understand though. There are so many little visuals in the movie that it is impossible to see everything in one viewing.",9,1,2,3 May 2002
12 Angry Men," 12 GREAT actors
","This is such a good movie.  I am not a big fan of old black and white movies, but this is a big exception.  It is amazing how such a limited cast (just 16 people) can be so great and make this movie really shine.  But, I think that is the mark of really great actors.  I am no fan of Henry Fonda, but I do think this is his best work.  The rest of the jurors are also extremely good.  The mark of a good actor I believe is making us understand the character from the start of the movie.  We know what each juror is thinking from the start of the movie.  We don't have to have extensive character development because the characters are already developed in our minds.  This movie could NOT be done properly today, and any director who has thoughts of doing a remake should rethink it.",10,0,1,10 June 2002
Beauty and the Beast," Best Disney movie
","This is without a doubt Disney's best movie ever.  It was almost the first animated movie to win a best picture Oscar (Silence of the Lambs deserved to win).  It is a beautifully animated movie in the tradition of the great Walt Disney.  Everything about it is top-notch from the acting to the story, to the direction.  I just wish Disney would do more movies like this.A word about the current state of Disney.  There are now other studios (namely Dreamworks) that are willing (and able) to throw money into big-budget animated movies, and many have succeeded.  Movies like Titan AE, Iron Giant (a Fox movie), and Antz are all examples of great animated movies that have features that Disney animated movies don't.  First and foremost, these movies (and others like them) are NOT movies for just kids. 
This is one thing that made Beauty and the Beast so wonderful, and also what has made Disney movies after it so terrible.  PLEASE Disney make more movies that appeal to both kids AND adults.",10,2,2,15 August 2001
"South Park: Bigger, Longer & Uncut"," VERY FUNNY
","This MUST be the funniest movie of 1999.  Some people who have never seen South Park might not understand it.  It is chocked full of satarical humor just like the show.  Some would consider it pretty crude humor, but those people don't truely understand South Park.",9,0,0,29 October 1999
Chicken Run," Just plain fun
","This movie while being a technological masterpiece is just plain fun.  I loved the story-line, the acting, and of course the way it was made.  It is also a story that anybody can watch from the smallest kid to the biggest grown-up.  It has laughs enough for all ages.  It is most certainly worth the rental.",8,0,0,15 August 2001
Sleepy Hollow," Not very good
","I guess as a non-fan of Jonny Depp, I should have expected to not be impressed by this movie.  I do like Ricci though.  I am usually a sucker for Tim Burton films, but this one left me feeling as if I missed something.  I don't know, maybe it is Depp's acting.  Anyway, on the good side, I did like the look of the film.  Burton rarely gets the look wrong even in his bad films.  And, the story is not bad. 
But overall I can't recommend this movie especially for those who don't like Depp.",3,1,3,30 July 2000
Blade II," Action from beginning to end
","Yes, this movie didn't have much of a plot.  But, did you really EXPECT one? What you will expect and do get is ACTION, and LOTS of it.  Wesley Snipes makes the perfect vampire character.  He is tough, but very likeable.  The fight scenes were great.  And as hard as this might be to believe, this is BETTER than the first.One note about the blood and guts: There is LOTS of it.  Almost EVERY creature in this movie seems to bleed from some place.  But, unlike some movies, the bleeding does add to the movie.",9,0,1,24 March 2002
Star Wars: Episode II - Attack of the Clones," Good addition to the story
","Attack of the Clones is SO much better than Episode I, I can not even begin to count the ways.  The first and most important change is the toned down Jar-Jar.  This is without a doubt the WORST Lucas creation, and I was VERY happy to see he didn't have much screen time.  Another change was the use of the Jedi council, especially Yoda.  I was EXTREMELY impressed by the battle between Yoda and Duku.  Although, I would have liked it to be longer, I think it was GREAT to see Yoda in action.  The third good thing about this movie was that it made the plot in Episode I at least marginally understandable.  And the fourth change was the ditching of the whole midiclorian thing.  This was another of Lucas' worst decisions. 
The first movie was somewhat like Ep. 4 in that it was used to set up the characters.  The second is somewhat like Ep. 5 (though not NEARLY as good as that masterpiece), in that those characters are actually allowed to DO something.  The plot in this movie was understandable and reasonable.  The plot for Ep. 1 was not (at least on its own).BTW people, if you have been one of the 20 or so people who have not seen Eps. 1 or 2, see the original triolgy (Eps. 4-6) FIRST.  They are FAR and away the better movies of the series (even Return of the Jedi), and it is NECESSARY to see them first.",7,1,1,9 December 2002
Star Wars: Episode II - Attack of the Clones," Better than EP1
","This movie is MUCH better than the first episode.  Here are some pros and a few cons with this movie: PROS: 1. Jar Jar Binks gets VERY LITTLE screen time this time.  That is GOOD.  I think Mr. Lucas did listen to all the comments he got from viewers of EP1, and toned him down A LOT.  Makes the movie SO much better. 2. Yoda was AWESOME.  I loved the computer effects.  I loved the fact that he kicked some MAJOR ass.  I also liked his calming force in the movie.  He is clearly the most powerful Jedi on the council.  This was even apparent in EP1, and it really shows this time. 3. The Visuals were truly AWESOME.  The different places that the movie took us to were just stunning.  The different creatures that were put in were very cool too. 4. This is of course expected, but the special effects were just great.  The computer effects were outstanding.  I really liked the race in the city. That was cool. 5. There was NO mention of 'mediclorians.'  Another big plus.  Seems Mr. Lucas heard the fans on that one too. 6. This makes EP1 quite a bit more understandable.  This movie also answered several of my questions from the first three films (parts 4, 5, and 6). 7. Natalie Portman is just stunning.  She was kind of reserved and held back a bit in EP1.  But, for this movie, she is powerful and well used.  And she is just such a BABE.CONS: 1. The fact that this movie was filmed in digital is great.  I am a big fan of it, and I hope this raises the stature of digital movie making.  HOWEVER, the transfer of the digital to analog film did muddy up the movie a bit.  It was especially apparent when the camera was panning fast past overhead shots, such as when the camera looked at the cloning facility.  I think this problem will be solved when this comes out on DVD. 2. Sorry folks, but the love story sucked.  These people were very stiff, and the lines were just a bit trite. 3. The pacing for this movie was a bit bad too.  In this movie, there were several scenes that didn't last more than a minute or two.  Now the original movies did go back and forth to different places, but at least they stayed in one place for a while. 4. Yoda's fight scene was TOO SHORT.  I was VERY impressed by that scene, and I wanted MORE.",7,0,0,17 May 2002
The Bourne Identity," Decent action movie
","For what it was, the Bourne Identity was a good movie.  Action movies in general have many flaws.  This one does too.  But, if an action movie is as well made as this one is, then we (or at least I) generally overlook them. I am not a really big fan of Damon, but he was good in this flick.  The twist at the end was TOTALLY surprising to me.  Overall, it was a good movie.",9,0,1,1 May 2003
The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring," As good as could be expected
","This is truly a great movie.  I read the wonderful J.R.R. Tolkien books when I was kid.  This movie took me back to that time.  I was amazed by this movie, and even more amazed by how faithful it was to the original book.A word on the ending.  I have heard so many say that the ending was bad because it was too abrupt, and didn't 'solve' anything.  Yes, this is true. However, this movie is only the FIRST in the trilogy.  The ending is at the end of the THIRD movie.  I think the people saying this are people who have never read the books.  READ THE TRILOGY BEFORE SEEING THIS MOVIE!",9,1,1,8 March 2002
The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring," READ THE BOOKS!
","First of all, I say to all those who are considering seeing this movie, to read the first book FIRST.  It WILL help.  I have a feeling that most of the people here who did not like this movie have NEVER read these books.In case you all don't know, the series has THREE parts.  This is only the FIRST part.  Those who say 'they didn't finish the story' are right.  Yes, they have NOT finished the story.  They are doing this the RIGHT way.  They have done each book as a separate movie.  Wait for part 2 and 3 before you have this opinion.  And, those who think this tiliogy should have been made into one movie are just completely WRONG.  These books are WAY too complex to make into one movie.  There is NO way to gloss over some of the points in these books.  So, to the producers of this movie, I say RIGHT ON.  Do this RIGHT.Now to the movie.  I have been a fan of The Lord of the Rings for a LONG time.  It is the series that got me interested in roll play games, and sparked my limited imagination.  Although this movie is not perfect, I feel it is as close as can be.  This series really is quite complex, and it is hard to do it right.  I thought all the scenes were well done, especially the Shire.  The acting may not have been perfect, but it wasn't bad.  And, oh MY, the special effects were simply STUNNING.  This is a must see for anybody, and I wouldn't be surprised if it wins at least a couple of well-deserved Oscars.",9,0,0,2 January 2002
Grease," Very cool musical
","I am most certainly NOT a big fan of musicals.  But, Grease is one of the few exceptions.  I really like this movie.  Yes, it drags a bit in the middle, but the main songs are staples of pulp culture.  And the chemistry between Travolta and John is great.  The dancing of course it nice.  This was also the movies that really started the careers of several people including Travolta and Olivia Newton John.  I especially like the Rizzo character played by Stockard Channing.  Although she wasn't the cutest kid in the movie, she was a very good character and Channing did a really good job.  If you like musicals, this has to be one of your favorites.  If you don't (like me) this is probably still a good movie for you to see.  It is a light fun movie with lots of really good musical numbers.",Null,1,2,29 August 2003
Armageddon," Stupid
","Although this movie had GREAT special effects, and one of my personal favorite actors (Bruce Willis), even these two things couldn't save this movie.  Has anybody counted how many times during this movie that Earth was brought to the brink of utter destruction only to be saved by some MIRACULOUS event?  I counted at least 10 times.  Doesn't this seem a LITTLE much?Another thing, I knew that this would not happen, but I would like if JUST ONCE a movie had the BALLS to smash that size of rock into Earth, just to see what would happen.  I thought Deep Impact would do that, but no, they had to play it safe.  Same with this movie.  Disappointing to say the least.",2,0,1,11 March 1999
Terminator 2: Judgment Day," VERY cool
","This along with Aliens and Empire Strikes Back is one of those VERY few sequals that is BETTER than the original.  It is necessary to see the original Terminator simply to set up the plot.  However, it has begun to look VERY dated.  The special effects were very good for its time (1984), but they look terrible now, or in 1991 when T-2 was made.The special effects in T-2 even in 2002 do not look bad.  The T1000 effects were simply outstanding.  The plot was outstanding, then of course there was Arnold.  Let's hope that the new Terminator will be even half as good as this masterpiece of sci-fi.",10,1,1,9 December 2002
Terminator 2: Judgment Day," T2 is one of my top 10 sci-fi movies
","This movie is most certainly better than the original.  The special effects were spectacular back in 1991, and they are still pretty good.  Arnold is of course his usual big bad self, but this time he has a human quality.  And, that T1000 is just so cool.",10,1,1,22 March 2002
Spider-Man," Good movie
","Although I am NOT a fan of comic books, I did see this, and was impressed. Spiderman is a character we can all find common ground with.  Before he changes, he is a geeky teenager always being picked on.  And after his change, he is able to stand up for himself.  I liked that part of the story. I liked Toby McGwire as Spiderman/Peter Parker.  I didn't think I would before, but I did after I saw him.  I also like Willem Defoe as the Green Goblin.  I think he was just the right guy for that part.  He was a sympathetic character with a very dark side.  I also liked the ending.  It left a HUGE hole for more movies, and I like that because I liked this movie.",9,0,0,9 December 2002
Spider-Man," Great fun
","I am no fan of comic books.  I am also not a big fan of Spiderman.  However, this movie was just plain fun.  The visual effects were stunning, and I really liked Toby as the geeky Peter Parker.  Yes, there were slow moments, but they were necessary in order to setup the character.  I really liked Defoe as the Green Goblin.  He was cool.BTW, there WILL be another Spiderman, you can count on it.  There is a HUGE hole at the end of the movie for one.",9,0,0,17 May 2002
Dark City," Most original sci-fi since Star Wars
","Anybody who doesn't like this movie doesn't know either good sci-fi or good film making.  I was amazed by just about everything in this movie from the outstanding sets, the direction, the story, and the acting.  Even Keifer Sutherland (who is not my favorite actor) adds to this great movie. Unfortunately, this movie did not get the credit it deserved and only spent a couple of weeks in the theaters.  Somebody PLEASE re-release it.",10,0,2,24 July 2001
Aliens," A great movie
","This is one of those EXTREMELY rare cases where the sequal is BETTER than the original.  Don't get me wrong, Alien was very very good.  But, I happen to think this one is better.  Where Alien was more psychological thriller than sci-fi, this one is A LOT more sci-fi, and quite a bit more expansive. Of course, in 1986, the makers had a lot more to work with than in 1979. Aliens has some of the same elements of Alien though.  The last battle with the queen one of the coolest bits of the movie.  I would recommend Alien to anybody, but I will always say that Aliens was better. 
BTW, the other two Alien movies SUCKED.",9,0,0,9 December 2002
American History X," Ed Norton at his best
","I have to give major props to Ed Norton.  He picks some very good movies to do.  I can see by his choices that he enjoys a challenge.  You will not find one film with Norton that is just a walk-through picture.  American History X is most certainly one of the most thought-provoking movies he has ever done.  The story of a neo-nazi who goes through an ideological change in prison when he is befriended by a black man is very good.  But, Norton makes the story even better by giving his character a lot of intelligence.  I have to admit that although I disagree with EVERYTHING that the Norton character said before his conversion, he is the ONLY character of this kind who actually has intelligent, well thought out reasons for what he believes.",10,0,0,10 December 2002
American History X," One excellent movie
","I am a HUGE fan of Ed Norton.  One reason is because of his acting in Primal Fear, the other is because of this movie.  He gives such depth to this character, and such intelligence that you ALMOST believe what he is saying before he goes to prison.  He plays a highly intelligent Neo-Nazi which is something I have NEVER seen.  This is a very thought provoking movie.",10,0,0,22 March 2002
Ocean's Eleven," Slick, polished movie
","Ocean's Eleven hits every note just exactly right.  It has good actors (though I am not a big fan of either Clooney or Damon), a good plot, and some twists and turns along the way that make it a pretty good movie.  I have never seen the original, but I have heard it is pretty damn good.  This one stands by itself in my opinion. 4 stars out of 5",8,0,0,1 May 2003
Batman Begins," The Batman franchise is saved.
","I am not a comic book fan. However, as a non-comic book fan and as somebody who judges superheroes from just their outside appearances, I have to say that Batman is my favorite (followed closely by Spiderman and Superman). The reason is that Batman is human without any real 'upgrades.' Every other superhero has had something happen to him/her to make them special (Spiderman got bit by a spider, Superman is not human, etc..). I have always liked Batman because he is human without any character advantages that the others have (other than those 'wonderful toys' of course).That is also one reason I enjoyed Batman Begins so much. This Batman is a very flawed human who becomes Batman through a conscience choice (another thing that most superheroes don't have, choice). The only thing that he has going for him is a very powerful corporation that can produce all the tools he needs to become Batman.Here are some of the other reasons I enjoyed this movie.1. This Batman takes place in the 'real' world. True, it's a modified world, but the real world none the less. Gotham in this episode does not seem to be otherworldly like the other Batman movies. In addition, everything Batman does to become his alter-ego seems to be at least slightly possible.2. I loved the explanations of how Batman became Batman and how he makes use of his company to produce the tools he needs. In the other Batman movies, we just assumed that Wayne had the resources to become Batman from some mysterious place. Here we know where the batsuit and Batmobile, and everything else comes from. I also really liked the backstory.3. The acting was also very good. Christian Bale was the biggest surprise. I haven't seen him in many movies, and I was not entirely sure how he would do. But, he was very good as BOTH Bruce Wayne AND Batman. He had a very dark quality that Batman MUST have (in my opinion). Morgan Freeman was also a very good choice. He is good in just about every single movie he is in no matter how good or bad the actual movie is. Michael Cane as Alfred was just a genius move by the producers. He has a classic quality in his acting. But he also provides some of the best comic relief in the movie (there is some, but not a lot). Garry Oldman as Gordon is another genius move. I have enjoyed him since he was in The Fifth Element. He is a great actor who provides the low-key attitude that Gordon should have. I really liked that Gordon has a central role to play in this movie, and Oldman is good at it. The ONLY actor I did not like all that much was Katie Holmes as Rachel Dawes. I understand this character is simply to give Batman a female character to play with (all Batman movies should have at least one female in it). But, Holmes is just not very good. She seems to be very plastic and not very believable.Well, that is it. There are many other reasons to like this movie, but I have covered the important parts. There are some minor plot holes and such in the movie, but they never take away from the overall fun of the movie. This is without a doubt (at least in my mind) the best in the series. I really liked the first Batman, but this one is better. A must see for anybody even if you are not a comic book fan.",10,1,2,15 July 2005
Blue Crush," Don't search for depth in a movie like this.
","If you rent this movie thinking you will see a 'deep' movie, then you rented it for the wrong reasons.  The only think deep about this movie is the ocean.  However, if you like very good cinamatography with the best serfer scenes ever along with some of the most BEAUTIFUL serfer babes EVER then this is a movie for you. Also, despite the comments putting down the story and acting, the story was NOT bad especailly considering what type of movie it is.  The producers obviously knew what type of movie this was and didn't bog it down with a heavy story.  The plot only serves to move the action from wave to wave which is what a movie like this is supposed to do.  The acting by the three HOT babes was not bad either.",7,0,0,15 January 2004
Saving Private Ryan," GREAT FILM
","The genius of Steven Speilberg is just breathtaking.  NO other director has his talents or resources.  This movie is VERY close to being a perfect movie.  The beginning scene itself is WELL worth admission.  If you miss this movie on the big screen, you will be missing greatness.  It deserves best picture, director, and actor Oscars AT LEAST.",10,0,0,8 March 1999
Schindler's List," Spielberg's masterpiece
","This is without a doubt at the top of my list of the best movies.  If you don't like this moving film, then feel for a pulse. It tells the story of Oskar Schindler and his factory of Jewish slaves forced to work.  The factory eventually becomes a haven for the Jews, and Schindler becomes a willing partner in saving 'his' Jews. 
A note about the use of black and white.  This is a master-stroke by Spielberg.  The impact is extreme especially when the few touches of color are added for effect.  Another note about the director.  In SO many of Spielberg's movies, he is right up front with his direction.  When you see one of his movies, you KNOW it.  If I did not know Spielberg had directed it, I would have been surprised to find out.  He steps back from the material and lets the story tell itself.EVERYBODY should see this movie at least once.  Spielberg will NEVER do anything as good.",10,9,26,14 August 2001
The Longest Day," very good Normandy film
","This old movie about the Normandy invasion was made only a few year after the end of WWII.  I saw it in class the other day, and I was pleasently surprised.  Yes the acting is overdone.  This is especially true of John Wayne.  I can not understand how that man ever got big screen rolls.  He is just NOT a good actor.  I did however like the acting of some of the characters.  The German actors were cool (the talk about the dummies was FUNNY).  Just to let you know, this movie was filmed ON LOCATION on the actual Normandy beaches and the towns in the area.  Most of the scenes on beaches actually DID happen (although of course they were played up by the actors).I really don't know where I would rate this in terms of war movies.  I REALLY like Saving Private Ryan (even after the landing scene).  And, I am a big fan of Glory.  It is certainly one of the best war movies I have seen though.",Null,1,3,28 February 2003
Patton," Scott's best performance
","This is my second favorite war movie.  Scott is just awesome in this movie as the great WWII general Patton.  The first scene in front of the US flag is just pure genius.  The scene alone is worth the rental prices.  The rest is also great with Scott playing Patton exactly as Patton was.  He was a pretentious over-bareing general, but his successes on the field of battle made these characteristics understandable.",10,2,6,5 July 2002
The Nightmare Before Christmas," Great Christmas movie
","I am not a real big fan of Tim Burton.  He is usually really good (Beetlejuice) or really bad (Mars Attacks!).  Although he didn't direct this movie, he did write it and produce it, and it is one of his best.The stop motion effects are very very well done.  The story is excelent, and the actors worked well together and sounded like they had LOTS of fun making the movie.  As to it being too dark to be a Christmas movie (as I have seen here), well that is a matter of opinion.  It is a little dark (as a lot of Burton's best movies are), but I still consider it to be a good Christmas movie.  The story is all in good fun, and in the end, all sides get their way. 
All in all, I would have to give it 4.5 stars out of 5.  A good movie for just about anybody to see.",9,0,1,30 June 2003
The Dark Knight," The Darkest of Knights
","One of the ways I judge the quality of a movie is by how much attention the audience around me takes from my watching of the movie. With the exception of a couple of minutes at the beginning of The Dark Knight (when a little kid started talking to her mom, she was asleep soon after), I could not take my eyes off the screen.This is a truly exceptional piece of film making. I will not give anything away by telling you what happens. I have to say though that the acting of Heath Ledger is just spectacular. They give him a lot of lines in this movie, probably a lot more than most would expect to a comic book villain to get. In fact, this movie has more dialog period than most would expect in this type of movie. That was also the case in Batman Begins, but is even more so in this movie.While Heath was awesome, the other actors were almost as good. The only weak character was Rachel Dawes played by Maggie Gyllenhaal. I thought she was weak in Batman Begins, and she is even weaker here. But the strengths of the other characters/actors more than makes up for her.Anybody who enjoys these types of movies will love this one. Even if you don't enjoy them, you should see it. It's more than a comic book movie. Nolan has managed to bring so much more to the surface than just special effects and explosions.BTW, if Ledger doesn't at least get a nomination for Best Actor, that will be a shame. He deserves it.",10,4,9,18 July 2008
2001: A Space Odyssey," Simply Brilliant
","Anybody who doesn't like this movie, check your pulse, because you are NOT alive, and DO NOT know what truely great moviemaking is all about.  This is without a doubt Kubrick's finest film.  It is more than a sci fi epic, it is also a movie about humanities need to reach out into space, and what we may find once we are there.  This is a film that EVERY other sci fi movie created after it wants to be like because it is so great.See this movie uninterupted with as little discussion as possible.  Then, talk about it.  It needs to be SEEN not just watched.",10,1,4,20 December 2000
2001: A Space Odyssey," Perhaps the most important film in history
","This is truly a classic.  Everything about this movie is just perfect.  The use of classical music was extremely intelligent.  One of the best thing about this movie is that there is NO SOUND in space.  Unfortunately, this is one thing that sci-fi movies after this one haven't picked up on. 
Just about EVERY sci-fi movie since has borrowed from this movie.  It was truly 30-40 years ahead of its time.Anybody who like sci-fi will LOVE this movie.",10,0,1,1 March 2002
There's Something About Mary," There's Something about Cameron
","This is a very funny movie.  The jokes are of course sometimes in pretty bad taste, but you would expect that from the Farrelly brothers.  What makes this movie really stand out is the performance of Diaz.  The character she plays is just so sweet, and Diaz is PERFECT in the role.  That face, hair, eyes, and body are just DYNOMITE.  She looks so innocent and sweet that you really do believe that Diaz is that character.  Of course she isn't as exemplified by some of her later work.",8,1,1,12 June 2002
Total Recall," Very good Arnold film
","Watching this again for about the 100th time, I have to say this movie is one of my favorite Schwarzenegger movies.  He really expands his acting ability here.  He isn't just a big bad dude (although he certainly is that here), he is thoughtfull and even funny.  Yes, this movie's science sucks, but what sci-fi movie truely is accurate as far as science?  If Schwarzenegger died at the end of the movie, audiences would have been up in arms.  One other note, I REALLY liked the acting of Ironside.  He always plays the evil dudes, but this is one of his best performances along with Ronny Cox.",8,0,1,17 May 2003
The Matrix Reloaded," Good sequal
","After having seen this sequal, I have to say that it wasn't bad.  The story although a little convoluted was good, the acting was very good (I like Fishburne).  I espeically liked Morpheus' speech in front of the 'rave.'
As for the action, all I can say is WOW.  The fight sequences were stunning. Neo's fight with Agent Smith (LOTS of him) was great.  The freeway scene was also very well done.  For all those who critisize this movie for having a weak storyline, let me say one thing, GET OVER IT.  This is an ACTION movie.  Almost NO good action has story that is beyond simplistic.  And, I have to say this one is better than most.  You go to this type of movie to see sci-fi special effects, and action.I was one of the 5 or so people in the world who DIDN'T know before seeing the movie that there will be a third.  Frankly, I can't wait for November. It's gonna be WAY cool.",7,0,0,16 May 2003
A Beautiful Mind," A Beautiful Picture
","This certainly seems to be the right time for Russell Crowe.  He won last year for Gladiator, and I think he should win another this year for this brilliant performance.  This is a movie that is complex, thoughtful, and above all well acted.  Even though Crowe is an Aussie, I think he pulled off the West Virginia accent pretty well.  I have been impressed since seeing him in L.A. Confidential, and I am even more impressed.",10,0,1,2 January 2002
A Beautiful Mind," Oscar worthy performance
","This is an outstanding movie about a mathmatics genius.  I certainly woulnd't have wanted to go through what John Nash did.  This movie portrays Nash perfectly with a lot of heart.  Crowe is PERFECT for the role, and it will probably get him an Oscar for best actor.  I think the movie also deserves one for best pic, but probably will not get it.  I think Lord of the Rings will.",10,0,1,1 March 2002
Psycho," GREAT movie
","One of the best marks of a movie is its staying power.  And Psycho is most certainly one movie that has stood the test of time.  It is still: 1. The most frightening horror movie 2. The best filmed horror movie 3. The best ACTED horror movie 4. The best directed horror movie.  VERY FEW movies set the viewer up with one character as a setup for another even better character.  But, Psycho did it, and did it well.  Of course, everybody has heard about the 'shower' scene.  And, it was certainly something nobody had ever seen before.  Today, it is considered very mild.  But, that scene is only a small part of the movie.  The rest is just good it is almost beyond words.  If you are one of the few people who has never seen this classic horror movie, do yourself a favor, and rent it.",10,1,1,11 July 2002
Psycho," The great Hitchcock classic
","This movie STILL gives me chills.  It is a great classic.  Not just because of the horror of Mr. Bates, but because of the way it was made and the acting.  Everything about this movie is good.  The first time I saw it, I didn't know what to expect.  I was just blown away.",10,1,1,3 May 2002
Jaws," One of the best movies of all time
","Those who say this movie isn't good are either too young to have seen it in the theater, or they just don't like movies.  This is without a doubt one of the best movies of all time.  The camera angles, the acting, the directing all make this a great film.  And that shark STILL scares the crap out of me.",10,2,4,29 April 2002
Jaws," A classic after 25+ years
","This is still a great movie after 25+ years.  Everything from the acting to the directing to the special effects is PERFECT.  Even though I have seen it lots of times, I am still scared of that shark.  And anybody who doesn't like this classic just doesn't know good movies.  I think people 100 years from now will still be watching this movie and appreciating what a masterpiece it is.",10,2,4,22 March 2001
Star Wars: Episode III - Revenge of the Sith," ONE of the best of the entire series
","First, I will tell you the one thing that is bad about this movie: The acting is rather bad. The actors are very wooden and just don't seem to mesh well. Though, I must say two things about this. First, NONE of the Star Wars movies has had great acting. And, the acting in this movie is MUCH better than ep 1 and 2. I especially enjoyed Hayen's acting AFTER he swore loyalty to Palpatine.Now that we have that out of the way, let me list the many good things about this movie: 1. The special effects are AWESOME. There is SO much to see in every single scene that when you get finished, you have not even seen half of what you want to. That is one of the good things about the original series.2. The story is very very good. I thought it connected so much and allowed no huge questions between this one and New Hope. Of course there are questions about what Obi-Wan and Yoda do in between the two episodes and how Leia and Luke grow up. But, the really big questions like how Darth Vader comes into being are answered. That more than anything else is what I was looking for from this movie.3. Ian McDiarmid's acting is extraordinary. I didn't think a lot of him during eps 1 and 2. But, in this movie, he shines. The conversion scene with him transforming into the dark evil emperor was very well done. His ability to turn Anakin was also ingenious.4. Yoda was once again a BAD ASS. Yoda has always been one of my favorite characters. I am sure I am not alone in this opinion either. When he was created for ep 5, Lucas simply did not have the technology to make him move like he did in the first three episodes. Now he does, and he uses technology to bring Yoda truly to life. The scene where Yoda confronts Palpatine is great. When Yoda drops those two guards at the entrance, the audience I was with cheered.5. The transformation of Darth Vader into the hulking figure we know today was very interesting. We get to view him in 'human' form when he swears loyalty to the emperor, when is badly burned after his fight with Obi-Wan and then the big transformation when he is rescued by Palpatine and is fitted with his suit. I thought the stages of transformation were very well done and really made it seem that each step was progressively painful for Anakin.Well, anyway, there are some of the good things about this movie. Overall, I think Lucas has really redeemed himself. While I enjoyed ep 2, and to lesser extent ep 1, this is the one that really brings everything together. It is also an excellent story and has just jaw-dropping special effects. 10/10 rating.Oh, one thing, is this the best of the series? At this point, I'd have to say no. I am still in awe of Empire. This I would put at number 2. I need to see it a few more times though. It might replace Empire eventually.",9,3,6,20 May 2005
The Iron Giant," Simply Outstanding
","Disney wouldn't have the BALLS to do this type of movie.  It is one of the most strikingly beautiful animated films ever made.  It is about a little kid who finds a robot who was built as a weapon but with the help of the kid learns he doesn't have to be.  That's a VERY basic description, but it does NO justice to the movie.  There are A LOT of themes to the movie, and a lot of good old fashioned morals.  In addition, this movie is NOT a silly kids-only movie.  Almost anybody can understand the message, and laugh at the antics.  The ONLY problem I have with it is the lack of support it got from Warner.  Come on guys, with this kind of quality, you CAN best Disney no matter WHAT kind of roadblocks they put in front of you.Disney take note, this is a wake-up call.  It is time to produce QUALITY animation, not just something that will sell your merchandise.",Null,0,1,17 April 2001
The Iron Giant," One great movie
","This is the type of movie that Disney SHOULD have started making YEARS ago. Instead of all the cute characters and song and dance numbers, here is a movie that is actually about somthing.  The Hogarth character was a kid who we all wish we were.  And the giant was a great character.  The story about a iron giant who was made for war but wanted to be nice is compelling, and the ending had me crying.  Another thing, the animation in this movie was SUPERB.  It is some of the best animation I have ever seen.Disney does not take chances like this anymore.  They used to when Mr. Disney was alive, but not anymore.  This is a movie that takes chances.  Fox is truely making strides against the evil empire of Disney.",Null,0,1,2 August 2000
Shrek," If you don't like this, you must be DEAD.
","I saw this movie last night, and I have to say it is the BEST animated movie I have EVER seen.  The technical aspects of the animation are simply perfect.  Disney thinks it has the edge in animation.  Well, Dreamworks has been working VERY hard to take that edge away, and I think with Shrek and Antz, it has done that.  The characters look life-like without losing any of their fanciful characteristics.  The background characters and the scenery are simply fantastic.Now for the characters.  Shrek is simply outstanding.  He IS alive.  He is NOT that ugly, and in many ways we sympathize with his situation.  Picking Mike Myers to be his voice was a perfect.  The donkey named Donkey is another great character.  He's the main jokester and Edie Murphy makes him come alive.  The relationship he develops with the dragon is just TOO funny. Princess Fiona is not like any other animated princess we have ever seen. She quite a bitch in many ways, but we also sympathize with here situation. And, King Farquod is just outstanding.  Being voiced by John Lithgow was another perfect decision.SPOILER!!!!!!!!This movie has SO many in-jokes, and pokes at Disney that it is hard to know where to begin.  All the Disney characters in the movie are in the public domain, anybody can use them.  There is Snow White (and the dwarves), Cinderella, the Three Little Pigs, the Three Blind Mice, and countless other Disney characters represented here.  Perhaps the FUNNIEST scene is when Princess Fiona sings in the forest with a blue bird, and sings at such a high pitch, that the bird explodes.  Then she cooks up the bird's eggs for breakfast.  VERY funny stuff. 
Anyway, as you can see, I just LOVED this movie.  It is most certainly an adult animated movie, but it can be enjoyed by anybody including little kids.  This is mainly because of Shrek himself.  He is VERY lovable from the very beginning of the movie.And a message to Disney.  You WILL NEVER do a movie like this.  Your rules simply restrict your ability to do movies like this.",9,0,0,19 October 2001
Bruce Almighty," One of Carrey's better movies
","I am a VERY big Jim Carrey fan.  I laughed my ASS off during Liar Liar and Ace Ventura.  I also like him in his serious movies, especially Truman Show. This one is a cross between his VERY funny side, and his serious side.  He is of course VERY funny in this movie, but there are parts that are very serious, and he pulls it off with a lot of ease.  he is truely a multi-function actor.As for the rest of the cast, I was happy with Jennifer Aniston's acting.  I think she is more than just a couple of nice tits and great ass.  Morgan Freeman makes a VERY cool God.  As for Steven Carell, his limited scenes are VERY funny, especially in the anchor scene.Overall, I would have to rate this a 9.  Good acting, funny script, and some very serious situations make this a very good film.",9,0,0,29 May 2003
X2: X-Men United," More of the same, but better
","It is not often that the sequel to any big-budget flick is better, but this is the case with X2.  The action is much bigger in scope and the story is really pretty damn good (I liked that Wolverine found out where he was 'made').  Plus, we are introduced to some new X-Men including Pyro and Alan Cumming as Nightcrawler (I REALLY liked him).  Are there flaws?  Sure there are.  The plot is a BIT over-the-top, but who cares?  It is a big-time action movie, and it is just fun to watch.",9,0,0,5 May 2003
The Sixth Sense," Great movie
","I saw this not on the big screen, but on DVD.  Seeing it on the small screen didn't take much away from it (I don't think so anyway).This movie was a brilliant stroke of genius.  Bruce Willis was exceptional. I am a fan of Bruce anyway, but he was at his very best in this movie.  The kid Haley Joel Osment was almost TOO cute for this movie, but he most certainly deserved his Oscar.  He was outstanding.I was even more impressed by the movie, and that absolutely unexpected ending.  Anybody who says had any idea about the ending before the ending actually happened, is lying.  There is really no hint of it during the movie.  Again, absolute genius in movie-making.  This is what a REAL thriller is all about.",10,0,0,30 July 2000
The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King," The BEST movie of the series
","Watching this great movie for the second time, I remember some of the best times I had as a moviegoer especially as a kid.  I remember watching the original Star Wars series with a SERIOUS amount of amazement.  Raiders of the Lost Arc gave me a great sense of adventure.  And, the first Jaws scared the hell out of me.  All these movies (and others like them) PROVIDED something for me to remember.  In addition, they were just plain FUN movies. Not pretentious, overwrought or just plain dumb.  Most of today's movies are just plain nonsense.  They have no heart like they used to.  They are all made for the sole purpose of making a buck.Although I am sure that New Line Cinema would love to make billions on this series, and Peter Jackson and his people are being paid well for their efforts, that does not prevent these movies from being great works of art and just plain fun.  I remember reading these books as a kid, and I have always loved them and wanted somebody to do a proper adaptation of them.  Now that the final book has been brought to the big screen we can see the entire series from a new perspective and I for one admire it more than I ever have.  It would have been easy for Jackson and co. after the success of Fellowship to just give people a shortened version of the last two books with teasers here and there but no substance.  But, he has not done this.  Return of the King is the best example of this.In this movie, Jackson has made a movie that works very well with the books and finds the most essential parts of it to make a movie that works on just about every level.  From the scenery in New Zealand to the look of the battles (I felt as if I WAS there) to the incomparable computer effects of Gollum and the equally amazing effects of Shelob, ever part was filmed with a care to the details that the books deserved.  The dialog in this movie is also much better than in Two Towers.  I loved this movie from the first scene of how Smeagol finds the ring of power to the last frame of Sam closing his door in the Shire.Back to what I was saying at the top.  Very few movies today give me a sense of wonder that I had as a kid.  This series certainly does this.  From the beginning to the end, the movies are a stunning achievement and worthy of any awards it receives.",10,0,0,29 December 2003
Star Wars: Episode V - The Empire Strikes Back," The best of the entire series
","I remember seeing this classic movie as a kid.  I loved it then, and now that I am grown up and know a bit more about movies (and have seen many more of them), I love this movie even more.  Where Star Wars: A New Hope was a movie that introduced the main characters of the first trilogy, Empire is the movie that really gets into the meat of the story.  Luke trains with Yoda to become a Jedi, the others (Han, Leia and C3PO) are chased by the evil empire, and of course Luke finds out that Darth Vader (the BEST villan in the history of the movies) is his father. 
This is also the movie where George Lucas was free to do just about anything he wanted with his special effects.  And, it REALLY shows in this movie. The scenes on Hoth with the Imperial Walkers are very cool even by today's standards.  The asteroids and space battles are much better than in A New Hope, much more refined.  Just about everything in this movie effects wise is an improvement on A New Hope.I love all three of the first trilogy.  I even like episodes 1 and 2 (although they both pale in comparison).  However, this is by far the best of EITHER of the series.  Let's just hope that episode 3 lives up to the greatness of this great movie series.",10,0,1,28 August 2003
Star Wars: Episode V - The Empire Strikes Back," The best of the series
","A lot of people have said this before, but I will say it again, Empire Strikes Back is the BEST of the Star Wars series.  Star Wars was great, don't get me wrong.  But, Star Wars was a movie to introduce the characters. This is a movie to let those characters DO something.  When you see the battle on Hoth or on Cloud City, you KNOW the characters.  This movie gives them MUCH more to do.  Plus the special effects are very very good, and even in 2002 more than hold their own against the best of today. 
Yoda was an OUTSTANDING creation.  I can not understand some of the comments I have seen here that criticize Lucas for including Yoda.  He provides balance to the entire series, and is most certainly NOT a muppet.  It was a VERY necessary part of the movie and of the series.",10,0,1,9 December 2002
Braveheart," Mel's best movie
","What words can I say about this awesome film that haven't already been said? This is truly film magic.  Mel Gibson plays the best role he has ever played.  He also directed and produced this epic.  YES, the movie is not very historically accurate.  But, aren't most movies of this type inaccurate?  Plus, we know so little about William Wallace that it is hard to be accurate.  At least the American public knows about him.Now a comment about the other actors.  I REALLY liked the two female roles. I thought Catherine McCormack as Murron was ideal.  She had a very Celtic feel about her, and she is VERY good looking too.  I also liked Sophie Marceau as Princess Isabella.  Sophie is GORGEOUS.  My favorite male actors (besides Mel) HAD to be David O'Hara as Stephen and Brendan Gleeson as Hamish.  But, overall, everybody did a great job.",10,1,2,8 March 2001
Braveheart," Great movie, bad history
","Let me get this out of the way first.  The history in this movie SUCKS. Robert the Bruce was a GREAT warrior, not this sniviling creep.  Also, William Wallace although a great warrior, is not historically accurate.Now that that is done, let me say that this is a GREAT movie.  The battle scenes are VERY well done, the acting is great, the supporting cast is excelent, and the story is very engaging.  So what if the history is wrong, I really don't care.  I am a history major in college (I have a BA in history).  I have learned NOT to take most 'historical' movies seriously.  And Braveheart is no different.  I go to the movies to be entertained, not to really learn something (if I want to do that, I will read a BOOK).  Braveheard entertained me (and still does).",10,1,3,1 May 2003
"O Brother, Where Art Thou?"," Funny, funny, funny movie
","This is not a movie you would expect somebody like Clooney to be good in, but he plays this character EXACTLY right.  Since seeing this, I have some new respect for him (though I still think he is overrated).  The best scene (at least for me) was when Clooney sings their 'famous' song at the dance. VERY funny indeed.  BTW, I have now seen only three Cohen movies.  Fargo, I just didn't get, but Raising Arizona is FUNNY.  I think this one is not quite as funny, but still very good.",9,0,0,1 May 2003
The Godfather," Number 1 on IMDB for MANY reasons
","This movie is a true classic.  EVERYTHING about this movie is good.  The directing, the acting, the sets, the screenplay, etc.....  My favorite character was of course Michael.  But, the rest of the cast is also worth note.  Robert Duvall as Tom Hagen is one of my favorites, as is Diane Keaton as Kay.  The story itself is not just a underworld crime drama.  It is also about a simple immigrant family who is just trying to get along in the world.  It is also about the relationship between Michael and Kay.  It is also about the changing relationship between Michael and Tom.  This movie had two sequels including Part II which also won the Best Picture Oscar when it came out.  This is something that hadn't been done before and hasn't been done since.  The sequel to any movie is not supposed to be as good as the original.  However, Part II was as good if not better than Part I.  Bravo!",10,0,1,10 June 2002
The Godfather," My second favorite movie
","Behind Schindler's List, this is my second all-time favorite movie.  It is so rich in detail, and style, and acting.  EVERYTHING that is on the screen has a purpose, and EVERY bit of dialog is important.  If not at the moment, then a few frames later.  It is without a doubt the best movie in the mob genre.  If it wasn't for this movie, movies like Goodfellas, and Casino could NEVER have been made.  One comment on The Godfather Part II.  While it is great and most certainly deserved every award it got (including best pic), it is simply not as good as this one.",10,0,1,8 March 2002
