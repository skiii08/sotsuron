The Blair Witch Project," So, was it scary? BLAIR-ly
","Well, where to begin on this 'movie.'  I remember plunking down my $7.00 to see this picture with expectations like I had never had.  Everyone I had talked to who had seen it said that is had scared them sh**-less.  I consider myself a true horror buff who has seen almost everything, even the stuff in the enormous 80s video cassette holders at the local rinky-dink video stores.  So you can imagine my anticipation.  If I wasn't going to wet myself from fright, I was sure to wet myself from excitement.  Finally, I was able to see the movie that everyone was spitting cuds into my face about.  For the most part, it started off original.  Hey, a first person/handheld shot of what is going on in the movie.  Okay, this is unique.  Then the Legend of the Blair Witch seemed really cool.  But as the movie dragged on (and I felt as if I might upchuck from motion sickness) it just really seemed like the Real World Goes Camping.  There was arguing and confusion as our three students lost their way in the woods. Then they would get spooked at night by the sounds of children laughing and some left over sticks in the morning.  Oooooo, I'm shaking already!  Nothing scarier than children and bundled sticks.  Then one of the students disappears from the others. The other two run out of their tent and scream 'What the hell is that!  What the hell is that!'  Well, as the viewer, if I could even get a glimpse of 'that' I might be able to tell you what is was.  Perhaps it was an owl, or a tree frog.  I don't know.  What am I supposed to be scared of here?  Finally, to my stomach's pleasing we come to the climax of the film, where our film students enter what appears to be The Blair Witch's shack. Finally, I'm thinking I'm going to see something, right?  WRONG!  Nothing. No shadow, nor glimpse of who the 'Blair Witch' may be.  We are left wondering, if there really was a Blair Witch, or if the missing student, Josh, was the 'Blair Witch.'  Perhaps a clever little whodunnit, but not even close to scary.  Not to mention, I prefer a score to my horror movies. It adds so much atmosphere (take Halloween for instance).  I also prefer to see at least a glimpse of the killer or the evil or whatever it is that makes this a 'horror' movie.  Perhaps the two clowns who did this film couldn't afford to have a monster.  Well, now they can after taking all of us suckers to the cleaners.  And for all those nincompoops who thought that this movie was for real, the short bus will be around shortly to pick you up.  Well, I hope this review shows you that this movie is a total waste of time, money, and anticipation for horror fans.  What seemed like an original idea turned into a total sham?  When I finish watching a horror movie, I want the fright to stay with me, such as when I go into the woods, I think Jason Vorhees, or if I go to a cemetery, I think Tall Man.  When I think of Blair Witch, I think of...hmmm...what was I supposed to be scared of?  The wind?",Null,0,1,15 September 2003
The Thing," Boy did this one scare the pants off of me!
","I saw this movie for the first time when I was about seven years old and I don't think I slept a wink that night.  Twenty years later, every time I watch this picture I feel like a seven year old again, and I don't scare easily.  In fact, of the hundreds of horror films I have spent my life watching and dissecting, there are only a handful of films that truly terrified me, and John Carpenter's The Thing is at the very top of that elite list.  But what is it that makes this movie so scary?  The first element is the score.  For some reason, JC's synth score really gets to me. I can't explain it but it really makes this movie seem extra creepy.  In fact, I have the score on CD and even if I pop it in during the day, I can't help but get chills as it reminds me of a number of suspenseful scenes. Next is the special effects.  Rob Bottin's work is absolutely amazing...hands down the best I have ever seen without the aid of computer generated graphics!  The amazing thing is that the effects still hold up today against the CGI films.  He really makes the monster come to life, a pure genius.  Now, even though the score is eerie and the effects are off the charts, the real magic of this movie is the feeling of isolation and helplessness that Carpenter creates.  Imagine, being trapped at an Antarctic research station with 11 other men, one or more of whom are 'infected' with and alien monster and you can't contact the rest of the world.  You can't tell by looking at each other as the monster imitates its victims permanently...until it gets you alone...finally revealing its true gruesome identity.  But how do you know who are your friends...and who is 'the thing?'  This premise is what sets the tone for an edge-of-your seat game of: who do you trust and who do you fear?  This movie is best enjoyed by yourself, during a thunderstom, with no lights on.  Enjoy it, if you can.",Null,0,1,15 September 2003
Halloween," The Absolute Finest
","Halloween is not only the godfather of all slasher movies but the greatest horror movie ever!  John Carpenter and Debra Hill created the most suspenseful, creepy, and terrifying movie of all time with this classic chiller.  Michael Myers is such a phenomenal monster in this movie that he inspired scores of imitators, such as Jason Vorhees (Friday the 13th), The Miner (My Bloody Valentine), and Charlie Puckett (The Night Brings Charlie). Okay, so I got a little obscure there, but it just goes to show you the impact that this movie had on the entire horror genre.  No longer did a monster have to come from King Tut's tomb or from Dr. Frankenstein's lab. He could be created in the cozy little neighborhoods of suburbia.  And on The Night He Came Home...Haddonfield, Illinois and the viewers would never be the same.  There are many aspects of this movie that make it the crowning jewel of horror movies.  First is the setting...it takes place in what appears to be a normal suburban neighborhood.  Many of us who grew up in an area such as this can easily identify with the characters.  This is the type of neighborhood where you feel safe, but if trouble starts to brew, nobody wants to lift a finger to get involved (especially when a heavy-breathing madman is trying to skewer our young heroine.)  Along with the setting, the movie takes place on Halloween!!  The scariest night of the year!  While most people are carving jack-o-lanterns, Michael Myers is looking to carve up some teenie-boppers.  Besides the setting, there is some great acting. Jamie Lee Curtis does a serviceable job as our heroine, Laurie Strode, a goody-two-shoes high-schooler who can never seem to find a date.  However, it is Donald Pleasance, as Dr. Sam Loomis, who really steals the show. His portrayal of the good doctor, who knows just what type of evil hides behind the black eyes of Michael Myers and feels compelled to send him to Hell once and for all, is the stuff of horror legend.  However, it is the synthesizer score that really drives this picture as it seems to almost put the viewer into the film.  Once you hear it, you will never forget it.  I also enjoy the grainy feel to this picture.  Nowadays, they seem to sharpen up the image of every movie, giving us every possible detail of the monster we are supposed to be afraid of.  In Halloween, John Carpenter never really lets us get a complete look at Michael Myers.  He always seems like he is a part of the shadows, and, I think that is what makes him so terrifying.  There are many scenes where Michael is partly visible as he spies on the young teens (unbeknownst to them), which adds to his creepiness.  If you think about, some wacko could be watching you right now and you wouldn't even know it. Unfortunately for our teenagers (and fortunately for us horror fans), when they find Michael, he's not looking for candy on this Halloween night..he's looking for blood.  Finally, Michael Myers, himself, is a key element to this movie's effectiveness.  His relentless pursuit of Laurie Strode makes him seem like the killer who will never stop.  He is the bogeyman that will haunt you for the rest of your life.  So,if you have not seen this movie (if there are still some of you out there who haven't, or even if you have), grab some popcorn, turn off every light, pop this into the old DVD and watch in fright.  Trick or Treat!",10,262,339,15 September 2003
