Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," A rare treat
","Phantom Menace is a rare treat, despite the distracting and un-creative racial stereotypes characterizing some of the aliens. Laying the groundwork for the entire series, introducing us to some of personalities, and beginning the arc of the larger story  makes TPM a sort of Rosetta Stone for fans.  Hopefully the audience is aware the brilliant but troubled boy Anakin Skywalker eventually becomes the Jedi-hunting Darth Vader. This kind of glimpse into Star Wars history lets the curious audience know more than the characters, and it makes the drama all the more poignant. 
For those who can recognize it, Senator Palpatine's subtle treachery and manipulation makes him one of the most despicable characters brought to the screen.  In Palpatine we see the genesis of the Emperor, but more importantly we start to see *how* a devious, power-mad politician can pervert and destroy a democratic government in order to gain absolute power. This part isn't fantasy; it happens here on Earth too.The clear African, Asian, and Jewish/Arabic stereotypes embodied by the warrior, trade, and merchant classes are annoying, unnecessary, and less than creative.  Perpetuating these characterizations is a disservice to the audience, both young and old.  Why not be truly creative and start new myths? Kids better than most are eager, willing and able to explore new cultures and peoples.  Give the new aliens new personalities; don't make them jaded caricatures of earth people.The effects in this film are jaw-dropping.  The scenes are so spectacular you can't believe you're seeing them.  But they're not spectacular because they're weird, they're spectacular because they're real.  Through effects we're taken to places and shown creatures that convincingly exist in a real, but different world.  This is technology in service of fantasy, and it's the most fully and realistically rendered fantasy I've ever seen on the silver screen.  Clearly this is a new benchmark in what can be done on film by a very talented, immensely hard-working crew.I particularly enjoyed the undersea creatures of Naboo. The flow of the underwater scenes is quite natural but also moved the plot along.  This is just one set in a story that unfolds magically and convincingly on the screen.  Phantom Menace is a must see, and like most who have seen it, I'm dying to find out what happens to the characters in the rest of the series: where Anakin goes dark, how Palpatine becomes Emperor, how Obi-Wan survives the Jedi purge, when and with whom Anakin sires Luke and Leia, etc.",10,0,0,29 July 1999
Inglourious Basterds," More junk from Tarantino
","Tarantino continues to make idiotic cartoons that at best glorify and at worst encourage violence. Next time there's a mass shooting somewhere, consider whether movies like this one have made violence fashionable, dramatic, cool, newsworthy, glorious or even a little less than totally unacceptable.Suspension of disbelief can't possibly include fantasizing that the Nazis would be stupid enough to send all four of its top leaders into a tiny Jewish-run cinema in Paris. Comic book authors usually won't insult their readers to that extent. On the contrary, they tend to write with a level of logic and intelligence far above Tarantino.Production, acting, music, cinematography in the film are very good, but they can't counteract the insipid premise, plot, and overall concept. Speaking of music, the borrowed Morricone pieces are very good, but the rock, r&b, etc., are totally out of place and tear down the facade of a period piece.Similarly, Christoph Waltz as SS detective Hans Landa gave an amazing performance which was ruined by psychotic leaps out of character as written by Tarantino. Yes it showed Waltz's amazing acting range, but it also destroyed the integrity of his character.There are numerous 'artistic' continuity errors in the film, no doubt created to give a cleaner looking shot. When Landa strangles von Hammersmark, both of their chairs mysteriously disappear. When Raine carves Landa's forehead, Landa's handcuffs disappear so he can grasp at the grass in pain, etc. Again this reinforces the notion that these are comics, and rather bad ones at that.",1,151,280,21 February 2010
The Fifth Element," Great movie-making
","A fun, very imaginative, visually stunning movie.  No it's not 2001 (what movie with Bruce Willis could be?).  It *is* highly entertaining, great movie-making.The Fifth Element's humor is funny, action strong, visuals great.  But what raises it above the average action flick is the clever science fiction of 3-D 'car' traffic, ultimate space saver apartments, cool future weapons, 10,000 foot Manhattan skyscrapers, warping space ships, and alien worlds together with human elements like labor strikes, rasta nuclear fuel workers, and love as a reason for existence.  These themes pour from the soul of writer/director Luc Besson (of Nikita fame) yielding a rich tapestry for our characters to inhabit.  This is one person's vision realized in extraordinary detail, the result being a film that's easy to dive into and enjoy.",10,0,1,9 February 1999
Chicken Run," Aardman's first feature length film is a blast
","Call this the best movie of 2000 ignored by Oscar.  Come on, not even one nomination?  This film is not just an outstanding achievement in hand animation, it's also up to Aardman's high standards of excellent writing, artwork, craft and skill, all in a fresh and original way.Chicken Run continues, in a feature-length film, Aardman's outlandishly funny stop-motion clay animation of Wallace and Grommit and other Oscar-winning shorts, but in the totally unexpected setting of a British chicken farm.  The story is somewhat of an homage to the Great Escape, Stalag 17, Escape of the Birdmen, and other WWII prisoner of war escape movies, but with the ludicrous twist that the heros are, well... birds. Movie fans will enjoy seeing how many other movie references they can spot.The characters and story here are as engrossing as ever, and the direction, vocal talent and foley sound effects are brilliant.  Mel Gibson gives a great performance as Rocky, and the other vocal artists are excellent as well.  Lighting, set decoration and photography are sharp as usual.  Most amazing is the range and subtlety of facial expressions emanating from a few artfully moved eyebrows, eyelids, head shapes, etc.  (It's even more amazing since they don't actually have eyebrows, etc.)  This together with the vocal direction gives the characters real life and feeling.This is great entertainment for all ages, well suited for family viewing. Some may have a little trouble with the British accents unless they've seen a few BBC shows.  Highly recommended.",10,0,0,25 March 2001
X-Men," Great movie, amazing casting
","Putting the world's favorite comic heros into a live action movie is a challenge indeed.  X-Men is a favorite because of the difficult social themes of adolescence, tolerance, difference, achievement, bigotry.  Top notch science fiction forms the background of the though-provoking comic series.  X-Men the film succeeds in placing interesting characters in stunning settings while facing disturbing social problems.  It also succeeds as a highly imaginative action flick.This film includes a very strong performance by Hollywood newcomer Hugh Jackman, well supported by superstars like Patrick Stewart, Halle Berry, and fellow rising star Anna Paquin who is perhaps best known for her childhood debut in Oscar-winner The Piano.  X-Men's visual effects are stunning as expected.  But the one thing that really surprises me is the near-prefect casting.  Famke Janssen is beyond perfectly cast as Jean, Patrick Stewart and Ian McKellen seem born for the roles of Professor Xavier and Magneto, and the naturally radiant Halle Berry is wonderful as Storm.  The scenes shared by Jean, Jackman as Wolverine, and James Marsden as Cyclops are very human, and the script and direction manage to inject a lot of clever and light-hearted humor into a relatively dark plot.",9,0,0,26 March 2001
Good Will Hunting," Average
",Mediocre and predictable.  A few well written scenes but otherwise hackneyed.  Robin Williams performance is very strong; stronger than the rest of the cast. The main letdown is the plot's predictablity.  A fair first effort but not worthy of the praise heaped upon it.,7,0,3,19 February 2001
The Shawshank Redemption," Good, but not the best ever.
","Very good performances from Freeman and Robbins. Good writing.  The best move ever?  Nope.  I gave it a 8 out of 10.As a libertarian, my own feelings about freedom, power, and corruption are apparently quite a bit stronger than either Darabont or Stephen King.",8,0,1,1 February 1999
The Big Short," Entertaining movie, but completely misses the big picture
","The Big Short is superbly-acted and well-written. Brad Pitt, Steve Carrell and their supporting cast give great performances, but the shocker for me was Christian Bale's portrayal of a brilliant fund manager with Asperger's syndrome who can 'do the math' and read markets with unnerving clarity and correctness even when the results go completely against the grain of conventional thinking.Bale inhabited this character, based on Dr. Michael Burry, with stunning effect as if he actually had this difficult to identify condition. It was a stunning transformation and masterful feat of acting. The tortured humanity of Carrell's character also came through luminously as his conscience wrestled with profiting from the economic collapse and the stupidity and dishonesty of the immediate circumstances that preceded it. But Bale's performance was by far the more subtle and awe-inspiring to me.Michael Lewis' story is compelling on a human level, describing the tribulations down in the trenches as three different hedge funds bet against the housing bubble mortgage market and derivatives on it. It highlights human greed and stupidity, and the inertia of huge institutions. But it also highlights very different life experiences of three very different funds, one on Wall Street, another in Silicon Valley, and another originally from a garage in Colorado.The production is very stylish and bright, presumably to dress up what might otherwise be a dull topic. The anguish at the stupidity of the situation, where banks are packaging toxic assets as if they were investment grade also creates emotional space for the actors to explore, but ultimately the story is told with an unduly heavy hand, as one might expect from Hollywood. The events are dramatic enough that a little scaling back of the acting might have served the story better. But Hollywood movies don't work that way; someone always gets to take the lead and ham it up, while others play it straight.What's disappointing is that The Big Short is ultimately a highly orthodox, doctrinaire, short-sighted, lightweight and ignorant critique of capitalism. The film, and presumably Lewis (I have not read the book it's based on) completely miss the big picture context of government regulations forcing banks to make subprime loans as a form of 'social justice' by getting otherwise unqualified buyers into home loans. This is touched on briefly in the scenes with the mortgage brokers, but the movie perhaps intentionally ignores the context of why it happened in the first place. It is blind to the underlying causes.I can only suppose that this is because it goes against the orthodox leftist premise that business, markets and capitalism are bad, and that governments must act in opposition to them lest they prey upon innocent people. The reality is that government policies forcing banks to make bad loans created the situation, starting decades earlier. The culmination was collapse, but the fundamental cause was government intervention in the economy. Even Congressman Barney Frank, a staunch champion and initiator of such intervention, ultimately admitted this was a mistake after the crash.Google for the Community Reinvestment Act and the role of Freddie Mac and Fannie Mae in underwriting bad loans and educate yourself about the facts. Don't be spoonfed incomplete and one-sided information.",8,0,0,15 April 2016
Iron Man," An excellent film, much better than expected
","Iron Man hits just about every note nearly perfectly. The tone is light but not saccharine, look is fresh, visuals beautiful without drawing attention to themselves, acting fine, writing very good, plot way better than the usual comic-inspired film. Much better than I was expecting. If this is an example of what Marvel Comics can do when it has full ownership of the movie making process, then I hope they make many more. Very, very well done in all aspects.Downey's character had a change of heart in the film, but stayed true to character. His performance was funny, touching, tough, gentle and human. Paltrow created a nuanced character with fragility, wit, grace, charm, self-doubt, perseverance. Terrence Howard played an excellent sidekick with dignity, foibles, incredulity. Jeff Bridges had the only really 'comic book' bad guy role, and I found his version lacked nuance. Maybe that's appropriate for the type of character as written, but I found it to be the least convincing. His deviousness and double-crossing nature were present, but his badness was hammy.",10,1,3,22 October 2008
The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King," Awe inspring film making
","Return of the King is surely one of the most spectacular films yet made. Excellent acting, photography, and effects used in the service of story. This dazzling display of filmaking includes hundreds of real horsemen, thousands of extras, and CGI creatures that are simply spellbinding and easily some of the best anyone has made so far.The tone of this film is remarkably light and gentle for one that partakes of such dense action sequences at times. It maintains its humanity even in the face of the barbaric hammering and destruction of battle.
Perhaps it's only shortcoming is that the ending drags on a bit, but in the context of a 9.5 hour marathon, the multiple, consecutive endings could be perfect curtain calls for the cast and tender farewells to beloved characters.",10,0,0,18 December 2003
The Matrix," Mildly entertaining, not great
","The Matrix has excellent special effects, ok if exaggerated action scenes, mixed acting, an ok premise and somewhat weak story.  Fishburne is quite good; Reeves is flat.  I found the screenplay threadbare, giving the actors not enough meat to work with.  The premise is marginal and a bit watered down to make it as science fiction. The story and direction leave holes big enough to drive trucks through. 
About half way through the movie disbelief kicked back in and the film seemed merely a platform for special effects. In comparison, Mel Gibson's Payback is a more intriguing and better directed revenge/action flick, and Johnny Nmemonic (also featuring Reeves) has better Cyberspace science fiction.This is a violent film, which I have little problem with in general, but here it's particularly de-humanizing which I *do* object to.  Payback is extremely violent and profane, but the violence is focussed and meaningful in that it serves to advance the plot and has human consequences.  The violence in The Matrix blends a cartoon-like disregard for its consequences with an elitist notion that it's all ok because the human victims have been brainwashed by the bad guys and are essentially pawns in a larger game.  Violence should have a moral dimension or at least move the plot if it's to have meaning.  If not, it desensitizes viewers to violence which can't be a healthy thing for society. It also makes for a boring movie.",8,0,0,29 December 1999
