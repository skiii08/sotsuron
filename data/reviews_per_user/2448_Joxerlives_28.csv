Captain Phillips," Entertaining and informative
","I actually served in Task Force 150, the international fleet dedicated to anti-piracy operations in the Indian Ocean and this brought back a lot of memories. We never caught any pirates but that's largely because if they saw something big, grey and pointy on the horizon they'd dump their weapons overboard and play act at being fishermen again (but I guess preventing hijacks was half the job).Very interesting with a good performance from Hanks especially. How long since you saw a film dealing with the lives of ordinary sailors, the 'truckers of the sea'? Probably not since WW2 propaganda films frankly. It's interesting that Philips isn't necessarily depicted as the most popular captain in the world, very realistic in my experience, the company man who has to balance the welfare of his crew against the demands of his employers, the crew enduring long periods of isolation, danger and wearying duties at sea keen to get every penny they can in exchange for it, conscious of the value of their cargo and how important to the owners that it is delivered on time. Also a nice touch that we get to see the Somali side of things. It doesn't sugar coat it, these guys may have started out as fishermen who started hijacking foreign deepsea trawlers which had plundered their waters dry but we see that this is actually big business and organised accordingly. They're not depicted as evil (maybe that would be different today with the rise of Islamic fundamentalism in Somalia?), they're depicted as human, we can identify with them if not sympathise entirely. Nice to see Max Martini, one of my favourite actors from The Unit who always seems to be portraying Special Forces types. A shame they never fitted in the true story of the CIA's Somali-speaking interpreters who made their first parachute jump each strapped onto a Navy SEAL, at night, directly into the shark infested Indian Ocean so that they could negotiate Philips' release. Always cracks me up the scene where the pirate who has been taken aboard the US warship to negotiate (thus neatly reducing the number of targets the SEAL snipers have to simultaneously take out by a quarter at a stroke) is informed that his friends are all dead, Philips is free and he's now under arrest in no uncertain terms, going from holding all the cards to holding zip in a matter of seconds.Favourite scene however has to be when they phone up the US Navy's emergency helpline and no one answers, the sort of thing that happens in real life but you'd never see portrayed in fiction (at least the Royal Navy answers the phone even if the WREN on duty can't offer anything but hopeful advice).",6,2,3,6 June 2014
Skyfall," By far Craig's best Bond so far
","I was never a big fan of Daniel Craig's previous 2 outings as Bond. He seemed rather soulless in many ways compared to his predecessors although he probably ties with Timothy Dalton as closest to what Fleming had in mind (and I'm certainly not fond of the Bond in the books whom you would probably cross the road to avoid if you met him in real life). The tone of the previous 2 films was also something I wasn't too fond off, I'm not sure I want to sit around on a bank holiday watching Bond having his testicles beaten and why they felt it necessary to include the rape scene in 'Quantum of Solace' is beyond me?But Skyfall makes up for that in a great many ways. Genuinely exciting and with some thrilling action sequences, Daniel Craig really seems to have found his stride in the role (much as Connery and Moore didn't produce their best Bond film until their third outing). What's more we very much have a more emotional and human Bond in this version, bitter at M for her treatment of him, disillusioned with the service but still faithful to it, a decent cynic (an allegory for Britain's place in the world?). Very much more set in the real world, M battling against parliamentary oversight and ethical questions as to the morality of the double-Os, (shades of the War on Terror?) being held to account for a fiasco that is in no way her fault and finding herself the scapegoat for press, public and parliament. We finally explore Bond's past, finding him an orphan with M cast very much as a mother figure to him as the villain points out. With her death and the introduction of a new male M, Q and Moneypenny we have almost a complete reboot of the series. Good stuff? Love Moneypenny, didn't guess the twist until the rooftop sequence where she talks about taking a backroom job. Wonderful train sequence, right up there with Roger Moore in 'Octopussy' and the bike chase is terrific. M's death comes as a complete shock, really was the last thing you expected. I kept expecting one of the supporting players to be revealed as a traitor but they never were. Love the very human and fallible Bond who is genuinely out of shape and can't shoot straight, too often in films we have heroes who are supposed to have gone to pot yet perform feats that would be beyond the ability of an Olympian. The Bad? The death of the villain's girlfriend was depressingly predictable and the sadism of it distasteful. The whole thigh-stroking scene was a bit out there (especially given the homophobia of Fleming's books), I wondered if we were watching Torchwood or something? The idea of luring the villain to a final showdown wasn't bad but couldn't Mallory have dispatched a helicopter full of SAS to help them out? One cliché I find truly distasteful is that evil=deformed, human nature maybe but I'd rather have a deformed hero than a villain. All told great stuff and I look forwards to Craig's next 2.",8,2,9,18 November 2012
Lone Survivor," Good film but the shouldn't have changed the ending
","Great film with so many good points. The depiction of the harsh training for the SEALs is agonising to watch but when you see what they had to go through in combat (or even the hike in over such arduous terrain with such heavy loads) you realise why. Life with the SEALs back at base seems like an eternal frat party if everyone was an ultra-professional/competitive Olympic level triathlete with lethal combat skills. The dance scene was a little baffling although the 'Introduction/We don't care' bit was very true to life (actually I think Paton is a great dancer and very much the cliché SEAL in appearance, like something from the cover of one of those corny SEAL/SWAT romances on Amazon). The action scenes are great and super realistic although oddly I thought the scenes where they fall down the cliffs were more shocking than when they get wounded. The depiction of the Afghan villagers helping the SEALs was also good to see, so often they end up stereotyped as the bad guys, good to see that Hollywood realises there are factions and levels to Afghan society.Personally I think they overdid the whole 'Band of Brothers' aspect but that's part of the SEAL mystique and true to the book. Some people question why the Apaches were taken away to help the army convoy but no way could you justify not sending them to help troops in actual combat because they MIGHT be needed to support the much smaller SEAL team whose mission seemed to be going OK at that point. Personally if I was in their prisoner predicament I would have taken the shepherds with me until I was able to establish comms then tied them to a tree and stabbed them all in the calf. By the time they bit through their bonds and hobbled back to the village the team would be clear. But you can't second guess the man on the ground and you have to agree with Lutterall that even that would probably have earned them criticism from certain people who either have no understanding of their situation or hypocrites who don't even want to try to empathise with those at the sharp end. It's an interesting comparison to the British SAS mission Bravo 2 Zero which also had comms difficulties and was compromised by a goatherd. The bad point of this fim is the ending which is pure Hollywood. In real life Lutterall was helped to escape into the woods by the Afghan villagers and is discovered by an army search team. In the book the Taliban attack the village and are eventually repulsed with help of the army rescue force, the heroes personally dispatching the main villains, one in hand to hand combat in the worst possible Hollywood cliché. Why they chose to do that is unfathomable, Lutterall's story is amazing enough as it is, it doesn't require any such embellishment. Another inaccuracy is the fact that Lutterall never witnesses the rescue helicopter being shot down but that's forgivable for dramatic purposes. Some controversy arises about the number of enemies the SEALs faced, some saying hundreds, others putting it as low as single figures. As always the truth probably lies somewhere in between, the Taliban and various elements who wish to criticize the film wanting to play it down, those who wish stress the heroism of the SEALs/aircrew wanted to elaborate it.All told excellent film, really enjoyed it.",7,1,3,8 February 2014
Alien: Resurrection," Third best in the Alien series (but a LONNNGGGG way behind Alien/Aliens)
","Alien is rightfully considered possibly the finest horror/sci-fi film of all time (The Thing and The Fly its' only real competitors, interestingly both remakes). Aliens is the best sci-fi/action film of all time and for a long period my favourite film ever. And then we had Alien 3. If they had been deliberately TRYING to make a bad film that would ruin the series I don't think they could have done a better job and really the franchise never recovered. Alien; Resurrection was a valiant attempt to put things right and my boy Joss Whedon does a commendable job. But he had a long way to climb after the debacle of Alien 3. Really Resurrection isn't a great film overall but it has some terrific things about it. Sigourney is great as always, Wionna does OK in her role, the relationship between Cal and Ripley 8 is brilliant and spawned a thousand slash fanfics. You can see the beginnings of Firefly here, even down to a prototype Jane and River. The scene where Ripley 8 looks longingly at the picture of the little girl who reminds her of Newt is just heartbreaking (come on Joss, why didn't you include a scene during the evacuation where a Michael Biehn lookalike is glimpsed escaping the ship with a little blonde girl, they could always have cloned them too). Love the fact that Walmart have now taken over Weyland-Yutani. The female space pirate has the most AMAZING figure and the director takes pains to show it off. Set pieces like the underwater battle are terrific. OK, so the newborn looks stupid and it rather spoils the implied parent/child relationship with Ripley (note the newborn actually chooses its' human side over its' Alien heritage). It's a little hard to sympathise with the pirates when they kidnap the poor workers but you have to assume that they didn't know what was going on. The idea that the scientists would be so stupid as not to acid proof the Aliens' cells is ridiculous. A better storyline would be if the space pirates were actually condemned prisoners the military were going to use for alien breeding but when Cal stages a breakout in order to get to Ripley it frees the other prisoners and they inadvertently release the aliens.Is it just me or is there something a little GOT-fic about the Alien drone carrying Ripley away? Joss sure has his heroines have some deeply weird sex! Great ending though, the bugs blasted to atoms (along with poor Angola!), Ripley has her ship, her crew and her little girl back and can now become a female version of Mal Reynolds, she has her happy ending at last after all she's been through and finally returned to Earth (which she never did in the previous 3 films). She and Cal gaze at the beauty of their world and Ripley observes that she's a stranger to Earth herself...Ripley has become the alien. I was actually only going to give this film a 7 but thinking of that final scene I've decided to give it 8.",8,0,0,18 May 2013
Argo," Proof you don't need explosions and gunfights to make an edge of your seat thriller!
","Gotta say, loved it, loved it, loved it! Brilliantly done, very unusual that the extremely liberal Hollywood (and famous leftie Ben Affleck) makes a movie with the CIA as the good guys. Some have said that it unfairly depicts the Iranian revolution but frankly when you watch the end credits you see how exactly true to life the films depiction of events is (the man being hanged from a crane in the Tehran street is especially disconcerting). If anything the film tones things down a bit to be painstakingly even handed, the scene where Iranians in the US are attacked by angry crowds as a mirror image of what is going on to the diplomats in Iran. The storming of the embassy scene and the part where their van drives through the crowd is probably the closest thing you'll ever get to a real life zombie movie. The panic and yet practicality of the diplomats is great, destroying all the sensitive materials before they end up in Moscow by the end of the week, knowing that they're helpless and can only delay the inevitable. The scenes where the kids reassemble the shredded material is very creepy and some great acting by the Iranian actors in the bazaar scene, just exploding into frenzied rage over nothing. In real life the British Embassy does take the Americans in before passing them to the Canucks and the Kiwis also help with the escape. Love all the Hollywood stuff, terrific performances all round, especially the scene where they buy the script. I think the 'Argo F*&k yourself!' line may be one of my favourite ever. The Iranian guide in the bazaar scene is also great, his idea for a movie very believable, you'd almost want to see it. It is amazingly good, the details they took to recreate the late 70s are fantastic, the 70s government offices are so realistic I keep expecting to see Diana Prince walk across the background. Especially loved all the science fiction refs, most of all the extras hanging around the studio lot in their Cylon outfits from Battlestar Galactica. The bureaucratic wrangling and inter-department infighting back in Washington are exactly what you'd expect in real life. And what a coup to get Jimmy Carter to do his voice-over at the end! One problem, why don't the Iranians just call their air force to intercept the Swissair flight? But maybe they didn't want to annoy the Swiss as they were going after the Shah's money. The sequence where they celebrate on the plane is brilliant, you share their overwhelming sense of relief. A little unfair on the Shah and the Western intelligence agencies, they installed the Shah to prevent Iran falling under the Soviets and he did a great deal to advance his people, saying he tried to 'Westernise' his country is too simplistic a way to put it. Still, small points, it's an amazing film and deserves multiple Oscars.",9,1,3,18 November 2012
Creed," Pleasantly surprised!
","I always thought Rocky Balboa was the perfect end to the series, that it was a truly satisfying ending and we didn't need another Rocky film after this (you think of the aged boxer poster gag in 'Airplane 2'). But Creed pleasantly surprised me, its a pretty mature film, neither Rocky nor his protégé are down and out in this film, their lives are pretty good, they both just need a new challenge to fulfil themselves. Equally his opponent is no Clubber Lang, his performance and motivation are hugely credible although you wonder what American audiences will make of the scouser accent? Great performance from SS, very brave for him to now play someone so age appropriate, the love story between Adonis and his girlfriend is also fine, very believable and if they make another film I'd like to see where it goes, a budding music star going progressively deaf is a great dramatic concept. The fight scenes are good as always, Hollywood exciting in a way real boxing can never really be but also not shying away from the brutality of it all, when they're spitting blood out or when Adonis' eye swells up you really wince for them. Equally the cancer subplot really works and doesn't shy away from the reality of it, you understand Rock's reluctance for treatment having seen his wife go through the same. If I had a complaint I would have liked to have seen Rocky's son in this film. In the last he was trying to escape his dad's legacy, as Rocky comments it can't have been easy trying to have been Rocky Balboa's son on the streets of Philly. Here we have Adonis trying to live up to his father's legacy. But I guess with the death of Sly's son from a heart attack that would have been to painful for him. Reputedly the director had to persuade Sly to let him use the picture of him from Rocky 5 and the film is dedicated to his memory. Maybe if they make a sequel?",7,0,2,23 January 2016
Pacific Rim," Transformers vs Godzilla! The perfect film for 12 year old boys
","(If it had more hot girls in it then it would be the perfect film for 13 year olds, you would have thought they'd throw in a Megan Fox style character?). I can just imagine them pitching the idea to the studio executives with that line and pointing out that it would also appeal hugely to the all important Chinese market. Really it succeeds admirably for what it is but it ain't Chekov.The Good? Well you wanted giant monsters about to destroy instantly recognisable landmarks slugging it out with huge kickass robots built to stop them, you got them! And in spades! I would have liked their battles not to always take place in the middle of thunderstorms so we could see them a little more clearly but maybe the special effects weren't up to it? Nice to see Max Martini (who was always my favourite on The Unit) again although his Aussie accent needs some work. What was quite remarkable is that we have a father and son team and the father sends the son to die rather than the other way around, the ending to Independence Day in reverse? Also Idris Elba does sterling work, showing that giant monsters have absolutely no chance against his typically British stiff upper lip. I like the idea that humanity is on the ropes, that we're essentially in a Battle of Britain style situation, I always figured this is how we'd end a Cabin in the Woods style situation. The bad? Practically everything else, the central relationship doesn't really work and I just don't know why they included the whole Burn Gorman/Ron Pearlman storyline.",6,2,5,24 May 2014
American Sniper," Quite a good film but possibly the most polarising of all time?
","Judged as a film alone this is a pretty good story. Clint Eastwood directs well, the cast do a fine job, the action sequences are exciting and it walks a fine line with it's tone, veering effectively between 'war is hell' clichés and celebrating Kyle's undoubted skill and bravery. It doesn't depict war as anything but brutal and horrific and the traumatising effect it has on its' participants is plain for all to see. Having read the book my main complaint was that we don't get to see the beach-ball story (a group of 16 insurgents using beach-balls as flotation devices to attack a US position via a river, Kyle letting them get midstream then shooting out the beach-balls and letting them drown, killing sixteen enemy using only four shots) or what he actually earned his medals for, rescuing wounded Marines on a couple of occasions. If I was a to pick a favourite scene it's him killing an insurgent and his spotter not even acknowledging it, so routine has this become or him winning his future wife's hearts by holding her hair up when she drunkenly vomits on their first meeting (who says romance is dead?). What's amazing about this film is the visceral reaction to it from its' opponents who simply cannot accept it because it differs from their own viewpoint, Kyle derided as a bloodthirsty racist killing machine monster of big oil war criminals who wish to poison the children of Iraq with depleted uranium and re-establish colonialism, the entire film a work of slanted propaganda and wishing they could give it less than one star as a rating. The only conclusion you can reach is that left-wingers are deeply intolerant people who don't countenance views different to their own or that possibly they heard the hype and hadn't seen the film? I wonder if Audie Murphy or Alvin York ever had to put up with this kind of disgusting abuse?For the record Kyle never claimed to have shot looters after Hurricane Katrina, he merely discussed rumours of other special forces soldiers doing that with another SEAL. No one has ever been able to substantiate the story of shooting 2 car-jackers one way or the other nor the facts of his drunken brawl with Jesse Ventura, Kyle being dead before the case came to court so not being able to give his side (I'm happy to put it down to alcohol and PTSD on both sides).So, ignore the American Sniper bashers, it's a great film, see it with an open mind and decide for yourself.",7,6,25,28 February 2015
American Hustle," Entertaining but like its' characters empty on the inside.
","'American Hustle' is a very curious film, it just doesn't seem to be able to make up its' mind what it wants to be, comedy, drama, heist film? I think the real problem with it is that the 2 central con artists are actually pretty unlikeable, we never end up warming to them in the way the makers obviously want us to do. It's a cliché of many movies that the people who get ripped off are always greedy and unlikeable and therefore we don't feel bad when they fall for it. In 'American Hustle' their scam is to find people who are so desperate for a loan that they're prepared to advance them $5000 as a non-refundable fee (a lot of money back in the late 70s) in the hope they can arrange a much larger loan in order to save their businesses and they never even try to do what they've been paid for? Not exactly Robin Hood? The FBI meanwhile are portrayed as largely a series of conflicting fiefdoms and career opportunists who need this pair of grifters because they lack the kind of street savvy needed to blend in for these types of cases. On the good side it's probably worth watching this film just to see the amazing transformation of Christian Bale, making this famously handsome actor just unrecognisable. As a Buffy fan it's interesting to see alumni Jeremy Renner, Elizabeth Rhom and Amy Adams all in the same film. The recreation of the 70s is suitably spot on. But in the end it's all rather unsatisfying, we have a series of crooked politicians go to jail but frankly Renner's character is the most likable person in the film and the Mafia get away scot free. It's all nice to look at but ultimately vapid.",6,1,3,24 May 2014
The Thing," Perhaps the greatest sci-fi horror of all time
","How great is The Thing? Up there with 'Alien' and 'The Fly' as the greatest sci-fi horror ever (interesting that The Fly is also a remake of an earlier film). Ironically John Carpenter says that what attracted him to the story was that it wasn't about another group of dumb teenagers getting sliced up by some psycho when he practically invented that genre with Halloween. But he's right, all the characters in The Thing are capable, intelligent men faced with an unbelievable situation and dealing with it pretty admirably. Good things abound in this film, the special effects are terrific and still stand up after 30 years. The plotting is great, we're still debating aspects of the film to this day, you see something new every time you watch it. Set pieces such as the scene with the dogs, the defibrillator sequence and the blood test scene are simply marvellous. The dialogue is terrific; Garry's rant on the couch just pipping Palmer's incongruous spotting of Norris' head scuttling away. Also fond of Clark upon discovering The Thing attacking his dogs 'I don't know what's in there but it's weird and p*ssed off!' Fantastic soundtrack too, amazed that John Carpenter didn't do the music himself because Enrico does a great job, full of foreboding and tension. Good acting especially given the fantastical nature of what they're reacting to. Very little bad although it does seem a little trite that The Thing turns up in the one place on Earth where you'd reasonably expect people to have flamethrowers handy but you forgive it. So what happens in the end? Personally I figure neither Mac nor Childs is The Thing (especially given the earring revelation of the 2011 film) and either a military helicopter turns up or Kate from the 2011 film arrives in her snow cat to take them to safety. But who knows what other secrets the spaceship contains? I'd love to see a scene where they are able to contain someone infected with The Thing and ask it what it actually wants? To conquer the world, to go home or is it some sort of interplanetary explorer which is taking samples in order to understand our world? All told John Carpenter at his finest",10,1,3,4 November 2012
Aliens," Best sci-fi action film of all time!
","And for a very long time my favourite film of all time, nearly wore out my VHS cassette of it back in the 80s. How brilliant is Aliens? There just are no word to describe it, a triumph in every possible way. Great acting, from Sigourney certainly but the rest of the cast is also top notch, career making performances from Michael Biehn, Bill Paxton, Lance Henriksen and Jennette Goldstein. What a shame Carrie Hern never made another film (apparently she became a teacher?)as she's the best child actor in history, her performance is just great, especially in the Special Edition where she's given a lot more to do. Great action sequences, we actually all cheered at the 'Get away from her you BITCH!' scene and I would have loved to have seen it in the cinema where apparently audiences did the same en masse. Fantastic writing and characterisation, not just in the action scenes and dialogues but in terms of the motivation and actions, there isn't a single character who does anything where you think 'Oh come on!', everybody acts totally logically. The clever thing about Paul Reiser's character is you expect him to be evil but for a long time he's not. Fantastic music too, really adds to it in terms of excitement and mood.So what does the studio do? Give the sequel to David Fincher who could not have done more to ruin the series if he had been TRYING to! But my boy Joss rescues it in Resurrection (hence the title) and you note that in the last scene Newt asks Ripley can she dream and Ripley replies 'We both can' so I figure Alien 3 and 4 are just their dreams whilst in hypersleep on the way home.",10,0,1,27 May 2013
Enchanted," Haven't we always wanted to see Disney meet real world?
","I think an irresistible film, who hasn't wondered how at some time or another how Disney characters might manage in the real world?Great performance from Amy Adams who is very good as an innocent abroad, her cleaning up the house routine is just marvellous. My favourite character however is Prince Charming, his hunt for his bride is terrific, quite a daring scene where he goes from door to door questing for her and encounters a gay guy who eyes up the handsome man in tights at his door suggestively. Even better is when he knocks on the door of a bedraggled mother overwhelmed by her five kids who just sighs at him and says what we're all thinking, 'Too late!'. LOVE the musical numbers, if I was to have a superpower it would be that I'm able to make people perform elaborate song and dance numbers at will. Also nice to see that the female love rival who in times past would have been inevitably cast as some evil gold-digger is actually treated as a real human being and in the end get's a heck of a consolation prize in husband terms. On the bad points I'm still a little confused as to what happened to Patrick Dempsey's ex-wife, did she die or just walk out? Timothy Spall and especially Susan Sarandon are sadly wasted, I'd have liked the Wicked Queen to decide she can't go back to her old kingdom so instead stays in New York and becomes a chat show host, or Mayor or Senator or something (Hilary Clinton?) I kept expecting a scene where the police haul everybody off to a mental asylum where they try to convince the psychiatrist to release them by telling them their true life story. Would also have been a funny idea if Amy Adam's character wandering the streets had encountered a group of streetwalkers who attempt to sign her up to their pimp but maybe that would be pushing the two-level humour a little too far.All in all though, great film",8,0,0,12 February 2013
Die Hard 2," An arguably superior sequel
","Die Hard/Predator really set the bar for action movies in the late 80s (oddly I never rated Lethal Weapon despite being its' target audience and being a big fan of The Last Boy Scout). Following it up was always going to be a tough job, you couldn't have him credibly trapped again and skyscrapers had essentially used up all their possibilities but I think they succeeded admirably on all counts. The Good? Great villain in the shape of William Sandler, quite daring for them to opt for a rightwing military bad guy rather than some foreign menace as we see in 1 and 3. Fred Thompson demonstrates the presence and air of authority which so benefited him in his political career. The annexe skywalk shootout is a classic and bears much re-watching (everyone notice a pre-Terminator 2 Robert Patrick as the mercenary's team leader? And that the SWAT team actually manage to kill one of the ambushers before McClane's arrival). The twist is a killer, I remember hearing Grant and Stewart talk on the radio and thinking 'That sounds like a codeword' but it was still a massive shock when it happened, people gave a collective gasp in the cinema. But not as loudly as they cheered in the climax when he delivers his lighter line. Ultimately this is the story of the ordinary Joe taking on the high tech/superbly trained/painstakingly prepared bad guys and triumphing through his grit and ingenuity. Bruce Willis is excellent as the everyman, when he asks himself 'Oh John, what are you doing on the wing of this plane?' that's exactly what you were thinking. The Bad? The great Bonnie Bedelia is somewhat wasted and her final line extremely cheesy. You can't really get a Glock through airport scanners, it may have a polymer frame but its' insides are filled with metal. In real life the airport only had to contact the military and use their radar network to guide the planes down. You can't fire blanks from an assault rifle/submachine-gun by just swapping the magazines, you have to put an adapter device on the end of the muzzle because blanks don't produce enough recoil by themselves to cycle the bolt. How are the bad guys planning to escape, they've no hostages by the time they get onto the 747 so what's to stop the air force blowing them out of the air? Once they've kicked the bad guys out of the church why can't they just repair the cuts they've made to the cables and use control towers' equipment to land the planes?That said it's a great film and whilst Die Hard 3 isn't bad they really should have stopped at 2.",9,0,1,20 February 2013
Zulu," A film to stir the blood!
","Almost beyond parody although Monty Python has a good go at it in 'The Meaning of Life' not to mention Blackadder the Forth. Such an awesome film when you see a small force of 140 British soldiers taking on the overwhelming might of 4000 Zulus who have just massacred a British column of some 1200 men. A very, very male film with dancing Zulu brides aside only one woman with very few lines. The action scenes are thrilling with some terrific performances from Caine in particular (arguably it was this film which made him a star). You could be the most ardent pacifist in the world but still be cheering along at the cry of 'Front rank FIRE!'. It pulls no punches in terms of the violence although lacks the realistic gore of modern war films such as 'Black Hawk Down' and 'Saving Private Ryan'.Some say it's politically incorrect, we have an imperialist war with a mechanised European country taking on an African tribe. That said the Zulus have just defeated an understrength British brigade with little more than spears and shields and cunning, a feat unheard off in the history of colonialism ('You're a better man than I am because you broke a British square'-Kipling) and are well armed with the rifles they have captured. Much as 'Black Hawk Down' is a favourite film in Somalia the Zulus are actually very fond of this film as it shows their undoubted courage, toughness and intelligence (although I'm sure 'Zulu Dawn' where they win is their preferred sequel). In terms of historical accuracy it's pretty good, the more you learn about the real thing the more impressed you are with how it's depicted here. All told it is the PERFECT way to spend a rainy bank holiday and Richard Burton's narration just the icing on the cake.",10,5,5,31 December 2012
Kick-Ass," A truly original superhero film which has its' cake and eats it
","Where to begin? I have to say I was never that fussed on the whole nerd-to-hero side of this film, when I watched the DVD I basically fast forwarded through a great deal of that. Hit-Girl steals the whole damn show and deservedly so, they could ditch the entire Kick-Ass storyline and just make the film about Hit Girl and Big Daddy, the character of Kick-Ass himself only really shines in the finale when he finally comes to the rescue (twice!). Good stuff? Plenty to go around, Nick Cage's fantastic Adam West impression is bloody wonderful although I'm sure entirely lost on most of the target audience who think Christian Bale is Batman. They should definitely get Adam and Burt Ward to guest star in the sequel. The 'crazy' dance scene in the Mistmobile and the 'I know!' scene with Kick-Ass's nerd friends and the hot girl in the diner cracks me up every single time.But ultimately this is Hit Girl's film and she shines throughout convincing both as an ordinary sweet girl who loves her dad and death-in-pigtails. I have to say the violence isn't as shocking to me as the swearing, to hear an 11 year old use the C-word and MF word left me pretty speechless. You have to question Big Daddy's motivations, it's one thing to seek revenge himself but to drag his 11 year old daughter into it too? Hard to watch Hit-Girl getting stomped by the villain at the end, actually cheered out loud when she was saved. Big Daddy's death scene is also quite affecting and well played. The ending is great, she lost her dad but fulfilled his dying wish and now has friends, a loving guardian and an ordinary schoolgirls life, she can get that puppy and Bratz doll instead of playing with butterfly knives.Truly interesting thing is that this breaks two of the golden rules of superhero films. Firstly we have a truly asexual heroine. When was the last time you ever saw a super-heroine who wasn't also a sex-goddess whom everyone drooled over all the time? Even Wonder Woman's little sister Wonder Girl was clearly a nymphet. But Hit Girl is 11 years old and thus entirely non-sexual (and if you disagree, seek therapy). When she dresses as a schoolgirl to gain entrance to the villain's lair it's to emphasis her innocence rather than exploit any sexual fetish. Although you have to wonder what they will do in the sequel when she will be in her mid teens? Secondly they use guns. Unwritten rule of superheroes is that they don't use guns but Hit Girl and Big Daddy obviously read The Punisher rather than Superman or Spiderman. Kick-Ass eventually joins them, becoming a full blown vigilante and killing at least three people. Ultimately unless you genuinely have superpowers nothing beats lead (or bazookas). So, great film and I can't wait for the sequel.",9,3,4,20 August 2013
Transformers," The perfect film for 15 year olds of all generations
","As a kid I never actually collected the Transformer's toys or watched the cartoon show (always enjoyed a lie-in on Saturday morning and we didn't have a video recorder yet). I did stumble across the comics and was hugely impressed with them, fortunate enough to enjoy the British versions which are commonly accepted to be far superior to their American counterparts. Now people of my age-group are the makers and shakers in Hollywood so we're getting films/TV shows based on the culture of the 1980s, both the good (GI Joe aka Action Force/Battlestar Galactica), the bad (The A-Team/Miami Vice, shudder!) and the mediocre (Knightrider TV series/Tron). I'm sure Automan, Manimal, Cover Up and the Care Bears are not far behind. The moment I saw that car ad where it transforms into a dancing robot I knew it was inevitable.So the good? The robots themselves are just terrific, couldn't ask for better, watching them interact realistically with humans is mind blowing. The speed, ferocity and sheer destructiveness of their combat takes your breath away, the opening attack on the US military base just stunning, you instinctively think nothing short of a tactical nuclear weapon could stop Blackout. Megan Fox is drop dead gorgeous if a little plastic and I would call the shameless exploitation of her body reprehensible if it were not for the fact that she used it to transform herself into a huge star, going from little known sitcom actress to pin-up girl of every teenage boy in the world. It really reminds you of Bo Derek in '10' or Cameron Diaz in 'The Mask'. Love the scene where she's introduced to the hero' parents, his mother delighted her son has found such a lovely girl and his dad visibly impressed by his boy scoring such an incredible hottie. The Bad? Plenty, incomprehensible plot, why drag the Maguffin from the centre of the desert to the city where the battle presumably kills thousands? John Voight and John Turturro slumming it for the sake of a paycheque, Shia LaBeouf is rubbish (what does everyone see in him?). Josh Duammel is handsome and looks good in uniform but his character is largely pointless. Too many human subplots (what the hell is the point of the hackers?) and not enough giant robots. Disappointing that they change what some of the robots transform into, especially Megatron who whilst the bad guy always had a brutal charisma about him. And why kill Jazz, everybody's favourite Autobot?So, not bad but could have been a lot better",6,0,0,1 July 2014
Black Hawk Down," One of the greatest war movies of all time!
","And one that should be shown to every cadet at Sandhurst/West Point.Hard to know where to begin in praising this excellent film. The direction is terrific, the action sequences mind-blowing, the characterisations and acting very good, brilliant music, the list goes on. The gore is graphic yet never gratuitous. It is amazingly realistic, you really feel that you are in the heat of a genuine battle, right down to people being deafened by their own gunfire which always happens in real life but which I've never seen on screen before. No other film has ever captured the confusion and chaos of combat, the convoy getting lost because of the delay between the helicopters giving the directions and the convoy receiving them was the fatal flaw of the operation. The part where the helicopter commander begs the convoy to slow down so he can relay directions correctly whilst Colonel McKnight tells them they can't slow down because they're getting slaughtered is just the sort of thing you'd expect in real life. And the lesson here? Keep it simple! It's a thrill ride yet at the same time it's a thoughtful film, this isn't an exercise in US imperialism, the US (and UN's) intervention in Somalia must rate as one of the most altruistic and unselfish actions of all time, with the Cold War over Somalia was of no strategic importance to anyone and the military intervention purely humanitarian. One thing that stands out is that this is perhaps the greatest example of the compromises inherent in film-making. Many of the characters are combined with other real life figures but otherwise you simply wouldn't be able to keep track of who was who, it would be a hundred stories in one. In real life everyone had shaven heads and wore the same headgear without their names on it but you had to have that for the audience to be able to recognise everyone. The film-makes pull off the remarkable feat of changing facts to aid the story-telling but keeping the integrity of the real events intact.Favourite scene? The bit where Ranger Jamie Smith is badly wounded and the medic tells HQ that unless he gets evacuated immediately he's going to die. And General Garrison makes the decision that they've already had 2 choppers shot down and if they try a rescue they'll have a third and more casualties to deal with. His decision seals Smith's fate but you get the idea that it's unquestionably the right one. So often in films the top brass is portrayed as cold and unfeeling but here you realise why a General earns his payAll told this is the war movie that sets the bar for all others.",10,9,14,9 December 2012
Avengers: Age of Ultron," Joss should really go back to TV
","Went to see it, liked it better than the first one, some great touches like Thor's little double take when Cap America is able to move his hammer by about a millimetre. Quite surreal as my train to work takes me past Hendon Police College in London and you can see the tower blocks and other buildings they used for the Russian town. I'm not sure what Sir Robert Peel would have thought about his statue was transformed into Lenin for the length of the filming? It lacked the magic of Joss' TV shows though but I couldn't help but think that the Vision's line could have easily have been said by Giles'.Some good stuff and there's no denying that. The Vision's 'I was born yesterday' line was classic Joss and no mistake. It was very interesting to see the Avenger's greatest fears, especially Captain America's. I always though Cap's worst fear would be the Nazis goose-stepping along Pennsylvania Avenue or being a irrelevant nothing during WW2. But instead what he really fears is an end to war, he justified everything to himself by the moral conflict but with it gone what is there for him to do? (don't worry Cap, we'll never run short of wars). Black Widow's horrific memory of being sterilized in order to make her the perfect assassin is just beyond disgusting.And the ending? Well am I the only one who thinks that the figure is going to be inevitably Galactus?",7,2,7,3 May 2015
Puss in Boots," He's got cat class and he's got cat style...
","'Puss in Boots' is a character that rings true to anyone who's ever kept (because we all know you never truly 'own' any cat) a ginger tom, the lead guitar player of the feline world. Casting him as a swashbuckling, devil may care, womanising, hero with a dark past (yet can still turn on the cutest of the cute when he has to) was truly a masterstroke and Antonio Banderas could not have been more perfect in the role, you half wish that he could have been so good as Puss' human counterpart Zorro. We also have a perfectly cast Salma Hyek as the wonderfully named 'Kitty Softpaws' (Ian Fleming would be proud) and seeing the 2 characters on screen you can just see the 2 actors so clearly in your mind. Frankly I would love to see them both together in a live action production, you get the impression that they would have such wonderful on screen chemistry. The dance fight at the tavern is hugely entertaining although you wonder at the tastefulness of moves such as 'The Litter Box' in a children's film? Not to mention Jack and Jill's baby conversation? The story is OK, I like the scene where Puss and Humpty are on the clouds and Humpty tells him to look down, reminding him of when they were both children at the orphanage who would stare up at the sky in wonder, you get the feeling that this wasn't part of the scam and that he actually meant it. So all told a worthy spin off from the Shrek movies and if you weren't an auriphile before then it's probably enough to make you one.",7,1,2,24 May 2014
The Wolf of Wall Street," Unfettered excess in all its' exhilaration and disgust
","Very, very interesting film, the makers trying to do for Wall Street what they already did for the Mafia. And much like Goodfellas it is both absorbing and repellent at the same time, in a way we envy theses characters, they are the 'movie stars with (financial) muscle'. In every other way we are utterly repulsed by them and all the fast cars, booze/drugs and easy sex with hot bimbos in the world doesn't make up for the sheer vulgarity and nihilism of people for whom enough really never is enough in every sense of the words. Their office seems a nice place to work in some ways, strippers and marching bands in their underwear as a weekend treat but hellish in others, the fact that the financial magazine does a hatchet job article on the boss only to turn him into a hero for the unapologetically greedy is very telling.Great performance from Leo DiCaprio showing (alongside his role in J Edgar)that he can play a great deal more than just the pretty boy hearthrob of Titanic. Jonah Hill is also fantastic and it shows a great deal of courage on his behalf to play such an infinitely dislikeable character with practically no redeeming features whatsoever. Lovely to see Joanna Lumley too, effortlessly bringing some refined British class to all this brashness, very different to her last role as the comical Dutch receptionist in Eurotrip. Criticisms? It goes on far, far too long, there was obviously so much source material they just didn't know what to discard, you could carve out whole sections without losing any of the story. It's also hard to know where we stand on this all, the central character seems to be just fine with it all in the end and the FBI investigator seems to be the one having second thoughts of his lost opportunity.So a good film but a little too OTT.",6,0,2,24 May 2014
Army of Darkness," Terrific stuff, action, humour and horror all in one
","It's an incredibly interesting process to watch the Evil Dead series evolve over time. The first starts out ultra low budget and one of the 'video nasties' that the press was so outraged by in the early 80s. The second is very different in tone, less of a straight horror film than an action comedy. Nowadays considering some of the gorno you do get I think Evil Dead 2 would probably get away with a 15 rating. Personally I'm one who can't be bothered with Evil Dead but think Evil Dead 2 is bloody wonderful. Army of Darkness takes it one step further, really it should have gone all out to be a PG film complete with action figures but you were never going to get that in a film with blood fountains, demon rape and a central character who has a chainsaw instead of one of his hands (famously Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles is the most censored film in history because every single scene of a character wielding a set of nunchukas was edited out). Also you would have lost all the hard core horror fans from the first 2 films. Once again a terrific performance from Bruce Campbell, some killer lines and brilliant spectacle, I wonder what Ray Harryhausen thought of it all?As for the ambiguity of the ending I figure that Ash miscounts the drops and ends up in the future but eventually overcomes the deadites there and is able to return to his job at S-Mart in the present day, hence the apocalypse ending just precedes the S-mart ending (presumably Ash is too embarrassed to tell the truth).So part 4? Hmmm, I'd prefer to see maybe another story in the present time with Ash coming to the rescue but we'll see.",8,2,3,5 June 2013
Lord of War," Brilliant, entertaining and thought provoking film
","One of the few films in recent years where I walked out of the cinema and said to myself 'I'm going to buy that on DVD' then and there. Cannot praise it highly enough, great acting, an all time wonderful performance from Nic Cage eclipsing even 'Wild at Heart' and stellar supporting cast especially Eamon Walker. Great dialogue and such an intelligent film, so well written, you don't know whether to root for Yuri or Valentine. The final revelation about the UN in-security council had the audience both gasping and laughing at the same time. Surprisingly funny at times too and a quick scan of the newspapers reveals very true to life (would the US government use Yuri to supply the Syrian rebels whilst still having plausible deniability?). I love the gag where Yuri tells us that he never sold to Osama Bin Laden because he bounced cheques. All told, the sort of film that you go to the cinema to see and how it didn't win an Oscar is frankly beyond me.",10,5,8,10 December 2012
Prometheus," Interesting if a little disappointing
","Oddly enough I came to the Alien films in a very roundabout way, I watched Aliens first and thought it was the greatest thing ever then went back and watched Alien which was also superb (the greatest sci-fi action film and sci-fi horror film ever respectively). Alien 3 was the worst film of all time, not only god-awful in itself but ruining your enjoyment of the first 2 films, Alien Resurrection was decent and for the most part rescued the series (thanks Joss) but was still a long way down from the first 2 classics. AvsP are popcorn movies, better than 3 but that's really not saying much. So I was intrigued to see if Ridley Scott could restore the greatness of the series and also to solve the mystery of the 'Space Jockey' which was an essential part of the lore.Certainly a film that doesn't lack for spectacle and gore, the 'abortion' scene was really out there. The ending was pretty surreal too, be interesting to see how Liz and Michael's relationship develops? The revelations are satisfying, I must say I never suspected that the Space Jockey's facial features were simply a mask, I always thought it was a facehugger that had binded with its' fossilised host over time. On the bad side what was the point of the zombie attack sequence except to add a little action into a film which rather lacked it? We almost have a few too many characters so it's hard to distinguish between them which is very different to Alien/Aliens, Charlize Theron is pretty much wasted and killed off arbitrarily and anti-climatically and why do we have Idris Elba putting on an American accent, what was wrong with his British one? So not really up there with Alien/Aliens but easily head and shoulders above all the other films, you rather think that maybe they wanted to do a 2001 style sci-fi epic and used the Alien angle to sell it to the studio/audience?7/10",7,0,1,28 May 2015
X-Men: First Class," A surprisingly entertaining rewriting of history
","Must say I read the X-men avidly as a kid but gave up on the films as they were largely aimed towards 15 year olds which I no longer was. I was intrigued enough by this one however as it was back to the team I remember from my youth and I wondered how they would fit in with real history 'Dark Skies' style? I'm really glad I did as it turned out better than I could have hoped for. January Jones is beautiful in a very Nancy Sinatra kind of way and Jennifer Lawerance equally good as Mystique, her conversion from Dr X's fangirl into Magneto's disciple is excellently handled, you totally buy it, especially the naked confrontation between her and a very bashful Dr X in the mansion's kitchen (the film certainly has no qualms about exploiting the beauty of its' female stars). 2 wonderful cameos, a very clever one with Rebecca Romijn as the older version of Mystique and a scene stealer from Hugh Jackman as Wolverine telling Dr X and Magneto where to get off. Certainly doesn't lack spectacle either, the climatic battle is Jutland with superpowers (but neither fleet seems to deploy any aircraft?). The bad? Glaring anachronisms especially in terms of weaponry, both the US and the Soviet forces using hardware which they wouldn't develop until decades later. It rather beggars belief that the CIA would infiltrate a military team into the Soviet Union dressed in US uniforms and carrying American weaponry because they're trying to AVOID World War 3? Also a little disappointed that they kill Darwin off just so quickly and arbitrarily, I guess the black guy really does always get it first? Then again this is the 1960s, the film really misses an opportunity to address the issue, maybe the authorities try to segregate the X-men by race and they all gather together to demand equality? So all told very good and I might just go to see the current X-man film.",7,0,1,18 May 2014
The Cabin in the Woods," A typically clever Whedon twist on a very tired genre
","Big fan of Joss' work, took me a long time to get around to watching this but I'm glad I did. Very interesting film taking the great clichés of the horror genre and turning them around in a typically clever Joss Whedon fashion. We now understand why all theses nasty things keep happening to people in horror films (and why the Whore always gets it first and the Virgin sometimes survives), they're all set up in order to appease the ancient hellgods. One thing that did strike me is that the group very much remind me of the characters from Scooby-Doo, the Athlete (Fred/Curt), the Whore (Daphne/Jules), the hungry Fool (Marty/Shaggy), the Scholar (Velma/Holden) and the Virgin (Velma again). And just like Scooby-Doo they drive a camper van, encounter a creepy old man with dire warnings and it's all a set up with someone manipulating everything from behind the scenes. If only they'd brought their Great Dane with them everything would have been OK. Standout scenes, well Sigourney as good as ever. The Cabin itself is a dead ringer for that in Evil Dead 2. The array of objects in the cellar is very clever, did everyone notice Drusilla's doll Miss Edith from Buffy? Jules making out with the wolf's head is masterful, you keep expecting it to come to life and bite her but Joss defies our expectations. Love the 9 year old Japanese schoolgirls defeating the evil spirits, they're so sweet, what chance do mere hellgods have against them? It's a film that stands rewatching as you understand a lot more next time around, why does Jules, a pre-med student suddenly dye her hair blonde and start acting like a bimbo? Why does Curt, an intelligent guy suddenly start acting like some dumb jock stereotype? The merman gag is both funny AND disgusting, I'm sure Marty's flask is bound to become a collector's item. Your heart bleeds for Patience Buckner and you're a little concerned for the actress playing her when she gets knocked flying by Curt running back into the cabin, I hope that was perspective gag? So who's right? That's a tough one, we understand why the organisation seek to appease the hellgods, sacrificing the few to protect the millions but at the same time we feel for the sacrifices. But now the sacrifices have triumphed over the evil all over the world. Perhaps humanity no longer has to make sacrifices to placate the gods, perhaps the six billion of us armed with nukes have advanced to the degree that we can wipe them out without really working up a sweat? In the camper van Marty says that society needs to crumble and then begin anew and that's what happens at the end, his remark of letting someone else survive at the end is prescient, he's plunged mankind into a war but saved any future sacrifices. I'd love to see a sequel, Joss always wanted to make a post-apocalyptic series and this could be his chance. Ronald the Intern helps Marty and Dana into the Directors escape pod and they all survive to see the Hellgods blasted by a massive military attack. Cut to a year later with a much changed world which now believes in the reality of the supernatural. Ronald is in front of a congressional inquiry explaining the organisation's actions Ollie North style, werewolf Dana is now head of the supernatural faction which wants to make peace with humanity whilst the now zombie Director heads the evil faction which wishes to destroy us. But whatever happened to Marty? And why is everyone so desperate to find The Fool?Great movie with a great potential for more stories.",8,1,5,12 March 2013
Mad Max: Fury Road," The kitchen sink, the working surface and the whole damn dining room!
","Wow, you really thought that Mad Max 2 was the ultimate chase film but it really has nothing on this! It got to the point that it was utter sensory overload but never boringly so (because you cared about the characters, the ultimate secret to any action film)Okay, first off I see this as a reboot occurring just after the original Mad Max. We see Max with his iconic 'last of the V8 interceptors' police car at the beginning and as that was destroyed in Mad Max 2 we must assume that Hardy's Max and Gibson's Max one day came to a fork in the road and one went one way and the second went another. Therefore Gibson's Max is happily living out his life with the feral kids after returning to them at the end of Beyond Thunderdome, staying right there, living a long time and being grateful. Hardy's Max by contrast is still looking for redemption before finding his new family and purpose (at the end he walks away from the celebration in true cowboy style, just as Gibson's Max chooses not to go with the settlers to form their new colony 'The Great Northern Tribe' at the end of Mad Max 2, he isn't done yet). We see the beginnings of Max's moral comeback here, choosing to risk his own life when he could have walked away, finding in Furiosa and her sisterhood something worth fighting for and living for. When he finally reveals his name to Furiosa it shows that he is beginning to remember who he once was and who he might be again, no longer just a nameless drifter.All credit to some extremely brave stuntmen who made this film, really beggars belief that no one was killed in the filming. Amazing special effects too, the idea that Furiosa's missing arm was created using purely CGI is staggering. A feminist film? I guess so, we have both the 'brides' and the 'milk cows' rebelling, we have the motherhood taking over at the end. In the previous Mad Max films we'd had rape, a formidable female warrior who was then killed off and Aunty Entity, in many ways an admirable figure but also the quasi villain. Staggering that this got a 15 rating, the caesarean scene made me cringe like nothing else. All told pretty damn brilliant and definitely up for another sequel.",9,3,9,25 May 2015
Goodfellas," The reality behind The Godfather
","Both watched the film and read the book and both are amazing. In terms of accuracy they're pretty terrific, there are a few differences but they're not significant. In real life Tommy was a huge, powerful man whilst Pesci in the film is diminutive but no less terrifying. Tommy wasn't shot in the face so his family couldn't have an open coffin as featured in the film, he just disappeared and was never seen again (which is exactly what happened to his girlfriend a short time later). The famous 'funny how?' story was not actually something which happened to Henry Hill but was something which really did happen to Joe Pesci whilst he was working as a waiter for some genuine Mafioso. Tremendous performances all around, De Niro his customary excellent, a career making turn from both Ray Liotta and Loraine Brocco and did you spot a then unknown Samuel L Jackson as Stacks? In many ways though it's Pesci who dominates, prior to this he was largely known as a comic actor with Home Alone and Lethal Weapon 2, such a small guy but just full of unbelievable aggressiveness, he makes you shudder. What I really like about it is that it shows you both the good side and the bad side of being a gangster. On the good side you are the 'movie-star with muscle' everything just falls into your lap and you live the life of Reilly, even when you go to prison you're treated special. On the bad side you have to do things like dig up the rotting corpses of other gangsters you've murdered and rebury them. Keep looking over your shoulder for the police and FBI all the time. And that your friends aren't really your friends, they'll happily rat you out if they think it'll save them or slit your throat if they think there's 5 bucks in it for them ('F*ck you, pay me!') One thing I would suggest is that if you enjoyed this you should check out 'The Big Heist' with Donald Sutherland, a TV movie starring Donald Sutherland which concentrates on Jimmy Burke.",10,0,0,1 April 2013
Evil Dead II," Screw you forces of darkness, here comes a sales clerk with a chainsaw!
","I must say I never had time for the 'slice-up the helpless victims' genre of horror films, even though I spent most of the 90s working my way through the Friday 13th/Halloween films (Part6+Jason goes to Hell/Curse of Michael Myers my favourites because they break that mold). For that reason I never really cared much for The Evil Dead which fell very squarely into that genre but love, love, love Evil Dead 2 because it's so very different. It simply oozes imagination from every pore, the pace is relentless and the slapstick humour wonderfully relentless. No insult to the rest of the cast but a terrific performance from Bruce Campbell who without a shadow of a doubt owns this film (although a great deal of credit must go to Ted Rami who suffered horribly in his bodysuit as the witch in the cellar, the bit where he tips his head to the side only for all the sweat to drip out is much more horrific than any of the fake gore on screen).It's funny now to think that this was considered one of the 'video nasties' at the time of its' release, it looks so tame nowadays. Sure there's a lot of blood Shining style but the bodycount is in single figures, it's not at all sadistic and actually is pretty tongue-in-cheek and good humoured. A great thing about the DVD is the commentary, Bruce Campbell and Sam Rami are just wonderful with their comments, informative and funny as hell. Shame no Bob Tapert to complete the trio. All told an irreplaceable classic",10,2,3,5 June 2013
