Source Code," Good choice for a movie
","I really liked this movie, it just opened my eyes to appreciate the little thing around me and enjoy every moment left me alive. Only the end that i didn't like not because was bad, but cause it was too expected.",8,0,1,8 February 2020
Interstellar," Feeling confused why this was not in Oscars
","A fully shaped masterpiece. I don't know how many times this movie just made me hold my breath. This acting of Matthew McConaughey is absolutely brilliant and the scene where he listens to the messages thru the years I just really couldn't it was just devastating.
The movie is perfect from the beginning till the end. Truly perfect music and scene connection. I don't know if there is any person who doesn't feel emotional about this movie.",10,1,3,25 January 2020
Psycho," Too bad to have so many high ratings
","First of all do you all people saw the scenes of the crime? They were just awful , like I just can't unsee the bad editing, even a baby will recognize that he doesn't cut her with the knife, it's too obvious.
Second I really liked the idea , he is a schizophreniac who dresses like his mother because he misses her and feels guilty about killing her, but wasn't it better if the detective in the end didn't tell all the stuff about him they was too evidently. They had to let us think a lil bit.
Third why the movie started with a scene of this woman when she died so soon and what happens with the money and why did she wanted to steal them. It was unexpected to kill her, first I though that she is the psycho. And like the whole movie was centered about her, like she is the psycho. I don't thing the title of the film and the main characters are the same thing. For conclusion I can say that this movie is messed up, the editing and all.",6,0,7,8 February 2020
