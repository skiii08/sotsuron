Sucker Punch," Perception is determined by reality
","I for one loved this movie.I know a lot of people out there saw it as immature and pandering to the virgin 15 year old boy demographic but u need to see past that and recognize the symbolism of it all.This movie is a perfect example of how reality is determined by perception. 'Everything you see or hear or experience in any way at all is specific to you. You create a universe by perceiving it, so everything in the universe you perceive is specific to you.' â€“ Douglas AdamsYou have to realize that the whole movie is just a recap of her time in the asylum twisted by the way she perceived it. The personification of herself as this objectified girl whored out to Bleu is because that's the way she's treated by her step-father and the orderlies. Think about it: in the beginning and end of the film Bleu is just some loser orderly that runs the place from the back door where as in her dream world he becomes the 'Boss' because baby-doll saw him as the man in charge with the doctor completely under his thumb. He's the one deciding her fate and the one she must ultimately overcome to escape her subjugation. There are so many examples of this throughout the entire movie but you need to look past the short schoolgirl outfits and fishnet stockings.Another interesting thing I saw was how baby-doll identified her struggles by the imaginary worlds she went to overcome them. The first one is when she needs to find the strength required to face an overwhelming world she's dropped into. The old wise man being the source of that inner strength giving her all the 'weapons' she needs to fight would be the doctor trying to help her in the therapy sessions or some long lost father figure (maybe her father who was loving and supportive before he was lost to her giving her the confidence she needs to overcome) and the demons themselves seeming so dauntingly powerful that they appear as 10 foot tall demon samurai warriors.After that we go to the German trenches where she's joined by her 4 cohorts. Funny how when she needs to find the strength of a leader she imagines a world where she has to somehow lead these women into battle against a horde of undead Nazi soldiers.Anyway, probably going to run out of room here soon so I'll just say this; This is the type of movie Hollywood needs to keep making. Its visually stunning while surprisingly deep and thought out. And to those who didn't get it or hate it, that's fine just watch something else and enjoy.",8,6,10,15 October 2012
