Ghost," Mostly good film, just a shame about those horrible damnation scenes
","I must say that, in most respects, I found 'Ghost' a very good film.  It made me laugh, it made me cry, and it probably made me feel a lot of other things too.  The only parts of it I really did not like were those truly horrible scenes where assorted bad guys die and are shown being dragged off somewhere probably-not-at-all-nice by ghastly shadowy spectres or demons. Were those scenes really necessary?",Null,1,2,28 September 2001
Saving Private Ryan," THIS MOVIE SUCKS!
","Yes, I know lots of people regard this film one of the greatest war movies ever made blah, blah, blah, but I personally found it one of the most grotesquely overrated pieces of crap I have suffered through in a long time (as far as World War 2 movies go, only the recent version of 'The Thin Red Line' was more torturous).  While its portrayal of the horrors of war was supposed to be profoundly shocking, I found it all rather amusing in a sick sort of way myself, and during the initial scenes where the Allies were landing at Normandy and getting massacred, I found myself inflamed with feelings of BESTIAL WARLUST and smirking rather evilly at various particularly violent and/or gory moments (eg where that troop carrier opens up, only to have its entire human cargo mowed down in seconds by German machine gunners).  Once this part of the movie had ended, however, I found the whole thing rapidly getting boring: so much so that, during the violent scene right at the end, I found myself squirming and fidgeting in my seat, wondering when it would all be over.One of this film's main faults is that it doesn't have much of a storyline to speak of and its whole premise (while admittedly based on a real-life incident) seemed rather ridiculous to me.  Stupidly going for the bad guys (as is a habit of mine when watching movies) also didn't help, and I particularly detested all of the overt religiosity in the movie (such as all those highly offensive scenes of cross-kissing, and all those equally nauseating comments by the Americans about how God was on their side in the war (quite frankly, if God exists, I don't think he cares about stuff like this)).  In addition to all of these other faults, the final scene is VILE (last long enough to get to it and you'll hopefully see what I mean).In summary, therefore, A HUNDRED MEGATON THERMONUCLEAR BOMB!",1,20,44,18 March 2001
Any Given Sunday," Overrated, self-important film
","Warning: may contain spoilers.When I saw the preview for this movie, it gave the impression that the film would be some cutting-edge expose of the way that evil corporate greed is threatening the future of one of America's best-loved sports.  What it instead turned out to be was a rather lame movie about some struggling gridiron team's attempts to reverse its rather pitiful performance and save itself from extinction.  Then again, from what I've heard, Oliver Stone seems to have a rather notorious reputation for vastly overinflating the importance and significance of his cinematographic creations (just look at 'Platoon' and 'Natural Born Killers').Basically, 'Any Given Sunday' seems to consist of little more than an endless succession of football games as the team we're all supposed to cheer for (the presumably fictitious Miami Sharks) takes on everyone else in the competition and tries to whip their asses.  There's also a bit of off-field politics: much of it involving Cameron Diaz's character.  Although she's supposed to be a real bitch, I didn't consider her particularly evil; all she seemed to be doing was trying to run the Miami Sharks as a sound business.  Far more disturbing, and truly worthy of the title of BITCH, was the wife of Dennis Quaid's character.  The last individual wants to quit football because he's getting too old and racking up too many injuries, yet his selfish cow of a wife refuses to let him.  Not only that, but when he gets in an argument with her over it, the bitch actually slaps him!  If the roles were reversed, everyone would be jumping up and down and screaming domestic violence, but presumably, because she's a woman, it's OK for her to lash out at her spouse like a spoilt little child who can't get its own way.Another big gripe that I had with this movie concerned an injury shown in the final game.  Was it REALLY necessary for some guy to get one of his eyeballs ripped out in that?  Ugh, it makes me nauseous just thinking about it!In summary, this was really nothing more than just another football movie: one with no real surprises in it.  Not TOO bad if you like that sort of thing but don't expect anything deeper from it.",Null,0,0,16 August 2001
Star Wars: Episode IV - A New Hope," Those poor stormtroopers...
","Star Wars is one of those films, I fear, which, while undoubtedly good, has been idolized to a ridiculous degree: to such an extent, in fact, that I believe there are actually sad losers out there who have turned Star Wars into some sort of religion or way-of-life (a bit like the Trekkies with Star Trek).  While I must admit that I enjoy the film and its sequels myself, they're not THAT good, and some of their scenes and special effects (especially in the first) are looking embarrassingly dated by now eg the computers in the Death Star, and virtually everything in the climactic final scenes over that feared Imperial construction.Anyway!  As the above summary may suggest, these are not my main beefs with Star Wars.  My main gripe with the Star Wars films (especially the first), and something that I feel does not get enough of a mention, is the appalling treatment meted out to the stormtroopers in them.  I must admit, I have something of a stormtrooper fixation.  Their uniforms are very cute (and what I wouldn't do to be able to slip into one myself), and I was actually led to believe that they were halfway decent at their jobs (they are, after all, in the frontline when it comes to enforcing the Empire's feared and evil rule).  So why, then, are their lives so cheap in Star Wars, and why do so many die such humiliating deaths eg falling off ledges or into pits, or being shot almost as an afterthought by show-offy arseholes like Han Solo. It's a disgrace!  Those guys deserved a lot better.",Null,2,3,20 August 2001
