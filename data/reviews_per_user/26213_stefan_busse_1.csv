Captain Phillips," Edge-of-your-seat reality thriller
","Remember the news about Somali pirates? This thrill ride of a movie Introduces us to the main players of 21st century piracy. While we learn a little more about the similar job motivation of pirates and merchant ship seamen during the 133 minutes of this excellent film, the main focus is the intense drama during the hostage taking and stand off with US navy. I was on the edge of my seat from the first attack on the US merchant ship to the end credits. The film flew by me thanks to the intensity and documentary-style story telling. Still, I felt the fate of Somali people and their economic misfortune deserved a few more minutes of screen time to shed some light on the pirates desperate situation.Watch it if you can handle a film where there is no opportunity to feel good or at ease, not even to mention laugh, until the very end. The happy ending for one individual saves it and makes you leave the theater OK. Will not be a blockbuster, but it is worth watching it!",8,3,13,5 October 2013
