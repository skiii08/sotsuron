Skyfall," Top 5 modern bond film.
","When I first watched this in the cinema I was a bit harsh. Upon recent reviewing I understand the intracacy of the writing and plot. This is bond at his finest, covering his aging, principles, and overall history of his life and relationship with MI6. This is a smart movie and highly recommended.",9,3,6,9 September 2019
Fight Club," Instant Classic
","This really is a well rounded movie. The story, acting, directing..etc all blend together perfectly to create a memorable experience. The part at the end where they fight to the death with clubs is pretty intense. I could really have done without all the Subway Club Sandwich product placement spots.",10,1,3,29 May 2017
Us," Great directing and acting, stupid story with potholes
","Jordan Peele is an extremely talented director, and the actors in this film really commit. The story, oh the story just has too many holes and question marks that it can easily Piss you off.",7,0,1,19 August 2019
Aquaman," Entertaining film but nothing special
","The movie provides a fun summer Blockbuster with special effects, action, and entertainment galore. The actors all have their charm and the cinematography has that Hollywood sheen to it. There are just a few things I can't ignore that glaringly bothered me....It's downright offensive how many scenes this movie downright steals or copies from other films. Tron, fifth Element, Indiana Jones to name a few. The cheesy dialogue at moments didn't help either.",7,0,0,25 August 2019
Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse," Spectacular and creative movie
","Top 3 Spiderman movie of all time. Must watch film for any Spidey fan. Amazing animation, creative story, and well worth the price of admission.",10,0,1,14 July 2019
Mother!," Hello Smother...I mean mother
","The acting was superb all around, the visuals magnificent, and direction flawless. Having said that this abortion of a film should burn in a house fire. (Pun intended)I had to research a Reddit article explaining the film because I had no flapping idea what the hell I just watched. (Not everyone is christian or religious FYI Aronofsky) After reading it, it makes perfect sense... If the funny Reddit article explanation was more enjoyable than the 2 hours I spent with the film.....ummm yeah...never again.",6,0,2,29 January 2018
Da 5 Bloods," Well crafted movie with hefty themes
","Strong movie from a strong director. Solid acting, weighty themes, heavy moments. Accurate depiction of racism, war, and ptsd. I can see how it is not a movie for everyone, some of the dialogue and situations are a bit irritating and annoying or heavy handed. Overall worth a watch, but I didn't find it extraodinary or a 90% at all like many seem to.",7,5,14,15 June 2020
