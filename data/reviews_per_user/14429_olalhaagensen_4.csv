Once Upon a Time... in Hollywood," Very nicely filmed. Characters were amazing.
",This is a different movie from django kill bill etc. This focuses more on character and in some wierd way just makes everything enjoyable. Just an excelent movie to enjoy and have a good time.,10,23,32,19 August 2019
The Lion King," No heart. No original songs. Boring
","Only a couple of good items in this film. Puumba and timon are great saving the only real movie magic left in this wierd and wrong remake, if Disney has got so good cgi then a new original movie would be a much better idea than remakes.",4,2,4,3 August 2019
It Chapter Two," It chapter 2 is good. But its unlike the first.
","To start of. IT c 2 is not as good as IT, but its a very worthy sequel. It is full with flashbacks, some good some ok, but overall they fill up empty spaces from the old it and the current. Andy muschietti knows how to really use pennywise. In this movie it is a bit less of that and more characters, but when pennywise comes on the chills go down the back. This is a solid movie. And as icing on the cake, it is funny aswell. GO SEE IT",7,44,87,6 September 2019
