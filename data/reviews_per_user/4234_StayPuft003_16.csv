Kill Bill: Vol. 2," Wow... Again
","What a well made film. Following the first amazing volume of Kill Bill, I had no idea what to expect. What I got, was one of the best films I've ever seen. There is much more drama and good dialog in this Volume than in the first, much less action, and much more character development. You find out the full story of Beatrix Kiddo (AKA The Bride AKA Black Mamba AKA mommy) and it is just as jaw-dropping as the story told in the first half. The black and white is used to perfection, and seeing it in color would make it worse. The acting in this movie is superb, as in the first, especially by Michael Madsen and David Carradine. I've never seen Madsen play a character so subtle before, and it really works. The dialog is sometimes amusing, and although this is not nearly as amusing as the first movie, which was hilarious (mostly due to the raunchy action), there are some very funny moments in Volume 2. Pai Mei is officially the coolest character ever in a movie, mainly because of his beard, and every character has depth and a style of their own. The cinematography, just like Volume 1, is nothing short of spectacular and the directing is, well, it's Tarantino, so its gotta be great. All in all, this movie is film making at the highest level, and is quite the joy to watch on screen and remember off screen.",9,5,10,8 June 2006
Lucky Number Slevin," Entertainment at it's best
","Lucky Number Slevin is a film that only comes around once in a long while. The writing is original and snappy, and humor works at times when you think it wouldn't. The characters, although not all of them are original, are each entertaining in their own ways. The cast gives great performances. While most people talk about how bad of an actor Hartnett is, he gives a very good portrayal of a man stuck in the middle of a mistaken identity crisis. Lucy Liu, for once, is enthusiastic in a good way and adds her own attitude to her character. Morgan Freeman, as usual, is very good, as is Sir Ben. Bruce Willis, even with his strange hairdo, does a very good job in perhaps his most intimidating role. Although the plot seems a bit confusing at some times, it all comes together when, of course, the twist ending is revealed. All in all, Lucky Number Slevin is humorous and thrilling, and for anyone who likes crime films that have originality and attitude, this is a must see.",8,5,14,7 June 2006
Memento," The Most Cleverly constructed film... ever
","Memento is the most cleverly constructed movie ever to be put on the big screen. While this is clearly what makes it such an important movie, nearly every other aspect of the film makes it one of the best films I have ever seen. The acting, especially from Guy Pierce, is phenomenal. You feel for the characters even when you don't know much about them, mainly because they don't know much about themselves. From the opening sequence, the movie hooks you in and never lets go. The story moves along quickly, and keeps you guessing from beginning to end. There is suspense, drama, violence, and even some comedy. But the thing that holds this film together is Christopher Nolan's precise direction, which keeps the viewer intrigued but unable to look away. All in all, this is a must see Crime Drama/Thriller/Mystery that will be a life changing experience for most moviegoers.",10,1,3,6 March 2007
Zodiac," David Fincher's Zodiac...
","David Fincher, although having made few films, is clearly proving to the film world that he is one of the elite directors in recent history. His new film, Zodiac, is just another example of Fincher's genius. The beginning of the film starts out with the initial murder, and it is very creepy, and VERY realistic. Right off the bat, the viewer can get a good idea about how the film is going to play out. It is very dark and very mysterious. The first hour of the movie moves very quickly with witty and intriguing dialog that keeps the viewer anxious to see how the events work themselves out.All of the actors, especially Mark Ruffalo and Robert Downey Jr., are phenomenal. And you can't forget about Jake Gyllenhaal, who I believe is one of the more underrated actors of today. Brian Cox, Elias Koteas, and even Donal Logue are very good as well.Also, even though it has a long 2 hour and 40 minute running time, it moves quickly and it barely feels as long as it truly is. This is mostly due to the great script by James Vanderbilt's script. It knows it's characters, and it figures out a way to get into the characters' heads without making it over-dramatic or corny.Lastly, The main factor that holds this film together is Fincher's directing. Obviously he is a good director, and going into the film I knew I would be in for something interesting. It was clear at most times that Fincher picked his shots out very precisely, enhancing the film's mood and keeping the film interesting throughout. Some scenes were so well-done it was haunting, especially the murder scenes. Even though the characters are on-screen for such little time, you feel for them and even cringe when they face their fates at the hand of the Zodiac.The soundtrack also deserves a lot of praise, for it keeps the nostalgic feeling of the 70's present while adding tension to some scenes that didn't even necessarily need the music in the first place.The only flaw of the movie is that at times it becomes a bit repetitive, but that is part of it's magic. The mix of the script, directing, and editing, does not even make the viewer realize this fact. But when it is evident, it is clear that the repetition is intentional to enhance the sense of obsession most of the character's feel.David Fincher's Zodiac is a very intriguing film that manages to make the viewer become more obsessed with the outcome of the film as the main characters become more obsessed with the case. All in all, it is a very mysterious, edge-of-your-seat thriller that is worthy of multiple viewings and is a must see not only for fans of Fincher, but fans of film in general.",9,6,12,10 March 2007
Full Metal Jacket," Two Parts
","Stanley Kubrick's Full Metal Jacket is a film of two parts. The first part deals with the basic training of the Marine Corps being built to become killers. R. Lee Ermey gives one of the best performances i've seen as the intense drill instructor. For most of the first part, his speeches and training tactics are very funny, but soon you realize that he does not care about these men's lives and only wishes for them to be killing machines. We realize this when he asks the trainees about some famous snipers, like Lee Harvey Oswald, who was trained to shoot in the Marines and how he respects that man for getting in so many shots in such a short amount of time and hitting his moving target twice. He truly honors Oswald. He dehumanizes them, especially a fat private by the name of Pyle (Vincent D'Onofrio). Pyle makes a few mistakes, and soon we see that the Sergeant is out to get him and seems to want the rest of the trainees to dislike him. And this Sergeant knows how to hold a grudge. There are a few spectacular scenes, and the first ten minutes are the best opening minutes to a movie I have ever seen. I was into every second of the basic training scenes, from the opening montage to the disturbing but brilliant last scene, the final confrontation between a few main characters.The second part to this movie, however, is much different. It is about life during the war. The main character of the movie, Private Joker (Matthew Modine) goes to fight with his old friend 'Cowboy' and his men in the city of Hue. I did not like this part of the film nearly as much as the first for many reasons. First of all, there was a feeling to the first part that just doesn't seem like it was there in the second part. I really felt for the characters during the training, but when they were fighting I felt less attached to them. Most of this part of the film is the men hiding behind walls and getting shot. While it is interesting, I felt that I had had enough after a little while. There is one very good part to me, when the men are being interviewed by a documentary crew. You get to see how different people saw the war, and it seemed to remind me of the dehumanization process the war brings as well as some comedy from some things the men said when answering the questions. The opening scene to the second part is also kind of amusing. Besides that, I don't have much to say about the fighting in Vietnam. Because, after all, there just isn't that much to it besides guns and blood.Basic Training: 10/10 Vietnam War: 6/10 Final Grade: 8/10",8,3,3,10 June 2006
The Machinist," Don't Want to Say too Much
","I do not want to say too much about this movie except that you should see it, for I do not wish to give away anything about it. Christian Bale gives an utterly spectacular and haunting experience and this might just be the most original movie I have ever seen. The plot seems a little odd at sometimes, but everything seems to have importance at the end. The only bad thing I can say about it is that there may be a few things that you find to be unexplained and it may seem a bit rushed. It did not feel this way to me but I can understand why someone would feel that way. Very good, the ending is good, though a little anticlimactic but it is definitely should be viewed if you have time.",7,1,2,7 June 2006
Kill Bill: Vol. 1," Wow
","To start, the main point of this is to say WOW. What a fantastic film. It's entertainment at it's best, no doubt. To be honest, before this movie I had never heard of Quentin Tarantino. But, I was young so I hope that you forgive me. This wonderfully looking film got me hooked on the drug I like to call QT. The action is great, and is a fantastic homage to Japanese films of the past, the dialogue, at least the way it is put together, is original, the acting is very good, especially for a film like this, and the action is, well, you guessed it, awesome. This is one of those movies that you watch over and over and over again and it truly never dulls down from the first time you saw it. As usual with Tarantino, the soundtrack is great, and the reason I like it so much is because it strays far away from the first three Tarantino movies, hell, even the second volume of Kill Bill. Tarantino proves that he can make any type of film. This has great comedy, great cinematography, and a spectacular anime sequence that by itself would make an awesome short movie. So many spinoffs of this movie could be made in the future, but I sadly believe that it will not happen. Oh well, I guess I'll just have to enjoy this to the fullest next time I watch it, and the next time, and the next time, and you get the point.",9,0,2,8 June 2006
Grindhouse," The most Enjoyable Experience of My Life
","Grindhouse, in a nutshell, is the possibly the most enjoyable film ever made, certainly the most enjoyable film I've ever seen. Both movies, Planet Terror and Death Proof, are great in there own ways.First was Planet Terror. A true homage to campy horror films. Basically, it was just pure fun. Rose McGowan was smoking hot, and since she was pretty much the main character, that would already make the movie worth seeing. The action in PT was awesome, lots of blood, but its not too bad, because its all very tacky and adds to the Grindhouse feel of things. It grabs your attention from the very beginning and never stops. There are no real slow moments, and most of the dialog is hysterically corny. The special effects also keep with the campiness, and fits the mood of the film. Basically, it's hysterical, action-packed, balls out fun. At times it's even pretty tense. 10/10 Then, there was Death Proof. For people who have seen Tarantino films, expect the same sort of dialog. At times it feels stretched out and useless to the plot, but that's how QT works, and in this film it's on par with all of his other films. Though not as violent as Planet Terror, it is very tense and at times pretty funny. The main thing that separates this from Planet Terror is that for the most part, you feel for the characters, and thats the magic of Tarantino's dialog. Usually, it doesn't reveal much about the characters, but when they are in tense situations, you root for them. You want them to survive, to get away, and if they don't, it enhances the experiences because emotion is involved. Death Proof does exactly that. On a different note, it has two amazing, intense scenes that will leave you shocked and in awe of QT's abilities as a movie maker. One is a crazy, violent car crash, and the other is an unbelievable car chase. 10/10 Also for your enjoyment come fake trailers that give non-stop laughs. The narrations are funny, the scenarios are funny, and some of the ideas seem like they could make pretty enjoyable films.All in all, Robert Rodriguez and Quentin Tarantino: Congratulations, you have just solidified your spots in film history.",9,0,3,6 April 2007
Reservoir Dogs," Five Reasons.
","Five Reasons why Reservoir Dogs is an AMAZING film (In no particular order): 1. The Opening Scene- The opening scene to this movie is one of the most memorable movie scenes in a long time. It really has nothing to do with the rest of the movie, but it draws you in and you can tell this movie is going to be different.2. The Music- From the opening credits to the end credits, the music sets the tone for the film like almost no other movie can do. Tarantino really knows his music and this is no exception.3. The characters- The characters are original and entertaining, each in their own different way, no matter how little screen time they get. They develop well over the story, and their relationships with each other are authentic and wonderful 4. The inter-splicing of scenes- This was one of the first films to not be shown in chronological order and it works perfectly. You don't understand the characters at first, you don't really feel for them, but as you learn their stories you care for them and understand their objectives. It also changes the tone of the movie quickly without seeming forced. If told in chronological order, it would not be nearly as good as it is in it's final cut.5. The final scene- The Mexican Standoff is thrilling and kind of humorous at the same time. It was a great way to wrap up a movie, and the dialogue is great. Also, you can feel the tension and you are thrown out of your seat at the resolution.So basically, this movie has very few flaws, and I recommend it to anybody who likes an enjoyable crime film.",9,0,2,30 May 2006
Pulp Fiction," No doubt.
","Pulp Fiction is, without a doubt, the greatest movie ever made. It is perfect in almost every way. It's dialogue is the best ever to hit the screen: witty, charming, and it has 'MEMORIZE ME' written all over it. It is wacky and original. From Jules and Vincent in their rants about McDonald's to the completely different Butch dealing with a group of rapists, every second of this movie is meant to be there. Tarantino, the brilliant movie maker that he is, does not waste one line, one action, or one of anything else you can think of. This movie is the only movie that I can watch over, and over, and over again, and it never loses steam, no matter how many times I see it.",10,0,3,30 May 2006
The Departed," High Expectations
","Going into Martin Scorsese's new film The Departed, I had the highest expectations I've ever had for a film. I heard from some people that it was better than Goodfellas, a feat only a few rare films achieve. Well, to be honest, I was a little disappointed. It was not the greatest movie ever made, but it's definitely up there, and for many reasons: 1.The acting, as guessed, is absolutely superb. DiCaprio showed that he can finally act well and be a good lead. He played his character believably and I could sense his emotion well throughout. His Boston accent was a little off at times and seemed exaggerated, but he can't be perfect. To me, this was the perfect role for Matt Damon. I never really liked him, he's not in very good movies, and his character was very unlikeable in this, which I think fit him very well. His Boston accent, of course, was phenomenal, because it was natural. Martin Sheen and Alec Baldwin also gave top-notch memorable performances in for this stellar cast. Now, to the two best performances of the film. First, Mark Wahlberg was truly perfect for his role. His character was the funniest of the movie, with a curse word coming out of his mouth every other word. His tough attitude proved to be pivotal towards the end of the movie, and he stole every single scene he was in. Jack Nicholson, as well, was perfect for his role. Every word that came out of his mouth made me believe more and more that he was not Jack, but Frank Costello, his character. He, too, has some very witty lines due to his character being crazy, as usual for him. I wouldn't say it was an original character, but it was definitely perfectly played by Jack, and I feel that this will get him his Oscar.2. The Plot in this movie is one of the more original ideas I've heard of recently. I had not heard about Internal Affairs before this film, so I thought the idea of following a rat in the Mafia and a mole in the police force was very unique and I was attached to it immediately. There were some twists, some turns, and everything in between, but the movie ran smoothly and I wasn't confused at any single point.3. Going into the movie, I expected a very serious film with maybe slight bits of humor. I was pleasantly surprised. This movie had some legitimate laugh-out-loud moments, mostly coming from Jack's wackiness or Whalberg's temper and flare. Also, the humor wasn't at random, it helped develop the plot line and reveal things about the characters.All in all, The Departed, while not the greatest movie ever, is definitely the best movie of the year so far and I feel that it will get many Oscars, and I hope Scorsese finally gets one for this masterpiece that should not be missed.",8,2,6,7 October 2006
War of the Worlds," Eh....
","This movie is clearly not one of Spielberg's best. Although I love most of his other movies, this one did not do it for. This was most likely due to it's lack of depth and seemingly wasted time. In many Spielberg films, you can tell that not a single frame was wasted. For War of The Worlds, this is not the case. The first hour or so I thought was very good and for the circumstances seemed pretty realistic, but after *SPOILERS* Robbie left the movie and Tim Robbins came in, it seemed to me like time began to waste away. I could not wait for it to end, or at least certain scenes. Also, the end seems extremely rushed and just down-right stupid. There is really no other way to put it. Although there are some very good special effects, Spielberg should have learned over his years of great film-making that his movies do not need effects to be considered great. But, I believe that Spielberg will learn from his mistakes.Tom Cruise is not that bad in this movie but it seemed like Dakota Fanning's entire job was to yell and scream with a face full of fright.",5,0,1,7 June 2006
Heat," One of the Best movies I have ever seen
","That is really the only way I can put it. Robert De Niro gives one of his best performances if not his best, and Al Pacino isn't half bad either. He's actually very good. The plot is intricate and not a bunch of random scenes put together, which I see a lot of in action films, and the idea doesn't seem too far-fetched. This movie basically has everything that a good movie needs: Great Action, including the best shootout ever to hit the screen, great emotion, and it is very moving. You get to know both sides of the law so well that you know you are going to be upset at the end. I was upset, but I thought it was great. I knew that either De Niro or Pacino was gonna lose, but I didn't know which one it would be. The emotions in this film are very realistic and the relationships the characters have with each other do not seemed forced and add to the plot in the most amazing ways. I do not wish to say a lot, because I don't want to spoil any of it for those who haven't seen it, but I will end it by saying that the acting is great, the action is great, the character development is great, and overall is this a superb film that should not be missed.",9,0,1,11 June 2006
Jackie Brown," Very good
","I do not understand why this movie is not noticed among the movie world. If I were to ask somebody who directed Jackie Brown, I do not think they would be able to tell me. This movie, although not nearly as action packed as Pulp Fiction, has great dialogue and at times can be very humorous. The soundtrack is arguably Tarantino's best (And he knows his music) and the characters are well rounded and unique. Although some people feel like the ending is bad and in some ways ruins the movie, I felt as if it were the perfect fit for a movie like this. Also, each character seems to get their own scene to show off both the actor's talents and the way the character acts compared to those around them. ElmoreLeonard's writing mixed with Tarantino's attitude make this movie a sure 10/10 and it is enjoyable, if not more enjoyable, every time I see it. Tarantino knew his material, and turned it into one of the best movies I've ever seen. It might take a second viewing to truly appreciate it. If you don't focus so much on the plot, which is phenomenal, the second time around and focus on the amazing dialogue, you will see what makes this movie a true gem.",9,6,7,7 June 2006
Sin City," Yeesh!
","Sin City, directed by Robert Rodriguez, is one the most stylish and best movies I have ever seen. Not a second is wasted on screen, and the black and white gives a very dark atmosphere to it all. Great performances from the three main leads, especially Mickey Rourke. There was lots of hype about it, and he deserved it. This film was very violent, but it just added to the fun of it. There is humor, gore, nudity, and everything else in between. The characters are radical and the cast is amazing and well-acted too. There are so many moments in this movie where you think to yourself 'Wow, this is on of the coolest things I've ever seen' if not the coolest. The dialogue is good and pretty believable, and each story feels authentic. To wrap it all up the only thing I can really say is this was one helluva film.",9,1,2,8 June 2006
V for Vendetta," Simply put, an Amazing film
","V for Vendetta is one of the best films I have seen come out in recent years. The writing, as is with other Wachowski films, just short of a miracle and the acting is marvelous as well. Although I had never heard of the comic book before I heard of the movie, I had very high expectations for this from viewing the trailer. Well, my expectations were reached, and exceeded. Although you never see his face, Hugo Weaving's performance is nothing short of brilliant and Natalie Portman is pretty good as well. For such an amateur director, James McTeigue did a wonderful job. each scene is crafted perfectly and the movie flows. Also, there are some good performances from the supporting cast, especially Stephen Rea, who gives a dry but charismatic performance as the cop investigating V. There is also a great message to the film and although advertised as an action film, it is purely drama, and drama at it's best. With some comedy, action, drama, mystery, and even romance, This movie truly has it all and is a must see for all movie lovers alike.I would also like to mention that the music in this film makes it even better than it already is, and it adds an atmosphere you rarely see in movies.",9,2,4,7 June 2006
