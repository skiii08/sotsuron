The Blair Witch Project," Good movie, subtlely disturbing
","It took us all this week to finally get into this movie.  It only opened in one theater (so far), and a small one to boot.  So we finally got in.  The movie was worth the price of admission, I think.  By the halfway point, I was trying really hard not to throw up - some of it was due to the motion of the cameras, but most of it was due to the growing sense of dread and anxiety that this movie put into me.  There was not a single scene that made me jump, but the whole movie kept me so on edge that I stayed nauseous.  It gets under your skin - every moment you know that Heather, Josh, and Mike are not going to get out, and worse, you know that they know it too.  I've seen tons of horror movies, and most of them will give you a good fright every once in a while, enough to make your heart pound for about twenty seconds or so.  This movie kept my heart beating hard for a full 45 minutes, at least.  It makes you cold inside, makes you hurt for them, and makes you *never* want to be in the woods ever again.  The fact that our lead actress and I have the same name didn't help much either. :P  I do recommend it. Maybe not an Oscar winner, but probably the single most original horror/thriller I've ever seen.",4,1,2,5 August 1999
The Sixth Sense," As close to perfect as a film could get
","I'll keep this short - go see it.  The acting was as good as you could want, especially from Haley Joel Osment - Oscar-caliber, all the way.  The writing was wonderful.  The movie has every element a great movie should have.  And I was absolutely shocked to find that I was near tears at the end.  This is worth the price of admission, beyond a shadow of a doubt.  Go see it, go see it, GO SEE IT!! :)",9,0,0,22 August 1999
