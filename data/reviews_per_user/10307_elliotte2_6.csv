Hereditary," Feelers will love this movie, Thinkers will not.
","Unfortuantely, I'm a thinker.Pros:
1. The acting is top-notch, especially for a thriller(not really horror for most of the movie). Toni Collette was untouchable and the girl actress impressed me as well. Everyone else held their own.
2. Camera work was excellent, instead of many edited scenes, the camera flows and stops and allows the scenery to be taken in.
3. Story keeps you guessing, what is real, what is not. So you are intrigued to see what happens next to validate your thinking.Cons:
1. The movie is very similar to VVitch or any Stanley Kubrick film(2001, Eyes Wide Shut), it builds slowly preparing you for a big climax and then you are completely confused as to what happened. I had to go to Wikipedia afterwards to figure what happened at the end. Not good.
2. It moves slow(just like VVitch).
3. Bad parent award. Do not want to say anything that may be a spoiler, but if your child has an affliction, condition, etc...you do things to protect against that. It would make more sense if parents were overprotective, not dismissive just to create a situation of drama in a movie.
4.Amityville Horror Award: When things happen, you should leave...period. When walking through a dark house, you turn on lights.I gave five stars because of the acting and the suspense build-up. Take away the acting and this is a 3 star movie for Thinkers. Feelers will get caught up in the camerawork and suspense and forgive everything else.",5,1,5,30 November 2018
Knives Out," Emotional people will love....everybody else...meh
","It wasn't mysterious enough to be a mystery, wasn't funny enough to be a comedy(everything funny was in the trailer), wasn't dramatic enough to be drama.There is not enough of anything to explain the hype over the film outside of the casting of Daniel Craig, Jamie Lee Curtis, Chris Evans, Michael Shannon and Don Johnson. The acting was on par but everything else was pale in comparison. By the end I did not care who, what, when or why...just wanted it to be over.",4,4,8,19 February 2020
Avengers: Infinity War," Enjoyment of movie depends of if you are a fanboy(girl) or not.
","The rating of 10 are obviously people under the age of 18 or extreme fans of Marvel. This is not even the best Marvel movie this year(Black Panther had better story & drama), definitely nowhere near 'best superhero movie ever'. The action and special effects are very well done, the pacing, powers and 'decisions' are on par with a B-horror movie. When having the ability to end a scene quickly or leave a scene quickly, our 'heroes' would stand there and trade one-liners. I seriously considered walking out at the lack of competence. For the record, I loved Avengers, loved Winter Soldier so it is not like I cannot enjoy a superhero flick. This one is not(unless you are a fanboy(girl).",5,27,55,11 May 2018
Midsommar," What The.....?
","Wow........first of all, this is not horror, not even in the least definition. The first 3rd of the movie has little bearing with the second or third parts.I enjoy character development and a good slow burn.....this was neither. To put this in context, it was a 2019 version of Wicker Man and Hereditary and not nearly a quarter as good as either. You are not sure what is going on, and there are zero motivations with any of the main characters and the ending is like....huh? The only people who will like this are those that get caught up in cinematography or have similar emotional issues as the protagonists(yes I went there). Acting seems to be well enough, but the writing is disjointed.Example, four of my friends that were with me are missing and there is just one sentence referencing their disappearance, yet we watched a 14-minute flagpole dance that could have been shortened to 2 minutes and had the same effect. Just skip....",3,3,6,8 November 2019
The Witch," Beware...This is not a horror movie!!
","This is not a horror movie. It is a psychological drama of a family slowly questioning their belief in God and descending into madness. The 'witch' is a minor, minor backstory that increases the descent. There are only three scenes total that has a 'witch' in it.Acting is up to par, but you spend the movie waiting for the 'witch' thing to happen, thinking there will be a big finale. It does not happen. Had this movie advertised itself as a drama of a family trying to make it alone in the wilderness....I probably would have given it a higher rating(not much, but higher). Instead it is pointless dialogue and the reciting of scriptures and prayers(not exaggerating, that is almost 40% of the movie, with another 30% silently looking into or away from camera).The people who are giving this movie high ratings are the same ones that said Terence Malick's Tree of Life is a masterpiece. People who are concerned with plot, middle story, finale or explanation of what is going on will want to to get back two hours of their life.",4,86,172,4 October 2016
Annihilation," Tries hard at everything, but succeeds at nothing.
","This movie was a combination of every alien/scifi movie made in last ten years..It tries for sci-fi, but does not reach it.
Tries for emotional engagement, but you don't know enough about the characters to care and Natalie Portman's acting was just a half notch above Kristen Stewart.
Tries for action/adventure, fails at that.
Wanted to be a mystery, but by that time you did not care for the answer.Pros
Slightly original story, or at least a copied story told differently.Cons
No logic, most decisions are not indicative of 'intelligent' scientists. 
Not sure what happened at the end.
Boring and slow, even the 'action' scenes seemed drawn-out and did not create excitement or tension.
Large portion of movie is consumed with long dramatic stares or calling out each other's names.So yes, I wanted to like this movie, trailers made it seem interesting. I did feel like I lost two hours for nothing.",3,9,18,21 April 2018
