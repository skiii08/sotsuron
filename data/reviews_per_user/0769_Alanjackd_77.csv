Blade Runner 2049," True Sci Fi
","Any Star Bores fans should not read this. Because this is true Science Fiction with a complete story and morality..not spoon fed narrative and silly plots...Excellently directed and written , sitting at home on the big screen where it belongs. The art direction here is second to none and the sets are out of this world.Asks as many questions as it answers and packs a punch from start to finish.I gave it an 8 because my tens go to movies like Paper Moon and Glengarry Glen Ross,, character driven with no special effects...but this deserves an 8. 2 small points..it was a 15 and had no need to be,,and from what I can recall there was NO smiley bits at all...NONE! At 163 minutes it eats up the time and needs to be caught on the big screen for the incredible audio. Movie making at it's best!!",8,1,9,14 October 2017
The Equalizer," As expected
","You get what you expect from this,its a revenge flick .Doesn't ask for anything else just a few hours attention.Typical good guy versus bad guy stuff with nasty Russians thrown in,then thrown out. Man On Fire it certainly is not,but it does not pretend to be either.Taking its name from the TV series seems rather odd but there you go.Den Washington does a great job as a brooding nobody who used to be a somebody.Good fight scenes that get a tiny bit silly toward the end but it's all done with the best intentions. Probably the start of a franchise. Good movie making and a step up from the usual revenge flick.Just checked my watch.....",5,1,2,1 June 2015
Child 44," Well worth a visit
","Reading all the reviews on this I notice people either love it or hate it.Words like propaganda and stereotypes are thrown around quite a lot but this is just a movie!Well worth a visit to the cinema as its part thriller , part murder mystery with a history lesson thrown in. Good character dimension and good performances all around. Can't understand why they threw Charles Dance in for the last 10 minutes though, and Paddy Consadine could maybe have had more film time but that's probably just me nit-picking.Good gritty directing too ,forgot about the accents after 5 minutes.This movie should have had more backing and advertising though,haven't seen ANY t.v spots or anything.Gave it a 6 , thought about 7 but stuck to 6.",6,9,22,27 April 2015
Deepwater Horizon," Oscars??
","Somebody in the reviews mentioned Oscars?? What utter nonsense !This is at best a watered down disaster movie..not bad at all but Oscar material?? never in a million years...for the following reasons.1) Nobody deserves an Oscar. Sorry but that is as far as I got..OK direction...few good performances...Kurt Russell was immense..Whalberg is a piece of wood..does his best but he hasn't got enough experience to carry a movie emotionally..cinematography OK..sound very dodgy,,,couldn't understand much of what was being said...felt like I didn't really care much about any of the characters.Worth a visit to the cinema but don't expect too much..all got a bit silly towards the end..don't really know why the post fire scenes at the hospital and hotel were added...,didn't make a lot of sense.Lacked emotion and drive.",5,6,15,6 October 2016

","For only the 3rd time in my life I nearly walked out halfway through a movie.This is the basic way of how not to make movies. here's why..Plot...awful and insipidActors...unlikable and annoyingDirection...lazy and uninspiringCharacters..all horribleScript...childishEnding....ridiculousBeginning...ridiculousMiddle third...ridiculous.I could go on...many people were laughing at some of the daft things going on and I didn't hear 1 single jump by any audience at any time. The guy who plays the clown was so over the top it was laughable. The first 10 minutes were probably the worst I have ever seen...and that set the scene for the rest of this drivel. I would imagine that the only people scared of this were 15 year old girls who know no better.What a horrible way to spend over 2 hours in the cinema...dreadful , dreadful film.",1,20,40,14 September 2017
Hereditary," Some people don't understand it.
","Looking at the reviews , this is a love it or hate it affair.Personally I loved it.The performances were all excellent and the direction was very well thought out. I must say that some of the images here were among the most twisted I have ever seen since 'The Witch'(2015)..which appears to have come from the same stable.Problem is these days everybody expects a twist that will make everything clear...but some of us prefer to work it out rather than have narrative spoon fed to us. Excellent use of light and shade and at just over 2 hours was an ideal run time.Also I have noticed some reviewers saying if you like this you're wrong and don't know what they are talking about...i would say the opposite is more the case...some people just cannot understand that a good script keeps you thinking and make up a few things yourself as you see it. These people should just probably stick to Star Wars or movies of that ilk.Very good ...the average score says it all really. Not really a horror...more of a macabre thriller..take you're 15 year old kids to see it and watch their faces.",8,5,12,16 June 2018
Detroit," Slightly above average
","Firstly I will share my comments about the movie and then explain why.Firstly, this is a good guy bad guy movie at centre and is all about things getting out of control in a tricky situation till it all breaks down..nothing more..nothing less.Takes a good 30 minutes to make you listen properly and then paces nicely to keep the story afloat. Never been a fan of this kind of camera work,,it makes me feel like i'm watching a documentary ..and that means television...for me belittles it.Direction is taught and well paced ..gets as much from the crew as possible. Decent performances really...nothing outstanding and will not even be mentioned come Oscar time.That was a basic review...now heres why...i deliberatley kept away from the race issue...as it was secondary to the story I think..it would have been a lot better without this overdone narrative . it's best to concentrate on the plot and not why it came to be.Last of all ..spoilers...Why did nobody just say ' It was a toy gun'?? then they could have all gone home!!Another thing is no ballistics and why no emphasis on the lad who was shot through the chest...surely it would have been investigated more.??The score on IMDb is slightly flattering for me ..I only just gave it a 6...on a 2nd viewing I would probably give a 5!",6,3,8,7 September 2017
John Wick," Mayhem
","What Keanu does best in this movie is kill people. The death rate must be huge. People getting shot left, right and centre.It' s mass murder with a musical background.Well worth a visit to the cinema but don't take your girlfriend or wife as its a very much ' Men Only' movie.Very cool shots and camera work here folks but as with all this sort of movie the big question I have to ask myself is 'Why don't the bad guys employ bodyguards who can shoot straight'? very similar to the recent 'Gunman' with Sean Penn and probably runs along side with it. I don't have to explain the plot as it's obvious if you've seen the trailer.Must remember to move to the area as there is not a cop in sight. It does what it says on the label but won't go down as a classic or one of his finest movies but there you go..can't argue with the box office that this will probably bring in.I gave it a 5 because of the direction of the action sequences,,,otherwise would have got a 4.",5,1,7,10 April 2015
Rocketman," As good as can be.
","Ok..let's get the Bo Rhap comparison over...this was much better...the latter was very awful , this was as good as you could get it. All done.Without delving into the REAL murky world of Elton this is probably one of the better attempts of a life story. Made good because of the way the music was used as part of the story and actually helped it along.Directed well with some brilliant camerawork it let's us know exactly what we want to know .Egerton mastered the little mannerisms that Malek overdid in the extreme and made Mercury look like a spitting image puppet of Mick Jagger.More of a musical than a biopic...well thought out...well presented...well done",7,4,11,29 May 2019
The Death of Stalin," Remarkable
","Being a holder of an unlimited cinema card I usually see everything on the screen and because my 14 year old daughter also has one, I tend to let her choose and watch the so - called ' bigger' movies..DC , Marvel, Pixel...etc...but I sneaked into this on my own one night because it was raining and it just blew me away!!As well as a brilliant history lesson it had me open mouthed at the way it gave comedy and nausea at the same time. The things that were happening in the background while comedy was ongoing was nothing short of remarkable..how can something be funny AND horrendous at the same time?Brilliant in the most basic form of film making...with outstanding performances all around..also it shows up in a tiny way what it must have been like to have to review every word before it left your lips.For me Jason Isaccs steals it as a Yorkshire Russian with a thirst for action..Fantastic.Alas this will be nowhere to be seen at the awards but get this on the big screen where it belongs..give the 'biggies' a rest this week and grab a proper piece of film making!",9,5,16,9 November 2017
Rogue One: A Star Wars Story," Star Bores
","Another one on the star wars C.V.As if us cinema audience have not had enough of this rubbish since the 70,s they ring out a few more million of our hard earned.This is now getting ridiculous...sitting in the theatre , i noticed just a handful of children surrounded by fat 40 odd year old brain dead popcorn munchers going on about how 'awesome ' star bores ' is.Acting...really poor.. Characters..weren't even 1 dimensional.. Script..NNaahhhh Direction..hollow.. Story..same old star bores rubbish..I did notice at the end a 5 second Princess Leia cameo..note to fat star bores 40 odd year olds..start saving your benefit money for the next one..I put this in the same box as last years woeful ' Jupiter Ascending' This will be rush released o DVD to cash in on the fat 40 odd year olds who don't like movies like ' Spotlight' or 'The Revanent'!

The Babadook," Classy and disturbing
","You wont find any screaming teenagers , chainsaws , killer clowns , aliens or devilish head turning in this movie.This is low budget movie making at it's disturbingly best.Excellent use of light and sound,,or rather the lack of it!Reminds me of Nosferatu,,the 1st proper horror to hit the screens.Let me tell you,the extras on the blu ray are better than most modern horror movies. ...if indeed this IS a horror movie.Psychological and nerve shredding, do not let the daft title put you off.Far better than anything with all those ridiculous' reach out for the door handle slowly and wait for the hand on the shoulder moments' that seem to pass as horror these days. This absolutely kicks movies like the recent Poltergeist remake into a very big and black hat.Watch in the dark with surround sound if you can..and wait for the knock at the door. Modern classic which will be copied for years to come.",8,1,5,31 May 2015
The Danish Girl," To the point
","Was not sure how I was going to react to this movie as the subject matter was not something that has ever occurred in my thoughts so I went in hoping to gain some education and enjoy a movie,,and here's what happened..At first I should say the cinematography and direction was flawless and made this more of a journey than a story. I was never too sure about Redmaynes acting...he was good in Theory but awful in jupiter,,,so am still on the fence with that one....saying that it was a remarkable performance but somehow left me cold and somewhat uninterested in his story...which I think may have been deliberate...as it was not so much about a sex change but more about how they at the time judged the actions of a man who dare even consider something that may have put him in a straight jacket in a padded cell for the rest of his life.For me the credits all go to Alicia Vikander as his wife turned mentor ...she was absolutely exceptional and made every scene her own..she was more the lead to Redmaynes supporting role.Never was going to be a classic but gives us an insight into how we thought at the time and represents true love between people who will sacrifice all to help others. May come across to some people as cold and too rigid but that was meant to take the romance out of a very serious story. I may also add that the scene where she first finds him with feminine clothing on was probably the most erotic I have ever seen an actress portray .",5,17,33,1 January 2016
The Irishman," A let down
","I think 99% of the population wanted this to be a great movie so fooled themselves into thinking it was.
For me it was just cold and dull. i suspect if the names had not been in it then it would have not even been mentioned.
Nothing here we haven't seen a million times before but better.
The inclusion of the JFK stuff was ridiculous.
Never being a fan of the director i never expected to much.
It should never have been tried to make these actors shine ...they are well too long in the tooth to be gangsters.
The great Steve Graham was as bad a case of miscasting as you will ever see.
I didn't want to review like this but it's honest.
I gave it 5 but would have been a 6 or 7 at the theatre as its where movies should be watched....not on a tv or a tablet or a phone.
Great chance missed.",6,4,8,1 December 2019
Point Break," Point LESS Break
","Firstly, I am reviewing this not as a remake , that would not be fair as the first one was no good so have to look at it as a stand alone title.For me the only thing good from this is the scenery ..breathtaking and wonderful.Movie itself pretty mundane and pointless..action sequences nowhere near as good as they should and could have been.. a proper director would have made more of an effort to put us into the action...good chance missed.Acting ..same really ..wooden and none dimensional...I could not really care less who died or didn't.Plot....shockingly bad ...confusing and pointless...again I was never interested in who done what and why..Not a massive fan of Ray Winstone but he was very poor in this...almost falling asleep saying his lines..Pretentious and tried to be cool...fell flat at the start and never got going....watched The Revanant and Spotlight this week and the gap is a million miles.",3,5,10,15 February 2016
Spotlight," Hold The Front Page
","I must say before the film review I would like to review the cast. Absolutely magnificent...all of them..each playing their own part of this melodramatic jigsaw puzzle. If I had to point one out( VERY difficult) I would opt for Rachel McAdams,,remarkable talent in the 1st role she can really get her teeth into...probably equaled by Stanley Tucci...believable and extraordinary...Now, the movie itself is astonishing in it's slow first 15 minutes then we all sat up and were gripped for the next 2 hours. Taking a lot of emotion out of the direction it made us able to walk along with the plot as the evidence was fed to us. Never wallowing in self pity or sentimentality this is a masterpiece of film -making. Sit up and take note Marvel..this is the way movies are made. No guns..no explosions...no car chases...just a story within a story as it affects each of the reporters on different levels..brilliantly put together. I had made up my mind last week that The Revenant was a tip for best movie at the Oscars but not too sure now...better direction overall in the latter...but the true story feel of Spotlight lifts it to a similar level..get on and see for yourself.",8,0,0,8 February 2016
Aquaman," So many bad actors in one movie
","This ticks all the DC boxes . Plot, Goodies, Baddies,Comedy, Sentimentality,Action...etc etc. O.K direction and some impressive action..but all was let down for me by the acting. Thing is...i know it's a superhero movie and it's not too important....but it was REALLY bad at times. too much direction in the action and green screen and not enough in the actual acting department. Even Nicole Kidman..one of the greats..was just warbling on. Shame tho but that's my review.",4,13,29,15 December 2018
Ready Player One," WOW
","Reading many reviews some say it's not as good as the book... the book is a completely different form of a story and the two should never be put up against each other.
it's actually a masterpiece of film making for 3 reasons.
1. It's filmed perfectly and uses every single use of a camera and CGI you could imagine. Saw this at the O2 Superscreen in London and it is a visually perfect experience.2. Direction..Spielberg suspends belief and throws common sense out of the window and wants us all to go along with the flow. Look at his past movies...Sharks...Poltergeists..Dinosaurs..Russian Spies..Aliens...Nazis...he likes to tell stories..and there is nobody better at it.
3. It reaches all ages..,.something for everybody..Stop reading silly comments and get your popcorn and drink and just enjoy a stunning two odd hours of pure joy in a modern day classic.Also ..for all the people who prefer the book..I would say this...if you don't like what he's done....get a couple of million dollars and do better...or stop whingeing!!!",8,0,3,1 April 2018
"I, Tonya"," Great Skates
","Went in blind to this one..seen the trailer but didn't look the content up as I knew it was a kind of Mockumentary so didn't want to know the facts.What I watched was one of the top movies of the year , Three Billboards being my top.All roles were acted out perfectly..a lot of reviews say the mother runs away with it but for me Margot Robbie gets everything right and is spot on. I could even forgive her for Suicide Squad after this.Funny and sad at the same time took us on a sad and brilliant journey through the life of a nobody who became an everybody then back to a nobody again.Don't know how true it was to the facts and that's why I never studied it before..which made it better.Went to see the abysmal Black Panther last week and gave it a 2 out of ten..this deserved an 8 and is well worth a trip the the cinema.",8,0,2,27 February 2018

Pan's Labyrinth," What an experience
",What a marvellous experience watching this.Top notch direction and splendid performances from all involved.Just goes to show how you can have a fantasy/horror/war/thriller/growing up movie with a love story thrown in.I wish I could have seen it on the big screen and I think 3D would have made this a real feast. missed it at the theatre so watching on Blu ray with surround sound and it hasn't let me down.This is how to make movies. Bit of everything thrown in and wonderfully dark which switches from the innocence of a young girl straight to the horrors of war and then off to a fantasy world of talking wood and secret worlds.

",I was really looking forward to this..not so much for Depp but Egerton as I seen him in ' The Gift' and he was brilliant.What I got was a very lacklustre and badly told story.In my opinion all the cast were well below par and unconvincing.It tried to be a 'L.A.Confidential ' mixed with 'Goodfellas' but for me fell flat.The way the story was told was far too narrative based and Johnny Depp was trying his best to look and sound like Ray Liotta .Not a good attempt all round and I cannot see it doing well at all.I found that I didn't really care at all for the characters and everybody over acted in the extreme.,3,3,6,26 November 2015

","A few months ago I went to see Antman..and I got the impression that Marvel were throwing too many movies at us...and were starting to take us for granted..stick a Marvel movie on and it will make big bucks..we are yet to see if that's true......after seeing this mess of a movie I'm starting to think this of D.C ...maybe too much too soon. Man Of Steel and S V B were stylish and darkly funny...but this is way..way..way off the mark. Badly scripted and acted with unlikable characters who nobody cares about.Badly directed...gets nothing out of the crew.Take Will Smith..he is just always will smith..no dimension...he harps on about black people not getting Oscars..then in a 12 month period in which we had Revanent..Danish Girl....Spotlight...he has the audacity to be in a load of mess like this..if you want an Oscar ..act better in good movies.Everybody else was also just there ,,never anything special...I think this will prove to be a loose wheel .I wont say don't see it because you probably will,,but chances are you won't enjoy it.....and..the new Joker is woefully pathetic...not a near patch on Ledger..Nothing here to be excited about ...at all.",4,1,3,6 August 2016

Mathew Mc thingy could not act to save his life and Michael Caine seems totally out of place. Very too long and not enough to hold attention. All that about the moon landings?? what was that all about??Wasn't sure if it was supposed to be a story of family life or about some bloke going off in a space ship for a bit and doing not much.There was so much going on I lost interest. If there was such a thing as time travel then the 1st thing I would do is get the money back for my ticket and stay at home...or maybe I could go further back in time and teach Matthew Mcthingy how to act.Not good....not good at all.,2,6,10,7 August 2015

Southpaw," Uninspiring
","This is not a boxing movie. It's based in the world of boxing but it's nothing to do with the real story.Redemption I suppose but also standing up to all the challenges life throws at you.For me the director tried too hard to muster up a broody feel which overstretched me and made me feel as though I was just waiting for something good to happen. I was surprised at the acting in this,,seemed a bit wooden at times by everybody involved and very few outside sequences made it feel a bit enclosed. Nowhere near as good as I was led to believe by all the rave reviews. A lot of the plot evaporated as it went along and there seemed to be no narrative to hold attention and move the story on. Cannot recall a stand out moment you would expect from a film if this ilk either.Another thing that no good was the soundtrack..very annoying at times and over used. Overall unimpressed and uninspiring with not even a great performance from the crew.",4,5,10,28 July 2015
Ant-Man," rANT
","Now I'm not too sure if the Marvel bandwagon is suffering from dodgy wheels here but after watching this with my 12 year old daughter I think maybe a few of the Marvel fans may be thinking that this could be the start of a weak link in the chain. Great movie yes,,very family orientated and the special effects while at times both excellent but occasionally a bit tepid do not override the storytelling. Some good laugh out loud moments and hugely enjoyable with a well written script it keeps the audience happy. The only problem is maybe Marvel are pushing out too much stuff and it could start to get a bit overdone. Lots of references to other Marvel heroes started to make me feel as though we were being taken just a little for granted and left just a tiny hint of a slightly bad taste. The ending definitely says sequel and you just know he is going to join the Avengers which made this film feel as though it was just an advert for the whole Marvel bandwagon. It should have been a stand alone film with it's own back drop and ideas. Having said that the audience all loved it(including myself) but I get the nagging feeling this might just be a bit too much too soon. The money taken at the box office for the Marvel movies could and should be used for proper independent movie making and up and coming directors. Little bit of a rant there but I'm sure you can see what I mean when you've seen it.",5,16,44,20 July 2015

Al Pacino and Bob De Niro cannot save this waste of time.Bad characters and bad direction heap on the misery of having to sit through this .Watched gf1 and now this...will not bother watching gf3 if its as bad as this.

HOW ON EARTH could the producers ( Executive Producers May and Taylor i should note )get them performing songs on a tour that were written 7 years later??? It makes me think Messrs May and Taylor just added their names for the accolades.It also hinted at Bohemian Rhapsody was a coming out song ...IT WAS NOT!!Some people have mentioned Oscars...which is of course ridiculous...for me an opportunity missed.Listen to the Greatest Hits album instead.

Justice League," What now Zack?
","in my opinion, Man of Steel was the best of the trio..a good origin movie with proper character build. BvS was good..but 2 superheroes (then 3) tended to take away the super ..this was , for me, a chance missed. Zack Snyder is by no means a good director..he is just bringing the story to the screen in a way he sees it...and that's fine. But,,when you try to outdo yourself the sillier you get. The movie isn't silly..it's a great movie for the big screen..it's just when the story tries to outdo the characters it never really works.Take Wonderwoman for instance..brilliantly put together as a one off story..perfectly directed with just enough of everything and never had to outdo anything..you could quite easily take this from the DC world and it would still work for both.The extra heroes never had time to gel and we didn't know much about them. Perhaps they should have had their origin movies before this??Let down by a terrible bad guy and some very dodgy efx..but I still liked it.Now comes the spoiler ...so beware..the way they brought supes alive was a bit daft..if that was all it took then why didn't they just plug him into the national grid??

Good Lord I am socked.If you're not clever or smart to suspend belief and realize that it's popcorn fiction then you should probably stay watching Adam Sandler movies or T,V !Henry Cavill takes hamming it up very seriously and Zack Snyder directs a true as can be modern day classic.Some characters from the other , sillier Superman movies have not been introduced yet but obviously will be or not depending on how the story develops.

","A revenant is a person who comes back...and that is exactly what the director is..a person who has come back and equaled...almost..the brilliance of Birdman..This is the movie that Tarantino would love to be able to make.For starter you will never ever see a more well directed movie..the camera work is again stunning..taking in the far away beauty of nature right up to the close up of mans grief.The bear scene was like no other I have seen..and the violence..very short..but very violent ..was added as a matter of fact..not slowly added to increase tension..it was there then gone..as violence is..from nowhere then gone.De Caprio will of course win an Oscar and so will direction..maybe camera work and costume also..if not..there is a problem.Masterfully crafted into an experience more than a movie and with exactly the right amount of dialogue..this treasure will,like Birdman,push other directors to better themselves and that is good for the movies.Only down for me was Tom Hardy..who , while OK..has not got enough experience to carry a role yet ..he is always himself and needs a few more years to hone his roles.Gave it a 9 ..gave Birdman a 10 as i feel the lack of script between actors here was not as good as the latter.Amazing experience at the theatre....",9,1,4,19 January 2016
Bridge of Spies," Safe-Mode
",I recall a time when SS would push the boundaries of film making. That was then.Whilst being a very good and well scripted affair it's not what you might call a thriller...no particular tension to speak of as even without a history lesson you know the outcome .All cast do a brilliant job and direction and production is top notch...I don't think I have ever seen a movie with more of a cold war feel about it...especially set direction..one would think it was filmed via a time capsule.Lot of talk of American propaganda but that's a lot of rubbish..everybody was scared at the time and were cautious.Just a word about tom Hanks...he seems to have found a director who knows how to get the best out of him...never rated him much till SS got him to act his soul out in ' Saving Private Ryan'.Mark Rylance runs the whole show with his beyond excellent portrayal of a paper soldier in a non contact war of mis-guided hatred and was a pleasure to watch.Not since Micheal Keaton in 'Birdman' have I enjoyed such a performance.The only down is the direction was very safe and never gave the audience any real feel of threat or tension.All in all not a SS classic but well above average.,6,2,5,30 November 2015

","Over the past 12 years or so with the ' newest' Spiderman goings on i have never really felt that anybody has got it right. Something was nagging at me in the back of my mind. All the other Marvel guys seemed to sit happily and just get on with it but not Spiderman.Then it came to me in the theatre today exactly what it was....it's at home being animated. I can't say why but it just does.It really suits being animated and needs to stay there. For me it starts where the 70's series ended and looks fantastic on the screen.The animation is at times jaw dropping and the action sequences are much better than real life green screen could ever be.With a perfect balance of humour and sentimentality thrown in , this suits both young and old. Try catch in 3D ...it brings the colours to life.
I would like to see more of the Marvel done like this as , for me, it brings it to life. Awesome soundtrack too. I gave it a 7 because Marvel is not my thing but this is as good as it gets. Well done Sony.",7,6,18,15 December 2018
Mission: Impossible - Rogue Nation," Your Mission is...to read this review
","What more can you say about a MI movie? You get what you pay for and walk out of the cinema feeling you got what you wanted .No real change to the format other than there may be an addition to the team in MI 6. Completely riddled with plot holes and ' Why did't he just'??....moments it's a feast of action and top secret shennanigans they pull out all of the stops to keep you enthralled. Also to remember is Tom Cruise actually does all his own stunts and produced this. One thing I would say is the stunts ( while exceptional) were not filmed as good as the previous movies..as an example number 3 with director John Woo ..but the cinematography was very good,taking time to show us where we were by using landmarks. On the whole a very enjoyable visit to the cinema and well worth a visit.",5,3,7,4 August 2015
Dunkirk," Typically Nolan
",Nolan has an eye for action...but when it comes to dialogue and story he lacks .A well taught history lesson would have had more heart and emotion.As with other 'nolanesque' features we keep waiting for the reveal at the end of a massive build up...but alas nothing delivers. Mark Rylance ..who became an overnight sensation in Bridge of spies...cold not help...and seemed to just plod along.After watching this I would suggest watching Saving Private Ryan to see the difference.Not really well made to be honest and I think the subject matter deserved much better.I would imagine people who visit the cinema every now and again would probably get wound up in the hype...but for serious cinema - goers like me..we know the difference.,4,7,12,2 August 2017
The Exorcist," What a difference 40 years make
",When I was 11 I sneaked into my local theatre and watched this through my hands...at one point pretending to tie my shoelaces so I didn't have to watch what was happening on the screen. I listened to the critics and the media about passing out and the clergy outside the theatres with placards and I think as a child I had to believe the hype.Now...after growing up and watching again I can't understand what all the fuss was about.On recent viewing I thought actually that it was all a bit ...well....silly and overdone.I think what could have been an amazing story of the usual teenage angst tale could be interleaved with the mother reaching out to religion was just a bit too childishly over gorified..( yes..I meant gorified)!Green vomit over a vicar???? come on....The scene on the bed with the crucifix was quite laughable really too. Don't get me wrong..the structure of the movie was very very good..I like the directors commentary about the use of stairs up and down to show heaven and hell pretty awesome...and I think if anyone noticed this without listening to the commentary they are telling porkie pies. Just goes to show that as an 11 year old I believed the hype and was terrified...but as a grown up i have seen scarier things in my handkerchief.Still a good movie tho!!,5,1,4,16 August 2015
X-Men: Days of Future Past," wow
",I hate to admit this ...not being a fan of super hero movies ...but this is an absolute belter.Everything you could possibly wish for...brilliantly filmed in sumptuous 3D with a marvelous time travelling story and really good comic book performances makes this a modern day classic popcorn flick.This should really be the last instalment in the X-Men movies because no way can this be bettered.James Mcevoy hams it up perfectly and all the rest of the crew are quite happy to join in the fun.All in all a great way to spend a few hours in Nerdland.the only negative I would have to put forward is why do they always concentrate on Hugh Jackmans character as he is probably the most boring of them all.Popcorn at it's very very best,6,1,3,6 October 2015
Captain America: Civil War," Wheels come off
",After watching this I feel that at long last the wheels have finally come off the Marvel bandwagon.It's not a bad movie by any means..it's just overdone and there's nowhere to go.all the crew seem as fed up with this as the audience is.We have ANOTHER Spiderman origin story and I think Bob Downey Jrs character is getting sillier by the day.Action scenes are OK but try to be too big to make . The lead actor is OK as an extra but he cannot act to save his life.Time to hang up your boots guys...nowhere left to go!,3,19,41,6 May 2016
Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them," Here we go again
","As I said, here we go again..Don't need to explain much about the title..if you don't know now you never will.Standard Potter for die hard fans I suppose but as a regular movie goer i have a few reservations.One is the lead..In my opinion he brings nothing to the role..yes..hes OK and somewhat carries it off but he brings nothing to a 1 dimensional roll..Two is it never ever felt at all like a like a Potter movie..never had that slightly fresh and naive feel..felt too polished..and that brings me on to the next point..For the point above it seems to me it has been ' Americanised' ! For me Potter worked due to its English background..I don't think the American audience will really get Potter. Nothing wrong there though..it has a lot of money behind it and has been written and produced for the American audience ..it has a feeling of an episode in a long line..reminded me a bit like Suicide Squad in many ways. Too much money spent on this .A great British tradition hi-jacked again by the big money men..would have liked a bit more daftness . Saw it in 3D but that brought nothing..as with Redmayne. I am probably the minority but there you go,,and thats my opinion. Gave it a 5 ..no more no less!!",5,10,24,17 November 2016
The Conjuring 2," Horror?
","3 months ago my daughter bought herself a little fluffy puppy called ' Lottie',it's basically a little cute ball of cuteness with some cute thrown in..it is also scarier than this pile of clichéd drivel.I went expecting a horror and I got a silly story with wooden acting with a script they must have spent at least £5 on.Full to the brim with clichés...a Mad nun with big teeth???come on...An old man creeping around???A possession of a young child???I have never seen any of these ideas before.A couple of jump moments but that is not so difficult if you push the volume up every now and again.Not really anything to compare with so shall not bother..save your money and buy a fluffy puppy if you want some proper scares.The director did try to use clever camera work early on but I get the feeling he got bored and threw in the mad nun to speed things up.Not good...Not good at all..",3,6,12,19 June 2016
The Usual Suspects," not bad
",One of those movies that everybody talks about in glowing terms because somebody in the media told them it was.Not bad really.Fair direction and standard performances drop this in the DVD shelf about half way.I can see how some people may find this a little confusing as there is a lot going on. Quite a clever twist but not enough to make this any cleverer than it already is.The one outstanding performance is by Peter Postlethwaite who looks as if he is the only person who knows what's going on.Worth a watch on TV but I woudn't go and buy it. If you are seeing this movie with high expectations from the media who bigged this up and from all the people who told you it's brilliant because they listened to it then you might be disappointed.Saying all that I think it would be good to see the extras to get a good idea of how the director wanted this to turn out.Full of one liners and stereotype characters this is good to watch with a beer on the sofa.You might end up feeling a bit let down.,4,0,1,24 June 2015
Legend," Don't trust the trailer
",As I just said ..'Don't Trust the trailer'!Don't go to the cinema expecting a gangster movie because a gangster movie it is not.Can't really make up my mind what it is..black comedy for the first third...Love story the second and a Thriller in the last.Read some really different reviews and comments about tom Hardy's acting but cannot fail it.The script is top draw and the direction is flawless. It's a strange thing to say but the violence( Very short and VERY violent) are almost cartoon like and all the cast seem to very slightly overdo it and ham the cockney wideboy gangster stereotype just enough.Only downside is that almost every trailer I see these days twists the story and you don't know what you're getting.Well worth a visit . Good honest British Movie.,5,13,25,14 September 2015
Room," Coldroom
","Room is one of those movies that people read rave reviews about and then adopt it. Having just watched a UK preview screening I wanted to let you know what kind of a movie it really is.For starters it is really...well...cold. The director has tried a silent approach to take out the emotion and concentrate on the subject matter but has gone too far and left it a bland and dim affair. I was expecting a lot more from the confined direction but not once did I get feeling of claustrophobia. Every character was also very one dimensional and stereotypical.Too many issues all going at once but none of them were dealt with properly. It's not a bad movie but I think the bland direction and lack of narrative let it down...I would imagine the book would be far,far superior. Still worth a trip to the cinema because I love movies on the big screen...where they should be...and it will not show well on T,V or DVD.One of those movies that try to make you think but come across as somewhat pretentious and believes it's own hype..will not win a single nomination...let alone an award.",3,26,71,11 January 2016
A Quiet Place," Edge of your seat stuff
","Firstly , I notice reviewers either love this or hate this, which I can understand. Reasons being there are a lot of plot holes and situations but when a movie is made about monsters and suchlike then plot holes are essential otherwise there is no story..understand!! Imagine a film about King Kong and the plot hole is there is no such thing as a massive ape...film over...Back to the movie...just go in and enjoy it for what it is..a thriller very well put together and drains you of all your nerve endings for 90 minutes.Very well directed and filmed as good as it can be it takes a new and fresh look at the genre. Put me in mind of 10 Cloverfield Lane last year..it doesn't give you any more information than you need to know and takes you along for the ride.
I also must say that Emily Blunt is fantastic in this and carries the whole movie. 
The last 10 minutes are heart poundingly tense and it finishes with a jolt.Well worth the money and satisfies throughout.
Must add I have been reviewing movies on this site for 5 years and am not a robot!!!",8,2,5,12 April 2018
Dog Day Afternoon," Director Masterclass
","Stand out movie from any perspective this but the direction takes this to another level. Very cleverly lets us know early on that this robbery is doomed but then takes us on a story as to just how much these guys can stand under pressure.After 20 minutes we see the captor and captives drawn together in what seems to be sympathy and empathy and as the film grows it makes the cops the bad guys.Each and every player runs in top notch performances and Mr Pacino powerhouses his way through,holding everybodys attention and gives an immense performance.He can act with just his eyes and body language..as he shows after his arrest and in handcuffs....just watch the way he looks around in a daze...marvellous.Definitely in his top 5 along with Serpico and Danny Collins.Also it takes us right back to the 70's with it's feel.",7,0,1,18 August 2015
Big Hero 6," What did you expect?
","Reading some reviews of this movie I noticed that some of them went into tens of paragraphs and some reviewers stood on a soapbox spewing bile and insult over the movie itself and Disney. I think all the reviewers were probably adults. If you ask ANY child 12 or under to review this movie all of them would say how marvellous it is. Children take this sort of thing at face value,and take away the politics and personal gripe out of it. This is a gem of a movie if taken in context.Some people even took time to spot all the goofs and one even went into mathematical equation to prove a cgi character could not possibly pick up a large box. Incredible to think the lengths people will go to to vent their inner anger. Watched this with my 12 yr old daughter in 3D and we both enjoyed it tremendously.Just bought it on 3D Blu Ray and will enjoy it many times again.Fantastic entertainment.( It's only a movie grown-ups!)",6,3,5,18 June 2015
Jurassic World," On Par
","This is as close to the original as humanly possible. Just enough homage equalled with a plot of it's own makes this on a par with Jurassic Park. The effects were good but more importantly the way they were used made all the difference and brought things to life. Watched this in 3D and if anyone tells you it makes no difference then they are talking through their spectacles,,it opens up the whole movie and gives you an idea how it may feel to stand in front of those creatures. One thing that I noticed was the score..sounded like Williams but had a very modern spark to it which seemed to settle me into Jurassic mode. Fantastic ending and full of pointers to the original that it clearly so much admired this was a hugely enjoyable return of which Spielberg would be proud. In 22 years I shall do another review of the 3rd remake.",6,6,16,11 June 2015
Avengers: Age of Ultron," Overdone
","Whole thing overdone. Pretty bad action sequences,bad acting, plot thinner than a slice of ham. I reckon they're all wallowing in their own self-importance,,let's make a Marvel movie and it will be a hit. The whole premise needs a re-boot. This is turning into an X-Men storyline. Not good directing as there seems to be no start,middle and ending structure. You get the idea from the very start that all is gonna be o.k. Not a BAD movie but definitely only for die-hard fans ages 12 and up.Probably do well but the whole franchise needs to stop taking the audience for granted.All the actors seem to be a bit fed up with the whole thing and if they want more mileage from the franchise they should get a grip.",4,8,20,27 April 2015
Everest," Cold
",The hype surrounding this movie made we want to go see a fantastic action drama with awesome camera work.I didn't get any of it.Characters were shallow and the chance to show us a 3D spectacle were hopelessley missed.I felt I didn't care about the rich people wanting to do something real and felt as if there wasn't enough in the story about the local people or way of life.Not so much a disaster movie as a disaster.So much potential wasted .,3,39,71,22 September 2015
Mama," Chance missed
","Mama was a chance to give us a real supernatural thriller but after 20 mins began to become silly.The main strength of the movie was the use of eerie darkness and 'did I just see' moments.Good plot from the start but even that went downhill rapidly. the use of scary moments ,,like a face turning around at the screen with the eyes and mouth all glaring open were just overused and got a bit samey.The ending where Mama jumped off the edge of a cliff was just silly...( again..another facial close up..as if we haven't had enough of them already..) Not bad acting really but easily forgotten. Why do they think we need happy endings in a horror movie??Overview...started off promising but got dafter as it went along..CGI spoilt it too ..and all the squishy sound effects sounded silly.",6,0,0,1 September 2015
Don't Breathe," Don't Snore...
","What started off as a great idea( Check out the 1967 Wait Until Dark as that was what this movie wanted to be..without the silliness) Ended up as just a mess of plot holes and silliness.Ridiculous ideas thrown in to bring tension but fell flat..a lot of the audience were laughing at the scene where he tries to ,,,trying not to spoil it,,,let's say 'Impress' her.Tension is OK ..but it's like a kid shouting boo at you all day..you get fed up very quickly.'No Escape' from last year was the same..tried to overdo the tension and spoiled it.I think anybody aged 15 or so may have enjoyed it but anybody with a bit of common sense will just sit and watch till it goes off.",4,36,76,12 September 2016
Sicario," And the madness goes on...
","Just returned from the theatre after watching this...20 minutes later and my heart is still pumping.Brilliantly directed Thriller/Drama with excellent performances all around from start to finish.Benito Del Torro is completely stunning in this fantastic tale of good and bad and where to draw the line which is perfectly written with just enough pieces of very violent and loud,pumping action.The last 20 minutes had me on the edge of my seat and when I realised what was really going on I was hanging on every word till I got what I wanted and it did not let me down. Even then there was a few more messages before the final curtain ...the main one being that even though the story we were watching came to a conclusion..the hell and madness just keeps on going,,,,everyone is a victim.If you also look carefully there are two words shown on screen throughout ,,,did you spot them?One of the best of the year so far and that is from someone who goes at least twice a week..Brilliant 121 minutes..time for a beer to calm my nerves.",8,1,4,8 October 2015
The Happening," Missing the point
","Read a lot of reviews on this so watched it to see how it squared up.The first thing I noticed is that as it appears is EXACTLY how it was conceived. By that I meant it was made and acted to be a 50s or 60s B movie....and they pulled it off brilliantly.has a marvelous Twilight Zone feel to it and hams up the genre superbly.If you think about it , it's ;like playing a piano badly..( Look up Les Dawson on you tube)...you have to be well trained in how to make the notes sound just bad enough for you to recognise. I think all the negative reviewers have missed the point entirely and have had the wool pulled well and truly over their eyes. When they realise this they will feel fools.Imagine The Day Of The Triffids meets Creepshow...this is what you get.To all the amateur reviewers and movie watchers I say this..' Open your eyes '!!",4,1,3,6 August 2017
The Disaster Artist," Outsatnding
",Went into the cinema after booking online and on the way in passed all the Star Bores fans clutching their tickets and mountains of popcorn and nachos and just settled myself down in a nice comfortable seat.The difference in my demeanor and those other fools was obvious on leaving...they had just suffered overacted bilge with no plot lines and awful direction...and I had done exactly the same...but mine was meant to be that.Never seen a movie where not much happened but with so much class...remarkable in it's honest simplicity..I was glued to the screen with a grin from ear to ear.Outstanding performances all round with everybody getting in on the joke.The last scene was a joy to behold.this is exactly the opposite of what the sheep in the foyer went to see and it stayed with me for days. Also..I think it's a shame that come Oscars time James Franco will be forgotten..as in my opinion this is the performance of the year.just goes to show that you don't need the Hollywood strange elite to make wonderful cinema.Give star bores a miss and get this on the big screen.,8,0,3,16 December 2017
American Made," Back on form
","Tom Cruise back on form...and thank heavens for that.With the abysmal ' Mummy' still rotting in the movie graveyard...we get this little gem.Perfectly welded with tongue in cheek and a fair pace of action. It could have gone down the violent real life events we all know about...but they decided to go down the comfortable road and keep it classy.Very well made and had me giggling and smiling all the way through.My only criticism is if they took a very few scenes out( you'll know what I mean if you see it)then it could have been a 12A and my daughter would have had a chance to watch it,,shes like me..she loves movies.Wonderful Saturday night entertainment .",7,8,16,25 August 2017
The Witch," Disturbing in its simplicity
","I made a point of not watching any trailers of this so went in the cinema blind.Was I pleasantly surprised or let down...fact is I don't really know..Not what you might call a usual witch movie ..but I guess that is what I liked about it.The first few minutes contained some of the most disturbing scenes I can recall and hinted at religious hysteria...this carried on right through but kept it well hidden below the surface.A lot seemed to go on including sexual overtones and blind faith..each member was at some point hypocritical and seemed unable to take the strain of their own actions...instead they handed all of their fear and responsibility to God.Most of the movie used darkness to put the audience on edge and even though there was very few scares , the wait for them built up tension...sometimes they came and sometimes they never.Brilliantly filmed,written and directed this is in the same league as last years magnificent ' Babadook' ..but not as good...the performances were remarkable ..especially by the eldest daughter...I expect to see a lot more of her in the future..Not a classic but a deeply disturbing history lesson in folklore...not so much of a plot driven movie but more of a celluloid bad dream.Only for movie lovers who like something more thought provoking than a Hangover movie...something here to make you think.",6,4,8,14 March 2016
Sausage Party," Past it's sell by date

Performances all deserve full marks and direction is flawless.

In it's field you will not see better.
Steven Spielberg is a master of narrative and suspense....for me outdoing Hitchcock every step of the way.
Robert Shaw takes over every scene he is in...I haven't seen an actor do that since Jack Lemon..and more recently Denzil Washington in Fences.

How amazing is that.Not in the same league as the 33 ..but better than the 70s redo and a mile better than the ridiculous Jack Black rubbish.This is a creature feature people...it's all pretend...and in my opinion..very well pretended. a few hours at the cinema to see a story on screen..nothing more and nothing less.My 14 yr old daughter and grandson of 6 loved it. Maybe they should write the reviews instead of grown up Star Wars fans.Never tries to be character driven..never tries to be clever...doesn't dwell on some differences in helicopters or facts from the 70's...just hams it all up with bangs and smoke and bad guys and big scary animals.Great Stuff!!,6,0,0,2 August 2017

","As we sat and watched this I did what I always do and watched my children's faces...they weren't at all impressed...When we got home I did what I always do and sat them around while we talked about the movie...they remembered very little and did not seem to be bothered at all .Definitely not the best from Pixar and will be rush released on disc to cash in on the hype.Also, I cannot recall a movie that has been advertised for so long before it's release..it seems to have been trailered for months...and come to think of it I have not seen any merchandise or fast food endorsement at all.Not being able to really say why it failed I feel I cannot review properly...seems like a strange movie for them to make..was a bit uncomfortable at times and the characters were very odd...Not really sure at all about this..see for yourself.",4,2,31,1 July 2016
Arrival," Uninspiring
","The trailers would have you believe this is a sci fi movie,,but it isn't.I'ts yet another tale of our own mortality and how we treat each other as human beings and earth dwellers. I think at times the movie wallowed in it's own self importance and everybody was convinced this was a masterpiece from the outset.Many times before have we seen this idea..Midnight Special done it much,much better and cleverer , others include Contact..War of the Worlds and The Day The Earth Stood Still( including the re-make) ,, with the exception of Midnight Special all the others are probably on a par with Arrival.The thing I didn't get was when you say Sci Fi you think of science and spaceman..but nothing in the plot explained any of the science...the spaceships..time travel,,anything! Nothing went into the way the aliens traveled ..not too much of an important point but I think one that should have been addressed.I have a feeling this will probably bomb as it is ,dare I say it, a tad boring. Nobody gives any real performance and the direction is a bit dry and over sentimental.Beautifully filmed though..a treat for the eyes..nothing else..I gave it a 5 ..mediocre at best !",5,4,11,16 November 2016
Birdman or (The Unexpected Virtue of Ignorance)," Almost 10
","Not since Glenngarry Glen Ross has a director squeezed every ounce of talent from a cast.The plot seems to be almost secondary to the performances.Actors plod along at their own pace until all the stars form an alliance and something wonderful happens and in this movie everybody hits the pinnacle of their acting career at once. Superbly directed with a killer soundtrack this impeccable piece of celluloid hits every target and ticks every box.The plot is.....well..who cares about the plot? It's up to you what you think it was about , I think most people will come up with their own.Pushing the boundaries in film direction it never takes itself too seriously and left me thinking what shade of black this comedy was . Michael Keaton is astounding.Ed Norton really takes his part between his teeth and Emma Stone shows the talent missing from her other performances.Part of the reason I gave it a 9 is because I'm not sure if it will transfer to small screen. There's something about a movie of this class that loses something in the living room.Second part of the reason for a 9 is there can never be a sequel. This is the way movies should be made. A new benchmark.This is the movie that will change the way we think.Very small action sequences are perfectly directed and slipped in. Really should have cleaned up at the Oscars but I think the judges missed the point.Treat yourself and catch this if it's still around because you won't feel the force at home. Stunning breakthrough ...more more more.",9,0,4,11 April 2015

This is what film making is all about...enthralling from start to finish, with a soundtrack that out does La La Land...strong words I know but trust me..it does.Sad thing is as we walked through the foyer there was lines of fools queuing up to watch the newest episode in the awful ' Star Bores' saga..imagine a trip to the movies on Boxing Day only to find yourself missing out on a modern day classic to a Sci Fi pile up.all concerned to a fantastic job and direction is superb..only issue is we could have done with an extra 30 minutes to hear about the performers stories...hence the 9 instead of 10.If this was made 50 or so years ago it would still be being watched now...but alas thanks to peoples choices now it will just be another movie...and how sad that is.Leave the rest alone this week guys...and treat yourself to the experience of the cinema at it's best..off to but the soundtrack.",9,4,11,27 December 2017

Not a BAD movie...but instantly forgettable.Now....where was I?...oh yes...Midway.The CGI for me was just overdone..and i hoped the storytelling would make up for it...but alas no.All that money on blue screens and nothing spent on a script..and to be honest the acting was shocking.Not a bad way to spend a few hours but will be forgotten very soon,5,3,10,9 November 2019
Minions," IMDb for kids
","Amazing ...all adults reviewing a kids movie..You would not have children reviewing an 18 certificate movie. Note to all grown ups..this movie is for children. The main reason for most of you not giving a good and fair review is that it is not made for you,,you do not understand it!! I took a 12 year old and two 4 year olds and they absolutely loved it. The small yellow people with crazy voices are aimed at children. You all think you have the right to give your opinion on a movie aimed at children but you don't. Get a grip on yourself folks and just listen to yourselves. My clan were open mouthed all the way through..amazing to see a cinema full of children laughing out loud together and not nit picking or trying to make clever assessments.As far as I could make out even the parents enjoyed it so cannot understand where all the negativity came from.I think it maybe time for a child only review page for 12 and under movies.",6,6,14,2 July 2015
Spectre," What a let down from Sam Mendes...again!
","I've been waiting for Sam Mendes to give us a taste of the familiar Bond we all know and love , but alas no.Very slow to start and the opening scene which is a given in any Bond movie was very, very well below par and what usually gives us an insight to let us know what's in store was very lacklustre and lasted only a minute ..if that.( That was a taste of what was to come)I think Craigs Bond is too much of a pouting, Icon-friendly lead and tries far too much to be dark and personal to the main character.Is it me or do we feel like that just for once he would lose and not be so smarmy all the time.Another thing is why don't they just shoot him instead of locking him up and giving him so many minutes to escape before telling him all their dastardly plans.Came across like a really rushed affair at production level and how I wish we could go back to proper villains like Scaramanga and proper tongue in cheek Bonds like Roger Moore.The whole new franchise needs a good rethink and some light entertainment and quirky Bond.",4,16,46,26 October 2015
Joy," Mini Masterpiece
","After reading some reviews I thought I would go along and see for myself what was going on.1st thing that I have to say is as it opens it just draws you in and after 5 minutes you are eager to see the people develop. All the characters are introduced all at once so you want to see how they all gel. Moreover the lead shows us what a brilliant young actor/ess she is..taking the lead in every scene and even out shining Bob DeNiro,,,not easy that, Being a seasoned movie addict who goes 3 or 4 times a week,,,I think we have at least 2 Oscar nominations this early o. best screenplay..best Lead ..maybe best support and probably best direction.Masterful little gem here,,,lot of negative reviews I think were expecting a murder of bad language,,,but none of it. My best of the year so far.",7,2,9,6 January 2016

13 Hours," Double edged
",After seeing this I have to review in 2 parts...As a movie it was sort of OK but full of clichés and with such a high testosterone content you could almost smell it...a fairly well directed movie slightly let down by some poor 2 dimensional acting...you could tell Bay has good special effect directorship but as yet needs to learn character direction.2nd part is the content...after reading up about the subject matter I was astonished at the ridiculous U.S propaganda rubbish..it almost bordered on obscene the way the ' heroes' were all macho and well disciplined and all the ' bad guys' were toothless idiots.I think the stereotyping has dragged this into the ridiculous and anybody feeling proud of this sort of ' anti-everything-unAmerican' should feel rather ashamed.I also got the feeling it was about 30 minutes too long...it took an age to actually end. I would suggest Bay should stick to bubblegum and CGI.,4,39,104,1 February 2016
The Martian," Inter Galactic 3D Spectacle.
","I like to watch movies twice to get a full idea of what is going on but only caught this once.For starters it is fantastically filmed in 3D , which takes it to another level as viewing is concerned. I feel the story was minimalised for the big screen from the book as it didn't have enough narrative and should maybe have had more solo self observation scenes but like I said , having not read the book I cannot say.Good solid performances all around and a real feel good vibe. Plenty of nonsense and gung -ho American spirit..at one point I expected Ed Harris to show up and shout yeehah.Great way to spend 141 minutes away from the norm of life though and both me and my 12 yr old daughter enjoyed it largely due to the quality of the 3D filming..the space scenes were absolutely magnificent.Blast off to the nearest cinema and enjoy.",5,3,67,2 October 2015
Furious 7," poor
","From start to finish this movie does it's best to be cool but misses it's mark time and time and time again. Preposterous plot lines and awful action scenes make this celluloid drivel a yawn-fest! Aimed at teenage girls who miss the point and soppy- eyed teens who fancy Paul Whattsisname , it relies on slow motion action sequences that obviously make it easier to take in ! I gave this a 2 because in fairness a whole lotta people worked their butts off to bring this off! I'm gonna keep this review for 'Fast and furious 8' because its going to be exactly the same as this and the last 6! Forgive and forget says the bible,,,ill forget but i really cannot forgive!! Awful in the extreme!",2,6,23,7 May 2015
The Godfather," Why all the fuss
","Having seen this movie many years ago I sat to re-engage and watched again. I cannot understand the hype about this movie. I think that people hear that its the best movie made then automatically accept this opinion and convince themselves it is. The scene with the horses head was ridiculous really. Acting by Brando was at best mediocre and James Caan is useless . I don't even reckon FFC as a director either, especially after Gangs Of New York. If this was made in present day it would probably flop. The 2 sequels got worse and the supporting characters never seemed to fit in.I would imagine the book is a million times better. The only redeeming feature for me was seeing Al Pacino honing his acting skills he used so brilliantly used in the later Serpico and Scarface. Sorry but this never gripped me at all.Am I right in thinking Brando changed his looks,size and accent many times during this?",4,5,12,14 June 2015
