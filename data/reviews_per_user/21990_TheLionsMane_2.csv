The Incredible Hulk," Over all, as good as Iron Man.
","When I heard Edward Norton was going to be the Hulk, I was surprised. Can he pull it off, I thought. He did.I quite enjoyed the 2003 version, and was wondering - hoping - that this reboot would top it. It did.The story was changed and improved, CGI was fantastic, chemistry was perfect, and the amazing end fight had me very impressed.When I saw Iron Man, I wondered, 'Will the Hulk equal, or perhaps better it?' It did. MILD SPOILERS BELOW!!!Tony Stark's cameo was a pleasant surprise, and I hope to see Iron Man and the Hulk in a movie soon.Overall, just as good as Iron Man. That is, 9/10.",9,3,5,16 June 2008
Shrek 2," One of the best summer films this year.
","Every once in a while there comes a film that is better than the first installment. Shrek 2 is definitely one of them. It has all the prequel has and more. It is amusing, touching, and action-packed, and has a perfect cast. Shrek is just like he was before, a green, ugly, but good-hearted ogre who just wants the best for his wife. Donkey is the same hilarious, stubborn mule who just doesn't have a clue. Fiona is deeply in love with Shrek, but as with every husband and wife has arguments with him. And then there is the new characters, most notable of which, from my point of view, is Puss in Boots. He could well take over the role of best friend from Donkey, although I hope that never happens. He is funny and cute, but at the same time there is the menacing side to him, the side of the resourceful assassin with a deadly reputation, which makes him a likable character, but one who can't be trusted all the same. In my vote, ******** out of **********.",9,0,0,8 July 2004
