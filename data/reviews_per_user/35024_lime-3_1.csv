The Blair Witch Project," Very believable and effective film,but a dead end.
","I found this film to be one of the most original and powerful I've seen recently. It is based on a once-in-lifetime idea. The story is told in a totally subjective, POV manner, more so than any film I know. I can understand why many people disliked it. It made no concessions to the expectations of mainstream filmgoers, or even of horror film fans. And once the 'mythic' groundwork was laid, plot points tended to be made subtly, and with 'don't blink' speed. Anyone used to being 'spoon-fed' plot and character would likely miss much. The characters' realization of their situation and increasing terror were revealed gradually and very naturalistically, which may have made the film seem slow to some. It is, in its way, a great film, and a greater horror film, but I cannot see how it can be followed up at all effectively.  It would do better to remain unique. A sequel would surely seem contrived and redundant, and a different film using same or similar technique would merely seem derivative.",Null,0,1,7 November 1999
