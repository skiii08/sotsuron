Captain Phillips," Movie is better than a slightly miscast Tom Hanks
","First let me say i am a big fan of Tom Hanks.However i have to say i felt him slightly miscast in this movie,not that it spoils the movie in anyway at all,i just think he got the role because of who he is rather than what he could bring to the role.Don't however let this put you off what is a fine movie.You will be entertained by the whole experience but may be not bowled over by it. Its well made in all aspects as you would expect from those behind the project.Not in the same league as many of his other films but nevertheless a worthy effort and well worth a watch.This is my first review i think it may be boring but hopefully they will get better with time.Thanks to all other reviewers they really help to find the odd gem that sometimes slip under the radar.",7,1,3,19 January 2014
