First Man," Not an action movie. This is not a bad thing.
","From the tight POV of Neil Armstrong we experience the march to the moon. Despite the rah-rah we observers got from official news media, this movie focuses on the disorienting & often terrifying moments Armstrong endured during the run-up to the first moon landing.
This movie is about fear, persistence, the consequences of taking risks. To fault it for lack of thrills you had to have missed the very human drama.",7,1,1,4 January 2020
