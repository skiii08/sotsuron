First Man," How it felt to be the first.
",I love this film.This isn't sci-fi; this isn't fantasy. This isn't a family movie. This is the experience of being Neil Armstrong over the course of several years and several missions. I found it incredibly interesting.If you don't have a big TV screen and surround sound then I recommend not watching the movie because the air/space missions in this movie are beautiful and need to be properly experience or they won't be appreciated.,9,2,3,22 May 2019
