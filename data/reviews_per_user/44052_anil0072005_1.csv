Sucker Punch," A visually stunning experience!!!
","Zack Snyder did it again by putting his wide imagination on to screen. As i am a game freak, the movie awesome for me. Enjoyed it to the core. 5 hot girls, robots, zombies, dragons, and lots of breath taking action!!! what else one want!! Zack Snyder the only one in this business who can deliver such a stunning visual effects. i saw its first trailer in September and it released today... i must say the wait was worth every scene!!! movie is very rich from the cinematography point of view!!! every frame of the movie was so detailed and amazing!!! the movie has a different style!! and all the ingredient of Zack!!",10,7,16,25 March 2011
