Scarface," havent seen godfathers but i like this one
","i really liked this movie, and i cant understand anyone's gripes about it. tony montana is a real man's man.  everyone he kills (with the exception of manny) deserved it in the sense that they intended to stab him in the back or kill him up front. he made a conscious decision not to kill any women and children, and he jeopardized his own life to save the lives of these women and children he doesnt even know.  though he is a drug dealer (and therefore a despicable character), he does have definite convictions by which he uncompromisingly lives his life. the fact that he stays so true to himself even in the face of death shows the character that he is.the violence in this movie is gritty, real and absolutely necessary.  i find it amazing that teh chainsaw scene showed so little graphicaly (as opposed to the more graphic braveheart or saving private ryan; both of which i love), yet still was just as repulsive adn sickening as many more graphic scenes in other movies. granted, tony montana earns his money illegitimately, but his character is the full and uncensored expression of masculinity and testosterone, more so than any other character i have personally ever come across.",10,0,0,16 January 2002
Fight Club," The ending took away from the rest of the movie a bit
","The imagery was amazing; one memorable scene (*SPOILER) was when the project mayhem army was tilling the backyard field while Tyler spoke on a megaphone 'you are not a beautiful snowflake.'  THe entire scene was shot like a warzone out of 'Saving Private Ryan'..absolutely fascist! The use of special effects was cool too, it was nice to see how technology can accentuate artwork in other ways besides creating velociraptors and such.
what a good movie! hilarious at times, wierd at times, but entertaining all through the film.  IT explores themes such as masculinity, corporatism, consumerism, and so on, and the acting is great.  as the film nears a close, though, the plot becomes more and more strange.  The final ending was a bit much for me (*SPOLIERS ABOUT TO BE DIVULGED), especially when he shot himself in the mouth.  Somehow, that shot killed tyler, but didn't kill him. The buildings blowing up and the fall of corporations was all right, but him somehow surviving a shot to the head, and then talking afterward kind of took away from the ending.  Maybe i just don't get it.",10,0,1,28 August 2001
American Beauty," if you haven't seen it, GO WATCH IT NOW
","the reason this movie is so good is because of a combination of an amazing script with amazing acting.  The film is able to transcend the fact that it is just a story and truly grip the viewer.  It was just like reading a fantastic novel where you can completely relate to the character's perspectives and experiences.  to those who claim this film merely mirrors a repeating theme in hollywood movies, i have to say that i don't know what you are talking about.  i have never seen a movie that shows a dysfuctional American family as accurately and with as much character depth as this movie.  It is very easy to empathize with all of the characters, even the stuck up teenage girl (i know girls just like her!) when, at the end, you realize she too is fragile and human.  Just watching it, i could honestly see echoes of people I know in every single main character. If you can't relate to this movie, then just look next door or across the street from your home, because the same thing is happening all around you.  The film really grips you emotionally, so when the movie presents the theme of beauty in life, it is incredibly uplifting, just like a great novel.  A mix of literature including 'Death of a Salesman' and 'A Long Day's Journey into Night.' a very enjoyable movie-going experience.",Null,0,0,28 August 2001
American History X," great movie
","at my high school, frank meeink, the white supremacist on whom this story is loosely based, came and gave a talk about his life of hate.  this movie shows a great perspective on hatred from the view of a white supremacist.  i can understand how a disillusioned white can turn to racism for meaning or support. the ending was perfect (*spoiler).  the kid just learned the flaws of his life, realized that hatred is absolutely pointless, and then he is killed in an act of hatred from the other way around. perfect.",Null,0,0,18 September 2001
Mulholland Drive," wow, that was a waste ot time
","Making an intricate puzzle out of a movie doesn't automatically make the movie great.  Movies like 'Fight Club' or 'Memento' would be decent movies even if they weren't made to be difficult for the viewer to understand. This movie is ridiculous!  *SPOILERS* The old people knocking on the woman's door at the end and making her go crazy was a bit much, especially when they showed the two old airplane people as miniature people coming out of the bum's blue box.*Fight club spoiler*  I mean, yes when Ed Norton shot himself and lived in 'Fight Club' it was a little strange, but this goes way beyond that.  There were parts when i was literally laughing at how stupid the movie was getting.  Also, the blonde-haired actor's acting abilities at first were awful, and almost made me leave early.  There are no redeeming qualities in this movie that kept me interested other than the lesbian sex scenes.",1,5,13,11 October 2001
