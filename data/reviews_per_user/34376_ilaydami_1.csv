Blade Runner 2049," Not only stunning, but also marvelous
","I was impressed with film but the fiction was too complicated. If I want to understand the film clearly, I will need to watch one more time. In addition, as the film's originality dated to back, it became more valuable for me. One of my another excuses is that the film was so long. When we came to towards to end of film, it became more boring but not unexciting. Despite these excuses, the film was quite succesful. I recommend you to watch as soon as possible :)",9,1,3,25 December 2017
