Ghost," A real feel-good film
","I'm not usually so fond of sappy emotional films, but I just can't help but like this one. Whoopi Goldberg is fantastic! I kept forgetting I was watching her as she so vividly 'created' this other persona (Oda Mae). Demi Moore was pretty good, but she had a kind of wimpy role (perfect for her acting ability). Patrick Swayze proved that he can do more than just gyrate his hips around. Before this movie, I didn't realize he could act!Anyway, a really nice movie, makes you feel good.",Null,1,2,23 May 2000
The Shawshank Redemption," Outstanding, simply outstanding!
","All my friends had the same reaction to this movie as I did when first viewing it .. how come I never heard more about it? It was great! The acting was fantastic. The storyline flowed perfectly. The writing and editing couldn't have been better.  Clearly, if not pitted against 'Forrest Gump', 'Little Women', 'Nell', 'Quiz Show' and 'Pulp Fiction' (wow, what a line-up), I'm sure this movie would have won more awards. Morgan Freeman was great, and Tim Robbins was nothing short of amazing. If you like acting, this movie is a must!",Null,0,0,23 May 2000
The Sixth Sense," A surprisingly good movie
","The script was well written and clever. Everyone who sees the movie raves about the ending, and for good reason. The movie is constructed to fit the ending perfectly. Haley Joel Osment plays the little boy who 'sees dead people' and gives an outstanding performance. I hope that he gets more good parts in future films; I'd like to see more of him. Bottom line - if you haven't seen this movie, it's definitely one you should see.",8,0,0,4 June 2000
