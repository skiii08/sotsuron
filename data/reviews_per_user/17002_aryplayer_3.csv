The Avengers," It is as good a superhero movie as there can be
","Avengers is one hell of an action movie. It is as good a superhero movie as there can be,,,,,, it is an emotional,hilarious(=Robert Downey Jr.), and action packed superhero movie....As far as acting goes.. its an absolute knockout by all the actorsRobert Downey Jr.----> 10/10(Executed the best lines in the best possible way or should we say his natural way)Chris Evans----> 8/10Mark Ruffalo--->10/10(Probably the most cool minded and seemingly not partially mentally impaired,Bruce banners unlike others portrayed)Chris Hemsworth----> 8/10(good physique yet again, apt for a demigod)Scarlett Johansson---->9/10(Served Hot and dangerous)Jeremy Renner---->9/10Tom Hiddleston---->10/10(It takes some really good acting to portray the god of mischief, really seemed to play with their minds)Samuel L. Jackson---->10/10(Good as always)The writing was great with some really good dialogues with punchTwo of the most outstanding scenes of the movie are towards the end, first when Iron Man gets into his new Mach7 IRON MAN suit in a free fall after being thrown down by Loki,And secondly when Loki was boosting about him being a demigod in front of Hulk who breaks his trash talk & him too, just grabbing him & giving good old bash to the ground('dhobi pachad') to knock him out....(this is a must watch scene)also is the scene where Hulk stops the first big monster,,,,OVERALL 10/10(Considering it a Superhero movie, it is the best there is now)This movie has got style if not anything else.......so this is a must watch movie & if you don't, well you have certainly missed one,,,,,,",10,14,28,27 April 2012
Sherlock Holmes: A Game of Shadows," A definite must watch for witty dialogues,good acting(Robert Downy Jr) especially, and great direction & Script
","What a bloody awesome movie is SHERLOCK HOLMES:A GAME OF SHADOWS.,.,.,.,,the starting seemed to be slow but only after a while you would realize that it is like loading of a gun, once the plot is the following sequences are like machine gun,.,.you cannot take your eyes away from the screen for a moment or you won't know what you will miss. And I haven't seen a better slow motion shooting than in this movie after Sherlock & Gang escape from the Gun Factory.,.it is one of the best of this year,,the acting of Robert Downy Jr.,is well stupendous, Naomi Rapace & Jude Law have played their role very well. The comedy sequence are really hilarious, Watson's Wedding ,between Watson's wife & Mycroft Holmes ,especially when Holmes throws Watson's wife from the train on her way to honeymoon,but the greatest triumph as always was the direction of Guy Ritchie and the script,,,, it will blow you. Not to mention the climax scene,,,,,just waiting for Sherlock Holmes 3..............It is Definitely a must watch.",9,1,2,30 December 2011
Rockstar," don't watch the movie if you want to save your time & Money,rather buy its music CD's and enjoy,It is very promising but eventually it disappoints a bit
","Just watched ROCKSTAR today,and all I can say about the movie is -----------------------------> 'don't waste your money on this movie'.Go only if you want to see an emotional,romantic,overdose with your girlfriend/boyfriend,and don't complain if u are disappointed by the climax,it is absolutely out of the reaches of understanding,but the music is great(not necessarily its placement in the movie),acting is good,Imtiaz Ali is a star making Machine,,,,,but even he cannot make a great movie if he is not given a good script.,.,,.that by the way is the major flaw of the movie,the first half is very promising but the second half is equally disappointing,its like 'The Adjustment Beaureau',where the problem starts because a girl is in a place where she doesn't belong.So watch this movie with someone you love,but only the first half then get get out,otherwise watch it only if you don't have to spend any money for it,.,.,.,.,.,",Null,1,3,13 November 2011
