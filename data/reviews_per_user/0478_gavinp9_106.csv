Ford v Ferrari," Well-made and enjoyable racing biopic
","'Ford v Ferrari' - underwhelming title, but exceptionally put-together sports biopic about the 24-hour endurance Le Mans motor race in 1966. If that puts you off, the good news is that the film's not all about racing - probably only ~30% - with much of the focus on Shelby (Damon), Miles (Bale) and Miles' wife, Mollie (Balfe) and son, Peter (Jupe). There's also the tension with Ferrari, where Ford executives Iacocca (Bernthal), Beebe (Lucas) and Ford (Letts) are trying to take the racing crown from Ferrari (Girone) and Agnelli (Cirfiera)It's nice to hear Bale using his actual English accent and the rapport he has with Damon carries the film. All the actors are good, but their relationship is what has you caring about what happens, rather than just the cars. The pacing is quick and it feels faster (pardon the pun) than 2.5 hours. This would be as good as, if not better than, 'Rush' and 'Senna'.Great directing from Mangold (coming off 'Logan') throughout, with a nice balance of family time, racing scenes and the car politics. The fact the 24-hour race is condensed to less than 20min and feels both quick and like it's been a marathon is a true feat. If you don't know the story, don't Google it and let the ending be a surprise. There's good editing, cinematography, authentic 60s cars and soundtrack throughout.",8,2,5,20 November 2019
Blade Runner 2049," Visually stunning, but not much emotional impact
","'Blade Runner 2049' comes 35 years after the original - and you have to ask, 'why?' Directed by Villeneuve ('Arrival') and only produced by Ridley Scott (why is he involved in his own sequel, but not directing?), it doesn't even attempt to answer the main question of the first film - is Deckard (Ford) a replicant? Why is it always raining? Why do Ford & Leto only have a total of about four scenes between them? Why does it go for over 2 & a half hours?There is some plot, with K (Gosling) being a replicant Blade Runner, tasked by Joshi (Wright) to track down runaway replicants, which leads to uncovering a mystery surrounding Deckard & Rachael. It takes 100min for Ford to even appear. In the meantime, Hans Zimmer tries to recreate the original's iconic score, but not as synth-y and sometimes a bit too overwrought. There's a lot of K interacting with Joi (de Armas), his 'Her'-like holographic maid. Most of this is handled quite well, with the CGI of Joi interacting with the light and her surroundings done excellently. But, it doesn't help move the film along at all.There is occasional bits of action/violence, mostly thanks to Luv (Hoeks), but not enough to sustain the first two hours, with the clues slowly unravelling and not much excitement. It does pick up in the final 45min and has a passable ending, but mostly I'm left with the feeling of 'it looks cool, but why do I care?' Good to see heaps more of the flying cars, and like 'Star Wars', everything looks realistic and 'lived-in', but most of the concepts have now been explored better by 'Terminator' and 'Mad Max'.",6,1,4,2 January 2018
First Man," Not overly engaging historical drama
","'First Man' is the story of Neil Armstrong (Gosling) and how he became the first human to walk on the moon. It's amazing that after almost 50 years, this film's never been made before - but we've had 'Space Cowboys'! While largely focused on Armstrong, the film does a good job of showing how essential all the other NASA engineers and astronauts were during the 1960s to making the Apollo 11 mission a success.The film spends almost as much time exploring Neil's relationships with his family - wife Janet (Foy) & sons Eric (Winters) and Mark (Blodgett). They certainly go through their share of tragedies and funerals, making the film quite melodramatic. It almost gets bogged down in politics in the middle too. While Gosling's OK, he comes across a quite bland and boring - possibly intentionally. I think he was going for humble, but ended up as mild.The film's at it's best when it's focusing on space - rather than watching the rocket launch from distance, like on TV, we're stuck in the cockpit with the astronauts as they're shut in, and it's quite claustrophobic. But instead of cutting away, we experience lift-off from their point of view - all the noise, shaking and velocity. It's annoying there's often a black screen for seconds at a time, but it's realistic for space. The score's OK and you do get to spend some time on the moon. It's certainly no 'Apollo 13' or 'Gravity', but has it's moments.",6,45,98,11 October 2018
Deepwater Horizon," Very solid action/disaster flick
","'Deepwater Horizon' (already sounds like an ominous novel!) is a disaster film about the BP oil rig off Louisiana, in the Gulf of Mexico, that blew up in 2010 and caused the largest oil spill in US history (800 million litres). Mike (Wahlberg) is the Chief Electronics Technician on the floating rig and they set-up his home life (Hudson is his wife and gets a few token scenes), as well as Andrea (Rodriguez), the helmsman. When they get to the rig, the Transocean rig workers - Jimmy (Russell) is the boss - are clearly distinguished from the BP visitors/owners, including Vidrine (Malkovich).The film is intentionally overt in painting BP as careless, profiteering 'sons of bitches' and almost the sole cause of the disaster, which is probably not 100% accurate, but can't be too far off. Great line from Mike: 'Hope is not a strategy'. After 40min of setting the scene - with the set apparently one of the biggest ever built - the action begins and the pace doesn't slow at all after. There's some great underwater shots and the issues with pressure are explained well enough. The last hour is a hectic and tense amalgamation of explosions, gushing oil, people getting thrown around by explosions and Mike and Jimmy trying to evacuate everyone off the rig.This is Berg and Wahlberg's second film - after the great 'Lone Survivor' - and it's a well-made disaster film, with no dead air, not too much posturing, a likeable lead in Wahlberg, builds tension well and then has some awesome shots of the rig burning and exploding. Nice memorial at the end.",7,1,2,2 January 2018
It," Above-average horror/thriller
","'It' is the 'killer clown' horror film, based on Stephen King's novel. It's set in Derry, Maine in 1989, and kids keep going missing - including Bill (Lieberher)'s brother, Georgie (Scott). Bill and his 'loser' friends - Richie (Wolfhand), Eddie (Grazer), Stanley (Oleff), Mike (Jacobs) & Ben (Taylor) - go searching for Georgie in their summer break, thinking he might be in the sewers. Of course, we're introduced to Pennywise the clown (Skarsgard) before the titles, so we know what happened to Georgie.If you don't like clowns - this films not going to cure that! However, I didn't find it really frightening, with some jumps (mostly thanks to the score), but not too much that it truly horrific or ultra-creepy. Sure, there's some blood, some teeth, plenty of shadows and things popping up, but it never really felt to me like the kids were in too much danger. What is excellently conveyed is the apathy and 'off'-ness of the adults, meaning it's all up to Bill & the gang to figure out.Ben figures out the 'every 27 years' connection and Beth (Lillis) gets involved, after they've each encountered their worst fears and Pennywise. The film's a great ode to friendship and sticking together - I just feel like it's done better in 'Stranger Things', which is why it's a shame Wolfhand is in both. This film is probably a bit longer than necessary, but has a good late-80s soundtrack and is better than the 1990 version. I'd say watch it - so long as you're over 13...",7,0,0,2 January 2018
Gravity," Excellent - the best film this year! Don't miss it.
","I went into 'Gravity' with no expectations and this film gripped me and took me on an amazing ride, all in under 90min. And I certainly didn't see it in 3D! If you've seen the trailer and you're wondering 'how do they make a film out of an astronaut floating through space, when we've basically seen it all in the trailer?', then all I can say is - go and see this movie, it's definitely worth your time!Compared to 'Apollo 13', which was dull and too drawn out, 'Gravity' doesn't stop to catch its breath once (nice pun!). It's basically six major scenes/set-pieces, all in rapid fire, with Bullock & Clooney playing quite interesting characters, even though we only get a short time to learn about them. It works well as a sci-fi/space film - one of the major selling points is the beautiful shots of Earth from above - but also as a tense survival thriller/drama. How much can go wrong in 90min? You'll find out!I particularly liked how there's at least some scientific accuracy, such as when they're in space/an airlock, it's virtually silent (yes, 'in space no one can hear you scream' - thanks 'Alien') and sound only filters back in as the air enters the vacuum. That and the fact that NASA would have a scientist working on the Hubble telescope, rather than a random engineer. 'Gravity' does virtually everything well - the isolation of space, the beauty of Earth, the terror of being trapped, the 'would I still go into space if I had the chance?' and the emotional investment in the characters survival. I actually found myself on the edge of my seat a few times!",9,0,1,2 January 2018
Lone Survivor," Excellent cinematography, score, acting and story make this a superb war film where you do care about the characters you're watching
","'Lone Survivor' is a very well-made and fast paced war film. It helps that it's a true story out of Afghanistan and does a great job of setting the scene and characters in the first half hour, before putting you right in amongst the action for the final 90min. I really liked how some of the camerawork was frantic in the right moments and slow/steady in the other moments. Let me just say that when they 'descend' the hillside, you really feel it!Is 'Lone Survivor' as good as 'Saving Private Ryan'? That's debatable, but it's certainly better than 'Black Hawk Down' in my books, as far as modern war films go. There's no politics involved, just survival, and this has plenty of teeth-gritting moments! It helps that there's only really the four characters on their own in the wilderness - does a great job of showing the isolation.There's a fair bit of blood and violence, but nothing too grisly and it all looks very realistic - there's no cohesion to what the soldiers (Navy SEALs, rather) do, they're literally fighting for their lives as best they can. The photos at the end compared with the actors are good, although Peter Gabriel's cover of 'Heroes' would've been better served if it was the David Bowie original. Otherwise, a great score.",8,1,3,2 January 2018
Wind River," Really well-made murder mystery
","'Wind River' is from the writer of 'Sicario' & 'Hell or High Water', but is only Sheridan's second directorial effort, which makes it all the more impressive. It's a really simple plot - a Native American teenager is found dead, by Lambert (Renner) in the Wind River reservation and Banner (Olsen) is the FBI agent assigned to solve the case. Lambert is a tracker and hunter ad knows the terrain, so helps local cop Ben (Greene) and Banner in the snowy mountains.Nick Cave & Warren Ellis bring their sparse, 'Skeleton Tree'-like sounds to the score and soundtrack, and it definitely helps set the mood and highlight the sparseness of the northern Winter (or Spring, technically). The film moves along quite rapidly, with the investigation never boring, but still time to build plenty of backstory for Lambert and the reservation.The final 20min or so is handled really well, with a few surprises thrown in. Similar to the Australian-set 'Goldstone' in some ways. It all looks beautiful (odd that it was filmed in Utah, not in the real-life reservation in Wyoming), with plenty of nice scenic and animal shots, but also plenty of sadness. Renner and Olsen carry the film with nuanced performances, and there's thankfully no romantic distractions. It's just a great, straightforward crime-solving scenario, done right.",8,4,6,2 January 2018
The Death of Stalin," Enjoyable historical/political satire.
","'The Death of Stalin' is a satirical look at 1950's USSR (from the director of 'In The Loop' a hilarious look at British politics, who's also the creator of 'Veep'). This is similar to 'In The Loop', if not quite as good, with mostly British actors playing Russians and not changing their accents, making for a refreshing and playful tone. Even though the majority are British - including Beria (Russell Beale), Molotov (Palin), Zhuov (Isaacs) & Stalin (McLoughlin) - two of the main actors are American: Krushchev (Buscemi) and Malenkov (Tambor).The film is basically about Beria, head of NKVD (Internal Affairs) and Krushchev, First Secretary, scheming and plotting to run Russia after Stalin dies - even though it's technically Malenkov, who's basically a puppet. There's plenty of fun digs at how inept the Soviets were, but also some commentary on how bad things were during the Cold War. Main problem with the film is the lack of backstory - obviously based somewhat on facts, but a lot of creative license taken - but things happen so fast that it takes a while to figure out who's who, etc.There's a few laughs, but no real hilarious moments, expect maybe when Buscemi tries to swap places with Tambor. There's plenty to like, and all the actors are good, especially Buscemi, Kurylenko and Russell Beale - and always good to see a Python on screen with Palin. However, I felt it lacked something to make it a truly great comedy.",6,0,2,2 April 2018
Fury," Solid, realistic war film, if unspectacular
","'Fury' is set right at the end of World War II, with the American's slowly forcing the Nazis back towards Berlin. This is different to lots of WWII films, since it's not D-Day, or the Western front, or Pearl Harbour - it's just five guys in a tank, driving across Germany, fighting Nazis when they appear. And that's the film's strong point - it's very realistic. There's death, mud, weary soldiers, fleeing civilians and prisoners everywhere.Sure, it wasn't filmed in Germany (England instead), but the costumes and sets look believable. There's really only three battle scenes, with the reality of war (lots of waiting around) being illustrated to full effect. And while probably accurate, the drawn out interludes of no action make the film longer than necessary - I think this would have made an excellent 1 hour 45 min film, rather than 2 hours 15 min.Don (Pitt) is not actually the main character - it's really about new recruit Noman (Lerman) and how he fits in with this tight Sherman tank crew, and more importantly, how he deals with the horrors of war and killing other humans. The tracer fire looks great on the screen, but there's not enough action or incentive to care for the characters and their mission to make this a classic war film. See 'Patton' if you haven't!",7,0,4,2 January 2018
Rogue One: A Star Wars Story," Solid Star Wars film - not mind-blowing, but doesn't detract from the originals
","'Rogue One' (or 'Star Wars Episode 3.5') is the first standalone Star Wars film (excluding 2008's CGI 'The Clone Wars' film), which is both its strong point and part of it's burden. It's hard to write a review objectively, since Star Wars is one of my favourite things ever, and almost every second scene is a reference to something from the Star Wars universe, so it's hard to imagine it from a context of someone coming in not having seen anything else Star Wars. And frankly, if you haven't seen the original trilogy, you need a good hard look at your priorities in life!I say this is like episode 3.5, but it's actually more like episode 3.9, with the ending leading directly into 'A New Hope'. The film centres on how the Rebel Alliance obtained the Death Star plans, that allows Luke Skywalker to blow it up. The introduction of Krennic (Mendelsohn), Galen Erso (Mikkelsen) and his daughter, Jyn (Jones) is done well, but there's not that much backstory. Basically, Galen's forced to build the Death Star, explain why there's a clear design flaw, and the rebels are sent on a frantic chase to steal the plans and get them to Princess Leia in time.There's a decent cast, with Yen & Jiang probably the best (even though I'm not sure you learn their names?), Rook (Ahmed) as the Imperial defector who grows in importance, Cassian (Luna) the rebel pilot who's had to do plenty of unpleasant deeds, and the droid K-2SO (Tudyk), who steals almost every scene he's in. Saw (Whitaker), Mon Mothma (O'Reilly), Bail Organa (Smits) and the CGI Tarkin don't have that much to do. There's obviously a few cameos, with Darth Vader getting two scenes. I did like the film, but I probably wanted to like it more than I did. It tries hard, but it's hard to connect with the characters, especially as we know how it's going to end. The best bits by far are seeing the new planets, the Death Star in action, the set-design/feel of Yavin 4 and the rebel fleet, and the space battle at the end.",7,0,0,2 January 2018
Captain Marvel," Another well-made Marvel super-hero origin story
","'Captain Marvel' builds the bridge between 'Avengers: Infinity War' and 'Avengers: Endgame' and does a good job of it. Most of the film works well as the standalone origin story of Carol Danvers (Larson), as she pieces together her past. Starting with her already on the Kree (the blue aliens, as seen in 'Guardians of the Galaxy') home world is smart and saves dealing with the whole aliens on Earth thing. Vers is being trained by Yon-Rogg (Law) and has almost no memory her life on Earth, save some snippets of Lawson (Bening) and Maria (Lynch).After Carol ends up back on Earth, she starts to unravel the mystery of who she is, with the help of Nick Fury (Jackson) and (to a lesser degree) Coulson (Gregg). She reunites with Maria and deciphers that they both used to be pilots - which leads to some good jet battles later on! The main plot though is that Carol is caught in the middle of an intergalactic war between the Kree and the Skrulls (the green aliens, shapeshifters). Talos (Mendelsohn) is a Skrull and does a great job - great to hear his Aussie accent when he's in Skrull form! Ronan (Pace) is back for some scenes, but the other Kree offsiders don't have that much to do.There's still a bit of jigsaw-piecing-together going on (stay for the end credit scene), but when Larson and Jackson are on screen, it's a very solid action/adventure film. There was more laughs than I was expecting, especially with the 'flerken'! It's not 'Thor: Ragnarok', but the 90s film and music references are fun to see/hear. Great to watch Carol's powers develop and the 'twist' just after halfway through. It's not too long and there's under seven weeks until 'Avengers: Endgame' (likely to be the highest-grossing film ever).",8,1,3,9 March 2019
This Is the End," Good, not great - still better than most comedies out there
","Pretty fun - and how could it not be with such an amazing cast!? The only problem is I had such high expectations and it just didn't quite meet them.It's a pretty simple premise: a group of friends (who just happen to be the new Hollywood comedy masterminds that can be found in Superbad, Pineapple Express, Knocked Up, Tropic Thunder, Fanboys, Zack & Miri Make A Porno, etc.) go to a party when the Rapture/Apocalypse/End of Days arrives and they have to use their survival skills to overcome the fact that they're all playing exaggerated versions of themselves, so they're constantly having dumb arguments! Heaps of cameos at the start - Aziz Ansari, Kevin Hart, Michael Cera, Emily Watson, Jason Segel, Paul Rudd, Rihanna - so it's fun to play 'spot the comedian/celebrity'.Plenty of laugh-out-loud moments throughout, but lots of stupidity at times, as they try to take it too far. It ends up going too long - 1 hour 50 min - and overstays its welcome a little bit.I found it ironic that Jay is essentially the main star, even though he's the least well known of the actors! I did enjoy all the little nods to Freaks & Geeks and Franco-Rogen's relationship... The special effects are good, but it's not actually as horrific/gruesome as it could be - 'Shaun of the Dead' did it much better. Oh, and the ending was pretty annoying too...",7,1,2,2 January 2018
Passengers," Not quite a sci-fi classic, but good fun
","'Passengers' is an interesting sci-fi film, in that it doesn't involve aliens in any way! It has more in common with 'WALL-E', than it does with 'Alien' or 'Event Horizon', as it follows the spaceship Avalon (cool helix design, basically a giant cruise ship) on its way to Homestead II, starting a new colony 120 years from Earth. It's approximately 30min of 'Cast Away' (man trapped alone), 45min of love story and then 40min of 'Deepwater Horizon' (survival film)! No time period is given, but I assume it's ~100 years in the future.What works well is the casting - two boring people could not sustain this film, but by casting Hollywood's two best & brightest, it works wonders. Jim (Pratt) is accidentally awoken from his hibernation 90 years early and tries everything to get back to sleep and/or find a solution. Because he's a passenger and not crew, his options are limited. Eventually, Jim wakes up Aurora (Lawrence), which is handled well, and the two of them falling in love is as interesting as the shots of the galaxy outside the windows. Arthur (Sheen) as the android bartender is also a nice touch. The only other person to get some screen time near the end is Gus (Fishburne), who finally figures out what's wrong and kick-starts the final stanza.It's not hard to watch when you have Jennifer Lawrence is a pool - but as well as being extremely attractive, it helps that both her and Pratt are very charismatic and able to carry out the tender moments and the exciting ones. The shots of the ship in motion and the galaxy in the background are fantastic, and while a bit of it is predictable, it's a decent ride. Solid ending too.",7,1,3,2 January 2018
Us," Solid and interesting thriller
","'Us' is the second film from Jordan Peele, after 'Get Out', and is similarly a psychological thriller, with moments of violence thrown in. It takes a little while to set everything up and provide some backstory (& rabbits!?), but then the doppelgangers show up and the film turns into a home invasion/survival film. The main cast - Mum Adelaide ( Nyong'o), Dad Gabe (Duke), Daughter Zora (Joseph) and Son Jason (Alex) - are all great and clearly have a lot of fun playing their dual roles.Josh (Heidecker) and Kitty (Moss) also have significant supporting roles, but it really comes down to how the family of four handles their terrible situation. No spoilers, but Peele does well with building tension, using a creepy girls-choir score, colour motifs and flashbacks. It's not a typical horror film, but it certainly has scary moments.There's an almost Shyamalan-like twist at the end, but the whole thing's probably 15min too long and runs out of steam a bit. There's a lot of how/why questions left unanswered, but it's still fun and smart enough, without being exceptional.",7,2,5,30 March 2019
Knives Out," Fun and well-executed mystery
","'Knives Out' is a mostly-light-hearted timeless ensemble 'whodunnit?' Essentially, Blanc (Craig), Elliott (Stanfield) and Wagner (Segan) are investigating the death of the patriarch of the Thrombey family, Harlan (Plummer). Thankfully, there's plenty of flashbacks in the first hour, so Plummer does get some screen time. We then meet the extended family and start to unravel various potential motives and inconsistencies in their stories.The cast is huge and all solid - Marta (de Armas) as Harlan's nurse, Linda (Lee Curtis) and Walt (Shannon) as Harlan's children; Richard (Johnson), Joni (Collette) and Donna (Lindhome) as their partners; Randsom (Evans), Meg (Langford) and Jacob (Martell) as Harlan's grandchildren. I think that the main 12 characters - needless to say, not everyone gets enough time to shine, as the focus is on Blanc and Marta trying to piece everything together.This is Johnson's first film since 'The Last Jedi' and it's very assured - excellent set design and cinematography, with a simple score. The hose is literally a life-size Cluedo game. The film drags a tiny bit in the 2nd act, but comes home strong. There's plenty of fun had by the cast and Craig clearly relishes the non-Bond role - even if his Southern accent gets annoying at times! Satisfying ending - nothing revolutionary, but enjoyable. I think we'll be seeing more of Ana de Armas in the future.",7,10,26,24 November 2019
Spotlight," Extremely well done - probably wins Best Picture Oscar
","'Spotlight' and 'The Big Short' will forever be linked, which speaks to their quality - both based on true stories that effected lots of people, both great dramas, both Oscar-nominated films out within weeks of each other. 'Spotlight' has some laughs, but not as many as 'The Big Short', mostly due to the dark nature of the material - the uncovering of Catholic priests molesting and raping young children, for over four decades.The Boston Globe investigative journalism team ('Spotlight') - from when newspapers were still relevant, in 2001 - consisting of Mike (Ruffalo), Sacha (McAdams), Matt (d'Arcy James) and their editor, Robby (Keaton) are tasked with finding out if an accused priest is in fact guilty of child molestation. This comes about when their bosses, Marty (Schreiber, still looking like Sabretooth) - new at the newspaper - & Ben (Slattery) try to shake things up when they smell a cover up. It turns out there's far more than one priest and one victim - some of the true stories told by the victims as the reporters uncover the facts are truly horrendous and gut-wrenching. Definitely not easy to hear, as you know it has happened in real life, and probably hundreds of thousands of times over the last century.How Ruffalo is only up for Best Supporting Actor, and not Best Actor, is past me! McAdams, on the other hand, is not that utilised - both due to the ensemble cast, I guess. Keaton and Schreiber are good, as is Tucci as the crusading small-time lawyer, but Ruffalo really steals the show, with his heart on the line and it shows in his performance. It's really a great film about newspaper reporting, but is told so well and deals with such an important topic that it is actually enjoyable to watch everyone excel - including director McCarthy, who already has form with 'Win Win'. Certainly not 'fun', but a great film.",8,0,0,2 January 2018
Aquaman," Fun and not-too-serious - good superhero film.
","'Aquaman' is almost the best DC film since the Dark Knight trilogy - it's certainly more fun, colourful and enjoyable than 'Justice League', 'Batman v Superman' and 'Man of Steel'. 'Wonder Woman' is still the benchmark, but only just. The film works well as both an origin story and a coming-of-age story. Arthur (Momoa) is the offspring of Tom (Morrison), a lighthouse keeper, and exiled Queen of Atlantis, Atlanna (Kidman), making him half-man, half-Atlantean and the heir to the underwater kingdom of Atlantis.We see Arthur trained by Vulko (Dafoe) in flashbacks and helped in the present by Mera (Heard). To stop his step-brother Orm (Wilson) from starting a war with the 'surface dwellers', Arthur has to embark on a journey to track down an ancient trident that will make him King of Atlantis and unite the two realms. There's enough tongue-in-cheek-ness and charm from Momoa to help you past some of the daft moments - Manta's suit (overall a weak villain), octopus drums, plesiosaurs, underwater fire and giant seahorses.It's not too long (just over 2 hours) and is fast-paced and much of the story makes it feel like a cross between 'Indiana Jones' and 'Lord of the Rings', with many of the underwater colours reminiscent of 'Avatar' - none of which are bad things. The battle at the end is all a bit absurd, but there's so much colour, action and humour to make it worthwhile. Wish all DC films were as joyful as this!",7,0,1,26 December 2018
Deadpool 2," More fun, fights & comic book jests
","'Deadpool 2' comes only two years after the original and has just as many wisecracks, deaths, action scenes, pop-culture jokes and swear words as the first. Deadpool/Wade (Reynolds) is back as the 'merc with a mouth' and the film kicks plenty of action as he takes down a syndicate, but also sets up the plot with something he has to atone for - and why he wants to try to save Russell (Dennison). Also, the Bond-rip off titles are excellent.The support cast is excellent, with Vanessa (Baccarin), Dopinder (Soni), Colossus (Kapicic), Negasonic (Hildebrand), Weasel (Miller) and Blind Al (Uggams) all back. The additions of X-Force are pretty hilarious - especially Peter (Delaney) - but Domino (Beetz) steals the show, with her 'lucky' superpower. There's some great cameos, which I won't spoil, but they all bring laughs of recognition. Cable (Brolin) is a great tough guy, who's motivations are slowly revealed, but not in any great detail. While still a very fun film with plenty of laughs throughout, sometimes it's hard to keep up, since the pace is unrelenting. There does also seem to be a bit more darkness underneath (which is also poked fun at) which is why it maybe doesn't quite reach the heights of the first film. It's probably slightly too long & tries to fit a bit too much in. Stay for the credits scenes - some excellent call-backs/'alterations'!",7,1,3,17 May 2018
Thor: Ragnarok," Fun, fast and mostly light-hearted
","'Thor: Ragnarok' is the best 'Thor' film so far, and one of Marvel's best overall - up there with 'Guardians of the Galaxy' for laughter and excitement. Thor (Hemsworth) has full licence from director Waititi ('Boy', 'Hunt For The Wilderpeople') to unleash all his humour and charm, which starts very early on, but still allowing big action/battle scenes to unfurl. Loki (Hiddleston) & Odin (Hopkins) are back, but so is their sister, Hela (Blanchett), Goddess of Death, intent on unleashing 'Ragnarok' on Asgard - the end of days.It's not all doom and gloom though, as Thor and Loki get trapped on a literal dump-planet, where we meet the Grandmaster (Goldblum) - basically an eccentric Roman emperor, who hosts Gladiator duels. Goldblum gets some great lines and steals almost every scene he's in. This is where Hulk (Ruffalo) comes in and is apparently where he's been since 'Avengers: Age of Ultron'. Some great moments shared between Hulk and Thor, as Thor is trying to escape so he can rescue the people of Asgard from Hela. He's helped by a fallen Valkyrie (Thompson), who eventually comes around.The score is great, and while 80s-synth-ish, is mostly understated. What does stand out is the colour and vibrancy of almost every set - plenty to catch the eye in every shot. But what sets this film apart is it's humour and pacing. Korg, a rock-monster (voiced by Waititi himself) has some great moments, especially since his Kiwi accent stands out so strongly against the rest of the cast. There's a strong Antipodean slant to proceedings, with Waititi, Hemsworth, Blanchett, Karl Urban, Rachel House and Sam Neill all having an impact. A great fight scene at the end, but still plenty of quips and slapstick thrown in. End credit scene sets up 'Avengers: Infinity War' nicely.",8,2,4,2 January 2018
Ready Player One," Fun, but missing a bit of heart
","'Ready Player One' is based on the 2011 book by Ernest Cline (he co-writes the screenplay here), and as with all novel-to-film adaptions, the movie's not quite as good. Ironically, it feels like there's more action in the book! That being said, this is still a Spielberg sci-fi epic, with plenty to see and experience. It's a conglomeration of 'The Matrix' and 'Avatar', with people in 2045 essentially living their lives in a virtual reality world (the 'Oasis'), created by Halliday (Rylance) & Morrow (Pegg).Wade (Sheridan) is the unlikely hero, trying to win the 'game', which is a mix of 80s/90s video games and other TV/film references/characters - you could spend the whole movie glimpsing/placing cool things: 'Back To The Future', Gundam, Halo, Ninja Turtles, Iron Giant, Tron, etc. This is fun, but often makes it feel like quantity over quality. Has some good songs, but I would've liked more. Helping Wade against the evil Sixers/IOI, led by Sorrento (Mendelsohn) is Artemis (Cooke) and Aech (Waithe) - with Sho (Zhao) and Daito (Morisaki) thrown in near the end for good measure. There's not much character development and it's hard to care too much when they spend most of their time as cartoonish avatars in the Oasis.Plenty can be inferred from this bleak future, where everyone is disconnected from reality and humanity, instead spending all their time online - pros and cons both ways. The ending is satisfactory, but I feel like we needed more time in the real world, especially with the secondary characters, especially Pegg and TJ Miller. It does differ from the book in a few areas, but it is great to see a lot of it realised on the big screen - the battle at the end is quite spectacular and the car races suitably chaotic. It's good, without being exceptional.",7,2,7,29 March 2018
The Hateful Eight," A little long and overwrought, but still a good Western/'whodunit'
","Much like 'Spotlight' and 'The Big Short' will be linked, 'The Hateful Eight' and 'The Revenant' will be linked in my mind, due to the fact that they're both set in 19th century wintry American Northwest (this time Wyoming), both nominated for Oscars (although 3 vs 12, with the only overlap being cinematography - probably have to go to 'The Revenant' instead) and both released in January. And while they're similar - and both pretty good - neither is definitely better than the other, and neither is quite as great as it could have been.This is, obviously, Tarantino's 8th film, but it annoyed me that for the majority of the film, there's nine people trapped in the cabin, even though the posters and title refer to the eight of them! O.B. (Parks - 4th Tarantino film), the stagecoach driver, doesn't rate a mention? He has some of the funniest moments in the film! Only Tarantino can have a film starring 'eight' characters and end up with 14 bodies, with some characters still alive at the end! The eight main characters are:
 - Marquis Warren (Jackson - 6th Tarantino film), former Yankee Major, now bounty hunter;
 - John Ruth (Russell - 2nd Tarantino film), a bounty hunter with a great moustache;
 - Daisy Domergue (Jason Leigh - 1st Tarantino film), Ruth's bounty he's taking to hang;
 - Chris Mannix (Goggins - 2nd Tarantino film), the new Sheriff of Red Rock;
 - Oswaldo Mobray (Roth - 3rd Tarantino film), a British hangman;
 - Senor Bob (Bichir - 1st Tarantino film), the Mexican innkeeper;
 - Joe Gage (Madsen - 3rd Tarantino film), a raspy-voiced loner cowboy; and
 - Sandy Smithers (Dern - 2nd Tarantino film), former Confederate General.Feels a little like Tarantino started with a joke: 'a black war hero, a Mexican, an Englishman, a Kiwi and a racist walk into a bar...' and went from there! Once all eight are trapped in Minnie's Haberdashery due to the blizzard, the mystery of who's who - and where Minnie is - is slowly uncovered, with trust in short supply. Starts very slow - particularly the titles, with Tarantino using his classic colouring and sound to show everyone involved in the film before it can properly start. It's long (2 hours 45min), but not ridiculously so - however, you could probably take out 30min from the start/middle and have a better-paced film. Morricone's score is good, and the cinematography looks great when they're out in the mountains and snow, but over 75% of the film is shot inside the cabin, where it's dark!Takes a while to really get going, but once it does, there's plenty of blood (hence the R-rating), as the truth is uncovered. Jackson is great and the main star, while Russell does a fantastic John Wayne impersonation - his voice cadence and over-bearing attitude are spot on - and Jason Leigh is fun to watch as the vile and racist criminal. The real stand-out, though, is Goggins as the seemingly inept Sheriff - he plays his part with clear relish and gets a few laughs and gets to show some heart underneath his racist exterior. While 'The Hateful Eight' is very enjoyable in parts, I didn't enjoy it anywhere as much as 'Django Unchained' or 'Inglorious Basterds'.",7,0,1,2 January 2018
Moana," Great looking and sounding ocean adventure
","'Moana' is a near-flawless family film from Disney. It's got pretty much everything: comedy (mostly from a chicken!), pathos, a good journey with some adversity to overcome, some self-discovery, a great sidekick, some songs, the death of a loved one (the Grandma (House)) and heaps of great animation/scenery.The Chief (Morrison/Jango Fett), doesn't want Moana (Cravalho) to leave their Pacific island, for fear of the big ocean, but she has to follow her destiny and find Maui (Johnson) to restore the heart of Te Fiti and restore balance to the islands. Maui obviously starts out as a bit of a jerk, but he endears himself to us with his well-meaning ways and hilarious moving-tattoos. The lava monster's cool, but not too scary - definitely OK for kids over 3.It's great to see/hear Polynesian actors, songs (particularly the tribal drums) and ancestral art/tattoos. There's a great voice cast - the Grandma is touching - and Clement (Flight of the Conchords) is hilarious as the giant/evil crab. However, it's Moana's film and she's charismatic, feisty and respectful, depending on the situation (helps that they chose a 14-year-old Hawaiian to play her!). She probably sings a few too many songs for me (think there's about seven in the film), and they definitely could've done without The Rock's song! It all ends happily, with her people voyaging again.",8,1,2,2 January 2018
Spider-Man: Homecoming," Worthwhile reboot - fun, exciting and different enough
","'Spider-Man: Homecoming' (or Spider-Man 6, technically) is Sony and Marvel finally playing nice and bringing Marvel's most popular comic book character into the MCU - will be interesting to see how he's involved in the upcoming Infinity War. A lot of people will ask 'do we need another Spider-Man film?' The answer is, clearly 'yes'! This is just as good as each of the other first Spider-Man films, and is different in that it's not an 'origin story' - there's no Uncle Ben - and we've already seen Peter Parker (Holland) with his powers in 'Captain America: Civil War', so the film starts with a lot of momentum, where Peter's trying to impress Iron Man (Downey Jr.). Also, excellent use of the Ramones!This is the most age-appropriate Spider-Man so far - Tobey Maguire was 26 when 'Spider-Man' came out in 2002, Andrew Garfield was 29 when 'The Amazing Spider-Man' came out in 2012 and Tom Holland has just turned 21 - which lends a fair bit of authenticity to Peter being a high school kid with teenage problems. There is an actual homecoming dance, so plenty of teenage awkwardness, but it's all very watchable, due to Holland's charm and enthusiasm. He's helped by his best friend Ned (Batalon), who gets a lot of great lines and there's other comedic relief from the coach (Buress), the debate team teacher (Starr) and, surprisingly, the PSA's from Captain America (Evans)! The plot is all about stopping the Vulture (Keaton), who's constantly stealing alien technology left over from Avengers battles. His wing-suit is pretty great to watch and he makes for a suitable villain.The film differs a bit from the comics, with no (thankfully, at this stage!) Norman or Harry Osborn, Mary-Jane Watson, or Gwen Stacy. However, there is Flash Thompson (Revolori) and Aunt May (Tomei), as well as Tony Stark, Pepper Potts (Paltrow) and Happy Hogan (Favreau) - and a multitude of references to other MCU happenings - to link it all together. Peter's suit was cool, but probably a bit too Iron Man-ish for my liking. Still, it's great to see Spider-Man still learning his powers (especially trying to web-sling through suburban backyards with no skyscrapers) and there's plenty of great action scenes. It's not quite the best of the Spider-Man films - a little long and sometimes a bit listless - but it has a satisfying ending and a lead actor who I hope to see play Spider-Man for quite a few films to come.",8,0,1,2 January 2018
Suicide Squad," Not a bad comic book movie
","'Suicide Squad' is on par with 'Batman v Superman' (if you didn't mind that, you won't mind this and if you hated that, you probably won't like this either) and the film acts as its sequel and a stop-gap until 'Justice League' comes out next year. It's also DC trying to compete with Marvel's 'Deadpool' which was MA and about an antihero who kills people - although this is only rated M. Still, a few people are killed and there's plenty of violence, but it probably has more in common with 'Ghostbusters' than 'Deadpool'.The film does a great job of introducing the characters in the first 20min, with everyone getting their own song and 'profile', and each of them gets a bit of backstory as the film progresses - Deadshot (Smith, an assassin), Harley Quinn (Robbie, Joker's girlfriend, in those amazing 'pants'), Joker (Leto, with his metal teeth making him sound a little like Ledger), Boomerang (Courtney, doing his best Tom Hardy in 'The Revenant' impression), Diablo (Hernandez, pretty much Human Torch), Killer Croc (Akinnuoye-Agbaje) and Enchantress (Delevingene, a witch). There should've been more of how Batman (Affleck) put them all in prison, but he only gets 2min screentime, and the Joker not much more - obviously setting up a Joker v Batman film somewhere down the line. Waller (Davis) is the true villain and she manipulates well to get this 'team' together and 'controlled' by Flag (Kinnaman) to go on a rescue mission, that soon turns into a suicide mission.The main issue is the 'ultimate' bad guy is one of them - Enchantress. She creates a swirling vortex-thing that we've seen a million times and they have to stop her. The problem is the same for all superhero films - why not call in the rest of the heroes? In this case, where are Batman, Wonder Woman and The Flash? The tone is sometimes light and funny, but then gloomy and 'we're still the bad guys and are still probably going to die' the next. It doesn't ruin the film, but sometimes makes it hard to read. The soundtrack is great throughout and often keeps the tone fun. The action and fight scenes are done well, but the film probably outstays it's welcome by 10min. No one, even Smith, hogs too much screentime and it definitely doesn't always work, but is a mostly fun ride.",7,0,0,2 January 2018
Captain America: The Winter Soldier," An excellent action/Superhero film. It's fun, but also serious and engaging enough to make I interesting for the entire runtime, with some great action sequences
","This was so much better than I was expecting! Sure, I liked the first Captain America film, but in reality, he's not Marvel's strongest character - just their version of Superman, but he CAN die from a bullet. However, they were smart with this one, bringing in a strong cast to back Cap up - with familiar faces Black Widow (Johansson), Nick Fury (Jackson), Maria Hill (Smulders), Jasper Sitwell (Hernández) and Senator Stern (Shandling) all in at least one of the other films or the TV show - plus Falcon (Mackie) and Senator Pierce (Redford) as the new additions. The biggest mystery - if you haven't read the comics - is who the Winter Soldier is, and it does a pretty good job of the reveal (no spoilers here!). The whole film flows on nicely from the 'The First Avenger' and 'The Avengers'.I was really happy with the pacing - it does a great job of reintroducing the familiar characters and bringing in the new ones and then there's plenty of action and great set-pieces - most on a scale I didn't believe Captain America could/would accommodate. And there's plenty of humour too, even when the characters are in dire straits. It also works well for the first 90min or so as a pretty great mystery, with plenty of curve-balls and 'did that really happen?' moments. This is really fun to watch, as you get to see more of Steve Rogers as a character, rather than Captain America, the warrior. It's also nice to see Cap and Black Widow spending time together not fighting enemies - although I'm biased, because I would watch Scarlett Johansson in anything! But the best parts are still the action sequences - they've given Cap some great moves and it's just plain fun to watch him and how they've filmed it.The Stan Lee cameo/one-liner is great and links in nicely with an earlier scene and Danny Pudi from Community even gets a pretty funny scene. It's also nice to see Fury play a more pivotal role, rather than one or two small scenes. The plot gets a little absurd near the end, but it gives Cap, Black Window and Falcon a mission and sets up a huge battle in the final 20min. There's sure to be some repercussions from the events of this film. And we only have to wait two years until the next Captain America film, which is a good thing, seeing how well made this one was. As always, stay until after the end titles for a very revealing scene!",9,0,0,2 January 2018
Doctor Strange," Good entry into unknown territory for Marvel
","'Doctor Strange' is the 13th (14th? 15th? Even I'm losing count!) Marvel film, and continues the trend of 'Guardians of the Galaxy', 'Ant-Man' and 'Deadpool' - not the most well-known comic book characters, but they've given chance to breathe and create their own energy separate to the Avengers, and are more fun because of it. Simple premise here - Dr Stephen Strange (Cumberbatch) is a famous, conceited, surgeon who has a car accident and can no longer fully use his hands. In search of radical treatments, he visits Nepal and encounters Mordo (Ejiofor) and The Ancient One (Swinton).He - like us - has to surrender everything he thinks he knows and enter the world of mysticism, spells and magic. There's some funny scenes and remarks as he comes to grips with these new possibilities in the world. The film is actually funnier than I thought it was going to be, since Dr Strange is no Spider-Man or Deadpool in terms of quips, but it's handled well. The director, Derrickson, is coming off a patchy output at best - 'Deliver Us From Evil', 'Sinister', 'The Day The Earth Stood Still' - but does a decent job of keeping the pace up and not having too long between scenes with action. Some of the 'city/room-bending' scenes are great to watch.While the tone is sometimes dark and 'we're all just a speck in this world, which is only part of one universe, let alone the multiverse', it's generally upbeat and handled more with awe and fun than seriousness and fanaticism. Christine (McAdams) serves as the real-world foil and Kaecilius (Mikkelsen) is an adequate bad-guy. Cumberbatch carries the film and is a douche when needed, and a strong presence at other times. The end-credits scene has a nice quick Thor appearance. I look forward to seeing more of Dr Strange in the Marvel Cinematic Universe.",7,1,1,2 January 2018
Interstellar," A good sci-fi drama, but needed more action and adventure!
","'Interstellar' was a film I'd been waiting to see all year, and it certainly is a huge sci-fi film - $165 million budget - from one of the best filmmakers going round. Basically, we spend 40min on Earth in the not-too-distant-future, where all the crops are failing and Homo sapiens are about to be wiped from the planet. Cooper (McConaughey), Romilly (Gyasi) & Dr Brand (Hathaway) are then sent to another galaxy - via a wormhole - as a last grasp attempt to find another habitable planet.The film does really well of asking those big picture themes - what's more important, family of the entire species, love or exploration, why do we matter? However, as a sci-fi/action film, it sometimes lets itself down - the characters aren't that well developed, beside Cooper & his two kids (Chastain & Affleck when they're older) and there's too much maths/physics/relativity and not enough excitement and wonder.Sure, the special effects you do get to see of the black hole and the planets they visit are great, but there's just not enough of them - it's a lot of them in a space suit/ship with an overbearing Hans Zimmer's score making it hard to hear actual dialogue. It's probably slightly longer than necessary also - 2 hours 50min, with the last 30min being a less-than-ideal conclusion to the film. Hopefully Damon playing an astronaut prepares him for next year's 'The Martian', which should be more exciting than 'Interstellar'.Nolan - who will arguably one day go down as a directorial legend like Kubrick - owes a lot to '2001: A Space Odyssey' and essentially 'Interstellar' doesn't do anything better than that film 46 years ago. But it's not all bad - I think my expectations were too high, especially after 'Gravity' last year - with Caine & Lithgow being solid on Earth and the robots, TARS & CASE (very similar voices/roles to HAL in '2001' & GERTY in 'Moon') providing some humour (and a very unique form/function!).",7,1,1,2 January 2018
"Three Billboards Outside Ebbing, Missouri"," Part funny, part bleak, all quite well done.
","'Three Billboards Outside Ebbing, Missouri' is the third film from writer/director McDonagh (of 'In Bruges' & 'Seven Psychopaths' fame), and continues his themes of taking something quite bleak/violent (in this case the murder of a woman's daughter) and building situations with characters around it that can still be funny. Mildred (McDormand) is the focus here, and she rents three billboards from Red (Landry Jones) to call out the police for not finding her daughter's murderer, so Chief Willoughby (Harrelson) is put in a tight spot.Dixon (Rockwell) is one of his cops and has a great part as the dimwitted, slightly-bigoted younger cop. McDormand is exceptional as the ultra-focused and hard-nosed grieving mother, with a few layers. Harrelson is also good, but Cornish as his wife has the weirdest Australian/Southern accent mash-up I've ever heard! And the age-gap there is hard to comprehend... The only shame is Dinklage doesn't get more screen time, but still good seeing him.It's odd that it was all filmed in North Carolina, not Missouri, as there's some beautiful scenery shots that definitely don't look like St Louis! Also worth noting that Ebbing's not a real place. The mystery and investigation is handled quite well and realistically, but the attention here is on anger - misplaced or otherwise - and how it can consume people and create a destructive cycle. Not the best use of music and not quite a perfect ending, but a very solid film.",7,1,3,1 January 2018
Star Wars: Episode IX - The Rise of Skywalker," Fitting finale that holds true to the Star Wars ethos
","'Star Wars: The Rise of Skywalker' (Episode IX) is the final piece of the trilogy of trilogies that comprise the Star Wars film phenomenon. It's hard to sum up the film objectively, as there's so much history, emotion and identity associated with the films - I can only imagine what it's like for people who saw the original trilogy in cinemas. I doubt this is the last time we'll see the opening title crawl & trumpets, but it will be the end of the Skywalker saga. It's a massive shame Carrie Fisher didn't film all her scenes before she passed away, but Leia still has an important role in the filmSimilar to the last two films, the plot centres on Rey (Ridley), Poe (Isaac) and Finn (Boyega) as they try to stop Kylo Ren (Driver) and the First Order. I don't think it's a surprise to say the Emperor (McDiarmid) is back in this film - via cloning and the Dark Side - adding to the direness of the Resistance's situation, as they have to fight more than they bargained for. There's plenty of cameos from old hands and new, and a small but suitable role for Luke (Hamill) one last time. The glue holding the story together is the interactions between Rey & Kylo, their ability to communicate even when not in the same place and whether Kylo will return to the light or if Rey will fall to the dark.The overall palette is dark & foreboding, with the Unknown Regions planet the Emperor is on being the setting for the third act, with plenty of clouds, stone and lighting. But, as ever in Star Wars, hope is never lost, so long as they stick together and help one another. Plenty of nice moments throughout - I almost cried at a moment with Chewie - and the film does well to tie up 42 years of shared film history. It's by no means the best film, but is certainly not the worst of the series. Will see how it ages as a ending over the next 30 years before comparing it to 'Return of the Jedi'!",8,4,25,19 December 2019
Lion," Excellent tale of hope and determination
","'Lion' (the reason behind the title is revealed at the end) is an amazing journey - and a true story too! Simple premise - Saroo (Pawar - one cute kid!) helps his brother, Guddu (Bharate), little sister Shekila (Solanki) and mother (Bose) to survive in the Indian poverty, when one day his brother accidentally loses him on a train station. Being only five, after travelling for two days, Saroo can't pronounce his home town correctly, so he ends up in a juvenile prison, along with thousands of other lost kids. The time spent (45min) with young Saroo builds his character and back story nicely, and displays the vibrant and bustling India.Saroo is adopted by Sue (Kidman) & John (Wenham - needed a bit more to do) and given a great life in Hobart. They also adopt Mantosh (Ladwa) - Saroo (now Patel) grows up well-adjusted, Mantosh not so much. Saroo meets Lucy (Mara) at university in Melbourne and they fall in love. He then finally decides to search for his mother, brother and sister, which is a tough ask across the billion-plus people in India and the fact he doesn't know what region he's from.The pacing is good - doesn't feel like a two-hour film - and I would rate this on the same level as 'Slumdog Millionaire': they both have some similarities, but quite a few differences, with Patel's charisma shining through and helping him to carry the film. The support cast is good, but he has to display the most emotion and the ending in India is beautiful. Decent score, great Indian and Tasmanian settings and a great story.",8,0,0,2 January 2018
Ant-Man," Light and easy fun and action
","Another month, another Marvel film! (Well, it's actually been two months since 'Avengers: Age of Ultron'). And although it may make me sound like a fanboy, I'm still not sick of them - especially when they're still as fun as 'Ant-Man'! Definitely not one of the bigger superheroes (no pun intended), but Ant-Man and Wasp were original Avengers in the 1960's comics and have always been integral to the Marvel universe. The film does well by including the original Ant-Man, Hank Pym (Douglas, holding up well for a 70-year-old) and tying him in with S.H.I.E.L.D. and Howard Stark, as well as showing some of the Wasp. The film also sets up Ant-Man's involvement in future 'Avengers'/'Captain America' films by having the Falcon (Mackie) involved too.Brought to you by the director of 'Bring It On' & 'The Break-Up', it's surprising it's not a weak rom-com! Reed does an OK job, but it's hard not to imagine what Edgar Wright, the original director (he still gets a writing credit) - famous for 'Shaun of the Dead' & 'Scott Pilgrim vs the World' - would have done with it. That's not to say it lacks imagination or humour - as shown by the tank and the Thomas the Tank Engine scenes - but just that it at times feels a little pedestrian. I guess the PG (and not M) rating also contributes to this.The story is pretty simple, as is fitting a non-super-powered/non-Mutant hero - Scott Lang (Rudd) is a burglar (not a 'robber'!) who is trying to do right so he can be in his daughters' life again. Luckily, Pym and his daughter, Hope (Lilly) come along and give him the opportunity to wear the Ant-Man suit, which has the ability to shrink, thanks to the 'Pym Particle'. The film is fast and fun, with Rudd a great choice for the lead role, with his charm and humour (helped by one of the writers being Adam McKay, best known for 'Step Brothers' & 'Anchorman'). There's some 'seriousness' with Cross (Stoll) as the villain, but it is all very fast-paced and the stakes never seem too high. This won't be anyone's favourite Marvel movie, but it's certainly not a bad one either.",7,0,0,2 January 2018
Nightcrawler," A good, dramatic film, even if not entirely enjoyable to watch
","'Nightcrawler' is unfortunately not a standalone film of the X-Men's cheeky elf character, but rather a dark exposition of modern news and the public's (apparent) bloodlust. The film has a simple premise - Bloom (Gyllenhaal) and his partner, Rick (Ahmed) listen to the police scanner and try to show up at accidents to film the gory aftermath before the cops can stop them or before they're beaten to the scene by other competitors. They're literally trawling the night for news-worthy footage. That this 'needs' to be 'bloody', as Bloom clarifies with Nina (Russo) at the news station is either an indictment on TV news stations/shows, or the public in general - or possibly a bit of both.Gyllenhaal is very captivating as the main star, being in basically every scene and using his huge eyes - and gross mini-ponytail - to creep you out. You don't hate him, but start to fully comprehend what a psychopath he is as the film progresses. Sure, he doesn't kill anyone himself, but he certainly does some despicable things and has no remorse and you start to truly despise him - which proves how good he's acting!Ahmed, Russo & Paxton are good in small, but significant roles. The soundtrack is solid and the cinematography of Los Angeles make sit actually look hospitable and attractive for a change - not as gritty as I would've expected in a movie of this tone. Good ending to the film, if a disappointing one to watch.",7,1,1,2 January 2018
Bohemian Rhapsody," Excellent if you like Queen, still great even if you somehow don't.
","'Bohemian Rhapsody' is the story of Queen, one of England - and the world's - greatest ever rock bands. More specifically, the film focuses predominantly on Freddie Mercury (Malek)'s life, genius and struggles. It must be said that Malek, his mannerisms and fake teeth are exceptionally close to the real-life Freddie.The film is helped by not being 100% about their music, albums and touring, but also not spending excessive time with Freddie's personal life. The other Queen members get their fair share of screen time - guitarist Brian May (Lee, uncannily similar), drummer Roger Taylor (Hardy) and bass player John Deacon (Mazello) - and have lots of good moments. Mary (Boynton) plays a key figure, being Freddie's wife early on.The film does delve into some of the trappings of celebrity that Freddie fell into, but does showcase Queen's music superbly - the making of Bohemian Rhapsody, Another One Bites The Dust and We Will Rock You is fun and insightful. The climax of the film is Freddie seeing his parents and then an almost note-for-note replica of Queen's Live Aid performance at Wembley Stadium and it's superb.",8,3,5,2 November 2018
Baby Driver," Excellent heist/action film
","Edgar Wright's first film that hasn't been styled as a comedy (and his first since 'The World's End'), 'Baby Driver' is a fast-paced crime caper, with plenty of car chases, action, gun fights and a great soundtrack. There's almost no score - basically every scene is set to a song, starting with the first robbery (Jon Spencer Blues Explosion), 'Tequila', T. Rex, The Damned, 'Easy' and Baby (Elgort)'s own mixes. Music is so important to him, as he has tinnitus and uses an iPod to drown it out - and help him focus on his getaway driving.Baby is helping criminals get away with robberies to pay back crime boss Doc (Spacey - always good), and the first crew is Buddy (Hamm - great as the criminal with an almost-conscience), Darling (Gonzalez - mostly just eye candy) and Griff (Bernthal - gruff). Then he falls in love with Debora (James - cute), a waiter at an Atlanta diner and needs to extricate himself from this shady world. This is made harder when Bats (Foxx - crazy) gets involved and doesn't like Baby always wearing earplugs.The car chases are filmed/edited magnificently, with the music adding urgency and tone where needed. Nowhere is this more evident than the final scene, with Queen's 'Brighton Rock' (one of their less famous songs) seamlessly complementing the visual. The stakes are high for the final 30min and the ending is appropriate and not corny. There's plenty of style, but also substance, here.",8,1,3,2 January 2018
Justice League," Not bad, not great, but a decent platform
","'Justice League' is the 5th film in the DC Extended Universe and, after 'Wonder Woman', is their best attempt to compete with Marvel - even going as far as bringing in 'The Avengers' director, Joss Whedon, to write the screenplay. The director, Snyder (who also directed 'Man of Steel' and 'Batman V Superman') is only given a 'story by' credit. If you haven't seen any of those three films, I suggest you do, as this film starts with Clark/Superman (Cavill) already dead and Batman/Bruce (Affleck) and Wonder Woman/Diana (Godot) pulling together a super-team to fight off some impending doom.There's the obligatory hour of introductions to each of the five main characters: Arthur/Aquaman (Momoa), Victor/Cyborg (Fisher), Barry/Flash (Miller, the best new character) - plus more screen time for Lois Lane (Adams), Martha Kent (Lane), Commissioner Gordon (Simmons) and Alfred (Irons), who are all kind of wasted. The plot is that they have to fight off an alien bent on destroying Earth, with his army of zombie-grasshoppers - directly ripped off from 'Star Wars: Attack of the Clones'. It's an odd choice, since this should technically be aimed at kids, but I'm not sure if I'd let anyone younger than 10 watch this...But that's part of the problem with the DCEU so far - it's still trying to be dark and unforgiving, attempting to reach Nolan's Batman trilogy, but not hitting any of the marks. Something's just missing that doesn't hold it all together as well as a Marvel film. And, odd as it may sound, there's probably too much CGI here. Not a spoiler: obviously Superman comes back and helps save the day, but it begs the question - isn't everyone a bit suspicious that Clark Kent is now somehow walking around? There's some decent quips and a few funny moments, mostly thanks to Flash and some OK battle scenes. Plenty of enjoyable moments, but not quite a fully-formed faction film.",7,1,1,2 January 2018
The Revenant," Very good film, but not quite great
","'The Revenant' (noun: 'a person who has returned, supposedly from the dead') is a film about a man left for dead, Glass (DiCaprio), and his lust for revenge keeping him alive in the wilderness. Set in the 1820s, in what was then the Wild West of Montana (but filmed mostly in Alberta, Canada), Captain Henry (Gleeson) and his men, including Glass, his son Hawk (Goodluck), Fitzgerald (Hardy) and Bridger (Poulter) are collecting pelts (I assume deer?) when attacked by Native Americans, setting them on a desperate journey back to 'civilisation'.Obviously, plenty goes wrong, including Glass being attacked by a Grizzly Bear, which even though it's CGI, is an amazing/horrifying thing to watch! He survives, but is left for dead and thus begins his improbable survival tale for vengeance. There was a few things I didn't like that much, including the score (too piercing at times), the length (over two & a half hours, and it meanders for about 40min in the middle) and some of the repetitiveness (always seem to be sitting around a fire!) and unnecessary flash-backs/visions.However, the cinematography is absolutely superb - hopefully more films are made in Canada after this! - and Leo is solid, with his shaggy hair and crazed stare on display. Hardy is great and completely unrecognisable as Mad Max, while Poulter provides the film's conscience. For mine, it's a better film than 'Birdman', but although it strives for it, it's still not an exceptional film. The ending leaves you, like Glass, exhausted and questioning everything.",7,0,0,2 January 2018
Bridge of Spies," Really well made Cold War true story
","'Bridge of Spies' is an espionage thriller at its finest. It's set in the late 50s & early 60s and certainly looks the part - I always love seeing the old cars driving around New York, looking classy. Starts off like any classic spy film, but then Abel (Rylance) is caught. In comes Donovan (Hanks), an insurance lawyer who is asked to defend Abel, so he can receive due legal practice. The first 45min or so is a good courtroom drama and moves along fast enough, with Hanks giving a few great speeches and making some solid points about what's right and what's best.The movie really captures well the Cold War tension in America and what families would've gone through. It helps that this is the best film Spielberg has made in a few years and the best film Hanks has been in for a while. Once the movie turns into political chess, with an exchange of Abel for Powers (Stowell) in Berlin, the stakes are raised and there's plenty of great subterfuge.Hanks basically owns the film, with everyone having some good moments (especially Rylance, with his 'would it help?'s), but he really plays a great everyman who stands up to both Germany, Russia & his own country (mostly portrayed by the CIA/Shepherd) for what is morally right and just, not just what is politically acceptable at the current time.",8,1,2,2 January 2018
Split," Well-made creepy thriller
","'Split' refers to James McAvoy's split personalities - or dissociative identity disorder (DID) - of which he has 23. He plays Barry, Hedwig, Kevin, Dennis, Patricia and a few others you get to see. The film wastes no time, with him abducting Casey (Taylor-Joy), Claire (Richardson) and Marcia (Sula) and they all wake up in a strange room. You're then introduced to a few of his personalities - Dennis is mostly in charge - and they're not all malevolent.He also visits Dr Fletcher (Buckley), who genuinely tries to help him and slowly figures out it's not Barry she's been talking to, but Dennis. The girls try to escape, but are thwarted, as it becomes a race against time before 'the beast' arrives. This ominous arrival drives the momentum and plot. It's a little slow in parts, but keeps your interest throughout.McAvoy is excellent, with his ability to change expressions, accents and mannerisms fantastic, and Taylor-Joy shows good depth too (Casey's childhood is slowly revealed to give background). The final 20min is frenetic and the ending is both scary, creepy and well-handled - except perhaps for the final minute cameo. Good to see Shyamalan back.",7,0,2,2 January 2018
Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse," A fun, different, great comic-book film
","'Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse' doesn't really fit into the MCU, but it doesn't need to - it works as a stand-alone animated film, so long as you have some knowledge of the Spider-man world. That's what this film does well - stay true to Spider-Man's character, but have multiple versions fighting to save the world. It's PG, but there's not too much violence. There is, however, plenty of multi/parallel universe/reality issues, so be prepared to try to explain that to kids!Basically, Miles (Moore) lives in a world where the Kingpin (Schreiber) kills Spider-Man while using a supercollider to try & bring his family back to life. The supercollider creates a rift in the space/time continuum, resulting in multiple Spider-people being taken from their universes - slightly-older Peter Parker (Johnson), Spider-Women/Gwen (Steinfeld), Spider-Ham (Mulaney), Spider-Man Noir (Cage) and a manga Peni Parker (Glenn). Miles has only just been bitten by a spider and is dealing with some family troubles with his Dad (Tyree Henry) and Uncle Aaron (Ali), when all this is trust upon him. It's up to him to help the original Spider-Man and all the alternate Spider-people to get them home and defeat Kingpin and Dr Octopus (Hahn).The film does a great job of bringing in familiar faces - Aunt May (Tomlin), Mary Jane (Kravitz), Gwen, Kingpin, Dr Ock, Green Goblin, Scorpion - and a very fitting final cameo from Stan Lee. All the other Spider-people are distinct and have their moments. There's some excellent animation and a nice mixture of comic-book scenes and some nice emotional moments. Great ending & I'm glad there's a female Spider-Woman and black Spider-man for kids to look up to now. Also a nice tribute to Spider-Man creators Stan Lee & Steve Ditko at the end - timely since they both passed in 2018. This film would've made them both proud.",8,1,3,14 January 2019
Dunkirk," Innovative take on the war film
","'Dunkirk' is Nolan's first war film and as such, it's not typical or predictable. There's no real introduction to the characters - we're suddenly in the middle of 400,000 Allied troops being evacuated from France back to England in the middle or World War II. It's filmed from three perspectives (which works quite well): the land, where Tommy (Whitehead) is trying to get off the beach and Bolton (Branagh) is trying to organize the retreat; the ocean, where Dawson (Rylance) & his son Peter are on a small boat; and the air, where Farrier (Hardy) & Collins (Lowden) are trying to stop the German bombers.The first thing you notice is the score - by Hans Zimmer - as each of the different viewpoints has it's own motif, but they are all very persistent and add to the tension and desperation of the soldiers to escape. It's interesting that you never actually see any German soldiers and 'Nazis' are never mentioned, just 'the enemy'. There's no real main character - perhaps Whitehead, as a young, out-of-place infantryman - but they all seem realistic and suitably distraught, just trying their best to survive and make it home. The definition of 'lose the battle, but win the war'.It's nice to see all the British civilian boats arrive across the English Channel (which looks great in most shots, obviously filmed on a rare sunny day!), with Rylance as the moral compass, and there's plenty of drama on the beach, but the plane battles are probably the highlight, having you on the edge of your seat, leaning with the pilots. It's short - 105min, so not an 'epic' - and won't be remembered as the new 'Saving Private Ryan', but it's just as good as last year's 'Hacksaw Ridge'.",8,1,2,2 January 2018
The Amazing Spider-Man," Much better than expected
","This Spider-Man reboot basically takes all the best bits of the first two films and does them right, from a funnier Peter Parker, and a better Harry Osborn & Gwen Stacy and a good Uncle Ben storyline.",9,1,1,2 January 2018
The Lego Movie," Everything is (relatively) awesome
","'The Lego Movie' is exactly what you expect, but also at the same time, something unexpected. It's a bright, fast-paced, well-intentioned kids' film, but it also has quite a few genuine laughs and touching moments - not that they're out of place, just that they add some levity to the story, which sometimes does get a little too 'meta' for it's own good.The storyline is quite straightforward - ordinary guy gets thrust into an adventure to save the Universe, defeat the bad guy (Ferrell) and find love, even though he's 'normal' - obviously, it turns out everyone's 'Special'/unique, not just those that are prominent. What makes it stand out is how they've taken something we all know & love - I doubt anyone born in the last 40 years hasn't played with Lego as a kid - and translated it to a living world. We get to see this through Emmet (Pratt)'s eyes and it's pretty funny how they integrate corporate America - coffee, music & TV shows - into this Lego world. And it's great how the Lego looks real and only animated to move facial effects - and the animated water is great. My favourite bit was seeing Ben the 'generic 80's astronaut' (Charlie Day) - and his enthusiasm for building spaceships - who even had an authentic helmet crack where the chin strap always broke! I remember building weird spaceships for him.One of my main issues is that they've gone to such great effort to animate this world, but then they fly through most of it so quickly that you don't actually get a chance to appreciate it all! Thanks to being a Warner Brothers film, we get the benefit of seeing DC characters - Wonder Woman, Superman, Green Lantern (a great sub-plot with these two!), and especially, Batman. The casting of Will Arnett as Batman is genius - his gravelly voice perfectly suited, as well as his comic timing. The ending - combining live action with the animation actually works - is pretty good and wraps everything up nicely, while also making you care for some of these characters, even if they're little yellow blocks!",7,0,0,2 January 2018
X-Men: Days of Future Past," A good effort, but I expected more from the original comic book movie franchise
","'X-Men: Days of Future Past' is the fifth X-Men film (let's not include the Wolverine movies in this count) and does a good job of linking the original trilogy (2000-2006) to the 2011 prequel, 'X-Men: First Class'. The story starts off in the not-too-distant future (i.e. a decade or so after 'X-Men: The Last Stand'), where the Sentinels have almost hunted mutant-kind - and some of human-kind - to extinction. The plus side of this is that we get to see grown-up Professor X (Stewart), Magneto (McKellen), Wolverine (Jackman), Shadow Cat (Page), Storm (Berry), Iceman (Ashmore) & Colossus (Cudmore) - plus new additions Sunspot (Canto), Bishop (Sy), Warpath (Stewart) & Blink (Fan - who? Yeah, even I don't know who Blink is - some sort of weird mix between Nightcrawler & Psylocke) - and how they're living in the Terminator 4-esque future. The solution? Send Wolverine into the past to try to stop the Sentinels from being created. (I'm not sure how Shadow Cat's phasing ability inexplicably lets her transport people to the past...)This is where - in 1973 - we're re-introduced to young Charles (McAvoy) & Eric (Fassbender). There's some good moments as they meet Wolverine for the 'first' time, including drafting in Quicksilver (Peters). I'm glad they hinted that Magneto is his father, but it's a shame the same actor won't be playing him in 'Avengers: Age of Ultron'. We also meet Dr Trask (Dinklage, solid as ever), the creator of the Sentinel program and find out how Mystique (Lawrence) is out to assassinate him. I'm not sure why the films have so much focus on her, when she's not really that interesting a character in the comics and certainly not as pivotal as the films make her. Beast (Hoult) is good and I'm glad they got one of the original five X-Men in there with Xavier (no sighting of Angel at all!). It all gets slightly confusing, as the 'future' X-Men fight off Sentinels to stop Wolverine from coming back to the future (had to be said!), while the 'past' X-Men fight Magneto, Mystique & Sentinels separately!There's some pretty massive set pieces at the end, with all the sets/costumes of the 70s looking great/realistic too (including Nixon!), but it all seemed just a little lacklustre to me. A few things don't quite add up and I had higher expectations from the future battles, as well as from the young Professor X/Magneto dynamic. It felt to me like it was building to something massive and the pay-off wasn't quite there. Sure, it's an enjoyable ending (I'm still looking forward to 'X-Men: Apocalypse') and does a good enough job of linking the films/characters, but I think Fox bit off more than they could chew. It was a little slow in parts and Wolverine certainly seemed like a passenger with not much to do. There were certainly some fun scenes and some exciting scenes, but not enough to elevate this to 'Avengers' status.",7,1,1,2 January 2018
Captain America: Civil War," Another strong Cap film. Bring on the Infinity War!
","'Captain America 3' is another great addition to the Marvel Cinematic Universe. This time, the film's basically 'Avengers 3', as it features almost every superhero we've seen so far, plus a few new ones. Natasha/Black Widow (Johansson) continues her close association with Steve/Captain America (Evans) - which worked really well in the last film - but Cap also has Sam/Falcon (Mackie) as his right-hand man too. The premise is quite simple: the 'Sokovia Accords' (instead of the 'Superhuman Registration Act' from the 2006 Mark Millar comics the film's based on) are new laws forced on the Avengers by Ross (Hurt), U.S. Secretary of State, as the U.N. wants to see the Avengers held accountable for their actions, since too many people died in (the fake country) Sokovia during the events of 'Avengers 2'. Tony/Iron Man (Downey Jr.) is all for it, but Cap is not.Bucky/Winter Soldier (Stan) then becomes involved and a massive man-hunt ensues (the film goes to more countries than a Bond film!) and the Avengers are divided (into an even six vs six): Iron Man, Black Widow, Rhodes/War Machine (Cheadle), T'Challa/Black Panther (Boseman), Vision (Bettany) and Peter/Spider-Man (Holland) vs Cap, Falcon, Winter Soldier, Wanda/Scarlet Witch (Olsen), Clint/Hawkeye (Renner) and Scott/Ant-Man (Rudd). The fight, about two-thirds in with only the Hulk and Thor missing, is epic - definitely something everyone wants to see. Some great quips too (mostly thanks to Ant-Man and Spider-Man - would love to see that team-up film!), as there's no malevolence, just a group of superhero friends/acquaintances fighting for what (and who, as the film's definitely Captain America v Iron Man at it's heart) they think is right.There could still be a little more done with Bucky's backstory - which kind of get mixed in with Iron Man's - but maybe I just need to re-watch 'Captain America 1' again, as it just seems like his & Cap's chemistry isn't quite there. Also needs to explore the Sharon Carter (VanCamp) storyline more. The introduction of Black Panther and Spider-Man is handled superbly, with Spider-Man only getting two scenes, but Holland nails them - the new Spider-Man films will be in good hands. And Boseman as Black Panther is fantastic, full of poise and just the right amount of anger - plus great fighting skills. Can't wait for his film in a few years.I thought it was better than 'Avengers: Age of Ultron', but not quite as good as 'Captain America: The Winter Soldier'. The ending probably dragged out a little and didn't quite resolve everything, with Zemo (Bruhl)'s plot not being as interesting as it could've been. Still, some great action, some decent ethical questions and some truly inventive fight scenes.",8,1,3,2 January 2018
The Conjuring 2," Not quite as good as the 1st
","'The Conjuring 2' starts off a little slow and disjointed, but when Ed & Lorraine finally get to London to check out what's happening to a child - Janet - things pick up, with the possessions/hauntings getting more severe.There's nothing that scary here, as far as I'm concerned. It's well directed, shot and acted, but there's no truly terrifying moment. The story makes 'sense' at the end, but still plenty of 'why's left. Decent haunted-house film, but nothing groundbreaking or extraordinary.",6,0,0,1 January 2018
Avengers: Endgame," Epic conclusion to a masterful series of films - Stan Lee would be proud.
","'Avengers: Endgame' (or 'Avengers 4') is the culmination of 21 films of inter-connected storytelling and while it's not the best film ever made (although it may end up the highest-grossing), it is certainly a fitting conclusion to one of cinemas most ambitious undertakings. If you haven't seen enough Marvel films to understand what's going on (what have you been doing!?), you'll still probably enjoy this, but a lot of backstory and character knowledge is assumed. This film follows on directly from 'Avengers: Infinity War', but it definitely helps if you've seen 'Ant-Man and the Wasp' and 'Captain Marvel' since then.OK, some things that will help outline the film, but I don't think are spoiler: Scott/Ant-Man (Rudd) and Clint/Hawkeye (Renner) get plenty of screen time, seeing as they weren't in 'Infinity War'. Natasha/Black Widow (Johansson) and Bruce/Hulk (Ruffalo) also have a bit more to do, which is fitting, giving all the original Avengers time to shine. Thor (Hemsworth) still gets plenty of great jokes. But, as always, this is the Steve & Tony show, with Steve/Captain America (Evans) and Tony/Iron Man (Downey Jr.), reconnecting and leading the Avengers as they try to undo what Thanos (Brolin) did to the universe in 'Infinity War'.Plot-wise, I don't think it's a spoiler to say there's some time travel involved. It's not totally out of the realms of what we've seen happen in other films, so you can go along with it. This obviously leads to some funny throw-backs/sentimental moments with other characters. Some of the start/middle is a bit of a slog, but it's all set-up for the end, and they can't be too happy & having fun after what happened. The final act is very satisfying, but also quite emotional and sad in parts. It's handled quite well. FYI: No credit scenes at all, so feel free to go to the bathroom after the 3 hours are up!",8,0,3,25 April 2019
The Hobbit: The Desolation of Smaug," Moved things along with plenty of action
","If you've liked the other four Lord of the Rings/Hobbit films, you'll like this one, simple. I found it highly enjoyable and well-paced - not as meandering as 'The Fellowship of the Ring' or 'An Unexpected Journey'. It's not as good as 'The Two Towers', but does an good job of moving the story and characters forward.It also has a great score - every time you hear that motif, you think of Sauron and the ring's temptation - and plenty of great visuals. It's pretty amazing how just watching a film can make you feel comfortable, as you recognize parts of Middle Earth/New Zealand. But most of all, it's fun - there's a bear, plenty of 'catch-me-if-you-can', a waterfall/rapids chase, some spelunking, some gold mining - oh, and a dragon!It's good to see Legolas and some Elves, as well as men, helping out the Hobbit & the Dwarves. Gandalf has some good moments, but this is definitely Bilbo's film - and it's left on a nice cliff-hanger.",8,0,1,2 January 2018
Toy Story 4," Another excellent story about life and love
","'Toy Story 4' is the sequel no-one asked for, but it is another excellent entry in the Pixar filmography - probably not quite as great as the original 'Toy Story', or the most recent 'Toy Story 3' (crazy that even it's nine years ago!), but still a great film. We're reintroduced to Woody (Hanks), Buzz (Allen) Bo Peep (Potts), Jessie (Cusak), Slinky (Clark), Rex (Shaw), Hamm (Ratzenberger) and the gang in a flashback, which sets up the film as a reunion story for Woody & Bo Peep.Now that the toys are enjoying their second lease on life after Andy passed them on, Bonnie (McGraw) is 'their kid'. When she goes to kindy, she creates a new toy - Forky (Hale), which is exactly what it sounds like. When Bonnie, her parents and the toys go on a roadtrip holiday, Forky gets lost and Woody embarks on a rescue mission. This search for Forky also parallels Woody's search for relevance.There's plenty of adventure and toy-action, as well as plenty of great new characters - Duke Caboom (Reeves), Ducky & Bunny (Key & Peele), Gabby (Hendricks), Giggle (Maki) - but it's hard to go past the originals & 'newer' additions Trixie the triceratops (Schaal) & Buttercup the unicorn (Garlin), including Mr Potato Head, pieced together by previous lines from the late Don Rickles. The friendship between Woody & Buzz is still key, but not at the forefront - it's almost a 'love' story between Woody & Bo and a father/son story between Woody & Forky. Needless to say, excellent CGI, great soundtrack and a fantastic ending.",8,6,21,19 June 2019
How to Train Your Dragon 2," Very enjoyable sequel and great fun - go see it no matter your age!
","If you haven't seen 'How To Train Your Dragon', you really should - it's a great animated film, not just for kids, with plenty of fun, a great cast, good story and it's brilliant to watch. This sequel does a rare thing - it is even more enjoyable than the original! The cast are all back again, but more importantly, so are the animators. I'm not sure how, but the detail, colours, movements and everything in this film are so vivid, it's truly astounding to watch.The story is relatively simple - someone's making a dragon army to conquer the free Vikings, so it's up to Hiccup (Baruchel) & Stoick (Butler) to save them. The twist comes with the introduction of Valka (Blanchett) and the dragon sanctuary she has created. Seeing where/how these hundreds of dragons is both amazing and strangely beautiful - and a little reminiscent of 'Avatar'. Needless to say, the clash of the two armies certainly makes for exciting viewing.There's some good morals of helping your friends and fighting for what's right for the kids, but still plenty for the adults. Much of this is thanks to the great support cast - Jonah Hill as Snotlout, T.J. Miller & Kristen Wiig as the twins, Chris Mintz-Plasse as Fishlegs and Kit Harrington/Jon Snow as Eret - they add the fun, banter and sidekick-ness to the film.",8,0,0,2 January 2018
The Grand Budapest Hotel," Another exceptional addition to Anderson's cannon
","I'm not sure I can say much more about Wes Anderson that hasn't already been said - he's definitely one of the most singular filmmakers of our generation. Needless to say, if you liked 'The Life Aquatic With Steve Zissou', 'The Darjeeling Limited' and 'Moonrise Kingdom' (which I did), then you'll enjoy 'The Grand Budapest Hotel'. It's got a huge ensemble cast, but the usual faces (Murray, Schwartzman, Norton, Wilson) are only given bit parts, with Gustave (Fiennes) the undisputed central character here.Even though it's named after the hotel, only about half the film takes place there - and when it does, it looks fantastic, with the colour and framing. They do a great job of telling the film as a back story, allowing Zero (Revolori/Abraham) to be our eyes and ears into the hotel's - and Gustave's - past. It's a fascinating story, with plenty of laughs, but also a decent murder-mystery/chase film packed in there. This is aided immensely by Adrien Brody & Willem Dafoe playing the 'badguys'.Everything flows nicely, there's precise dialogue (as always), a great score and great set/costume design. Goldblum's great as the lawyer and used really effectively. I can't really say much more - it's a really well-made and enjoyable film!",8,1,2,2 January 2018
Avengers: Infinity War," Near-flawless action/space epic
","SPOILER: 'Avengers: Infinity War' is the third Avengers film and the 19th Marvel Cinematic Universe film overall, serving as a culmination of the last 10 years. Will not a full-stop (Avengers 4 comes out next year), it does a great job of bringing the much-teased infinity stones/Thanos storyline together. Lots of knowledge of the previous MCU films is assumed, especially the two most recent films which lead directly in to this film - 'Thor: Ragnarok' and 'Black Panther'. It might make some sense if you haven't seen the others, but probably not too much. The stakes are certainly high, with a number of deaths of key characters throughout (no spoilers) and the opening scene literally taking no prisoners. The vital part of this film is the villain, Thanos (Brolin) who - despite being large, ugly & purple - gets enough backstory and shows adequate ethos to almost empathise with his reasoning for wanting to destroy half the universe (via the infinity stones). While there's some deaths and plenty of tension/darkness in parts, there's still lots of laughs, mostly thanks to Thor (Hemsworth), Starlord (Pratt), Rocket (Cooper) and Drax (Bautista). The CGI is fantastic the entire film, with plenty of scenes in space and on new planets, which is always great to see - as is Iron Man (Downey Jr.)'s inevitable new suit. The way the team-ups are handled is done really well, with Dr Strange (Cumberbatch), the Guardians of the Galaxy, Spider-Man (Holland), Black Panther (Boseman) and the Avengers all split up, so there's always different scenes moving things along at a good pace. The third act battle is not predictable and the ending is hugely shocking - certainly no cop-out.",9,178,461,25 April 2018
Once Upon a Time... in Hollywood," All style, no substance
","'Once Upon A Time In Hollywood' is set in 1969 Los Angeles and follows TV actor and almost-has-been Rick Dalton (DiCaprio) and his stunt double/friend Cliff Booth (Pitt) as they try to stay relevant. Given it's a Tarantino film, there's plenty of long shots of just actors talking - probably too many. While Margot Robbie is third billed, it feels like she has about 10min screen time and is almost pointless to the story.It's good to watch DiCaprio and Pitt together and there's a natural ease and confidence to all their scenes. The problem is that half the film is just Pitt driving around and DiCaprio acting on a set. There are plenty of nods to the late 60s - Playboy Mansion, drive-ins, the fashion, dozens of film posters, smoking in almost every scene, snippets of songs - but overall, it doesn't really come across as nostalgic, just gimmicky. Might be more impactful if you lived through it.Plenty of cameos/small roles - Pacino, Hirsch, Olyphant, Dern, Dunham - but none of significance. There's Roman Polanski (Zawierucha), Charles Manson (Herriman) and Bruce Lee (Moh), but all have minimal screen time - except Lee, who's portrayed as an idiot for some reason. It's basically 2 hours 20min of nice cinematography - although too many shots of peoples shoes as they're walking - and then a hyperviolent/crazy final 20min which half links some of the film together. As an entire film, it struggles to keep your interest, there's only a few funny moments and has a very loose plot.",5,5,7,17 August 2019
Gone Girl," A fairly original gripping murder mystery
","'Gone Girl' is a hard movie to review - I really don't want to give away too much, because the less you know, the better. I'll say this much - it's a very engrossing mystery/thriller, that's for sure. Certainly lots of twists and turns that keep you guessing and engaged throughout.The main problem is the length - at over two & a half hours, I feel like it could have been wrapped up in a double 'Law & Order'/'CSI'-like episode (i.e. one & a half hours). Sure, it's moody and suspenseful, but it definitely drags at times. The ending is a little ridiculous, but fits with the rest of the film.On the plus-side, the acting is superb, with Affleck & Pike doing the majority of the heavy lifting and truly lending gravitas to their characters. The support cast is also great - Coon as his sister, NPH as the ex-boyfriend, Perry as the lawyer and Dickens as the detective. The Trent Reznor/Atticus Ross score is again ominous and fitting, if a little bland at times.",7,0,0,2 January 2018
Get Out," Fun and well-made thriller
","'Get Out' is billed as a horror film, but - no spoilers in this review! - it's really more of a mystery/tense thriller. It's shot really well and looks great (nice effort from first-time director Peele), with some smart use of the Alabama location and a good score. The premise is purposefully cryptic: 'African-American man visits his Caucasian girlfriend's mysterious family estate'. Chris (Kaluuya) is meeting Rose (Williams) parents - Missy (Keener) & Dean (Whitford) - for the first time, and they welcome him with open arms, even if the servants seem off.It's not all about race, but it is a key aspect of the film and handled quite well. The two leads easily carry the film, both having some great scenes. However, the best bits are probably whenever Chris' friend Rod (Howery) is on screen, being hilarious and boisterous, even though often by phone. The humour and some slow bits do well to make the surprises seem even more shocking.The twist isn't as big as 'Cabin in the Woods' or 'The Sixth Sense', but the final 20min is certainly one of the better endings to a thriller/horror film you'll see for a while! Bit of a slow build up in parts, but a very exciting finish and it's all over in 100min.",7,19,37,2 January 2018
A Quiet Place," Great character-focused thriller
","'A Quiet Place' is a really well-made thriller, which is interesting since Krasinski (yes, the guy from the American 'The Office') is the director, co-writer, producer and star. It's not necessarily a horror film (hence the 'M' rating), but is certainly packed full of tension and suspense and has plenty of jumpy moments. The film makes a bold choice early on and does a good job of setting the scene, while not revealing too much.This is true of the monsters/creatures - we're not told where they're from, how many there is or what's going on in the wider world. The whole focus is on the one family - Lee (Krasinski), Evelyn (Blunt), and their three kids, Regan (Simmonds), Marcus (Jupe) and Beau (Woodward). The use of sound is exceptional and the lack of speaking very unique. There's sign language and subtitles, but it's hardly needed, thanks to the superb score.'A Quiet Place' is similar to last year's 'It Comes At Night' in concept, but better executed. It doesn't overstay welcome (90 min) and fully delivers on both building pressure and having plenty of legitimate scares by making you ask 'what would I do in this situation?' Krasinski and the kids are good, but Blunt is excellent and shows all her emotions excellently. Also has a solid ending",8,1,3,7 April 2018
22 Jump Street," Great sequel with plenty of laugh-out-loud moments and plenty of charisma to boot
","Is '22 Jump Street' as good as '21 Jump Street'? Quite possibly, which is a big achievement, seeing as the original was one of the better comedies of the last 10 years! This film has just as many laughs - if not more - and does a great job of poking fun at itself and the ludicrousness of most Hollywood sequels.There's a few more car chases, but they're unconventional and quite amusing with the commentary the two leads provide. A fair bit of the humour comes from the fact that their undercover disguise as college-age students (i.e. they should be 18-21), which is totally unbelievable, seeing as Hill is 30 & Tatum is 34. Plenty of referencing the first film and stupidity of repetition in sequels (mostly by Offerman's Chief of Police - 'EVERYTHING is EXACTLY the SAME'!) and even casting the bad guy from 'Bad Boys II' - Peter Stormare - as the villain in this!Pretty good support cast - the Yang Twins are great as the across-the-hall stoners, Stevens is good as the love interest and Ice Cube has more to do in this film, which is a good thing and leads to a few hilarious scenes.Best bit of the film? Probably the many joke sequel posters/trailers they show! Highly entertaining and just plain funny to see how far they can stretch a premise. Quite reminiscent of 'Tropic Thunder', but definitely had the crowd in stitches! I do hope they make a third film, but if not, both 21 & 22 Jump Street will stand as some of the best action/police comedies ever made.",8,1,2,2 January 2018
X-Men: Apocalypse," Fitting finale
","'X-Men: Apocalypse' is the sixth X-Men film and the final piece in the second trilogy (2011-2016), fitting in after 'Days of Future Past' and before 'X-Men' (2000). Although the time travel of the previous film does leave a somewhat altered 'reality', so it doesn't necessarily all fit together nicely. Plot's pretty simple - Apocalypse/En Sabah Nur (Isaac) is the first mutant, with the ability to collect other mutants' powers, and he's now been resurrected and wants to destroy the world so only the strong survive. Plenty of Nazi parallels, and they use Magneto (Fassbender) and his Jewish past to emphasize this.Some of the films like repeating the same territory, as they have to re-establish the 'new' characters: Jean (Turner), Cyclops (Sheridan), Havoc (Till), Nightcrawler (Smit-McPhee) and how they fit in with Xavier (McAvoy) and his school. I guess after the other two films, they needed Mystique (Lawrence), but I'm not sure why she needs to play such a big part. And Beast (Hoult) is mostly wasted, along with Apocalypse's Horsemen - Storm (Shipp), Psylocke (Munn) & Angel (Hardy). Some great CGI and large-scale chaos shown, but also some nice soft-touch moments, particularly between Charles & Erik - something Singer did well in the original film. One of the best bits is near the end when they almost verbatim repeat something from the 2000 film - and there's another nice tongue-in-cheek moment when they come out of seeing 'Return of the Jedi' (forgot to mention the film's set in 1983!)I loved Metallica's 'The Four Horsemen' playing when Apocalypse turns Angel into the metal-winged Archangel, worked great for the scene. Quicksilver (Peters) - despite being dead in the 'Avengers' films and only 10 years younger than Fassbender - is a very welcome addition here and has some great moments, particularly the Eurythmics bit. It doesn't follow any particular comic storyline completely, but borrows from a few, with only a few nods to the 1990s 'Age of Apocalypse'. Magneto's motivation could've been better, for me, but the scenes he and Xavier are in are always good. Issac is menacing but not too over-the-top as Apocalypse, but somehow, even with the world (slowly!) crumbling, it doesn't all click quite as well as you feel it could. Definitely a worthy addition to the franchise, but still a shame they never reached the pinnacle set by the original X-Men film.",7,0,0,2 January 2018
The Amazing Spider-Man 2," A solid action movie, but it (please forgive me for this pun) just seemed to lack a little spark!
","The debate still probably continues as to the necessity of this second trilogy of Spider-Man films so shortly after the first, but to me - based on the first two so far - they are far superior. Sure, 'The Amazing Spider-Man 2' is not as good as its predecessor from two years ago, but it is still very enjoyable. The film does well linking back to the first film, while also laying some back story for the next one.The storyline starts off quite simple - Peter & Gwen are in still in love, but he's conflicted because of the promise he made to her Dad, so there's a bit of 'will they, won't they?' But at least we have Garfield & Stone - both just plain better actors than Maguire & Dunst. They introduce Max/Electro (Foxx) quite well, but Harry Osborn (DeHaan) a little less so. And I wish they'd saved the Stan Lee cameo for later on! Still, it's mostly faithful for the comics - with the exception of Giamatti as The Rhino (almost unrecognisable!), although it makes sense he'd be in metal armour, rather than rubber!I feel they went a little too close to the original trilogy by focusing on Osborn/Green Goblin/Oscorp and not enough on Electro as the main villain & Gwen as the love interest. When you see how powerful Electro becomes (I don't recall him being as strong/capable in the comics), it makes you question why/how Spider-Man would actually be fighting him - seems like a job for the Fantastic Four or The Avengers! It's probably a little too long at 2 hours 20min, but still, there's some rousing speeches (thanks Aunt May & Gwen), some very funny moments and plenty of great action. It just seemed to (please forgive me for this pun) lack a little spark!",7,1,1,2 January 2018
Coco," Extremely enjoyable film
","'Coco' is another Disney-Pixar animation instant-classic, with an excellent, touching story, good music, in testing characters and great visuals. It's also something a bit different - set in Mexico and following Miguel (Gonzalez), a boy who is accidently trapped in the Land of the Dead as he tries to escape. Even though all the spirits are depicted as skeletons, it's not as sinister as it sounds - still very suitable for kids.Miguel gets transported to the Land of the Dead on 'Dia de Muertos' ('Day of the Dead', when Mexicans honour their ancestors), after trying to learn more about his great-great grandfather (Coco's dad), who was a famous musician - De La Cruz (Bratt - has a hilarious death). With him for the journey is Dante the dog, who provides a lot of the laughs. It's great to see Miguel meeting and interacting with his great uncles and great aunties, who he's only heard about. Plenty of colour, movement and imagination went into the Land of the Dead and it looks great - basically a tiered seaside village. Miguel is helped on his journey to find De La Cruz by Hector (Bernal), who's trying to visit the Land of the Living, as he's afraid he's being forgotten and will soon cease to exist.If you don't have tears in your eyes at some point, then you're probably dead and already in the Land of the Dead! The final 30min is exceptional, with a great twist and plenty of heartwarming moments. This is almost as good as 'Up' - huge praise from me! There's some laughs, some songs, lots of fun, but most importantly the film really highlights the importance of family and honouring those who have come before you - extremely touching at times.",8,0,2,1 January 2018
1917," Excellently executed war journey
","'1917' is both a WWI film and a masterclass in cinematography. It's not based on one specific true story or battle, but rather the plot is inspired by stories the director's (Mendes) grandfather told him. From the opening scene, it's clear the 'real-time' no-cuts concept is going to make the film different, as we meet Corporal Blake (Chapman) and Corporal Schofield (MacKay) and then the camera doesn't leave them for the next 2 hours. They're assigned an urgent mission by a General (Firth), to alert another battalion not to enter what is a German ambush.While set in France, it's filmed in England. The number of extras used is astounding, as is the accuracy of the trenches, barbed wire, ruins and uniforms. The trenches in particular are impressive to see as they walk through them, as they're not just CGI from a distance. From the moment Blake & Schofield step out into no-man's-land, the tension (and score) are ratcheted right up and there's only a few moments of respite.They meet a few helpful soldiers and some Germans on their journey - Captain Smith (Strong) and his troop, Colonel Mackenzie (Cumberbatch) and Blake's brother (Madden). Other than that, only Lauri (Duburcq), a frightened French lady, have any screen time. Thankfully, both the leads are great and easy to cheer for. It's an enthralling ride, with lots of subtle - and not-so-subtle - reminders of the horrors of war. It almost leaves you exhausted, as you feel like you've been on the mission with them.",8,5,8,11 January 2020
Star Wars: Episode VIII - The Last Jedi," Not the best of the franchise, but does enough to keep the momentum going for Episode IX
","'Star Wars: The Last Jedi' (Episode VIII) has a big challenge - live up to the original trilogy and build upon the solid foundation laid by 'The Force Awakens'. It achieves both in parts, but probably not overall. If Episode VII was reminiscent of 'A New Hope', Episode VIII doesn't really emulate 'The Empire Strikes Back' too much. It starts with a pretty good space battle between The Resistance and the First Order, with Poe Dameron (Issac) and General Hux (Gleeson) the main players. Poe's a great character, but probably needed more of him. The characters are all in different locations, so the film spends a bit of time hopping between them - Luke (Hamill) and Rey (Ridley) are on Ahch-To; Leia (Fisher) is with Poe on a ship being chased by Hux & her son, Kylo Ren (Driver); Finn (Boyega) is on a mission with Rose (Tran) at Canto Bight, a casino planet.Unlike the original and prequel trilogies, 'The Last Jedi' doesn't pick up a few years later - it's almost the next day. Some of my main issues with the film are because of this - The First Order had their massive 'Starkiller Base' (and seemingly thousands of soldiers) destroyed at the end of Episode VII, so how do they suddenly have two of the biggest spaceships ever seen? Where are all their resources coming from? My other gripes are that's it's probably a little too long (2 hours 30min), we don't learn where Snoke came from or how/why he's so powerful/in charge, Laura Dern is not really needed, Benicio Del Toro's character could've been done much better and we don't see nearly enough of R2-D2, C-3PO, or Chewbacca. The film spends too much time in the space stand-off between Leia and Ren and is a bit disjointed cutting between what's happening.In saying all that, there's plenty of positives, with Rey being the shining light in this new trilogy, and Ren continues to remain an interesting character. It's good to see Luke have more screen time, even if he's still brooding over his failure of Ben Solo/Kylo Ren. The Porgs were funny and cute, not annoying as I thought they might be, Chewie finally gets a hug from Leia (something that annoyed me at the end of Episode VII) and there's a few good lightsaber duels, and the final act with the AT-AT's/sky-speeders is very well done.",7,2,6,1 January 2018
Guardians of the Galaxy," Fun and frantic - with a fantastic soundtrack - and 'I am Groot'!
","Firstly, you don't need to be a huge comics fan or know anything about the 'Guardians of the Galaxy' going in to this to enjoy it. Even though I'm a pretty big Marvel fan, I still knew very little about the Guardians, but had heaps of fun with the film anyway. It's a pretty simple concept - a boy, Peter Quill (Pratt) is taken from Earth by one of the spacefaring races that exist in the Marvel Universe, grows up as a Han Solo-esque outlaw calling himself 'Star Lord' travelling/thieving around the galaxy. He steals the wrong thing (an orb) and gets involved in a galactic power struggle which forces him to work together with Gamora (Saldana), Rocket (Cooper), Groot (Vin Diesel in his best role ever!) and Drax (Bautista). Action and adventure ensue!The bad guy, Ronan (Pace), is a Kree that wants to wipe out the plant Xandar - no real reason why he hates the Xandarians, he just does! - and Thanos (who we saw at the end of 'The Avengers') is going to help him, once he gets the orb. It sounds complicated - and we haven't seen any Skrulls or Shi'ar yet! - but the film doesn't really get too bogged down in galactic politics or grudges. However, it sets up the potential for a huge 'The Avengers 3' or the new 'Fantastic Four'.One of the best bits is that Quill was abducted in 1988, so the only cassette he has is full of 70's & 80's music, meaning he knows nothing else and the film does a great job of throwing in catchy, but not necessarily huge, pop songs throughout - Bowie, 10cc, Blue Swede, Joan Jett, Marvin Gaye... The audio makes everything fun and provides a nice contrast to the aliens/space battles going on in the visuals!So, when Quill and his team of misfits - so many 'Star Wars' comparisons (a good thing!), including Thanos appearing as a hologram to Ronan - decide to do something good with their lives and join forces with the Xandarian 'Nova Corps' (although, no sign of Nova the character) to stop Ronan. There's a huge/exciting battle and final scene.Plenty of laughs throughout, mostly thanks to Pratt & Cooper and the film never gets bogged down in too much seriousness, or the darkness/evil of the villains. Loads of eye-popping action and lots of cameos/support actors adding to the overall 'big galaxy' feel. The Groot scene near the end is spectacular and the post end credits scene is a pretty great inside joke.",9,1,2,2 January 2018
Jurassic World," An exciting return-to-form for the series - there will be more!
","'Jurassic World' (or Jurassic Park 4) is set 22 years after the original film (and 14 years after the last film), on the same Costa Rican island, with it now a fully-functioning theme park. Why anyone would open or invest in it after the events is another story altogether and never really mentioned! Owen (Pratt) is the Sam Neil replacement and is charming and solid throughout and Claire (Dallas Howard) is the Laura Dern replacement and becomes less stuck-up and annoying as the film progresses. Jake Johnson (Nick off 'New Girl') is great as the computer tech in the control room and gets a few funny moments - a more than admirable job as the Jeff Goldblum replacement!The film keeps a similar formula to 'Jurassic Park' - two kids, a concerned parent-figure (but not the actual parents - why are they never with their kids?), a dinosaur escaping and everyone running for their lives! There's some nice throwbacks to the original too - the score motifs, the kids stumble into the foyer of the memorable final scene, the original/distinctive jeeps are seen, Dr Wu - the geneticist - is played by the same actor, Hammond is mentioned a few times and there's a heard of Gallimimus at one point. I was glad to see more Stegosaurs and also to see Ankylosaurs for the first time in the series.My main issue was the similarity to some aspects of 'Jurassic Park III' - there's a dinosaur bigger than Tyrannosaurus Rex that kills everything; there's Pteranodons that get loose and their consequences never properly dealt with; and the Velociraptors aren't really treated as vicious killing machines until it's needed in the story. However, it doesn't really need to make much sense when there's so many great moments of tension, then action, then surprise throughout - and some genuine wonder with the Deinosuchus in the Sea World part. A well done final scene(s) cap off an enjoyable experience.",8,1,1,2 January 2018
Logan," Fantastic finale
","'Logan' is the final (we'll see) Wolverine film, in addition to the six X-Men films, so it's safe to say it's Jackman's last outing - it's been a good 17 years! 'Logan' is again directed by Mangold, who did the previous film ('The Wolverine') and is set in 2029 - when Logan/James Howlett is ~200 and Professor Charles Xavier (Stewart) is ~90. They do a great job of making them both look and seem way older than their appearances in the last few films! It's great to see Logan as an every-man drifter, working as a limo driver between El Paso and Mexico, where he's looking after Prof X with his dementia. Clearly, some tragedy has befallen them and it's alluded to a few times.The 'near-future' looks very realistic - almost the same as now, but with driverless trucks and giant robotic harvesting machines. No futuristic ray guns or anything! It's also cool to see Wolverine kill about five people and swear about 10 times in the first 3min - well-earned MA rating! Also, very true to the comics, where some of the story is from Millar's 'Old Man Logan' (highly recommended). Once X-23/Laura (Keen) comes into it, the film becomes a Western, with Logan trying to protect Prof X & Laura from Donald Pierce (Holbrook - fun bad guy) as they go on a cross-country chase.There's some plausible plot, only tentatively linking in with previous films, but particularly X-23 and X-24 (i.e. Wolverine as 'Weapon X' was X-1, but this time the experiments were in Mexico, not Canada...) showing Logan both his past and potential future. Getting to see his healing-factor wane and have to face his mortality, as well as reluctantly be the good guy, is all true to character and pulled off expertly by Jackman. It's long (2.25 hours), with lots of nice, character-building moments - particularly with the family at the farm house. Keen is good as Laura and Merchant has a nice role as Caliban. It's also touching and poignant in plenty of scenes (good score), but there's heaps of action and violence too - especially the final 25min, with it all well executed.",8,1,3,2 January 2018
Avengers: Age of Ultron," Not perfect, but still an extremely enjoyable superhero flick
","Avengers 2 starts off very fast-paced - you're already in the midst of a battle and one of the first exchanges is a hilarious back-and-forth between Iron Man (Downey Jr.) and Captain America (Evans). It at once sets the scene for a great action film, but also helps to quickly re-introduce characters and their personalities. It's not essential to have seen the first movie, or even the 'Thor', 'Iron Man' or 'Captain America' films (and even 'Guardians of the Galaxy'), but they definitely help to add another layer of nuance and understanding to some events/characters.The plot is pretty straight forward - Iron Man wants to protect the world by having his automated suits everywhere. This inadvertently creates artificial intelligence, which turns out to be Ultron (Spader) - who wants to protect Earth by helping it to evolve. This obviously involves wiping out the human species! The Avengers can't handle him - and with Scarlet Witch (Olsen) and Quicksilver (Taylor-Johnson/Kick-Ass) on his side (before they see his true intentions) - they have to re-group and learn to all work together again. The introduction of Vision (Bettany) is handled well and is a welcome one for future films.One of the best aspects of this film is the characterisation - each Avenger gets some backstory and exposition, not just fight scenes. Hawkeye (Renner) probably comes off the best here, since he's often overlooked - he is after all just a guy who's a good archer! The Black Widow (Johansson) and Hulk (Ruffalo) 'romance' is odd and new, but doesn't necessarily work. However, it's good seeing Thor (Hemsworth), Iron Man and Captain America work as part of a team - especially when Thor and 'Cap' combine to take out dozens of enemies at once!
 
Spader's voice is great as the voice of discontent with the human species. While the ending is a little reminiscent of 'Superman Returns', the film takes you on an entertaining ride through the Marvel universe - I still look forward to the next instalment(s)!",8,0,0,2 January 2018
Everest," A solid character-driven survival epic
","'Everest' is a true survival - man vs nature - film. It's not necessarily fun, but it is engrossing. Since it's based on a true story (I haven't read the 'Into Thin Air' novel), it's a simple plot - in 1996, a group of experienced climbers engage the services of Rob (Clarke) to assist them in their climb to the summit of Earth's highest mountain - Mt Everest in Nepal. The film spends 40min (probably too long) introducing the characters and staying at Base Camp, but it does give you the chance to get to know them and their motivations - especially Beck (Brolin) & Doug (Hawkes).That's the main question throughout - 'why'? I think it boils down to ego - man's desire to conquer everything, even nature's most extreme obstacles - highest mountain, driest desert, deepest ocean trench, outer space, etc. It is nice to see them fulfilling their dreams on making it to the summit, but once the inevitable storm blows in, it really does make you think 'these people are insane for being up there'! I definitely won't be climbing Everest!It's a well-made film, with good pacing once they're climbing and some truly beautiful shots of the Himalayas - very glad they shot a lot of it on-site. The devastating storm is one of the loudest and most ominous things you can imagine when at the top of a mountain. Rob's calls with Jan (Knightley - worst Kiwi accent ever) slow things down, but add to the drama.",7,0,1,2 January 2018
La La Land," Average romance musical
","Lots of people have been asking if I've seen 'La La Land', so I thought I had better give it a chance, even though musicals aren't my thing - better late than never, right? I always list the four most prominent actors when I do a review, but I truly struggled to think of anyone else to fill the 3rd & 4th slots, since this film has two stars, and at least one of them is on screen the entire time, with little time dedicated to anything/anyone else. Maybe not a bad thing, but it does mean the film gets a bit monotonous.Sebastian (Gosling) and Mia (Stone) are easy to watch and are good in this, but I don't think either of them is a particularly good singer or dancer. My main problem with musicals is: why? If a scene's not interesting enough to sustain momentum without having song and dance, then cut it! At least in animated films, they seem to find ways to weave songs in organically - and they're catchy. Here, I didn't find any of the songs very catchy or interesting - most are kind of mopey. Otherwise, it's all quite predictable - they fall in love, they chase their dreams, the end.The ending is semi-interesting, but every time I started to get pulled into the film when there's a stretch with no singing, it suddenly appears again - always out of context - and pushes me back out. It's definitely not a bad film, I just felt like nothing really happened - sure, there's some romance and they're good actors, but there's no real story or humour to be found.",5,0,0,2 January 2018
Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2," Still a bright spark in the MCU
","'Guardians of the Galaxy: Vol. 2' is the highly-anticipated sequel to one of Marvel's surprise hits - and it doesn't disappoint. Sure, it's not as novel or zesty as the original, but it's still one of the best sequels in a long time. It still looks - and sounds - great: vibrant colours, plenty of action, both in space and on strange planets and another killer soundtrack that will grow on people as well. Great use of Fleetwood Mac and Cat Stevens, in particular.Peter/Star Lord (Pratt) is back with his rag-tag friends/family - Gamora (Saldana), the almost-love-interest; Drax (Bautista) who's both endearingly stupid and means well; Rocket (Cooper), the alienated racoon and Groot (Diesel), in ultra-cute baby-tree form. Yondu (Rooker), Peter's adopted father and Nebula (Gillan), Gamora's sister, are dragged back into the fray, as Peter's father finally appears - Ego (Bridges, charming as ever). There's some great cameos - Hasselhoff, Stallone, and, as always, Stan Lee (+ The Watchers) - and some good development of Mantis (Klementieff) and Kraglin (Gunn).The main plot is all about family - Peter and his new-found father, as well as his odd relationship with Yondu (and Gamora); Gamora's love/hate relationship with Nebula; Rocket being lonely and struggling to accept that he cares for others; and them all looking after Baby Groot (excellent post-credits scene too). Obviously, a great final battle scene and plenty of laughs throughout.",8,1,2,2 January 2018
The Shape of Water," Different and enjoyable love story
","'The Shape of Water' is del Toro's 10th film, and one of his best - better than 'Pan's Labyrinth', in my books. It's an interesting tale about a mute woman Elisa (Hawkins), who works as a cleaner at a military base with her friend, Zelda (Spencer). There they find that Strickland (Shannon) has brought something strange back to the base. Since he's shown in the trailer & posters, it's not really a spoiler to say that Doug Jones plays an Abe Sapien-like creature (man, I wish they'd make 'Hellboy III'!) Elisa and 'the asset' begin to connect and we're off on a peculiar journey.The film does well to integrate the fantastic with the real world, with everything looking like the 1960's and the racism, sexism and prejudice is still on display. There's also an interesting sub-plot of the Cold War, with Russian spies - and a bit of a sad ending there, but also slyly funny. All the actors are great - Jenkins as the helpful friend/neighbour, Spencer as the chatty/funny work friend, Stuhlbarg as the scientist, Shannon as the bad guy - always excellent - and Jones and Hawkins as the silent, but super-expressive leads.The other main stars are colour and water - everything's either a motif of green, blue or teal, and the use of water as a transition between scenes is great. The score's good and the film never seems hurried - except for one scene - but isn't too long either. There's moments of violence and comedy between the question of how does he exist? But mostly, it's a pleasant story about love and identity, with a solid ending and excellent cinematography.",8,41,83,12 January 2018
The Disaster Artist," Mostly funny semi-parody
","'The Disaster Artist' is a homage/satire of the making of 'The Room', one of the so-called 'worst movies ever'. Full disclosure: I've never seen 'The Room', as I'm not sure there's such a thing as 'so bad it's good'... It obviously made enough of an impact for James Franco, who decided to imitate his muse - Tommy Wiseau - by producing, starring in and directing this film. Franco didn't write it though - it's based on the book by Greg Sestero, Tommy's best friend, played by Franco's brother, Dave. One of the film's strong points is watching them onscreen together.There's an exceptional backing cast - Seth Rogen as a script editor, Alison Brie (Dave Fracno's actual wife), as Greg's girlfriend, Ari Graynor as the female co-star, Jacki Weaver, Zac Efron, Paul Scheer, Megan Mullally, Jason Mantzoukas, Hannibal Buress, Sharon Stone, Judd Apatow, Bob Odenkirk. But the film is really carried by the Franco brothers - at least one of them is in every scene. The main revelation is how much James Franco looks like Tommy and the final 5min show a shot-by-shot comparison of some scenes, and it's uncanny how close they got some of the diction and body language.This is basically a film about making a film - an actual behind-the-scenes documentary might have been just as good. Not a whole lot happens really, and you know how it's going to end. There's plenty of funny moments, but I feel like it might be funnier if you're familiar with 'The Room'. Bit disappointed they didn't actually resolve the mysteries of his age, place of birth & where his money comes from!",6,1,2,2 January 2018
American Made," Fast-paced fun
","'American Made' is not one of Tom Cruise's best efforts, but nor is it his worst - it's based on a true story of a pilot that ends up working for the CIA and drug smuggling for the Colombians in the early 80s.There's plenty of guns, double-crosses and fast flying, with easy-to-follow graphics to explain who's doing what, & where. Some funny moments and it's easy to see Cruise was enjoying himself. Nothing too new, in terms of the Medellín cartel, but it's all handled well, with time flying by, a few flash-forwards, and a good ending. Worth the 2 hours",7,0,1,1 January 2018
12 Years a Slave," Some great acting and a harrowing tale, with a very touching finale, but something doesn't quite click, leaving you feeling a little numb after
","First up, a few warnings: this is not for the faint of heart. There is a lot of graphic torture and despicable things which the camera does not shy away from. This is obviously to hit home the ugly truth of the reality of slavery and America's sorry past, but it's very unpleasant to watch. It's also quite slow and long - 2 hours 15min.It could've used more of the support cast, since Giamatti, Dano, Cumberbatch and Pitt do a good job, but it's a true story, so there's only so much creative liberty they could've taken. Most of the film just makes you sad, angry and anguished for Solomon (Ejiofor), wishing you could do something or he and the other slaves would rebel, but that was their reality and it's a harsh pill to swallow.There's no humour or light-hearted moments to lighten the mood - and arguably there shouldn't be - but it's definitely no 'Django Unchained' when you compare their entertainingness. That's not really the directors fault, but I feel it could have been paced a little better - and there seemed to be lots of scenes with Solomon just staring wide-eyed (see above!).",7,0,0,2 January 2018
Sausage Party," Crazy - in a mostly good way
","'Sausage Party' is... well, just plain nuts! Probably the best description is 'absurd'. It's certainly unique, being the first 'adult' GCI film (not just a cartoon like the 'South Park' movie) and it does all it can to push the boundaries of making sure you remember it's not a kids film (even though it starts with a song), with so many swear words, racial stereotypes, sexual innuendo and drugs in the first 30min that you can't forget it's a Seth Rogen film. Frank (the sausage, Rogen) and his girlfriend Brenda (the bun, Wiig) can't wait to get out of their packages and be united in the 'Great Beyond' outside the supermarket.When Barry (Cera) and Carl (Hill), Frank's sausage buddies, are bought and find out the truth of what happens to food, they try to return to warn the others. The voice actors are great - Sammy (bagel, Norton), Lavash (Krumholtz), Teresa (taco, Hayek), Douche (Kroll), Firewater (Hader), Grits (Robinson), Honey mustard (McBride). It's part road trip, part action/'Die Hard' and part stoner rom-com. The 'human world' vs 'food world' distinction is done well, with faded colour vs vibrancy. Some of Rogen's almost-sermons on not following the religious crap you're fed without proof is good, but the anti-religion message is lost in the chaos.It's not as uproarious as I was hoping - it's certainly funny and has a lot of chuckles, but there wasn't many truly hilarious moments for me. Part of that is my expectations being too high - I've been waiting for this film for three years and it's nowhere near as good as 'Knocked Up', 'Superbad' or 'Pineapple Express'. Some of the best bits are the morbid/violent bits, not necessarily the dialogue. The last 20min or so didn't really work for me - a bit too much. There's so much going on and so many things to look at and listen to that some jokes are lost or skipped over.",6,1,1,2 January 2018
Joker," Different and sometimes difficult take on the villain's origin
","'Joker' is definitely not a comic book film - don't expect Batman, any good guy/bad guy battles, CGI or falling into a vat of chemicals. This film is 100% focused on Arthur (Phoenix)'s transformation from misunderstood clown and comedian into the psychopathic killer that is the Joker. The only Batman connections are via Thomas Wayne (Cullen), two scenes with ~10-year-old Bruce Wayne (Pereira-Olson) and a few mentions of Gotham.Phoenix is the fourth live-action film Joker, with each seeming to be of their time. This is the opposite of Nicholson's Joker and an extension of Ledger's Joker. The difference is that both Nicholson & Ledger only had ~30min of screen time, whereas Phoenix is in almost every second of this film's 2 hours - and is mesmerising throughout. Especially his weight loss and how his ribs show, and how he uses that awkwardness in his dancing and movements.It looks great, the score and soundtrack are solid. It's not overly violent until the final 25min and Arthur/Joker's doesn't always make sense, which is the point. It's a bit slow in parts and doesn't fully utilise De Niro (a Letterman-like TV host). The coughing Phoenix does looks physically painful, but is a bit too convenient as a plot point. Does a great job of being the outcast though.",7,2,7,4 October 2019
Pitch Perfect 2," Up-tempo feel-good fun
","'Pitch Perfect 2' (rare in the fact that it doesn't have a sub-title!) is a decent sequel to the surprise 2012 hit comedy about a university a capella group. This film is obviously aimed at females and is going after a younger audience, introducing 18-year-old Emily (Steinfeld) into the mix now - probably to allow a third film in the series. However, these don't make it a bad film - still plenty of enjoyable moments throughout.There's probably less of a focus on the singing this time round, because - let's face it - a capella isn't really that exciting and can get old pretty quick. Especially with some of the rival teams - 'Das Sound Machine' - and some of the terrible song choices (depending on your point-of-view, obviously). This is usually a good thing, as it gives Amy (Wilson) a chance to drop more quick-witted remarks and have more awkwardness with Bumper (DeVine) and even Becca (Kendrick) has some funny moments with her new boss (Keegan-Michael Key). But the best bits are still between the commentators - Elizabeth Banks (also her first time directing) & John Michael Higgins - plenty of hilarious lines and inappropriate comments. It's a little too long (almost two hours), has a few redundant scenes and is very predictable, but you're going to get what you expect - lots of laughs, some young-adult-what-does-the-future-hold musing and plenty of extras in a Louisiana field pretending it's a Danish festival! I wish the original song ('Flashlight') wasn't by Jessie J, but there's still some decent songs in it.",6,0,0,2 January 2018
The Wolf of Wall Street," DiCaprio definitely deserves an Oscar for this role and you owe it to yourself to see this film
","OK, so I went into 'The Wolf Of Wall Street' with no expectations and it really impressed me! I guess I shouldn't be too surprised - it is Scorsese! He's definitely a master director, with the film paced perfectly and the three hour run-time actually flies by, with barely a minute wasted. I also liked how DiCaprio occasionally broke the fourth wall and spoke directly to the audience - works well here.It's a true story, but I assume some creative liberties have been taken, as usual. It's basically a story of greed, ambition and ego, all played out on Wall St, New York in the late 80s and early 90s. There's some great supporting actors as DiCaprio's fellow stockbrokers/advisers, none more so than Hill, but it's great to see McConaughey, Reiner, Favreau and Suplee helping out.While a film about stockbrokers doesn't sound too exciting, I can assure you this is - it has debauchery, drugs, alcohol, ridiculous chanting, sex - approximately a new pair of boobs to look at every 5min - life-or-death situations, a decent score, plenty of laughs (particularly the country club scene!) and a fitting conclusion.",8,0,1,2 January 2018
It Chapter Two," Better than the 1990 version, not quite as good as the 2017 one
","'It: Chapter Two' is the sequel to 'It' from only two years ago, but this is now the prophesized '27 years later', with Pennywise (Skarsgard) back to wreak havoc on Derry. The seven teens from 'It' come home as adults to fulfill their oath of stopping Pennywise. This time, they're: Bev (Chastain), Bill (McAvoy), Richie (Hader), Ben (Ryan), Mike (Mustafa), Eddie (Ransone) & Stanley (Bean). Don't worry - there's plenty of flashbacks so you can recall who's who.Thankfully, there's some humour, thanks to Hader and Ransone, but the others seem to kind of coast through - no one's bad in this, but no one stands out either. Unfortunately, for a film based around his psycho-killer-clown, Pennywise has very little screen time until the final 30min and you kind of forget what his motivation is. Being released so close to the first one, not sure we need so many prompts/reminders. That's the main problem with the film - it's almost an hour too long at 2 hours 50 minutes.The second act where they have to each get a totem could've been done in a 10min montage, not a 45min drawn-out mini-mission for each character. There's a few good CGI bits, some jumps, some gross moments, but nothing truly terrifying. Still, wouldn't want to be watching this is I was under 12. Considering how tongue-in-cheek the film is with it's references to Stephen King and crappy endings, I'm not sure if the ridiculous ending is supposed to be meta, or is just poor.",6,4,17,5 September 2019
"Hail, Caesar!"," OK - just not too much substance
","The premise for 'Hail, Caesar!' sounds more 'meta' than it is - a film studio in the 1950's making a Roman/Jesus epic called 'Hail Caesar' and starring Whitlock (Clooney), the biggest Hollywood star. The film works as a tribute to classic movie-making, with Brolin playing Mannix, the head of 'Capitol Studios', trying to keep his sometime wayward stars in check.The film nails the choreography and massive scale the soundstages had, especially with Johansson's mermaid scene and Tatum's tap-dancing sailor scene. Surprise - he can also sing! Probably the funniest moment is new guy Doyle (Ehrenreich)'s cowboy scene and stunts. Unfortunately, there's no real plot other than Clooney getting kidnapped by kind Communists - doesn't really go anywhere.Fiennes, Johansson, Hill, Tatum & McDormand all don't have enough screen time. The score is good and there's some jokes, although most of them are more like a sly wink to the audience - definitely not the Coen's best work! The score's good and Clooney and Tatum both ham it up, but I definitely felt underwhelmed afterwards.",6,0,0,2 January 2018
Kong: Skull Island," Not horrible, but adds nothing to the King Kong mythology
","With almost no plot - island is hidden by a 'perpetual storm'!?! - not sure why this version of King Kong is set in 1973? At least it's not a direct re-make, but rather a sort of re-imagining. It has a good soundtrack - Stooges, Sabbath, Creedence, Bowie - and a few pretty good action/fight scenes. It's spends 30min introducing most of the characters and seeding a plot, but it seems pointless, since you hardly learn anyone's name. And as for the plot - not sure how it took three people to write this screenplay!There seem to be a lot of shots that were made just for the trailer - zooming into Kong's eyes; Kong in front of giant sun/moon (how can you see either setting, if there's a perpetual storm?); 12 helicopters flying into the storm/sun; Kong slow-mo chest thumping. Kong's obviously not the bad guy, but he's not the star either - probably with less than 30min screen time, as he fights giant lizards. I'm not sure if Packard (Jackson) or Conrad (Hiddleston) is either, since no-one's the hero or has that much to do. Larson is OK, Goodman's wasted, but Marlow (Reilly) saves the day with some almost-humour. At least some of it was filmed in Queensland, although you can tell the bits that were filmed in Hawaii, as it looks like 'Jurassic Park'!Of the three King Kong films I've seen (1933, 2005, 2017), this is probably my least favourite - they seem to be on a slowly-deteriorating scale. Also, what's up with Jackson's right eye near the end? It seems about 75% bigger than his left eye in a few shots! Anyway, predictable ending, nothing ventured, nothing gained. Hard to get too attached to Kong when we have such well-developed CGI characters in the current 'Planet of the Apes' series.",5,0,0,2 January 2018
The Hobbit: The Battle of the Five Armies," Too much going on, but an adequate resolution to this trilogy
","The third - and final - Hobbit film is a valiant attempt to recapture the 'Lord of the Rings' magic of Middle Earth, but too often feels tired and repetitive, especially in the sixth film in the franchise. It's by no means bad, it's just - as with the first two Hobbit films - unnecessarily padded, with lots of flashbacks and scenes of staring into the distance. I'm still not convinced the three Hobbit films couldn't have worked as one cohesive 3 & a bit hour film...Even though the second film featured his name in the title, Smaug (Cumberbatch) is quickly dealt with and the plot hastily progresses to be about the humans - led by Bard (Evans) - tying to move into the Mountain with the Dwarves - led by Thorin (Armitage) & a mostly redundant cameo from Dain (Connolly). To complicate things, the Elves - led by Legolas (Bloom)'s dad - show up too and then the Orcs arrive. By my count, that's four armies. The fifth army never really eventuates... Gandalf (McKellen) & Bilbo (Freeman) are left stuck in the middle of all this.There's some quick appearances from Elrond (Weaving), Galadriel (Blanchett) & Saruman (Lee), which are unnecessary and don't add to the plot. There's some good battle scenes, but nothing to top 'The Two Towers' or 'The Return of the King'. Some mild humour thrown in, but a lot of the film feels bogged down and aware it's 'the defining chapter' or 'the final farewell' as it's been billed.Plenty of frustrating moments - Tauriel (Lilly)'s 'romance' with Kili (Turner), Thorin's 'dragon sickness', the get-out-of-jail-card that the Eagles pose. Despite these, the score is still great, with the use of the familiar motifs still effective and the cinematography beautiful.",7,2,3,2 January 2018
Arrival," Not exceptional, but well-made sci-fi with a twist
","'Arrival' is a different, semi-realistic take on the alien invasion film. It spends a little time introducing us to Louise (Adams), a translator, and then we get to see the UFO that's landed (technically hovering) in Montana. It's one of 12 - she's tasked with opening communications with the aliens. Some great shots of the ships (more like giant smooth rocks) and a good job of showing the different climate/atmosphere in and around them.It's definitely not your typical alien film - there's a lot of tension and build-up, and no big battles or gory moments. Ian (Renner), a theoretical physicist and Colonel Weber (Whitaker) are there to help Louise, but it's pretty much up to her to determine how to communicate with the aliens (or giant squids). The music can be a bit overbearing at times, and the flashbacks seem to interrupt at times, but it all comes together at the end.Didn't blow my mind, but it does delve a little deeper into how the world would realistically handle a potential threat of this magnitude. Would have loved to have seen more of the different perspectives from each site/country. An interesting enough reveal, if not totally unique (I've definitely read it in a novel or two before) and a nice message at its core.",7,0,1,2 January 2018
Parasite," See the potential Oscar-winner before it's spoiled for you!
","'Parasite' is a South Korean family drama/black comedy, with some great acting and a unique premise. It doesn't take long to establish the characters, but does well to give us time to get to know them. It's essentially the tale of two families: the Kim's - Dad Ki-taek (Kang Ho), Mum (Hyae Jin), Son Ki-woo (Woo Shik) & Daughter Ki-jung (So Dam), and the Park's - Dad Dong-ik (Sun Kyun), Mum Yeon-kyo (Yeo Jeong), Son Da-song (Jung) & Daughter Da-hye (Ziso).The Kim's are poor, living in the 'slums', when Ki-woo gets a job tutoring Da-hye at the Park's nice house on the other side of Seoul. Even though there's symmetry in the parents/son/daughter, this isn't an 'Us' scenario, but rather an exploration of class, social status and unconscious biases. There's no 'good guys' or 'bad guys' - just a semi-realistic depiction of one family seeing the greener grass on the other side and taking an unconventional approach to get there.All of the actors are great, with a nice mix of fun and humour, with seriousness and desperation. The twist at the end of the second act is both unexpected and still poses a lot of questions - there's a few different ways it could've played out. Not quite a one-location film, but the house does serve as an extra character. Good score and cinematography. The ending is a fitting mix of bittersweet, devastating and hopeful.",8,9,12,1 February 2020
Birdman or (The Unexpected Virtue of Ignorance)," A curious insight into acting and vanity
","'Birdman' is an interesting film, but also a movie about a Broadway play - not the most invigorating subject. The concept of a former Comic Book Movie Star trying to re-start his acting career on Broadway is certainly unique, and the film has a great look - especially the way it's filmed to look almost as if it's one continuous shot. There's a few laughs, but this is definitely not a comedy.Keaton (Riggan) is great and ably supported by Stone (Sam, his daughter), Norton (Mike - happy to get around in underpants or his birthday suit for most of his scenes) & Watts (Lesley, his co-stars), although Galifianakis is a little wasted. Even though the cinematography is good, the fact it's basically one shot means there's a fair bit of wasted time as we follow characters down hallways. Probably could've been a 100min film, rather than two hours. The other thing I found annoying was the drum/cymbal fills - they're in his mind, but are very distracting.It's essentially about ego and the driving force behind actors. Sure, Riggan is a more delusional character than most actors (hopefully!), driven by his insecurity. As the critic says to him: 'you're not an actor - you're a celebrity'. Burn. The ending is, like the whole film, different, but not completely satisfying.",7,0,0,2 January 2018
The Big Short," Great film - energetic and interesting
","Based on the true story of how the Global Financial Crisis (GFC) came about from 2005-2008, 'The Big Short' tells the story really well by mixing humour, facts (delivered in an unconventional way by celebrities) and following four tenuously-linked groups who have skin in the game. Vennett (Gosling) introduces us at the start of 2005, via a unique fourth-wall-breaking monologue, placing the players on the field - I'm using this terminology, as most of the film (and Wall Street in general) can be likened to gambling. It may sound boring on the surface - a film about banking and finance - but it does a great job of explaining the terminology in simple terms, whilst not being condescending about it.The groups involved are Burry (Bale), a fund manager and prodigy of sorts, who first sees the housing bubble and notices that the big banks have been over-valuing mortgages (sub-prime). Baum (Carell) and his small company are offered the opportunity to 'short' the banks' mortgages by Vennett. Geller (Magaro) & Shipley (Wittrock), two young entrepreneurs, who seek help from their mentor, retired Wall St mogul Rickert (Pitt) also pick up on what' happening and get in on the action. It's great to see the banks gleefully taking their money, being so cocky and greedy, only to have it all blow up in their faces two years later.I think Carell, not Bale, should have been Oscar-nominated for Best Supporting Actor! Baum serves as the film's moral centre and calls everyone on their fraudulent behaviour. The film almost acts as a documentary when it delves down to the individual family level and makes you truly realise how little these large corporations care for other humans. The most bittersweet part is the ending - 'and then the crooks went to jail, Congress brought in reform and the fraudulent system was overhauled - just joking! They didn't go to jail, Congress was lobbied so no reform was passed and the big banks were bailed out by the taxpayers' - funny, sad, and true. Really makes you think, but is also a well-made film with excellent acting.",8,1,2,2 January 2018
Wonder Woman," Great origin story and fun to watch
","'Wonder Woman' is the first good DC film of their attempt to create an extended universe to rival Marvel. It certainly has a livelier and less somber tone than 'Man of Steel' and 'Batman Vs Superman', and works better as an introduction to the character than either of those films. Most of this is down to Gadot, who plays Diana with innocence, as well as integrity and passion. Also, doesn't hurt that she's extremely beautiful. The film does a good job of introducing the Amazons and how their island-home, Themyscira, is hidden from the world.Diana's mum, Queen Hippolyta (Nielsen) has kept her sheltered for her whole life (not certain if the Amazons are immortal, or not...), but this changes when World War I finds them, via Captain Trevor (Pine). Then, Diana's off to the real world to help mankind in their battle against Ares, God of War (a substitute for the Central Powers in WWI). There's plenty of funny moments as Diana is introduced to London in the early 20th century and especially with Trevor, since she's never met a male before. We quickly meet Trevor's rag-tag team and suddenly we're off to Belgium where the action begins and we get to see Wonder Woman in full flight/fight.Ludendorff (Huston) is good as the evil German general, but there's a few similarities with 'Captain America: The First Avenger', as he is basically a 'Red Skull'-substitute, has an offsider who develops weapons of mass destruction, gets super-strength, and then has to fight someone super-strong wearing red and blue. The main difference is that Wonder Woman' is set WWI, but both comic book characters were created in 1941 during WWII. Still, it doesn't really detract for the film, with plenty of great hand-to-hand combat, as well as full-on war scenes. Pretty satisfying conclusion, with Diana's purpose, humour, powers and morals all being set-up nicely for 'Justice League', but works well as a standalone film.",8,1,2,2 January 2018
The Wolverine," Good character development, but nothing too spectacular
","Stays mostly true to the comics and is a decent backstory on Wolverine/Logan, and so much better than 'X-Men Origins: Wolverine'! It's basically set after X-Men 3 and sees Wolverine head to Japan to find peace/reconcile his past.There's a few deviations from the comics - the Silver Samurai & Viper aren't quite done right, but are decent villains - but it's nice to see Mariko & Yukio, and have a less frantic pace for some of the film. The final third is good, but nothing too extraordinary. The whole thing with Wolverine's claws did annoy me a little, though!I'm hoping this links in nicely with 'X-Men: Days of Future Past', where we get to see both sets of X-men!",7,0,0,2 January 2018
Black Panther," Great balance of action, drama and visuals
","'Black Panther' is another solid Marvel film, but thankfully works as a standalone action film and family drama. T'Challa (Boseman) - first introduced in 'Captain America: Civil War' - becomes King of Wakanda (a fictional African country) and has to deal with the dual responsibilities of following traditions, keeping his family and country safe and being the Black Panther (basically Batman - rich guy who can fight good and has a good suit and gadgets). There's a really great support cast - Killmonger (Jordon) as the long-lost cousin, Nakia (Nyong'o) as the ex-girlfriend/conscience, Okoye (Gurira) as his General, Ross (Freeman) as the CIA agent, Klaue (Serkis) as the mercenary, Zuri (Whitaker) as the shaman, Shuri (Wright) as his sister, Ramonda (Bassett) as his mum and W'Kabi (Kaluuya) as his best friend. However, Boseman really carries the film, with a lot of poise and calmness, but then extreme passion when needed. The plot's not too complicated and has an obvious ending, but the 2 & a quarter hours are well worth it.There's plenty of stunning CGI (probably too much, since none of the film was actually shot in Africa, a big shame - feels like if they filmed in South Korea, they could go to Kenya or Zimbabwe for a few real-life shots), a good tribal-drum score, some great action scenes and plenty of hand-to-hand combat scenes too. However, at it's heart is a good story of responsibility and doing what's right over what's easy or the usual way.",8,7,34,15 February 2018
Mother!," Why!?!
","This is a very odd film - it looks great, Lawrence & Bardem are good, but there's no score, it's essentially a bottle episode, with the camera never leaving the house - & almost never leaving Lawrence - and no-one says anyone else's names.It's a little long, with the first 90min slowly getting more & more bizarre as people show up to the house, and you start to create lots of theories as to what's actually happening. There's not really much of a plot other than that.The ending is pretty brutal and absurd and all I'm left thinking at the end is - what was the point?",4,1,1,1 January 2018
Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice," Decent start to the Justice League franchise
","'Batman v Superman's main aim is to set up the two Justice League films coming out in the next three years and combat Marvel's dominance of superhero films. It has the tough job of reintroducing/shoehorning a new Batman (Affleck) into the 'Man of Steel' world (even though the tone's darker, like Nolan's Batman films), with Bruce Wayne driving around Metropolis during Superman (Cavill)'s big fight with General Zod from the previous film. Why? Not sure - he just appears reckless. We also have to see Batman's parents die again - must be at least the third time on film...The film tries to blend together two popular graphic novels - 'The Dark Knight Returns' from the late 80s and 'The Death of Superman' from the early 90s - with varying degrees of success. I wish it had more of the former, but it instead almost makes Lois (Adams) the main star and puts her in the middle of everything. There's heaps of political manoeuvring and 'is Superman a risk or not?' with Lex (Eisenberg) and a Senator Finch (Hunter), but it all takes 90min to set up and there's finally a pay-off, but it leaves a lot of action that needs to be squeezed into the final hour.I didn't like that Gotham was right across the harbour from Metropolis (a la San Francisco & Oakland), rather than hundreds of kilometres distant as it's supposed to be. Batman has a few too many dreams/visions for my liking... However, the score's great, Irons was good as Alfred, but underused, as is Perry (Fishburne). FYI, there's no after credit scene, so don't bother sitting through the extra 5min! When they get to the big Doomsday battle at the end, and Wonder Woman (Godot) joins in, it is pretty exciting and eventful. A good film, just not spectacular.",7,7,9,2 January 2018
Pitch Perfect 3," Fitting finale
","'Pitch Perfect 3' is quite similar to the first two films, revolving around the 'Bellas' a cappella group - although this time they're out of college and dealing with being grown-ups. So when the chance to reunite for one last set of shows arises, playing to US troops in Europe, they all jump at it. Not much more to the plot than that, except for a slight detour with Amy's Dad (Lithgow), which doesn't add a whole lot, except him doing a horrible Aussie accent.There's some crap songs and a few decent ones, but they always make them interesting to watch/listen to and the film always has plenty to keep it's momentum up - Beca (Kendrick) obviously getting the most screen time and a satisfying conclusion. Amy (Wilson) has a good number of funny lines and Chloe (Snow) has a bit more to do, and the other seven each get a few moments to shine.I still wish there was more of Elizabeth Banks & John Michael Higgins as the commentators/documentary-makers, but they're still great in every scene they're in. It's all predictable, but nonetheless uplifting and all about being there for your friends and following your dreams, while still being fun enough.",6,1,3,1 January 2018
Thor: The Dark World," Another decent superhero film, which is entertaining enough, even if it sometimes tries a little too hard to be something it's not.
","'Thor: The Dark World' (or 'Thor 2') is another solid entry into the Marvel Universe - it's not the best superhero film, nor is it the worst. I'm glad they've kept the cast together and hopefully Marvel can do this across all their franchises, as it gives them a bit of authenticity. It's fun to see how they link some of the threads back to 'The Avengers', particularly with Dr Erik Selvig (Skarsgård).Now, I don't know who out there actually loves Thor, because he's certainly one of my least favourite Marvel characters, especially in the comics, as he's so rigid and boring and never does anything too exciting. He's certainly no Wolverine or Spiderman. And that's the film's biggest hurdle - how to make Thor and the story interesting for 110min. It sort-of achieves this... I know it's mostly set in Asgard, a different realm, but even then there are still a few things which stretch credibility:
<ul><li>Why do the 'Dark Elves of Svartalfheim' wear puppet masks? And why do they want to destroy the universe and - presumably - themselves?</li><li>What exactly is the 'Ether'? It's not just an alkaline chemical...</li><li>Where exactly is the 'Dark World'? Is it on Asgard, or is it another realm? Is it different to the 'Limbo' dimension?</li><li>Is Benicio Del Toro actually needed at the end of the film?</li><li>Why is Asgard so poorly defended?</li><li>Why does the final confrontation take place on Earth, where the Dark Elves can be easily found? And why can't the other Avengers - or the Fantastic Four, or the X-Men - help? Especially if the future of the universe is at stake? Seems unlikely S.H.I.E.L.D. would leave this up to Thor by his lonesome...</li></ul>One of the big saving graces is some of the witty laughs provided by Chris O'Dowd and Kat Dennings (plus Stan Lee's patented cameo!). There's some expertly timed quips thrown in, which add some levity to what could easily become quite a cumbersome story. I think that Hopkins was pretty wasted as Odin, Hemsworth has some decent moments as Thor, but Hiddleston as Loki once again almost steals the show, because even though you may hate him, he's often so likable! A great character to hold this part of the Marvel Universe together.",7,1,1,2 January 2018
Lucy," Not horrible, but certainly not a memorable sci-fi film
","How best to explain 'Lucy'? I'm not really sure - my best bet is 'Limitless' crossed with 'The Matrix', but without the best bits from either! Basically, Lucy (Johansson) gets involved in a drug ring in Taipei and it just so happens the drugs 'unlock' the full potential of her brain. The biggest flaw of the film is right there - it's based on the urban myth that humans only use 10% of their brain power. We may not always use 100%, but we certainly use more than 10% for the majority of the time!The best bits are the amazing car scene in Paris, the intercut footage (cheetahs, dinosaurs and other bits of nature) and Morgan Freeman. Unfortunately, that's more than counterbalanced by the fact that the film struggles to make 90min, has a lack of actual action/excitement has a huge cop-out ending and Johansson acts like a robot, which is apparently what a hyper-evolved human would be like?!?Considering Besson made 'The Fifth Element' - one of the more fun, inventive Sci-Fi films of the last 20 years - it's a shame this film is neither fun, nor original. I definitely think the filmmakers thought they were being far more philosophical than they actually ended up being.",5,1,5,2 January 2018
Star Wars: Episode VII - The Force Awakens," A soon-to-be-classic entry in the greatest film series of all time!
","It's finally here - something that some fans have been waiting 32 years for! (Although the last theatrically-released Star Wars film, 'The Clone Wars', only came out seven years ago). Since I wasn't born until after 'Return of the Jedi' and grew up watching them on VHS and am a pretty big fan, the sequel trilogy (as opposed to the prequel trilogy) and 'The Force Awakens' has long been hoped for.OK, let's see if I can do a vague storyline with no spoilers... 30 years after the Battle of Endor, Han (Ford) is the first 'original' we're reintroduced to - well, technically Stormtroopers are, followed by the Millennium Falcon. But first, we meet Poe (Issac), an X-Wing pilot for 'the Resistance' (the new Rebel Alliance); BB8, a ball-like droid; Finn (Boyega), a former Stormtrooper; and Rey (Ridley), a scavenger, barely surviving on the desert world of Jakku (which plays a role in the 'Lost Stars' novel, well worth a read!). BB8 holds some important data and needs to get it to Leia (Fisher), before the 'First Order' (the new Empire) and Kylo Ren (Driver) get it, so they can all find Luke (Hamill). The only ones missing are Lando & Wedge.It feels like a lot has changed, but also not much at all - it truly feels like the original Star Wars universe, with plenty of new aliens, spaceships and droids, but also plenty of old ones. Abrams has definitely nailed the tone, with plenty of adventure and zest, and also some humour and drama. The pace rarely sags and it doesn't feel like two & a bit hours, but nor does it try to cram too much in. It's not exactly a carbon copy of 'A New Hope', but definitely borrows a lot of themes from it.Some questions are answered, but are lot are left unanswered, so the anticipation remains for the next films. While the film is definitely a great movie - and far better than any of the prequels - I sometimes didn't feel as if as much was at stake as it was in the originals and a few things didn't sit 100% right, also probably a by-product of my high expectations. Still, Ridley & Boyega are both very good to watch and valuable additions, and Driver's intriguing - I look forward to watching their characters grow in Episodes VIII and IX.",8,1,6,2 January 2018
Unbroken," Astonishing true story told in enjoyable fashion
","'Unbroken' is a great film, helped immensely by the fact it's based on an almost-unbelievable true story. Laura Hillenbrand's novel was one of the best I've read in the last three years and while the movie isn't quite as great (they never are!), the story of Louis Zamperini (O'Connell)'s extremely eventful life from 1936-1945 truly needs to be seen to be believed. Quick synopsis: he learns to run, goes to the Olympics, joins the U.S. Air Force during WWII, is shot down, stranded at sea (for seven weeks!), eventually captured by the Japanese and spends over two years in a POW camp. Sounds impossible, but what's more astonishing is that he then went on to live for another 70 years!Jolie's directing debut is solid, with some nice transitions from the current to his past and the narrative moving along at a good pace for the first 90min. my one issue with the film is that the final 45min or so drag a little, as although there's plenty going on during his time in the POW camps (i.e. mostly inhumane torture), the film seems to lose a bit of it's spark. Brisbane/Moreton Bay does a good job of standing in for the South Pacific too!This is not so much a film about war, as about survival, courage and hope. There's so many times when he could have just given in and let all the terrible things happening to him defeat him, but he doesn't. It's truly amazing to know it actually happened! The ending is handled well and the actors - particularly Ishihara as the psychopathic 'Bird' - are solid.",8,1,2,2 January 2018
Godzilla," A decent reboot attempt, but not good enough to have me anticipating any potential sequels
","Did I like the new 'Godzilla' film, the first in 16 years? I really wanted to, but while there's some good aspects, they're counterbalanced by plenty of bad things. First, the 'storyline' - two MUTO ('Massive Unidentified Terrestrial Organism')'s are awakened (why now?) and converge on San Francisco (why there?). Godzilla shows up to fight them (why?).It sounds like it could be a good version of 'Pacific Rim' - and while it's cool to see the giant CGI monsters, you don't actually get to see enough action/battle scenes. The major failing is the characters - you spend an hour with Taylor-Johnson & his Dad (Cranston) before you even see Godzilla! Despite that, there's still very little character development and you just plain don't care what happens to them or the other human characters. It definitely needed more of Watanabe. Also, there's a ridiculous number of coincidences how Taylor-Johnson/Kick-Ass keeps showing up in the right/wrong place.One of the major unexplained situations is where did Godzilla come from, and if they knew he existed, where has he been for 60 years? Hibernating on the ocean floor? And why does he want to battle the MUTO - for food? Apparently not! Therefore, what does he eat to sustain his giant bulk? The other major annoying thing for me was the stupidity of the humans - hey, these MUTO love nuclear energy, so let's try to destroy them with a nuclear weapon! Or they can emit electromagnetic pulses - let's keep flying planes & helicopters near them, surely they won't crash! Anyway, on a positive note, you do see some of Godzilla for the final 30min (but not enough) and he does, thankfully, have flame-breath.",6,0,0,2 January 2018
Deadpool," Fun, bloody and funny - could be the Marvel film of the year!
","'Deadpool' is this year's 'Guardians of the Galaxy' - a non-mainstream Marvel film with offbeat humour that's really well made. And the soundtrack's good, but not as excellent as the aforementioned film. Deadpool's story is a simple one, really - mostly because it's pretty much identical to Wolverine's origin story: ex-soldier thinks he's not a hero, even though he helps others, gets experimented on and turned into a freak, tries to win back his loved one. That being said - this is much better than 'X-Men Origins: Wolverine', and even 'The Wolverine'. Still, there's a few throwbacks to the former, which featured Reynolds as a non-masked Deadpool, and a few nice winks to Hugh Jackman.The film starts excellently, with a fantastic super slow-motion shot, and has the funniest titles sequence I think I've ever seen. The film then does a good job of flashing back to fill us in on how Wade Wilson (Reynolds) became Deadpool - helped by some appropriate fourth-wall breaking. We're introduced to Vanessa (Baccarin - who looks a lot like Famke Janssen from the original 'X-Men'), the love of his life, and Weasel (Miller) his best friend. They both play good supporting parts, particularly some of Miller's lines which are dryly hilarious. It's also good to see Marvel try to take back some of their X-Men characters from Fox (which is acknowledged with tongue in cheek), with Colossus (Kapicic) being portrayed excellently - a naive Russian with a pure heart, trying to get Deadpool to join the X-Men. He's helped by the new character, Negasonic (Hildebrand) - and the taxi-driver (Soni) in two great scenes.The bad guys, Francis (Skrein) & Angel (Carano), are adequate and move the plot along. The ending's good and I hope they make more, because the fight scenes are done excellently, the humour and jokes are 100% adult-only and totally fitting. Reynolds nails it as the 'Merc with a mouth', with great timing and nuance from under his mask, and he does a great job of not being the pretty-boy when needed. This film makes me hope they get around to doing a Gambit film at some stage - and I'm now interested to see how 'Doctor Strange' turns out later in the year...",8,1,2,2 January 2018
Kingsman: The Secret Service," Very fun action comedy
","'Kingsman' is fun - it's a modern take on action/adventure save-the-world films and while it pays homage to the Bond films, it isn't a direct knock-off of them. The director Vaughn also 'rebooted' superhero films recently ('X-Men: First Class' & 'Kick Ass') and is helped ably by this film being based on another Mark Millar (Wanted, Kick Ass, Secret Service) graphic novel, which means you're guaranteed excessive violence and unexpected plot twists. I hope they keep turning his graphic novels into films!Like any good spy movie, it starts with a ridiculous 'evil genius' - Valentine (Jackson, with a hilarious lisp & wardrobe) - plan: use a neurotransmitter to make people homicidally violent and wipe out the majority of the human race to save the planet from climate change. Then comes the secret spy agency that no government even knows about - the Kingsmen, led by Arthur (Caine). Their top agent Galahad/Harry (Firth, great to see him playing against type) who recruits Eggsy (newcomer Egerton) and we get to see him go through trials until he becomes a 'gentleman Kingsman'. Some very nice suits, gadgetry and locations are used to impress that 'manners maketh the man'. There are quite a few differences between the film and the graphic novel, but they don't detract from what is a simple, well-made, fast-paced action film, with plenty of wit and comedy thrown in for good measure. All the actors are great and Jackson seems to relish being the crazy villain. I hope there's sequels to follow! The 'fireworks' scene at the end is exceptional & hilarious. Also - only nine months until we get to see Mark Hamill again!",8,1,1,2 January 2018
John Wick: Chapter 2," Fast and violent fun
","'John Wick: Chapter 2' is a sequel I didn't think they were going to make, but it is actually better than the first, if only because they now know what to do more and less of. It starts directly after the first film, but Wick (Reeves) now has a new dog. The initial car chase scene in New York is a pretty great way to start the film. Wick's still the same - brooding, wearing a suit, saying maybe 100 words in the whole 2 hours and killing people left, right and centre.The plot, as much as there is one, is that Santino D'Antonio (Scamarcio) - some Italian mafia guy - wants Wick to kill his sister, so he's off to Rome to mess stuff up. This starts a long-running battle with fellow hitman Cassian (Common), which has some funny moments and some good fights.I liked that there's a sort of 'Kingsman'-like global hitmen underground, but it does seem a little far-fetched most of the time, especially since there's apparently hundreds of them! The film definitely needed to use Fishburne, McShane and Leguizamo more. But Reeves carries it, running around and killing at least 50 bad guys. The scene at the end in the museum is really well done too. Nothing new or exceptional, but well-made.",7,0,1,2 January 2018
Incredibles 2," Another excellent, fun animated superhero outing
","'Incredibles 2' is the long-awaited (14 years!) sequel to one of Disney-Pixar's best films. Bucking the norm, this film is actually better than the original - it's more assured, the CGI is fantastic, the action scenes almost flawless and there's plenty of humour and life-like family interaction. That being said - it's almost worth the entry fee to see the short film at the start, 'Bao' - it's also hilarious, and poignant.It's like putting on an old shirt - it's familiar, but comforting and not tired. Mr Incredible/Bob (Nelson), Elastigirl/Helen (Hunter), their kids - Violet (Vowell), Dash (Milner) & Jack-Jack (Fucile) - are back as the super-powered family, along with Frozone/Lucius (Jackson). This time, after a 'Civil War'-like ban on superheroes is implemented, philanthropists/siblings Winston (Odenkirk) & Evelyn (Keener) campaign to have superheroes made legal again by putting them - well, Elastigirl - back in the spotlight. Odenkirk's voice is so recognisable and his character even looks like a young Saul Goodman! As well as being a bit of a pastiche of comic book films - you basically have Superman, Mr Fantastic, Invisible Woman, The Flash and Iceman - 'Incredibles 2' transcends the parody, and plays as an exceptional superhero film in it's own right, with the set-up, early victory, apparent loss and inevitable triumph due to teamwork. What makes it all work is how they interact and make it feel like a real family. Jack-Jack being cute and having hilarious giggles also helps! Great for all ages.",8,5,15,14 June 2018
Spectre," Does what a Bond film should
","'Spectre' is the 24th Bond film and Daniel Craig's fourth - and final - outing as 007. Is not the best Bond, but nor is it the worst. It does play a lot on nostalgia and the villains/plots (Spectre) of the Moore/Connery eras. It has a lot of classic Bond attributes going for it: worldwide locations (Mexico, Italy, Austria, Morocco), great cars & car chases, plane/helicopter stunts, some sly humour, martinis, explosions and disobeying orders, but it also feels a little tired in places.The plot does well to link in aspects of 'Casino Royale', 'Quantum of Solace' and 'Skyfall', but doesn't really offer much of a driving force, as does Blofeld (Waltz)'s motive as the villain - it's there, but poorly articulated and Waltz is not fully utilised as well as he could be, which is a shame, since we know he can be a great bad guy ('Inglorious Basterds' & 'Django Unchained'). Swann (Seydoux) is also adequate, but never 100% convincing.There's probably too many 'down'/slow moments in a 2 & a half hour film, but at times the score - or lack of, before it kicks back in - is excellent. Q (Whishaw) and M (Fiennes) are both good and get a bit more screen time than usual. The fight scenes are well done and there's plenty of action, but I'm interested to see who the next Bond is - and hope they give us four or five years to anticipate it.",7,1,2,2 January 2018
Mad Max: Fury Road," Exciting action/pursuit film. Beware driving after watching - 'road rage' is a given!
","'Mad Max: Fury Road' doesn't - to the best of my recollection - pick up from where the third film ended, which is fine, seeing as 'Beyond Thunderdome' came out the year I was born! I don't recall too many specifics from the original trilogy, other than it was a post-apocalyptic desert (Australian) wasteland and motorcycle and car gangs reigned supreme. 'Fury Road' keeps that tradition alive - at its core, it is a road/chase film, and is relentless throughout with everything it does, from the scenery, soundtrack, stunts, cars, violence and explosions.The over-the-top-ness serves the film well, though - much in the same way '300' was hyper-visualised, this is the same, but instead of heaps of slow-motion, some of it is sped up, keeping the pace of the chase buzzing. It also has the same silly-ness, in that none of it is remotely realistic, but it all works within the universe the film inhabits (except for where all the fuel comes from!). Miller must've dreamt up most of the car/truck hybrids when he was a kid - and kudos to him for making them a reality, especially the pole-swinging guys and the main rig - certainly great to watch.Hardy is satisfactory as Max (there's not many lines for the brooding hero) and Theron is good as the vengeful Furiosa, trying to protect a group of women from the evil Emperor (or whatever his name is - played by Keays-Byrne, with Billy Connolly hair). Not sure why Hardy had to have a Bane-like face covering for some of the film, after 'The Dark Knight Rises' - detracted a bit from the film. Favourite bit - the guitarist on the front of the truck! Loved how the drums and his riffs only came to the fore when the camera panned to them.",8,1,2,2 January 2018
Hacksaw Ridge," Excellent and unique the war film
","'Hacksaw Ridge' (sounds like a good horror movie!) is a World War II film that does an admirable job of spending almost half the film in America, before they even ship off to Japan to fight. This gives us plenty of time to meet Desmond Doss (Garfield) and his family and find out how/why he ticks. He decides he can't sit by why others go off to defend America, but he also conscientiously objects to killing another human, so can't use any weapons. Big moral dilemma and the film deals with it well. It also gives us time to care about some of the other characters in the unit, so we know who's who when the fighting starts.It's kind of amazing Mel Gibson has only directed five films, considering two of them (Braveheart' and 'Apocalypto') are classics - with this film soon to join them. He could turn into the next Eastwood... He also knows his way around a war film, having been in 'Gallipoli', 'Air America' and 'We Were Soldiers', so it's no surprise 'Hacksaw Ridge' is handled expertly. It's nice to see him populate the film with quality Australian actors (it was filmed in Sydney) - Weaving as Doss' dad, Griffiths as his mum, Worthington as his Captain, Palmer as his girlfriend, Nable as a Lieutenant, Bracey as his nemesis and Roxburgh as the Colonel.When they do arrive at Okinawa, Japan, obviously all hells breaks loose, with some great shots of the artillery explosions, then the chaos of bullets, grenades and blood - certainly no punches pulled when it comes to the body count or the gore shown. The scenes with Doss rescuing dozens of his injured comrades from the battlefield are astounding. Garfield really shines as Doss and it hits home how much of a hero he was - highlighting that there's always room for some good in the harsh world.",8,0,0,2 January 2018
Sully," Well-made, well-acted true story
","'Sully' is the biopic of Captain Chesley Sullenberger (Hanks) and his First Officer, Jeff Skiles (Eckhart) who had to land their plane in New York's Hudson River in 2009, after both engines failed directly after take-off. Even though it was all over within five minutes, the film does a great job of exploring a bit of what happened before, a lot of what happened directly after and plenty of the investigation. It's edited well, so it's not all chronological.Surprisingly, this is Eastwood & Hanks' first collaboration, and they're both in good touch here - Hanks is the no-nonsense, but relatable soon-to-be-retired pilot, Eckhart is the slightly-younger and more enthusiastic co-pilot and Eastwood keeps the narrative flowing and never allows it to get too boring, technical or bogged down in the passenger's experiences. Linney is sparingly used as Sully's wife Lorraine, and Porter (O'Malley) is head of the NTSB investigation - essentially the 'bad guy'.The film works as an investigation/mystery, casting some doubt, but also has plenty of tension and action showing the actual crash and aftermath. While it's not sad per se, it did almost bring a tear to my eye in some parts, as it is a feel-good film at its heart, with 'this is some good news that New York really needed - especially when involving a plane' really hitting home.",8,3,4,2 January 2018
Alien: Covenant," Can't give it too low a score, because we still get to see Aliens killing humans, but not great either
","'Alien: Covenant' is number 6 or 8 in the franchise, depending if you count the 'Alien Vs Predator' films, or not. It's a sequel to 'Prometheus', but a prequel to the original four 'Alien' films. Confusing? It doesn't matter too much, but Fassbender as the cyborg, Walter, links this film to 'Prometheus', where he was David. As such, he plays a large role in the plot, which is similar to all that has gone before - in the 22nd century, the crew is awoken from their 'hyper-sleep' early by a mini-disaster and decide to stop on a nearby plant. What could possibly go wrong?I'm not really sure what Ridley Scott was going for here (only his third film in the franchise) - a mix of 'Alien' and 'Aliens', since it involves a bit of action on a planet, but also the final scenes trapped on a ship. Unfortunately, it's not done as well as either of those films. It takes over 40min for anything to happen, but because there's 15 characters, we don't get to learn much about them - just that Oram (Crudup) is the captain, Daniels (Waterson) his second-in-command and Tennessee (McBride) is the comic relief, that doesn't get any jokes - and that it's unlikely more than 20% of them will survive.The film could've done more to explore the 'Creators' that were set-up in 'Prometheus', but it's only alluded to a little, with a slight twist being revealed. Both 'twists' aren't that shocking, and while there's some good gore, there's no truly scary or tense moments. I almost wish they went a little less serious with it. I thought the finished about three times before it did end, and left me asking if it was necessary?",6,0,1,2 January 2018
The Martian," Great, realistic, space adventure
","'The Martian' is based on Andy Weir's excellent novel - one of my favourite books from last year. It's a very simple concept - in the near-future, a manned-mission to Mars goes awry and Mark Watney (Damon) is presumed dead, as the rest of the team returns to Earth. However, rumours of Watney's demise were exaggerated and he just manages to survive, only to be faced with the conundrum of how to stay alive on a freezing planet with almost no food, water or oxygen until he can be rescued?It's beautifully shot, with Jordan a good stand-in for Mars on most occasions, and the CGI doing the rest. And there's obviously a few shots of Earth from space - always a great perspective to see. Scott directs well, with the pacing good, and time spread across the strong cast - Chastain, Peña, Mara, Stan and Hennie on the spaceship home; and Daniels, Ejifor, Bean and Wiig at NASA - showing how everyone involved deals with the initial tragedy and then attempted rescue mission(s).However, the film belongs to Damon, who has to use all his charm and skills to make one man talking to a video journal interesting. The film's possibly 15min or so too long, but luckily, it's a great book & a good screenplay, so there's plenty of levity to go along with the serious life-or-death/fingernail-chewing moments. Tense/great final 25min or so. Never quite reaches the heights of the book, but comes very close.",8,0,1,2 January 2018
