Hereditary," If you didn't feel the evil, you missed the point
","This was a horrifyingly brilliant movie. If the movie didn't leave you feeling bleak, a bit disturbed and maybe feeling like you need a shower, you were NOT paying attention. This film feels evil. It is filmed in the darkest atmosphere, and gives off a tone of disturbing solitude and fear.Even without the supernatural story line, this movie would still have been a disturbing and incredibly depressing, yet clever movie about a family in a state of decay through a series of horrific events. That's the scariest part of this movie. No, it's not a horror movie, but the movie IS horrifiying. Finally, something worth watching! I need to watch it again.",9,3,6,16 September 2018
John Wick," John Wick is the slowest assassin ever
","John Wick is a film like HUNDREDS of others based on a retired assassin efficiently dispatching nameless thugs in the quest to save a loved one or to exact revenge. John Wick is a parody of all of them.Over the top, yet barely pushing a boundary, the terrible fight choreography is too laughable to watch through without groaning and the Russian accents are embarrassing to listen to.For a film based on heavy violence and fight scenes, John Wick somehow moves slower than an old man. In fact, Liam Neeson in 'Take a Commuter Cold Walk All Night In The Tombstones' moves faster. The John Wick fight scenes are like watching a senior fumble around with another old man while said old man barely makes an attempt to fight back. Some scenes the thugs actually pause before throwing a blow just so Keanu Reeves can catch up and block it. It's pretty painful.While it is still a relatively fun movie, it's hard to tell if it's 'so bad it's good'. Or that it's so bad it's hard to look away? Either way, use a silencer John. You're the clumsiest, loudest and slowest assassin I've ever seen.Just an fyi, if people started demanding higher quality films from Hollywood by not paying for this insulting trash - you would get a decent assassin movie. Instead, we get Liam Neeson in Taken 7 or Keanu Reeves in John Wick 5.",4,4,5,19 April 2020
Us," feast on scraps
","Just sort of 'meh'.The 'tethered' doppelg√§ngers arn't fully explained and that's the major problem that you just CAN NOT over look here. It's completely unacceptable that Peele didn't bother to fathom up a background that would give this movie a reason.We're expected to care about these one dimensional characters, and even more so, we're expected to root for either version. While some parts are creepy, it's creepy just for the sake of being creepy. We don't know why the doubles act the way they do and aside from a brief and flippant explanation to their existence, we are really just given scraps of a story and expected to feast.So why should we care? By the end of the movie, we don't.",4,4,6,27 May 2019
Aquaman," Cheese fest
","Each comic book movie that is made is worse than the last. Aquaman is no exception. I couldn't wait for this film to end. Purple lights underwater do not make for 'amazing visuals' and amazing visuals do not make up for characters no one cares about.From some of the worst acting in a movie with this kind of budget, cheesiest dialogue and even cheesier soundtrack, to unfunny one-liners and horrible CGI and action sequences - this is a stink fest.The film's lead is Jason Mamoa - I'm thinking that's awesome - a hero with an edge. Nope, he's as cheesy as Arnold in Kindergarten Cop. BUT in order for us to think he has an edge- he says 'bad ass' like 50 times, so I guess that's all it takes.Cliche after cliche make this film completely and utterly cringeworthy. Let's look at the never ending list:Hero doesn't want to be hero but constantly does hero things even tho they don't want to be a heroSuperhero as a child is bullied only to use his powers to thwart said bullies.News panel of guests argue over a super hero's existenceBoy without mother asks why said mother doesn't love him. (the only
conclusion drawn by a movie character missing a parent)Man pulls woman to safety - they take notice of body contact and act awkwardly.Woman accidentally falls, man catches her, holds her (cuz that's what they do) as they look longingly into each other's eyes before being interrupted.People actually yell 'aaahhhh' when falling.People actually yell 'ooh eee aw' when landing from a fallVillian to hero: 'I've been waiting for this day to come'Cliche rooftop chase sceneHero saves random child from falling object. Only thing missing there was a mother yelling 'my baby! my baby!'I could go on and on...but Marvel and DC have stolen too much of my time already. Never will I watch a comic book movie again - and hopefully this production line way of making movies will also stop. Let's, as an audience start demanding more from our entertainment. Seriously.",1,8,12,28 January 2019
Underworld Awakening," fixing things that arnt broken
","While the Underworld movies are a fun romp, Awakening was the beginning of the end for me.Removing Scott Speedman to focus on the mother daughter relationship (claims director) is hard to swallow considering the presence of more-supermodel-than-actor, Theo James. Instead of carrying on the Micheal/Seline relationship, they muddle it by adding an annoying child who happens to have been born with an English Accent even though she's been raised by mostly American scientists.Film makers need to remember that audiences are watching films to escape their own children, they don't want to watch someone else's bratty child whom just gets in the way of an action/adventure plot more than add to it.(re: Zack - The Strain, Carl - TWD, Newt - Aliens, Dawn- BtVS).The other problem with this addition, is the abandonment of the werewolves of the last three films and in its place are bad CGI weredogs.Sometimes trying to one-up every addition isn't needed in a collection like this.",6,1,1,20 May 2019
Bird Box," Ignore the plausibility
","I thought it was really well done. The story is gripping enough from beginning to end and music by Trent Reznor really led to a darker theme.I thought it was much more mysterious than A Quiet Place, and a lot less irritating.People seem to have a problem when a movie isn't in your face, but the real problem that we have is that we have lost our ability to use our imagination. As soon as a film shows what is terrorizing us - the movie immediately loses its bleakness, its mystery and its watchability. We don't NEED to see what the terror is - imagine it yourself. What you could conjure up in your mind would be way better than anything Hollywood can feed you anyway. I would hope.While the plausibility of how people are getting around without being able to open their eyes is really a difficult hurdle for viewers to get over.....just do that. Get over it.Sandra Bullock was exceptional. Paulson wasn't in it enough. Malkovich was perfect. Even the child actors held their own.I was pleasantly suprised from this, a Netflix original. Ignore some of the plausibility and Bird Box is actually a fantastically intense and dark end of days movie!",7,1,3,23 December 2018
Hansel & Gretel: Witch Hunters," so much fun
","I don't know how you could not have fun watching this movie.It's a movie about witch hunting fairy tales - complaining that the plot or dialogue is sub-par or cliche means you really had no business watching it in the first place.Everything is done tongue-in-cheek and the film doesn't take itself seriously at all. For a viewer to take this film so seriously means they missed the whole point while looking down their nose at it from their sofa.The sets and styles remind me of the beginning of Hocus Pocus - and no one hated that movie. ;)The witches look fantastic, the action is packed and the story is fun.We need a franchise.",8,3,4,12 March 2019
54," pretentious bad reviews
","I was perplexed as to why this film had such a bad rating and then I read some of the below 5 star reviews - and they are so pretentious and long winded. So that makes sense, people took this film so seriously they had to write 6 paragraphs about it for some reason.This film is sexy, dirty and questions sexual labels. The characters are young, high and utterly confused. They're trapped in a toxic environment because of the money they're making and they're slowly self imploding and grabbing at eachother. If you've ever worked in this industry in your 20's - you'd get it. Then add in unlimited drugs, this type of money, and exclusivity and you have an intense demolition in the making. Studio 54 was an even crazier time than any club to exist after, so I can only imagine.I've definitely known almost every type of character in this movie and although it's filmed in a very 90's way, it is still deserving of a 7+ rating.",9,1,1,9 March 2019
It Follows," a nightmare we've all had
","The idea of something following you that won't stop, something slow and terrifying is what nightmares are made of.We've all had the dreams where nothing really makes sense, you try to run but you feel like your feet are stuck in mud, or you try to talk and you feel like your mouth is full of marbles.That's what this movie feels like. That's what this movie is supposed to be.And added bonus is the 80's synth perfection.",8,2,2,21 April 2019
Donnie Brasco," It's no Good Fella's
","It's a great movie, but regardless, it still has that slight feeling of a Scorsese rip off. It's just missing something.Some of the film feels disjointed and unnecessary. It lacks a certain smoothness.Regardless, the story, actors and plot are engaging and likeable enough to warrant a few watches - if you like gangster movies.",6,2,3,26 November 2019
Joker," psychology and thought provocation
","My only problem with this superb retelling of the Joker origin...is that it was about the Joker. While it may have added a dimension and an audience the film would not have had otherwise, it really could have been a film about anyone. I actually felt the Bruce Wayne story line was the worst part of the film.A very dark and grittier idea reminiscent of 'Falling Down', Joker has Arthur mugged, fired from his job and beat up by drunk guys. As the theory goes, if Arthur was mugged, beat up but NOT fired - would he be the Joker? If he was fired but NOT mugged or beat up - would he be the Joker? What sequence would have a different out come?The psychology and thought provocation in this film is the uncredited co-star along side Joaquin's Arthur Fleck.",8,4,5,26 November 2019
It Chapter Two," totally uninteresting
","From start to finish, IT Chapter Two is completely uninteresting.Bill Hader is obnoxiously stupid. He acts like a child the whole time while regurgitating jokes from the first chapter, delivered at unrealistic moments. They don't land anyway since we've heard them all before in the first chapter.The soundtrack is over the top at times.Half of the film is flashbacks that no one needed. Again, we all saw the first movie.And the most tragic of all: the heavy and unnecessary use of CGI completely robs all terror Bill Skarsgaard's IT had in the first film.I am wholly shocked and disappointed.",4,9,13,14 October 2019
