Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," Extremely good!!!
","I enjoyed the movie very much! the phantom menace was much funnier then the episode 4,5 and 6, Jar Jar Binks added the comic element, that was lacking in the previous movies. And what surprised me, was, not one swear through the whole movie!! That was a big plus!! :) The plot was great, the affects were awesome. And over all, I would recommend this movie very highly.",10,0,0,20 June 1999
