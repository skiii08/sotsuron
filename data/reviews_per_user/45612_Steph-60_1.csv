Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," Excellent for the first episode, but some of the foolishness could be left out.
","I really enjoyed this movie, and I liked that it had a sense of humor. However, some of the silly stuff could have been left out. Also, too much was left to chance. But, now I can't wait to see how they turn Anikin to the dark side.",8,0,1,19 May 1999
