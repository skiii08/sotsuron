Captain Phillips," My rating: 9
","Tensed documentary real case presented in a movie. Diverse plot compared to what is out from the big screen recently. Sometimes even that is enough. Not in this case.Unpleasant adventure of cargo boat and his crew. With unpredictable end. The real end of a true story showing the absurd world we are living in. Unprotected cargo for millions of dollars floating with unprotected crew and not very maneuverable and fast ship. The reaction of the signals of help is ill-timed. The big army potential of the State is showed not when was necessarily to prevent the harm but in the end of the story. Would be the same if the used it in the beginning? To me, the captain could wait with the signal flares and use them when the pirate's boat is next his ship. Also he could escape with diving deeper and emerging more far. But all this is real story so it can not be a critic to the movie. We can also hardly accuse those kidnappers who were forced to act and were constantly saying 'all good Irish, all good.' Tensed action with a thrill till the end. We saw a lot from the secrets of the craft of arming and their new toys (drones, night vision, tactics). When we add too all said another my favorite actor – as people say, who can act every role, the male Maryl Strip – the result is really good.http://vihrenmitevmovies.blogspot.com/",9,0,1,22 January 2014
Citizen Kane," My rating: 8
","Through all movies this is the score which I give to this one. For its time he deserves more. But we are in other moment of the time/space continuum.Most probably every one of us had period in his life in which he wanted to be very rich. To be famous and known from everybody. To wealth and fame we can add the utopian idea this character to be noble, selflessness, robinhoodian. And what is the price for this when it really happen? This movie shows the life of Charles Kane, personification of the mentioned image above. He, from flash and bones, lived in the beginning of the previous century. Torn apart from his native home and his parents, the real things which he has are friendship and love. But they could not fill the opened wound.About this - what we want and what we receive, how much our life is our property and about the value of the material goods. This movie intrigue with setting an aim which is pursued till its end. Shown as stories of different characters, documentary restores the portrait of the protagonist and the main story.http://vihrenmitevmovies.blogspot.com/",8,1,2,15 August 2013
Ed Wood," My rating: 6
","Despite the good play of Johnny Depp and even the better of the older actor, the film is quite slow. And on top - black and white. The story takes us to the early years of the last century in Hollywood. Young director looking for a way to break into show business using every opportunity to do it. Accidentally introduced to adult actor, former celebrity but current addict. (although nice image). After many difficulties which they experience together - several unsuccessful films, the separation of the young director with his girlfriend and finding new one, the young director manages to make a film about the lives of everyone around him and the process of filming movies. So he became director of the protagonist in the film.This movie shows how important it is to not give up on what you want to do, regardless of how old you are. The road is not all easy, but you always can find collaborators who will help you and who will believe in you. The movie hints the moment in which everyone has an oddity that must simply be accepted, because it makes him exactly the way he is. Ultimately all ranks well.http://vihrenmitevmovies.blogspot.com/",6,1,5,30 July 2013
About Time," My rating: 8
","One of those movies that makes me begin writing while it is not over yet. A movie that I was told of from a very good and beautiful person. A movie, in contrast of all other movies coming from the big screen, that can not receive low rating. There should be more like it even if they are strongly idealistic.The protagonist had a poster of 'Amelie' (very good one too) in his room and I hope that it was his sister's room. If you know what I mean. And what happened with this guy he never grew old – obviously that is the meaning, we have to be more what we are in our best moments.Modest at first sight, this movie showed the important things in life and it reminded us that we always can be more good, we have to bet on the positive and graduating in life, that there are moments which we have only once in our lifetime and we should be gentle with the similar moments to them every time when they happen, to notice the little things in life, that we have to try to make our ordinary days extraordinary. Lot of commas, a? It is like this, life is a continuing comma with a small final full stop in the end.http://vihrenmitevmovies.blogspot.com/",8,3,4,9 January 2014
The Best Years of Our Lives," My rating: 9
","I am far from thinking that I would be among the first who had written about this film which is for people more likely to be fond of the old cinema, history and culture.After a strong start we are moved in slowly gripping deposited life. The best years of which have been mixed due to the commitment of the majority of American men. This is my first encounter with a serious critique of the meaning of war, and the first time to be shown clearly the attitude of the government towards the end performers of its debt. Wearing upheavals in society, international conflicts, seen from the distance of the next century, seem pointless.Raw symbolism showing amputation at the fine human, the size of the defense industry and the shock of the experience. Some people move through it, others - do not. Finally, the need for global normalcy and continued humane existence.Nearly three hours post-war rehabilitated existentialism saved by the power that is able to overcome everything. Innovative techniques of shooting indoor and seven awards 'Oscar'.http://vihrenmitevmovies.blogspot.com/",9,1,1,19 September 2014
Life of Pi," My rating: 7
","When I first saw this movie I thought that it is not good - some animals in a boat and that till the end. The second time I watched it I said to myself - 'it is good'. Long time after that fragmentary visions of it were coming back to my consciousness. They got sense undressed.Pi is not in relation with mathematics. But it can be interpret like this - a continuously revealing essence repeating on each manifestation. Strongly metaphorical it starts the story of life on a continent, in a family, on a ship with society, on a boat, in loneliness and in the end in a new family.It is a description of human life, of its connection with nature and its creations. Of not overcoming abyss between man, animals and plants for which Sartre tells us. Of relation with God or the internal sense. Of described fantasy and trivial people. Things in the life of almost everyone of us.In spite of the long period in the boat the spectator co-experience much and is informed much. Like his own existence. Of always dynamic but essential and most of all: his own.http://vihrenmitevmovies.blogspot.com/",7,1,2,17 January 2014
"Good Morning, Vietnam"," My rating: 8
","I watched the whole trailer to recall this movie. Why I did this? I was moved from this movie at the time I saw it even I do not know why I have missed to write about it till now.So... Goood mor-ning Vi-et_naaam! It is really interesting to see what happened to this country and how a single person using the radio and radio broadcasting - these such powerful sources of the mass communication - succeed in uprising the spirit of the people doing what he like most. I do not know why but on the last accent from the previous sentence his role of disco jockey, in a way, is best presenting the man and how he feels about his passion.Naturally, it is clear the deep sense of 'who is paying, he is playing the music' and - you will dance what we play looked in a political way for which the movie can take a lot of critic.When I watched the movie for the very first time I have not the experience that I have now. And that is why I enjoyed it naively and esthetically. I watched it like a piece of art.http://vihrenmitevmovies.blogspot.com/",8,0,0,28 January 2014
Bridge of Spies," My Rating: 8
","Okay. Because of the perspective of every idealistic person and mostly because this movie is based on real historical events it should be also presented here. Yes, the world has the need of such persons, regardless of age, gender, nationality. The final explanations in the film can best explain this.About that the highest human nature does not recognize propensities and is capable of creativity. Often transcend the established order and shines above it, although we know many cases where it remains neglected, gray and misunderstood.About the nonsense that we have caused to ourselves some time ago, and are still trying to inflict. About complete rethinking of our values. About the price and the meaning of human existence. About farsightedness and nearsightedness, which in both cases are defects, equally different world views.About the cult of personality, but also of the way that it is displayed. More decently for the one who receive himself as surpassing it will always be better if he is modest and non-woven. I.e. it may be added further quality and quantity to be removed. About that books remain better than the movies (with very few exceptions).http://vihrenmitevmovies.blogspot.com/",8,1,3,6 January 2016
Hugo," My Rating is 8
","Imaginary fairy tell that takes place in an old gare of Paris.The movie is about a magical journey of the young hood through the world of the elders. Unexpectet adventures come one after another in order to complete the story that is about to be told.Like the clock in the train station the story goes its full spin and it ends on the place it begins.Spectacular, amusing and interesting.My blog: http://vihrenmitevmovies.blogspot.com/",8,1,2,28 April 2017
Now You See Me," My rating: 8
","Even weirdly shot (almost documentary and in the modern video clip way) - turning the camera leftward till you literally get sick. Which reminds me: do not watch this movie with a bad stomach or if you weakened it before the projection.Movie's middle score came because of its story about two tricksters (magicians) which are in 'deadly' combat between each other. After changing the course and leaving this idea behind the movie continued intriguingly with its innovatism. Till the end. Where stopped on its edge and turned again on 90 degrees.So, I dare to write, something, that you have not watch before. One easy, fascinating, different, interesting combination of words that I just wrote. And If you are wondering why I use so many punctuational marks and useless explanations - so this at every point - is my wish to distract your attention. Do you see me now?http://vihrenmitevmovies.blogspot.com/",8,0,3,18 November 2013
Gone with the Wind," My rating: 6
","'Received 10 Oscars ...', which is a record. But I do not think it would become clear only by watching the movie. Quite stretched in time, the film shows us the relationship between the people involved in the war. 'An entire civilization gone with the wind.' How strange, this quote from the beginning of the film reminded me of the relationship between people over the last twenty years in our dear country.Instead of a love triangle, gone with the wind offer us love quadrangle, brilliantly garnished with lots of hypocrisy, greed, insensitivity and false success. At least true goodness preserve the honor for which is so much talked throughout the film. Realistic was the finale where the heroine has come to the truth about herself - that was truly loved, but she did not respond to those feelings and now it's too late. Here, the land, the house turned out to be a panacea for love, which does not seem to me very chaste.Of all these stories, I mean 'Wuthering Heights,' 'Pride and Prejudice', 'War and Peace', 'The Brothers Karamazov' and others, 'Gone with the Wind' were really so windy that you have to wonder what exactly it is telling about.http://vihrenmitevmovies.blogspot.com/",6,0,5,30 July 2013
The Pianist," My rating: 9
","The piano which is my favorite musical instrument. After is the violin and the sax. Which is second I can not say. Music – a form of freedom, playing music – of liberation, composing music – special case of the creationist providence.Away from the fact that I saw this movie long time ago I probably will never forget it. A chased piano player in the contrast of the war and the ruined buildings is an image of contradiction which dives in the mind and lay there for a a very long time. The only one ability of man to succeed in expressing and protecting him is something very special. And what if the circumstances are force marjorie? Is it creativity the only one string deep in us that love is pulling to sing its humble messages? Really wonderful movie but not for everyone. It shows human survival which is threatened by man an believing in only one thing when everything around is falling apart. It shows how when we walk in the right direction there is always a new way.http://vihrenmitevmovies.blogspot.com/",9,1,1,22 January 2014
The Grand Budapest Hotel," My rating: 8
","We've seen movies about hotels - beginning from the distant thirty years, and getting to one of the titles of Tarantino. But I must admit, a film about the hotel dedicated to the writer I had not come across until now.Dynamic, humorous, theatrical, fantastic. The plot is about the history of a building, which embodies the history of the 20th century. Actually, these are hard times affecting all of us; that shaped modernity. 'The past is not over, in fact is not past at all', who said that? Film that shows when high manners are in place. Namely, when they are from kindhearted and benevolent people. When politeness is a manifestation of humanity, and we are all people, but we are not all polite. On a pedestal were elevated loyalty and long lasting friendship. Below all this, there are the small details that are the glue of our society. Their presence is not a question of luxury, it is an indicator of a highly developed culture. Alas, their disappearance shows only savagery.A polite criticism of the worst part of human nature, served delicate and serene. Film like that, from the past year (let us remember - century passed since the beginning of the First World War) is a great achievement. Resembles the films inspired by the writings of Agatha Christie and The Artist.http://vihrenmitevmovies.blogspot.com/",8,1,3,5 January 2015
Revolutionary Road," My rating: 9
","Always, when I see Leonardo DiCaprio showing in a movie I am not really enthusiastic but many of the movies with him are very good. As this one is.It is about this how harder is for the trivial world to become different. And is it possible for the different world to become trivial? Isn't it every well-known path a revolutionary road? I hope that I will not insult someone with this - the spirit of Europe loves expressionists and expressionism, while on the opposite pole there is spirituality which finds life there cheap figuratively and literally. From the one side you can hear laughter and from the other sad crying which is capable of being happy because of the unhappiness of the others. But which one where is it? This movie shows the moment of exhausting of a relationship and the different points of view capable of supporting it. To believe on someone else's promise or to believe on your own? And if to be grown up means to give yourself up... I will not make conclusions instead of you. And about this to be wondering to keep your unborn child or not, or for the abortion in general, about this I will never change my opinion.The moments in the wood were showing the unmistakable calculations of the elementary mathematics of truth. In its hard for reading signs, the under-questionable or without-questionable everyday life stays behind. To stay in the moment of falling in love - to state your love again and again. And to lose everything. This is the sad aftermath.Incredible soundtrack. Film that assure you that you are alive and you can feel things.http://vihrenmitevmovies.blogspot.com/",9,0,1,2 August 2013
The Theory of Everything," My Rating: 7
","Despite the relatively low valuation that we put to this headline writing about this film is worthwhile. At the moment when the cliché of the young scientist with comprehensive bizarre but brilliant intellect was broken by explaining the personality of the protagonist (like who he was in fact), the film makes sense, albeit seriously reminds us of a previous title on the same topic.It is important to note the film because of the history it represents. Because of the strength of the protagonist to live with the hope that it will deal with every obstacle which he will face. Because of the love that is able to give such power and to multiply the good. Truly understanding that life is a struggle and that the more you fight, the more you distance yourself from the bad and the possibilities of failure is a state of mind typical of big and powerful people. Although they might not look exactly like this. The constant effort to reach the wave in the end leads you in the dock of a lake placid waters of happiness. And there is where all your previous existence gets its meaning.Therefore, we will counteract the physical forces and not let ourselves be sucked in by a black hole. We will strive to expand the universe and we hope that you will follow us in your personal example.http://vihrenmitevmovies.blogspot.fr/",7,1,1,19 February 2016
The Secret Life of Walter Mitty," My rating: 8
","What is this movie about? Speaking on other things I hope that I can tell you what happened in this movie. And I can summarize about the movies at all (as a part of the arts) – they give hope and in Platon way they reflect the reality in order to make us better understand it.What is the life of the artist? It is a man that can reflect life through himself and to give it back. Classical example: Dostoyevsky. Man who see life and make it again in his work.Truly. At the end, it is a matter of how important is to feel alive. And how important are the details, the small things, insignificant people, which we bypass on the daily streets. Naturally and as most important, the significance of the mother (and father)! Without which we would not be here.http://vihrenmitevmovies.blogspot.com/",8,0,1,11 February 2014
Stardust," My rating: 10
","Rarely, very rarely, I give such high rating of a film. Maybe it can not reflect it fully but still it shows my willingness to represent it to you.It starts a little bit and untypical but this is what the fairy world of the fantasy, without which we can not, is. Because fantasy make us to dream what we want to see, to go beyond our limits - to emerge from the aquarium rather than sink into it and drown.Crucial moment: the heart of the damsel, crossing point for all human worlds. And man's, and woman's; of children, and of elder people; of the young and of the adult. Crossing point where only harmonizing balanced worlds can become one and create new world.Balance is also one of the movie's elements. Measured doze of humor, action, adventure, fairy tale and tension. In order of appearance it presented us a story of ghosts, witches, flying ship who's captain (one of the biggest) is a lightening strikes hunter.The audience also becomes a ghost because this movie comes to life in front of them without an interest of their existence. And that in this case is good because his majesty The-mentioned-above can fully transmit in it and dream on.http://vihrenmitevmovies.blogspot.com/",10,5,7,6 December 2013
Lincoln," My rating: 7
","Extremely important issue, extremely great victory of man against man, of mankind. A key moment in world history that is able to push the opportunity to make a movie on it in the background.It's really hard to show the drama and significance of the event. Even the director and main character, I think, failed to do it. Same spinning all the time, the end was clear even before the start. On top of all was the emphasis on the fact that with immoral methods you can achieve moral outcomes.My assessment of the film is so high!, because of the importance of the subject, Daniel Day-Lewis (from his previous films) and Spielberg. He, just because of his name, lately I can not find his interesting films, especially I mean War of the Worlds.http://vihrenmitevmovies.blogspot.com/",7,3,4,30 July 2013
The Adjustment Bureau," My rating: 7
","I took deep breath and with exhale begin to write. From a long time I divide movies to new (bad) and old (good). This is rather good maybe because it goes more to the old movies.We used to watch Matt Damon in a bloody actions with shootouts and chases. This time it was love action with persecution but no shooting. Ideas were also present. Such as floating one on the surface to bottom fishes. This is why we throw the hook for bottom fish.The movie was a criticism of careerism, human irresponsibility and failure of liberalism and democracy. Fate - one of my favorite topics. The angels of destiny steer the course of history because people do not do well with this task. Well yes, but the chance prevented even the angels and love (of course) wins at the end. Here is the place for a light criticism of the female part in the film with its simplicity and ultimate romance. I can not miss to mention the striking resemblance between the bride fugitive's maid of honor and my acquaintance! Generally quickly showed us everything but successful and interesting. Watchable romantic action in which love wins over fate and even angels of destiny. It looked like a sigh this mine talk.http://vihrenmitevmovies.blogspot.com/",7,0,1,21 February 2014
The Artist," My rating: 9
","Bravo for the movie! Very positive and interesting, this film takes us to a time of silent black and white movies. With the difference that the character in silent films loses his voice for a brief moment of time, and in the end everyone start speaking by making the transition from silent films by including speech in them.The storyline revolves around the theme of love and reconciliation between the two types mentioned earlier movies. Directing shows interesting techniques as the main idea remains to return to the silent film in which the actors play similar to that of theatrical counterparts - it is much more expressive. Interesting experience is also the point at which the viewer hears sounds from the others in the room due to the lack of sound in the film.The film is really interesting experience that will definitely knock out of the field of the dangerously capturing trivial.http://vihrenmitevmovies.blogspot.com/",9,3,5,30 July 2013
In Time," My rating: 6
","The first twinkles in which you understand the presence of the meaning of your life or its absence, the living connection that brought you where you are. Like in the book The Stranger of Camus and the same way here, the movie begins from this moment. A huge loss that is able to push hardly onward, for a last time.The idea to play poker and to bet the remaining time of your life - truly impressive. All expressions about time have new aroma now. The movie starts definitely promising. And nothing more.About how much we value what we have (even if we do not have much) and how expensive we find it when we lose it. Which human life is of great value and which - is not. Justin Timberlake as an actor. Well, for this purpose - it is okay.To keep time in space orientated material device would be extremely high critic for a movie like this.http://vihrenmitevmovies.blogspot.com/",6,0,0,30 July 2013
12 Years a Slave," My rating: 7
","This movie maybe deserve even better rating because it shows the hard history of a normal human being that is humiliated and turned into slave. 12 years that I felt like an eternity.This movie reveal the most horror details of the slavery and the attitude of most of the slave owners (o, how miserable and shameful mankind can be!). Maybe there is sense in this movie and it shows the lowest of human fall to draw the heights that it must achieve.But. I saw recently other movies about slavery, wrote about Good Morning, Vietnam, so I can not ask something the movie industry across the ocean. When you became so big to whip yourselves like this, to make fun of you and to show on what ground your culture is build? Can we expect in fifty years such movies about the actions in middle and south-east Asia? I think that it is impudence doing so. To make profit showing yourself disgusting. Isn't it square disgusting? Otherwise the movie is good, a little heavy, long and depressing. Just as the period of slavery.http://vihrenmitevmovies.blogspot.com/",7,0,3,28 January 2014
The Wolf of Wall Street," My rating: 6
","The wolf. The wolf is a beast who has no pack and is a wolf till his end. In this sense he do not loose. There are few movies with the same plot but when DiCaprio is here that is not taken in mind. He made some bright roles recently but I may say strong images, strong personalities.The-movie-story have action moments, moments of narrative and protracted explanations. Also unnecessary deviations. It shows the human ambition for self-creating and freedom but also of Greed. The price which is paid in such cases is almost equal to never being born. The extreme experience of the body are not enough to overcome 'the horror of being sober' and to lose your love ones, twice.The-movie-story is very long. It is hard to me to imagine such life but I believe that everything is possible. Very good supporting role. I think always supporting role but always very good.The-movie-story is provocative. And in my mind there is a question – is not it possible for a man to become rich fairly.http://vihrenmitevmovies.blogspot.com/",6,2,4,22 January 2014
Inception," My rating: 8
","The film is interestingly designed in two parts - theory and practice. In the first part is piled all that is about to happen, while the second shows how it happens and what problems arise in practice. The first part may seem to you too slow but the second is definitely hard action. If we swallow some misstatement between what is said in the first part (said and definite as impossible), and what happens in the second part (perhaps deliberately bypassed), the film is worth watching. There are many beautiful scenes developing in parallel that increase the fuels the tensions in the viewer.Genesis concerns the idea of ​​manipulation of human consciousness and the eternal values ​​of trust and love.http://vihrenmitevmovies.blogspot.com/",8,0,2,30 July 2013
Birdman or (The Unexpected Virtue of Ignorance)," My rating: 10
","Meanwhile. This film shows us what we are doing with together, right now. Starting from the final person who is hit and ends with the only one, guilty in creating that affecting phenomenon. A film that captures the viewer from the beginning and does not release him until the end. You could say that is an action (there were dynamics and shooting guns) or fantasy (superheroes and special effects) movie; it can be described as far more courageous approach of Linklater's (Waking Life) movies and similar to Synecdoche, New York - whatever definition you give it, it will diminish, because it really manages to fly over all definitions.Shows the intertwining of life and work, shifts from the first to the second and vice versa. Acquaints us with stage fright before major events in our lives and looking for a place of privacy in the modern, public, virtual life. Shows what is doing and what is sitting on the sidelines and watch. Passes through the development of individuals and traces the stages in which they are located.Understanding of criticism (poor vilified by Flaubert), which can be justified with saying that criticism is philosophically demarcation of what is criticized, but, we agree, it happens in ready structures and cold concepts. But it remains below, in the low, irrelevant for the outspread wings high above it.A must see movie.http://vihrenmitevmovies.blogspot.com/",10,1,11,19 January 2015
Raging Bull," My rating: 8
","A surprise movie. Movie from the 80's but black and white. Movie made by Scorsese but not bloody. Without complicated and crossed inter-individual connections. With a culmination in the end but emotional one.Raging bull is the naked nerve of trust and the feeling for closeness with the others. When this feeling is not present the result is clear - loneliness, roughness and madness. It is possible when somebody is extremely good in what he does that this guy to be a genius. Even if he is not, he can be at least a master. Living in extremes always build contrasting features of the different.Each up has its down that is giving birth to another up before its down. When there is balance, when the break is hit before the depression and before the peak, when you are not making difference. The way up is slow, stubborn and hard. The way down is fast, teaching and painful.The question of the meaning stands in front everything and everybody. It is clear, spread and bright but not explained. Are we going to explain it now or then or at the end it is all the same. But it is good when we keep an eye on it.http://vihrenmitevmovies.blogspot.com/",8,1,1,13 November 2013
Blade Runner," My rating: 6
","You are asking yourself why I write about this movie now. I am answering: I have not seen the movie before and I was mistaken it with another one. Also I know that it is well known.Probably it was hit on its time. I thought of it as a story of the future but told with the resources of the 80's. 1982 it was published for my surprise. I can now explain better Harisson Ford in it. Very good scene in front of his door in his apartment.Long, slow, caring away without little dialog. Little but essential. It look over the questions of extreme of human existence, emotions and moral. Of insufficiency of given time for existence. In the end I thought that is talking about war and training people and sending them to battle.It talks about 2019 but I hope that our problems will be then the same and even be gone. That people will be more sober and humble. This is all for the replicants and their creators.http://vihrenmitevmovies.blogspot.com/",6,2,4,17 January 2014
Cloud Atlas," My rating: 9
","He was the other guy, she – the other woman. It will be hard for anyone to follow who appeared where. But otherwise useful exercise. Lets leave fun here.It is worth paying the price. Mapping clouds is not for anybody but for time killers. Something more, with these many clouds you receive five parallel movies. It is worth paying the price and stop our movie bus to the stop called Idea. Due to me, what is in mind of a man exists. Due to the authors of the movie our life is not limited by our body. We are predetermined and predeterminers. What will be will be with little changes. Good or bad, it depends on us.Are we living the life or life is living us? A walk from the WWII through the 70's and 80's to future after many, many years. Provocations, action, love, utopia. I am not quite sure but I think every actor played man and woman role. Am I right, I expect from you to tell me.http://vihrenmitevmovies.blogspot.com/",9,0,1,8 December 2013
The Great Gatsby," My rating: 7
","The Great Getsby. The embodied ideal, incapable to carry away the current in its waters. A man as a man, modest but with the great ability to believe and to hope that the balance of the world will bring back to him all that he personally gave. But he fails.About the ability to make ideas real, to wait the exact moment, to be large-hearted, a gentleman. About the instinct to follow ideas, to count on old success, to be trivial, to forget.Innovative staging, beautiful faces. This movie is successful and strong. It has his two hours and more. But we have seen his older version which was not aiming to modernize the story, to reach you with sound or with picture. It trusted on the true gentleman and his words which (specially for the people who love to seek and find) I have written somewhere else. It is interesting to make this parallel between this two movies(I can mention only one thing - Francis Ford Coppola). But only if you are inspired enough.http://vihrenmitevmovies.blogspot.com/",7,2,5,16 August 2013
"O Brother, Where Art Thou?"," My rating: 8
","It is likely that most often I will write reviews about the movies of Coen brothers. In a movie showing from well known to painfully well known themes, they succeeded to show their Coenism. As a perfect cinema culinary, the brothers powdered the main dish with the flavor of the collision of science and religion, the ignorance and faith, destiny and the personal choice. And in a what way! In moments grotesque, ironic and satiric, with the wonderful play of George Clooney, the main characters, like Odysseus and the Bremen musicians, led on the story line of Candid of Voltaire, are involved in adventure.On the background of the individual lamentations for wealth and power, the heroic ensemble is being caught in the trap of the state laws and God's will. Who is authorized to judge? The providence attach to them colorful adherents which draw them into the stream of their personality acts. For final, the garnish is bittersweet and hard-baked.Love. The woman of the main hero appear and she is capable of everything. It seem like it is written for them to be together, until she counts to three. The eternal motor is being found and the motive of the history is not reason. There is only one explanation.It will be good if there were more of these movies. The sight which Coen brothers have is unique and can be put to a row of similar themes and plots. We hope there will be more of their movies but until we hope â€“ watch this one.http://vihrenmitevmovies.blogspot.com/",8,0,0,13 August 2013
