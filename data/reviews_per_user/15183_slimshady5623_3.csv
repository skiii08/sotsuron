Antz," My Favorite Childhood Film.
","I remember when I was a kid I use to watch this movie nonstop it was so good, I had it on VHS, although VHS are pretty much extinct now. Antz is a very fun movie, and well created considering the computerized production. This movie has action, betrayal, jealousy, loyalty, adventure, bravery and more. It's not just a movie for kids it's also for teens and adults. This movie tells the story of a ant named Z a lowly worker in a culture where the welfare of the colony far outweighs the welfare of the individual, who is unsatisfied with his station in life. Through his perseverance and love for the colony, he ends up exceeding even his own expectations. Woody Allen, Sharon Stone, Sylvester Stallone, Gene Hackman, Christopher Walken, Jennifer Lopez, Dan Aykroyd, Danny Glover, and the rest of this AMAZING cast, have truly outdone themselves with their performances.The film score is excellent, and fits the movie perfectly. I wish there was a sequel to this classic.",9,1,1,17 July 2012
Die Hard 2," could of been better.
","Die hard 2 wasn't as good as the original everybody knows that.but i think they did a good job with casting,although i was expecting more from a lot of the actors.die hard 2 picks up a couple of years after the events of the first film. John McClane is waiting for his wife at a airport called Dulles in Washington d.c. while waiting he spots mercenary terrorist who take control of the airport. Let me tell you something about these terrorist their more prepared,more dangerous and better trained than the ones from the original.the pacing of die hard 2 is really slow,and there are a lot of noticeable mistakes.I don't blame Bruce Willis for saying that this is his least favorite die hard movie.",5,2,4,14 March 2012
Die Hard with a Vengeance," More action-packed than the first two combined!
","With director John McTiernan back at the helm, 'Die Hard With a Vengeance' (1995) is a textbook example of action-packed filmmaking, perhaps the best of the 'Die Hard' trilogy. John McClane (Bruce Willis) finds himself back in New York he is now an alcoholic loser, separated from his wife, and suspended from the police force. until a serial bomber (Jeremy Irons) begins terrorizing the city. Soon McClane is sent on tedious suicide errands alongside a Harlem shopkeeper (Samuel L. Jackson) as a distraction while Jeremy Irons and his brigade rob the gold from the Federal Reserve. Bruce Willis and Samuel L. Jackson had great chemistry, they've worked together in a couple films, but i found this to be the best. I liked how even many of the minor characters have lively, memorable personalities. It reminded me of the first Beverly Hills Cop where a wide variety of characters stood out. This movie has a lot of humor which I greatly appreciated.",10,0,0,11 July 2012
