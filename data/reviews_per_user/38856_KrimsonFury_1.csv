Pirates of the Caribbean: On Stranger Tides," Not as I had expected
","okay am I the only one who did not enjoy this movie?unlike the first 3 parts i actually felt bored in the theater a few times ,i feel like there this movie should have had the old cast members like pintel and raghetti,the chemistry b/w the cast of the first 3 was excellent.the comedy and dialogues were amazingly done in the first 3,i loved barbossa's character in the first 3, in this one he doesn't deliver good dialogues,kind of a stiff character in this one.its only at the end he becomes the kind of character i had expected him to bejohnny depp did amazingly like he always does, but i feel like blackbeard wasn't a good antagonist,davy jones from the second and third part did amazingly as an antagonistall in all i feel like the script wasn't solid enough,i'd give it a poor rating",1,8,22,17 May 2011
