Pirates of the Caribbean: On Stranger Tides," Not as good as the others
","I was expecting more from this movie. First of all, there was too much unnecessary dialogs in the film. Second, the fighting scenes and the comic timing where not as good as in the other films. Another thing (correct me if I'm wrong), is that I don't like the fact that Blackbeard was not even mentioned in any of the previous films, including 'At World's End' which is supposed to have all of the great pirates of the world reunited in one great battle for the survival of their kind. And all of the sudden he is the 'world's most feared pirate', and has supernatural powers, with a supernatural ship. Oh! and he also can take other ships and put them in bottles which he then collects. Definitely, the selection of director Rob Marshall wasn't the best one, and for the next time I hope that they choose a better screenplay. In fact I gave this film a 6 mainly because I love this franchise.",6,0,0,6 June 2011
