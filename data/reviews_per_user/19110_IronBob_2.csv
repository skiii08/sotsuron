Casablanca," More than a classic
","There's one aspect of Casablanca that is seldom if ever discussed. Every character in the movie has made choices out of necessity rather than desire and yet the entire movie centers around desire.Humphrey Bogart's, Rick, settles in Casablanca after being on the run with Sam, his piano man who has very little choice but to follow him. Bergman's, Ilsa, who is torn from Bogart in Paris, leaves him out of necessity when she learns her husband who she thought was dead is alive.Ilsa's husband played by Paul Henreid, is a non-reluctant political mercenary, taking refuge in Casablanca.In the background there is Louie, the French prefect, who also by necessity plays the aggressive supporter of Vichy France and yet has no love for his superiors.In the background is the oppressiveness of the German army in a town where every non-native is there out of necessity, trying to free themselves from the yoke of German viciousness.Thus is the backdrop where desire must heed to necessity against a menace out to crush both. A truly remarkable film with remarkable performances that have gone on to be more than a timeless classic but rather a thread in the fabric of every American. It carries messages that may seem lost on today's youth but still provides timeless lessons.",10,3,5,25 December 2008
Blade Runner," Incredible in more ways than one
","I was 22 years old the first time I saw Bladerunner at a drive-in movie and being quite drunk at the time I really didn't get much out of it.20 years later, I don't drink any more and I revisited this movie and I can honestly say I can't think of another science fiction movie that stands up to it save maybe Alien, ironically.A movie that puts us in the middle of internal and external conflicts. Internal in that Harrison Ford, the best of the best in replicant executioners still struggles with that fact that he kills. It doesn't matter that what he kills isn't really human, he still feels his own humanity as he does the awful deed of ending a replicant's life.It's revealed to us early on who these replicants are but amazingly we don't find out their reason for escaping their assigned occupations. In a very crafty fashion their mission reveals itself in the people they are looking for. More life, the wish of everyone, is their only true goal.Outside of the movies plot, there are two things that stand out with Bladerunner. The first is that this movie's atmosphere as put forth by special effects and set designs stand up with the best out there today. They blend together in such as way as to elicit that eery aura we all feel sans The Day the Earth Stood Still.But the one thing that stands out and has always stood out is the absolute perfection of Sean Young in make-up. To this day I've never seen a more beautifully scuptured face with absolute perfection in her coloring and features. She's made up in such a way that she literally pounces out of the screen. She has never received the credit she deserved for this film and it's a shame because no character in any science fiction movie has put forth a more perfect performance than her.Rutger Hauer of course provides us with a performance that was worthy of a best supporting actor Oscar and had this come out today he would have gotten it.Daryl Hannah, perhaps the weakest link in the cast still puts forth an acceptable performance as one of the replicants. It would have been a lesser movie without her.The filming of facial expression, the interaction between all the characters and the final scenes which actually promote full circle motivations is fascinating.I've spun Bladerunner on the platter a good 20 times since watching it again in 2000 and I must say, I never get tired of it because it's difficult not to appreciate a masterpiece.",10,0,1,18 February 2006
