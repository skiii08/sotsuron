Scarface," Masterpiece, The Best Movie i've Ever seen
","My opinion is that scarface is one of the best movies ever.And I will tell you why.First here's my top five: 1.SCARFACE 2.GODFATHER PART II 3.GODFATHER, HEAT & GOODFELLAS 4.APOCALYPSE NOW, ONCE UPON A TIME IN America 5.THE DEER HUNTER Scarface is awesome movie.Great acting, great story, fantastic 80's style.I think De Palma and Stone has chosen excellent way to describe Miami lifestyle, fashion, habits in the 80's.I'm from EX-Yugoslavia (Serbia & Montenegro) and I was born in late 80's ('87), but I like 80's and fashion style from that period especially music and movies. Al Pacino was brilliant, one of the best performances ever seen on the movie.OK, his role of Michael Corleone was special, he had attracted audience and all film world with that role.But, with Tony Montana he had acuired cult status for movie and for himself.It was breathtaking performance.But it's not word just about Pacino.Rober Loggia (Frank Lopez), Paul Shenar (Alejandro Sosa), F Murray Abraham (Omar Suarez, otherwise he won Oscar for salieri role in the best picture of 1984-Amadeus), Mary Elisabeth Mastrantonio (Gina), Steven Bauer (Manolo) and Michelle Pheiffer (Tony's cold-hearted women) - they also were splendid. I have reading different comments.There are people who say that scarface is possibly the most overrated movie?????? These people are kidding???? But how? Scarface hasn't received any award, any Oscars, just a few nominations.It couldn't be overrated, it's simply the most underrated film of all time.But, no matter, today after 24 years, without awards, without Oscars, without good critics, this movie has endured test of time.It's so popular, has a cult status and it's probably one of the best movies ever. Also, I must mention Giorgio Moroder.I love his work(What a Feeling, Take My Breath Away, Un Estate Italiana, Together In Electric Dreams...).Like in almost every movie Giorgio Moroder made a great job.With Scarface soundtrack Moroder gave us feeling (when you're watching movie) like we're living 80's.I almost like every song from the soundtrack(Turn Out The Lght, She's On Fire, Shake It Up, Tony's Theme,...), even Cuban-Vamos A Bailar.Song Push It To The Limit is remarkable because it exactly follow the plot & story.With no doubt, it is excellent and one of the best original motion picture soundtracks ever. The costumes were also liked to me.Scarface outfits are wonderful especially man suits and shirts with collars over the suits, pastel colors.Lovely style. I like every element in this movie.Scenes, story, style, music, acting,... Scarface deserves better rating- at least 8.7 & at least TOP15. You can criticise this movie but the fact is that it is BREATH-TAKING,BRILLIANT,MAGNIFICENT, POWERFUL, GLAMOROUS & EXTRA-POPULAR (possibly because of that underrated).Probably ONE OF THE BEST MOVIES EVER (for me the best).",10,0,2,13 November 2006
