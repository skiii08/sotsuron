The Blair Witch Project," a full-stop for 20th century cinematography
","it's not only a movie or an unexpectedly generated moneymaking wonder but a FULL-STOP for the 20th century cinematography as well. Shaping of the cinema as the 7 art is cruised a long road until now. Horror films evaluated from Mr.Karloff to Mr.Craven. Poltergeist is a milestone at early 1980s by opening a new era it was a pioneer. With Blair Witch Project we've noticed the naivete and innocence of personally generated fears with instincts alone. That's why we can name this a full-stop with an expectancy of unlimited human genius and creativity without hi-tech tricks but mind (which we can use the 20% power of that engine). A simple way following the destiny with those guys who were (maybe far from realism and reasonability but leave as it is) lost in forest. A trivia of victim and victimization. There is no need to critic the scenario: as we've meet the improvisations of the players are perfect. Film accelerate itself good enough to accompany the audience smoothly together. But I've heard some of them: Wow it's good, but i felt that the film wasn't over it's just started. Finally, by the help of Blair Witch Project, we've noticed there exists a genre or cult: INDEPENDENT MOVIE. It really seemed as a graduation project of postgraduate students. By this well woven harmony and loop they have remained a forgotten taste from the distant shelves of pure genius and simplicity. Entertainment industry has to review, regenerate and refresh themselves for the millennium. It's essential to review our place as an audience also. Because new human wouldn't be the home-digitus, must keep his/her own humanitarian values and mind.",Null,0,1,7 October 1999
