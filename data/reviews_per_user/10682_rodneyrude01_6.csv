The Ring," Superbly crafted and most of all..scary
","After recently seeing The Ring, it is not since The Blair Witch Project that I have been scared and freaked out so much by a horror film. After the endless array of horror films that rely on people bumping into each other or the use of orchestral blastings after a period of silence, The Ring creates one of the most unnerving cinematic experiences ever and having none of the latter cheap scare devices.After just seeing the Japanese version, there are few differences between the two but as a gasp to many other horror fans, I do prefer the US version. I thought the screenplay was more in depth and the changes and additions writer Ehren Kruger composed, really added an edge to the original story of The Ring. Although the well scenes were more chilling in the Japanese version, The Ring was a film which really needed a bigger budget and more polished visuals to suck the most juice of of the story's great potential and the US version perfected it without ruining it with the usual loudness, gloss and insubtlety.Never seeing director Gore Verbinsky's previous work, i was extremely impressed. After the 'Scream' influenced opening, I'd have to say it had me on the edge of my seat more than the 3 Scream films combined. His use of little music, unnerving sound effects and the splashes of stylish transitions and shots were very beneficial to create the extremely creepy atmosphere. Along with the help of cinematographer Bojan Bazelli, The film features a very dull and overcast look which in such scenes as the horse sequence, add elements of mystique and coldness.Overall The Ring is an excellent film that creates the atmosphere and genuine scares that horror films have lacked for years. With various complaints of plot holes and seldom explanations for plotlines, it IS a horror film, there will always be plotholes to make the film more entertaining and if people always need plots spoonfed to them, wait for the next wave of Summer blockbusters in 2003. With the jawdropping ending, accomplished acting, It provides a twisting and chilling experience that many of us have waited for in a horror film for a long time.",10,0,0,20 November 2002
Minority Report," Best film of the year
","Without a doubt, Spielberg's masterpiece Minority Report would be the best film of the year and ultimately, it is one of the first Summer blockbusters since The Matrix that can combine a terrific storyline within a blockbuster framework. Although Spielberg's last effort A.I. which also was equally brilliant, sat on the fence with viewers, Minority Report is much more appealing to mainstream viewers yet again incorporates a dark and probing storyline. Tom Cruise puts in a surprisingly good and credible performance that easily surpasses his previous action-y performances in Mission Impossible 2. Along with Cruise, the supporting cast is excellent with sleeper actor Samantha Morton giving an emotional performance. The Phillip K Dick story is wonderfully adapted by Scott Frank and Jon Cohen into a brilliantly rendered narrative that portrays a bleak, jawdropping and very intriguing view of the future and it's resultant flaws. The score by John Williams, as always, expertly captures every emotion of the film and accompanies the celluloid with oblique ambiance to providing thrilling action riffs. A definite highlight is the cinematography by lens legend Janusz Kaminski. His contrast of grey and blue filters to overwashed and overexposed scenes create a unique environment to the phenomenal sets and production design. Finally, cutos goes to Spielberg, who never fails with his flawless direction. With his fluid camera movement, perfect composition, expert pacing with the help of Michael Kahn's spoton editing, helming of action sequences and an eye for capturing the emotions and actions of his actors, he is by far the best modern director Hollywood film has seen and is an icon among film buffs. Minority Report is a technical masterpiece with a story to match and will join the walls of Steven Spielberg's brilliant career. 5 out of 5",10,0,0,21 June 2002
Star Wars: Episode II - Attack of the Clones," minor flaws but overall, awesome
","After queuing in line for 2 hours to get a decent seat, it was great to realise that east coast Australian audiences would be the first to see EP2 in the world. With high expectations and a roaring full house, it was easy to tell that the congregation was impressed. AOTC is a huge improvement over TPM in terms of story, characters and tone yet  like EP1, it still had the flaw of woeful dialogue. With Lucas bringing on Jonathan Hales to flesh out the script, i would of expected better dialogue throughout the film, which brought much unintentional laughter. Although the humour was actually quite funny and there were some good lines, the writing and direction of the romance scenes was quite poor and proves Lucas as much to learn on executing chemistry with characters. Acting was good allround yet Christensen wasn't 100% capable of pulling off his role which to say, wasn't helped by his dialogue. It is easily seen any flaw of acting is contributed by actors not used to delivering amidst a wall of blue screens and with Lucas not having the best skills as helping actors blend their performances through the masses of fx surrounding them, the actors try their best. As far as fx, wow. The film has brilliant action sequences with the audience constantly dropping jaws no matter how much we know it's just CGI. As for the finale and Yoda..the whole cinema just erupted in cheers and 'holy sh..s' Overall AOTC is a great film and if a little more effort had gone into the dialogue, it would have been a perfect sequel.",10,0,0,15 May 2002
Transformers," First 2007 blockbuster that is entertaining!
","I had high expectations for this flick and for the first time since Batman Begins, a film actually lived up to its hype. I was literally bored with Pirates and Spiderman 3 as they offered nothing new and had extremely messy scripts where writers think a good movie these days is made up of 17 parallel story lines and run 30 minutes longer than they need to.I won't go into the plot so here's my critical yarnÂ… Firstly, Transformers has a fantastic script that is actually filled with great comedy. It maintains a reasonably serious tone but knows when to lighten itself up at its silly premise. The acting is quite impressive with Shia LaBeouf sealing himself as the next Leo Dicaprio/Tom Hanks for generation Y.Now to Mr Bay. People bag him but honestly, have you ever come out of one of his films not entertained? Bay has composed some of the most amazing action sequences here since The Matrix. Maybe not as groundbreaking but for jaw on the floor factor, most definitely.I have never enjoyed a film so much this year since Hot Fuzz. My only rant is that Bay needs to calm his editors down. Some of the action sequences are edited so fast and shot so tightly, it can be easy to have no idea what is going on, but hey, it's a Bay trademark. Lastly, like all modern blockbusters, it could have had 15 minutes shaved off but is no where near as bloated as two aforementioned sequels. Finally, great score.I hope this film does well considering all the nerdy backlash. I grew up with Transformers, I don't remember much but as a film, it will be hard to beat for summer blockbusters...Well until we in Australia have to wait another 6 weeks to see Die Hard 4 and Bourne U",9,1,6,29 June 2007
The Silence of the Lambs," Brilliant
","Never forgetting the first time i saw this film, after having just watching it again, i was reminded of how much of a brilliant film this is. After reading the book a year ago, i was amazed to see how much was included in the screenplay, which is a rarity for many adapted films. Although the book is 500 pages long, writer Ted Tally was able to include every detail to make it one of the best adapted screenplays ever.In terms of the actual film, it is flawless. The performances are superb all round with Foster and Hopkins giving their much deserved oscar rounds. Without a doubt, the most accolades go to the director Jonathan Demme, who by his skill, has crafted one of the best modern day thrillers along with David Fincher's Seven. With a surprisingly simple style of direction, his choice of povs, tracks, freaky closeups and making actors stare down the camera all accumulate to create an unnerving yet awesome anchor to Harris' story. Although Demme has been quiet since, He has taught many amatuer filmmakers and major directors that flashy direction is not appropriate all the time.Special mention goes to the editor and composer. After watching the escape sequence and Starling's entrance to Gumb's apartment, editor Craig McKay cuts tension filled sequences that keep you on the edge of your seat. With this and along with the expert, furious pacing, this film never wastes one second of screentime. Howard Shore's subtle and ominous score fits the mood perfectly and makes an excellent contribution to the film.Being a filmmaker myself, many other people and myself admire the sheer talent and craftsmanship in this film and with big expectations for Red Dragon in October, I hope Brett Ratner and co. will do the Thomas Harris book justice and take notes from this thrilling masterpiece.

Windtalkers," A well made and moving film
","Being a massive John Woo fan, I was very eager to see the long delayed Windtalkers in Australia. With the fairly negative feedback from the US, my expectations were lowered yet after it's screening, I was very impressed.
After the endless war films released these days, it is hard to distinguish one war film from the other and these days, it all boils down to filmmakers trying to conquer new ground in the genre and John Woo certainly exceeds. Apart from the high level of male bonding that Woo excels at in Windtalkers and his other films, the story of the Najavo windtalkers would have to be one of the most intriguing concepts; assuming it's reasonable accurate, I've seen in a war film. Not since Saving Private Ryan has a war film actually created characters that emit some sympathy to the audience. After the average We Were Soldiers and hollow Black Hawk Down, the latter, a film that although was praised, i thought had no character development or generation of feeling for characters and felt more as a 140 minute documentary of brilliantly executed gunfire. Through Various scenes, Windtalkers creates a unique experience of Indian and caucasian American people to embalm a powerful story.As for direction, John Woo certainly knows his craft and although i missed the awesome over the top direction of Face/Off, Woo certainly inserts flourishes of style with long steadicam sequences and various visual dream sequences that capture well, the inner emotions of characters. With good editing, cinematography for once that didnt copy  Janusz Kaminski's forever copied dull washed look in SPR, technically, it is a well made film. John Woo creates an enticing complementary film to his more captivating Bullet in the Head that adds something fresh to the increasingly over-produced genre.",Null,0,0,11 August 2002
