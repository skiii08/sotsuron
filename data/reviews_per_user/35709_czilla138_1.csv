Skyfall," Not what you would expect if this is your first bond movie. I expected allot more gadgets, and fighting than this actually had.
","This is admittedly my very first bond film. I am a fan of action movies, but I wasn't as empressed with this film. I expected their to be allot more fight, and tech gadgets. My partner who is a Bond fan says they toned this one down. It had more plot, and story than just filling it with action. I was pleased with it, and plan on going back to watch all the bond films. I have to say that this time around having an African American bond girl is awesome. I especially loved who they got to play Eve/Miss Moneypenny. After seeing her in Pirates of the carribian this is a much better role for such a beautiful woman. I was expecting allot more than this movie dilivered in case of a 007 movie. They also copied allot of things from Mission Impossible, or is it the other way around lol. I would recommend this movie as a theater treat. It is worth the price of admission.",9,1,6,14 November 2012
