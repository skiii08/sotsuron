The Blair Witch Project," surprising
","Going into this, I thought it wouldn't live up to the hype.  It almost didn't.  There were a few scary moments-just enough to satisfy me.  I was planning on being disappointed but that's not how it ended up.  There were some plot characteristics I didn't know about and I was scared even though I knew it was totally fake.  The shaky camera didn't bother me much, I got used to it.  And I really did feel like I was in the woods with them, being frustrated and scared and the whole nine yards.It was an excellent concept, and very well done.  If you don't like it, at least give them credit for originality, which Hollywood sorely lacks.",9,1,1,30 July 1999
