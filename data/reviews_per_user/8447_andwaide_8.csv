Ford v Ferrari," Impressive
","Great acting, cinematography, the race scenes where outstanding, good story tho obviously no surprises in the plot but the acting and characters really made this a stand outðŸ‘Œ",9,2,3,1 December 2019
The Irishman," A bit plodding Ã°Å¸ËœÂ¬
","Amazing scenes and pieces of great acting but overall a bit over indulgent by Scorsese. It's wayyyy too long, for example the last 30 min could've been completely cut out. The pace overall is far too slow and plodding, it could've been amazing but has fallen far short of amazing and well down the list behind Goodfellas and Casino.",6,3,10,30 November 2019
Avengers: Endgame," My breakfast was more interesting.
",Terrible way to end such an amazing saga. Infinity War was excellent! This is so dull and full of massive plot holes. Personally I would've preferred to see a massive hunt to find and destroy Thanos with him playing a major part in the movie. Instead Thanos is confronted early on and then it's all a load of rubbish from there.,5,4,10,1 December 2019
Once Upon a Time... in Hollywood," Why was this movie even made??
","Great acting by the cast, only positive thing I can write. But why did this movie even get made?? It's terrible! Did someone owe taxes? or a favour? or was it contractual with a production house? It's dull, plodding, no plot whatsoever, just a waste of time. But if you're a fan of the cast you'll probably enjoy their acting which was on point.",4,2,4,1 December 2019
The King," Henry V as he's never been portrayed
","Most realistic and believable account of Henry V and the battle of Agincourt as a movie. Excellent script, acting, direction, sets, costumes etc, felt like I was actually there in 1415. One of the best movies Netflix has made to date.",9,3,4,7 January 2020
Midway," Action movie set in WW2
","It's an action film set in WW2, that sums it up. It's not gritty or very realistic like the better WW2 movies eg Saving Private Ryan or Hacksaw Ridge. It's basically a WW2 action movie. Having said that the dog fight scenes are outstanding and the CGI is pretty awesome. If you love WW2 fighter planes, you'll totally enjoy this as much as I did. Great to see an all star cast in it also.",7,0,4,8 February 2020
Casino," Has set a benchmark for decades
","Casino has set a benchmark for movie making that will stand for decades! So much attention to detail from all involved, direction, acting, cinematography, costumes, score, editing etc etc etc. The pace and story telling totally capture you and the movie is gripping from start to end.",8,1,2,4 December 2019
Star Wars: Episode V - The Empire Strikes Back," 2nd Star Wars movie is the best of the lot.
","It's the 2nd Star Wars movie far as I'm concerned, don't care much for the creator George Lucas re-jigging the order of the movies nor re-jigging some scenes in the original 3 movies decades later. It's the best of the lot, including all the new movies in the extended Star Wars world. It's a great story and has this intimate but epic quality to it that makes it feel real yet mythical at the same time.",8,0,0,4 December 2019
