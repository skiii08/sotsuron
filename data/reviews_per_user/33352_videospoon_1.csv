Skyfall," This is a 007? Doesn't see, like it
","SKYFALL - Watching this for the first time. One of the most Boring films I have ever seen (And I usually like Bond), gone are the fun gad jets,pretty ladies (now we are treated to J.Wench instead) Dialog seems contrived (reminded me of Italian cinema in in the 60's, everyone dripping with a jaded sense of 'Ennui' as they seem bored with one another) and the film and actors have as much energy as a dildo with a battery on its last 2 volts. Horrific, I did not feel that I was watching a Bond film. The annoying staple 'Who cares' kept rattling in my head and I just quit watching after 67 minutes. I rented this from a Red Box so no damage done outside of my very precious time.",1,4,11,20 April 2013
