Angels & Demons," No thrilling mystical hunt.
","Much like the Da Vinci Code, Angels and Demons fails to do justice to the much more impressive books. For me Angels and Demons is the better book and more suited to the big screen. It is disappointing to say that Angels and Demons really does not deliver. Tom Hanks and Ewan Macgregor do good jobs with a script so abrupt and poorly designed it is in coherent to the viewer. Ayelet Zurer who plays Vittoria Vetra is sadly just a 'hanger-on' the particular purpose or real significance of her presence is never really examined, and appears to be only there to ask questions or to answer them to fill in gaps within the screenplay. The biggest failure is without doubt the screenplay. The opening seems particularly rushed with it moving from the Vatican to a CERN research lab rather messily. There is no explanation to events and although at times it appears the story has been slowed for our better understanding it doesn't assist or enable us to be as concerned as Robert Langdon. Indeed some of the verbal dialogue is at times undecipherable and painfully leaves you without knowing what has happened. Angles and Demons does not delve into the heart of the matter, that is the battle between religion and science, it gets lost in the messy narrative.The crisp cinematography and score are excellently done and help heightened the aesthetics but without the internal structure(plot)seems out of context.The film does drag and it is a real shame that it could not piece together Dan Brown's work better to produce a thrilling mystical hunt. Maybe it is fair to say that adapting such books to screen will always be hard to deliver but it really shoots way-lower on the expectation level.",5,1,2,12 July 2009
Frost_Nixon," Langella & Sheen.
","The engaging power of Frost/Nixon comes from the wonderful performances of Michael Sheen and Frank Langella. Both actors in their own right are outstanding. The film is based on the interviews by Frost with Nixon, which would turn out to be a worldwide success and spectacle.The screenplay is taut, and energetic, and through the interviews enables a reasonable documentation of the Nixon presidency. The film is somewhat hampered by its licence to embellish and create scenes to maintain allure. I am a little disappointed that it swayed somewhat from the truth.The scene where Richard Nixon has been having a drink, and calls Frost in the middle of the night, is a complete fabrication (as stated by Frost himself), why did the writers feel the need for such spin? The very nature of Nixon himself and the prevailing interview would of been more than sufficient to engage the viewer rather than such a concoction.The supporting cast are excellent in particular Rockwell and Bacon, and the documentary like feel gives Frost/Nixon credence, and helps convey the magnitude of the scandal of 'Watergate' which some may find difficult to envisage now.Although blotted by its inaccuracies in order to seek suspense this is a well-paced film that delivers on the entertainment front. Langella and Sheen are so engaging that the film can only charm and captivate in equal measure.",8,3,6,30 March 2009
Walk the Line," Johnny Cash - Who are you?
","If you are a fan of Johnny Cash and his music, I have no doubt that you will enjoy this picture. However, for someone who knew very little about Johnny Cash and his music it does not have much of an impact.Reese Witherspoon and Joaquin Pheonix produce good performances and their ability to perform the songs themselves is testament to their talents and acting abilities. However, Walk the Line does not really ever progress, by that I mean Johny Cash obsesses over June Carter, they fall-out, he copes by taking some illegal substance and they make-up, and in-between they sing-songs.Walk the Line to its detriment neglects his wife and kids too much, as though this would have a negative effect on who we perceive Johnny Cash to be. Although I found the music not to my liking it was the scenes where music took a back-seat, and we had a chance to try and understand Johnny Cash that were inadequate. I did not feel come the end that I had any understanding of who he was.",5,0,2,26 May 2008
Lucky Number Slevin," Top Cast - Mediocre Film.
","Sir Ben Kingsley, Morgan Freeman and Bruce Willis...A fantastic cast. How it managed to bring these fine thespians to a film that is a rather poor 'Lock, Stock/Snatch' imitation is rather bewildering. The film follows Josh Hartnett as he is inadvertently employed by two rival mob- bosses (Freeman and Kingsley) in their escapades against one-another.It is not ideal to tinker with the mood/tone of a film, especially when they are never interlinked or brought together in a logical and practical manner. For three-quarters of the film it bumbles along in a cheery tone and then it gets rather serious. The last 20 minutes turns into a 'Usual Suspects' mêlée of cuts and edits. These edits are meant to convey how slick and clever the film has been but its poor, not because of the way it is done but because of the ambiguity of the script. The film is nothing more than average and was 'Lucky' to be bolstered by a great cast, which would have given it box-office clout, and to some degree a meager helping with reviews. If you are a fan of Kingsley, Freeman or Willis be warned this is one to forgo.",5,5,10,11 December 2008
3:10 to Yuma," Entertaining.
","The casting of Russell Crowe and Christian Bale in the lead roles made 3:10 to Yuma a very appealing proposition.Unfortunately, 3:10 to Yuma is a simple, linear western which does not make effective use of the talents of Crowe and Bale.It is two-hours of cat and mouse which is ably executed and good fun. However, considering that Crowe and Bale were at its disposal it is a rather frustrating experience considering the lack of character insight.3:10 Yuma is worth a watch, and the script tries to make amends for the lack of character development with a gritty last twenty minutes... Sadly it was too little too late.",7,5,11,5 May 2008
The Hangover," Giggles
","An engaging premise... What did we do the night before? Why is the groom missing, why is there a lion in the bathroom and a baby in the closet? This bizarre setup has you hooked. Please be advised, and if this is possible, see this without any notion of the antics or reviews thus far as it will probably be that much more funny. The Hangover unravels events in a logical, creative and humorous manner. All the cast are very good but Zach Galifianakis as Alan is the stand-out character with the best lines.I loved the soundtrack to Hangover with Usher's 'Yeah', T.I's 'Live Your Life' and Kanye West's 'Can't Tell Me Nothing' synced into the film early on. That is not forgetting the original songs 'Stu's Song' and 'Three Best Friends' which were worth a chuckle. Not to mention Mike Tyson's cameo... How did that happen? The Hangover is a comedy of originality and eccentric characters, and there are plenty of laughs to be had, and I recommend The Hangover to anyone wanting a good giggle.",8,1,2,14 December 2009
Kung Fu Panda," Lots of Kung-Fu but not enough laughs
","Po, an overweight panda who dreams of becoming a kung-fu master while working at his father's noodle shop finds himself thrusted into the spotlight inadvertently, and selected to be the next Dragon Master, to defeat the evil Tai Lung.Kung-Fu Panda is a film that is well animated with sections of music which really dramatise the picture. Some of the fights scenes are lavishly and well-applied but it isn't funny and rather predictable. That is the major drawback of Kung-Fu Panda, minor chuckles every now and then.The film has certainly been influenced by Star-Wars with Shifu (voiced by Dustin Hoffman) possibly being a distanced relative of Yoda. There was one comment by Oogway 'There is a saying: yesterday is history, tomorrow is a mystery, but today is a gift. That is why it is called the present' which I actually really liked.The stand-out voice actor for me was Michael Clarke Duncan as Commander Vachir, which Clarke-Duncan radiates with sheer power and presence.Kung-Fu Panda has been well created, and although it is not a bad film , which children will no doubt enjoy, it does not create enough laughs for the adult.",6,1,1,18 January 2009
The Big Lebowski," Original but too quirky.
","The Coen brother's The Big Lebowski is a quirky, odd-ball comedy which succeeds in providing original characters and scenes of comedic wit. However, the eccentricities at times are too outlandish, and frustrates the viewing experience.The film follows 'The Dude' played by Jeff Bridges who is mistaken for a rich-namesake. The consequence of this mistaken identity leads The Dude and his psychotic-friend Walter Sobchak on a journey of double-cross and bewilderment.The film is creative and supplies a number of good one-liners. On the whole you are happy to go along with the oddity of the story. The Lebowski's one big drawback is its rather impeding 'dream sequences', which are rather ill-fitting. Without these dream sequences the film would have flowed a lot better. However, instead it leaves you aghast at the incongruity of there inclusion. These moments together with other eccentric creations shift the Big Lebowski's strength as a story.Without doubt Jon Goodman is the star of the film. Jon Goodman's character Walter Sobchak is a somewhat Jekyl and Hyde individual. Walter's actions and words are the underlying strength of the film. His predominantly psychopathic ex-Vietnam vet reactions contorted with his apparent intellectual mind make him one of the most memorable characters. Unfortunately, Steve Buscemi role as 'Donny' is more the opposite and I disliked the gimmicky inclusion of the character.The Big Lebowski is not an altogether bad film. Jon Goodman provides a great performance which invigorates the story, but the Coen's quirkiness was just a little too overbearing for me and I felt at times an unnecessary distraction.",6,3,6,22 February 2010
Star Trek," Fun but it doesn't excel.
","Star Trek isn't a bad film, it is rather fun to watch but it lacks a more gritty realism I was half expecting. Instead Abrams aims for a more tongue-in-cheek affair aiming to please both the older and newer Star Trek fans.All the cast is very good and Chris Pine has a natural aura of likability. However, does he have to be so anti-establishment? The known crew of the Enterprise come together rather too willingly and matter of factly and whilst we have tension between Kirk and Spock the rest of the crew are just swept in to the fold without due friction.The film has a lot of action, special effects and although the story is rather smart in its black-hole, time travel plot it frustrates on its most prominent point. Why is Nero so embittered by Spock, we never really get a plausible explanation except he couldn't save Nero's planet and thus Nero's wife was killed, is that enough to harbor such vengeance? Star Trek for me was a fun, tongue-in-cheek film that doesn't take itself too seriously. I can appreciate Abrams directorial position on this and the tight-rope he would of been on to please both the old and new fans. However, for me Star Trek lacked an impact or a particular wow factor to make this a totally successful revitalisation",7,0,3,21 December 2009
Inglourious Basterds," Inglouriously uncomfortable
","This is not a film that you can pleasantly enjoy, you can appreciate the technical expertise of the film but Inglourious Basterds is a juvenile and ill-judged plot.Firstly the film has a good beginning, well shot with the tension built up well and a fine introduction to Colonel Hans Landa played brilliantly by Christoph Waltz. However, after this start begins a mish-mash of genre styles which are confusing. What was with the western music? It did not at all fit with the film, and the way Inglourious is divided into chapters was odd and certainly unnecessary. Inglourious Basterds is spattered with impressive camera shots and there is no denying Tarantino's strength with dialogue. However, scenes are too lengthy and drag on. Some of these scenes are too brazen or bloodthirsty and many of the peripheral characters are largely dolloped in a comic-caricature style. Brad Pitt for this deliverance does not fit the build for Lieutenant Alan Raine, and falls short of offering a character of any vividness. However its comic exuberance does bring momentum when the film is heavily burdened and stagnated with discourse. I understand that the film was meant to have a comic-like feel, as I have implied so far but it is thwarted by its infantile development, which at times was distasteful and uncomfortable. The lengthy scenes are all embellished for the finale, and this was the worst misjudgment. The final scenes are over done, and over-cooked it is an ugly and uncomfortable end.Inglourious Basterds is technically good but the story is black and distasteful, the comedy edge is not well-judged and for all its bravado it cannot hide its fundamental flaw, being its inability to provide satisfaction from its setup to its ill-conclusion.",7,5,9,28 December 2009
Star Trek Into Darkness," Master of Emotion
","Into Darkness is a thrilling and affecting sequel. It shifts from the youthful and cheeky beginnings of the re-boot to what I consider to be a more mature and sophisticated piece of film-making. It masters the emotional turmoil, and character relationships but is less rigorous to the needs of story-telling.The shift of tone is welcome and Into Darkness moves ably through two-thirds of its running time, in an absorbing, tumultuous and thrilling cocktail of character arcs, suspense, and a non too over the top infusion of light relief. Scotty, although somewhat still an irritant, has markedly toned down his rhetoric to match the more sombre affair. In fact, Into Darkness strength is the emotional sweep of the film, the blooming relationship between Kirk and Spock the finest example.It is a shame that when Into the Darkness is at is apex of tension it fails to sure up the plot. We are left bemused as to the magnitude of Khan's potential as we are never fully appraised of Khan's pre-cryo sleep life. I am still not sure of how the 72 torpedoes came about, and how they got where they did, and why. Nor is it fully understood where Admiral Marcus's concern of all out war with the Klingon Empire manifested? Is he a military hawk out to provoke war or a man with inside knowledge only wishing to keep the peace? The introduction of Alice Eve seems forced upon us, and the Enterprise accept her presence matter of factly. We discover later that her family connections save the Enterprise from imminent destruction, this is a little too fortuitous. Lastly, and most pointedly the death of Captain Kirk, (which was highly affecting) in a sequel, seemed somewhat pretentious on the writers part. It felt like the grand end of Star Trek not the very beginnings.Into Darkness is a feast for the eyes and hugely entertaining. The emotional turmoil is engrossing and it cannot but wet your appetite for the voyages before it. Although Into Darkness fails to tie-up some loose ends it is gorgeous to watch.",8,3,5,9 September 2013
Terminator Salvation," Entertaining but a shame it did not provide depth.
","Terminator Salvation manages to entertain with its special effects and its bleak vision of the future. Although one could suggest or come up with a number of arguments as to the evident flaws in the storyline, for once I enjoyed the film and forgive it its plot holes.Terminator Salvation could be watch as a standalone movie and would be interesting enough. The special effects are very impressive and the bleak scenery and derelict buildings really add a sense of despair, and convey the prolonged war between Skynet and man. Christian Bale and Sam Worthington do a good job with their characters, and Bale for what it is worth is the perfect actor to fulfill the role of John O'Connor.At points the editing, or screenplay is not altogether coherent, and gets frustrating (particular how past events are not explained) but I can just about forgive this and, although I had to grit my teeth the introduction of a special effects laden Arnold Schwarnegger.Okay, Terminator Salvation is too much action and not enough depth and characterisation but it has a mild emotional impact and is an enjoyable film to watch.",7,2,3,16 August 2009
500 Days of Summer," 95 minutes of Summer
","The strength of 500 Days of Summer is all in the telling of the story. The quirky script, and rather original format is much more beguiling than the all too regular linear romantic tale.The story depicts the 500 days that Tom Hansen encounters Summer Finn and their ambiguous, unconventional and absorbing relationship. The film is partly narrated and gives 500 Days a rather comforting feel as though the Narrator is an all wise deity, indeed he inform us of the outcome of the film at the onset. The film thereafter is conveyed in a grounded but other worldly feel... If that makes sense.The relationship is brought whimsically and imaginatively to life by the almost random fluttering between the 500 days. The interchange between such days never becomes tiresome. The ups-and-downs are injected with life by two great young actors. Levitt plays Tom with aplomb, and provides a subtle coolness whilst conveying the almost touchable emotional angst. Summer is much the same as Tom rather a cool chick but remains rather evasive throughout. Deschanel providing a wonderful performance by producing an enchanting aura around Summer. There are some excellent moments in particular the 'Reality' and 'Expectations' scene, it is not only intriguing viewing but a raw depiction of human emotion provided in a refreshing way. The imaginative 'dance scene' conveying the joys of Tom Hansen as the first shoots of romance spring is aptly deft at providing his internal emotions. The film is intersperse with segments of music, which help glide the film along and resonate a certain connectivity to the emotions of Tom and Summer. One personal gripe was the Sweet Disposition track which plays frequently through the film. I just don't like the song.I did have a few problems with the film one being the idea that Tom's young sister can provide relationship advise. Although this is rather endearing it is too quirky and mis-directed. The film also ends rather gimmicky when Tom encounters a lady at a job interview. Lastly, the film brings a rather startlingly revelation near the end of the film concerning Summer, which seemed like a last minute afterthought and had an abruptness which I wasn't keen upon.500 Days of Summer is original, refreshing and excellently brought to life through the direction of Marc Webb, the novel screenplay and the great performances from Deschanel and Levitt. A film to be watched and admired for its well-structured and creative story.",8,0,0,22 January 2010
Juno," A Showcase for Cody but overtly so.
","I watched this film after its spectacular commercial success and its recognition at the Academy Awards. The film follows the life of 16-year old Juno who has just discovered that she is pregnant with her best friend Bleeker. Juno is a quirky, off-beat and almost surreal storyline, it develops, and this was probably the intention, on an artificial plane.Juno, is the most mature 16-year old I'd imagine you will ever come across. Juno's use of words run across a scale where a dictionary would be a handy, to the usual colloquialisms of youth. Ellen Page plays Juno very well but it really is not a 16-year old she is enacting, it is a maturer person. It is hard to really except that such a 16 year-old and her family would be so calm and considerate on the discovery of the pregnancy.The screenplay, written by Cody, has a good quality and shows her potential. However, with the artificial plot comes scenes, moments which seem to be there to showcase the talents of Cody. The film just doesn't flow at times and is setup to deliver lines which do not seem to be embedded in logic.Off tangent but nonetheless something I must mention are the musical interludes, overtures which I found to be ill advised. In Juno, it plays way too much music to be seen as considered pieces, and is rather overly done and over-cooked.Juno is almost fairytale like and although I can accept it is not meant to be based on 'real life' I am a little disgruntled that it seems to incorporate too many 'one-liners' and implausible dialogue . Juno does show Cody's talent, potential and self-assurance but it has a sense of self-indulgence. I must mention Michael Cera (Bleeker) whose performance I very much enjoyed.",6,0,3,28 March 2009
Yes Man," Good
","Yes Man is a promising if not altogether fulfilling film. Although the film could inspire it is more of a middle of the way production, which entertains but fails to do anymore.Zoey Deschanel is lovable and beautiful as the eccentric Alison who bumps into Carl after he begins to say Yes. There chemistry is spot on and just right for the film, providing an engaging relationship. To the credit of Carrey you forget that he is playing Carl he molds into the character very well.Yes Man does unfortunately become coarse and lewd when it does not need to straying into inappropriate territory as though trying to provide meagre offerings of popular juvenile comedy which have been prominent in recent years.Rhys Darby as Norman provides the biggest laughs with the Harry Potter themed party and a nod to 300, but on the comedy side of things Yes man is more a gentle showering of laughter.Yes Man is a good film but it just doesn't either sway to a more serious or more comedic mood, it is pretty linear throughout and it just doesn't have that enchanting factor. Yes, go and see this film as it entertains but it has no element to make it more than just that.",7,2,2,28 December 2009
Milk," Harvey Milk brings hope.
","Prior to watching Milk I had no knowledge of the man Harvey Milk accept that he represented a gay community in harsh times, and managed to attain political office. The film is excellent, the screenplay is succinct and informative and Sean Penn sparkles as Harvey Milk in this stirring and gripping social truth.The film follows the political rise of Harvey Milk who on moving to San Francisco decides to run for political office on the social and moral injustices facing the gay populace. The strength of the film is in its highlighting of the political and social injustices at that time. The incorporation of actual real footage really conveys the deep embedded homophobic prejudices in the United State. Without the real footage I think the film would have struggled to project this sense of underlying tension.The entire cast excel but Sean Penn is the star. Penn embodies Harvey Milk, he is compelling and enchanting and nuances every action fluently and ceaselessly without fail. Milk represents not only the gay community but the minority populace, he is a lovable and determined individual. Van Sant makes it clear that Milk could not have managed his rise to politics without his close colleagues, and this is an astute point. Harvey Milk was an eccentric and beguiling character but him alone was not the driving force of change it was those pursuing their rights and freedoms.Within the well-formulated screenplay which stirs the emotions, there are a number of good pieces of cinematography and the costume and set designs are exact.Milk is more than a film about the man, it is a social commentary of the prejudice faced not only in the gay community but by other minorities as a whole. Milk is a film about social rights, freedoms and the need to hope for a better world for today and tomorrow, and one cannot argue with that.",8,0,2,8 March 2010
Cloverfield," Startles and thrills.
","In Manhattan a party of well-wishers are ready to say goodbye to Rob who is departing to Japan after a successful promotion. That very evening a monstrosity is awoken from the ocean-depths who causes death and destruction in its wake. These events are all captured on film as those who survive seek to remain alive.Cloverfield has obvious parallels to 'Godzilla'. However, what makes Cloverfield rather startling is its contemporary resonance with the terror attacks of this century. As one would of surmised, the whole film is through the lens of a camcorder, which is a clever device to really convey the fear of the unknown to the audience and indeed those actually their. This has an obvious implausibility in that it is unrealistic that any person would willingly hold a camcorder throughout the ordeal but if you can forget this, its rather thrilling. The special effects are of the highest quality and the acting is really well-delivered. The running time is perfect, and it never lags. There are a few highly unlikely events, which are rather frustrating, and unfortunately bring my vote down. I can however appreciate that these events have an almost inevitable inclusion in the film to keep it flowing.Cloverfield is a good watch with thrills and high entertainment value, certainly worth the time to watch.",7,1,2,28 February 2009
Knocked Up," Funny
","'Knocked-Up' was far better than I had hoped. I was not impress with the '40 Year-Old Virgin' or 'Superbad' which were crass and uninspiring. 'Knocked-Up' in stark contrast still maintains the adolescence humor of '40 Year-Old Virgin' or 'Superbad' but is far more intelligent and witty, bordering at times on comedic brilliance. It is also able to match the comedy with a sincere thread throughout, which is hard to achieve. Seth Rogen is great as the expectant father, I am unsure how much of the script was improvised but there were many moments of laugh-out-loud originality, the whole cast delivers on the acting front. At times the jokes can be a little too crude, but overall they are well managed. Special mention to the scene in the Las Vegas hotel between Rogen and Paul Rudd, high on mushrooms their interplay is spot-on and it is moments like this which make it memorable.The one criticism I do have is the last 30 minutes, the gags do not seem to work as well due to the more serious tone, and the film lumbers a little. I respect that the film wanted to make an emotional punch at the end but it dallied a little too long.'Knocked-Up' is an enjoyable film and I recommend that you make an effort to watch it.",7,4,5,12 December 2008
Sweeney Todd: The Demon Barber of Fleet Street," Darkly dramatic but without depth.
","Unfortunately, I felt that Sweeney Todd proceeded from one-musical piece to another without the necessary development. Although music can, to some extent embody emotions better than the written word, in this instance, it gave one insight but not enough depth.Sweeney Todd is certainly dramatic enough to maintain interest but I felt unfulfilled by its drive towards the climatic end. The music at times is overly long, which could of been better utilised through dialogue. However, the acting is excellent with Johnny Depp, Helen Bonham Carter, Allan Rickman, Timothy Spall and Sacha Baron Cohen all producing fine performances.The films dark story, excellent production design and dramatical musical score do portray the black emotional core of Sweeney Todd, and it has its periods of excellence, but it does not have sufficient substance come the end.",7,1,4,18 May 2008
Gone Baby Gone," A promising debut.
","Ben Affleck an actor who has been unfairly criticized for his choices as an actor, walks behind the camera for his directorial debut in 'Gone Baby Gone'. A story set in Boston, Casey Affleck, a private investigator, is given the task of finding the whereabouts of a missing child.The premise has the opportunity to propel this film into a suspenseful and thoughtful study into missing child cases. Although it does have its moments of intensity and suspense, there is not much subtlety in trying to cover the obvious red herrings and the eventual outcome. If one considers the character Casey Affleck plays, who is supposedly known locally, he approaches his investigation with brash disregard for sensibility - where is the logic of antagonising the local community especially when you are already on first-name terms? Casey Affleck's partner Michelle Monaghan acts rather against character near the finale, used rather as a tool to fortify the difficult predicament that Casey Affleck already faces, which I felt was not necessary.Ben Affleck does a good job behind the lens but the story to me is rather contrived in order to reach its eventual conclusion of an insurmountably tough moral choice.",6,0,0,22 November 2008
Watchmen," Watch the time
","Jack Snyder has created a well-crafted if overly-long film with Watchmen. The artistic and glossy comic book style are well delivered and the performances are on the whole good. However, it embellishes characters too much when the film could have been cut or more time provided to drive the story.The opening credits are wonderfully produced to bring a quick but timely impression on the background to the film we are to follow. There is no denying Snyder's flair and all-round artistic quality in this sequence and throughout Watchmen.Jackie Earle Haley is the star performer as Rorschach with a bitter and violent edginess. For me Watchmen spends too much time in its own self-pity, wallowing in the bleakness of the world. Characters are introduced but are dragged out to long when more exposition should have been given to driving the plot. The unfortunate 'love-triangle' is a ticking hindrance to the story and may have been a cinematic tool to provide a respite from the bleakness.Watchmen is a dark and brooding film with great artistic and creative merit. However, Watchmen kind of gets caught up in its narrative a little too much, and this is its achilles heel.",7,1,3,1 January 2010
28 Weeks Later," Muscle without brain.
","'28 Weeks Later' is a well-executed horror flick. The opening sequence is a pulse-rating beginning, it is just very unfortunate that it proceeded with brawn (blood, and scary people) rather than brain to its eventual conclusion.The problem for me is the fact that an individual although infected with the virus has the genetic mutation to thus be immune - this is rather far fetched. If I were to accept that a mutation would be possible I'm afraid '28 Weeks Later' would still disappoint. It is is further compounded by many frustrating and annoying events which take place, far beyond the boundaries of the realms of practicality, that makes this a fast and furious horror flick bereft of intellect.Some of the shots, special effects must be applauded along with strong performances from Rose Byrne and Imogen Poots. There are a couple of unexpected twists but '28 Weeks Later' for me is a bitter sweet experience, which is much more bitter for its illogical events.",5,2,3,27 July 2008
21," Tiringly Straightforward
","21 does not generate the thrills or excitement associated with the casino world. It is very laborious effort with an all too predictable tale.Kevin Spacey adds a bit of glamour to the film but even he suffers from the films ineptitude of style and direction. The mathematical geniuses employed to make lots of money playing blackjack are cocksure (which they are meant to be) but they are decidedly unappealing protagonists (if that is what you deem them to be) . Jim Sturgess is the strongest of the cast and makes the most of a tame story.The film does not entertain and focuses very much on the all too cumbersome teenage themes of money, love and friendship. This is sadly a tired, wearisome and sluggish creation.",3,4,5,3 August 2009
Knowing," Too much E.T
","I was surprised upon viewing this film as it was a lot more dark and a touch more horrifying than one might have expected. For all its special effects and intended dark tone it struggles to draw in the cinema-goer.Nicholas Cage is always good, a picture with fast action (although this is more broody) grand special effects and he does not fail to deliver. Knowing does create a suspenseful atmosphere but its engagement with extra-terrestrial beings and its far-fetched conclusion really do hamper any strengths the film had.I was not embroiled in the escapades of Knowing, apart from the great special effects it lumbers somewhat and doesn't manage to keep up the ante to a level of satisfaction.",4,0,1,9 August 2009
The White Ribbon," Haunting and disturbing
","The White Ribbon is a brooding and deeply disturbing piece of cinema, it is both powerful as it is unsettling. Although, it is rather extreme and disturbing,it manages to provide a stern voice.The village in White Ribbon is hardly ever shown in a light that one could suggest was tranquil, vibrant or positive. There is always this underlying and potent misery languishing around the characters. The beautiful black and white cinematography, which is very exact provides I think this antonym of beauty and ugliness. At Haneke's most bleakest the black and white serves as a truly haunting presence.The film assess the strict religious upbringing of the community, and within these environs Haneke proceeds to provide a deeply malignant underbelly of both moral corruption and repression. The disturbing events that askew the supposed peaceful and obedient community serve as almost a repost to those of the hierarchy, being those in the most respected positions being the Baron, The Pastor and The Doctor, as they are all affected somehow.There are some strong scenes in the White Ribbon in particular when a young boy is learning the meaning of the word death and when the son of the Pastor provides a replacement bird for his father's newly deceased one (one of only a handful of pleasant moments in the film)are very emotive.Haneke never provides answers to the events depicted although you can garner what you wish. In essence the disturbing events appear to be either rather unfortunate or the actions of the youth who are repressed by the community and wish to exact their revenge in the only way they know, or can.The White Ribbon is a powerful film conveying how Haneke believes evil ferments. The village is used in essence as a microcosm for the state of Germany in 1918, and provides a possible reason for why Germany turned to fascism. Although I found it at times rather unpalatable, and it is not a film you will enjoy,it is undeniably potent in its delivery.",7,0,3,29 March 2010
Ratatouille," Underwhelming
","Ratatouille fails to deliver the Pixar experience that we so know and love. The animation is perfect, which is now expected, but the narrative lacks wit, passion and drive and left an expectant reviewer underwhelmed.Many of the characters in Ratatouille are peripheral to the plot and here lies the problem. The story is rather linear it does not twist or turn, it is happy to focus on Remy's escapades. The characters that do have a firmer foothold within the story are not entertaining or fun... There is no endearment.By far the best character has to be Anton Ego voiced wonderfully by Peter O'Toole - an egotistical, self-assured food critic... And that is what is missing from Ratatouille the quirkiness of character so evident in previous Pixar animations.Ratatouille is an improvement on the just sufferable Cars but apart from the last fifteen-minutes of the film and some funny moments, which there were not nearly enough, it was a rather sombre and just about satisfactory affair.",6,2,5,27 October 2008
The Lego Movie," Everything is Awesome.
","Logic would dictate that a film based on Lego would be a childish endeavor. However, the Lego Movie proves such ill-aspersions wrong and succeeds on many levels, and indeed in finding the inner-child in us all.The Lego Movie takes you on a relentless and manically choreographed adventure with Emmet (voiced perfectly by Chris Pratt), a somewhat inconspicuous Lego construction worker, whose world is turned upside down when he discovers the 'Piece of Resistance'.The audience needs to sit tight and strap themselves in for an adventure, which can be overpowering (just like a child's imagination) but always entertaining. The script is witty, and the creativity oozes off the screen as we come across Lord Business, the Kragle, and all sorts of wonderful concoctions.This is a film that catapults you into the Lego world and does not cease to impress. Everything is Awesome (the theme tune) is utterly delightful, and ridiculously difficult to eradicate from your everyday thoughts.The Lego Movie is an adventure that has heart, imagination and creativity in spades, and at best a message wrapped up for children and adult alike. A joy.",8,0,1,6 August 2014
Tropic Thunder," Original but not as funny as one may expect.
","From the moment I heard of Tropic Thunder I thought that this had the potential to be a film of real originality and zest. I was rather excited about the premise, a premise which if well executed could be a real satirical success.Tropic Thunder unfortunately does not hit the mark enough, or provide the kind of satirical or comedy impression that I was seeking. Tropic Thunder really revels in slapstick, over-the-top escapades and every so often gets it right.Out of the named cast Jack Black is the least impressive. Black plays an uninspiring character that from the outset, that hideous film trailer does not bode well for Black, as he shouts his way through the film and grates rather too much to make his appearance enjoyable. Ben Stiller is the most impressive of the cast, and produces the most laughs that this film has to offer. Robert Downey Jnr is good, however it is sometimes hard to decipher what he is saying and rather surprising that he has been given an Academy nomination for his performance.Tom Cruise cameo's as Les Grossman, the film magnate who only speaks in diatribes, is a character you will either love or find too offensive to enjoy, I think he just about gets away with it. If nothing else Les Grossman's dance moves at the end to Ludicrous 'Get Back' will put a wry smile on your face.Tropic Thunder is over-the-top, and does push the boundaries with its crude and excessive language. Essentially, Tropic Thunder relishes its moment in the spotlight too the point where some may find it rather uncomfortable . It is not all that bad but it is not the comedy of laughs that I assumed it would be.",6,0,0,30 January 2009
Scott Pilgrim vs. the World," The Scott Pilgrim Experience
","Scott Pilgrim is a heavily stylised mesh of arcade and comic exuberance. It's bold and eye-catching graphics certainly give this film memorability, and helps transport the film into a playful and wistful world. However, for all its enjoyment it is the foreknowing of events which hamper the Scott Pilgrim experience.In terms of enjoyment, Scott Pilgrim excels early on with its charming flare and originality. It is very youthful, refreshing and dynamic in the way it strings scenes together. As well as providing this visual experience there is a constant stream of witty interplay. This is most visibly conveyed by the wonderful Michael Cera who excels as Scott Pilgrim with his goofy and radiant charm offensive.Where Scott Pilgrim fails is when we understand that he must fight 'Seven Evil Xs'. Once the first two contests have passed, it becomes a film of re-treading, and although it conjures different effects to each contest it becomes less of a thrill and its adolescent vibrancy becomes regrettably diluted.Scott Pilgrim certainly entertains, and if it had managed to cut half-an-hour from the film or reduce the number of 'Evil Xs' it could have been a really enjoyable roller-coaster of a ride. It is a film which I recommend seeing as it is so originally brought to life and a rather refreshing movie experience. The film does have heart, and although Scott Pilgrim might not of won over the world, and it does lose its initial momentum, it did win me over.",7,0,3,21 January 2011
Enchanted," Enchanted
","One cannot but be cheered by the magic of Enchanted. This is a Disney film that does not falter and delivers without disappointment.Amy Adams is outstanding as the lost princess in New York who rightly was nominated for a Golden Globe for this role, and should have got an Academy nod. Her cheery smile and flamboyance make Enchanted an all encompassing, entertaining, fun film. All the cast are very good along with some catchy tunes, 'That's How you Know' and 'So Close' particularly memorable, together with excellent choreography and cinematography.Enchanted is a beautiful piece of work and I love the way it has been delivered to the screen - It's just Magical cinema.",8,1,1,28 June 2008
Quantum of Solace," This is not Bond.
","Quantum of Solace shifts considerable from the impressive Casino Royale. The events which unfold in Quantum of Solace are unengaging and bitterly disappointing.The film opens with a car chase, a chase which cuts uncontrollably from one shot to another. I assume that the chase was meant to be an impressive edge-of-your-seat beginning but it had no such effect nor did it make any impression on the plot. I think that generally this sets the tone for the film.The plot is lifeless it just doesn't ooze any excitement, charm or indeed danger. Olga Kurylenko doesn't fulfill her role adequately until later in the film, at the start she seems to really struggle. Daniel Craig nearly loses his star billing to Judi Dench, why does M have such a dominant role? And poor Gemma Arteton plays a British agent who is killed off just as quickly as she is introduced - Why? Quantum of Solace doesn't fulfill the Bond thrill factor, it doesn't get close. The film is hopelessly devoid of intelligence, danger or charm. There are plot holes and an inability to deliver a coherent story.",5,5,7,6 April 2009
No Country for Old Men," The art of suspense and tension.
","In the vast blankness of rural Texas, Llewellyn Moss discovers a case of money among a strewn of dead bodies. Having decided that he will take the money he places his life in more danger than he initially anticipated.No Country for Old Men is a quiet film. There is not that much dialogue or score to sway emotions, and one is left to contemplate the actions of the characters on screen. It is in fact a more sombre and aspirational piece of film making, which does not 'dress-up' scenes for excitement and instead crafts nail-biting suspense and tension. There are some truly vivid scenes, and this film should be watched for its showcase of adrenaline churning moments of tension.Although No Country for Old Men succeeds to a certain extent in achieving its cinematic aspirations, it is unfortunately flawed by a lack of substance and structure. Although the cinematography, lighting and prose of Ed Tom Bell suggest there is more underneath the surface I would argue that there is little depth. The film also does not convey the purpose of certain characters, who they are, what they do, and events unfold with little explanation.The characters are what make No Country for Old Men enjoyable. In particular the supporting cast of Carson Wells (played wonderfully by Woody Harrelson) and Carla Jean Moss (the excellent Kelly McDonald)are fun and interesting to watch. Javier Bardem is the obvious stand-out performer as the psychopathic killer who follows his own peculiar 'rules' of engagement.No Country for Old Men is expertly executed in the art of suspense and tension and has a haunting quality, which is aided by a memorable cast of characters. However, No Country for Old Men has its flaws, and this makes it less memorable than is probably should have been.",8,1,3,7 June 2008
District 9," Fesh, original Sci-Fi
","Neil Blompkamp is a director and writer to make note of. District 9 is a potent brand of gritty political realism with a most refreshing and original sci-fi twist.The aliens who are referred to as 'prawns' in District 9 are not pleasant, charming or remotely attractive in fact they are rather grotesque beings. What Blompkamp has done by creating this against the grain extra-terrestrial is provide the possibility that aliens do not have to be wise etc and this is a welcomed novelty. Furthermore, to a certain degree are we meant to feel pity for such creatures if they act so horridly? District 9 follows the exploits of Wikus Van Der Merwe an overly bureaucratic field agent working for Multi National United (MNU), a private company contracted to ensure that the 'prawns' who are languishing in District 9 are taken to new camps in District 10. The best way I can describe Wikus is as a dislikeable David Brent whose eccentricity rather grates. In fact the way he teaches a trainee field agent to deal with 'prawns' and the way he interacts with them is rather repulsive at times. Blomkamp intentionally projects Wikus in this light and that impresses me, no stereotypical hero here. Although, come the end I am unsure what Blompkamp wanted his audience to feel with Wikus I didn't particularly feel any empathy but lukewarm attachment.The 'prawns' are well developed in appearance if a little, if you forgive the pun 'under cooked' and you empathise with Christopher Johnson and his son (who is rather adorable in a weird way). Much of the aliens predicament is left for us to extrapolate what we want, I feel this is just right, we do not need to be spoon fed all the details. Blompkamp also offers a little witchcraft, which is prominent in South Africa, and this helps propel the story although a little uncomfortably.The action is brought to us in the slums of Johannesburg, the defintive setting for the themes raised, and evident feel of the squalor, poverty and segregation is brought most vividly to life. The cinematography and editing is mixed well to bring that documentary feel with the necessity of cinematic action. The first twenty minutes do go past quickly almost in a blur as the documentary is cut and edited to bring us to the forefront of the current circumstances. I did feel a little discombobulated by this but District 9 managed to stamp its authority on this set-up pretty impressively as the film progressed.District 9 is one of the most original sci-fi films in recent years it touches on obvious issues but the manner in which it is done is beguiling and refreshing. Not many films can be as entertaining as District 9 and deliver a serious message with such vibrancy as this little treasure.",8,2,4,11 January 2010
The Assassination of Jesse James by the Coward Robert Ford," Poignant & Powerful.
",Although the film title gives away the plot do not be dissuaded from watching this wonderfully rich production.Everything about this film has been created with real sheen from the cinematography to the screenplay. Casey Affleck is outstanding as Robert Ford while Brad Pitt is staggeringly engaging as notorious Jesse James. I was mesmerized by the film and rather perplexed at it lack of Oscar nominations. This is the first film that I have seen in a while that I would place near the heights of greatness!Go watch it and enjoy!,9,2,6,14 April 2008
Twilight," A sparkle of light.
","If you can forgive the MTV production, and its High School Musical tit-bits you may just enjoy and be surprised by Twilight although the romance be a little too overpowering.The acting is pretty good on the whole but at times both Pattinson and Stewart are rather deadpan. The story does not really help with its love at first sight, I don't care your a vampire! But what else did I really expect? The story may be undeniably overly romantic but it has its moments of good contrast between light and dark moods, with its vampire aspect bringing obvious interest to proceedings. The special effects are well-worked and the music is well crafted into the film. Hardwicke does well as a director and their is one scene where Bella leaves her father for fear of being attacked by a hunter vampire, and has to lie to him to make good her escape, which was managed and acted quite nicely. Having said that Hardwicke fails to give the film a more serious and engaging tone that I would have liked to have seen. For all Twilight's wrongs it does have an allure. How will this Romeo-Juliet romance ever blossom considering their predicament? The most appealing aspect of Twilight for me is the world of the vampire and how it functions. Hopefully the sequel 'New Moon' can become a touch more grounded and provide more depth, but I sense that the youth to which it is marketed will not be prevented from their heavy dose of romance.",6,0,2,15 June 2009
The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey," Why three hours?
","On learning that The Hobbit, a 400 page children's book was to be extended over three films (Unexpected Journey being the first) it seemed Peter Jackson may have been seeking a compromise between the children friendly book and the more darker and foreboding LOTR trilogy. Unsurprisingly, An Unexpected Journey fails to transcend the source material, although it is debatable if this was Jackson's intention.The first fifty minutes is actually the most impactful (Gollum's appearance not too far behind). There are nice homage's to LOTR and it provides the necessary back-story. Most importantly, it enables the twelve dwarfs to be more than a generic rabble just fighting and squabbling. Martin Freeman starts as he ends the film, playing Bilbo Baggins with aplomb, in a fine performance, providing the understated and yet determined nature of the intrepid adventurer. Once Bilbo leaves Bag End however the magic ceases.The rest of the film is a number of set-pieces which fail to propel the story. What we have is an A to B to C without an emotional arch or purposeful plot. One continues to watch An Unexpected Journey waiting for Jackson to rein in on the needless superfluous activity but it does not happen. It is at this juncture that one begins to accept, rather belatedly, that An Unexpected Journey is not the cross-over adaptation that one may have hoped. Jackson's 'off-the-map' excursion with Elrond, Galadriel, Gandalf and Saruman only help to conflate rather than placate the elder viewer.The special effects are satisfactory, if not altogether an improvement on LOTR. Unfortunately, this is for me An Unexpected Journey's biggest fault. It becomes apparent through the effects that Jackson has decided, pardon the juxtaposition, 'evil-friendly'. The appearance of the Great Goblin and his cohorts, Azogand his wolves are much less menacing than LOTR and have an intentional illusory, and non-frightening composition. Can one even forgive the over-intrusive nature of the subtitles? If more credence is needed that An Unexpected Journey is a more youthful creation one only need to look at the manner in which Bilbo comes across Gollum, and the way in which the Company fall into the Goblin Kingdom. One has to suspend disbelief at the comic book survival skills of the party (noticeably altered from the book too).An Unexpected Journey does have its moments. There is some fun bravado, a couple of meaningful montages, and some much needed pathos. The acting is of the highest quality.I have to conclude that An Unexpected Journey was intended for a younger audience, and I cannot begrudge Jackson for this. However, the three hour long running time is just unnecessary when to all intents and purposes a longer film would be more inclined to an older audience. As a consequence An Unexpected Journey should be cut with big scissors. A big disappointment and I only hope that parts two and three try to provide a more menacing and intelligent cross-over.",5,77,134,19 December 2012
The Mist," Fails to rise above the the genre.
","One normal afternoon in Maine while gathering groceries, the shoppers within the store are surrounded by a strange Mist. Add to this predicament a lone bloody man screaming 'Dont go out there! There's something in the Mist!' and you have a mouth-watering prospect. Sadly, 'The Mist' from its good beginnings fails to deliver.Usually a horror film is overly-done by this I mean it focuses too much on the fright, jumps, scares, the usual fanfare that swells this genre. Surprisingly, 'The Mist' manage to balance the horror rather well, attempting to bring a human connection to the supernatural events. However, this is where 'The Mist' falls flat and becomes an average horror film. Marcia Gay Harden's character overshadows the film for far too long, her apocalyptic - end-of-the- world - preaching rather tire on proceedings.Thomas Jane should be commended for his solid performance, playing a stereotypical lead role but bringing real life and belief to his character. The special effects range from poor to good but Darabont maintains the atmosphere of dark, despair very well.'The Mist' concludes in what I can only describe as being ill-conceived and contrived. When one feels it is being brought to its logical and brave end it reverts to a preposterous last five seconds. Its is a shame but as a whole 'The Mist' just doesn't work.",5,1,3,21 November 2008
Stardust," It had potential
","Adapted from Neil Gaiman's novel, Tristan a young luckless-in-love man embarks on a journey to find a shooting star across 'The Wall' into the magical world of Stormhold. Stardust is a mish-mash of epic and low-key cinema. The cinematography at times along with the musical score, and special effects have a similar feel to the Lord of the Rings. However, such grandiosity, which one can admire, unfortunately, does not seem to come together with other moments of inadequacy. I felt at times that I was not watching a film made for cinema, at certain moments it felt like a film-for-television, which was a real shame.The story has potential and indeed some elements were highly watchable and original. Robert De Niro performs well in his role as an air-captain, while Michelle Pfeiffer is pretty scary as a witch in search of eternal youth. But potential is no good if you don't use it well and it tires a long-time before the end.Stardust isn't bad, but considering the potential strength of the story, some of the very good special effects and cinematography it really feels as though it punches below its heavyweight potential, and for that Stardust disappoints.",6,4,7,14 December 2008
I Am Legend," Potential to be more.
","The year is 2012 and New York is an abandoned, derelict and ruined city. Alone in this barren, and utterly disturbing vision of New York is Robert Neville and Sam, his dog, who are the only survivors of a deadly virus that has wiped out humanity.First and foremost I have never read the book to which this film was adapted nor have I seen the previous two films connected to the book. I can however state that I Am Legend is brought vividly to life by the superb special effects. The images of New York are impeccable and for that reason alone this film is worth seeing. Will Smith is on top-form, and he is wonderfully supported by the talents of the dogs that played Sam. Indeed I Am Legend works well in places, there are a number of memorable scenes (Neville talking to the mannequins, his radio message, the chills when he goes into the dark looking for Sam, and playing golf aboard USS Intrepid) including the perfectly rendered relationship between Neville and Sam, and their final scene, which is heart-breaking.Unfortunately, I Am Legend fails to be more than it could have been. The beings which roam the New York streets at night are not that badly designed but I wish they hadn't been created with the same lack of mental capabilities or humanity as those zombies created in '28 Days Later' and given such super-human strength. The appearance of two other survivors into Neville's lonely existence is not a bad thing but it lacked depth. I don't know but I guess I wanted something more grander or philosophical from I Am Legend which unfortunately does not transpire.I Am Legend is a good film, and I want to like it more than I do, as it has the right ingredients to make it great. However, it lacks something... Maybe a bit of heart and soul, which it has in portions but not in sufficient substance.",7,1,2,22 March 2009
The Game," 'The Game' is not worth playing.
","Average. That is the word to define this film and its implausible shenanigans. Overly long the premise sadly does not engage long-enough to be given such a period of running time.Following Nicholas Van Orton, played by Michael Douglas, we are introduced to a wealthy yet insular and empty individual. As a present from his younger brother, played by the under-used Sean Penn, events unravel which begin 'The Game'.'The Game'is unforgiving, the script is contrived and lacks a big dose of logic. Nicholas Van Orton, an investment banker forgoes common sense in situations which demand attention. It seems that the film is driven by its own arrogance, it bypasses gaping holes in order to run across a finish line which has no audience.The story is a meshing of twists and bluffs that I'm afraid are just silly, the film does not surprise, as I'm sure it was meant to, nor act as a taut tense thriller, as I'm sure it was meant to. Mere average.",5,0,3,27 January 2008
Shrek the Third," A charming tongue-in-cheek affair.
","One is bound and has to compare Shrek the Third with its wonderful prequels and for that reason Shrek the Third is not as funny or as entertaining.The animation is adorable and as realistic and crystal-clear as ever, it really does have a real charming and aesthetic quality that surpasses other animations.I for one felt the story was well-balanced and imaginative. The story, if rather predictable as to its eventual end, is reprieved by the introduction of other minor characters such as Lancelot, Captain Hook, Merlin and so on. Shrek the Third does not coast along as easily as previous Shreks, possibly due to the gags not being as funny, but for me Puss in Boots and Donkey are not given enough screen-time.Shrek the Third is an entertaining and charming picture. The film may not live up to Shrek 1 and 2, but Shrek 1 and 2 were roaring successes and Shrek the Third is competently managed and mastered. I hear Shrek Four maybe in the pipeline and I do hope that it does get the green light, on the basis of Shrek the Third the green light should be not be long in coming!",6,0,1,5 October 2008
The Hurt Locker," Strong Set-pieces
","The Hurt Locker is a nervy and intrepid story that has strength in its telling but relies heavily on the combat to provide the psychological meaning without the essential conjecture from the characters involved.There is no denying the intensity and suspense that the Hurt Locker provides through its set pieces, which are skillfully brought to life through the reality of the cinematography. Yet the Hurt Locker consists of these gripping situation which seem to always find the unfortunate three soldiers. There is a lot of action and a number of static shots to convey the psychological torment of the soldiers but it is rather bereft of dialogue to give it a more pronounced emotivity.The relationship between Sgt Sanborn, Eldridge and Sgt William James the new leader of the elite Bomb Squad Unit is passable but what I found particularly frustrating was the scene where they contemplate killing Sgt James? Was this for real? This scene is acutely bizarre. Naturally the film guides itself to the situation where there is general respect between them, which was rather rudimentary.I enjoyed a number of cameos in the Hurt Locker, which gave a certain jolt to the proceedings, and Jeremy Renner does a fine job in the lead as Sgt James. Although The Hurt Locker has some very good set pieces and the film is most of the time rather riveting it relies on these moments to capture the audience a little too much.",7,1,5,2 January 2010
The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo," Was never a template for the big screen.
","The book's commercial success has inevitably lead to the development of this adaptation. Based on the unfolding plot of the film, however skeletal it may be to the book, it has certainly extinguished any interest I had in this literary phenomenon.The film is rather formulaic and generic but hopes to bolster its difference with its dark and broody atmosphere. However, the darkness in The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo is suffocating rather then compelling and originality or vibrancy, that I thought this film may produce (having no concept of the story), and based on its huge literary success was non-existent. Dan Brown's adaptations (Da Vinci Code, Angels & Demons) although a poor relation to his page-turning books had stimuli, something of consequence. In The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo you are joining a murder investigation which has been unsuccessful for over thirty years, and of little relevancy apart to an ensconced and broken family. Furthermore, the private investigator discovers clues that any astute and professional police investigator should of deduced.The main plot, driven by excellent performances from the two leads never gets in gear. The main protagonist's unclear past and eccentric behaviour does not excel the film in any character driven manner, and their attempt to make this film a character study come murder mystery falls flat. The screenwriters try to bring in a couple of subplots but these are barely introduced before they are just as quickly concluded.The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo is a cumbersome and idle affair with the story essentially not evolving at any satisfactory level. The film pursues its inevitable and ugly course... A story I think that should be read rather than seen.",3,2,8,10 June 2011
The Dark Knight," A Knight is Rising
","Christopher Nolan's 'The Dark Knight' is a big and bold production. The great special-effects, sharp editing and affecting score sweep the film into a high-entertainment package. It is a vast improvement on Batman Begins reaching a higher level of storytelling. Although there are self-evident inadequacies in the script this is a breakthrough film. The Dark Knight is a long film, and in this respect it surprisingly fails somewhat to provide enough depth. Instead we do get scenes where the obvious ineptitude of the police enable the plot to continue as it wishes. For example, why is a police officer in the same cell as The Joker when it was entirely unnecessary? It therefore sometimes falls more into a comic book experience conflicting unfortunately with the superior film elements. However,if this can be forgiven (as I have) Nolan has produced a successful cross-over from his somewhat comic book feature of Batman Begins. Heath Ledger is stunning as The Joker providing the emotional context and thrills. The set-pieces are as grand as they are gripping.A minor point, which I could not get away from was a particular moment when Bale is discussing gadgets with Freeman, was this just me or did anyone else feel like we were watching a James Bond and Q moment?The Dark Knight is a breakthrough film it is more majestic and gripping than any of its Batman predecessors. It is a superior film of entertainment only hampered by its over long-running time but ultimately it is a triumph.",8,15,28,1 January 2009
Taken," Not bad at all.
","In a non-stop hunt to rescue his beloved daughter from kidnappers Liam Neeson kills, maims, chases and drives cars in this relentless action/thriller set predominantly in Paris.Taken has a familiar feel to that of the Jason Bourne films except this is more direct and easier-to follow plot, which does not tarnish the film. I cannot fault the entertainment value and the intrigue that the screenplay creates but it is hampered, like many such films by fortuitous events, which frustrates me personally.Liam Neeson impresses as the ex-CIA agent and I never for one moment thought that he was not a viable operative. He gives a heartfelt and understandable desperate feel to his character with a real emotive punch. For me the best moment in the film was the actual kidnapping, it was excellently crafted and the interplay between Neeson and Maggie Grace on the phone prior to her being taken, is perfectly pitched and brings great tension.Taken is an entertaining film which does not tire. The actual premise is hard to come to terms with as it feels rather strained and events unfold regrettably with too much fortune for the protagonist but Taken is a thriller to enjoy and to be gripped by.",6,1,2,14 March 2009
Avatar," Technical Class but threadbare and tiresome.
","Avatar is a special-effects laden adventure with a tiresome story. It is only the technical nous which gives Avatar a certain gravitas that one has to acknowledge. The 3D for all its efforts is not pioneering and the media fanfare seems to be misplaced.Having watch Avatar the 3D effects are underwhelming. I have not seen any 3D films in recent years and was expecting technical wizardry, and effects which would revolutionise the cinematic experience. Instead although the effects are good and better than the standard fare it was a tremendous letdown. At times the images become blurry and in other intense action scenes rather messy. As the 3D effects did not meet the high expectations the story had to come more to the fore but its formulaic plot and threadbare story do little to propel or inject excitement.The biggest problem is the persistence to provide so much of Pandora and the Naavi way of life. It languishes in Pandora for so long that you begin to crave some human reality not the pomposity of how wonderful the world looks. The Naavi are not given enough screen-time for us to have a natural empathy for them, instead the film focuses on spirituality and the beauty of Pandora. The second-act is unashamedly stereotypical and preachy about the natural world. The second-half needed to inject fresh impetus after is initial technical offering but it plants itself in very run of the mill territory.Avatar is overly long and overly dramatic. Unfortunately, its blanket of special effects stand alone in providing the entertainment factor as the structure of the story is weighed down in a very familiar formulaic manner.",5,8,13,10 January 2010
Up," Uplifting - animation at its finest.
","Pixar just keep producing wonderful films! Up is another spectacle of genius with poignant, resonant themes and a fun, exciting and humorous script.Each and every character that we are introduced to has that personal quality whether being the grouchy yet determined Carl, the spritely and positive Kevin or the lovable Dug (the voice activated tag is a wonderful creation).The running time for this film is the shortest yet for Pixar and it is near enough perfect (although the greed in me wanted a little more running time). The intelligence of the script, with numerous witty and inpromtu moments are a real glee, and the amount of effort and attention is there for all to see. The way Carl's walking frame is used at the end as a final scene is a real showcase of Pixar's illustrious imagination.Up is more than sheer entertainment, it is an insightful and emotive picture wonderfully created and crafted. Up is a near enough flawless piece of art and it does not get much finer.",9,0,0,5 November 2009
The Happening," A Flop
","Shylamalan has had his successes, The Sixth Sense, Unbreakable and Signs. However, in recent times he has failed to deliver. The Happening unfortunately continues in the same disappointing vein.The Happening follows the flight of a husband and wife, and a child from a chemical induced matter, which is driving people to suicide. It is a chilling prospect but in retrospect Shylamalan has tied his own hands. It is a concept which is difficult to actualize without an emotional core, and far-more difficult to conclude.The film is a mighty flop, apart from fleeting moments of tension, and a good performance from Mark Whalberg in a role in which he is ill-suited to, it is awful. The Happening has no emotional engagement it is a mere film of flight, running away from a threat and nothing of substance in-between. Zooey Deschanel, although very photogenic, only manages to produce one emotive display throughout which involved her beautiful eyes, we needed moreI respect Shalayman's message, bringing forth an issue which is a the forefront of many minds today, respecting the environment and not over industrializing the planet but it doesn't work. Maybe the issue is not dealt with enough or strongly enough but it is a rather flimsy deliverance.",2,1,4,7 December 2008
The Matrix Reloaded," Reloaded struggles
","The first forty minutes of the Matrix Reloaded is actually difficult to watch. To start with a 'dream' sequence in any film is an utter let-down. There are a number of cringe-worthy moments from the superlative dialogue, the utterly unconvincing Trinity and Neo relationship (which is conveyed very poorly and artificially), and a love triangle between Morpheus, Niobe and Locke which one does not care for.The most interesting aspects of the film are Neo's meeting with the Oracle and the fascinating encounter with the Architect, moments which try to explain and progress issues revolving around the Matrix. Unfortunately the film seems determined to entertain rather than interact with the audience, and has big misgivings with its poor character interplay and plot development.The 'Burly-brawl' and the long freeway sequence are captivating at certain times but it gets rather laboured and the continuous use of slow motion becomes rather banal after being repeated one too many times.The Matrix Reloaded is delivered poorly and pompously, although it does have its moments. It is as though the Wachoski's have created Reoloaded without much focus, and were determined to place their time and effort on the action set-pieces and special effects, with large detriment to the dialogue which is inconsistent, muddled and unintentionally amusing at times.",6,0,1,18 August 2009
The Fountain," Wonderously ponderous
","There is something strangely hypnotic and alluring about 'The Fountain'.The sets and photography are crafted to create this otherworldly feel and to take you through a narrative that shifts from the Spanish Inquisition to a Space Odyssey of the future.The script is ponderous and grand in its depiction, which it ultimately fails to reach. However, Rachel Weisz and Hugh Jackman are engaging and do very well with the understated emotions that are necessary in this delicate piece of film making.I appreciate this film for what it is, a look into the delicacy of life, love and death and if you can admire its audacity to venture into such territory and not be unsettled by its meanderings it will be a worthwhile experience, one that will oddly remain with you for sometimes.",6,1,3,17 January 2008
American Gangster," Gangster Classic
","Coolly and professionally created 'American Gangster' is a film of much quality which surpasses the more commercial, and Academy award winning 'The Departed'.'American Gangster' has a taut script that enables the audience to understand the characters that both Denzel Washington and Russell Crowe play. Much like Goodfellas, it is slick and informative and does not flinch at showing the devastating effects of the drug trade.Crowe, Washington and Brolin all perform well but special mention should go to Chiwetel Ejiofor who really absorbs the screen. 'American Gangster' is a near faultless production and for me it will be seen as a classic alongside 'Goodfellas' and 'The Godfather' in time.",8,0,3,1 June 2008
The Wrestler," Wrestling with life
","The Wrestler is a vivid, down to earth and deeply personal tale that is expertly crafted and directed without the need for elaborate or superficial trickery to provide its entertainment. The film provides an inner glance into the world of wrestling without ever being overwrought with its subject matter. It conveys the love and deep affection of the wrestling fraternity and their sheer dedication and willingness to be physically punished for the art. We are provided with the insight into the world of wrestling through Randy 'The Ram' Robinson. Randy a once revered wrestler is seeing out his last remaining days on the wrestling circuit in high school gyms and community centres, signing autographs to die-hard fans who still hold a high respect for the man. He carries physical scars of his wrestling experiences, and reminisces passionately about their inflictions. It is clear that Randy is submerged by his life as a wrestler, his walls are layered with posters and memorabilia of his time in the spotlight. The respect that the wrestling fraternity have for Randy as he turns up for these shows is perceptible, and this provides his motivation to continue his art and to push his aging body to extremes. Into this equation is Cassidy an aging stripper played heartfelt and excellently by Marisa Tomei who Randy has visited, we must surmise on a number of occasions. Cassidy shares the same estrangement from her work, she is no longer the beauty that she once was and like Randy it has come to a chapter in her life where she fears the unknown, the possibility of being alone and away from everything she knows.You will not find a more pitch-perfect performance than that of Mickey Rourke who effortlessly brings Randy to life with his staggering ability to convey his frustrations and motivations through physical and emotional trajectory. You believe in Randy's journey, his abiding attachment to the only thing he knows wrestling, and his efforts to seek a life away from its addictive allure. Darren Aronofsky has produced a film of heartache and real engagement. The film touches the fear we all have of loneliness and resonates passionately without ever seeking a superficial spin much to its credibility, providing a potent and passionate film.",8,1,2,17 January 2010
Hancock," Original 'Superhero' poorly conceived.
","'Hancock' begins as a decidedly refreshing take on the 'superhero'. Hancock played by Will Smith is an alcoholic fueled superhero who is lazy, rude and unsympathetic to the public and places at large. Unfortunately, this largely successful beginning is ruined by the annoying main thread of the story that overshadows the brief moments of substance.Hancock starts well and I immediately felt a sense of originality as we are introduced to the character. I liked the idea that Hancock does not hide his identity, that he does not live in a mansion or have close family ties, and is spoken to like an ordinary individual and lives a care-free existence. However, for all its promising beginnings it really does weave off course towards a very so-so finale.The score is implemented into scenes disastrously and is ear-achingly poor. For most parts of Hancock it feels that the plot and music are just not related. This is in large part, I have decided, due to the shaky and indecisive script.The most captivating moments were when Hancock was describing his predicament, his immortality and powers from a very human perspective. I thought we may get a consider and thoughtful piece of film. However, these moments of insight are brief and the feel of the film moves much more to a Disney like laden plot (annoyingly) and we have a mere scattering of substance. I could never distinguish which kind of film I was watching until the poorly advised 'twist'. The 'twist' which one could see from a distance makes a mockery of the potential ability Hancock had. It is saddening that the streaks of promise, which shine ever so lightly in this film is wasted by a bizarre and preposterous chain of events. If one felt the need to explain Hancock's predicament as a lonely 'superhero' on Earth make it more eloquent or thoughtful, or, even if it would frustrate many don't mention it at all.Hancock struggles to create a tone for the film and comes across as a piecemeal and shaky piece of cinema . At the end it becomes much more of a Disney fanfare than a film of style and substance.",5,0,3,22 September 2009
Hitch," Not bad.
","Hitch is a good film for a night in with the boyfriend/girlfriend or husband/wife but does not really have much allure if you do not fall within this category. Indeed prior to watching Hitch I knew that I was not the kind of individual that this film was aiming to please, so in this respect it may not come as a surprise that after the initial beginning I struggled to keep focused on proceedings.The film does have a certain appeal with Will Smith using his natural charisma as Alex Hitchens to provide helpful advice to his fellow men desperate to get the girl of their dreams. Plus there are some interesting figures and remarks on the world of dating.However, there are only a few funny moments, a few giggles which is a shame because this may have been the key ingredient to maintain viewers whose interest was waning. I must mention Eva Mendes who looks stunning and performs well if not quite up to the efforts of Will Smith.'Hitch' just wasn't for me, it is well made (production design etc) but quite simply I am not the target audience. It was okay to watch, enjoyable at times but it seemed a bit of an effort to get through.",6,0,0,26 March 2009
Inception," Nolan's Dreamwork
","This is Christopher Nolan's masterpiece. Inception is not only the film of the year but truly the most original piece of work in the sci-fi/thriller genre since The Matrix.Inception is visually beautiful both in special effects and set-design. The clean-cut feel does without doubt make Inception that extra illuminating, and the set-pieces are riveting. The effects not only showcase the 'dream-world' but equally are used as a specific narrative device to visually inform the viewer(slow motion) and thus unbound the film from arduous exposition. In addition, Hans Zimmer score sweeps excellently through the film delivering an emotional and thrilling punch to the plot.The effects and score, however, are not the key to Inception's success. The film's sheer original concept of 'dream-extraction' and its ability to balance this with the drive of the plot are seamless. That is the magic of Inception. One never gets to embroiled in the specific dynamics of Inception (although important) as you are expertly enthralled by the story.The characters of Inception are also part of this magic, each and every one of Cobb's team have a specific role and they each have a plausibility and engaging quality. The cast of Inception is superb, and Leonardo Di Caprio is beguiling as ever; Tom Hardy, Cilian Murphy and Joseph Gordon-Levitt are also of particular note.A work of a master craftsmen,Christopher Nolan has delivered a film that is brilliant in both concept and design. Inception is that rarity, an original idea that is beguiling as it is thrilling to watch... What dreams are made of.",10,1,7,28 December 2010
WALL·E," Wow-We
","The first half-hour of Wall-E is a magnificent piece of art, a wonder to behold. Wall-E himself is so well-realised in the opening that you wish you could put your arms round his metal frame and take him home. The Wall-E & Eve relationship is wonderfully rendered one really can feel their emotive core even though they say very little! The middle part of Wall-E does struggle at times to maintain one's attention, and I do feel that Pixar did not seek to match the splendor of animation at the beginning with that later in the film.However, Wall-E should also be applauded for its conjecture and thought throughout concerning planet Earth. Earth is becoming more and more consumerist in its nature, and indeed individually I believe more selfish. Wall-E makes this point very well. The ending to Wall-E is one to cherish and it completes what is a beautiful, pertinent and wonderful film.",9,1,3,28 December 2008
Music and Lyrics," Bring back POP!
","Music & Lyrics is fun and enjoyable entertainment that hits above its weight in the heavily saturated and often mediocre territory of the romantic-comedy.Hugh Grant and Drew Barrymore are notably well casted and this enables the film to flow rather well. The film does linger here and there but it is a well-judged satirical look at the music industry. The music is great fun! 80s at its stereotypical, cheesy best... The intro track 'PoP! Goes My Heart' and 'Way Back Into Love' are surprisingly good and its a shame no original song nomination was forthcoming for either.Music & Lyrics does not pretend to be anything other than another rom-com and yet it surpasses itself in this regard. The film is a happy, feel-good picture and I for one could not stop tapping my feet long after the music had ceased.",7,2,5,2 March 2008
Platoon," Emotionally engaging.
","The craziness and ugliness of war is told with such realism, grit and deeply disturbing moments that Platoon must be appreciated for its emotional engagement. The destruction of war on the human spirit and soul is deeply haunting.Platoon is not an easy watch, and I was left emotionally drained by the experience. This is testament to Oliver Stone and his screenplay, which evokes raw emotion and a tense, alien environment through the cinematography.Dafoe and Berenger are the most celebrated actors in Platoon, and that is how it should be. There characters do have more depth than the others of the platoon but they are both exceptional and draw you into their characters mindset. Although Sheen is very good as Chris Taylor, I did not feel that he was cast correctly. I understand that Taylor is an educated and affluent young-man but I felt he was a little too fresh faced, and rather unfitting for the role. I never succeeded in believing in his reasoning to join the forces.I felt at times that the 'Adagio for Strings' was overplayed, if left to certain moments it would of been more poignant and powerful. The best moment was when Taylor joined Dafoe and his men for a night of relaxation to the music of 'Tracks of my Tears' singing/dancing away, it is so well-done that you are enraptured and share their moment of peace and happiness.Platoon is one of the most poignant war films I have ever seen. Platoon is shocking and hard to watch, but tells one much about the sheer ugliness of the human soul when confronted with such pitiful and dire circumstances.",7,1,3,24 February 2009
Despicable Me," A Despicable Delight
","Despicable Me is a fun film. It is a simple story coated with wonderful moments, and characters that are pleasing to watch. From Gru with his aim to become the most evil villain in the world to his eccentric but utterly lovable Minions (a great creation).Giggles, and there are lots of them work through a certain subtlety. The moving of a characters face, voice or body (special mention to the Minions)or the sweet scene stealing 'Unicorns I love them' Agnes really does work. When Despicable Me does try with a more slapstick, or crash, bang wallop it does full a little flat. Arch-nemesis Vector and Gru's assistant Dr. Nefarious are at times in Despicable Me a little weak. Indeed it is Gru but more so the orphan girls and Minions that we want to see. I must mention the animation which is very good and well-brought to life but also the musical presence in the film, as I really noticed it. The music is rather modern and funky for an animation, and gave for me a contemporary twist, which I enjoyed. I admire Despicable Me for its simple yet highly creativity tale. There are many scenes that are highly memorable and you would have to have a heart of steel not to be touched by the manner it draws the film to its loving and charming conclusion.",8,1,1,25 February 2011
The Dark Knight Rises," A Shining Example.
","The Dark Knight Rises is a blockbuster - it is thrilling and enthralling and a riveting spectacle. It towers above the saturated and ubiquitous market of the comic-hero genre, and provides its finest example of excellence and entertainment.Firstly, and I will get this out of the way. I am aware that there is a large fault with Dark Knight Rises, which were apparent in the The Dark Knight, the narrative framework. Plot holes, inconsistencies and plot devices are prevalent enough that I suspect one could produce another two hour forty-five minute film to fill in the gaps. However Dark Knight Rises is such a gripping and atmospheric experience that I will let it go.The villain of DKR is Bane, a behemoth of a man kept alive by his facial mask to appease chronic pain. Although indecipherable at times Bane's voice has a lingering fear factor. Tom Hardy's frame provides the physical bulk that dominates and blots out the exterior and exudes menace and awe throughout.The star and revelation of DKR is Anne Hathaway, she moulds into Selina (Catwoman) effortlessly and one does not question her physical capabilities. Selina's moral ambiguity is also refreshing and a nicely rounded figure in a film pulsating to the climax.Nolan, has once again provided a film that has been flawlessly developed and produced. The script is intelligent enough to surprise, and twist, and make The Dark Knight Rises a thrill to watch. Although it suffers decidedly as TDK with an inadequate audit of the narrative - it is popcorn entertainment at its very best - Just enjoy!",9,1,3,21 July 2012
Iron Man," Run-of-the-mill adventure
","There is nothing wrong with The Iron Man, the only problem is there is nothing in it which makes it better or memorable than any other comic come film venture in recent years.The Iron Man has the same formulaic structure of that of other comic adaptations, which one cannot criticize, as it is what such fans expect. However, it does not grip-you, instead it is rather run-of-the-mill fare, with some nice comedic asides and some good special effects.Robert Downey Jnr is obviously the pivotal actor in this film and makes a likable hero in the form of Tony Stark. Indeed, Tony Stark is a a cheeky and affable character but he has no personal intrigue or circumspect attribute which one can associate with Peter Parker or Bruce Wayne. For this very reason it feels like The Iron Man is going through the motions of bringing the story to life rather than trying to capture the audience. The Iron-Man is a pleasant, friendly and harmless picture but this combination does not make engrossing cinema. If you are looking for a film without having to do much work then Iron Man is the right film for you, otherwise I feel you will be disappointed.",5,1,4,2 January 2009
Elizabeth: The Golden Age," Passion on Canvas
","Any picture trying to portray the life and times of a past historical figure are always susceptible to historical flaws and inaccuracies. Elizabeth: The Golden Age is a film which I cannot judge on its historical accuracies but it is a film made with passion.Cate Blanchett is great as Elizabeth in a time of ill-will for England, and Clive Owen a very charming Sir Walter Raleigh who has returned from the New World. The cast to be fair all perform splendidly and it cannot be criticized in this regard. Indeed, the sets, cinematography, special effects, costume designs are so lavishly displayed you forget that the film is set in the late 1500s, but this is to be adored rather than criticised.Unfortunately, King Philip II of Spain and Mary Stuart are one-dimensional characters and this is a real setback for me. King Philip only seemed to communicate with profanities and religious rhetoric - an archetypal villain with not a fluttering or due effort to humanise.Elizabeth: The Golden Age has much passion and this can be seen clearly in its delivery and execution. I enjoyed its colorful resonance and excellent acting and is satisfactory vieiwing.",7,1,1,5 October 2008
Cube," Not rounded
","The Cube is original and credit can be given for its clever resolving of how to escape the predicament of the Cube. However, for all its anxious interplay it just feels rather frugal both in script and appearance.The film is able to project the feel of claustrophobia and delusion rather well in its short period of running time, we are never able to escape the constant of the Cube and its horrifying predicament. The Cube and its purpose are never satisfactorily resolved leaving you to determine the where and whys, which may frustrate some.Unfortunately, the acting seems to be a contest of wills, each and every actor trying to out do one another with emotion. At points in the film you are at the opposite end to their projected emotional outpourings. The script is rather threadbare on providing a succinct or logical discussion of their predicament preferring stereotypical interplay and physical violence and language. More time should have been given to other areas of discussion if it was to propel itself to a sci-fi with more bite but maybe that was not its purpose.The Cube is an okay film but for all its hard-work it is rather frugal looking. The Cube tries valiantly to be a film with depth but its lack of purposeful debate, stereotypical characters and at times woeful acting make it a film which never fulfilled its possible potential.",5,2,5,24 January 2010
The Cabin in the Woods," Inventive but missing something.
","The Cabin in the Woods... If I was looking for a weekend away this would not be on my list of places to go! However it befits the films nature, poking fun at the horror flick, and with some success.Although the parody was successfully encaptured by the Scream franchise The Cabin in the Woods manages to spruce up the formula with an original twist and a modicum of present day insight.The Cabin in the Woods, we soon learn, is a 'Truman Show' set watched by the masses and for what specific purpose - it is not first revealed. Goddard and Whedon have melded a horror story around the populous reality TV format and to a satirical degree probes at our human passivity to violence/death in the twenty-first century.There are some nice moments in The Cabin in the Woods, and although it works to a degree it seems rather benign. It would be unfair to say that it lacked horror because it seeks a more comical stride, but it lacks that vital punch. Kudos where it is due The Cabin in the Woods is inventive enough to not feel like a Scream-replica but its original setup does not have the matching narrative.",7,0,3,12 October 2012
Moon," A Foreseeable Future
","Moon is a fine film with a story which is plausible and well produced. Sam, played excellently by Sam Rockwell, is approaching the end of his three year contract on the Moon, where he has been extracting Helium-3 to resource Earth with energy. GERTY, a computer system, who will inevitably be compared to HAL is Sam's lone companion on the Moon, whose purpose is to ensure the safe and continual extraction of Helium-3. I like the idea of Moon, that the Earth depends on a single man and a lone computer to provide energy. It has a somewhat comforting feel and we are not distracted by environmental concerns or other characters. The special effects and score are both able to conjure an unsettling feel. Moon thrives through its fine production and focus, and is an intelligent and a very good sci-fi film with real heart.",8,2,4,26 December 2009
Contact," Flawed by conformity
","Opening with a fantastic journey into the infinite universe the film is set-up perfectly, it makes us ponder about our uniqueness, how special we are... Unfortunately, the snare in which it entraps us is so uncertainly handled through the film it lets us go rather easily.Contact is severely hampered by its own inhibitions. There is a lack of belief in its own purpose. In order to keep 'bums in seats' it reverts to Hollywood mode and this ensures a messy and deeply flawed blueprint for the film.Contact tries to discuss themes with sincerity, but each and every time it self-consciously departs as though not to offend the majority. William Fichtner's role as a blind scientist who due to his disability has very acute sense of hearing was an unnecessary, but a good example of Contact's woeful attempt to entertain the masses, as though this would make it a uniquely viable tale.This could of been good, great even but collectively it does not form together all-that well. The film appears almost forced to conform to the stereotypical sci-fi and I am honestly very disappointed.",5,7,15,29 January 2008
The Pursuit of Happyness," Happiness has been found.
","Based on the real story of the trials and tribulations of Chris Gardner, the Pursuit of Happiness is an expertly produced piece of film. The narrative may spin a few changes to the truths but it is mixed so cleverly that it glides on a lightness of tone, while touching emotive issues.One cannot fail but find Will Smith's character, Chris Gardner a highly likable and affable individual. Arguably, one may suggest Gardner is too optimistic and endearing in circumstances that are too glum to beseech such a nature. However, these are moments, skillfully and subtly executed to convey Gardner's inner turmoil and make him a believable human-being.Jaden Smith, son of Will Smith - is the real star. I was critical of Jaden Smith being cast for this role due to this relationship... But has he proved me wrong! Jaden Smith is perfect as the young boy, he is able to bring joy, sorrow and frustration to the son who must follow the plight of his down-on-his luck father.The Pursuit of Happiness delivers a heart-warming, uplifting and charming tale. Although some may decide that it veers from the more serious dilemmas, an example being the departure of Linda, Chris Gardner's wife/girlfriend, who is incognito in the second-half of the film, it does not limit or hamper the consistency of its message and should be gracefully received as it has been made.",7,0,0,1 March 2008
Valkyrie," The tenseness of Valkyrie is brought to the screen
","Under the direction of Bryan Singer Valkyrie is a well-made and nail-biting affair.Starring an altogether British cast including Kenneth Brannagh and Tom Wilkinson the film is able to provide a fluent, and as far as I am aware rather accurate depiction of events in the attempted assassination of Hitler.Tom Cruise produces a workmanlike performance as General Von Staffenburg and although we see his drive and determination to succeed we never get a rounded character. The only real disappointment with Valkyrie is the rather easy-nature that Staffenburg is able to recruit new conspirators without much ado, and whilst Valkyrie makes a concerted effort to balance action with discourse it felt as though it lacked a certain weightiness.Valkyrie is a good film and is executed in a suspenseful fashion, which must be applauded as we know the outcome prior to the opening of the film. The running time is well managed and will drive you to seek further information on the plot and people involved.",7,0,0,10 August 2009
Atonement," An adaptation at its finest.
","Beautifully told with a perfect cast 'Atonement' manages to sustain its emotional core. It stumbles slightly when it shifts from its engrossing and striking first act to its ponderous second act but its heart beats unabated.Saoirse Ronan is mesmerising as Briony Tallis and is the driving force in the first act, much as James McAvoy in the second.The score is cleverly construed with the 'clunk' of keys a lingering frustration at first, but as the picture progresses it is a smooth and perfectly constructed piece of music.'Atonement' has is moments of conscious exuberance in particular the beach scene. One of the most well executed pieces of cinematography, which I consider to be one of the best takes I have ever seen. It does not progress or have much impact on the story, it is essentially a piece of art - but it is nonetheless gripping.A strong piece of cinema 'Atonement' is lavish but controlled and prolongs thoughts and feelings that only a well-managed and intelligent piece of film making could achieve.",8,0,1,16 March 2008
