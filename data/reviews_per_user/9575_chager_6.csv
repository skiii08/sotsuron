Insidious: Chapter 2," Improvement over 'Chapter 1'....not even close.
","Let me start out by saying that I love horror movies. Good ones. But in my opinion that's an unfortunate thing because no other movie genre is as plagued by poor quality garbage as the horror genre. The first Insidious movie was not great, but I definitely felt it was above average and deserving of the near-7 rating is has in IMDb. Very few horror films merit a rating of 7 or higher, and that is particularly true in the case of Chapter 2. Apart from some interesting ties they made between events in this film and events in the first film which made this one interesting at times, it was worse than the first one, not better. The acting by some of the characters was B-quality at best. The dialog was cheesy at times. The plot was mostly unoriginal and boring. As for evil spirits and imagery, there was nothing new introduced at all. No red- faced demon. Just the ghost of a serial killer who became one because his mother made him dress like a girl...gee, we've seen that before about a dozen times. Lazy, lazy storytelling. The rating at the time of this writing is a 7.3. I'd give it a 4 and I expect that it will trend down over time and end up at least a full point below Chapter 1, which as a 6.7 at this time.",4,11,19,16 September 2013
The Ring," SPOILERS - Plot flaw? Don't read unless you have seen it.
","I liked this movie and look forward to seeing the original Japanese version (DVD trilogy for sale on eBay right now cheap...all region encoding) but I have uncovered what I think is a MAJOR plot flaw. Here comes the SPOILER....The horses all comitted suicide. I assumed it was because Samara didn't like them because they were supposedly keeping her awake in the barn, perhaps. Remember the oft-repeated line, 'She doesn't like it in the barn..the horses keep her awake.'Well, HELLO...another oft-repeated (and even illustrated) trait of hers was that SHE NEVER SLEPT. They said this about a dozen times and even showed her staying awake for days on the time-lapsed footage from the camera in her room in the psych hospital.I would love to be wrong about this but I don't think that I am. Wonder if the much-lauded original contains this same error....Some very fine moments in this movie that will scare the most jaded of us, but overall I would have to say it definitely does NOT live up to the hype that it is the next 'Sixth Sense'. There's really no comparison. See it, but keep your expectations on the low side so that you can enjoy the experience.",Null,0,0,27 October 2002
Silent Hill," Starts out strong...
","...ends with the same tired old BS - and worse. The climactic scene utilizes props that look like something from a bad off-Broadway stage production and actually made me giggle - the hovering hospital bed with the dangling i.v. drips and the pasty thirty-something year old supernatural burn victim. But the story is interesting and starts out very strong with some really great visuals and suspense. The first time 'the darkness' comes, ushered by an alarm that sounds like your average small town tornado alert horn, it was pretty intense. I give it a 6 to 6.5 out of 10. Without the really great beginning and the decent story it would be a 4.5 to 5. I was expecting more, but I've said that after almost every horror movie I've ever seen, so there you go.",6,1,5,21 April 2006
The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring," Awesome - prompted me to read all three books!
","I have put off reading the Lord of the Rings trilogy for many years now, but no longer. This movie, which I understand may have strayed a bit from the novels, was so intense and wonderful, as movies go, that I am going to read the entire trilogy before the second movie comes out. I loved it very much, as did my wife. Stunning visuals and great acting make this a must see, whether you are a Tolkein fan or not!",10,0,0,27 December 2001
American Psycho," Great, sparked an interest in books by the author...
","I really enjoyed the movie, it was very witty. I get that there was a lot of mistaken identity taking place and that everyone was too shallow to really listen to anyone else, but the one thing I don't understand is the apartment scene. Can someone explain that? When he goes into that other guy's apartment and it's for sale and totally scrubbed clean? I didn't get this dialog between Bateman and the real estate lady or why there weren't cops and police tape all over the crime scene...What am I missing there? As far as his lawyer calling him Davis and saying that he had seen the dead man recently in London, that was funny and when the whole thing clicked for me, but I am still wondering what the heck was up with that apartment scene. I know there are comic and surrealism elements of the story, but they mostly made sense in within the context of the plot.",7,0,1,19 November 2006
The Exorcist," Less than a ten is a flat LIE.
","This movie absolutely set the standard for movies attempting to frighten people. There is no close second to this one at all. No rival. To this day, this 20 year old flick stands up to any level of scrutiny. As the standard bearer for scary-ass horror movies it deserves no less than a 10, period. Anyone giving it less than a ten is either a liar or not a fan of the horror genre (nor a competent critic of the genre.) No other movie has ever come close to being as frightening or as innovatively gripping cinematically. I do hope very much that something does topple it someday..we can't possibly have run out of scary ideas, although that's the way it seems. Blair Witch? Yawn.",10,0,2,25 October 2002
