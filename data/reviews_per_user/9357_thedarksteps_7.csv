The Avengers," I usually hate superhero movies
","I was highly dubious going into the theater for this movie, almost walked out before it started. I work at a movie theater and therefore didn't spend any money on it, so leaving before it started would not have had any negative effect on my bank account. The only reason I stayed, I was already there and I don't go in to work for another 14 hours.As stated in the subject, not a superhero movie fan, not even a comic book fan, not since my 20's. That being said, I knew very little about the characters and thus had no preconceived notions about how they should be represented... except for Hulk. While I didn't like the Edward Norton version or the post 9/11 watered down violent first movie, I did actually like how he actually looks like the actor portraying him. The other two movies, Hulk was almost a separate entity, completely losing facial notoriety of his weaker self. Plus, he actually has human facial expressions instead of just gritted teeth and growling.As I said before, not a comic book fan, went in knowing very little if anything at all of Black Widow or Hawkeye. Honestly, I thought Hawkeye was a DC character, but I guess I was wrong. Never really liked Cappy or Thor and didn't like Iron Man until RD,J. started playing him. So basically, I went in with little knowledge of the modern characters and only really was looking forward to one out of six.Without giving anything away, this movie was the best thing I've seen in years. I've always been more of a Transformers fan and I thought those movies were epic, visually as well as story and acting power. I never dreamed I would rank the Avengers above my beloved Transformers, but here I am doing just that. Some people state the movie was too long, agree to disagree. Movies like this should always be a minimum of 2 hours, this movie could stand to have been a tad longer. Which I'm sure it will be when it comes to bluray. I'm sure some of the hardcore comic book or superhero nerds will find exception to this review and the movie itself, someone is always disappointed. I'm just glad I was not one of them... although if I had been, I got in for free and had little ventured but 2 hours and 15 minutes I would never get back.In about 9 hours I'm going to wake up and take my kids to see it, looking forward to the 2 hours and 15 minutes running time, because once the movie gets going, it just about takes a brick wall or the Hulk's six-pack to stop it. If you're a hardcore superhero nerd you will see it, if you are not a hardcore superhero fan and like fun unrealistic action movies, this one is for you.Hope there's a sequel.",10,2,6,4 May 2012
World War Z," Story driven not gore driven
","Think Contagion mixed with a dash of George Romero's original Night of the Living Dead. This movie is about the virus that is taking out the world instead of the zombies that result from the virus. It's about finding the source or at the very least a means to find the ever elusive, patient zero. If you're looking for gore and zombies that are missing half their heads but still moving like an Olympic runner, this will not be your movie.There is little to no gore as gore is not necessary to move the plot along, nor to spice up otherwise lackluster plots or sub-par actors. This movie is not about edge of your seat blockbuster action and gratuitous explosions, it's about Brad Pitt and his adventure in trying to save the world. The story is simple, pretty much the same as most, Extinction Level Event brought on by a viral outbreak; not of man but of nature. The progression of the story does however meet with your usual action movie problems where main characters can escape pitfalls that background characters nor real people would be able to. There are also the usual moments where there are your usual build ups to the very last second of safety, like someone holding a door open until the very last second and then shutting that door with a horde of zombies with the force of a locomotive being held back by doors that wouldn't be able to hold if there were not main actors on the safe side of it.Despite the pitfalls within the story and the action movie formula, it does lend a sort of judgement day feel to, but because more time is spent carrying the plot forward, there isn't enough time to spend in certain locales to give the sense of extinction. Similar to Contagion, it's implied more than dwelled upon. Unlike Contagion, there's no real sense of loss and without that it's hard to care when certain characters die or become endangered. Brad Pitt's character, not having a background in medicine or virology is able to come to a viable conclusion on how to combat the infection a little too quickly given that some of the world's best medical minds have been hitting brick walls in 10x the time it takes him.This is not The Walking Dead, or Resident Evil, or any of the _______ of the Dead movies. If you're expecting anything like this, you will be disappointed. If however you go in with the Contagion drama mentality where there is in fact a plot beyond ready, aim, fire, reload, you may enjoy this film. The premise of the virus does have its merits based in reality to a small degree, more so than a T-Virus or the dead rising from the grave because of some apocalyptic biblical prophecy. This movie is rated PG-13, think about that as well. By no means is a family movie, especially for children who have a history of blowing things out of proportion or some level of pessimistically imaginative anxiety, I was one about 30 years ago and my parents regretted it every time.Overall, this movie should entertain, unless you're looking for a mouthful of human flesh in the mouths of the zombies and blood spewing or spraying out of open wounds. If read the book, then you may want to wait for it to come out on Blu-ray or DVD. But if you want something to make you think for about 20 minutes and wonder how Pitt is going to save the world and more importantly his family, then give it a shot.In reference to the 3D version, it was converted to 3D not actually shot in 3D, so there tend to be errors here and there that your brain will not be able to decipher and thus will detract from the experience. See 2D if this kind of thing bothers you, as it did me. Also, this movie is not worth the price of concession stand refreshments, do your eating and drinking before you get to the theater at more economic prices or sneak something in. Save that money and buy a ticket to another movie after this one.",8,9,21,21 June 2013
Ted," Truly an American Classic for all you Seth McFarlane loving bastids
","It kind of reminds me of an Adam Sandler movie, except funny. This is the most I've laughed at a movie in years. Sure Hall Pass was pretty good as was Horrible Bosses and even The Hangover 2, but this was all of those rolled into one movie. I just wish McFarlane would make a Family Guy or American Dad movie and definitely make it at the very least, rated R.And ladies, Ryan Reynolds and Taylor Lautner are in this movie, how bad could it possibly be? I'm gonna see it again tomorrow night and if I can find a babysitter, lie to my wife by telling her that the new Medea movie is sold out, we'll have to see Ted instead.Do not miss this movie you bastids.",10,1,12,29 June 2012
Man of Steel," o.O
","Great special fx...Nice to know that the people in charge of the effects knew what they were doing, too bad no one else did theirs. I thought maybe if I saw the movie, it would answer many of the questions that pop into my head whenever I see or think about superheroes. I figured for the amount of money spent everything would be good, but it wasn't. Superman's integrity is put into question by his actions or at times inactions relating to the protection of the human race. Maybe he's more like Zod than he wants to believe as he precariously and remorselessly aids Zod in laying waste to Metropolis. It's nothing more than a grudge match, similar to the one in Superman 2 almost 33 years ago but with more death and destruction. If you want to know what it might have been like at ground zero when the World Trade Center collapsed, Snyder is more than happy to accommodate you, but it was just a terrorist that did it. The terrorist had help from the good guy this time around. Clearly Superman was just as concerned with his box office sales as Snyder was. 'If I fight Zod a place that nothing will get destroyed and no one will be harmed, will people really pay to see me? Probably not, sacrifices must be made.'Beyond that, nothing to see here, it's just your above average Bruce Willis action hero movie, but with better a director and a much bigger budget, steered into theaters by one of the world's best known monikers. Honestly, I really don't know why we write reviews of movies, plays, music, or art. We all have to experience it for ourselves before we can count or discount anything.Love it or hate it, it is what it is.The 5 star rating is for the special fx, the rest of the movie gets a zero.",5,4,9,17 June 2013
Evil Dead," Garbage; no offense to the stuff that fills trash cans
","It's interesting how the budget for the original was around 3 hundred- thousand dollars and this movie's budget was around 14 million dollars and the original was exponentially better simply because the had to try back then. I think if the budget for this one had been barely a million dollars it would have delivered but instead it just delivered another rehash of the same movie that has been released every few months for the past several years; stupid characters you care nothing about getting involved in something that will lead to their demise in the most unrealistic manner the director can come up with.This is the work of a lazy director who seems to follow a similar formula as most actions movies. The body count matters not the storyline. There's no point in telling people not to see it, they will anyway. Some will like it, some will love it, and others would like to kill Sam Raimi for producing it because he just allowed some nobody director to urinate all over it.Waste your money on another bad movie that has come out recently, so many to choose from that are more than halfway worth the small fortune you'll be dishing out. This movie could be called many things, Evil Dead is not one of them. Cabin in the Woods 2, The Last Exorcism 2 1/2, Possession 2... and so many other letdowns. This one is almost as bad as Halloween 3 back in the 80's, it had nothing at all to do with the other 2 movies, someone just used the name to make more money than they would have had they name it Random Unscary Movie I.If you love this movie, you cannot call yourself an Evil Dead fan, you don't know what it means to be Dead.",1,164,340,6 April 2013
Prometheus," Did any of you actually watch the movie?
","I just watched a midnight showing of this movie and I thought it was great. However, I've been reading numerous reviews where people are completely getting lost on the content and context of the movie.Some of you keep asking some of the same questions which were all addressed had you actually been paying attention. One that keeps appearing throughout many reviews is: How is it that the planet is so big and the place they choose to land has the 'temple'? First off, they called it a pyramid not a temple. Second, David said that the planet was a military installation and that the pyramid was basically a hangar. Most military installations have multiple hangars, also David said there were other ships. You people were either sleeping or went into the movie with a preconceived notion that this was going to be an action movie like the last 3 alien movies.Another question that seems to be recurring is: If the Jockeys wanted to kill us, why would she go to their home world to talk to them? If you listen to the inflection in her voice, talking is not what she has in mind. She means to expose them to the organism they created to wipe out not only humankind, but presumably any of their other creations on several other worlds that are referenced on the star map that David is standing in the middle of.How can David work their technology so easily? David has studied many other languages of Earth, as a synthetic he has the processing capabilities of a computer of the era, and using linguistic skills as well as knowledge of human language, deduces that if they created us then they also created our language(s). Which would mean there would be some degree of understanding if he were to successfully make a few educated guesses. Seriously, do you people even know how science works? Why was Weyland implying that he is dead but in fact is on board without the crew's knowledge and why? Weyland was hoping that Shaw's theory of the 'Engineers' was accurate and they did in fact exist. If that were the case, he hoped that because they were so advanced that they must also be civilized and would possibly prolong his life and reverse the effects of aging. Weyland was also in contact with David even while being in cryo-stasis, constantly being updated by David and adding new directives to David's ultimate purpose on the mission. Which is a repetitive story device in all the alien movies; secure the organism within one of the crew members and freeze it for the trip home.How did David know she was pregnant with an alien fetus? Because it was his intent to have her impregnated by exposing her boyfriend to the organism. It would work through his system, get into his 'change purse' and when he made a deposit in her 'vault' she would then carry the organism.This movie was really good, if you happened to be paying attention and didn't go in wanting to see a heart pounding, cliché action movie. You either need to see it again or read the book adaptation, because most of you are posing questions about the movie that would be obvious to a high school student.",9,5,11,8 June 2012
Godzilla," Too much trite storyline, not enough stomping
","While I like the new design and the fantastic CG, this Godzilla movie is kind of like the Lorax... the name of the movie has little content of the main character; The Lorax was only in 'The Lorax' for about 8 minutes of the movie, unfortunately that's about all the screen time Big G gets, the rest is uninteresting unpolished plot that makes you wish they would just 'get on with it' as Monty Python said. Godzilla movies are kind of like porn, nobody watches it for the storyline they watch it for the action, so talk less and pound more.Also, critics and many reviewers are laying into this movie saying the storyline was bad or that the acting was sub par... it's Godzilla, do you expect Meryl Streep to make a 3 minute cameo and rack up yet another Oscar ? This is a popcorn movie, it's meant to sell tickets and to show the Japanese how to make a movie that doesn't involve someone wearing a $2M suit for some weird on screen cos-play action. You dump a $160M in and hope you make twice that back, who cares if every Big G fan walks out feeling like a comic con fan who doesn't get the autograph he stood in line for.If there is a sequel to this movie, make it more like Pacific Rim with tons of action and very little story or dialog. I mean really, how much story do you need? 50 story lizard has a beef with mankind and his only means of dealing with his aggression is to stomp the **** out of everything that the minuscule little primates built. 120 minutes of Godzilla goodness, 3 minutes of dialog. Someone go make that movie, I'll wait.",7,16,28,16 May 2014
