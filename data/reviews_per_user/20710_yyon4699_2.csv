Changeling," It felt like I was in the film. Excellent acting!
","I don't really know how to start but GOSH!!!! Touching, scary, mysterious... I already guessed that the movie would be great before watching it but I was still blew off. Angelina Jolie was perfect in the movie. Her skinny figure made upgraded the whole thing ! I was physically shivering in fear when watching the movie because it was SO unbelievably scary when you try to relate it to the year when this thing actually happened as it is a true story. Honestly, I thought Angelina should have won the best actress award. I didn't really do any research on the real case so the movie kept me guessing the whole time and I cried so much after seeing the ending. If you are a person who can't bear any heart breaking scene, read the real case before watching if so you get a little heads up before spoiling your good night's sleep (I could not sleep after watching it. Lol...)",10,8,12,13 March 2009
Knowing," Ignore other bad comments. Knowing is breathtaking!!!
","if I can rate this movie with any number I want, I would an infinite space for it. It is unfair that people rate this movie 1 or 2 stars just because of the ending. I mean, the ending is not great but I am pretty sure that if they had a different ending to it say a 'la la land' ending, happily ever after, people would complain about it too 'cause it won't 'make sense' anymore and it is not the actual point of the movie anymore. I am not a big Nic Cage fan but he was fantastic in the movie. not just Knowing but all other movies. Alex Proyas, A big round applause for you. I'll give you the Nobel Prize if I could. PLease watch this movie without the comments form others. whoever missed the movie just because others said that it was bad, please reconsider.",10,10,19,20 June 2009
