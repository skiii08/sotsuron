The Perks of Being a Wallflower," i don't like drama and i loved it
","Hit too close to home so I can't watch it again but great job on all accounts... the harry potter girl is as beautiful and intelligent as ever. The movie over all is hopeful yet sad. Aspects of each character I know in others as well as myself, gives a real feel for all of them. Honestly I hate dramas most of the time but the fair few that make it through can be amazing. There is little I can say without giving stuff away and to much relates to my life. Shows a bit about a current generation dealing with problems that have been around along time. Give it a watch if you don't mind a little cry with a small smile. I know a 10 is a bit much but it's rare to find a newer high rated movie that doesn't get it just for looks, the story is what touches and engages you.",10,0,1,10 February 2014
