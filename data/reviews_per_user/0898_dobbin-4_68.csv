The Blair Witch Project," Scariest film of all time and that is not being by-est.
","Now, I have seen a lot of horror movies in my life but when I think of what the scariest film is, I think of The Blair Witch Project and its ending. The movie is about three college students who go in the woods to film a documentary about the famed Blair witch who find out there is something wrong with that wood and they find out a little late for a persons liking. The film builds up to the conclusion extremely well and is the first movie that I have ever been so freaked out that I wanted to close my eyes in ( did not though as wanted to see end). Everone who enjoys watching horror movies will watch this movie and be proud that finally a movie can use its low budgetness to its advantage and still be generally scary. Overall the movie is scary and fans of horror movies will have fun being scared out of there shorts. I rate this generally scary movie 63%.",6,1,2,17 December 2007
The Mask," Not Jim Carrey's best but a pretty good movie all up.
","Now, I know this movie is known as the movie Jim Carrey restricts himself unless of course he is wearing the mask. The movie is about Stanley Ipkiss a hopeless man bored with being an unlucky dork, he finds a masks that makes him an extra hypo coll guy. The movie is definitely not Carrey's best but is a must watch for fans of his other films. Now this movie is one of those unfortunate movies that has triggered a series and a sequel which I did not find that bad but now has its own place in the worst 100 movies. Overall watch this movie if you want to laugh but I would choose Ace Ventura over it any day. I rate this movie 78%.",8,0,0,13 December 2007
Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," Come on, it is not bad
","In 1983, the final chapter of Star Wars was released, and it was a great end to a fantastic trilogy. After 16 years of waiting through ripoffs, spoofs and knockoffs (Mostly like Ripoffs but I had to have three things to relate to) and to many it disappointed.What the film suffered from is the HUGE expectations from fans alike, who had been on the edge of their seat begging for this movie to come out, and the fact that it was not as good as the original 3 really hurt them inside.The film was also hurt by upgrades in Special Effects, like the overlong Space Race and the Political Debate taking up 20 minutes of its 130 minute run time. Now, let me talk about the most hated thing about this movie, Jar Jar Binks. He was a comic relief character, one not seen in Star Wars before, he was annoying, kind of like Kathy Griffin, and he really annoyed some of the most loyal fans. I personally, did not like him but he was bearable, although overdone, it would have been better if only in for half of the movie and then gradually left out, instead of a gag every 5 minutes where he trips over. The there would be a lot less anger towards it.Overall, the film is not too bad, suffers from modern Special Effects, Expectations and Jar Jar Binks but it was bearable. I rate it 68%.",7,0,2,7 June 2008
50 First Dates," My 100th review: 50 first dates.
",Adam Sandler film also starring Drew Barrymore and Rob Schneider. The film is about a guy who thinks he has found the right women ( played by Drew Barrymore) but then finds out she forgets everything after one day. So he sets out to win her heart every single day. The movie is extremely funny and does not re lie on the fact she only remembers stuff for a day for all its good humour. The movie is a must watch for fans of Adam Sandler and even for people who do not like him will probably enjoy this fine made piece of comedy. Overall I think this film is a must watch for fans of good comedy as it has every cast member at their extreme best ( cameos standard lower down excluding Rob Schneider) and the humour KICKS ARSE. I rate this film 73%.,7,0,1,18 December 2007
The Hangover," Hilarious film! One of the best comedies of 2009 (So far)
","This has n't really been a good year for comedies this year and when I saw this trailer I did n't really expect much. But, always open to seeing a comedy movie, I went to the drive and really enjoyed myself. It was really funny all the way along and even when it stopped to set up a scene it was still really interesting to watch and I never got bored throughout the movie. I think most people are used to films like this right now, with the shock value level set high and trying to make as many people annoyed as possible, but I like to think this film has a lot more going for it, with much better humour and if not that, much funnier character's.The film also uses its concept better then all the other comedies that have been released this year, and the plot line does n't disappoint and the disaster theme, while used in thousands of other Hollywood films before this is again done really well and keeps this film interesting and lively.Overall, this was a much funnier movie then I thought it was and is another movie that has really surprised me by doing the opposite of what I thought it would be like (Forgetting Sarah Marshall) and I was very glad I decided to this. I give this movie 83%. I would recommend this for lovers of Apatrow styled movies (Knocked Up, Superbad, Zack And Miri Make A Porno).",8,2,4,5 July 2009
The Ring," The Ring
","I was told by a friend that this film was one of the scariest movies he had seen in a long while, and, I decided to watch it. And I loved it, it was exiting, scary and it was just all round a good film to watch.In this film, a local news reporter goes searching for an unmarked video tape that apparently kills anyone that watches it after her niece unexpectedly dies, exactly 1 week after she had watched the video. She finds the video, and watches it, and it becomes a race against time to find the mysterious secret, behind the ring.The film does have some issues, and the plot seems overworked sometimes but the acting is overall quite good, with the sons acting being something all young actors should strive for, also Naomi Watts is good as the reporter.Overall, the film is quite good, Scary, thrilling, surprising. I rate this film 73%.",7,1,1,18 June 2008
Raiders of the Lost Ark," Great!!!
","Indiana Jones and the Raiders of the Lost Ark is the first of 4 Indiana Jones movies all of which starring one of the best action movie actors Harrison Ford.The movie starts off fast and stays that speed, always entertaining for the viewer and making for a superb and exiting experience. The movie is a superb mix of Humour and Action and is very interesting instead of getting boring like most Action/Comedys that have come out. The movie is totally worth getting no matter what the price (I luckily bought it for $1.00 at a school fÃªte in 2006 but I would have happily bought it for up to $20.00.Overall, a lover of movies, Harrison Ford and Action will love this movie as I did. I rate the film 82% and the others are great too.",8,0,0,23 May 2008
Kung Fu Panda," My 150th Review: Kung Fu Panda: Good family film
","I like that in this film that they don't make all their jokes to simple to all the kids like in a lot of kid movies and they actually respect that kids do have an IQ over 15 and do know some things so you don's have to over simplify everything for their so called tiny brains.In the film, Po (Jack Black) is a noodle chef who dreams of being a Kung Fu Master gets declared the saviour of China and meets the master (Dustin Hoffman) and the skilled 5 (Angelina Jolie, Lucy Liu, David Cross, Seth Rogan and Jackie Chan) who are all trying to get rid of him. But when an evil force escapes from prison, he must fight and save china.The film is good and well acted and written. The film is a welcome relief to some of the other family crap coming out this year and last, I know I am not the only one but I am a definite fan of this film.Overall, the film is good and worth a watch to all family members out there. There are jokes for the young and old and the film definitely gets a high rating from me. I rate this film 74%.",7,1,3,13 July 2008
Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Man's Chest," Pirates of the Caribbean 2: Dead Mans Chest
","Pirates of the Caribbean 2 may be my least of the 3 they have made so far but only because the other too are sweet. The movie is about Captain Jack Sparrow a while later and he is in trouble again this time is that he owes 100 souls to Davy Jones. The movie is really funny, has great action and does not ruin the first one which already makes a sequel 30% in my mind. The only reason I do not think this is as good as the others is because there is something missing and I not sure what. Overall I rate this high for cleverness,Funniness and action but I do not rate it as high as the others for some reason but I still rate it a pretty solid and fair 74% so go watch this film you will not be that disappointed and it is good for a laugh or two but the other too are better.",7,0,2,8 July 2007
Rocky V," Some comments are extremely not true. The film is way better then the 4th one.
","I have heard many times from people that this is the worst in the Rocky series and does not even compare to the brilliance of the first 4. While this is not a great film it is the best since Rocky 2.In this film, a crooked accountant makes the Balboas lose all their money and have to move back to the bum house in which they occupied in the first few films. The son does not take it well and Rocky's obsession with a younger upcoming boxer is not helping his mood. The younger boxer then leaves, only to be shunned and told to get Rocky to agree to a match. The film is great. It gets a great message across and is emotional and clever at delivering the desire of finishing the Rocky series off with a bang (It was originally the last movie before 'Rocky Balboa' came out in 2006).Overall, a fan of Rocky who likes this less then Rocky 4 has obviously not gotten the film and if up to me there would be no Rocky 4 and they just forget about that one all together. I rate this film 64%.Which leaves my Rocky weekend like this: Rocky: 82%Rocky II: 72%Rocky III: 62%Rocky IV: 53%Rocky V: 64%Rocky Balboa: NYS",6,4,6,18 May 2008
Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl," Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the black pearl.
","Now let me get this straight I do not particularly like Pirate movies and I despise most Pirate movies but this movie was really something. It was sure funny thats for sure, it had good action and a sweet plot to match but the thing that made the movie great for me was Johny Depp I have never seen a funnier pirate then Captain Jack Sparrow he made the movie about twice as good. Orlando Bloom and Keira Knightley also did pretty well and the movie also had sweet special effects which is needed in Pirate movies. Overall I rate this movie high and it has become my favourite pirate movie ever so I rate this movie really solidly at a 98% because of none other then Johnny Depp. So go Pirates.",10,0,3,6 July 2007
Happy Gilmore," Happy Gilmore is the best golf Comedy ever apart from Caddyshack
","Now I know you make be thinking that they are the only golf comedy's but what about Caddyshack 2. Well anyway this is Adam Sandlers golf comedy classic that shows that Adam Sandler will never die. The movie is about Happy Gilmore, The enraged failed hockey player who needs to raise money to save his grandma from being evicted from her house finds his ability to hit the long ball. The movie is a must watch for fans of Comedy as it is a laugh a minute comedy that Adam Sandler would have had so much fun in. Overall the movie is a good one and while I can see why people do not like it I do and I think other people should at least see this film as this is comedy at its finest. I rate this comedy 93%.",9,0,2,13 December 2007
"South Park: Bigger, Longer & Uncut"," South Park movie- excellent movie from an extra excellent show.
","Now, I think the show was better but this movie was still extremely funny like the bit where Cartman is in the trench and he says ' hey Kyle' Kyle 'yes Cartman' Cartman ' When I called you a big fat Jew I did not mean it you are not a Jew' it was priceless I mean you cannot pay to have laughs like that. Anyway the story is about the 4 boys who go and see an R rated movie and are pronounced Corrupted and from there the mothers convince the American President to plaid all out war on Canada. I think it is funny and shows you what all South Park fans have always wanted to see- Kenny face. Overall this film is a must watch for fans of the show as it keeps the charm of the show and is funny all and all. I rate this movie 78%. GO TREY PARKER AND MATT STONE.",7,0,0,19 December 2007
Ice Age: The Meltdown," Not as good as the first movie, but highly enjoyable
","This movie suffers from sequel fever, it probably should n't have been made, and that nearly kills it in the first place. However the writers and cast of this 2006 made sequel seem to pull it into a pretty decent film.In this movie we see Manfred, Sid and Diego living in their version of paradise before they are forced out of their home by unforeseen events, they then begin their journey to a safe location.The movie has lots of character's, most of them are funny and add to the sorry but some feel forced and just there to provide slapstick humour (Crash and Eddie did n't get laughs from some of the kids even) but to the films credit, it does n't completely stuff up the original character's, and they still take front and center in this sequel.Overall, this film does not even compare to the first film but is an enjoyable watch for fans of the first movie. This is a very good movie for families to sit down and enjoy together.",6,0,0,5 July 2009
Spider-Man 2," nearly as good as the first
",This Spiderman movie is an awesome sequel as it has all the charm and action of the first one and a little bit more as well. The really good thing about this movie is that it does not forget what made the 1st one good and did not insult the first one. This time the story is about how Peter Parkers social life goes down and is forced to give up being Spiderman as he starts to lose his powers. The movie is good for so many reasons one being that it has way cool action maybe better then the first it has lots of storyline again like the first and it is absolutely bearable and does not lose interest half way through like so many movies do now days. Overall I rate this movie 82% for being a good sequel.,8,1,2,2 July 2007
Pirates of the Caribbean: At World's End," Pirates of the Caribbean: At Worlds End.
",Pirates of the Caribbean 3 is an awesome movie that is the funniest of the 3 as it has all the things that you could want from the second sequel. This time the plot is that Elizabeth Swan and William Turner have to go and save Captain Jack Sparrow from Davy Jones Locker. There are lots of things that are really good in this movie which are 1. It has more laughs then the other two movies 2. It has an awesome storyline and 3. It had really cool action scenes that rock the house. Overall I think that the movie is really funny and while being just a little bit worse then the first one it is a bit better the Number 2 so I rate it 93%.,9,1,3,12 July 2007
Spider-Man 3," good movie that does not quite hold up to the others
","This movie has most things which a Spiderman movie need like violence, a storyline that does hold its own and good acting(excluding Tobey Maquire acting performance of a bad boy) but it is not quite as good as the other 2 movies as the storyline is not as good and Venom comes in kind of late and even though the movies is an awesome movie in ways it will never be known as the best Spiderman movie ever as some people I know call it. Overall this movie has its moments and I would rate it around 72% for the violence scenes and the fact I liked all the other movies on Spiderman so heres to hoping that Spiderman 4,5 and 6(which I heard they were going to make) and look for the 5 second of Stan Lee if you have not watched it yet.",7,0,0,2 July 2007
Star Wars: Episode VI - Return of the Jedi," Great Finale to the Trilogy
","In 1977, a movie came out that blew our mind...In 1980, a sequel was furthered our mind and how we looked at things...And in 1983, it ended...In its 6 years and 3 years of the original trilogy of Star Wars, it had attracted a fan base unseen by any movie of that time, it had shown people just how clever and well written Sci-Fi could be, instead of the weird, half finished stuff made before 1977, but most of all, it had so much to it that you could watch it multiple times and never get bored of it.In this film, we see the rebellion try to attack the seemingly defenseless second death star, and Darth Vadar trys to turn Luke to the dark side.The film was not as well written as the first 2, but it had the magic of the first 2. On the subject of the Ewocks, they may of not been the best thing Star Wars ever came up with, but they were cute and were definitely a part of the story. The end was great and really left the Star Wars fans wishing it was not over.And then began the 16 year wait for Episode 1. I rate this movie 79% for being a great end to a fantastic trilogy.",8,1,2,7 June 2008
Scary Movie 2," Only a few funny bits in a mostly unfunny film.
","The first Scary Movie was OK, it was gross but worth a watch. This one is covered in toilet humour and half baked sex jokes. But there was indeed some really funny bits if you look hard enough, like the keep away with the skeleton (Overlong though and they ruined it with swearing), the 'Look in the music room' (Ruined again by swearing) and the bit with the statue that says 'When you go black, you never go back' were 3 funny parts in a mostly bad movie.In this movie, we see Cindy and her friends from the first movie (With Christopher Masterson as an added bonus) who are offered to go to a scary house with a immediate A with completion. From there 'funny' hyjinks ensure. The film is worth a watch for people who have absolutely nothing else to watch or just want to see an OK scary movie spoof.Overall, the film is bad but with a few exceptions which at times is quite clever (Many jokes were ruined by swearing though). I rate this film 49%.",5,2,4,17 June 2008
Blades of Glory," Blades of Glory: Just Another good review.
",Blades of Glory is a funny comedy starring Will Ferrell and Jon Heder. The movie is good on many levels and Will Ferrell and Jon Heder are very funny respectively and the movie keeps you laughing all the way around. The story is about Chazz Michael Michaels(Will Ferrell) and Jimmy Macelroy(Jon Heder) who after 3 and a half years of being band from mens figure skating find a loophole that allows them to qualify as a mens pair teams. Overall this movie is an hilarious Will Ferrell and Jon Heder movie and is a must see for every Will Ferrell and Jon Heder fan and I rate it a very fair and well deserves 93%. So see this movie and you will be disappointed as there are around 50 laughs in the movies running time.,9,0,3,20 July 2007
Rocky II," Rocky 2: The 117th review
","This weekend I have submitted myself to watching all the 6 Rocky film in 3 days. This is my second review started at 5:30pm 16th May 2008.The film is a bit seamy compared to the other one, but is well written and well acted out by characters that seem to beg out to be noticed and try to get another few dimensions to their character as possible before Rocky 3. The film is honestly an art on how to make sequels. Not TOO seamy but enough for the audience to remember why the first movie was a tribute to every movie ever made.In this film, we see a retired Rocky struggling to find a job and having to deal with Apollo Creed badgering for a rematch after being embarrassed in their first fight. He then gets back into the ring to save his reputation and save his family.The film is how all sequels should be made and certainly has the viewing feeling that the film was well worth watching and if films now day were as well thought out as this film there would be no problem with ideas in Hollywood.Overall, the film is great to few and is a tribute to the first which was a tribute to all movies everywhere. I rate this film 72%.",7,0,1,16 May 2008
Star Wars: Episode II - Attack of the Clones," George Lucas made mistakes, but learnt from old ones
","In 1999, the long awaited prequel came out of Star Wars and to many, it disappointed. The film was not like any other Star Wars films, it had the comic relief character of Jar Jar Binks and many overlong scenes like the race scene and the Political Debate.But when this one came out, there was the promise that fans would like this one and it would make up for the first one, but alas, this was not the case as fans still heavily criticized the movie.In my opinion, I thought the movie was A lot better then Episode 1, George Lucas learnt from his mistake of overlong scenes and, to my delight Jar Jar Binks only had a very small cameo in the movie and he only appeared for less then 5 minutes.On the Dark Side of the film, it had too many one liners (I did like the mind reading scene though) and it kind of got boring while leading up to its final conclusion. The film was quite interesting though and it did not take very long for it to get out of its uninteresting slump.I am still yet unsure whether fans don't like the prequels because of heavy expectations, respect to the originals, whether they actually hate the movie or they just want to agree with people and try to make some semi real friends.Overall, this film is a great watch for fans of the original trilogy and to all fans who ACTUALLY hated the Episode 1. I rate this film 73%.",7,3,5,8 June 2008
Forrest Gump," Forrest Gump is and always should be a remembered movie.
","Forrest Gump is a classic movie about a not so bright man who was in a lot of historical moments but because of his brains he does not realize the effect of his life so he does such things as teach the to be Elvis his(Elvises) famous walk,tell JFK that he had to pee and became a famous Squid salesman. Whats really good about Forrest Gump is that it shows that while he had an adventurous life he did not have and overly great happy fun life and the movie shows a lot of Forrest Gumps life and does not leave anything out which makes it one of the most famous movies ever. Tom Hanks performance in this movie ranks 2nd on my favourite performances ever(first being Leonardio Dicaprios performance in 'Whats Eating Gilbert Grape'. Overall I rate this movie 91% for being an enjoyable movie and putting in more information then most other movies definitely a must see for everyone.",7,2,5,1 July 2007
The Bourne Identity," This Is The Type Of Care All Movies Should Be Dealt With Nowadays
","I have read the book, and I enjoyed it very much, it was a great book worth reading for everyone who is a fan of spy books, and like this the movie is good for fans of spy movies, as this is one of the best, it was great to see the great storyline unfold and they do it with so much care that it really serves the book one hefty tribute.The movie starts off well written and the action scenes are very well done. You can see at parts just how good ofa movie it is, with every scene the directing can be seen trying to reach a little further and makes the movies fight scenes, worth while every time.Don't get me wrong, this is not the ultimate movie, but it is definitely one of the best action films for sure, and 'The Bourne Supremacy' was extremely good as well. Third was OK but lacked the charisma this one had.Overall, action and spy fans will love this version of the classic spy book, and they will also love the sequels that come after it, I cant wait to see the 4th one come to the big screen (The Bourne Leagcy)",8,2,2,27 August 2008
Monsters vs. Aliens," A fun movie full of funny in jokes to the sci fi genre and great cameos
","After seeing the trailer for this movie about 3 months ago I was n't really impressed and did n't really think this was the type of film I would want to see. But after seeing some of the big name stars they had in this film I decided to give it a try and I must say I am happy with it. It is another generally funny family film by Pixar.The next paragraph is just plot, if you know it you can skip to the third paragraph.The films plot starts at the wedding of Susan Murphy (Reese Witherspoon), who is getting wed to a cocky news reporter (Paul Rudd) who has a long plan to become head anchor of a big city, instead of the small local community he conducts from currently, but when Susan is hit by a meteorite she grows 50-100 feet tall (I think its that tall) and is placed in a government quarantine by General WR. Monger (Kiefer Sutherland from '24') with B.O.B (Seth Rogan) a big blue blob without a brain, The Missing Link (Will Arnett) who is a lizard thing captured after terrorizing teenagers on a beach, Dr. Cockroach Ph.D who was a scientist studying how humans could become more like cockroaches but then becomes one and Insectasourous a huge and dumb animal but still lovable . Anyway eventually they have to take on Galaxar (Rainn Wilson) who is trying to blow up then world in return to have his own planet of clones.OK out of plot time",7,0,3,13 April 2009
Rocky IV," Just passes as an OK film
","The 4th film of Rocky in my Rocky Weekend was a weird movie representing the hardships between America and Russia at the time. The film is not as well executed as the other 3 and does not really reach its aim as a movie.In this film Apollo Creed is killed by a powerful Soviet boxer and Rocky must avenge his death and get the Soviet boxer back. The film is simply OK, not comparing to the first 3 at all but still OK. The film is good at keeping people entertained and that is all I expected really. The film is not for everybody though, you cannot expect too much from a movie that really was only made to lead onto the 5th one.Overall, if you enjoyed the first 3 Rocky movies then you should like this one. It is watchable despite some peoples comments and while it is the worst Rocky deserves to just be known as a Rocky movie that did not quite reach its goal. I rate this film 53%.",5,0,1,18 May 2008
Spider-Man," Spidermans an action movie that will be watched no matter how bad it is
","Spiderman is a good movie that deserves the speculation about it. From the title you would think I hate spider-man but after watching this series of Spiderman movies I am now a Spiderman lover because I've watched old ones bought Dvds, bought PS2 games, seen older Spiderman Dvds and lots more. Well I think everyone knows the story that Peter Parker is bitten by a radioactive spider and becomes Spiderman and this movie did this and everything else well too. Another good thing about Spiderman is that it is not just gory they do not forget storyline which lots of movies seem to do nowadays. Overall I think movie deserves high praise because in my book it is the best Spiderman movie,PS2 game or sequel ever so 84%.",8,0,1,2 July 2007
Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban," Took a dark turn here and it was certainly a move to the future.
","Now this is my least favourite of the series and I just cannot place my hands on why, the film has stellar acting performances by all cast and crew and the film keeps to the book quite well but the only problem was, was that it did not keep the same vibe the 1st and 2nd one had. In this third film, Harry becomes a lot more wise, he is now having to face Demeter's and is continuing his feud with Draco Malfoy but overall I do not think the film came off. I am a huge fan of Harry Potter and I love the ultimate darkness of the films following but there is something about the unfolding of this one that does not feel right. I think this film overall was OK and deserves to be watched by Harry Potter fans everywhere. I rate it 63%.",6,0,0,2 March 2008
Tropic Thunder," Best Comedy Of The Year And Maybe The Decade.
","Lets face it, this decade the movies are not up to the standards of the 90's, especially with comedy's, but who could expect 2 decades in a row of great films. While the 90's helped make a lot of cult teen classics, most of the straight to DVDs are just rip offs with smutty humorand the threatrecal ones are usually remakes or sequels.But this film is one HELL of a relief for the movie industry. It makes fun of it with the right type of vulgarity and makes fun of themselves with a healthy porportion as well. It is a joy to see EVERY SINGLE actor playing their role with a lot of energy and bounce (Especially Tom Cruise). The movie accepts Hollywood but also makes fun of it at the same time, and the film is written so cleverly and funnily that you not once get bored through the middle of it. It really is that good.To once again praise the actors, I must say this is one of the better comedy's of many of the acotrs in the film. Ben Stiller as the stuck up action guy who is convinced he is still in the movie is extremely funny, and Jack Black was funny in bits as well, but the best bit of the movie was the relationship between Alpa Chino and the Australian Actor who had a medical procedure to turn into a black man for the movie. The nerdy platoon members is good as a stand in cameo as well. As for the cameos, Tom Cruise is the best, he is offensive, crude, fat, bald and is a Jewish Movie Producer and Matthew Mcounoughey was also pretty funny as Tugg Speedmen's (Ben Stiller) Agent.Overall, the movie is very funny and well worth a watch. It is the first downright hilarious film at least this year (We have had funny ones don't get me wrong) and this stands far over the rest. I wish we had a comedy like this every year or so. I rate this film 87%.",9,2,8,23 August 2008
Quantum of Solace," Not As Good As Casino Royale, but it IS Bond
","Lots of people are saying Quantom Of Solace should not be counted as a James Bond film and is more like the Matt Damon trilogy (In a couple of years Quadrilogy). Admittedly while this film is very different to the bonds we have seen in Bonds 46 year movie life this is still Bond and a good one at that.Daniel Craig returns again in this direct sequel to Casino Royale that I have heard takes place about 20 minutes after the first one. When watching the start car chase scene I must admit the car chase scene was much like a Bourne scene, but luckily the shaking of the camera ended after that scene.As for the performances of all the actors James Bond is again awesome as James Bond and he really plays him with a confidence not seen since the days of Sean Connery, Judi French also plays her role well as M who tries and fails to stop Bond from wrecking everything in his path in this film. As for the new Bond girl it was a major letdown compared to the Bond Girl in the first one but she still played her part well and did all she needed.For the storyline everyone must of thought when they found out about it that it was very different from the other 21 James Bond films where, and I think that it was an experiment that needed trying. If they did not try to shake up the Bond films at least a little it would get repetitive. And they have been doing this since Dr. No in 1962 they changed it up a little so it would not boring and while this is a bigger jump I will reinstate my previous comment and say it needed to be done.My only complaint for the movie (And it is not a big deal) is the red aired agent that appeared for like 3 minutes and did not really have much to do with the plot except at one stage she trips the bad guy (Not in an action scene) and sleeps with Bond.Overall, this is another good edition to the Bond series and I cant wait to see what they come up with for Bond 23 which is meant to come out 2010. I rate this film 73% for being very enjoyable.",7,2,3,25 November 2008
The Love Guru," I did not mind it
","Honestly I have seen worse. Going into to this movie I was expecting to be having a head line like 'Sorry Mike, you stuffed up' or 'Bad Movie make me sad, sad' but I was definitely happy with the result the film has come up with.The film did have some bad jokes and some stupid jokes that would not be acceptable even in a sketch show but their were quite a lot of good jokes in this movie, and if you are able to look over the bad, you will definitely like this film.Personally, I am very surprised that this movie got only 33%. It was funny and well acted by most and I am glad to say that Jessica Simpson was only in it for 10 seconds or so and the part of the midget (I think that's the correct term) was also moderately small even though his character probably bought down the rating (Mostly Mike's Reaction annoyed me the most).\Overall, it is a good film to see, it is funny MOST of the time and if you can get over the bad, you will be able to get the good and you will like this movie. Also, if you are going to rate my comment was not useful, don't just do it because you disagree with my opinion, I do not want to be insulted that my comment was not useful because some people disagree, you can do it if you ACTUALLY have a problem with my comment itself. I rate it 58%.",6,4,8,13 July 2008
Hellboy," It Was OK
","Which is good for an action film. Usually they go at a 4/10 for me with only a fex exceptions.Anyway, I watched this film because the sequel is coming out this Thursday (Australia) and I thought I had better see the 1st before the second and I think I will end up going to it no doubt.The film starts off well, with Nazi's trying to spawn a devil from hell, in the couple of minutes it is open, a Hellboy comes out, and he grows to be the secret weapon of the American Military.The film is well written in parts but gets boring in others. You can definitely see at some parts the effort put into this to not make it as boring as other superheroes movies.As for the actors, Ron Perlmon does a great job as Hellboy, just like the other characters (Myers and the love interest) do a good job in their role as well.Overall, it is a good film, not great but worth a watch or 2, the sequel actually sounds better with anything so I will definitely recommend it to people reading this.",6,1,1,23 August 2008
I Am Legend," It was a good film, but it was built into something it could not keep up with.
","Don't get me wrong, it was a good film and held up very well. It was emotional, action filled and the storyline was worth awards for sure, but it was built up so much, that it made it seem like something that it could not be and in my opinion, it is the fault of the marketing. You should market all of the big movies but if you overdo it, you may not only get disappointed fans, but also the chance of less DVD sales.Now, off the subject of marketing and onto the movie side of the movie, it is extremely good. Too often now do we see movies completely ruined by special effects and big name actors, and lose everything that the (Very thin) storyline, but in this film, we see the good concept executed well and melted in perfectly with the special effects which were very good. Also, the direction in this movie is in the top 10 directing performances in 2007 by anybody, every scene is so thought out and magnetizing that if you turn away for a second, it takes 10 minutes to catch up.When I first watched the film, I did expect more, as I have previously stated from market hype, but I did enjoy it more the second time. I do strongly recommend this to everyone who enjoys a good movie.Overall, I liked this movie, but it could have been better, it does get boring in bits, but it is an overall exciting flick. I rate it 74%.",7,0,0,30 June 2008
The Curious Case of Benjamin Button," Great Movie
","I just got back from watching this with myself and a few friends as the second of six movies I was seeing for my birthday (This follows the Disney film 'Bedtime Stories') and I was amazed at the skill and heart put into the film.First of all, this is based of the incredible short story of the same name written by F. Scott Fitsgerald written in the 1920's and the movie follows his words so well and makes them into one of the finest movies (I would say it was in the top 10) of the year and possible the decade. All the actors are fantastic and seem to know just how much needed to be put into the film, and no one goes to far like in some of the other dramas I have been watching recently.Anyway Brad Pitt and Cate Blanchett a great parts of this movie and without them I think it would be hard to think of anyone else who could play them like the did. They share a great on screen presence and I would certainly like if they teamed up again in a future picture.The storyline is a big one, they all take defining moments of ones life and what one can expect to go through in life and really look at this through the eyes of another, who, by chance cant witness things like he would want to.Overall, this is a fantastic film and I will definitely watch it again. If you have not seen it by now you should plan to see it as soon as you can. It is a beautifully written, directed, acted and thought out film. I rate it 84%.",8,0,1,4 January 2009
Transformers," way different from the cartoons
","Transformers is an awesome movie that is way different from the cartoons in a good way(though I probably say that partially to the fact I hate the cartoons a lot) and was actually a really good film. When I saw they were making a new Transformers movie I just went 'no way in hell am I seeing that movie' but when I saw that Steven Spielburg did it I thought that it might no be that bad so I went and saw it and it was even better then I ever could have thought as it had good action, comedy lots of things good about it. I guess though it proves though that you can not judge a movie by it's name. Overall I think that movie is great there is a couple of floors but really it is an awesome movie so I rate it 89%.",Null,0,2,3 July 2007
Dumb and Dumber," Dumb and Dumber: The Farrely Brothers first movie.
","Dumb and Dumber is not only the first Farrely Brothers movie but also one of the first ones they made. The movie is about 2 guys who do not exactly have a high knowledge about, well anything. One day Lloyd Christmas drives Mary Swanson to the airport and when she leaves her bag behind he and his friend Harry go on a mission to give it back to him in nice sunny Aspen, not. The story makes you laugh from start to end for anyone who wants to laugh. This is the type of movie you can watch 100 times and still wanna watch another 100 and then another 100 and so on. Overall this movie is a spectacular movie thanks to the Farrely Brothers who show us their Genius in their movie. I rate this movie 84% for pure genius. Also if you have not seen any of the other Farrely Brothers movie some to watch are There's Something about Mary, Kingpin, The Ringer and Say it is not so.",8,2,3,26 September 2007
The Imitation Game," What Better Way is There to Learn History?
","An entertaining narrative and amazing performances by actors Benedict Cumberbatch and Keira Knightley, combined with fleshed out characters and old-fashioned epic styled cinematography, cover up minor moments of typical biopic cheesiness, making this movie highly worthwhile.I must confess that I knew very little about Alan Turing before going into this film. An incredibly fleeting preview look at who he was showed him to be a highly influential figure in the British victory in World War II, and as somebody later in life prosecuted for the then-crime of homosexual acts. Although Turing himself seemed like an interesting man to read about, I was initially slightly hesitant. Biography pictures have never been my cup of tea, and even the presence of talented actors such as Benedict Cumberbatch, Keira Knightly and Mark Strong were not enough to convince me of this film's potential quality. In the end what convinced me to see it was the mix of a good trailer, solid early reviews on the movie's quality, and the fact that the director Morten Tyldum's last movie was the very exciting, and very good, 'Headhunters', which showed a lot of potential in him as a director. The movie does a lot well straight off the bat. It's a highly entertaining film which moves at a fast pace, as it focuses mainly on Turing and his team of code-breakers as they try to break Enigma, the Nazi military code machine. Along with the main plot the story cuts back to Turing's childhood, when he was an outcast who was picked on at school before a boy named Christopher befriended him and introduced him to the codes which would play such a large role in his life. Also featured is Turing after the war, where police are investigating a break in at his house, which ultimately leads to him being targeted as a potential homosexual. By changing the time-frames that the story is being told in, and slightly messing with chronological order, the story is made infinitely more interesting, and we get to learn far more about the man Alan Turing. Unlike failed biographical films, this movie has characters that feel genuine, and don't just feel like actors saying famous lines that the person was famous for saying. Of course, there are scenes where that does happen, but for the most part it is not a problem. The direction is top-notch throughout this whole work, and Tyldum gives the film the look of an old-school spy thriller, giving each shot an air of importance and, along with the work of the script by Graham Moore (and adapted from the book by Andrew Hodges), keeps what could be a slow and plodding story moving at a brisk pace. Although the movie gets a lot right, it does have some moments that bring it down from a potentially great movie, and keep it at just being very good. For most of the movie, the soundtrack is superb, and atmosphere building, however on some occasions it is overbearing and creates some cheesy moments. In general, melodrama proves to be the film's main problem, with a few cringe-worthy scenes that are quite typically found in the biopic genre. In these scenes, characters act far more earnestly then they most likely would in real life so as to build the tension of dramatic moments. That being said, this dramatic flair is also what makes the movie interesting, so I suppose moments like this are easily forgiven. Another small problem I had with the film is that some historical moments just feel like they were added for the sake of it, almost like they had a check-list of things to cross-off that had to be in the film so as not to bother history buffs. In a movie that already flirts dangerously with what is fact and what is fiction, some of these definitely don't feel necessary. Overall, despite some flaws, the movie works as it is incredibly entertaining with a clever narrative that shows the effect that Alan Turing had on the war. From what I hear the facts are exaggerated, but that feels understandable, and the movie still results in a smartly directed and worthwhile movie that has potential to be a genuine crowd-pleaser, in the old-fashioned meaning of the word. The lame and more clichÃ© moments in the script perhaps keep the movie from being great, and the no-risk approach to maintaining the likability of Turing perhaps is why it just misses out on taking the movie to the next level. That in mind, I would definitely recommend this to anybody looking for a movie to go and see in cinemas. Cumberbatch and Knightley are brilliant, and I will definitely be eager to see Tyldum's next feature film. Score: 7/10",7,1,4,12 January 2015
Caddyshack," Caddyshack: The Review
","This movie is an awesome movie that is and probably always will be one of the best Rodney Daingerfield, Chevy Chase and Bill Murray movies separately and is one of my favourite to date. The movie is a must see for everyone as Chevy Chases,Bill Murrays and Rodney Daingerfields characters are just darn funny that anyone normal would laugh at. Overall I rate the film very highly for originality,Humour,wit and style so yes I recommend it maybe even to buy as it is so good and it keeps getting better by about double every time that you watch the film and so does the laughs as the movie as it go's along and I must of laughed around 35 times during the duration of the movie. Goodbye.",9,2,4,4 July 2007
The Dark Knight," Heath Ledger makes a good film great.
","The best Batman of all time, and while Heath Ledger may have died shortly after this, he really goes all out on his portrayal as the evil Joker and adds many sides to a character usually so dull and boring.The film is miraculously clever and good and throughly deserves its place as the best movie ever, it is a masterpiece of statue and awesome action. It is so much better then every other film I have seen in a long while.Christopher Bale may be considered the best Batman of all time, but Heath Ledger is the best character in a Batman movie of all time, this film is even better then Batman Begins.Overall, the film is quite interesting to watch, it really keeps you interested for the full 152 minutes. Also, Heaths performance in this is completely set aside from the other peoples in the movie, and seems to separate himself from the other performances in this great movie. I rate this film 84%.",8,3,7,19 July 2008
There's Something About Mary," There's Something About Mary is the Farrely Brothers best ever movie.
","There's Something About Mary is the best movie from the Farrely Brothers and probably the best Comedy/Romance out there. The movie is about Ted, who has not got over high school crush Mary and after 15 years goes to try and find her which leads to one disaster to another. The movie is really funny and extremely different in many ways most notably being the fact they do not meet after the high school scene for about 40 minutes and many plot twists make it the smartest Farrely Brother movie . Overall this movie is a must watch for anyone even if they do not particularly like the Farrely Brothers other movies you should watch this movie and if you do not like it then you have some issues. I rate it 93%. GO THE FARRELY BROTHERS.",9,1,2,27 September 2007
Groundhog Day," My 25th Review: This movie is a comedy that should go down with Bill Murrays best.
","Now I am a big fan of Bill Murray and I loved movies with him in it like The Man Who Knew too Little and Caddyshack. The movie is about a stuck up news reporter who finds himself in his home town reliving Groundhog Day over and over again. This movie is good because it is clever, original and funny or hilarious as I should say. This Bill Murray movie is probably my equal favourite one with him in it to The Man Who Knew too Little. Overall I rate this movie very high for cleverness and all that while being one of the funniest Bill Murray movies out there so I recommend this to anyone and everyone as it is enjoyable and should be(and probably by now is) a major classic so 97%.",10,2,4,7 July 2007
Rocky," A great piece of film making. It is a service to all lovers of movies.
","I just finished watching 'Rocky' for the first time in a few years. I first watched it as age 9 and now I am 12. The film is the best dramatic film on the life of a not so smart underdog who just wants his break. The film is powerful and certainly delivers its message.The film is about Rocky Balboa, a down and out wrestler who never got his break. He then gets offered to a game from Apollo Creed, the boxing champion of the world as he looks to get an unknown an opportunity as it is of course the land of opportunity.The film is so cleverly written, directed and the acting performances are so top notch in this (Especially Sylvester Syllone) and are so good that it is hard to watch them in another film.Overall this is a masterpiece of status and pure brilliance in the art of film making. The movie deserves (As it is) to be recognized as one of the best movies ever. I rate this film 82%. I recommend this to anybody and everybody.",8,0,0,16 May 2008
Rocky III," Lighter Rocky makes for a lighter movies
","This is my 3rd Rocky today. I wanted to see how each individual movie was written and directed. This review was started at 8:53pm 16th May 2008.In this installment, he is beaten by the younger fighter Clubber Lang (Played so 'Gracefully' by Mr. T). He must then return to the ring one more time (Untill the sequel) and find the 'Eye of The Tiger'.The film in itself is OK. It does not compare to the brilliance of the first 2 but does work well for the series. It is well acted and well written and directed. Syllone's performance is once again spot on to the character of Rocky.Overall, the film is good for a view but people who have not seen the first 2 should definitely watch them first. The film holds it own and is and should be considered a good sequel.",6,7,13,16 May 2008
Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone," Great adaption of the book, apart from some horrible acting performances it really holds up.
","Now, there was an extremely high amount of hype about the Harry Potter movies when they announced they were going to make it in to a movie and Fans all around the world were hoping that unlike most screen adapted books that they would keep the magic of the book inside. Now, when I saw it, I was more relieved then anything, I went in expecting the worst out of it and it was only really watching it on DVD for the first time that I realized that it really was a great movie and apart from a horrible habit of overacting on Hermoines (Forgive Speeling)part it was held together excellently. Another thing, Daniel Radcliffe did one of the best child actors performances ever as he was Harry Potter, he was not the actor playing Harry Potter but he was actually Harry Potter. I also think the actor playing Ron (Ruprint Grint) is an excellent addition to the class and does well as Harry's sidekick during the film. I think all fans of the Harry Potter books will love this film and the many sequels that followed and even though the acting skills of Hermoine had not yet developed, they got there. I rate this film 73%. GO HARRY POTTER.",7,0,1,29 February 2008
Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets," Fun sequel filled with tongue in cheek humour and a great cast ensemble.
","Well, I think that when they made this one, what they were looking for was to remind the audience of why they liked the first one and for the first hour, they do just that and from there they move onto a darker and cleverer version of Harry. Now, in this one it seems that some actors who did maybe not so well in the first one were starting to really pick up in this one like Hermoine. Well, there was again lots of talk about this one like whether Daniel Radcliffe could keep up with the ever evolving character but he pulled it off with what seems like very little trouble although I doubt highly that it would not have been a little trouble. Well this one has better special effects then the first one and they had done a great job extending the characters to fit in with times and the effort used in this one is just so cleverly used. Once again, they got away with some scenes cut out in this one. I rate this 74%.",7,0,1,29 February 2008
Transformers: Revenge of the Fallen," Not as good as the first one but is better then most Hollywood dribble
","I remember not expecting anything good when I walked into the first Transformers movie since I had not liked the animated series, I was not a big fan of Micheal Bay's (Judging from Pearl Harbour and Armarrgedon being terrible) but, since there was nothing else good I went anyway and I was surprised, since it had good special effects (Well I saw THAT coming) and actually had a storyline and I was impressed, it was definitely a step up movie wise for Hollywood/Micheal Bay.Then when I heard about the second movie and I think with my high expectations I was pretty much down there. I expected the same fantastic quality of the first one and while this movie is good, it does not ever reach the quality the first one did.In this one Sam goes off to college 2 years after his first battle with the decepticons. But adventure follows him there and he is led into the second major battle of good vs. evil.The story is alright although lacking in some places, the movie does use its long run time well though and never stops unless it has to. Although the special effects take up this one more, this was not the only problem. They added too many of the characters just for kid humour, something which was lacking in the first one (which is a good thing) and I hated the twins that talked give even though that has not been considered a cool thing to have in a movie in about 5-10 years.Overall, the movie fails to reach up to the standards of the first movie but is pretty good and well worth a watch for fans of the first movie and the show. I rate it 62% for being an entertaining popcorn movie. Nothing more.",6,1,5,29 June 2009
Ice Age," Now THIS is a family film
","There has been a lot of bad kids films in the past decade which relied on tired jokes, predictable story lines and fart humour but this show is n't like that and really can be enjoyed by everyone in the family.The plot starts with Sid the sloth, who, after being abandoned by his family after migration, finds Manfred, a depressed mammoth who just wants to be left alone. Together, they find a baby and decide to take him to his tribe to be with his family. While this is going on, a gang of saber toothed tigers hunt for the baby and send fellow tiger Diego to find the baby, but when he finds the baby in the care of Manfred and Sid he decides to lead them, acting as a tracker right into an ambush. Here begins the humour.The plot is more balanced and the characters more likable then in your ordinary kid film. In this film we see more then just the usual fart and slapstick humour and begin to see jokes about their actual situation and while it does have most of the jokes aimed at kids, the jokes are fresh enough that adults will respect the experience as well.Second, this film has a great back up of not only a good storyline and animation but all the voice actors support each other beautifully and help add quite a style to this movie that also adds to its enjoyability.Overall, the film is funny and has many enjoyable moments. I definitely recommend it for the whole family from the kids to the adults. This is (As usual) the best film in the series.",7,0,0,5 July 2009
Stranger Than Fiction," A good movie that you ask yourself throughout 'Is it a comedy or tragedy.
",Stranger Then Fiction is a very clever Drama/Comedy that is definitely his cleverest and most thought out movie ever. The movie is about Harold Crick a guy that has the same daily routine day in day out before finding out that he is actually a character in a novel that that the author is planning to kill him off in the end of the novel. The movie has twists all over the place and is really unpredictable yet really understandable. Overall this movie deserves an extremely high rating as it is definitely one of Will Ferell best and Dustin Hoffman and Queen Latifah also do a pretty good job in this awesome movie so watch this movie and it will make you think while you laugh. I rate it 83%.,8,1,2,10 July 2007
Jaws," Good horror flick for so many reasons
",Jaws is a classic a classic 1975 horror movie that is good for may reasons 1. Class as in it is not just a gory shark movie 2. It does have the good gore that a good horror movie needs.3. It has a storyline thats not just about the shark and 4. It shows that sharks are not bad guys but that mayors are if they are like the one in this movie. The movie is about when a young girl gets eaten by a shark the chief of police tries to shut that beach down but the mayor does not because it is the summer time which leads to death and a great movie. Overall I rate this movie really well especially for a horror flick and has the class that most of them lack so if you have not already seen it see it. I rate it 88%.,8,0,2,8 July 2007
Kingpin," Kingpin is an awesome movie and thats all I really need to say.
","Kingpin is one of Farrely brothers early movies which makes you laugh from start to finish. The movies is about Roy Munson(Woody Harrelson) a bowler who may just be the best ever for the sport. After a freak accident caused by Ernie Mcracken(Bill Murray)he can never bowl again. After 17 years he meets Ishmael(Randy Quaid) an Amish who secretly bowls at the local shack and of course takes him under his wing the only way the Farrely Brothers know how. The movie is hilarious the whole way and even though could of risked putting Bill Murray in a bit more it was definitely one of the best Farrely Brothers movies. Overall the movie is a must watch for any fan of such movies as There's something about Mary, Dumb and Dumber and other movies along that line or if you just wanna watch a movie that will make you laugh. I rate this movie 73%.",7,2,5,27 September 2007
Hancock," 2nd best superhero movie 2008
","Yes there was probably only 2 major superhero movies released this year but this film is actually a really funny film all the way through and is a great delight to watch.All the way through, Will Smith really lightens up the superhero genre with another classic to Will Smiths growing popularity. The movies storyline and the way it is written rally suits the film and the way that all the actors handle themselves fits the movie together quite well.I think that the film is definitely a good way to use up 90 minutes of time, the film is funny and exiting and I all but hope that the planned sequel is half as good as this one.Overall, the film is great for a view or two and the film rally leads up to a sequel. Will Smith once again proves himself as a actor of many faces. I rate this film 73%.",7,0,1,27 July 2008
Bring It On," this movie is really stupid
",I reckon that this movie is just a pile of dribble about cheerleaders and I think that this movie is just made for the cheer leading with a tiny bit of storyline in it. There are loads of things wrong with the movie but I must say that I did laugh around 10 times which is not great but is not horrible either as I must of seen about 100 worse then movie. This movie does not deserve its rating of 59% and more like 48% because it's a bad movie but I still laughed 10 times. Overall I think this movie very ordinary and should be in a $4.00 bin at Ezy DVD let alone $15(which I've seen before) so you should only watch this movie if there is absolutely nothing else to watch and if you have an need to watch to watch a Kristen Dunst movie just watch something else.,5,0,1,4 July 2007
The Waterboy," The Waterboy is one of Adam Sandlers best comedy films.
","Now I am a huge fan of Adam Sandlers dumb-ass films but I think that is why people have let him a have a career so long. They just love his dumb-ass movies. The movie centres around the local water boy who when the coach of the football team notices he can tackle hard when mad he puts him as the new quarterback of tackeler guy sorry I am Australian. The movie is good on many pointers as it shows that Adam Sandler can play 2 different types of dumb guys, nice dumb and guys and mean dumb guys. If you have not already seen this you should take some time to seat down and enjoy the movie. Overall this movie is a fun excuse to seat down and dumb out but I can see why people would not like this film. I rate this film 83%.",8,16,25,13 December 2007
The Shawshank Redemption," Fantastic storytelling. A modern movie classic.
","I was not born when this movie came out so I have just had the chance to watch this movie and actually appreciate it recently and I must say I can see why this movie is recognized as one of the best movies of all times. The movie generally gets across human emotion and the acting and directing of everyone involved makes this movie a brilliant show alone. Not only is the movie well made but the story of it is fantastic and certainly does not mess up Stephen Kings novel. Even in it's near 3 hour runtime it does not ever get boring (and this is coming from someone who comes from the add generation) and always has a story to tell. Everything in this movie is important about the storytelling, from the main story to even Brooks story of him spending 50 years in prison and then being released and realizing he is completely dependent on the prison and has become used to being enclosed in its walls.Overall, the film is a masterpiece and I am glad I got to watch such a fantastic film. It is certainly up there in terms of the best movie of all time, and even though I am a little hesitant to call it the best, I would definitely put it in the top 10. I give this movie 96%.",8,0,0,30 June 2009
Shrek," Shrek: a new generation of fairy tales
",In a generation where Fairy Tales are not as popular as once were this movie comes out and revives it completely. The movie is about Shrek who is an ogre who sets out to get his swamp back after the king kicked all the fairy tale creatures out of the land. But when the king asks him to go and get a princess for him This leads to a fun filled adventure. The movie is good for kids and adults and is good just to get away from the world from for 90 minutes or so. Overall This movie is a must watch for the whole family. It is to be recognized as the Saviour of fairy tales and if you like this one check out Shrek 2 and 3 and also the new Shrek The Halls if you can find it. I rate this movie 93%.,9,0,1,1 December 2007
Casino Royale," Great James Bond, Daniel Craig IS James Bond.
","I think that just about every poster on IMDb since this movie came out 2 years ago has noted that even though people doubted Daniel Craig as a good James Bond, he has proved in sensational fashion that he is a very worthy advisory to the James Bond list of actors. As we see this new James Bond we must look back and see how different the James Bond films are with every new actor, there was George Lazenby whose movie as J.B is not looked as at a great success, Roger Moore who brought the character some weird movies (Moonraker probably the most out there for story lines), Timothy Dalton who showed a darker bond, Pierce Brosnan who is a great bond especially his first film golden eye, but now we have an actor is has brought a more Sean Connery atmosphere to the Bond genre, and has completely revamped it at the same time.The movie itself is extremely good. The film is a heavy competer for the best ever Bond film and the way it is shot is very good. The film never fills boring even through its 2 and a half hour time period and really shows layers to James Bond that were not previously there. Also the ending is spectacular and I did not see it coming. That is also why he goes for revenge in the second film. The side characters are quite good too, from the eye bleeding bad guy, the new bond girl or M, the one who tries desperately to stop Bond being Bond. Anyway it is that depth with its characters and actors and seems to hold up well. This is definitely a movie people who think the James Bond series has gone down the hole in the past few years will enjoy immensely.Overall, Daniel C. is a great edition to the James Bond team and I hope he is here to stay, I look forward to seeing 'Quantom Of Solace' today and I hope it is as good as this one. I rate this 84%.",8,1,2,21 November 2008
Ice Age: Dawn of the Dinosaurs," Sometimes funny, sometimes not
","This is the third movie in the highly enjoyed Ice Age trilogy and after the fantastic first one and sadly slightly lackluster second movie, my reactions when I heard of this movie was that of not caring. But when I had seen everything else at the cinema I went, and I must say this movie was pretty entertaining. Its plot, while predictable kept me entertained and the character's were kept true to their usual self's.Some negative movies though is the humour it resorts to if a scene starts to drag on a little and this film we saw a lot of the same humour used in 100 films before it but only a small fraction of the films jokes were taken up with this and mostly the film kept original.Overall, I think I enjoyed the movie more then the second one, but the second one had this bit for style and grace. I will give this movie 52%.",5,17,29,5 July 2009
Fantastic Mr. Fox," Not Anderson's best, in my opinion, but certainly a very entertaining movie
","Fantastic Mr. Fox based off the classic story by Roald Dahl is a very abstract kids film done by legendary director Wes Anderson. This film by Anderson is aimed more at the family market (Which was expected to all those who have read or heard of the book) and it seems like he pulled it off. The movie is lined with a strong cast of acting professionals, ranging from starring roles (George Clooney, Merryl Streep) too supporting roles (Bill Murray) just to name a few. The movie sometimes goes out on a bit of a limb and while most of the time is funny and entertaining there are moments which are just plain annoying. The story, while not staying very true to the book, is executed moderately well by Anderson and although his style of directing may not fit as well into the family film market he certainly has made an entertaining film worth a watch. Overall I would give it a 7/10.",9,1,3,6 January 2010
Speed," Speed is an awesome action.
",Speed is a good action movie that Keanu Reeves and Sandra Bullock do very well in. The story is about a cop thats arch enemy is plotting to kill him and one of his steps is warning him to get on a bus that has a bomb on it. Keanu Reeves is the best I have seen him in this movie and Sandra Bullock is pretty good as well and they make the movie better then it would be without them. This movie is good to sit down for 100 minutes or so and just enjoy and not think too hard about. Overall this movie is very entertaining and deserves the high rating it has. So watch this movie if you want to see a fast paced action triller and if you like good old Keanu Reeves. I will rate it 72%.,7,0,1,19 July 2007
The Producers," Mel Brooks first movie is certainly a good one.
",As I said on the summary this movie is a good one it has loads of laughs in it has class and the right actors to play the people. The movie is about 2 men one a washed up movie directer(Zero Mostel) and an insane but clever accountant(Gene Wilder) discover that they can get more money from a flop then with a hit. The storyline works really well and Gene Wilder steals the show really but Zero Mostel holds it up really well. This show has got a lot of good things in it 1. Mel Brooks famous humour is very clear while it being probably his smartest movie.2. The storyline is the best out of a lot of movies and 3. It is very very original. Overall I think this show while not being Mel Brooks funniest definitely deserves a lot of praise so I rate it 91%.,Null,1,2,3 July 2007
A Night at the Roxbury," Funny movie that I do not see around the place too much.
",A Night at the Roxbury is an awesome comedy that I personally think deserves to be a famous one. The movie is about 2 people one being Steve Butabi(Will Ferrell) and Doug Butabi(Chris Katten) are two men who's life dream is to get in to the Roxbury and get some ideas to make their own nightclub. The movie is good for a number of reasons 1. It has loads of laughs in it 2. Will Ferrell and Chris Katten are perfect as Doug and Steve Butabi 3. It has good cameos and is unpredictable. Overall I think this movie deserves an enormous rating something like 73%. So watch this movie for a few laughs and you will not be disappointed.,7,2,3,8 July 2007
Star Wars: Episode IV - A New Hope," Great Piece of Cinematic Glory
","Lately, I have been writing reviews on some of my favourite movies when I realized I had not reviewed or even seen Star Wars in great some time.Star Wars is very fast moving with great acting performances, lines and the feel that the people enjoyed what they were doing. The film is a great piece of work to the sci-fi genre and is presented cleverly and well written. This is another great example of a movie that has not been expected to do well in cinemas but has anyway. Out of the few people who have not seen this, or there has been a large gap since your last view, you should immediately go and get your hands on a copy of this fantastic movie.Overall, this movie is a service to all great movies. It throughly deserves its rating and goes to show once again you don't need to have the biggest budget, to come out with the best movie. I rate this 83%.",8,1,1,30 May 2008
Monty Python and the Holy Grail," First and best movie from the minds of Monty Python
","I remember when I first heard that Monty Python had made a movie, I rushed to get a copy from my local video store. I did not know what to expect except a good film.The film is so clever and goes from scene to scene brilliantly while keeping the viewer entertained. Graham Chapmen does a good job as the lead role and the humour displayed in this movie is so funny that it makes up for the last 10 years of Hollywood.Overall, the show is hilarious and is almost as good as the show. The other movies are funny but none are this good. Watch this movie whoever you are. The movie kicks so much ass it is amazing. I rate this film 89%.",9,1,2,18 May 2008
Star Wars: Episode V - The Empire Strikes Back," Better then the original.
","In 1977, a movie came out, it was a type of movie, had the type been made before, yes, had it been done to this extent, absolutely no. Then, in 1980, The sequel came out, and after the dismal 'Star Wars Holiday Special' it had a lot to prove......And it delivered. This was all the original Star Wars and more. The film is so exiting and just absolutely blows the mind of the viewer with its thrills and shocks it definitely keeps the viewer enthused whole heartedly for a the whole 2 hours.In this film, we see the Rebelion who are celebrating their victory against the empire, when they attack and wipe out their allied forces.The film is so enthusiastically acted, written and directed.Overall, this film is exciting and a great service to the first one. I rate this film 89%.",7,0,1,7 June 2008
The Wedding Singer," The Wediing Singer: the 303rd comment.
","Now I know this movie has been reviewed a lot but I just wanted to get my word out there. This movie is an awesome achievement as it is funny the whole way through and is just overall a nice movie. The movie stars The Wedding Singer who after his fiancÃ© leaves him gets depressed and becomes The Wedding Bagger. He then meets Drew Barrymores character who changes his life around. I know how it sounds just a stupid comedy with a little romance but this is much more then that. It is frigin hilarious. Overall this movies a cinematic masterpiece and is one of Adam Sandlers best movie. I rate this great comedy movie 83% for being funny, witty and for starring Adam Sandler.",8,0,1,13 December 2007
The Simpsons Movie," The Simpsons Movie is just as good as the series.
","The Simpsons Movie is an awesome movie that is just as good as the series. The movies plot is that after Homer dumps Pig Crap in to the Springfield river the EPA(Environmentel Protection Agency) puts a giant dome over Springfield. The movie is very funny and I am very glad that I waited 6 years to see this film. The film is very good for many reasons like It did not repeat humour from the series and that it did not lose depth in the characters. Overall this movie is a must see and deserves high praise and while there are some jokes there that could insult you(for example Religion, Gay jokes and children drinking alcohol) but it is a very movie and is good for kids. I rate it 96%.",10,3,10,28 July 2007
Talladega Nights: The Ballad of Ricky Bobby," Talladega Nights is one of my favourite Will Ferrell movies ever.
","Talladega Nights is a funny comedy starring Will Ferrell and John .C. Reily. The story is about Ricky Bobby(Will Ferrell, a stuck up race car driver that has a beautiful wife, house and a good friend in Cal Naughton Junior(John .C. Reily) but when French Formula 8 driver Joan Girard comes and beats Ricky Bobby his life goes down quite a bit down the track. This movie is very funny and Will Ferrell does very well as the stuck up Ricky Bobby and has been one of my favourite movies for a very long time. Overall I think that this movie is a very funny and deserves a very good reputation and a high rating. So I rate it a fair and true 88%.",9,0,1,21 July 2007
Semi-Pro," Semi-Pro may not be as funny as Blades of Glory but it is good.
","I laughed many times in the duration of this movie and most of it was indeed very funny. It did not drag on like most comedy's today and was good for 90 minutes of laughing. This time, Will Ferrell plays the team's coach, captain and promoter for a failing basketball team but when the team finds out they are going to be disbanded if they do not come in the top 4 they must get there groove on to keep the team alive. Will Ferrells performance is good once again in this movie and while a bit similar to Blades of Glory was indeed a good film and well worth watching for comedy's sake. Overall I recommend this to fans of Will Ferrell and do not care if the comedy is smart and sophisticated or not. I rate this film 72%.",7,3,7,15 March 2008
