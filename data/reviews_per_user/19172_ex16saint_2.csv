The Devil's Advocate," A mediocre film with an excellent ending
","For the first hour I was disappointed the acting was poor and the film did not really seem to have direction, as the end of the film approached it sped up and al pacino sorted the acting side out. The final scenes were amazing, one of the best finishes ive seen and when he walks out onto the empty street you are given one of the best film moments ever.",7,0,1,27 March 2000
Man on the Moon," Jim Carrey is fantastic the film, sadly, is not
","Jim Carrey was incredible this and the Truman show prove that he is a good actor, sadly despite Carreys incredible performance and some wonderful moments the film is not all that it could have been. It may be because Andy Kauffman was a stranger to me before I saw this film but I think that alot of the Humour (Kauffmans sketches) have become dated, at the time what he did was new and controversial but now it has been copied perhaps more successfully. I would have liked to have seen more time on the man rather than the stage performer. 7/10",7,0,0,9 May 2000
