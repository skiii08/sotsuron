The Longest Yard," The Longest Yard, or a McDonald's commercial ?
","Now I'm not one to bash movies very often, but sadly, this movie deserves a bit of bashing. I found this movie to be one of the poorest re-makes I have seen in all of the years I have been watching, and writing about movies. This Longest Yard lacked all of the personality, characters, and true feeling of the original. Sure, there were some funny lines, but plain and simple, this movie does the original no justice at all. Secondly, I certainly understand product placement in today's movies, but to be completely honest with you, this film was more of a commercial for McDonald's than anything else. For those of us who loved the 'Real Longest Yard', I leave you with this thought, buy the original on DVD - you will be glad you did ! HIS-TO-RY. (By the way, what happened to the warden's assistant?)",2,13,27,27 May 2005
Meet the Parents," Future in-laws, beware of the cat !
","Once upon a time there was a fun couple living in Chicago, so much in love how could they have a problem in the world ? The answer is, take a trip to New York and visit your future in-laws whom you have never met. The antics and revelations that unfold in this wonderful comedy will make you laugh hysterically, and feel compassion during each and every scene. Ben Stiller portrays Greg Focker the lovable all to easy target of Jack Byrnes a former CIA agent played by Robert DeNiro. The cast of characters are more fun than you can ever imagine. Teri Polo as Pam Byrnes turns in a very nice performance as Stiller's love interest who tries to protect him from the interrogations he receives throughout the movie. This is a fun well made feel good movie that I would recommend highly.",9,0,0,12 October 2000
How to Lose a Guy in 10 Days," Fun, but ultra commercialization.
","I sat and watched this movie with a very open mind, and the hopes of seeing a fun romantic comedy. What I saw was a commercial for the NBA.WOW, talk about your product placement ads. Was it just co-incidental that this movie was released on the NBA's All Star Weekend ? If you were to remove the needles NBA nonsense, the movie was actually fun, and very enjoyable. I find that Kate Hudson is a true, and genuine young star with endless talent. But, after a terrific film like 'Almost Famous' this was a bit of a disappointment.",6,0,0,28 February 2003
Bridget Jones's Diary," Bridget, she's not perfect, but...
","Before I begin my review, I must admit I am a big fan of English comedy movies. Renee Zellweger was absolutely wonderful in this movie. Her English accent was dead on the target. In fact, I saw the movie with some friends from the U.K., and they complimented her endlessly on her performance. Hugh Grant and Colin Firth were ideal as Bridget's love interests. I enjoyed this movie from start to finish, and I think it deserves a solid 9. I wish more movies had the heart this one did.",9,0,0,18 May 2001
Pearl Harbor," How they wrecked a good movie..
","Are you familiar with the term 'addition by subtraction' ? Well that saying is the ultimate definition of this movie. Why the producers of this film allowed it to be ruined with an absolutely pitiful, and absurd love story puzzles me. There was more 'Hollywood' in this movie than even Hollywood should tolerate. The factual events that occurred were depicted well, with amazing authenticity and reality, and would have been more than enough to make this movie work. However, each time the movie strayed form the actual event, the production suffered miserably. If you can get past the totally un-believable Hollywood mish-mosh this film is not too bad. But, it could have been so much better. Please keep in mind it is over 3 hours long... hey somebody bring back the intermission !",7,0,0,29 May 2001
Moulin Rouge!," Just not my idea of fun...
","Here's the confusion I am confronting - How do I write a review on a movie that I walked out on just about an hour after it began ? It's easy, state the facts. In excess of 85% of the movies' dialogue was not spoken, but sung. I am a big fan of Nicole Kidman's work, but I lost interest in this movie about 15 minutes after it began, and incidentally that's about how long it seemed before Nicole Kidman appeared on the screen. I don't walk out on movies very often, in fact it's a very rare thing that I even leave the theatre before the credits are finished rolling. But, now and then it's necessary to bite the bullet and say that's enough and walk towards the exits. I feel confident you'll see this movie appear in the video store bargain bin very soon.",3,1,2,4 June 2001
Mr. & Mrs. Smith," Mrs Smith made better pies !
","How do I give this awful film any credit at all ? I guess I can't. Although, Angelina Jolie looked beautiful, and Brad Pitt was his usual handsome charming self, that's it folks. This movie was a total ZERO ! It seemed almost incomplete. Where were all of those steamy love scenes that the supermarket tabloids screamed about claiming how this movie broke up Brad and Jennifer Aniston ? The only thing this movie did was deplete the amount of money in my wallet. I just thought to myself as I left the theater today, Hollywood has just taken another 180 degree turn with the release of this flop. After seeing the wonderful Cinderellaman, this was a total disaster.I should have read, and followed the reviews of the critic in my local paper. 'Stay AWAY !'",2,30,64,10 June 2005
Creed II," A bit better than average
","The only thing I can say about this movie that might be negative is that it was unbelievably predictable. The acting was excellent on all accounts, but the viewer in my opinion had to know exactly what was about to unfold as the movie progressed.
However, overall a good entertaining movie.",7,0,1,24 November 2018
Cinderella Man," The First '10' in MANY years !
","I must tell anyone who reads this review, that this movie is the first movie I have given a score of '10' since Schindler's List back in 1993. This movie had everything, from the amazing portrayals given by Russell Crowe, and Renee Zellweger, to the tremendous supporting role played by Paul Giamatti (Sideways). This picture had everything right on the money according to a very good friend of mine who grew up in the era this film depicted. The authenticity was simply as accurate as I could have ever imagined. This movie should win several Academy Awards, actor, actress, supporting actor, and director. Ron Howard hit the bullseye with this effort. Bravo, a job well done. With all of the garbage Hollywood has been producing, it was great to exit the theater feeling like it was actually worth the admission price for a change.",10,10,20,3 June 2005
