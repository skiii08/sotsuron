The Blair Witch Project," 'Scary as Hell'...I don't think so
","I don't think it gets much worse than this movie.  The only scary thing about it is that someone could make a movie that is so bad.  There are not words to describe how bad this movie is.  I thought it looked like and interesting movie so I went to see it, and it is a very short movie (87 minutes I think) but while watching this movie it seems to go on for hours. This is the most boring movie I have ever seen.  Heather felt she needed to tape everything they saw which got very annoying.  I think I have only hated about 5 movies in my life but this is definitely one of them.  I am not a person who saw it once and judged it, I saw it about 5 times and it gets worse every time.  If you have seen this movie then I feel very sorry for you and if you haven't seen it I suggest forgetting it exists.",1,8,14,19 September 2000
