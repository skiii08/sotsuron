Blade Runner 2049," Three stars is generous
","Perhaps I gave three stars as a tribute to the three hours of my life lost watching this dreadfully dull pos film. Maybe it was for the cast and crew who got behind the project working tirelessly until its completion. But more likely it is an arbitrary number that isn't the worst but no where near the best, not even mediocre - because if it wasn't for the original, I would have never given this film a second thought. VERY THANKFUL that I did not have to pay theater prices, rather I saw it on HBO... over two, three days as I would have to stop and start the meandering meaningless storyline. The original Blade Runner was a film that I had to study at film school - wrote several papers on the various meanings throughout the film. While the original was far from perfect, it was original and with a purpose and a storyline that almost anyone could follow... the reboot, or sequel, prequel or whatever you want to call it, totally misses the many points that were made in the Original film. If you are checking to see if this film has good reviews... make sure to read more... it's a lemon that has been left out to rot and mold - take a pass and watch something else.",3,4,6,4 June 2018
Interstellar," Save your time, this film is awful!
","I'm on a Redbox binge because I'm limited to only 30gb of internet a month. Therefore, I save gigs by watching films through Redbox though after this horrid experience I might just buy another 30gb plan but I digress. That's how I happened on this supposedly high rated film. Tired of the mediocre crap that you normally get out of Redbox, I cross referenced IMDb in hopes of a better choice. Disappointment is an understatement. Somewhere around an hour, I realized the film would be nearly THREE HOURS LONG! So much unnecessary garbage effects, dialogue, etc. Christopher Nolan WHO CARES?I'm just thankful the trite, clichéd and extremely boring film is over. Thankful that I had it on DVD and could fast-forward through the epically duller parts save yourself the time wasted from your life, since I've already done it for you, forget about this film and move on to something better. I sure wish I had been warned.",1,5,9,16 October 2015
Jackie," Jackie is just bad and not in a good way
","In all fairness, I'm writing this at only 14 minutes into the film. I was excited to see that HBO had offered it and my Roku TV does little side 'hey-have-you-seen-this' ads. Since I needed something to watch I clicked on it, ready to be entertained for a couple of hours. Whoa - I was wrong. Natalie Portman speaks and it's like someone is scratching their nails down a chalkboard. Some have said that her impersonation is pretty good... ugh. It just sounds like a person trying real hard to sound like someone else. Add poor acting and you've got a real bummer deal. Especially for those who actually spent hard earned cash on this drivel. So here I am at the beginning of her recant on the day her husband was shot and I just don't think I have it in me to give it anymore time. After reading all the other posts about how awful this film is... I'm going to go with their recommendation to quit while I still have roughly an hour and a half left. I'd advise the same: don't bother.",1,1,3,27 August 2017
It Follows," Fresh take on horror
","For weeks I danced around whether I should check this film out. The reviews held pretty high here and the reviews were equally consistent though I didn't read too many just so that I didn't spoil the film. If you are looking for a new twist on classic horror, this is such a true treat. Rich with tropes, hidden understanding and a hyper-reality that the audience can touch in a classic way. Essentially, 'It' is as ambiguous as the time frame the film is set. Yet another pinpoint light right on the total subject: age, adulthood, coming of age, as time goes by as seen with the fact that you cannot tell if this film is set in the 70s, 80s, or almost a future way with the clamshell compact eReader as well as the slow walking like a tick, tick, tick, tick of a clock that subtlety references time marches and eventually 'It' will catch up with you.Some of the many layers of the film would suggest that 'It' is adulthood. Although it some have compared this film as Nightmare on Elm Street meets the Ring but really no, It Follows is definitely deeper. This film is as deep as you want it to be and even deeper still with multiple layers. Completely original, unique and has its own very recognizable queue including the score. The film opens with a long pan 360 shot and continues to provide this type of shot throughout the film. Rich photography and cinematic shots. It gives you a doll house, watcher and being watched. If you haven't seen this film, watch it now. If you like horror films, you will not be disappointed.",8,4,10,31 October 2015
Lucy," Good Idea that quickly fell apart
","WARNING: This review could contain spoilers, continue reading at your own risk.The basic premise that humans in particular do not use full brain capacity is an extremely fun story idea. The bounds are limitless. However, this film took humanity and turned it into some computer (man made). It just broke the whole notion of our existence and reduced our lives to a tribal nothing. We are either reproducers or searching for immortality and I think that is a broad category to toss everyone. Scarlett Johansson's acting turned from mediocre to robotic after the first 20 minutes. Probably because she was bored with the part considering it's almost the same premise human and machine or human turns machine, or machine turns human storyline that we suffered through before in 'Her' albeit with only Johansson's voice. The idea was great but the rest really turned out hokey. Oh well perhaps someone else will come up with a better story on the same premise.",4,1,5,10 March 2015
