The Perks of Being a Wallflower," Book Review For The Perks Of Being A Wallflower
","What was the movie about? The movie was about the boy named Charlie. The movie was about his life. It was about Charlie's family members and his friends Sam and Patrick. This movie also talked about another person who is Charlie's, Aunt Helen.Who were the main characters/ How did you like the actors? Logan Lerman- (Charlie), Emma Watson- (Sam), Johnny Simmons- (Brad), Paul Rudd- (Mr. Anderson), Ezra Miller- (Patrick). I like the actors by their activeness, responsibilities. Also their trustworthy, helpful, caring, confident, and also hopeful.What was your favorite part of the film? My favorite part of the film was when the teacher Mr. Anderson said, 'We accept the love that we deserve' to Charlie. Also when Charlie and Sam became a really good friend. Also when Sam passed the SAT test!Compare it to the book. Did you like the film or the book more/ Explain. I think I would like the book because it mostly talked about the real things about all characters in the book. But in the film, some of the things are just faked up. They are just made that up.On a scale of 1-5 stars, what rating would you give the movie? Why? I would rate this movie 3 because some of the things about in this movie are really match with the book. But some of them are not. For example, in this movie, it doesn't really talk about Mr. Bill.Finally, I can say that this movie is good but less than the real book The Perks of being a Wallflower. The characters names are still same, nothing changed! The book and this movie actually talked about the character's actions or their works. They both actually shows us the all character's characteristics traits.",5,1,3,28 March 2017
