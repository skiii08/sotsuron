The Blair Witch Project," At first I was a little disappointed with the film
","At first I was a little disappointed with the film, that amateur look exasperated me (but the interviews are great). I remember thinking 'My teenager daughter could film it better'.  Next day I was still thinking about the movie, and the other day, and the next day... I guess the movie is better than I thought...",8,0,1,12 October 1999
Shakespeare in Love," It's always a reward to see a movie which portrays Shakespeare's time and art
","It's not easy for most of us, specially foreigner readers of the 20th century, comprehend Shakespeare plays.  Here and there poetry and beauty in his words touch our hearts.  So it's always a reward to see a movie which portrays Shakespeare's time and art, translating it in a way we can fully enjoy. As always, Judi Dench steals our breath with her acting. Thank God I saw this movie!",9,0,1,12 October 1999
Gladiator," strenght comes from sacrifice and compassion
","Among all the strong images of fightings we see in Gladiator, the opposition between the concepts of Greed and Honour impressed me the most.  There is a show of action, beauty and convincing performances, and a lesson of how strenght comes from sacrifice and compassion.  Besides great fun, Mr. Scott gave us lessons on art and human virtues.  I can hardly wait for Hannibal. 10/10",10,0,0,22 May 2000
