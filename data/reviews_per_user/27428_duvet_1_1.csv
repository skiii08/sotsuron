The Twilight Saga: Breaking Dawn - Part 1," Enjoyable
","I very rarely disagree with IMDb ratings but in regards to The Twilight Saga films I find myself at odds with the average score. Whilst this film is not a 10 it certainly is not below a 5. I feel comfortable giving it a low 7.The film did feel slow in places, especially the first hour, but I think that was the director and screenwriter(s) driving home the fan favourite parts of the book plus introducing several characters for Part 2. Acting was solid. Billy Burke and Anna Kendrick were fantastic and steal any scene they were in. Robert Pattinson and Kristen Stewart were both excellent. I felt Taylor did improve considerably in this installment. Overall, an enjoyable film, especially after the first hour. Plus the film sets everything up for the final film in the series.I would pay little attention to the IMDb score. At the time of writing this it has a score of 4.7. As time passes its likely it will drop further. The unweighted average is 6.3. If you break the voting down further into a male vs female of all ages you will see a huge difference (roughly 3.5 vs 7.5).I'll put it as simply as I can. If you did not enjoy at least 2 out of the last 3 Twilight films then its very likely you will not enjoy this plus it seems to help if you are female! Please remember when voting there are numbers between 1 and 10 (36% voted 10 and 23% voted 1). If you think this is the worst or best film you have ever seen you need to watch many more films, for your worst I'd recommend starting with anything that Uwe Boll or Jason Friedberg and Aaron Seltzer directed.",7,5,11,25 November 2011
