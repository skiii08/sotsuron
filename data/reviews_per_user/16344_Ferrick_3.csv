The Rock," Great Actors, not much else
","I went into this movie expecting a fun thrill ride adventure movie.  I left feeling underwhelmed.  In a nutshell, I had seen it all before and I felt that a good part of the movie was useless, such as the car chase through the city.  How many times can I see cars crash and/or blow up?  And the ending was stolen straight from the unrealistic Total Recall ending, or, the Hero always has extra time to save himself when others don't.",5,3,6,22 March 1999
Armageddon," Redundant overkill
","Maybe this story did not intend to be Citizen Kane, but, I barely made it through it.  I don't expect these movies to always deliver stellar performances or rock solid plots.  I was disappointed with The Rock, really enjoyed Con Air, had fun with Enemy of the State and was ready to turn off Armageddon.  It wasn't funny, smart, emotional or original.  With half an hour to go in the movie, I didn't care what happened to any of the characters (except maybe Steve Buscemi) and I couldn't concentrate on much because of the visual and aural overload.  I don't care how closely you pay attention, it is impossible to follow anything with all the noise and explosions.  I don't mind mindless movies sometimes but I can never see myself being in the right mood for this.",2,0,2,22 March 1999
Jerry Maguire," Fun movie but nothing Spectacular
","This is, by no means a bad movie.  I felt that the football scenes are some of the most realistic I have seen come out of Hollywood.  However, after one viewing, I have no desire to see it again.  It just didn't grab me in the way it seemed to grab so many others.  I felt that the love story and sports story were average even though I enjoyed the look at the life of an agent.  Maybe that is it...the part I enjoyed really doesn't interest me.",6,3,7,18 March 1999
