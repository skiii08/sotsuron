Moneyball," Well-made, conventional drama
","An article on Cracked.com states that we don't know how bicycle work, and that they were first created by trial and error. Nowadays, they say: 'Even modern bike design schools admit that it's not engineering or computer knowledge that make a good bike designer, but instead 'intuition and experience.'Moneyball is about the exact opposite of that.Billy Beane is the GM of the poorest team in baseball, the Oakland A's in 2002. With Peter Brand, an Economics graduate from Yale, they devise a new way of making a team- not with scouts, but numbers and formulas. The story is fairly plain, and the ending isn't what I expected (don't know my baseball history)- for the worse, but for 2 hours Moneyball is an enjoyable film with a great main character, witty writing, and generally the qualities of a good film.This is not a dramatic baseball film, it's a drama film with baseball. I thought I knew how the film would end before I went in, so I thought, 'It's not the what, but the why and how'. However this was not the case. The film didn't end how I thought, and the true story isn't as good as what I thought would happen. The true story is much less inspiring, and the filmmakers tried very hard to make it seem like the A's did change baseball. I don't know if they did, but the facts are more convincing than words.Asides from the plot, the film is about the man who makes it happen. And the man who really makes it happen. Brad Pitt gives an excellent performance as the winning- driven GM. Through a few flashbacks, we see why Beane is so ready to embrace this radical system everyone else sees as crazy. These scenes give him personality and depth. He's the dreamer in a world full of Suits, with one hilarious cameo by Bobby Kotick, archenemy of gamers everywhere. Beane learns of the stat method from Peter Brand, in a dramatic role by Jonah Hill, who more often than not plays the funny guy. It's interesting to see him play a quiet, new-to-business person where everyone makes jokes (some quite funny) while he can only sit and look scared. It would be like if Robert De Niro or Al Pacino were the guys being shaken down by the mobsters. The film is quite funny, but it has to be. It isn't a serious drama, so it goes for the lighthearted approach to avoid being flat. The writing is great, and steers away from the potentially fatal baseball slang/terms. Such gems as 'Yeah, but his girlfriend's a 6...' and 'This'd better work.' will keep you laughing. So the film is pretty safe, with a strong lead and universal 'think differently/ stick to your guns' message. Moneyball isn't going to be remembered for its uniqueness or innovation, and in fact unless it wins Oscars it won't be remembered at all. It's a good film, just not special. I only have one complaint, which is his relationship with his daughter is out-of-place in such a work-focused film. Their scenes are silly, with one ridiculous line so close to 9/11. (The movie takes place in 2002.)Moneyball is a well-made and well-acted film that doesn't push any boundaries but plays comfortably within set ones. 8.0/10",8,1,2,19 November 2011
Blade Runner 2049," Elite company
","Early buzz made me apprehensive about Blade Runner 2049- 'What if it's been so long since the first that its appeal is confounded by sympathy?' was a thought that ran through my head. But I was wrong. 2049 is one of an elite few sequels that justifies its existence, but more importantly it is an excellent film in its own right that respects the shadow of its predecessor without hiding in it or deviating into something unrecognizable.I could describe the tone of 2049 as the feeling you get when you sit in a big chair after a workout. There is a sense of relaxation mixed with lingering pain and psychological excitation. 2049 does not rush, taking its time to tell its story over 2 and a half hours. There is a bleakness in its vision of society which seemed even harsher than the original's did, notably 2049's subtle inclusion of climate change as a motif. This mixes with a familiar visual design of neon lights, billboards, and persistent rain which is strangely comforting. The score is a high point, respectfully incorporating aspects of Vangelis' dreamy synthesizers with modern and amazingly thunderous bass. The sounds of 2049 perfectly summarize its engaging atmosphere.As a brief aside, I'd like to mention my thoughts on one aspect of how dystopia has changed over the past 35 years. Old money Tyrell is gone, and the role of industrialist Wallace is now played by the much younger Jared Leto. I think this is appropriate and reflective of the times where tech giants are run by the young and savvy, exemplified by Mark Zuckerberg. Wallace has a serious god complex evident in how he speaks, and time will see if reality follows suit.I'd really like to emphasize how wonderfully audio-visual 2049 is. The various settings are mesmerizing, and even though it is easy to get focused on the plot, taking time to simply absorb the colours and design is enjoyable on its own. The original had some simple images that have since been burned into my mind, such as Deckard sipping a drink and having a little of his own blood diffuse into the drink as he puts it down. The same effect occurs here, but without any feeling of inferiority or deliberate attempt to match its predecessor.What truly validates 2049 is its plot and major themes. I won't say anything about the plot, but will say that it wonderfully scaled. This is a small but significant story in a bigger world of problems, and the film doesn't try to solve everything or make grand, sweeping statements. The film respects your intelligence, not spelling out how devices work or where K goes in certain sequences. It's up to you to arrive at conclusions. Sometimes sci- fi gets scared it alienates its audience and will over-explain; 2049 does not. The most significant strength of this film is that it explores current and relevant issues surrounding life and technology, building upon the original but having its own angle and introducing its own ideas. Ultimately, 2049 takes risks that contemporaries such as Star Wars did not, and they pay off.Blade Runner 2049 is truly excellent. I spent a lot of time discussing its relation to the original here so you don't have to as you see it. This film stands on its own, and I believe it will continue to in years to come. Time will tell if it has the influence on other works that made its predecessor such a giant in the genre. ****/****",Null,1,4,7 October 2017
Scarface," *Slap* VIOLENCE
","IMDb Top 250: 152That's how I described my first viewing of Scarface. For 20 minutes it stretches, jogs in place, then winds up and smacks you across the cheek with the first drug deal. But we'll discuss that later.In a class with The Terminator and Back to the Future, Scarface is one of the defining 80's films, and is a cultural landmark on its own. Unless you live in a sheltered community, you've definitely heard some lyrics or reference to the film in TV or music. In my case, I've even seen a car with Scarface towels for seat covers. It's one of the great stories of greed and ambition, and while not being the most thematic or symbol-heavy film, it has a good story and it tells it well.A simple plot: immigrant comes to America, won't work a crappy job, gets into the drug game, stays, rises, falls. There are a lot of them now but Scarface is one of the best.One of the most iconic aspects is the setting- Miami, 1980. The city is beautiful (despite being LA). The sets are lavish, and filled with amazing golden and sparkling things. The costumes are also impressive. You'll wish your suits or dresses were are flashy as these ones. The bright visuals separate Scarface from many gritty city films.As colourful as the locale is the characters that inhabit it, starting with the big man himself: Tony Montana is one of screen's great villains, and Al Pacino is an acting monster here. His amazing voice and brooding sneer are consistent and convincing. But everyone is amazing- it didn't register on the first viewing though. From Manny's girl crazy ways ( hilarious tongue flicking scene) to the cynical Elvira, the characters are larger than life and the performances match.There are many memorable moments that seem to flow into each other. The informative credits, the club shootout, the ending... many things can jump out, but I'd say the best scene, and the most important, is the first deal. It says: 'this isn't a mob story' and whenever Tony does anything later in the film, it's in our minds and we can tell it's in Tonys. This film could've gone wrong in many ways: it could've been shorter, or been cut down. But with Brian de Palma behind the camera, he made the film that he wanted. It's long and violent, even for today's standard. Maybe it is a bit too long- this certainly doesn't feel like a 2h 50min story- but that's a small complaint. Scarface takes its time, you cock- a-roach. The excellent script is filled with great lines like that one.One of the infamous aspects of the film is how society has interpreted it. 'Gangstas' today would lead you to believe Scarface is about criminals succeeding. This is not true. It can be easy to see why one would want to be Tony Montana, but look closer: Tony paid brutal prices, never achieved true happiness, and falls. We never see him in his prime, only a montage video, because success is not the point of the film.Many films are made to be like something else. Scarface spits on them. It sliced its own path, made its own mark, and is the inspiration for other films to this day. It's brutal and very memorable. 9.0/10",9,0,2,3 March 2012
Requiem for a Dream," See it, then good luck trying to see it again
","IMDb Top 250: 62Have you ever been scared by the aura of a movie? Requiem for a Dream was my first. Right from the start, I knew this was going to be a VERY memorable experience. And I knew it wouldn't end nicely.Obviously, Requiem is about drugs and their effects on people. But this is different, all the good has been cut away, leaving the gritty, terrifying core, addiction. Requiem is one of the bleakest films I've ever seen. This is a four-actor movie, and everyone pulls their weight. Most viewers will relate most to Harry, Jared Leto's character. He has the friend, the girl, family- just wants to make things work out. He also has his habit... The other three actors ( Burstyn, Connelly, Wayans) all step up to show three other sides of the addiction game.Mrs. Goldfarb's story is the saddest, as she isn't even knowingly ruining herself. Ironically, she is the loneliest, despite seeing the most people during the film's events.Two other things complete this essential viewing: the music and the camera-work. You've probably heard Lux Aeterna somewhere else, but the rest of the soundtrack is one of the best ever. Seriously, go listen to it right now. It will haunt you. Forever. Progressively it gets louder and more intense, as the character's scenarios change in the same direction. The camera-work works similarly, with shorter and shorter scenes until the climax. Also, very good use of split screen.Requiem for a Dream's plot is such a downer, you have to see it for yourself. And since there's not really anything like it, you won't be able to prepare yourself.*Edit* Just saw it for the third time, still a masterpiece. Another thing jumped out at me this time: the makeup. The characters look like HELL, and it looks so real. Harry's gangrenous wound... Also the ending is just as shaking and unnerving as ever. You cannot get desensitized.Very few films are as powerful as this one. 9.7/10",10,1,2,6 June 2011
Skyfall," 21st Century Man
","I don't know much about James Bond. Sure, I can tell you about S-sssean Connery, I can hum the theme, I can recognize an Aston Martin and a shaken martini, but I actually haven't seen many of the films. Heck I was born recognizing Pierce Brosnan as the definitive James Bond look, playing Nightfire in junior school. To be honest, I've only seen Quantum of Solace and hated it. Skyfall has made me a believer. For all its necessities: guns, cars, girls and chases, Skyfall is more. Skyfall is smart.Skyfall tells a sharp, straightforward story that blends elements exquisitely, with a brilliantly flowing opening chase that transfers to scenes of dialogue and plot development, then back to action... the mix is smooth, with cause and effect, drama to action. There is also some comedy laced in, akin to Nolan's Batman series, clearly an influence on this film. Skyfall has many memorable scenes, my favourite being the hotel in Shanghai. The action is always creative, the fights mesmerizing. I'm sure I'll see- if not try- the iconic subway slide one of these nights.The cinematography is brilliant, distractingly so. Clever and effective, you will be amazed at how the film is shot and how colour is used- I'll nod to Shanghai again.The acting is really something for such a blockbuster. Craig brings a very human Bond, who surprises you more than once. Skyfall looks into the past of James Bond- how does someone become a secret agent? I haven't seen Casino Royale, but after the horrible Quantum he now looks incredibly comfortable in the role. The 'style check' train jump at the beginning and throwback ride show this.Judi Dench sees lots of screen time in her 7th appearance as M, this time as a pivotal plot point, more than just mission control. She never lets her guard down, always with a look of bulldog ferocity. This cuts screen time from the Bond girls, but that's because, I have to give credit to IGN here, that M is the Bond girl of Skyfall.After his incredible turn as Anton Chigurh in No Country for Old Men, it would'v e been easy to see Javier Bardem as a vengeance-seeking ex- agent. But that's not what happened, far from it. I think Bardem's Silva will catch everyone in the theatre off-guard, in at least one way. His introductory scene is incredible, his speech chilling. His character is unsettling, his appearance ghastly, but inside he's smart, and it's his mind that really holds his menace. He's a justified villain and a very worthy opponent. Thematically, Skyfall smartly chooses to acknowledge technology. The film deals with the irrelevance of humans in conflict, and the prevalence of computers. The old in society being displaced by the young, the technologically- minded. The topic is interesting on its own, but in context it's brilliant. James Bond is a 50 year tradition, now forced to change with the world. Skyfall is the start of a new Bond era.If nothing else, Skyfall is an engaging and satisfying film. But it's more than that, it speaks about our changing society, examines relationships usually forgotten in Bond films, and features incredible actors and technical work. So it's really more than a Bond film, it's a modern landmark. 8.5/10",8,3,11,18 November 2012
Raiders of the Lost Ark," Entertainment as it was meant to be
","Film exists to provide entertainment. Raiders of the Lost Ark does just that, in its purest form. Very few other films can claim to such a beloved status as this, adventure's masterpiece. I feel like this is a film that anyone who ventures onto the IMDb has seen. As such, it's redundant to tell you to see this one. No, there's no deep message, or allegory, but 2 hours of unrivalled fun. Action, explosions, suspense, wit, romance, comedy... the ultimate blockbuster.Cinephiles may look down on Indy for not having thematic value, but that was never the intent. Armed with the most lethally sharp script in Hollywood, Spielberg and Lucas created an extraordinarily likable character put into a unique, original situation. Religious mystery? Shooting lots of people? Yes, but it's OK because they're Nazis. Or Belloq. Everything about this film is top notch, from its acting, to music, cinematography, set design... pure joy.I'd always seen this film as timeless: the version I saw was of fantastic quality and the film looks fantastic, explosions are convincing, the violence is surprisingly graphic but not extreme, but the little thing that bugs me is the CG. It's the only part of the film firmly rooted in the 80's, and it bugs me to see such primitive effects next to the most pristine presentation otherwise.But this little thing can't hold back Raiders. If there was ever a film with style and substance, this is it. One of the warmest, most entertaining films of all time, telling one of entertainments greatest stories with one of film's iconic characters. 9.3/10",9,0,0,29 October 2012
Spartacus," Powerful, magnificent
","'He'll be back. He'll be back and there'll be millions of him.' Such is Spartacus, an achievement in film, with massive scale and thousands of soldiers, but also moving: several 'manly tears' were shed. Spartacus is inspiring.It's a story that by today you've heard several times before, of one standing against many with impossible odds. But Spartacus isn't about winning, its that even a small person can make change; in this case freedom. Freedom, which the film points out, isn't eliminated for another 2000 years.Leading the charge is Kirk Douglas as the heroic, immortal Spartacus. This is his film- he looks like a revolutionary, he sounds like it, and he acts like it. Kirk shows finesse, as a capable fighter but more often a capable leader. He laughs, intimidates, sheds a few tears, and explodes on a few occasions, but he's completely believable and that is why the film is so successful.I've mentioned how epic the film is: battles, while sparse, are gigantic and all the fights are intense and really well organized. With its Roman setting, the sets are extravagant and luscious, the costumes equally remarkable. It's a beautiful film.Spartacus will get to you- seeing him on his quest, growing stronger, growing happy, seeing the loyalty of the freed slaves. By the time the climax comes, you feel the immeasurable daunt of the challenge. Then, THE scene arrives, and the past two and a half hours become 100% worth it. The ending is excellent, not cheesy and happy or completely miserable, but very fulfilling and satisfying.Spartacus is phenomenal and relevant. It's a great tale with dramatic irony (Caesar!) that shows the cruelty of a superpower. Timeless. 8.6/10",9,3,5,20 April 2012
Casablanca," A classic of classics
","Well, after sitting on my shelf for years, I finally watched Casablanca. As a young movie viewer, I have little experience with black-and-white films, so I was a little unprepared for what would happen next.Casablanca is a Rom-dram set in Africa during World War II. It was also made during World War II, during a period of heavy fighting. Nowadays, it's like a time capsule from the most violent period in modern history. But enough with the history, and on with the film.The first half hour was very faced paced, plot wise. Lots happened quickly, demanding your full attention. A viewer has to pay very close attention to figure out what's happening. However, it does slow down into a more gently paced movie. I'm not sure if that happens with all old movies, but very rarely nowadays will so much happen at the beginning of a film.The acting is great. Rick's presence on screen is felt by all, Humphrey Bogart did an unrepeatable job as the stern yet sentimental hero. Everyone else plays their roles well, but it was hard for me to really tell what is and isn't good because acting has changed over the years. It seems that old movies have very dialogue-based acting, whereas new movies have action-based acting.Speaking of dialogue, it becomes very apparent that Casablanca's is special. There's a reason it has the most number of famous lines on AFI's 100 lines list. But that's all I can say about that.Lastly, the plot. *No spoilers* After the first 25 minutes, the plot becomes coherent and the story is very enjoyable. The pacing is very good, so the film never drags. The ending is very nice, and the buildup to it has several twists, some you will see coming, others you won't.Ultimately, Casablanca is a classic film any cinema aficionado should see. 8.8/10",9,2,3,5 June 2011
Monty Python's Life of Brian," An Epic of Knockoff- Biblical Proportions
","It's worth noting right off the bat that I've never seen anything Monty Python before except for the Ministry of Silly Walks. No, not even Holy Grail. Yet. But I expected quite a bit from Life of Brian, seeing as the Pythons are some of the most revered comedians of all time.I was sadly disappointed. Life of Brian just never hit an exceptionally high, focused note. To start, the whole thing looks like a B- movie. It's as visually cheesy as a late 50's movie, and while the star of a comedy is its writing and delivery, the poor technical delivery is a major distraction.Then we move into the plot- I feel that Brian suffers from a poor plot that can't live up to its premise, if that makes sense. The initial scene, the manger next door, is a fantastic idea. The 'mistaken messiah' is genius. But the 'protesting Jews' that makes up half the film made me scratch my head- why? It's unfocused and the point is unclear, so I was always edgy and it distracted further from the comedy.Into the actual jokes themselves, some hit with me and others failed. The best parts of the film are Palin's 'Biggus Dickus' questioning and the final scene, peaking with the Jewish Peole's Front Suicide Squad. The whole Messiah angle is made humorously relevant if you consider the idiots at Westboro Baptist. But there are jokes that flew over my head or just didn't register- a man in drag isn't a winner for me, and a strange, Otherworldly scene- which my parents told me was out of their TV series- made no sense. I was initially very sour about this film. It's most likely that there's a generation gap thing, although I do have a lack of affinity for comedies as a whole. Although even a day has been kind to this film- it's worth noting I felt the same way about Apocalypse Now when I first saw that, and that's another unfair comparison I've made with this film. I can't believe these two films were played beside each other in a theatre (or not, in Norway). Anyway, to parents wishing to show old comedies to the younger generation, don't start with this one. 7.3/10",7,0,2,6 January 2013
Se7en," One of the iconic films of the 90's
","IMDb Top 250: 27Seven, David Fincher's first great film, is about two detectives in an unnamed city who hunt down a serial killer who uses the Seven Deadly Sins as his modus operandi. It's an original and clever take on the murder mystery. When those opening credits start to roll, with an awesome remix of Nine Inch Nail's 'Closer', the viewer begins to both dread what will come next, but also be unable to wait to see how it unfurls.A very important part of Seven is its setting and atmosphere. The city, unnamed intentionally, is a savage, crime-riddled town that no one wants to live in. It sets the perfect landscape for such a bizarre killer. The direction is wonderful: constant rain, dark; this is a sad, dreary place, and no good can possibly come of it. It's one of Seven's greatest strengths.Another great strength is the three major players. Brad Pitt and Morgan Freeman play the rookie and the veteran, and both are very convincing. Pitt, a five year veteran elsewhere, comes to the city intentionally with his girlfriend. We feel his unpreparedness, especially early on. He doesn't know what to expect from this dreary place; his reaction to the vomit and him waiting for Somerset outside the Gluttony murder, in the rain soaking with two coffees proves that. While some criticize Pitt's acting at the end, I think he aces it.Freeman doesn't have as hard a job, he is the perfect smart and wise character. The last player is the killer, who I will keep a secret. From the killer's entrance to finish, you will be on edge as long as the character is on the screen. The lack of emotion is unsettling.Visually, the film stands out: colours are seeped out of the picture, leaving darkness and rain: a great example is in the alley, with cameras facing up the guns barrel into the rain.The last key to Seven's success is the plot. Full of action, suspense, and a few jumps, you will be engrossed by this story till its intense, shocking finale. Each of the killings are well-thought and shown in a gory, visceral matter, but not explicitly so. Sloth and Lust are absolutely atrocious in a good way, but I think Pride could have been fleshed out a little more. That could be the only suggestion I have about the film.The less you know going into Seven, the better. One of the 90's best. 9.6/10",10,2,5,11 June 2011
Memento," Now- where was I
","I first watched Memento in late June. I really liked it. But I couldn't grasp the words to describe it. Memento belongs to the category of film I call 'Cannot comprehend with one viewing'. So here I am, the last day of summer after seeing it again, and now I can.Memento is incredible. It has to be the most small-scale mystery-crime-thriller I've seen, with a total of 3 major characters, but it's quietly brilliant. If it was a normal film, told front to back, it would be above average, but only just. Luckily it's not.The best part of Memento, the thing that makes it stand out, is it's format. When you first watch, it takes a while for anything to start making sense, and it actually hurt my head trying to figure out the timeframe. I won't say how it plays out, but it's outstandingly unique. And for some reason, like the protagonist Leonard, you can't remember what just happened. Even now, I totally forget the beginning- wait the end- no, the beginning of the film. I just can't remember.A special note- the opening credits are the best part of the film. When you catch on to what's happening, you'll gasp. It's explosive and brilliant.The three main characters are excellent. They are layered, well- played, and keep you guessing. Leonard is our protagonist, played by Guy Pearce in a big change from his other major role in L.A. Confidential. He cannot make new memories, which is why the film is presented so uniquely. He is generally disciplined, and conflicted about everything not tattooed to his body or in his photos. Guy Pearce is excellent as this walking uncertainty. His narrations are blank, like his general perception. It helps that he just looks the part. Carrie-Anne Moss and Joe Pantoliano are excellent as Natalie and Teddy, the support who aren't what they seem to appear to look like. Sound confusing? It is, until we find out more and more about them. Their personalities- or what they look like- are really good.Another note- music is minimal, but great. It really captures the small scope, while being stirring.The plot is good, but is much better because of the presentation and editing that keeps the scenes from looking choppy. There's a neat twist that changes our perspective, and Memento simply has to be seen again or you'll miss out on key things. Also, you'll totally forget your first viewing.One last note- it's really cool when the film changes from black and white to colour. Leaonard literally shakes colour into the film.In short you have to see this. It's original and unique, presented very well, and offers an intriguing tale from a cool perspective. I could easily see someone saying this is their favourite film ever. I could even be yours.9.2/10",9,0,1,5 September 2011
Inglourious Basterds," An unapologetic, **** you look at World War II
","This is a great film, and the finest example of the world through Quentin Tarantino's eyes. Taking an alternate perspective of WWII, it primarily follows Jewish Americans brutally killing Nazis. Take that in! There are other plots too, including a stellar opening segment and a theater owner's vendetta. It's tense, badass, classy and barbaric all in one package.A key factor in this film's enjoyment: receive it as a drama. When I first saw it, I expected a light film heavy on bro action, almost comedic. I can thank the bizarre advertising, slogans and title for that. I was disappointed by the film. On my second time I figured it out and enjoyed it, and now on the third viewing I got to truly appreciate the film.The five story chunks are all captivating, switching up enough to feel fresh. Being a Tarantino film, the script is a 10. Everything that is said is interesting, witty and natural. The pace fluctuates from a simple briefing to a suspenseful standoff and back again, but every scene is captivating- magnetic.Another plus of seeing a Tarantino film is that the characters are gems, performed by all to perfection. Waltz's Landa is amazing and terrible to behold, a contained psychopath. The Basterds are all slick fellows, especially Donny. In particular though I want to mention Fassbender's Hicox as a charming fellow who I wish had more screen time, Mr. LaPadite (Denis Menochet), the dairy farmer, and Til Schweiger's Stiglitz- the most memorable single shot in the film for me is him, in a flurry of activity, stabbing that Nazi in the head- somehow. Inglourious Basterds is a good show: entertaining, gripping and definitely not mindless. Did I take a life changing message away from it? No, but I do hate them Nazis. I feel that the violence, though a Tarantino staple, is a bit gruesome, but that's just me. The climax is outstanding. Let's rewrite our own history. A very bold film. 8.8/10",9,1,2,26 September 2012
The Hunger Games," Read the book or the odds will not be in your favour
","The Hunger Games is a good adaptation of good material. As a reader of the first book but not the sequels, I liked how Katniss was an independent and strong character and that it's a teen lit novel that doesn't become a love story. The idea is great (I'm a firm Battle Royale fan) but the writing was only fair- too many cheap cliffhangers- but I felt that it would translate excellently to the screen. However I was able to avoid the hype and hold a very neutral, yet educated stance.The structure of the book is intact. From start to finish the film is very faithful, with the only exception being that a flashback is told sporadically in the film instead of being laid out early in the book. The time distribution however is not equal throughout the film: the first act is skimmed through. It gets the plot rolling quickly, but the characters suffer- something that happens a lot. Gale, Prim and Mom see so little screen time, which makes The Reaping feels very wrong. It seems too quiet and empty, despite silence being the point of it.Very early we get to the Capitol, which is lushly realized despite some very plain visual effects. The costumes and locales are ridiculous, extravagant and ignorant like the citizens who wear and occupy them. And the Games itself jump right out of the book.There's two major, looming problems with the film, which are the assumptions filmmakers made about you and removing the narrator. Suzanne Collins, the author of the books, co-wrote the screenplay. So in her mind, it is assumed you know anything she leaves out of the film because you have to have read the book. For example, who Foxface is. Readers know, but if you are in the dark you probably won't understand until her arc is completed. In fact, most characters disappear in the film- Thresh gets one line, Clove, and Rue even. The thing that could have rectified this problem was taken out of the film: Katniss' thoughts. The perspective changed in transfer to objective, meaning we only see what happens, no thoughts about them. Katniss' thoughts could explained so much that didn't need to be shown and wasn't. Maybe a full blown narration wouldn't have worked, but even hearing her think to herself sometimes, or hearing things others said earlier, or even Nathan Drake (Uncharted) style talking to herself could've fleshed out the world and made the film easier to stomach for those who didn't read.There are more issues though. The camera gets ridiculous. Understandably, not all of the violence could be shown on screen, but the action shots here are sickeningly unfocused and uninspired. A late change to the 'dogs' makes the scene impersonal and has the cheapest scare I've ever seen in a PG film, and like the source material there's not much closure. Despite a healthy 2:20 runtime, characters are really underdeveloped (Peeta's alliance has no repercussions or explanation, mind-boggling), and it still feels slow in some areas. The visual effects are lazy- the flaming dress is SO BAD- it put very dangerous words in my head: cash in. There are some great performances though. Katniss (Jennifer Lawrence) is perfect, strong and unaffected by men, and the film thankfully has even less forced romance than the book. And while it's not played up for excitement, she kicks some ass for survival. Haymitch (Woody Harrelson) makes the best of any support. He's captivating, a clearly haunted and tired character, but still humorous and helpful. Seneca Crane (Wes Bentley) is a character I can't even remember from the book, and I'm conflicted about him. Some parts he seems too nice to be the Gamemaker, and in others he seems too cruel, but he gets a fantastic last scene that I think was the best original thing they added. It's very poetic. Lastly Cato (Alexander Ludwig) is the primary tribute antagonist, and I always pictured a very intimidating young man playing him. So while the casting isn't the best for him, he's convincingly vicious.The atmosphere slips sometimes. Some parts nail the desperation and horror of the event, but others actually coaxed laughter from the audience like a very important and tense last scene from the book that had the whole theater giggling- still not sure if it was intended to be comedic.The Hunger Games has its ups and downs, but a solid core. It's a fair adaptation of material heavier than its developed audience and it shows in the film that the goal is to make lots of money from fans. It's a good couple of hours but not an especially memorable film. If you're a fan of the novels you'll love because you'll actually understand it, but if you're like me, on the fringe, or haven't read them at all, don't feel too bad if you miss this one. 7.5/10",7,4,11,24 March 2012
Ted," Conventional but funny
","If you like Seth Macfarlane humour you'll like this film, simple as that.In his first feature film, Mark Wahlberg plays John Bennett at a time in his life when his childhood friend, Ted, creates a rift between John and his girlfriend played by Mila Kunis. There's no cinematic risks taken, just Seth Macfarlane humour with attempts at being touching.The jokes are spread wide, with modern jabs and many throwbacks. Some hit hard, some don't, and some I found to go too far (one 9/11 joke is horribly distasteful).The film overs many cameos of varied success levels, probably a product of the Macfarlane name.While acting isn't the draw here, everything is sufficient, and Giovanni Ribisi's creepy dad character is hilarious and steals his scenes.Ted can be a fun film if you let it. Most people probably are less sensitive than I when it comes to potty humour. Also there's a fair- sized twist at the end, but it's funny that the 'I do what I want' Macfarlane can't stick to his guns with it.6.5/10",6,0,2,27 July 2012
The Great Dictator," Hinky! My dictator friend!
","IMDb Top 250: 86The Great Dictator is a gem in film, and a gem in history. It's a shame so few people have seen it. This is one of my favourite, arguably number 1 comedy ever, and one of the best war movies ever made. I am not an easy critic to please when it comes to comedies, but the Great Dictator blew me away. It's incredible.The plot, for most of the film, doesn't go anywhere. This is beneficial for the film, because instead of forcing direction like many comedies, Chaplin decided to run the film like a series of sketch comedies. Alternating between the Dictator and the Barber, we see a series of situations occur to both characters. While the barber is 'similar' to the Tramp, Henkyl is outstanding. His first speech, absolute gibberish with a few words tossed in for humour, made me laugh out loud. Hard. I can't remember the last time a film made me do that.Towards the end, developments happen and the pacing is impeccable. Just when the sketches could start to seem redundant, the invasion plans start. Whereas most comedies stop humour for plot movement, the Great Dictator keeps the laughs rolling. I won't discuss the plot, but it sets up a timeless ending. (More on that later.) One other character tickled my funny bone- Napaloni. His Italian stereotype cracked me up, with his a-words, his a-hand gestures and costume. The satire here is spot-on. The film's ignorance is it's greatest strength. The film would be much safer, less shocking, or have not happened if Chaplin knew what was happening at the time. But because it was released when it was, we see a more raw, explicit parody of a madman and his ideas.It's funny, the importance of this film. A parody of a conflict, and what a conflict it was, while the war raged. Imagine if someone made an Afghanistan version (without puppets 'Team America') today, without fear of judgement or knowledge of the atrocities that are surely happening to both sides. That is the Great Dictator. Used to anger Axis soldiers (read the IMDb trivia), banned in many countries, and seen by Hitler himself twice. This is the movie I wanted Dr. Strangelove to be: zany and witty.The Great Dictator, despite its age, is one of the funniest movies I've seen. And then at th end, Charlie stops and gives a timeless, touching speech about war that I don't want to spoil: see it. A historical masterpiece. 9.5/10",9,2,4,2 August 2011
L.A. Confidential," This is the City of Angels, and you don't have your wings!
","LA Confidential is a modern- noir crime film set in- you guessed it- LA. In true noir fashion, the film consists of detectives, women, violence, drugs, and a weaving plot tying them all together. 'Confidential' is a well-made and well executed film.Despite what the posters, half-covered by Kim Basinger, would make you think, LA Confidential is a film about men. 3 men, three personalities. Kevin Spacey is Jack, the pretty boy cop who works with a tabloid newspaper for information exchange. Russell Crowe is Bud White, the bad cop who sees justice through, and is no stranger to violence. And Guy Pearce is Ed Exley, the golden boy on the straight and narrow, who only wants the truth... and recognition. These three are the show, and all are more deserving of an Oscar than Basinger. Especially Crowe.The setting and atmosphere works for LA Confidential. However the city is never really exposed, we're only given a name as a backdrop. Other than a short scene about a freeway and an image if an LA landmark tower, Confidential could take place in any city.The plot, in true noir fashion, makes little sense. It's excellent, but you won't understand what happens. With multiple perspectives, the information you learn will go over your head. Watch it again, and things will fall into place. The complexity and twist in LA Confidential is one of it's biggest strengths.A beacon of noir in modern cinema, LA Condiential is a very well directed and well thought film. Its depth is impressive, its performances stellar, and ending fitting. You should see this if you like noir, history, or great American crime/drama movies. 8.4/10",Null,1,2,2 August 2011
The Prestige," Brainmelting
","We learn within the first minute just what 'the prestige' is. It would turn out to be what the film is really all about, its third act. The prestige of The Prestige is twist after twist after reveal until an ULTIMATE climax, but after the second big twist your brain will be mush. The film closes with a line about 'being fooled' and I was certainly fooled. There are many questions that are answered, and further more questions that can have answers- but pursuing them would be pointless. The writing is incredible as far as the plot is concerned: the 'first, next, then' is well managed, but the 'why' at the end has lots of ambiguity. Some won't like the lack of denouement, but it's almost certainly an artistic choice and thus subjective.The plot is not linear- if you read the back of the Blu Ray or IMDb description, you will be bewildered by the first 20 minutes. Keep an open mind and just absorb the scenes in the film- there is great reward.Artistically amazing, the turn of the 20th century is a unique time period hardly explored by genres of than the historical drama or biopic, both typically 'boring' if well made films. The costumes, lighting and atmosphere are moody, like the film content. And it's really weird to hear Christian Bale's regular voice.There are issues however: the opening scenes are jarring, and it's always tough to tell when and how much time has jumped between scenes. Considering the high level of Nolan's films, especially their beginnings, this confusion put a damper on the whole film. Also, the initial friendship between Angier and Borden is hardly shown, and poorly sold. The themes of obsession and rivalry dominate the film: what would you do to get ahead of your opponent? Would it have a permanent effect on you? Both magicians cut moral corners, leading to another interesting idea: who's the good guy? Bad guy? Even by the end it can be tough to decide, if you choose to decide.The Prestige is an excellent film that boggles the mind, but I feel it too loose to be considered a Nolan masterpiece. Its plot, characters and acting are incredible, conveying a very topical feeling of magic. Nevertheless a worthy view, if you can tolerate small cracks throughout and chips off at the end. 8.5/10",9,0,1,20 November 2012
The Terminator," Man vs. Machine
","IMDb Top 250: 168The Terminator is a great action movie which can be eye candy or thought provoking, depending how you want to see it. At it's core, Terminator is about a violent cyborg trying to kill a woman. But it offers an eerie version of the future, and explores a conflict that was then unused- man vs. machine.First and foremost, Ahnold. He's huge and intimidating, which just a little too much sneer. But accompanied with kickass weapons and a surprisingly good score, he dominates scenes like he was meant to.The action is big, with some really cool scenes and chases. The 80's violence is much better than the 2029 action, which comes off as very cheesy to a modern audience. I can't really criticize though, as I have no idea what the standard was back then. The SFX also can't be criticized, but they haven't aged very well. The metal terminator looks like stop-motion, very jerky and it's distracting.The story is a big winner. Vast, with lots of expansion room, and the plot tells a tight story with a twist. The time travel is very well handled, and reasonably makes sense. I can't wait to see T2 tonight.The Terminator is a really cool action movie with brain and brawn, like District 9, a favourite of mine. As far as 80's action goes, I like the Terminator better than Die Hard. If you find it, see this classic. I'll be back.*Edit- November 26, 2011* I change my opinion about few films. Apocalypse Now, Taxi Driver, and now The Terminator demand a second viewing to see if my opinion really changes. The Terminator is an equal movie to my first viewing. But I realize that I underrated it the first time. The whole 80's-ness of it is awesome, with the punks, the sleazy L.A. streets, Reese's Nike's, tape recorders and Technoir. The music stands out more the second time, as do the hammy lines delivered by Michael Biehn in the first Act. But the future scenes feel a little better. They're really desolate and hopeless. It's hard to describe, this film succeeds more than any other Terminator because of its atmosphere. It's a dark film, but it has heart. Where the sequel goes for the (mostly) more family approach (*shudder*) The Terminator is a pure, unaltered effort for the sake of cinema. It's so fresh. This is my favourite James Cameron film, beating out Aliens. I believe this stands among 80's classics like Back to the Future8.3/10 *Edited score- 8.5/10*",9,1,2,30 July 2011
Snatch," Fun crime flick
","IMDb Top 250: 129Do you like Goodfellas? Pulp Fiction or The Usual Suspects? Lock, Stock & Two Smoking Barrels? If you said yes to any of these films, you will like Snatch.Snatch is about diamond heists and boxing, and robberies, and swearing. The plots are lightening quick, back and forth, tying into each other with events and characters. The overall story isn't the strong narrative, but it sets ups the reals draw: a cornucopia of characters.You've got Turkish & Tommy, boxing promoters, and their fighter Gorgeous George. There's Franky Four Fingers, a gambling robber, as well as Doug the Head and his cousin Avi. We've got Bullet Tooth Tony, and the sinister Brick Top. There's robbers with their driver Tyrone, and a great group of Irish gypsies (pikeys), headed by Mickey, an indecipherable Brad Pitt. And there's more. The whole spectrum is here, some see more screen time than others, some deserve more time, others less. If your cup of tea is a massive roster of criminals yelling at each other, Snatch may be your favourite thing ever. So the plot is a nonsensical modern British noir, the dialogue is fast, furious and hilarious, the pace is constantly running, and Brad Pitt is great. What could be wrong? Not much, except that if you've seen the films I mentioned at the beginning, you may get the 'been there, seen that' feel. Snatch is a great film that takes great ideas and puts them together in one place. Some may overlook this more than others, but I could not. I haven't even seen 'Lock, Stock', this films' precursor, and it feels worn in. and It's ultimately derivative, and not even the British flair and Mickey the Pikey could make it unique. Also, the broad range of characters and stories does lead to a loose structure and a 'go with it' style plot. It's all crammed into a 1 hour 40 minute film, so pacing took priority over fleshing out, but that's a personal gripe.Snatch is a fun and funny movie with lots of style, but not all of that style is its own. If that doesn't bug you, you'll love Snatch. 8.3/10",8,0,3,11 February 2012
Dr. Strangelove or: How I Learned to Stop Worrying and Love the Bomb," A time capsule from an uneasy time
","Dr. Strangelove is an interesting film. So interesting in fact I had to see it twice before I could make my mind up about it. I was born well after this film came out, and even after the fall of the USSR. However, history quite interests me and I do research on the films I see. Dr. Strangelove still polarizes me.From the mind of the legendary Stanley Kubrick, Strangelove is about war. Nuclear war. And somehow, this black comedy made it humorous. I don't want to say funny, because I didn't quite laugh out loud, but the characters are quirky, the plot over the top, and one famous scene demands a chuckle.Strangelove didn't leave an immediate impression on me. I thought the jokes weren't funny enough and the first half hour was slow, which is a big chunk of this 100 minute movie. But in the days and weeks after, I found myself referring to things as the 'Big Board' and used a crazed German accent more. What Strangelove has is staying power.This is due to the excellent performances. Sellers is a great anchor as the President, delivering some good lines. He does the job of Mandrake adequately, but his scenes weren't the best. General Ripper, while being quite nuts, would've lit up those scenes in the air force base with a little insanity. But the character of Strangelove is the best. His voice, hair, glasses and glove (evil!) are hilarious. His last scene, where his body starts to lose control, is great and his final line is priceless. Other winners are George Scott, and the anxious General Turgidson, Peter Bull's spot-on Russian stereotype, and Slim Picken's Major Kong.Unfortunately, Strangelove simply isn't as shocking or funny as another satire of conflict: The Great Dictator (If you read my review, it's golden). That film, 20 years older, stands above Strangelove in many ways, especially the humour. Strangelove is too slow-burning in comparison.And then there's the ending. While I understand the plot's conclusion, I'm unclear of the message being told to a generation who lived in paranoia. If it's that nukes will kill us all, why was this a comedy with such a left-field ending? It's not a bad ending, just a fuzzy one.I liked Strangelove more and more after I saw it. If you stick with it, it gets better later into the film. It may have had a large effect on people when it came out, but it hasn't aged too well. 8.4/10*Edit* Now, 8 months after the second viewing I can say I've seen Strangelove 3 times, and now I have Kubrick's earlier repertoire under my belt as well. I can summarize my new thoughts of the film.There's no denying that this is a great film. The script is legendary, the performances adequately silly, and there's just a very light atmosphere for a dark subject. But Strangelove is now... irrelevant. The future cannot be kind to it as it is very 'in the moment'. I envy anyone who saw this in theaters, but today it just doesn't have the same effect. It's not a universal theme that can be applied elsewhere, the film is very specific. And that is why, while great, Strangelove can't last. Still an 8.4.",8,0,1,27 August 2011
Pan's Labyrinth," Beautifully realized fairy tale- for adults
","Pan's Labyrinth, or El Laberinto del Fauno, is a film that will amaze you. Both delicate and brutal, del Toro created what he perfectly described as a fairy tale for adults. The film follows Ofelia, stepdaughter to a fascist Spanish Captain, as she uses her imagination to cope with life in the country, in a mill occupied by fascists headed by her stepfather. It also follows the rebels as they try to take the mill. They're very well interwoven, bouncing off each other.In the prologue by del Toro on the Blu Ray (the film looks breathtaking in HD), he tells of how he put much love into making the film, and it's absolutely true. The shots are gorgeous. The lighting notably sets the mood, starting off bright but becoming darker. The sets are grand, especially the fantasy ones. The orchestral score accompanies throughout, quietly affecting your emotions. The visual effects are stunning, and the make-up is scary in some scenes. No corners were cut making this film.Ofelia meets a faun, and is informed she is a princess who must complete 3 tasks to return to her old realm. She meets creatures, which are cool (Faun), gross (toad) and the iconic Pale Man, in the best scene in the film for many reasons. These creatures look wonderful.Other creatures, like Ofelia's stepfather Vidal, are not wonderful. Pan's Labyrinth make look childish, but it is R-Rated. A man's face is effectively destroyed. A leg is severed. Stitches are graphically shown. While not as explicit as shock movies, the contrast with innocent Ofelia makes the violence hard to watch.Lots of thought has been put into Pan's Labyrinth. Themes and motifs are layered deep, and wrapped up in a package of sensitivity. You can interpret it how you like. The ending is bittersweet, and very fitting to the atmosphere and aura of the film. Pan's Labyrinth is a top- notch film, and most certainly one of the best ever. It offers you a reason to think. 8.7/10",9,2,4,1 September 2011
Alien," Did it first, but not the best
","IMDb Top 250: 44 Not usually a horror guy, I decided I wanted the full Alien experience when I saw this. After all, it's Halloween in 2 days. I started at midnight, alone in my basement with all the lights off.Alien has not aged well.The original isolation movie, Alien follows the crew of the Nostromo as they investigate a distress call and deal with the titular Alien. As said before, it was original for its time, but now it doesn't fare so well.A looming problem I had with Alien was that a lot of it was boring and not scary. I, one to usually turn down the volume and squint at the screen during scary parts, sat right through this. And while I understand that tension is necessary and a slow first act builds that, the film would come grinding to a halt for sections throughout the second and third act, and the horror is lost.There are still scary scenes though. The crashed ship, the famous meal, and my personal scariest, the air vent live up to the hype of 'the scariest sci-fi ever'.The Alien itself is terrifying, in part because we never see the whole of it. Its design is brilliant. Unfortunately, we never get to see in detail what it does to its prey. In one of my favourite games, F.E.A.R., you are terrified of a little girl because every so often she explodes people and other gruesome things. In my arguably favourite horror, The Thing, you see very graphically what the Thing does. Both of these make you scared of the monster. Alien never gives you physical proof that the Alien is voracious. Even just once, a more violent death could've raised the terror. The Thing did it more than once only 3 years later, so the argument 'it was a different time' isn't exactly valid. And Alien could've been gorier. The dinner, with the chestburster and terrific acting by the victim, was very tense.I know the plot isn't the point of the film, but it could've been fleshed out. Who are these people, what are they doing? What is the company they work for? I know the lore expands in Aliens, but the story of Alien is too contained.I know the point of the characters is to die, but it's hard to feel for them. Brett doesn't do much, Parker only cares for money, and Lambert is unbearable to watch. I only cared about Ripley, Dallas (the one with the plan who is rational) and the cat.So yes, Alien disappointed me. It's a very good sci-fi movie, but the horror wasn't as good as I expected. The best thing it can do is raise its hand and say, 'First!' 8.2/10",8,0,3,29 October 2011
Horrible Bosses," A fun and silly comedy
","Horrible Bosses is a fun movie with some interesting characters and many, many crude jokes. In that regard, it's a regular comedy. Come, laugh, forget about it.The story of Horrible Bosses is about 3 dudes who want to deal with their bosses. They decide to try and kill their bosses. The first part of the film, which shows their predicaments, is funny and can be hilarious. But after meeting MF Jones, the jokes aren't as funny and the film just isn't as good. This isn't a story-based movie.Jokes. Crude, sexual, plentiful. Horribles Bosses is surprisingly vulgar. If you like Jennifer Aniston saying 'p***y*' you'll have a great time. I didn't find it too funny. The wit is lacking.Two characters are great: Kevin Spacey as the boss and MF Jones. Spacey's monster is evil, and it's hilarious. He's just an awesome actor that can play all kinds of roles.The other is MF Jones, played by a badass looking Jamie Foxx. He reminds me of Jules Winnfield, a cinematic icon. His name explanation is too funny.One character that isn't great is Charlie Day's. He's copy-pasted from the Hangover, including the beard and adding a brutally annoying voice. He's a chore to hear.You'll probably laugh at Horrible Bosses, because you're a more lenient comedy critic. But since this is my opinion, I didn't like Horrible Bosses too much and I will most likely forget it in a month. 6.4/10",6,0,0,27 July 2011
Taxi Driver," The mohawk!
","IMDb Top 250: 41 Taxi Driver. What a simple title. What do you think of when you read it? The 'talkin' to me?' scene? Bickle's quietly psychotic, one sided smile? The suit? The spring-loaded gun? The mohawk? For me, it's the mohawk. There's a lot to think about in Taxi Driver, one of Martin Scorcese's best films.Taxi Driver is a slow film, or so it seems. There's very little action except for the end, and that can be a big turn-off, especially if you've seen other Scorcese films. But after you see the complete idea, things fall into place. Then you start to like the film. I saw it six hours ago, and I like it more each minute.I realize the second time around the plot follows two paths: Bickle's downward spiral with Betsy and his... noble spiral with Iris. And when his downward spiral doesn't quite work out, he diverts that urge to his other arc. This view made my perception of the film clearer, knowing that the two plots bounce off each other. A second viewing is really beneficial.Many things are great. The first and foremost is Robert De Niro. I believe this is the best work I've seen him in, better than Raging Bull for sure, in my opinion. Here, he is the master of subtle. The half smile, the casual hair, it seems he's just a quiet guy, but it's much more than that. It's much more beneficial to the viewer to know he's very unstable. Not insane, just unstable. It creates edge, and tension. You feel bad for him- he's a Vietnam veteran, come back to America, living in New York. He's lonely. It's sad. I find it unfair to call him a villain, as the AFI believes. He's an anti-hero. We like him, because of our perspective. We wouldn't like to meet him. He is Taxi Driver. This is a film about Travis Bickle's descent.New York. That's where this takes place, and that's important. Most is seen through Travis' windshield, because that's all we need to see: New York is the spawn of scum. That's what we need to believe. Also, neon lights are everywhere. What helps us along are some blurry shots, locations, and the catchiest, almost overused sax groove ever.Many people have praised Jodie Foster, but I really can't see it. She's in maybe a half hour of the movie, despite being so key to the plot that she's on the plot summary. *Edit* I just saw the film again, and I like her much better the second time. She's sympathetic.The last act of the film, starting with the iconic mohawk, is a cinematic masterpiece. It's a shame it took so long to get there though. I would rate this film much higher if the beginning had some kind of action, tension or intensity, to show what was to come. There's no bang in the first hour, which makes the film less enjoyable at the time. Maybe if the robbery was earlier, or if Travis had a violent customer? There's a lot about Taxi Driver I can't talk about, it has to be seen. Post-viewing, it seems much more dreamlike than you remember, and in a good way. It's the small things that complete this, the things you only remember as they happen. If only it was more engaging from the start, Taxi Driver would be in my eyes, an untouchable classic.This is a film about the human mind, and what loneliness can do to it. *Edit* After seeing the film again, it's grown on me even more. While my score still stands, Taxi Driver is a true classic that would rank higher on my best of list than the number suggests. 8.5",9,0,1,16 June 2011
Barry Lyndon," Hate it or love it
","IMDb Top 250: 217Barry Lyndon is a tough film. On one hand, it's beautiful: the countryside is gorgeous, the costumes are amazing, the sets are luscious, and they tried to get as many candlelight shots in as possible. But on the other hand, there's a very plain, straightforward story about an indifferent character with little substance and far too much time. There's a distinct division in taste in this film.The Revolutionary War era is severely underrepresented in film, and with good reason: it's difficult to make an interesting story. When your film opens to a sexual game played between cousins, it's easy to be put off. It's also easy to be put off by the sternness everyone carries. And the white faces. The era is unfriendly to film, but Kubrick made it as digestible and believable as possible.However the story is pure nihilism. Barry starts out likable if boyish, but develops into something else, which like Alex deLarge leads to some mixed emotions. But Barry isn't charismatic, and seems very wooden at times. It's difficult to read him. All of the characters are flawed, but not in an interesting way: Lord Bullingdon (say that name a few times, how can you not hate him) is a snake, lacking honour. Lady Lyndon is a miserable mess who we can never sympathize with, and Ma Barry is not unlike her counterpart in The Manchurian Candidate. No one is consistently likable, so the story is never appealing. Especially since it doesn't go anywhere, or have any meaning. Sure, that's the point, but 3 hours to tell a story that could be summed up in a sentence is ridiculous. I'm all for epic length films, as long as they're engaging: Barry Lyndon is not. Barry Lyndon is a divisive film, so to help you if you decide to watch it, here are my pointers: first, brush up on your history by looking up the Seven Years War. Next, take a picture of a candle and see how it turns out. And lastly, know the moral of the story, that you're not important. With those pointers, you'' have a much more enjoyable time watching the film than I did, because despite its high production values it just couldn't grab me. Not Kubrick's best. 7.5/10",7,2,3,17 May 2012
Full Metal Jacket," Well, pilgrim, only after ya...
","IMDb Top 250: 87Like Joker's view of men, Full Metal Jacket is filled with duality: in the plot, structure, characters and theme. The only singular conclusion that can be drawn is that it is a great film, one of Kubrick's best.Famously FMJ follows Private Joker's time in boot camp, and then part of his experience in Vietnam during the Tet Offensive. Primarily the film is about 'dehumanization', saying that the war experience strips men of their identities. But, unlike many, many war films, this is not in tandem with the message of 'war is bad'. I found that Full Metal Jacket doesn't choose to suggest that nature or civilians suffer, or convey the futility of war, but instead to primarily push that the soldiers involved lost a part of their humanity. I also fond the film to be decidedly pro- war, at least in comparison to films. This is suggested by the attitude of the soldiers, shown laughing and joking with each other, shooting up the bad guys with upbeat rock n' roll playing.I'm not saying Kubrick was pro- war, as he has made several films with opposite intentions, but that this is an interestingly refreshing angle for a war film.Characters are a key strength here, with a very colourful cast. Most notably and iconic is Hartman with his incredible insults. Of course he's scary and dominates every scene for the first half of the film, but some of his material is very funny, like his view on Texans and Lawrence (of what, Arabia?). I'd comment on the extraordinary script here, but R. Lee Ermey improvised many of his lines. But the script is excellent, with the film summary being a favourite quote of mine. Hartman's tone, scary and funny, is present throughout, wavering constantly, as the line between light and heavy material is often straddled.Our protagonist is nicknamed Private Joker, and that's all we really learn about him. He's the straight character in this zany world, levelheaded and intelligent. I'm reminded of Nick from The Great Gatsby, but more likable and witty. But not even worldly Joker is safe from the effects of the war he observes in others.Then there's poor, Private Pyle. All Hartman wanted to do was weed out the weak, to avoid sending the unprepared into the heat of combat. He was tough, very tough, probably too tough, as shown by the comparison between Hartman and Joker's teaching methods. However he was excellently acted and believably led to the shocking conclusion.I've forgot to mention with the past several Kubrick films how technically strong they are, but I can't avoid it with this one. The sets are lively, the sound is booming, the costumes have personality and the cinematography is strong. It's difficult to believe the whole thing was shot in Britain.Full Metal Jacket is one of the best war movies ever made, affecting its viewers in a way I can't quite understand. This is one of Kubrick's finest, and one of the most prolific pieces of pop culture he made. Witty, somber, outstanding. 9.0/10",9,1,2,28 May 2012
The Grapes of Wrath," Wrath indeed
","IMDb Top 250: 156I can't think of too many films that show the hardships of the Depression off the top of my head, but surely The Grapes of Wrath (what an intriguing title) weighs equally to the entirety of all others. Based on a novel I haven't read, 'Grapes' follows the Joad family leaving to find work in California with their recently returned son and finding misery. This is a heavy film, a depression in a Depression.I was excited by the prospect of seeing a John Ford film, because I associate him with two major things: beautiful cinematography and 'full' films, filled with themes and symbolism. I got the first one: dark, black and white photography, with breathtaking long shots and silhouettes, and faces appearing in darkness. The second was still there, but not as plentifully as his later films. However this is an adaptation, and thus Ford's leeway was quite constricted, plot and theme wise.A film this bleak, with such a feeling of desperation (the wind sounds are chilling) needs desperate performances, and 'Grapes' delivers. Fantastic acting. Henry Fonda is just- wow. I recently saw The Philadelphia Story, and I can say Fonda's performance is far more deserving than Stewart's Oscar winning role. Tom Joad is hot-tempered yet caring: walking the fine line between cool and volatile. Fonda perfects the role and elevates the entire film with his honest performance. He is backed up by solid support, like Ma Joad and Casy. The Joad family is large, and we don't get to really meet most of them. I'm sure the book fleshes the characters out more, but I can only remember the names of Tom, Ma, Pa, and Roseasharon (?) Joad. Like All Quiet on the Western Front, 'Grapes' teaches a solid history lesson. We see the 'Okies' plight in the Dustbowl, their trip across the country with everything in one truck, and their subsequent hardships faced in California by people who don't want them stealing jobs they need too. This story is told with good flow and a strong pace- no scene feels rushed, and no scene feels overdone.Mood is another of The Grapes of Wrath's strength. There's a very post- apocalyptic feeling about it- the scramble to ensure their families survival against everyone else. We see a form of society breakdown, where people can only fend for themselves. The major conflict is hard to describe, as everything goes wrong for the Joads. Nature, other people (but no singular antagonist) and it would even seem God wants the Joads to fail. So when the dance scene comes, it's one of the biggest sighs of relief I've experienced watching films.The Grapes of Wrath is a really bleak film with a really strong lead. It's a remarkably important film, in league with Gone With the Wind, and should be seen for that reason alone- something numbers cannot tell you. It's a story about the injustices done by the rich fat cats at the expense of the poor, and more personally a story of human resilience: that we can overcome lots, but not everything. It's certainly humbling- things can get better but they can also get worse. 8.3/10",8,1,2,12 March 2012
Forrest Gump," Touching- Zemeckis offers another serving of movie magic
","Kids these days don't see the right movies. While teens flock to the latest Transformers or Saw, they neglect the past- even the not-so- far gone 90's. But there's a strange anomaly in that trend... it seems everybody has seen Forrest Gump at one time or another. And after finally grabbing it on Blu Ray, I can say I've joined that rank. Forrest Gump is a fantastic film, and certainly a good one for the masses to see.There's a better chance than not that if you're reading this, you've already seen the film. You probably won't find anything here that you've already heard before. But if you haven't, read on! There are better films than Forrest Gump, but not many, and it is certainly an excellent film to see, arguably mandatory.Forrest Gump is a simple man with a low IQ, born in the 40's. The film follows his life, showing this impossibly innocent man experience some of the most important events of the mid-to-late 20th century. But he doesn't care for any of that: he just wants to be with his girl, Jenny. At its heart, Forrest Gump is a love story set against a historical backdrop.There's a reason the Blu Ray box says 'Tom Hanks is FORREST GUMP'. His performance is mesmerizing, a one-of-a-kind portrayal of a one-of-a-kind role. A southern man with a low IQ, the embodiment of innocence, who describes things in the most innocent way, like 'the loving father who liked to touch her', 'the men who dressed up like ghosts' and other such things the audience understands. And the voice he uses is so iconic and often imitated.But Hanks isn't the only great: the film is host to a group of great characters. There's Jenny, Forrest's childhood friend and love interest. Bubba, Forrest's war buddy and fellow misfit, who knows everything about the shrimpin' business. Lieutenant Dan, as the tragic CO who has quite a journey. And lastly Momma Gump, with her motherly advice and willingness to do anything for her son's education.There's a great feeling to the film. Forrest is such a hero: he does no wrong, he is the underdog from birth. It's not cute or charming, but a heartwarming story of beating the odds. Forrest goes from great scene to great scene, with such greats as football, 'Nam, the hurricane, and the Anti-War rally. With the exception of the Vietnam scene, which is very well handled for such a foreign scene in an otherwise talking-filled movie, the screenplay has wonderful dialogue and a quirky rhythm.A note to those who saw Zumeckis' first great film, Back to the Future. Do not expect more of that. 'Future' was a comedy with drama added, Forrest Gump is a drama with humour added. It's a more mature film,and can take some dark turns, like the 'ice cream' scene. I will draw a parallel to Goodfellas (a good thing). Where Goodfellas shows what the powerful did from the 50's to the 80's, Forrest shows what the everyman (and woman) did during that time. Also, like Goodfellas, Forrest Gump has a fantastic period soundtrack with lots of 'Nam and hippie tunes. Not quite as expansive as the mob film, but excellent nonetheless. Forrest Gump is also more specific: such events as the University of Alabama conflict, Watergate (hilarious) and buying stocks in 'that fruit company' make for some historically accurate humour, one of Gump's greatest strengths.One relationship in particular is fascinating, the main relation between Forrest and Jenny. They start off the same, but go down wildly different paths, one constructive, the other destructive. They are such opposite people, but only Jenny realizes that. It makes the ending much more interesting, and so much more touching to see Forrest question 'if he's smart'. This is one of the most fascinating aspects of the film.This won the Oscar for visual effects, but I didn't see it at first. The effects are very subtle. Like the ping pong ball, the feather, or- WHAT how is he having a conversation with freakin' President JFK? The effects aren't revolutionary, but very effective. I still don't know how they made the conversations with the dead happen.On the back of the Blu Ray is a quote, claiming the film to be a 'tonic of the weary in spirit'. That's the perfect description. Forrest Gump is an uplifting tale of what a single man, even a fictional one, can do with the hand he is dealt. In a decade remembered for its cultural violence (Silence of the Lambs, Seven, Pulp Fiction) Forrest Gump is a beacon of good nature, and good nature is something everyone needs. 9.1/10",9,1,1,13 January 2012
The Godfather: Part II," A continuation of the greatest movie ever made
","IMDb Top 250: 3 The Godfather Part II has a great distinction: it is the sequel to the greatest film ever. It has a lot to live up to. While the Godfather impresses you before it even starts, with Marlon Brando's iconic face on the poster, Part II has to earn your respect. To most, it equals- and to a few, it betters- the Godfather. But to me, it doesn't. Part II is an exceptional film that outclasses many films, but its predecessor is not one of them.The Godfather showed the rise- or fall, however you look at it- of Michael Corleone, and Part II shows him at the height of his power, and his descent. The story is sprawling, like it should be. Betrayal, family, and oranges, Godfather staples, are seen throughout. But Part II doesn't have the charisma of Part I. Without Vito and Sonny, much of the famous Italian factor is lost. Like Michael, the story is more heartless than before.Also in Part II is the origin of Vito Corleone, starring the then small-time Robert de Niro, in one of his best performances. These scenes are so awesome, they steal the show. When we learn about Vito, we don't want it to end, and when we watch Michael, we wish he was Vito instead. There's so much plot in this film, it could've been cut into 2 films, one a continuation and one an origin story, a la the Metal Gear Solid quadrilogy. Who knows the impact that could've had on the quality of Part III.While the film lacks Sonny or Vito, the characters present are very well played. These actors could be these characters in real life. And when Oscar season came, it showed: 5 nominations. Pacino is at his conflicted peak, shown no better than his confrontation with Kay. He is the tent pole: all the other characters aren't on his level, another factor that makes me like Part I more. Others got the spotlight. But as I mentioned before, De Niro is the best part of this film. He sounds like the Don, looks, and charms the the Don. The sets of the 20's scenes are breathtaking. It's a pity there isn't a whole film about him.Together, Godfathers I and II are the best films ever made. But separate, I believe the first part stands alone at the top. Mixing the 20's and late 50's, Part II has much to unravel, and in 3 hours and 20 minutes much is revealed. It's a great film, and one of the best sequels ever made. 9.2/10",9,0,4,17 August 2011
Léon: The Professional," Charming and brutal
","IMDb Top 250: 33I think a big part of why this film was so good is that it could've been so bad. Consider the alternate film this may have been: an icy, one- dimensional hit-man somehow pairs with a bratty young girl to face a drugged police character in this summer's brainmelting blockbuster.But it's not that. It came out as Leon: The Professional.Leon is a special film. It channels classics like Taxi Driver, Batman, and many many New York films but has its own unique identity. Part thriller, part drama, the film is touching and exciting, and reels you in from its stellar first scene and takes you for a fantastic adventure.The story, while having the possibility of being off-putting, works. Sure you can question the relationship between Leon and Mathilda (depending on the cut of the film you saw, I saw the International cut and everything was fine), but I found it more reasonable than say the relationships in Doctor Zhivago and Lolita. Anyway, the story- it's original and takes many turns, but stays on track and never slows without reason.A story only goes so far: the biggest success of Leon is its 3 main characters. Jean Reno IS Leon, I can't see anyone doing any better. As the cold, solitary hit-man who is handed a very different responsibility, we grow to love Leon with his quirky persona of houseplant caring, movie watching and chair sleeping. He is an iconic character with his sunglasses and low voice. His developed duality is remarkable to behold.Leon is complimented by the fiery Mathilda played by the extraordinarily young Natalie Portman, the smoking, swearing kid who grew up with a tough life. As unbelievable as her choices may seem on paper, I totally got behind her reasoning and never found her to do anything horribly distasteful. The duo of killer father and eager daughter is one of the greatest in film.That leaves the sick Stansfield as the target of the duo's revenge. Played by Gary Oldman, one of the greatest actors of all time, the psychotic, pill-popping shady cop is truly despicable, with his scenes of drug consumption and Beethoven rant to be extremely unsettling.The bread and butter of film is great. There are many shots that I found interesting and unique, and the cinematography and editing is all top notch. The music, decidedly the most French thing about the whole film, is juxtaposed to anything happening on-screen and helps make the film's identity, especially in the bonding scenes between Leon and Mathilda.There is a double-edged sword about the film. We see Leon's killer side, and we see him as an awkward caregiver, like in the dress-up game. This mix keeps the audience guessing and keeps the film entertaining. It all culminates in a poetic ending that couldn't be any better or more satisfying.From start to finish, Leon is awesome. It has artistic credibility, awesome action scenes, great characters and acting, as well as the brick and mortar that makes film work. I had never heard of it before seeing the Top 250, and I don't know why it isn't bigger. See this film!9.4/10",9,3,4,26 August 2012
The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring," Awe-inspiring fantasy
","IMDb Top 250: 18 First things first. I have never read the Lord of the Rings books, or the Hobbit. Also, I've always avoided the movies, so I have no idea what the story was about, except for the quest to destroy the Ring. Also, I watched the original theatrical releases.I walked into the greatest trilogy ever without a clue of what to expect. But two days ago I had a marathon: 9 and a half hours of Middle-earth in one day. It was nothing short of incredible.Fellowship of the Ring is an amazing film, and one of the greatest fantasy works ever. Right from the start of the ground-laying prologue, it is apparent this will be a groundbreaking movie, as far as scale and effects go. The first battle, gigantic, simply dropped my unprepared jaw.Fellowship follows Frodo, a hobbit, from his humble home to an adventure bigger than him. It's hard to discuss the plot, because of all the fantasy names. I want you to see this film, and you're wasting your time if you've seen it already because I'm going to gush about it.Frodo's quest offers pure exposition of a fully realized world. Elves, dwarfs and men live together in a medieval society with wizards and dragons. But despite how that may sound, this is not the nerdy fantasy one would expect from such a summary. No spells with silly names are cast, creatures are realistic (or too awesome to criticize), and everything is handled in a mature way.The effects are unrivalled for the time. Orcs look terrifying and convincing, and the CGI monsters look real. Large battles look filled with people, not animations, and places that cannot be real... appear real. Easily a highlight.The characters are well played and mostly fully realized. Frodo, the good soul, is one of the more developed characters, as he should be. Sam is a great companion. Aragorn is awesome. I didn't like Legolas in this one though, he arrived out of nowhere and didn't do too many special things, or explain his presence. I like Gimli. I don't like how he became the comic relief in the later films, but he's great. Boromere is excellent, as the conflicted human. And Gandalf. Wow. Say it with me, the greatest line of the trilogy: 'YOU! SHALL NOT! PAAAAAASS!' That scene is undoubtedly the best of the film, and top 3 in the trilogy.A visual masterpiece, Fellowship is filled with great moments. The opening battle, the wizard confrontation, the Mines (!) and the last battle. Personally, I thought the Ringwraiths were the coolest and most intimidating things. Brilliant.The Lord of the Rings trilogy is a fantastic series, arguably the best ever, and Fellowship starts it off perfectly. You have to see this film eventually, even if you don't like fantasy. 9.4/10",9,0,0,20 August 2011
The Thing," 'MacReady wants the flamethrower!'
","IMDb Top 250: 174 In the year 1982, while all the other films were having a nice party, The Thing was at home, cutting itself up. You've probably heard how gross this film is, but I'll say it again: The Thing is arguably the most visceral film I've ever seen and deserves all of the praise it gets.Praise? What praise? No one liked this movie in '82. But the special effects/ make-up are so disgustingly real, you will feel sick. The creatures are so vile and spectacular it's unsettling. They are real: unlike today's CG monsters, these actors were in the same room with those monsters. It adds to the effect. The Thing was way ahead of it's time; people could be scared of the 30-year-old movie today if they saw it in theatres. (If you like Dead Space, you'll like this.) None of the acting is particularly special, but it doesn't need to be. In fact, a little fleshing out could've helped, maybe during the first half hour. I confused the characters during the film.The plot is very simple, yet very complex. Sure, you can boil the summary into one sentence, but there's much more than that. Where is it from? How did it crash? One could spend a lot of time thinking about the film. The plot moves quickly, and is always interesting. And gross.It's easy to see why The Thing is so well liked today. Ahead of it's time content and a timeless theme of paranoia and uncertainty. Ample gore and tension. Just look at the FAQ page; people are serious about this movie. And it can add me to its fan base. 8.6/10",9,1,2,24 June 2011
North by Northwest," Classic thriller! With a plane!
","IMDb Top 250: 39 'They said I lived a dull life.' says Roger Thornhill, hero of the Hitchcock classic, 'North by Northwest'. And for 2 hours and 11 minutes it's most certainly not true. 'Northwest' is an essential thriller, and one of Hitchcock's best.Cary Grant stars as a Mad Man (advertising agent) who is mistaken for a spy. Things don't go his way, and he becomes wanted for murder too. He goes on the run to find out what's going on, aided by Eve Kendall. Unlike many other thrillers, even Hitchcock's own quintessential 'Psycho', events are set into motion right away. And then you can't let go. There are many twists, some small, some large, but right until the abrupt end, a viewer cannot call this film boring.It starts with the leading man. Cary Grant looks the part of a New York businessman. His surprised expression isn't the most convincing, but his charm is. His chemistry with Eve Marie Saint chemistry makes the dialogue-laden scenes, namely the remarkable train scene, interesting and charming to watch. They're a great couple.Speaking of scenes, Northwest has several notable and famous ones. The aforementioned train sequence, the art auction, and the lunchroom are cute, funny and shocking, but two steal the show. The very famous plains with the cropduster, and the chase on Mount Rushmore. The duster is just so out there it's fantastic, and the most iconic part of the film, and the chase is grand and nailbiting.Worth noting, the title sequence is really cool, and the musical score is fitting. On another note, two things bugged me: *mild spoilers* why Thornhill would pull the knife out and turn to a camera is beyond me and unbelievable- I understand it moved the plot, but Hitchcock's a smart guy, he could've thought of a more reasonable scenario. Also the ending, while involving everything necessary, was very abrupt. We went from danger to 'The End' in less than 10 seconds. But these are acceptable issues in an otherwise outstanding film that as stood the test of time and aged very well. 8.7/10",9,0,0,29 August 2011
The Shining," The greatest horror film ever
","IMDb Top 250: 48Here's the shortest horror story ever: the last man on Earth is alone in a room when he hears a knock on the door. That one sentence provokes so much thought: why is he the last man, what happened to everyone else? What's on the other side of the door? But the most important question raised is: is there something actually there, or was the knocking in his head? That sums up The Shining. A fear of the unknown, the uncertainty in seeing what you do, and having your mind involuntarily the think of terrible things happening offscreen at the Overlook Hotel.The Shining is the best horror film of all time, better than The Thing, Alien, or The Exorcist.This surprisingly straightforward Kubrick tale focuses not a message, but plot, atmosphere and theme. The themes here are isolation and madness. A family has to look after a mountaintop resort alone for 6 months. We're told of the hotel's sinister past and we learn of Tony early, both ominous, planting the seeds of terror laced throughout the film. The great success of the opening act is that plot points and setting are explained, making us familiar without seeming blatantly expository: this works perfectly. We learn as Jack learns.Speaking of Jack, he rules. Every line he says is an instant classic ('Cozy!') due to Nicholson's sarcastic, biting, sinister voice and look. He's such an amazing actor. And we can tell he's a little off right from the start, setting him apart from other 'descent' stories featuring white knights. Lots can be inferred about his character: we learn he hasn't had a drink in 5 months, despite the 'pivotal accident' being 3 years ago. I think my understanding and sympathy for Jack, initially at least, is because I know a Jack Torrence, so you might not be so caring for him. The IMDb FAQ may say his alcoholism isn't a factor in the film, but from his mannerisms and attitude, I can tell you that it is.Other than Jack the whole cast is superb. Wendy (Shelley Duvall) is woefully meek and vulnerable. Big eyed and likable, unlike her husband. I also know a Wendy: these are real characters. Danny is an exceptional character, really well acted, one of the best child performances. Hallorann, Lloyd and Grady (who really amps up the creepy and is possibly the only actor to work with Kubrick on 3 films) round out the impeccable support.Of a good horror film needs to be scary, and I deem The Shining the best. There's no cheap scares with loud bangs. There's no real 'shock' horror, only true eeriness and fear that chills right to your bones. The fantastic music that accompanies the film really adds to the horror, especially the cranking music in late scenes. The horror feels believable because there's nothing computer generated and everything is realistic looking. This makes the line between psychological and supernatural blurry, the key to the whole film. The uncertainty lets your mind wander and create genuine fear. Sure, there's some gore and the most horrifying nudity ever, but most of it is relevant to the story. There are some unexplained elements though, like the 'bear room'.I haven't read the book but I know that the film does leave out several aspects and changes others. The goal of a horror film is to scare the audience, and the Shining scares, creeps and shocks more than any other horror film I've seen. But it also has an excellent story, a haunting atmosphere and amazing acting to compliment these scares. Another masterpiece. 9.4/10",9,0,2,25 May 2012
American Beauty," Middle America in a frame
","Few people will be able to completely uproot their lives and begin it again, but that Lester Burnham's journey in American Beauty: he wipes his hands clean of his pitifully ordinary life and lives life how he wants with his own goals. And to see it is thrilling.Of course there's a little more to it than a hasty decision to turn it around. Several factors converge in this extraordinarily tight drama: Lester discovers his daughter's friend Angela, a 90s Lolita. He also finds his bland job to be on wobbly ground, and lastly he gets new neighbours, a military family with a strange boy, Ricky. These together create a change in the meek Lester and create a magnificent film.The real question I had after seeing this film was: 'What's wrong with American Beauty?' and then I couldn't answer my question. I'll start with the most well- known aspect of the film, its acting. The entire cast is sharp as their respective characters. Led by Kevin Spacey as Lester, original Yes Man ('I rule!'), you will find something relateable in at least one of the characters, good or bad. Their personalities and actions are entertaining, their motives are all there, and if a character is intended to be likable, you will like them. It's just as a good film should be: honest and unforced, but with just an edge to help you in the right direction.I've briefly mentioned how tight American Beauty is. The plot is wonderfully self contained but also organic, it feels very plausible. There's a reason things happened as they did when they did. I can't find any plot holes. Much credit has to be given to the script and writers, and bonus points for being an original idea when so many excellent dramas have 'Based on' in their credits.But more than characters, plot and script, American Beauty is also visually wonderful. While much of it is observed as life is, Lester's fantasies have a brilliantly symbolic and colourful side making them stand out as more than dreams. This leads to the deeper aspects of the film, such as recurring symbols, numerous metaphors (the bag...) and of course the moral.For a film concentrating on failure, I found a very positive message out of the film, and that was to enjoy life and all the beautiful things in it, and to never trap yourself. Like the tag, look closer, find yourself looking past the black and white (into the red?) and see beauty. It all sounds cheesy, but unlike Spacey's later work Pay It Forward, it doesn't come off the screen that way. From a cynic to seizing the day, American Beauty is a dark film with a big smiley face over it that blends until its climax. An engrossing fiction that for many isn't too far from real life, I think this film can speak to people differently as you age, and that power to draw different meanings from different viewings is a sign of a true film. A full film and a fantastic way to close out a millennium. 9.4/10",9,1,2,3 June 2015
Terminator 2: Judgment Day," The 90's Dark Knight
","IMDb Top 250: 42 T2, like it's predecessor, is an awesome action movie. It has a macho hero, a big name director, lots of action and explosions, and is a sequel to a great film. It's a lot like a certain other blockbuster that made lots of money... hmm...If The Terminator was about the idea of nuclear war and a fight against machines, T2 is the 'how' in that idea. Skynet, a computer program will be created, it will think for itself... you should see the movie. It makes us think about our own evolution, and our strive for technical advancement.Arnold is even better here. He's big and tough, but we can really root for him here. Especially with that chopper... Sarah seems nuts, and looks like hell. While some don't like John Connor, I did. His rebellious actions are totally understandable: no father, psycho mother. He added a human perspective to the conflict, and made the Terminator likable.The action (and budget) were better than T1. Chases, gunfights and explosions are intense and pack punch. The SFX, while much better than T1, still look dated, especially bullets on the T-1000 and their 'absorption'. The 2029 scene didn't look much better than T1's, and the ominous feel of doom was gone.The name is kind of strange though: Judement Day isn't really a factor. A name related to Skynet would've been more fitting. Action and sci-fi fans will love this, and despite several gruesome kills with sharp objects, there's wider appeal. 8.6/10",8,0,0,30 July 2011
Duck Soup," Refreshingly light
","IMDb Top 250: 235Well here is a pleasant little surprise of film that one can enjoy anytime. Duck Soup is a brilliant piece of comedy that doesn't demand much thinking, but it itself has brains.What could the plot of a film called Duck Soup be about? War, apparently. And smartasses. And buffoons. Honestly, the best thing you could do to prepare yourself for this film is to not care about the plot because it's not important. The plot practically plays out like an elementary school drama game, where everyone in a circle adds one word and a story is formed. This is not a detriment: the dialogue and actions are the star here.Before this I had never seen a Marx Brother film, so all the ideas here were new to me, and there's a good chance they're new to you. Three Marx brothers (Groucho, Harpo, and Chico) play well-developed serial characters: a smartass, a mute, and an Italian stereotype (the relative 'straight' character) and they're hilarious. Especially since everything else in the film plays like a plain-ol' film, these ridiculous personalities stick out like a sore thumb. Firefly's one-liners and general attitude are a clear precursor to Alvy Singer in Annie Hall, and Pinky's obsession with snipping and flamethrowers is really charming and funny. Here the two pillars of comedy are covered, physical and word. Chico is in the middle, dipping his feet in both ideas.I don't want to spoil any of the gags, but they come fast and often. Maybe even too often, as you'll definitely miss a few. There's not exactly a big commitment here either: the film is just over an hour long, and is as nonsensical as the title from start to finish. I was thinking of World War I allegories throughout, but afterwards I read a comment by Groucho, essentially saying its just for jokes. So be political if you like, but here is a comedy that has as little brain as it has brain. It'll make for a fun hour. 8.3/10",8,1,2,20 January 2012
Apocalypse Now," 'And outside, the silent wilderness surrounding this cleared speck of the earth struck me as something great and invincible'
","I saw Apocalypse Now almost two years ago, before I really got into film. I had previously seen Saving Private Ryan, and loved and respected it. I was in disbelief it wasn't the #1 rated war film on this website, so I sought out Apocalypse Now. I hated it. I hated Apocalypse Now so much. It wasn't boring, and cheesy, or even pretentious- it was just wrong. But over the next few months, something changed, and it really grew on me. And it grew. And eventually I realized: I loved Apocalypse Now. I bought it on Blu Ray, the tremendous 'Full Disclosure', and just saw it again because one of my classes is studying Heart of Darkness.I was right. Apocalypse Now is more than just the greatest war film ever, it is one of the greatest films ever, period. A tower of cinema, an achievement in both the technical and artistic fields.In the Vietnam War, parallelling Conrad's original ideas in Head of Darkness, Cpt. Willard returns to Vietnam and is given an assignment to kill Colonel Kurtz, American war hero. But after the first act, the war is really stripped from the film. Context is established. It's bigger than that.From start to finish every aspect of Apocalypse Now aims for absolute perfection. The opening montage mixes helicopters, Willard's hotel nightmare, and The Doors. Not The Beatles, not the Stones, but the Doors' raw, controversial track, The End. We learn who Willard is, and over a really unnerving tape, about who Kurtz is. Or may be. There are beautiful shots of vast forests and mountains, more intimate walks through the jungle and of the river, brilliant lighting of characters, horrifyingly beautiful sets with hanging bodies, ancient ruins and bizarre alters. The sound quality is without a doubt the greatest in film. Apocalypse Now is more than a film with a plot and an idea, it's an experience. No credits, no titles. Nothing to distract.And in the end, what does it come to? Knowledge, perspective, accidental strength from the weakness of others. What, where is freedom? It isn't spelt out exactly what the intent is, but there are several, and having knowledge of the source material is a huge help.A second chance is one of the biggest rewards I'v ever given myself. To experience Apocalypse Now again, in a new light, is an experience I needed. An amazing piece of art. 9.7/10",10,0,1,20 January 2013
Aliens," So far the only sequel I liked better than the original.
","IMDb Top 250: 60I had some interesting bias going into Aliens. I thought Alien was a good movie (8.2) but I didn't like it too much, but I won't explain why here (I reviewed it). Also, James Cameron directs this film. I hate, HATE Avatar, was underwhelmed by T2, but did enjoy The Terminator. I really liked Aliens.Aliens makes its predecessor seem like an appetizer. Everything in that film existed for the more fleshed-out world of this one. The Alien's brilliant design is actually seen and used here, there's action while keeping tension, and there's a sense of plot development that didn't exist in Alien. This adds up to the best sequel ever in my opinion, and one of the best sci-fi's ever made.57 years after Alien, Ripley is found and learns the planet has been colonized, but contact has been lost. It's strange to think that the other characters look around the same age as her, but could be her grandchildren. However once we get past that, the plot sails. Ripley, with a cast of marines, returns to discover what happened. The drop-off and discovery of the base clearly influenced one of the best levels in Halo. As said before, the film is tense, even with big guns. Once on the planet, it always feels like something is happening. No sitting around.The acting is fitting. Weaver is her strong, female lead character, and gets some great lines. ('Then bill me!') The marines vary from charming to stupid, but have personality, unlike the cast of Alien. There are clichés, like the nervous first time boss, the black, cigar chewing sergeant, the tough Spanish girl, the dopey, big-gun carrying brute, and the smart leader played by Kyle Reese. I mean Michael Biehn. But you aren't watching Aliens as a character study.The second the little girl was found, I thought: 'Oh great a kid.' I hate kids in movies like this. They're baggage. The Walking Dead, Terminator 2, and River's Edge have kids that have to be dragged around or should be punched in the face. But Aliens' girl is different, mixing adorable, innocent, and knowledgeable. One of the best uses of children in mature film.I can think of several series that expanded in sequels- Halo and Riddick, to keep inside the genre. Halo succeeded, Riddick did not. Aliens definitely did, and did it first. Where Halo exponentially expanded lore, and Riddick... went a ridiculous direction, Aliens gives a tight, focused expansion. We see more locations, tech and creatures, and it's interesting and cool.There are some good effects, too. Aliens has aged much better than Alien or The Terminator, even if it is a few years younger. We finally see Aliens for more than a split second, and I think the acid blood was awesomely used. In zombie movies, you ask yourself why the characters aren't infected even when covered in zombie blood. Don't worry about that in Aliens. The facehuggers moving about and the end creature are awesome looking.Aliens has it all. Effects, creatures, action, and a plot. An essential action and sci-fi film. 8.5/10",8,0,3,23 November 2011
The Exorcist," Truly frightening, even 38 years later
","IMDb Top 250: 206The Exorcist stands among greats as one of the all-time most iconic films. Without a doubt you've heard of it, probably in the same sentence as 'scariest ever'. Almost 40 years later, it certainly has aged, but the terror is still there if you want it to be.At first, you'll wonder if this is the right film. The first scene, a long one, is in Iraq, following an unnamed archaeologist or something, digging up a little rock and looking at a statue. By the end it makes sense, and is actually quite relevant, but it's a very obtuse start. In fact nothing really happens until the 30 minute mark, but then it seems someone flips on the 'eerie' switch and it stays that way until the end. The Exorcist has a feeling to it that I have never felt, and it's impossible to describe. It's thoroughly unsettling.The main plot famously follows Regan MacNeil's possession, and a priest who questions his faith. They don't meet for a long time, but the whole film is just buildup for the ultimate confrontation. I bet this would be very rewarding on a second viewing. The characters and their portrayals are a mixed bag. Father Karras(Jason Miller) is excellent as the conflicted young priest who finds himself in over his head with Regan's occupant. He's an excellent character perfectly executed. The other priest, Merrin (Max von Sydow) has very few scenes, but like Hannibal Lecter 20 years later, is an example of quality over quantity. He speaks with his facial expressions, mostly hidden fear. He steals scenes, even if the character isn't as fleshed out as he should've been. Regan's mom Chris is a little shaky though. In some scenes she behaves very understandably, but in others she's very off, like when she receives news of a death. I loved Burstyn in Requiem for a Dream, but not so much here. The director and detective are both underdeveloped, and just sort of appear on screen without explanation.Lastly, the infamous Regan MacNeil(Linda Blair). While it's debated how much she actually acted, the character is amazing. Pure evil in the form of a little girl. That face appears whenever I blink today. If someone asked you who had the power in a room, two grown men or a tied down girl, you would say the men... unless you were watching The Exorcist. The horrifying things she does are so absolutely random and shocking, even today, mixed with that HORRIFYING voice, make one of the greatest 'villains' ever on the screen.Much credit has to be given to the effects and makeup. I wondered how von Sydow hasn't aged in 40 years- he was around 40 when this was made. And Regan's makeup- yikes. But the little things make this, like little noises, and that creepy all-white face that appears from time to time to creep you out with being overly jumpy.What's the film about? I don't really know. The Exorcist certainly dwells on religion, or lack of, and with Regan's medical diagnosis, science versus faith. I think at its cold, empty center it is about true evil versus pure goodness. The Exorcist is an experience- mandatory viewing for all who care about film. It brings one of the best characters, a brilliant song, and a famous poster. It's better than the sum of its parts, brought together as on of the most frightening films of all time. 8.4/10",8,1,2,2 February 2012
Gandhi," What can one man do?
","IMDb Top 250: 183Gandhi is a 4- star film- ignore my gripes, disregard its competition, and forget the score at the bottom. Mohandas K. Gandhi is unarguably one of the most worthy topics of a biopic in all of history, and this film does him much justice. As far as representing a man's life goes, this is top notch.This is a film about the man- his ideas of politics, how to fight, his relationships and then his work. He who would play such a person must be able to live up to his legacy- and Ben Kingsley delivers. One of the greatest performances of all time. The voice, the mannerisms, the walk, the weight loss it completely sells the character. The uncanny resemblance doesn't hurt either: in the TV footage I couldn't tell if they used real news clips or old-style filming. His performance is the best part of the film. What is covered? After a Lawrence of Arabia-like start, the first of several parallels, the film cuts to a 30 year old Gandhi being booted of a train, and we see the beginning of his philosophy. From there there's a fairly smooth telling of his life and accomplishments, with wonderful decoration, costumes, and incredible makeup. It certainly feels like a 3 hour film, but despite being heavy on drama and not action, the film moves well.Being very much centered on Gandhi, very little room is left for support. I maybe caught 3 other characters' names. Also, there are spots where actions don't make sense, and sometimes words too. Also there's the fact that while the film is incredible, lesson-teaching and very well made, other films exist that have done that too while being more *interesting*. Lastly, Gandhi is a worthy story told in the best medium, but the film's proficiency can't change the fact that nothing was added to the film by being made in 1982 as opposed to a decade either way.I think I've touched on all the major points of the film: Gandhi is one of the greatest figures in history, Kingsley is perfect as him and as an actor, and the film is as well made as it possibly could be. Should you find yourself in a position to see this film, do it, but don't expect a particularly fun viewing. 8.3/10",8,1,2,3 September 2012
American History X," One of the best films I've ever seen.
","IMDb Top 250: 38AHX is, in my young eyes, one of the best films ever created. A dark story, brilliantly acted, shown in all its brutality and vulgarity. A film that speaks to everyone: hate is baggage, and change is possible. And AHX has a great story to express that message with. It is truly a modern classic.The most in-your-face part of American History is Derek, played by Edward Norton. Like De Niro in Taxi Driver, he is iconic, or will be in the future. Norton performs incredibly, showing the cruelty and violence of a Neo Nazi, as well as the hurt and sincerity of a changed man. How he didn't win the Oscar with that shaved head and tattoo is beyond me. It's worth seeing the film for him alone...But almost all the other actors are as great, but don't have the part of Derek Vinyard. Furlong, as Danny, is great as the young, developing Derek, who smokes, writes papers on Mein Kampf, but still sticks up for the white kid who gets beat up and has time to give his sister 'airplane rides'. The rest of the family is well played, you can relate to them, and you can feel for them.Only Seth and Derek's girlfriend are hard to watch. Seth is intentional though: he's an urban redneck, blind in his faith. The girlfriend is out of place. How a one-dimensional, trashy girl like that could end up with the ruthless (yet importantly smart) Derek is a little far fetched.The music is quiet, yet important. It has a very American feel to it, and wouldn't be out of place in Saving Private Ryan. During the opening credits, it gives the viewer a feel for what's to come: an emotionally charged film set in their backyard.And it is emotional. The use of black and white in flashbacks is perfect, and slow-mo in important scenes really adds to their emotional punch. You will feel emotions watching this: not sadness, but that might happen, but shame. That snide joke you made to your buddies behind that person's back, that prejudice you thought in your head, well American History X will remind you of that. The plot is well crafted and well told, the flashbacks are placed perfectly, and the pacing keeps things constantly interesting. If you can stomach the infamous scenes and the ample, but necessary language, American History X might just change you as a person for the better. 9.8/10",10,1,2,26 June 2011
The Usual Suspects," Round up the usual suspects
","IMDb Top 250: 25 The Usual Suspects is a great film with a great script, excellent direction, a cool plot and interesting characters. Arguably a neo-noir film (L.A., twisting and convoluted plot that is difficult to follow, crime), 'Suspects' demands your full attention. It's an excellent film.The story is about 5 criminals who are brought together without reason, and try to get back at the police. They are then approached to attack a boat because of debts they didn't know they had. Told through flashbacks, it can be confusing- but intentionally so. The plot is big and interweaving, and unless you're a detective, will demand a second viewing to figure everything out.The 5 characters are mostly awesome. Byrne is great as the conflicted ex-officer, dragged back into crime. Baldwin is charming as the crazy, outgoing MacManus. Del Toro is nuts as the incomprehensible Fenster, The fourth guy is just an extra, I can't even remember his name. But this is clearly Kevin Spacey's movie. He's a magnificent actor. He's definitely the main character though, so his 'Supporting Actor' Oscar is questionable. Maybe he was put in that category to guarantee it.And that's all that's needed to make this film great. Witty dialogue, interesting scenarios and great performances. Suspects is better than the sum of its parts. Some things are under-developed, like the apparent irrelevance of Keaton's 'love(?)' interest. But an exceptional plot, with one of the greatest twists ever that I can't talk about, makes this film a modern classic. 8.9/10",9,0,0,15 August 2011
Gone with the Wind," Excellent yet deceiving
","IMDb Top 250: 154Gone with the Wind is intimidating. Not only is it just short of 4 hours long, it is widely regarded as one of the greatest and most important American films ever created. It's a sprawling story of the South during the Civil War, and was crafted during the time when the world would be plunged into war again. So you'd better like it!Have I mentioned that it isn't at all what I expected? Here I was preparing for a love story set in a difficult time, a match made in heaven torn apart by hell. That's not what played out: most of the morals are stern warnings, and there's very little loving going on. Even the overall plot surprised me, and this is the most important thing one can tell you about the film before you see it: Gone with the Wind is not about Rhett Butler (Clark Gable).That's right, despite Clark's star billing GWTW is about Scarlett O'Hara (Vivien Leigh) and her life, starting with breezy, flirtatious pre-war days, her forced maturing during the tumultuous events and even more so after the fighting has stopped, and then her return to bliss. She is a fascinating character with a contradictious set of morals and a near perfect performance from Leigh, who can capture all the little facial twitches and all the wide emotional changes that Scarlett goes through. She really captures the complex (but is she really?) character of Ms. O'Hara.That's not to say Clark isn't a presence, because Rhett Butler is one of film's greatest characters. Rhett visits from Charleston in a flurry of rumors, and immediately votes against the popular opinion about the war. We love him because he speaks his mind and stays cool-headed, mostly. However he does take the backseat to Scarlett, and has very few scenes without her. GWTW is a greater film than It Happened One Night, but I feel Clark had more to work with in that film, and therefore gives a greater performance. What one can draw from this paragraph is that GWTW is about women and the men who chase after them. It doesn't feel fair having to force the entire support into this little paragraph, but due to size limits I'll have to. Gone with the Wind has a gigantic supporting cast of family members and friends with no weak links, but several very strong ones, like Melanie, Ashley and the award- winning (and deserving) Hattie MacDonald.So now that the acting has been assessed we can continue on to the rest of the film. If Gone with the Wind is not a romance, then what is it? I like to say it is a period drama with romantic elements, because it looks happy on the outside but has some dark material, like abortion. It's not a good date movie, and not just because of the run time. Some say the ending isn't meant to coerce negative emotions, but it did for me. Don't expect to feel too great after.I created a sort of 'Civil War' unit of film, and one of which I saw was The Birth of a Nation. While Birth is more blatantly racist than GWTW, there are similarities. Gone with the Wind works around the negative aspects of the slavery issue and leaves out all the actual battle, as well as totally leaving out the assassination of Lincoln. Also there's two things that bug me, neither of which are really spoilers, but skip this part if you don't want to know ANYTHING. First, Ashley wants to marry his cousin, because 'they are the same blood and understand each other'. Are they the beginning of the 'redneck' culture more terrifyingly seen in films like Deliverance? Rednecks had to come from somewhere in history. This relationship is totally OK with everyone in the film, except for Scarlett. Also, main characters are mildly implied to be in the KKK, which no one has an opinion on. These incidences show that GWTW tries to sugarcoat Southern history. The main conflict here is that the poor Southerners had their peachy way of life uprooted and now can't have their slaves. The portrayal of Southern life is easily the most romantic part of the film.There's no getting around this: a huge part of the picture's success is that it is in colour. All the way back in 1939, the colour brings forth the beauty of the land, sets, and costumes. It was a worthy endeavour making this in colour: a 4 hour black and white film would be agonizing, especially considering this material. It would be a shame no to get to see the costumes in their true form.Lastly we'll discuss the thematic value. Most of them revolve around Scarlett, but the point of this film is plot, not morals. The title gives away the first idea communicated. The old carefree south is gone with the wind, quickly uprooted. The film (and book) try to make you feel for these poor Southerners, who I already mentioned were slave owners. There is clearly bias in this film. We also learn that money isn't happiness, a moral taken from The Great Gatsby, and it may be a coincidence but F. Scott Fitzgerald helped write this film. Adding to that, if you are never content you may be left with nothing- all cynical messages. There's just one that Gone with the Wind really pushes, and that is that only your land is constant: that's what Scarlett learns.It was amazing feat creating this film, which one notable critic claims to be 'a towering landmark of film'. You can't put it any better than that. It's very good, not one of the very best, but should be mandatory viewing for its historical significance and reputation. Just don't expect a politically correct history lesson or a happy ride. 8.7/10",9,0,0,23 February 2012
No Country for Old Men," A very different film
","IMDb Top 250: 123 If you read the user reviews for this film, the majority are either 1's or 10's. No Country for Old Men is a very love/hate film. You either get it, or it sucks.Following a man who finds $2 million dollars, the man who wants to find him, and the men who want to find the second man, there are many stories told with different frames of mind. A survivalist, a cold blooded killer, and the level-headed lawman who finds it hard living in that day and age. The plot has issues, like how the killer can always find his man. You have to put pieces together and make assumptions.No Country for Old Men is beautiful. Gorgeous long shots of the Texan land are a treat. The first act is breathtaking.I can't lie, it was hard to understand the accents. But the dialogue is clever, with a several laughs, helpful for such a serious film. There's practically no music, and in the odd case it exists you don't even know it.Javier Bardem is terrifying as the psychotic Anton Chiguarh. His spaced-out face and weird hair make his presence unnerving, as well as his iconic cattle gun. Very deserving of his Oscar.Then there's the ending, so spoilers from here. I hated the end, and thus the film, when I first saw it. But now I realize that the point is, like the tagline, there are no clean getaways. Sometimes the bad guys do get away, sometimes the hero does die. That differentiates No Country for Old Men from the vast majority. While the very end is anti-climatic, if you can accept something different, you'll come to appreciate the ending.No Country for Old Men is excellent. A great technical film, beautiful and brutal with great performances and an ending not seen very often awaits. I can't say it's the Best Picture, as I liked There Will Be Blood better, but a very worthy candidate. Have an open mind. 8.3/10",8,6,9,18 September 2011
Batman Begins," Wow: shoulder to shoulder with its sequel
","IMDb Top 250: 114I saw Batman Begins when I was maybe 11. I don't remember all of it, but damn did I like it. A few years later I got to see The Dark Knight in theaters, and that was incredible. Now poor Batman Begins is in the shadow of its sequel, but its really a matter of taste: I don't like to use superlatives, but Batman Begins is arguably the best comic book film to date.Christopher Nolan has created a world where the fantasy elements of Batman have been removed, and the result is a fairly realistic tale. A dark one. The Dark Knight cruised with the success of this, but Batman Begins had to prove itself. It's a very 'charged' film, always rocketing forwards.You know the story: as a child, Bruce Wayne watched his parents gunned down in front of him, and he resolved to fight crime in Gotham. This film, through flashbacks, shows that happen, and just how Bruce Wayne became Batman. There's a line towards the end of 'It's A Wonderful Life' that Mr. Potter says. He says, 'You're worth more dead than alive!' and that is what pushes George towards his actions. The same is used here. Throughout Wayne's learning, small things are said that are instantly recognizable as Batman concepts, like being fear and using deception. The only issue with the film is that it can be sloppy during this section, and things aren't completely clear. But after that, and it's all necessary, we see man become legend.Do you know what would've ruined the whole idea? If Batman returned and fought a supervillain like Mr. Freeze. Instead, Batman tackles a far more realistic threat, mob boss Cameron Falcone. The scene where we first meet Batman at the docks, and his announcing of it, is absolutely amazing. There is also Scarecrow and Ra's Al Ghul, both realized in a realistic light. And in one of those cases, a very scary one.The cast of Batman Begins is incredible. Christian Bale, a man of variety, stars as the double-edged man, a socialite and businessman by day and hero by night. Not many people can be Batman, and Christian is one of them. He shares a family-like bond with Alfred, his butler, perfect for Michael Caine. Other great support comes from Liam Neeson, Morgan Freeman, Katie Holmes and Cillian Murphy, who is brilliant as Jonathon Crane. The casting is perfect.The film wouldn't work without its amazing music, one of the greatest ever. It pumps you up like none other. When Batman walks down the hall, bats flying around, and the overture swells, goosebumps result. Matching that, the film is shot in an exciting way, and is edited and all that technical stuff with care.It's all the little things that make this magic. Like the origin of the Bat signal, to a cameo by Zsasz and the tease of an ending, Batman Begins comes together perfectly, much better than the sum of its parts. It may seem like a brainless blockbuster, but more than most superhero films, you can take a little something away: change needs something to start it, even if its not a man in a suit, and more specifically to this film is that there are people who do good that aren't seen, and don't get credit. Not the deepest of morals, but there are some good themes present- a surprising amount.In conclusion, Batman Begins is unfairly left behind The Dark Knight. It has a better sense of purpose, a quicker pace, and for me, a more preferable tone. Each of the Batman films have different vibes, so you should see both to find out which you like better. 9.2/10",9,0,1,24 January 2012
Lawrence of Arabia," In the desert...
","IMDb Top 250: 54Continuing my David Lean unit, I devoted an afternoon to watching Lawrence of Arabia: one of the most iconic, legendary, and celebrated films of all time. Widely regarded as Lean's masterpiece, I was really excited: The Bridge on the River Kwai exceeded my expectations. The number one 'Epic' movie according to the AFI, I expected a roaring tribute to success, an aura of victory and grand scale, and lots of sand. I got 2 of those.Lawrence of Arabia follows Lawrence's life during World War I, with one scene after his death. Right from the start there's something different about the film: for 4 minutes, there is no picture, only sound- the overture prepares you for the atmosphere of the desert, and for the nearly 4 hour journey ahead. The first scene is very interesting, and anyone who knows any history won't consider it spoilers: after his crash, the viewer objectively sees Lawrence's funeral. There, reporters ask people about him, and they call him a great man- but almost none have actually met him. By showing his funeral first, a viewer doesn't fear for Lawrence's safety throughout the film: we can focus on his character and his actions.From there, there is a hard cut to many years previous, and the adventure that is the middle eastern theatre of WWI begins. The Middle East is an interesting setting, virtually unexplored by Western film. In this film, we see enough of it to make up for the deficiency. We also learn about the belligerents of the conflict, Arabs who unite to displace the Turkish, who Lawrence describes as 'silly people' who will be small until they can stop arguing between their tribes.Lawrence had a fascinating life that makes for a great story, but it's good that we only see the WWI section of it: the film couldn't be any more sprawling without losing all cohesion. The film takes its time, and that's something critical to a viewers enjoyment of the film. We see Lawrence trekking through the desert a lot. The length of the film is quite daunting, but it never feels slow, because of the sweeping scenery and fantastic soundtrack. The pace is like a jog: it never really quickens, even in battle, but there's always the sense that movement is happening.Arabia jumps from scene to scene like a roller-coaster. There are sequences of talk, then walking through the desert, then a battle, followed by talking... it covers all the bases. Great scenes include Ali's entrance, Aqaba, and the massacre (a surprisingly dark scene). For such an epic film, I expected more depth to the battles. They are skimmed over, and one key fight isn't even shown at all!If there's one thing I've learned so far from this unit, it's that David Lean can shoot a beautiful film. Lawrence of Arabia has the most stunning photography, I dare call it the perfect visual film. Be it desert in every direction, canyons, huge camps, horses charging to a city, or just the sun, this has the most massive scale in film. It's a shame, and one cannot stress this enough, that this film as of December 2011 does not exist on Blu Ray.Equal to the visual is the audio. The music is perfect for the desert, with a sweeping band playing the overture that has middle eastern flair. The sound effects are brilliant, like the wind, explosions, or even the sound of the heat of the sun.Lean does a very good job of directing. This film has a marginally larger scale than Bridge on the River Kwai, but loses the focus that film had. However, as your teachers once taught you, quantity does not equal quality, and in this case, grand does not instantly equate to great: I can't just love the movie because it's so big.Finally, the acting. Unless you live under a rock, Lawrence's portrayal, and his character in general, is legendary. In his tour-de-force, Peter O'Toole (I was shocked this was his first major film) portrays the outspoken and impulsive Lawrence. His motives are complicated, he is a difficult to understand person. *******SPOILERS FOR A 50 YEAR OLD MOVIE******* Over the course of the film, he develops, at first for the better, but then he deteriorates. His ego gets the better of him, and he finds himself in a terrible situation. This situation, in which he is implicitly raped, is far too vague, even for the 60's. What makes that worse is that it is a key part of his development, and would be far easier to understand if even a small visual cue was added. In the end, he goes home dejected, a failure to himself, despite being a hero of the people. This is a central theme I picked out, which is the myth vs. man. Ironically,the whole film represents that theme. Perhaps things happened Lawrence didn't write about, and we see only the good and (perhaps) relatively bad. ***END SPOILERS***The film has good support, but it is clearly O'Toole's show. You can learn a lot about someone through their interactions, and the point of the film is to learn about Lawrence. Hence, Sharif Ali is Lawrence's closest friend. We see their initial conflict, gaining of respect, and relationship. Through Ali, we see when Lawrence's fragile mental state is apparent.Where Bridge on the River Kwai was about the waste of war, this is about the glory of war- until it's not. As Lawrence says, 'Nothing is written', sadly ironic for the passionate young man.I don't think a film like this will ever be made again. Not at this scale, not at this length. Unlike many biographical films, LoA leaves in the true ending, with his rise and fall. Despite the unhappy end, Lawrence of Arabia is a spectacle of cinematic achievement. 9.1/10",9,1,3,29 December 2011
City of God," A gut-wrenching look at Brazilian street crime
","City of God shows the evolution (and de-evolution) of Brazilian favelas from the sixties to the eighties. It follows Rocket's turbulent life, and Ze's descent, as well as showing a few other characters and places stories.A big part of City of God's success is it's style and atmosphere. Actors pulled from the streets, Portuguese dialogue and nearly- on- location filming make City of God a sickening look at urban violence.The story is incredible. Starting with the main character's older brother's shenanigans in the 60's, we see life around Rocket change with the times. While America thought of Vietnam, Brazil thought of partying and drugs. It's interesting to see a different perspective of the world, and that's certainly a reason this film is so high on the 250. If this was the same film, but about LA gangs, it probably wouldn't be so high.Technically, the film is great. Swooshing camera-work looks awesome, and the entire apartment scene is amazing. The cinematography of the opening scene is really something.City of God is a great foreign film that should be seen for its exposition of slum life. It's well paced, perfectly told, and has a satisfying ending. And it's true. 8.8/10",9,1,3,28 July 2011
Django Unchained," Al dente
","In many ways, Django Unchained is very similar to Inglourious Basterds. They both are derived from European B-movies and are set in times where the world wasn't on the top of its game. But whereas Basterds worked precariously around the mass armed conflict at the time, Django fires six shots into the heart of the issue that has generally been turned away from in cinema: slavery. And where Basterds was a decidedly more dramatic film with only small bits of humour, Django is usually less serious but with select instances of pure pain. In a year of blockbuster disappointment, Django Unchained stands tall and free, delivering almost 3 hours of cinematic goodness.Right from the first frame it's apparent that there's another very important influence on this film, and that is the spaghetti western. From the font of the opening titles to the throwback theme songs, Django is a movie about slavery with the style of a certain Italian filmmaker. This 'neowestern' as I shall call it doesn't contain long stares in ghost towns, but has plenty of shooting and flair. And with a name like Tarantino's attached, you know it's getting the double dose of brutality.I mentioned earlier the humour is more apparent than in Basterds. The shootouts are ridiculous, the characters zany, and it's always a pleasure to hear Samuel L. Jackson saying m*****f*****. I want to especially point out the scene with the KKK for being especially hilarious, and the audience agreed with me that Django is fairly light considering how the topic could be taken. But, like the famous 'How am I funny?' scene in Goodfellas, the South as it is often presented to us in films such as Gone with the Wind (for the record, this film affects my opinion of that one negatively) is quite ridiculous. Sure, we can laugh at the old white folks being astonished to see 'a n**** on a horse', but things like that happened. People were horrible and slavery was one of the great abominations in human history. And on two occasions, like Tommy deVito, Tarantino drops the facade. Two scenes that still play in my mind, gut-wrenching scenes highlighting the cruelty of man. Django Unchained is violent, but only in these two scenes is it truly disturbing.But after the scenes hit home the dresses get put back on and you are graciously welcomed to Candyland again. The writing is expectedly top notch, able to return to a warm place after unflinching brutality. The dialogue is laden with profanity and wit, complimenting the action scenes for a very briskly paced film that feels much shorter than its 2 hours 45 minute runtime. The characters tentpole the film though. Django, the slave reborn as a vengeful killer, has all the style, moves and flair of a gunslinging hero. Although it's his name in the title the film belongs to DiCaprio and Waltz. Leo's Calvin Candie is a despicable man who relishes what he does, and leaves all traces of prettyboy hero Leo at the door. And Waltz as the bounty hunter Dr. Schultz is a quirky and good natured man. I think it's the beard. Very much unlike his last role in a Tarantino film.Samuel L. Jackson plays a curiously loyal house slave though character is never really fleshed out, and though he gets a lot of great lines his presence feels a bit off. Likewise, Django's wife Broomhilda gets very little to say despite being the subject of the film's quest. She was mostly just... there.Without a doubt Tarantino's films are incredible, movie lovers' movies. And Django Unchained is no exception- little references and unmatched style make a fantastic ride. But a problem that I have with them is depth. The only message that is really taken away is that slavery was brutal, but that isn't really treading new ground. The characters also see little development: Django goes from an angry slave to an angry hunter and Candie's is a functioning monster the whole way through. Only Schultz really changes and it's great to see, so I wonder why he didn't give Django any more transition. Nonetheless, Tarnatino and Western fans won't be disappointed by this, one of the best films of the year. 8.7/10",9,2,9,27 December 2012
Drive," West-side Taxi Driver
","I'll get it out of the way quick: Drive is the best movie of the year. And while the new decade is young, it definitely belongs on the 'Best of Decade' list too. Drive mixes quality filmmaking and modern flair, which reflect off each other perfectly. Drive has it all: action, drama, romance, suspense, and charisma.Drive follows a man who lives around cars. He works in a garage, does stunts, and is the getaway driver for criminals. We never learn his name. Ryan Gosling is the Driver, and he's great. Driver is quiet, and content to be quiet. A true professional, thinking only of his work. For the most part, Gosling is subtle. His getaways are done plain-faced, and he doesn't show emotion when meeting new people. But we see a more emotional side of him with Benicio, and every so often a violent side, but more on that later. Down the road, one could see this as Gosling breakout role/performance.The plot is fairly conventional: crime gone wrong. In the middle there is a bit of noir, with too much information exposed. But everything wraps up well- it doesn't close off his story completely and we can make up our own minds about what happens after.This film has many parallels to Taxi Driver, and originally I wanted to expand on that, but it would contain spoilers so I decided against it.If you expect an action film, turn around. Drive is a drama with action scenes. As other reviews have said, action happens when the story calls for it, not because the story needs action. There aren't many chases or killings, but the chases are heart- pounding. And the violence is brutal. Like the Godfather (always a comparison you want a film to relate to) the violence is sparse, but when it comes it comes BIG. Two scenes in particular are jaw dropping, and *minor spoilers* the elevator scenes will become known as 'that scene in Drive', in my opinion the highlight of the film, with juxtaposition of the two extremes in the film, love and hate *end spoilers*.Speaking of love, Gosling and Carey Mulligan share a nice romance. They speak with small movements, and barely speak. Body language is the name of the game here. Add in Benicio, the son, and you have a family here that is tender to see.Drive is backed by several great supporting characters. Bryan Cranston, a favourite of mine, is the good- hearted but cash-hungry Shannon, the Driver's friend and partner. Ron Perlman is the hilarious Jewish Italian gangster wannabe, whose description of a nice car is unbelievably funny. And Oscar Isaac is great as the ex-con who actually isn't a caricature.Include a few sweet synth songs and great cinematography, Drive is a fantastic modern film that is necessary viewing. I hope it receives some Academy love, it deserves it. You'll probably love it. 8.8/10",9,3,7,11 October 2011
The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers," The middle one
","IMDb Top 250: 30 The Lord of the Rings: the Two Towers continues the epic story that began in Fellowship of the Ring. We meet new characters, develop others, and see epic battles.There is such a phenomenon in film called 'Middle film syndrome' or something of the sort. It means that in a trilogy, the middle film is the weakest because it isn't exposition like the first film, or conclusion like the third. The Two Towers is a perfect example of this concept. The awe of Fellowship isn't present, and the finish of Return of the King doesn't happen, leaving... the middle.I'm not trying to say Two Towers is a bad film. But compared to the other Lord of the Rings films, it is. They're AAA, Towers is AA. The characters introduced, like the King and nephew in Rohan, are thrown into the story without a reasonable introduction. The battle for Helm's Deep isn't that spectacular. Humour is misplaced. Even the films colour is wrong. Some of these factors can't really be fixed, because of the books, but some of them should've been dealt with.There are still some great parts of Two Towers. Gollum is nuts, batty and crazy. His presence helps Frodo and Sam's scenes, which don't actually go anywhere. The Dead Marshes are creepy. Ringwraiths return- on new mounts. And the tree battle, the only epic scene in the movie.Most of my problems with Two Towers are that the scale is diminished, no scenes other than the battle at Isengard leave the viewer in awe. The battle for Helm's Deep was also... not great. The sides weren't even close to being reasonable, making the result unbelievable. The colouring of the last battle made it seem very dark and bleak, but Gimli became a walking joke and Legolas rode a shield/surfboard. Clashing themes. The orcs didn't have anything special in that battle to make the battle interesting. In a series with groundbreaking battles, Two Towers came up short.The Two Towers is a good film, but a mediocre Lord of the Rings film. If for some reason you see it before the other two, the others are far better. Not much else I can say, you're either in it for all 3 or not in it. Fear not, Return of the King is the strongest, a worthy finish of your time. 8.3/10",8,1,2,21 August 2011
Dog Day Afternoon," The Dog Days of the 1970's
","IMDb Top 250: 180Dog Day Afternoon is a unique film. It's a heist movie, but a special kind of heist movie. There are no gritty stand-offs; this is a smart, tell-it-like-it-was kind of film, and it can seems a little silly at times. That's because it actually was silly at times. The summary almost reads off like the start of a joke: 'So a gay man walks into a bank...' In real life, Sonny (real name John) robbed a bank to pay for his lover's sex change operation. I won't spoil anymore, because spoiling the truth is spoiling the movie. The direction is perfect. The tone of the film is almost light-hearted: Sonny fumbles his gun, one crook cracks... it reminds me of Goodfellas in a sense that while not being funny, you can't help but smile.A big part of this is Sonny. Al Pacino, in one of his best (unfortunately underrated) roles, play the rookie bank robber AMAZINGLY. When you look at great actors, it's easy to say 'Oh yeah, he is the character, he's real good' but here it's incredible. His eyes, facial expressions, the way he walks and talks, its an absolute sell. You feel for him, all he wants is to help someone he loves but things just went to #%@*. He's the best part of the film. Everyone else does their job, but are unfortunately in the same movie as Al Pacino. Sal isn't a lovable guy, he's kind of dumb (Wyoming) and a follower. He could've been fleshed out a little more.One thing of interest is the crowd. If you are like me and like to know NOTHING going into your films, skip this paragraph. If you've done even a little reading, you know Sonny is gay. I did not, which is why it was a little surprising, but then not: he subtly conveys it throughout the film. I found it interesting to see the crowd's love of Sonny before the reveal, including the small things like flipping off the officers, as well as cheering for him. But after they learn, there's more subtle movements: you can here 'He's a queer?' in an offensive tone, as well as see members of the crowd doing a 'package-grab' gesture in the background as Sonny pats down the FBI agent. Seeing this in 2011, it's an interesting time capsule, seeing the social norms of the 70's towards a gay man. He's a hero if he's straight, but just a gay man if he's gay.Dog Day Afternoon is a really good film, highlighted by great directing and a very strong lead that makes everyone weak in comparison. It's also a time capsule to when things were different, in the long-ago time of... the 70's. 8.3/10",8,0,1,17 June 2011
Amadeus," Inspired
","IMDb Top 250: 82After you've seen a few, biopic can become fairly repetitive. They show a scene or two about the topic's childhood, the show a few moments that craft the subject's character, show the breakthrough, optional fall from grace, and death. The film is linear, well made and wins some Oscars..But here's Amadeus, a film that could've easily dropped the more interesting aspects of the play and done a linear narrative. But it keeps the perspective of Salieri, long after the action takes place, in the asylum. That adds a whole layer to the film. Also, not having the camera follows Mozart's every move shows that even in his prime, a composer isn't the center of the world. Amadeus is an impossibly lavish film: like the similarly timed- Barry Lyndon, costumes and makeup are luscious, and the sets and decorations are grand. The opera scenes are incredible. Visually and technically, the film is marvellous.Then we get into the characters. The film focuses on the one-sided clash between jealous Salieri and childish Mozart. It makes the film more interesting than simply showing Mozart's life. I found the clash relateable: there's always someone who's better than you at anything, though they may not be the eccentric Mozart is.I found it wrong that everyone speaks in a plain English accent, while making reference to 'our language, German'. Also the film runs long, longer than it could have. And lastly, I don't know what to get out of it. The end is quite nihilistic. Mediocrity. You lose. But they can't spoil one of the best biographical films ever. 8.3/10",8,1,2,20 September 2012
Patton," Guns of a patriot OR The American King's Speech
","IMDb Top 250: 232Everyone like my MGS4 reference? Good. Patton is a great movie, deserving of it's praise. Scott's performance is great, from his walk, sneer a voice (which is allegedly not what Patton sounded like). He is the best part of the film. It's a shame they went for the PG rating, as I heard the real Patton had a foul mouth that is almost completely cut from the film.I usually cannot comment on scenery, but Patton is a film of art. Huge scenes are filled with interesting objects, and the camera-work maximizes this effect. Battles and towns are beautiful to look at, and make me wish I had seen the Blu Ray instead.I understand the point of the plot focusing on WWII, but maybe a little back story about him could've been added, maybe showing his rise. The film was lo enough, it wouldn't have hurt to add extra time.It's strange the film is PG, the f word is used once and there are two random scenes of gore: a man with a hole through him and a man with no leg, shown graphically. They seem unnecessary in this film, about the management, not the horror of war.One of the best movies about war ever made, Patton should be seen by cinemaphiles, war fanatics, or people interested in the man. 8.4/ 10",8,0,1,26 June 2011
Children of Men," 28 Days Later without the zombies
","IMDb Top 250: 221That is what comes to mind when I watched this movie, and that's a very good thing. Alfonso Cuaron has created a very believable future in this original and unique movie.From the beginning, this is a film like few others. It successfully creates a weighty atmosphere, where everything is necessary. The people in the coffee shop aren't extras in Theo's way, they're concerned civilians. Ads aren't there to create an urban feel, they let you know about the situation. And the gunfights and explosions make you feel right in the scene, something few other films can accomplish.In an unsettling way, this vision of the future is nervously close. Small technological advancements have occurred, but this isn't the Jetsons. It seems like this scenario could happen next year, which puts the thought in your mind, 'Could something like this happen?' As said before, the plot is original. No babies, no kids, no future. But there is one, and it's up to Theo to bring her to safety, with obstacles on the way. With the adventure-for-safety plot, the scary future Britian, and a very realistic shooting style, you can see the similarities with 28 Days Later.Two issues with the plot: one, I'm not sure if I missed it (the talking is awfully quiet) but I don't quite know what the 'Fish' organization is fighting for. Until we learn about what they did to a major character, there's no reason to think they deserve to be called terrorists. Second, and this is only my opinion, but I thought the film ended too soon, without a chance to see what the future brings. Some might like that, I found it a little cheap. How can one birth change fertility worldwide? I can see Alfonso didn't want to delve into the science of it all, but maybe some explanation would make a very good plot great.Clive Owen does a great job, maybe his best, as the chauffeur-for-hire to protector of the future hero type. He was well casted as the modern, rough around the edges guy trying to get by.The direction here is phenomenal. The camera shots successfully make you feel the tension and danger of apocalyptic Britian. The entire scene from the Russian shelter to the dock was amazing, as well as the car ambush.Overall, Children of Men succeeds in telling its story of hope, while making you think of our own fragile future. With likable characters, thrilling moments and amazing realism, Children of Men is one of the best movies of the new millennium. 9.0/10",9,2,6,12 June 2011
The Dark Knight," The Escalation of the Comic Book Movie
","IMDb Top 250: 10There's a very good chance you've already seen The Dark Knight. It's very accessible: take one of the greatest superheroes of all time, add his archnemesis, one of the greatest modern directors, and few ties to its predecessor, and you'll come out with money. Over $1,000,000,000 of them. But behind all the hype, all the cash, and all the controversy (This film was successful only because Heath died!), you're left with one of the best films of the last decade, and the film that justifies comic book films to critics, non-believers and nay-sayers. Batman Begins was a revelation, but The Dark Knight elevates comic book films to more than a niche.Most series stumble with the sequel; no origin story means that other things need to fill in the first hour or so. But The Dark Knight barrels through that crippling problem: it's a completely new arc from Batman Begins, so new viewers aren't missing much. Right off the bat (oh ho ho) we're thrown into the action: the prologue follows a group of Clown-masked bank robbers and how their selfishness destroys them, and then reveals The Joker to be behind it all. The prologue is amazing, and sets the tone for the whole film: grim, and not completely focused on Batman. What follows is a dark look into psyche and morality, how good can be corrupted, and how absolute chaos can engulf even the most righteous of beings. The themes are layered and complicated, and not the most relatable for the average viewer, but extraordinarily well-handled.The acting is perfect again: Christian Bale is even more two-faced than Dent, magnifying his ignorance as Wayne and his intimidation as Batman. He does like to jump from playboy to inspired though, often in Dent's presence, making an ass of himself one second then kissing it the next. Alfred (Michael Caine) returns again as Bruce's mentor, offering a few stories to help Wayne think, and providing a nurturing hand when needed: and it is needed. Harvey Dent (Aaron Eckhart) is also a key player, and his entire character is ironic right from the start: we know what will eventually happen. But his acting skills are there, showing the descent from Gotham's white knight to something else entirely, something different from the comics. This character is remarkably frightening, but is placed in a tough spot: he has to play second fiddle to the Joker, and is certainly underused. His revenge ends too soon, but at the same time it couldn't go anywhere else without changing the ultimate resolution. But for what we do get, Dent is excellent and has a great gradual (then sudden) development.Being second fiddle to anything is unfortunate, but Two-Face had to live in the shadow of the Joker. It's indisputable, Joker is the greatest Batman villain, and his turn in The Dark Knight is one of the best. The late Heath Ledger gives the ultimate performance, cumulating in a much deserved Oscar that breaks new ground for comic book acting. His Joker is everything you've heard: unpredictable, unnerving, and scary. Just his visual appearance is creepy, but with his voice, little movements, twisted sense of 'humour' and general style, he's the most frightening Joker ever and gives Batman an adversary that forces him to rethink his entire concept of justice. A very deserving portrayal.From start to finish The Dark Knight is filled with memorable scenes of action and dialogue. The parking garage, the escort chase, the sickening, heart-wrenching choice and the finale all show why Batman is the ultimate badass, and anytime the Joker opens his mouth it's pure gold. The film constantly is moving forwards, but feels slower than it is. Nolan took his time to create an epic-length masterpiece.Simply, The Dark Knight is technically supreme. It has an incredible dark art design, a shift from Batman Begins' orange tone to this blue tone. This lighting is notable, with effects such as Two-Face's good side in view only, or especially The Joker's white face being the only thing on screen, like the devil in the Exorcist. The film was amazing to see and hear in theatres and on Blu Ray. I love the IMAX: fullscreen action with remarkable detail, although it does lead to very slightly annoying jumps in aspect ratio. The sound is sweeping, the SFX brilliant: the musical score is great again, although used less frequently and without the main theme, although this shows that the film is less about Batman.The Dark Knight is a perfect expansion for this mythos. It's jaw- dropping, and in my opinion the greatest sequel of all time, maybe in a close race with The Empire Strikes Back but that's just me. My only worry is that The Dark Knight Rises won't be able to top it, and I have no clue how they will be able to do so. 9.3/10",9,3,6,12 February 2012
Annie Hall," All they do is give out awards!
","IMDb Top 250: 136I am unqualified to write this review.I'll elaborate. This is my first Woody Allen film. Film starts. Title. Credits on a black background, no effects. No music. And then Woody, talking directly to us about him, with a rich, varied and intellectual use of the English language. Like a great book, Annie Hall demands your full focus to analyze and understand just what is being said. Recently the thought that I want to be a writer has popped into my head, and no one does writing, directing and acting better than Woody Allen.Annie Hall is about the relationship between cynical Alvy and ditzy Annie. While the film is a rom-com, it's more of a rom-com*. The * is because it's darkly funny, and the level of romance goes up and down like a roller-coaster. It's very honest, there's no closed doors in our viewing of the relationship.Annie Hall came very close to getting the Oscar Big 5, only losing the Best Actor, and while I haven't seen the winner, it must've been a good contest. Of the 3 films to achieve this, I think Annie Hall would be the most deserving. Allen and Keaton are believable and lovable. Allen's directing is superb, with tricks I was floored by. As said before, the writing is rich and so... complete, all coming together in a grand package. Also funny to note, the quote I used, Alvy's description of LA, is ironically fitting to the film it's from.Several things are worth noting. The 4th wall is broken, a lot and it's perfect. How many movies do you wish the main character would just stop and tell you what he's thinking? My favourite example is the movie theater line, where Alvy verbally dismantles the man behind him in line, even making one of the topics appear (it's fantasy). Other fantasies include Alvy asking random people on the street what happened to his romance. I personally love his references to all kinds of things, even if I didn't get some of them: I do that myself. Lastly, one scene has subtitles, and I had to shake my head and rewind. It was brilliant.Lastly, the setting. Annie Hall is a New York film, except when they stop in LA twice. Alvy Singer is a New York guy, and he feels very uncomfortable in such a foreign place. Only after did I realize what a great job the film does of making New York feel like home. The scenes in LA were UNBEARABLE. I haven't loved hating something so much.Annie Hall was surprisingly good, and far smarter than I expected. An all-around AAA film that is relatable, comforting and charming, all in 90 minutes. 9.2/10",9,0,0,9 December 2011
2001: A Space Odyssey," Expand your horizons
","IMDb Top 250: 88I don't think it would be fair to 2001: A Space Odyssey to write down my thoughts before formulating a review as I usually do. 2001 is such an expressive film that to do anything but just let the words come out would go against its existence. Evolution is the plot of A Space Odyssey. Told in distinct movements, we first see the moment when ape turned into man. Jump to space exploration, where we aren't quite yet: and finally, the future, well outside our hand or mind's grasp. Only one of these movements has a true 'plot', and I'm sure you know what it is. 2001 is slow. Ice melting slow. Dialogue is sparse, action almost non- existent. Only when each segment is done can you begin to understand it, and only after the final conclusion, if you can call it that, can one even begin to try and piece together the meaning. But that is the ultimate reward: a truly thought provoking film, one of the greatest of all time, one of the most influential pieces of culture and one of the most notable contributions of film.Visually there will never be another film like this. Everything is real, or at least not computer generated. But everything looks so convincing. The ships in space, the planets reflecting light, the sun, the ape people, the magnificent space station sets- I have no clue how this film was made. I can't even begin to guess.But 'awe inspiring' is certainly a characteristic of this extraordinarily futuristic space epic.But 2001 isn't content to just be a feast for the eyes, it's also a unique treat for the ears. Music is exclusively classical, led by the iconic Also Sprach Zarathustra. Dialogue is minimal, as well as sound effects: there's no sound in space (the scientific accuracy is remarkable). The film is bookended by 25 minutes of dialogue free enlightenment.The acting is not legendary, but is exactly what it needs to be: a medium for a directors vision. Of course there's HAL, a prime example of the dangers of dependency and legendary villain. Anyone who likes Portal knows where the influence is from. But Kubrick is the true star: some films are great no matter who runs them, but 2001 is entirely Stanley's project and fittingly his (arguably) crowning achievement. What does it all mean? I don't know. I won't pretend to know its true intent. I don't think it has one. It all depends on what you believe. What I got out of it is that we are in a race with ourselves to find our role in the universe, and with the uncertainty of alien life we can't be sure where the finish line is. Also, care must be taken with machines or anything else we don't understand. It's also an examination of our species thus far, as well as an educated and psychedelic look into our future. Little things will come up, and I've already used 2001 as a basis for certain beliefs I hold that are totally irrelevant to the film. You will think something different, but the fact that so much thought can come from 2 and a half hours of fiction is astounding.One of the great uses of film as a medium, in every sense. 9.5/10",10,0,2,24 April 2012
The Graduate," You can't learn that in school
","IMDb Top 250: 164What a strange film. The Graduate follows meek undergrad Ben upon his return from school. He doesn't want to socialize at all, despite his parents pushing him and later embarrassing him. Eventually he finds something comfortable in a precarious affair which creates a notable change in Ben... until he meets his partner's daughter. Conflict, quirk, a little creepy and cute follow in the Rebel Without a Cause of the 60's.This could've been a very boring, mundane film. But creativity triumphs. Scenes are lively, almost on the surreal side, and certainly engaging. The cinematography is incredible, with inventive ways to show a scene like the scuba view, the many car shots, extreme zooms and the famous leg shots. Topically the film is very similar to Lolita, but visually The Graduate is in the current generation of film while Lolita remains in the previous.Unlike the warm atmosphere of his home, Ben is a very plain person. Early we hear about some of his school achievements, none of which he exhibits much pride in (or has any proof of), and he keeps to himself. He doesn't even have the presence to call a waiter. Hoffman makes this weakness so painful, and in cases funny to see. But Ben exhibits change and though his thoughts don't shift, his belief in his own opinions deepen. By the end of the film you'll be looking at a radically different person.The Robinsons are just as compelling, namely the sultry Mrs. The scenes she shares with Ben are magic and among the most memorable of the film. They are opposites: she dominates with confidence, he... doesn't. Like Ben she has a change- but not at all the same way. Elaine also draws emotion, like a sick feeling on their first 'date'. You feel for her, she goes through a lot. I felt she was familiar, and with further research I realized why: she's in my favourite film of all time Donnie Darko.I have a lack of affinity for several sex themed films, like Doctor Zhivago. So this film was a bit tough stomaching, with the whole jumping generations as partners. You may feel the same, or a more extreme, disgust, or you may find it simply theatrical and funny. I could tolerate it because of the light tone and strength of other aspects. I also, with an objective position, figured that Ben gets to be quite a stalker, despite his intentions. If you can put things like that aside in a film you will like the film even more than I did.The Graduate is a culturally significant film, relateable to all who are getting out of school and facing the real world with its work and social problems. It's a charming depiction of coming of age and to terms with ones' self. You'll laugh, raise a few eyebrows and will certainly enjoy this film. I also hope you like Simon and Garfunkel because they play over, and over, and over... 8.5/10",8,0,0,15 June 2012
Singin' in the Rain," Just a swell film.
","IMDb Top 250: 79 Singin' In the Rain. A true classic, and a well deserved reputation. It's charming, cute, catchy and funny all in one bright cheery package of joy. A gem, and one of the very few musicals I've enjoyed.Singin' in the Rain is about Hollywood, and how it had to change from silent to sound. It's a cool premise that works very well. We follow Don Lockwood, a silent film star, played perfectly by Gene Kelly, with charisma and plenty of smiles. His opening scene, highlighting his road to fame, is hilarious. His 'relationship' with Lina is equally funny, as they alternate through time liking and being repulsed by each other. Jean Hagen is really funny as the ditsy starlet, with that legendary voice and her head in the clouds. While we're talking about actors, I can't forget Donald O'Connor as Cosmo, friend to Don, and star of the legendary Make 'Em Laugh.The film is bright and cheery,and it puts you in a good mood. The plot moves quickly, and the numbers are not too far apart or back to back. And they're great. Some amazing tap dancing (and rain dancing) are mesmerizing, and there are no weak acts. The songs themselves are easy to get into and catchy. The time to prepare for such acts must've been dizzying, especially since some songs don't change the camera often.The film wraps up nicely, with a good ending. Strong from start to finish, Singin' in the Rain deserves its praise and holds up very well today. Even one who doesn't like musicals will enjoy Singin' in the Rain. 8.8/10",9,0,1,30 August 2011
Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind," Spotless Sunshine of the Eternal Mind
","Sound a little confusing? It is. The movie is. But it's confusing in a good way, a dreamy way. It's the first movie which features the opening credits as a plot twist. But you won't figure out it is until the end. If you figure it out. With a distorted sense of time and an interesting narrative style, Eternal Sunshine is a unique film that will exercise your mind in more than one way.Eternal Sunshine is a romance with sci fi elements. It's fantastic. Both Jim Carrey and Kate Winslet are really great, and have true chemistry: Carrey, the awkward Everyman, dressed in all brown, and Winslet the quirky, upbeat girl with vibrant colours. Seeing them together makes you smile.The four other supporting cast members work well together. Ruffalo as the nerd-type scientist, Elijah Wood as his bud, who is kind of weird, Kirsten Dunst as the the secretary who offers up a twist of her own, and Tom Wilkinson, who I have yet to see as a faithful man in a role. They're good distractions in a two-person film.The film has a dreamy, quirky atmosphere, like my favourite film Donnie Darko. They actually have a few connections: love stories, lonely leading men, upbeat original music, and twists that demand a second viewing.If you like relatable characters, an original and well-scripted plot, or critically acclaimed movies, see this: it's arguably the best romance ever. If you hate happiness, don't see it. You'll feel great after seeing this. 8.7/10",9,0,2,18 June 2011
The Artist," Embrace the past
","IMDb Top 250: 116I shouldn't have liked The Artist. Back in September I was thinking of concepts for films, and one of the ideas I came up with was for a black and white silent film, a homage to that era. This was before I had heard of this film; months later it came out, and has been hailed as brilliant and showered with awards. So I was a bit grumpy. Anyway, grumbles aside, I saw it today.The Artist is charming. Showing the other perspective of the Singin' in the Rain story, the silent side, The Artist is clever. It follows George Valentin's (Jean Dujardin) fade as talkies become prevalent, with Peppy Miller's (Berenice Bejo) rise for the same reasons. The synopsis is the same as 'Singin', but the plot is different. The Artist is fun.I've seen a few silent films, and quite recently too. However my position on them is different from many reviewers: I don't have a feeling of nostalgia from my parents liking them, and certainly wasn't around to see them soon after they first came out. Most my age haven't seen a silent film voluntarily, or at all.Anyway, The Artist nails the feeling of the times, and feels completely natural. This is its biggest draw: a major motion picture in the new millennium, black and white with only music to accompany (mostly). There's lots of touches big and small that add to the atmosphere: the film is presented with a 1.33:1 aspect ratio, meaning it isn't widescreen. The opening credits are right out of the era, with several cards saying the major people behind the film. Also, the music is fantastic, and has a much larger responsibility than films created today. The sets and costumes are remarkable: everything is authentic, or at least looks like it. Fittingly for a film called The Artist, the art direction is brilliant.Jean Dujardin carries the show. The film isn't just about the Silent Era- it's about George Valentin's fantasy Silent era, with one exceptional break. He is perfect for the role like Jon Hamm is to Don Draper- you can't see anyone else doing it. This unique role that will define him would seem to have doomed his career- in America anyway. But the future can't damper this present. He's fantastic. Peppy is bright and cheery, like her name, and is also excellent. One of my first thoughts was, 'there's no way she's a supporting cast member'. She has a lot of screen time and presence. Maybe the Oscar nod was to keep her away from Streep's chokehold? The acting is fine all around, but there are only two starts in this show. Everyone convincingly acts silent, just a tad over the top. The dog is great.One note to those who have seen silent films and not liked them: The Artist avoids the pitfall of excess speech. Many silent films have talking but few intertitles, so much plot is missed or poorly conveyed. The Artist doesn't have this problem- the script- and therefore the plot- is clear and concise, and the words chosen have great weight, like my favourite: 'Why won't you talk?'While generally lighthearted, there are a few dips into serious drama, and they lead to out of place comic relief that removes the weight of the scene, which some may like, not having to feel negative emotions, but I did not. Another small quip is that the grip on my attention was (very) slightly lost in the middle, for a short time.It's no secret that the movie is a period film about filmmaking, but it also deals with pride, change, and the relation between those too which is quite relatable. But don't watch the Artist for a thematic lesson, enjoy it for the fun, history and film heritage.The team behind this picked a great time to make it: it's been a long enough time that most would find a silent film interesting, but not too long that they are completely outdated. One should prepare by seeing an old film, like a Chaplin or a Keaton comedy and see just how far (or not) film has come. The Artist is a great film that doesn't rely on its gimmick (because its not a gimmick) to succeed. I believe that Best Picture should go to an achievement in film that can be widely enjoyed, but also has a certain amount of originality and creativity that people in 50 years will remember that the picture was special. Therefore The Artist is a very deserving winner. The Academy picked a great film this year. 8.5/10",8,0,3,4 March 2012
A Clockwork Orange," A real horrorshow, my droogs
","IMDb Top 250: 56With all the criticism of the rating system today, one can look back to see a reason why they are enforced in the first place: the legendary Clockwork Orange. Like a drug, this film has good uses, or it can be completely abused and misinterpreted. I think the film gets a bad rep for its content, although it absolutely deserves its rating, illustrated by the infamous 'Singin in the Rain' scene...A Clockwork Orange is extraordinarily evil and shallow, but also incredibly sophisticated and thought-provoking. It has unprecedented sex, violence and intensity, still cringeworthy to today. But it is also a film with unique linguistics, echoing the great William Shakespeare, and a haut sense of music, with constant classical music, specifically Beethoven. The juxtaposition is jarring.With the depth of 5 films, A Clockwork Orange speaks about so much more than violence and sex. Youth/elderly relations, society, government, youth, good and evil, morals and choices, and violence and sex are portrayed in one of the densest films I've ever seen. Specifically the government aspect hit me: throughout the film a viewer wonder whether the film argues for the left or right side, but I concluded that it fights for neither: it argues against both sides, with no right answer. Complete destruction, like the characters. Genius!More than a thematic film, Clockwork is visually quirky as well. Taking place in the near future, although by now it actually the near past, the world hasn't changed too much, but the changes are zany. Women have fully coloured wigs, drug bars exist, and the interior decorators were probably tripping on said milk. Like the Fallout game series, there's a certain culture freeze: cars and music haven't really advanced. The world is strange looking, and even more strange acting, but that's another stroke of genius. Look outside, people are practically orange! What we value is just as strange as what Clockwork's does. Another poke at society.Then there's the characters... let's start with Alex. Alex is a bad guy, no doubt about it. You certainly won't want to admit that, seeing how charismatic and likable he is. His iconic clothes, slang and attitude harbor feelings in us that deep down... we want to be him. As my friend described him, 'God I hate him so much but I feel bad for him, y'know?'Also notable are Alex's parents. Like in Rebel Without a Cause, there is disconnection, a generation gap between them and Alex. His parents are total pushovers, ignorant and meek. They try to avoid problems: through them, it becomes apparent how Alex became how his is, without anyone to keep him in check.Several Kubrick staples return, including Alex's fantastic narration and the mythical, otherworldly music. The brilliant synth score sets the tone immediately, while the classical music Alex loves so, so much is the opposite of the horrors presented on screen. Simply, A Clockwork Orange has some of the best structure and flow in film. There are three distinct acts, with individual scenes that each have a unique identity, serving several purposes, connecting, foreshadowing, symbolizing. These are classic scenes, all recognizable, no filler. And the pacing, which could have been slowed to help stomach the brutality, was not. It's very quick.A cynical masterpiece with an eye to point out everything wrong with everything, I did something that I've never done before with a film: I watched it again the day after to really take it all in. A brilliant film, decades ahead of the times, an iconic classic. Kubrick immediately topped his previous work, 2001. 9.6/10",10,0,2,4 May 2012
Eyes Wide Shut," Kubrick's legend
","Well, this is it. After two months I've seen every Kubrick film in order, from Fear and Desire to Eyes Wide Shut. And while I was a bit nervous about how then- 70 year old Kubrick would handle the topic of sex with Hollywood stars after a decade off from directing, I have to applaud this absolutely wonderful surprise of film, horribly underrated on this site, the IMDb.Eyes Wide Shut channels much of Kubrick's previous work, such as A Clockwork Orange and 2001 while crafting its own unique identity. If you've ever wondered how directors from previous eras would fair in this generation, look no further: this film shows evolution. It's impossible to believe that this was made by the same man who made The Killing. But don't believe that this film is great because of its director or his past work: the score reflects my opinion of the film on its own.Summarizing Eyes Wide Shut is difficult: the plot consists of a couple fighting and he walks into a series of events causing an awakening. Is it romantic? Nope. Thriller, or a mystery? Yep, and a bit scary in places too. But for the the entire 2.5+ hour runtime its engaging, and constantly interesting. You'll wonder what happens next and how it all plays out, and there's a sense of wonder throughout: movie magic. I wonder if Kubrick knew this was going to be his last film, because he references so much of his previous work, something I haven't noticed him to do much. Notably from Clockwork and Lolita is the content. From 2001 there is a sense of realization. Such as learning about the moment we evolved into what we are today, Eyes Wide Shut ironically opens our eyes to aspects of life we tend to pass over. A revolution.And from Barry Lyndon and Full Metal Jacket, Eyes Wide Shut draws beauty. This film is beautiful to see, with extravagant upper class parties and a living city. I was shocked to learn this was all filmed in England.From this film I appreciate Tom Cruise and Nicole Kidman more as actors. Working with Kubrick was never easy, especially on this film's long shoot. Both leads perform excellently, and are perfect for the characters. They were up to the challenges and demands of the film, and the offscreen parallels don't hurt either.I can't believe this is a 7.2. Maybe it's the hype, or maybe some just didn't like the length. But everything serves its purpose in Eyes Wide Shut, like the greatest films. Eyes Wide Shut is an excellent film, a great swan song from the greatest director of all time who left my eyes wide open. 8.7/10",9,5,8,3 June 2012
The Untouchables," A great mob movie.
","The Untouchables is an excellent movie set in 1930's Chicago, showing a fictionalized version of Al Capone's arrest. From the director of the fun, family film Scarface, Untouchables has action and charm and one of the best films in its sub-genre.The Untouchables has style. Everything looks convincing, and we feel transported to the 1930's. The dialogue is entertaining, there's humour that could've been left out for a more serious film but works well, and Robert De Niro plays a gangster.Speaking of De Niro, the characters and acting are superb. Costner is the golden Ness, a genuinely uncompromisable and good person. Connery, in an Oscar-winning role, is great as the old Irish cop who doesn't let rules get in the way, in one of the most shocking, brutal and awesome moments. And De Niro... he's one of the best ever, and the Untouchables is no exception. The dinner scene.Like the more current Inglorious Basterds, the action in Untouchables is mostly quick and brutal, carried out by a few men. All the gunfire and violence has 'oomph' to it, and some scenes are gripping, specifically the train station. My chest was tight for ten minutes after it was done.A great movie deserving of a spot on the 250, The Untouchables is a top-tier mob movie that should be seen by fans of the genre, De Niro, or history. Excellent. 8.6/10",9,0,1,5 August 2011
Mystic River," Well-acted crime mystery
","Clint Eastwood directs this crime mystery about three men, and how they're forced apart and brought together again. It's a conventional plot; a murder mystery complete with cops, sunglasses and a red herring. Truth is, there's nothing too special about the plot. The first scene is great, setting the tone and mood as well as giving key information, and the end has bite (in a good way, but not necessarily happy way), but everything in the middle is run-of-the-mill.What isn't run of the mill is the acting. First things first, I've never like Sean Penn. I've never seen any of his movies, either. I just don't like him. Don't like his look. But he steals the show here. His anger, sadness, and especially his grieving seem absolutely genuine, and as a viewer it's gut-wrenching to watch him cry. I haven't seen many of the other nominees, but he deserves his nomination, if not the win.Tim Robbins, in one of his major roles not about Shawshank Prison, also performs well. He never cried, or showed much of anything in Shawshank. So it was a nice change to seem him play a shaken, emotionally distressed man. He's very good.Rounding out the Good,the Bad and the Ugly is Kevin Bacon as the icy cop. It seems I've only seen him in serious roles, like Frost/Nixon. I wasn't convinced with his phone relationship, and thought his reunion at the end was unnecessary. I understand why it was included though, to show that even cops have lives outside the job, as so few seem to do in film.Speaking of old Clint Eastwood films, the liquor store owner looks like a certain bandito, eh?I've read around the boards, and Mystic River is deeper than the plot. Much of the character's lives can be extrapolated, so you can make your own minds up about why they do what they do. This is a good film with terrific actors, but other than that it's not too special. 7.8/10",8,0,1,15 June 2011
It's a Wonderful Life," Capra's Masterpiece
","Every Christmas Eve, I watch this film with my dad. Before I can remember anything else, I remember this film. I used to be bored of it, and leave sometimes, but this is the first time I can truly appreciate what an amazing, inspiring, heartwarming and perfect film this is. Without a doubt, It's A Wonderful Life is Frank Capra's masterpiece, and one of the best films of all time.In one of his most iconic roles, Jimmy Stewart is George Bailey, a noble man living in Bedford Falls. After an intro that already leaves you choked up, we see an otherworldly conversation in which Joseph sends Clarence, an AS-II, to help George, who is 'contemplating throwing away God's greatest gift'. From there, we see George grow up, seeing his dreams pushed aside to help the town face the greedy Mr. Potter. Eventually, we catch up to Christmas Eve, where one of the greatest scenes in film takes place- only to be followed by another. It is a dark film, but ends with the most uplifting message ever told convincingly on the screen.Everything about the film is perfect (except for 3 cuts). The acting, and the characters, are top notch. George Bailey is one of the most likable, developed characters of all time. He is a selfless man who puts the people first. As Clarence says, 'I like George Bailey.' I wish there were more George Baileys in the world. His wife, Mary (Donna Reed) is much like him- kind and gentle. Together, they're one of the classic screen couples, and we feel for them. The dinner scene in the abandoned house, and their first scene on the dance floor; it's... wonderful. One of cinema's great villains, Lionel Barrymore's Henry F. Potter is the personification of greed. He has no family and no need for money, but he needs more power and tries snatching it away from the Baileys for the entire film. He is a completely realized character. The film also has a great supporting cast- Sam, the one who did achieve his dreams, Violet, the head turner, Uncle Billy and Harry... everyone brings this film together. The location is a character itself. Bedford Falls, the fictional (New York?) town, is the backdrop of Georges adventure: he wants to leave, but can't shake the town. The strip, Bailey Park, Martini's and the bridge, it's a fully fledged town created on a set.Truly great films use every shot to show something, and It's A Wonderful Life is a part of that club. Mostly little things that you can't remember, but every scene, every shot, benefits the viewer. We learn a little thing about George, a little about the town, a little foreshadowing, this quality separates great films from fantastic films.Many films try to inspire, but this one puts all others to shame. For two hours, we build up, seeing why this good man is in a terrible situation, and then he is taught a divine lesson, and then you cry for a while as he understands the lesson and viewers wish to become better people- more like George Bailey. That's a factor you can't describe in writing, and the major reason this film is played every year. No matter who you are or what you believe, you can take something good away from this film.You can call this a Christmas film, and it feels great watching it in season, but It's A Wonderful Life is timeless. The greatest actors, the greatest story, the greatest message- if you haven't seen this film you have to.'To my big brother George, the richest man in town.' -Harry Bailey 10/10",10,1,2,24 December 2011
A Beautiful Mind," Hollywood at its finest
","I knew nothing about this movie before I saw it, only that it was a true story about a mathematician whose life took a turn for the worse after taking a new job. I thought this was a espionage-math movie. This made the plot progression much more shocking, and gave the film, in my eyes, a great twist.A Beautiful Mind tells the story of John Nash, a man who is great at math, but not great with women. He takes on the job of breaking codes for the government, and begins to be followed and in one excellent scene, shot at. However, *SPOILERS* this is not the case, he is a schizophrenic, and it was all in his head. We see his slow recovery with fallbacks, as well as his wife's ordeals through this.Starring Russell Crowe, fresh from his Best Actor win, is a radically different person here: he is meek and intelligent, as opposed to the brave and strong Maximus. I believe his performance here is better than in Gladiator. He shows more range and is convincing as the confused and sick Nash.Opposite him is his wife Alicia played by Jennifer Connelly, fresh from her descent in a favourite of mine, Requiem for A Dream. She is excellent, but I think she slipped at the end in the aged finale. Her makeup/CGI is not convincing.From Nash's view, the film is planted in reality, but the amazing original soundtrack makes it more like a dream. Even the intense chase is accompanied by piano. The music is great, and you notice the scenes it isn't present.The direction is great, the pacing is quick, and the shooting is conventional, but that's all it needs to be.Why did I describe the film as 'Hollywood at its finest'? Because the true story is far less glamorous and sympathetic. The filmmakers cut out Nash's lesser moments, like his divorce, affairs and racist rants. Also the majority of the hallucinations didn't happen. There was no roommate, no government agents in his head: the reality wouldn't make a very good film. Certainly, changes can be made to enhance a story for the screen, but this story is barely John Nash. This post-viewing knowledge soured my remembrance of the film.A Beautiful Mind is a great film with great direction and acting, but strays too far from the truth. But don't let that dampen your mood on a great drama. 8.6/10",9,0,1,4 October 2011
The Departed," Serious men
","IMDb Top 250: 58The Departed is like Goodfellas for the next decade. It has crime, music, and Scorcese at the reigns. While it cannot replicate the magic of Goodfellas, which will never happen, The Departed tells a different kind of crime story with great success.If you didn't know, The Departed is about the Irish mafia in Boston shown from both sides of the law. The tale is quickly paced, with lots of angry looking men. There's several twists and unexpected moments that will affect you in various ways. Gritty and violent, The Departed gets in your face.The film centers on men who are on both sides of the law, or so it appears. DiCaprio is excellent as Bill, a rookie cop in a family with a history of crime, who is sent undercover. His anger is very well conveyed. Leo does a great job. He is backed by Queenan (Martin Sheen) and Dignam (Mark Wahlberg). Sheen may be the only reasonable person in the entire film, and he's a good foil for the vulgar Digham, played well by Wahlberg, who acted from experience. They're all going after Costello, in another superb performance, this one by Jack Nicholson. He's a little crazy, and a great villain. His informant in the police is Sullivan, played by a mostly straight Matt Damon. He does the role justice, but doesn't stand out.This is very evidently a Scorcese picture. Great shots, including a cool intro with Costello where his face is just out of the light until the reveal. The pace is fast, and the film is well edited. Music accompanies, but ends abruptly, or is nearly silenced. It doesn't work as well as Goodfellas or Casino. For some reason, Gimme Shelter is played- twice, as is the most- fitting Shipping Up to Boston.Crime fans and fans of Scorcese need to see this, and those who can stomach the brutal violence and copious amounts of swearing should see why this won Best Picture. Serious men indeed. 8.6/10",9,1,1,1 September 2011
Psycho," Terrifying Presence
","IMDb Top 250: 24 Psycho is one of the most iconic films ever. The simple name, the menace, the immortal shower scene. the immortal, impossible- to-form-as- words screech of the violins during the most intense scenes in the movie. Psycho has stood the test of time, even 50 years later.It's still important to know that this film has aged, but only because cinema evolved. Movies became more graphic and visceral, but Psycho can still ensnare you in its grasp. Hitchcock is a brilliant director, it seems that everything is so easy to him. He has nine films on the 250, more than anyone else.It's interesting: over a half hour goes by before Marion reaches the Bates Motel,and the film is one hour fifty minutes. Time is taken to set up a plot and develop characters, which happens less and less today. Hitchcock takes his time... and when he strikes, there is true terror. The plot moves along, never taking too much time, and everything wraps up well.Most of the acting is fine, but Anthony Perkins stands out. 1960 must've been a strong year for him to not be nominated for Best Actor. His casual walk, his kind smile, it's unnerving. Something's up with Norman Bates. But the little things make it: his eye movements, muscle twitches- especially those- make him the star of the show.Yeah yeah yeah... the shower scene. Truth is, it's probably the most aged scene in the movie. But I won't dwell on something most of you already know.I was surprised by the music. While the screech is universally-known in film circles, I was impressed with the rest of the music, which fits the film completely.Psycho is an experience that must be seen by any film fan. If you can picture yourself in 1960, you could be shocked. Psycho is greater than the sum of its parts. 9.2/10",9,0,0,20 June 2011
All Quiet on the Western Front," All Quiet now
","IMDb Top 250: 212First of all: I saw the silent version on TCM. This threw me off, because I had anticipated a talking film, but once I learned there were several versions I shrugged it off and watched the film.Remembrance Day (Canadian) is an important day to me, a history fanatic. I believe it's so important to not forget what previous generations have done for us. So All Quiet on the Western Front's message of peace seemed fitting to watch on this special day. It is important to realize what the world was like when this was made. The Great War had ended only 12 years ago, and WWII had not occurred, and in 1930 it wasn't even really on anyone's horizon. 1929 was the start of the Great Depression, and when this film was made. It was also the time when silent films transitioned into talkies. This film was a big gamble- tough topic, big budget, large cast, and it all paid off.'All Quiet' is a visual representation of Grade 10 History. Everything I learned about WWI is present in this film: propaganda at home, peer pressure, poor, unexpected conditions, trenches, mud, loss: but this was new to the people of 1930. So while a viewer now won't be so shocked, they would've been 80 years ago. But 'All Quiet' nails the visual aspect of life in the War.We follow a group of German schoolboys, as they sign up and find out about the horror of war. Through the first half, they are a collective, but eventually the film focuses on Paul. Lew Ayres crafted a character that affected his life. We see a boy become a man, and then the shell of a man.I found some sections to be a tad over-dramatic, like the hospital scene with the boots. It just went on and on, and it didn't help there was lots of dialogue and few cards of words.But 'All Quiet' is best, and most heart-wrenching when everyone stops talking and we see battle. The first real fight we see, after days of shelling, is one of the most nauseating fights ever. And for its time, easily the most violent. The massive scale, the incredibly accurate battlefield, the sheer number of men- it's unbelievable. Seeing the machine gunner mowing down people in a single camera shot, seeing a man disappear with only his hands attached to wire- it's downright upsetting and one of the most epic battles ever. No amount of talk can emphasize a message like dramatic reenactments of trench warfare. And then, when the allies jump into the trenches, the guns go away, the bayonets go away- and the shovels come out. I hate to make this comparison, but Saving Private Ryan wouldn't be possible without this film to pave the way.Some may be turned off by its age, but 'All Quiet' is one of the earliest essential films, and maybe the earliest essential war film. It absolutely deserves its accolades. The message, always relevant, and the ending, always shattering, create an amazing tragic drama that is a very important viewing. 8.5/10",9,1,1,12 November 2011
To Kill a Mockingbird," The American Classic
","Up in Canada, To Kill A Mockingbird was our novel studied in the eighth grade. I don't remember too much about Grade 8 now, and even less about the book, except that it was dreadfully boring for a 13-year old: I was too preoccupied by Lord of the Flies. Not even the movie could gather my interest.I'm a bit older now and a lot more educated, so it was time to really take in this treasured film. And wow, what a difference a few years makes. This film, extraordinarily faithful to the source, grabs the atmosphere and setting of the film and spells it out on screen. TKAM is a wonderful story of adult issues through a child's eyes, under the watchful eye of moral hero Atticus Finch.In just over two hours the effects of the Depression in the South is seen, as well as the lingering racism and prejudice of the Civil War, the vivid imagination of children and the effect a strong parent can have on children. The themes have very positive stances: this is no Grapes of Wrath. The film is family-friendly except for several contextual uses of the N- word.Though it is a positive film, it is not an easy viewing. Like any great example of any medium, To Kill A Mockingbird is dense and not extremely easy to follow, due in part to its age and content- there's virtually no 'action' and the one true scene of physical conflict is weak compared to the rest of the film. Another way to say it is that if you have a meeting with a film buff and you want to appear smart but haven't seen many classic films, don't start with this one. I remember seeing the AFI's Heroes and Villains list and being a little put off by Atticus' place... but I can't now. He's a model parent and an inspiration to all- he has integrity and a calm persona, never letting his temper flare. Peck's voice is so assuring, and he just looks like an upstanding citizen who knows that kids are kids and that it's more important to go with what you believe is right than what others would try to make you do.Seeing To Kill A Mockingbird is to read the book- a slow but expansive look at a slice of time through young eyes. It's a shame this came out in the same year as Lawrence of Arabia- one year either way and it may have received the awards to place it physically in the halls of time, if not our hearts. 9.3/10",9,0,1,3 January 2013
The Bridge on the River Kwai," A beautiful bridge
","IMDb Top 250: 83 I found myself in the possession of three films after Christmas this year: The Bridge on the River Kwai, Lawrence of Arabia, and Doctor Zhivago. These are all David Lean films, and so I decided to start my David Lean unit with the first of those films, the 7- Oscar winning 'Bridge on the River Kwai'. And oh my, what a start it was.'Kwai' is a World War II film made 12 years after the war concluded. The film centers around the titular Bridge, and how British POWs build it under the leadership of Colonel Nicholson, and how a small group of Allied commandos try to destroy it. It's a grand idea for a plot, about the conflict of ideas and lack of communication.The film is loosely broken into three acts. The first act follows Nicholson's standoff with the Japanese commanding officer in the POW camp about the rules of war, and the subsequent building of the bridge under two different leaderships. The second act is about a small group of Allies who venture into the jungle to destroy the bridge, and their encounters in the wild. The final act concludes the story of the two camps in a magnificent way.An interesting angle of the film is that despite being a war film, there is little violence, and no swearing. All of the action that does happen is necessary, something that has influenced even modern films like 'Drive'. Both plots could have inserted extra action but didn't, and this restraint makes good movies into great movies. The Bridge on the River Kwai is about the people of war as much as their actions.A product of this decision is that the first act could be considered slow. There is lots of standing, lots of talking, and lots of stubbornness. But by the end a viewer realizes how necessary it is. In 'The Good, the Bad & the Ugly', there is an extended sequence where the bad guy forces Clint Eastwood to walk through the desert, and for a while, very little happens. This scene could've been over quicker, but that would have defeated the point that Clint breaks down. That is an idea from 'Kwai'. A month goes by as the leaders verbally, and silently, duke it out with their ideals. The slow first act is necessary to emotionally invest in the scenario, and the film just gets better from there.My summary of the film is 'a beautiful bridge'. The first half of this statement is beautiful, and it perfectly describes the visual aspect of the film. The cinematography is sublime. Sweeping jungle vistas, fauna, rushing rivers and more make simply seeing 'Kwai' a treat. I was lucky enough to get it on Blu Ray, and for an old film it looks fantastic. The bats in a certain river scene are absolutely breathtaking. You can simulate a lot in Hollywood, but this is an outstanding example of shooting on location in the jungles of what is now Sri Lanka.But there's more than just looking at the film, the substance is even greater, starting with the actors. They are excellent. Alec Guinness, in his award winning performance, is the British general who we are so conflicted about. His decisions are both completely correct and absolutely wrong. He is an idealist, valuing discipline and honour above his duty as an Allied leader. His decisions beg to ask the question, 'What would you do?' Nicholson is a layered character performed perfectly.Colonel Saito is the commander of the Japanese at the camp, and is the primary... antagonist. His stance is portrayed ruthlessly and effectively. He and Nicholson butt heads, but are two sides of the same coin. They have an excellent dynamic, and their relationship is worth studying for its complexity.Away from the clash of leaders is Shears, an American played by William Holden. In this film where ego reigns supreme, Shears is the realistic, reasonable, and wiseass one. He's the character who says, 'What's the matter with all of you guys?' He's is well played and has the best line in the film: 'You...' The casting is just excellent overall.The second part of my summary is 'bridge'. Despite the obvious reason, 'Kwai' is a bridge between the old era of film and the new. Scenes with lots of talking, like the discussion about escape, are old fashioned, very 50's. But others, like the trek through the jungle and the ending, are far ahead of their time. The stealthy hunt for the Japanese soldier and the whole visual aspect of that scene is certainly influential on another war epic, Apocalypse Now. In general, The Bridge on the River Kwai is ahead of its time.As I've said, the film gets better and better, culminating in the extraordinary ending. It is one of the best scenes in film and leaves much to discuss. A common statement from the Warden, the explosives-happy commando is to expect the unexpected. The event that makes the last scene unexpected is so obviously a factor but so easily overlooked, you'll gasp. Words to describe the climatic scene include explosive, awesome, shaking, and epic. And then you'll think. What did Warden mean? What did Shears mean? What did Nicholson mean? Did he do what he did on purpose? You can have a great discussion about those actions. And then to end it all, the realistic doctor saying 'Madness! Madness!' And then zooming out, to admire the jungle... an amazing shot.'Kwai' is a thinking film. You can wonder how you would do in that situation. The film also touches on the waste of war, honour and pride, and also the role of the young in battle. It's stupendous, a landmark film. 9.4/10",9,1,3,28 December 2011
One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest," I'm not stuck in here with you, you're stuck in here with me!
","Have you ever found a piece of old schoolwork and realized how dumb you were? That now, with all of your more developed skills, you could've done that same assignment to a higher degree of quality or ease? That's how I felt watching One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest for the second time. 2 years ago I enjoyed the plot, characters, and ending, but now, 2 years and over 150 films later, I can appreciate One Flew Over for what it is: a masterpiece of fiction, and a deceptively challenging piece of art.I'll jump past the plot synopsis and get to the heart of the film: R.P. MacMurphy. The slacker, rebel, that kid in class who just wouldn't listen. How can you deal with a character like MacMurphy? Is something wrong with him? This is a major thematic point in Cuckoo's Nest, and the answers aren't simple. What gives someone the right to make choices for another? What is the point that someone can't think for themselves? Is there a point? Questions beget questions, especially around the idea of 'authority'.That authority is personified by Nurse Ratched. She looks like an authority figure: icy glare, skull- like face. Instantly you dislike the nurse. You're pointed in that direction by the patients. But personally, when looking at her character objectively, I didn't find her bad for most of the film. Let me elaborate: a few weekends ago I met an children's organ transplant doctor. It is the most noble of work, but visually I could tell it took a toll on him. He wasn't rude, or volatile, or detached, but what he described himself as 'serious'. Working in healthcare, seeing things go wrong, that wears you down. I believe Ratched, working (for a long time), hearing mental patients yell about trivial things such as cigarettes, day after day, takes its toll. You wouldn't be a cheerful soul after years of that. Of course at the end she does flex her cruelty and we really grow to resent her, but for most of the film I thought she was just doing her job.This is a great film to analyze because it's so opinionated. Two similar people can see it, and based off of their own experiences will draw very different conclusions about the message and characters. Many others hate Nurse Ratched. I'm sure there are those out there who don't like MacMurphy. Some will say control is necessary, others that freedom is the most important thing out there. Cuckoo doesn't really force you into believing one certain way.The hospital itself if juxtaposing: the setting is a plain, boring hospital with drab white everything, but the characters are quirky and colourful. I loved them all, and didn't find anyone really annoying: Chezwick's extremity, Tobar's big reactions, the Chief, General, Billy, and a near- silent Stanley Kubrick-alike. This band of misfits are a joy to watch, and have some laugh-out-loud moments like Martini eating the dice and the basketball game.Despite the hospital setting, Cuckoo is a generally smile-inducing film with a fantastic script that develops its characters well for the conclusion. And oh, the end. It is really a twist, but the second you realize what's happened, how the chips have fallen, you give an audible gasp. This is one of the great film endings, bitter and sweet, but very satisfying. It may even bring a tear to your eye. 9.4/10",9,2,3,15 December 2012
Prometheus," We messed up
","Prometheus is a good film that could've been more, and could've been much less. It is strong and thought- provoking until it decides not to be, leaving a very 'meh' feeling leaving the theatre. The film opens with a beautiful and mysterious prologue that has already led to several theories. It's in the realm of 2001: A Space Odyssey, especially with the opening shot, but argues a very different thesis. Cut to a short prelude, and then space, with the trillion dollar Prometheus on route to investigate a possible lead to the origin of life. The lead is found in several giant, hollow domes, and we experience a feeling of great awe and discovery with the crew. Then as one would expect, things don't go to plan. After some good shock horror and one particular 'all bets are now off' moment, the tension is elevated for the rest of the film, although this is at the cost of answers.Knowing that this film is related to Alien adds to the atmosphere, and that knowledge becomes a constant presence. Prometheus is decidedly more engaging and action oriented than Alien at the cost of tight structure. So while Prometheus may be a more interesting 2 hours, Alien leaves you feeling more satisfied. I should add that while I gave it an 8.2, I didn't particularly like Alien that much, preferring its sequel Aliens. I found Alien to be a fine film that hasn't held up so well today.Prometheus tries to handle so much thematically: faith vs. science, man's relation to machine, and the creation of human life. It's unfortunate that the film buckles under these themes, as in the end it chooses to sideline the themes to wrap up the plot, which isn't concluded all that thoroughly either. Of course its impossible to offer a foolproof answer as to why we're here, but waving it in front of us then distracting us with explosions only leads to frustration. This is one reason people feel disappointed: Prometheus asks the big questions but avoids the big answers.Tries to deal with so much: philosophy, faith vs. science (evidence), man and machine, creation of us and furthermore life, but in the end it chooses to sideline this to wrap up the plot, which isn't concluded all that well either. Obviously it's tough to try and answer why we are, but don't wave it in front of us then distract with explosions and epic music. This is why some feel disappointed: talks the talk, but the walk falls apart. This is a subsection of what I've determined to be the weakest, critical link in the film- the writing. I wrote a note of all the questions I could think of after seeing the film that weren't directly answered, and while not everything needs to be, some of them had to be. Sorry Lindeloff: I love Lost, but a 2 hour film is no place to tease us with ambiguity. Despite the muddled ending, the story works as a sci-fi plot, especially with the great effects. The CG is fantastic and very infrequently feels fake or intrusive, cutting edge stuff. The scares are as infrequent as in Alien, but can still get you. Scary isn't a good word for the horror, shocking and grotesque is far more fitting. The horror composes some of the most memorable scenes in the film, like the 'space cobra', Fifield and the incredibly tense surgery, the last one especially if you've seen Alien. I won't spoil how, but no characters feel untouchable. The characters are strong for a science fiction film that focuses on lore. Namely, the andoid David (Michael Fassbender), who, being a robot, is strange, and as devious as he is caring. Like Ash from Alien his agenda is questionable. I loved his mannerisms and Lawrence of Arabia persona. I don't think he can go wrong with the Academy doing a Peter O'Toole impression like that.Elizabeth Shaw is the official lead, played by a favourite of mine, Noomi Rapace. Like Ripley she is a survivor, very adaptable. We care about her and her charismatic partner Holloway. Charlize Theron, as the ship's overseer and corporate presence Ms. Vickers falls as the snappy, no nonsense female archetype character. I'm trying to avoid the b- word here. I find that to be the cop out of female power roles. Then, unlike Alien, there are support characters in numbers. While most of them are merely body presence, the crew has some entertaining filler banter and the Captain is great adding comic relief and character development.Prometheus had lofty expectations from decades of fans. It met the elementary requirements but fell short where it promised to stand out. It's an entertaining 2 hours, enjoyable on a basic level but frustrating when it comes to answers, which in this case are very important. My summary reflects three levels: the crew messed up by poking around in the dome and taking samples, and even just looking for answers. The Engineers messed up their attempt to clean up and it backfired, and lastly the filmmakers (writers especially) building up to so much that they couldn't explain it all on film, and thus committed the film sin of forcing the answers on the potential sequel. A little ambiguity leads to good discussion, but too much leads to disappointment. One can certainly have good discussions about Prometheus, I already have, but the evidence for arguments gets weaker as the film goes on. Prometheus is a good film with just too many unkept promises. 7.9/10",8,1,6,9 June 2012
Paths of Glory," A splendid little war
","IMDb Top 250: 49That's a quote used to describe the Spanish- American war just before the turn of the century. And when you're the one whose quotes get remembered, you can say whatever positive things you want because its not you out on the battlefield. Paths of Glory examines an aspect of war different from the direct horrors soldiers see: it focuses on the gap between those in power and those without.In its message Paths of Glory is very specific, unlike another Great War film, All Quiet on the Western Front, which plays like a history textbook. They're both devastating, and both incredible. Paths of Glory is overwhelmingly negative, so the effect is overwhelmingly positive.Like a great, one cannot fully explain the reasons that make this great. The film opens to a general bullying another general. Eventually the second gives in, upon the issue of a promotion coming into question. He then passes the ridiculous order onto Dax (Kirk Douglas) who has no choice but to accept, despite being told just how bad it will be. We are then treated to some fantastic trench tracking shots,and then the battle occurs: it's chilling. A massive slaughter, very busy. Extraordinarily well done. Despite this, there's more courtroom drama than action, and the dialogue (and script) holds up excellently. There are some simply brilliant lines.Kubrick could finally go epic, with sweeping war scenes and indulgent 'civilized' halls. In a recurring pattern, the film is a technical marvel, with tight trenches, craters of mud, and explosions occurring feet from living actors. There are fantastic shots, namely the famous tracking shots, as well as trademark Kubrick lighting and nerve wracking music. Like another 1957 war film, the Bridge on the River Kwai, futility is king. If the enemy won't kill these men, we will! Ridiculous logic from ridiculous men. This film was banned in France for years, but it could've been applied to any nation: Britain, Russia, even Germany. The emotions of Paths of Glory are superbly delivered by the cast. Steely Kirk Douglas leads as Col. Dax, the man of honour, who honestly fights for his men selflessly, and leads to a spectacular outburst at the end. And you can tell it's going to happen throughout the film, he has a pent- up rage just beneath his skin. Opposite him are the two ignorant generals. Actors Macready and Menjou are great playing terribly self centered men, thinking more of their status than the status of their men. The soldiers show true desperation, such as Timothy Carey in a complete reversal from his hilarious role in the Killing. It's all gut wrenching.Then comes the ending, which wraps everything up that was started in this 88 minute epic. I won't spoil anything, except say that it's very fitting and hammers in the point, unlike Killer's Kiss which uprooted the entire film.If I haven't gotten it across to you, Paths of Glory is a fantastic anti war film where the good guys aren't the good guys, and with power comes irresponsibility. Even in black and white the film feels very modern. 9.2/10",9,0,1,17 April 2012
Raging Bull," Trotting Bull
","IMDb Top 250: 75I've heard a lot about Raging Bull. One of the best movies ever; best acting performance ever; robbed of Best Picture; its accolades are intimidating. So when I finally found it on Blu Ray, I gasped out loud. It had found me, and I was going to see the 'best sports movie ever made'.I made myself a snack, customary of any movie for me. I went to my basement, put the disc in my player, and started it up. Instantly, I was engaged: the menu, with De Niro warming up alone in the ring, a saddening orchestral melody; I knew this was going to demand my full attention. I ate my entire snack before starting, I didn't want to miss anything. I started: the old, fat LaMotta, rhyming to himself. Then BAM! fighting, 20 years earlier. This was it, a milestone in American cinema.Then the disappointment began. There was talking, and small fits of rage, but as the film progressed, I got... bored. Scorsese has never bored me. And the worst part was, I didn't know what was so bad! I've enjoyed old films, even silent films, but Raging Bull couldn't capture my attention. I waited, maybe it's about his descent, spiralling out of control, but no. He wins some fights, loses some, fights a few people, including his brother, a highlight of the film, loses the last fight, retires, goes to jail, then finds himself alone. There's no major catastrophes, minus the fight with his brother, and other than the boxing it's not exciting.There are still good things: I wouldn't award an 8 if there weren't. As you've probably heard, De Niro is amazing. After watching several bonus features, I can say he truly becomes the man, Jake LaMotta. He looks like him, fights like him, and probably thinks like him.Joe Pesci is great, and he is almost as volatile as his brother in the film.The use of black and white sets the film apart, and it feels right out of the 40's. However, the story stretches to the 60's, and the black and white feels a bit awkward then. I don't understand why the home movies are in colour. Maybe it the scenes with post-boxing LaMotta used colour, but diluted, an effect of evolution could occur.Lastly, the boxing is awesome. Brutal and visceral, the boxing stands out and makes the scenes outside the ring weaker in comparison. In turn, the editing is great, making the boxing believable.Usually, I can write a review soon after seeing a film. But not Raging Bull. I needed time to assess what just didn't work with me, and after my lacrosse game, when I was sick of working and felt like yelling at everything that just wasn't right, I figured it out. What makes his story so special? What did Jake LaMotta do to attract the attention of De Niro? It's obvious he has psychological problems, but it never feels like he's going to lose it in the film, and just destroy himself. The write-up says he obliterates opponents, and his family and friends, but he doesn't really, only yells and in one extreme scene hits them, but not intensely. This is a realistic film, with few stretched truths, but that could be one of its fatal flaws. By telling it like it happened, we doesn't feel worried about what'll happen, because all the action outside the ring is contained. The one time where it's uncaged, the Jenaro fight, I was finally in awe. That was the only raging I saw in Raging Bull.DeNiro is great, but the character he played is not. We have no sympathy for him. He's not a hero, he's not a villain, he's not an anti-hero, he's just a character. I'm sure there are other people in the world who did lose it. Maybe they deserve a movie about themselves. If Scorcese made a fictionalized version of this story, it could've been more shocking and intense.Lastly, I was misled. The menu used a sweeping orchestral track, but it's never heard again. In fact, other than a few 40's tracks, there was no music. Music could've added an emotional impact to scenes that needed direction, to help us feel the right emotions towards the characters. Especially with the mixed thoughts towards Jake LaMotta, music could've been really beneficial. A film that absolutely ACED the use of music in scenes is Requiem for a Dream. That is just the perfect use of sound to match the pictures on screen.In conclusion, Raging Bull couldn't live up to the hype I had for it. While De Niro and the fights were great, everything else was less than I expected. It's an important film that makes you reflect on yourself, but the intensity I expected just wasn't there. Leaving me with a film more appropriately called Trotting Bull. 7.8/10",8,0,0,13 June 2011
The Silence of the Lambs," The nature of the beast
","IMDb Top 250: 26Some films grab you in the first scene. Some grab you later on, and well some films don't grab you at all. The Silence of the Lambs gets your attention before you sit don to see it. It grabs you before you even think about seeing it. That's because the title alone is interesting: poetic, graceful, yet sinister. So you look it up, and the premise is more... dangerous... than the title even: An FBI trainee confides in an incarcerated, cannibalistic murderer to catch another serial killer who skins women. Wow. That's heavy stuff- now how does it relate to lambs? And from there you're hooked. Some books don't make good film material. The Silence of the Lambs made a masterpiece.It's no secret- the film is extraordinary. One of only 3 films to win all the 'major' Oscars (and personally it's the best of them), 'Silence' practically started the modern dark-crime sub genre. From Seven to The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo, it can all be traced back to this, and with good reason. Based on excellent source material, which I finished yesterday and will draw on later, The Silence of the Lambs has been imitated, parodied and drawn from an impossible amount of times, but the original still stands on its own.I've already mentioned the exquisite plot, a great mystery, or thriller, or horror, or however you define it. A huge success of the film is its atmosphere, a very dark, draining world. This is achieved through dark colours, small sets, and a haunting score by Howard Shore that is equally influential, even in his own later work like Seven. It never takes the credit, but constantly accompanies the action.The Academy will tell you how excellent the characters are. At the forefront are the two winners, Clarice and Lecter. I believe Clarice to be arguably the greatest female heroine ever. She is strong and determined, work-oriented in her male dominated world. But at the same time she can show vulnerability and fear. It's amazing. I'm glad the sub-subplot of her mild romance was removed. Hannibal Lecter. There's a name you won't forget, nor a face you'll forget. It's all been said before: Anthony Hopkins delivered one of the most legendary performances in cinema history as the charming and terrifying doctor. His facial expressions, his voice, his choice of words, even his posture. A perfect example of quality over quantity. The scenes these two share are very intense, with closeups. Lots of closeups.There's three other characters worth mentioning: Crawford, Starling's mentor, is the likable and work focused head of the Buffalo Bill case. While he suffered the most loss in transfer from book to screen, as well as the whole plot of his wife being removed, he is still likable, due to an honest performance. On the other hand, Chilton, the asylum doctor, is an absolute slimeball. He's a great character, but something about the portrayal is off. Lastly, and the most important one, Buffalo Bill, Jame Gumb. He is the single most terrifying, creepiest villain in fiction. He was scary in the book and in the film he'll make your stomach churn. The voice and look, and unbelievably freaky, scary, disturbing dance mark a CRIMINALLY underrated performance by Ted Levine, who I cannot see in any other role now. He IS Buffalo Bill.The first time I saw the film, one key thing I remember is the patience the film exhibits. Coarse language is used only when necessary, but more importantly is how violence and gore is treated. The book wasn't a gorefest, but there were ample opportunities for shock violence, like the picture of the nurse or the autopsy room. For the most part, the visual is held back, until that one sequence, and you'll know what I mean, when everything is gruesomely put on the table, and into your mind is burned several terrible images. Great films have patience, and this is a great film.I usually don't read source material, but I had to read this one. I'm not used to it, so I don't know how much films usually cut out from their books. But 'Silence' is very true to the core of the novel. The screenplay cuts out what you might expect: character development and history, as well as Bella, Klaus, the media and Southern angles, and unfortunately (for me) Barney and Bill's story. The film is short, just under 2 hours, but even with these shortcuts maintains the slow pace of the book. However the adaptation is very faithful to the book, and rises above in some places.Some scenes are handled much better with visuals. Lecter's cell is much better with glass instead of bars and nylon mesh (?), and the key sequence in Tennessee is spectacular, with the violence. And the ambulance, let to the imagination in the book, leaves viewers is absolute terror.Bookended by a great opening and closing, The Silence of the Lambs marks a milestone in film. It is an influential modern classic with brain and brawn, amazing performances and characters, and a smart plot. It's an icon of the genre, and a must see. 9.4/10",9,0,0,22 January 2012
The Dark Knight Rises," Excellent conclusion to an astounding trilogy
","Having successfully avoided all hype behind this film, not seeing any trailers or reading any articles, I saw The Dark Knight Rises the day I returned from my month-long trip. The film was great. That's no surprise. How great though? Well...I believe this film to be the weakest of the 3 Nolan Batman films, which is nothing to be ashamed of: it's like being the worst Lord of the Rings film, and I liked this significantly more than The Two Towers. All the Bale films deserve my 9s. But where Batman Begins had character and heart and The Dark Knight transcended the superhero sub-genre with the Joker, Dark Knight Rises is just an epic comic book story that wraps up the arcs and themes established by the trilogy while providing a villain who completely establishes a mood of hopelessness. Nolan seems to have wanted to go out with a physical bang, and so the epic scale of this film increased. You may like this change to a bigger stage, but personally I didn't. The small hand to hand fights that were so captivating in Batman Begins and the set pieces of The Dark Knight seem small compared to some of the explosive events that occur in Dark Knight Rises, but this makes the smaller scenes in DKR less significant. It also seems that there's less actual Batman in the film: he takes a very long time to show up, then takes an extended break in the middle. This leads to much more support screen time: the new characters make the first 20 minutes tough to understand as many banker characters and police officers are indistinguishable. The new cast members also reduce scenes with favourites like Alfred and Commissioner Gordon. However, some may welcome the change of lead characters.The story is strong, a complete package. There are slow segments, but the film is very satisfying, especially in its conclusion. As I've mentioned before, there is a relatively low percentage of Batman screen time. I hope you like Joseph Gordon- Levitt, as he has lots to do. The film also has a neat twist, though it doesn't really change much. There are small faults and unexplained actions, but nothing crucial. I'll say it again: the conclusion to the trilogy is remarkable in how it wraps up Bruce's story, while letting the audience make up in their minds what happens next for Gotham.The acting is excellent. There's no Joker to tentpole performances, (and no one could possibly hope to follow up the Joker) but everyone pulls their weight, especially Bale in his best turn as Batman and Hathaway as Catwoman (though she's never called that). Even more than when I saw it, I'm really liking Bane's treatment, especially his curious voice and menacing mask.The action and technical work, visual and audio, are supreme. The cinematography is masterful. Nothing else needs to be said about that.According to Nolan, pain, both physical and mental, is the main idea of the film. I found there to also be a positive message of hope in one fitting word, 'rise'. I like the positive end to such a dark series, one of the greatest trilogies of all time, the best comic book films of all time developed by one of the greatest movie-making teams of all time.8.7/10",9,3,8,27 July 2012
Blade Runner," The next generation of noir
","IMDb Top 250: 115Note: This is a review of The Final Cut.Don't be deceived by Harrison Ford's face and the bright neon signs: you will find no happiness in Blade Runner. Unapologetically draining, Blade Runner sees LA, 2019 as a packed slum of flying cars, advertisements and an especially Asian influx of culture. There is a hanging mood of decay, of uncaring, and it creates an empty feeling. Blade Runner is extraordinarily atmospheric. Also there's robots, and the robots- replicants- are a problem.Thus, the blade runners were created, police force (executioners) who retire (kill) illegal replicants on Earth. Deckard is one such hunter, played by Harrison Ford in his least macho and most vulnerable major role. He returns from (is forced out of) retirement to find and terminate 4 replicants, and this task composes the plot of the film.Despite the future setting, Blade Runner is an old school noir at heart, with a flawed protagonist,important setting, and menacing villains. It's the next generation of noir, both in the film and real life. Both in content and aesthetically, Blade Runner is ahead of the curve. The cheese of certain 80's sci-fi is non existent here, and I'm not sure if that relates to the DVD I have or if the film is just extra gorgeous. There's a certain aura of primitive technology with films like Close Encounters of the Third Kind and The Terminator that just isn't in this film. The cinematography and art design is magnificent, as well as Vangelis' electronic score.This serious film is filled with serious characters. Leading is the aforementioned Deckard, a victim of his city: he is constantly in a state of melancholy, and often found with a drink in his hand. He hasn't found what to do with himself, and it's so absorbing to see Ford in a weakened state. His prey, the replicants are also intriguing in their own ways: Batty, Pris and Leon. The all bring something different, a different angle. I won't even get into Batty's final, mission stating speech.One of the best things about sci-fi is that it can work with material that no other genre can. Blade Runner is outrageously packed with symbols and metaphors, such as eyes and origami. The film is filled with themes and open to many interpretations. I believe that all sci-fi can be applied to the present or past, and saw this situation as a parallel to post- Civil War America and found the ultimate message being that all life is precious, and that when we die things indescribable die with us. You can't live in fear. Oh, okay... Batty's speech... it's a show stopper, short but expansive in interpretation. Easily the most important scene in the film.Blade Runner is a giant in the genre, an incredibly important and influential film. It may be slow, but patience and an open mind is well rewarded. This film won't be lost to time like tears in the rain. 8.9/10",9,1,4,9 June 2012
Ben-Hur," Prepare for religion
","IMDb Top 250: 158Here's a fact: Ben-Hur won 11 Oscars, the most in history, and you'll keep thinking about that throughout the film. Here's a slightly opinionated fact: you may not like this as much as Spartacus, or Lawrence of Arabia, or even Gladiator if you've seen them first. That just how films age. And here's a slightly factual opinion: your religious views will affect your liking of the film. As such, this review is subjective in places.The synopsis claims this film is about Prince Judah Ben-Hur and how he is betrayed by a friend and comes back for revenge. That's not true. That's the plot of Gladiator. Ben-Hur begins the same way, and revenge is sought out... then the film goes on for another hour. This isn't necessarily a bad thing, just a little deceptive. I wasn't prepared for the complete family subplot, and being of a younger generation, I had no idea how prevalent Jesus and the beginnings of Christianity would be. I guess I'll get right to that. The scenes with Jesus are one of the two best scene types in the film. Seeing him give a pained Ben-Hur water is really something, but his final scene, won't spoil it here but you probably know how it ends, is elevating. I thought it was cool that they were showing Jesus to be realistic, simply a man teaching faith and how to live a better life... until the miracles came into play. It was too positive, considering the gut wrenching previous sequence.The other great scenes were the action scenes. The naval battle was remarkable, but most iconic is the chariot race that has held up remarkably. Its sheer scope and intensity is breathtaking, but its the cinematography that keeps the very long scene still relevant to today. Ben-Hur is a well-deserving recipient of its technical Oscars. The sets are grand and filled with period props, the costumes are innumerable and lavish, extras number in the thousands, the sound is remarkable and the music is bombastic. Despite running too long, Ben-Hur gives something good to look at for three and a half hours.The acting is tough to assess, because its of a different generation. Quick head turns to dramatic music happen frequently, as well as awkward less-than-5-second kisses. But Charlton Heston is great as the wrong Judah Ben-Hur, and nihilistic Quintius Aerius and the gambling horse racer are great characters as well. Messala certainly rises to meet Ben- Hur as the villain though. He's just a bad guy and right until the end he radiates lost love.Now I can't quite understand the moral of the story, so skip this paragraph over if you somehow haven't seen this film. Judah gets his revenge, and while 1) it's not intentional and 2) he doesn't enjoy it, he doesn't get the closure we thought he would get from it. Then he, because of timing, decides to follow Christianity, but only after his revenge was complete. Also, this is a quote from the synopsis on Wikipedia: 'Miriam and Tirzah are miraculously healed.' That's just bad plot for the sake of a happy ending. I don't really know what's accomplished by the end: I feel like without the miracle the ending would've had a most believable pro- Christian message by being fairly objective from non-believer Judah's view.Ben-Hur is a landmark in film that hasn't aged as well as some other similar films. Visually it remains spellbinding, but with a long runtime, muddled plot and uncertain message, it just can't hold up in today's less religious society. 7.7/10",8,1,3,21 June 2012
Trainspotting," Charm, culture and subtlety: but who needs that when you've got heroin?
","After more than 100 film reviews, I've decided that 9's or above are for films that knock me out in one way or another and completely immerse me in their world. Typically, it's incredible actors in their characters, or an atmosphere that bleeds out of the screen, epic scenes or wonderful music. Trainspotting defies this rule: it just raises its hand in class, says 'Here' in a thick Scottish accent, then begins. Trainspotting is superb and subtle, impossibly charming and quirky, with just the necessary amount of serious to remind you that drugs are no joke. Danny Boyle's direction is genius; he knows exactly what to show, for how long, and keeps the film concise.Interestingly, Trainspotting, a film about heroin addiction, doesn't spend an hour and a half shaking its accusative fist at heroin, saying 'Bad! Bad!' Unlike Requiem for a Dream, which is 100% damning of the drug, Trainspotting is more about the heroin users than the drug itself. And as Renton, the charismatic, slacker protagonist says early, they wouldn't do heroin if it was all bad. Because it's a recreational drug, it makes you feel good, and then you get addicted. To the lifestyle. To the people. Your 'friends'.Trainspotting establishes a very unique identity by fully embracing its Scottish 'pride', not that Renton would agree. There are Beatles references, Sick Boy can't go a scene without talking about Sean Connery, and the club scene is copy-pasted with love from A Clockwork Orange. Hearing Begbie speak, or the now- nostalgia inducing soundtrack with Iggy Pop and Underworld forces a smile on your face. Even though the film's about heroin and has some sick, sick images.Everything about the film is honest. Renton is honest. Mostly. All the characters have issues, and we love them. Even Spud. The acting is just what it needs to be, not serious philosophical looks at the human condition but some 20-somethings who make weak attempts to quit Junk. If anything I wish we saw more of the supporting cast: though the film's pace is incredibly fast, it would've been nice to see a little more of Tommy and Dianne, who get much less time on screen than I remembered from my first viewing. To add credibility to this: True Romance features the most magnetic character Gary Oldman has ever played, a trash pimp. Even though he has no purpose but to ****spoilers* die *end**** his one scene is extended and it's the best scene in the film. An issue with drug films is that no matter how well they are made, the message is always the same, and it's a no-brainer. Drugs are bad. So I tried to find something else watching Trainspotting, and I came up with this: the film is a metaphor, saying 'quit screwing around with excuses and do something with yourself', using the most powerful addictive substance as the vessel to convey this. If there's something you want to change about yourself, you won't escape it by staying in the same environment. Peer pressure ensures this. Perhaps those 'friends' aren't really your friends after all. I remember being 13 seeing this for the first time. I enjoyed its plot, though I couldn't understand any of the dialogue or any of the subtle symbols or literary devices. Ironically now, the one I saw it with didn't get the message, and now, years later, he's 'trainspotting'. Trainspotting is an amazing film that holds you dear. 9.4/10",9,2,3,24 November 2012
The Deer Hunter," What a profound effect.
","IMDb Top 250: 134Usually when someone references a film, you say something along the lines of, 'Oh yeah! That one! Awesome film.' Even if its something serious with merit, not just a blockbuster. I don't think I'll be giving that kind of reception when The Deer Hunter comes up in topic, if it ever does. It's an excellent film, but having seen it now I find myself with this feeling of loneliness and sadness. Despite appearing to be a war film, there's very, very little actual war. Most of the film takes place in a Pennsylvania steel town, showing the social lives of a group of blue collar friends. In fact, that's the first hour. It certainly feels long, and after at least 40 minutes one wonders if the plot is ever going to move. But then, very abruptly, it does and one of the most famous scenes in film comes around which you've no doubt at least heard about. Russian roulette. The tension is unbearable. The film eventually gets back to Pennsylvania and shows the effect of the conflict on the returning soldiers and the town. Today it seems most war films carry the 'this is a war film so we have to show how wasteful war is' motto. That worked for All Quiet on the Western Front and Paths of Glory, but with the news today and knowledge of history, we get it: war is terrible. So films like this get points for thinking differently, in this case focusing on the characters not as soldiers, but as men. Many war films try to add depth by having soldiers talk about 'back home': The Deer Hunter shows it for two hours. That's why I have the sick feeling, because of what the film tries to say that is less frequently explored.It's all so believable because of the terrific acting. Robert De Niro leads as Mike, the cool bearded deer hunter who tries to keep his friends together, who won't give Stan his boots, and who yells in the face of death. I've always admired De Niro's work and this is one of his best.But De Niro isn't the only artist in the cast: Christopher Walken, Oscar winner shines as Nicky, the boy who became a man, or something. His eyes change as he does. Stevie is emotionally draining in his scenes, for like Nicky he is out of his element and can't cope. This is a film that doesn't get justice in writing. It needs to be experienced, but not everyone will enjoy it. For two hours there is only talking, and it can grow tedious at times but there is payoff in the end. A piece of art that leaves you unhappy, but satisfied. 8.5/10",8,0,1,22 June 2012
Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows: Part 2," Oh, the childhood
","10 years after it began, the Harry Potter films concluded with a two- part finale. I grew up with Harry Potter: there are pictures on my wall of me as him for Halloween, I remember going to several Harry Potter- themed birthday parties, and I have specific memories of reading the first and last books. So I was prepared for an emotional conclusion. Hell, if Lord of the Rings (something I liked but was never been invested in) could move me, surely this backbone of growing up could.Not quite. Part II gets a lot right, but I feel like many things didn't live up to their potential, and the film didn't take itself seriously enough.The good: there is a well-done conclusion for one of the best literary series of all time. The key points are there. Visually, everything is stunning as it has always been. And the performances, something I never paid attention to, are excellent. Harry, Hermoine, Ron... all admirable, but the standouts are Ralph Fiennes, maybe the greatest villain actor of all time, as Voldemort at his strongest and most terrifying. And Alan Rickman as Snape, arguably the best character from the whole series, tragedy and true loyalty personified.Major points for including a throwback scene to my favourite of the films, The Chamber of Secrets. I remember seeing that one and being scared silly.But then the issues... first of all, the film is short. There was time to expand aspects of the film. Which leads to the next problem, which is that the support cast doesn't get very much screen time. Hagrid offers two lines. The aforementioned Snape, in his most important book/film, sees three scenes. But the cuts don't end there: the final battle doesn't feel as satisfying as it does. The Weasleys have two emotional scenes during it, and both are glazed over. Neville's time to shine also doesn't feel proper.And then there's the ironically distracting movie magic. The hero climbing up from the destroyed bridge. How many times can Harry and Voldemorts wands' stop their beams right in the middle in an epic duel? By the end the effect is predictable. Also the film adds humour where humour definentley should not be. I remember that starting with Goblet of Fire the change to tone to being much darker, and in fact I didn't quite like the change. But now I'm more mature, and feel that this one tried to lighten up the tone, but unsuccessfully. McGonnagel has some real bad lines in particular. So Harry Potter is done, but I felt it went out with more of a flipendo than a rictusempra. The epilogue is nice and touching, but failed to have 'oomph' like Lord of the Rings. A legendary series with a satisfactory send-off. 7.7/10",8,1,3,24 June 2012
Rear Window," ...Look Closer
","Rear Window is perceived to be a Hitchcock staple, and with good reason. You've got your star protagonist; a young, blonde leading lady, and a real- world scenario that provides plenty of his trademark suspense.In one of those premises that is just meant for film, Jimmy Stewart is an injured photographer who gets interested in his apartment block. And for the first half hour, that's all that happens. We meet his not-quite- mutual girlfriend Lisa, charmingly played by Grace Kelly. Then we look at the neighbours and see a bit of who they are. One in particular catches Jeffries' eye, a salesman who likes to take late night walks...And thus the caper begins. How can you build a case from an apartment, bound to a wheelchair? That's where all of the action takes place, leading to a certain enclosure in the film, but also a sense of home. The question becomes, did he even do it? Jeffries works to prove it, but we also need convincing too. And Detective Doyle doesn't believe it, and our own loyalty wavers too. Once the film picks up, and it slowly picks up until the tense finale, we aren't quite sure which way the story will go.First, eat while watching the film. The first act is slow, and maybe even a bit too long. Second, it's certainly dated, more so than say Psycho or Rope (I give Rope the slight edge to this film). Certain elements, including one very important camera flash, breaks the otherwise sublime tension that had been building to a crescendo the entire film. The falling action is also quite weak, an issue that soured the ending of North by Northwest as well. If you've enjoyed Hitchcock's other work and look past these issues then Rear Window will knock you out, but in the grand comparison these are issues that other films don't have.Is Rear Window a great film? Yes. Is it one of the absolute best films ever made? Not quite. It is one of Hitch's finest, but that doesn't make it faultless- his films all have the same issues with slow beginnings and fast endings. Nevertheless it is a wonderful 50's thriller that makes for a fun time. 8.5/10",8,0,1,7 January 2013
The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King," Fantasy masterpiece
","IMDb Top 250: 12 The Lord of the Rings: Return of the King is an incredible conclusion to the trilogy, a masterpiece of its genre, and a fantastic film. It wraps up everything, and has the biggest, most grand, epic battle ever. If you've seen the first two films and just haven't found time for the third, go make time and reward yourself four 3 and a half hours.The opening scene came completely out of left field, and left me thinking. It shows how Smeagol came to acquire the Ring, and the power it instantly had over him. We also see what the mad creature looked like before he was, well, Gollum. It's a great flashback, like a Lost flashback, and lets us learn about of the most interesting characters in the mythology.Then, like a good conclusion, there is buildup. The characters reunite, and realize that this is it, the final battle. At the same time, Frodo and Sam begin to near the end of their journey, and their scenes actually serve a purpose. We see the Black Gate, and the emergence of Sauron's army with the too-cool Witch King.We watch the seaside town by Gondor fall easily, and later a grisly part involving catapults and heads that seemed just a tad too mature, but reminds the viewer the ferocity and primitive nature of the Orcs. In a grand montage, the beacons are lit, signalling Rohan to aid. During this, Aragorn, Legolas and Gimli go to find aid from elsewhere. The stage is set for a huge battle.And what a battle it is. Other than the Mines, this is easily the single greatest scene in the trilogy. It takes up a good chunk of the film. The scale and visual realization is unrivalled. The elephants complete the scene, as well as the Witch King's fate. It's spellbinding.The Ring, finally taking a toll on Frodo, nears Mount Doom. While the giant war is a massive battle, the Ring quest is a small battle. Frodo tragically has degenerated, with Sam having to push him to the end. The scene inside the volcano is amazing, as well as Frodo's line. These two plots are interwoven and create the most remarkable fantasy ever on screen.After all is said and done, we are treated to a bittersweet epilogue showing what happens to the characters, giving good closure. Return of the King is a stunning film, worthy of its Oscar glory and critical praise. I'll let the number speak for itself. 9.6/10",10,0,1,21 August 2011
The Matrix," One of the coolest films ever
","IMDb Top 250: 23The Matrix is an unreasonably awesome movie. The stunts, the effects, the black suits and shades- The Matrix is dripping awesomeness. But unlike many other action and sci-fi movies, The Matrix has brains.The plot of The Matrix is like Terminator for the internet generation. Man created machine, machine rebelled, machine won. Human survivors fight machines in a constantly dark, post-apocalyptic world. But the machines created the matrix, a giant computer program where the farmed humans' minds live their 'lives'. It's complicated, but it all makes sense. The Matrix's plot demands brain and eye attention.The actors are perfectly chosen. Keanu Reeves in a role where he's supposed to be quiet and badass? Perfect! He was made to be Neo. Laurence Fishborne aces the wise leader, and he busts his chops during the interrogation. Hugo Weaving is really the show stealer though: his Agent is so menacing, and when he opens up to Morpheus, it's very tense.This is an action movie, and boy is there action. The martial arts scenes are so incredible, and the insanity allowed because of the setting makes them even better. Running air kicks? Punches that break walls? It's all cool in the matrix. And the gunfights: the iconic lobby shootout, and the even more iconic bullettime gives The Matrix identity in a sea of sci-fi.The action is boosted by the success of the effects. Agent bullet dodging, the explosions, the rippling bullets, your jaw will drop. The 'fluff effect' in the lobby is so cool too. It made me wonder why this has never been seen in 3D. Also, the CGI machines are terrifying and realistic.You should see The Matrix, benchmark of sci-fi films for the past decade. Matching brawn with brain, you really can't miss this modern classic. 9.4/10",9,0,1,4 August 2011
Casino," Goodfellas Pt.II, in all the right ways
","The simply titled 'Casino', one of many Scorsese/ De Niro collaborations, tells the fact-based story of Las Vegas, 1970. Many themes are present, most notably the power of money and greed. The usual suspects are here, and both De Niro and Joe Pesci fit their roles very well; De Niro the suave, level-headed thinker, and Pesci the volatile buttonman.Five minutes in, and an appropriate title popped into my head: Goodfellas Part II. All the signature aspects of that bar-setting film are present in Casino: smart-talking, wiseguy narrators, constant music in the background, constant action and furious dialogue, swearing (you won't BELIEVE some of Pesci's rants), and dripping mafia style. One thing that isn't the same though is setting: Las Vegas.The stakes here are higher, so lots about the movie has been scaled up as well. The plot is rich, with many angles. Goodfellas had a more contained story with less to explain, or it was just explained better. The first 20 minutes of Casino tell you all kinds of Vegas info very quickly. I hope you know your gambling. I don't want to say it's a fault, because it's very necessary, but it seems almost rushed. But it's not like it would affect the runtime, the film is almost 3 full hours. I'm a fan of that though, this is a bog movie with lots to tell. And because of great pacing and exciting moments, it's a 3 hour treat.The content has been elevated too. Violent and vulgar, this is not a film for kids. But it's all important. Pesci's character Nicky does most of the swearing, probably 300 or so f words from him alone, because he's always in a foul mood, which makes him unpredictable. Then there's the violence. Starting with a scene involving a pen, this is super-duper violent, showing just what people do to get what they want, or because they're crazy Nicky.If you told someone this was a Scorsese/Tarantino collaboration, they'd probably believe you. Scenes with the vice, hammer and bat are right out of the Tarantino killbook, or out of Dead Rising. They keep you on edge and are brutal.Casino takes everything about Goodfellas, minus Ray Liotta, and puts it in Vegas. Except for a confusing start that can't really be dealt with, the only reason Casino didn't enjoy the success of Goodfellas is its bland name and being released 5 years later. See Goodfellas, then see this. 8.9/10",9,1,2,14 June 2011
Cloud Atlas," A soul's odyssey
","Cloud Atlas is unlike its contemporaries at the multiplex. It tells a big story in an engaging, difficult fashion. It has big names and a big budget. But it also is thematically dense it wants to tell you something through plot, characters, dialogue and symbols. Cloud Atlas is also thankfully a very enjoyable film, much longer and denser than much of what is available today. 'Ambition' defines this film. In just under 3 hours, six radically different stories are told, and they appeal to a broad audience: a 19th century tale of unlikely brotherhood, the letters of a gay composer to his partner in the 1930's, a San Francisco- set conspiracy in the 70's, A hilarious account of an old publisher's woes. A Blade Runner-esque clone's struggle for freedom, and the survival of a tribe after 'The Fall'. Genre conventions are toppled, as these stories with different tones are juggled in short intervals, leading from comedic highs to shocking drama in minutes.But as with the characters, these plots are connected thematically, and clever wordplay and visual imagery links the stories, such as the end of a monologue referencing 'the gates of Hell' and cutting to a shot of the gates of a building that, for Cavendish at least, is the gates of Hell. Each of the stories has strengths, a few have faults, but together the medley is incredible. I found that while the earliest two stories began slowly and plainly, they developed very well and provided fantastic drama, especially the 1849 story. The Nuclear thriller was strong, Halle Berry is great and there are some real twists, and I also loved the 'Dirty Harry' and 'China Syndrome' vibes, but comedy bled into it from the 2012 story which diminished the climax. The 2012 story is hilarious, and its first scene is a standout; Tom Hanks is incredible as Dermot Hoggins. Although while the story is interesting, it doesn't fit quite so well thematically- it's almost too light. Listening to the 'Cloud Atlas Sextet' fits with all the stories, but can't resonate with Cavendish's. The future Korea is visually stunning and communicates its themes well, certainly the darkest plot, but the action can get over the top (Yes, I know who directed this) and there are some horrible clichés. But that scene of horrendous dialogue, the weakest in the film, can't derail a great piece. Lastly is the bleak, Hawaii- set post-apocalyptic story. It was my favourite, possibly because I'm a sucker for anything involving apocalypse. But Hanks and Berry are fantastic again, the barbarians are menacing and scary, and the story is cool. It also concludes the film perfectly.I've only talked about the plot! The actors really steal the show. In the credits, each actor's name is placed with a clip of every one of their characters everyone in the theatre stopped and stayed. People play characters you had no idea they played. A few highlights: Sturgess' lawyer and the slave Autua, Frobisher, Hugh Grant's sexist nuclear boss, Cavendish and Hanks' Hoggins. Doona Bae as Somni and Hugo Weaving's 'Old Georgie' round it out- the latter is truly a demon. Much credit has to go to the makeup, literally making actors disappear into their roles. There is a huge number of transsexual and even race-bridging roles- it's worthy of note that Lana Wachowski was at one point Larry Wachowski. Also deserving of praise, and possibly Oscars is the large scale visual effects that cover hundreds of years and look so believable. Sound quality is top-notch as well, listening to Old Georgie is chilling, as is the vision of Korean diners, and well... the whole future.But all this plot serves a purpose, and Cloud Atlas intends to tell you things. Freedom is possibly the biggest theme, as well as the idea that our actions affect others greatly throughout time: we're part of a large human network. Really though there's so much to talk about you should just see the film. There are small stumbles every so often, but the structure hides them very well. No one story takes more time than others, no one character takes more time than others, and the structure and pacing drives the film forward briskly. It's a shame this film hasn't been better received commercially, because it's a phenomenal achievement, interesting sci-fi and drama, and as of now, the best film I've seen in 2012. 8.8/10",9,326,481,3 November 2012
Sin City," Everything is bigger in Sin City
","IMDb Top 250: 108Can you tolerate extreme violence, lavish sexiness and black comedy? It all awaits you in Sn City: an unbelievably cool and gritty film, a heavily, heavily stylized neo-noir, and a 'comic book come to life'. Take a still shot from the film and you could confuse it with a detailed comic. Before discussing the rest of the film I'll get this out of the way: Sin City is the most visually arresting film I have seen thus far, and is an artistically amazing piece of art.After an interesting prologue to hotwire a viewer into the Sin City style, we are treated to a very Grand Theft Auto-esque opening credits, with comic book characters and their respective actors, accompanied by the slickest theme music in recent memory. Then we are thrown into the first of several tales of crime, hookers and violence- which at their core are really stories of love and its... derivatives. The stories a very engaging and twisted, and offer good closure. And they're refreshingly straightforward, surprising considering Tarantino is onboard as a 'special guest director'.As over the top as the art style is, the characters are just as big. There's no singular protagonist, but a cast of heroes and villains. Hartigan is a true hero, the incorruptible savior. In contrast, the other major 'hero', Marv, is just a simple and passionate man. Much less physically imposing than these two is Dwight, the closest thing to a straight character, but who still has his quirks. The entire support is great, including Jackie Boy and the sickening Yellow Bastard, as well as by all the female cast, who are either strippers, dancers, or an assassin. Special note goes to the character of Kevin, played eerily by Elijah Wood. He's absolutely terrifying, especially with the hypnotic theme that always plays in his presence. The cast is amazing, and everyone has a large dose of 'comic' in their performances.As stylish as the visuals are, the action equals. Men go flying after punches,blood sprays, and cars fly over bumps. There are many astounding scenes of violence, as well as monologues and narrations only possible in a film like this. The action is over the top, the carnage outrageously brutal, with hints of absolute black comedy. (Swastika shurikens? The Yellow Bastard?) Sin City has fantastic, loving direction, and is a magnificent technical and artistic achievement that cranks to '10' in every category but swearing. It's a top tier noir, and a very unique film. If it was a wholly original concept for the screen I think it could have been lauded even more. If you can handle this, see it. 8.9/10",9,2,3,17 February 2012
Gladiator," Epic.
","Gladiator is one of the most epic movies ever. Grand, bloody and violent, you will be drawn to Maximus Decimus Meridius' struggle for the entirety of the film.It starts with a concept, and Gladiator is prime film material. Historical fiction? Good and evil? Betrayal and revenge? Action? Some film concepts work, some don't. This does.The action sequences are intense, with the creative team asking themselves, 'What can make this fight more nuts than the last? Chariots? Tigers?' And we look to see it. Visceral and well done, the many battles are the best part of Gladiator.Characters in Gladiator are well designed. We root for Maximus, the good guy who lost it all. We hate Commodus, the coward. We don't feel pity for the bad gladiators: they're meant to kill our hero! Maximus is well-developed for an action hero, he believes in the afterlife and has rituals.Have I mentioned how epic Gladiator is? It's size is intimidating. The gigantic opening, the first fight, and the entrance to the Colosseum... magnificent.Gladiator is one of the best pictures of the last decade, one of the best epics ever, and a deserving Best Picture winner. 9.3/10",9,1,3,31 July 2011
Donnie Darko," Ignore the backlash anti-hype
","I don't remember why I decided to watch this the first time, other than the strange allure of the concept and the creepiness of Frank. But I do remember why I've watched it every time since.Everything about this assemblage of pictures, sounds and ideas works. From the eerie opening scene to the thought- shattering climax, you will love Donnie Darko, Kitty Farmer, and everything in between.A major aspect of the film's success is its quirky atmosphere. The licenced soundtrack, including Echo and the Bunnymen and Joy Division, perfectly sets the 80's mood. Even greater though is the original soundtrack, which can't be described as anything other than haunting, is perfect. Mixed with great camera-work and lighting, Donnie Darko engulfs you in its world.Inside its world are the characters, and there are very few movies with an equal cast. With a mix of stars like Drew Barrymore and Patrick Swayze, and up-and-comers Jake Gylenhaal and Seth Rogen (!) , Donnie Darko's characters will steal your heart. Donnie is the confused, lonely teenager everyone can relate too, the bullies are legitimately scary, and even the annoying Ms. Kitty Farmer is so sensitive you just won't be able to help yourself from smiling whenever she has a scene. Completed by amazing dialogue, (the dinner, talk of smurfs), the characters and acting in Donnie Darko are another reason to see this movie.Lastly, the story. Simply put, you can't see Donnie Darko once. You may think you understand it, but then the end comes and WHAM you mind is in shambles. It demands several viewings. I've seen it on YouTube, rental, and three times on Blu Ray and still don't understand what truly occurs. Eventually, you might give up.Donnie's tale has it all, and might blow your mind by the end. 9.8/10",10,1,4,4 June 2011
Back to the Future," Back... to the 80's!
","There are always decade-defining films. They may not be the best films of the decade, but they capture the feel of living in them. Back to the Future IS the 80's. It's funny, charming, sweet, and completely enjoyable. Dare, I say, it's one of the most enjoyable films ever made.There had to be a point during the writing process when someone said, 'This is it.' The plot is movie magic. Teenager goes back in time to save his future by fixing the past of his parents? Brilliant! And it works so well because of the phenomenal, tightly written script. All the little things are important and all tie together. It's so cool to see the same scene happen in two time periods, but the action is exactly the same. Like the diner with Biff/ Marty's house with Biff. It's laugh out loud funny, with plenty of period gags (Reagan, who the hell is John F. Kennedy?), and sweet, with goodbyes and relationships that clearly inspired modern film and TV (Lost Season 5?). The pacing is perfect, with a constant sense of movement, and Zemeckis can weave suspense whenever he wants, be it the first 88 mph or the super- tense climax.In this cartoon world are cartoon characters, and Back to the Future is filled with gems. Marty McFly, one of the most iconic teenagers,is pure charisma. 'That's heavy stuff!' We wish we were Marty. He's too cool. Doc Brown, with his great phrases and even better facial expressions, is just so dang lovable. And the first time I saw this, I completely overlooked George McFly. He is hilarious. Brilliantly pathetic.It's impossible to not like Back to the Future. Sometimes it crosses the line into cheesy (NOOOOO!), the CG looks fake in some places, and personally I don't like the role reversal of George and Biff at the end (he became what we hated in the beginning), but those are small things. Back to the Future is one of the best 80's movies, and has undeniable charm. You have to see this one. 9.3/10",9,0,0,2 December 2011
Goodfellas," You really are a funny guy!
","IMDb Top 250: 15 Goodfellas is one of the best films ever. It's dramatic, charming, crazy and even a bit funny. Chronicling the rise and fall of wiseguy Henry Hill from the 50's to the 80's, Goodfellas is the best look at mob life... after the Godfather. This is Scorcese's best work that I have seen.The plot can be summarized very easily: Henry Hill wants to be a gangster, and when he becomes one he lives the life, good and bad. A biography like this could be shown in an average way, but it has the Scorcese touch. The presentation of Goodfellas is, in my opinion the most interesting and engaging in film. Period music plays throughout, Hill and Karen narrate with charm, and the pacing is perfect. Goodfellas doesn't have a dull moment.The characters are top-notch cinema, interesting and flawed. Hill, our anti-hero, is a charming Irish-Italian nobody who becomes a somebody. He looks cool, talks cool, and acts cool, until he gets in over his head with products and problems. Jimmy Conwa is the high roller, stuffing everyone's pockets with money, playing it cool until his neck is on the line. And Tommy, dear volatile Tommy, whose voice and actions steal the show, is an Italian fireball who is unpredictable. All expertly acted, these are the guys you wish you could be. Karen is also well-acted, from innocence to involvement. The entire cast of Goodfellas are personalities.This film has its share of incredible cinematic moments. From the pistol-whipping to the montage of deaths, every scene is crafted with care. Two in particular have stood above the rest though: the famous 'How am I funny?' speech, a highlight of the rapid-fire dialogue, and the long shoot, showing Henry and Karen's date from a single perspective. Genius directing.The mood is wonderful, helped profusely by the music. Starting with oldies to show the golden age of gangsters, the music progresses in the same direction as the plot. It's unbelievable. When you hear songs from the movie, you think of Goodfellas. I hated 'Sunshine of Your Love' until Goodfellas, and when I hear it now I think of Jimmy Conway, smoking his cigarette, thinking, as the camera slowly zooms in.A classic, Goodfellas has inspired countless films even to this day. Every part of this crime masterpiece is top- notch. If you like movies, you have to see this. 9.7/10",10,2,5,22 August 2011
The Godfather," I believe in America
","IMDb Top 250: 2 The Godfather is the single greatest film ever made. A lofty claim, but so far there is not a single picture elsewhere that I feel deserves that title. And you're going to find out why.The Godfather tells the sprawling tale of the Corleone family, a mafia family after the Second World War. Over the course of the 2 hours and 50 minute epic, you will see the best drama, characters and atmosphere to ever grace the screen.It starts with the Godfather Waltz theme, an iconic piece. Just like that, the stage is set for the most Italian film ever. I believe it was the producer who wanted Coppola to direct because he was Italian. He wanted audiences to 'smell the spaghetti' watching this film. Anyway, we then cut to a man's face, talking to an unseen figure, pleading to him for justice. Emotion drips off every word. Every scene in the Godfather has purpose, every line of dialogue has meaning. The camera switches to the other side of the table- Marlon Brando sits, hair slicked, moustache, rose in suit, cat on lap, in all of his glory as Don Vito Corleone, one of the most iconic characters ever.Have I said 'iconic' a lot? Much of the Godfather is. The Don himself, Michael's rise, Sonny's temper, the offer you can't refuse.The setting is very important to the Godfather. 1946 New York is wonderfully put together, as well as the hills of Sicily and for a short period of time, Las Vegas. Every scene is full, no scene is filler. Inside of each scene is dialogue- lots of it. But you'll hang on to every word, because of the content and the flawless delivery. Action in the Godfather is sparse, but like the hits shown, short and brutal. You'll be kept on your toes. Anyone can die at any moment, and they do. The pacing is perfect.The characters are some of the greatest compiled in a film, and any of the major characters could carry a film on their own. The Don's mumble, appearance and honour are perfected by Brando. Pacino convincingly, slowly shows what being in a mafia family can do to even a kind boy who isn't a part of it. Tom Hagen is the logic and calm in the sea of guns and violence. And Sonny, with his temper and tongue steals scenes.Perfectly executed, the sweeping story is so well interwoven you might not get it all on the first viewing. It all makes sense though: everything happens for a reason, and everything is explained. From the beginning wedding, to the diner, and ending with Michael's transformation, the plot of the Godfather is one of the best.I hope I've convinced you to see this masterpiece, or if you've already seen it, see it again. No amount of talking can equal to actually seeing it. Better than Shawshank, better than its own Part II, The Godfather is the best movie ever made and you cannot say you love movies until you've seen the Godfather. See this movie, and order a lasagna. 10/10",10,1,3,9 August 2011
